His last movie role was as an aging doctor in ''[[The Last Angry Man]]'' (1959), and he was again nominated for an Oscar. After that, Muni mostly retired from acting to deal with failing eyesight and other health problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osborne&quot; /&gt; He made his final screen appearance on television, in a guest role on the dramatic series ''[[Saints and Sinners (1962 TV series)|Saints and Sinners]]'' in 1962.

== Acting techniques, reputation, and legacy ==
[[Image:Muni Scarface 2.JPG|thumb|300px|Paul Muni in the trailer for ''Scarface'']]
Muni was noted for his intense preparation for his roles, especially the biographies. While preparing for ''The Story of Louis Pasteur'', Muni said, &quot;I read most everything that was in the library, and everything I could lay my hands on that had to do with Pasteur, with [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Lister]], or with his contemporaries.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title=Paul Muni, Actor, Dies on Coast; Won Fame in Biographical Roles; Portrayed Darrow, Pasteur, Zola, Juarez and Gangster in Stage and Film Career| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/08/26/archives/paul-muni-actor-dies-on-coast-won-fame-in-biographical-roles.html| newspaper=The New York Times| date=August 26, 1967|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; He did the same in preparing for his role as Henry Drummond, based on Clarence Darrow, in the play ''Inherit the Wind''. He read what he could find, talked to people who knew Darrow personally, and studied physical mannerisms from photographs of him. &quot;To Paul Muni, acting was not just a career, but an obsession&quot;, writes ''The New York Times''. They note that despite his enormous success both on Broadway and in films, &quot;he threw himself into each role with a sense of dedication.&quot; Playwright [[Arthur Miller]] commented that Muni &quot;was pursued by a fear of failure.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot; /&gt;

As Muni was born into an acting family, with both of his parents professional actors, &quot;he learned his craft carefully and thoroughly.&quot; On stage, &quot;a Muni whisper could reach the last balcony of any theater&quot;, writes the ''Times''. It wrote that his style &quot;had drawn into it the warmth of the Yiddish stage&quot;, in which he made his debut at the age of 12. In addition, his technique in using makeup &quot;was a work of art.&quot; Combined with acting which followed no &quot;method&quot;, he perfected his control of voice and gestures into an acting style that was &quot;unique.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot; /&gt;

Film historian [[David Shipman (writer)|David Shipman]] described Muni as &quot;an actor of great integrity&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Shipman&quot;&gt;{{cite book| first=David| last=Shipman| title=The Great Movie Stars: The Golden Years| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yuK0AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=muni| publisher=Crown| year=1970| pages=434, 437| isbn=978-0600338178}}&lt;/ref&gt; noting he meticulously prepared for his roles. Muni was widely recognized as eccentric if talented: he objected to anyone wearing red in his presence, and he could often be found between sessions playing his [[violin]]. Over the years, he became increasingly dependent on his wife, Bella, a dependence which increased as his failing eyesight turned to blindness in his final years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shipman&quot; /&gt; Muni was &quot;inflexible on matters of taste and principle&quot;, once turning down an $800,000 movie contract because he was not happy with the studio's choice of film roles.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot; /&gt;

Although Muni was considered one of the best film actors of the 1930s, some film critics such as [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] and [[Andrew Sarris]], accuse him of overacting.

German director [[William Dieterle]], who directed him in his three biopics, also frequently accused him of overacting, despite his respect for the actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Gerd| last=Gem√ºnden| title=Continental Strangers: German Exile Cinema, 1933-1951| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pF2rAgAAQBAJ&amp;q=muni+dieterle| publisher=McFarland| date=February 18, 2014| page=60| isbn=978-0231166799}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==

In his private life, Muni was considered &quot;exceedingly shy&quot;, and was discomfited to be recognized while out shopping or dining. He enjoyed reading and going for walks with his wife in secluded sections of [[Central Park]]. He always arrived at the theater by 7:30 pm to prepare for that night's performance. After retiring from acting, he lived in California, in what was considered an &quot;austere&quot; setting, where his wife and he enjoyed their privacy. In his den, which he called his &quot;Shangri-La&quot;, he spent time reading books and listening to the radio.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot; /&gt; Muni died of a heart disorder in [[Montecito, California]], in 1967, aged 71. He is interred in the [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]], Hollywood.

== Legacy and honors ==

Muni has four official [[Academy Award]] nominations for Best Actor, winning for ''The Story of Louis Pasteur'' (1936) and receiving official nominations for ''I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang'' (1932), ''The Life of Emile Zola'' (1937), and ''[[The Last Angry Man]]'' (1959). His nomination for the film ''The Valiant'' (1929) is unofficial. The reason for this being that at the [[2nd Academy Awards]], no acting nominees were announced, only the Best Actor and Actress winners were announced, with the Academy Awards official site stating &quot;Although not official nominations, the additional names in each category, according to in-house records, were under consideration by various boards of judges&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp? |work=Academy Awards Database |title=1928/29 2nd Academy Awards |date=24 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194626/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp |archivedate=October 29, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Muni's performance in ''Black Fury'' was not nominated for an Oscar (see note below filmography).

'''Brandy''' is a [[liquor]] produced by [[Distillation|distilling]] [[wine]]. Brandy generally contains 35‚Äì60% [[alcohol by volume]] (70‚Äì120 [[alcohol proof|US proof]]) and is typically consumed as an [[Ap√©ritif and digestif|after-dinner digestif]]. Some brandies are aged in [[barrel|wooden casks]]. Others are coloured with [[caramel colouring]] to imitate the effect of aging, and some are produced using a combination of both aging and colouring. Varieties of wine brandy can be found across the winemaking world. Among the most renowned are [[Cognac]] and [[Armagnac]] from [[South West France (wine region)|southwestern France]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/brandy |title=Brandy |work=BBC |accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a broader sense, the term ''brandy'' also denotes liquors obtained from the distillation of [[pomace]] (yielding [[pomace brandy]]), or mash or wine of any other fruit ([[fruit brandy]]).&lt;ref name=kirk&gt;{{cite book|title=Kirk-Othmer Food and Feed Technology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f--1V1ftgtsC&amp;pg=PA151 |page=151 |isbn=9780470174487 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |date=2007-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{Britannica|77749}}&lt;/ref&gt; These products are also called ''[[eau de vie]]'' (which translates to &quot;water of life&quot;).

==History==
The origins of brandy are tied to the development of [[distilled beverage|distillation]]. While the process was known in classical times, it was not used for significant beverage production until the 15th century.&lt;ref name=bnf&gt;{{cite book| title=Plants: Diet and Health |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FYKT8ApFnj0C&amp;pg=PA174 |author=British Nutrition Foundation's Task Force |page=174 |editor=Gail Goldberg |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2008 |isbn=9781405147729}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=faith&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GNUVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56 |title=Cognac: The story of the world's greatest brandy |author=Nicholas Faith |publisher=Infinite Ideas |year=2013 |isbn=9781906821791}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fj6xh-lUJEQC&amp;pg=PA2 |title=The Brandy Trade Under the Ancien R√©gime |author=L. M. Cullen |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |isbn=9780521890984}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 16th century French brandy helped kickstart the cross-Atlantic [[triangle trade]] when it took over the central role of the Portuguese [[fortified wine]] due to its higher alcohol content and ease of shipping. Canoemen and guards on the African side of the trade were generally paid in brandy. By the late 17th century rum had replaced brandy as the exchange alcohol of choice in the triangle trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Standage 2006&quot; &gt;{{cite book |last1=Standage |first1=Tom |title=A History of the World in 6 Glasses |date=2006 |publisher=Walker Publishing Company |location=New York, New York |isbn=9780802715524 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780802715524 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, wine was distilled as a [[Food preservation|preservation]] method and as a way to make it easier for merchants to transport. It is also thought that wine was originally distilled to lessen the tax which was assessed by volume. The intent was to add the water removed by distillation back to the brandy shortly before consumption. It was discovered that after having been stored in [[aging barrel|wooden casks]], the resulting product had improved over the original distilled spirit.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; In addition to removing water, the distillation process led to the formation and decomposition of numerous aromatic compounds, fundamentally altering the composition of the distillate from its source. Non-volatile substances such as pigments, sugars, and salts remained behind in the still. As a result, the taste of the distillate was often quite unlike that of the original source.

As described in the 1728 edition of ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'', the following method was used to distill brandy:&lt;ref name=&quot;cyclo&quot;&gt;{{1728|title=Brandy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A [[alembic|cucurbit]] was filled half full of the liquor from which brandy was to be drawn and then raised with a little fire until about one-sixth part was distilled, or until that which falls into the receiver was entirely flammable. This liquor, distilled only once, was called ''spirit of wine'' or ''brandy''. Purified by another distillation (or several more), this was then called ''spirit of wine rectified''. The second distillation was made in ''[[balneo mariae]]'' and in a glass cucurbit, and the liquor was distilled to about one half the quantity. This was further rectified as long as the operator thought necessary to produce brandy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To shorten these several distillations, which were long and troublesome, a chemical instrument was invented that reduced them to a single distillation. To test the purity of the rectified spirit of wine, a portion was ignited. If the entire contents were consumed by a fire without leaving any impurities behind, then the liquor was good. Another, better test involved putting a little [[gunpowder]] in the bottom of the spirit. If the gunpowder could ignite after the spirit was consumed by fire, then the liquor was good.&lt;ref name=&quot;cyclo&quot;/&gt;

As most brandies have been distilled from grapes, the regions of the world producing excellent brandies have roughly paralleled those areas producing grapes for viniculture. At the end of the 19th century, the western European markets, including by extension their overseas empires, were dominated by French and Spanish brandies and eastern Europe was dominated by brandies from the [[Black Sea Region|Black Sea region]], including [[Bulgaria]], the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]], and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. In 1884, [[David Sarajishvili]] [[Sarajishvili|founded his brandy factory]] in Tbilisi, Georgia, a crossroads for Turkish, Central Asian, and Persian trade routes and a part of the Russian Empire at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iwinetc.com/news/sarajishvili-brandy-made-georgia/ |title=Sarajishvili Brandy Made in Georgia |publisher=International Wine Tourism Conference |date=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
Except for few major producers, brandy production and consumption tend to have a regional character and thus production methods significantly vary. Wine brandy is produced from a variety of grape cultivars. A special selection of cultivars, providing distinct aroma and character, is used for high-quality brandies, while cheaper ones are made from whichever wine is available.&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Food Fermentations |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oKDNAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA250 |chapter=5.2. Brandy |pages=249‚Äì252 |editor=Charles W. Bamforth, Robert E. Ward |year=2014 |isbn=9780199742707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brandy is made from so-called [[base wine]], which significantly differs from regular table wines. It is made from early grapes in order to achieve higher acid concentration and lower sugar levels. Base wine generally contains smaller amount (up to 20&amp;nbsp;mg/l) of [[sulphur]] than regular wines, as it creates undesired [[copper(II) sulfate]] in reaction with copper in the [[pot still]]s. The yeast sediment produced during the fermentation may or may not be kept in the wine, depending on the brandy style.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;

Brandy is distilled from the base wine in two phases. In the first, large part of water and solids is removed from the base, obtaining so-called &quot;low wine&quot;, basically a concentrated wine with 28‚Äì30% ABV. In the second stage, low wine is distilled into brandy. The liquid exits the pot still in three phases, referred to as the &quot;heads&quot;, &quot;heart&quot; and &quot;tails&quot; respectively. The first part, the &quot;head,&quot; has an alcohol concentration of about 83% (166 US proof) and an unpleasant odour. The weak portion on the end, &quot;tail&quot;, is discarded along with the head, and they are generally mixed with another batch of low wine, thereby entering the distillation cycle again. The middle heart fraction, richest in aromas and flavours, is preserved for later maturation.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;

Distillation does not simply enhance the alcohol content of wine. The heat under which the product is distilled and the material of the still (usually copper) cause chemical reactions to take place during distillation. This leads to the formation of numerous new [[volatile organic compound|volatile]] aroma components, changes in relative amounts of aroma components in the wine, and the [[hydrolysis]] of components such as esters.

Brandy is usually produced in [[pot still]]s ([[batch distillation]]), but the [[column still]] can also be used for [[continuous distillation]]. Distillate obtained in this manner has a higher alcohol concentration (approximately 90% ABV) and is less aromatic. Choice of the apparatus depends on the style of brandy produced.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt; [[Cognac]] and [[South African brandy]] are examples of brandy produced in batches&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt; while many American brandies use [[fractional distillation]] in column stills.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Aging===
After distillation, the unaged brandy is placed into [[oak barrel]]s to mature. Usually, brandies with a natural golden or brown colour are aged in [[oak]] [[aging barrel|casks]] (single-barrel aging). Some brandies, particularly those from Spain, are aged using the [[solera]] system, where the producer changes the barrel each year. After a period of aging, which depends on the style, class and legal requirements, the mature brandy is mixed with distilled water to reduce alcohol concentration and bottled. Some brandies have caramel colour and sugar added to simulate the appearance of barrel aging.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;

==Consumption==
===Serving===
Brandy is traditionally served at room temperature ([[straight up (bartending)|neat]]) from a [[snifter]], a [[wine glass]] or a [[beer glassware#Tulip glass|tulip glass]]. When drunk at room temperature, it is often slightly warmed by holding the glass cupped in the palm or by gentle heating. Excessive heating of brandy may cause the alcohol vapour to become too strong, causing its aroma to become overpowering. Brandy drinkers who like their brandy warmed may ask for the glass to be heated before the brandy is poured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/1998/03/14/feat_side1.html |title=Cognac Q&amp;A |publisher=Forbes magazine |date=14 March 1998 |author=Charles Dubow }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brandy may be added to other beverages to make several popular [[cocktail]]s; these include the [[Brandy Sour (Cyprus)|Brandy Sour]], the [[Brandy Alexander]], the [[Sidecar (cocktail)|Sidecar]], the [[Brandy Daisy]], and the [[Old fashioned (cocktail)|Brandy Old Fashioned]].

===Culinary uses===
Brandy is a common [[deglazing (cooking)|deglazing]] liquid used in making [[pan sauce]]s for steak and other meat. It is used to create a more intense flavour in some soups, notably onion soup.

In English Christmas cooking, brandy is a common flavouring in traditional foods such as Christmas cake, brandy butter, and Christmas pudding. It is also commonly used in drinks such as mulled wine, drunk during the festive season.

Brandy is used to [[flamb√©]] dishes such as [[cr√™pe Suzette]] and [[cherries jubilee]] while serving.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; Brandy is traditionally poured over [[Christmas pudding]] and set alight. The use of flamb√© can retain as much as 75% of the alcohol in the brandy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McGee |first1=Harold |title=On Food and Cooking |date=23 November 2004 |isbn=9780684800011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology and legal definitions==
The term ''brandy'' is a shortening of ''brandywine'', which was derived from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word ''brandewijn'', itself derived from ''gebrande wijn'', which literally means &quot;burned wine&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;oed&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989|location=Oxford, England}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Germany, the term is ''Branntwein'' or ''Weinbrand'' and means exactly the same thing.

In the general colloquial usage of the term, brandy may also be made from [[pomace]] and from fermented fruit other than grapes.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot; /&gt;

If a beverage comes from a particular fruit (or multiple fruits) other than exclusively grapes, or from the [[must]] of such fruit, it may be referred to as a &quot;[[fruit brandy]]&quot; or &quot;fruit spirit&quot; or named using the specific fruit, such as &quot;peach brandy&quot;, rather than just generically as &quot;brandy&quot;. If pomace is the raw material, the beverage may be called &quot;[[pomace brandy]]&quot;, &quot;marc brandy&quot;, &quot;grape marc&quot;, &quot;fruit marc spirit&quot;, or &quot;grape marc spirit&quot;; &quot;marc&quot; being the pulp residue after the juice has been pressed from the fruit.

Grape pomace brandy may be designated as &quot;[[grappa]]&quot; or &quot;grappa brandy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;USFCR5.22&quot; /&gt; Apple brandy may be referred to as &quot;applejack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;USFCR5.22&quot; /&gt; There is also a product called &quot;grain brandy&quot; that is made from grain spirits.&lt;ref&gt;EC regulation No. 110/2008, Annex II, nn 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within particular jurisdictions, there are specific regulatory requirements regarding the labelling of products identified as brandy. For example:

* In the [[European Union]], there are regulations&lt;ref name = EUOnTheDefinition&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:039:0016:0054:EN:PDF |title=Regulation (EC) No. 110/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2008 &quot;on the definition, description, presentation, labelling and the protection of spirit drinks&quot; |accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that require products labelled as brandy, except &quot;grain brandy&quot;, to be produced exclusively from the distillation or redistillation of grape-based wine or grape-based &quot;wine fortified for distillation&quot;  and aged a minimum of six months in oak.&lt;ref&gt;EC regulation No. 110/2008, Annex II, nn 3‚Äì9u.&lt;/ref&gt; Alcoholic beverages imported to the EU from the United States or other non-EU states can be sold within the European Union using labels that refer to them as &quot;fruit brandy&quot; or &quot;pomace brandy&quot;, but such a label cannot be used in the EU for products produced in an EU-member state.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}
* In the US, brandy that has been produced from other than grape wine must be labelled with a clarifying description of the type of brandy production such as &quot;peach brandy&quot;, &quot;fruit brandy&quot;, &quot;dried fruit brandy&quot;, or &quot;pomace brandy&quot;, and brandy that has not been aged in oak for at least two years must be labelled as &quot;immature&quot;.&lt;ref name=USFCR5.22&gt;{{cite web | url = http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2008/aprqtr/pdf/27cfr5.22.pdf | title = Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits, Title 27 Code of Federal Regulations, Pt. 5.22 | accessdate = 3 March 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081217025920/http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2008/aprqtr/pdf/27cfr5.22.pdf | archive-date = 17 December 2008 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Canada, the regulations regarding naming conventions for brandy are similar to those of the US (provisions B.02.050‚Äì061). According to the Canadian food and drug regulations, Brandy shall be a potable alcoholic distillate, or a mixture of potable alcoholic distillates, obtained by the distillation of wine. The minimum specified aging period is six months in wood, although not necessarily oak (provision B.02.061.2). Caramel, fruit, other botanical substances, flavourings, and flavouring preparations may also be included in a product called brandy (provisions B.02.050‚Äì059).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/C.R.C.-c.870/FullText.html |title=Food and Drug Regulations, C.R.C., c. 870 |publisher=Laws.justice.gc.ca |accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Branch&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._870/page-30.html#h-57|title=Consolidated federal laws of canada, Food and Drug Regulations|last=Branch|first=Legislative Services|website=laws.justice.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the European Union, the German term ''Weinbrand'' is legally equivalent to the English term &quot;brandy&quot;, but outside the [[German-speaking countries]] it is particularly used to designate brandy from [[Austria]] and [[Germany]].

==Varieties and brands==

*[[Ararat (brandy)|Armenian brandy]] has been produced since 1887 and comes from the [[Ararat plain]] in the southern part of Armenia.  Bottles on the market are aged anywhere from 3 to 20 years.
* [[Armagnac]] is made from grapes of the [[Armagnac (province)|Armagnac region]] in the southwest of France, Gers, Landes and Lot-et-Garonne. It is single-continuous distilled in a copper still and aged in oak casks from [[Gascony]] or [[Limousin (region)|Limousin]] or from the renowned [[Tron√ßais Forest]] in [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergne]]. Armagnac was the first distilled spirit in France. Its usage was first mentioned in 1310 by Vital Du Four in a book of medicine recipes. Armagnacs have a specificity: they offer [[vintage]] qualities. Popular brands are [[Darroze]], [[Baron de Sigognac]], [[Larressingle]], [[Delord]], [[Laubade]], [[G√©las]] and [[Janneau]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}
* [[Cognac]] comes from the [[Cognac, France|Cognac region]] of France,&lt;ref name=eb /&gt; and is double distilled using pot stills.

The European Union and some other countries legally enforce the use of &quot;Cognac&quot; as the exclusive name for brandy produced and distilled in the Cognac area of France, and the name &quot;Armagnac&quot; for brandy from the Gascony area of France. Both must also be made using traditional techniques. Since these are considered &quot;protected designation of origin&quot;, a brandy made elsewhere may not be called Cognac in these jurisdictions, even if made in an identical manner.

* Italian [[Stravecchio]] has been produced since the 1700s in the North of Italy, especially in [[Emilia-Romagna]] and [[Veneto]], using grapes popular in winemaking such as [[Sangiovese]] and [[Grignolino]]. Colour, texture and finish are most resembling those of their French and Spanish counterparts. Most popular brands are Vecchia Romagna, Stravecchio Branca and Stock 84. Northern Italy is also noted since the Middle Ages for another type of wine spirit, [[Grappa]], which is generally colourless but has some top-shelf varieties called ''barrique'' which are aged in oak casks and achieve the same caramel colour as regular brandies. There is a vast production of Stravecchios and Grappas in Italy, with more than 600 large, medium or small distilleries in operation. [[Ticino]], in Italian speaking [[Switzerland]], is also allowed to produce pomace brandy under the name of Grappa.

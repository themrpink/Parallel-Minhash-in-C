[[Van Vihar National Park]] is a national park in central India. It is located in Bhopal, the capital city of Madhya Pradesh. Declared a national park in 1979, it covers an area of about 4.45 km2. Although it has the status of a national park, Van Vihar is developed and managed as a modern zoological park, following the guidelines of the Central Zoo Authority. The animals are kept in their near natural habitat. Most of the animals are either orphaned brought from various parts of the state or those, which are exchanged from other zoos. No animal is deliberately captured from the forest.[1] Van Vihar is unique because it allows easy access to the visitors through a road passing through the park, security of animals assured from poachers by building trenches and walls, chain-link fence and by providing natural habitat to the animals.

Pyongyang is considered one of the oldest cities in Korea.&lt;ref name=&quot;EBPyongyang&quot;/&gt; It was the capital of two ancient Korean kingdoms, including [[Gojoseon]] and [[Goguryeo]], and served as the secondary capital of [[Goryeo]]. Much of the city was destroyed during the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], but it was revived [[Korea under Japanese rule|under Japanese rule]] and became an industrial center. Following the establishment of North Korea in 1948, Pyongyang became its ''de facto'' capital. The city was again devastated during the [[Korean War]], but was quickly rebuilt after the war with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] assistance.

Pyongyang is the political, industrial and transport center of North Korea. It is home to North Korea's major [[Government of North Korea|government institutions]], as well as the ruling [[Workers' Party of Korea]].

After [[Death and state funeral of Kim Il-sung|Kim Il-sung's death]] in 1994, some members of [[Kim Jong-il]]'s faction proposed changing the name of Pyongyang to &quot;Kim Il-sung City&quot; ({{korean|hangul=김일성시|hanja=金日成市|links-no}}), but others suggested that North Korea should begin calling Seoul &quot;Kim Il-sung City&quot; instead and grant Pyongyang the moniker &quot;Kim Jong-il City&quot;.

==Prehistory==
In 1955, archaeologists excavated evidence of prehistoric dwellings in a large ancient village in the Pyongyang area, called Kŭmtan-ni, dating to the [[Jeulmun pottery period|Jeulmun]] and [[Mumun pottery period|Mumun]] pottery periods.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage. 2001. Geumtan-ri. ''Hanguk Gogohak Sajeon'' [Dictionary of Korean Archaeology], pp. 148–149. NRICH, Seoul. {{ISBN|89-5508-025-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Koreans associate Pyongyang with the [[Korean mythology|mythological]] city of &quot;[[Asadal]]&quot; ({{korean|hangul=아사달|hanja=阿斯達}}), or ''[[Wanggeom-seong]]'' ({{korean|hangul=왕검성|hanja=王儉城|links-no}}), the first second millennium BC capital of [[Gojoseon]] (&quot;Old Joseon&quot;) according to Korean historiographies beginning with the 13th-century ''[[Samgungnyusa]]''.

Historians{{who|date=April 2018}} deny this claim because earlier Chinese historiographical works such as the ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'', ''[[Classic of Mountains and Seas]]'', ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', and ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'', mention a much later &quot;Joseon&quot;.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} The connection between the two therefore may have been asserted by North Korea for the use of propaganda.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Nevertheless, Pyongyang became a major city in old Joseon.

==History==
[[File:Tomb of King Tongmyong, Pyongyang, North Korea.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Tomb of King Tongmyong]]]]
Korean mythology asserts that Pyongyang was founded in 1122 BC on the site of the capital of the legendary king [[Dangun]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EBPyongyang&quot;/&gt; [[Wanggeom-seong]], which was in the location of Pyongyang, became the capital of [[Gojoseon]] from 194 to 108 BC. It fell in the [[Han conquest of Gojoseon]] in 108 BC. [[Emperor Wu of Han]] ordered four commanderies be set up, with [[Lelang Commandery]] in the center and its capital established as &quot;{{lang|zh|樂浪}}&quot; ([[Old Chinese]]: *[r]ˤawk*[r]ˤaŋ,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authorlink=William H. Baxter|last1=Baxter |first1=William H. |authorlink2=Laurent Sagart |last2=Sagart |first2=Laurent |title=Baxter-Sagart Old Chinese reconstruction (Version 1.00) |url=http://crlao.ehess.fr/document.php?id=1217 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814024311/http://crlao.ehess.fr/document.php?id=1217 |archivedate=14 August 2011 |accessdate=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Standard Chinese]]: {{zh|p=Lèlàng}}, {{korean|hangul=낙랑|hanja=樂浪}}). Several archaeological findings from the later, [[Eastern Han]] (20–220 AD) period in the Pyeongyang area seems to suggest that Han forces later launched brief incursions around these parts.

The area around the city was called Nanglang during the early [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms period]]. As the capital of Nanglang ({{korean|hangul=낙랑국|hanja=樂浪國}}),{{Efn | Nanglang-state is different from Lelang Commandery.}} Pyeongyang remained an important commercial and cultural outpost after the Lelang Commandery was destroyed by an expanding [[Goguryeo]] in 313.

Goguryeo moved its capital there in 427. According to [[Christopher I. Beckwith|Christopher Beckwith]], ''Pyongyang'' is the [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean reading]] of the name they gave it in their language: ''Piarna'', or &quot;level land&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Christopher I. |last=Beckwith |title=Empires of the Silk Road: A History of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the Present | publisher=Princeton University Press | year =2009 |isbn=978-0-691-13589-2 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 668, Pyongyang became the capital of the [[Protectorate General to Pacify the East]] established by the [[Tang dynasty]] of China. However, by 676, it was taken by [[Silla]], but left on the border between Silla and [[Balhae]]. Pyongyang was left abandoned during the [[Later Silla]] period, until it was recovered by [[Taejo of Goryeo|Wang Geon]] and decreed as the Western Capital of [[Goryeo]]. During the [[Joseon]] period, it became the provincial capital of [[Pyeongan Province]].

During the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)]], Pyongyang was captured by the Japanese and held until they were defeated in the [[Siege of Pyongyang (1593)|Siege of Pyongyang]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EBPyongyang&quot;/&gt; Later in the 17th century, it became temporarily occupied during the [[Qing invasion of Joseon]] until peace arrangements were made between Korea and Qing China. While the invasions made Koreans suspicious of foreigners, the influence of [[Christianity]] began to grow after the country opened itself up to foreigners in the 16th century. Pyongyang became the base of Christian expansion in Korea, and by 1880 it had more than 100 churches and more Protestant missionaries than any other Asian city.&lt;ref name=&quot;EBPyongyang&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/484693/Pyongyang|title=Pyongyang|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

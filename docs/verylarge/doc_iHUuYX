Critiques of globalization generally stem from discussions surrounding the impact of such processes on the planet as well as the human costs.

In 2004, Philip Gordon stated that &quot;a clear majority of Europeans believe that globalization can enrich their lives, while believing the European Union can help them take advantage of globalization's benefits while shielding them from its negative effects.&quot; The main opposition consisted of socialists, environmental groups, and nationalists. Residents of the EU did not appear to feel threatened by globalization in 2004. The EU job market was more stable and workers were less likely to accept wage/benefit cuts. Social spending was much higher than in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Philip. 2004.

Fiss, ''et al.'', surveyed US opinion in 1993. Their survey showed that, in 1993, more than 40% of respondents were unfamiliar with the concept of globalization. When the survey was repeated in 1998, 89% of the respondents had a polarized view of globalization as being either good or bad. At the same time, discourse on globalization, which began in the financial community before shifting to a heated debate between proponents and disenchanted students and workers. Polarization increased dramatically after the establishment of the WTO in 1995; this event and subsequent protests led to a large-scale anti-globalization movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fiss 2005&quot;/&gt;
Initially, college educated workers were likely to support globalization. Less educated workers, who were more likely to compete with immigrants and workers in developing countries, tended to be opponents. The situation changed after the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|financial crisis of 2007]]. According to a 1997 poll 58% of college graduates said globalization had been good for the US. By 2008 only 33% thought it was good. Respondents with high school education also became more opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121623686919059307|title=The Declining Value Of Your College Degree|last=Ip|first=Greg|date=2008-07-18|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=2019-11-29|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200229022054/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121623686919059307|archive-date=29 February 2020|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Takenaka Heizo and Chida Ryokichi, {{as of|1998|lc=y}} there was a perception in Japan that the economy was &quot;Small and Frail&quot;. However, Japan was resource-poor and used exports to pay for its raw materials. Anxiety over their position caused terms such as ''[[internationalization]]'' and ''globalization'' to enter everyday language. However, Japanese tradition was to be as self-sufficient as possible, particularly in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=http://www.jcie.org/researchpdfs/DomAdjst/takenaka-chida.pdf|title=Domestic Adjustments to Globalization|last1=Heizo|first1=Takenaka|last2=Ryokichi|first2=Chida|publisher=Japan Center for International Exchange|year=1998|isbn=4-88907-012-5|editor-last=Morrison|editor-first=Charles E.|location=Tokyo|pages=76–102|chapter=Japan|oclc=40657196|editor-last2=Soesastro|editor-first2=Hadi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many in developing countries see globalization as a positive force that lifts them out of poverty.&lt;ref name=&quot;bhagwati&quot;/&gt; Those opposing globalization typically combine environmental concerns with nationalism.

In the book ''[[The End of Poverty]]'', Jeffrey Sachs discusses how many factors can affect a country's ability to enter the world market, including government [[Political corruption|corruption]]; legal and social disparities based on gender, ethnicity, or caste; diseases such as [[AIDS]] and [[malaria]]; lack of infrastructure (including transportation, communications, health, and trade); unstable political landscapes; [[protectionism]]; and geographic barriers.&lt;ref name=&quot;The End of Poverty&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/endofpovertyecon00sach|title=The End of Poverty|last=Sachs|first=Jeffrey|publisher=Penguin Press|year=2005|isbn=978-1-59420-045-8|location=New York|oclc=57243168|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jagdish Bhagwati]], a former adviser to the U.N. on globalization, holds that, although there are obvious problems with overly rapid development, globalization is a very positive force that lifts countries out of poverty by causing a virtuous economic cycle associated with faster economic growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;bhagwati&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/indefenseofglob00bhag|title=In Defense of Globalization|last=Bhagwati|first=Jagdish|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-19-533093-9|location=Oxford; New York|oclc=719371219|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, economic growth does not necessarily mean a reduction in poverty; in fact, the two can coexist.

The flow of migrants to advanced economies has been claimed to provide a means through which global wages converge. An IMF study noted a potential for skills to be transferred back to developing countries as wages in those a countries rise.&lt;ref name=&quot;12th April 2000: IMF Publications&quot;/&gt; Lastly, the dissemination of knowledge has been an integral aspect of globalization.

There has been a rapid economic growth in Asia after embracing [[market orientation]]-based economic policies that encourage private [[property rights]], free enterprise and competition. In particular, in East Asian developing countries, [[GDP]] per head rose at 5.9% a year from 1975 to 2001 (according to 2003 [[Human Development Report]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2003|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/hdr03_complete.pdf|title=Human Development Report 2003|publisher=UNDP|accessdate=6 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130418072827/http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/hdr03_complete.pdf|archive-date=18 April 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; of UNDP). Like this, the British economic journalist [[Martin Wolf]] says that incomes of poor developing countries, with more than half the world's population, grew substantially faster than those of the world's richest countries that remained relatively stable in its growth, leading to reduced international inequality and the incidence of poverty.

Certain demographic changes in the developing world after active [[economic liberalization]] and international integration resulted in rising general welfare and, hence, reduced inequality. According to Wolf, in the developing world as a whole, life expectancy rose by four months each year after 1970 and infant mortality rate declined from 107 per thousand in 1970 to 58 in 2000 due to improvements in [[standards of living]] and health conditions. Also, adult literacy in developing countries rose from 53% in 1970 to 74% in 1998 and much lower illiteracy rate among the young guarantees that rates will continue to fall as time passes. Furthermore, the reduction in [[fertility rate]] in the developing world as a whole from 4.1 births per woman in 1980 to 2.8 in 2000 indicates improved education level of women on fertility, and control of fewer children with more parental attention and investment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolf2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url= https://archive.org/details/whyglobalization00wolf|title= Why Globalization Works|publisher= [[Yale University Press]]|author= Martin Wolf|year= 2004|isbn= 978-0-300-10252-9|accessdate= 6 April 2013|df= dmy-all}}{{dead link|date=January 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, more prosperous and educated parents with fewer children have chosen to withdraw their children from the labor force to give them opportunities to be educated at school improving the issue of [[child labor]]. Thus, despite seemingly unequal [[distribution of income]] within these developing countries, their economic growth and development have brought about improved standards of living and welfare for the population as a whole.

Per capita [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) growth among post-1980 globalizing countries accelerated from 1.4 percent a year in the 1960s and 2.9 percent a year in the 1970s to 3.5 percent in the 1980s and 5.0 percent in the 1990s. This acceleration in growth seems even more remarkable given that the rich countries saw steady declines in growth from a high of 4.7 percent in the 1960s to 2.2 percent in the 1990s. Also, the non-globalizing developing countries seem to fare worse than the globalizers, with the former's annual growth rates falling from highs of 3.3 percent during the 1970s to only 1.4 percent during the 1990s. This rapid growth among the globalizers is not simply due to the strong performances of China and India in the 1980s and 1990s—18 out of the 24 globalizers experienced increases in growth, many of them quite substantial.&lt;ref name=&quot;DDollar&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Dollar, David|author2=Kraay, Aart|title=Trade, Growth, and Poverty|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2001/09/dollar.htm|work=Finance and Development|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=6 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111124849/http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2001/09/dollar.htm|archive-date=11 January 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The globalization of the late 20th and early 21st centuries has led to the resurfacing of the idea that the growth of economic [[interdependence]] promotes peace.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{cite web |title=Globalisation promotes peace |first1=Ju Hyun |last1=Pyun |first2=Jong-Wha |last2=Lee |date=21 March 2009 |url=http://www.voxeu.org/article/globalisation-promotes-peace |access-date=25 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025034256/http://www.voxeu.org/article/globalisation-promotes-peace |archive-date=25 October 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea had been very powerful during the globalization of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and was a central doctrine of [[classical liberals]] of that era, such as the young [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883–1946).&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Roy Harrod]], ''[[The Life of John Maynard Keynes]]'', Macmillan, 1951; [[Donald Markwell]], ''[[John Maynard Keynes]] and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006. Keynes had colourfully described the globalization before World War I in ''The Economic Consequences of the Peace'', Macmillan, 1919, chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization allows corporations to [[outsource]] manufacturing and service jobs from high cost locations, creating economic opportunities with the most competitive wages and worker benefits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuruvilla 2008 39–72&quot;/&gt; Critics of globalization say that it disadvantages poorer countries. While it is true that free trade encourages globalization among countries, some countries try to protect their domestic suppliers. The main export of poorer countries is usually [[agricultural production]]s. Larger countries often subsidize their [[Agricultural subsidy|farmers]] (e.g., the EU's [[Common Agricultural Policy]]), which lowers the market price for foreign crops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurst E.

===Global democracy===
{{Main|Democratic globalization}}

'''Democratic globalization''' is a movement towards an institutional system of global [[democracy]] that would give world citizens a say in political organizations. This would, in their view, bypass nation-states, corporate oligopolies, ideological [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGO), political cults and mafias.  One of its most prolific proponents is the British political thinker [[David Held]]. Advocates of [[democratic globalization]] argue that economic expansion and development should be the first phase of democratic globalization, which is to be followed by a phase of building [[International political economy|global political institutions]]. Dr. [[Francesco Stipo]], Director of the United States Association of the [[Club of Rome]], advocates unifying nations under a [[world government]], suggesting that it &quot;should reflect the political and economic balances of world nations. A world confederation would not supersede the authority of the State governments but rather complement it, as both the States and the world authority would have power within their sphere of competence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usacor.org/archive/index.html |title=USACOR.org |publisher=USACOR.org |date=28 July 2009 |accessdate=31 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520180352/http://www.usacor.org/archive/index.html |archive-date=20 May 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senator]] [[Douglas Roche]], [[Order of Canada|O.C.]], viewed globalization as inevitable and advocated creating institutions such as a [[direct election|directly elected]] [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] to exercise oversight over unelected international bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roche|first=Douglas|title=The Case for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly|url=http://www.wfm-igp.org/site/files/Roche_UN_Parliamentary_Assembly_2002.pdf|publisher=The World Federalist Movement – Institute for Global Policy|accessdate=28 May 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531054746/http://www.wfm-igp.org/site/files/Roche_UN_Parliamentary_Assembly_2002.pdf|archivedate=31 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global civics===
{{Main|Global civics|Multiculturalism}}
{{See also|Global citizenship}}

Global civics suggests that [[civics]] can be understood, in a global sense, as a [[social contract]] between [[Global citizenship|global citizens]] in the age of interdependence and interaction. The disseminators of the concept define it as the notion that we have certain rights and responsibilities towards each other by the mere fact of being human on Earth.&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altinay |first=Hakan |title=The Case for Global Civics |journal=Global Economy and Development at Brookings |year=2010 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603104201/http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |archivedate=3 June 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World citizen]] has a variety of similar meanings, often referring to a person who disapproves of traditional [[geopolitical]] divisions derived from national [[citizenship]].

Baha'i-inspired author Meyjes, while favoring the single world community and emergent global consciousness, warns of globalization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| chapter = Language and Universalization: a ‘Linguistic Ecology’ Reading of Bahá’í Writ | first = Gregory Paul | last = Meyjes (also: Posthumus Meyjes) | title = The Journal of Bahá'í Studies | publisher = Association for Bahá’í Studies | series = | volume =Volume IX (1) | year =1999 | location = Ottawa | pages = 51–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a cloak for an expeditious economic, social, and cultural Anglo-dominance that is insufficiently inclusive to inform the emergence of an optimal world civilization. He proposes a process of &quot;[[Universalism#Non-religious Universalism|universalization]]&quot; as an alternative.

[[Cosmopolitanism]] is the proposal that all human ethnic groups belong to a single [[community]] based on a shared [[morality]]. A person who adheres to the idea of cosmopolitanism in any of its forms is called a cosmopolitan or cosmopolite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosmopolitan|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cosmopolitan?s=t|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=7 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102020627/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cosmopolitan?s=t|archive-date=2 January 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cosmopolitan community might be based on an inclusive morality, a shared economic relationship, or a political structure that encompasses different nations. The cosmopolitan community is one in which individuals from different places (e.g. nation-states) form relationships based on mutual respect. For instance, [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] suggests the possibility of a cosmopolitan community in which individuals from varying locations (physical, economic, etc.) enter relationships of mutual respect despite their differing beliefs (religious, political, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Kwame Anthony Appiah, &quot;Cosmopolitan Patriots,&quot; Critical Inquiry 23, no. 3 (Spring, 1997): 617–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Powers (17 September 1992) The Global Village: Transformations in World Life and Media in the 21st century .

===International cooperation===
[[File:Obama and Medvedev sign Prague Treaty 2010.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Barack Obama]] and [[Dmitry Medvedev]] after signing the [[New START]] treaty in Prague, 2010]]
'''Military cooperation'''&amp;nbsp;– Past examples of international cooperation exist. One example is the security cooperation between the United States and the former Soviet Union after the end of the Cold War, which astonished international society. Arms control and disarmament agreements, including the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (see [[START I]], [[START II]], [[START III]], and [[New START]]) and the establishment of [[NATO]]'s Partnership for Peace, the Russia NATO Council, and the [[G8]] Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, constitute concrete initiatives of arms control and de-nuclearization. The US–Russian cooperation was further strengthened by anti-terrorism agreements enacted in the wake of 9/11.&lt;ref name=&quot;globalpolicyjournal1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/brookings-audit/international-cooperation-stepping-stone-world-government|title=International cooperation as a stepping-stone to a world government|publisher=Global Policy Journal|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203072547/http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/brookings-audit/international-cooperation-stepping-stone-world-government|archive-date=3 December 2013|accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental cooperation'''&amp;nbsp;– One of the biggest successes of environmental cooperation has been the agreement to reduce chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) emissions, as specified in the [[Montreal Protocol]], in order to stop ozone depletion. The most recent debate around nuclear energy and the non-alternative coal-burning power plants constitutes one more consensus on what not to do. Thirdly, significant achievements in IC can be observed through development studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;globalpolicyjournal1&quot;/&gt;

'''Economic cooperation''' – One of the biggest challenges in 2019 with globalization is that many believe the progress made in the past decades are now back tracking. The back tracking of globalization has coined the term &quot;Slobalization.&quot; Slobalization is a new, slower pattern of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title=Archived copy|id={{ProQuest|2171135679}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy'', [[Christopher Lasch]] analyzes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/the-treachery-of-the-lites-elite-sense-of-irresponsibility-1610879.html |title=The treachery of the lites Elite sense of irresponsibility |newspaper=The Independent |date=1995-03-10 |accessdate=2018-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827124832/http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/the-treachery-of-the-lites-elite-sense-of-irresponsibility-1610879.html |archive-date=27 August 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; the widening gap between the top and bottom of the social composition in the United States. For him, our epoch is determined by a social phenomenon: the revolt of the elites, in reference to ''The revolt of the masses'' (1929) of the Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset. According to Lasch, the new elites, i.e. those who are in the top 20% in terms of income, through globalization which allows total mobility of capital, no longer live in the same world as their fellow-citizens. In this, they oppose the old bourgeoisie of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which was constrained by its spatial stability to a minimum of rooting and civic obligations. Globalization, according to the sociologist, has turned elites into tourists in their own countries. The denationalization of business enterprise tends to produce a class who see themselves as &quot;world citizens, but without accepting ... any of the obligations that citizenship in a polity normally implies&quot;. Their ties to an international culture of work, leisure, information – make many of them deeply indifferent to the prospect of national decline. Instead of financing public services and the public treasury, new elites are investing their money in improving their voluntary ghettos: private schools in their residential neighborhoods, private police, garbage collection systems. They have &quot;withdrawn from common life&quot;.
Composed of those who control the international flows of capital and information, who preside over philanthropic foundations and institutions of higher education, manage the instruments of cultural production and thus fix the terms of public debate. So, the political debate is limited mainly to the dominant classes and political ideologies lose all contact with the concerns of the ordinary citizen. The result of this is that no one has a likely solution to these problems and that there are furious ideological battles on related issues.
However, they remain protected from the problems affecting the working classes: the decline of industrial activity, the resulting loss of employment, the decline of the middle class, increasing the number of the poor, the rising crime rate, growing drug trafficking, the urban crisis.

D.A. Snow et al. contend that the [[anti-globalization movement]] is an example of a [[new social movement]], which uses tactics that are unique and use different resources than previously used before in other social movements.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, D.A., Soule, S.A., &amp; Kriesi, H. (2004). The Blackwell companion to social movements. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub..&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most infamous tactics of the movement is the [[Battle of Seattle (1999)|Battle of Seattle]] in 1999, where there were protests against the World Trade Organization's Third Ministerial Meeting. All over the world, the movement has held protests outside meetings of institutions such as the WTO, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the World Economic Forum, and the Group of Eight (G8).&lt;ref name=&quot;stwr.org&quot;/&gt; Within the Seattle demonstrations the protesters that participated used both creative and violent tactics to gain the attention towards the issue of globalization.

===Opposition to capital market integration===
{{Main|Anti-capitalist movements}}
[[File:Worldbank protest jakarta.jpg|thumb|World Bank Protester, [[Jakarta]], Indonesia]]

Capital markets have to do with raising and investing money in various human enterprises.  Increasing integration of these [[financial market]]s between countries leads to the emergence of a global capital marketplace or a single world market. In the long run, increased movement of capital between countries tends to favor owners of capital more than any other group; in the short run, owners and workers in specific sectors in capital-exporting countries bear much of the burden of adjusting to increased movement of capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Invested Interests: The Politics of National Economic Policies in a World of Global Finance|last=Frieden|first=Jeffry A.|journal=[[International Organization]]|issn=1531-5088|volume=45|issue=4|year=1991|pages=425–51|doi=10.1017/s0020818300033178|jstor=2706944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those opposed to capital market integration on the basis of [[human rights]] issues are especially disturbed{{According to whom|date=March 2020}} by the various abuses which they think are perpetuated by global and international institutions that, they say, promote [[neoliberalism]] without regard to ethical standards. Common targets include the [[World Bank]] (WB), [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and [[free trade]] treaties like the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA), the [[Multilateral Agreement on Investment]] (MAI) and the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]] (GATS). In light of the economic gap between rich and poor countries, movement adherents claim free trade without measures in place to protect the under-capitalized will contribute only to the strengthening the power of industrialized nations (often termed the &quot;North&quot; in opposition to the developing world's &quot;South&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.heritage.org/trade/commentary/how-tariffs-and-regressive-trade-policies-hurt-the-poor|title=How Tariffs and Regressive Trade Policies Hurt the Poor|last=Kolas|first=Logan|website=The Heritage Foundation|language=en|access-date=2019-03-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330093705/https://www.heritage.org/trade/commentary/how-tariffs-and-regressive-trade-policies-hurt-the-poor|archive-date=30 March 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2019}}

===Anti-corporatism and anti-consumerism===
{{Main|Anti-corporatism|Anti-consumerism}}

[[Corporatism|Corporatist]] ideology, which privileges the rights of corporations ([[Legal personality|artificial or juridical persons]]) over those of [[natural person]]s, is an underlying factor in the recent rapid expansion of global commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://carnegieendowment.org/2001/09/01/corporatism-goes-global | title=Corporatism Goes Global | author=Ottaway, Marina | journal=Global Governance: A Review of Multilateralism and International Organizations | volume=7 | issue=3 | date=September 2001 | doi=10.1163/19426720-00703006 | access-date=28 August 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903042838/http://carnegieendowment.org/2001/09/01/corporatism-goes-global | archive-date=3 September 2014 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, there have been an increasing number of books ([[Naomi Klein]]'s 2000 ''[[No Logo]]'', for example) and films (''e.g. [[The Corporation (2003 film)|The Corporation]]'' &amp; ''[[Surplus (film)|Surplus]]'') popularizing an [[Anti-corporate activism|anti-corporate]] [[ideology]] to the public.

A related contemporary ideology, [[consumerism]], which encourages the personal acquisition of goods and services, also drives globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Lived effects of the Contemporary Economy: Globalization, Inequality, and Consumer Society. | author=Storper Michael | journal=Public Culture | year=2000 | volume=12 | issue=2 | pages=375–409 | doi=10.1215/08992363-12-2-375| citeseerx=10.1.1.571.5793 | s2cid=53599498 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anti-consumerism is a social movement against equating personal happiness with consumption and the purchase of material possessions.

Social activists hold materialism is connected to [[Big-box store|global retail merchandizing]] and [[supplier convergence]], [[war]], greed, [[anomie]], [[crime]], environmental degradation, and general social [[malaise]] and discontent.

Those involved, however, frequently deny that they are [[anti-globalization]], insisting that they support the globalization of communication and people and oppose only the global expansion of corporate power.&lt;ref&gt;della Porta, D. 2005. &quot;The Social Bases of the Global Justice Movement: Some Theoretical Reflections and Empirical Evidence from the First European Social Forum.&quot; Civil Society and Social Movements Programme Paper No. 21.Geneva: UNRISD (United Nations Research Institute for Social Development).&lt;/ref&gt; The movement is based in the idea of [[social justice]], desiring the creation of a society or institution based on the principles of [[social equality|equality]] and [[solidarity]], the values of human rights, and the dignity of every human being.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2006&quot;&gt;Education and Social Justice By J.

Many nongovernmental organizations have now arisen to fight these inequalities that many in Latin America, Africa and Asia face. A few very popular and well known [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) include: [[War Child (charity)|War Child]], [[Red Cross]], [[Free The Children]] and [[CARE International]]. They often create partnerships where they work towards improving the lives of those who live in developing countries by building schools, fixing infrastructure, cleaning water supplies, purchasing equipment and supplies for hospitals, and other aid efforts.

The economies of the world have [[Development theory|developed]] unevenly, historically, such that entire geographical regions were left mired in poverty and disease while others began to reduce poverty and disease on a wholesale basis. From around 1980 through at least 2011, the GDP gap, while still wide, appeared to be closing and, in some more rapidly [[developing countries]], [[life expectancies]] began to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24835822 | title=How much do you know about the world? | publisher=BBC | date=2013 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Rosling, Hans | work=BBC News | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714222626/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24835822 | archive-date=14 July 2014 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; If we look at the Gini coefficient for world income, since the late 1980s, the gap between some regions has markedly narrowed—between Asia and the advanced economies of the West, for example—but huge gaps remain globally.  Overall equality across humanity, considered as individuals, has improved very little. Within the decade between 2003 and 2013, income inequality grew even in traditionally egalitarian countries like Germany, Sweden and Denmark. With a few exceptions—France, Japan, Spain—the top 10 percent of earners in most advanced economies raced ahead, while the bottom 10 percent fell further behind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stiglitz&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/inequality-is-a-choice/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs | title=Inequality is a Choice | date=13 October 2013 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Stiglits Joseph E. | location=New York Times | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181125162537/https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/inequality-is-a-choice/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs | archive-date=25 November 2018 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2013, 85 multibillionaires had amassed wealth equivalent to all the wealth owned by the poorest half (3.5 billion) of the world's total population of 7 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;WEF2014&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GAC_GlobalAgendaOutlook_2014.pdf | title=Outlook on the Global Agenda 2014 | publisher=World Economic Forum | accessdate=9 July 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210134450/http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GAC_GlobalAgendaOutlook_2014.pdf | archive-date=10 February 2015 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of globalization argue that globalization results in weak [[trade union|labor unions]]: the surplus in cheap labor coupled with an ever-growing number of companies in transition weakened labor unions in high-cost areas. Unions become less effective and workers their enthusiasm for unions when membership begins to decline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurst E. Charles P.41&quot;/&gt; They also cite an increase in the exploitation of [[child labour|child labor]]: countries with weak protections for children are vulnerable to infestation by rogue companies and criminal gangs who exploit them. Examples include [[quarry]]ing, salvage, and farm work as well as trafficking, bondage, forced labor, prostitution and pornography.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edmonds_Pavcni&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pavcnik | first1 = Nina |date=September 2005 | title = Child Labor in the Global Economy | journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–220 | doi = 10.1257/0895330053147895 | last2 = Pavcnik | first2 = Nina | ref = harv| citeseerx = 10.1.1.488.791 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women often participate in the workforce in [[precarious work]], including [[export-oriented employment]].  Evidence suggests that while globalization has expanded women's access to employment, the long-term goal of transforming [[Gender inequality|gender inequalities]] remains unmet and appears unattainable without regulation of capital and a reorientation and expansion of the state's role in funding public goods and providing a social safety net.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Seguino|first1=Stephanie|last2=Grown|first2=Caren|date=November 2006|title=Gender equity and globalization: macroeconomic policy for developing countries|journal=Journal of International Development|volume=18|issue=8|pages=1081–104|doi=10.1002/jid.1295|ref=harv|author-link1=Stephanie Seguino|citeseerx=10.1.1.589.4614}} [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTGENDER/Resources/Seguino_GrownGenderEquityandGlobalizationJID.pdf Pdf version – via the World Bank.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605144218/http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTGENDER/Resources/Seguino_GrownGenderEquityandGlobalizationJID.pdf |date=5 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the intersectionality of gender, race, class, and more remain overlooked when assessing the impact of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, development, and globalization : economics as if all people mattered|last=Lourdes|first=Benería|others=Berik, Günseli, Floro, Maria|isbn=978-0-415-53748-3|edition= Second|location=New York|oclc=903247621|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a study published by the IMF posited that [[neoliberalism]], the ideological backbone of contemporary globalized capitalism, has been &quot;oversold&quot;, with the benefits of neoliberal policies being &quot;fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries&quot; and the costs, most significantly higher income inequality within nations, &quot;hurt the level and sustainability of growth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Foroohar |first=Rana |date=June 3, 2016 |title=Globalization's True Believers Are Having Second Thoughts |url=http://time.com/4356816/neoliberalism-imf-globalization/ |work=TIME |location= |access-date=July 12, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617175511/http://time.com/4356816/neoliberalism-imf-globalization/ |archive-date=17 June 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-global governance===
{{Main|Global governance}}

Beginning in the 1930s, opposition arose to the idea of a world government, as advocated by organizations such as the [[World Federalist Movement]] (WFM). Those who oppose global governance typically do so on objections that the idea is unfeasible, inevitably oppressive, or simply unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Paul. (2006.) ''The Parliament of Man: The Past, Present, and Future of the United Nations.'' New York: Harper Collins. {{ISBN|978-0-375-50165-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, these opponents are wary of the concentration of power or wealth that such governance might represent. Such reasoning dates back to the founding of the [[League of Nations]] and, later, the [[United Nations]].

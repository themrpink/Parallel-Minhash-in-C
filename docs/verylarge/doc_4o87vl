Many of the characteristics that Holst employed — unconventional [[time signatures]], rising and falling scales, [[ostinato]], [[bitonality]] and occasional [[polytonality]] — set him apart from other English composers.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Vaughan Williams remarked that Holst always said in his music what he wished to say, directly and concisely; &quot;He was not afraid of being obvious when the occasion demanded, nor did he hesitate to be remote when remoteness expressed his purpose&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{harvp|Short|1990|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy has surmised that Holst's economy of style was in part a product of the composer's poor health: &quot;the effort of writing it down compelled an artistic economy which some felt was carried too far&quot;.&lt;ref name=OCM/&gt; However, as an experienced instrumentalist and orchestra member, Holst understood music from the standpoint of his players and made sure that, however challenging, their parts were always practicable.&lt;ref name=Short336/&gt; According to his pupil [[Jane Joseph]], Holst fostered in performance &quot;a spirit of practical comradeship&amp;nbsp;... none could know better than he the boredom possible to a professional player, and the music that rendered boredom impossible&quot;.{{sfnp|Gibbs|2000|p=25}}

===Early works===
Although Holst wrote many works—particularly songs—during his student days and early adulthood, almost everything he wrote before 1904 he later classified as derivative &quot;early horrors&quot;.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;&lt;ref name=H661&gt;{{harvp|Holst|1980|p=661}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the composer and critic Colin Matthews recognises even in these apprentice works an &quot;instinctive orchestral flair&quot;.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Of the few pieces from this period which demonstrate some originality, Matthews pinpoints the G minor String Trio of 1894 (unperformed until 1974) as the first underivative work produced by Holst.&lt;ref name=Matthews84&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink= Colin Matthews|last= Matthews|first= Colin|title= Some Unknown Holst| jstor= 961565|work=[[The Musical Times]]|volume= 125|issue= 1695|pages= 269–272|date= May 1984|doi=10.2307/961565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthews and Imogen Holst each highlight the &quot;Elegy&quot; movement in ''The Cotswold Symphony'' (1899–1900) as among the more accomplished of the apprentice works, and Imogen discerns glimpses of her father's real self in the 1899 ''Suite de ballet'' and the ''Ave Maria'' of 1900. She and Matthews have asserted that Holst found his genuine voice in his setting of Whitman's verses, ''The Mystic Trumpeter'' (1904), in which the trumpet calls that characterise Mars in ''The Planets'' are briefly anticipated.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;&lt;ref name=H661/&gt; In this work, Holst first employs the technique of bitonality—the use of two keys simultaneously.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

===Experimental years===
At the beginning of the 20th century, according to Matthews, it appeared that Holst might follow [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]] into late [[Romantic music|Romanticism]]. Instead, as Holst recognised afterwards, his encounter with Purcell's ''Dido and Aeneas'' prompted his searching for a &quot;musical idiom of the English language&quot;;&lt;ref name=GHolstWhit23/&gt; the folksong revival became a further catalyst for Holst to seek inspiration from other sources during the first decade or so of the new century.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

====Indian period====
Holst's interest in Indian mythology, shared by many of his contemporaries, first became musically evident in the opera ''Sita'' (1901–06).&lt;ref name=H1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Head|first=Raymond|title=Holst and India (I): 'Maya' to 'Sita'|jstor=944947|journal=[[Tempo (journal)|Tempo]]|issue=158|date=September 1986|pages=2–7}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the opera's long gestation, Holst worked on other Indian-themed pieces. These included ''Maya'' (1901) for violin and piano, regarded by the composer and writer Raymond Head as &quot;an insipid salon-piece whose musical language is dangerously close to [[Michael Maybrick|Stephen Adams]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=H1/&gt;{{refn|&quot;Stephen Adams&quot; was the assumed name of [[Michael Maybrick]], a British composer of Victorian sentimental ballads, the best known of which is &quot;[[The Holy City (song)|The Holy City]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Maybrick, Michael|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t237/e6647|publisher=Oxford Dictionary of Music Online edition|accessdate= 6 April 2013}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} Then, through Vaughan Williams, Holst discovered and became an admirer of the music of [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]],&lt;ref name=HolstEB&gt;{{Britannica|269664}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom he considered a &quot;model of purity&quot; on the level with Haydn,{{sfnp|Short|1990|p=61}} another composer he greatly admired.{{sfnp|Short|1990|p=105}}

The combined influence of Ravel, [[Hindu]] spiritualism and English folk tunes&lt;ref name=HolstEB/&gt; enabled Holst to get beyond the once all-consuming influences of Wagner and Richard Strauss and to forge his own style. Imogen Holst has acknowledged Holst's own suggestion (written to Vaughan Williams): &quot;[O]ne ought to follow Wagner until he leads you to fresh things&quot;. She notes that although much of his grand opera, ''Sita'', is &quot;'good old Wagnerian bawling'&amp;nbsp;... towards the end a change comes over the music, and the beautifully calm phrases of the hidden chorus representing the Voice of the Earth are in Holst's own language.&quot;{{sfnp|Holst|1986|p=134}}

According to Rubbra, the publication in 1911 of Holst's Rig Veda Hymns was a landmark event in the composer's development: &quot;Before this, Holst's music had, indeed, shown the clarity of utterance which has always been his characteristic, but harmonically there was little to single him out as an important figure in modern music.&quot;&lt;ref name=r30&gt;{{harvp|Rubbra|Lloyd|1974|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dickinson describes these [[Vedas|vedic]] settings as pictorial rather than religious; although the quality is variable the sacred texts clearly &quot;touched vital springs in the composer's imagination&quot;.{{sfnp|Dickinson|1995|pp=7–9}} While the music of Holst's Indian verse settings remained generally western in character, in some of the vedic settings he experimented with Indian ''raga'' (scales).&lt;ref name=H2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Head|first=Raymond|title=Holst and India (II)|jstor=944789|journal=[[Tempo (journal)|Journal]]|issue=160|date=March 1987|pages=27–36}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chamber opera ''[[Savitri (opera)|Savitri]]'' (1908) is written for three solo voices, a small hidden female chorus, and an instrumental combination of two flutes, a cor anglais and a double string quartet.&lt;ref name=H3&gt;{{cite journal|last= Head|first= Raymond|title= Holst and India (III)|jstor= 945908|journal=[[Tempo (journal)|Tempo]]|issue= 166|date= September 1988|pages= 35–40}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music critic [[John Warrack]] comments on the &quot;extraordinary expressive subtlety&quot; with which Holst deploys the sparse forces: &quot;...&amp;nbsp;[T]he two unaccompanied vocal lines opening the work skilfully convey the relationship between Death, steadily advancing through the forest, and Savitri, her frightened answers fluttering round him, unable to escape his harmonic pull.&quot;&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Head describes the work as unique in its time for its compact intimacy, and considers it Holst's most successful attempt to end the domination of Wagnerian [[chromaticism]] in his music.&lt;ref name=H3/&gt; Dickinson considers it a significant step, &quot;not towards opera, but towards an idiomatic pursuit of [Holst's] vision&quot;.&lt;ref name=D20&gt;{{harvp|Dickinson|1995|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Kālidāsa texts, Dickinson dismisses ''The Cloud Messenger'' (1910–12) as an &quot;accumulation of desultory incidents, opportunistic dramatic episodes and ecstatic outpourings&quot; which illustrate the composer's creative confusion during that period; the ''Two Eastern Pictures'' (1911), in Dickinson's view, provide &quot;a more memorable final impression of Kālidāsa&quot;.&lt;ref name=D20/&gt;

====Folksong and other influences====
Holst's settings of Indian texts formed only a part of his compositional output in the period 1900 to 1914. A highly significant factor in his musical development was the English folksong revival, evident in the orchestral suite ''A Somerset Rhapsody'' (1906–07), a work that was originally to be based around eleven folksong themes; this was later reduced to four.&lt;ref name=D192&gt;{{harvp|Dickinson|1995|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observing the work's kinship with Vaughan Williams's ''Norfolk Rhapsody'', Dickinson remarks that, with its firm overall structure, Holst's composition &quot;rises beyond the level of&amp;nbsp;... a song-selection&quot;.{{sfnp|Dickinson|1995|pp=110–111}} Imogen acknowledges that Holst's discovery of English folksongs &quot;transformed his orchestral writing&quot;, and that the composition of ''A Somerset Rhapsody'' did much to banish the chromaticisms that had dominated his early compositions.&lt;ref name=H661/&gt; In the ''Two Songs without Words'' of 1906, Holst showed that he could create his own original music using the folk idiom.{{sfnp|Short|1990|p=65}} An orchestral folksong fantasy ''Songs of the West'', also written in 1906, was withdrawn by the composer and never published, although it emerged in the 1980s in the form of an arrangement for wind band by [[James Curnow]].{{sfnp|Dickinson|1995|pp=192–193}}

|title=March from Holst's First Suite in E-flat for Military Band
|description=Performed by the U.S. Marine Band}}
In the years before the First World War, Holst composed in a variety of genres. Matthews considers the evocation of a North African town in the ''[[Beni Mora]]'' suite of 1908 the composer's most individual work to that date; the third movement gives a preview of [[Minimal music|minimalism]] in its constant repetition of a four-bar theme. Holst wrote two suites for military band, in [[First Suite in E-flat for Military Band|E flat (1909)]] and [[Second Suite in F for Military Band|F major (1911)]] respectively, the first of which became and remains a brass-band staple.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; This piece, a highly original and substantial musical work, was a signal departure from what Short describes as &quot;the usual transcriptions and operatic selections which pervaded the band repertoire&quot;.{{sfnp|Short|1990|p=82}} Also in 1911 he wrote ''Hecuba's Lament'', a setting of [[Gilbert Murray]]'s translation from [[Euripides]] built on a seven-beat refrain designed, says Dickinson, to represent [[Hecuba]]'s defiance of divine wrath.{{sfnp|Dickinson|1995|p=22}} In 1912 Holst composed two psalm settings, in which he experimented with [[plainsong]];&lt;ref name=H662&gt;{{harvp|Holst|1980|p=662}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same year saw the enduringly popular ''St Paul's Suite'' (a &quot;gay but retrogressive&quot; piece according to Dickinson),{{sfnp|Dickinson|1995|p=167}} and the failure of his large scale orchestral work ''Phantastes''.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

===Full flowering===
====''The Planets''====
[[File:Holst-Planets-Saturn-score.jpg|thumb|The opening of &quot;Saturn&quot;, the fifth movement of ''The Planets'']]
Holst conceived the idea of ''[[The Planets]]'' in 1913, partly as a result of his interest in astrology,{{refn|Holst was reading [[Alan Leo]]'s booklet ''What is a Horoscope?'' at the time {{sfnp|Short|1990|p=122}}|group=n}} and also from his determination, despite the failure of ''Phantastes'', to produce a large-scale orchestral work.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; The chosen format may have been influenced by Schoenberg's [[Five Pieces for Orchestra|''Fünf Orchesterstücke'']], and shares something of the aesthetic, Matthews suggests, of [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]'s ''[[Nocturnes (Debussy)|Nocturnes]]'' or ''[[La mer (Debussy)|La mer]]''.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;{{sfnp|Dickinson|1995|p=169}} Holst began composing ''The Planets'' in 1914; the movements appeared not quite in their final sequence; &quot;Mars&quot; was the first to be written, followed by &quot;Venus&quot; and &quot;Jupiter&quot;. &quot;Saturn&quot;, &quot;Uranus&quot; and &quot;Neptune&quot; were all composed during 1915, and &quot;Mercury&quot; was completed in 1916.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

Each planet is represented with a distinct character; Dickinson observes that &quot;no planet borrows colour from another&quot;.{{sfnp|Dickinson|1995|p=168}} In &quot;Mars&quot;, a persistent, uneven [[Cell (music)|rhythmic cell]] consisting of five beats, combined with trumpet calls and harmonic dissonance provides battle music which Short asserts is unique in its expression of violence and sheer terror, &quot;...&amp;nbsp;Holst's intention being to portray the reality of warfare rather than to glorify deeds of heroism&quot;.{{sfnp|Short|1990|p=123}} In &quot;Venus&quot;, Holst incorporated music from an abandoned vocal work, ''A Vigil of Pentecost'', to provide the opening; the prevalent mood within the movement is of peaceful resignation and nostalgia.&lt;ref name=Matthews84/&gt;{{sfnp|Short|1990|pp=126–127}} &quot;Mercury&quot; is dominated by uneven metres and rapid changes of theme, to represent the speedy flight of the winged messenger.{{sfnp|Dickinson|1995|pp=121–122}} &quot;Jupiter&quot; is renowned for its central melody, &quot;[[Thaxted (tune)|Thaxted]]&quot;, in Dickinson's view &quot;a fantastic relaxation in which many retain a far from sneaking delight&quot;.&lt;ref name=Dickinson123&gt;{{harvp|Dickinson|1995|pp=123–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dickinson and other critics have decried the later use of the tune in the patriotic hymn &quot;[[I Vow to Thee, My Country]]&quot;—despite Holst's full complicity.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dickinson123/&gt;{{refn|Alan Gibbs, who edited Dickinson's book, remarks in a footnote that, perhaps fortunately, neither Dickinson nor Imogen was alive to hear the &quot;deplorable 1990s version&quot; of the Jupiter tune, sung as an anthem at the Rugby World Cup.&lt;ref name=Dickinson123/&gt;|group=n}}

For &quot;Saturn&quot;, Holst again used a previously-composed vocal piece, ''Dirge and Hymeneal'', as the basis for the movement, where repeated chords represent the relentless approach of old age.{{sfnp|Short|1990|pp=128–129}} &quot;Uranus&quot;, which follows, has elements of [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]'s ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'' and [[Paul Dukas|Dukas]]'s ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'', in its depiction of the magician who &quot;disappears in a whiff of smoke as the sonic impetus of the movement diminishes from {{serif|'''''[[Dynamics (music)#Relative loudness|fff]]'''''}} to {{serif|'''''[[Dynamics (music)#Relative loudness|ppp]]'''''}} in the space of a few bars&quot;.{{sfnp|Short|1990|pp=130–131}} &quot;Neptune&quot;, the final movement, concludes with a wordless female chorus gradually receding, an effect which Warrack likens to &quot;unresolved timelessness&amp;nbsp;... never ending, since space does not end, but drifting away into eternal silence&quot;.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Apart from his concession with &quot;I Vow to Thee...&quot;', Holst insisted on the unity of the whole work, and opposed the performance of individual movements.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Nevertheless, Imogen wrote that the piece had &quot;suffered from being quoted in snippets as background music&quot;.&lt;ref name=H663&gt;{{harvp|Holst|1980|p=663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Maturity====
[[File:Holst-by-rothenstein-1920.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.6|alt=pencil drawing of Holst in middle age|Holst drawn by [[William Rothenstein]], 1920]]
During and after the composition of ''The Planets'', Holst wrote or arranged numerous vocal and choral works, many of them for the wartime Thaxted Whitsun Festivals, 1916–18. They include the ''Six Choral Folksongs'' of 1916, based on [[West Country]] tunes, of which &quot;Swansea Town&quot;, with its &quot;sophisticated tone&quot;, is deemed by Dickinson to be the most memorable.{{sfnp|Dickinson|1995|pp=96–97}} Holst downplayed such music as &quot;a limited form of art&quot; in which &quot;mannerisms are almost inevitable&quot;;{{sfnp|Short|1990|p=137}} the composer Alan Gibbs, however, believes Holst's set at least equal to Vaughan Williams's ''Five English Folk Songs'' of 1913.{{sfnp|Gibbs|2000|p=128}}

Holst's first major work after ''The Planets'' was the ''Hymn of Jesus'', completed in 1917. The words are from a [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] text, the apocryphal [[Acts_of_John#Section_B|Acts of John]], using a translation from the Greek which Holst prepared with assistance from Clifford Bax and Jane Joseph.{{sfnp|Dickinson|1995|p=25}} Head comments on the innovative character of the ''Hymn'': &quot;At a stroke Holst had cast aside the Victorian and Edwardian sentimental oratorio, and created the precursor of the kind of works that [[John Tavener]], for example, was to write in the 1970s&quot;.&lt;ref name=Hymn&gt;{{cite journal|last= Head|first= Raymond|title= The Hymn of Jesus: Holst's Gnostic Exploration of Time and Space|jstor= 946668|journal=[[Tempo (journal)|Tempo]]|issue= 209|date= July 1999|pages= 7–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthews has written that the ''Hymn''{{'}}s &quot;ecstatic&quot; quality is matched in English music &quot;perhaps only by Tippett's ''The Vision of Saint Augustine''&quot;;&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; the musical elements include plainsong, two choirs distanced from each other to emphasise dialogue, dance episodes and &quot;explosive chordal dislocations&quot;.&lt;ref name=Hymn/&gt;

In the ''Ode to Death'' (1918–19), the quiet, resigned mood is seen by Matthews as an &quot;abrupt volte-face&quot; after the life-enhancing spirituality of the ''Hymn''.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Warrack refers to its aloof tranquillity;&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Imogen Holst believed the ''Ode'' expressed Holst's private attitude to death.&lt;ref name=H663/&gt; The piece has rarely been performed since its premiere in 1922, although the composer [[Ernest Walker (composer)|Ernest Walker]] thought it was Holst's finest work to that date.{{sfnp|Dickinson|1995|p=36}}

The influential critic [[Ernest Newman]] considered ''The Perfect Fool'' &quot;the best of modern British operas&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Newman|first=Ernest|title=The Week in Music|newspaper=The Manchester Guardian|date=30 August 1923|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its unusually short length (about an hour) and parodic, whimsical nature—described by ''The Times'' as &quot;a brilliant puzzle&quot;—put it outside the operatic mainstream.&lt;ref name=timespf&gt;{{cite news|title=The Perfect Fool|newspaper=The Times|date=15 May 1923|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the ballet music from the opera, which ''The Times'' called &quot;the most brilliant thing in a work glittering with brilliant moments&quot;, has been regularly performed since 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Unfamiliar Holst|newspaper=The Times|date=11 December 1956|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holst's libretto attracted much criticism, although [[Edwin Evans (music critic)|Edwin Evans]] remarked on the rare treat in opera of being able to hear the words being sung.{{sfnp|Short|1990|p=214}}

===Later works===
[[File:Moritz Retzsch Henry IV part 1 act 2 sc 4.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|&quot;Boar's Head&quot; scene from ''Henry IV Part I (1853 outline)]]
Before his enforced rest in 1924, Holst demonstrated a new interest in [[counterpoint]], in his ''Fugal Overture'' of 1922 for full orchestra and the [[Neoclassicism (music)|neo-classical]]'' Fugal Concerto'' of 1923, for flute, oboe and strings.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; In his final decade he mixed song settings and minor pieces with major works and occasional new departures; the 1925 ''Terzetto'' for flute, violin and oboe, each instrument playing in a different key, is cited by Imogen as Holst's only successful [[chamber music|chamber work]].{{sfnp|Holst|1986|p=72}} Of the ''Choral Symphony'' completed in 1924, Matthews writes that, after several movements of real quality, the finale is a rambling anticlimax.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Holst's penultimate opera, ''At the Boar's Head'' (1924), is based on tavern scenes from Shakespeare's ''[[Henry IV, Part 1|Henry IV, Parts 1]]'' and ''[[Henry IV, Part 2|2]]''. The music, which is largely derived from old English melodies gleaned from Cecil Sharp and other collections, has pace and verve;&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; the contemporary critic Harvey Grace discounted the lack of originality, a facet which he said &quot;can be shown no less convincingly by a composer's handling of material than by its invention&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Grace|first= Harvey|title= At the Boar's Head: Holst's New Work|jstor= 912399|journal=[[The Musical Times]]|volume= 66|issue= 986|date= April 1925|pages= 305–310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Egdon Heath'' (1927) was Holst's first major orchestral work after ''The Planets''. Matthews summarises the music as &quot;elusive and unpredictable [with] three main elements: a pulseless wandering melody [for strings], a sad brass processional, and restless music for strings and oboe.&quot; The mysterious dance towards the end is, says Matthews, &quot;the strangest moment in a strange work&quot;.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Richard Greene in ''[[Music &amp; Letters]]'' describes the piece as &quot;a [[Tempo|larghetto]] dance in a [[Siciliana|siciliano]] rhythm with a simple, stepwise, rocking melody&quot;, but lacking the power of ''The Planets'' and, at times, monotonous to the listener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Greene|first=Richard|title=A Musico-Rhetorical Outline of Holst's 'Egdon Heath'|jstor=735933|journal=[[Music &amp; Letters]]|volume= 73|issue=2|date=May 1992|pages=244–67|doi=10.1093/ml/73.2.244}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more popular success was ''[[A Moorside Suite]]'' for brass band, written as a test piece for the National Brass Band Festival championships of 1928. While written within the traditions of north-country brass-band music, the suite, Short says, bears Holst's unmistakable imprint, &quot;from the skipping [[Time signature#Frequently used time signatures|6/8]] of the opening Scherzo, to the vigorous melodic fourths of the concluding March, the intervening Nocturne bearing a family resemblance to the slow-moving procession of ''Saturn''&quot;.{{sfnp|Short|1990|p=263}} ''A Moorside Suite'' has undergone major revisionism in the article &quot;Symphony Within: rehearing Holst's ''A Moorside Suite''&quot; by Stephen Arthur Allen in the Winter 2017 edition of ''[[The Musical Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Arthur Allen, &quot;Symphony within: rehearing Holst's ''A Moorside Suite''&quot;, ''[[The Musical Times]]'' (Winter, 2017), pp. 7–32&lt;/ref&gt; As with ''Egdon Heath'' – commissioned as a symphony – the article reveals the symphonic nature of this brass-band work.

After this, Holst tackled his final attempt at opera in a cheerful vein, with ''The Wandering Scholar'' (1929–30), to a text by Clifford Bax. Imogen refers to the music as &quot;Holst at his best in a scherzando (playful) frame of mind&quot;;&lt;ref name=H664/&gt; Vaughan Williams commented on the lively, folksy rhythms: &quot;Do you think there's a ''little'' bit too much 6/8 in the opera?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{harvp|Short|1990|p=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; Short observes that the opening motif makes several reappearances without being identified with a particular character, but imposes musical unity on the work.{{sfnp|Short|1990|p=420}}

Holst composed few large-scale works in his final years. ''A Choral Fantasia'' of 1930 was written for the [[Three Choirs Festival]] at [[Gloucester]]; beginning and ending with a soprano soloist, the work, also involving chorus, strings, brass and percussion, includes a substantial organ solo which, says Imogen Holst, &quot;knows something of the 'colossal and mysterious' loneliness of ''Egdon Heath''&quot;.{{sfnp|Holst|1986|pp=100–101}} Apart from his final uncompleted symphony, Holst's remaining works were for small forces; the eight ''Canons'' of 1932 were dedicated to his pupils, though in Imogen's view that they present a formidable challenge to the most professional of singers. The ''Brook Green Suite'' (1932), written for the orchestra of St Paul's School, was a late companion piece to the ''St Paul's Suite''.&lt;ref name=H663/&gt; The ''Lyric Movement'' for viola and small orchestra (1933) was written for [[Lionel Tertis]]. Quiet and contemplative, and requiring little virtuosity from the soloist, the piece was slow to gain popularity among violists.{{sfnp|Short|1990|pp=324–325}} Robin Hull, in ''Penguin Music Magazine'', praised the work's &quot;clear beauty—impossible to mistake for the art of any other composer&quot;; in Dickinson's view, however, it remains &quot;a frail creation&quot;.{{sfnp|Dickinson|1995|p=154}} Holst's final composition, the orchestral scherzo movement of a projected symphony, contains features characteristic of much of Holst's earlier music—&quot;a summing up of Holst's orchestral art&quot;, according to Short.{{sfnp|Short|1990|pp=319–320}} Dickinson suggests that the somewhat casual collection of material in the work gives little indication of the symphony that might have been written.{{sfnp|Dickinson|1995|p=157}}

==Recordings==
Holst made some recordings, conducting his own music. For the [[Columbia Graphophone Company|Columbia]] company he recorded ''Beni Mora'', the ''Marching Song'' and the complete ''Planets'' with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] (LSO) in 1922, using the [[Recording studio#1890s to 1930s|acoustic process]]. The limitations of early recording prevented the gradual fade-out of women's voices at the end of &quot;Neptune&quot;, and the lower strings had to be replaced by a tuba to obtain an effective bass sound.{{sfnp|Short|1990|p=205}} With an anonymous string orchestra Holst recorded the ''St Paul's Suite'' and ''Country Song'' in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Columbia Records|newspaper=The Times|date=5 November 1925|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia's main rival, [[the Gramophone Company|HMV]], issued recordings of some of the same repertoire, with an unnamed orchestra conducted by [[Albert Coates (musician)|Albert Coates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Gramophone Notes |newspaper=The Times|date=9 June 1928|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; When electrical recording came in, with dramatically improved recording quality, Holst and the LSO re-recorded ''The Planets'' for Columbia in 1926.{{sfnp|Short|1990|p=247}}

In the early [[Long playing record|LP]] era little of Holst's music was available on disc. Only six of his works are listed in the 1955 issue of ''[[The Record Guide]]'': ''The Planets'' (recordings under Boult on HMV and [[Nixa Records|Nixa]], and another under [[Malcolm Sargent|Sir Malcolm Sargent]] on [[Decca Records|Decca]]); the ''Perfect Fool'' ballet music; the ''St Paul's Suite''; and three short choral pieces.{{sfnp|Sackville-West|Shawe-Taylor|1955|pp=378–379}} In the stereo LP and CD eras numerous recordings of ''The Planets'' were issued, performed by orchestras and conductors from round the world. By the early years of the 21st century most of the major and many of the minor orchestral and choral works had been issued on disc. The 2008 issue of ''[[The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music]]'' contained seven pages of listings of Holst's works on CD.{{sfnp|March|2007|pp=617–623}} Of the operas, ''Savitri'', ''The Wandering Scholar'', and ''At the Boar's Head'' have been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/savitri-an-episode-from-the-mahabharata/oclc/18508869&amp;referer=brief_results &quot;Savitri&quot;]; and [http://www.worldcat.org/title/wandering-scholar-at-the-boars-head/oclc/39784315&amp;referer=brief_results &quot;Wandering scholar / At the Boar's Head&quot;], WorldCat, accessed 24 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote= &quot;[Holst's] influence is lasting in the work of all of us who value directness and sincerity and who view music not so much a secret preserve for the leisured few as a vital part of everyday life&quot;
|salign = left |source= ''A tribute from [[Edmund Rubbra]]''&lt;ref&gt;From &quot;GH: An account of Holst's attitude to the teaching of composition, by one of his pupils&quot;, first published in ''Crescendo'', February 1949. Quoted by {{harvp|Short|1990|p=339}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Warrack emphasises that Holst acquired an instinctive understanding—perhaps more so than any English composer—of the importance of folksong. In it he found &quot;a new concept not only of how melody might be organized, but of what the implications were for the development of a mature artistic language&quot;.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Holst did not found or lead a school of composition; nevertheless, he exercised influences over both contemporaries and successors. According to Short, Vaughan Williams described Holst as &quot;the greatest influence on my music&quot;,&lt;ref name=Short336&gt;{{harvp|Short|1990|pp=336–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Matthews asserts that each influenced the other equally.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Among later composers, [[Michael Tippett]] is acknowledged by Short as Holst's &quot;most significant artistic successor&quot;, both in terms of compositional style and because Tippett, who succeeded Holst as director of music at Morley College, maintained the spirit of Holst's music there.&lt;ref name=Short336 /&gt; Of an early encounter with Holst, Tippett later wrote: &quot;Holst seemed to look right inside me, with an acute spiritual vision&quot;.{{sfnp|Tippett|1991|p=15}} Kennedy observes that &quot;a new generation of listeners&amp;nbsp;... recognized in Holst the fount of much that they admired in the music of Britten and Tippett&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCM&quot;/&gt; Holst's pupil Edmund Rubbra acknowledged how he and other younger English composers had adopted Holst's economy of style: &quot;With what enthusiasm did we pare down our music to the very bone&quot;.&lt;ref name=H664/&gt;

Short cites other English composers who are in debt to Holst, in particular William Walton and [[Benjamin Britten]], and suggests that Holst's influence may have been felt further afield.{{refn|Short observes that the rising fourths of &quot;Jupiter&quot; can be heard in [[Aaron Copland|Copland]]'s ''Appalachian Spring'', and suggests that the ''Hymn of Jesus'' might be considered as a forerunner of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Symphony of Psalms]]'' &quot;and the hieratic serial cantatas&quot;, though admitting that &quot;it is doubtful whether Stravinsky was familiar with, or even aware of this work&quot;.{{sfnp|Short|1990|p=337}} |group=n}} Above all, Short recognises Holst as a composer for the people, who believed it was a composer's duty to provide music for practical purposes—festivals, celebrations, ceremonies, Christmas carols or simple hymn tunes. Thus, says Short, &quot;many people who may never have heard any of [Holst's] major works&amp;nbsp;... have nevertheless derived great pleasure from hearing or singing such small masterpieces as the carol '[[In the Bleak Midwinter]]'&quot;.{{sfnp|Short|1990|p=339}}

On 27 September 2009, after a weekend of concerts at Chichester Cathedral in memory of Holst, a new memorial was unveiled to mark the 75th anniversary of the composer's death. It is inscribed with words from the text of ''The Hymn of Jesus'': &quot;The heavenly spheres make music for us&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A New Memorial for Gustav Holst|url=http://www.chichestercathedral.org.uk/news/a-new-memorial-for-gustav-holst-posted-15-jan-2010.shtml|publisher=Chichester Cathedral|accessdate=20 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150422235240/http://www.chichestercathedral.org.uk/news/a-new-memorial-for-gustav-holst-posted-15-jan-2010.shtml#|archive-date=22 April 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011 a BBC television documentary, ''Holst: In the Bleak Midwinter'', charted Holst's life with particular reference to his support for socialism and the cause of working people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In the Bleak Midwinter|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b010p530|publisher=BBC|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Irina Anatolyevna Privalova''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Ирина Анатольевна Привалова}}; née Sergeyeva on 22 November 1968) is a Russian Olympic gold medallist [[athletics (sport)|athlete]].

Her [[Summer Olympics]] debut was in [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] in the [[Sprint (running)|sprint]] events, medalling twice: 100&amp;nbsp;m and anchoring the 4x100 team, plus fourth place in the 200&amp;nbsp;m in [[1992 Summer Olympics]] whilst representing the [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]]. With three European individual championships and three individual world medals, Irina Privalova had been a formidable competitor during most of the 1990s but had not yet won an outdoor international event gold medal. In 2000, she gambled successfully and switched to the 400&amp;nbsp;m [[hurdling|hurdles]] discipline winning the gold medal in 53.02 s and a bronze in the 4 x 400&amp;nbsp;m [[relay race|relay]] team for Russia.

Irina Privalova is currently the world indoor record holder in the 50 m (5.96 s), 60 m (6.92 s) sprints. She has also been the world indoor champion at the 60 m (7.02 s in 1991), 200 m (22.15 s in 1993), and 400 m (50.23 s in 1995) events.

Privalova achieved her best time (10.77 s) in the 100 m for nine years in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iaaf.org/athletes/biographies/country=RUS/athcode=62916/index.html |title=IAAF Profile |accessdate=26 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Planets''''', [[Opus number|Op]]. 32, is a seven-[[Movement (music)|movement]] orchestral [[Suite (music)|suite]] by the English composer [[Gustav Holst]], written between 1914 and 1916. Each movement of the suite is named after a [[planet]] of the [[solar system]] and its corresponding [[planets in astrology|astrological]] character as defined by Holst.

From its premiere to the present day, the suite has been enduringly popular, influential, widely performed and frequently recorded. The work was not heard in a complete public performance, however, until some years after it was completed. Although there were four performances between September 1918 and October 1920, they were all either private (the first performance, in London) or incomplete (two others in London and one in [[Birmingham]]). The premiere was at the [[Queen's Hall]] on 29 September 1918,{{sfn|Lebrecht|2008|p=240}} conducted by Holst's friend [[Adrian Boult]] before an invited audience of about 250 people. The first complete public performance was finally given in London by [[Albert Coates (musician)|Albert Coates]] conducting the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] on 15 November 1920.&lt;ref name=musical-times/&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Gustav Holst.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Gustav Holst composed his well-known suite ''The&amp;nbsp;Planets''.]]
The concept of the work is [[Astrology|astrological]]&lt;ref name=HolstLM&gt;&quot;HOLST Suite: The Planets&quot; (compares compositions &amp; history), Len Mullenger, Olton Recorded Music Society, January 2000, webpage: [http://www.musicweb.uk.net/holst.htm MusicWebUK-Holst]: in 1913 [[Gustav Holst|Holst]] went on holiday to [[Majorca]] with [[Balfour Gardiner]], [[Arnold Bax]], and his brother [[Clifford Bax]], and who spent the entire holiday discussing astrology.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than [[astronomy|astronomical]] (which is why [[Earth]] is not included, although [[Planets in astrology#Sun|Sun and Moon]] are also not included while including the non-traditional Uranus and Neptune): each movement is intended to convey ideas and emotions associated with the [[Planets in astrology|influence of the planets on the psyche]], not the [[Dii Consentes|Roman deities]]. The idea of the work was suggested to Holst by [[Clifford Bax]], who introduced him to astrology when the two were part of a small group of English artists holidaying in [[Majorca]] in the spring of 1913; Holst became quite a devotee of the subject, and would cast his friends' horoscopes for fun.&lt;ref name=HolstLM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Imogen/&gt; Holst also used [[Alan Leo]]'s&lt;ref name=HolstLM/&gt; book ''What is a Horoscope?'' as a springboard for his own ideas, as well as for the subtitles (e.g., &quot;The Bringer of...&quot;) for the movements.

On 17 January 1914 Holst attended a performance of [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s ''[[Five Pieces for Orchestra]]'', at the Queen's Hall, conducted by Schoenberg's pupil [[Edward Clark (conductor)|Edward Clark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.schoenberg.at/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1014&amp;Itemid=726&amp;lang=en|title=1914 • Herr Schönberg in London|website=www.schoenberg.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=keller&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wo4LhjGd-c4C&amp;q=edward+clark+schoenberg&amp;pg=PA21|title=Hans Keller and the BBC: The Musical Conscience of British Broadcasting, 1959–79|first=Alison|last=Garnham|date=23 October 2003|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=9780754608974|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CVCtkShvDSkC&amp;q=clark&amp;pg=PA127|title=The BBC and Ultra-Modern Music, 1922–1936: Shaping a Nation's Tastes|first1=Jennifer|last1=Doctor|first2=Jennifer Ruth|last2=Doctor|date=23 October 1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521661171|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holst quickly acquired a copy of the score, the only Schoenberg score he ever owned. This influenced Holst at least to the degree that the working title of his own composition was ''Seven Pieces for Large Orchestra''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoenberg.at/library/index.php/attachments/single/1634 David Lambourn, &quot;Henry Wood and Schoenberg&quot;, The Musical Times, Vol. 128, No. 1734 (August 1987), pp. 422–27]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When composing ''The Planets'' Holst initially scored the work for four hands, two pianos, except for Neptune, which was scored for a [[Organ (music)|single organ]], as Holst believed that the sound of the piano was too percussive for a world as mysterious and distant as Neptune. Holst then scored the suite for a large orchestra, in which form it became enormously popular. Holst's use of orchestration was very imaginative and colourful, showing the influence of such contemporary composers as [[Igor Stravinsky]]&lt;ref&gt;Short, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arnold Schoenberg]],&lt;ref name=HolstLM/&gt; as well as such late Russian romantics as [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] and [[Alexander Glazunov]]. Its novel sonorities helped make the work an immediate success with audiences at home and abroad. Although ''The Planets'' remains Holst's most popular work, the composer himself did not count it among his best creations and later in life complained that its popularity had completely surpassed his other works. He was, however, partial to his own favourite movement, Saturn.&lt;ref&gt;Boult, Sir Adrian (1967), Liner note to EMI CD 5 66934 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The orchestral premiere of ''The Planets'' suite, conducted at Holst's request by [[Adrian Boult]], was held at short notice on 29&amp;nbsp;September 1918, during the last weeks of World War I, in the [[Queen's Hall]] with the financial support of Holst's friend and fellow composer [[H. Balfour Gardiner]]. It was hastily rehearsed; the musicians of the Queen's Hall Orchestra first saw the complicated music only two hours before the performance, and the choir for Neptune was recruited from pupils from [[Morley College]] and [[St Paul's Girls' School]] (where Holst taught). It was a comparatively intimate affair, attended by around 250 invited associates,&lt;ref name=Imogen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Definitive CDs&quot; (CD 94), of Holst: The Planets (with [[Elgar]]: Enigma Variations), Norman Lebrecht, ''La Scena Musicale'', 1 September 2004, webpage: [http://scena.org/columns/lebrecht/040901-NL-definitivecds.html Scena-Notes-100-CDs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190918161309/http://www.scena.org/columns/lebrecht/040901-NL-definitivecds.html |date=18 September 2019 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DivineArtBoult&gt;{{cite web|title='Sir Adrian Boult' on ''divine-art.com''|url=http://www.divine-art.com/AS/boult.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516211835/http://www.divine-art.com/AS/boult.htm|archivedate=16 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Holst regarded it as the public premiere, inscribing Boult's copy of the score, &quot;This copy is the property of Adrian Boult who first caused the Planets to shine in public and thereby earned the gratitude of Gustav Holst.&quot;&lt;ref name=boult35/&gt;
[[File:Holst-planets-inscription.jpg|thumb|left|Holst's inscription on Boult's score]]
A public concert was given in London under the auspices of the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]] on 27 February 1919, conducted by Boult. Five of the seven movements were played in the order Mars, Mercury, Saturn, Uranus, and Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3701637 &quot;London Concerts&quot;], ''[[The Musical Times]]'', April 1919, p. 179 {{subscription}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Holst, Imogen, A Thematic Catalogue of Gustav Holst's Music. Faber, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; It was Boult's decision not to play all seven movements at this concert. He felt that when the public were being given a totally new language like that, &quot;half an hour of it was as much as they could take in&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; The anonymous critic in Hazell's Annual called it &quot;an extraordinarily complex and clever suite&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Foreman, Lewis, Music in England 1885–1920, Thames Publishing, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; At a Queen's Hall symphony concert on 22 November of that year, Holst conducted Venus, Mercury and Jupiter (this was the first public performance of Venus).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/908483 &quot;London Concerts&quot;], ''The Musical Times'', January 1920, p. 32 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was another incomplete public performance, in [[Birmingham]], on 10 October 1920, with five movements (Mars, Venus, Mercury, Saturn and Jupiter). It is not clear whether this performance was conducted by [[Appleby Matthews]]&lt;ref&gt;Greene (1995), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; or the composer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/910715 &quot;Music in the Provinces&quot;], ''The Musical Times'', 1 November 1920, p. 769; and &quot;Municipal Music in Birmingham&quot;, ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'', 11 October 1920, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

His daughter [[Imogen Holst|Imogen]] recalled, &quot;He hated incomplete performances of ''The Planets'', though on several occasions he had to agree to conduct three or four movements at Queen's Hall concerts. He particularly disliked having to finish with Jupiter, to make a 'happy ending', for, as he himself said, 'in the real world the end is not happy at all'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Holst, Imogen, A Thematic Catalogue of Gustav Holst's Music. Faber, 1974, at page 125&lt;/ref&gt;

The first complete performance of the suite at a public concert did not occur until 15 November 1920; the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] (LSO) was conducted by [[Albert Coates (musician)|Albert Coates]]. This was the first time the movement Neptune had been heard in a public performance, all the other movements having been given earlier public airings.&lt;ref name=musical-times&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/910446 &quot;London Concerts&quot;'] ''The Musical Times'', December 1920, p. 821 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The composer conducted a complete performance for the first time on 13 October 1923, with the Queen's Hall Orchestra at a Promenade Concert. Holst conducted the LSO in two recorded performances of ''The Planets'': the first was an acoustic recording made in sessions between 1922 and 1924 (now available on Pavilion Records' Pearl label); the second was made in 1926, and utilised the then-new electrical recording process (in 2003, this was released on compact disc by [[IMP records|IMP]] and later on [[Naxos Records|Naxos]] outside the United States).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naxos.com/catalogue/item.asp?item_code=8.111048 HOLST: Planets (The) (Holst) / VAUGHAN WILLIAMS: Symphony No. 4 (Vaughan Williams) (1926, 1937)] at Naxos.com&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the time constraints of the [[78rpm record|78rpm format]], the tempo is often much faster than is usually the case today.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, Alan, &quot;Gustav Holst Records The Planets&quot;, ''Gramophone'', September 1976, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 26, 2008, Joel performed with the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] celebrating the 151st anniversary of the [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]]. Joel performed his classical piece titled, &quot;Waltz No. 2 (Steinway Hall)&quot; from Fantasies and Delusions arranged by [[Brad Ellis]]. He also played many of his less well-known pieces, with full orchestral backing arranged by Mr. Ellis, including the rarely performed ''Nylon Curtain'' songs &quot;Scandinavian Skies&quot; and &quot;Where's the Orchestra?&quot;.

On March 10, 2008, Joel inducted his friend [[John Mellencamp]] into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in a ceremony at the [[Waldorf Astoria Hotel]] in New York City.

Joel's staying power as a touring act continues to the present day. He sold out 10 concerts at the [[Mohegan Sun Casino]] in [[Uncasville, Connecticut]] from May to July 2008. The casino honored him with a banner displaying his name and the number 10 to hang in the arena. On June 19, 2008, he played a concert at the grand re-opening of [[Caesars Windsor]] (formerly Casino Windsor) in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], to an invite-only crowd for Casino VIPs. His mood was light, and joke-filled, even introducing himself as &quot;Billy Joel's dad&quot; and stating &quot;you guys overpaid to see a fat bald guy&quot;. He also admitted that Canadian folk-pop musician [[Gordon Lightfoot]] was the musical inspiration for &quot;She's Always A Woman&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| work= [[The Windsor Star]]| title= Billy Joel (notes)| date= June 20, 2008}}{{failed verification| date= October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, 2008, and July 18, 2008, Joel played the final concerts at [[Shea Stadium]] before its demolition. His guests included [[Tony Bennett]], [[Don Henley]], [[John Mayer]], [[John Mellencamp]], [[Steven Tyler]], [[Roger Daltrey]], [[Garth Brooks]], and [[Paul McCartney]]. The concerts were featured in the 2010 documentary film ''[[Last Play at Shea]]''. The film was released on DVD on February 8, 2011. The CD and DVD of the show, ''[[Live at Shea Stadium: The Concert|Live at Shea Stadium]]'', were released on March 8, 2011.

On December 11, 2008, Joel recorded his own rendition of &quot;[[Christmas in Fallujah]]&quot; during a concert at [[Acer Arena]] in Sydney and released it as a live single in Australia only. It is the only official release of Joel performing &quot;Christmas in Fallujah&quot;, as Cass Dillon sang on the 2007 studio recording and the handful of times the song was played live in 2007. Joel sang the song throughout his December 2008 tour of Australia.

On May 19, 2009, Joel's former drummer, [[Liberty DeVitto]], filed a lawsuit in NYC claiming Joel and Sony Music owed DeVitto over 10 years of royalty payments. DeVitto had never been given songwriting or arranging credit on any of Joel's songs, but he claimed that he helped arrange some of them, including &quot;Only the Good Die Young&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joel's Former Drummer Sues for Payments&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.musicnewsnet.com/2009/05/billy-joels-former-drummer-to-file-lawsuit.html |title=Billy Joel's Former Drummer Files Lawsuit, Liberty DeVitto Says He's Owed $$$ |first=Mal |last=Westerly |publisher=MusicNewsNet.com |date=May 24, 2009 |accessdate=May 24, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615234343/http://www.musicnewsnet.com/2009/05/billy-joels-former-drummer-to-file-lawsuit.html |archive-date=June 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2010, it was announced that Joel and DeVitto amicably resolved the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musicnewsnet.com/2010/04/billy-joel-and-former-drummer-liberty-devitto-settle-lawsuit.html |title=Billy Joel and Former Drummer, Liberty Devitto Settle Lawsuit |publisher=MusicNewsNet.com |date=April 22, 2010 |accessdate=April 25, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100427084650/http://www.musicnewsnet.com/2010/04/billy-joel-and-former-drummer-liberty-devitto-settle-lawsuit.html |archive-date=April 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

2011 marked the 40th anniversary of the release of Joel's first album, ''[[Cold Spring Harbor (album)|Cold Spring Harbor]].'' According to Joel's official website, to commemorate this anniversary, Columbia/Legacy Recordings originally planned &quot;to celebrate the occasion with a definitive reissue project of newly restored and expanded Legacy editions of the complete Billy Joel catalog, newly curated collections of rarities from the vaults, previously unavailable studio tracks and live performances, home video releases and more&quot;, although this never fully came to fruition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billy Joel's Website&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://www.billyjoel.com/news/billy-joel-catalog-be-reissued-commemorative-cdsdvds-be-released |title=Billy Joel Catalog To Be Reissued, Commemorative CDs/DVDs To Be Released |work= billyjoel.com |date=October 20, 2010 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album ''[[Piano Man (Billy Joel album)|Piano Man]]'' was re-released in a two-disc Legacy edition in November 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billy Joel's Website&quot; /&gt;

In 2012, Joel signed an exclusive worldwide publishing agreement with [[Universal Music Publishing Group]] (UMPG), and its subsidiary Rondor Music International. Under the agreement, UMPG and Rondor replaced EMI Music Publishing in handling Joel's catalog outside the US. Additionally, the agreement marked the first time since Joel regained control of his publishing rights in the 1980s that he began to use an administrator to handle his catalog within the U.S. The agreement's focus is on increasing the use of Joel's music in movies, television programs, and commercials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Christman|first1=Ed|title=Exclusive: Billy Joel Signs Global Publishing Deal With Rondor and Universal|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/publishing/1083985/exclusive-billy-joel-signs-global-publishing-deal-with-rondor| accessdate= July 17, 2015|work=Billboard|date=August 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 12, 2012, Joel performed as part of [[12-12-12: The Concert for Sandy Relief]] at [[Madison Square Garden]], a concert held for all the victims of [[Hurricane Sandy]]. He changed the lyrics to &quot;[[Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)]]&quot; to make it relate to all the damage caused by Sandy.

In May 2013, it was announced that Joel would hold his first ever indoor Irish concert at the [[The O2, Dublin|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in Dublin on November 1. He subsequently announced his return to the UK for the first time in seven years to perform three dates in October and November. Joel played two arena dates in [[Manchester]] and [[Birmingham]] plus a very special show at London's [[Hammersmith Apollo]]. In October, Joel held a surprise concert on Long Island at The Paramount ([[Huntington, New York]]) to benefit Long Island Cares. The venue holds a capacity of 1,555 and sold out in five minutes. Joel headlined a solo arena concert in New York City for the first time since 2006 when he performed at Barclays Center in Brooklyn on December 31, 2013. In 2015, Joel performed 21 concerts (in addition to his Madison Square Garden residency) from January 7 to August 2 in various cities around the U.S. and Canada.

On December 3, 2013, it was announced that Joel would become a franchise of [[Madison Square Garden]], playing one concert a month indefinitely, starting with a date on January 27, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2013/12/03/billy-joel-will-be-first-music-franchise-at-madison-square-garden/3769651/ |work=USA Today |title=Meet Madison Square Garden's new franchise: Billy Joel |first=Elysa |last=Gardner |date=December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Joel announced that he was releasing an autobiography that he had written with Fred Schruers, titled ''The Book of Joel: A Memoir''. The book was originally going to be released in June 2011, but in March 2011 Joel decided against publishing the book and officially cancelled his deal with [[HarperCollins]]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' noted, &quot;HarperCollins acquired the book project for US$3&amp;nbsp;million in 2008.

Joel's first wife was Elizabeth Weber Small. When their relationship began, she was married to Jon Small, his music partner in the short-lived duo [[Attila (rock band)|Attila]], with whom she had a son. When the affair was revealed, Weber (temporarily) severed her relationships with both men. Weber and Joel later married in 1973 and she became his manager. His one-time producer Artie Ripp said Joel's songs &quot;[[She's Got a Way]]&quot; and &quot;[[She's Always a Woman]]&quot; were inspired by her, as was the waitress character in &quot;[[Piano Man (song)|Piano Man]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

===Health issues===
Joel has battled [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] for many years. In 1970, a career decline and personal tragedies worsened his moods.

In 1971, Joel released his debut album, ''[[Cold Spring Harbor (album)|Cold Spring Harbor]]'', including the track &quot;[[Tomorrow is Today (song)|Tomorrow Is Today]]&quot;, related to this incident.

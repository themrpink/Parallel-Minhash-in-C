At about 10{{nbsp}}pm the 38th Army began to fire into the air as they traveled east on West [[Chang'an Avenue]] toward the city centre. They initially intended the warning shots to frighten and disperse the large crowds gathering. This attempt failed. The earliest casualties occurred as far west as [[Wukesong]], where Song Xiaoming, a 32-year-old aerospace technician, was the first confirmed fatality of the night.{{sfn|Wu: June 3}} Several minutes later, when the convoy encountered a substantial blockade east of the [[3rd Ring Road (Beijing)|3rd Ring Road]], they opened automatic rifle fire directly at protesters.{{sfn|Baum|1996|pp=282–83}} The crowds were stunned that the army was using live ammunition and reacted by hurling insults and projectiles.{{sfn|Suettinger|2004|p=60}}{{sfn|Wu: June 3}} The troops used [[expanding bullets]], prohibited by international law for use in warfare between countries but not for other uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Laws of War: Declaration on the Use of Bullets Which Expand or Flatten Easily in the Human Body|url=https://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/dec99-03.asp|url-status=live|access-date=June 20, 2020|archive-date=July 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200703004653/https://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/dec99-03.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Expanding bullets|url=http://www.weaponslaw.org/weapons/expanding-bullets|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200621160750/http://www.weaponslaw.org/weapons/expanding-bullets|archive-date=June 21, 2020|access-date=|website=Weapons Law Enyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Thomas|2006}}

At about 10:30{{nbsp}}pm, the advance of the army was briefly halted at [[Muxidi]], about 5&amp;nbsp;km west of the Square, where [[articulated bus|articulated]] [[trolleybuses]] were placed across a bridge and set on fire.{{sfn|John Pomfret interview|2006}} Crowds of residents from nearby apartment blocks tried to surround the military convoy and halt its advance. The 38th Army again opened fire, inflicting heavy casualties.{{sfn|Timothy Brook interview|2006}}{{sfn|John Pomfret interview|2006}} According to the tabulation of victims by [[Tiananmen Mothers]], 36 people died at Muxidi, including Wang Weiping, a doctor tending to the wounded.{{sfn|Tiananmen Mothers | 六四天安门惨案死难者遇难地点示意图}} As the battle continued eastward the firing became indiscriminate, with &quot;random, stray patterns&quot; killing both protesters and uninvolved bystanders.{{sfn|Baum|1996|p=283}}{{sfn|Lim|2014a|p=38}} Several were killed in the apartments of high-ranking party officials overlooking the boulevard.{{sfn|Timothy Brook interview|2006}}{{sfn|Lim|2014a|p=38}} Soldiers raked the apartment buildings with gunfire, and some people inside or on their balconies were shot.{{sfn|Richelson | Evans | 1999b}}{{sfn|Timothy Brook interview|2006}}{{sfn|Martel|2006}}{{sfn|Lim|2014a|p=38}} The 38th Army also used [[armored personnel carriers]] (APCs) to ram through the buses.

To the south, the XV Airborne Corps also used live ammunition, and civilian deaths were recorded at Hufangqiao, Zhushikou, [[Tianqiao Subdistrict, Beijing|Tianqiao]], and [[Qianmen]].{{sfn|Tiananmen Mothers | 六四天安门惨案死难者遇难地点示意图}}

====Protestors attack the PLA's troopers====
Unlike more moderate student leaders, [[Chai Ling]] seemed willing to allow the student movement to end in a violent confrontation.{{sfn|Han|Hua|1990|p=298}} In an interview given in late May, Chai suggested that only when the movement ended in bloodshed would the majority of China realize the importance of the student movement and unite, though she felt that she was unable to convince her fellow students of this.{{sfn|Han|Hua|1990|p=327}} She also stated that the expectation of violent crackdown was something she had heard from [[Li Lu]] and not an idea of her own.{{sfn|Chai|2011|p=165}}

As the killings started, it infuriated city residents, some of whom attacked soldiers with sticks, rocks, and [[molotov cocktails]], setting fire to military vehicles and beating the soldiers inside them to death. On one avenue in western Beijing, anti-government protestors torched a military convoy of more than 100 trucks and armored vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;John Burgess, &quot;Images Vilify Protesters; Chinese Launch Propaganda Campaign,&quot; Washington Post, June 12, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese government and its supporters have tried to argue that the troops acted in self-defense and seized upon troop casualties to justify the use of force; but lethal attacks on troops occurred after the military had opened fire at 10{{nbsp}}pm on June 3 and the [[#Death toll|number of military fatalities caused by protesters]] was relatively few—between 7 and 10, according to [[Wu Renhua]]'s study and Chinese government reports,{{sfn|Wu: PLA casualties}}{{sfn|Wu|2009|p=58}}{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|p=436}} compared to [[#Death toll|hundreds or thousands of civilian deaths]]. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that:&lt;blockquote&gt;As columns of tanks and tens of thousands of soldiers approached Tiananmen, many troops were set on by angry mobs who screamed, &quot;Fascists&quot;. Dozens of soldiers were pulled from trucks, severely beaten and left for dead. At an intersection west of the square, the body of a young soldier, who had been beaten to death, was stripped naked and hung from the side of a bus. Another soldier's corpse was strung up at an intersection east of the square.&lt;ref&gt;James P. Sterba, Adi Ignatius and Robert S.

====Clearing the square====
At 8:30{{nbsp}}pm, army helicopters appeared above the Square and students called for campuses to send reinforcements. At 10{{nbsp}}pm, the founding ceremony of the Tiananmen Democracy University was held as scheduled at the base of the [[Goddess of Democracy]]. At 10:16{{nbsp}}pm, the loudspeakers controlled by the government warned that troops may take &quot;any measures&quot; to enforce martial law. By 10:30{{nbsp}}pm, news of bloodshed to the west and south of the city began trickling into the Square. At midnight, the students' loudspeaker announced news that a student had been killed on West Chang'an Avenue near the Military Museum, and a sombre mood settled on the Square. Li Lu, the deputy commander of the student headquarters, urged students to remain united in defending the Square through non-violent means. At 12:30{{nbsp}}am, [[Wu'erkaixi]] fainted after learning that a female student at Beijing Normal University, who had left campus with him earlier in the evening, had just been killed. Wu'erkaixi was taken away by ambulance. By then, there were still 70,000–80,000 people in the Square.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (1)}}

At about 12:15{{nbsp}}am, a [[flare]] lit up the sky and the first armored personnel vehicle appeared on the Square from the west. At 12:30{{nbsp}}am, two more APCs arrived from the south. The students threw chunks of concrete at the vehicles. One APC stalled, perhaps from metal poles jammed into its wheels, and the demonstrators covered it with gasoline-doused blankets and set it on fire. The intense heat forced out the three occupants, who were swarmed by demonstrators. The APCs had reportedly run over tents and many in the crowd wanted to beat the soldiers. But students formed a protective cordon and escorted the three men to the medic station by the History Museum on the east side of the Square.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (1)}}

Pressure mounted on the student leadership to abandon non-violence and retaliate against the killings. At one point, Chai Ling picked up the megaphone and called on fellow students to prepare to &quot;defend themselves&quot; against the &quot;shameless government&quot;. However, she and Li Lu eventually agreed to adhere to peaceful means and had the students' sticks, rocks, and glass bottles confiscated.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (2)}}

At about 1:30{{nbsp}}am, the vanguard of the 38th Army, from the XV Airborne Corps, arrived at the north and south ends of the Square, respectively.{{sfn|Wu: Sunday June 4, 2011}} They began to seal off the Square from reinforcements of students and residents, killing more demonstrators who were trying to enter the Square.{{sfn|Miles | 2009}} Meanwhile, soldiers of the 27th and 65th armies poured out of the Great Hall of the People to the west and those of the 24th Army emerged from behind the History Museum to the east.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (2)}} The remaining students, numbering several thousand, were completely surrounded at the Monument of the People's Heroes in the center of the Square. At 2{{nbsp}}am, the troops fired shots over the heads of the students at the Monument. The students broadcast pleadings toward the troops: &quot;We entreat you in peace, for democracy and freedom of the motherland, for strength and prosperity of the Chinese nation, please comply with the will of the people and refrain from using force against peaceful student demonstrators.&quot;{{sfn|Wu: Sunday June 4, 2011}}

At about 2:30{{nbsp}}am, several workers near the Monument emerged with a machine gun they had captured from the troops and vowed to take revenge. They were persuaded to give up the weapon by Hou Dejian. The workers also handed over an assault rifle without ammunition, which Liu Xiaobo smashed against the marble railings of the Monument.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (3)}} Shao Jiang, a student who had witnessed the killings at Muxidi, pleaded with the older intellectuals to retreat, saying too many lives had been lost. Initially, Liu Xiaobo was reluctant, but eventually joined Zhou Duo, Gao Xin, and [[Hou Dejian]] in making the case to the student leaders for a withdrawal. Chai Ling, Li Lu, and Feng Congde initially rejected the idea of withdrawal.{{sfn|Wu: Sunday June 4, 2011}} At 3:30{{nbsp}}am, at the suggestion of two doctors in the Red Cross camp, Hou Dejian and Zhuo Tuo agreed to try to negotiate with the soldiers. They rode in an ambulance to the northeast corner of the Square and spoke with Ji Xinguo, the political commissar of the 38th Army's 336th Regiment, who relayed the request to command headquarters, which agreed to grant safe passage for the students to the southeast. The commissar told Hou, &quot;it would be a tremendous accomplishment, if you can persuade the students to leave the Square.&quot;{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (3)}}

At 4{{nbsp}}am, the lights on the Square were suddenly turned off, and the government's loudspeaker announced: &quot;Clearance of the Square begins now. We agree with the students' request to clear the Square.&quot;{{sfn|Wu: Sunday June 4, 2011}} The students sang ''[[The Internationale]]'' and braced for a last stand.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (3)}} Hou returned and informed student leaders of his agreement with the troops. At 4:30{{nbsp}}am, the lights were relit and the troops began to advance on the Monument from all sides. At about 4:32{{nbsp}}am, Hou Dejian took the student's loudspeaker and recounted his meeting with the military. Many students, who learned of the talks for the first time, reacted angrily and accused him of cowardice.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (4)}}

The soldiers stopped about ten meters from the students. The first row of troops took aim with machine guns from the prone position. Behind them soldiers [[Squatting position|squatted]] and stood with assault rifles. Mixed among them were anti-riot police with clubs. Further back were tanks and APCs.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (4)}} Feng Congde took to the loudspeaker and explained that there was no time left to hold a meeting. Instead, a voice vote would decide the collective action of the group. Although the vote's results were inconclusive, Feng said the &quot;gos&quot; had prevailed.{{sfn|D. Zhao |2001|p=206}} Within a few minutes, at about 4:35{{nbsp}}am, a squad of soldiers in camouflaged uniform charged up the Monument and shot out the students' loudspeaker.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=206}}{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (4)}} Other troops beat and kicked dozens of students at the Monument, seizing and smashing their cameras and recording equipment. An officer with a loudspeaker called out &quot;you better leave or this won't end well.&quot;{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (4)}}

Some of the students and professors persuaded others still sitting on the lower tiers of the Monument to get up and leave, while soldiers beat them with clubs and gunbutts and prodded them with bayonets. Witnesses heard bursts of gunfire.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (4)}} At about 5:10{{nbsp}}am, the students began to leave the Monument. They linked arms and marched along a corridor to the southeast,{{sfn|John Pomfret interview|2006}}{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (4)}} though some departed to the north.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (4)}} Those who refused to leave were beaten by soldiers and ordered to join the departing procession. Having removed the students from the square, soldiers were ordered to relinquish their ammunition, after which they were allowed a short reprieve, from 7{{nbsp}}am to 9{{nbsp}}am.{{sfn|Lim|2014a|p=23}} The soldiers were then ordered to clear the square of all debris left over from the student occupation. The debris was either piled and burnt on the square, or placed in large plastic bags that were then airlifted away by military helicopters.{{sfn|Lim|2014a|p=19}}{{sfn|Lilley|1989}} After the cleanup, the troops stationed at The Great Hall of the People remained confined within for the next nine days. During this time, the soldiers were left to sleep on the floors and daily fed a single packet of instant noodles shared between three men. Officers apparently suffered no such deprivation and were served regular meals apart from their troops.{{sfn|Lim|2014a|pp=25–26}}

Just past 6{{nbsp}}am on June 4, as a convoy of students who had vacated the Square were walking westward in the bicycle lane along Chang'an Avenue back to campus, three tanks pursued them from the Square, firing tear gas. One tank drove through the crowd, killing 11 students and injuring scores of others.{{sfn| Wu: Tanks Ran Over Students}}{{sfn|Coonan |2008}}

Later in the morning, thousands of civilians tried to re-enter the Square from the northeast on East Chang'an Avenue, which was blocked by ranks of infantry. Many in the crowd were parents of the demonstrators who had been in the Square. As the crowd approached the troops, an officer sounded a warning, and the troops opened fire. The crowd scurried back down the avenue, in view of journalists in the Beijing Hotel. Dozens of civilians were shot in the back as they fled.{{sfn|Thomas|2006|loc=32:23–34:50}} Later, the crowds surged back toward the troops, who opened fire again. The people then fled in panic.{{sfn|Thomas|2006|loc=32:23–34:50}}{{sfn|Jan Wong interview|2006}} An arriving ambulance was also caught in the gunfire.{{sfn|The Gate of Heavenly |1995}}{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=160}} The crowd tried several more times but could not enter the Square, which remained closed to the public for two weeks.{{sfn|Schoenberger | 1989}}

===June 5 and the Tank Man===
On June 5, the suppression of the protest was immortalized outside of China via video footage and photographs of a lone man standing in front of a column of tanks leaving Tiananmen Square via [[Chang'an Avenue]]. The &quot;[[Tank Man]]&quot; became one of the most iconic photographs of the 20th century. As the tank driver tried to go around him, the &quot;Tank Man&quot; moved into the tank's path. He continued to stand defiantly in front of the tanks for some time, then climbed up onto the turret of the lead tank to speak to the soldiers inside. After returning to his position in front of the tanks, the man was pulled aside by a group of people.{{sfn|Thomas|2006}}

Although the fate of &quot;Tank Man&quot; following the demonstration is not known, paramount Chinese leader Jiang Zemin stated in 1990 that he did not think the man was killed.{{sfn|Iyer|1998}} ''Time'' later named him one of the [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|100 most influential people of the 20th century]].

A stopped convoy of 37 APCs on Changan Boulevard at Muxidi was forced to abandon their vehicles after becoming stuck among an assortment of burned-out buses and military vehicles.{{sfn|Brook|1998|pp=178–79}} In addition to occasional incidents of soldiers opening fire on civilians in Beijing, Western news outlets reported clashes between units of the PLA.{{sfn|Kristof: Units Clash}} Late in the afternoon 26 tanks, three armored personnel carriers and supporting infantry took up defensive positions facing east at [[Jianguomen (Beijing)|Jianguomen]] and [[Fuxingmen]] overpasses.{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=189}} Shellfire was heard throughout the night, and the next morning a United States Marine in the eastern part of the city reported spotting a damaged armored vehicle that had been disabled by an armor-piercing shell.{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=190}} The ongoing turmoil in the capital disrupted the flow of everyday life. No editions of the ''People's Daily'' were available in Beijing on June 5, despite assurances that they had been printed.{{sfn|Kristof: Units Clash}} Many shops, offices, and factories were not able to open, as workers remained in their homes, and public transit services were limited to subway and suburban bus routes.{{sfn|Wong |1989}}

By and large, the government regained control in the week following the military's seizure of the Square. A political purge followed in which officials responsible for organizing or condoning the protests were removed, and protest leaders were jailed.{{sfn|Tsui|Pang}}

===Protests outside Beijing===
After order was restored in Beijing on June 4, protests of various sizes continued in some 80 other Chinese cities, outside the spotlight of the international press.{{sfn|Ageing rebels, bitter victims|2014}} In the British colony of Hong Kong, people again took to wearing black in solidarity with the demonstrators in Beijing. There were also protests in other countries, where many adopted the wearing of black armbands as well.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In Shanghai, students marched on the streets on June 5 and erected roadblocks on major thoroughfares. Railway traffic was blocked.{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|p=389}} Other public transport was suspended and people prevented from getting to work.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Factory workers went on a general strike and took to the streets. On June 6, the municipal government tried to clear the rail blockade, but it was met with fierce resistance from the crowds. Several people were killed from being run over by a train.{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|p=403}} On June 7, students from major Shanghai universities stormed various campus facilities to erect [[bier]]s in commemoration of the dead in Beijing.{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|p=407}} The situation was gradually brought under control without use of deadly force. The municipal government gained recognition from the top leadership in Beijing for averting a major upheaval.

In the interior cities of Xi'an, Wuhan, Nanjing, and Chengdu, many students continued protests after June 4, often erecting roadblocks. In Xi'an, students stopped workers from entering factories.{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|pp=399, 404}} In Wuhan, students blocked the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge|Yangtze River Railway bridge]] and another 4,000 gathered at the railway station.{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|p=400}} About one thousand students staged a railroad &quot;sit-in&quot;. Rail traffic on the Beijing-Guangzhou and Wuhan-Dalian lines was interrupted. The students also urged employees of major state-owned enterprises to go on strike.{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|p=405}} In Wuhan the situation was so tense that residents reportedly began a [[bank run]] and resorted to panic-buying.{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|p=408}}

Similar scenes unfolded in Nanjing. On June 7, hundreds of students staged a blockade at the [[Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge]] as well as the Zhongyangmen Railway Bridge. They were persuaded to evacuate without incident later that day, although they returned the next day to occupy the main railway station and the bridges.{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|p=409}}

The atmosphere in [[Chengdu]] was more violent. On the morning of June 4, police forcibly broke up the student demonstration taking place in Tianfu Square. The resulting violence resulted in the deaths of eight people, with hundreds injured. The most brutal attacks occurred on June 5 and 6. Witnesses estimate that 30 to 100 bodies were thrown onto a truck after a crowd broke into the Jinjiang Hotel.{{sfn|Lim|2014b}} According to Amnesty International, at least 300 people were killed in Chengdu on June 5.{{sfn|Calls for Justice |2004}}{{sfn|Massacre and aftermath|1990}} Troops in Chengdu used concussion [[grenades]], [[Baton (law enforcement)|truncheons]], [[knives]], and [[electroshock weapon]] against civilians. Hospitals were ordered to not accept students, and on the second night the ambulance service was stopped by police.{{sfn| Cheng |Zheng| 1990 | p=139}}

===Government's pronouncements===
{{see also|June 9 Deng Speech}}

At a news conference on June 6, State Council spokesperson Yuan Mu announced that based on &quot;preliminary statistics&quot;, &quot;nearly 300 people died [...] includ[ing] soldiers&quot;, 23 students, &quot;bad elements who deserve[d] this because of their crimes, and people who were killed by mistake.&quot;{{sfn|Oksenberg|Sullivan|Lambert|1990|p=364}} The wounded, he said, included &quot;5,000 [police] officers and [soldiers]&quot; and over &quot;2,000 civilians, including the handful of lawless ruffians and the onlooking masses who do understand the situation.&quot;{{sfn|Oksenberg|Sullivan|Lambert|1990|p=364}} Military spokesperson Zhang Gong stated that no one was killed in Tiananmen Square and no one was run over by tanks in the Square.{{sfn|Oksenberg|Sullivan|Lambert|1990|pp=361–67}}

Deng argued that protesters had complained about corruption to cover their real motive, which was to replace the socialist system.{{sfn|Oksenberg|Sullivan|Lambert|1990|p=378}} He said that &quot;the entire imperialist Western world plans to make all socialist countries discard the socialist road and then bring them under the monopoly of international capital and onto the capitalist road.&quot;{{sfn|Fewsmith | 2001 | p=42}}

==Death toll==
The number of deaths and the extent of bloodshed in the Square itself have been in dispute since the time of the events. The CCP actively suppressed discussion of casualty figures immediately after the events; and estimates rely heavily on eyewitness testimony, hospital records, and organized efforts by victims' relatives. As a result, large discrepancies exist among various casualty estimates. Initial estimates ranged from the official figure of a few hundred to several thousand.{{sfn|Brook|1998|pp=151–69}}

===Official figures===
Official CCP announcements shortly after the event put the number who died at around 300. At the State Council press conference on June 6, spokesman [[Yuan Mu]] said that &quot;preliminary tallies&quot; by the government showed that about 300 civilians and soldiers died, including 23 students from universities in Beijing, along with a number of people he described as &quot;ruffians&quot;.{{sfn|Oksenberg|Sullivan|Lambert|1990|p=364}}{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=167}} Yuan also said some 5,000 soldiers and police were wounded, along with 2,000 civilians. On June 19, Beijing Party Secretary [[Li Ximing]] reported to the Politburo that the government's confirmed death toll was 241, including 218 civilians (of which 36 were students), 10 PLA soldiers, and 13 People's Armed Police, along with 7,000 wounded.{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|p=436}}{{sfn|Frontline: Memory of Tiananmen|2006}} [[Politics of Beijing#List of Mayors|Mayor]] [[Chen Xitong]] said on June 30 that the number of injured was around 6,000.{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=167}}

===Other estimates===
[[File:Beijing june 1989 Zhongguancun street.jpg|thumb|right|A burned-out vehicle on a Beijing street a few days after June 6]]

On the morning of June 4, many estimates of deaths were reported, including from CCP-affiliated sources. Peking University leaflets circulated on campus suggested a death toll of between two and three thousand. The [[Red Cross Society of China|Chinese Red Cross]] had given a figure of 2,600 deaths, but later denied having given such a figure.{{sfn|How Many Died|1990}}{{sfn|''Sino-American relations''|1991|p=445}} The Swiss Ambassador had estimated 2,700.{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=154}} [[Nicholas D.

===Identifying the dead===
The [[Tiananmen Mothers]], a victims' advocacy group co-founded by [[Ding Zilin]] and [[Zhang Xianling]], whose children were killed by the CCP during the crackdown, have identified 202 victims {{as of|2011|August|lc=y}}. The group has worked painstakingly, in the face of CCP interference, to locate victims' families and collect information about the victims. Their tally has grown from 155 in 1999 to 202 in 2011. The list includes four individuals who committed suicide on or after June 4, for reasons that related to their involvement in the demonstrations.{{sfn|Tiananmen Mothers | Victims Name List}}{{efn|Ren Jianmin (Victim No. 106), was a farmer from Hebei who was passing through the city and wounded by gunfire in the stomach on June 4.

Chinese Communist Party officials have long asserted that no one died in the square itself in the early morning hours of June 4, during the &quot;hold-out&quot; of the last batch of students in the south part of the Square. Initially, foreign media reports of a &quot;massacre&quot; on the Square were prevalent, though subsequently journalists have acknowledged that most of the deaths occurred outside of the square in western Beijing. Several people who were situated around the square that night, including former Beijing bureau chief of ''The Washington Post'' [[Jay Mathews]]{{efn|Jay Mathews, former Beijing bureau chief for ''The Washington Post'' said that &quot;as far as can be determined from the available evidence, no one died that night in Tiananmen Square&quot;.  He goes on to conclude: {{quote|A few people may have been killed by random shooting on streets near the square, but all verified eyewitness accounts say that the students who remained in the square when troops arrived were allowed to leave peacefully. Hundreds of people, most of them workers and passersby, did die that night, but in a different place and under different circumstances.{{sfn|Mathews|1998}}}}}} and CBS correspondent [[Richard Roth (journalist)|Richard Roth]]{{efn|Richard Roth reported that he was held captive by troops in the Great Hall of the People on the west side of the square on the night of June 3 and could hear but not see into the square until dawn when they were driven through the square. He heard a &quot;volley of gunfire&quot; to silence the students' loudspeakers. He added that there is no doubt that many people were killed in the area on the way to and around the square, mostly in western Beijing, which the CCP denies.{{sfn|Roth|2009b}}}} reported that while they had heard sporadic gunfire, they could not find enough evidence to suggest that a massacre took place on the Square itself.

Similarly, in 2011, three secret cables from the [[Embassy of the United States, Beijing|United States embassy in Beijing]] claimed that there was no bloodshed inside Tiananmen Square itself. A Chilean diplomat who had been positioned next to a Red Cross station inside the square told his US counterparts that he did not observe any mass firing of weapons into the crowds in the Square itself, although sporadic gunfire was heard. He said that most of the troops which entered the Square were armed only with anti-riot gear.{{sfn|Lilley|1989}} Records by the Tiananmen Mothers suggest that three students died in the Square the night of the army's push into the Square.{{efn|An English translation of the Tiananmen Mothers' Database – Note: contains incorrect English spellings of some victims' names. &quot;Not Forget Us&quot; Accessed June 20, 2013.}}

Chinese scholar [[Wu Renhua]], who was present at the protests, wrote that the government's discussion of the issue was a [[red herring]] intended to absolve itself of responsibility and showcase its benevolence. Wu said that it was irrelevant whether the shooting occurred inside or outside of the Square itself, as it was still a reprehensible massacre of unarmed civilians:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Really, whether the fully equipped army of troops massacred peaceful ordinary folks inside or outside the square makes very little difference. It is not even worthwhile to have this discussion at all.&lt;ref&gt;Wu Renhua, ''Regarding the Clearing of the Square of June 4'' (in Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt;

The authorities carried out mass arrests. Many of the workers were summarily tried and executed. In contrast, the students—many of whom came from relatively affluent backgrounds and were well-connected—received much lighter sentences. [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]], the student leader who topped the most wanted list, spent seven years in prison. Many of the students and university staff implicated were permanently politically stigmatized, some never to be employed again.{{sfn|Liu|1996}}

On June 13, 1989, the [[Beijing Public Security Bureau]] released an order for the arrest of 21 students who they identified as leaders of the protest. These 21 most-wanted student leaders were part of the [[Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation|Beijing Students Autonomous Federation]],{{sfn|People's Daily|1989|p=2}}{{sfn|E. Cheng|2012}} which had been instrumental in the Tiananmen Square protests. Though decades have passed, this most-wanted list has never been retracted by the Chinese government.{{sfn |Lim |2014a |p=74}}

The 21 most-wanted student leaders' faces and descriptions were often broadcast on television as well.{{sfn|Lim|2014a|p=39}}{{sfn|Kristof: Moderates Appear}} Photographs with biographies of the 21 most wanted followed in this order: [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]],

Each of the 21 students faced diverse experiences after their arrests or escapes; while some remain abroad with no intent to return, others have chosen to stay indefinitely, such as Zhang Ming.{{sfn|Lim|2014a|pp=70–71}} Only 7 of the 21 were able to escape.{{sfn|Mosher|2004}} Some student leaders, such as [[Chai Ling]] and [[Wuer Kaixi]], were able to escape to the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and other Western nations under [[Operation Yellowbird]], which was organized by Western intelligence agencies such as [[MI6]] and [[CIA]] from [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], a British territory at the time.{{sfn|Liu|1996}}{{sfn|Lim|2014a|pp=70–71}}{{sfn|Mosher|2004}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/4f970144-e658-11e3-9a20-00144feabdc0 |title=Tiananmen Square: the long shadow |date=June 2014 |access-date=June 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604110356/https://www.ft.com/content/4f970144-e658-11e3-9a20-00144feabdc0 |archive-date=June 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the operation involved more than 40 people and had its roots in the &quot;[[Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China|Alliance in Support of Democratic Movements in China]]&quot; formed in May 1989. After the Beijing protest crackdown, this group drew up an initial list of 40 dissidents they believed could form the nucleus of a &quot;Chinese democracy movement in exile&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1991/06/02/the-great-escape-from-china/5da31d0d-aca1-4c56-9178-767d14c29f62/ |title=The great escape from China |access-date=June 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604113849/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1991/06/02/the-great-escape-from-china/5da31d0d-aca1-4c56-9178-767d14c29f62/ |archive-date=June 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining student leaders were apprehended and incarcerated.{{sfn|Mosher|2004}} Those who escaped, whether it was in 1989 or after, generally have had difficulty re-entering China, even up to this day.{{sfn|Lim|2014a|pp=73–76}} The Chinese government prefers to leave the dissidents in exile.{{sfn|Traywick|2013}} Those who attempt to re-enter, such as Wu'er Kaixi, have been simply sent back, but not arrested.{{sfn|Traywick|2013}}

[[Arrest and Trial of Chen Ziming and Wang Juntao|Chen Ziming and Wang Juntao were arrested]] in late 1989 for their involvement in the protests. Chinese authorities alleged they were the &quot;black hands&quot; behind the movement. Both Chen and Wang rejected the allegations made against them. They were put on trial in 1990 and sentenced to 13 years in prison.{{sfn|Weber|2014}} Others, such as Zhang Zhiqing, have essentially disappeared. After his initial arrest in January 1991 and subsequent release, nothing further is known about his situation and where he lives now.{{sfn|Mosher|2004}} Zhang Zhiqing's role and reason for being listed on the list of the 21 most wanted is generally unknown; this is the case for many others on the list, such as Wang Chaohua.

According to the [[Dui Hua Foundation]], citing a provincial government, 1,602 individuals were imprisoned for protest-related activities in early 1989. {{as of|2012|May|}}, at least two remain incarcerated in Beijing and five others remain unaccounted for.{{sfn|Less Than a Dozen|2012}} In June 2014, it was reported that Miao Deshun was believed to be the last known prisoner incarcerated for their participation in the protests; he was last heard from a decade ago.{{sfn|Harron|2014}} All are reported to be suffering from mental illness.{{sfn|Less Than a Dozen|2012}}

===Leadership changes===
{{main|Political purges during and after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests}}

The Party leadership expelled Zhao Ziyang from the [[Politburo Standing Committee]] (PSC). [[Hu Qili]], another PSC member who opposed martial law but abstained from voting, was also removed from the committee. He was, however, able to retain his party membership, and after &quot;changing his opinion&quot;, was reassigned as deputy minister in the Ministry for Machinery and Electronics Industry. Another reform-minded Chinese leader, [[Wan Li]], was also put under house arrest immediately after he stepped out of his plane at [[Beijing Capital International Airport|Beijing Capital Airport]] upon returning from a shortened trip abroad; the authorities declared his detention to be on health grounds. When Wan Li was released from his house arrest after he finally &quot;changed his opinion&quot;, he, like [[Qiao Shi]], was transferred to a different position with equal rank but a mostly ceremonial role. Several Chinese ambassadors abroad claimed political asylum.{{sfn|Bernstein1989b}}

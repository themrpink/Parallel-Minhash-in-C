Having promised to return to England by the summer, Isabella reached Paris in March 1325, and rapidly agreed a truce in Gascony, under which Prince Edward, then thirteen years old, would come to France to give homage on his father's behalf.&lt;ref name=DohertyP81&gt;Doherty, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Edward arrived in France, and gave homage in September. At this point, however, rather than returning, Isabella remained firmly in France with her son. Edward began to send urgent messages to the Pope and to Charles IV, expressing his concern about his wife's absence, but to no avail.&lt;ref name=DohertyP81/&gt; For his part, Charles replied that the, &quot;queen has come of her own will and may freely return if she wishes. But if she prefers to remain here, she is my sister and I refuse to expel her.&quot; Charles went on to refuse to return the lands in Aquitaine to Edward, resulting in a provisional agreement under which Edward resumed administration of the remaining English territories in early 1326 whilst France continued to occupy the rest.&lt;ref&gt;Kibler, p. 314; Sumption, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the messages brought back by Edward's agent [[Walter de Stapledon]], [[Bishop of Exeter]] and others grew steadily worse: Isabella had publicly snubbed Stapledon; Edward's political enemies were gathering at the French court, and threatening his emissaries; Isabella was dressed as a widow, claiming that Hugh Despenser had destroyed her marriage with Edward; Isabella was assembling a court-in-exile, including [[Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent|Edmund of Kent]] and [[John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond]].&lt;ref name=DohertyP81/&gt; By this stage Isabella may have begun a romantic relationship with the English exile Roger Mortimer.

===Roger Mortimer, 1325–1326===
[[File:Retour d Isabelle de France en Angleterre.jpg|thumb|Isabella landing in England with her son, the future [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] in 1326]]
Roger Mortimer was a powerful Marcher lord, married to the wealthy heiress [[Joan de Geneville]], and the father of twelve children. Mortimer had been imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1322 following his capture by Edward during the Despenser wars. Mortimer's uncle, Roger Mortimer de Chirk finally died in prison, but Mortimer managed to escape the Tower in August 1323, making a hole in the stone wall of his cell and then escaping onto the roof, before using rope ladders provided by an accomplice to get down to the [[River Thames]], across the river and then on eventually to safety in France.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Victorian writers suggested that, given later events, Isabella might have helped Mortimer escape and some historians continue to argue that their relationship had already begun at this point, although most believe that there is no hard evidence for their having had a substantial relationship before meeting in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 154; see Mortimer, 2004 pp. 128–9 for the alternative perspective.&lt;/ref&gt;

Isabella was reintroduced to Mortimer in Paris by her cousin, [[Joan of Valois (1294–1352)|Joan, Countess of Hainault]], who appears to have approached Isabella suggesting a marital alliance between their two families, marrying Prince Edward to Joan's daughter, [[Philippa of Hainault|Philippa]].&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Mortimer and Isabella may have begun a physical relationship from December 1325 onwards; If so Isabella was taking a huge risk in doing so&amp;nbsp;– female infidelity was a very serious offence in medieval Europe, as shown during the Tour de Nesle Affair&amp;nbsp;– both Isabella's former French sisters-in-law had died by 1326 as a result of their imprisonment for exactly this offence.&lt;ref&gt;A point born out by Mortimer, 2004, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Isabella's motivation has been the subject of discussion by historians; some believe that there was a strong sexual attraction between the two, that they shared an interest in the [[King Arthur|Arthurian legends]] and that they both enjoyed fine art and high living.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; One historian has described their relationship as one of the &quot;great romances of the Middle Ages&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, 2004, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; They also shared a common enemy&amp;nbsp;– the regime of Edward II and the Despensers.

Taking Prince Edward with them, Isabella and Mortimer left the French court in summer 1326 and travelled north to [[William I, Count of Hainaut]]. As Joan had suggested the previous year, Isabella betrothed Prince Edward to Philippa of Hainault, the daughter of the Count, in exchange for a substantial dowry.&lt;ref&gt;Kibler, p. 477.&lt;/ref&gt; She then used this money plus an earlier loan from Charles&lt;ref&gt;Lord, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; to raise a mercenary army, scouring [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] for men, which were added to a small force of Hainaut troops.&lt;ref name=WeirP221&gt;Weir 2006, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; William also provided eight [[Man-of-war|men of war]] ships and various smaller vessels as part of the marriage arrangements. Although Edward was now fearing an invasion, secrecy remained key, and Isabella convinced William to detain envoys from Edward.&lt;ref name=WeirP221/&gt; Isabella also appears to have made a secret agreement with the Scots for the duration of the forthcoming campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 September, Isabella, Mortimer and their modest force set sail for England.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seizure of power, 1326===
{{Main|Invasion of England (1326)|Parliament of 1327}}
[[File:Bristol1326.jpg|thumb|Isabella (left) directing the [[Siege of Bristol]] in October 1326]]
Having evaded Edward's fleet, which had been sent to intercept them,&lt;ref name=DohertyP90&gt;Doherty, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Isabella and Mortimer landed at [[River Orwell|Orwell]] on the east coast of England on 24 September with a small force; estimates of Isabella's army vary from between 300 and around 2,000 soldiers, with 1,500 being a popular middle figure.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, 2004, pp. 148–9.&lt;/ref&gt; After a short period of confusion during which they attempted to work out where they had actually landed, Isabella moved quickly inland, dressed in her widow's clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; The local levies mobilised to stop them immediately changed sides, and by the following day Isabella was in [[Bury St Edmunds]] and shortly afterwards had swept inland to [[Cambridge]].&lt;ref name=DohertyP90/&gt; [[Thomas of Brotherton, 1st Earl of Norfolk|Thomas, Earl of Norfolk]], joined Isabella's forces and [[Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster|Henry of Lancaster]]&amp;nbsp;– the brother of the late Thomas, and Isabella's uncle&amp;nbsp;– also announced he was joining Isabella's faction, marching south to join her.&lt;ref name=DohertyP90/&gt;

By the 27th, word of the invasion had reached the King and the Despensers in London.&lt;ref name=DohertyP90/&gt; Edward issued orders to local sheriffs to mobilise opposition to Isabella and Mortimer, but London itself was becoming unsafe because of local unrest and Edward made plans to leave.&lt;ref name=DohertyP90/&gt; Isabella struck west again, reaching Oxford on 2 October where she was &quot;greeted as a saviour&quot;&amp;nbsp;– [[Adam Orleton]], the [[Bishop of Hereford]], emerged from hiding to give a lecture to the university on the evils of the Despensers.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; Edward fled London on the same day, heading west towards Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Isabella and Mortimer now had an effective alliance with the Lancastrian opposition to Edward, bringing all of his opponents into a single coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Isabella's invasion route (1326).png|thumb|left|[[Isabella's Campaign|Isabella]] and [[Edward II of England|Edward]]'s campaign in 1326.&lt;ref&gt;From Weir 2006, chapter 8; Mortimer, 2006, chapter 2; and Myers's map of Medieval English transport systems, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Isabella now marched south towards London, pausing at [[Dunstable]], outside the city on 7 October.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; London was now in the hands of the mobs, although broadly allied to Isabella. [[Walter de Stapledon|Bishop Stapledon]] failed to realise the extent to which royal power had collapsed in the capital and tried to intervene militarily to protect his property against rioters; a hated figure locally, he was promptly attacked and killed&amp;nbsp;– his head was later sent to Isabella by her local supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, pp. 228–9; p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Edward, meanwhile, was still fleeing west, reaching [[Gloucester]] by the 9th. Isabella responded by marching swiftly west herself in an attempt to cut him off, reaching Gloucester a week after Edward, who slipped across the border into Wales the same day.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugh de Despenser the elder continued to hold [[Bristol]] against Isabella and Mortimer, who placed it under siege between 18–26 October; when it fell, Isabella was able to recover her daughters [[Eleanor of Woodstock|Eleanor]] and [[Joan of The Tower|Joan]], who had been kept in the Despenser's custody.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, p. 92; Weir 2006, pp. 233–4.&lt;/ref&gt; By now desperate and increasingly deserted by their court, Edward and Hugh Despenser the younger attempted to sail to [[Lundy]], a small island just off the Devon coast, but the weather was against them and after several days they were forced to land back in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; With Bristol secure, Isabella moved her base of operations up to the border town of [[Hereford]], from where she ordered Henry of Lancaster to locate and arrest her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; After a fortnight of evading Isabella's forces in South Wales, Edward and Hugh were finally caught and arrested near [[Llantrisant]] on 16 November.

[[File:Isabela spol.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hugh Despenser the younger]] and [[Edmund FitzAlan, 9th Earl of Arundel|Edmund Fitzalan]] brought before Isabella for trial in 1326; the pair were gruesomely executed]]
The retribution began immediately. Hugh Despenser the elder had been captured at Bristol, and despite some attempts by Isabella to protect him, was promptly executed by his Lancastrian enemies&amp;nbsp;– his body was hacked to pieces and fed to the local dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder of the former regime were brought to Isabella. [[Edmund FitzAlan, 9th Earl of Arundel|Edmund Fitzalan]], a key supporter of Edward II and who had received many of Mortimer's confiscated lands in 1322, was executed on 17 November. Hugh Despenser the younger was sentenced to be brutally executed on 24 November, and a huge crowd gathered in anticipation at seeing him die. They dragged him from his horse, stripped him, and scrawled Biblical verses against corruption and arrogance on his skin. He was then dragged into the city, presented to Queen Isabella, Roger Mortimer, and the Lancastrians. Despenser was then condemned to hang as a thief, be castrated, and then to be [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|drawn and quartered]] as a traitor, his quarters to be dispersed throughout England. Simon of Reading, one of the Despensers' supporters, was hanged next to him, on charges of insulting Isabella.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer The Greatest Traitor, pp. 159–162.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the core of the Despenser regime had been executed, Isabella and Mortimer began to show restraint. Lesser nobles were pardoned and the clerks at the heart of the government, mostly appointed by the Despensers and Stapleton, were confirmed in office.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; All that was left now was the question of Edward II, still officially Isabella's legal husband and lawful king.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of Edward, 1327===
[[File:Eduard2 arest.jpg|thumb|An imaginative medieval interpretation of [[Edward II of England|Edward]]'s arrest by Isabella, seen watching from the right.]]
As an interim measure, Edward II was held in the custody of Henry of Lancaster, who surrendered Edward's Great Seal to Isabella.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; The situation remained tense, however; Isabella was clearly concerned about Edward's supporters staging a counter-coup, and in November she seized the Tower of London, appointed one of her supporters as mayor and convened a council of nobles and churchmen in [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]] to discuss the fate of Edward.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; The council concluded that Edward would be legally deposed and placed under house arrest for the rest of his life. This was then confirmed at the [[Parliament of 1327|next parliament]], dominated by Isabella and Mortimer's followers. The session was held in January 1327, with Isabella's case being led by her supporter [[Adam Orleton]], [[Bishop of Hereford]]. Isabella's son, Prince Edward, was confirmed as Edward III of England, with his mother appointed regent.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 114–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Isabella's position was still precarious, as the legal basis for deposing Edward was doubtful and many lawyers of the day maintained that Edward II was still the rightful king, regardless of the declaration of the Parliament. The situation could be reversed at any moment and Edward II was known to be a vengeful ruler.

Edward II's subsequent fate, and Isabella's role in it, remains hotly contested by historians. The minimally agreed version of events is that Isabella and Mortimer had Edward moved from [[Kenilworth Castle]] in the Midlands to the safer location of [[Berkeley Castle]] in the Welsh borders, where he was put into the custody of [[Thomas de Berkeley, 3rd Baron Berkeley|Lord Berkeley]]. On 23 September, Isabella and Edward III were informed by messenger that Edward had died whilst imprisoned at the castle, because of a &quot;fatal accident&quot;. Edward's body was apparently buried at [[Gloucester Cathedral]], with his heart being given in a casket to Isabella. After the funeral, there were rumours for many years that Edward had survived and was really alive somewhere in Europe, some of which were captured in the famous [[Fieschi Letter]] written in the 1340s, although no concrete evidence ever emerged to support the allegations. There are, however, various historical interpretations of the events surrounding this basic sequence of events.

[[File:Berkeley Castle.jpg|thumb|[[Berkeley Castle]], where [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] was popularly said to have been murdered on the orders of Isabella and Mortimer; some current scholarship disputes this interpretation.]]
According to legend, Isabella and Mortimer famously plotted to murder Edward in such a way as not to draw blame on themselves, sending a famous order (in {{lang-la|Eduardum occidere nolite timere bonum est}}) which, depending on where the comma was inserted, could mean either &quot;Do not be afraid to kill Edward; it is good&quot; or &quot;Do not kill Edward; it is good to fear&quot;.  In actuality, there is little evidence of anyone deciding to have Edward assassinated, and none whatsoever of the note having been written. Similarly, accounts of Edward being killed with a red-hot [[Fireplace poker|poker]] have no strong contemporary sources to support them. The conventional 20th-century view has been that Edward did die at Berkeley Castle, either murdered on Isabella's orders or of ill-health brought on by his captivity, and that subsequent accounts of his survival were simply rumours, similar to those that surrounded [[Joan of Arc]] and other near contemporaries after their deaths.

Three recent historians, however, have offered an alternative interpretation of events. [[Paul C. Doherty|Paul Doherty]], drawing extensively on the Fieschi Letter of the 1340s, has argued that Edward in fact escaped from Berkeley Castle with the help of William Ockle, a knight whom Doherty argues subsequently pretended to be Edward in disguise around Europe, using the name &quot;William the Welshman&quot; to draw attention away from the real Edward himself. In this interpretation, a look-alike was buried at Gloucester.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 213–15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Mortimer (historian)|Ian Mortimer]], focusing more on contemporary documents from 1327 itself, argues that Roger de Mortimer engineered a fake &quot;escape&quot; for Edward from Berkeley Castle; after this Edward was kept in Ireland, believing he was really evading Mortimer, before finally finding himself free, but politically unwelcome, after the fall of Isabella and Mortimer. In this version, Edward makes his way to Europe, before subsequently being buried at Gloucester.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, 2004, pp. 244–264; Mortimer, 2006, appendix 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, [[Alison Weir (historian)|Alison Weir]], again drawing on the Fieschi Letter, has recently argued that Edward II escaped his captors, killing one in the process, and lived as a hermit for many years; in this interpretation, the body in Gloucester Cathedral is of Edward's dead captor. In all of these versions, it is argued that it suited Isabella and Mortimer to publicly claim that Edward was dead, even if they were aware of the truth. Other historians, however, including [[David Carpenter (historian)|David Carpenter]], have criticised the methodology behind this revisionist approach and disagree with the conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;See Carpenter 2007a, Carpenter 2007b.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
Isabella and Mortimer ruled together for four years, with Isabella's period as regent marked by the acquisition of huge sums of money and land. When their political alliance with the Lancastrians began to disintegrate, Isabella continued to support Mortimer. Isabella fell from power when her son, Edward III deposed Mortimer in a coup, taking back royal authority for himself. Unlike Mortimer, Isabella survived the transition of power, remaining a wealthy and influential member of the English court, albeit never returning directly to active politics.&lt;ref&gt;For a summary of this period, see Weir 2006, chapter 11; Doherty, chapter 8; Mortimer, 2006, chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===As regent, 1326–1330===
[[File:Isabella and Roger Mortimer.jpg|thumb|15th-century manuscript illustration that depicts Isabella and allegedly [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March]] at [[Hereford]]; the execution of [[Hugh Despenser the younger]] can be seen in the background.]]
Isabella's reign as regent lasted only four years, before the fragile political alliance that had brought her and Mortimer to power disintegrated. 1328 saw the marriage of Isabella's son, Edward III to Philippa of Hainault, as agreed before the invasion of 1326; the lavish ceremony was held in London to popular acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Isabella and Mortimer had already begun a trend that continued over the next few years, in starting to accumulate huge wealth. With her lands restored to her, Isabella was already exceptionally rich, but she began to accumulate yet more. Within the first few weeks, Isabella had granted herself almost £12,000;&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; finding that Edward's royal treasury contained £60,000, a rapid period of celebratory spending then ensued.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Isabella soon awarded herself another £20,000, allegedly to pay off foreign debts.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; At Edward III's coronation, Isabella then extended her land holdings from a value of £4,400 each year to the huge sum of £13,333, making her one of the largest landowners in the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Isabella also refused to hand over her [[dower]] lands to Philippa after her marriage to Edward III, in contravention of usual custom.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; Isabella's lavish lifestyle matched her new incomes.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Mortimer, in effect her first minister, after a restrained beginning, also began to accumulate lands and titles at a tremendous rate, particularly in the Marcher territories.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new regime also faced some key foreign policy dilemmas, which Isabella approached from a [[Political realism|realist]] perspective.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weir, p. 261&quot;&gt;Weir 2006, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these was the situation in Scotland, where Edward II's unsuccessful policies had left an unfinished, tremendously expensive war. Isabella was committed to bringing this issue to a conclusion by diplomatic means. Edward III initially opposed this policy, before eventually relenting,&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the [[Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton|Treaty of Northampton]]. Under this treaty, Isabella's daughter Joan would marry [[David II of Scotland|David Bruce]] (heir apparent to the Scottish throne) and Edward III would renounce any claims on Scottish lands, in exchange for the promise of Scottish military aid against any enemy except the French, and £20,000 in compensation for the raids across northern England. No compensation would be given to those earls who had lost their Scottish estates, and the compensation would be taken by Isabella.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 305, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; Although strategically successful and, historically at least, &quot;a successful piece of policy making&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; Isabella's Scottish policy was by no means popular and contributed to the general sense of discontent with the regime. Secondly, the Gascon situation, still unresolved from Edward II's reign, also posed an issue. Isabella reopened negotiations in Paris, resulting in a peace treaty under which the bulk of Gascony, minus the Agenais, would be returned to England in exchange for a 50,000 [[Mark (money)|mark]] penalty.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 261; Neillands, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty was not popular in England because of the Agenais clause.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weir, p. 261&quot;/&gt;

Henry of Lancaster was amongst the first to break with Isabella and Mortimer. By 1327 Lancaster was irritated by Mortimer's behaviour and Isabella responded by beginning to sideline him from her government.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt; Lancaster was furious over the passing of the Treaty of Northampton, and refused to attend court,&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; mobilising support amongst the commoners of London.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt; Isabella responded to the problems by undertaking a wide reform of royal administration and local law enforcement.&lt;ref name=WeirP309&gt;Weir 2006, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; In a move guaranteed to appeal to domestic opinion, Isabella also decided to pursue Edward III's [[English claims to the French throne|claim on the French throne]], sending her advisers to France to demand official recognition of his claim.&lt;ref name=WeirP309/&gt; The French nobility were unimpressed and, since Isabella lacked the funds to begin any military campaign, she began to court the opinion of France's neighbours, including proposing the marriage of her son John to the [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] royal family.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1328 the situation had descended into near civil war once again, with Lancaster mobilising his army against Isabella and Mortimer.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1329 Isabella's forces under Mortimer's command took Lancaster's stronghold of [[Leicester]], followed by [[Bedford]]; Isabella&amp;nbsp;– wearing armour, and mounted on a warhorse&amp;nbsp;– and Edward III marched rapidly north, resulting in Lancaster's surrender. He escaped death but was subjected to a colossal fine, effectively crippling his power.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 322; Mortimer, 2004, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; Isabella was merciful to those who had aligned themselves with him, although some&amp;nbsp;– such as her old supporter Henry de Beaumont, whose family had split from Isabella over the peace with Scotland, which had lost them huge land holdings in Scotland&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– fled to France.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Lancaster's defeat, however, discontent continued to grow. [[Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent|Edmund of Kent]] had sided with Isabella in 1326, but had since begun to question his decision and was edging back towards Edward II, his half-brother. Edmund of Kent was in conversations with other senior nobles questioning Isabella's rule, including Henry de Beaumont and Isabella de Vesci. Edmund was finally involved in a conspiracy in 1330, allegedly to restore Edward II, who, he claimed, was still alive: Isabella and Mortimer broke up the conspiracy, arresting Edmund and other supporters&amp;nbsp;– including [[Simon Mepeham]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Edmund may have expected a pardon, possibly from Edward III, but Isabella was insistent on his execution.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; The execution itself was a fiasco after the executioner refused to attend and Edmund of Kent had to be killed by a local dung-collector, who had been himself sentenced to death and was pardoned as a bribe to undertake the beheading.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Isabella de Vesci escaped punishment, despite having been closely involved in the plot.

===Mortimer's fall from power, 1330===
By mid-1330, Isabella and Mortimer's regime was increasingly insecure, and Isabella's son, Edward III, was growing frustrated at Mortimer's grip on power. Various historians, with different levels of confidence, have also suggested that in late 1329 Isabella became pregnant. A child of Mortimer's with royal blood would have proved both politically inconvenient for Isabella, and challenging to Edward's own position.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 326, is relatively cautious in this assertion; Mortimer, 2004 pp. 221–3 is more confident.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Berkhamsted Castle Jan 2007.jpg|thumb|right|[[Berkhamsted Castle]], where Isabella was initially held after Mortimer and her fall from power in 1330.]]
Edward quietly assembled a body of support from the Church and selected nobles,&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 158–9.&lt;/ref&gt; whilst Isabella and Mortimer moved into [[Nottingham Castle]] for safety, surrounding themselves with loyal troops.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; In the autumn, Mortimer was investigating another plot against him, when he challenged a young noble, [[William Montagu, 1st Earl of Salisbury|William Montagu]], during an interrogation. Mortimer declared that his word had priority over the king's, an alarming statement that Montagu reported back to Edward.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; Edward was convinced that this was the moment to act, and on 19 October, Montagu led a force of twenty-three armed men into the castle by a secret tunnel. Up in the [[keep]], Isabella, Mortimer and other council members were discussing how to arrest Montagu, when Montagu and his men appeared.&lt;ref name=DoheryP161&gt;Doherty, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting broke out on the stairs and Mortimer was overwhelmed in his chamber. Isabella threw herself at Edward's feet, famously crying &quot;''Fair son, have pity on gentle Mortimer!''&quot;&lt;ref name=DoheryP161/&gt; Lancastrian troops rapidly took the rest of the castle, leaving Edward in control of his own government for the first time.

Parliament was convened the next month, where Mortimer was put on trial for treason. Isabella was portrayed as an innocent bystander during the proceedings,&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; and no mention of her sexual relationship with Mortimer was made public.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Isabella's lover was executed at [[Tyburn]], but Edward III showed leniency and he was not quartered or [[Disembowelment|disembowelled]].&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In retirement, 1330–1358===
[[File:Castle-rising-castle.JPG|thumb|[[Castle Rising Castle|Castle Rising]] in [[Norfolk]]; bought by Isabella in 1327, it formed her home during her later years.]]
After the coup, Isabella was initially transferred to [[Berkhamsted Castle]],{{sfn|Castor|2011|p=312}} and then held under house arrest at [[Windsor Castle]] until 1332, when she then moved back to her own [[Castle Rising (castle)|Castle Rising]] in [[Norfolk]].&lt;ref name=DohertyP173&gt;Doherty, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agnes Strickland]], a Victorian historian, argued that Isabella suffered from occasional fits of madness during this period but modern interpretations suggest, at worst, a [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]] following the death of her lover.&lt;ref name=DohertyP173/&gt; Isabella remained extremely wealthy; despite being required to surrender most of her lands after losing power, in 1331 she was reassigned a yearly income of £3000,{{sfn|Castor|2011|p=313}} which increased to £4000 by 1337.&lt;ref name=DohertyP173/&gt; She lived an expensive lifestyle in Norfolk, including [[minstrel]]s, huntsmen, grooms and other luxuries,&lt;ref name=&quot;Doherty, p. 176&quot;&gt;Doherty, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; and was soon travelling again around England. In 1342, there were suggestions that she might travel to Paris to take part in peace negotiations, but eventually this plan was quashed.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; She was also appointed to negotiate with France in 1348 and was involved in the negotiations with [[Charles II of Navarre]] in 1358.&lt;ref name=&quot;mortimer332&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=The Perfect King The Life of Edward III, Father of the English Nation | last=Mortimer | first=Ian | authorlink=Ian Mortimer (historian) | page=332 | year=2008 | publisher=Vintage }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the years went by, Isabella became very close to her daughter Joan, especially after Joan left her unfaithful husband, King David II of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Joan also nursed her just before she died. She doted on her grandchildren, including [[Edward, the Black Prince]]. She became increasingly interested in religion as she grew older, visiting a number of shrines.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 175–6.&lt;/ref&gt; She remained, however, a gregarious member of the court, receiving constant visitors; amongst her particular friends appear to have been Roger Mortimer's daughter [[Agnes Mortimer, Countess of Pembroke]], and Roger Mortimer's grandson, also called [[Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]], whom Edward III restored to the Earldom of March.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; King Edward and his children often visited her as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;mortimer332&quot; /&gt; She remained interested in Arthurian legends and jewellery; in 1358 she appeared at the [[St George's Day]] celebrations at Windsor wearing a dress made of silk, silver, 300 rubies, 1800 pearls and a circlet of gold.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doherty, p. 176&quot;/&gt; She may also have developed an interest in [[astrology]] or [[geometry]] towards the end of her life, receiving various presents relating to these disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;

Isabella took the [[nun]]'s habit of the [[Poor Clares]] before she died on 22 August 1358 at [[Hertford Castle]], and her body was returned to London for burial at the [[Christ Church Greyfriars|Franciscan church]] at [[Newgate]], in a service overseen by Archbishop [[Simon Islip]].&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt; She was buried in the mantle she had worn at her wedding and at her request, Edward's heart, placed into a casket thirty years before, was interred with her. Isabella left the bulk of her property, including Castle Rising, to her favourite grandson, the Black Prince, with some personal effects being granted to her daughter Joan.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 2006, p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural depictions==
{{Main|Cultural depictions of Isabella of France}}

===Literature and theatre===
Queen Isabella appeared with a major role in [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s play ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]'' (c. 1592) and thereafter has been frequently used as a character in plays, books, and films, often portrayed as beautiful but manipulative or wicked. [[Thomas Gray]], the 18th-century poet, combined Marlowe's depiction of Isabella with [[William Shakespeare]]'s description of [[Margaret of Anjou]] (the wife of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]]) as the &quot;She-Wolf of France&quot;, to produce the anti-French poem ''[[The Bard (poem)|The Bard]]'' (1757), in which Isabella rips apart the bowels of Edward II with her &quot;unrelenting fangs&quot;.&lt;ref name=WeirP2&gt;Weir 2006, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;She-Wolf&quot; epithet stuck, and [[Bertolt Brecht]] re-used it in ''[[The Life of Edward II of England]]'' (1923).&lt;ref name=WeirP2/&gt;

===Film===
In [[Derek Jarman]]'s film [[Edward II (film)|''Edward II'']] (1991), based on Marlowe's play, Isabella is portrayed (by actress [[Tilda Swinton]]) as a &quot;femme fatale&quot; whose thwarted love for Edward causes her to turn against him and steal his throne. In contrast to the negative depictions, [[Mel Gibson]]'s film ''[[Braveheart]]'' (1995) portrays Isabella (played by the French actress [[Sophie Marceau]]) more sympathetically. In the film, an adult Isabella is fictionally depicted as having a romantic affair with the Scottish hero [[William Wallace]]. However, in reality, she was nine years old at the time of Wallace's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/aug/06/lying-historical-fiction|title=The lying art of historical fiction|publisher=Guardian News|date=6 August 2010|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Wallace is incorrectly suggested to be the father of her son, Edward III, despite Wallace's death being many years before Edward's birth.&lt;ref&gt;Ewan, pp. 1219–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issue==
Edward and Isabella had four children, and she suffered at least one [[miscarriage]]. Their itineraries demonstrate that they were together 9 months prior to the births of all four surviving offspring. Their children were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haines |first=Roy Martin |year= 2003 |title=King Edward II: His Life, his Reign and its Aftermath, 1284–1330 |location=Montreal, Canada and Kingston, Canada |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |isbn=978-0-7735-3157-4 |page=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Isabella is descended from [[Gytha of Wessex]] through King [[Andrew II of Hungary]] and thus brought the bloodline of the last [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[King of England]], [[Harold Godwinson]], back into the English royal family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weir90&quot;&gt;Weir 1999, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] is {{convert|8.6|mi|km|}} to the north-east, while [[Snowdonia]] fringes Caernarfon to the east and south-east. '''Carnarvon''' and '''Caernarvon''' are [[Anglicisation|Anglicised]] spellings that were superseded in 1926 and 1974 respectively. 

Abundant natural resources in and around the Menai Strait enabled human habitation in [[prehistoric Britain]]. The [[Ordovices]], a [[list of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribe]], lived in the region during the period known as [[Roman Britain]]. The [[castra|Roman fort]] [[Segontium]] was established around {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;80 to subjugate the Ordovices during the [[Roman conquest of Britain]]. The Romans occupied the region until the [[end of Roman rule in Britain]] in 382, after which Caernarfon became part of the [[Kingdom of Gwynedd]]. In the late 11th century, [[William the Conqueror]] ordered the construction of a [[motte-and-bailey castle]] at Caernarfon as part of the [[Norman invasion of Wales]]. He was unsuccessful, and Wales remained independent until around 1283.

In the 13th century, [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]], ruler of Gwynedd, refused to pay homage to [[Edward I of England]], prompting the [[conquest of Wales by Edward I|English conquest of Gwynedd]]. This was followed by the construction of [[Caernarfon Castle]], one of the largest and most imposing fortifications built by the English in Wales. In 1284, the English-style county of [[Caernarfonshire]] was established by the [[Statute of Rhuddlan]]; the same year, Caernarfon was made a [[Ancient borough|borough]], a [[county town|county]] and [[market town]], and the seat of English government in north Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gareth Edwards |url=http://www.visitcaernarfon.com/history.html |title=Caernarfon Tourist Information |publisher=Visitcaernarfon.com |accessdate=29 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005124916/http://www.visitcaernarfon.com/history.html |archive-date=5 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ascent of the [[House of Tudor]] to the [[throne of England]] eased hostilities between the English and resulted in Caernarfon Castle falling into a state of disrepair. The town has flourished,{{when|date=December 2014}} leading to its status as a major tourist centre and seat of [[Gwynedd Council]], with a thriving harbour and marina. Caernarfon has expanded beyond its [[Caernarfon town walls|medieval walls]] and experienced heavy [[suburbanisation]]. The community of Caernarfon's population includes the highest percentage of [[Welsh language|Welsh]]-speaking citizens anywhere in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.comisiynyddygymraeg.cymru/English/Policy,%20research%20and%20data/Census%20Data/Pages/2011CensusresultsbyCommunity.aspx|title=2011 Census results by Community|website=Welsh Language Commissioner|publisher=Welsh Language Commissioner|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914001036/http://www.comisiynyddygymraeg.cymru/English/Policy,%20research%20and%20data/Census%20Data/Pages/2011CensusresultsbyCommunity.aspx|archive-date=14 September 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The status of Royal Borough was granted by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] in 1963 and amended to Royal Town in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-12762895 |title=BBC News - How does a town get a 'royal' title? |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=17 March 2011 |accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castle and town walls are part of a [[World Heritage Site]] described as the [[Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd]].

Edward's fourth son, Edward of Caernarfon, later [[Edward II of England]], was born at the castle in April 1284 and made [[Prince of Wales]] in 1301. A story recorded in the 16th century suggests that the new prince was offered to the native Welsh on the premise &quot;that [he] was borne in Wales and could speake never a word of English&quot;, however there is no contemporary evidence to support this.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Seymour (2006). &quot;The Place of the Reign of Edward II&quot;.

Caernarfon was constituted a [[borough]] in 1284 by charter of Edward I.&lt;ref name=Coflein /&gt; The charter, which was confirmed on a number of occasions, appointed the mayor of the borough Constable of the Castle [[ex officio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caernarfontowncouncil.gov.uk/eng/siarter.html |title=Cyngor Tref Frenhinol Caernarfon Royal Town Council |publisher=Caernarfontowncouncil.gov.uk |accessdate=29 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018033641/http://www.caernarfontowncouncil.gov.uk/eng/siarter.html |archive-date=18 October 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The former [[municipal borough]] was designated a royal borough in 1963.&lt;ref name=Coflein /&gt; The borough was abolished by the [[Local Government Act 1972]] in 1974, and the status of &quot;royal town&quot; was granted to the [[community council|community]] which succeeded it.&lt;ref name=Coflein /&gt; Caernarfon was the [[county town]] of the [[historic counties of Wales|historic county]] of [[Caernarfonshire]].

In 1911, [[David Lloyd George]], then [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Caernarfon (UK Parliament constituency)|Caernarfon boroughs]], which included various towns from Llŷn to Conwy, agreed to the [[British Royal Family]]'s idea of holding the [[investiture of the Prince of Wales]] at [[Caernarfon Castle]]. The ceremony took place on 13 July, with the royal family visiting Wales, and the future [[Edward VIII]] was duly invested.

In 1955 Caernarfon was in the running for the title of [[Capital of Wales]] on historical grounds but the town's campaign was heavily defeated in a ballot of Welsh local authorities, with 11 votes compared to Cardiff's 136.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INVESTING IN CAERNARFON|url=http://www.propertyinvestorswales.com/investing-in-wales/investing-in-caernarfon.html|publisher=Property Investors Wales|accessdate=4 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701110943/http://www.propertyinvestorswales.com/investing-in-wales/investing-in-caernarfon.html|archive-date=1 July 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cardiff]] therefore became the Welsh capital.

On 1 July 1969 the investiture ceremony for [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] was again held at Caernarfon Castle. The ceremony went ahead without incident despite terrorist threats and protests, which culminated in the death of two members of [[Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru]] (Welsh Defence Movement), Alwyn Jones and George Taylor, who were killed when their bomb – intended for the railway line at [[Abergele]] in order to stop the [[British Royal Train]] – exploded prematurely. The bomb campaign (one in Abergele, two in Caernarfon and finally one on [[Llandudno Pier]]) was organised by the movement's leader, John Jenkins. He was later arrested after a tip-off and was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/2009/06/26/parade-to-commemorate-the-abergele-martyrs-55578-23984872/|title=Parade to commemorate the Abergele Martyrs|publisher=Dailypost.co.uk|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

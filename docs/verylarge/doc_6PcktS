The '''Grammy Award for Song of the Year''' is an honor presented at the [[Grammy Awards]], a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards.&lt;ref name=Grammy&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/awards/grammys/env-grammy_awards_info,0,5279018.htmlstory?track=center|title=Grammy Awards at a Glance|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=February 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Song of the Year award is one of the four most prestigious categories at the awards (alongside [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]], [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]), presented annually since the [[1st Grammy Awards]] in 1959. According to the [[54th Grammy Awards]] description guide, the award is presented: {{quote|to honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency  and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position.&lt;ref name=Overview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy|title=Overview|accessdate=March 16, 2011|publisher=[[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

If a winning song contains samples or interpolations of existing material, the publisher and songwriter(s) of the original song(s) can apply for a Winners Certificate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.grammy.com/sites/com/files/bluebook_awards_certs_and_grammy_tickets.pdf Grammy Blue Book]&lt;/ref&gt;


Song of the Year is related to but is conceptually different from Record of the Year or Album of the Year:

* Song of the Year is awarded for a single or for one track from an album. This award goes to the songwriter who actually wrote the lyrics and/or melodies to the song. &quot;Song&quot; in this context means the song as composed, not its recording.
* Record of the Year is also awarded for a single or individual track, but the recipient of this award is the performing artist, the producer, recording engineer and/or mixer for that song. In this sense, &quot;record&quot; means a particular recorded song, not its composition or an album of songs.
* Album of the Year is awarded for a whole album, and the award is presented to the artist, songwriter, producer, recording engineer, and mastering engineer for that album. In this context, &quot;album&quot; means a recorded collection of songs (a multi-track LP, CD, or download package), not the individual songs or their compositions.

==History and description==
The Song of the Year awards have been awarded since 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/news/grammy-rewind-1st-annual-grammy-awards|title=GRAMMY REWIND: 1ST ANNUAL GRAMMY AWARDS|publisher=The Recording Academy|accessdate=February 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the four most prestigious Grammy Awards. Despite both [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|the Record of the Year award]] and Song of the Year being awarded for a single or for one track from an album, this award goes only to the composer(s) of the song whereas the Record of the Year award goes to the performer and production team of the song. According to the [[54th Grammy Awards]] description guide, the award is given to the songwriter(s) of a song that &quot;must contain melody and lyrics and must be either a new song or a song first achieving prominence during the eligibility year. Songs containing prominent samples or interpolations are not eligible&quot;.&lt;ref name=Categorymapper&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/announcement/category-mapper|title=Category Mapper|accessdate=November 25, 2011|publisher=[[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1960s other songwriter's awards have been presented for genre-specific categories including [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song]] (since 1965), [[Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Song]] (since 1969), [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media]] (since 1988), [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song]] (since 1992), and most recently [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Song]] (since 2004), [[Grammy Award for Best Gospel Song]] (from 2006 to 2014), [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Christian Music Song]] (from 2012 to 2014), [[Grammy Award for Best American Roots Song]] (since 2014), [[Grammy Award for Best Gospel Performance/Song]] (since 2015), and [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song]] (since 2015).

The category was expanded to include eight nominees in [[61st Annual Grammy Awards|2019]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/recording-academy-announces-61st-grammy-awards-update Recording Academy Announces 61st GRAMMY Awards Update]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Achievements ==

In many cases, the songwriters were also the performers ([[Domenico Modugno]], [[Henry Mancini]], [[John Lennon]] &amp; [[Paul McCartney]], [[Joe South]], [[Paul Simon]], [[Carole King]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Michael McDonald (musician)|Michael McDonald]], [[Christopher Cross]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Michael Jackson]] &amp; [[Lionel Richie]], [[Bobby McFerrin]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Seal (musician)|Seal]], [[Shawn Colvin]], [[Rob Thomas (musician)|Rob Thomas]], [[U2]], [[Alicia Keys]], [[Luther Vandross]], [[John Mayer]], [[The Chicks|Dixie Chicks]], [[Amy Winehouse]], [[Coldplay]], [[Beyoncé]], [[Lady Antebellum]], [[Adele]], [[Fun (band)|Fun]], [[Lorde]], [[Sam Smith]], [[Ed Sheeran]], [[Bruno Mars]], [[Donald Glover|Childish Gambino]] and [[Billie Eilish]]).

[[Paul McCartney]] and [[Lionel Richie]] have the most Song of the Year nominations amongst songwriters with six each. Both won once, McCartney for &quot;[[Michelle (song)|Michelle]]&quot; and Richie for &quot;[[We Are the World]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/awards/8545276/taylor-swift-paul-mccartney-songwriters-four-grammy-nominations-song-of-the-year |title=Taylor Swift, Paul McCartney &amp; All the Songwriters With 4 or More Grammy Nods for Song of the Year |publisher=[Billboard] |first=Paul |last=Grein |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212052231/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/awards/8545276/taylor-swift-paul-mccartney-songwriters-four-grammy-nominations-song-of-the-year |archive-date=12 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; With five nominations, [[Taylor Swift]] is the most nominated female songwriter in the history of the award, despite never winning it. 

The first woman to win the award was [[Carole King]] in 1972, for &quot;[[You've Got a Friend]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/beyonc%C3%A9-alison-krauss-9-times-women-made-grammy-history |title=9 Times Women Made Grammy History |publisher=[[The Recording Academy]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326172913/https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/beyonc%C3%A9-alison-krauss-9-times-women-made-grammy-history |archive-date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adele]] was the first female songwriter to win the award twice, winning for &quot;[[Rolling in the Deep]]&quot; and &quot;[[Hello (Adele song)|Hello]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/david-bowie-adele-dominate-the-grammy-awards-054345676.html |title=David Bowie, Adele Dominate the Grammy Awards |publisher=[[Yahoo!]] |first=Paul |last=Grein |date=13 February 2017 |access-date=13 February 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126014325/https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/david-bowie-adele-dominate-the-grammy-awards-054345676.html |archive-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lorde]] is the youngest songwriter to win in the category, winning for &quot;[[Royals (song)|Royals]]&quot; in 2014 at the age of 17.

[[Christopher Cross]] and [[Billie Eilish]] are the only artists to receive the Grammys for Song of the Year as well as [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], and [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] in a single ceremony. [[Adele]] is the first artist to win the award for Song of the Year, [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], and [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]], non-consecutively, and first woman to accomplish this feat. Only six artists have won the Song of the Year and [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] awards the same year: [[Christopher Cross]] (&quot;[[Sailing (Christopher Cross song)|Sailing]]&quot;, 1981), [[Alicia Keys]] (&quot;[[Fallin' (Alicia Keys song)|Fallin']]&quot;, 2002), [[Amy Winehouse]] (&quot;[[Rehab (Amy Winehouse song)|Rehab]]&quot;, 2008), [[Fun (band)|Fun]] (&quot;[[We Are Young]]&quot;, 2013), [[Sam Smith]] (&quot;[[Stay with Me (Sam Smith song)|Stay with Me (Darkchild Version)]]&quot;, 2015) and [[Billie Eilish]] (&quot;[[Bad Guy (Billie Eilish song)|Bad Guy]]&quot;, 2020); [[Marvin Hamlisch]] is the only composer to win the Song of the Year and [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] awards the same year in 1975, for &quot;[[The Way We Were (song)|The Way We Were]]&quot;.

[[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Lionel Richie]] are the only songwriters to receive three nominations in a row for consecutive years for Song of the Year.

The song &quot;[[Nel blu, dipinto di blu (song)|Nel blu, dipinto di blu (Volare)]]&quot;, winner in 1959, written by [[Domenico Modugno]] and performed in Italian, is the only foreign-language song to win this award,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/sinatra-chipmunks-7-things-know-about-1st-grammy-awards|title=Sinatra To The Chipmunks: 7 Things To Know About The 1st GRAMMY Awards|publisher=[[The Recording Academy]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702123120/https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/sinatra-chipmunks-7-things-know-about-1st-grammy-awards|archive-date=2 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the 1967 winner &quot;[[Michelle (song)|Michelle]]&quot; penned by [[Lennon–McCartney]] for [[The Beatles]] to perform, has a critical part of its lyrics in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/awards/8548392/grammy-watch-varied-song-of-the-year-winners |title=Grammy Watch: From 'That's What I Like' to 'This Is America,' The Varied Winners of Song of the Year |publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |last=Grein |first=Paul |access-date=21 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200122013833/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/awards/8548392/grammy-watch-varied-song-of-the-year-winners |archive-date=22 January 2020 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ernest Gold (composer)|Ernest Gold]]'s song &quot;[[Theme of Exodus]]&quot;, which won in 1961, is the only instrumental song to ever receive this award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbs.com/shows/grammys/news/1003803/here-is-a-list-of-every-grammys-song-of-the-year-winner-ever/|title=Here is a List of Every GRAMMYs Song of the Year Winner Ever|publisher=CBS.com|accessdate=9 February 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190224231417/https://www.cbs.com/shows/grammys/news/1003803/here-is-a-list-of-every-grammys-song-of-the-year-winner-ever/ |archive-date=24 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first and only tie in this category in Grammy history took place in 1978, when both [[Barbra Streisand]]'s &amp; [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]]' &quot;[[Evergreen (Love Theme from A Star Is Born)|Evergreen (Love Theme from ''A Star Is Born'')]]&quot; and [[Joseph Brooks (songwriter)|Joe Brooks]]' &quot;[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]&quot; win the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://parade.com/125515/parade/has-there-been-a-tie-grammys/ |title=Has There Ever been a Tie for a Grammy? |publisher=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]] |access-date=26 January 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190920225612/https://parade.com/125515/parade/has-there-been-a-tie-grammys/ |archive-date=20 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first time in Grammy history that two different songs with the same title have been nominated in this category happened with &quot;[[Hello (Lionel Richie song)|Hello]]&quot; written by [[Lionel Richie]] in 1985 and &quot;[[Hello (Adele song)|Hello]]&quot; by [[Adele]] &amp; [[Greg Kurstin]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hitsdailydouble.com/news&amp;id=304149 |title=GRAMMY WHISPERER: EIGHT RECORDS THAT WERE SET IN THIS YEAR'S NOMS |work=Hits Daily Double |last=Grein |first=Paul |date=6 December 2016 |access-date=6 December 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161208150422/https://hitsdailydouble.com/news&amp;id=304149|archive-date=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since creation of this category, no songwriter has won Song of the Year twice in a row.

Thirty-two of the winning songs have also won the award for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]].

==Process==
Members of the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] nominate their choices for song of the year. A list of the top twenty records is given to the Nominations Review Committee, a specially selected group of anonymous members, who then select the top eight records to gain a nomination in the category in a special ballot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/print/1999/feb/21/entertainment/ca-10032 Behind Grammy's Closed Door]&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the members then vote a winner from the five nominees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wyman |first=Bill |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2284690/pagenum/all/#p2 |title=The Grammys: the secret committee that alters the membership's nominations |publisher=Slate.com |date=2011-02-11 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, it was announced the number of nominated tracks will be increased to eight. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mench |first=Chris |url=https://genius.com/a/the-grammys-general-field-categories-will-expand-from-five-to-eight-nominees-next-year |title=The Grammys' General Field Categories Will Expand From Five To Eight Nominees Next Year |publisher=Genius.com |date=2018-06-28 |accessdate=2018-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Led Zeppelin''''' is the debut album by English [[rock music|rock]] band [[Led Zeppelin]]. It was released on 12 January 1969 in the United States and on 31 March in the United Kingdom by [[Atlantic Records]].

The album was recorded in September and October 1968 at [[Olympic Studios]] in London, shortly after the band's formation. It contains a mix of original material worked out in the first rehearsals, and remakes and rearrangements of contemporary blues and folk songs. The sessions took place before the group had secured a recording contract and totalled 36 hours; they were paid for directly by [[Jimmy Page]], the group's founder, leader and guitarist, and Led Zeppelin's manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] and cost £1,782 ({{Inflation|UK|value=1782|start_year=1969|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}) to complete. They were produced by Page, who as a musician was joined by band members [[Robert Plant]] (lead vocals, harmonica), [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] (bass, keyboards), and [[John Bonham]] (drums). Percussionist [[Viram Jasani]] appears as a guest on one track. The tracks were mixed by Page's childhood friend [[Glyn Johns]], and the iconic album cover showing the [[Hindenburg disaster]] was designed by [[George Hardie (artist)|George Hardie]].

''Led Zeppelin'' showed the group's fusion of blues and rock, and their take on the emerging [[hard rock]] sound was immediately commercially successful in both the UK and US, reaching the top 10 on album charts in both countries, as well as several others, while it reached number one in Spain's albums chart. Many of the songs were longer and not well suited to be released as singles for radio airplay, and Page was reluctant to release &quot;singles&quot;, so only one single was released, &quot;[[Good Times Bad Times]]&quot;. However, due to exposure on [[album-oriented rock]] radio stations, and growth in popularity of the band, many of the album's songs have become [[classic rock]] radio staples.

==Background==
In July 1968, the English rock band [[the Yardbirds]] disbanded after two founder members [[Keith Relf]] and [[Jim McCarty]] quit the group, with a third, [[Chris Dreja]], leaving to become a photographer shortly afterwards.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=87}} The fourth member, guitarist [[Jimmy Page]], was left with rights to the name and contractual obligations for a series of concerts in [[Scandinavia]]. Page asked seasoned session player and arranger [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] to join as bassist, and hoped to recruit [[Terry Reid]] as singer and [[Procol Harum]]'s [[B. J. Wilson]] as drummer. Wilson was still committed to Procol Harum, and Reid declined to join but recommended [[Robert Plant]], who met with Page at his boathouse in [[Pangbourne]], [[Berkshire]] in August to talk about music and work on new material.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=87}}&lt;ref name=ZEP1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.planetrock.com/news/rock-news/jimmy-page-sheds-new-light-on-the-inception-of-led-zeppelin-i/|title=Jimmy Page sheds new light on the inception of 'Led Zeppelin I'|publisher=Planet Rock|first=Scott|last=Colothan|date=27 September 2018|accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page and Plant realised they had good musical chemistry together, and Plant asked friend and former band-mate [[John Bonham]] to drum for the new group. The line-up of Page, Plant, Jones and Bonham first rehearsed on 19 August 1968 (the day before Plant's 20th birthday), shortly before a [[Led Zeppelin Scandinavian Tour 1968|tour of Scandinavia]] as &quot;the New Yardbirds&quot;, performing some old Yardbirds material as well as new songs such as &quot;[[Communication Breakdown]]&quot;, &quot;[[I Can't Quit You Baby]]&quot;, &quot;[[You Shook Me]]&quot;, &quot;[[Babe I'm Gonna Leave You]]&quot; and &quot;[[How Many More Times]]&quot;.{{sfn|Lewis|Pallett|1997|p=43}} After they returned to London following the tour, Page changed the band's name to [[Led Zeppelin]], and the group entered [[Olympic Studios]] at 11 p.m. on 25 September 1968 to record their debut album.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=87}}&lt;ref name=ZEP1/&gt;

== Recording ==
Page said that the album took only about 36 hours of studio time (over a span of a few weeks) to create (including mixing), adding that he knew this because of the amount charged on the studio bill.{{sfn|Welch|1994|pp=28,37}} One of the primary reasons for the short recording time was that the material selected for the album had been well-rehearsed and pre-arranged by the band on the Scandinavian tour.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=45}}{{sfn|Lewis|Pallett|1997|p=13}}

The band had not yet signed a deal, and there was no record company money to waste on excessive studio time. Page and Led Zeppelin's manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] paid for the sessions themselves.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=45}} The reported total studio costs were £1,782.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=32}} The self-funding was important because it meant they could record exactly what they wanted without record company interference.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=15}}

For the recordings Page played a psychedelically painted [[Fender Telecaster]] – a gift from friend [[Jeff Beck]] after Page recommended him to join the Yardbirds in 1965, replacing [[Eric Clapton]] on lead guitar.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=118}}&lt;ref name=&quot;JPinterview&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first=Steven |last=Rosen |url=http://www.modernguitars.com/archives/003340.html |title=1977 Jimmy Page Interview by &quot;Modern Guitars&quot; |date=25 May 2007 |orig-year=July 1977, in ''[[Guitar Player]]'' magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Page used different guitars for recording later albums, particularly a [[Gibson Les Paul]].{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=118}}}} Page played the Telecaster through a [[Supro]] amplifier, and used a [[Gibson J-200]] for the album's acoustic tracks. For &quot;[[#Track listing|Your Time Is Gonna Come]]&quot; he used a Fender 10-string [[pedal steel guitar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JPinterview&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=46}}

=== Production ===
''Led Zeppelin'' was produced by Page and engineered by [[Glyn Johns]], who had known each other since they were teenagers in the suburb of [[Epsom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;recordmirror&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Boyle |first=Jules |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/legendary-producer-glyn-johns-reveals-4849210 |title=Legendary producer Glyn Johns reveals missed opportunity for unique collaboration |accessdate=7 October 2015 |newspaper=Daily Record}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Page, most of the album was recorded live, with overdubs added later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uncut09&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=I first met Jimmy on Tolworth Broadway, holding a bag of exotic fish |journal=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]] |date=January 2009 |page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page used a &quot;distance makes depth&quot; approach to production. He used natural room ambience to enhance the reverb and recording texture on the record, demonstrating the innovations in sound recording he had learned during his session days. At the time, most music producers placed microphones directly in front of the amplifiers and drums.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=15}} For ''Led Zeppelin'', Page developed the idea of placing an additional microphone some distance from the amplifier (as far as {{convert|20|ft|m|0}}) and then recording the balance between the two. Page became one of the first producers to record a band's &quot;ambient sound&quot;: the distance of a note's time-lag from one end of the room to the other.&lt;ref name=&quot;LightShade&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Tolinski |first1=Brad |last2=Di Bendetto |first2=Greg |date=January 1998 |title=Light and Shade |magazine=Guitar World}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RS2006&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gilmore |first1=Mikal |title=The Long Shadow of Led Zeppelin |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/long_shadow_of_led_zeppelin |accessdate=29 November 2017 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=28 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017054415/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/long_shadow_of_led_zeppelin |archivedate=17 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the live recording, some songs had Plant's vocals [[spill (audio)|bleed]] onto other tracks. Page later stated that this was a natural product of Plant's powerful voice, but added the leakage &quot;sounds intentional&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LightShade&quot; /&gt; On &quot;You Shook Me&quot;, Page used the &quot;[[reverse echo]]&quot; technique. It involves hearing the echo before the main sound (instead of after it), and is achieved by turning the tape over and recording the echo on a spare track, then turning the tape back over again to get the echo preceding the signal.&lt;ref name=&quot;LightShade&quot; /&gt;

This was one of the first albums to be released in stereo only. Prior to this, albums had been released in separate mono and stereo versions.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=45}}

==Composition==
{{see_also|List of Led Zeppelin songs written or inspired by others}}
The songs on ''Led Zeppelin'' came from the first group rehearsals, which were then refined on the Scandinavian tour. The group were familiar with the material when they entered Olympic to start recording, which was a key reason it was completed quickly. Plant participated in songwriting but was not given credit because of unexpired contractual obligations resulting from his association with [[Sony Music|CBS Records]].{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=47}} He was retroactively given credit on &quot;Good Times, Bad Times&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACE Repertory|url=https://www.ascap.com/repertory#ace/search/title/Good%20Times%20Bad%20Times|access-date=2020-08-12|website=www.ascap.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Your Time Is Gonna Come&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACE Repertory|url=https://www.ascap.com/repertory#ace/search/title/your%20time%20is%20gonna%20come|access-date=2020-08-12|website=www.ascap.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACE Repertory|url=https://www.ascap.com/repertory#ace/search/title/communication%20breakdown|access-date=2020-08-12|website=www.ascap.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Babe I'm Gonna Leave You&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACE Repertory|url=https://www.ascap.com/repertory#ace/search/title/Babe%20I%27m%20Gonna%20Leave%20You|access-date=2020-08-12|website=www.ascap.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;How Many More Times&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACE Repertory|url=https://www.ascap.com/repertory#ace/search/title/How%20Many%20More%20Times|access-date=2020-08-12|website=www.ascap.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Side one===
&quot;[[Good Times Bad Times]]&quot; was a commercial-sounding track that was considered as the group's debut single in the UK, and released as such in the US. As well as showcasing the whole band and their new heavy style, it featured a catchy chorus and a variety of guitar overdubs.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=45–46}} Despite being a strong track, it was seldom performed live by Led Zeppelin. One of the few occasions it was played was the [[Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert]] in 2007.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=36}}

&quot;[[Babe I'm Gonna Leave You]]&quot; was a re-arrangement of a song composed by [[Anne Bredon]] in the 1950s. Page had heard the song recorded by [[Joan Baez]] for her 1962 album ''[[Joan Baez in Concert]]''. It was one of the first numbers that he worked on with Plant when the two first met at Pangbourne in August 1968. Page played both the Gibson J-200 acoustic and Telecaster on the track. Plant originally sang the song in a heavier style, similar to other performances on the album, but was persuaded by Page to re-record it to allow some light and shade on the track.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=27}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=36}}

&quot;You Shook Me&quot; was a blues song with lyrics by [[Willie Dixon]] and fitted in with the British blues boom that was ongoing when the album was being recorded. Jones, Plant and Page took solos on [[Hammond organ]], harmonica and guitar respectively. Page put backwards echo on the track, which was then a novel production device, on the [[call and response]] between the vocal and guitar towards the end. The song had been recorded by [[Jeff Beck]] for the album ''[[Truth (Jeff Beck album)|Truth]]'' (1968) and Beck subsequently said he was unhappy about Led Zeppelin copying his arrangement.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=46}}

&quot;[[Dazed and Confused (song)|Dazed and Confused]]&quot; was written and recorded by [[Jake Holmes]] in 1967. The original album credited Page as the sole composer; Holmes sued for copyright infringement in 2010 and an out-of-court settlement was reached the following year. The Yardbirds performed the song regularly in concert during 1968, including several radio and television sessions. Their arrangement included a section where Page played the guitar with a [[violin bow]], an idea suggested by [[David McCallum Sr.]] whom Page had met while doing sessions. Page also used the guitar solo for one of the last Yardbirds recordings, &quot;Think About It&quot;. Led Zeppelin's adaptations of &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; used some different lyrics, while Jones and Bonham developed the arrangement to accommodate their playing styles.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=46}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|pp=41–42}}

The song was an important part of Led Zeppelin's live show throughout their early career, and became a vehicle for group improvisation, eventually stretching in length to over 30{{nbsp}}minutes. The improvisation would sometimes include parts of another song, including the group's &quot;The Crunge&quot; and &quot;Walter's Walk&quot; (released later on ''Houses of the Holy'' and ''Coda'', respectively), [[Joni Mitchell]]'s &quot;[[Woodstock (song)|Woodstock]]&quot; and [[Scott McKenzie]]'s &quot;[[San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)]]&quot;. It was briefly dropped from the live set in 1975 after Page injured a finger, but was re-instated for the remainder of the tour. The last full live performance during Led Zeppelin's main career was at [[Earl's Court]] in London later that year, after which the violin bow section of the song's guitar solo was played as a standalone piece. It was revived as a complete song performance for the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in 2007.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=46}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|pp=41–42}}

===Side two===
&quot;Your Time Is Gonna Come&quot; opens with Jones playing an unaccompanied organ solo, leading into the verse. Page plays acoustic and pedal steel guitar. The track has a [[Fade (audio engineering)#Crossfading|crossfade]] into &quot;Black Mountain Side&quot;, an acoustic instrumental based on [[Bert Jansch]]'s arrangement of the traditional folk song &quot;[[Down by Blackwaterside|Black Water Side]]&quot; and influenced by the folk playing of Jansch and [[John Renbourn]]. The song was regularly performed live as a medley with the Yardbirds solo guitar number &quot;White Summer&quot;.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=46}}

&quot;Communication Breakdown&quot; was built around a Page guitar riff, and one of the first tunes the group worked on. They enjoyed playing it live, and consequently it was a regular part of their set. It was played intermittently throughout the group's career, often as an encore.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=46–47}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=45}}

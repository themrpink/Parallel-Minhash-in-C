Haile Selassie also maintained cordial relations with the government of the United Kingdom through charitable gestures.  He sent aid to the British government in 1947 when Britain was affected by heavy flooding. His letter to Lord Meork, National Distress Fund, London said, &quot;even though We are busy of helping our people who didn't recover from the crises of the war, We heard that your fertile and beautiful country is devastated by the unusually heavy rain, and your request for aid. Therefore, We are sending small amount of money, about one thousand pounds through our embassy to show our sympathy and cooperation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Addis Zemen'' newspaper, 3 October 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; He also left his home in exile, [[Fairfield House, Bath]], to the City of Bath for the use of the aged in 1959.

==== 1958 famine of Tigray ====
In 1958, there was a widespread famine in the Tigray province of northern Ethiopia. Despite this, Emperor Haile Selassie refused to send significant emergency food aid, resulting in the deaths of approximately 100,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Bahru Zewde, [London: James Currey, 1991], p. 196. &quot;A History of Modern Ethiopia: 1855–1974&quot;|isbn = 0821409727|last1 = Zewde|first1 = Bahru|year = 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.sahistory.org.za/sites/default/files/file%20uploads%20/peter_gill_famine_and_foreigners_ethiopia_sincebook4you.pdf |title= Peter Gill, p.26 &amp; p.27. &quot;Famine and Foreigners: Ethiopia Since Live Aid&quot; |access-date= 4 March 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180516155623/http://www.sahistory.org.za/sites/default/files/file%20uploads%20/peter_gill_famine_and_foreigners_ethiopia_sincebook4you.pdf |archive-date= 16 May 2018 |url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Mesfin Wolde Mariam, &quot;Rural Vulnerability to Famine in Ethiopia: 1958-77&quot;|isbn = 0946688036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haile Selassie contributed Ethiopian troops to the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] peacekeeping force during the 1960 [[Congo Crisis]], to preserve Congolese integrity, per [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 143]]. On 13 December 1960, while Haile Selassie was on a state visit to Brazil, his ''[[Kebur Zabagna]]'' (Imperial Guard) forces staged [[1960 Ethiopian coup|an unsuccessful coup]], briefly proclaiming Haile Selassie's eldest son [[Amha Selassie|Asfa Wossen]] as emperor. The regular army and police forces crushed the coup d'état. The coup attempt lacked broad popular support, was denounced by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox Church]], and was unpopular with the army, [[Ethiopian Air Force|air force]] and police. Nonetheless, the effort to depose the emperor had support among students and the educated classes.&lt;ref name=zewde&gt;Zewde, Bahru (2001), ''A History of Modern Ethiopia''. Oxford: James Currey. {{ISBN|0852557868}}, pp. 220–26.&lt;/ref&gt; The coup attempt has been characterized as a pivotal moment in Ethiopian history, the point at which Ethiopians &quot;for the first time questioned the power of the king to rule without the people's consent&quot;.&lt;ref name=mammo100&gt;Mammo, Tirfe (1999), ''The Paradox of Africa's Poverty: The Role of Indigenous Knowledge.''The Red Sea Press. {{ISBN|1569020493}}, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Student populations began to empathize with the peasantry and poor and advocate on their behalf.&lt;ref name=mammo100 /&gt; The coup spurred Haile Selassie to accelerate reform, which was manifested in the form of land grants to military and police officials.

The emperor continued to be a staunch ally of the West, while pursuing a firm policy of [[decolonization]] in Africa, which was still largely under European colonial rule. The United Nations conducted a lengthy inquiry regarding Eritrea's status, with the superpowers each vying for a stake in the state's future. Britain, the administrator at the time, suggested Eritrea's partition between Sudan and Ethiopia, separating Christians and Muslims. The idea was instantly rejected by Eritrean political parties, as well as the UN.

A UN plebiscite voted 46 to 10 to have Eritrea be [[federation|federated]] with Ethiopia, which was later stipulated on 2 December 1950 in resolution 390 (V). Eritrea would have its own parliament and administration and would be represented in what had been the Ethiopian parliament and would become the federal parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN_GA_res-5&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/5/ares5.htm |title=General Assembly Resolutions 5th Session |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=16 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haile Selassie would have none of the European attempts to draft a separate Constitution under which Eritrea would be governed, and wanted his own 1955 Constitution protecting families to apply in both Ethiopia and Eritrea. In 1961 the 30-year [[Eritrean War for Independence|Eritrean Struggle for Independence]] began, followed by Haile Selassie's dissolution of the federation and shutting down of Eritrea's parliament.
[[File:Selassie_and_Nasser,_1963.jpg|thumb|Emperor Haile Selassie with President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] of [[Egypt]] in Addis Ababa for the [[Organisation of African Unity]] summit, 1963.]]
In September 1961, Haile Selassie attended the Conference of Heads of State of Government of Non-Aligned Countries in [[Belgrade]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|FPR Yugoslavia]]. This is considered to be the founding conference of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]].

In 1961, tensions between independence-minded Eritreans and Ethiopian forces culminated in the [[Eritrean War of Independence]]. The emperor declared Eritrea the fourteenth province of Ethiopia in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Haile, Semere (1987), &quot;The Origins and Demise of the Ethiopia-Eritrea Federation&quot;, ''Issue: A Journal of Opinion'', 15, pp. 9–17.&lt;/ref&gt; The war would continue for 30 years, as first Haile Selassie, then the Soviet-backed junta that succeeded him, attempted to retain Eritrea by force.

In 1963, Haile Selassie presided over the formation of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU), the precursor of the continent-wide [[African Union]] (AU). The new organization would establish its headquarters in [[Addis Ababa]]. In May of that year, Haile Selassie was elected as the OAU's first official chairperson, a rotating seat. Along with [[Modibo Keïta]] of Mali, the Ethiopian leader would later help successfully negotiate the Bamako Accords, which brought an end to the border conflict between [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]].  In 1964, Haile Selassie would initiate the concept of the [[United States of Africa]], a proposition later taken up by [[Muammar Gaddafi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jimmatimes.com/article/Latest_News/Latest_News/Ethiopia_New_African_un1on_Building_and_Kwame_Statue_Video/34060 |title=&quot;Ethiopia: New African Union Building and Kwame Statue&quot; (Video) |accessdate=24 April 2014 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615065602/http://jimmatimes.com/article/Latest_News/Latest_News/Ethiopia_New_African_un1on_Building_and_Kwame_Statue_Video/34060 |archivedate=15 June 2012  }}.

On 4 October 1963, Haile Selassie addressed the General Assembly of the United Nations&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, Sam Pope (5 October 1963), [https://www.nytimes.com/1963/10/05/archives/selassie-at-un-recalls-1936-plea-to-league-says-equality-of-all-is.html Selassie, at U.N., Recalls 1936 Plea to League], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.unmultimedia.org/s/photo/detail/844/0084497.html | work = Emperor of Ethiopia Addresses General Assembly | title = Photo # 84497 | publisher = United Nations | place = New York | date = 4 October 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring in his address to his earlier speech to the League of Nations:
{{Quote |Twenty-seven years ago, as Emperor of Ethiopia, I mounted the rostrum in Geneva, Switzerland, to address the League of Nations and to appeal for relief from the destruction which had been unleashed against my defenceless nation, by the fascist invader. I spoke then both to and for the conscience of the world. My words went unheeded, but history testifies to the accuracy of the warning that I gave in 1936. Today, I stand before the world organization which has succeeded to the mantle discarded by its discredited predecessor. In this body is enshrined the principle of collective security which I unsuccessfully invoked at Geneva. Here, in this Assembly, reposes the best – perhaps the last – hope for the peaceful survival of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Selassie's Address to the United Nations]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}[[File:Haile Selassie in suit and cloak in 1960s.jpg|thumb|upright|Emperor Haile Selassie standing in front of throne c. 1965|alt=|left]]On 25 November 1963, the emperor was among other [[heads of state]], including France's President [[Charles de Gaulle]], who traveled to Washington, D.C., and attended the [[State funeral of John F. Kennedy|funeral of assassinated President John F. Kennedy]].

In 1966, Haile Selassie attempted to replace the historical tax system with a single progressive income tax, which would significantly weaken the nobility who had previously avoided paying most of their taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schwab |first1=Peter |title=The Tax System of Ethiopia |journal=The American Journal of Economics and Sociology |date=January 1970 |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=77–88 |jstor=3485226 |doi=10.1111/j.1536-7150.1970.tb03120.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even with alterations, this law led to a revolt in Gojjam, which was repressed although enforcement of the tax was abandoned.  Having achieved its design in undermining the tax, the revolt encouraged other landowners to defy Haile Selassie.
[[File:Haile Selassie 1963.jpg|thumb|Haile Selassie on a state visit to Washington, 1963]]

While he had fully approved and assured Ethiopia's participation in UN-approved collective security operations, including Korea and Congo, Haile Selassie drew a distinction between it and the non-UN-approved foreign intervention in [[Indochina]], consistently deploring it as needless suffering and calling for the [[Vietnam War]] to end on several occasions. At the same time he remained open toward the United States and commended it for making progress with African Americans' Civil Rights legislation in the 1950s and 1960s, while visiting the US several times during these years.

In 1967, he visited [[Montréal]], Canada, to open the Ethiopian Pavilion at the [[Expo '67]] World's Fair where he received great acclaim among other World leaders there for the occasion.

Student unrest became a regular feature of Ethiopian life in the 1960s and 1970s. [[Marxism]] took root in large segments of the Ethiopian intelligentsia, particularly among those who had studied abroad and had thus been exposed to radical and left-wing sentiments that were becoming popular in other parts of the globe.&lt;ref name=zewde /&gt; Resistance by conservative elements at the Imperial Court and Parliament, and by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, made Haile Selassie's land reform proposals difficult to implement, and also damaged the standing of the government, costing Haile Selassie much of the goodwill he had once enjoyed. This bred resentment among the peasant population. Efforts to weaken unions also hurt his image. As these issues began to pile up, Haile Selassie left much of domestic governance to his Prime Minister, [[Aklilu Habte-Wold|Aklilu Habte Wold]], and concentrated more on foreign affairs.

===1970s===
[[File:El emperador de Etiopia Haile Selassie I visita Toledo en abril de 1971. Fotografía de Eduardo Butragueño Bueno.jpg|thumb|Haile Selassie I in Toledo (Spain) in April 1971. Picture by Eduardo Butragueño.]]
Outside of Ethiopia, Haile Selassie continued to enjoy enormous prestige and respect. As the longest-serving head of state in power, he was often given precedence over other leaders at state events, such as the [[state funeral]]s of [[State funeral of John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy]] and [[Charles de Gaulle]], the summits of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], and the [[2,500 year celebration of Iran's monarchy|1971 celebration]] of the 2,500 years of the [[History of Iran|Persian Empire]]. In 1970 he visited Italy as a guest of President [[Giuseppe Saragat]], and in [[Milan]] he met [[Giordano Dell'Amore]], President of Italian Savings Banks Association.  He visited China in October 1971, and was the first foreign head of state to meet [[Mao Zedong]] following the death of Mao's designated successor [[Lin Biao]] in a plane crash in Mongolia.

Human rights in Ethiopia under Selassie's regime were poor. Civil liberties and political rights were low with [[Freedom House]] giving Ethiopia a &quot;Not Free&quot; score for both civil liberties and political rights in the last years of Selassie's rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;FH1972&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FIW%20All%20Scores%2C%20Countries%2C%201973-2012%20%28FINAL%29.xls | title = Country ratings and status, FIW 1973–2012 | accessdate = 22 August 2012 | publisher = [[Freedom House]] | year = 2012 | format = XLS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common human right abuses included imprisonment and torture of political prisoners and very poor prison conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feeding on Ethiopia's Famine&quot; /&gt; The [[Ethiopian Army|Imperial Ethiopian Army]] also carried out a number of these atrocities while fighting the Eritrean separatists.

Against that background, a group of dissident army officers instigated a creeping coup against the emperor's faltering regime.  To guard against a public backlash in favour of Haile Selassie (who was still widely revered), they contrived to obtain a copy of ''The Unknown Famine'' which they intercut with images of Africa's grand old man presiding at a wedding feast in the grounds of his palace. Retitled ''The Hidden Hunger'', this [[film noir]] was shown around the clock on Ethiopian television to coincide with the day that they finally summoned the nerve to seize the emperor himself.

The crisis was exacerbated by military mutinies and high [[oil prices]], the latter a result of the [[1973 oil crisis]]. The international economic crisis triggered by the oil crisis caused the costs of imported goods, gasoline, and food to skyrocket, while unemployment spiked.&lt;ref name=mammo /&gt;

====Revolution====
In February 1974, four days of serious riots in Addis Ababa against a sudden economic inflation left five dead. The emperor responded by announcing on national television a reduction in petrol prices and a freeze on the cost of basic commodities. This calmed the public, but the promised 33% military wage hike was not substantial enough to pacify the army, which then mutinied, beginning in [[Asmara]] and spreading throughout the empire. This mutiny led to the resignation of Prime Minister [[Aklilu Habte-Wold]] on 27 February 1974.&lt;ref name=evang&gt;Launhardt, Johannes (2005). ''Evangelicals in Addis Ababa (1919–1991)''.

Despite Endalkatchew's many concessions, discontent continued in March with a four-day general strike that paralyzed the nation.

====Imprisonment====

==Descendants==
[[File:SelassiesSon.jpg|thumb|[[Prince Makonnen]], son of Haile Selassie I]]
By [[Menen Asfaw]], Haile Selassie had six children: [[Princess Tenagnework]], [[Crown Prince]] [[Amha Selassie|Asfaw Wossen]], [[Princess Zenebework]], [[Princess Tsehai]], [[Prince Makonnen]], and [[Prince Sahle Selassie]].

There is some controversy about Haile Selassie's eldest daughter's motherhood, [[Princess Romanework]]. While the living members of the royal family state that Romanework is the eldest daughter of Empress Menen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afronord.tripod.com/him/page8.html |title=Granddaughter Esther Selassie's website genealogy |publisher=Afronord.tripod.com |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been asserted that Princess Romanework is actually the daughter of a previous union of the emperor with a ''Woizero'' Altayech.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mockler|Mockler]], p. xxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; This may be a nickname she used, as nobleman ''Blata'' Merse Hazen Wolde Kirkos, a contemporary source prominent in both the Imperial Court and the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] names her as ''Woizero'' Woinetu Amede. The emperor's own autobiography makes no mention of this previous marriage or having fathered children with anyone other than Empress Menen. However, he mentions the death of this daughter in captivity at Turin.  Other sources such as ''Blata'' Merse Hazen Wolde Kirkos mentions Princess Romanework's mother ''Woizero'' Woinetu Amede as attending the wedding of her daughter to ''Dejazmatch'' Beyene Merid in a firsthand account in his book about the years before the Italian occupation.

Prince Asfaw Wossen was first married to Princess [[Wolete Israel Seyoum]] and then following their divorce to Princess [[Medferiashwork Abebe]]. Prince Makonnen was married to Princess [[Sara Gizaw]]. Prince Sahle Selassie was married to Princess [[Mahisente Habte Mariam]]. Princess Romanework married Dejazmatch Beyene Merid. Princess Tenagnework first married Ras [[Desta Damtew]], and after she was widowed later married Ras [[Andargachew Messai]]. Princess Zenebework married Dejazmatch [[Haile Selassie Gugsa]]. Princess Tsehai married Lt. General [[Abiye Abebe]].

A public rift between some of the descendants ensued when the late Emperor's [[Patek Philippe SA|Patek Philippe]] watch came up for auction in 2017.  In the end it was sold for $2.9&amp;nbsp;million by leading international auction house [[Christie's]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/emporer-haile-selassie-patek-philippe-ref-2497-christies-record&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rastafari messiah==
{{quote | …Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.| [[Psalms]] 68:31}}

He is viewed as the messiah who will lead the peoples of Africa and the [[African diaspora]] to freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianeducation.org/migrations/rasta/rasessay.html |title=The African Diaspora, Ethiopianism, and Rastafari |publisher= Smithsonian education |accessdate= 12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His official titles are ''Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah'' and ''King of Kings of Ethiopia and Elect of God'', and his traditional lineage is thought to be from Solomon and Sheba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://debate.uvm.edu/dreadlibrary/cardillo.html |title= Haile Selassie King of Kings, Conquering Lion of the tribe of Judah |publisher=Debate.uvm.edu |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These notions are perceived by Rastafari as confirmation of the return of the messiah in the prophetic [[Book of Revelation]] in the [[New Testament]]: ''King of Kings'', ''Lord of Lords'', ''Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah,'' and ''Root of David''.

In 1961, the Jamaican government sent a delegation composed of both Rastafari and non-Rastafari leaders to Ethiopia to discuss the matter of repatriation, among other issues, with the emperor. He reportedly told the Rastafari delegation (which included [[Mortimer Planno]]), &quot;Tell the Brethren to be not dismayed, I personally will give my assistance in the matter of repatriation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Barrett | first = Leonard E. |title=The Rastafarians |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=swdaI6DfDkEC&amp;pg=PA118 |year=1988 |publisher=Beacon Press |isbn=978-0-8070-1039-6 |pages= 118–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haile Selassie visited Jamaica on 21 April 1966, and approximately one hundred thousand Rastafari from all over Jamaica descended on [[Palisadoes Airport]] in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] to greet him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dread&quot; /&gt; [[Joint (cannabis)|Spliffs]]&lt;ref&gt;Christopher John Farley, ''Before the Legend: The Rise of Bob Marley'', p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chalice (pipe)|chalices]]&lt;ref&gt;[[David Katz (author)|David Katz]], ''People Funny Boy'' ([[Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry|Lee Perry]] biography), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; were openly&lt;ref&gt;[[#Murrell|Murrell]], p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; smoked, causing &quot;a haze of [[cannabis (drug)|ganja]] smoke&quot; to drift through the air.&lt;ref&gt;David Howard, ''Kingston: A Cultural and Literary History'', p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0022.html |title=The State Visit of Emperor Haile Selassie I |publisher=Jamaica-gleaner.com |accessdate=12 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209091215/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0022.html |archivedate=9 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anguillian.com/article/articleview/2358/1/133/ &quot;Commemorating The Royal Visit by Ijahnya Christian&quot;], ''The Anguillian Newspaper'', 22 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Haile Selassie arrived at the airport but was unable to come down the airplane's mobile steps, as the crowd rushed the tarmac. He then returned into the plane, disappearing for several more minutes. Finally, Jamaican authorities were obliged to request Ras [[Mortimer Planner|Mortimer Planno]], a well-known Rasta leader, to climb the steps, enter the plane, and negotiate the emperor's descent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#White|White]], pp. 15, 210, 211.&lt;/ref&gt; Planno re-emerged and announced to the crowd: &quot;The Emperor has instructed me to tell you to be calm.

From then on, as a result of Planno's actions, the Jamaican authorities were asked to ensure that Rastafari representatives were present at all state functions attended by the emperor,&lt;ref name=Edmonds86 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Habekost /&gt; and Rastafari elders also ensured that they obtained a private audience with the emperor,&lt;ref name=Edmonds86 /&gt; where he reportedly told them that they should not emigrate to Ethiopia until they had first liberated the people of Jamaica. This dictum came to be known as &quot;[[Liberty|liberation]] before [[repatriation]]&quot;.

Haile Selassie defied expectations of the Jamaican authorities&lt;ref name=ReggaeRoutes243 /&gt; and never rebuked the Rastafari for their belief in him as the returned Jesus. Instead, he presented the movement's faithful elders with gold medallions—the only recipients of such an honor on this visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationnews.com/editorial/328181536343408.php |title=African Crossroads – Spiritual Kinsmen |accessdate=1 January 2008 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115000944/http://www.nationnews.com/editorial/328181536343408.php |archivedate=15 January 2008  }} Dr. Ikael Tafari, ''[[The Daily Nation (Barbados)|The Daily Nation]]'', 24 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#White|White]], p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; During [[People's National Party|PNP]] leader (later Jamaican Prime Minister) [[Michael Manley]]'s visit to Ethiopia in October 1969, the emperor allegedly still recalled his 1966 reception with amazement, and stated that he felt that he had to be respectful of their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Funk, Jerry  (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=k2nAaYYgPoEC&amp;pg=PA149 ''Life Is an Excellent Adventure''].

[[Rita Marley]], [[Bob Marley]]'s wife, converted to the Rastafari faith after seeing Haile Selassie on his Jamaican trip. She claimed in interviews (and in her book ''No Woman, No Cry'') that she saw a ''[[stigmata]]'' print on the palm of Haile Selassie's hand as he waved to the crowd which resembled the markings on Christ's hands from being nailed to the cross—a claim that was not supported by other sources, but was used as evidence for her and other Rastafari to suggest that Haile Selassie I was indeed their messiah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marley, Rita |title=No Woman No Cry: My Life with Bob Marley|url=https://archive.org/details/nowomannocrymyli00marle|url-access=registration |year=2004|page=[https://archive.org/details/nowomannocrymyli00marle/page/43 43]|publisher=Hyperion|isbn=978-0-7868-6867-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also influential in the conversion of Bob Marley, who then became internationally recognized. As a result, Rastafari became much better known throughout much of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rasta-man-vibration.com/rastafarian.html |title=Bob Marley the Devoted Rastafarian! |publisher=Rasta-man-vibration.com |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Marley's posthumously released song &quot;[[Iron Lion Zion]]&quot; refers to Haile Selassie.

===Selassie's position===
In a 1967 recorded interview with the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], Haile Selassie appeared to deny his alleged divinity.  In the interview Bill McNeil says:  &quot;there are millions of Christians throughout the world, your Imperial Majesty, who regard you as the reincarnation of Jesus Christ.&quot; Selassie replied in his native language:
{{Quote |I have heard of that idea. I also met certain Rastafarians. I told them clearly that I am a man, that I am mortal, and that I will be replaced by the oncoming generation, and that they should never make a mistake in assuming or pretending that a human being is emanated from a deity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spencer&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last = Spencer |first =William David|title=Dread Jesus|date=1998|publisher=SPCK Publishing|isbn=978-0-28105101-4|page= 44}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For many Rastafari the CBC interview is not interpreted as a denial of his divinity. According to Robert Earl Hood, Haile Selassie neither denied nor affirmed his divinity either way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Hood | first = Robert Earl |title=Must God Remain Greek?: Afro Cultures and God-talk|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-ceFU75KyYQC&amp;pg=PA93+ |date=January 1990|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=978-0-8006-2449-1|pages=93–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Reggae Routes: The Story of Jamaican Music'', Kevin Chang and Wayne Chen note:
{{Quote |It's often said, though no definite date is ever cited, that Haile Selassie himself denied his divinity. Former senator and ''Gleaner'' editor, Hector Wynter, tells him, during his visit to Jamaica in 1966, when he told Rastafari he was not God.  &quot;Who am I to disturb their belief?&quot; replied the emperor.&lt;ref name=ReggaeRoutes243&gt;{{cite book|author1=O'Brien Chang, Kevin  |author2=Chen, Wayne |title=Reggae Routes: The Story of Jamaican Music |url= https://archive.org/details/reggaeroutesstor00chan|url-access=registration  |year=1998|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-1-56639-629-5|page= [https://archive.org/details/reggaeroutesstor00chan/page/n254 243]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After his return to Ethiopia, he dispatched Archbishop Abuna Yesehaq Mandefro to the [[Caribbean]] to help draw Rastafari and other West Indians to the Ethiopian church and, according to some sources, denied his divinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/12/AR2006011201952.html |title= Ethiopians in D.C.

In 1948, Haile Selassie donated a piece of land at [[Shashamane]], {{convert|250|km|mi}} south of Addis Ababa, for the use of people of African descent from the West Indies. Numerous Rastafari families settled there and still live as a community to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.shashamane.org/history.htm |title= The History and Location of the Shashamane Settlement Community Development Foundation, Inc., USA |publisher= Shashamane |accessdate= 12 September 2010 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110525012620/http://www.shashamane.org/history.htm |archivedate= 25 May 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

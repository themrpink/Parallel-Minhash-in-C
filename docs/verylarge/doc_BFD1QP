The Krishna river originates in the [[Western Ghats]] near [[Mahabaleshwar]] at an elevation of about {{convert|1,300|metre}}, in the state of Maharashtra in central India. It is one of the longest rivers in India. The Krishna river is around {{convert|1400|km}} in length ({{convert|282|km}} in Maharashtra). It is one of the most suitable arable basin as 75.6 % area of the Krishna basin is under cultivation because of availability of water.
The river's source is at [[Mahabaleshwar]] near Jor village in the extreme north of Wai Taluka, Satara District, Maharashtra in the west and empties into the [[Bay of Bengal]] at [[Hamasaladeevi]] (near Koduru) in [[Andhra Pradesh]], on the east coast. It flows through the state of [[Karnataka]] before entering [[Telangana]] State. The delta of this river is one of the most fertile regions in India and was the home to ancient [[Satavahana]] and [[Ikshvaku]] [[Sun Dynasty]] kings. [[Vijayawada]] is the largest city on the Krishna.

It causes heavy soil erosion during the [[monsoon]] floods. It flows fast and furious, often reaching depths of over {{convert|75|ft|m}}. Ironically, there is a saying in Marathi: &quot;''Santh vaahate Krishnamaai''&quot;(संथ वाहते कृष्णामाई) which means &quot;quiet and slow flows Krishna&quot;. This term is used to describe that a person should be as quiet as Krishna.

In Karnataka state it also called Krishne (ಕೃಷ್ಣೆ)

In Telugu speaking states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, &quot;Krishnaveni&quot; is a common name given to a girl child, referring to the Krishna river.

Krishna Basin extends over an area of {{convert|258948|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} which is nearly 8% of the total geographical area of the country. This large basin lies in the states of [[Karnataka]] (113,271&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), [[Telangana]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] (76,252&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[Maharashtra]] (69,425&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Krishna basin status report, March 2014|url=http://india-wris.nrsc.gov.in/Publications/BasinReports/Krishna%20Basin.pdf|accessdate=27 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117020435/http://india-wris.nrsc.gov.in/Publications/BasinReports/Krishna%20Basin.pdf|archive-date= 17 November 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Krishna river rises in the Western Ghats, at an elevation of about {{convert|1337|m|ft|abbr=on}} just north of [[Mahabaleshwar]], about {{convert|64|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Arabian Sea. It flows for about {{convert|1400|km|mi|abbr=on}} and outfalls into the Bay of Bengal. The principal tributaries joining Krishna are the [[Ghataprabha River]], [[Malaprabha River]], [[Bhima River]], [[Tungabhadra River]] and [[Musi River (India)|Musi River]].

Most of this basin comprises rolling and undulating country, except for the western border, which is formed by an unbroken line of the Western Ghats. The important soil types found in the basin are black soils, red soils, laterite and lateritic soils, alluvium, mixed soils, red and black soils and saline and alkaline soils.

An average annual surface water potential of 78.1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; has been assessed in this basin. Out of this, 58.0&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is utilizable water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/IWMI_Research_Reports/PDF/pub083/RR83.pdf |title=Spatial variation in water supply and demand across river basins of India|author=IWMI Research Report 83|accessdate=23 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110834/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/IWMI_Research_Reports/PDF/pub083/RR83.pdf|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Culturable area in the basin is about {{convert|203,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, which is 10.4% of the total cultivable area of the country. As the water availability in the Krishna river was becoming inadequate to meet the water demand, [[Godavari River]] is linked to the Krishna river by commissioning the [[Polavaram Project-a National Project|Polavaram right bank canal]] with the help of Pattiseema lift scheme in the year 2015 to augment water availability to the [[Prakasam Barrage]] in Andhra Pradesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/how-the-krishna-went-dry/article22398807.ece#comments |title=How the Krishna went dry?|accessdate=13 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110834/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/IWMI_Research_Reports/PDF/pub083/RR83.pdf|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The irrigation canals of Prakasam Barrage form part of [[National Waterway 4]].

The Krishna River is spanned by several bridges along its course, some of which are listed below.

* Krishna Bridge, [[Wai, Maharashtra|Wai]], Maharashtra – This bridge, which is located in the Dharmpuri Peth area of the town of Wai, is one of the oldest bridges that were built by the British in India. It spans the Krishna over nine ''kamans'' (arches) and is made of black rock. The bridge serves as a flood mark (when the water rises to the level of the road on the bridge) for the &quot;Waikar&quot; people.
* Irwin Bridge, [[Sangli]] – This is one of the oldest, historic and largest bridges over the Krishna that were built by the British. The Irwin Bridge, which is built of reddish stone, has two passages where one can climb down to the river in the middle of its span to view the water.
* Ankali Bridge, Sangli, Maharashtra – This bridge is major link between Sangli and Kolhapur districts. At this point there are three bridge, one for railway and two for roadways. Out of two roadway bridge the one bridge in the direction towards Miraj was built in Nineteenth century under British Administration. It is still in operation. The railway bridge was constructed at the time of laying of Kolhapur to Pune rail link. The contractor for rail bridge was V. R. Ranade &amp; Sons from Pune. The construction of this railway bridge and culverts on railway route in nearby region were constructed by them in year 1882–84.
* Kudachi – [[Ugar]] Railway bridge built by the British in 1891.
* B. Soundatti Bridge, Raibag – This is also one of the oldest bridges built during the British rule. This bridge connects Maharashtra to Karnataka state.
* Tangadagi Bridge, This is one of oldest bridges that connects the Bijapur and [[Bagalkot district]]s of Karnataka. God Neelambika Temple is there at the bank of Krishna River.
Chikkapadasalagi bridge, is one of the oldest bridge built in British era connects jamakhandi and vijayapur, 
* Jambagi Bridge, Jamkhandi : Recently built bridge connects Athani , Bijapur and Jamkhandi.
* Galagali Bridge of [[Galagali]] village, Bagalkot: very important bridge that connects many towns and villages of Bagalkot and Vijayapur districts

==Floods==
In October 2009, heavy floods occurred, isolating 350 villages and leaving millions homeless,&lt;ref&gt;

The flood resulted in heavy damage to Kurnool, Mahabubnagar, Guntur, Krishna and Nalagonda Districts. The entire city of [[Kurnool]] was immersed in approximately {{convert|10|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} water for nearly 3 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atree.org/sites/default/files/book-chapters/p09%20killada%20et%20al%202012.pdf|title=Agony of Floods: Flood Induced Water Conflicts in {{sic|nolink=y|ln|dia}}|accessdate=8 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703204756/http://www.atree.org/sites/default/files/book-chapters/p09%20killada%20et%20al%202012.pdf|archive-date=3 July 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water inflow of {{convert|1110000|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}} was recorded at the Prakasam Barriage, which surpassed the previous record of {{convert|1080000|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}} recorded in the year 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiawaterportal.org/node/12731|title=Managing historic flood in the Krishna river basin in the year 2009 |accessdate=11 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026213927/http://www.indiawaterportal.org/articles/managing-historic-flood-krishna-river-basin-experience-averting-catastrophe-apwrdc|archive-date=26 October 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krishna river is the second largest east flowing river of the peninsula. The flood waters of Krishna and Godavari rivers can be fully utilized by exporting water to other east flowing peninsular rivers up to [[Vaigai River]] in [[Tamil Nadu]] by constructing a [[coastal reservoir]] on the [[Bay of Bengal]] sea area.

==Interstate water sharing==

At present, the award of [[Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal|Bachawat tribunal]] dated 31 May 1976 is applicable for sharing the water available in the river among the riparian states. The Brijesh Kumar tribunal award given on 29 November 2013 is challenged by Andhra Pradesh in the Supreme Court and the case pending since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/article2460983.ece|title= Court: do not publish KWDT-II decision|author= Hindu daily dated |accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly created state of [[Telangana]] also approached Supreme Court demanding a fresh tribunal hearing to secure its water needs on [[The Helsinki Rules on the Uses of the Waters of International Rivers|equitable basis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/tstate-wants-tribunal-to-adjudicate-water-disputes/article6194030.ece|title=T-State wants tribunal to adjudicate water disputes|accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jordan River''' or '''River Jordan''' ({{lang-ar|نَهْر الْأُرْدُنّ}}, ''Nahr al-Urdunn'', {{lang-he|נְהַר הַיַּרְדֵּן}}, ''Nahar ha-Yarden''; {{lang-syc|ܢܗܪܐ ܕܝܘܪܕܢܢ}}), also known as ''Nahr Al Sharieat'' ({{lang-ar| نهر الشريعة}}), is a {{convert|251|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} river in the [[Middle East]] that flows roughly north to south through the [[Sea of Galilee]] (Hebrew: כנרת Kinneret, Arabic: Bohayrat Tabaraya, meaning Lake of Tiberias) and on to the [[Dead Sea]]. [[Jordan]] and the [[Golan Heights]] border the river to the east, while the [[West Bank]] and [[Israel]] lie to its west. Both Jordan and the West Bank take their names from the river.

The river holds major significance in [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]] since the [[Bible]] says that the Israelites crossed it into the [[Promised Land]] and that [[Jesus of Nazareth]] [[Baptism of Jesus|was baptized]] by [[John the Baptist]] in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interfaithsustain.com/an-interfaith-look-at-the-jordan-river/|title=An Interfaith Look at the Jordan River|accessdate=16 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418195919/http://www.interfaithsustain.com/an-interfaith-look-at-the-jordan-river/|archive-date=18 April 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The Jordan River has an upper course from its sources to the Sea of Galilee, and a lower course south of the Sea of Galilee down to the Dead Sea. In traditional terminology, the upper course (or most of it) is commonly referred to as passing through the &quot;[[Hula Valley]]&quot;, as opposed to &quot;Upper Jordan Valley&quot;; the Sea of Galilee through which the river passes is a separate entity; and the term [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] is reserved for the lower course, fed by the Yarmouk and Zarqa Rivers.

Over its upper course (fed by the Hasbani River, Banias River, Dan River, and the Iyyon Stream), the river drops rapidly in a {{convert|75|km|adj=on}} run to the once large and swampy [[Hula Valley|Lake Hula]], which is slightly above [[sea level]]. Exiting the now much-diminished lake, it goes through an even steeper drop over the {{convert|25|km}} down to the Sea of Galilee, which it enters at its northern end. The Jordan deposits much of the silt it is carrying within the lake, which it leaves again near its southern tip at [[Degania Dam]]. At that point, the river is situated about 210 metres below sea level. The last {{convert|120|km|adj=on}}-long section follows what is commonly termed the &quot;Jordan Valley&quot;, which has less [[stream gradient|gradient]] (the total drop is another 210 metres) so that the river [[meander]]s before entering the [[Dead Sea]], a [[Endorheic basin|terminal lake]] about 422 metres below sea level with no outlet. Two major [[Tributary|tributaries]] enter from the east during this last section: the [[Yarmouk River]] and [[Zarqa River]].

Its section north of the Sea of Galilee is within the boundaries of Israel and forms the western boundary of the [[Golan Heights]]. South of the lake, it forms the border between the Kingdom of Jordan (to the east), and Israel (to the west).

==Etymology==
While several hypotheses for the origin of the river's name have been proposed, the most accepted is that it comes from Semitic Yard|on 'flow down' &lt;√ירד reflecting the river's declivity.&lt;ref name=&quot;rahkonen&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rahkonen |first1=Pauli Ensio Juhani |title=&quot;Canaanites&quot; or &quot;Amorites&quot;?

===Festivities===
====Easter====
On [[Good Friday]], from the early afternoon onward, the bands of the three Philharmonic Societies, separated into squads, accompany the [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|Epitaph processions]] of the city churches. Late in the afternoon, the squads come together to form one band in order to accompany the [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|Epitaph procession]] of the cathedral, while the funeral marches that the bands play differ depending on the band; the Old Philharmonic play [[Albinoni]]'s ''Adagio'', the Mantzaros play [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''Marcia Funebre'' from [[Don Carlo]], and the Capodistria play [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]]'s ''Funeral March'' and [[Angelo Mariani (conductor)|Mariani]]'s ''Sventura''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Easter&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071214202647/http://www.corfu.gr/en/culture/easter.htm Corfu city hall website on Easter festivities]&lt;/ref&gt;

On Holy Saturday morning, the three city bands again take part in the [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|Epitaph processions]] of St. Spyridon Cathedral in procession with the Saint's relics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Easter&quot;/&gt; At this point the bands play different funeral marches, with the Mantzaros playing [[Miccheli]]'s ''Calde Lacrime'', the Palia playing ''Marcia Funebre'' from [[Franco Faccio|Faccio]]'s ''[[Amleto]]'', and the Capodistria playing the ''Funeral March'' from [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Eroica]]''. This custom dates from the 19th century, when colonial administrators banned the participation of the British garrison band in the traditional Holy Friday funeral cortege. The defiant Corfiotes held the litany the following morning, and paraded the relics of St. Spyridon too, so that the administrators would not dare intervene.

The litany is followed by the celebration of the &quot;Early Resurrection&quot;; balconies in the old city are decked in bright red cloth, and Corfiotes throw down large clay pots (the ''bótides'', μπότηδες) full of water to smash on the street pavement, especially in wider areas of {{Interlanguage link multi|Liston (square){{!}}Liston|it|3=Liston}} and in an organised fashion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Easter&quot;/&gt; This is enacted in anticipation of the Resurrection of Jesus, which is to be celebrated that same night,&lt;ref name=&quot;Easter&quot;/&gt; and to commemorate [[King David]]'s phrase: &quot;Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel&quot; ([[Psalm 2]]:9).

Once the ''bótides'' commotion is over, the three bands parade the clay-strewn streets playing the famous &quot;''Graikoí''&quot; festive march.&lt;ref name=&quot;Band rivalry&quot;&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE1yagErUbQ As the Old Philharmonic concludes its marching in front of their building with a hearty rendition of the ''Graikoí'' March, the New Philharmonic appears and &quot;salutes&quot; their rivals with yet another rendition of the same march]&lt;/ref&gt; This legendary march, the anthem of the island, was composed during Venetian rule, and its lyrics urged: &quot;Greeks, never fear, we are all enslaved: you to the Turks, we to the Venetians, but one day we shall all be free&quot;. The Venetians were replaced by the French and the French by the British, and both the lyrics and the performance of the march were officially banned. The bands, however, defiantly played it on the Eve of Easter, as a token of the resurrection of the nation, and the tradition is honoured to this day.

====Ta Karnavalia====
Another venerable Corfu tradition is known as the [[Carnival]] or ''Ta Karnavalia''. Venetian in origin, festivities include a parade featuring the main attraction of ''Karnavalos'', a rather [[grotesque]] figure with a large head and smiling face, leading a diverse procession of colourful [[Float (parade)|float]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karnavalia&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071214202625/http://www.corfu.gr/en/culture/carnav.htm Corfu city hall website on Karnavalia]&lt;/ref&gt; Corfiots, young and old, dress up in colourful costumes and follow the parade, spilling out into the area's narrow streets ({{transl|grc|kantounia}}) and spreading the festivities across the city,&lt;ref name=&quot;Karnavalia&quot;/&gt; dancing and socialising. At night, dance and costume parties are traditional.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karnavalia&quot;/&gt;

Corfiotes have a long history of hospitality to foreign residents and visitors, typified in the 20th century by [[Gerald Durrell]]'s childhood reminiscence ''My Family and Other Animals''. The north east coast has largely been developed by a few British holiday companies, with large expensive holiday villas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/11/greathomesanddestinations/11iht-recorfu.html | work=The New York Times | title=Overseas Buyers Fall for Corfu's Historic Charm | first=Nick | last=Foster | date=11 September 2009 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Package holiday]] resorts exist on the north, east and southwest coasts.

At the other end of the island, the southern resort of [[Kavos]] also provides tourist facilities.

St George South to the west boasts the largest sandy beach on the island coupled with a selection of all-inclusive package hotels and traditional corfiot villas and flats. The Korission lake nature reserve also provides a stopover for European birds migrating south.

Up until the early 20th century, it was mainly visited by the European royals and elites, including Emperor [[Wilhelm II of Germany]] and [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria]]; today it is also widely visited by middle class families (primarily from the UK, [[Scandinavia]] and Germany). With the advent of the jet airliner bringing these groups relatively affordable 'package holidays', Corfu was one of the primary destinations for this new form of mass tourism &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tsartas |first1=Paris |title=Tourism Development in Greek Insular and Coastal Areas: Sociocultural Changes and Crucial Policy Issues |journal=Journal of Sustainable Tourism |date=September 2003 |volume=11 |issue=2–3 |pages=116–132 |doi=10.1080/09669580308667199|s2cid=41077364 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still popular with the ultra-wealthy however, and in the island's northeast the homeowners include members of the [[Rothschild family]] and Russian oligarchs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/6c408b7a-94ef-11e0-a648-00144feab49a.html#axzz1Z61QKNGN Nick Foster, Financial Times, Ionian rhapsody 17 June 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/sunandsea/3330651/Corfu-is-all-about-fun-not-funds-Greek-Islands.html Daily Telegraph, 3 November 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flying Dolphin in Corfu.jpg|thumb|The Flying Dolphin [[hydrofoil]] ferry near Corfu harbour. Vido island is in the foreground with the [[Albania]]n coastline in the background.]]

The island is linked by two motorways, GR-24 in the northwest and GR-25 in the south.

* Greek National Road 24, Cen., NW, Corfu – Palaiokastritsa
* Greek National Road 25, Cen., S, SE, Corfu – Lefkimi

Corfu has ferry services both by traditional ferries to Gaios in the island of [[Paxoi]] and as far as [[Patras]] and both traditional ferries and advanced retractable [[airfoil]], [[hydrodynamic]]-flow, high-speed ferries called &quot;Flying Dolphins&quot; to [[Igoumenitsa]] and [[Sarandë]] in neighbouring [[Albania]]. The small port of Lefkimmi is also to be found at the southernmost tip of the island on Cape Kavos, offering a [[ferry boat|ferry]] service to the mainland.

The [[Ioannis Kapodistrias International Airport]], named after [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], a Corfiot and European diplomat, and the first governor of the independent Greek state, is located around three kilometres south of Kerkyra, just half a kilometre north of Pontikonisi. The approach and landing, in a northeasterly direction, afford passengers aerial views of ''Pontikonisi'' and Vlaheraina Monastery, also taking in the hills of ''Kanoni'', as the runway employed for landing lies a few hundred metres from these local landmarks. The airport offers domestic flights from [[Olympic Airlines]] (OA 600, 602 and 606), and [[Aegean Airlines]] (A3 402, 404 and 406). Seaplanes, Air Sea Lines, a Greek seaplane operator, offers scheduled flights from Corfu to Paxoi, Lefkada, Ithaki, Kefalonia, [[Ioannina]], Patras and [[Brindisi]] in Italy.

The buses to the main places on the island run about six times a day between the city and Glyfada, Sidari, Paleokastritsa, Roda and Acharavi, Lefkimmi, Lefkimmi and Piri. Other coaches drive up to twice a day to Athens and Thessaloniki. City buses run through the city to the Airport, Achilleion, Gouvia, Afra, Pelekas and some other places of interest.

The [[Diapontia Islands]] are accessible by boat with regular services from Corfu port and Agios Stefanos Avliotes and by ferry from Corfu city port.

==Economy==
[[File:KoumQuatLiqueur.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Kumquat|Koum Quat]] [[liqueur]]s, produced in Corfu.]]

Corfu is mostly planted with olive groves and vineyards and has been producing olive oil and wine since antiquity. The main wine grape varietals found in Corfu are the indigenous white ''Kakotrýgēs'' and red ''Petrokóritho'', the [[Cefalonia]]n white ''Robóla'', the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] ''Moscháto'' (white [[Muscat (grape and wine)|muscat]]), the [[Achaea]]n ''Mavrodáphnē'' and others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corfiote wine&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.greekwinemakers.com/czone/regions/kerk.shtml |title= At the time of his writing, Lambert-Gocs found 1800 hectares of vines dominated mainly by white Kakotrygis and red Petrokoritho (both cultivars having both red and white versions).

Modern times have seen the introduction of specialist cultivation supported by the mild climate, like the [[kumquat]] and [[bergamot orange]]s, which are extensively used in making [[spoon sweets]] and [[liqueur]]s. Corfu also produces local animal products, such as Corfiote ''graviéra'' (a variant of [[Gruyère (cheese)|gruyere]]) and &quot;''Corfu''&quot; cheese (a variant of [[Grana (cheese)|Grana]]); &quot;Corfu butter&quot; (''Boútyro Kerkýras''), an intensely flavored cooking and baking butter made of [[ewe's milk]]; and the ''noúmboulo'' [[salami]] made of pork and lard and flavored with orange peel, oregano, thyme and other aromatic herbs, which are also burned for smoking.

Local culinary specialties include ''[[sofrito]]'' (a [[veal]] rump roast of [[Venice|Venetian]] origin), ''pastitsáda'' ([[bucatini]] pasta served with diced veal cooked in a tomato sauce), ''bourdétto'' ([[cod]] cooked in a [[Capsicum|pepper]]y sauce), ''mándoles'' (caramelized [[almonds]]), ''pastéli'' ([[honey]] bars made with [[sesame]], [[almond]]s or [[pistachio]]s), ''mandoláto'' (a &quot;pastéli&quot; made of crushed almonds, sugar, honey and [[vanilla]]), and ''tzitzibíra'', the local [[ginger beer]], a remnant of the British era. There are three breweries in Corfu and one bed layers factory.

The island has again become an important [[Port#port of call|port of call]] and has a considerable trade in olive oil.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |last1=Gardner |first1=Ernest Arthur |first2=Maximillian Otto Bismark |last2=Caspari |wstitle=Corfu |volume=7 |pages=145–146|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In earlier times there was a great export of [[Greek citron|citron]], which was cultivated here, including for ritual use in the Jewish community during the [[Sukkot]] holiday.

'''Pareto efficiency''' or '''Pareto optimality''' is a situation where no individual or preference criterion can be better off without making at least one individual or preference criterion worse off or without any loss thereof. The concept is named after [[Vilfredo Pareto]] (1848–1923), Italian engineer and economist, who used the concept in his studies of [[economic efficiency]] and [[income distribution]]. The following three concepts are closely related:

* Given an initial situation, a '''Pareto improvement''' is a new situation where some agents will gain, and no agents will lose.
* A situation is called '''Pareto dominated''' if there exists a possible Pareto improvement. 
* A situation is called '''Pareto optimal''' or '''Pareto efficient''' if no change could lead to improved satisfaction for some agent without some other agent losing or if there's no scope for further Pareto improvement.

The '''Pareto frontier''' is the set of all Pareto efficient allocations, conventionally shown [[Chart|graphically]]. It also is variously known as the '''Pareto front''' or '''Pareto set'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cenaero.be/Page.asp?docid=27103&amp;|title=Pareto Front|last=proximedia|website=www.cenaero.be|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Pareto efficiency&quot; is considered as a minimal notion of efficiency that does not necessarily result in a socially desirable distribution of resources: it makes no statement about [[Social equality|equality]], or the overall well-being of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Amartya Sen |first=A. |last=Sen |title=Markets and freedom: Achievements and limitations of the market mechanism in promoting individual freedoms |journal=Oxford Economic Papers |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=519–541 |date=October 1993 |jstor=2663703 |url=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr06/cos444/papers/sen.pdf |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.oep.a042106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=N. |last=Barr |author-link=Nicholas Barr|chapter=3.2.2 The relevance of efficiency to different theories of society |title=Economics of the Welfare State |year=2012 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-929781-8 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=DOg0BM1XiqQC&amp;pg=PA46 46–49] |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46–49}}

In addition to the context of efficiency in ''allocation'', the concept of Pareto efficiency also arises in the context of [[productive efficiency|''efficiency in production'']] vs. ''[[x-inefficiency]]'': a set of outputs of goods is Pareto efficient if there is no feasible re-allocation of productive inputs such that output of one product increases while the outputs of all other goods either increase or remain the same.&lt;ref&gt;[[John D. Black|Black, J. D.]], Hashimzade, N., &amp; [[Gareth Myles|Myles, G.]], eds., ''A Dictionary of Economics'', 5th ed. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2017), [https://books.google.com/books?id=WyvYDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT459 p. 459].&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|459}}

Besides economics, the notion of Pareto efficiency has been applied to the selection of alternatives in [[engineering]] and [[biology]]. Each option is first assessed, under multiple criteria, and then a subset of options is ostensibly identified with the property that no other option can categorically outperform the specified option.  It is a statement of impossibility of improving one variable without harming other variables in the subject of [[multi-objective optimization]] (also termed '''Pareto optimization''').

== Overview ==

Formally, an allocation is Pareto optimal if there is no alternative allocation where improvements can be made to at least one participant's well-being without reducing any other participant's well-being. If there is a transfer that satisfies this condition, the new reallocation is called a &quot;Pareto improvement&quot;. When no Pareto improvements are possible, the allocation is a &quot;Pareto optimum&quot;.

The formal presentation of the concept in an economy is the following: Consider an economy with &lt;math&gt; n&lt;/math&gt; agents and &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; goods. Then an allocation &lt;math&gt; \{x_1, ..., x_n\} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; x_i \in \mathbb{R}^k &lt;/math&gt; for all ''i'', is ''Pareto optimal'' if there is no other feasible allocation &lt;math&gt; \{x_1', ..., x_n'\} &lt;/math&gt; where, for utility function &lt;math&gt; u_i &lt;/math&gt; for each agent &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; u_i(x_i') \geq u_i(x_i) &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; i \in \{1, ..., n\} &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; u_i(x_i') &gt; u_i(x_i) &lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt; i&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AndreuMas95&quot;&gt;{{citation|author-link=Andreu Mas-Colell|last1=Mas-Colell|first1=A.|first2=Michael D.|last2=Whinston|first3=Jerry R.|last3=Green|year=1995|title=Microeconomic Theory|chapter=Chapter 16: Equilibrium and its Basic Welfare Properties|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510268-0|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780198089537}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, in this simple economy, &quot;feasibility&quot; refers to an allocation where the total amount of each good that is allocated sums to no more than the total amount of the good in the economy. In a more complex economy with production, an allocation would consist both of consumption [[Vector space|vector]]s and production vectors, and feasibility would require that the total amount of each consumed good is no greater than the initial endowment plus the amount produced.

Under the assumptions of the [[first welfare theorem]], a [[competitive market]] leads to a Pareto-efficient outcome. This result was first demonstrated mathematically by economists [[Kenneth Arrow]] and [[Gérard Debreu]].{{cn|date=November 2020}} However, the result only holds under the assumptions of the theorem: markets exist for all possible goods, there are no [[externality|externalities]]; markets are perfectly competitive; and market participants have [[perfect information]].

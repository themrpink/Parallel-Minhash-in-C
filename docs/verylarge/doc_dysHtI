{{Sociology}}
The term '''discourse''' (L. ''discursus'', “running to and fro”) identifies and describes written and spoken [[communication]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Compact Oxford Dictionary, Thesaurus and Wordpower Guide [2001], Oxford University Press, New York&lt;/ref&gt; In [[semantics]] and [[discourse analysis]], a discourse is a conceptual generalization of [[conversation]]. In a field of enquiry and social practice, the discourse is the vocabulary (codified language) for investigation of the subject, e.g. legal discourse, medical discourse, religious discourse, et cetera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Larry|last=Marks|title=A Little Glossary of Semantics|url=http://www.revue-texto.net/Reperes/Glossaires/Glossaire_en.html#discourse|access-date=25 May 2011|date=June 2001|publisher=revue-texto.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the works of the philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], a ''discourse'' is “an entity of sequences, of signs, in that they are enouncements (''énoncés'').”&lt;ref name=Foucault1969&gt;{{Cite book| author = M. Foucault| year = 1969| title = L'Archéologie du savoir| location = Paris| publisher = Éditions Gallimard| author-link = M. Foucault}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''enouncement''' (''l’énoncé'', “the statement”) is a linguistic construct that allows the writer and the speaker to assign meaning to words and to communicate repeatable semantic relations to, between, and among the statements, objects, or subjects of the discourse.&lt;ref name=Foucault1969 /&gt; There exist internal relations among the signs (semiotic sequences) that are between and among the statements, objects, or subjects of the discourse. The term '''discursive formation''' identifies and describes written and spoken statements with semantic relations that produce discourses. As a researcher, Foucault applied the discursive formation to analyses of large bodies of knowledge, e.g [[political economy]] and [[natural history]].&lt;ref name=Foucault1970&gt;{{Cite book|author= M. Foucault| title=The Order of Things|year=1970| publisher=Pantheon Books|isbn= 0-415-26737-4|author-link= M. Foucault}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first sense-usage (semantics and discourse analysis), the term ''discourse'' is a field of research in [[corpus linguistics]]. In the second sense-usage (codified vocabulary), and in the third sense-usage (a statement) the analyses of ''discourse'' identify and determine the existing semantic relations among [[language]] and [[structure and agency]], as in [[sociology]], [[feminist studies]], and [[anthropology]], [[ethnography]] and [[cultural studies]], [[literary theory]] and the [[philosophy of science]]. A Discourse is a text for communicating data, information, and knowledge, composed of internally related statements. The term '''[[interdiscourse]]''' identifies and describes the external semantic relations among discourses, because a discourse exists in relation to other discourses, e.g. books of history; thus do academic researchers debate and determine “What is a discourse?” and “What is not a discourse?” in accordance with the denotations and connotations (meanings) used in their academic disciplines.&lt;ref name=Foucault1970&gt;{{Cite book|author= M. Foucault| title=The Order of Things|year=1970| publisher=Pantheon Books|isbn= 0-415-26737-4|author-link= M. Foucault}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Definition ==
In the course of [[Research|intellectual enquiry]], discourse among researchers usually features the questions and answers to: ''What is a discourse?'' and ''What is not a discourse?'' asked and answered in accordance with the meanings ([[denotation]] and [[connotation]]) of the statements (concepts) used in the given academic discipline, such as [[anthropology]], [[ethnography]], and [[sociology]], [[cultural studies]] and [[literary theory]], the [[philosophy of science]] and [[feminism]].

=== Semantics and Discourse Analysis ===
In [[semantics]], and the more-general [[discourse analysis]], ''discourse'' is a conceptual generalization of [[conversation]] within each [[Modality (semiotics)|modality]] and [[context (language use)|context]] of communication. In this sense, the term is studied in [[corpus linguistics]], the [[study of language]] expressed in ''[[Text corpus|corpora]]'' (samples) of &quot;real world&quot; text.

The study of semantics particularizes ''discourse'' as meaning the totality of codified language (i.e., vocabulary) used in a given field of intellectual enquiry and of social practice, such as legal discourse, medical discourse, religious discourse, etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revue-texto.net/Reperes/Glossaires/Glossaire_en.html#discourse|title=A Little Glossary of Semantics|date=June 2001|editor-last=Rastier|editor-first=Francois|website=Texto! Textes &amp; Cultures|publisher=Institut Saussure|language=fr|type=Electronic journal|others=Translated by Larry Marks|issn=1773-0120|access-date=5 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, along with that of Foucault's in the previous section, the analysis of a ''discourse'' examines and determines the connections among [[language]] and [[structure and agency]].

Moreover, because a discourse is a body of text meant to communicate specific data, information, and knowledge, there exist internal relations in the content of a given discourse, as well as external relations among discourses. As such, a discourse does not exist ''per se'' (in itself), but is related to other discourses, by way of inter-discursive practices.

In [[Formal semantics (linguistics)|'''formal semantics''']], [[discourse representation theory]] describes the [[Formal semantics (linguistics)|formal semantics]] of a sentence using [[predicate logic]].&lt;ref&gt;Muskens, Reinhard. &quot;[https://pure.uvt.nl/ws/files/180683/COMBININ.PDF Combining Montague semantics and discourse representation].&quot; Linguistics and philosophy 19.2 (1996): 143-186.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social Sciences and Humanities===
In the general '''[[humanities]]''' and '''[[social science]]s,''' discourse describes a formal way of thinking that can be expressed through language. Discourse is a social boundary that defines what statements can be said about a topic. Many definitions of discourse are largely derived from the work of French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]]. In '''[[sociology]]''', ''discourse'' is defined as &quot;any practice (found in a wide range of forms) by which individuals imbue reality with meaning&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruiz|first=Jorge R.|date=2009-05-30|year=2009|title=Sociological discourse analysis: Methods and logic|url=http://www.qualitative-research.net/index.php/fqs/article/view/1298/2882|journal=Forum: Qualitative Social Research|volume=10|issue=2|pages=Article 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Political science]]''' sees discourse as closely linked to politics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discourses.org/OldArticles/Politics,%20Ideology%20and%20Discourse.pdf |title=Politics, Ideology, and Discourse |access-date=2019-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://discourses.org/OldArticles/What%20is%20Political%20Discourse%20Analysis.pdf |title=What is Political Discourse Analysis? |last=van Dijk |first=Teun A. |access-date=2020-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and policy making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Does discourse matter? Discourse analysis in environmental policy making |journal=Journal of Environmental Policy &amp; Planning |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=161–173 |doi=10.1080/15239080500339638 |year=2005 |last1=Feindt |first1=Peter H.|last2=Oels |first2=Angela|s2cid=143314592 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, different theories among various disciplines understand discourse as linked to [[Power (social and political)|power]] and [[State (polity)|state]], insofar as the control of ''discourses'' is understood as a hold on reality itself (e.g. if a state controls the media, they control the &quot;truth&quot;). In essence, ''discourse'' is inescapable, since any use of language will have an effect on individual perspectives. In other words, the chosen discourse provides the vocabulary, expressions, and, perhaps, even the [[Stylistics (linguistics)|style]] needed to communicate. For example, two notably distinct discourses can be used about various [[guerrilla]] movements, describing them either as &quot;[[Resistance movement|freedom fighters]]&quot; or &quot;[[terrorists]]&quot;. 

In '''[[psychology]]''', discourses are embedded in different rhetorical genres and meta-genres that constrain and enable them—language talking about language. This is exemplified in the [[American Psychiatric Association|APA]]'s ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'', which tells of the terms that have to be used in speaking about mental health, thereby mediating meanings and dictating practices of professionals in psychology and psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;Schryer, Catherine F., and Philippa Spoel. 2005. &quot;Genre theory, health-care discourse, and professional identity formation.&quot; ''[[Journal of Business and Technical Communication]]'' 19: 249. Retrieved from [http://jbt.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/19/3/249 SAGE].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernism==
[[Modernism|Modern theorists]] were focused on achieving progress and believed in the existence of natural and social laws which could be used universally to develop knowledge and thus a better understanding of society.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;Larrain, Jorge. 1994. ''Ideology and Cultural Identity: Modernity and the Third World Presence''. Cambridge: [[Polity Press]]. {{ISBN|9780745613154}}. Retrieved via [https://books.google.ca/books/about/Ideology_and_Cultural_Identity.html?id=p3C1tAEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; Such theorists would be preoccupied with obtaining the &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;reality&quot;, seeking to develop theories which contained certainty and predictability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Best &amp; Kellner, 1991&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Best|first=Steven|title=The Postmodern Turn|last2=Kellner|first2=Douglas|publisher=[[The Guilford Press]]|year=1997|isbn=978-1-57230-221-1|location=New York City|author-link=Steven Best|author-link2=Douglas Kellner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modernist theorists therefore viewed discourse as being relative to talking or way of talking and understood discourse to be functional.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strega, 2005&quot;&gt;Strega, Susan. 2005. &quot;The View from the Poststructural Margins: Epistemology and Methodology Reconsidered.&quot; Pp. 199–235 in ''Research as Resistance'', edited by L. Brown, &amp; S. Strega. Toronto: Canadian Scholars' Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Discourse and language transformations are ascribed to progress or the need to develop new or more &quot;accurate&quot; words to describe new discoveries, understandings, or areas of interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strega, 2005&quot;/&gt; In modern times, language and discourse are dissociated from power and ideology and instead conceptualized as &quot;natural&quot; products of common sense usage or progress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strega, 2005&quot;/&gt; [[Modernism]] further gave rise to the liberal discourses of rights, equality, freedom, and justice; however, this rhetoric masked substantive inequality and failed to account for differences, according to Regnier.&lt;ref&gt;Regnier, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structuralism (Saussure &amp; Lacan)==
[[Structuralism|Structuralist]] theorists, such as [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and [[Jacques Lacan]], argue that all human actions and social formations are related to [[language]] and can be understood as systems of related elements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howarth, 2000&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Howarth|first=D.|title=Discourse|publisher=[[Open University Press]]|year=2000|isbn=978-0-335-20070-2|location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the &quot;individual elements of a system only have significance when considered in relation to the structure as a whole, and that structures are to be understood as self-contained, self-regulated, and self-transforming entities&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howarth, 2000&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|17}} In other words, it is the structure itself that determines the significance, meaning and function of the individual elements of a system. Structuralism has made an important contribution to our understanding of language and social systems.&lt;ref&gt;Sommers, Aaron. 2002. &quot;[http://www-ssg.sr.unh.edu/preceptorial/Summaries_2002/summary3_2002.html Discourse and Difference].&quot; ''Cosmology and our View of the World, [[University of New Hampshire]]''. Seminar summary.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Course in General Linguistics|Saussure's theory of language]] highlights the decisive role of meaning and signification in structuring human life more generally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howarth, 2000&quot;/&gt;

==Poststructuralism (Foucault)==
Following the perceived limitations of the modern era, emerged [[postmodernism|postmodern]] theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Postmodern theorists rejected modernist claims that there was one theoretical approach that explained all aspects of society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Best &amp; Kellner, 1991&quot;/&gt; Rather, postmodernist theorists were interested in examining the variety of experience of individuals and groups and emphasized differences over similarities and common experiences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strega, 2005&quot;/&gt;

In contrast to modern theory, postmodern theory is more fluid, allowing for individual differences as it rejects the notion of social laws. Such theorists shifted away from truth-seeking, and instead sought answers for how truths are produced and sustained. Postmodernists contended that truth and knowledge is plural, contextual, and historically-produced through discourses. Postmodern researchers therefore embarked on analyzing discourses such as texts, language, policies, and practices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strega, 2005&quot;/&gt;

=== Michel Foucault ===
In ''[[The Archaeology of Knowledge]]'' (1969), a treatise about the [[methodology]] and [[historiography]] of systems of thought (“epistemes”) and of knowledge (“discursive formations”), [[Michel Foucault]] developed the concepts of discourse. The sociologist Iara Lessa summarizes Foucault's definition of discourse as &quot;systems of thoughts composed of ideas, attitudes, courses of action, beliefs, and practices that systematically construct the subjects and the worlds of which they speak.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Lessa | first = Iara | title=Discursive Struggles within Social Welfare: Restaging Teen Motherhood | journal=The British Journal of Social Work|volume=36|issue=2|pages=283–298|doi=10.1093/bjsw/bch256|date=February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault traces the role of discourse in the [[legitimation]] of society’s [[Power (social and political)|power]] to construct contemporary truths, to maintain said truths, and to determine what relations of power exist among the constructed truths; therefore discourse is a communications medium through which power relations produce men and women who can speak.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strega, 2005&quot; /&gt;

The inter-relation between power and knowledge renders every human relationship into a power negotiation,&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. ''Power/Knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings, 1972–1977'' (1980) New York City: Pantheon Books.&lt;/ref&gt; because power is always present and so produces and constrains the truth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strega, 2005&quot; /&gt; Power is exercised through rules of exclusion (discourses) that determine what subjects people can discuss; when, where, and how a person may speak; and determines which persons are allowed speak.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foucault1969&quot; /&gt; That knowledge is both the ''creator'' of power and the ''creation'' of power, Foucault coined the term ''[[power-knowledge]]'' to show that an object becomes a &quot;node within a network&quot; of meanings. In ''The Archaeology of Knowledge'', Foucault’s example is a book's function as a [[Vertex (graph theory)|node]] within a network meanings. The book does not exist as an individual object, but exists as part of a structure of knowledge that is &quot;a system of references to other books, other texts, other sentences.&quot; In the critique of power–knowledge, Foucault identified [[Neo-liberalism]] as a discourse of political economy which is conceptually related to [[governmentality]], the organized practices (mentalities, rationalities, techniques) with which people are governed.&lt;ref&gt;“Governmentality”, ''A Dictionary of Geography'' (2004) Susan Mayhew, Ed., Oxford University Press, p. 0000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. ''The Birth of Biopolitics: Lectures at the Collège de France, 1978–1979'' (2008) New York: Palgrave MacMillan, pp. 0000.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Georg Major.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Georg Major from the ''Warhaffte Bildnis etlicher Hochloeblichen Fuersten vnd Herrn'', 1562]]
'''George Major'''  (April 25, 1502 &amp;ndash; November 28, 1574) was a [[Lutheran]]  theologian of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. He was born in [[Nuremberg]] and died at [[Wittenberg]].

==Life==
At the age of nine Major was sent to Wittenberg, and in 1521 entered the  university there. When Cruciger returned to  Wittenberg in 1529, Major was appointed rector of the Johannisschule in [[Magdeburg]], but in 1537 he  became court preacher at Wittenberg and was  ordained by [[Martin Luther]].

In 1545 he was made professor in the theological faculty, in which his authority increased to such an extent that in the following year the elector sent him to the  [[Conference of Regensburg]], where he was soon captivated by the personality of [[Butzer]]. Like [[Philipp Melanchthon]], he fled before the  disastrous close of the [[Schmalkald war]], and found refuge in Magdeburg. In the summer of 1547, he returned to Wittenberg, and in the same year became cathedral superintendent at [[Merseburg]], although he resumed his activity at the university in the following year.

In the negotiations of the [[Augsburg Interim]], he took the part of Melanchthon in first  opposing it and then making concessions. This attitude incurred the enmity of the opponents of the Interim, especially after he cancelled a number of passages in the second edition of his ''Psalterium'' in which he had violently attacked the position of [[Maurice, Elector of Saxony]], whom he now requested to prohibit all polemical treatises proceeding from Magdeburg, while he condemned the preachers of Torgau who were imprisoned in Wittenberg on  account of their opposition to the Interim. He was even accused of accepting bribes from Maurice.

In 1552, Count Hans Georg, who favored the Interim, appointed him superintendent of [[Eisleben]], on the recommendation of [[Melchior Kling]]. The orthodox clergy of the County of [[Mansfeld]], however, immediately suspected him of being an interimist and adiaphorist, and he tried to defend his position in public, but his apology resulted in a dispute called the [[Majoristic Controversy]].

At [[Christmas]], 1552, Count Albrecht expelled him without trial and he fled to Wittenberg, where he resumed his activity as professor and member of the Wittenberg [[Consistory (Protestantism)|Consistory]]. Thence forth he was an important and active member in the circle of the Wittenberg [[Philippists]].

From 1558 to 1574 he was dean of the theological faculty and repeatedly held the rectorate of the university. He lived long enough to experience the first overthrow of [[Crypto-Calvinism]] in the [[Electorate of Saxony]], and Paul Crell, his son-in-law, signed for him at Torgau in May 1574 the articles which repudiated [[Calvinism]] and acknowledged the unity of Luther and Melanchthon.

==Works==
Among his writings, special mention may be made of the  following:

* A text edition of ''Justini ex Trogo Pompejo historia'' (Hagenau, 1526);
* an edition of Luther's smaller catechism in Latin and Low German (Magdeburg, 1531);
* ''Sententiae veterum poetarum'' (1534);
* ''Quaestiones rhetoricae'' (1535);
* ''Vita Patrum'' (Wittenberg, 1544);
* ''Psalterium Davidis juxta translationem veterem repurgatum'' (1547);
* ''De origine et auctoritate verbi Dei'' (1550);
* ''Commonefactio ad ecclesiam catholicam, orthodoxam, de fugiendis . . . blasphemiis Samosatenicis'' (1569);

as well as  commentaries on the Pauline epistles and homilies on the pericopes.

However, [[Jerome Clark]] wrote that Fort was &quot;essentially a [[Satire|satirist]] hugely [[skeptical]] of human beings'—especially scientists'—claims to ultimate knowledge&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerome Clark|Clark, Jerome]]: &quot;The Extraterrestrial Hypothesis in the Early UFO Age&quot; in ''UFOs and Abductions: Challenging the Borders of Knowledge'', edited David M. Jacobs, University Press of Kansas: 2000 ({{ISBN|0-7006-1032-4}}), p. 123. See [[Pyrrhonism]] for a similar type of skepticism.&lt;/ref&gt; Clark described Fort's writing style as a &quot;distinctive blend of mocking humor, penetrating insight, and calculated outrageousness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Jerome: ''The UFO Book'', Visible Ink: 1998, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Fort was skeptical of sciences and wrote his own mocking explanations to defy scientists who used traditional methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReadersDigest&quot;/&gt;

In a review for ''Lo!'', ''The New York Times'' wrote: &quot;Reading Fort is a ride on a comet; if the traveler returns to earth after the journey, he will find, after his first dizziness has worn off, a new and exhilarating emotion that will color and correct all his future reading of less heady scientific literature.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;shipley&quot;/&gt;

===Fortean phenomena===

Examples of the odd phenomena in Fort's books include many occurrences of the sort variously referred to as [[occult]], [[supernatural]], and [[paranormal]]. Reported events include [[teleportation]] (a term Fort is generally credited with inventing),&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Mostly in this book I shall specialize upon indications that there exists a transportory force that I shall call Teleportation.&quot; in [http://www.sacred-texts.com/fort/lo/lo02.htm Fort. C. ''Lo!''] at Sacred Texts.com. Retrieved January 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;less well-known is the fact that Charles Fort coined the word in 1931&quot; in Rickard, B. and Michell, J. ''Unexplained Phenomena: a Rough Guide special'' (Rough Guides, 2000 ({{ISBN|1-85828-589-5}}), p. 3)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raining animals|falls of frogs, fishes, and inorganic materials]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ReadersDigest&quot;/&gt; [[spontaneous human combustion]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ReadersDigest&quot;/&gt; [[ball lightning]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ReadersDigest&quot;/&gt; (a term explicitly used by Fort), [[poltergeist]] events, [[List of unexplained sounds|unaccountable noises]] and explosions, [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitation]], [[unidentified flying object]]s, [[List of people who disappeared mysteriously|unexplained disappearances]], [[Unidentified submerged object|giant wheels of light in the oceans]], and animals found outside their normal ranges (see [[phantom cat]]). &lt;!--Fort does not seem to have mentioned crop circles in his works, see http://www33.brinkster.com/cropcircles/askpoppy.html--&gt; He offered many reports of [[out-of-place artifact]]s (OOPArts), strange items found in unlikely locations. He was also perhaps the first person to explain strange human appearances and disappearances by the hypothesis of [[alien abduction]] and was an early proponent of the [[extraterrestrial hypothesis]], specifically suggesting that strange lights or objects sighted in the skies might be alien spacecraft.

===Forteans===
Fort's work has inspired some people to consider themselves &quot;Forteans&quot;. The first of these was the screenwriter Ben Hecht, who in a review of ''The Book of the Damned'', declared, &quot;I am the first disciple of Charles Fort&amp;nbsp;... henceforth, I am a Fortean.&quot; Among Fort's other notable fans were [[John Cowper Powys]], [[Sherwood Anderson]], [[Clarence Darrow]], and [[Booth Tarkington]], who wrote the foreword to ''New Lands''.

Precisely what is encompassed by the term &quot;Fortean&quot; is a matter of great debate; the term is widely applied to people ranging from Fortean purists dedicated to Fort's methods and interests, to those with open and active acceptance of the actuality of paranormal phenomena, a belief with which Fort may not have agreed. Most generally, Forteans have a wide interest in unexplained phenomena, concerned mostly with the natural world, and have a developed &quot;agnostic [[scepticism]]&quot; regarding the anomalies they note and discuss. For Hecht, as an example, being a Fortean meant hallowing a pronounced distrust of authority in all its forms, whether religious, scientific, political, philosophical, or otherwise. It did not, of course, include an actual belief in the anomalous data enumerated in Fort's works.

The Fortean Society was initiated at the Savoy-Plaza Hotel in New York City on January 26, 1931, by some of Fort's friends, including such significant writers as Hecht, [[Theodore Dreiser]], and [[Alexander Woollcott]], and organized by fellow American writer [[Tiffany Thayer]], half in earnest and half in the spirit of great good humor, like the works of Fort himself. The board of founders included Dreiser, Hecht, Tarkington, Powys, [[Aaron Sussman]], former ''Puck'' editor [[Harry Leon Wilson]], Woollcott and [[J. David Stern]], publisher of ''[[The Philadelphia Record]]''. Active members of the Fortean Society included prominent science-fiction writers such as [[Eric Frank Russell]] and [[Damon Knight]]. Fort, however, rejected the Society and refused the presidency, which went to his friend Dreiser; he was lured to its inaugural meeting by false [[telegram]]s. As a strict non-authoritarian, Fort refused to establish himself as an authority, and further objected on the grounds that those who would be attracted by such a group would be spiritualists, zealots, and those opposed to a science that rejected them; it would attract those who ''believed'' in their chosen phenomena—an attitude exactly contrary to Forteanism. Fort did hold unofficial meetings and had a long history of getting together informally with many of New York City's literati such as Dreiser and Hecht at their apartments where they would talk, have a meal and then listen to brief reports.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The magazine ''[[Fortean Times]]'' (first published in November 1973) is a proponent of Fortean journalism, combining humour, scepticism, and serious research into subjects which scientists and other respectable authorities often disdain. Another such group is the International Fortean Organization (INFO). INFO was formed during the early 1960s (incorporated in 1965) by brothers, the writers Ron and Paul Willis, who acquired much of the material of the Fortean Society, which had largely ceased by 1959 with the death of Tiffany Thayer. INFO publishes the ''INFO Journal: Science and the Unknown'' and organizes the FortFest, the world's first continuously running conference on anomalous phenomena dedicated to the spirit of Charles Fort. INFO, since the mid-1960s, also provides audio CDs and filmed DVDs of notable conference speakers, including [[Colin Wilson]], [[John Michell (writer)|John Michell]], [[Graham Hancock]], [[John Anthony West]], [[William Corliss]], [[John Keel]], and [[Joscelyn Godwin]]. Other notable Fortean societies include the [[London Fortean Society]], [[Edinburgh Fortean Society]] in Edinburgh and the [[Isle of Wight]].

===Scholarly evaluation===
Fort is acknowledged by religious scholars such as [[Jeffrey J. Kripal]] and Joseph P. Laycock as a pioneering theorist of the paranormal who helped define &quot;paranormal&quot; as a discursive category and provided insight into its importance in human experience. Although Fort is consistently critical of the scientific study of abnormal phenomena, he remains relevant today for those who engage in such studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReadersDigest&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laycock|first1=Joseph|title=Approaching the Paranormal|journal=Nova Religio|volume=18|issue=1|pages=5–15|jstor=10.1525/nr.2014.18.1.5|doi=10.1525/nr.2014.18.1.5|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bester, Alfred. ''The Stars My Destination'', p. 5; Orion Books; 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary influence==
More than a few modern authors of fiction and non-fiction who have written about the influence of Fort are sincere devotees of Fort. One of the most notable is British philosopher John Michell who wrote the Introduction to ''Lo!'', published by John Brown in 1996. Michell says: &quot;Fort, of course, made no attempt at defining a world-view, but the evidence he uncovered gave him an 'acceptance' of reality as something far more magical and subtly organized than is considered proper today.&quot; [[Stephen King]] also uses the works of Fort to illuminate his main characters, notably ''It'' and ''Firestarter''. In ''Firestarter'', the parents of a [[Pyrokinesis|pyrokinetically]] gifted child are advised to read Fort's ''Wild Talents'' rather than the works of baby doctor [[Benjamin Spock]]. [[Loren Coleman]] is a well-known [[Cryptozoology|cryptozoologist]], author of ''The Unidentified'' (1975) dedicated to Fort, and ''Mysterious America'', which ''Fortean Times'' termed a Fortean classic. Coleman terms himself the first Vietnam era conscientious objector to base his pacificist ideas on Fortean thoughts. Jerome Clark has described himself as a &quot;sceptical Fortean&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Magonia&quot;&gt;[http://www.magonia.demon.co.uk/arc/80/confessions.htm Confessions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224231216/http://www.magonia.demon.co.uk/arc/80/confessions.htm |date=February 24, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mike Dash]] is another Fortean, bringing his historian's training to bear on all manner of odd reports, while being careful to avoid uncritically accepting ''any'' orthodoxy, be it that of fringe devotees or mainstream science. Science-fiction writers of note including [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Heinlein]], and [[Robert Anton Wilson]] were also fans of the work of Fort. [[Alfred Bester]]'s teleportation-themed novel, ''The Stars My Destination'', pays homage to the coiner of the term by naming the first teleporter &quot;Charles Fort Jaunte&quot;.  Fort's work, of compilation and commentary on anomalous phenomena has been carried on by [[William R. Corliss]], whose self-published books and notes bring Fort's collections up to date.

In 1939 [[Eric Frank Russell]] first published the novel which became ''[[Sinister Barrier]]'', in which he names Fort explicitly as an influence. Russell included some of Fort's data in the story.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Eric Frank, ''Sinister Barrier'', Paperback Library, New York, 1966 {{ISBN?}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ivan T. Sanderson]], Scottish naturalist and writer, was a devotee of Fort's work, and referenced it heavily in several of his own books on unexplained phenomena, notably ''Things'' (1967), and ''More Things'' (1969). [[Louis Pauwels]] and [[Jacques Bergier]]'s ''[[The Morning of the Magicians]]'' was also heavily influenced by Fort's work and mentions it often. Author Donald Jeffries referenced Charles Fort repeatedly in his 2007 novel ''The Unreals''.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Joe Milutis writes a short chapter in his book ''Failure, a Writer's Life'' on Charles Fort, characterising Fort's prose as &quot;well-nigh unreadable, yet strangely exhilarating&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Milutis, J. (2012), &quot;Charles Fort&quot;, ''Failure, a Writer's Life'', Alresford: Zero Books, p. 13.{{ISBN?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The noted UK paranormalist, Fortean and ordained priest [[Lionel Fanthorpe]] presented the ''[[Fortean TV]]'' series on [[Channel 4]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} [[Paul Thomas Anderson]]'s popular movie ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'' (1999) has an underlying theme of unexplained events, taken from the 1920s and '30s works of Charles Fort. Fortean author Loren Coleman has written a chapter about this motion picture, entitled &quot;The Teleporting Animals and ''Magnolia''&quot;, in one of his recent books. The film has many hidden Fortean themes, notably &quot;falling frogs&quot;. In one scene, one of Fort's books is visible on a table in a library and there is an end credit thanking him by name.&lt;ref name=&quot;coleman&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Coleman | first = Loren | title = Mysterious America: The Ultimate Guide to the Nation's Weirdest Wonders, Strangest Spots, and Creepiest Creatures | publisher = [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | year = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011 film ''[[The Whisperer in Darkness (film)|The Whisperer in Darkness]]'', Fort is portrayed by [[Andrew Leman (actor)|Andrew Leman]].

American crime and science fiction author [[Fredric Brown]] included an excerpt from Fort's book ''Wild Talents'' at the beginning of his novel ''Compliments of a Fiend''. In that quote Fort speculated about the disappearance of two people named Ambrose and wondered &quot;was someone collecting Ambroses?&quot; Brown's novel concerns the disappearance of a character named Ambrose and the kidnapper calls himself the &quot;Ambrose collector&quot; as an obvious homage to Fort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Fredric|title=Compliments of a Fiend|publisher=blackmask.com|isbn=978-1596541221|date=2004|page=}}{{page?|date=June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Park System]] of the [[United States]] is the collection of physical properties owned or administered by the [[National Park Service]]. The collection includes all [[List of national parks of the United States|national parks]] and most [[National monument (United States)|national monuments]], as well as several other types of [[protected areas of the United States]].

As of November 2020, there are {{National Park Units}} [[List of the United States National Park System official units|units]] of the National Park System.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/national-park-system.htm|title=National Park System (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov|language=en|access-date=2020-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this number is somewhat misleading. For example, [[Denali National Park and Preserve]] is counted as two units, since the same name applies to a national park and an adjacent national preserve. Yet [[Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve]] is counted as one unit, despite its double designation. Counting methodology is rooted in the language of a park's enabling legislation.

In addition to areas of the National Park System, the National Park Service also provides technical and financial assistance to several affiliated areas authorized by Congress. Affiliated areas are marked on the lists below.

The [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP), which contains nearly 79,000 entries, is administered by the National Park Service. All historically significant park units are automatically included on the NRHP—i.e., all national historical parks and historic sites, national battlefields and military parks, and national memorials, as well as some national monuments.

National Park System units are found in all 50 states, in the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], and in the [[Insular area|U.S. territories]] of [[Guam]], the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[American Samoa]], the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]], and [[Puerto Rico]].

Nearly all units managed by the National Park Service participate in the [[National Park Passport Stamps]] program.

==National preserves==
There are 19 [[national preserve]]s in the United States. Ten are distinct stand-alone official units of the National Park System, while nine others are merely areas of distinct management policies and land-use restrictions within a larger &quot;national park and preserve&quot; or &quot;national monument and preserve&quot; that are counted as two units of the National Park System by the National Park Service. Two other sites are areas of distinct management policies and land-use restrictions within a larger park ([[Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve]] and [[Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve]]) but by statute are counted by the National Park Service as single units of the National Park System.

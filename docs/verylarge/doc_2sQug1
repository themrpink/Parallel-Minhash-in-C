In addition to natural calamities and jiedushi amassing autonomous control, the [[Huang Chao|Huang Chao Rebellion]] (874–884) resulted in the sacking of both Chang'an and Luoyang, and took an entire decade to suppress.{{sfn|Eberhard|2005|pp=189–190}} Although the rebellion was defeated by the Tang, it never recovered from that crucial blow, weakening it for future military powers to replace it. There were also large groups of bandits in the size of small armies that ravaged the countryside in the last years of the Tang. They smuggled illicit salt, ambushed merchants and [[convoy]]s, and even besieged several walled cities.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=108}}

[[Zhu Wen]], originally a salt smuggler who had served under the rebel Huang Chao, surrendered to Tang forces. By helping to defeat Huang, he was renamed [[Zhu Quanzhong]] and granted a series of rapid military promotions to military governor of Xuanwu Circuit.{{sfn|Needham|1986c|pp=320–321, footnote h}} Zhu later conquered many circuits and became the most powerful warlord. In 903 he controlled the imperial court and forced [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang]] to move the capital to Luoyang, preparing to take the throne himself. In 904 Zhu assassinated Emperor Zhaozong to replace him with the emperor's young son [[Emperor Ai of Tang]]. In 905 Zhu executed 9 brothers of Emperor Ai as well as many officials and [[Empress He (Tang dynasty)|Empress Dowager He]]. In 907 the Tang dynasty was ended when Zhu deposed Ai and took the throne for himself (known posthumously as Emperor Taizu of Later Liang). He established the [[Later Liang (Five Dynasties)|Later Liang]], which inaugurated the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]. A year later Zhu had the deposed Emperor Ai poisoned to death.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

==Administration and politics==
{{see also|Administrative divisions of the Tang dynasty}}

===Initial reforms===

Taizong set out to solve internal problems within the government which had constantly plagued past dynasties. Building upon the Sui [[code (law)|legal code]], he issued [[Tang Code|a new legal code]] that subsequent Chinese dynasties would model theirs upon, as well as neighboring polities in [[Vietnam]], [[Korea]], and [[Japan]].{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}} The earliest law code to survive was the one established in the year 653, which was divided into 500 articles specifying different crimes and penalties ranging from ten blows with a light stick, one hundred blows with a heavy rod, exile, penal servitude, or execution.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|pp=111–112}}

The legal code distinguished different levels of severity in meted punishments when different members of the social and political hierarchy committed the same crime.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=112}} For example, the severity of punishment was different when a servant or nephew killed a master or an uncle than when a master or uncle killed a servant or nephew.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=112}}

A white inner gown hangs over his square shoes. He holds a tablet to his chest, a report to his superiors.]]

The Tang Code was largely retained by later codes such as the early [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644) code of 1397,{{sfn|Andrew|Rapp|2000|p=25}} yet there were several revisions in later times, such as [[Society of the Song dynasty#Women: legality and lifestyles|improved property rights for women]] during the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279).{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=158}}{{sfn|Bernhardt|1995|pp=274–275}}

The Tang had three departments ({{zh|t=省|hp=shěng|links=no}}), which were obliged to draft, review, and implement policies respectively. There were also six ministries ({{zh|t=部|hp=bù|links=no}}) under the administrations that implemented policy, each of which was assigned different tasks. These [[Three Departments and Six Ministries]] included the personnel administration, finance, rites, military, justice, and public works—an administrative model which would last until the fall of the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912).{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=78}}

Although the founders of the Tang related to the glory of the earlier [[Han dynasty]] (3rd century&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}–3rd century&amp;nbsp;{{sc|ad}}), the basis for much of their administrative organization was very similar to the previous [[Northern and Southern dynasties]].{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}} The [[Northern Zhou]] (6th century) [[fubing system]] of divisional militia was continued by the Tang, along with farmer-soldiers serving in rotation from the capital or frontier in order to receive appropriated farmland. The [[equal-field system]] of the [[Northern Wei]] (4th–6th centuries) was also kept, although there were a few modifications.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}}

Although the central and local governments kept an enormous number of records about land property in order to assess taxes, it became common practice in the Tang for literate and affluent people to create their own private documents and signed contracts. These had their own signature and that of a witness and scribe in order to prove in court (if necessary) that their claim to property was legitimate. The prototype of this actually existed since the ancient Han dynasty, while contractual language became even more common and embedded into Chinese literary culture in later dynasties.{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=59}}

The center of the political power of the Tang was the capital city of [[Chang'an]] (modern [[Xi'an]]), where the emperor maintained his large palace quarters and entertained political emissaries with music, sports, [[Acrobatics|acrobatic]] stunts, poetry, paintings, and [[Pear Garden|dramatic theater performances]]. The capital was also filled with incredible amounts of riches and resources to spare. When the Chinese [[prefecture|prefectural]] government officials traveled to the capital in the year 643 to give the annual report of the affairs in their districts, Emperor Taizong discovered that many had no proper quarters to rest in and were renting rooms with merchants. Therefore, Emperor Taizong ordered the government agencies in charge of [[Township|municipal]] construction to build every visiting official his own private [[mansion]] in the capital.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=59}}

===Imperial examinations===
{{Main|Imperial examination}}
{{Further|Imperial examination in Chinese mythology}}

[[File:Civilserviceexam1.jpg|thumb|left|Civil service exam candidates gather around the wall where results had been posted. Artwork by [[Qiu Ying]].]]

Students of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] studies were candidates for the [[imperial examination]]s, which qualified their graduates for appointment to the local, provincial, and central government bureaucracies. Two types of exams given, ''mingjing'' ({{lang|zh|明經}}; &quot;illuminating the classics&quot;) and ''jinshi'' ({{lang|zh|進士}}; &quot;presented scholar&quot;).{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|pp = 91–92}} The ''mingjing'' was based upon the [[Chinese classic texts|Confucian classics]] and tested the student's knowledge of a broad variety of texts.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|pp=91–92}} The ''jinshi'' tested a student's literary abilities in writing essays in response to questions on governance and politics, as well as in composing [[Chinese poetry|poetry]].{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=92}} Candidates were also judged on proper deportment, appearance, speech, and [[calligraphy]], all subjective criteria that favored the wealthy over those of more modest means who were unable to pay tutors of [[rhetoric]] and writing.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=97}} Although a disproportionate number of civil officials came from aristocratic families,{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=97}} wealth and noble status were not prerequisites, and the exams were open to all male subjects whose fathers were not of the [[Four occupations|artisan or merchant classes]].{{sfn|Gascoigne|Gascoigne|2003|p= 95}}{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=97}} To promote widespread Confucian education, the Tang government established state-run schools and issued standard versions of the [[Five Classics]] with commentaries.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p= 112}}

Open competition was designed to draw the best talent into government. But perhaps an even greater consideration for the Tang rulers was to avoid imperial dependence on powerful aristocratic families and [[warlord]]s by recruiting a body of career officials having no family or local [[Base (politics)|power base]]. The Tang law code ensured equal division of inherited property amongst legitimate heirs, encouraging [[social mobility]] by preventing powerful families from becoming [[landed nobility]] through [[primogeniture]].{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=83}} The competition system proved successful, as [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholar-officials]] acquired status in their local communities while developing an [[Morale|esprit de corps]] that connected them to the imperial court. From Tang times until the end of the Qing dynasty in 1912, scholar-officials served as intermediaries between the [[grassroots|people]] and the government. 

Yet the potential of a widespread examination system was not fully realized until the succeeding Song dynasty, when the merit-driven scholar official largely shed his aristocratic habits and defined his social status through the examination system.{{sfn |Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=159}}{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=95}}{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=54}} 
{{quote|The examination system, used only on a small scale in Sui and Tang times, played a central role in the fashioning of this new elite. The early Song emperors, concerned above all to avoid domination of the government by military men, greatly expanded the civil service examination system and the government school system.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|pp=145–146}}}}

===Religion and politics===
[[Image:Audience by Emperor Tang Xuanzong.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] giving audience to [[Elder Zhang Guo|Zhang Guo]], by [[Ren Renfa]] (1254–1327)]]

From the outset, religion played a role in Tang politics. In his bid for power, Li Yuan had attracted a following by claiming descent from the [[Taoism]] sage [[Lao Tzu]] ({{floruit}}&amp;nbsp;6th century&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}).{{sfn|Graff|2000|p=79}} People bidding for office would request the prayers of Buddhist monks, with successful aspirants making donations in return. Before the persecution of Buddhism in the 9th century, Buddhism and Taoism were both accepted.

Religion was central in the reign of [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]] (r. 712–756). The Emperor invited Taoist and Buddhist monks and clerics to his court, exalted the Taoist ancient Lao Tzu with grand titles, wrote commentary on the ''Lao Tzu'' scriptures, and set up a school to prepare candidates for Taoist examinations. In 726 he called upon the Indian monk [[Vajrabodhi]] (671–741) to perform [[Vajrayana|Tantric]] rites to avert a drought. In 742 he personally held the incense burner while [[Amoghavajra]] (705–774, patriarch of the [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon school]]) recited &quot;mystical incantations to secure the victory of Tang forces.&quot;{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=99}}

Emperor Xuanzong closely regulated religious finances. Near the beginning of his reign in 713, he liquidated the [[Chang'an#Northwestern Chang'an|Inexhaustible Treasury]] of a prominent Buddhist monastery in Chang'an which had collected vast riches as multitudes of anonymous repentants left money, silk, and treasure at its doors. Although the monastery used its funds generously, the Emperor condemned it for fraudulent [[History of banking in China|banking]] practices, and distributed its wealth to other Buddhist and Taoist monasteries, and to repair local statues, halls, and bridges.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=61}} In 714, he forbade Chang'an shops from selling copied Buddhist sutras, giving a monopoly of this trade to the Buddhist clergy.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=57}}

===Taxes and the census===

The Tang dynasty government attempted to create an accurate census of the empire's population, mostly for effective taxation and military conscription. The early Tang government established modest grain and cloth taxes on each household, persuading households to register and provide the government with accurate demographic information.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}} In the official census of 609, the population was tallied at 9&amp;nbsp;million households, about 50&amp;nbsp;million people,{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}} and this number did not increase in the census of 742.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=141}} Patricia Ebrey writes that nonwithstanding census undercounting, China's population had not grown significantly since the earlier [[History of the Han dynasty|Han Dynasty]], which recorded 58&amp;nbsp;million people in the year 2.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}}{{sfn|Nishijima|1986|pp=595–596}} S.A.M. Adshead disagrees, estimating about 75&amp;nbsp;million people by 750.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=72}}

In the Tang census of 754, there were 1,859 cities, 321 [[Prefecture (China)|prefectures]], and 1,538 [[Counties of the People's Republic of China#History|counties]] throughout the empire.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=45}} Although there were many large and prominent cities, the rural and agrarian areas comprised some 80 to 90% of the population.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=32}} There was also a dramatic migration from [[Northern and southern China|northern to southern China]], as the North held 75% of the overall population at the dynasty's inception, which by its end was reduced to 50%.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=75}}

Chinese population would not dramatically increase until the Song dynasty, when it doubled to 100&amp;nbsp;million because of extensive rice cultivation in central and southern China, coupled with higher yields of grain sold in a growing market.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=156}}

===Protectorates and tributaries===

The 7th and first half of the 8th century are generally considered to be the era in which the Tang reached the zenith of its power. In this period, Tang control extended further west than any previous dynasty, stretching from north Vietnam in the south, to a point north of [[Kashmir]] bordering Persia in the west, to northern Korea in the north-east.{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=xii, 4}}

Some of the kingdoms paying tribute to the Tang dynasty included [[Kashmir region|Kashmir]], Nepal, [[Khotan]], [[Kucha]], [[Kashgar]], [[Silla]], [[Champa]], and kingdoms located in [[Amu Darya]] and [[Syr Darya]] valley.{{sfn|Whitfield|2004|p=47}}{{sfn|Twitchett|2000|pp=116–118}} Turkic nomads addressed the Emperor of Tang China as ''[[Tian Kehan]]''.{{sfn|Twitchett|2000|p=124}} After the widespread Göktürk revolt of [[Shabolüe Khan]] (d. 658) was put down at [[Issyk Kul]] in 657 by [[Su Dingfang]] (591–667), Emperor Gaozong established several protectorates governed by a Protectorate General or Grand Protectorate General, which extended the Chinese [[sphere of influence]] as far as [[Herat]] in Western Afghanistan.{{sfn|Twitchett|2000|pp=118, 122}} Protectorate Generals were given a great deal of autonomy to handle local crises without waiting for central admission. After Xuanzong's reign, military governors (jiedushi) were given enormous power, including the ability to maintain their own armies, collect taxes, and pass their titles on hereditarily. This is commonly recognized as the beginning of the fall of Tang's central government.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=100}}{{sfn|Wang|2003|p=91}}

[[File:Tang Pottery Warrior.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|[[Tang dynasty tomb figures|Pottery tomb figure]] of a warrior from Duan's Tomb, [[Shaanxi]].]]

===Soldiers and conscription===

By the year 737, Emperor Xuanzong discarded the policy of conscripting soldiers that were replaced every three years, replacing them with long-service soldiers who were more battle-hardened and efficient. It was more economically feasible as well, since training new recruits and sending them out to the frontier every three years drained the treasury.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=9}} By the late 7th century, the ''[[Fubing system|fubing]]'' troops began abandoning military service and the homes provided to them in the equal-field system. The supposed standard of 100 ''[[Mu (unit of area)|mu]]'' of land allotted to each family was in fact decreasing in size in places where population expanded and the wealthy bought up most of the land.{{sfn|Graff|2002|p=208}} Hard-pressed peasants and vagrants were then induced into military service with benefits of exemption from both taxation and corvée labor service, as well as provisions for farmland and dwellings for dependents who accompanied soldiers on the frontier.{{sfn|Graff|2002|p=209}} By the year 742 the total number of enlisted troops in the Tang armies had risen to about 500,000 men.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=9}}

===Eastern regions===
{{See also|Protectorate General to Pacify the East}}

In East Asia, Tang Chinese military campaigns were less successful elsewhere than in previous imperial Chinese dynasties. [[Goguryeo–Sui War|Like the emperors of the Sui dynasty before him]], Taizong established a military campaign in 644 against the Korean kingdom of [[Goguryeo]] in the [[Goguryeo–Tang War]]; however, this led to its withdrawal in the [[First conflict of the Goguryeo–Tang War|first campaign]] because they failed to overcome the successful defense led by General [[Yeon Gaesomun]]. [[Silla–Tang alliance|Allying with the Korean Silla Kingdom]], the Chinese fought against [[Baekje]] and their [[Kofun period|Yamato Japanese]] allies in the [[Battle of Baekgang]] in August 663, a decisive Tang–Silla victory. The Tang dynasty navy had [[Naval history of China#Tang era|several different ship types]] at its disposal to engage in [[naval warfare]], these ships described by Li Quan in his ''Taipai Yinjing'' (Canon of the White and Gloomy Planet of War) of 759.{{sfn|Needham|1986c|pp=685–687}} The Battle of Baekgang was actually a restoration movement by remnant forces of Baekje, since their kingdom was toppled in 660 by a joint Tang–Silla invasion, led by Chinese general Su Dingfang and Korean general [[Kim Yushin]] (595–673). In another joint invasion with Silla, the Tang army severely weakened the Goguryeo Kingdom in the north by taking out its outer forts in the year 645. With joint attacks by Silla and Tang armies under commander [[Li Shiji]] (594–669), the Kingdom of Goguryeo was destroyed by 668.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=4}}

[[File:Mogao Cave 61, painting of Mount Wutai monasteries.jpg|thumb|A 10th-century mural painting in the [[Mogao Caves]] at [[Dunhuang]] showing monastic architecture from [[Mount Wutai]], Tang dynasty; [[Japanese architecture]] of this period was influenced by Tang Chinese architecture]]

Although they were formerly enemies, the Tang accepted officials and generals of Goguryeo into their administration and military, such as the brothers [[Yeon Namsaeng]] (634–679) and [[Yeon Namsan]] (639–701). From 668 to 676, the Tang Empire would control northern Korea. However, in 671 Silla broke the alliance and began the [[Silla–Tang War]] to expel the Tang forces. At the same time the Tang faced threats on its western border when a large Chinese army was defeated by the Tibetans on the Dafei River in 670.{{sfn|Graff|2002|p=201}} By 676, the Tang army tactically withdrew from Korea in favor of its new ally, [[Later Silla|Unified Silla]].{{sfn|Kang|2006|p=54}} Following a revolt of the Eastern Turks in 679, the Tang abandoned its Korean campaigns.{{sfn|Graff|2002|p=201}}

Although the Tang had fought the Japanese, they still held cordial relations with Japan. There were numerous [[Imperial embassies to China]] from Japan, diplomatic missions that were not halted until 894 by [[Emperor Uda]] (r. 887–897), upon persuasion by [[Sugawara no Michizane]] (845–903).{{sfn|Kitagawa|Tsuchida|1975|p=222}} The Japanese [[Emperor Tenmu]] (r. 672–686) even established his conscripted army on that of the Chinese model, his state ceremonies on the Chinese model, and constructed his palace at [[Fujiwara-kyō|Fujiwara]] on the [[Chinese architecture|Chinese model of architecture]].{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=144}}

Many Chinese Buddhist monks came to Japan to help further the spread of Buddhism as well. Two 7th-century monks in particular, Zhi Yu and Zhi You, visited the court of [[Emperor Tenji]] (r. 661–672), whereupon they presented a gift of a [[south-pointing chariot]] that they had crafted.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=289}} This 3rd century mechanically driven directional-[[compass]] vehicle (employing a [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential gear]]) was again reproduced in several models for Tenji in 666, as recorded in the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' of 720.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=289}} Japanese monks also visited China; such was the case with [[Ennin]] (794–864), who wrote of his travel experiences including travels along [[Grand Canal (China)|China's Grand Canal]].{{sfn|Needham|1986c|p=308}}{{sfn|Reischauer|1940|p=152}} The Japanese monk [[Enchin]] (814–891) stayed in China from 839 to 847 and again from 853 to 858, landing near [[Fuzhou|Fuzhou, Fujian]] and setting sail for Japan from [[Taizhou, Zhejiang]] during his second trip to China.{{sfn|Reischauer|1940|p=155}}{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=51}}

The Sui and Tang carried out successful military campaigns against the steppe nomads. Chinese foreign policy to the north and west now had to deal with [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] nomads, who were becoming the most dominant ethnic group in Central Asia.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=113}}{{sfn|Xue|1992|pp=149–152, 257–264}} To handle and avoid any threats posed by the Turks, the Sui government repaired fortifications and received their trade and tribute missions.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=92}} They sent four royal princesses to form [[Heqin|marriage alliances]] with Turkic clan leaders, in 597, 599, 614, and 617. The Sui stirred trouble and conflict amongst ethnic groups against the Turks.{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=2–3}}{{sfn|Cui|2005|pp=655–659}} As early as the Sui dynasty, the Turks had become a major militarized force employed by the Chinese. When the [[Khitans]] began raiding northeast China in 605, a Chinese general led 20,000 Turks against them, distributing Khitan livestock and women to the Turks as a reward.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=111}} On two occasions between 635 and 636, Tang royal princesses were married to Turk mercenaries or generals in Chinese service.{{sfn|Cui|2005|pp=655–659}} Throughout the Tang dynasty until the end of 755, there were approximately ten Turkic generals serving under the Tang.{{sfn|Xue|1992|p=788}}{{sfn|Twitchett|2000|p=125}} While most of the Tang army was made of ''fubing'' Chinese conscripts, the majority of the troops led by Turkic generals were of non-Chinese origin, campaigning largely in the western frontier where the presence of ''fubing'' troops was low.{{sfn|Liu|2000|pp=85–95}} Some &quot;Turkic&quot; troops were tribalized Han Chinese, a [[Desinicization|desinicized]] people.{{sfn|Gernet|1996|p=248}}

Civil war in China was almost totally diminished by 626, along with the defeat in 628 of the [[Ordos Desert|Ordos]] Chinese warlord [[Liang Shidu]]; after these internal conflicts, the Tang began an offensive against the Turks.{{sfn|Xue|1992|pp=226–227}} In the year 630, Tang armies captured areas of the Ordos Desert, modern-day [[Inner Mongolia]] province, and southern [[Mongolia]] from the Turks.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=111}}{{sfn|Xue|1992|pp=380–386}} After this military victory, Emperor Taizong won the title of Great Khan from the various Turks in the region who pledged their allegiance to both him and the Chinese empire (with several thousand Turks traveling into China to live at Chang'an). On June 11, 631, Emperor Taizong also sent envoys to the [[Xueyantuo]] bearing gold and silk in order to persuade the release of enslaved Chinese prisoners who were captured during the [[transition from Sui to Tang]] from the northern frontier; this embassy succeeded in freeing 80,000 Chinese men and women who were then returned to China.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=2}}{{sfn|Xue|1992|pp=222–225}}

[[File:Cernuschi Museum 20060812 162.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Tang dynasty tomb figures|Tomb guardian]] (''wushi yong''), early 8th century]]

While the Turks were settled in the Ordos region (former territory of the [[Xiongnu]]), the Tang government took on the military policy of dominating the central [[steppe]]. Like the earlier Han dynasty, the Tang dynasty (along with Turkic allies) conquered and subdued Central Asia during the 640s and 650s.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=92}} During Emperor Taizong's reign alone, large campaigns were launched against not only the [[Göktürk]]s, but also separate campaigns against the [[Emperor Taizong's campaign against Tuyuhun|Tuyuhun]], the [[Tang campaign against the oasis states|oasis city-states]], and the [[Emperor Taizong's campaign against Xueyantuo|Xueyantuo]].

There was a long string of conflicts with Tibet over territories in the [[Tarim Basin]] between 670 and 692, and in 763 the Tibetans even captured the capital of China, [[Chang'an]], for fifteen days during the [[An Shi Rebellion]].{{sfn|Beckwith|1987|p=146}}{{sfn|Stein|1972|p=65}} In fact, it was during this rebellion that the Tang withdrew its western garrisons stationed in what is now [[Gansu]] and [[Qinghai]], which the Tibetans then occupied along with the territory of what is now [[Xinjiang]].{{sfn|Twitchett|2000|p=109}} Hostilities between the Tang and Tibet continued until they signed a formal peace treaty in 821.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=11}} The terms of this treaty, including the fixed borders between the two countries, are recorded in a bilingual inscription on a stone pillar outside the [[Jokhang]] temple in Lhasa.{{sfn|Richardson|1985|pp=106–143}}[[File:Emperor Taizongs horses by Yan Liben.jpg|thumb|A bas relief of a soldier and the emperor's horse, [[Autumn Dew]], with elaborate [[saddle]] and [[stirrup]]s, designed by [[Yan Liben]], from the tomb of Emperor Taizong c. 650]]

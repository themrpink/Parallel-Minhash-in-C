Each borough has a committee of councillors, each of whom is elected to represent a ward. By means of the borough committees, the corporation undertakes urban planning and maintains roads, government-aided schools, hospitals, and municipal markets.&lt;ref name=&quot;kmcfunction&quot; /&gt; As Kolkata's apex body, the corporation discharges its functions through the mayor-in-council, which comprises a mayor, a deputy mayor, and ten other elected members of the KMC.&lt;ref name=&quot;kmcstructure&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.kmcgov.in/KMCPortal/downloads/structure.pdf |title= Legislative structure |publisher= Kolkata Municipal Corporation |access-date= 3 December 2011 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120104193107/https://www.kmcgov.in/KMCPortal/downloads/structure.pdf |archive-date= 4 January 2012 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The functions of the KMC include water supply, drainage and sewerage, sanitation, solid waste management, street lighting, and building regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;kmcfunction&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kmcgov.in/KMCPortal/jsp/KMCFunctions.jsp |title=KMC functions |publisher=Kolkata Municipal Corporation |access-date=3 December 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120104184545/https://www.kmcgov.in/KMCPortal/jsp/KMCFunctions.jsp |archive-date=4 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the seat of the [[Government of West Bengal]], Kolkata is home to not only the offices of the local governing agencies, but also the [[West Bengal Legislative Assembly]]; the state secretariat, which is housed in the [[Writers' Building]]; and the [[Calcutta High Court]]. Most government establishments and institutions are housed in the centre of the city in [[B. B. D. Bagh]] (formerly known as Dalhousie Square). The [[Calcutta High Court]] is the oldest [[High Courts of India|High Court]] in India. It was preceded by the [[Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William]] which was established in 1774.

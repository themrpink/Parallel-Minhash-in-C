==Ecology==
Menhaden are [[filter feeder]]s that travel in large, slow-moving, and tightly-packed [[Shoaling and schooling|schools]] with open mouths. Filter feeders typically take into their open mouths &quot;materials in the same proportions as they occur in ambient waters&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|url=https://www.gsmfc.org/publications/GSMFC%20Number%20099.pdf|title=The Menhaden Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico, United States: A Regional Management Plan|date=March 2002|publisher=[[Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission]]|issue=99|pages=3–10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190303234246/https://www.gsmfc.org/publications/GSMFC%20Number%20099.pdf|archive-date=March 3, 2019|editor-last=VanderKooy|editor-first=Steven J.|editor2-last=Smith|editor2-first=Joseph W.|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Menhaden have two main sources of food: [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]]. A menhaden's diet varies considerably over the course of its lifetime, and is directly related to its size. The smallest menhaden, typically those under one year old, eat primarily phytoplankton. After that age, adult menhaden gradually shift to a diet comprised almost exclusively of zooplankton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Friedland|first1=Kevin D.|last2=Lynch|first2=Patrick D.|last3=Gobler|first3=Christopher J.|date=November 2011|title=Time Series Mesoscale Response of Atlantic Menhaden ''Brevoortia tyrannus'' to Variation in Plankton Abundances|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242329913|journal=[[Journal of Coastal Research]]|volume=27|issue=6|pages=1148–1158|doi=10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-10-00171.1|s2cid=131569331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Menhaden are omnivorous filter feeders, feeding by straining [[plankton]] and [[algae]] from water. Along with [[oyster]]s, which filter water on the seabed, menhaden play a key role in the [[food chain]] in estuaries and bays.&lt;ref name=Discover/&gt; Atlantic menhaden are an important link between plankton and upper level predators. Because of their filter feeding abilities, &quot;menhaden consume and redistribute a significant amount of energy within and between [[Chesapeake Bay]] and other estuaries, and the coastal ocean.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.state.md.us |title=Maryland Department of Natural Resources |publisher=Dnr.state.md.us |date=2012-12-31 |access-date=2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because they play this role, and their abundance, menhaden are an invaluable prey species for many predatory fish, such as [[striped bass]], [[bluefish]], [[mackerel]], [[flounder]], [[tuna]], [[Drum (fish)|drums]], and [[shark]]s. They are also a very important food source for many birds, including [[egret]]s, [[osprey]]s, [[seagull]]s, [[northern gannet]]s, [[pelican]]s, and [[heron]]s.

In 2012, the [[Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission]] declared that the [[Atlantic menhaden]] was [[Resource depletion|depleted]] due to [[overfishing]]. The decision was driven by issues with water quality in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] and failing efforts to re-introduce predator species, due to lack of menhaden on which they could feed.&lt;ref name=&quot;conservationmagazine1&quot;/&gt;

==Human intake==
Menhaden are not used directly for food. They are [[Food processing|processed]] into [[fish oil]] and [[fish meal]] that are used as [[food ingredient]]s, [[animal feed]], and [[dietary supplement]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Discover&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://discovermagazine.com/2001/sep/featfish|title=The Most Important Fish in the Sea|last1=Tavee|first1=Tom|last2=Franklin|first2=H.

Fish oil made from menhaden also is used as a raw material for products such as [[lipstick]].&lt;ref name=greenberg/&gt;

===Fisheries===

[[File:Global total production menhaden.png|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Capture of menhaden in 2010 reported by the FAO&lt;ref name=FAOdata /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]

According to the [[Virginia Institute of Marine Science]] (VIMS), there are two established commercial fisheries for menhaden. The first is known as a [[reduction fishery]]. The second is known as a bait fishery, which harvests menhaden for the use of both commercial and recreational fishermen. Commercial fishermen, especially [[Crab fisheries|crabbers]] in the Chesapeake Bay area, use menhaden to bait their traps or hooks. The recreational fisherman use ground menhaden chum as a fish attractant, and whole fish as bait. The total harvest is approximately 500 million fish per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;greenberg&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/16/opinion/16greenberg.html|title=A Fish Oil Story|last=Greenberg|first=Paul|date=December 15, 2009|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=February 10, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190207020812/https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/16/opinion/16greenberg.html|archive-date=February 7, 2019|url-status=live|author-link=Paul Greenberg (essayist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atlantic menhaden are harvested using [[purse seine]]s.

[[Omega Protein]] – a reduction fishery company with operations in the northwest Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico – takes 90% of the total menhaden harvest in the United States.&lt;ref name=greenberg/&gt; In October 2005, the [[Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission]] (ASMFC) approved an addendum to Amendment 1 of the Interstate Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic Menhaden, which &quot;established a five-year annual cap on reduction fishery landings in the [[Chesapeake Bay]]&quot;, imposing a limit on reduction fishery operations for 2006–2010.

In December 2012, in the face of the [[Resource depletion|depletion]] of Atlantic menhaden, the ASMFC implemented another cap, effective in 2013 and 2014, for the Chesapeake Bay, this time at 87,216 metric tons, as well as a total allowable catch (TAC) of the species of 170,800 metric tons, a 20% reduction from the 2009–2011 average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|url=https://www.asmfc.org/uploads/file/atlanticMenhadenAmendment2_Dec2012.pdf|title=Amendment 2 to the Interstate Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic Menhaden|date=December 2012|publisher=[[Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission]]|pages=47, 55|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190318163248/http://www.asmfc.org/uploads/file/atlanticMenhadenAmendment2_Dec2012.pdf|archive-date=March 18, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bayjournal.com/article/omega_protein_makes_good_on_threat_to_cut_jobs_but_it_doesnt_have_to|title=Omega Protein makes good on threat to cut jobs; but it doesn't have to|last=Fairbrother|first=Alison|date=March 31, 2013|website=Bay Journal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629090442/https://www.bayjournal.com/article/omega_protein_makes_good_on_threat_to_cut_jobs_but_it_doesnt_have_to|archive-date=June 29, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TAC was subsequently raised for 2015 and 2016 to 187,880 metric tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|url=http://www.asmfc.org/uploads/file/57ae1f86AtlanticMenhadenAddendumItoAm2_Aug2016.pdf|title=Addendum I to Amendment 2 of the Atlantic Menhaden Interstate Fishery Management Plan|date=August 2016|publisher=[[Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190318163244/http://www.asmfc.org/uploads/file/57ae1f86AtlanticMenhadenAddendumItoAm2_Aug2016.pdf|archive-date=March 18, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cap in the Chesapeake Bay was further lowered in November 2017 to 51,000 metric tons, but this came alongside a higher TAC of 216,000 metric tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|url=http://www.asmfc.org/uploads/file//5a4c02e1AtlanticMenhadenAmendment3_Nov2017.pdf|title=Amendment 3 to the Interstate Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic Menhaden|date=November 2017|publisher=[[Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission]]|page=iii, v|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190318163236/http://www.asmfc.org/uploads/file//5a4c02e1AtlanticMenhadenAmendment3_Nov2017.pdf|archive-date=March 18, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.seafoodsource.com/news/supply-trade/omega-protein-critical-of-asmfc-actions-on-chesapeake-menhaden|title=Omega Protein critical of ASMFC actions on Chesapeake menhaden|last=Bittenbender|first=Steve|date=May 7, 2018|website=SeafoodSource|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190324190556/https://www.seafoodsource.com/news/supply-trade/omega-protein-critical-of-asmfc-actions-on-chesapeake-menhaden|archive-date=March 24, 2019|url-status=live|access-date=March 24, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Omega Protein has been openly critical of these caps.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

==Cultural significance==
After menhaden had been identified as a valuable alternative to [[whale oil]] in the 1870s, the menhaden fishery on the Chesapeake was worked by predominantly African American crews on open boats hauling [[Seine fishing|purse seines]]. The men employed [[sea chanties]] to help synchronize the hauling of the nets. These chanties pulled from West African, blues, and gospel sources and created a uniquely African American culture of chanty singing. By the late 1950s, hydraulic winches replaced the large crews of manual haulers, and the menhaden chanty tradition declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=Harold|date=January–February 2000|title=Menhaden Chanteys: An African American Maritime Legacy|url=https://www.mdsg.umd.edu/sites/default/files/files/MN18_1_MenhadenChanteys.PDF|url-status=live|journal=Maryland Marine Notes|location=College Park, Maryland|publisher=[[University System of Maryland|Maryland Sea Grant College]]|volume=18|pages=1–6|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190324034410/https://www.mdsg.umd.edu/sites/default/files/files/MN18_1_MenhadenChanteys.PDF|archive-date=24 March 2019|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''San Francisco''''' is a 1936 [[musical film|musical]]-[[Drama (film and television)|drama]] [[disaster film]] directed by [[Woody Van Dyke]], based on the April 18, [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 San Francisco earthquake]]. The film, which was the top-grossing movie of that year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reid|first=John |title=Award-Winning Films of the 1930s|publisher=Lulu.com|year=2004|pages=129|isbn=1-4116-1432-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; stars [[Clark Gable]], [[Jeanette MacDonald]] and [[Spencer Tracy]]. The very popular singing of MacDonald helped make this film a hit, coming on the heels of her other 1936 blockbuster, ''[[Rose Marie (1936 film)|Rose Marie]]''. Famous [[silent film]] directors [[D. W. Griffith]] and [[Erich von Stroheim]] worked on the film without credit. Griffith directed some of the mob scenes while von Stroheim contributed to the screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dugan|2011|pp=128, 145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film opens with two men in boxing gloves and trunks sparring vigorously. One knocks the other squarely down, concluding their session. Changing out of their exercise gear, the latter dons a natty suit, the former a priest's collar.
 
The first man is &quot;Blackie&quot; Norton ([[Clark Gable]]), a saloonkeeper and gambler. He owns the ''Paradise Club'' on Pacific Street in the notorious [[Barbary Coast, San Francisco, California|Barbary Coast]]. The other is Blackie's childhood friend, Father Tim Mullen ([[Spencer Tracy]]), a [[Roman Catholic]] priest.

Blackie hires Mary Blake ([[Jeanette MacDonald]]), a promising, but impoverished, classically trained singer from Benson, Colorado. She becomes a star attraction at the ''Paradise'', especially for singing [[Theme from San Francisco|&quot;San Francisco&quot;]] (a song composed for the movie, which became one of the city's official anthems).&lt;ref name=&quot;sfmuseum.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist1/song.html|title=San Francisco's Official Songs|website=www.sfmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club piano player, &quot;The Professor&quot; ([[Al Shean]]), can tell Mary has a professionally trained voice. Mat ([[Ted Healy]]), Blackie's good friend at the Paradise, wisely predicts that Mary is not going to stay on the &quot;Coast&quot;.

Father Tim makes several attempts to reform Blackie, while the other nightclub owners urge him to run for the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]] in order to protect their crooked interests. Encouraged by Father Tim, who believes Blackie can use the supervisor position to implement reform, Blackie decides to run for office.  Despite Father Tim's best efforts, Blackie remains a jaunty Barbary Coast atheist, although Blackie secretly paid for the new organ in Father Tim's church.

Blackie's feelings for Mary intensify, but complications arise when she is offered an opportunity to sing in the opera.  Although she initially refuses to break her contract with Blackie, she later leaves the ''Paradise Club'' due to the overtly sexual manifestation of Blackie's feelings for her.

Mary is hired by the Tivoli Opera House on Market Street. There she becomes involved with [[Nob Hill]] scion Jack Burley ([[Jack Holt (actor)|Jack Holt]]). Blackie wants to stop Mary singing at the Tivoli: he arrives the night of her premiere with a process server in tow to shut down the show. However, when he hears her sing he decides not to stop the opera. After her performance, Blackie visits Mary in her dressing room. Realizing she still loves him, Mary forwardly asks him to marry her.  Blackie agrees, but their reunion is soon interrupted by Burley, who had proclaimed his love for Mary and proposed to her prior to the show.  Blackie, seeing Burley as competition for Mary's affections, is happy to tell him of their intent to marry.  However, as Blackie gloatingly tells Burley of their plans, it becomes clear that Blackie intends to take Mary away from the Tivoli and put her back on stage at the ''Paradise''.  Burley appeals to Mary, but Blackie presents Mary with an ultimatum by asking if she wants to marry him or stay at the Tivoli.

Mary's choice is to return to the ''Paradise''.  Backstage, before the opening night of her return performance, she asks Blackie if they can set the date for their wedding.  Blackie agrees, but wants to postpone getting married until after the election. Father Tim drops in, and is angered by Mary's skimpy stage costume. He defies Blackie to put her on the stage in front of the rowdy ''Paradise'' audience.  Mary observes Blackie's reaction to Father Tim's statements, and decides to leave with the priest after Blackie strikes him in the face.

Mary goes back to Burley and eventually meets his mother ([[Jessie Ralph]]) at her [[Nob Hill]] mansion. In a private conversation, she confesses her unworthiness, but Mrs. Burley informs Mary that she started out in 1850 as Massie, a simple washerwoman in [[Portsmouth Square]]. Mrs. Burley also empathizes that she also once had a &quot;Blackie&quot; in her younger days, but chose to marry the more steadfast elder Burley.  This cements Mary's decision to accept Burley's proposal of marriage.

It is now the evening of April 17, 1906.  Burley has called in some favors and had the [[San Francisco Police Department]] raid the ''Paradise'', destroying its gambling equipment and running off the patrons. Blackie, distraught about the future of his club, ends up at the city's annual Chickens Ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chickensball.org/history/a-brief-history-of-the-chickens-ball/|title=Chickens’ Ball History|date=28 February 2012|website=San Carlos Chickens' Ball Variety Show}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary and Burley are in attendance.  After performances by acts from the other Barbary Coast clubs, the MC requests the ''Paradise's'' entry. When no one steps on stage, Mary, just having learned of the club's closing, enters the Chickens Ball competition for the ''Paradise''. She rouses the audience to join in a chorus of &quot;San Francisco&quot;, and wins. However, Blackie angrily refuses the prize money, tossing the prize cup and gold coins to the stage floor. He angrily states that Mary had no right to sing on behalf of his club. Embarrassed, Mary is about to leave the ball with Burley.

Then, at 5:13&amp;nbsp;a.m. April 18, 1906, [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|the earthquake hits the city]]. The city is devastated and hundreds are killed.

As Blackie wanders the city searching for Mary, he walks to Nob Hill, where he sees Mrs. Burley, who senses her son has died. (Blackie did indeed witness the dead Burley when wandering the devastated streets.)  She leaves the area as US Army troops from the [[Presidio of San Francisco|Presidio]] blow up her mansion in preparation making a [[firebreak]]. Blackie then comes upon Mat, who was injured at the destroyed Hall of Justice on Washington Street.  A nurse indicates to Blackie that Mat is dying. Before he dies, Mat tells Blackie he was wrong about his feelings toward Mary.

Blackie later meets Father Tim, who takes him to [[Golden Gate Park]], where there is a tent camp for the homeless. There, Blackie hears Mary's voice lifted in song &quot;[[Nearer, My God, to Thee]]&quot;  with those in mourning. After seeing Mary, Blackie falls to his knees and thanks God for sparing Mary's life. From a distance, Mary sees Blackie praying, and as she walks toward him, word spreads through the camp that &quot;The fire's out!&quot; As people shout about building a new San Francisco, Blackie and Mary join the crowd (a surprisingly multi-racial group, given the era of the film) as they leave the park marching arm-in-arm, singing &quot;[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]&quot;.  

The film ends with a dissolve from the smoldering ruins into the &quot;modern&quot; San Francisco of the mid-1930s. (Each year when the film is shown near April 18 by Bay Area television stations, the scenes of the 1930s city are replaced with stock news footage of the city in the current year.)

==Production==
[[File:San Francisco lobby card.JPG|thumb|[[Lobby card]]]]
The earthquake [[montage sequence]] was created by 2nd unit director and montage expert [[John Hoffman (filmmaker)|John Hoffman]]. The [[Barbary Coast, San Francisco|Barbary Coast]] barroom set was built on a special platform that rocked and shook to simulate the historical temblor. (Similar sets were built for the 1974 disaster film ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]''.)

There are two versions of the ending. The original release features a stylish montage of then-current (1936) scenes of a bustling San Francisco, including Market Street and the construction of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]].  When the film was re-released in 1948, it was thought these scenes were dated and the film fades out on a single long shot of the modern business district.  However, the TV and 16mm versions of the film seen in the 1950s and 60s were struck from the original version which includes the montage.  The current DVD and cable version features the shorter, 1948 version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/|title=Ratings and Reviews for New Movies and TV Shows|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gable and Tracy also made two other films together, ''[[Test Pilot (film)|Test Pilot]]'' and ''[[Boom Town (film)|Boom Town]]'', before Tracy eventually insisted on the same [[Billing (filmmaking)|top billing]] clause in his [[MGM]] contract that Gable had enjoyed, effectively ending one of the American cinema's most famous screen teams.

Gable had played an extremely similar character also named &quot;Blackie&quot; two years earlier in the smash hit gangster epic ''[[Manhattan Melodrama]]'', with [[William Powell]] and [[Myrna Loy]].

==Music==
The [[Theme from San Francisco|title song]] may be the best-remembered part of the film. It was composed by [[Bronisław Kaper]] and [[Walter Jurmann]], with lyrics by [[Gus Kahn]]. It is sung by Jeanette MacDonald a half-dozen times in the film, and becomes an anthem for the survivors of the earthquake. It has now become a popular sentimental sing-along at public events such as the city's annual earthquake commemoration, as well as one of two official city songs; the other being &quot;[[I Left My Heart in San Francisco]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfmuseum.org&quot;/&gt; At San Francisco's historic Castro Theatre, the pre-film organ performance always ends with the song as the organ console is lowered down before the film starts.&lt;ref name=&quot;KALWNewOrgan&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kalw.org/post/organ-transplant-castro-theatres-mighty-wurlitzer#stream/0 |title=An organ transplant for the Castro Theatre's Mighty Wurlitzer |accessdate=2019-04-08|work=kalw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the film, the song &quot;[[Darktown Strutters' Ball|The Darktown Strutters Ball]]&quot; can be heard; this is a historically inaccurate inclusion, since the song was written in 1917.

During the two operatic scenes in the film, MacDonald sang excerpts from [[Charles Gounod]]'s ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'' and [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[La Traviata]]''.  Another song she sings is ''[[The Holy City (song)|The Holy City]]''.

==Box office==
According to MGM records the film grossed a total – domestic and foreign – of $5,273,000: $2,868,000 in the US and Canada&lt;ref name=HollywoodDivaBook&gt;{{cite book |last=Turk |first=Edward Baron |year=1998 |title=Hollywood Diva: A Biography of Jeanette MacDonald |publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-21202-9|pages=[https://books.google.ie/books?id=ojOxCgHZLpUC&amp;pg=PA364#v=twopage 364-365]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and $2,405,000 elsewhere.

He is best known for his [[action hero]] roles, particularly his [[breakout role]] as [[Max Rockatansky]] in the first three films of the [[post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] action series ''[[Mad Max (franchise)|Mad Max]]'' and as [[Martin Riggs]] in the [[buddy cop film]] series ''[[Lethal Weapon (franchise)|Lethal Weapon]]''.

Born in [[Peekskill, New York]], Gibson moved with his parents to [[Sydney]], Australia, when he was 12 years old. He studied acting at the [[National Institute of Dramatic Art]], where he starred opposite [[Judy Davis]] in a production of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. During the 1980s, he founded [[Icon Entertainment]], a production company, which [[independent film]] director [[Atom Egoyan]] has called &quot;an alternative to the studio system&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Mad Mel's passion for vengeance | author = Brian D. Johnson | magazine = [[Maclean's]] | date = December 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Peter Weir]] cast him as one of the leads in the [[World War I]] drama ''[[Gallipoli (1981 film)|Gallipoli]]'' (1981), which earned Gibson a Best Actor Award from the [[Australian Film Institute]],&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;The Australian Film Institute,[http://www.afi.org.au/Past_Winners2/AM/ContentManagerNet/ContentDisplay.aspx?ContentID=6460&amp;Section=Past_Winners Past Winners] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723062132/http://www.afi.org.au/Past_Winners2/AM/ContentManagerNet/ContentDisplay.aspx?ContentID=6460&amp;Section=Past_Winners |date=July 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a reputation as a serious, versatile actor.

In 1995, Gibson produced, directed, and starred in ''[[Braveheart]]'', a [[list of historical period drama films and series|historical]] [[Epic film|epic]], for which he won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director]], the [[Academy Award for Best Director]], and the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. He later directed and produced ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'', a biblical drama that was both financially successful and highly controversial. He received further critical notice for his directorial work of the action-adventure film ''[[Apocalypto]]'' (2006), which is set in [[Mesoamerica]] during the early 16th century.

After several legal issues and controversial statements leaked to the public, Gibson's public image plummeted significantly, affecting his careers in acting and directing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grady|first=Constance|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/7/24/17460392/mel-gibson-comeback-metoo-times-up|title=Mel Gibson has set the blueprint for a #MeToo comeback.

Gibson's father was awarded US$145,000 in a work-related-injury lawsuit against the [[New York Central Railroad]] on February 14, 1968, and soon afterwards relocated his family to [[West Pymble]], Sydney, Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mel Gibson: Living Dangerously|first=Wensley|last=Clarkson|publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press|location=New York|year=1993|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mel was twelve years old at the time. The move to his grandmother's native Australia was for economic reasons, and his father's expectation that the [[Australian Defence Forces]] would reject his eldest son for the [[Conscription in Australia#Vietnam War|draft]] during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Grossman&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/2003-07-31/news/is-the-pope-catholic/| title=Is the Pope Catholic?| author=Wendy Grossman | work=Dallas Observer | accessdate=September 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1998, Hugo Chávez declared three goals for the new government; &quot;convening a constituent assembly to write a new constitution, eliminating government corruption, and fighting against social exclusion and poverty&quot;. However, during Hugo Chávez's time in power, corruption has become widespread throughout the government due to impunity towards members of the government, bribes and the lack of transparency.&lt;ref name=CATOhc&gt;{{cite web|last=Coronel|first=Gustavo|title=Corruption, Mismanagement, and Abuse of Power in Hugo Chávez's Venezuela|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/development-policy-analysis/corruption-mismanagement-abuse-power-hugo-chavezs-venezuela|publisher=Cato Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Hugo Chávez and his allies took over the Supreme Court, filling it with supporters of Chávez and made new measures so the government could dismiss justices from the court.&lt;ref name=HRW2012&gt;{{cite web|title=World Report 2012: Venezuela|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-venezuela|work=Report|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[libertarian]] ''[[Cato Institute]]'', the [[National Electoral Council of Venezuela]] was under control of Chávez where he tried to &quot;push a constitutional reform that would have allowed him unlimited opportunities for reelection&quot;.&lt;ref name=CATOcorruption&gt;{{cite web|last=Coronel|first=Gustavo|title=The Corruption of Democracy in Venezuela|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/corruption-democracy-venezuela|publisher=Cato Institute|accessdate=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Corruption Perceptions Index]], produced annually by the Berlin-based NGO [[Transparency International]] (TNI), reported that in the later years of Chávez's tenure, corruption worsened; it was 158th out of 180 countries in 2008, and 165th out of 176 (tied with [[Burundi]], [[Chad]], and [[Haiti]]).&lt;ref name=2012Index&gt;{{cite news|title=Factbox: Transparency International's global corruption index|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/05/us-corruption-transparency-global-idUSBRE8B406G20121205|accessdate=5 December 2012|newspaper=Reuters|date=5 December 2012|first=David|last=Cutler}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Venezuelans believed the government's effort against corruption was ineffective; that corruption had increased; and that government institutions such as the judicial system, parliament, legislature, and police were the most corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Corruption Barometer 2010/11|url=http://www.transparency.org/country#VEN_PublicOpinion|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Gallup Poll]]'s 2006 Corruption Index, Venezuela ranked 31st out of 101 countries according to how widespread the population perceive corruption as being in the government and in business. The index listed Venezuela as the second least corrupt nation in Latin America, behind Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Steve |last1=Crabtree |first2=Nicole |last2=Naurath |url=http://www.hra.am/file/gallup_corruption.htm |title=Gallup Launches Worldwide Corruption Index |publisher=Gallup Poll News Service |accessdate=21 December 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124180011/http://www.hra.am/file/gallup_corruption.htm |archivedate=24 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some criticism came from Chávez's supporters, as well. Chávez's own political party, [[Fifth Republic Movement]] (MVR), had been criticized as being riddled with the same cronyism, political patronage, and corruption that Chávez alleged were characteristic of the old &quot;Fourth Republic&quot; political parties. Venezuela's trade unionists and indigenous communities participated in peaceful demonstrations intended to impel the government to facilitate labor and land reforms. These communities, while largely expressing their sympathy and support for Chávez, criticized what they saw as Chávez's slow progress in protecting their interests against managers and mining concerns, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Fuentes, F.

====Aiding FARC====
[[File:Raulreyesfarc.png|thumb|[[Raúl Reyes]]]]
According to the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] (IISS), &quot;Chavez's government funded [[FARC]]'s office in Caracas and gave it access to Venezuela's intelligence services&quot; and said that during the 2002 coup attempt that &quot;FARC also responded to requests from [Venezuela's intelligence service] to provide training in urban terrorism involving targeted killings and the use of explosives&quot;. The IISS continued saying that &quot;the archive offers tantalizing but ultimately unproven suggestions that FARC may have undertaken assassinations of Chavez's political opponents on behalf of the Venezuelan state&quot;. Venezuelan diplomats denounced the IISS' findings saying that they had &quot;basic inaccuracies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Martinez|first=Michael|title=Study: Colombian rebels were willing to kill for Venezuela's Chavez|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/americas/05/10/venezuela.farc.documents/index.html|accessdate=21 April 2014|newspaper=CNN|date=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, authorities in [[Colombia]] claimed that through laptops they had seized on a raid against [[Raúl Reyes]], they found in documents that Hugo Chávez offered payments of as much as $300&amp;nbsp;million to the FARC &quot;among other financial and political ties that date back years&quot; along with other documents showing &quot;high-level meetings have been held between rebels and Ecuadorean officials&quot; and some documents claiming that FARC had &quot;bought and sold [[uranium]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Padgett&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Padgett|first=Tim|title=Chávez and the Cash-Filled Suitcase|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1838145,00.html|accessdate=28 March 2014|newspaper=TIME|date=3 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USATODAYfarc&gt;{{cite news|title=Colombia: Chavez funding FARC rebels|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-03-02-venezuelacolombia_N.htm?csp=34|accessdate=21 April 2014|newspaper=USA Today|date=4 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Chávez's former bodyguard [[Leamsy Salazar]] stated in ''Bumerán Chávez'' that Chávez met with the high command of FARC in 2007 somewhere in rural Venezuela. Chávez created a system in which the FARC would provide the Venezuelan government with drugs that would be transported in live cattle and the FARC would receive money and weaponry from the Venezuelan government. According to Salazar, this was done in order to weaken Colombian President [[Álvaro Uribe]], an enemy of Chávez.&lt;ref name=ROTTENstate&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cristóbal Nagel|first1=Juan|title=Something Is Rotten in the State of Venezuela|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/04/28/something-is-rotten-in-the-state-of-venezuela-chavez-maduro-cabello-salazar-farc/|accessdate=17 May 2015|agency=[[Foreign Policy]]|date=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1999 Venezuelan Constitution====
In the 1999 [[Constitution of Venezuela|Venezuelan constitution]], 116 of the 350 articles were concerned with human rights; these included increased protections for indigenous peoples and women, and established the rights of the public to education, housing, healthcare, and food. It called for dramatic democratic reforms such as ability to recall politicians from office by popular referendum, increased requirements for government transparency, and numerous other requirements to increase localized, participatory democracy, in favor of centralized administration. It gave citizens the right to timely and impartial information, community access to media, and a right to participate in acts of civil disobedience.&lt;ref name=&quot;new-const&quot;&gt;[[#Wil03|Wilpert 2003]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Embassy of Venezuela in the US&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year = 2000|title = Bolivarian Constitution of Venezuela|url = http://www.embavenez-us.org/constitution/intro.htm|accessdate = 30 December 2006|publisher = Embassy of Venezuela in the US|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120717012249/http://www.embavenez-us.org/constitution/intro.htm|archive-date = 17 July 2012|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media and the press===
[[File:ProtestosRCTV.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|Venezuelans protesting against the closing of RCTV]]
Under Chávez, press freedom declined while [[censorship in Venezuela]] increased. He used state-run bodies to silence the media and to disseminate [[Bolivarian propaganda]]. Other actions included pressuring media organizations to sell to those related to his government or to face closure.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/as-it-slides-toward-authoritarianism-venezuela-targets-one-of-its-last-independent-newspapers/2018/07/03/9cb5fe22-7a2d-11e8-ac4e-421ef7165923_story.html|title=As it slides toward authoritarianism, Venezuela targets one of its last independent newspapers|date=5 July 2018|website=[[The Washington Post]]|language=en|access-date=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] criticized Chávez for engaging in &quot;often discriminatory policies that have undercut journalists' freedom of expression&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holland 2&quot; /&gt; [[Reporters Without Borders]] criticized the Chávez administration for &quot;steadily silencing its critics&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;en.rsf.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2009,1001.html|title=Reporters Sans Frontières|publisher=En.rsf.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930230930/http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2009%2C1001.html|archivedate=30 September 2015|url-status=dead|accessdate=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Chávez used the [[National Commission of Telecommunications]] and the Social Responsibility in Radio, Television and Electronic Media law to officially censor media organizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;

Chávez inaugurated [[TeleSUR]] in July 2005, a [[Americas|pan-American]] [[news channel]] similar to [[Al Jazeera]], which sought to challenge Latin American television news by [[Univision]]{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} and the United States-based [[CNN en Español]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, Ian.

In the group's 2009 Press Freedom Index, Reporters Without Borders noted that &quot;Venezuela is now among the region's worst press freedom offenders.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;en.rsf.org&quot; /&gt; [[Freedom House]] listed Venezuela's press as being &quot;Not Free&quot; in its 2011 Map of Press Freedom, noting that &quot;[t]he gradual erosion of press freedom in Venezuela continued in 2010.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=251&amp;year=2011 &quot;Map of Press Freedom 2011&quot;.] Freedom House.org. 2011.

Though Chávez inspired other movements in Latin America to follow his model of ''chavismo'' in an attempt to reshape South America, it was later seen as being erratic and his influence internationally became exaggerated.&lt;ref name=NOREF&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marthoz|first1=Jean-Paul|title=Venezuela's foreign policy: a mirage based on a curse|url=https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/186054/5ac5220191adf69475fb57f9e303479c.pdf|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He refocused Venezuelan foreign policy on Latin American economic and social integration by enacting bilateral trade and reciprocal aid agreements, including his so-called &quot;oil diplomacy&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/la/displaystory.cfm?story_id=4232330 &quot;Using oil to spread revolution&quot; (retitled to &quot;Venezuela and Latin America&quot;)] ''The Economist'', (28 July 2005).

Bilateral trade relationships with other Latin American countries also played a major role in his policy, with Chávez increasing arms purchases from Brazil, forming oil-for-expertise trade arrangements with Cuba, and creating unique [[barter]] arrangements that exchange Venezuelan petroleum for cash-strapped Argentina's meat and dairy products. He also befriended [[pariah state]]s such as Belarus and Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mander|first1=Benedict|title=Venezuela: Up in smoke|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/e0cdedba-fe4e-11e1-8228-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3MgKtncKV|accessdate=23 December 2014|agency=Financial Times|date=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic mishandling of the country under Chávez prevented Venezuela from strengthening its position in the world.&lt;ref name=NOREF/&gt;

In June 2011, Chávez revealed in a televised address from [[Havana]], Cuba, that he was recovering from an operation to remove an abscessed tumor with cancerous cells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.eluniversal.com/2011/07/01/president-chavezs-address-to-the-nation.shtml &quot;President Chávez's address to the Nation&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703132105/http://english.eluniversal.com/2011/07/01/president-chavezs-address-to-the-nation.shtml |date=3 July 2011 }}. ''[[El Universal (Caracas)|El Universal]]'', 1 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Vice President [[Elías Jaua]] declared that the president remained in &quot;full exercise&quot; of power and that there was no need to transfer power due to his absence from the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.eluniversal.com/2011/07/01/venezuelan-vp-rules-out-declaring-temporary-absence-of-chavez.shtml |title=Venezuelan VP rules out declaring temporary absence of Chávez |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514200548/http://english.eluniversal.com/2011/07/01/venezuelan-vp-rules-out-declaring-temporary-absence-of-chavez.shtml |archivedate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 July, the Venezuelan government denied, however, that Chávez's tumor had been completely removed, further stating that he was heading for &quot;complete recovery&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/www/site/p_contenido.php?q=nodo/218578/Naci%C3%B3n/Maduro:-Presidente-Ch%C3%A1vez-no-tiene-c%C3%A1ncer-de-colon |title=Maduro niega que haya secretismo sobre salud de Chávez |work=[[El Nacional (Caracas)|El Nacional]] |date=3 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120405073232/http://www.el-nacional.com/www/site/p_contenido.php?q=nodo/218578/Naci%C3%B3n/Maduro:-Presidente-Ch%C3%A1vez-no-tiene-c%C3%A1ncer-de-colon |archivedate=5 April 2012 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 July 2011, television news reported that Chávez had returned to Cuba for further cancer treatments.&lt;ref&gt;[[WCBS-TV]] (New York) morning news report, 17 July 2011, 07:40&amp;nbsp;am&lt;/ref&gt;

Chávez gave a public appearance on 28 July 2011, his 57th birthday, in which he stated that his health troubles had led him to radically reorient his life towards a &quot;more diverse, more reflective and multi-faceted&quot; outlook, and he went on to call on the middle classes and the [[private sector]] to get more involved in his Bolivarian Revolution, something he saw as &quot;vital&quot; to its success.&lt;ref&gt;[[#BBC11b|BBC News 2011b]].&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after this speech, in August Chávez announced that his government would nationalize Venezuela's gold industry, taking it over from Russian-controlled company [[Rusoro]], while at the same time also moving the country's gold stocks, which were largely stored in western banks, to banks in Venezuela's political allies like Russia, China and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gua11|''The Guardian'' 2011]].&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 July 2012, Chávez declared himself fully recovered from cancer just three months before the [[2012 Venezuelan presidential election]], which he won, securing a fourth term as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Naranjo and Cawthorne|first=Mario and Andrew|title=Venezuela's Chávez says &quot;totally free&quot; of cancer, again|url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/venezuelas-chavez-says-totally-free-cancer-215250526.html|publisher=Yahoo News|accessdate=9 July 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712090918/http://ca.news.yahoo.com/venezuelas-chavez-says-totally-free-cancer-215250526.html |archivedate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2012, Chávez announced plans to travel to Cuba for more medical treatment for cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hugo Chávez heading to Cuba for more treatment|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57554992/hugo-chavez-heading-to-cuba-for-more-treatment/|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=27 November 2012|date=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| quote = Venezuela’s hybrid regime, after Chávez’s death, became more selectively accommodating on the inside and more explicitly repressive on the outside. This allowed the regime to survive, but not to thrive. Regime survival was purchased at the cost of policy immobilism. And policy immobilism has left Venezuela with the deepest economic crisis in Venezuela’s history.

After defecting from Venezuela, former bodyguard for Chávez, [[Leamsy Salazar]], stated that he died in December 2012, months before his date was officially announced.&lt;ref name=&quot;INFOBAEjan2015&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.infobae.com/2015/01/29/1623711-el-jefe-seguridad-chavez-declaro-que-el-caudillo-murio-dos-meses-antes-la-fecha-oficial|title=El jefe de Seguridad de Chávez declaró que el caudillo murió dos meses antes de la fecha oficial|date=29 January 2015|accessdate=30 January 2015|agency=[[Infobae]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018, former Attorney General [[Luisa Ortega Díaz]] also said that Chávez had actually died in December 2012 and the announcement of his death was delayed for political reasons. In an interview cited by Venezuelan daily [[El Nacional (Caracas)|''El Nacional'']], the former Chávez supporter said that the Venezuelan president died on 28 December, but his closest allies decided to delay the announcement and never submitted the death certificate to the Office of the Attorney General.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/politica/luisa-ortega-diaz-revelo-que-diosdado-cabello-llamo-morir-chavez_243720|title=Diosdado Cabello a Luisa Ortega Díaz: &quot;vente que Chávez se murió&quot;|last=Web|first=El Nacional|date=12 July 2018|work=El Nacional|access-date=12 July 2018|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supposed delay in announcing Chávez's death raised concerns that laws signed in his name during that period were forged for political purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;INFOBAEjan2015&quot;/&gt;

His death triggered a constitutional requirement that a [[2013 Venezuelan presidential election|presidential election]] be called within 30 days. Maduro, Chavez's vice president, was elected president on 14 April 2013.

The United States-based ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine included Chávez among their list of the world's [[Time 100|100 most influential people]] in 2005 and 2006, noting the spreading of his anti-globalization efforts and anti-US sentiment throughout Latin America.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[[#Pad05|Padgett 2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=influence&gt;[[#Pad06|Padgett 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2006 list compiled by the left wing British magazine ''[[New Statesman]]'', he was voted 11th in the list of &quot;Heroes of our time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cow06|Cowley 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the magazine included Chávez in its annual ''The World's 50 Most Influential Figures''.&lt;ref name=&quot;htanna&quot;&gt;[[#New10|''New Statesman'' 2010]].&lt;/ref&gt; His biographers Marcano and Tyszka believed that within only a few years of his presidency, he &quot;had already earned his place in history as the president most loved and most despised by the Venezuelan people, the president who inspired the greatest zeal and the deepest revulsion at the same time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

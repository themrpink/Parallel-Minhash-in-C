Manhattan is well known for its street [[parade]]s, which celebrate a broad array of themes, including holidays, nationalities, human rights, and major league sports team championship victories. The majority of higher profile parades in New York City are held in Manhattan. The primary orientation of the annual street parades is typically from north to south, marching along major avenues.

Since New York City's consolidation in 1898, Manhattan has been governed by the [[New York City Charter]], which has provided for a strong [[Mayor–council government|mayor–council system]] since its revision in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abcny.org/pdf/Report%20on%20Ballot%20Proposals.pdf &quot;Report on Ballot Proposals of the 2003 New York City Charter Revision Commission&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001013817/http://www.abcny.org/pdf/Report%20on%20Ballot%20Proposals.pdf |date=October 1, 2009 }} (PDF), [[Association of the Bar of the City of New York]]. Accessed May 11, 2007. &quot;Unlike most cities that employ nonpartisan election systems, New York City has a very strong mayor system and, following the 1989 Charter Amendments, an increasingly powerful City Council.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The centralized New York City government is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, libraries, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, [[New York City water supply system|water supply]], and welfare services in Manhattan.

The office of [[Borough President]] was created in the consolidation of 1898 to balance centralization with local authority. Each borough president had a powerful administrative role derived from having a vote on the [[New York City Board of Estimate]], which was responsible for creating and approving the city's budget and proposals for land use. In 1989, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] declared the Board of Estimate unconstitutional because Brooklyn, the most populous borough, had no greater effective representation on the Board than Staten Island, the least populous borough, a violation of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment's]] [[Equal Protection Clause]] pursuant to the high court's 1964 &quot;one man, one vote&quot; decision.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0489_0688_ZS.html Cornell Law School Supreme Court Collection: Board of Estimate of City of New York v.

Starting in the mid-19th century, the United States became a magnet for immigrants seeking to escape poverty in their home countries. After arriving in New York, many new arrivals ended up living in squalor in the [[slum]]s of the [[Five Points, Manhattan|Five Points]] neighborhood, an area between [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] and the [[Bowery]], northeast of [[New York City Hall]].

During Manhattan's early history, wood construction and poor access to water supplies left the city vulnerable to fires.

With each combined street and block adding up to about {{convert|260|ft|m}}, there are almost exactly 20&amp;nbsp;blocks per mile. The typical block in Manhattan is {{convert|250|by|600|ft|m}}.

According to the original Commissioner's Plan, there were [[155th Street (Manhattan)|155]] numbered crosstown streets,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/23/realestate/23scap.html |title=Are Manhattan's Right Angles Wrong, by Christopher Gray |access-date=May 11, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502035251/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/23/realestate/23scap.html |archive-date=May 2, 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; but later the grid was extended up to the northernmost corner of Manhattan, where the last numbered street is [[220th Street (Manhattan)|220th Street]]. Moreover, the numbering system continues even in [[The Bronx]], north of Manhattan, despite the fact that the grid plan is not as regular in that borough, whose last numbered street is 263rd Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gis.nyc.gov/doitt/nycitymap/ |title=New York City Map |publisher=NYC.gov |access-date=May 7, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731043934/http://gis.nyc.gov/doitt/nycitymap/ |archive-date=July 31, 2017 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen crosstown streets were designated as {{convert|100|ft|m}} wide, including [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th]], [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd]], [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th]] and [[125th Street (Manhattan)|125th]] Streets,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.cornell.edu/Reps/DOCS/nyc1811.htm Remarks of the Commissioners for laying out streets and roads in the City of New York, under the Act of April 3, 1807] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610165318/http://www.library.cornell.edu/Reps/DOCS/nyc1811.htm |date=June 10, 2007 }}, [[Cornell University]]. Accessed May 2, 2007. &quot;These streets are all sixty feet wide except fifteen, which are one hundred feet wide, viz.: Numbers fourteen, twenty-three, thirty-four, forty-two, fifty-seven, seventy-two, seventy-nine, eighty-six, ninety-six, one hundred and six, one hundred and sixteen, one hundred and twenty-five, one hundred and thirty-five, one hundred and forty-five, and one hundred and fifty-five—the block or space between them being in general about two hundred feet.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; which became some of the borough's most significant transportation and [[shopping]] venues. [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] is the most notable of many exceptions to the grid, starting at [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]] in Lower Manhattan and continuing north into the Bronx at Manhattan's northern tip. In much of Midtown Manhattan, Broadway runs at a diagonal to the grid, creating major named intersections at [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] ([[Park Avenue|Park Avenue South/Fourth Avenue]] and 14th Street), [[Madison Square]] ([[Fifth Avenue]] and 23rd Street), [[Herald Square]] ([[Sixth Avenue]] and 34th Street), [[Times Square]] ([[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]] and 42nd Street), and [[Columbus Circle]] ([[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]]/[[Central Park West]] and 59th Street). 

&quot;Crosstown traffic&quot; refers primarily to vehicular traffic between Manhattan's [[East Side (Manhattan)|East Side]] and [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]]. The trip is notoriously frustrating for drivers because of heavy [[traffic congestion|congestion]] on narrow local streets laid out by the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, absence of express roads other than the [[Trans-Manhattan Expressway]] at the far north end of Manhattan Island; and restricted to very limited crosstown automobile travel within [[Central Park]]. Proposals in the mid-1900s to build express roads through the city's densest neighborhoods, namely the [[Mid-Manhattan Expressway]] and [[Lower Manhattan Expressway]], did not go forward. Unlike the rest of the United States, New York State prohibits right or left turns on red in cities with a population greater than one million, to reduce traffic collisions and increase pedestrian safety. In New York City,  therefore, all turns at red lights are illegal unless a sign permitting such maneuvers is present, significantly shaping traffic patterns in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.safeny.ny.gov/roadrule.htm | title=Rules of the Road}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another consequence of the strict grid plan of most of Manhattan, and the grid's skew of approximately 28.9&amp;nbsp;degrees, is a phenomenon sometimes referred to as [[Manhattanhenge]] (by analogy with [[Stonehenge]]).&lt;ref name=Manhattanhenge&gt;{{cite news | last=Silverman | first=Justin Rocket | title=Sunny delight in city sight | newspaper=[[Newsday]] | date=May 27, 2006 | url=http://www.newsday.com/news/sunny-delight-in-city-sight-1.502140 | quote='Manhattanhenge' occurs Sunday, a day when a happy coincidence of urban planning and astrophysics results in the setting sun lining up exactly with every east-west street in the borough north of 14th Street.

In 1981, TSR also published the ''super-modules'' [[Descent into the Depths of the Earth|D1-2 ''Descent into the Depths of the Earth'']] and [[Against the Giants|G1-2-3 ''Against the Giants'']], both being compilations of previously published modules from the ''[[Drow (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Drow]]'' series and the ''Giant'' series respectively.

Numerous projects were planned to add more depth and detail to the setting after the publication of the initial folio, but many of these projects never appeared for various reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dragon #143&quot;/&gt;

==''World of Greyhawk'' boxed set (1983)==

[[File:Gygax83GreyhawkBoxCover.jpg|thumb|left|The box cover for ''[[World of Greyhawk Fantasy Game Setting]]'' boxed set (TSR, 1983)]]

In 1983, TSR published an expanded boxed set of the campaign world, ''World of Greyhawk'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gygax | first = Gary | author-link = Gary Gygax | title = World of Greyhawk Fantasy Game Setting | publisher = [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] | year = 1983 | location = Lake Geneva WI}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is usually called the ''Greyhawk boxed set'' to differentiate it from other editions. According to game designer [[Jim Bambra]], &quot;The second edition was much larger than the first and addressed itself to making the World of Greyhawk setting a more detailed and vibrant place.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dragon #143&quot;/&gt; This edition quadrupled the number of pages from the original edition to 128, adding significantly greater detail.  One major addition was a pantheon of deities: in addition to the nineteen deities outlined by Gygax in his ''Dragon'' article, another thirty-one new deities were added, though only three received full write-ups of their abilities and worshipers. This brought the number of Greyhawk deities to an even fifty.  For the next eight years, Greyhawk would be primarily defined by the information in this publication.

==After publication of the boxed set (1984–1985)==
Publication of the ''World of Greyhawk'' was the first step in Gygax's vision for [[Oerth]].&lt;ref&gt;Gygax: &quot;Had I remained in creative control of the D&amp;D game line at TSR one of the projects I planned was the complete development of the Oerth world setting, and production of source nodules for the various states and outstanding features of the Flanaess&amp;mdash;such as the Roft Canyon, the Sea of Dust, etc.&quot;{{cite web | title = Gary Gygax: Q &amp; A (Part XII, Page 12) | publisher = EN World | date = 2006-09-22 | url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/171753-gary-gygax-q-part-xii-12.html | access-date = 2009-03-15 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121005021342/http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/171753-gary-gygax-q-part-xii-12.html | archive-date = 2012-10-05 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few years, he planned to unveil other areas of the continent of Oerik, giving each new area the same in-depth treatment of history, geography, and politics as had been accorded the Flanaess.&lt;ref&gt;Q: &quot;What direction would have Greyhawk gone? How different would it be today?&quot; Gygax: &quot;There would be a complete globe with more continents and states thereon.&quot;{{cite web | title = Gary Gygax: Q &amp; A (Part II, Page 19) | publisher = EN World | date = 2003-04-05 | url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/38912-q-gary-gygax-continuation-thread-part-ii-19.html | access-date = 2009-03-15 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110615030108/http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/38912-q-gary-gygax-continuation-thread-part-ii-19.html | archive-date = 2011-06-15 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gygax had also mapped out the other hemisphere of Oerth in his personal notes.&lt;ref&gt;Gygax: I did intend to expand the WoG setting to cover the complete planet... No real work had been done on this project, though, when I parted from TSR at the end of 1985.&quot; {{cite web | title = Gary Gygax: Q &amp; A (Part VI, Page 4) | publisher = EN World | date = 2004-02-29 | url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/76849-gary-gygax-q-part-vi-4.html | access-date = 2009-03-15 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121005021435/http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/76849-gary-gygax-q-part-vi-4.html | archive-date = 2012-10-05 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this would be Gygax's work,&lt;ref&gt;Gygax: &quot;I had plans to create material detailing the various states and major terrain features of the world setting, as well as completing the world with a second boxed set.&quot;&quot;{{cite web | title = Gary Gygax: Q &amp; A (Part XIII, Page 10) | publisher = EN World | date = 2007-04-26 | url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/193204-gary-gygax-q-part-xiii-10.html | access-date = 2009-03-15 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121005021601/http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/193204-gary-gygax-q-part-xiii-10.html | archive-date = 2012-10-05 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; but Len Lakofka and [[François Marcela-Froideval|François Froideval]] had also created material that Gygax wanted to place on Oerth.&lt;ref&gt;Gygax: &quot;Francois had a map of a continent and some islands to the east, and they were going to be added. The &quot;Orient&quot; was actually to be past them, closer to the West Coast of Oerik... Len Lakofka had an eastern continental addition as well as the Lendore Isles, so what I planned to so{{Clarify|date=May 2015}} was incorporate Francois' and Len's maps with Oerik, complete the lower continent below it, and have a real globe.&quot; {{cite web|title=Gary Gygax: Q &amp; A (Part VI, Page 4) |publisher=EN World |date=2005-03-03 |url=http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/121380-gary-gygax-q-part-viii-9.html |access-date=2009-03-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005021702/http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/121380-gary-gygax-q-part-viii-9.html |archive-date=October 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Mentzer]], Creative Consultant at TSR at the time, wrote four [[RPGA]] tournament adventures taken from his home campaign setting of ''Aquaria'' (published by TSR as the first four of the R-series modules: R1 ''[[To the Aid of Falx]]'', R2 ''[[The Investigation of Hydell]]'', R3 ''[[The Egg of the Phoenix]]'', and R4 ''[[Doc's Island]]'').  Mentzer envisioned them as the first part of a new ''Aqua-Oeridian'' campaign set somewhere on Oerth outside of the Flanaess.

However, by this time, Gygax was in Hollywood on a semi-permanent basis, approving scripts for the Saturday morning ''[[D&amp;D cartoon|Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' cartoon series and trying to land a deal for a ''D&amp;D'' movie. Not only was Gygax's own output of Greyhawk-related materials greatly reduced, but the company began to shift its focus and resources away from Greyhawk to a new campaign setting called ''[[Dragonlance]]''.[[File:SagaofOldCityCover.jpg|right|thumb|''Saga of Old City'' by [[Gary Gygax]] (TSR, 1985); Cover art by [[Clyde Caldwell]]. The first ''Greyhawk Adventures'' novel, and the first featuring &quot;Gord the Rogue&quot;.]]&lt;!-- FAIR USE of SagaofOldCityCover.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:SagaofOldCityCover.jpg for rationale --&gt;

The success of the Dragonlance series of modules and books pushed aside the World of Greyhawk setting, as TSR concentrated on expanding and defining the world of [[Krynn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dragon #143&quot;/&gt; One of the factors that contributed to the success of the ''Dragonlance'' setting when it was published in 1984 was a series of concurrent novels by [[Tracy Hickman]] and [[Margaret Weis]].  Gygax realized that novels set in Greyhawk could have a similar benefit for his campaign world and wrote ''[[Saga of Old City]]'', the first in a series of novels that would be published under the banner ''Greyhawk Adventures''. The protagonist was [[Gord the Rogue]], and this first novel told of his rise from the Slum Quarters of the city of Greyhawk to become a world traveler and thief extraordinaire. The novel was designed to promote sales of the boxed set by providing colorful details about the social customs and peoples of various cities and countries around the Flanaess.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Before ''Saga of Old City'' was released in November 1985, Gygax wrote a sequel, ''[[Artifact of Evil]]''. He also wrote a short story, &quot;At Moonset Blackcat Comes&quot;, that appeared in the special 100th issue of ''Dragon'' in August 1985.  This introduced Gord the Rogue to gamers just before ''Saga of Old City'' was scheduled to be released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gygax | first = Gary | author-link=Gary Gygax | title = At Moonset Blackcat Comes | journal = Dragon | issue = 100| page = 22| publisher = TSR | location = Lake Geneva WI | date = August 1985}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greyhawk modules===
In the two years after the Greyhawk boxed set appeared, TSR published eight adventures set in Greyhawk.  Five were written or co-written by Gygax, and the other three were from TSR's United Kingdom division:
* [[Dungeonland|EX1 ''Dungeonland'']] (Gary Gygax, 1983)
* [[Land Beyond the Magic Mirror|EX2 ''Land Beyond the Magic Mirror'']] (Gary Gygax, 1983)
Both of the EX adventures, although nominally set in Greyhawk, transported characters through a planar gate into an alternate reality.
* [[Beyond the Crystal Cave|UK1 ''Beyond the Crystal Cave'']] (Dave Brown, Tom Kirby &amp; [[Graeme Morris (game designer)|Graeme Morris]], 1983)
* [[The Sentinel (module)|UK2 ''The Sentinel'']] (Graeme Morris, 1983)
* [[The Gauntlet (module)|UK3 ''The Gauntlet'']] (Graeme Morris, 1984)
* [[Mordenkainen's Fantastic Adventure|WG5 ''Mordenkainen's Fantastic Adventure'']] (Robert Kuntz &amp; Gary Gygax, 1984)
* [[Isle of the Ape|WG6 ''Isle of the Ape'']] (Gary Gygax, 1985)
* [[The Temple of Elemental Evil|T1–4 ''The Temple of Elemental Evil'']] (Gary Gygax &amp; Frank Mentzer, 1985)

===''Dragon'' articles===
From 1983–1985, the only notable supplement for the Greyhawk world was a five-part article by Len Lakofka in the June–October and December 1984 issues of ''Dragon'' that detailed the Suel gods who had been briefly mentioned in the boxed set.  In the December 1984 issue, Gygax mentioned clerics of non-human races and indicated that the twenty four demihuman and humanoid deities that had been published in the February–June 1982 issues of ''Dragon'' were now permitted in Greyhawk; this increased the number of Greyhawk deities from fifty to seventy four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gygax| first = Gary | author-link = Gary Gygax | title = From the Sorcerer's Scroll: Clerics live by other rules | journal = Dragon | issue = 92 | page = 22| publisher = TSR | location = Lake Geneva WI |date=December 1984}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than those articles, Greyhawk was only mentioned in passing in three other issues until Gygax's &quot;Gord the Rogue&quot; short story in the August 1985 issue ''Dragon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Heard| first = Bruce | title = Spells between the covers | journal = Dragon | issue = 82 | page = 55 | publisher = TSR | location = Lake Geneva WI |date=February 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Moore| first = Roger E. | author-link=Roger E.

===Gygax departs===
Shortly after the release of the boxed set, Gygax discovered that while he had been in Hollywood, TSR had run into serious financial difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Gygax: &quot;I was alerted to a problem: Kevin Blume was shopping TSR on the street in New York City. I flew back from the West Coast, and discovered the corporation was in debt to the bank the tune of circa $1.5 million.&quot; {{cite web | title = Gary Gygax: Q &amp; A (Part XII, Page 28) | publisher = EN World | date = 2007-01-21 | url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/171753-gary-gygax-q-part-xii-28.html | access-date = 2009-03-15 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110614223453/http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/171753-gary-gygax-q-part-xii-28.html | archive-date = 2011-06-14 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Lake Geneva, Gygax managed to get TSR back on firm financial footing. However, different visions of TSR's future caused a power struggle within the company, and Gygax was forced out of TSR on December 31, 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  Rausch  | first = Allen   | title = Magic &amp; Memories: The Complete History of Dungeons &amp; Dragons - Part II  | publisher = Game Spy | date = 2004-08-16  | url = http://pc.gamespy.com/articles/539/539197p5.html  | access-date = 2011-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the terms of his settlement with TSR, Gygax kept the rights to Gord the Rogue as well as all ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' characters whose names were anagrams or versions of his own name, such as Yrag and Zagyg.&lt;ref&gt;Gygax: &quot;Anagrams of my name are exclusively my property according to my settlement agreement with TSR, so that is how I can use Zagyg, or Zagig, as well as Yrag.&quot;{{cite web | title = Gary Gygax: Q &amp; A (Part IX, Page 91) | publisher = EN World | date = 2005-10-20 | url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/125997-gary-gygax-q-part-ix-91.html | access-date = 2009-03-15 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120319233434/http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/125997-gary-gygax-q-part-ix-91.html | archive-date = 2012-03-19 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he lost the rights to all his other work, including the world of Greyhawk and the names of all the other characters he had ever used in TSR material.

==Greyhawk without Gygax (1986–1987)==
After Gygax left TSR, the continued development of Greyhawk became the work of many writers and creative minds. Rather than continuing forward with Gygax's plan for an entire planet, the setting was never expanded beyond the Flanaess, nor would other authors' work be linked to unexplored areas of the continent Oerik.  According to Gygax, TSR's stewardship turned Greyhawk into something very different from what he had envisioned.&lt;ref&gt;Gygax: &quot;Later TSR and [Wizards of the Coast] approaches to and treatment of the Greyhawk setting was quite contrary to the purpose for which I intended it when it was created.&quot;{{cite web | title = Gary Gygax: Q &amp; A (Part XIII, Page 9) | publisher = EN World | date = 2007-04-25 | url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/193204-gary-gygax-q-part-xiii-9.html | access-date = 2009-03-15 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121005021114/http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/193204-gary-gygax-q-part-xiii-9.html | archive-date = 2012-10-05 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, in the months following Gygax's ousting, TSR turned away from development of Greyhawk and focused its energies on a new campaign setting called ''[[Forgotten Realms]]''.  In 1986 and 1987, only three Greyhawk modules were released, [[Scourge of the Slave Lords|A1-4 ''Scourge of the Slave Lords'']], [[Realms of Horror|S1-4 ''Realms of Horror'']] and [[Queen of the Spiders|GDQ1-7 ''Queen of the Spiders'']], all being collections of previously published modules rather than new material.

===Greyhawk novels continue without Gord the Rogue===
Gygax's novel ''Saga of Old City'', released in November 1985, and ''Artifact of Evil'', released two months after Gygax's departure from TSR, proved to be popular titles, and in 1987, TSR hired [[Rose Estes]] to continue the series, albeit without Gord the Rogue, to whom Gygax had retained all rights.  From 1987–1989, Estes produced five more novels under the ''Greyhawk Adventures'' banner: ''Master Wolf'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Estes | first = Rose | author-link = Rose Estes | title = Master Wolf | publisher = TSR | date = April 1987 | location = Lake Geneva | isbn = 0-88038-457-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Price of Power'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Estes | first = Rose | author-link = Rose Estes | title = The Price of Power | publisher = TSR | date = August 1987 | location = Lake Geneva | isbn = 0-88038-458-1 | url = https://archive.org/details/priceofpowergrey00rose }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Demon Hand'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Estes | first = Rose | author-link = Rose Estes | title = The Demon Hand | publisher = TSR | date = March 1988 | location = Lake Geneva | isbn = 0-88038-542-1 | url = https://archive.org/details/demonhandjourney00este }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Name of the Game'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Estes | first = Rose | author-link = Rose Estes | title = The Name of the Game | publisher = TSR | date = July 1988 | location = Lake Geneva | isbn = 0-88038-614-2 | url = https://archive.org/details/nameofgamejourne00este }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Eyes Have It''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Estes | first = Rose | author-link = Rose Estes | title = The Eyes Have It | publisher = TSR | date = September 1989 | location = Lake Geneva | isbn = 0-88038-755-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sixth book, ''Dragon in Amber'', appeared in 1990 book catalogs, but was never written, and the series was discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Greyhawk Novels| url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Greyhawk-Novels/lm/R1N5CG54R01CCY | publisher= Amazon Books| date=2007-03-15 | access-date=2009-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The dungeons of Greyhawk revealed===
In its 1986 Summer Mail Order Hobby Shop catalog, TSR had listed a new Greyhawk adventure called WG7 ''Shadowlords'', a high-level adventure to be written by Gary Gygax and [[Skip Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = World of Greyhawk Series (WG4 - 12) | publisher = The Acaeum | url = http://www.acaeum.com/ddindexes/modpages/wg.html | access-date = 2009-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this adventure was canceled after Gygax left TSR, and the catalog number WG7 was reassigned to a new adventure, ''Castle Greyhawk'', released in 1988. It was the first new Greyhawk adventure in three years, but it had nothing to do with Gygax's original Castle Greyhawk. Instead, it was a compilation of twelve humorous dungeon levels, each one written by a freelance author. The puns and jokes often referenced modern culture—[[Spider-Man|the Amazing Driderman]], [[Burger King|King Burger]], [[Bugs Bunny|Bugsbear Bunny]], and the crew of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''—and the module also included an appearance by Gygax's Mordenkainen in a movie studio.

==Greyhawk revived (1988–1990)==
By 1988, with the first series of ''Dragonlance'' adventures drawing to a close, and ''Forgotten Realms'' doing very well, TSR turned back to Greyhawk. In the January 1988 issue of ''Dragon'', Jim Ward—one of the original players in the dungeons of Greyhawk, creator of the wizard Drawmij, and now working for TSR in the post-Gygax era—requested player input about what should be included in a hardcover source book for Greyhawk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ward | first = James A. | author-link = Jim Ward (game designer) | title = The Game Wizards: A volume of Oerthly Delight | journal = Dragon | issue = 129 | page = 57 | publisher = TSR | location = Lake Geneva WI |date=January 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He received over five hundred letters in response.&lt;ref name=dragon135&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ward | first = James A. | author-link = Jim Ward (game designer) | title = The Game Wizards: Readers speak out on Greyhawk Adventures | journal = Dragon | issue = 135 | page = 30 | publisher = TSR | location = Lake Geneva WI | date = August 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the August 1988 issue of ''Dragon'', he outlined the ideas from readers that had been included,&lt;ref name=dragon135 /&gt; and ''[[Greyhawk Adventures]]'' appeared shortly afterward as a response to requests from Greyhawk fans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dragon #143&quot;/&gt;  The book's title was borrowed from Rose Estes' ''Greyhawk Adventures'' line of novels and used the same front-cover banner design.  It was the thirteenth and final hardcover book published for the 1st edition ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' rules.

The contents were designed to give [[Dungeon Master]]s ideas and play opportunities unique to the Greyhawk world, including new monsters, magical spells and items, a variety of geographical features, profiles of prominent citizens, and the [[incarnation|avatars]] of deities. In the time since Gygax had left TSR, no original Greyhawk material had been published, and many letter writers had requested ideas for new adventures. Ward responded by including six plot outlines that could be inserted into a Greyhawk campaign.

===''The City of Greyhawk'' boxed set===
{{See also|The City of Greyhawk}}
The publication of ''Greyhawk Adventures'' came just as TSR released the [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons#Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd edition|2nd edition of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'']].  TSR released ''[[The City of Greyhawk]]'' boxed set in 1989 under the ''Greyhawk Adventures'' banner.  Written by [[Carl Sargent]] and Rik Rose, this was not the city created by Gygax and Kuntz, but a new plan built from references made in previously published material.

This release remolded Gary Gygax's old Circle of Eight into a new plot device. Instead of a group of eight companions based in the Obsidian Citadel who left periodically to fight evil, the Circle became eight wizards led by a ninth wizard, Gygax's former character [[Mordenkainen]].  In addition to Mordenkainen, seven of the wizards were previously existing characters from Gygax's original home game: Bigby, Otiluke, Drawmij, Tenser, Nystul, Otto, and Rary. The eighth was new: the female wizard Jallarzi Sallavarian. The Circle's mandate was to act as neutral referees between Good and Evil, never letting one side or the other gain the upper hand for long. In addition, Sargent &amp; Rose took Gygax's original Obsidian Citadel, re-purposed it as Mordenkainen's castle, and placed it in an unspecified location in the [[Yatil Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Sargent  | first1 = Carl  | author-link = Carl Sargent | last2 = Rose  | first2 = Rik  |  title = The City of Greyhawk: Folks, Feuds and Factions | place = Lake Geneva WI  | publisher = TSR, Inc.  | year = 1989  | chapter = 3  | pages = 20–27  | isbn = 0-88038-731-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, in conjunction with this boxed set, TSR published a trilogy of ''World of Greyhawk'' Adventure (WGA) modules by Richard &amp; Anne Brown—WGA1 ''[[Falcon's Revenge]]'', WGA2 ''[[Falconmaster]]'' and WGA3 ''Flames of the Falcon''—set in the city and centered on a mysterious villain called The Falcon.  A fourth WGA module, [[Vecna Lives!|WGA4 ''Vecna Lives!'']] by David Cook, was published the same year, and featured the first appearance by [[Vecna]], formerly a mythic [[lich (D&amp;D)|lich]] in ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' lore, now promoted to demigod status.

===Modules released under the ''Greyhawk Adventures'' banner===
TSR also released five new ''World of Greyhawk'' (WG) adventures which used the ''Greyhawk Adventures'' banner:
* [[Fate of Istus|WG8 ''Fate of Istus'']] (Various authors, 1989)
* [[Gargoyle (module)|WG9 ''Gargoyle'']] (Dave Collins &amp; Skip Williams, 1989)
* [[Child's Play (module)|WG10 ''Child's Play'']] (Jean Rabe &amp; Skip Williams, 1989)
* [[Puppets (module)|WG11 ''Puppets'']] (Vince Garcia &amp; Bruce Rabe, 1989)
* [[Vale of the Mage|WG12 ''Vale of the Mage'']] (Jean Rabe, 1989)

In 1990, TSR also published [[Greyhawk Ruins|WGR1 ''Greyhawk Ruins'']], a module and source book about Castle Greyhawk by TSR writers Blake Mobley and [[Timothy Brown (game designer)|Timothy Brown]]. Although this was not the Castle Greyhawk of Gygax and Kuntz, it was the first serious attempt to publish details of the castle.

==A new vision of the Flanaess (1991–1997)==
Game designer [[Rick Swan]] noted the apparent lack of a central vision for Greyhawk material, describing the Greyhawk setting up to this point as &quot;a crazy quilt, where odd-shaped scraps of material are randomly sewn together and everybody hopes for the best. How else to explain a setting that encompasses everything from the somber A1-4 ''Scourge of the Slave Lords'' adventure to the King Kong-inspired WG6 ''Isle of the Ape'' to the cornball humor of WG7 ''Castle Greyhawk''? It makes for an interesting mess, but it's a mess nonetheless... ''[[The City of Greyhawk]]'' [is] the most credible attempt at smoothing out the rough spots.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dragon #198&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| last = Swan| first = Rick| author-link = Rick Swan| title = Role-playing Reviews| journal = [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]| issue = #198| pages = 49–51| publisher = [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]]| location = [[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]]|date=October 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, TSR decided that the decade-old world of Greyhawk needed to be refreshed.  Rather than follow through with Gary Gygax's plan to develop new regions beyond the boundaries of the [[Flanaess]], the decision was made to stay within the Flanaess and reinvigorate it by moving the campaign time line forward a decade, from 576&amp;nbsp;CY to 586&amp;nbsp;CY.  The main story vehicle would be a war fomented by an evil half-demon named Iuz that involved the entire Flanaess, which would allow TSR to radically alter the pattern of regions, alliances, and rulers from Gygax's original setting.

===The ''Greyhawk Wars''===
In order to move players from Gygax's familiar ''World of Greyhawk'' to their new vision, TSR planned a trilogy of modules that would familiarize players with events and conditions leading up to the coming war, and then take them through the war itself.  Once players completed the war via the three modules, a new boxed set would be published to introduce the new storyline and the new Flanaess.  Two ''World of Greyhawk Swords'' modules, [[Five Shall Be One|WGS1 ''Five Shall Be One'']] by [[Carl Sargent]] and [[Howl from the North|WGS2 ''Howl from the North'']] by [[Dale Henson]], were released in 1991.  These described events leading up to the war.

The third module was reworked into ''[[Greyhawk Wars (game)|Greyhawk Wars]]'', a strategy [[Miniature wargaming|war game]] that led players through the events, strategies, and alliances of the actual war.  A booklet included with the game, ''Greyhawk Wars Adventurer's Book'', described the event of the war.  In 582 CY (six years after Gygax's original setting of 576 CY), a regional conflict started by Iuz gradually widened until it was a war that affected almost every nation in the Flanaess.  A peace treaty was signed in the city of Greyhawk two years later, which is why the conflict became known as the ''Greyhawk Wars''.  On the day of the treaty-signing, Rary—once a minor spellcaster created and then discarded by Brian Blume, but now elevated by TSR to the Circle of Eight—attacked his fellow Circle members, aided and abetted by Robilar.  After the attack, Tenser and [[Otiluke]] were dead, while Robilar and Rary fled to the deserts of the [[Bright Lands]].  Rob Kuntz, original creator of Robilar, objected to this storyline, since he believed that Robilar would never attack his old adventuring companion Mordenkainen.  Although Kuntz did not own the creative rights to Robilar and no longer worked at TSR, he unofficially suggested an alternate storyline that Robilar had been visiting another plane and in his absence, a clone or evil twin of Robilar was responsible for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Robilar Remembers: Lord Robilar &amp; Co | publisher = Pied Piper Publishing | date = 2007-01-29 | url = http://site.pied-piper-publishing.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=65 | access-date = 2009-05-16 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090221002750/http://site.pied-piper-publishing.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=65 | archive-date = 2009-02-21 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''From the Ashes''===
In 1992, after the two ''World of Greyhawk Swords'' prequel modules and the ''Greyhawk Wars'' game had been on the market for some months, TSR released the new Greyhawk setting, ''[[From the Ashes (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|From the Ashes]]'', a boxed set primarily written by [[Carl Sargent]] that described the [[Flanaess]] in the aftermath of the ''Greyhawk Wars''.  It contained a large 4-color hex map of the area around the city of Greyhawk, a number of ''quick adventure cards'', and two 96-page books.

The first book, ''Atlas of the Flanaess'', was a replacement for Gygax's original ''World of Greyhawk'' boxed set, with some changes.  Many human gods from previous editions were not included, although one new demigod, [[Mayaheine]], was added. This had the net effect of reducing the total number of human deities from fifty to twenty-eight.  Deities of other races were increased from twenty-four to thirty-eight, but unlike the full descriptions that were given to the human gods, these were simply listed by name.   Like Gygax's original boxed set, each region was given a two to three hundred word description, although some details included in the older edition, such as trade goods, total population and racial mixes, were not included in this edition. A number of regions—Ahlissa, Almor, Medegia and South Province—no longer existed after the Wars or had been folded into other regions. One new region—the Olman Islands—was detailed. This had the net effect of reducing the total number of regions from sixty to fifty eight.  Darlene Pekul's large 4-color 2-piece fold-out map of the Flanaess included in Gygax's setting was reduced to a small black &amp; white map printed on the inside cover of the ''Atlas''.

The second book, the ''Campaign Book'', was designed to supplement, rather than replace, the four-year-old ''City of Greyhawk'' boxed set.  It included updates to the city and its environs, and gave details of some new non-player characters and possible adventure hooks.

In Gygax's setting, the major conflict had been between the Great Kingdom and the lands that were trying to free themselves from the evil overking.  In Sargent's world, the Great Kingdom storyline was largely replaced by the major new conflict between the land of Iuz and the regions that surrounded it.  Southern lands outside of Iuz's were threatened by the [[Scarlet Brotherhood]], while other countries had been invaded by monsters or taken over by agents of evil.  Overall, the vision was of a darker world where good folk were being swamped by a tide of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Sargent:&quot;The cult of Mayaheine is one considerably on the increase in beleaguered non-evil Flanaess lands, for Mayaheine is a demipower of protection and survival.&quot;{{cite book | last = Sargent | first = Carl | author-link = Carl Sargent | title = From the Ashes | publisher = TSR | year = 1992 | location = Lake Geneva WI | page = 95 | isbn = 1-56076-341-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Game designer Rick Swan concurred with this multi-step approach, writing that ''[[Greyhawk Wars (game)|Greyhawk Wars]]'' &quot;took another step in the right direction by shaking things up with a much-needed dose of epic conflict... veteran designer Carl Sargent has continued the overhaul with the ambitious ''[[From the Ashes (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|From the Ashes]]''. By combining heroic tradition with elements of dark fantasy, he's come up with a Greyhawk campaign that is both familiar and refreshingly unexpected.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dragon #198&quot;/&gt;

Sargent tried to generate interest for this grimmer vision of the Flanaess by following up with an article in ''Dragon'''s March 1993 issue, writing, &quot;...the powers of evil have waxed strong. The hand of Iuz, the Old One, extends across the central Flanaess, and the cruel Scarlet Brotherhood extends its power and influence around the southern lands bordering the Azure Sea. The ''World of Greyhawk'' setting has become a truly exciting world again...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Sargent | first = Carl | author-link = Carl Sargent | title = Campaign Journal: Greyhawk Adventures risen from the ashes | journal = Dragon | issue = 191 | pages = 64–68 |date=March 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boxed set was supported by the publication of two new source books in 1993, also written by Sargent.  [[The Marklands|WGR4 ''The Marklands'']] provided information about the good realms of Furyondy, Highfolk, and Nyrond that opposed Iuz, while [[Iuz the Evil|WGR5 ''Iuz the Evil'']] detailed information about the lands of Iuz, and emphasized the prominent new role that Iuz now played in the world order.

In addition, a number of adventures were also published, as much to provide more source material as for adventure:
* [[Patriots of Ulek|WGQ1 ''Patriots of Ulek'']] was the first module published after ''From the Ashes'', and advanced the storyline in [[Ulek States|Ulek]], threatened by invasion from Turrosh Mak of the [[Pomarj]].
* [[Treasures of Greyhawk|WGR2 ''Treasures of Greyhawk'']], by Jack Barker, Roy Rowe, Louis Prosperi, and Tom Prusa, was a loosely connected series of mini-adventures—for instance, exploring Bigby's home, travelling to the demiplane called The Great Maze of Zagyg, and trading riddles with a [[sphinx]]. Each mini-adventure focussed on a unique treasure in the Flanaess.
* [[Rary the Traitor|WGR3 ''Rary the Traitor'']] by [[Anthony Pryor]] was both an adventure module and a source book about the [[Bright Lands]], the new home of Rary and Robilar following their murder of Tenser and Otiluke.
* [[The City of Skulls|WGR6 ''The City of Skulls'']], by Carl Sargent, and [[Border Watch|WGM1 ''Border Watch'']], by Paul T. Riegel, were modules highlighting the struggle between [[Furyondy]] and the lands of Iuz.

As Gygax had done ten years before, Sargent also used the pages of ''Dragon'' to promote his new world. He was working on a new source book, ''[[Ivid the Undying]]'', and excerpted parts of it in the April, June and August 1994 issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Sargent | first = Carl | author-link = Carl Sargent | title = Campaign Journal: A strange alliance | journal = Dragon | issue = 204 | pages = 52–57 |date=April 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Sargent | first = Carl | author-link = Carl Sargent | title = Campaign Journal: The Sea Barons | journal = Dragon | issue = 206 | pages = 34–41 |date=June 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Sargent | first = Carl | author-link = Carl Sargent | title = Campaign Journal: The Adri Forest | journal = Dragon | issue = 208 | pages = 47–58 | date = August 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TSR drops Greyhawk===
In late 1994, TSR canceled Sargent's new book just as it was being readied for publication, and stopped work on all other Greyhawk projects.  Nothing more about Greyhawk was ever published by TSR, with one exception: in May 1995, a ''Dragon'' column devoted to industry gossip noted that the manuscript of ''Ivid the Undying'' had been released by TSR as a computer text file.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Anonymous | title = Rumblings: TSR publishes lost Greyhawk manuscript electronically | journal = Dragon | issue = 217 | page = 98 |date=May 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this file, several people have reconstructed the book as it might have appeared in published form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ivid the Undying | publisher = The Acaeum: Dungeons &amp; Dragons Knowledge Compendium | url = http://www.acaeum.com/library/ividundying.pdf | access-date = 2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1996, TSR found itself heavily in debt and unable to pay its printers.  Just as bankruptcy in 1997 seemed inevitable, [[Wizards of the Coast]] stepped in and, fueled by income from its [[collectible card game]] ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'', bought TSR and all its properties.&lt;ref name=30years /&gt;

==Wizards of the Coast (1998–2008)==
After Wizards of the Coast (WotC) and TSR merged, the determination was made that TSR had created too many settings for the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' game, and several of them were eliminated.&lt;ref name=30years /&gt; However, WotC's CEO, [[Peter Adkison]], was a fan of both ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' and Greyhawk,&lt;ref name=30years /&gt; and two major initiatives were created: a revival of Greyhawk, and a new third edition of ''D&amp;D'' rules.  A team of people was put together to revive the moribund Greyhawk setting by pulling together all the previously published information about it.  Once that was done, the decision was made to update Carl Sargent's storyline, using similar prequel adventures to pave the way for the updated campaign setting.

First, [[Roger E. Moore]] created ''[[Return of the Eight]]'' in 1998.  In the adventure, set in 586 CY, the same year as the ''From the Ashes'' boxed set, the players meet the surviving members of the Circle of Eight, which is called the Circle of Five because it is missing Tenser, Otiluke and Rary. If the players successfully finish the adventure, Tenser is rescued from death, though he refuses to rejoin the Circle, and the Circle is reconstituted as Eight with the addition of three new wizards: [[Alhamazad the Wise]], [[Theodain Eriason]] and [[Warnes Starcoat]].

Next, the ''[[Greyhawk Player's Guide]]'', by Anne Brown, was released. This 64-page booklet moved the storyline ahead five years to 591 CY, and it mostly condensed and reiterated material that had been released in Gygax's and Sargent's boxed sets.  New material included important non-player characters, a guide to [[roleplaying]] in the Flanaess, and some new sights.  The list of deities was both shrunk and expanded; the thirty-eight non-human deities in the ''From the Ashes'' boxed set were eliminated and non-human concerns assigned to a handful of human deities, but the list of human deities was expanded from twenty-four to fifty-four.

With the groundwork for a new storyline prepared, TSR/WotC released the new campaign setting as a 128-page source book, ''[[The Adventure Begins]]'', by [[Roger E. Moore]].  Taking its lead from the ''Greyhawk Player's Guide'', the new campaign world was set in 591 CY.  Unlike the darker feel of ''From the Ashes'', where the Flanaess was overrun by evil, Moore returned to Gygax's world of adventure.

The ''Lost Tombs'' trilogy of modules—''[[The Star Cairns]]'' and ''[[Crypt of Lyzandred the Mad]]'', by [[Sean K. Reynolds]], and ''[[The Doomgrinder]]'', by [[Steve Miller (game designer)|Steve Miller]]—were the first to be published in the new setting.

===''25th anniversary of D&amp;D''===
The year 1999 marked twenty-five years since the publication of the original ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' rules, and WotC sought to lure older gamers back to Greyhawk by producing a series of nostalgia-tinged ''Return to...'' adventures that evoked the best-known Greyhawk modules from 20 years before, under the banner ''25th Anniversary of D&amp;D'':
* ''[[Return to the Tomb of Horrors]]'', by [[Bruce R. Cordell]], reprinted Gary Gygax's [[Tomb of Horrors|S1 ''Tomb of Horrors'']], and added a substantial expansion.
* ''[[Return to the Keep on the Borderlands]]'', by [[John D. Rateliff]], took Gary Gygax's 1979 module, [[Keep on the Borderlands|B2 ''Keep on the Borderlands'']] and restocked it with fresh monsters, as if the twenty years that had passed since the original module's publication also equaled twenty years of game time. Although the original had been in a generic setting, the new adventure set the Keep in Greyhawk.
* ''[[Return to White Plume Mountain]]'', by [[Bruce R. Cordell]], likewise updated Lawrence Schick's twenty-year-old adventure, ''[[White Plume Mountain]]'', by advancing the storyline twenty years.
* ''[[Against the Giants: The Liberation of Geoff]]'', by Sean K. Reynolds, included the full text of Gygax's three original 1979 ''Giant'' modules and details of eighteen new adventure sites in [[Geoff (Greyhawk)|Geoff]], linked together as an integrated campaign.
* ''[[Slavers (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Slavers]]'' by Sean K. Reynolds and Chris Pramas, was a sequel to the original [[Scourge of the Slavelords|A1-4 ''Scourge of the Slavelords'']] series, set ten years after the original adventures.
* ''[[Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil]]'', by Monte Cook, returned the players to Gygax's infamous temple, which Rob Kuntz (as Robilar) had originally looted and wrecked.  It was published in 2001, using the 3rd edition rules.

In conjunction with the publication of the ''Return to'' adventures, WotC also produced a series of companion novels known as the ''Greyhawk Classics'' series: ''Against the Giants'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Emerson | first = Ru | title = Against the Giants | publisher = Wizards of the Coast | date = July 1999 | location = Renton WA | isbn = 0-7869-1379-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''White Plume Mountain'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kidd | first = Paul | title = White Plume Mountain | publisher = Wizards of the Coast | date = October 1999 | location = Renton WA | isbn = 0-7869-1424-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Descent into the Depths of the Earth'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kidd | first = Paul | title = Descent into the Depths of the Earth | publisher = Wizards of the Coast | date = June 2000 | location = Renton WA | isbn = 0-7869-1635-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Expedition to the Barrier Peaks'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Green | first = Roland J. | title = Expedition to the Barrier Peaks | publisher = Wizards of the Coast | date = November 2000 | location = Renton WA | isbn = 0-7869-1656-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Temple of Elemental Evil (novel)|The Temple of Elemental Evil]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Reid | first = Thomas M | title = [[The Temple of Elemental Evil (novel)|The Temple of Elemental Evil]] | publisher = Wizards of the Coast | date = May 2001 | location = Renton WA | isbn = 0-7869-1864-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Queen of the Demonweb Pits'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kidd | first = Paul | title = Queen of the Demonweb Pits | publisher = Wizards of the Coast | date = October 2001 | location = Renton WA | isbn = 0-7869-1903-5 | url = https://archive.org/details/queenofdemonwebp00kidd }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Keep on the Borderlands (novel)|Keep on the Borderlands]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Emerson | first = Ru | title = [[Keep on the Borderlands (novel)|Keep on the Borderlands]] | publisher = Wizards of the Coast | date = November 2001 | location = Renton WA | isbn = 0-7869-1881-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and ''The Tomb of Horrors''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Strohm | first = Keith Francis | title = The Tomb of Horrors | publisher = Wizards of the Coast | date = February 2002 | location = Renton WA | isbn = 0-7869-2702-X | url = https://archive.org/details/tombofhorrors00stro }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to attract players of other ''D&amp;D'' settings, WotC released ''[[Die, Vecna, Die!]]'', by Bruce R. Cordell and Steve Miller, a three-part adventure tying Greyhawk to the ''[[Ravenloft]]'' and ''[[Planescape]]''  campaign settings. Published in 2000, it was the last adventure to be written for ''D&amp;D'''s 2nd edition rules.

===Third edition===
In the editions of ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' published by TSR, the setting of the game had not been specifically defined—[[Dungeon Master]]s were expected to either create a new world, or purchase a commercial campaign setting such as Greyhawk or ''[[Forgotten Realms]]''. In 2000, after two years of work and [[playtest]]ing, WotC released the [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons#Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd edition|3rd edition of ''D&amp;D'']], and defined a default setting for the game for the first time. Under third edition rules, unless a Dungeon Master specifically chose to use a different campaign setting, his or her ''D&amp;D'' game would be set in the world of Greyhawk.

===''Living Greyhawk''===
{{Main|Living Greyhawk}}
[[File:Greyhawk Book.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Living Greyhawk Gazetteer]]'' ([[Wizards of the Coast]], 2000), an updated sourcebook for the campaign setting]]
With the release of the 3rd edition of ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', [[RPGA]]—the organized play division of WotC—announced a new massively shared [[living campaign]], ''[[Living Greyhawk]]'', modeled on a 2nd edition campaign called ''Living City''. Although ''[[Ravens Bluff#The Living City|Living City]]'' was relatively successful, RPGA wanted to expand the scope of their new campaign—instead of one city as a setting, the new campaign would involve thirty different regions of Greyhawk, each specifically keyed to a particular country, state, or province of the real world.  Each region would produce its own adventures, and in addition to these, RPGA would provide worldwide ''Core'' adventures.  To provide the level of detail needed for such a venture, WotC published the ''[[Living Greyhawk Gazetteer]]'', the most in-depth examination of the world of Greyhawk ever produced, and the official starting point for not only the campaign, but also for all home campaigns from that point forward.

Concurrent with the release of the 3rd edition ''[[Player's Handbook]]'', ''Living Greyhawk'' debuted at [[Gen Con]] 2000 with three ''Core'' adventures: COR1-1 ''Dragon Scales at Morningtide'', by [[Sean K. Reynolds]]; COR1-2 ''The Reckoning'', by Sean Flaherty and John Richardson; and COR1-3 ''River Of Blood'', by [[Erik Mona]].  WotC also released ''[[The Fright at Tristor]]'' by Keith Polster (2000), designed as an introductory adventure to the Living Greyhawk campaign world.

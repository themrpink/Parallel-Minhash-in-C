Han scholars such as [[Jia Yi]] (201–169 BC) portrayed the previous [[Qin dynasty]] as a brutal regime. However, archaeological evidence from [[Zhangjiashan Han bamboo texts|Zhangjiashan]] and [[Shuihudi Qin bamboo texts|Shuihudi]] reveal that many of the [[statute]]s in the Han [[Code (law)|law code]] compiled by Chancellor [[Xiao He]] (d.&amp;nbsp;193 BC) were derived from Qin law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hulsewé|1986|pp=525–526}}; {{harvp|Csikszentmihalyi|2006|pp=23–24}}; {{harvp|Hansen|2000|pp=110–112}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various cases for [[rape]], physical abuse and [[murder]] were prosecuted in court. Women, although usually having fewer rights by custom, were allowed to level civil and criminal charges against men.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hulsewé|1986|pp=523–530}}; {{harvp|Hinsch|2002|p=82}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While suspects were jailed, convicted criminals were never imprisoned. Instead, punishments were commonly monetary fines, periods of forced hard labor for convicts, and the penalty of death by beheading.{{sfnp|Hulsewé|1986|pp=532–535}} Early Han punishments of [[torture|torturous]] [[mutilation]] were borrowed from Qin law. A series of reforms abolished mutilation punishments with progressively less-severe beatings by the [[bastinado]].{{sfnp|Hulsewé|1986|pp=531–533}}

Acting as a judge in lawsuits was one of many duties of the [[County magistrate (China)|county magistrate]] and Administrators of commanderies. Complex, high-profile or unresolved cases were often deferred to the Minister of Justice in the capital or even the emperor.{{sfnp|Hulsewé|1986|pp=528–529}} In each Han county was several districts, each overseen by a [[chief of police]]. Order in the cities was maintained by government officers in the marketplaces and [[constable]]s in the neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nishijima|1986|pp=552–553, 576}}; {{harvp|Loewe|1968|pp=146–147}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common staple crops consumed during Han were [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[foxtail millet]], [[proso millet]], rice, and [[bean]]s.{{sfnp|Wang|1982|p=52}} Commonly eaten fruits and vegetables included chestnuts, pears, plums, peaches, melons, apricots, strawberries, [[red bayberry|red bayberries]], [[jujube]]s, [[calabash]], [[bamboo shoot]]s, [[mustard plant]] and [[taro]].{{sfnp|Wang|1982|pp=53, 206}} Domesticated animals that were also eaten included chickens, [[Mandarin duck]]s, geese, cows, sheep, pigs, camels and dogs (various types were bred specifically for food, while most were used as pets). Turtles and fish were taken from streams and lakes. Commonly hunted game, such as owl, pheasant, magpie, [[sika deer]], and [[Chinese bamboo partridge]] were consumed.{{sfnp|Wang|1982|pp=57–58}} Seasonings included sugar, honey, salt and [[soy sauce]].{{sfnp|Hansen|2000|pp=119–121}} [[Chinese alcoholic beverages|Beer and wine]] were regularly consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wang|1982|p=206}}; {{harvp|Hansen|2000|p=119}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The types of clothing worn and the materials used during the Han period depended upon social class. Wealthy folk could afford [[silk]] robes, skirts, socks, and mittens, coats made of [[Fur clothing|badger or fox fur]], duck plumes, and [[slippers]] with inlaid leather, [[pearl]]s, and silk lining. Peasants commonly wore clothes made of [[hemp]], [[wool]], and [[ferret]] skins.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wang|1982|pp=53, 59–63, 206}}; {{harvp|Loewe|1968|p=139}}; {{harvp|Ch'ü|1972|p=128}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Families throughout Han China made ritual sacrifices of animals and food to deities, spirits, and [[Ancestor worship|ancestors]] at [[Temple (Chinese)|temples and shrines]]. They believed that these items could be utilized by those in the spiritual realm.{{sfnp|Ch'ü|1972|pp=30–31}} It was thought that each person had a [[Hun and po|two-part soul]]: the spirit-soul (''hun'' 魂) which journeyed to the afterlife paradise of immortals (''[[Xian (Taoism)|xian]]''), and the body-soul (''po'' 魄) which remained in its grave or tomb on earth and was only reunited with the spirit-soul through a ritual ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hansen|2000|p=119}}; {{harvp|Csikszentmihalyi|2006|pp=140–141}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bronze Chimera, Eastern Han Dynasty.jpg|thumb|An Eastern-Han bronze statuette of a [[Qilin|mythical chimera]] (''qilin''), 1st century AD]]

In addition to his many other roles, the emperor acted as the highest priest in the land who made sacrifices to [[Tian|Heaven]], the main deities known as the [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors|Five Powers]], and the [[Shen (Chinese religion)|spirits]] (''shen'' 神) of mountains and rivers.{{sfnp|Ch'ü|1972|p=71}} It was believed that the three realms of Heaven, Earth, and Mankind were linked by natural cycles of [[yin and yang]] and the [[Wu Xing|five phases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Loewe|1994|p=55}}; {{harvp|Csikszentmihalyi|2006|p=167}}; {{harvp|Sun|Kistemaker|1997|pp=2–3}}; {{harvp|Ebrey|1999|pp=78 79}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If the emperor did not behave according to proper ritual, ethics, and morals, he could disrupt the fine balance of these cosmological cycles and cause calamities such as earthquakes, floods, droughts, epidemics, and swarms of locusts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ebrey|1999|pp=78–79}}; {{harvp|Loewe|1986|p=201}}; {{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=496, 592}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was believed that [[immortality]] could be achieved if one reached the lands of the [[Queen Mother of the West]] or [[Mount Penglai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Loewe|2005|pp=101–102}}; {{harvp|Csikszentmihalyi|2006|pp=116–117}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Han-era [[Daoism|Daoists]] assembled into small groups of hermits who attempted to achieve immortality through breathing exercises, sexual techniques and use of [[Elixir of life|medical elixirs]].{{sfnp|Hansen|2000|p=144}} 

By the 2nd century AD, Daoists formed large hierarchical religious societies such as the [[Way of the Five Pecks of Rice]]. Its followers believed that the sage-philosopher [[Laozi]] (fl.&amp;nbsp;6th century BC) was a holy [[prophet]] who would offer [[salvation]] and good health if his devout followers would [[Confession (religion)|confess their sins]], ban the worship of unclean gods who accepted meat sacrifices and chant sections of the ''[[Tao Te Ching|Daodejing]]''.{{sfnp|Hansen|2000|pp=144–146}}

[[Buddhism]] first entered China during the Eastern Han and was first mentioned in 65 AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;needham 1972 112&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Needham|1972|p=112}}; {{harvp|Demiéville|1986|pp= 821–822}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liu Ying (prince)|Liu Ying]] (d.&amp;nbsp;71 AD), a half-brother to [[Emperor Ming of Han]] (r.&amp;nbsp;57–75 AD), was one of its earliest Chinese adherents, although [[Chinese Buddhism]] at this point was heavily associated with [[Society and culture of the Han dynasty#Competing ideologies|Huang-Lao Daoism]].{{sfnp|Demiéville|1986|pp=821–822}} China's first known Buddhist temple, the [[White Horse Temple]], was constructed outside the wall of the capital, [[Luoyang]], during Emperor Ming's reign.{{sfnp|Demiéville|1986|p=823}} Important Buddhist canons were translated into Chinese during the 2nd century AD, including the ''[[Sutra of Forty-two Chapters]]'', ''[[Perfection of Wisdom]]'', ''[[Shurangama Sutra]]'', and ''[[Pratyutpanna Sutra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Akira|1998|pp=247–251}}; see also {{harvp|Needham|1972|p=112}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and politics==
{{main|Government of the Han dynasty}}
{{see also|List of emperors of the Han dynasty}}

===Central government===

[[File:Basket from Lo-lang.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A scene of historic paragons of filial piety conversing with one another, Chinese painted artwork on a [[Lacquerware|lacquered]] basketwork box, excavated from an Eastern-Han tomb of what was the Chinese [[Lelang Commandery]] in [[Korean Peninsula]].]]

In Han government, the emperor was the supreme judge and lawgiver, the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and sole designator of official nominees appointed to the top posts in central and local administrations; those who earned a [[Government of the Han dynasty#Salaries|600-bushel salary-rank or higher]].&lt;ref name=&quot;de Crespigny 2007 1216&quot;&gt;{{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|p=1216}}; {{harvp|Wang|1949|pp=141–143}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretically, there were no limits to his power. 

However, state organs with competing interests and institutions such as the court conference (''tingyi'' 廷議)—where ministers were convened to reach [[Consensus decision-making|majority consensus]] on an issue—pressured the emperor to accept the advice of his ministers on policy decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bielenstein|1980|p=144}}; {{harvp|Wang|1949|pp=173–177}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If the emperor rejected a court conference decision, he risked alienating his high ministers. Nevertheless, emperors sometimes did reject the majority opinion reached at court conferences.{{sfnp|Ch'ü|1972|pp=70–71}}

Below the emperor were his [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] members known as the [[Three Councillors of State]] (''San gong'' 三公). These were the [[Chancellor of China|Chancellor]] or [[Minister over the Masses]] (''Chengxiang'' 丞相 or ''Da situ'' 大司徒), the Imperial Counselor or Excellency of Works (''Yushi dafu'' 御史大夫 or ''Da sikong'' 大司空), and Grand Commandant or Grand Marshal (''Taiwei'' 太尉 or ''Da sima'' 大司馬).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|p=1221}}; {{harvp|Bielenstein|1980|pp=7–17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chancellor, whose title was changed to 'Minister over the Masses' in 8 BC, was chiefly responsible for drafting the [[government budget]]. The Chancellor's other duties included managing provincial registers for land and population, leading court conferences, acting as judge in lawsuits and recommending nominees for high office. He could appoint officials below the salary-rank of 600 bushels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wang|1949|pp=143–144, 145–146, 177}}; {{harvp|Bielenstein|1980|pp=7–8, 14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Imperial Counselor's chief duty was to conduct disciplinary procedures for officials. He shared similar duties with the Chancellor, such as receiving annual provincial reports. However, when his title was changed to Minister of Works in 8 BC, his chief duty became oversight of public works projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wang|1949|pp=147–148}}; {{harvp|Bielenstein|1980|pp=8–9, 15–16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grand Commandant, whose title was changed to Grand Marshal in 119 BC before reverting to Grand Commandant in 51 AD, was the irregularly posted commander of the military and then [[regent]] during the Western Han period. In the Eastern Han era he was chiefly a civil official who shared many of the same censorial powers as the other two Councillors of State.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wang|1949|p=150}}; {{harvp|Bielenstein|1980|pp=10–13}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rubbing of a Han Citang.JPG|thumb|left|A rubbing of a Han pictorial stone showing an [[Ancestor worship|ancestral worship hall]] (''citang'' 祠堂)]]
Ranked below the Three Councillors of State were the [[Nine Ministers]] (''Jiu qing'' 九卿), who each headed a specialized ministry. The Minister of Ceremonies (''Taichang'' 太常) was the chief official in charge of religious rites, rituals, prayers and the maintenance of ancestral temples and altars.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|p=1222}}; {{harvp|Wang|1949|p=151}}; {{harvp|Bielenstein|1980|pp=17–23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Minister of the Household (''Guang lu xun'' 光祿勳) was in charge of the emperor's security within the palace grounds, external imperial parks and wherever the emperor made an outing by chariot.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|p=1222}}; {{harvp|Bielenstein|1980|pp=23–24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minister of the Guards (''Weiwei'' 衛尉) was responsible for securing and patrolling the walls, towers, and gates of the imperial palaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|p=1223}}; {{harvp|Bielenstein|1980|p=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Minister Coachman (''Taipu'' 太僕) was responsible for the maintenance of imperial stables, horses, carriages and coach-houses for the emperor and his palace attendants, as well as the supply of horses for the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|p=1223}}; {{harvp|Bielenstein|1980|pp=34–35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Minister of Justice (''Tingwei'' 廷尉) was the chief official in charge of upholding, administering, and interpreting the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bielenstein|1980|p=38}}; {{harvp|Wang|1949|p=154}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Minister Herald (''Da honglu'' 大鴻臚) was the chief official in charge of receiving honored guests at the imperial court, such as nobles and [[Foreign relations of Imperial China|foreign ambassadors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=1223–1224}}; {{harvp|Bielenstein|1980|pp=39–40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Minister of the Imperial Clan (''Zongzheng'' 宗正) oversaw the imperial court's interactions with the empire's nobility and extended imperial family, such as granting fiefs and titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wang|1949|p=155}}; {{harvp|Bielenstein|1980|p=41}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Minister of Finance (''Da sinong'' 大司農) was the [[treasurer]] for the official bureaucracy and the armed forces who handled tax revenues and set standards for [[units of measurement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|p=1224}}; {{harvp|Bielenstein|1980|p=43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Minister Steward (''Shaofu'' 少府) served the emperor exclusively, providing him with entertainment and amusements, proper food and clothing, medicine and physical care, valuables and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|p=1224}}; {{harvp|Bielenstein|1980|p=47}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local government===

The Han empire, excluding kingdoms and marquessates, was divided, in descending order of size, into political units of [[Zhou (country subdivision)|provinces]], [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]], and [[Counties of China#History|counties]].{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|p=1228}} A county was divided into several districts (''xiang'' 鄉), the latter composed of a group of [[Hamlet (place)|hamlets]] (''li'' 里), each containing about a hundred families.{{sfnp|Bielenstein|1980|p=103}}{{sfnp|Nishijima|1986|pp=551–552}}

The heads of provinces, whose official title was changed from Inspector to Governor and vice versa several times during Han, were responsible for inspecting several commandery-level and kingdom-level administrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bielenstein|1980|pp=90–92}}; {{harvp|Wang|1949|pp=158–160}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of their reports, the officials in these local administrations would be promoted, demoted, dismissed or prosecuted by the imperial court.{{sfnp|Bielenstein|1980|p=91}}

A governor could take various actions without permission from the imperial court. The lower-ranked inspector had executive powers only during times of crisis, such as raising militias across the commanderies under his jurisdiction to suppress a rebellion.{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|p=1228}}

A commandery consisted of a group of counties, and was headed by an Administrator.{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|p=1228}} He was the top civil and military leader of the commandery and handled defense, lawsuits, seasonal instructions to farmers and recommendations of nominees for office sent annually to the capital in a quota system first established by Emperor Wu.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=1230–1231}}; {{harvp|Bielenstein|1980|p=96}}; {{harvp|Hsu|1965|pp=367–368}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The head of a large county of about 10,000 households was called a Prefect, while the heads of smaller counties were called Chiefs, and both could be referred to as [[Magistrate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|p=1230}}; {{harvp|Bielenstein|1980|p=100}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A Magistrate maintained law and order in his county, registered the populace for taxation, mobilized commoners for annual [[corvée]] duties, repaired schools and supervised public works.{{sfnp|Bielenstein|1980|p=100}}

===Kingdoms and marquessates===
{{main|Kings of the Han dynasty}}

Kingdoms—roughly the size of [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]]—were ruled exclusively by the emperor's male relatives as semi-autonomous [[fiefdom]]s. Before 157 BC some kingdoms were ruled by non-relatives, granted to them in return for their services to Emperor Gaozu. The administration of each kingdom was very similar to that of the central government.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hsu|1965|p=360}}; {{harvp|Bielenstein|1980|pp=105–106}}; {{harvp|Loewe|1986|p=126}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the emperor appointed the Chancellor of each kingdom, kings appointed all the remaining civil officials in their fiefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hsu|1965|p=360}}; {{harvp|Bielenstein|1980|pp=105–106}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 145 BC, after several insurrections by the kings, Emperor Jing removed the kings' rights to appoint officials whose [[Government of the Han dynasty#Salaries|salaries were higher than 400 bushels]].{{sfnp|Bielenstein|1980|pp=105–106}} The Imperial Counselors and Nine Ministers (excluding the Minister Coachman) of every kingdom were abolished, although the Chancellor was still appointed by the central government.{{sfnp|Bielenstein|1980|pp=105–106}}

With these reforms, kings were reduced to being nominal heads of their fiefs, gaining a personal income from only a portion of the taxes collected in their kingdom.{{sfnp|Ch'ü|1972|p=76}} Similarly, the officials in the administrative staff of a full marquess's fief were appointed by the central government. A marquess's Chancellor was ranked as the equivalent of a county Prefect. Like a king, the marquess collected a portion of the tax revenues in his fief as personal income.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|p=1230}}; {{harvp|Bielenstein|1980|p=108}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Flying Horse, East Han Dynasty.Bronze. Gansu Provincial Museum.jpg|thumb|The [[Gansu Flying Horse]], depicted in full gallop, [[bronze sculpture]], h 34.5 cm. [[Wuwei, Gansu|Wuwei]], [[Gansu]], China, AD 25–220]]

Up until the reign of [[Emperor Jing of Han]], the Emperors of the Han had great difficulty bringing the vassal kings under control, as kings often switched their allegiance to the [[Xiongnu]] [[Chanyu]] whenever threatened by Imperial attempts to centralize power. Within the seven years of Han Gaozu's reign, three vassal kings and one marquess either defected to or allied with  the Xiongnu. Even imperial princes in control of fiefdoms would sometimes invite the Xiongnu to invade in response to threats by the Emperor to remove their power. The Han emperors moved to secure a treaty with the Chanyu to demarcate authority between them, recognizing each other as the &quot;two masters&quot; (兩主), the sole representatives of their respective peoples, cemented with a marriage alliance (''[[heqin]]''), before eliminating the rebellious vassal kings in 154 BC. This prompted some vassal kings of the Xiongnu to switch their allegiance to the Han emperor from 147 BC. Han court officials were initially hostile to the idea of disrupting the status quo and expanding into the Xiongnu steppe territory. The surrendered Xiongnu were integrated into a parallel military and political structure under the Han Emperor, and opened the avenue for the Han dynasty to challenge the Xiongnu cavalry on the steppe. This also introduced the Han to the interstate networks in the Tarim Basin (Xinjiang), allowing for the expansion of the Han dynasty from a limited regional state to a universalist and cosmopolitan empire through further marriage alliances with another steppe power, the [[Wusun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ban Wang |title=Chinese Visions of World Order: Tianxia, Culture, and World Politics |date=2017 |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=978-0822372448 |pages=32–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the Han dynasty, every male commoner aged twenty-three was liable for [[conscription]] into the military. The minimum age for the military draft was reduced to twenty after [[Emperor Zhao of Han|Emperor Zhao's]] (r.&amp;nbsp;87–74 BC) reign.{{sfnp|Chang|2007|pp=70–71}} Conscripted soldiers underwent one year of training and one year of service as non-professional soldiers. The year of training was served in one of three branches of the armed forces: [[infantry]], [[cavalry]] or [[navy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nishijima 1986&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Nishijima|1986|p=599}}; {{harvp|Bielenstein|1980|p=114}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The year of active service was served either on the frontier, in a king's court or under the Minister of the Guards in the capital. A small professional (paid) standing army was stationed near the capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nishijima 1986&quot;/&gt;
[[File:EasternHan-ColouredPotteryFigurine-ShanghaiMuseum-May27-08.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A Han dynasty era pottery soldier, with a now-faded coating of paint, is missing a weapon.]]

During the Eastern Han, conscription could be avoided if one paid a commutable tax. The Eastern Han court favored the recruitment of a [[volunteer military|volunteer army]].{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=564–565, 1234}} The volunteer army comprised the Southern Army (''Nanjun'' 南軍), while the [[standing army]] stationed in and near the capital was the Northern Army (''Beijun'' 北軍).{{sfnp|Bielenstein|1980|pp=114–115}} Led by Colonels (''Xiaowei'' 校尉), the Northern Army consisted of five regiments, each composed of several thousand soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|p=1234}}; {{harvp|Bielenstein|1980|pp=117–118}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When central authority collapsed after 189 AD, wealthy landowners, members of the aristocracy/nobility, and regional military-governors relied upon their retainers to act as their own personal troops.{{sfnp|Ch'ü|1972|pp=132–133}} The latter were known as ''[[buqu]]'' 部曲, a special social class in Chinese history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=论魏晋南北朝时期的部曲及其演进|last=王|first=万盈|date=2004|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During times of war, the volunteer army was increased, and a much larger [[militia]] was raised across the country to supplement the Northern Army. In these circumstances, a General (''Jiangjun'' 將軍) led a [[Division (military)|division]], which was divided into [[regiment]]s led by Colonels and sometimes Majors (''Sima'' 司馬). Regiments were divided into [[company (military unit)|companies]] and led by Captains. [[Platoon]]s were the smallest units of soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|p=1234}}; {{harvp|Bielenstein|1980|pp=116, 120–122}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

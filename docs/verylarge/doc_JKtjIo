Many buildings in the area have a [[Mediterranean Revival architecture|Mediterranean Revival]] or [[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture|Spanish Colonial Revival]] architectural theme, initially inspired by [[Addison Mizner]], a resort architect who heavily influenced the city's early development. Still today, Boca Raton has a strict development code for the size and types of commercial buildings, building signs, and advertisements that may be erected within the city limits. No outdoor [[car dealership]]s are allowed in the municipality. No billboards are permitted; the city's only billboard was grandfathered in during annexation, such as near the Town Center Mall. The strict development code has led to several major thoroughfares without large signs or advertisements in the traveler's view.

==Etymology==
Boca Raton is labeled in the first European maps of the area as &quot;Boca de Ratones&quot;, and many people mistakenly translate the name in English as &quot;Rat's Mouth&quot;. Although incorrect (''ratón'' means &quot;mouse&quot; in Spanish; &quot;rat&quot; is ''rata''), this translation continues to be popularized by several residents and institutions in the city. For example, the [[tailgate party|tailgate]] area for football games at [[Florida Atlantic University]] is known as the &quot;Rat's Mouth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rat's Mouth Tailgate Procedures |url=http://www.fau.edu/campuslife/tailgate.php |website=Florida Atlantic University Homepage |access-date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Boca&quot;, meaning ''mouth'' in Spanish, was a common term to describe an [[inlet]] on maps by sailors. The true meaning of the word &quot;ratones&quot; for the area is more uncertain. Some claim that the word &quot;ratones&quot; appears in old Spanish maritime dictionaries referring to &quot;rugged rocks or stony ground on the bottom of some ports and coastal outlets, where the cables rub against.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The Spanish Maritime Dictionary of 1831&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, one possible translation of &quot;Boca Raton&quot; is &quot;rugged inlet&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Ruiz | first1 = Humberto E. | last2 = Cobia | first2 = Manley F.| title = Boca de Ratones: An Etymological Reassessment| url =http://www.bocahistory.org/eGallery/upload/Boca%20Raton%20Historical%20Society/Boca%20Raton%20Historical%20Society/Files/bocaderatones_origin.pdf| access-date = March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still other people claim that &quot;ratones&quot; referred to pirates who hid out in the area, and thus the name could translate to &quot;pirates' inlet&quot;, which would illustrate why there is a pirate ship in the city seal.

===Pronunciation===
Residents of the city have kept the pronunciation of Boca Raton similar to its Spanish origins{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}. In particular, the &quot;Raton&quot; in &quot;Boca Raton&quot; is pronounced as {{IPAc-en||r|ə|ˈ|t|oʊ|n}} instead of {{IPAc-en|r|ə|ˈ|t|ɒ|n}}. The latter is a common mispronunciation by non-natives to the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Fla-mayor-irked-by-poor-pronunciations/71371352151257/|title=Fla. mayor irked by poor pronunciations|work=UPI|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
[[File:North Boca Raton Florida Aerial photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|left|North Boca Raton, Florida]]
[[File:West Boca photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|left|West Boca Raton, Florida]]
The area where Boca Raton is now located was originally occupied by the [[Glades culture]], a Native American tribe of hunter/gatherers who relocated seasonally and between shellfish sources, distinct from the [[Tequesta]] to the south and the [[Jaega]] to the north, a people that occupied an area along the southeastern [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic coast]] of Florida.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pelish2018&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What Spanish voyagers called &quot;Boca de Ratones&quot; was originally to the south, in present-day [[Biscayne Bay]] in [[Miami-Dade County]]. The area of Boca Raton was labeled &quot;Rio Seco&quot;, meaning &quot;Dry River&quot;, during this time. By mistake during the 19th century, mapmakers moved this location to the north and began referring to the city's lake, today known as Lake Boca Raton, as &quot;Boca Ratone Lagoon&quot; and later &quot;Boca Ratone Sounde.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GillisSociety2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Susan Gillis|author2=Boca Raton Historical Society|title=Boomtime Boca: Boca Raton in the 1920s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8METlWXqqLMC&amp;pg=PA7|year=2007|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-4443-4|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An inland stream near the lake was later renamed [[Spanish River (Florida)|Spanish River]], and eventually became part of the [[Intracoastal Waterway]].

When Spain surrendered Florida to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1763, the remaining Tequestas, along with other Indians that had taken refuge in the Florida Keys, were evacuated to [[Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/ever/historyculture/nativepeoples.htm &quot;Native Peoples&quot;], National Park System, United States Department of the Interior&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1770s, [[Bernard Romans]] reported seeing abandoned villages in the area, but no inhabitants.

The area remained largely uninhabited for long afterwards, during the early years of Florida's incorporation in the United States. The first significant European settler to this area was Captain Thomas Moore Rickards in 1895, who resided in a house made of driftwood on the east side of the East Coast Canal, south of what is now the Palmetto Park Road bridge. He surveyed and sold land from the canal to beyond the railroad north of what is now Palmetto Park Road.&lt;ref&gt;Boca Raton Historical Society, [http://www.bocahistory.org/pdf/span_river/SRP%20Jan%201973.pdf ''Spanish River Papers''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725085634/http://www.bocahistory.org/pdf/span_river/SRP%20Jan%201973.pdf |date=July 25, 2011 }}, 1.1 (January 1973){{failed verification|date=January 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Early settlement in the area increased shortly after [[Henry Flagler]]'s expansion of the [[Florida East Coast Railway]], connecting [[West Palm Beach]] to Miami.

===Addison Mizner's resort town===
{{main|Addison Mizner}}
Boca Raton as a city was the creation of architect [[Addison Mizner]]. Prior to him, Boca Raton was an unincorporated farming town with a population of 100 in 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boomtime&quot;&gt;{{cite book

|author=Mizner Development Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} &quot;a new exclusive social capital in America.&quot;&lt;ref name=Mizner /&gt;{{rp|9}} After spending several years in Palm Beach, where, in his own words, he &quot;did more than any one man to make the city beautiful,&quot;&lt;ref name=Mizner /&gt;{{rp|5}} and designed the [[Everglades Club]] among many other buildings, in Boca Raton his plan was to create from scratch &quot;a resort as splendid in its entirety as Palm Beach is in spots.&quot;&lt;ref name=Mizner /&gt;{{rp|6}}

Activity in that area began at least a year, and probably more, before Mizner's announcement. Land acquisition, tens of thousands of acres, was the largest part. But it is hard not to see Mizner's hand in the incorporation of Boca Raton in 1924; the city immediately appointed him Town Planner.&lt;ref name=brhs /&gt;&lt;ref name=Boomtime /&gt;{{rp|102}} The Mizner Development Company was incorporated in 1925, and promptly issued $5 million of stock, which was fully subscribed in less than a week.&lt;ref name=Curl /&gt;{{rp|140}} $500,000 was reserved for the &quot;average Floridian&quot;; the remainder was purchased by, as Addison called them, &quot;noted personages&quot;, all with a Palm Beach connection: Lytle Hall, [[Harold Vanderbilt]], J. Leonard Repogle, the [[Eileen Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Duchess of Sutherland|Duchess of Sutherland]], [[Rodman Wanamaker]], [[Paris Singer]], [[Irving Berlin]], Madame [[Frances Alda]], [[W. C. Robinson]], H. H. Rodgers, D. H. Conkling, A. T. Herd, Porte, [[William Kissam Vanderbilt II]], [[Elizabeth Arden]], [[Jesse Livermore]], [[Clarence H. Geist]], and [[T. Coleman du Pont]] as chairman.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of the existing Palmetto Park Road, the main street in Mizner's Boca was to be El Camino Real, 20 lanes wide, which Mizner fancifully translated as &quot;The Royal Highway&quot;,&lt;ref name=Boomtime /&gt;{{rp|39}} referring to Spain's road network and to the road to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] and to the [[El Camino Real (California)|Spanish missions in California]]. (Spanish kings rarely or never travelled on these roads; &quot;The Government Road&quot; would be just as accurate.) It was originally to be circular, with a lagoon in the middle.&lt;ref name=Boomtime /&gt;{{rp|44}} Soon it became, in the plans, Boca Raton's main east-west street, to be {{convert|220|ft|m}} wide and with a canal for pleasure boats in the center. (In the drawing of it on the cover of Mizner Development's first brochure is a Venetian [[gondola]].&lt;ref name=Mizner /&gt;) His statement that it was inspired by [[Botafogo]], a neighborhood and beach in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, is another of his many inventions of foreign &quot;facts&quot;.&lt;ref name=Curl&gt;{{cite book

(The only street in Rio de Janeiro anything like the supposed picture, actually an artist's conception, of &quot;Botafogo&quot; that Mizner included in his first catalogue,&lt;ref name=Mizner /&gt;{{rp|11}} is the [[:pt:Canal do Mangue]], which runs down the middle of two streets, but is nowhere near Botafogo, a more elegant name than Mangue &quot;[[mangrove]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Only {{convert|0.5|miles|km}} of the road was built (although the street has subsequently been extended to the west at normal scale). According to drawings, the centerpiece of the street was to be a canal for pleasure boats; it was never built.&lt;ref&gt;Seebohm 2001. pp. 216-217.&lt;/ref&gt; All streets were to be at least {{convert|60|feet|m}} wide.&lt;ref name=Boomtime /&gt;{{rp|43}}

His first buildings in Boca Raton were his Administrative Buildings, on El Camino Real (in 2018 the [https://web.archive.org/web/20171231212041/https://theaddisonofbocaraton.com/the-addison-overview/ Addison Restaurant]), and a small hotel to house interested investors.&lt;ref name=&quot;GillisSociety2007&quot; /&gt; Mizner designed Boca's first town hall/police station/fire station/library, although the design actually built is much smaller and less expensive than what Mizner planned. Today (2018) it is the [[Boca Raton History Museum]], which houses Boca's Welcome Center and the Boca Raton Historical Society.

The hotel was his [[Ritz-Carlton]] Cloister Inn, built in 1926,&lt;ref&gt;Curl, Donald W. and John P. Johnson. ''Boca Raton; A Pictorial History''. Virginia Beach, VA: The Donning Company, 1990. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; later renamed the [[Boca Raton Resort &amp; Club]], and is one of the only &quot;5 star&quot; hotels in Florida. The 1969 addition of its &quot;pink tower&quot; hotel building is visible from miles away as a towering monument on the [[Intracoastal Waterway]].

Because of the end of the [[Florida land boom of the 1920s]] and the [[1926 Miami hurricane]], the Mizner Development Corporation went into bankruptcy in 1927. Little of Mizner's Boca Raton was ever built: his [[Administration Buildings (Boca Raton, Florida)|Administration Buildings]], the Cloister Inn, 1/2 mile of El Camino Real, the small Dunagan Apartments (demolished),&lt;ref name=Boomtime /&gt; a few houses near the Cloister Inn (demolished), the Spanish Village neighborhood,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===World War II Army Air Force Base===
During [[World War II]], some of the land used by the Japanese farmers of the [[Yamato Colony, Florida|Yamato Colony]] was confiscated and used as the site of the Boca Raton Army Air Force Base, a major training facility for [[B-29]] bomber crews and the only facility in the U.S. training [[radar]] operators. Much of the [[Boca Raton Army Airfield]] was later donated to Palm Beach County and became the grounds of [[Florida Atlantic University]]. Many of FAU's parking lots are former runways of the airbase. When viewed from above, the site's layout for its previous use as an airfield is plainly evident. [[Boca Raton Airport]]'s runway was once part of the original airbase, and is still active to this day, although the runway has been rebuilt. Army School Building #3 (T-604) of the Army Air Forces Base has survived as the office building for the Cynthia Gardens apartment complex on Northwest 4th Avenue.

===Post-World War II history===
Boca Raton was the site of two now vanished [[amusement park]]s, Africa U.S.A. (1953–61) and Ancient America (1953–59).

====IBM====
In the late 1960s, [[IBM]] announced their intentions to open a manufacturing plant in the area. In 1965, well before the extension of [[Interstate 95 in Florida|I-95]] into Southern Florida, IBM, working in secret with the Arvida corporation, quietly purchased several hundred acres of real estate west of the [[CSX]] rail line and northwest of [[Florida Atlantic University]]. Originally situated in unincorporated Palm Beach County, the site was annexed into Boca Raton almost a year following its dedication in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Janie Gold, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DYAyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PLcFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5266,4338414&amp;dq=university+park+boca+raton&amp;hl=en &quot;Archer calls on Boca Raton to de-annex University Park&quot;], ''The Palm Beach Post'', July 12, 1972, C1&amp;ndash;C2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:T-Rex Technology Center Fountain (cropped).JPG|thumb|right|The Boca Corporate Center &amp; Campus was originally one of IBM's research labs where the IBM PC was created.]]
Construction of IBM's main complex began in 1967, designed by [[Marcel Breuer]],&lt;ref name=&quot;porter198311&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q8fwTt09_MEC&amp;q=pc%20magazine%20%22november%201983%22&amp;pg=RA1-PA162 | title=The Talk of Boca | work=PC Magazine | date=November 1983 | access-date=October 22, 2013 | author=Porter, Martin | page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the manufacturing and office complex was dedicated in March 1970. The campus was designed with self-sufficiency in mind and sported its own [[electrical substation]], [[water pumping]] station, and rail spur.

By 1984 IBM was Palm Beach County's largest corporate employer, with 8,500 Boca Raton employees.&lt;ref name=&quot;bulman19841105&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.newspapers.com/clip/31277231/fort_lauderdale_news/ |title=Big time: IBM skillfully revives lackluster sales of PCjr |last=Bulman |first=Philip |date=1984-11-05 |work=Fort Lauderdale News |access-date=2019-05-05 |page=47 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other noteworthy IT accomplishments, such as the mass production of the [[System/360]] and development of the [[IBM Series/1|Series/1]] mainframe computers, IBM's main complex was the birthplace of the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]], which later evolved into the IBM [[Personal System/2]], developed in nearby [[Delray Beach, Florida|Delray Beach]]. Starting in 1987, IBM relocated its manufacturing for what became the IBM PC division to [[Research Triangle Park]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], and converted the cavernous manufacturing facilities into offices and laboratories, later producing products such as the [[OS/2]] operating system and VoiceType Dictation, later known as [[ViaVoice]] voice-recognition [[software]].

IBM maintained its facilities in the South Florida area until 1996, when the facility was closed and sold to Blue Lake Real Estate. The site was sold to T-REX Management Consortium, then to the Blackstone Group in 2005, who renamed it the Boca Corporate Center and Campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.palmbeachpost.com/business/new-owner-gives-new-life-former-home-ibm-boca/VWruh7ueJs3zCOZnMj1x9N/|title=New owner gives new life to former home of IBM in Boca|last=Clough|first=Alexandra|date=September 23, 2016|work=The Palm Beach Post|access-date=February 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The site was later renamed the Boca Raton Innovation Campus (BRiC). Crocker Partners, noted for its development of [[Mizner Park]] and [[Office Depot|Office Depot headquarters]], purchased BRiC in April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.palmbeachpost.com/business/crocker-partners-pays-170-million-for-former-ibm-campus-boca-raton/EWx4oSnnrz68i7LopGhuUO/|title=Crocker Partners pays $170 million for former IBM campus in Boca Raton|last=Clough|first=Alexandra|date=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What used to be IBM's Building 051, an annex separated from the former main IBM campus by Spanish River Boulevard, was donated to the Palm Beach County School District and converted into [[Don Estridge High Tech Middle School]]. It is named after [[Don Estridge]], whose team was responsible for developing the [[IBM PC]]. IBM returned in July 2001, opening the software development laboratory at Beacon Square off Congress Avenue.

It is noteworthy that still left standing inside the old IBM complex is the office and conference table where [[Bill Gates]] signed his historic deal to supply IBM with the [[Microsoft]] [[MS-DOS]] operating system for its personal computer line.

====Suburban expansion====
In the 1980s, because of an explosion of development to the west of the historical center of the city, some eastern areas began to decay, including the downtown corridor. For instance, the old Boca Raton Mall, a [[shopping mall]] in the downtown area, was beginning to experience higher vacancy, and occupancy by marginal tenants, owing to the opening of [[Town Center at Boca Raton]] west of the city in 1980.
[[File:Palmetto Park Rd and Mizner Blvd 2.jpg|thumb|right|Palmetto Park Road and Mizner Boulevard intersection.]]

In 1991, the new downtown outdoor shopping and dining center, [[Mizner Park]], was completed over the site of the old Boca Raton Mall. It has since become a cultural center for southern Palm Beach County. Featuring a landscaped central park between the two main roads (collectively called Plaza Real) with stores only on the outside of the roads, Mizner Park resembles a Mediterranean suburban &quot;town center&quot; with a more contemporary look. It features many restaurants and is home to the [[Boca Raton Museum of Art]], which moved to the new facility in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Boca Raton Museum of Art | url=http://www.bocamuseum.org/index.php?submenu=about_us&amp;src=gendocs&amp;link=AboutUs&amp;category=About%20Us }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, a new [[amphitheater]] was built, replacing a smaller one and providing a large-capacity outdoor venue where concerts and other performances are held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miznerparkamp.com/ |title=miznerparkamp.com |access-date=June 30, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801203604/http://miznerparkamp.com/ |archive-date=August 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mizner Park Cultural Center, an indoor performing arts/comedy show theater is located to the southwest of the amphitheater within the Mizner Park property.

Mizner Park has significantly aided downtown revitalization. Many new eight- to ten-story mixed-use buildings have been constructed, are under construction, or are proposed for the downtown area. The surrounding areas to the downtown have benefited from the downtown redevelopment. What used to be small office areas built next to a compact restaurant/shopping location, has become a mixed-used shopping, restaurant, spa, and upscale apartments district called Royal Palm Place, built next to Mizner Park.

The [[National Cartoon Museum]] built a {{convert|25000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility on the southwest edge of Mizner Park in 1996. Open for six years, the museum relocated to its original home in [[New York City]] in 2002. Building renovations for public uses, including the local public TV station, and private uses, such as a locally owned and operated bookstore, were completed in 2008. In addition to the Mizner Park Cultural Arts Association's theater and space, the building is home to the Schmidt Family Foundation.

As development continued to focus to the west of the city in the 1980s and 1990s, the mall area known as [[Town Center at Boca Raton]] became the geographic center of what is referred to as West Boca Raton, though this mall was not annexed into the city until 2004. This area, including the unincorporated area west of the city (discussed below), is now almost entirely built out.

Today, Boca Raton is said to be the Beverly Hills of Florida with well-developed beach resorts, luxury country clubs, and five-star shopping and restaurants. Forbes ranked Boca's Royal Palm Yacht and Country Club the third most exclusive gated communities in the US in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/ejef45eeed/royal-palm-yacht-and-country-club-boca-raton-florida/#52a12401537f |title=Forbes List: Most Exclusive Gated Communities in the US |access-date=September 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many mansions and estates have been built and reflect the high real estate values. 18.1% of homes for sale are within the $655,000-$966,000 range, 8.5% in the $966,000-$1.288 million range, and 11.9% in the $1.288 million plus range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/fl/boca-raton/real-estate |title=Neighborhood Scout: Boca Raton Real Estate |access-date=September 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-2010s, there has been a developing boom such as the building of the Mandarin Oriental's Residences, remodeling of Downtown Boca Raton's Mizner Park, and development around Florida Atlantic University and Lynn University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenparis/2018/11/20/luxury-development-in-boca-raton-is-booming/#252928fd5eac |title=Luxury Development In Boca Raton is Booming |access-date=September 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fortlauderdaledaily.com/features/look-boca-ratons-booming-downtown-and-what-future-has-store |title=Boca Raton's Booming Downtown and What the Future Has in Store |access-date=September 17, 2019 }}{{Dead link|date=May 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, around 60,000 New Yorkers migrated to Florida which was the largest state-to-state migration that year and the rate of in-state migration has stayed at around the same level since then. Boca Raton is famous for being a Jewish retirement city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/251284/going-south-for-the-winter |title=How Florida Became Home to Jewish Snowbirds |access-date=September 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greater Boca Raton==
{{Main|West Boca Raton}}

A majority of postal Boca Raton lies outside of the actual city limits. This large unincorporated area to the west of the city limits is included in the Boca Raton mailing address and local telephone calling area. There are many large [[Planned Unit Development|planned developments]] in the area, including [[Gated community|gated communities]], and a number of [[golf course]]s. This is a result in the later start of development in these areas, and the availability of large tracts of land. Many of these communities are large enough to be designated as [[census-designated place]]s, including [[Boca Del Mar, Florida|Boca Del Mar]] and [[Boca Pointe, Florida|Boca Pointe]], geographically in ''Central Boca Raton'', with Avalon at Boca Raton, Boca Falls, Boca Lago, Boca Winds, [[Cimarron, Florida|Cimarron]], [[Hamptons at Boca Raton, Florida|Hamptons at Boca Raton]], [[Mission Bay, Florida|Mission Bay]], [[Loggers' Run, Florida|Loggers' Run]], The Polo Club Boca Raton and Polo Club Movers, [[Sandalfoot Cove, Florida|Sandalfoot Cove]], and [[Whisper Walk, Florida|Whisper Walk]] as ''West Boca Raton''.

On November 2, 2004, the voters of the Via Verde Association, Waterside, Deerhurst Association (Boca South), Marina Del Mar Association, Rio Del Mar Association (both originally Boca Del Mar communities), and Heatherwood of Boca Raton Condominium Association approved [[annexation]] into the Boca Raton [[city limits]], increasing the city land area to {{convert|29.6|sqmi|km2}}. A new gated community called Royal Palm Polo was annexed to the City of Boca Raton, which is the only jurisdiction north of Clint Moore Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=MyBoca.US Official Map|url=https://www.myboca.us/DocumentCenter/View/8271/Zoning-Map-PDF?bidId=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200615094108/https://www.myboca.us/DocumentCenter/View/8271/Zoning-Map-PDF?bidId=|archive-date=June 15, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pearl City (Boca Raton)|Pearl City]] is a neighborhood in Boca Raton, immediately north of downtown. The neighborhood was originally platted on May 30, 1915 for the [[blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] [[African American]]s employed at the [[Boca Raton Resort]] and similar establishments, on area farms, in construction, and various other jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Evans and Lee, (1990).

As of February 2013, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]s [[Lois Frankel]] and [[Ted Deutch]] both represent parts of the city in the [[United States Congress]].

In the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 general elections]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Donald Trump]] won in Boca Raton by a majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bocaratontribune.com/bocaratonnews/2017/01/how-florida-palm-beach-county-and-the-city-of-boca-raton-voted-for-president/|title=How Florida, Palm Beach County, and the City of Boca Raton Voted for President|website=www.bocaratontribune.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 27, 2018, Governor Rick Scott suspended Susan Haynie due to her felony and misdemeanor charges. Scott Singer was appointed mayor and held that position on that basis until the August 28th special election; Singer was elected outright as mayor in that election.

==Geography==
[[File:BocaRatonFromTheISS.jpg|thumb|right|Boca Raton, seen from the [[International Space Station]].]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has an area of {{convert|75.4|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|70.4|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}} of this is land and {{convert|5.0|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}} of it (6.63%) is water. Boca Raton is a &quot;[[principal city]]&quot; (as defined by the Census Bureau) of the [[Miami metropolitan area]]. Approximately 1 square mile is on the barrier island [[Deerfield Beach Island]] ([http://dbi.rocks/ DBI]), also colloquially known as [[Deerfield Cay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Buddy Sparrow|title=WELCOME TO DEERFIELD CAY, A BEAUTIFUL ISLAND IN SOUTH FLORIDA !|date=October 17, 2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtkQCWm1rE8|access-date=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other [[South Florida]] cities, Boca Raton has a [[water table]] that does not permit building basements, however plumbing and sewage is constructed underneath the homes and streets, in addition to electrical systems in some areas. There are several high points in the city, such as 4th Avenue which is aptly named &quot;High Street.&quot; The highest point in this area is the guard shack at Camino Gardens, which is {{convert|24|ft|m|abbr=on}} above sea level. The Boca Raton Hotel's Beach Club rests at {{convert|23|ft|m|abbr=on}} above sea level.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth.google.com/|title=Google Earth|access-date=June 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several small tunnels run under roads in Boca, but the roads are built up several feet at these locations, or are on dunes. Several of these tunnels are under [[A1A|State Road A1A]] at Spanish River Park, from the west side of the road where parking is available to beachgoers, to the east side of the road, which is where the beach is located. A1A is already higher than the surrounding land here due to sand dunes formed by erosion and other natural features.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

===Climate===
Boca Raton has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Af''), as its driest month (December) averages 62.5mm of precipitation, narrowly meeting the minimum standard of 60mm in the driest month to qualify for that designation. In general the climate is warm and sunny much of the year, although daily thundershowers occur in the hot season from June through September. Boca Raton is frost free. The warm tropical climate supports the growth of tropical trees and plants.

Winter high temperatures are typically in the 75-83 degrees range, while summer high temperatures are about 87-93 degrees.

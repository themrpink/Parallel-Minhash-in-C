He regarded Jainism as &quot;a most dreadful religion&quot;, writing that Jains were intolerant and hostile towards the non-Jains.&lt;ref name=Panicker/&gt;

===Buddhism===
{{see also|Criticism of Buddhism}}

Dayananda described Buddhism as ridiculous and &quot;atheistic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jose Kuruvachira|title=Hindu Nationalists of Modern India: A Critical Study of the Intellectual Genealogy of Hindutva|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O2XXAAAAMAAJ|year=2006|publisher=Rawat Publications|isbn=978-81-7033-995-3|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes the type of &quot;salvation&quot; Buddhism as being attainable even to dogs and donkeys. He further criticized the Cosmogony of Buddhism, stating that the earth was not created.

==Assassination attempts==

Dayananda was subjected to many unsuccessful attempts on his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;The World p. 123&quot;/&gt;

According to his supporters, he was poisoned on a few occasions, but due to his regular practice of [[Hatha Yoga]] he survived all such attempts. One story tells that attackers once attempted to drown him in a river, but Dayananda dragged the assailants into the river instead, though he released them before they drowned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bhavana Nair|title=Our Leaders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b2uBqRoRyqQC|year=1989|publisher=Children's Book Trust|isbn=978-81-7011-678-3|volume=4|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another account claims that he was attacked by Muslims who were offended by his criticism of Islam while meditating on the Ganges river. They threw him into the water but he is claimed to have saved himself because his [[pranayama]] practice allowed him to stay under water until the attackers left.&lt;ref&gt;Vandematharam Veerabhadra Rao (1987) ''Life Sketch of Swami Dayananda'', Delhi. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assassination ==

In 1883, the [[Maharaja]] of [[Jodhpur State|Jodhpur]], [[Jaswant Singh II]], invited Dayananda to stay at his palace. The Maharaja was eager to become Dayananda's disciple, and to learn his teachings. During his stay, Dayananda went to the Maharaja's rest room and saw him with a dancing girl named Nanhi Jaan. Dayananda asked the Maharaja to forsake the girl and all unethical acts, and to follow the [[dharma]] like a true Arya (noble). Dayananda's suggestion offended Nanhi, who decided to take revenge.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Krant (2006) ''Swadhinta Sangram Ke Krantikari Sahitya Ka Itihas''. Delhi: Pravina Prakasana . Vol. 2, p. 347. {{ISBN|81-7783-122-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 September 1883, she bribed Dayananda's cook, Jagannath, to mix small pieces of glass in his nightly milk.&lt;ref name=&quot;rg&quot; /&gt; Dayananda was served glass-laden milk before bed, which he promptly drank, becoming bedridden for several days, and suffering excruciating pain. The Maharaja quickly arranged doctor's services for him. However, by the time doctors arrived, his condition had worsened, and he had developed large, bleeding sores. Upon seeing Dayananda's suffering, Jagannath was overwhelmed with guilt and confessed his crime to Dayananda. On his deathbed, Dayananda forgave him, and gave him a bag of money, telling him to flee the kingdom before he was found and executed by the Maharaja's men.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

Later, Maharaja arranged for him to be sent to [[Mount Abu]] as per the advice of Residency, however, after staying for some time in Abu, on 26 October 1883, he was sent to [[Ajmer]] for better medical care.&lt;ref name=&quot;rg&quot; /&gt; There was no improvement in his health and he died on the morning of Hindu festival of [[Divali]] on 30 October 1883 chanting [[mantra]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;rg&quot;&gt;[[#Garg|Garg]], pp. 96–98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hin1&gt;[https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/gk-current-affairs/story/arya-samaj-swami-dayanand-saraswati-modern-india-1378699-2018-10-30 Arya Samaj founder Swami Dayanand Saraswati's idea of a modern India], India Today, 2018-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was guided by reason, taking Hinduism back to the Vedic foundations. He had tried to reform society with a clean sweep, which was again need today. Some of the reforms introduced in the Indian Constitution had been inspired by his teachings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Garg|Garg]], p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Swami Vivekananda'''  ({{IPA-bn|ʃami bibekanɔndo|lang|Swami_Vivekananda.ogg}}; 12 January 1863 – 4 July 1902), born '''Narendranath Datta''' ({{IPA-bn|nɔrendronatʰ dɔto|lang}}), was an Indian Hindu monk. He was a chief disciple of the 19th-century Indian mystic [[Ramakrishna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oneindia.com/feature/swami-vivekananda-a-short-biography-1980622.html|title=Swami Vivekananda: A short biography|work=www.oneindia.com|access-date=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.culturalindia.net/reformers/vivekananda.html|title=Life History &amp; Teachings of Swami Vivekanand|access-date=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a key figure in the introduction of the Indian philosophies of [[Vedanta]] and [[Yoga]] to the Western world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/research/international-yoga-day-2017-how-swami-vivekananda-helped-popularise-the-ancient-indian-regimen-in-the-west-4715411/|title=International Yoga Day: How Swami Vivekananda helped popularise the ancient Indian regimen in the West|date=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Feuerstein|2002|p=600}} and is credited with raising [[Interfaith dialogue|interfaith]] awareness, bringing [[Hinduism]] to the status of a major world religion during the late 19th century.{{Sfn|Clarke|2006|p=209}} He was a major force in the [[Hindu reform movements|revival of Hinduism]] in India, and contributed to the concept of [[Indian nationalism]] as a tool to fight against the [[British Empire|British empire]] in [[colonial India]].{{Sfn|Von Dense|1999|p=191}} Vivekananda founded the [[Ramakrishna Math]] and the [[Ramakrishna Mission]].{{sfn|Feuerstein|2002|p=600}} He is perhaps best known for his speech which began with the words &quot;Sisters and brothers of America&amp;nbsp;...,&quot;{{Sfn|Dutt|2005|p=121}} in which he introduced Hinduism at the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] in [[Chicago]] in 1893.

Born into an aristocratic [[Bengali Kayastha]] family of Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined towards spirituality. He was influenced by his guru, Ramakrishna, from whom he learnt that all living beings were an embodiment of the divine self; therefore, service to God could be rendered by service to humankind. After Ramakrishna's death, Vivekananda toured the [[Indian subcontinent]] extensively and acquired first-hand knowledge of the prevailing in [[British India]]. He later travelled to the [[United States]], representing India at the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions. Vivekananda conducted hundreds of public and private lectures and classes, disseminating tenets of [[Hindu philosophy]] in the United States, [[England]] and [[Europe]]. In India, Vivekananda is regarded as a [[List of Hindu gurus and saints|patriotic saint]], and his birthday is celebrated as [[National Youth Day (India)|National Youth Day]].

Vivekananda was born Narendranath Datta (shortened to Narendra or Naren){{Sfn|Paul|2003|p=5}} in a [[Bengalis|Bengali]] family{{sfn|Banhatti|1995|p=1}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SKKDBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA236|title=Rescued from the Nation: Anagarika Dharmapala and the Buddhist World|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2015|page=236|author=Steven Kemper|isbn=9780226199108}}&lt;/ref&gt; at his ancestral home at [[Ramakrishna Mission Swami Vivekananda's Ancestral House and Cultural Centre|3 Gourmohan Mukherjee Street]] in [[Calcutta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mid-day.com/articles/devdutt-pattanaik-dayanand--vivekanand/17911158|title=Devdutt Pattanaik: Dayanand &amp; Vivekanand|date=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the capital of British India, on 12 January 1863 during the [[Makar Sankranti]] festival.{{Sfn|Badrinath|2006|p=2}} He belonged to a traditional family and was one of nine siblings.{{Sfn|Mukherji|2011|p=5}} His father, [[Vishwanath Datta]], was an attorney at the [[Calcutta High Court]].{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|p=1}}{{Sfn|Badrinath|2006|p=3}} Durgacharan Datta, Narendra's grandfather was a [[Sanskrit]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] scholar{{Sfn|Bhuyan|2003|p=4}} who left his family and became a monk at age twenty-five.{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|p=2}} His mother, Bhubaneswari Devi, was a devout housewife.{{Sfn|Bhuyan|2003|p=4}} The progressive, rational attitude of Narendra's father and the religious temperament of his mother helped shape his thinking and personality.{{Sfn|Nikhilananda|1964}}{{Sfn|Sen|2003|p=20}}

Narendranath was interested in spirituality from a young age and used to meditate before the images of deities such as [[Shiva]], [[Rama]], [[Sita]], and [[Hanuman|Mahavir Hanuman]].{{Sfn|Bhuyan|2003|p=5}} He was fascinated by wandering ascetics and monks.{{Sfn|Sen|2003|p=20}} Naren was naughty and restless as a child, and his parents often had difficulty controlling him. His mother said, &quot;I prayed to Shiva for a son and he has sent me one of his demons&quot;.{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|p=2}}

==Education {{anchor|Early and college education}}==
In 1871, at the age of eight, Narendranath enrolled at [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]]'s [[Vidyasagar College|Metropolitan Institution]], where he went to school until his family moved to [[Raipur]] in 1877.{{sfn|Banhatti|1995|p={{pn|date=August 2020}}}} In 1879, after his family's return to Calcutta, he was the only student to receive first-division marks in the [[Presidency University, Kolkata|Presidency College]] entrance examination. {{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|p=4}} He was an avid reader in a wide range of subjects, including [[philosophy]], [[religion]], [[history]], [[social science]], art and [[literature]].{{Sfn|Arrington|Chakrabarti|2001|pp=628–631}} He was also interested in Hindu [[scriptures]], including the [[Vedas]], the [[Upanishads]], the [[Bhagavad Gita]], the ''[[Ramayana]]'', the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and the [[Puranas]]. Narendra was trained in [[Indian classical music]],{{Sfn|Sen|2003|p=21}} and regularly participated in physical exercise, sports and organised activities. Narendra studied Western logic, [[Western philosophy]] and European history at the [[Scottish Church College, Calcutta|General Assembly's Institution]] (now known as the Scottish Church College).{{Sfn| Sen|2006|pp=12–14}} In 1881, he passed the [[Fine art|Fine Arts]] examination, and completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1884.{{Sfn|Sen|2003|pp=104–105}}{{Sfn|Pangborn|Smith|1976|p=106}} Narendra studied the works of [[David Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Georg W. F. Hegel]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Auguste Comte]], [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Charles Darwin]].{{Sfn|Dhar|1976|p=53}}{{Sfn|Malagi|Naik|2003|pp=36–37}} He became fascinated with the [[evolutionism]] of [[Herbert Spencer]] and corresponded with him,{{Sfn|Prabhananda|2003|p=233}}{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|pp=7–9}} translating [[Herbert Spencer|Herbert Herbert Spencer]]'s book ''Education'' (1861) into Bengali.{{Sfn|Chattopadhyaya|1999|p=31}} While studying Western philosophers, he also learned Sanskrit scriptures and [[Bengali literature]].{{Sfn|Malagi|Naik|2003|pp=36–37}}

[[William Hastie]] (principal of Christian College, Calcutta, from where Narendra graduated) wrote, &quot;Narendra is really a genius. I have travelled far and wide but I have never come across a lad of his talents and possibilities, even in German universities, among philosophical students. He is bound to make his mark in life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Concise Encyclopaedia of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9dNOT9iYxcMC&amp;pg=PA1066|page=1066|editor1=K.R.Gupta|editor2=Amita Gupta|publisher=Atlantic|year=2006|isbn = 9788126906390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narendra was known for his prodigious memory and the ability at [[speed reading]]. Several incidents have been given as examples. In a talk, he once quoted verbatim, two or three pages from [[Pickwick Papers]]. Another incident that is given is his argument with a Swedish national where he gave reference to some details on Swedish history that the Swede originally disagreed with but later conceded. In another incident with Dr. [[Paul Deussen]]'s at [[Kiel]] in Germany, Vivekananda was going over some poetical work and did not reply when the professor spoke to him. Later, he apologised to Dr. Deussen explaining that he was too absorbed in reading and hence did not hear him. The professor was not satisfied with this explanation but Vivekananda quoted and interpreted verses from the text leaving the professor dumbfounded about his feat of memory. Once, he requested some books written by Sir John Lubbock from a library and returned them the very next day claiming that he had read them. The librarian refused to believe him until cross examination about the contents convinced him that Vivekananda was being truthful.{{sfn|Banhatti|1995 |pp=156, 157}}

Some accounts have called Narendra a ''shrutidhara'' (a person with a prodigious memory).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.indiatoday.in/fyi/story/swami-vivekanandas-114th-death-anniversary-lesser-known-facts-about-this-monk-327208-2016-07-04 Swami Vivekananda's 114th death anniversary: Lesser known facts about the spiritual leader].

===Spiritual apprenticeship – influence of Brahmo Samaj===
{{See also|Swami Vivekananda and meditation}}

In 1880 Narendra joined [[Keshab Chandra Sen]]'s ''[[Nava Vidhan]]'', which was established by Sen after meeting [[Ramakrishna]] and reconverting from [[Christianity]] to Hinduism.{{sfn|De Michelis|2005|p=99}} Narendra became a member of a [[Freemasonry]] lodge &quot;at some point before 1884&quot;{{sfn|De Michelis|2005|p=100}} and of the [[Sadharan Brahmo Samaj]] in his twenties, a breakaway faction of the [[Brahmo Samaj]] led by [[Keshab Chandra Sen]] and [[Debendranath Tagore]].{{sfn|De Michelis|2005|p=99}}{{sfn| Sen|2006|pp=12–14}}{{sfn|Banhatti|1995|p=8}}{{sfn|Badrinath|2006|p=20}} From 1881 to 1884, he was also active in Sen's [[Band of Hope]], which tried to discourage youths from smoking and drinking.{{sfn|De Michelis|2005|p=99}}

It was in this [[cult]]ic{{sfn|De Michelis|2005|p=31-35}} milieu that Narendra became acquainted with Western [[esotericism]].{{sfn|De Michelis|2005|p=19-90, 97–100}} His initial beliefs were shaped by Brahmo concepts, which included belief in a formless God and the deprecation of [[idolatry]],{{Sfn|Bhuyan|2003|p=5}}{{Sfn|Chattopadhyaya|1999|p=29}} and a &quot;streamlined, rationalized, monotheistic theology strongly coloured by a selective and modernistic reading of the ''Upanisads'' and of the Vedanta.&quot;{{sfn|De Michelis|2005|p=46}} [[Rammohan Roy]], the founder of the Brahmo Samaj who was strongly influenced by [[unitarianism]], strove towards a [[Universalism|universalistic]] interpretation of Hinduism.{{sfn|De Michelis|2005|p=46}} His ideas were &quot;altered [...] considerably&quot; by [[Debendranath Tagore]], who had a [[romanticism|romantic]] approach to the development of these new doctrines, and questioned central Hindu beliefs like reincarnation and karma, and rejected the authority of the ''Vedas''.{{sfn|De Michelis|2005|p=46-47}} Tagore also brought this &quot;neo-Hinduism&quot; closer in line with western [[esotericism]], a development which was furthered by Sen.{{sfn|De Michelis|2005|p=47}} Sen was influenced by [[transcendentalism]], an American philosophical-religious movement strongly connected with unitarianism, which emphasised personal [[religious experience]] over mere reasoning and [[theology]].{{sfn|De Michelis|2005|p=81}} Sen strived to &quot;an accessible, non-renunciatory, everyman type of spirituality&quot;, introducing &quot;lay systems of spiritual practice&quot; which can be regarded as prototypes of the kind of [[Yoga]]-exercises which Vivekananda popularised in the west.{{sfn|De Michelis|2005|p=49}}

The same search for direct intuition and understanding can be seen with Vivekananda. Not satisfied with his knowledge of philosophy, Narendra came to &quot;the question which marked the real beginning of his intellectual quest for God.&quot;{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|p=8}} He asked several prominent Calcutta residents if they had come &quot;face to face with God&quot;, but none of their answers satisfied him.{{sfn|Sen|2006|pp=12–13}}{{sfn|Pangborn|Smith|1976|p=106}} At this time, Narendra met Debendranath Tagore (the leader of Brahmo Samaj) and asked if he had seen God. Instead of answering his question, Tagore said &quot;My boy, you have the ''[[Yogi]]''{{'}}s eyes.&quot;{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|p=8}}{{Sfn|Chattopadhyaya|1999|p=31}} According to Banhatti, it was Ramakrishna who really answered Narendra's question, by saying &quot;Yes, I see Him as I see you, only in an infinitely intenser sense.&quot;{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|p=8}} Nevertheless, Vivekananda was more influenced by the Brahmo Samaj's and its new ideas, than by Ramakrishna.{{sfn|De Michelis|2005|p=49}} It was Sen's influence who brought Vivekananda fully into contact with western esotericism, and it was also via Sen that he met Ramakrishna.{{sfn|De Michelis|2005|p=50}}

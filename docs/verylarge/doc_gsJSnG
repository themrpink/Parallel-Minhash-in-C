==Personal life==
In her autobiography,&lt;ref name = Autobiography/&gt; Shepherd revealed that she called her mother in 1978, crying and unhappy with the way her life and career were going. Her mother replied, &quot;Cybill, come home.&quot; Shepherd went home to Memphis, where she met and began dating David M. Ford, a local auto parts dealer and nightclub entertainer. She became [[pregnant]], and the couple married that year. Their daughter, [[Clementine Ford]], was born in 1979. The marriage ended in divorce in 1982.

In 1987, Shepherd became pregnant by chiropractor Bruce Oppenheim and married him. They had twins, Cyrus Zachariah and Molly Ariel Shepherd-Oppenheim,&lt;ref name=filmr/&gt; born during the fourth season of ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]''. The couple divorced in 1990.

In June 2012, Shepherd became engaged to Andrei Nikolajevic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/cybill-shepherd-reveals-engaged-a-jeweler-gave-a-gorgeous-sparkler-a-gem-article-1.1119768#ixzz21SndTrJQ | work=Daily News | title=Cybill Shepherd reveals she's recently engaged | date=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, the engagement had been called off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.etonline.com/news/161141_cybill_shepherd_shares_her_spiritual_journey|title=Cybill Shepherd Shares Her Spiritual Journey|website=Entertainment Tonight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Robert De Niro]] asked her out during the filming of ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976). She turned him down, and he did not speak to her, except in character, for the rest of the filming. She later said she regretted turning him down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://watch.accesshollywood.com/video/cybill-shepherd-on-past-loves-almost-loves:-elvis-presley-robert-deniro-more/1560922953001# |title=Cybill Shepherd On Past Loves &amp; Almost-Loves: Elvis Presley, Robert DeNiro &amp; More |publisher=Watch.accesshollywood.com |accessdate=February 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001123210/http://watch.accesshollywood.com/video/cybill-shepherd-on-past-loves-almost-loves:-elvis-presley-robert-deniro-more/1560922953001 |archive-date=October 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Apartment''''' is a 1960 American [[romantic comedy]]-[[drama]] film produced and directed by [[Billy Wilder]] from a screenplay he co-wrote with [[I. A. L. Diamond]], starring [[Jack Lemmon]] and [[Shirley MacLaine]], alongside [[Fred MacMurray]], [[Ray Walston]], [[Jack Kruschen]], [[David Lewis (American actor)|David Lewis]], [[Willard Waterman]], [[David White (actor)|David White]], [[Hope Holiday]], and [[Edie Adams]].

The story follows C.C. &quot;Bud&quot; Baxter (Lemmon), an [[insurance]] clerk who, in the hope of climbing the corporate ladder, lets more senior coworkers use his [[Upper West Side]] apartment to conduct extramarital affairs. Bud is attracted to the [[elevator operator]], Fran Kubelik (MacLaine), who in turn is having an affair with Bud's immediate boss, Sheldrake (MacMurray).

''The Apartment'' was distributed by [[United Artists]] to critical and commercial success, despite controversy owing to its subject matter. It became the [[1960 in film|8th highest grossing film of 1960]] and at the [[33rd Academy Awards]], was nominated for ten awards and won five, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]. Lemmon and MacLaine were Oscar-nominated and won [[Golden Globe Award]]s for their performances in the film. It provided the basis for ''[[Promises, Promises (musical)|Promises, Promises]]'', a 1968 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theatre|musical]] by [[Burt Bacharach]], [[Hal David]] and [[Neil Simon]].

In the years since its release, ''The Apartment'' has come to be regarded as one of the greatest films ever made, appearing in lists by the [[American Film Institute]] and ''[[Sight and Sound]]'' magazine. In 1994, it was one of the 25 films selected for inclusion to the [[United States Library of Congress]] [[National Film Registry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=1994-11-15|title=25 Films Added to National Registry|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/15/movies/25-films-added-to-national-registry.html|access-date=2020-05-18|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing {{!}} Film Registry {{!}} National Film Preservation Board {{!}} Programs at the Library of Congress {{!}} Library of Congress|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA|access-date=2020-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{Long plot|date=October 2020}}
C.C. &quot;Bud&quot; Baxter is a lonely office drudge at a national insurance corporation in a high-rise building in [[New York City]]. In order to climb the corporate ladder, Bud allows four company managers to take turns borrowing his [[Upper West Side]] apartment for their various extramarital liaisons, which are so noisy that his neighbors assume that Bud is a playboy bringing home a different woman every night.

The four managers write glowing reports about Bud, who hopes for a promotion from the personnel director, Jeff D. Sheldrake. Sheldrake does promote Bud, but he knows why they were so enthusiastic and demands exclusive privileges to borrow the apartment himself, starting that same night. As compensation for such short notice, he gives Baxter two tickets to ''[[The Music Man]]''.

After work, Bud catches Fran Kubelik, an [[elevator operator]] he has had his eye on, and asks her to go to the musical with him. She accepts, but first has to meet a former fling. He is Sheldrake, who convinces her that he is about to divorce his wife for her. They go to Bud's apartment as Bud waits forlornly outside the theater.

Later, at the company's raucous Christmas party, Sheldrake's secretary Miss Olsen drunkenly tells Fran that Fran is one of many female employees Sheldrake has seduced into affairs with the false promise of divorcing his wife, including Miss Olsen herself. At Bud's apartment, Fran confronts Sheldrake, upset with herself for believing his lies. Sheldrake maintains that he genuinely loves her, but then leaves to return to his suburban family as usual.

Meanwhile, Bud accidentally learns about Sheldrake and Fran when he notices Fran's broken hand mirror, the same one which he returned to Sheldrake. Heartbroken, he lets himself be picked up by a married woman at a local bar. When they arrive at his apartment, he is shocked to find Fran in his bed, fully clothed and unconscious from an intentional overdose of his sleeping pills. He sends his pick-up away and enlists the help of his neighbor, Dr. Dreyfuss, to revive Fran without notifying the authorities. To protect both his and her jobs, Bud takes advantage of his playboy reputation, letting Dreyfuss believe Fran had accidentally swallowed too many pills after a lovers' quarrel with him. Scolding Bud for his apparent philandering, Dreyfuss advises him to &quot;be a mensch, a human being.&quot; 

Fran spends two days recuperating in the apartment, while Bud does his best to entertain and distract her from any suicidal thoughts, and a bond develops between them. He tells her he once attempted suicide himself over unrequited feelings for a girl who now sends him a fruitcake every Christmas. They begin playing a game of [[gin rummy]] as Fran reveals that she has always suffered bad luck in her love life. Bud dissuades her from phoning her family until her head is clear, before preparing a romantic dinner for her. During this period one of the executives arrives with a woman; Bud sends them away, but the man sees Fran. Then Fran's brother-in-law Karl Matuschka comes to the office looking for her. Resenting Bud for denying them access to his apartment, the executives direct Karl there. When Bud again takes responsibility for Fran's actions, Karl punches him. Fran kisses Bud on the forehead for not revealing her affair with Sheldrake and, sensing that she now cares for him, Bud smiles and says it &quot;didn't hurt a bit.&quot;

Sheldrake rewards Bud with a further promotion, and fires Miss Olsen for what she told Fran. Miss Olsen retaliates by revealing the years of affairs to Sheldrake's wife, who promptly throws her husband out. Sheldrake moves into a room at his athletic club, but now figures he can string Fran along while he enjoys his newfound bachelorhood. However, when Sheldrake asks Bud for the apartment key, Bud instead gives back the key to the executive washroom, announces he has decided to become a [[mensch]], and quits the firm, no longer willing to participate in the corrupt executives' exploitation of women, especially Fran. 

That night at a [[New Year's Eve]] party, Sheldrake indignantly tells Fran what happened. Realizing she is in love with Bud, Fran abandons Sheldrake and runs to Bud's apartment. At the door, she hears a loud noise like a gunshot. Fearing that Bud has attempted suicide again, Fran screams his name and pounds on the door until Bud opens it, holding an overflowing bottle of champagne which was the source of the noise. Bud has been packing, planning to find a new job and a new home, and is surprised and delighted to see her. Fran insists on resuming their gin rummy game, telling Bud she is now free as well. He asks, &quot;What about Mr. Sheldrake?&quot; and she responds, &quot;We'll send him a fruitcake every Christmas.&quot; He declares his love for her, and she replies lovingly, &quot;Shut up and deal,&quot; which he does as they smile adoringly at each other.

==Production==
[[File:The apartment trailer jack lemmon.JPG|thumb|right|[[Jack Lemmon]] in a still from the film's trailer. ''The Apartment'' marked his second collaboration with [[Billy Wilder]] after ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''.]]
Immediately following the success of ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'', Wilder and Diamond wished to make another film with Lemmon. Wilder had originally planned to cast [[Paul Douglas (actor)|Paul Douglas]] as Sheldrake; however, after he died unexpectedly, MacMurray was cast.

The initial concept came from ''[[Brief Encounter]]'' by [[Noël Coward]], in which Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson) meets Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard) for a thwarted tryst in his friend's apartment. However, due to the [[Hays Production Code]], Wilder was unable to make a film about adultery in the 1940s. Wilder and Diamond also based the film partially on a Hollywood scandal in which high-powered agent [[Jennings Lang]] was shot by producer [[Walter Wanger]] for having an affair with Wanger's wife, actress [[Joan Bennett]]. During the affair, Lang used a low-level employee's apartment.&lt;ref&gt;Billy Wilder Interviews: [[Conversations with Filmmakers Series]]&lt;/ref&gt; Another element of the plot was based on the experience of one of Diamond's friends, who returned home after breaking up with his girlfriend to find that she had committed suicide in his bed.

Although Wilder generally required his actors to adhere exactly to the script, he allowed Lemmon to improvise in two scenes: In one scene, he squirts a bottle of nasal spray across the room, and in another, he sings while cooking spaghetti (which he strains through the grid of a tennis racket). In another scene, where Lemmon was supposed to mime being punched, he failed to move correctly, and was accidentally knocked down. Wilder chose to use the shot of the genuine punch in the film. Lemmon also caught a cold when one scene on a park bench was filmed in sub-zero weather.

Art director [[Alexandre Trauner]] used [[forced perspective]] to create the set of a large insurance company office. The set appeared to be a very long room full of desks and workers; however, successively smaller people and desks were placed to the back of the room, ending up with children. He designed the set of Baxter's apartment to appear smaller and shabbier than the spacious apartments that usually appeared in films of the day. He used items from thrift stores and even some of Wilder's own furniture for the set.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Chandler, Charlotte. ''Nobody's perfect: Billy Wilder : a personal biography''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's title theme, written by [[Charles Williams (composer)|Charles Williams]] and originally titled &quot;Jealous Lover&quot;, was first heard in the 1949 film ''[[The Romantic Age]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080224234735/http://www.guildmusic.com/light/catalogue/5107.htm 5107 Charles Williams &amp; The Queen's Hall Light Orchestra at GuildMusic.com].

Although Lemmon did not win the Oscar, [[Kevin Spacey]] dedicated his Oscar for ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'' (1999) to Lemmon's performance. According to the behind-the-scenes feature on the ''American Beauty'' DVD, the film's director, [[Sam Mendes]], had watched ''The Apartment'' (among other classic American films) as inspiration in preparation for shooting his film.

Within a few years after ''The Apartment'''s release, the routine use of [[black-and-white]] film in Hollywood had ended. As of 2014, only two black-and-white movies have won the Academy Award for Best Picture after ''The Apartment'' did: ''[[Schindler's List]]'' (1993) &lt;!-- which includes a few seconds of color, so the wording &quot;filmed entirely in B&amp;W&quot; would be wrong --&gt; and ''[[The Artist (film)|The Artist]]'' (2011).

In 1994, ''The Apartment'' was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]]. In 2002, a poll of film directors conducted by ''[[Sight and Sound]]'' magazine listed the film as the 14th greatest film of all time (tied with ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/directors-long.html BFI | Sight &amp; Sound | Top Ten Poll 2002 - The rest of the directors' list&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, ''Premiere'' voted this film as one of &quot;The 50 Greatest Comedies Of All Time&quot;.

==Qattara Depression Project==
{{Main|Qattara Depression Project}}

The large size of the Qattara Depression and the fact that it falls to a depth of 133 meters below mean sea level has led to several proposals to create a massive [[hydroelectric power]] project in northern Egypt rivalling that of the [[Aswan High Dam]]. This project is known as the [[Qattara Depression Project]]. The proposals call for a large canal or tunnel being excavated from the Qattara due north of {{convert|55|to|80|km|mi}} depending on the route chosen to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to bring seawater into the area.&lt;ref&gt;Ragheb, M. 2010.

An alternative plan involved running a 320 kilometre (200-mile) pipeline northeast to the [[freshwater]] [[Nile River]] at [[Rosetta]].&lt;ref name=nileQ&gt;Mahmoud, Mohamed.

Because the Qattara Depression is in a very hot dry region with very little cloud cover, the water released at the {{convert|-70|m|ft}} level would spread out from the release point across the basin and evaporate from solar influx. Because of evaporation, more water can flow into the depression, thus forming a continual source of power. Eventually this would result in a hypersaline lake or a salt pan as the water would evaporate and leave behind the salt that it contained.

Plans to use the Qattara Depression for the generation of electricity date back to 1912 &lt;!-- this publication (behind paywall) says it was year 1916 --&gt; from Berlin geographer [[Albrecht Penck]].&lt;ref name=Peace&gt;Murakami M.

''&quot;Problems of the Libyan Desert: Geographical Journal&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] proposed to President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] that peace in the Middle East could be achieved by flooding the Qattara Depression. The resulting lagoon, according to the CIA, would have four benefits:&lt;ref&gt;MI: Gale. 2009. Farmington Hills, ''CIA Suggestions, Document Number CK3100127026''.

*It would &quot;provide work during construction and living areas after completion for the [[Palestinian Arabs]]&quot;.
*It would get [[Egypt]]ian president [[Gamel Abdel Nasser]]'s &quot;mind on other matters&quot; because &quot;he need[ed] some way to get off the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] hook&quot;.

In the 1970s and early 1980s, several proposals to flood the area were made by [[Friedrich Bassler]] and the ''Joint Venture Qattara'', a group of mainly German companies. They wanted to make use of [[peaceful nuclear explosions]] to construct a tunnel, drastically reducing construction costs compared to conventional methods. This project proposed to use 213 [[H-bombs]], with yields of one to 1.5 [[TNT equivalent|megaton]]s, detonated at depths of {{convert|100|to|500|m|ft}}. That fitted within the [[Atoms for Peace|Atoms for Peace program]] proposed by US President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] in 1953. The Egyptian government turned down the idea.&lt;ref&gt;Badescu, Viorel. 2011. ''Macro-Engineering Seawater in Unique Environments 1st Edition., 2011, XXXIX, 790 p.'' Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Revolution sidebar}}
The '''Cultural Revolution''', formally the '''Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution''', was a [[Political sociology|sociopolitical]] [[Social movement|movement]] in [[China]] from 1966 until 1976. Launched by [[Mao Zedong]], [[Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party|Chairman of the Communist Party of China]] (CPC), its stated goal was to preserve [[Ideology of the Communist Party of China|Chinese Communism]] by [[Purge|purging]] remnants of [[Capitalism|capitalist]] and [[Chinese culture|traditional]] elements from [[Culture of the People's Republic of China|Chinese society]], and to re-impose Mao Zedong Thought (known outside China as ''[[Maoism]]'') as the [[dominant ideology]] in the CPC. The Revolution marked Mao's return to the central position of power in China after a period of [[Seven Thousand Cadres Conference|less radical leadership]] to recover from the failures of the [[Great Leap Forward]], which contributed to the [[Great Chinese Famine]] only five years prior.

Launching the movement in May 1966 with the help of the [[Cultural Revolution Group]], Mao soon called on young people to &quot;[[Bombard the Headquarters|bombard the headquarters]]&quot;, and proclaimed that &quot;to rebel is justified&quot;. In order to eliminate his rivals within the CPC and in schools, factories, and government institutions, Mao charged that [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] elements had infiltrated the government and society with the aim of restoring capitalism. He insisted that [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]] be removed through violent [[Class conflict|class struggle]], to which China's youth, as well as urban workers, responded by forming [[Red Guard (China)|Red Guards]] and &quot;[[Rebellion|rebel groups]]&quot; around the country. They would begin to hold [[struggle session]]s regularly, and [[Seizure of power (Cultural Revolution)|grab power]] from local governments and CPC branches, eventually establishing the [[Revolutionary committee (China)|revolutionary committees]] in 1967. The groups often split into rival factions, however, becoming involved in '[[Violent Struggle|violent struggles]]' ({{Lang-zh|t=武鬥|s=武斗|p=wǔdòu}}), to which the [[People's Liberation Army]] had to be sent to restore order.

Having compiled a selection of Mao's sayings into the [[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung|''Little Red Book'']], which became a sacred text for [[Mao Zedong's cult of personality|Mao's personality cult]], [[Lin Biao]], [[Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Vice Chairman of the CPC]], was written into the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|constitution]] as Mao's successor. In 1969, Mao suggested the end of the Cultural Revolution. However, the Revolution's active phase would last until at least 1971, when Lin Biao, accused of a [[Project 571|botched coup against Mao]], fled and [[Lin Biao incident|died in a plane crash]]. In 1972, the [[Gang of Four]] rose to power and the Cultural Revolution continued. After [[Death of Chairman Mao|Mao's death]] and the arrest of the Gang of Four in 1976, the Cultural Revolution finally came to an end.

The Cultural Revolution damaged [[Economy of China|China's economy]] and [[Chinese culture|traditional culture]], with an estimated death toll ranging from hundreds of thousands to 20&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pye|first1=Lucian W.|date=1986|title=Reassessing the Cultural Revolution|journal=The China Quarterly |volume=108|issue=108|pages=597–612|issn=0305-7410|jstor=653530|doi=10.1017/S0305741000037085}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1017272/remembering-dark-days-chinas-cultural-revolution|title=Remembering the dark days of China's Cultural Revolution |date=2012-08-18 |website=South China Morning Post |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180609084717/http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1017272/remembering-dark-days-chinas-cultural-revolution|archive-date=June 9, 2018|access-date=2019-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Strauss |first1=Valerie |last2=Southerl |first2=Daniel |date=1994-07-17|title=HOW MANY DIED?

==Background==
===Great Leap Forward===
{{Main|Great Leap Forward}}
In 1958, after China's first [[Five-year plans of China|Five-Year Plan]], Mao called for &quot;[[grassroots]] [[socialism]]&quot; in order to accelerate his plans for turning China into a modern [[Developed country|industrialized state]]. In this spirit, Mao launched the Great Leap Forward, established [[People's Commune]]s in the countryside, and began the [[mass mobilization]] of the people into [[collectives]]. Many communities were assigned production of a single commodity—[[Steel production by country|steel]]. Mao vowed to increase agricultural production to twice that of 1957 levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tang&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Iron smelting in 1958 China, from- Backyardfurnace5 (cropped).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|People in the countryside working at night to produce steel during the [[Great Leap Forward]]]]
The Great Leap was an economic failure. Many uneducated farmers were pulled from farming and harvesting and instead instructed to produce steel on a massive scale, partially relying on [[backyard furnace]]s to achieve the production targets set by local cadres. The steel produced was of low quality and mostly useless. The Great Leap reduced harvest sizes and led to a decline in the production of most goods except substandard [[pig iron]] and steel. Furthermore, local authorities frequently exaggerated production numbers, hiding and intensifying the problem for several years.&lt;ref name=&quot;umd&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Worden|first1=Robert|title=A Country Study:China|url=http://www-chaos.umd.edu/history/prc2.html|publisher=Library of Congress|year=1987|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716180625/http://www-chaos.umd.edu/history/prc2.html|archive-date=July 16, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jin1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jin|first1=Qiu|title=The Culture of Power: Lin Biao and the Cultural Revolution|year=1999|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, California|pages=25–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, chaos in the collectives, bad weather, and exports of food necessary to secure hard currency resulted in the [[Great Chinese Famine]]. Food was in desperate shortage, and production fell dramatically.

The Great Leap's failure reduced Mao's prestige within the Party. Forced to take major responsibility, in 1959, Mao resigned as the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President of China]], China's ''de jure'' head of state, and was succeeded by [[Liu Shaoqi]], while Mao remained as [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Party chairman]] and [[Supreme Military Command of the People's Republic of China|Commander-in-chief]]. In July, [[Lushan Conference|senior Party leaders convened]] at the scenic [[Mount Lu]] to discuss policy. At the conference, Marshal [[Peng Dehuai]], the Minister of Defence, criticized Great Leap policies in a private letter to Mao, writing that it was plagued by mismanagement and cautioning against elevating political dogma over the laws of economics.&lt;ref name=umd/&gt;

Despite the moderate tone of Peng's letter, Mao took it as a personal attack against his leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Jin Qiu, [[#jin1|p. 55]]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Conference, Mao had Peng removed from his posts, and accused him of being a &quot;right-opportunist&quot;. Peng was replaced by [[Lin Biao]], another revolutionary army general who became a more staunch Mao supporter later in his career. While the Lushan Conference served as a death knell for Peng, Mao's most vocal critic, it led to a shift of power to moderates led by Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, who took effective control of the [[Economy of China|economy]] following 1959.&lt;ref name=umd/&gt;

By the early 1960s, many of the Great Leap's economic policies were reversed by initiatives spearheaded by Liu, Deng, and Premier [[Zhou Enlai]]. This moderate group of pragmatists were unenthusiastic about Mao's utopian visions. Owing to his loss of esteem within the party, Mao developed a decadent and eccentric lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Spence&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=January 2020}} By 1962, while Zhou, Liu and Deng managed affairs of state and the economy, Mao had effectively withdrawn from economic decision-making, and focused much of his time on further contemplating his contributions to Marxist–Leninist social theory, including the idea of &quot;continuous revolution&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Jin Qiu, Ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This theory's ultimate aim was to set the stage for Mao to restore his brand of Communism and his personal prestige within the Party.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

===Sino-Soviet split and anti-revisionism===
{{main|Sino-Soviet split}}
In the early 1950s, the People's Republic of China and the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) were the two largest [[Communist states]] in the world. Although initially they had been mutually supportive, disagreements arose after the [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin|death of Joseph Stalin]] and the rise of [[Nikita Khrushchev]] to power in the Soviet Union. In 1956, Khrushchev [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|denounced Stalin and his policies]], and began implementing post-Stalinist economic reforms. Mao and many other members of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) opposed these changes, believing that they would have negative repercussions for the worldwide [[Marxist]] movement, among whom [[Stalin]] was still viewed as a hero.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacFarquhar and Schoenals 2006. pp. 04-07&quot;&gt;[[#Mac06|MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006]]. pp. 4–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mao believed that Khrushchev did not adhere to [[Marxism–Leninism]], but was instead a [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]], altering his policies from basic Marxist–Leninist concepts, something Mao feared would allow [[capitalists]] to regain control of the country. Relations between the two governments soured. The USSR refused to support China's case for joining the [[United Nations]] and went back on its pledge to supply China with a [[nuclear weapon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MacFarquhar and Schoenals 2006. pp. 04-07&quot;/&gt;

Mao went on to publicly denounce revisionism in April 1960. Without pointing fingers at the Soviet Union, Mao criticized its ideological ally, the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]]. In turn, the USSR criticized China's ally the [[Party of Labour of Albania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MacFarquhar and Schoenals 2006. p. 07&quot;&gt;[[#Mac06|MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006]]. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, the CCP began to denounce the Soviet Union openly, publishing nine polemics against its perceived revisionism, with one of them being titled ''On Khrushchev's Phoney Communism and Historical Lessons for the World'', in which Mao charged that Khrushchev was not only a revisionist but also increased the danger of capitalist restoration.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacFarquhar and Schoenals 2006. p. 07&quot;/&gt; Khrushchev's downfall from an internal ''coup d'état'' in 1964 also contributed to Mao's fears of his own political vulnerability, mainly because of his declining prestige among his colleagues after the Great Leap Forward.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacFarquhar and Schoenals 2006. p. 07&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Luo Ruiqing.jpg|thumb|upright|The purge of General [[Luo Ruiqing]] solidified the Army's loyalty to Mao]]
{{see also|Socialist Education Movement}}
In 1963, Mao launched the [[Socialist Education Movement]], which is regarded as the precursor of the Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;:11&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baum|first1=Richard|date=1969|title=Revolution and Reaction in the Chinese Countryside: The Socialist Education Movement in Cultural Revolutionary Perspective|journal=The China Quarterly|volume=38|issue=38|pages=92–119|doi=10.1017/S0305741000049158|issn=0305-7410|jstor=652308}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mao had set the scene for the Cultural Revolution by &quot;[[Purge|cleansing]]&quot; powerful officials of questionable loyalty who were based in [[Beijing]]. His approach was less than transparent, achieving this purge through newspaper articles, internal meetings, and by skillfully employing his network of [[Political alliance|political allies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:11&quot; /&gt;

In late 1959, historian and [[Deputy mayor of Beijing|Beijing Deputy Mayor]] [[Wu Han (historian)|Wu Han]] published a [[historical drama]] entitled ''[[Hai Rui Dismissed from Office]]''. In the play, an honest [[Civil Servant|civil servant]], [[Hai Rui]], is dismissed by a corrupt emperor. While Mao initially praised the play, in February 1965, he secretly commissioned his wife [[Jiang Qing]] and [[Shanghai]] [[Propaganda|propagandist]] [[Yao Wenyuan]] to publish an article criticizing it.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals. pp. 15–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Yao boldly alleged that ''Hai Rui'' was really an [[allegory]] attacking Mao; that is, Mao was the corrupt emperor, and [[Peng Dehuai]] was the honest civil servant.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yao's article put Beijing Mayor [[Peng Zhen]]&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-roman&quot;&gt;No relation to Peng Dehuai&lt;/ref&gt; on the defensive. Peng, a powerful official and Wu Han's direct superior, was the head of the &quot;[[Five Man Group]]&quot;, a committee commissioned by Mao to study the potential for a cultural revolution. Peng Zhen, aware that he would be implicated if Wu indeed wrote an &quot;anti-Mao&quot; play, wished to contain Yao's influence. Yao's article was initially only published in select local newspapers. Peng forbade its publication in the nationally distributed ''[[People's Daily]]'' and other major newspapers under his control, instructing them to write exclusively about &quot;academic discussion,&quot; and not pay heed to Yao's petty politics.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals. pp. 14–19.&lt;/ref&gt; While the &quot;literary battle&quot; against Peng raged, Mao fired [[Yang Shangkun]]—director of the [[General Office of the Communist Party of China|Party's General Office]], an organ that controlled [[internal communications]]—on a series of unsubstantiated charges, installing in his stead staunch [[Loyalism|loyalist]] [[Wang Dongxing]], head of Mao's security detail.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[#Mac06|MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006]]. Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Yang's dismissal likely emboldened Mao's allies to move against their factional rivals.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;

In December, [[Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China|Defence Minister]] and Mao loyalist [[Lin Biao]] accused General [[Luo Ruiqing]], the chief of staff of the PLA, of being anti-Mao, alleging that Luo put too much emphasis on military training rather than Maoist &quot;political discussion.&quot; Despite initial skepticism in the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]] of Luo's guilt, Mao pushed for an 'investigation', after which Luo was denounced, dismissed, and forced to deliver a [[self-criticism]]. Stress from the events led Luo to attempt suicide.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006. pp. 20–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Luo's removal secured the military command's loyalty to Mao.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having ousted Luo and Yang, Mao returned his attention to Peng Zhen. On February 12, 1966, the &quot;Five Man Group&quot; issued a report known as the ''February Outline'' ({{lang|zh|二月提纲}}). The ''Outline'', sanctioned by the Party centre, defined ''Hai Rui'' as a constructive ''academic'' discussion and aimed to distance Peng Zhen formally from any ''political'' implications. However, Jiang Qing and Yao Wenyuan continued their denunciation of Wu Han and Peng Zhen. Meanwhile, Mao also sacked [[Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Propaganda Department]] director [[Lu Dingyi]], a Peng Zhen ally.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;[[#Mac06|MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006]] Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lu's removal gave Maoists unrestricted access to the press. Mao would deliver his final blow to Peng Zhen at a high-profile Politburo meeting through loyalists [[Kang Sheng]] and [[Chen Boda]]. They accused Peng Zhen of opposing Mao, labeled the ''February Outline'' &quot;evidence of Peng Zhen's revisionism,&quot; and grouped him with three other disgraced officials as part of the &quot;Peng-Luo-Lu-Yang Anti-Party Clique.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; On May 16, the Politburo formalized the decisions by releasing an official document condemning Peng Zhen and his &quot;anti-party allies&quot; in the strongest terms, disbanding his &quot;Five Man Group&quot;, and replacing it with the Maoist [[Cultural Revolution Group]] (CRG).&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals. pp. 27–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early stage: mass movement (1966–68) ==
{{anchor|Beginning}}

===May 16 Notification===
In May 1966, an &quot;expanded session&quot; of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]] was called in Beijing. The conference, rather than being a joint discussion on policy (as per the usual norms of party operations), was mainly a campaign to mobilize the Politburo into endorsing Mao's [[political agenda]]. The conference was heavily laden with Maoist political rhetoric on class struggle and filled with meticulously-prepared 'indictments' on the recently ousted leaders such as Peng Zhen and Luo Ruiqing. One of these documents, released on May 16, was prepared with Mao's personal supervision and was particularly damning:&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mac06|MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006]]. pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those representatives of the [[bourgeoisie]] who have sneaked into the Party, the government, the army, and various spheres of culture are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once conditions are ripe, they will seize political power and turn the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] into a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Some of them we have already seen through; others we have not. Some are still trusted by us and are being trained as our successors, persons like Khrushchev for example, who are still nestling beside us.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[#Mac06|MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006]]. p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This text, which became known as the &quot;May 16 Notification&quot; ({{zh|s=五一六通知|p=Wǔyīliù Tōngzhī}}), summarized Mao's ideological justification for the Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Li Xuefeng quoted in [[#Mac06|MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006]]. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively it implied that there were enemies of the Communist cause within the Party itself: class enemies who &quot;wave the red flag to oppose the red flag.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ms46&quot;&gt;[[#Mac06|MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006]]. p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The only way to identify these people was through &quot;the telescope and microscope of Mao Zedong Thought.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ms46&quot;/&gt; While the party leadership was relatively united in approving the general direction of Mao's agenda, many Politburo members were not especially enthusiastic, or simply confused about the direction of the movement.&lt;ref name=nianyi13&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wang|first1=Nianyi|title=大动乱的年代：1949–1989 年的中国 [Great age of turmoil, a history of China 1949–89]|date=1989|publisher=Henan Renmin Chubanshe|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges against esteemed party leaders like Peng Zhen rang alarm bells in China's intellectual community and among the [[United Front (China)|eight non-Communist parties]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ms41&quot;&gt;[[#Mac06|MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006]]. p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early mass rallies (May–June 1966) ===
After the purge of [[Peng Zhen]], the Beijing Party Committee had effectively ceased to function, paving the way for disorder in the capital. On May 25, under the guidance of {{Interlanguage link|Cao Yi'ou|lt=|zh|曹轶欧|WD=}}—wife of Maoist henchman [[Kang Sheng]]—[[Nie Yuanzi]], a philosophy lecturer at [[Peking University]], authored a [[big-character poster]] ({{zh|s=大字报|p=dàzìbào|c=|t=|labels=no}}) along with other [[Left-wing politics|leftists]] and posted it to a public bulletin. Nie attacked the university's party administration and its leader [[Lu Ping]].&lt;ref name=mac57&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, pp. 56–58&lt;/ref&gt; Nie insinuated that the university leadership, much like Peng Zhen, were trying to contain revolutionary fervour in a &quot;sinister&quot; attempt to oppose the party and advance revisionism.&lt;ref name=mac57/&gt;

Mao promptly endorsed Nie's ''dazibao'' as &quot;the first [[Marxism|Marxist]] big-character poster in China.&quot; Nie's call-to-arms, now sealed with Mao's personal stamp of approval, had a lasting [[ripple effect]] across all educational institutions in China. Students everywhere began to revolt against their respective schools' party establishment. Classes were promptly cancelled in Beijing primary and secondary schools, followed by a decision on June 13 to expand the class suspension nationwide.&lt;ref name=mac59&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, pp. 59–61&lt;/ref&gt; By early June, throngs of young demonstrators lined the capital's major [[thoroughfare]]s holding giant portraits of Mao, beating drums, and shouting slogans against his perceived enemies.&lt;ref name=mac59/&gt;

When the dismissal of Peng Zhen and the municipal party leadership became public in early June, widespread confusion ensued. The public and foreign missions were kept in the dark on the reason for Peng Zhen's ousting.&lt;ref name=mac62&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, pp. 62–64&lt;/ref&gt; Even the top Party leadership was caught off guard by the sudden [[anti-establishment]] wave of protest and struggled with what to do next.&lt;ref name=mac62/&gt; After seeking Mao's guidance in [[Hangzhou]], [[Liu Shaoqi]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]] decided to send in 'work teams' ({{zh|s=工作组|p=Gōngzuò zǔ|c=|t=|labels=no}})—effectively 'ideological-guidance' squads of [[Cadre (military)|cadres]]—to the city's schools and ''[[People's Daily]]'' to restore some semblance of order and re-establish party control.&lt;ref name=mac62/&gt;

The work teams were hastily dispatched and had a poor understanding of student sentiment. Unlike the political movement of the 1950s that squarely targeted intellectuals, the new movement was focused on established party cadres, many of whom were part of the work teams. As a result, the work teams came under increasing suspicion for being yet another group aimed at thwarting revolutionary fervour.&lt;ref name=mac71&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; The party leadership subsequently became divided over whether or not work teams should remain in place. Liu Shaoqi insisted on continuing work-team involvement and suppressing the movement's most radical elements, fearing that the movement would spin out of control.&lt;ref name=mac75&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, the 72-year-old Chairman Mao took to the [[Yangtze River]] in [[Wuhan]], with the press in tow, in what became an iconic &quot;swim across the [[Yangtze]]&quot; to demonstrate his battle-readiness. He subsequently returned to Beijing on a mission to criticize the party leadership for its handling of the work-teams issue. Mao accused the work teams of undermining the student movement, calling for their full withdrawal on July 24. Several days later a rally was held at the [[Great Hall of the People]] to announce the decision and set the new tone of the movement to university and high school teachers and students. At the rally, Party leaders told the masses assembled to 'not be afraid' and bravely take charge of the movement themselves, free of Party interference.&lt;ref name=mac84&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

The work-teams issue marked a decisive defeat for President [[Liu Shaoqi]] politically; it also signaled that disagreement over how to handle the unfolding events of the Cultural Revolution would break Mao from the established party leadership irreversibly. On August 1, the Eleventh [[Plenum (meeting)|Plenum]] of the [[8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Eighth Central Committee]] was hastily convened to advance Mao's now decidedly radical agenda. At the plenum, Mao showed outright disdain for Liu, repeatedly interrupting Liu as he delivered his opening day speech.&lt;ref name=mac94&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; For several days, Mao repeatedly insinuated that the Party's leadership had contravened his revolutionary vision. Mao's line of thinking received a lukewarm reception from the conference attendees. Sensing that the largely obstructive party elite was unwilling to embrace his revolutionary ideology on a full scale, Mao went on the offensive.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

On July 28, [[Red Guards|Red Guard]] representatives wrote to Mao, calling for rebellion and upheaval to safeguard the revolution. Mao then responded to the letters by writing his own [[big-character poster]] entitled ''[[Bombard the Headquarters]]'', rallying people to target the &quot;command centre (i.e., Headquarters) of counterrevolution.&quot; Mao wrote that despite having undergone a Communist revolution, a &quot;bourgeois&quot; elite was still thriving in &quot;positions of authority&quot; in the government and Communist Party.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tang&quot;&gt;[[Tsou Tang|Tang, Tsou]]. [1986] 1986. ''The Cultural Revolution and Post-Mao Reforms: A Historical Perspective''. Chicago: [[University of Chicago Press]]. {{ISBN|0-226-81514-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although no names were mentioned, this provocative statement by Mao has been interpreted as a direct indictment of the party establishment under Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping—the purported &quot;bourgeois headquarters&quot; of China. The personnel changes at the Plenum reflected a radical re-design of the party's hierarchy to suit this new ideological landscape. Liu and Deng kept their seats on the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]] but were in fact sidelined from day-to-day party affairs. Lin Biao was elevated to become the Party's number-two figure; Liu Shaoqi's rank went from second to eighth and was no longer Mao's heir apparent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tang&quot;/&gt;

Coinciding with the top leadership being thrown out of positions of power was the thorough undoing of the entire national bureaucracy of the Communist Party. The extensive [[Organization Department of the Communist Party of China|Organization Department]], in charge of party personnel, virtually ceased to exist. The Cultural Revolution Group (CRG), Mao's ideological '[[Praetorian Guard]]', was catapulted to prominence to propagate his ideology and rally popular support. The top officials in the [[Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China|Propaganda Department]] were sacked, with many of its functions folding into the CRG.&lt;ref name=mac96&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although the bourgeoisie has been overthrown, it is still trying to use the old ideas, culture, customs, and habits of the exploiting classes to corrupt the masses, capture their minds, and stage a comeback. The proletariat must do just the opposite: It must meet head-on every challenge of the [[bourgeoisie]]…to change the outlook of society. Currently, our objective is to struggle against and crush those people in authority who are taking the capitalist road, to criticize and repudiate the reactionary bourgeois academic &quot;authorities&quot; and the ideology of the bourgeoisie and all other exploiting classes and to transform education, literature and art, and all other parts of the superstructure that do not correspond to the socialist economic base, so as to facilitate the consolidation and development of the socialist system.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The implications of the Sixteen Points were far-reaching. It elevated what was previously a student movement to a nationwide mass campaign that would galvanize workers, farmers, soldiers and lower-level party functionaries to rise, challenge authority, and re-shape the &quot;superstructure&quot; of society.[[File:1966-11 1966年9月15日天安门游行-八届十一中.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Tiananmen Square]] on September 15, 1966 the occasion of Chairman Mao's third of eight mass rallies with Red Guards in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cri.cn/gb/9223/2006/04/19/1266@1007752_1.htm |script-title=zh:&quot;毛泽东八次接见红卫兵始末(上) &quot; |script-newspaper=zh:新闻午报 |date=2006-04-19 |language=zh-cn}} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306043233/http://news.cri.cn/gb/9223/2006/04/19/1266@1007752_1.htm |date=March 6, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Source: ''[[China Pictorial]]'']]

On August 22, 1966, a central directive was issued to stop police intervention in Red Guard activities, and those in the police force who defied this notice were labeled [[Counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionaries]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mac124&quot;&gt;[[Roderick MacFarquhar|MacFarquhar, Roderick]] and Schoenhals, Michael.

The most violent aspects of the campaign included incidents of torture, murder, and [[public humiliation]]. Many people who were indicted as counter-revolutionaries died by suicide. During the Red August 1966, in Beijing alone 1,772 people were murdered. In Shanghai, there were 704 suicides and 534 deaths related to the Cultural Revolution in September. In Wuhan, there were 62 suicides and 32 murders during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar &amp; Schoenhals; p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Peng Dehuai was brought to Beijing to be publicly ridiculed.

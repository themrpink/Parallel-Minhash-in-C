Hyperlexic children are often fascinated by [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s or [[number]]s.  They are extremely good at decoding language and thus often become very early readers.  Some English-speaking hyperlexic children learn to spell long words (such as ''[[elephant]]'') before they are two years old and learn to read whole sentences before they turn three.
An [[fMRI]] study of a single child showed that hyperlexia may be the [[neurological]] opposite of [[dyslexia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14715131&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turkeltaub|first1=Peter E|last2=Flowers|first2=D.Lynn|last3=Verbalis|first3=Alyssa|last4=Miranda|first4=Martha|last5=Gareau|first5=Lynn|last6=Eden|first6=Guinevere F|title=The Neural Basis of Hyperlexic Reading: An fMRI Case Study|journal=[[Neuron (journal)|Neuron]]|date=January 2004|volume=41|issue=1|pages=11–25|doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(03)00803-1|pmid=14715131|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=May 2020}}&lt;!-- What does opposite even mean in this case?

== Etymology==
The word hyperlexia is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] terms ''hyper'' (&quot;over, beyond, overmuch, above measure&quot;)&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url= https://www.etymonline.com/word/hyper- |title=hyper- |last=Harper |first=Douglas |website=Etymonline |access-date=2020-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''lexis'' (&quot;word&quot;).&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url= https://www.etymonline.com/word/dyslexia |title=dyslexia |last=Harper |first=Douglas |website=Etymonline |access-date=2020-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Although hyperlexic children usually learn to read in a non-communicative way, several studies have shown that they can acquire reading comprehension and communicative language after the onset of hyperlexia.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; They follow a different developmental trajectory relative to neurotypical individuals, with milestones being acquired in a different order. Despite hyperlexic children's precocious reading ability, they may struggle to [[communicate]].  Often, hyperlexic children will have a precocious ability to read but will learn to speak only by [[rote learning|rote]] and heavy repetition, and may also have difficulty learning the [[rules of language]] from examples or from [[trial and error]], which may result in social problems. Their language may develop using [[echolalia]], often repeating words and sentences.  Often, the child has a large [[vocabulary]] and can identify many objects and pictures, but cannot put their language skills to good use. Spontaneous language is lacking and their [[Pragmatics|pragmatic speech]] is [[Language delay|delayed]]. Hyperlexic children often struggle with [[Five Ws|Who? What? Where? Why? and How? questions]]. Between the ages of 4 and 5 years old, many children make great strides in communicating.

The [[social skills]] of a child with hyperlexia often lag tremendously.  Hyperlexic children often have far less interest in playing with other children than do their peers.

==Types of hyperlexia==

In one paper, [[Darold Treffert]] proposes three types of hyperlexia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyperlexia Types&quot;/&gt; Specifically:
*Type 1: [[Neurotypical]] children who are very early readers.
*Type 2: Children on the autism spectrum who demonstrate very early reading as a [[splinter skill]].
*Type 3: Very early readers who are not on the autism spectrum, though they exhibit some &quot;autistic-like&quot; traits and behaviours which gradually fade as the child gets older.

A different paper by [[Rebecca Williamson Brown]], [[Doctor of Optometry|OD]] proposes only two types of hyperlexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Rebecca Williamson|title=Hyperlexia: Related to Vision and Language Problems|url=http://www.nldline.com/hyperlexia.htm|website=NLDline|access-date=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are:
*Type 1: Hyperlexia marked by an accompanying language disorder.
*Type 2: Hyperlexia marked by an accompanying [[visual-spatial learning disorder]].

==Non-English studies==

In studies in [[Cantonese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]], subjects were able to read non-words in their native [[orthography]] without a delay relative to the speed with which they read real words in their native orthography.  There is a delay noted with exception words in [[English language|English]], including the examples 'chaos', 'unique', and 'enough'.  These studies also illustrate difficulties in understanding what it is that they are reading.  The findings suggest that non-hyperlexic readers rely more heavily on word [[semantics]] in order to make inferences about word meaning.&lt;ref name=&quot;HyperK&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Sung Hee|last2=Hwang|first2=Mina|title=Word and nonword processing without meaning support in Korean-speaking children with and without hyperlexia|journal=[[Reading and Writing]]|date=1 August 2014|volume=28|issue=2|pages=217–238|doi=10.1007/s11145-014-9522-3|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4fe2e06c552deb7003bffacddbda86862683bac0}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 February 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HyperC&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wong|first1=W.|last2=Weekes|first2=B.|last3=Iao|first3=L.|last4=To|first4=K.|last5=Su|first5=I.|title=Is Reading Aloud Semantically Mediated in Chinese Hyperlexia?|journal=Procedia — Social and Behavioral Sciences|date=October 2013|volume=94|pages=153–154|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.09.075|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cantonese study distinguish [[homographs]] and determine the readings for rarely used characters.  In this study, the subject also made errors of [[phonetic analogy]] and regularization of sound.  The authors of the study suggest that the two-routes model for reading Chinese characters may be in effect for hyperlexics.  The two-routes model describes understanding of Chinese characters in a purely phonetic sense and the understanding of Chinese characters in a semantic sense.&lt;ref name=&quot;HyperC&quot; /&gt;

The semantics deficit is also illustrated in the study of Korean hyperlexics through a priming experiment.  Non-hyperlexic children read words primed with a related image faster than non-primed words while hyperlexics read them at the same pace.  Lee Sunghee and Hwang Mina, the authors of the Korean study, also found that hyperlexics have fewer errors in non-word reading than non-hyperlexics.  They suggest that this may be because of an imbalance in the [[phonological]], [[orthographical]], and semantic understandings of the subjects’ native language and writing system, in this case, [[Hangul]].  This combination of the parts of linguistics is known as [[connectionist theory]], in which non-words are distinguished from words by differences in interaction between phonology, orthography, and semantics.&lt;ref name=&quot;HyperK&quot; /&gt;

In the Lee and Hwang study, the subjects scored lower on general language test and vocabulary tests than the average for their age groups.  Literacy education in [[South Korea]] involves teaching students entire words, rather than starting with the relationship between phonemes and letters in Hangul, despite evidence that letter name knowledge is useful for learning to read words that have not been taught.  The results suggest that hyperlexics are able to obtain the relations between letters (or the smallest unit of the writing system) and their phonemes without knowing the names.&lt;ref name=&quot;HyperK&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Klit&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Young-Suk|title=The foundation of literacy skills in Korean: the relationship between letter-name knowledge and phonological awareness and their relative contribution to literacy skills|journal=Reading and Writing|date=29 June 2008|volume=22|issue=8|pages=907–931|doi=10.1007/s11145-008-9131-0|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3c095349af9783e706ccee3d41559369ca4a70c1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reading comprehension|Comprehension]] difficulties can also be a result of hyperlexia.  Semantics and comprehension both have ties to meaning.  Semantics relates to the meaning of a certain word while comprehension is the understanding of a longer text.  In both studies, interpretation-based and meaning-based tests proved difficult for the hyperlexic subjects.  In the Weeks study, the subject was unable to identify characters based on the logographic aspect of the writing system, and in the Lee and Hwang study, priming was ineffective in decreasing reading times for hyperlexics.&lt;ref name=&quot;HyperK&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HyperC&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Klit&quot; /&gt;

==Acquisition==
Although it is generally associated with autism, a 69-year-old woman appears to have been made hyperlexic because of a &quot;[[cerebral infarction]] in the left anterior [[cingulate cortex]] and [[corpus callosum]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suzuki&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suzuki|first1=T|last2=Itoh|first2=S|last3=Hayashi|first3=M|last4=Kouno|first4=M|last5=Takeda|first5=K|title=Hyperlexia and ambient echolalia in a case of cerebral infarction of the left anterior cingulate cortex and corpus callosum.|journal=[[Neurocase]]|date=October 2009|volume=15|issue=5|pages=384–9|pmid=19585352|doi=10.1080/13554790902842037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Memory types}}

'''Flash memory''' is an [[Integrated circuit|electronic]] [[Non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[computer memory]] [[computer data storage|storage medium]] that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed. The two main types of flash memory, NOR flash and NAND flash, are named after the [[NOR gate|NOR]] and [[NAND gate|NAND]] [[logic gate]]s. The individual flash [[memory cell (computing)|memory cells]], consisting of [[floating-gate MOSFET]]s, exhibit internal characteristics similar to those of the corresponding gates.

Flash memory is a type of [[floating-gate]] memory that was invented at [[Toshiba]] in 1980, based on [[EEPROM]] technology. Toshiba commercially introduced flash memory to the market in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; While [[EPROM]]s&lt;!-- Not a spelling mistake: older technology EPROMs were chip erased--&gt; had to be completely erased before being rewritten, NAND-type flash memory may be erased, written and read in blocks (or pages) which are generally much smaller than the entire device. NOR-type flash allows a single [[machine word]] to be written{{snd}} to an erased location{{snd}} or read independently. A flash memory device typically consists of one or more flash [[memory chip]]s (each holding many flash memory cells) along with a separate [[flash memory controller]] chip.

The NAND type is found primarily in [[memory card]]s, [[USB&amp;nbsp;flash drive]]s, [[solid-state drive]]s (those produced in 2009 or later), [[feature phone]]s, [[smartphone]]s and similar products, for general storage and transfer of data. NAND or NOR&amp;nbsp;flash memory is also often used to store configuration data in numerous digital products, a task previously made possible by EEPROM or battery-powered [[static RAM]]. One key disadvantage of flash memory is that it can only endure a relatively small number of write cycles in a specific block.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.flashstorage.com/flash-storage-technical-economic-primer/ | work= FlashStorage.com | title= A Flash Storage Technical and Economic Primer | date= 30 March 2015 | url-status= live | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150720220844/http://www.flashstorage.com/flash-storage-technical-economic-primer/ | archivedate= 20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Example applications of flash memory include [[computers]], [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s, [[digital audio players]], [[digital camera]]s, [[mobile phones]], [[synthesizers]], [[video games]], [[scientific instrument]]ation, [[industrial robotics]], and [[medical electronics]]. In addition to being non-volatile, flash memory offers fast read [[access time]]s, although not as fast as static RAM or ROM.&lt;ref name=&quot;flashnvm7&quot; /&gt; Its mechanical shock resistance helps explain its popularity over [[hard disk]]s in portable devices.

Because erase cycles are slow, the large block sizes used in flash memory erasing give it a significant speed advantage over non-flash EEPROM when writing large amounts of data. {{As of|2019|post=,}} flash memory costs much less than byte-programmable EEPROM and had become the dominant memory type wherever a system required a significant amount of non-volatile [[solid-state storage]]. EEPROMs, however, are still used on applications that only require small amounts of storage, like in [[serial presence detect]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.micron.com/-/media/client/global/documents/products/technical-note/dram-modules/tn_04_42.pdf?rev=e5a1537ce3214de5b695f17c340fd023&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/serial-presence-detect-SPD#:~:text=When%20a%20computer%20is%20booted,%2C%20data%20width%2C%20speed%2C%20and&lt;/ref&gt;

Flash memory packages can use [[Three-dimensional integrated circuit|die stacking]] with [[through-silicon via]]s and several dozen layers of 3D TLC NAND cells (per die) simultaneously to achieve capacities of up to 1 [[tebibyte]] per package using 16 dies and an integrated [[flash controller]] as a separate die inside the package.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/13918/samsung-starts-production-of-1-tb-eufs-21-storage-for-smartphones|title=Samsung Starts Production of 1 TB eUFS 2.1 Storage for Smartphones|first=Anton|last=Shilov|website=AnandTech.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/12120/samsung-starts-production-of-512-gb-ufs-chips|title=Samsung Starts Production of 512 GB UFS NAND Flash Memory: 64-Layer V-NAND, 860 MB/s Reads|first=Anton|last=Shilov|website=AnandTech.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi = 10.1109/ISSCC.2017.7870331|s2cid = 206998691|chapter = 11.4 a 512Gb 3b/Cell 64-stacked WL 3D V-NAND flash memory|title = 2017 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC)|year = 2017|last1 = Kim|first1 = Chulbum|last2 = Cho|first2 = Ji-Ho|last3 = Jeong|first3 = Woopyo|last4 = Park|first4 = Il-han|last5 = Park|first5 = Hyun-Wook|last6 = Kim|first6 = Doo-Hyun|last7 = Kang|first7 = Daewoon|last8 = Lee|first8 = Sunghoon|last9 = Lee|first9 = Ji-Sang|last10 = Kim|first10 = Wontae|last11 = Park|first11 = Jiyoon|last12 = Ahn|first12 = Yang-lo|last13 = Lee|first13 = Jiyoung|last14 = Lee|first14 = Jong-Hoon|last15 = Kim|first15 = Seungbum|last16 = Yoon|first16 = Hyun-Jun|last17 = Yu|first17 = Jaedoeg|last18 = Choi|first18 = Nayoung|last19 = Kwon|first19 = Yelim|last20 = Kim|first20 = Nahyun|last21 = Jang|first21 = Hwajun|last22 = Park|first22 = Jonghoon|last23 = Song|first23 = Seunghwan|last24 = Park|first24 = Yongha|last25 = Bang|first25 = Jinbae|last26 = Hong|first26 = Sangki|last27 = Jeong|first27 = Byunghoon|last28 = Kim|first28 = Hyun-Jin|last29 = Lee|first29 = Chunan|last30 = Min|first30 = Young-Sun|pages = 202–203|isbn = 978-1-5090-3758-2|display-authors = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://m.hexus.net/tech/news/storage/127010-samsung-enables-1tb-eufs-21-smartphones/|title=Samsung enables 1TB eUFS 2.1 smartphones - Storage - News - HEXUS.net|website=m.hexus.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atalla]] and Korean engineer [[Dawon Kahng]] at [[Bell Labs]] in 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerhistory&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.computerhistory.org/siliconengine/metal-oxide-semiconductor-mos-transistor-demonstrated/|title=1960 - Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) Transistor Demonstrated|journal=The Silicon Engine|publisher=[[Computer History Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kahng went on to develop a variation, the floating-gate MOSFET, with [[Simon Min Sze]] at Bell Labs in 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerhistory1971&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=1971: Reusable semiconductor ROM introduced |url=https://www.computerhistory.org/storageengine/reusable-semiconductor-rom-introduced/ |website=[[Computer History Museum]] |accessdate=19 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; They proposed that it could be used as floating-gate [[memory cell (computing)|memory cells]] for storing a form of programmable [[read-only memory]] ([[Programmable read-only memory|PROM]]) that is both non-volatile and re-programmable.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerhistory1971&quot;/&gt;

Early types of floating-gate memory included EPROM (erasable PROM) and EEPROM (electrically erasable PROM) in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerhistory1971&quot; /&gt; However, early floating-gate memory required engineers to build a memory cell for each [[bit]] of data, which proved to be cumbersome,&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Fulford |first=Adel |title=Unsung hero |work=Forbes |date=24 June 2002 |accessdate=18 March 2008 |url=https://www.forbes.com/global/2002/0624/030.html |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303205125/http://www.forbes.com/global/2002/0624/030.html |archivedate=3 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; slow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How ROM Works |url=https://computer.howstuffworks.com/rom5.htm |website=[[HowStuffWorks]] |accessdate=10 September 2019 |date=29 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expensive, restricting floating-gate memory to niche applications in the 1970s, such as [[military equipment]] and the earliest experimental [[mobile phones]].&lt;ref name=&quot;economist&quot; /&gt;

===Invention and commercialization===
[[Fujio Masuoka]], while working for [[Toshiba]], proposed a new type of floating-gate memory that allowed entire sections of memory to be erased quickly and easily, by applying a voltage to a single wire connected to a group of cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;economist&quot;/&gt; This led to Masuoka's invention of flash memory at Toshiba in 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US|4531203|Fujio Masuoka}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|4531203|Semiconductor memory device and method for manufacturing the same}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Toshiba, the name &quot;flash&quot; was suggested by Masuoka's colleague, Shōji Ariizumi, because the erasure process of the memory contents reminded him of the [[flash (photography)|flash of a camera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Data-Storage/NAND-Flash-Memory-25-Years-of-Invention-Development-684048/ |title=NAND Flash Memory: 25 Years of Invention, Development - Data Storage - News &amp; Reviews - eWeek.com |work=eweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Masuoka and colleagues presented the invention of [[#NOR memories|NOR]] flash in 1984,&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Toshiba: Inventor of Flash Memory |url=http://www.flash25.toshiba.com |website=[[Toshiba]] |accessdate=20 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Masuoka |first1=F. |last2=Asano |first2=M. |last3=Iwahashi |first3=H. |last4=Komuro |first4=T. |last5=Tanaka |first5=S. |title=A new flash E2PROM cell using triple polysilicon technology |journal=1984 International Electron Devices Meeting |date=December 1984 |pages=464–467 |doi=10.1109/IEDM.1984.190752|s2cid=25967023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then [[#NAND memories|NAND]] flash at the ''[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] 1987 International Electron Devices Meeting'' (IEDM) held in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=New ultra high density EPROM and flash EEPROM with NAND structure cell |last1=Masuoka |first1=F. |last2=Momodomi |first2=M. |last3=Iwata |first3=Y. |last4=Shirota |first4=R. |year=1987 |conference=[[International Electron Devices Meeting|IEDM]] 1987 |book-title=Electron Devices Meeting, 1987 International |publisher=[[IEEE]]|doi=10.1109/IEDM.1987.191485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NAND flash has reduced erase and write times, and requires less chip area per cell, thus allowing greater storage density and lower cost per bit than NOR&amp;nbsp;flash. However, the I/O interface of NAND&amp;nbsp;flash does not provide a random-access external address bus. Rather, data must be read on a block-wise basis, with typical block sizes of hundreds to thousands of bits. This makes NAND&amp;nbsp;flash unsuitable as a drop-in replacement for program ROM, since most microprocessors and microcontrollers require byte-level random access. In this regard, NAND&amp;nbsp;flash is similar to other secondary [[data storage device]]s, such as hard disks and [[optical media]], and is thus highly suitable for use in mass-storage devices, such as [[memory card]]s and [[solid-state drive]]s (SSD). Flash memory cards and SSDs store data using multiple NAND flash memory chips.

The first NAND-based removable memory card format was [[SmartMedia]], released in 1995. Many others followed, including [[MultiMediaCard]], [[Secure Digital]], [[Memory Stick]], and [[xD-Picture Card]].

===Later developments===
A new generation of memory card formats, including [[RS-MMC]], [[miniSD]] and [[microSD]], feature extremely small form factors. For example, the microSD card has an area of just over 1.5&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a thickness of less than 1&amp;nbsp;mm.

NAND flash has achieved significant levels of memory [[Transistor density|density]] as a result of several major technologies that were commercialized during the late 2000s to early 2010s.&lt;ref name=&quot;James&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=James |first1=Dick |title=3D ICs in the real world |journal=25th Annual SEMI Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Conference (ASMC 2014) |date=2014 |pages=113–119 |doi=10.1109/ASMC.2014.6846988 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271453642|isbn=978-1-4799-3944-2 |s2cid=42565898 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Multi-level cell]] (MLC) technology stores more than one [[bit]] in each [[memory cell (computing)|memory cell]]. [[NEC]] demonstrated [[multi-level cell]] (MLC) technology in 1998, with an 80{{nbsp}}[[Mebibit|Mb]] flash memory chip storing 2 bits per cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nec.co.jp/press/en/9710/2801.html|title=NEC: News Release 97/10/28-01|website=www.nec.co.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[STMicroelectronics]] also demonstrated MLC in 2000, with a 64{{nbsp}}Mbb [[NOR flash]] memory chip.&lt;ref name=&quot;stol&quot;/&gt; In 2009, Toshiba and [[SanDisk]] introduced NAND flash chips with QLC technology storing [[4-bit]] per cell and holding a capacity of 64{{nbsp}}Gbit.&lt;ref name=&quot;toshiba2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;toshiba-sd-2009&quot;/&gt; [[Samsung Electronics]] introduced [[triple-level cell]] (TLC) technology storing 3-bits per cell, and began mass-producing NAND chips with TLC technology in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;samsung-history&quot;/&gt;

[[Charge trap flash]] (CTF) technology was first disclosed in 1967 by [[John Szedon]] and Ting L. Chu but was not used for flash memory production until 2002. In 1991, [[NEC]] researchers including N. Kodama, K. Oyama and Hiroki Shirai described a type of flash memory with a charge trap method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kodama |first1=N. |last2=Oyama |first2=K. |last3=Shirai |first3=H. |last4=Saitoh |first4=K. |last5=Okazawa |first5=T. |last6=Hokari |first6=Y. |title=A symmetrical side wall (SSW)-DSA cell for a 64 Mbit flash memory |journal=International Electron Devices Meeting 1991 [Technical Digest] |date=December 1991 |pages=303–306 |doi=10.1109/IEDM.1991.235443|isbn=0-7803-0243-5 |s2cid=111203629 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Boaz Eitan of [[Saifun Semiconductors]] (later acquired by [[Spansion]]) [[patented]] a flash memory technology named NROM that took advantage of a charge trapping layer to replace the [[floating gate]] used in conventional flash memory designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eitan|first=Boaz|title=US Patent 5,768,192: Non-volatile semiconductor memory cell utilizing asymmetrical charge trapping|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=5,768,192.PN.&amp;OS=PN/5,768,192&amp;RS=PN/5,768,192|publisher=US Patent &amp; Trademark Office|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, an [[Advanced Micro Devices]] (AMD) research team led by Richard M.

==Principles of operation==
[[File:Flash cell structure.svg|thumb|350px|right|A flash memory cell]]

Flash memory stores information in an array of memory cells made from [[floating-gate transistor]]s. In [[single-level cell]] (SLC) devices, each cell stores only one bit of information. [[Multi-level cell]] (MLC) devices, including [[triple-level cell]] (TLC) devices, can store more than one bit per cell.

The floating gate may be conductive (typically [[polycrystalline silicon|polysilicon]] in most kinds of flash memory) or non-conductive (as in [[SONOS]] flash memory).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Matt |last=Basinger |title=PSoC Designer Device Selection Guide |date=18 January 2007 |id=AN2209 |url=http://www.psocdeveloper.com/uploads/tx_piapappnote/an2209_03.pdf |quote=The [[PSoC]] ... utilizes a unique Flash process: [[SONOS]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091031121330/http://www.psocdeveloper.com/uploads/tx_piapappnote/an2209_03.pdf |archivedate=31 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Floating-gate MOSFET===
{{Main| Floating-gate MOSFET}}

In flash memory, each memory cell resembles a standard [[metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor]] (MOSFET) except that the transistor has two gates instead of one. The cells can be seen as an electrical switch in which current flows between two terminals (source and drain) and is controlled by a floating gate (FG) and a control gate (CG). The CG is similar to the gate in other MOS transistors, but below this, there is the FG insulated all around by an oxide layer. The FG is interposed between the CG and the MOSFET channel. Because the FG is electrically isolated by its insulating layer, electrons placed on it are trapped. When the FG is charged with electrons, this charge [[electric field screening|screens]] the [[electric field]] from the CG, thus, increasing the [[threshold voltage]] (V&lt;sub&gt;T1&lt;/sub&gt;) of the cell. This means that now a higher voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;T2&lt;/sub&gt;) must be applied to the CG to make the channel conductive. In order to read a value from the transistor, an intermediate voltage between the threshold voltages (V&lt;sub&gt;T1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp; V&lt;sub&gt;T2&lt;/sub&gt;) is applied to the CG. If the channel conducts at this intermediate voltage, the FG must be uncharged (if it was charged, we would not get conduction because the intermediate voltage is less than V&lt;sub&gt;T2&lt;/sub&gt;), and hence, a logical &quot;1&quot; is stored in the gate. If the channel does not conduct at the intermediate voltage, it indicates that the FG is charged, and hence, a logical &quot;0&quot; is stored in the gate. The presence of a logical &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot; is sensed by determining whether there is current flowing through the transistor when the intermediate voltage is asserted on the CG. In a multi-level cell device, which stores more than one [[bit]] per cell, the amount of current flow is sensed (rather than simply its presence or absence), in order to determine more precisely the level of charge on the FG.

===Fowler–Nordheim tunneling===

The process of moving electrons from the control gate and into the floating gate is called [[Fowler–Nordheim tunneling]], and it fundamentally changes the characteristics of the cell by increasing the MOSFET's threshold voltage. This, in turn, changes the drain-source current that flows through the transistor for a given gate voltage, which is ultimately used to encode a binary value. The Fowler-Nordheim tunneling effect is reversible, so electrons can be added to or removed from the floating gate, processes traditionally known as writing and erasing.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hyperstone.com/en/Solid-State-bit-density-and-the-Flash-Memory-Controller-1235,12728.html, Solid State bit density, and the Flash Memory Controller, Retrieved 29.

If a worker delays receiving Social Security retirement benefits until after they reach full retirement age,&lt;ref name=&quot;socialsecurity.gov&quot; /&gt; the benefit will increase by two-thirds of one percent of the PIA per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/delayret.html|title=Benefits Planner: Retirement {{!}} Delayed Retirement Credits {{!}} Social Security Administration|website=ssa.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; After age 70 there are no more increases as a result of delaying benefits. Social Security uses an &quot;average&quot; survival rate at your full retirement age to prorate the increase in the amount of benefit increase so that the total benefits are roughly the same whenever you retire. Women may benefit more than men from this delayed benefit increase since the &quot;average&quot; survival rates are based on both men and women and women live approximately three years longer than men. The other consideration is that workers only have a limited number of years of &quot;good&quot; health left after they reach full retirement age and unless they enjoy their job they may be passing up an opportunity to do something else they may enjoy doing while they are still relatively healthy.

===Benefits while continuing work===
Due to changing needs or personal preferences, a person may go back to work after retiring. In this case, it is possible to get Social Security retirement or survivors benefits and work at the same time. A worker who is of full retirement age or older may (with spouse) keep all benefits, after taxes, regardless of earnings. But, if this worker or the worker's spouse are younger than full retirement age and receiving benefits and earn &quot;too much&quot;, the benefits will be reduced. If working under full retirement age for the entire year and receiving benefits, Social Security deducts $1 from the worker's benefit payments for every $2 earned above the annual limit of $15,120 (2013). Deductions cease when the benefits have been reduced to zero and the worker will get one more year of income and age credit, slightly increasing future benefits at retirement. For example, if you were receiving benefits of $1,230/month (the average benefit paid) or $14,760 a year and have an income of $29,520/year above the $15,120 limit ($44,640/year) you would lose all ($14,760) of your benefits. If you made $1,000 more than $15,200/year you would &quot;only lose&quot; $500 in benefits. You would get no benefits for the months you work until the $1 deduction for $2 income &quot;squeeze&quot; is satisfied. Your first social security check will be delayed for several months—the first check may only be a fraction of the &quot;full&quot; amount. The benefit deductions change in the year you reach full retirement age and are still working—Social Security only deducts $1 in benefits for every $3 you earn above $40,080 in 2013 for that year and has no deduction thereafter. The income limits change (presumably for inflation) year by year.&lt;ref&gt;Working and Social Security Benefits [http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10069.pdf] accessed November 6, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|WIDOWBENEFITS}}Widow(er) benefits===
If a worker covered by Social Security dies, a surviving spouse can receive survivors' benefits if a 9-month duration of marriage is met. If a widow waits until Full Retirement Age, they are eligible for [https://www.simplywise.com/blog/ss-benefits-if-my-spouse-dies/ 100 percent of their deceased spouse's PIA]. If the death of the worker was accidental the duration of marriage test may be waived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0200305100|title=SSA - POMS: GN 00305.100 - Marital Relationship Duration - 07/17/2006|website=secure.ssa.gov|access-date=2019-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A divorced spouse may qualify if the duration of marriage was at least 10 full years and the widow(er) is not currently married, or remarried after attainment of age 60 (50 if disabled and eligible for specific types of benefits&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0300207003|title=SSA - POMS: RS 00207.003 - How Remarriage Affects Widow(er)'s Benefits - 09/02/2014|website=secure.ssa.gov|access-date=2019-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; prior to the date of marriage). A father or mother of any age with a child age 16 or under or a disabled adult child in his or her care may be eligible for benefits. The earliest age for a non-disabled widow(er)'s benefit is age 60. If the worker received retirement benefits prior to death, the benefit amount may not exceed the amount the worker was receiving at the time of death or 82.5% of the PIA of the deceased worker (whichever is more).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/lnx/0200204045|title=SSA - POMS: GN 00204.045 - Assisting Title II Surviving Spouse or Surviving Divorced Spouse Claimants with Month of Election (MOEL) Decisions when the Retirement Insurance Benefit &amp;ndash; Limitation (RIB LIM) Applies - 11/05/2008|website=secure.ssa.gov|access-date=2019-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the surviving spouse starts benefits before full retirement age, there is an [[actuarial]] reduction.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSApub10084&quot; /&gt; If the worker earned delayed retirement credits by waiting to start benefits after their full retirement age, the surviving spouse will have those credits applied to their benefit.&lt;ref name=&quot;ssa.gov1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ssa.gov/planners/survivors/ifyou.html|title=Benefits Planner: Survivors - If You Are The Survivor - Social Security Administration|website=ssa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the worker died before the year of attainment of age 62, the earnings will be indexed to the year in which the surviving spouse attained age 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/lnx/0300615302|title=SSA - POMS: RS 00615.302 - Windexing - Alternate Method of Computing Benefits for Widow(er)s First Eligible 1/85 and Later - 06/05/2006|website=secure.ssa.gov|access-date=2019-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children's benefits===
Children of a retired, disabled or deceased worker receive benefits as a &quot;dependent&quot; or &quot;survivor&quot; if they are under the age of 18, or as long as attending primary or secondary school up to age 19 years, 2 months; or are over the age of 18 and were disabled before the age of 22.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSApub10084&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/10084.html|title=Survivors Benefits|year=2007|work=SSA Publication No. 05-10084, ICN 468540| publisher = [[Social Security Administration]] | access-date= December 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SSApub10085&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialsecurity.gov/pubs/EN-05-10085.pdf|title=Benefits for Children|year=2012|work=SSA Publication No. EN-05-10085, ICN 468550| publisher = [[Social Security Administration]] | access-date= March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The benefit for a child on a living parent's record is 50% of the PIA, for a surviving child the benefit is 75% of the PIA. The benefit amount may be reduced if total benefits on the record exceed the family maximum.

In ''[[Astrue v. Capato]]'' (2012), the Supreme Court unanimously held that children conceived after a parent's death (by [[in vitro fertilization]] procedure) are not entitled to Social Security survivors' benefits if the laws of the state in which the parent's will was signed do not provide for such benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Mears, [http://articles.cnn.com/2012-05-21/justice/justice_scotus-posthumous-conception-ruling_1_survivors-benefits-children-justices Justices deny benefits for child conceived after death of a parent] (May 21, 2012). CNN.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disability===
{{More citations needed|date=November 2007}}
A worker who has worked long enough and recently enough (based on &quot;quarters of coverage&quot; within the recent past) to be covered ''can'' receive disability benefits. These benefits start after five full calendar months of disability, regardless of his or her age. The eligibility formula requires a certain number of credits (based on earnings) to have been earned overall, and a certain number within the ten years immediately preceding the disability, but with more-lenient provisions for younger workers who become disabled before having had a chance to compile a long earnings history.

The worker must be unable to continue in his or her previous job and unable to adjust to other work, with age, education, and work experience taken into account; furthermore, the disability must be long-term, lasting 12 months, expected to last 12 months, resulting in death, or expected to result in death.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.ssa.gov.652&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=What We Mean By Disability | url=http://www.ssa.gov/dibplan/dqualify4.htm | access-date=December 3, 2005 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051130054729/http://www.ssa.gov/dibplan/dqualify4.htm | archive-date=November 30, 2005 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the retirement benefit, the amount of the disability benefit payable depends on the worker's age and record of covered earnings.

[[Supplemental Security Income]] (SSI) uses the same disability criteria as the insured social security disability program, but SSI is not based upon insurance coverage. Instead, a system of means-testing is used to determine whether the claimants' income and net worth fall below certain income and asset thresholds.

Severely disabled [[child]]ren may qualify for SSI. Standards for child disability are different from those for adults.

Disability determination at the Social Security Administration has created the largest system of administrative courts in the United States. Depending on the state of residence, a claimant whose initial application for benefits is denied can request ''reconsideration'' or a ''hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)''. Such hearings sometimes involve participation of an independent vocational expert (VE) or medical expert (ME), as called upon by the ALJ.

Reconsideration involves a re-examination of the evidence and, in some cases, the opportunity for a hearing before a (non-[[attorney at law (United States)|attorney]]) disability hearing officer. The hearing officer then issues a decision in writing, providing justification for his/her finding. If the claimant is denied at the reconsideration stage, (s)he may request a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. In some states, SSA has implemented a pilot program that eliminates the reconsideration step and allows claimants to appeal an initial denial directly to an Administrative Law Judge.

Because the number of applications for Social Security disability is very large (approximately 650,000 applications per year), the number of hearings requested by claimants often exceeds the capacity of Administrative Law Judges. The number of hearings requested and availability of Administrative Law Judges varies geographically across the United States. In some areas of the country, it is possible for a claimant to have a hearing with an Administrative Law Judge within 90 days of his/her request. In other areas, waiting times of 18 months are not uncommon.

After the hearing, the [[Administrative Law Judge]] (ALJ) issues a decision in writing. The decision can be ''Fully Favorable'' (the ALJ finds the claimant disabled as of the date that (s) he alleges in the application through the present), ''Partially Favorable'' (the ALJ finds the claimant disabled at some point, but not as of the date alleged in the application; OR the ALJ finds that the claimant ''was'' disabled but has improved), or ''Unfavorable'' (the ALJ finds that the claimant was not disabled at all). Claimants can appeal decisions to Social Security's Appeals Council, which is in [[Virginia]]. The Appeals Council does not hold hearings; it accepts written briefs. Response time from the Appeals Council can range from 12 weeks to more than 3 years.

If the claimant disagrees with the Appeals Council's decision, (s)he can appeal the case in the [[United States district court|federal district court]] for his/her jurisdiction. As in most federal court cases, an unfavorable district court decision can be appealed to the appropriate [[United States Court of Appeals]], and an unfavorable appellate court decision can be appealed to the [[United States Supreme Court]].

The Social Security Administration has maintained its goal for judges to resolve 500–700 cases per year but an Administrative Law Judge on the average nationwide disposes of approximately 400 cases per year. The debate about the social security system in the United States has been ongoing for decades and there is much concern about its sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Administering Social Security: Challenges Yesterday and Today|url=https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v70n3/v70n3p27.html|website=Social Security Administration Research, Statistics, and Policy Analysis|language=en|access-date=2020-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Krent|first1=Harold J.|last2=Morris|first2=Scott|date=26 May 2020|title=Inconsistency and Angst in District Court Resolution of Social Security Disability Appeals|url=https://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3418&amp;context=fac_schol|journal=Hastings Law Journal|volume=67|pages=367–403|via=Chicago-Kent College of Law Scholarly Commons @ IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joining and quitting===
Obtaining a Social Security number for a child is voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/10023.html |title=Social Security Numbers For Children |publisher= [[Social Security Administration]] |date= November 3, 2008 |access-date= May 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, there is no general legal requirement that individuals join the Social Security program unless they want or have to work. Under normal circumstances, FICA taxes or SECA taxes will be collected on all wages. About the only way to avoid paying either FICA or SECA taxes is to join a religion that does not believe in insurance, such as the [[Amish]] or a religion whose members have taken a vow of poverty (see IRS publication 517&lt;ref&gt;Social Security and Other Information for Members of the Clergy and Religious Workers [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p517.pdf] accessed October 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and 4361&lt;ref&gt;Application for Exemption From Self-Employment Tax for Use By Ministers, Members of Religious Orders and Christian Science Practitioners [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/f4361--2011.pdf] accessed October 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;). Federal workers employed before 1987, various state and local workers including those in some school districts who had their own retirement and disability programs were given the one-time option of joining Social Security. Many employees and retirement and disability systems opted to keep out of the Social Security system because of the cost and the limited benefits. It was often much cheaper to obtain much higher retirement and disability benefits by staying in their original retirement and disability plans.&lt;ref&gt;Why Illinois Teachers Aren't in Social Security [http://trs.illinois.gov/press/reform/ss_why.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110031413/http://trs.illinois.gov/press/reform/ss_why.htm |date=January 10, 2015 }} accessed October 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Now only a few of these plans allow new hires to join their existing plans without also joining Social Security. In 2004, the Social Security Administration estimated that 96% of all U.S. workers were covered by the system with the remaining 4% mostly a minority of government employees enrolled in [[Public employee pension plans in the United States|public employee pensions]] and not subject to Social Security taxes due to historical exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-05-786T|title=Social Security: Coverage of Public Employees and Implications for Reform|issue=GAO-05-786T|author=Barbara D.

It is possible for railroad employees to get a &quot;coordinated&quot; retirement and disability benefits. The U.S. [[Railroad Retirement Board]] (or &quot;RRB&quot;) is an independent agency in the executive branch of the United States government created in 1935&lt;ref&gt;Railroad Retirement Board [http://www.rrb.gov/opa/qa/pub_1004.asp] accessed October 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; to administer a social insurance program providing retirement benefits to the country's railroad workers. Railroad retirement Tier I payroll taxes are coordinated with social security taxes so that employees and employers pay Tier I taxes at the same rate as social security taxes and have the same benefits. In addition, both workers and employers pay Tier II taxes (about 6.2% in 2005), which are used to finance railroad retirement and disability benefit payments that are over and above social security levels. Tier 2 benefits are a supplemental retirement and disability benefit system that pays 0.875% times years of service times average highest five years of employment salary, in addition to Social Security benefits.

The FICA taxes are imposed on nearly all workers and self-employed persons. Employers are required&lt;ref name=&quot;26 USC 6051&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=26 USC 6051 | url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=browse_usc&amp;docid=Cite:+26USC6051 | access-date=November 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; to report wages for covered employment to Social Security for processing Forms W-2 and W-3.

===Trust fund===
{{Main|Social Security Trust Fund}}
[[File:Social Security Trust Fund.png|400px|right|Social Security Trust Fund]]
Social Security taxes are paid into the [[Social Security Trust Fund]] maintained by the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]] (technically, the &quot;Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund&quot;, as established by {{uscsub|42|401|a}}). Current year expenses are paid from current Social Security tax revenues. When revenues exceed expenditures, as they did between 1983 and 2009,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; the excess is invested in special series, non-marketable U.S. [[government bond]]s. Thus, the Social Security Trust Fund indirectly finances the federal government's general purpose [[deficit spending]]. In 2007, the cumulative excess of Social Security taxes and interest received over benefits paid out stood at $2.2 trillion.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.ssa.gov.659&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=OASDI Trust Funds | url=http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/STATS/table4a3.html | access-date=January 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some regard the Trust Fund as an accounting construct with no economic significance. Others argue that it has specific legal significance because the Treasury securities it holds are backed by the &quot;full faith and credit&quot; of the U.S. government, which has an obligation to repay its debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States |date=November 4, 2015 |url=https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/amendments-11-27#toc-amendment-xiv |publisher=National Archives and Records Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Social Security Administration's authority to make benefit payments as granted by Congress extends only to its current revenues and existing Trust Fund balance, ''i.e.'', redemption of its holdings of Treasury securities. Therefore, Social Security's ability to make full payments once annual benefits exceed revenues depends in part on the federal government's ability to make good on the bonds that it has issued to the Social Security trust funds. As with any other federal obligation, the federal government's ability to repay Social Security is based on its power to tax and borrow and the commitment of Congress to meet its obligations.

In 2009 the Office of the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration calculated an unfunded obligation of $15.1 trillion for the Social Security program. The unfunded obligation is the difference between the future cost of Social Security (based on several demographic assumptions such as mortality, work force participation, immigration, and age expectancy) and total assets in the Trust Fund given the expected contribution rate through the current scheduled payroll tax. This unfunded obligation is expressed in present value dollars and is a part of the Fund's long-range actuarial estimates, not necessarily a certainty of what will occur in the long run. An Actuarial Note to the calculation says that &quot;The term obligation is used in lieu of the term liability, because liability generally indicates a contractual obligation (as in the case of private pensions and insurance) that cannot be altered by the plan sponsor without the agreement of the plan participants.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unfunded Obligation and Transition Cost for the OASDI Program |url=http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/NOTES/ran1/an2008-1.pdf |work=Actuarial Note 2008.1 |publisher=[[Social Security Administration]] |date=July 2008 |access-date=June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2009 Annual Report of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Funds |url=http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/TR/2009/tr09.pdf |publisher=[[Social Security Administration]] | date = May 2009 |access-date=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Office of Hearings Operations (OHO, formerly ODAR or OHA)===
On August 8, 2017, Acting Commissioner Nancy A. Berryhill informed employees that the Office of Disability Adjudication and Review (&quot;ODAR&quot;) would be renamed to Office of Hearings Operations (&quot;OHO&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ssa.gov/appeals/hearing_process.html|title=SSA's Hearing Process, OHO|website=ssa.gov|language=en|access-date=January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The hearing offices had been known as &quot;ODAR&quot; since 2006, and the Office of Hearings and Appeals (&quot;OHA&quot;) before that.  OHO administers the ALJ hearings for the Social Security Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ssa.gov/appeals/about_us.html|title=Social Security's Hearings and Appeals|website=ssa.gov|language=en|access-date=January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Administrative Law Judges (&quot;ALJs&quot;) conduct hearings and issue decisions.  After an ALJ decision, the Appeals Council considers requests for review of ALJ decisions, and acts as the final level of administrative review for the Social Security Administration (the stage at which &quot;exhaustion&quot; could occur, a prerequisite for federal court review).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.gov/oha/ SSA.gov] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012020248/http://www.ssa.gov/oha/ |date=October 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefit payout comparisons===
Some federal, state, local and education government employees pay no Social Security but have their own retirement, disability systems that nearly always pay much better retirement and disability benefits than Social Security. These plans typically require vesting—working for 5–10 years for the same employer before becoming eligible for retirement. But their retirement typically only depends on the average of the best 3–10 years salaries times some retirement factor (typically 0.875%–3.0%) times years employed. This retirement benefit can be a &quot;reasonably good&quot; (75–85% of salary) retirement at close to the monthly salary they were last employed at. For example, if a person joined the University of California retirement system at age 25 and worked for 35 years they could receive 87.5% (2.5% × 35) of their average highest three year salary with full medical coverage at age 60. Police and firefighters who joined at 25 and worked for 30 years could receive 90% (3.0% × 30) of their average salary and full medical coverage at age 55. These retirements have cost of living adjustments (COLA) applied each year but are limited to a maximum average income of $350,000/year or less. Spousal survivor benefits are available at 100–67% of the primary benefits rate for 8.7% to 6.7% reduction in retirement benefits, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;UCRP Retirement System Brochure [http://map.ais.ucla.edu/go/1002015] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105080604/http://map.ais.ucla.edu/go/1002015 |date=November 5, 2013 }} accessed November 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; UCRP retirement and disability plan benefits are funded by contributions from both members and the university (typically 5% of salary each) and by the compounded investment earnings of the accumulated totals. These contributions and earnings are held in a trust fund that is invested. The retirement benefits are much more generous than Social Security but are believed to be actuarially sound. The main difference between state and local government sponsored retirement systems and Social Security is that the state and local retirement systems use compounded investments that are usually heavily weighted in the stock market securities—which historically have returned more than 7.0%/year on average despite some years with losses.&lt;ref name=&quot;pages.stern.nyu.edu&quot;&gt;Long term stock returns [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~%20adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html accessed 4 Nov 2013] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105074458/http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~%20adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html |date=November 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Short term federal government investments may be more secure but pay much lower average percentages. Nearly all other federal, state and local retirement systems work in a similar fashion with different benefit retirement ratios. Some plans are now combined with Social Security and are &quot;piggy backed&quot; on top of Social Security benefits. For example, the current [[Federal Employees Retirement System]], which covers the vast majority of federal civil service employees hired after 1986, combines Social Security, a modest defined-benefit pension (1.1% per year of service) and the defined-contribution [[Thrift Savings Plan]].

The current Social Security formula used in calculating the benefit level (primary insurance amount or PIA) is progressive vis-à-vis lower average salaries. Anyone who worked in OASDI covered employment and other retirement would be entitled to both the alternative non-OASDI pension and an Old Age retirement benefit from Social Security. Because of their limited time working in OASDI covered employment the sum of their covered salaries times inflation factor divided by 420 months yields a low adjusted indexed monthly salary over 35 years, AIME. The progressive nature of the PIA formula would in effect allow these workers to also get a slightly higher Social Security Benefit percentage on this low average salary. Congress passed in 1983 the Windfall Elimination Provision to minimize Social Security benefits for these recipients. The basic provision is that the first salary bracket, $0–791/month (2013) has its normal benefit percentage of 90% reduced to 40–90%—see Social Security for the exact percentage. The reduction is limited to roughly 50% of what you would be eligible for if you had always worked under OASDI taxes. The 90% benefit percentage factor is not reduced if you have 30 or more years of &quot;substantial&quot; earnings.&lt;ref&gt;Windfall Elimination Provision [http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10045.pdf#page=2] accessed October 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The average Social Security payment of $1,230/month ($14,760/year) in 2013&lt;ref&gt;Average Social security Payment [http://ssa-custhelp.ssa.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/13/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228100526/https://ssa-custhelp.ssa.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/13 |date=February 28, 2013 }} accessed November 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; is only slightly above the federal poverty level for one—$11,420/yr and below the poverty guideline of $15,500/yr for two.&lt;ref&gt;2013 Federal Poverty Guidelines [http://www.familiesusa.org/resources/tools-for-advocates/guides/federal-poverty-guidelines.html] accessed November 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

For this reason, financial advisers often encourage those who have the option to do so to supplement their Social Security contributions with private retirement plans. One &quot;good&quot; supplemental retirement plan option is an employer-sponsored [[401(K)]] (or 403(B)) plan when they are offered by an employer. 58% of American workers have access to such plans.&lt;ref&gt;The Pew Charitable Trusts: A Look at Access to Employer-Based Retirement Plans and Participation in the States [http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2016/01/retirement_savings_report_jan16.pdf] accessed October 8, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these employers will match a portion of an employee's savings dollar-for-dollar up to a certain percentage of the employee's salary. Even without employer matches, [[individual retirement account]]s (IRAs) are portable, self-directed, tax-deferred retirement accounts that offer the potential to substantially increase retirement savings. Their limitations include: the financial literacy to tell a &quot;good&quot; investment account from a less advantageous one; the savings barrier faced by those who are in low-wage employment or burdened by debt; the requirement of self-discipline to allot from an early age the required percentage of salary into &quot;good&quot; investment account(s); and the self–discipline needed to leave it there to earn [[compound interest]] until needed after retirement. Financial advisers often suggest that long-term investment horizons should be used, as historically short-term investment losses &quot;self correct&quot;, and most investments continue to deliver good average investment returns.&lt;ref name=&quot;pages.stern.nyu.edu&quot; /&gt; The IRS has tax penalties for withdrawals from IRAs, 401(K)s, etc. before the age of {{frac|59|1|2}}, and requires mandatory withdrawals once the retiree reaches 70; other restrictions may also apply on the amount of tax-deferred income one can put in the account(s).&lt;ref&gt;See: [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p590.pdf IRS Publication 590, &quot;Individual Retirement Arrangements&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105205325/https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p590.pdf |date=January 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For people who have access to them, self-directed retirement savings plans have the potential to match or even exceed the benefits earned by federal, state and local government retirement plans.

===International agreements===
People sometimes relocate from one country to another, either permanently or on a limited-time basis. This presents challenges to businesses, governments, and individuals seeking to ensure future benefits or having to deal with taxation authorities in multiple countries. To that end, the Social Security Administration has signed treaties, often referred to as ''Totalization Agreements'', with other social insurance programs in various foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|ssrn= 822504|last=Christians|first=Allison|title= Social Security in United States Treaties and Executive Agreements|date= June 28, 2006|journal= Internationalen Steuerrecht|volume=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, these agreements serve two main purposes. First, they eliminate dual Social Security taxation, the situation that occurs when a worker from one country works in another country and is required to pay Social Security taxes to both countries on the same earnings. Second, the agreements help fill gaps in benefit protection for workers who have divided their careers between the United States and another country.

The following countries have signed totalization agreements with the SSA (and the date the agreement became effective):&lt;ref name=&quot;www.ssa.gov/international&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=International Agreements | url=http://www.ssa.gov/international/status.html | access-date=January 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social Security number===
{{Main|Social Security number}}
A side effect of the Social Security program in the United States has been the near-universal adoption of the program's identification number, the [[Social Security number (United States)|Social Security number]], as the ''de facto'' U.S. [[national identification number]]. The social security number, or SSN, is issued pursuant to section 205(c)(2) of the Social Security Act, codified as {{uscsub|42|405|c|2}}. The government originally stated that the SSN would not be a means of identification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/26/weekinreview/the-nation-not-for-identification-purposes-just-kidding.html|title=The Nation; Not for Identification Purposes (Just Kidding)|first=Robert|last=Pear|date=July 26, 1998|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but currently a multitude of U.S. entities use the Social Security number as a personal identifier. These include government agencies such as the [[Internal Revenue Service]], the military as well as private agencies such as banks, colleges and universities, health insurance companies, and employers.

Although the Social Security Act itself does not require a person to have a Social Security Number (SSN) to live and work in the United States,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated5&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.hiwaay.net/~becraft/ScottSSNLetter.pdf |title=Scott SSN letter |website=home.hiwaay.net }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Internal Revenue Code does generally require the use of the social security number by individuals for federal tax purposes:

::The social security account number issued to an individual for purposes of section 205(c)(2)(A) of the Social Security Act shall, except as shall otherwise be specified under regulations of the Secretary [of the Treasury or his delegate], be used as the identifying number for such individual for purposes of this title.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|26|6109(d)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Importantly, most parents apply for Social Security numbers for their dependent children in order to&lt;ref name=&quot;Tax Reform Act of 1986&quot;&gt;keep{{cite web| url=http://www.socialsecurity.gov/history/ssn/reagantax.html | title= Tax Reform Act of 1986 | access-date=November 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; include them on their income tax returns as a dependent. Everyone filing a tax return, as taxpayer or spouse, must have a Social Security Number or [[Taxpayer Identification Number]] (TIN) since the IRS is unable to process returns or post payments for anyone without an SSN or TIN.

The [[Privacy Act of 1974]] was in part intended to limit usage of the Social Security number as a means of identification. Paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of section 7 of the Privacy Act, an uncodified provision, states in part:

::(1) It shall be unlawful for any Federal, State or local government agency to deny to any individual any right, benefit, or privilege provided by law because of such individual's refusal to disclose his social security account number.

However, the Social Security Act provides:

::It is the policy of the United States that any State (or political subdivision thereof) may, in the administration of any tax, general public assistance, driver's license, or motor vehicle registration law within its jurisdiction, utilize the social security account numbers issued by the Commissioner of Social Security for the purpose of establishing the identification of individuals affected by such law, and may require any individual who is or appears to be so affected to furnish to such State (or political subdivision thereof) or any agency thereof having administrative responsibility for the law involved, the social security account number (or numbers, if he has more than one such number) issued to him by the Commissioner of Social Security.&lt;ref&gt;Social Security Act section 205(c)(2)(C)(1), codified at subsection (c)(2)(C)(1) of {{usc|42|405}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of section 7 of the Privacy Act provides in part:

::(2) the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection ''shall not apply'' with respect to –

:::(A) any disclosure which is ''required by Federal statute'', or

:::(B) the disclosure of a social security number to any Federal, State, or local agency maintaining a system of records in existence and operating before January 1, 1975, if such disclosure was required under statute or regulation adopted prior to such date to verify the identity of an individual.&lt;ref&gt;Privacy Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-579, 88 Stat. 1897 (December 31, 1974), sec. 7(a) (emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt;

The exceptions under section 7 of the Privacy Act include the Internal Revenue Code requirement that social security numbers be used as taxpayer identification numbers for individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|26|6109|d}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographic and revenue projections===
In each year since 1982, OASDI tax receipts, interest payments and other income have exceeded benefit payments and other expenditures, for example by more than $150 billion in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.ssa.gov.661&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=OASDI Trust Funds (See above) | url=http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/STATS/table4a3.html | access-date=December 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the &quot;[[post–World War II baby boom|baby boomers]]&quot; move out of the work force and into retirement, however, expenses will come to exceed tax receipts and then, after several more years, will exceed all OASDI trust income, including interest. At that point the system will begin drawing on its trust fund Treasury Notes, and will continue to pay benefits at the current levels until the Trust Fund is exhausted. In 2013, the OASDI retirement insurance fund collected $731.1 billion and spent $645.5 billion; the disability program (DI) collected $109.1 billion and spent $140.3 billion; Medicare (HI) collected $243.0 and spent $266.8 billion and Supplementary Medical Insurance, SMI, collected $293.9 billion and spent $307.4 billion. In 2013 all Social Security programs except the retirement trust fund (OASDI) spent more than they brought in and relied on significant withdrawals from their respective trust funds to pay their bills. The retirement (OASDI) trust fund of $2,541 billion is expected to be emptied by 2033 by one estimate as new retirees become eligible to join. The disability (DI) trust fund's $153.9 billion will be exhausted by 2018; the Medicare (HI) trust fund of $244.2 billion will be exhausted by 2023 and the Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) trust fund will be exhausted by 2020 if the present rate of withdrawals continues—even sooner if they increase. The total &quot;Social Security&quot; expenditures in 2013 were $1,360 billion dollars, which was 8.4% of the $16,200 billion GNP (2013) and 37.0% of the federal expenditures of $3,684 billion (including a $971.0 billion deficit).&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehouse.gov&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;2013 Status Of The Social Security And Medicare Programs [http://www.ssa.gov/oact/trsum/] accessed October 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; All other parts of the Social Security program: medicare (HI), disability (DI) and Supplemental Medical (SMI) trust funds are already drawing down their trust funds and are projected to go into deficit in about 2020 if the present rate of withdrawals continue.&lt;ref&gt;Status Of The Social Security And Medicare Programs [http://www.ssa.gov/oact/trsum/] accessed October 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; As the trust funds are exhausted either benefits will have to be cut, fraud minimized or taxes increased. According to the [[Center for Economic and Policy Research]], [[Income inequality in the United States|upward redistribution of income]] is responsible for about 43% of the projected Social Security shortfall over the next 75 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;ceprshortfall&quot;&gt;[http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/cepr-blog/the-impact-of-the-upward-redistribution-of-wage-income-on-social-security-solvency &quot;The Impact of the Upward Redistribution of Wage Income on Social Security Solvency&quot;] ''Center for Economic and Policy Research'', February 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, this exhaustion of the OASDI Trust Fund was projected to occur in 2041 by the Social Security Administration&lt;ref name=&quot;www.ssa.gov.662&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title= Social Security Administration | url=http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TRSUM/trsummary.html | access-date=December 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by 2052 by the Congressional Budget Office, CBO.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.cbo.gov.663&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title= Congressional Budget Office | url=http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=5666&amp;sequence=0 | access-date=December 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, however, the projection for the exhaustion date of this event was moved up slightly after the recession worsened the U.S. economy's financial picture. The 2011 OASDI Trustees Report stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Annual cost exceeded non-interest income in 2010 and is projected to continue to be larger throughout the remainder of the 75-year valuation period. Nevertheless, from 2010 through 2022, total trust fund income, including interest income, is more than is necessary to cover costs, so trust fund assets will continue to grow during that time period. Beginning in 2023, trust fund assets will diminish until they become exhausted in 2036. Non-interest income is projected to be sufficient to support expenditures at a level of 77 percent of scheduled benefits after trust fund exhaustion in 2036, and then to decline to 74 percent of scheduled benefits in 2085.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = 2011 OASDI Trustees Report| publisher = [[Social Security Administration]]| url = http://www.ssa.gov/oact/tr/2011/II_D_project.html| access-date = July 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2007, the Social Security Trustees suggested that either the payroll tax could increase to 16.41 percent in 2041 and steadily increased to 17.60 percent in 2081 or a cut in benefits by 25 percent in 2041 and steadily increased to an overall cut of 30 percent in 2081.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/TR/TR07/II_conclu.html |title=2007 OASDI Trustees Report Conclusions |publisher= [[Social Security Administration]] |date= April 23, 2007 |access-date= May 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Social Security Administration projects that the demographic situation will stabilize. The cash flow deficit in the Social Security system will have leveled off as a share of the economy. This projection has come into question. Some demographers argue that life expectancy will improve more than projected by the Social Security Trustees, a development that would make solvency worse. Some economists believe future productivity growth will be higher than the current projections by the Social Security Trustees. In this case, the Social Security shortfall would be smaller than currently projected.

Tables published by the government's National Center for Health Statistics show that life expectancy at birth was 47.3 years in 1900, rose to 68.2 by 1950 and reached 77.3 in 2002. The latest annual report of the Social Security Agency (SSA) trustees projects that life expectancy will increase just six years in the next seven decades, to 83 in 2075. A separate set of projections, by the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]], shows more rapid growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.heraldtribune.com.665&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Security Underestimates Future Life Spans, Critics Say |url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20041231/ZNYT02/412310311 |access-date=December 3, 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126182127/http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20041231%2FZNYT02%2F412310311 |archive-date=November 26, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Census Bureau projection is that the longer life spans projected for 2075 by the Social Security Administration will be reached in 2050. Other experts, however, think that the past gains in life expectancy cannot be repeated, and add that the adverse effect on the system's finances may be partly offset if health improvements or reduced retirement benefits induce people to stay in the workforce longer.

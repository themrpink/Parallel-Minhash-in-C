Ancient authors and modern scholars alike disagree about the ethnic identity of the ancient Macedonians. [[Ernst Badian]] notes that nearly all surviving references to antagonisms and differences between Greeks and Macedonians exist in the written speeches of [[Arrian]], who lived at the time of the [[Roman Empire]], when any notion of an ethnic disparity between Macedonians and other Greeks was incomprehensible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Badian|1982|p=51, n. 72}}; Johannes Engels comes to a similar conclusion. See: {{harvnb|Engels|2010|p=82}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hatzopoulos argues that there was no real ethnic difference between Macedonians and Greeks, only a political distinction contrived after the creation of the [[League of Corinth]] in 337{{nbsp}}BC (which was led by Macedonia through the league's elected ''[[hegemon]]'' Philip{{nbsp}}II, when he was not a member of the league itself),&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hatzopoulos|2011b|pp=69–71}}. &lt;br&gt;Hatzopoulos stresses the fact that Macedonians and other peoples such as the [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirotes]] and [[History of Cyprus|Cypriots]], despite speaking a Greek dialect, worshiping in Greek cults, engaging in Panhellenic games, and upholding traditional Greek institutions, nevertheless occasionally had their territories excluded from contemporary geographic definitions of &quot;[[Greece|Hellas]]&quot; and were even considered barbarians by some. See: {{harvnb|Hatzopoulos|2011b|pp=52, 71–72}}; Johannes Engels comes to a similar conclusion about the comparison between Macedonians and [[Epirotes]], saying that the &quot;Greekness&quot; of the Epirotes, despite them not being considered as refined as southern Greeks, never came into question. Engels suggests this perhaps because the Epirotes did not try to dominate the Greek world as [[Philip II of Macedon]] had done. See: {{harvnb|Engels|2010|pp=83–84}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[N. G. L. Hammond]] asserts that ancient views differentiating Macedonia's ethnic identity from the rest of the Greek-speaking world should be seen as an expression of conflict between two different political systems: the democratic system of the city-states (e.g. Athens) versus the monarchy (Macedonia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hammond|first1=N.G.L.|title=The Genius of Alexander the Great|date=1997|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|isbn=0807823503|page=[https://archive.org/details/geniusofalexande00nglh/page/11 11]|quote=The other part of the Greek-speaking world extended from Pelagonia in the north to Macedonia in the south. It was occupied by several tribal states, which were constantly at war against Illyrians, Paeonians and Thracians. Each state had its own monarchy. Special prestige attached to the Lyncestae whose royal family, the Bacchiadae claimed descent from Heracles, and to the Macedonians, whose royal family had a similar ancestry. [...] In the opinion of the city-states these tribal states were backward and unworthy of the Greek name, although they spoke dialects of the Greek language. According to Aristotle, monarchy was the mark of people too stupid to govern themselves.|url=https://archive.org/details/geniusofalexande00nglh/page/11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other academics who concur that the difference between the Macedonians and Greeks was a political rather than a true ethnic discrepancy include Michael B. Sakellariou,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sakellariou|1983|pp=52}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm Errington,&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Errington|1990|pp=3–4}}. &lt;br&gt;{{harvnb|Errington|1994|p=4}}: &quot;Ancient allegations that the Macedonians were non-Greek all had their origin in Athens at the time of the struggle with Philip{{nbsp}}II. Then as now, political struggle created the prejudice. The orator [[Aeschines]] once even found it necessary, to counteract the prejudice vigorously fomented by his opponents, to defend Philip on this issue and describe him at a meeting of the Athenian Popular Assembly as being 'entirely Greek'. [[Demosthenes]]' allegations were lent an appearance of credibility by the fact, apparent to every observer, that the life-style of the Macedonians, being determined by specific geographical and historical conditions, was different to that of a Greek city-state. This alien way of life was, however, common to western Greeks of Epirus, Akarnania and Aitolia, as well as to the Macedonians, and their fundamental Greek nationality was never doubted. Only as a consequence of the political disagreement with Macedonia was the issue raised at all.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and Craige B. Champion.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Champion|2004|p=41}}: &quot;[[Demosthenes]] could drop the barbarian category altogether in advocating an Athenian alliance with the Great King against a power that ranked below any so-called barbarian people, the Macedonians. In the case of [[Aeschines]], Philip{{nbsp}}II could be 'a barbarian due for the vengeance of God', but after the orator's embassy to Pella in 346, he became a 'thorough Greek', devoted to Athens. It all depended upon one's immediate political orientation with Macedonia, which many Greeks instinctively scorned, was always infused with deep-seated ambivalence.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Anson argues that some Hellenic authors expressed complex or even ever-changing and ambiguous ideas about the exact ethnic identity of the Macedonians, who were considered by some such as [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' as barbarians and others as semi-Greek or fully Greek.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Anson|2010|pp=14–17}}; this was manifested in the different [[Family tree of the Greek gods|mythological genealogies]] concocted for the Macedonian people, with [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Catalogue of Women]]'' claiming that the Macedonians descended from [[Makedon (mythology)|Macedon]], son of [[Zeus]] and [[Thyia]], and was therefore a nephew of [[Hellen]], progenitor of the Greeks. See: {{harvnb|Anson|2010|p=16}}; {{harvnb|Rhodes|2010|p=24}}. &lt;br&gt;By the end of the 5th century BC, [[Hellanicus of Lesbos]] asserted Macedon was the son of [[Aeolus]], the latter a son of Hellen and ancestor of the [[Aeolians]], one of the major [[tribe]]s of the Greeks. As well as belonging to tribal groups such as the Aeolians, [[Dorians]], [[Achaeans (tribe)|Achaeans]], and [[Ionians]], Anson also stresses the fact that some Greeks even distinguished their ethnic identities based on the ''[[polis]]'' (i.e. city-state) they originally came from. See: {{harvnb|Anson|2010|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Roger D. Woodard asserts that in addition to persisting uncertainty in modern times about the proper classification of the Macedonian language and its relation to Greek, ancient authors also presented conflicting ideas about the Macedonians.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;For instance, [[Demosthenes]] when labeling Philip{{nbsp}}II of Macedon as a barbarian whereas [[Polybius]] called Greeks and Macedonians as ''homophylos'' (i.e. part of the same race or [[Kinship|kin]]). See: {{harvnb|Woodard|2010|pp=9–10}}; Johannes Engels also discusses this ambiguity in ancient sources: {{harvnb|Engels|2010|pp=83–89}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon Hornblower]] argues on the Greek identity of the Macedonians, taking into consideration their origin, language, cults and customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Simon Hornblower|editor1-last=Zacharia|editor1-first=Katerina|title=Hellenisms: Culture, Identity, and Ethnicity from Antiquity to Modernity|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0754665250|page=58|chapter=2: Greek Identity in the Archaic and Classical Periods|quote=The question &quot;Were the Macedonians Greeks?&quot; perhaps needs to be chopped up further. The Macedonian kings emerge as Greeks by criterion one, namely shared blood, and personal names indicate that Macedonians generally moved north from Greece.

Macedonian customs (criterion four) were in certain respects unlike those of a normal apart, perhaps, from the institutions which I have characterized as feudal. The crude one-word answer to the question has to be &quot;yes.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any preconceived ethnic differences between Greeks and Macedonians faded by 148{{nbsp}}BC soon after the [[Macedonian Wars|Roman conquest of Macedonia]] and then [[Macedonia (Roman province)|the rest of Greece]] with the defeat of the [[Achaean League]] by the [[Roman Republic]] at the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hatzopoulos|2011b|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, following his victory at the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)]], Philip{{nbsp}}II raised a round memorial building at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] known as the [[Philippeion]], decorated inside with statues depicting him, his parents [[Amyntas III of Macedon]] and [[Eurydice I of Macedon]], his wife [[Olympias]], and his son Alexander the Great.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Errington|1990|p=227}}; see also {{harvnb|Hammond|Walbank|2001|pp=3, 7–8}} for further details.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military technology and engineering===
{{further|Greek and Roman artillery|Ancient Greek warfare|Lithobolos|Siege ladder}}

By the Hellenistic period, it became common for Greek states to finance the development and proliferation of ever more powerful [[torsion siege engine]]s, [[Naval warfare|naval ships]], and standardized designs for [[Ancient Greek military personal equipment|arms and armor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Treister|1996|pp=375–376}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Philip{{nbsp}}II and Alexander the Great, improvements were made to [[siege artillery]] such as bolt-shooting [[ballista]]e and [[siege engine]]s such as huge rolling [[siege tower]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Humphrey|Oleson|Sherwood|1998|p=570}}.&lt;/ref&gt; E.{{nbsp}}W.{{nbsp}}Marsden and M.{{nbsp}}Y.{{nbsp}}Treister contend that the Macedonian rulers [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus]] and his successor [[Demetrius I of Macedon]] had the most powerful siege artillery of the Hellenistic world at the end of the 4th{{nbsp}}century{{nbsp}}BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Treister|1996|p=376, no. 531}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Battle of Salamis (306 BC)|The siege]] of [[Salamis, Cyprus]], in 306{{nbsp}}BC necessitated the building of large siege engines and drafting of craftsmen from parts of [[West Asia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;treister 1996 376&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Treister|1996|p=376}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The siege tower commissioned by Demetrius{{nbsp}}I for the Macedonian [[Siege of Rhodes (305–304 BC)]] and manned by over three thousand soldiers was built at a height of nine [[Storey|stories]].&lt;ref name=&quot;humphrey 1998 pp570 571&quot;/&gt; It had a base of {{convert|4300|sqft|0|abbr=off}}, eight wheels that were steered in either direction by pivots, three sides covered in iron plates to protect them from fire, and mechanically opened windows (shielded with wool-stuffed leather curtains to soften the blow of ballistae rounds) of different sizes to accommodate the firing of missiles ranging from arrows to larger bolts.&lt;ref name=&quot;humphrey 1998 pp570 571&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Humphrey|Oleson|Sherwood|1998|pp=570–571}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the siege of [[Echinus (Phthiotis)|Echinus]] by [[Philip V of Macedon]] in 211{{nbsp}}BC, the besiegers built [[Mining (military)|tunnels]] to protect the soldiers and [[sapper]]s as they went back and forth from the camp to the siege works. These included two siege towers connected by a makeshift [[wickerwork]] [[curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]] mounted with stone-shooting ballistae, and sheds to protect the approach of the [[battering ram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Humphrey|Oleson|Sherwood|1998|pp=570–572}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the early reputation of Macedon as a leader in siege technology, [[Alexandria]] in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] became the center for technological improvements to the [[catapult]] by the 3rd{{nbsp}}century{{nbsp}}BC, as evidenced by the writings of [[Philo of Alexandria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;treister 1996 376&quot;/&gt;

===Other innovations===
{{further|Ancient Macedonian calendar}}
Although perhaps not as prolific as other areas of Greece in regards to technological innovations, there are some inventions that may have originated in Macedonia aside from siege engines and artillery. The [[Rotation around a fixed axis|rotary-operated]] [[olive press]] for producing [[olive oil]] may have been invented in ancient Macedonia or another part of Greece, or even as far east as the [[Levant]] or [[Anatolia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curtis|2008|p=380}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[History of glass|Mold-pressed glass]] first appeared in Macedonia in the 4th{{nbsp}}century{{nbsp}}BC (although it could have simultaneously existed in the [[Achaemenid Empire]]); the first known clear, translucent glass pieces of the Greek world have been discovered in Macedonia and [[Rhodes]] and date to the second half of the 4th{{nbsp}}century{{nbsp}}BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stern|2008|pp=530–532}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek technical and [[scientific literature]] began with [[Classical Athens]] in the 5th{{nbsp}}century{{nbsp}}BC, while the major production centers for technical innovation and texts during the Hellenistic period were [[Library of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Rhodian school|Rhodes]], and [[Pergamon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cuomo|2008|pp=17–20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Government of Macedonia (ancient kingdom)}}
{{further|Ancient Greek coinage|Economy of ancient Greece}}
[[File:Mints of Alexander the Great 1.jpg|thumb|[[Tetradrachm]]s (above) and [[drachm]]s (below) issued during the reign of [[Alexander the Great]], now in the [[Numismatic Museum of Athens]]]]
The [[Mint (facility)|minting]] of silver coinage began during the reign of [[Alexander I of Macedon|Alexander{{nbsp}}I]] as a means to pay for royal expenditures.&lt;ref name=&quot;errington 1990 222&quot;/&gt; [[Archelaus I of Macedon|Archelaus{{nbsp}}I]] increased the silver content of his coins as well as minting copper coins to promote foreign and domestic commerce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 156 157&quot;/&gt; The minting of coinage significantly increased during the reigns of Philip{{nbsp}}II and Alexander the Great, especially after the increase in state revenues following the seizure of the [[Pangaion Hills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Errington|1990|pp=246}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Hellenistic period the royal houses of Macedonia, [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], and the [[Kingdom of Pergamon]] exercised [[State monopoly|full monopolistic control]] over [[mining]] activities, largely to ensure the funding of their armies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Treister|1996|p=379}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the [[conquests of Alexander the Great]], nearly thirty mints stretching from Macedonia to [[Babylon]] produced standard coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meadows|2008|p=773}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The right to mint coins was shared by [[Central government|central]] and some [[local government]]s, i.e. the [[autonomous]] [[municipal government]]s of Thessaloniki, Pella, and Amphipolis within the Macedonian [[commonwealth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hatzopoulos|1996|pp=432–433}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Macedonians were also the first to issue different coins for [[Circulation (currency)|internal and external circulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kremydi|2011|pp=163}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

State revenues were also raised by collecting [[produce]] from [[arable land]]s, timber from forests, and [[Tax#History|taxes]] on [[import]]s and [[export]]s at [[harbor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hatzopoulos|1996|p=433}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some mines, [[Grove (nature)|groves]], [[History of agriculture|agricultural lands]], and [[Logging|forests]] belonging to the Macedonian state were exploited by the Macedonian king, although these were often [[lease]]d as [[asset]]s or given as [[Grant (money)|grants]] to members of the [[nobility]] such as the ''[[hetairoi]]'' and ''[[philoi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hatzopoulos|1996|p=434}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tariff]]s exacted on goods flowing in and out of Macedonian [[seaport]]s existed from at least the reign of [[Amyntas III of Macedon|Amyntas{{nbsp}}III]], and [[Callistratus of Aphidnae]] (d.{{nbsp}}c.{{nbsp}}350{{nbsp}}BC) aided [[Perdiccas III of Macedon|Perdiccas{{nbsp}}III]] in doubling the kingdom's annual profits on [[customs duties]] from 20 to 40 [[Talent (measurement)|talents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hatzopoulos|1996|pp=433–434}}; {{harvnb|Roisman|2010|p=163}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the defeat of [[Perseus of Macedon|Perseus]] at [[Battle of Pydna|Pydna]] in 168{{nbsp}}BC, the [[Roman Senate]] allowed the reopening of iron and copper mines, but forbade the mining of gold and silver by the four newly established autonomous [[client state]]s that replaced the monarchy in Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Treister|1996|pp=373–375}}; see also {{harvnb|Errington|1990|p=223}} for further details.&lt;/ref&gt; The law may originally have been conceived by the Senate due to the fear that material wealth gained from gold and silver mining operations would allow the Macedonians to fund an armed rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Treister|1996|pp=374–375}}; see also {{harvnb|Errington|1990|p=223}} for further details.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans were perhaps also concerned with stemming [[inflation]] caused by an increased [[money supply]] from Macedonian silver mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Treister|1996|p=374}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Macedonians continued minting silver coins between 167 and 148{{nbsp}}BC (i.e. just before the establishment of the [[Roman province of Macedonia]]), and when the Romans lifted the ban on Macedonian silver mining in 158{{nbsp}}BC it may simply have reflected the local reality of this illicit practice continuing regardless of the Senate's decree.&lt;ref name=&quot;treister 1996 374 375&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Treister|1996|pp=374–375}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
{{further|Hellenic studies|Hellenistic religion|Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenism (neoclassicism)}}
The reigns of Philip II and Alexander the Great witnessed the demise of Classical Greece and the birth of Hellenistic civilization, following the [[Hellenization|spread of Greek culture]] to the [[Near East]] during and after Alexander's conquests.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anson|2010|pp=3–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonians then migrated to Egypt and parts of Asia, but the intensive [[colonization]] of foreign lands sapped the available manpower in Macedonia proper, weakening the kingdom in its fight with other Hellenistic powers and contributing to its downfall and conquest by the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anson|2010|pp=4–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the diffusion of Greek culture and language cemented by Alexander's conquests in West Asia and North Africa served as a &quot;precondition&quot; for the [[Mithridatic Wars|later Roman expansion]] into these territories and [[Byzantine Greeks|entire basis]] for the [[Byzantine Empire]], according to Errington.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Errington|1990|p=249}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battle of Issos MAN Napoli Inv10020 n01.jpg|thumb|400px|left|The ''[[Alexander Mosaic]]'', a [[Roman mosaic]] from [[Pompeii]], Italy, c. 100 BC]]
The ethnic Macedonian rulers of the Ptolemaic and Seleucid successor states accepted men from all over the Greek world as their ''hetairoi'' companions and did not foster a national identity like the Antigonids.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Asirvatham|2010|p=104}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholarship has focused on how these Hellenistic successor kingdoms were influenced more by their Macedonian origins than Eastern or southern Greek traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anson|2010|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Spartan Constitution|Spartan society]] remained mostly insular and Athens continued placing [[Solonian Constitution|strict limitations on acquiring citizenship]], the [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] Hellenistic cities of Asia and northeastern Africa bore a greater resemblance to Macedonian cities and contained a mixture of subjects including natives, Greek and Macedonian colonists, and Greek-speaking Hellenized Easterners, many of whom were the product of intermarriage between Greeks and native populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anson|2010|pp=11–12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[deification]] of Macedonian monarchs perhaps began with the death of Philip{{nbsp}}II, but it was his son Alexander the Great who unambiguously claimed to be a [[Imperial cult|living god]].&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Worthington|2012|p=319}}. &lt;br&gt;As [[pharaoh]] of the Egyptians, he was already titled [[Ra|Son of Ra]] and considered the living incarnation of [[Horus]] by his Egyptian subjects (a belief that the [[Ptolemaic kingdom|Ptolemaic successors]] of Alexander would foster for [[Ptolemaic dynasty|their own dynasty in Egypt]]). See: {{harvnb|Worthington|2014|p=180}} and {{harvnb|Sansone|2017|p=228}} for details.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his visit to the [[oracle]] of [[Didyma]] in 334{{nbsp}}BC that suggested his divinity, Alexander traveled to the [[Oracle of Ammon|Oracle]] of [[Zeus Ammon]]—the [[Interpretatio graeca|Greek equivalent]] of the Egyptian [[Amun-Ra]]—at the [[Siwa Oasis]] of the [[Libyan Desert]] in 332{{nbsp}}BC to confirm his [[Sacred king|divine status]].&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Worthington|2012|p=319}}; {{harvnb|Worthington|2014|pp=180–183}}. &lt;br&gt;After the priest and [[Oracle of Ammon|Oracle]] of [[Zeus Ammon]] at the [[Siwa Oasis]] convinced him that Philip{{nbsp}}II was merely his mortal father and Zeus his actual father, Alexander began styling himself as the 'Son of Zeus', which brought him into contention with some of his Greek subjects who adamantly believed that living men could not be immortals. See {{harvnb|Worthington|2012|p=319}} and {{harvnb|Worthington|2014|pp=182–183}} for details.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires [[Ptolemaic cult of Alexander the Great|maintained ancestral cults]] and deified their rulers, kings were not worshiped in the Kingdom of Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Errington|1990|pp=219–220}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While Zeus Ammon was known to the Greeks prior to Alexander's reign, particularly at the [[Colonies in antiquity|Greek colony]] of [[Cyrene, Libya]], Alexander was the first Macedonian monarch to patronize [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]], [[Persian mythology|Persian]], and [[Babylonian religion|Babylonian priesthoods and deities]], strengthening the fusion of [[Ancient Mesopotamian religion|Near Eastern]] and Greek religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Christesen|Murray|2010|pp=435–436}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After his reign, the [[Mysteries of Isis|cult of Isis]] gradually spread throughout the Hellenistic and [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman world]], while beliefs in the Egyptian god [[Sarapis]] were thoroughly Hellenized by the Ptolemaic rulers of Egypt before the spread of his cult to Macedonia and the Aegean region.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Christesen|Murray|2010|p=436}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The German historian [[Johann Gustav Droysen]] argued that the conquests of Alexander the Great and creation of the Hellenistic world allowed for the growth and [[History of Christianity|establishment of Christianity]] in the Roman era.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anson|2010|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three [[submarine]]s of the [[United States Navy]] have borne the name '''USS ''Skate''''', named for a type of [[batoidea|ray]].

*The first [[USS F-4 (SS-23)|USS ''Skate'' (SS-23)]] was a {{sclass2-|United States F|submarine|2}} that sank in March 1915 off [[Pearl Harbor]].
*The second {{USS|Skate|SS-305}} was a {{Sclass-|Balao|submarine|2}} that saw action in [[World War II]].
*The third {{USS|Skate|SSN-578}}, the [[lead ship]] of [[Skate-class submarine|her class]] of nuclear attack submarines, saw action during the [[Cold War]].

'''''Orientalium Ecclesiarum''''' is the [[Second Vatican Council]]'s '''Decree on the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]'''. One of the shortest conciliar documents, it was approved by a vote of 2,110 to 39 and promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on November 21, 1964. &quot;Orientalium Ecclesiarum&quot; is [[Latin]] for &quot;of [the] Eastern Churches,&quot; and is taken from the first line of the decree, as is customary with [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] official documents. The decree recognizes the right of [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholics]] to keep their own distinct liturgical practices while remaining in full communion with the [[Holy See]]. The decree exhorts Eastern Catholics to &quot;take steps to return to their ancestral traditions.&quot; This aspect of the decree was directed against [[Liturgical latinisation|Latinisation]].&lt;ref&gt;Parry (1999), pp. 357-58&lt;/ref&gt;

The document specifies some of the autonomous powers of the Eastern Churches. In particular, the [[Patriarch]] (or where applicable, [[major archbishop]]) and [[synod]] have the power to establish [[eparchy|eparchies]], to nominate bishops within their patriarchate, to legislate the rights and obligations of the [[minor orders]] (including [[subdeacon|subdiaconate]]), and to determine the date for celebrating Easter within their rite. It furthermore recognized the ancient practice in the East regarding the [[sacrament]] of [[confirmation]] ([[Chrismation]]), stating that all Eastern priests have the power to administer this sacrament using [[chrism]] blessed by a bishop. One of the implications of this is the further practice of infant communion was formally recognized.

A '''synthetic radioisotope''' is a [[radionuclide]] that is not found in nature: no natural process or mechanism exists which produces it, or it is so unstable that it decays away in a very short period of time. Examples include [[technetium]]-95 and [[promethium]]-146. Many of these are found in, and harvested from, [[spent nuclear fuel]] assemblies. Some must be manufactured in [[particle accelerator]]s.

==Production==
Some synthetic radioisotopes are extracted from spent [[nuclear reactor]] fuel rods, which contain various [[fission products]]. For example, it is estimated that up to 1994, about 49,000 [[Becquerel|terabecquerels ]] (78 [[tonne|metric ton]]) of [[technetium]] was produced in nuclear reactors, which is by far the dominant source of terrestrial technetium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yoshihara|first1=K|editor1-last=Yoshihara|editor1-first=K|editor2-last=Omori|editor2-first=T|title=Technetium and Rhenium Their Chemistry and Its Applications|date=1996|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-59469-7|chapter=Technetium in the environment|series=Topics in Current Chemistry|volume=176|doi=10.1007/3-540-59469-8_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some synthetic isotopes are produced in significant quantities by fission but are not yet being reclaimed.  Other isotopes are manufactured by [[neutron]] irradiation of parent isotopes in a nuclear reactor (for example, Tc-97 can be made by neutron irradiation of Ru-96) or by bombarding parent isotopes with high energy particles from a particle accelerator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radioisotope Production|url=http://www.bnl.gov/medical/Isotope_Distribution/Isodistoff.htm|publisher=Brookhaven National Laboratory|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106040156/http://www.bnl.gov/medical/Isotope_Distribution/Isodistoff.htm|archivedate=6 January 2010|date=2009|url-status=bot: unknown}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Manual for reactor produced radioisotopes.|date=2003|publisher=IAEA|location=Vienna|isbn=92-0-101103-2|url=https://www-pub.iaea.org/books/IAEABooks/6407/Manual-for-Reactor-Produced-Radioisotopes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

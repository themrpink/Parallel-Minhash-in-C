The Akimel O'odham were the major group in the area. They lived in small villages with well-defined irrigation systems that spread over the Gila River Valley, from Florence in the east to the Estrellas in the west.

The [[Mexican–American War]] ended in 1848, Mexico ceded its northern zone to the United States, and the region's residents became U.S. citizens.

===Founding and incorporation===
[[File:Phoenix-Duppa-Montgomery Adobe-1895-2.JPG|right|thumb|The Phillip Darrell Duppa adobe house was built in 1870 and is the oldest house in Phoenix. The homestead is named after &quot;Lord&quot; Darrell Duppa, an Englishman who is credited with naming Phoenix and Tempe as well as founding the town of New River.]]

The history of the city of Phoenix begins with [[Jack Swilling]], a Confederate veteran of the Civil War who prospected in the nearby mining town of [[Wickenburg]] in the newly formed [[Arizona Territory]]. He was traveling through the [[Salt River Valley]] in 1867 and saw a potential for farming to supply Wickenburg with food. He also noted the eroded mounds of dirt that indicated previous canals dug by native peoples who had long since left the area. He formed the Swilling Irrigation and Canal Company that year, dug a large canal that drew in river water, and erected several crop fields in a location that is now within the eastern portion of central Phoenix near its airport. Soon, other settlers began to arrive, appreciating the area's fertile soil and lack of frost, and the farmhouse that Swilling constructed became a frequently-visited location in the valley.&lt;ref&gt;https://glorecords.blm.gov/details/survey/default.aspx?dm_id=107721&amp;sid=xzdik1aw.jli#surveyDetailsTabIndex=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://wateruseitwisely.com/arizona-water-pioneers-jack-swilling/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phillip Darrell Duppa|Lord Darrell Duppa]] was one of the original settlers in Swilling's party, and he suggested the name &quot;Phoenix&quot;, as it described a city born from the ruins of a former civilization.&lt;ref name=Phxgov /&gt;

The Board of Supervisors in Yavapai County officially recognized the new town on May 4, 1868, and the first post office was established the following month with Swilling as the postmaster.&lt;ref name=Phxgov /&gt; In October 1870, a meeting of valley residents was held to select a new townsite for the valley's growing population. A new location three miles to the west of the original settlement, containing several allotments of farmland, was chosen, and lots began to officially be sold under the name of Phoenix in December of that year. This established the downtown core in a grid layout pattern that has been the hallmark of Phoenix's urban development ever since.

On February 12, 1871, the territorial legislature created Maricopa County by dividing Yavapai County; it was the sixth one formed in the Arizona Territory. The first election for county office was held in 1871 when Tom Barnum was elected the first sheriff. He ran unopposed when the other two candidates (John A. Chenowth and Jim Favorite) fought a duel; Chenowth killed Favorite and was forced to withdraw from the race.&lt;ref name=Phxgov /&gt;

The town grew during the 1870s, and President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] issued a land patent for the site of Phoenix on April 10, 1874. By 1875, the town had a telegraph office, 16 saloons, and four dance halls, but the townsite-commissioner form of government needed an overhaul. An election was held in 1875, and three village trustees and other officials were elected.&lt;ref name=Phxgov /&gt; By 1880, the town's population stood at 2,453.&lt;ref name=Moffat&gt;{{cite book |last=Moffatt |first=Riley |title=Population History of Western U.S. Cities &amp; Towns, 1850–1990 |publisher=Scarecrow |place=Lanham, MD |year=1996 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Phoenix1885-AerialMap HiRes.jpg|alt=Refer to caption|thumb|right|Aerial lithograph of Phoenix from 1885]]
By 1881, Phoenix's continued growth made the board of trustees obsolete. The Territorial Legislature passed the Phoenix Charter Bill, incorporating Phoenix and providing a mayor-council government; Governor [[John C. Fremont]] signed the bill on February 25, 1881, officially incorporating Phoenix as a city with a population of around 2,500.&lt;ref name=Phxgov /&gt;

The railroad's arrival in the valley in the 1880s was the first of several events that made Phoenix a trade center whose products reached eastern and western markets. In response, the [[Greater Phoenix Chamber of Commerce|Phoenix Chamber of Commerce]] was organized on November 4, 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phoenixchamber.com/about/history |title=History |publisher=Greater Phoenix Chamber of Commerce |access-date=October 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city offices moved into the new City Hall at Washington and Central in 1888.&lt;ref name=Phxgov /&gt; The territorial capital was moved from Prescott to Phoenix in 1889, and the territorial offices were also in City Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Early Phoenix | editor=Kathleen Garcia | page=18| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F25aMroD_IUC&amp;pg=PA18| publisher=Arcadia Publishing | year=2008 | isbn=978-0738548395 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the arrival of the [[Santa Fe, Prescott and Phoenix Railroad]] in 1895, Phoenix was connected to Prescott, Flagstaff, and other communities in the northern part of the territory. The increased access to commerce expedited the city's economic rise. The [[Phoenix Union High School]] was established in 1895 with an enrollment of 90.&lt;ref name=Phxgov /&gt;

During World War II, Phoenix's economy shifted to that of a distribution center, transforming into an &quot;embryonic industrial city&quot; with the mass production of military supplies.&lt;ref name=Phxgov/&gt; There were three air force fields in the area: [[Luke Air Force Base|Luke Field]], [[Williams Air Force Base|Williams Field]], and [[Falcon Field (Arizona)|Falcon Field]], as well as two large pilot training camps, [[Thunderbird Field No. 1]] in Glendale and [[Scottsdale Airport|Thunderbird Field No. 2]] in Scottsdale.&lt;ref name=Phxgov /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/airport/history.asp |title=Scottsdale Airport History |publisher=scottsdaleaz.gov |access-date=February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Manning |first=Thomas A. |year=2005 |title=History of Air Education and Training Command, 1942–2002 |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofaireduc00gop |publisher=Office of History and Research, Headquarters, AETC |place=Randolph AFB, Texas |isbn=978-1-178-48983-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-World War II explosive growth===
A town that had just over 65,000 residents in 1940 became America's sixth largest city by 2010, with a population of nearly 1.5&amp;nbsp;million, and millions more in nearby suburbs. When the war ended, many of the men who had undergone their training in Arizona returned, bringing their new families. Learning of this large untapped labor pool enticed many large industries to move their operations to the area.&lt;ref name=Phxgov /&gt; In 1948 high-tech industry, which would become a staple of the state's economy, arrived in Phoenix when [[Motorola]] chose Phoenix as the site of its new research and development center for military electronics.

By 1950, over 105,000 people resided in the city and thousands more in surrounding communities.&lt;ref name=Phxgov /&gt; The 1950s growth was spurred on by advances in air conditioning, which allowed both homes and businesses to offset the extreme heat experienced in Phoenix and the surrounding areas during its long summers. There was more new construction in Phoenix in 1959 alone than from 1914 to 1946.&lt;ref name=AZed&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arizonaedventures.com/reference-guide/arizona-history-timeline/20th-century/ |title=20th Century |publisher=Arizona Edventures |access-date=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many emerging American cities at the time, Phoenix's spectacular growth did not occur evenly. It largely took place on the city's north side, a region that was nearly all Caucasian. In 1962, one local activist testified at a [[United States Commission on Civil Rights|US Commission on Civil Rights]] hearing that of 31,000 homes that had recently sprung up in this neighborhood, not a single one had been sold to an African-American.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Power Lines: Phoenix and the Making of the Modern Southwest|last = Needham|first = Andrew|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 2014|location = Princeton, NJ|pages = 84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phoenix's African-American and Mexican-American communities remained largely sequestered on the south side of town. The color lines were so rigid that no one north of [[Van Buren Street (Arizona)|Van Buren Street]] would rent to the African-American baseball star [[Willie Mays]], in town for spring training in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Power Lines: Phoenix and the Making of the Modern Southwest|last = Needham|first = Andrew|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 2014|location = Princeton, NJ|pages = 86}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, a reporter from ''[[The New Republic]]'' wrote of segregation in these terms: &quot;Apartheid is complete.

In the 1970s the downtown area experienced a resurgence, with a level of construction activity not seen again until the urban real estate boom of the 2000s. By the end of the decade, Phoenix adopted the Phoenix Concept 2000 plan which split the city into urban villages, each with its own village core where greater height and density was permitted, further shaping the free-market development culture. The nine original villages {{sfn|Luckingham|1989|pp=235–237}} have expanded to 15 over the years (see [[Phoenix, Arizona#Cityscape|Cityscape]] below). This officially turned Phoenix into a city of many nodes, which would later be connected by freeways. The [[Phoenix Symphony Hall]] opened in 1972;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.azcentral.com/thingstodo/arts/phxsymphonyhall.html |newspaper=Arizona Republic |title=Valley Arts Guide |access-date=March 19, 2016 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515180922/http://www.azcentral.com/thingstodo/arts/phxsymphonyhall.html |archive-date=May 15, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; other major structures which saw construction downtown during this decade were the [[Wells Fargo Plaza (Phoenix)|First National Bank Plaza]], the [[Chase Tower (Phoenix)|Valley Center]] (the tallest building in the state of Arizona),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emporis.com/building/chasetower-phoenix-az-usa |title=Chase Tower |publisher=Emporis |access-date=February 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[U.S. Bank Center (Phoenix)|Arizona Bank building]].&lt;!--These were the names of the buildings at the times they were built.

On September 25, 1981, Phoenix resident [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] broke the gender barrier on the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], when she was sworn in as the first female justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historycentral.com/Today/SandraDayO'Connor.html |title=First Woman to Supreme Court |publisher=History Central |access-date=February 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, the [[Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station]], the nation's largest nuclear power plant, began electrical production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azcentral.com/centennial/news/articles/2011/03/11/20110311arizona-centennial-1980s.html?page=5 |title=Arizona Centennial |publisher=The Arizona Republic/AZCentral.com |access-date=February 27, 2014 |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope John Paul II]] and [[Mother Teresa]] both visited the Valley in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azcentral.com/centennial/news/articles/2011/03/11/20110311arizona-centennial-1980s.html?page=7 |title=Arizona Centennial |publisher=The Arizona Republic/AZCentral.com |access-date=February 27, 2014 |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was an influx of refugees due to low-cost housing in the [[Sunnyslope, Arizona|Sunnyslope]] area in the 1990s, resulting in 43 different languages being spoken in local schools by the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jcl.com/about/timeline/1990s |title=John C.

Phoenix has maintained a growth streak in recent years, growing by 24.2% before 2007. This made it the second-fastest-growing metropolitan area in the United States, surpassed only by [[Las Vegas–Paradise, NV MSA|Las Vegas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/10/31/property-cities-growth-forbeslife-cx_mw_1031realestate_slide_3.html?thisSpeed=15000 |title=In Pictures: America's Fastest-Growing Cities from |work=Forbes |date=October 31, 2007 |access-date=June 30, 2010 |first=Matt |last=Woolsey}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Squaw Peak, the city's second tallest mountain, was renamed [[Piestewa Peak]] after Army Specialist [[Lori Ann Piestewa]], an Arizonan and the first [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] woman to die in combat while serving in the U.S. military, as well as being the first American female casualty of the [[Iraq War|2003 Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-04-10-2715750201_x.htm |title=Feds OK naming Phoenix peak for soldier |newspaper=USA Today |last=Myers |first=Amanda Lee |date=April 10, 2008 |access-date=February 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2008 also saw Phoenix as one of the cities hardest hit by the [[subprime mortgage crisis]], and by early 2009 the median home price was $150,000, down from its $262,000 peak in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/17/obama.foreclosures/ |publisher=CNN |title=Obama expected to announce foreclosure plan |date=February 17, 2009 |first1=Mary |last1=Snow |first2=Jim |last2=Acosta |access-date=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crime rates in Phoenix have fallen in recent years, and once troubled, decaying neighborhoods such as [[South Phoenix|South Mountain]], [[Alhambra, Phoenix, Arizona|Alhambra]], and [[West Phoenix|Maryvale]] have recovered and stabilized. Recently, downtown Phoenix and the central core have experienced renewed interest and growth, resulting in many restaurants, stores, and businesses opening or relocating to central Phoenix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Nora Burba |last=Trulsson |title=Phoenix Rising |journal=Sunset |date=March 2005 |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Phoenix by Sentinel-2, 2020-09-09.jpg|alt=A photo taken from space of the Phoenix Area|left|thumb|Sentinel-2 satellite image of the Phoenix metro area in 2020]]
Phoenix is in the southwestern United States, in the south-central portion of Arizona; about halfway between [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] to the southeast and [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] to the north. By car, the city is approximately {{convert|150|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} north of the US-Mexico border at [[Sonoyta]] and {{convert|180|mi|abbr=on}} north of the border at [[Nogales, Arizona|Nogales]]. The metropolitan area is known as the &quot;Valley of the Sun&quot; due to its location in the Salt River Valley.&lt;ref name=Valley101 /&gt; It lies at a mean elevation of 1,086 feet (331&amp;nbsp;m), in the northern reaches of the [[Sonoran Desert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geonames.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=136:3:0::NO:3:P3_FID,P3_TITLE:44784,Phoenix |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |title=Feature Detail Report for: Phoenix |access-date=March 19, 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6g8o6H2WH?url=http://geonames.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=136:3:0::NO:3:P3_FID,P3_TITLE:44784,Phoenix |archive-date=March 20, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than the mountains in and around the city, Phoenix's topography is generally flat, which allows the city's main streets to run on a precise grid with wide, open-spaced roadways. Scattered, low mountain ranges surround the valley: [[McDowell Mountains]] to the northeast, the [[White Tank Mountains]] to the west, the [[Superstition Mountains]] far to the east, and both [[South Mountains (Arizona)|South Mountain]] and the [[Sierra Estrella]] to the south/southwest. [[Camelback Mountain]], North Mountain, [[Sunnyslope Mountain]], and [[Piestewa Peak]] are within the heart of the valley. The city's outskirts have large fields of irrigated cropland and Native American reservation lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.summitpost.org/phoenix-mountains-and-neighboring-ranges/285171 |title=Phoenix Mountain Overview |publisher=summitpost.org |access-date=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Salt River runs westward through Phoenix, but the riverbed is often dry or contains little water due to large irrigation diversions. South Mountain separates the community of [[Ahwatukee]] from the rest of the city.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 517.9 square miles (1,341&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). 516.7 square miles (1,338&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of it is land, and 1.2 square miles (3.1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or 0.2%) of it is water.

[[Maricopa County, Arizona#Demographics|Maricopa County]] grew by 811% from 186,000 in 1940 to 1,509,000 by 1980, thanks in part to air conditioning, cheap housing, and an influx of retirees. The once &quot;modest urban sprawl&quot; now &quot;grew by 'epic' proportions— not only a myriad of residential tract developments on both farmland and desert.&quot; Retail outlets and office complexes spread out and did not concentrate in the small downtown area. There was low population density and a lack of widespread and significant high-rise development.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Elmore, ''A Guide to the architecture of Metro Phoenix ''(1985) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence Phoenix became a textbook case of [[urban sprawl]] for geographers.&lt;ref&gt;Paul M. Torrens, &quot;Simulating sprawl.&quot; Annals of the Association of American Geographers 96.2 (2006): 248–275.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carol E.

Like most of Arizona, Phoenix does not observe [[daylight saving time]]. In 1973, Governor [[Jack Williams (American politician)|Jack Williams]] argued to the U.S. Congress that energy use would increase in the evening should Arizona observe DST. He went on to say energy use would also rise early in the day &quot;because there would be more lights on in the early morning.&quot; Additionally, he said daylight saving time would cause children to go to school in the dark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/printDS/75798 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111247/http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/printDS/75798 |archive-date=September 29, 2007 |title=Arizona does not need daylight saving time&amp;nbsp;– Arizona Daily Star.' |date=May 19, 2005 |access-date=June 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Phoenix Urban Villages.svg|thumb|alt=a graphic representation showing how Phoenix is broken up into 15 urban villages|Map of the urban villages of Phoenix]]

Since 1979, the city of Phoenix has been divided into [[urban village]]s, many of which are based upon historically significant neighborhoods and communities that have since been annexed into Phoenix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.phoenix.gov/pdd/pz/village-planning-committees |publisher=City of Phoenix |title=Village Planning Committees |access-date=March 20, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325080714/https://www.phoenix.gov/pdd/pz/village-planning-committees |archive-date=March 25, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each village has a planning committee appointed directly by the city council. According to the city-issued village planning handbook, the purpose of the village planning committees is to &quot;work with the city's planning commission to ensure a balance of housing and employment in each village, concentrate development at identified village cores, and to promote the unique character and identity of the villages.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.phoenix.gov/pddsite/Documents/pdd_pz_pdf_00020.pdf |publisher=City of Phoenix |title=The Village Planning Handbook |page=1 |access-date=March 20, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327021820/https://www.phoenix.gov/pddsite/Documents/pdd_pz_pdf_00020.pdf |archive-date=March 27, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 15 urban villages: [[Ahwatukee, Phoenix|Ahwatukee Foothills]], [[Alhambra, Phoenix|Alhambra]], [[Camelback East, Phoenix|Camelback East]], [[Central City, Phoenix|Central City]], [[Deer Valley, Phoenix|Deer Valley]], Desert View, [[Encanto, Phoenix|Encanto]], [[Estrella, Phoenix|Estrella]], [[Laveen, Arizona|Laveen]], [[Maryvale, Phoenix|Maryvale]], North Gateway, North Mountain, Paradise Valley, [[Rio Vista, Phoenix|Rio Vista]], and South Mountain.

The urban village of Paradise Valley is distinct from the nearby [[Paradise Valley, Arizona|Town of Paradise Valley]]. Although the urban village is part of Phoenix, the town is independent.

In addition to the above urban villages, Phoenix has a variety of commonly referred-to regions and districts, such as [[Downtown Phoenix|Downtown]], [[Midtown, Phoenix, Arizona|Midtown]], Uptown,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.phoenix.gov/pddsite/Documents/ReinventPHX%20Uptown%20District%20Profile.pdf |publisher=City of Phoenix |title=ReinventPHX District Profile: Uptown |access-date=October 22, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102180553/https://www.phoenix.gov/pddsite/Documents/ReinventPHX%20Uptown%20District%20Profile.pdf |archive-date=January 2, 2017 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; West Phoenix, [[North/Northwest Phoenix|North Phoenix]], [[South Phoenix]], [[Biltmore Area]], [[Arcadia, Phoenix, Arizona|Arcadia]], and [[Sunnyslope, Phoenix|Sunnyslope]].

Settlers who blasphemed by denying the Trinity or the divinity of [[Jesus Christ]] could be punished by execution or the seizure of their lands. That meant that [[Jew]]s, [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], and other dissenters from Trinitarian Christianity who practiced their religions risked their lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;finkelman&quot;/&gt; Any person who insulted the [[Virgin Mary]], the [[apostles]], or the [[Four Evangelists|evangelists]] could be whipped, jailed, or fined. Otherwise, Trinitarian Christians' right to worship was protected. The law outlawed the use of &quot;heretic&quot; and other religious insults against them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes&quot;/&gt;

The law was used in at least one attempt to prosecute a non-Christian. In 1658, a Jew named Jacob Lumbrozo was accused of blasphemy after saying that Jesus was not the son of God and that the miracles described in the [[New Testament]] were conjuring tricks. Lumbrozo did not deny having said such things but argued that he had only responded to questions asked of him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Underwood&quot;&gt;Underwood, pp 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; He was held for trial, but the case was later dismissed, and he was given full citizenship as a condition of the restoration of Calvert's rule following the English Civil War.&lt;ref name=&quot;b22&quot;&gt;Brugger, p 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The law had its detractors, even among those groups protected by it. Puritans were concerned that the act and the proprietary government in general were royalist. They were also concerned that by swearing allegiance to Calvert, who was Catholic, they were being required to submit to the [[Pope]], whom they considered to be the Antichrist. Some Anglicans also opposed the law, believing that the Church of England should be the colony's sole established church.&lt;ref name=&quot;b22&quot;/&gt;

==Repeal and legacy==
[[File:William Claiborne (1600 – 1677).jpg|thumb|right|200px|William Claiborne, who rescinded the Toleration Act when he took over the colony during the reign of Oliver Cromwell|alt=A man in a line drawing wearing armor, with long hair, a mustache, and a goatee]]

In 1654, five years after its passage, the Act was repealed.&lt;ref name=&quot;finkelman&quot;/&gt; Two years earlier the colony had been seized by Protestants following the execution of King [[Charles I of England]] and the outbreak of the [[English Civil War]]. In the early stages of that conflict, the colonial assembly of Maryland and its neighbors in Virginia had publicly declared their support for the King. Parliament appointed Protestant commissioners loyal to their cause to subdue the colonies, and two of them, the Virginian [[William Claiborne]] and Puritan leader [[Richard Bennett (Governor)|Richard Bennett]], took control of the colonial government in St. Mary's City in 1652. In addition to repealing the Maryland Toleration Act with the assistance of Protestant assemblymen, Claiborne and Bennett passed a new law barring Catholics from openly practicing their religion.&lt;ref&gt;Brugger, p 21&lt;/ref&gt; Calvert regained control after making a deal with the colony's Protestants, and in 1657 the Act was again passed by the colonial assembly. This time, it would last more than thirty years, until 1692.&lt;ref name=&quot;finkelman&quot;/&gt;

Following the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 in England, when the Catholic King [[James II of England]] was deposed and the Protestant [[William III of England|William III]] ascended the throne, a rebellion of Maryland Puritan Protestants overthrew Calvert's rule. They quickly rescinded the Toleration Act and banned public practice of Catholicism, and it would never be reinstated under colonial rule. In fact, the colony established the Church of England as its official church in 1702 and explicitly barred Catholics from voting in 1718.&lt;ref name=&quot;finkelman&quot;/&gt; The Calvert family regained control over the colony in 1715, but only after [[Benedict Calvert, 4th Baron Baltimore|Benedict Calvert]] converted to Protestantism. His political control remained tense enough that he did not risk an attempt to reinstate protections for Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, pp 79–80&lt;/ref&gt; It took until the era of the [[American Revolution]] for religious tolerance or freedom to again become the practice in Maryland.&lt;ref name=&quot;finkelman&quot;/&gt;

While the law did not secure religious freedom, and while it included severe limitations, it was nonetheless a significant milestone. It predates the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], which is generally considered to be when the idea of religious freedom took root, and stands as the first legal guarantee of religious tolerance in American and British history. Later laws ensuring religious tolerance and freedom, including the British [[Act of Toleration 1689|Act of Toleration of 1689]], the [[Holy Experiment]] in [[Pennsylvania]], and laws concerning religion in other colonies such as [[South Carolina Colony|South Carolina]], may have been influenced by its example.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Underwood&quot;/&gt; According to historian Robert Brugger, &quot;...the measure marked a notable departure from Old World oppression.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;b20&quot;/&gt; It was not until the passage of the signed [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] over a century later that religious freedom was enshrined as a fundamental guarantee,&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes&quot;/&gt; but even that document echoes the Toleration Act in its use of the phrase, &quot;free exercise thereof&quot;. Thus, despite its lack of a full guarantee of religious freedom or broad-based tolerance, the law is, &quot;a significant step forward in the struggle for religious liberty.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;finkelman&quot;/&gt;

'''Child Soldiers International''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/our-strategy-1|title=Child Soldiers International {{!}} Our strategy|website=www.child-soldiers.org|access-date=2016-10-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161015000232/https://www.child-soldiers.org/our-strategy-1|archive-date=2016-10-15|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; formerly the '''Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers''', was a UK-based non-governmental organization that worked to prevent the recruitment, use and exploitation of children by armed forces and groups. As of 07 June 2019, it is no longer operational.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/childsoldiersin&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vision==

Child Soldiers International envisions a world where all children grow up realising their full potential and enjoying all their human rights. For this to be possible, Child Soldiers International is working to prevent armed forces and groups from recruiting, using and exploiting children.

==History==
Formerly the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/who-we-are-1|title=Child Soldiers International {{!}} Who we are|website=www.child-soldiers.org|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Child Soldiers International was founded in 1998 by leading human rights and humanitarian organisations, including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and Save the Children. Its purpose was to campaign for the adoption of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict (OPAC)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/OPACCRC.aspx|title=Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child|website=www.ohchr.org|access-date=2016-10-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502015246/http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/OPACCRC.aspx|archive-date=2013-05-02|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a human rights treaty that prohibits the use of children in armed conflict and raises the age of military recruitment. The treaty was adopted in 2000 and entered into enforcement phase on 12 February 2002. Child Soldiers International continues to promote adherence to the Optional Protocol and other relevant human rights standards.

Since then, Child Soldiers International has continued to promote the adoption and implementation of international legal standards&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/international-standards|title=Child Soldiers International {{!}} International standards|website=www.child-soldiers.org|access-date=2016-10-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220033316/https://www.child-soldiers.org/international-standards|archive-date=2018-02-20|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; protecting children from military recruitment or use in hostilities.

==Priority Countries==
Child Soldiers International has a London headquarters and conducts research, advocacy and capacity building in countries across the world. Recent programmes have included: [[Central African Republic]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/central-african-republic|title=Child Soldiers International {{!}} Central African Republic|website=www.child-soldiers.org|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Democratic Republic of Congo;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/democratic-republic-of-congo|title=Child Soldiers International {{!}} Democratic Republic of Congo|website=www.child-soldiers.org|access-date=2016-10-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308231442/https://www.child-soldiers.org/democratic-republic-of-congo|archive-date=2018-03-08|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/afghanistan|title=Child Soldiers International {{!}} Afghanistan|website=www.child-soldiers.org|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; India;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/india|title=Child Soldiers International {{!}} India|website=www.child-soldiers.org|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myanmar;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/myanmar|title=Child Soldiers International {{!}} Myanmar|website=www.child-soldiers.org|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thailand;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/thailand|title=Child Soldiers International {{!}} Thailand|website=www.child-soldiers.org|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy making==
Child Soldiers International delivers research findings and policy recommendations to the [[United Nations Security Council]] in New York and the UN [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]] in Geneva, Switzerland. According to UN documents, in relation to the adoption and enforcement of the [[Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict]], Child Soldiers International plays &quot;a key role in ensuring implementation at every level.&quot;

==Publications==
Child Soldiers International and [[UNICEF]] published the ''Guide to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc06/pdfs/option_protocol_conflict.pdf|title=Guide to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in December 2003. The guide summarizes the process of the treaty's adoption, its fundamental provisions, and recommends that certain activities be undertaken to ensure its full enforcement. It is a practical tool written to aid other NGOs, humanitarian groups, and legislative bodies in implementing OPAC's standards.

In 2001, 2004 and 2008, Child Soldiers International published ‘Child Soldiers Global Reports’ which provide a snapshot of the child soldier situation in every country worldwide. In 2012, Child Soldiers International published Louder than words: an agenda for action to end state use of child [[soldiers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/shop/louder-than-words|title=Child Soldiers International {{!}} Louder Than Words|website=www.child-soldiers.org|access-date=2016-10-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024231449/https://www.child-soldiers.org/shop/louder-than-words|archive-date=2016-10-24|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;  accompanied by a practical 10-point checklist to assist states to end their recruitment of children. In 2016, Child Soldiers International published A law unto themselves? Confronting the recruitment of children by armed groups. This provides a legal analysis of progress made so far in engaging with armed groups about child recruitment and use.

Child Soldiers International continues to regularly publish research, analysis and recommendations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/pages/shop/department/all|title=Child Soldiers International {{!}} All|website=www.child-soldiers.org|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; to support its advocacy goals. These seek to inform policy and action by building understanding of the causes of child soldier recruitment and use, and identifying sustainable solutions.

UNESCO recognizes 25 sites of cultural interest within the Mount Fuji locality. These 25 locations include the mountain and the Shinto shrine, [[Fujisan Hongū Sengen Taisha]], as well as the Buddhist [[Taisekiji|Taisekiji Head Temple]] founded in 1290, later depicted by Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] artist [[Hokusai|Katsushika Hokusai]].

==Etymology==
The current ''[[kanji]]'' for Mount Fuji, {{lang|ja|富}} and {{lang|ja|士}}, mean &quot;wealth&quot; or &quot;abundant&quot; and &quot;a man of status&quot; respectively. However, the name predates kanji, and these characters are [[ateji]], meaning that they were selected because their pronunciations match the syllables of the name but do not carry a meaning related to the mountain.

The origin of the name ''Fuji'' is unclear, having no recording of it being first called by this name. A text of the 9th&amp;nbsp;century, ''[[The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter|Tale of the Bamboo Cutter]]'', says that the name came from {{Nihongo|&quot;immortal&quot;|不死|fushi, fuji}} and also from the image of {{Nihongo|abundant|富|fu}} {{Nihongo|soldiers|士|shi, ji}}&lt;ref&gt;Although the word {{lang|ja|士}} can mean a {{Nihongo|soldier|兵士|heishi, heiji}}, or a {{Nihongo|samurai|武士|bushi}}, its original meaning is ''a man with a certain status''.&lt;/ref&gt; ascending the slopes of the mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/taketori/AnoTake.html |title=Japanese Text Initiative the''Taketori monogatari'' |publisher=Etext.lib.virginia.edu |date=August 31, 2004 |access-date=December 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early [[folk etymology]] claims that ''Fuji'' came from {{lang|ja|不二}} (''not'' + ''two''), meaning ''without equal'' or ''nonpareil''. Another claims that it came from {{lang|ja|不尽}} (''not'' + ''to exhaust''), meaning ''never-ending''.

[[Hirata Atsutane]], a Japanese classical scholar in the [[Edo period]],  speculated that the name is from a word meaning, &quot;a mountain standing up shapely as an {{Nihongo|ear|穂|ho}} of a rice plant&quot;. British missionary John Batchelor (1854–1944) argued that the name is from the [[Ainu language|Ainu]] word for &quot;fire&quot; (''fuchi'') of the fire deity [[Kamuy-huci|Kamui Fuchi]], which was denied by a Japanese linguist [[Kyōsuke Kindaichi]] on the grounds of phonetic development ([[sound change]]). It is also pointed out that ''huchi'' means an &quot;old woman&quot; and ''ape'' is the word for &quot;fire&quot;, ''ape huchi kamuy'' being the fire deity. Research on the distribution of place names that include ''fuji'' as a part also suggest the origin of the word ''fuji'' is in the [[Yamato people|Yamato]] language rather than Ainu. Japanese toponymist Kanji Kagami argued that the name has the same root as {{Nihongo|[[wisteria]]|藤|fuji}} and {{Nihongo|rainbow|虹|niji|but with an alternative reading, ''fuji''}}, and came from its &quot;long well-shaped slope&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city.fujinomiya.shizuoka.jp/e-museum/fujiyama/furufuji4.htm |title=富士山の名前の由来 |date=May 31, 2008 |access-date=December 23, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531001107/http://www.city.fujinomiya.shizuoka.jp/e-museum/fujiyama/furufuji4.htm |archivedate = May 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tisen.jp/tisenwiki/index.php?%C9%D9%BB%CE%BB%B3 |title=富士山 – 知泉Wiki |publisher=Tisen.jp |date=October 25, 2006 |access-date=December 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www5f.biglobe.ne.jp/~genn/sub5.html |title=地名・富士山の意味 |date=June 3, 2008 |access-date=December 23, 2010 |archiveurl = https://archive.today/20080603055732/http://www5f.biglobe.ne.jp/~genn/sub5.html |archivedate = June 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~hi5k-stu/aynu/huji.htm |title=富士山アイヌ語語源説について |publisher=Asahi-net.or.jp |date= |access-date=December 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern linguist [[Alexander Vovin]] proposes an alternative hypothesis based on Old Japanese reading */puⁿzi/: the word may have been borrowed from Eastern Old Japanese */pu nusi/ 火主 meaning 'fire master', see [[wikt:富士#Etymology 3]].

===Variations===
In English, the mountain is known as Mount Fuji. Some sources refer to it as &quot;Fuji-san&quot;, &quot;Fujiyama&quot; or, redundantly, &quot;Mt. Fujiyama&quot;. Japanese speakers refer to the mountain as &quot;Fuji-san&quot;. This &quot;san&quot; is not the [[-san|honorific suffix]] used with people's names, such as Watanabe-san, but the [[On reading|Sino-Japanese reading]] of the character {{nihongo||山|yama|&quot;mountain&quot;}} used in [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]] compounds. In [[Nihon-shiki romanization|Nihon-shiki]] and [[Kunrei-shiki romanization]], the name is transliterated as ''Huzi''.

Other Japanese names for Fuji Mount, which have become obsolete or poetic, include {{nihongo||ふじの山|Fuji-no-Yama|&quot;the Mountain of Fuji&quot;}}, {{nihongo||ふじの高嶺|Fuji-no-Takane|&quot;the High Peak of Fuji&quot;}}, {{nihongo||芙蓉峰|Fuyō-hō|&quot;the Lotus Peak&quot;}}, and {{nihongo||富岳／富嶽|Fugaku}}, created by combining the first character of {{lang|ja|富士}}, ''Fuji'', and {{lang|ja|岳}}, ''mountain''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?p=%E3%83%95%E3%82%B8%E3%82%B5%E3%83%B3&amp;enc=UTF-8&amp;stype=0&amp;dtype=0|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722101305/http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?p=%E3%83%95%E3%82%B8%E3%82%B5%E3%83%B3&amp;enc=UTF-8&amp;stype=0&amp;dtype=0|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-07-22|title=Fuji-san|publisher=Daijisen|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Red Fuji southern wind clear morning.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Fine Wind, Clear Morning]]'' woodblock print by [[Hokusai]], 19th century]]
Mount Fuji is an attractive [[volcanic cone]] and a frequent subject of [[Japanese art]] especially after 1600, when [[Edo]] (now Tokyo) became the capital and people saw the mountain while traveling on the [[Tōkaidō (road)|Tōkaidō]] road. According to the historian [[H. Byron Earhart]], &quot;in medieval times it eventually came to be seen by Japanese as the “number one” mountain of the known world of the three countries of India, China, and Japan&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=H.

The summit has been thought of as sacred since ancient times and was forbidden to women until the [[Meiji (era)|Meiji era]] in the late 1860s. Ancient samurai used the base of the mountain as a remote training area, near the present-day town of [[Gotemba, Shizuoka|Gotemba]]. The ''[[shōgun]]'' [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] held ''[[yabusame]]'' in the area in the early [[Kamakura period]].

The first ascent by a foreigner was by Sir [[Rutherford Alcock]] in September 1860, who ascended the mountain in 8 hours and descended in 3 hours.&lt;ref name = alcock&gt;{{cite book

Mount Fuji is a very distinctive feature of the [[geography of Japan]]. It stands {{cvt|3776.24|m|ft|0}} tall and is located near the Pacific coast of central Honshu, just southwest of Tokyo. It straddles the boundary of [[Shizuoka Prefecture|Shizuoka]] and [[Yamanashi Prefecture|Yamanashi]] [[Prefectures of Japan|Prefectures]]. Four small cities surround it: [[Gotemba, Shizuoka|Gotemba]] to the east, [[Fujiyoshida]] to the north, [[Fujinomiya, Shizuoka|Fujinomiya]] to the southwest, and [[Fuji, Shizuoka|Fuji]] to the south. It is surrounded by five lakes: [[Lake Kawaguchi]], [[Lake Yamanaka]], [[Saiko Lake|Lake Sai]], [[Lake Motosu]] and [[Lake Shōji]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gvp&quot;&gt;{{cite gvp|vnum=0803-03=|title=Fuji}}&lt;/ref&gt; They, and nearby [[Lake Ashi]], provide views of the mountain. The mountain is part of the [[Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park]]. It can be seen more distantly from Yokohama, Tokyo, and sometimes as far as [[Chiba (city)|Chiba]], [[Saitama (city)|Saitama]], [[Tochigi, Tochigi|Tochigi]], [[Ibaraki, Ibaraki|Ibaraki]] and [[Lake Hamana]] when the sky is clear. It has been photographed from space during a space shuttle mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;sts-107&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-107/html/s107e05690.html|title=STS-107 Shuttle Mission Imagery|publisher=[[NASA]]|date=January 26, 2003|access-date=December 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate ===
The summit of Mount Fuji has a tundra climate ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''ET''). The temperature is very low at the high altitude, and the cone is covered by snow for several months of the year. The lowest recorded temperature is {{convert|−38.0|C|F}} recorded in February 1981, and the highest temperature was {{convert|17.8|C|F}} recorded in August 1942.

In an interview with a CBS reporter, Wang said, &quot;(It's) painful, and not only that, I have no choice. So I think when you start there's a certain innocence because of that freedom, and as you evolve you begin to see the parameters of what you can and can't do. So I make decisions that are very tiny that will affect an hour of work, I make decisions that will impact the lives of the people that work for me. It's in fashion as well, micro work, a centimeter of proportion and then it's macro to see what a vision is on the red carpet.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vera-wang-talks-bridal-inspiration-how-she-applies-fashion-sense-to-wedding-style/|title=Vera Wang talks bridal inspiration, how she applies fashion sense to wedding style|access-date=February 14, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WertherLotte.jpg|thumbnail|300px|Werther and Lotte, from ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'']]

A '''copycat suicide''' is defined as an emulation of another suicide that the person attempting suicide knows about either from local knowledge or due to accounts or depictions of the original suicide on television and in other media.

A spike of emulation suicides after a widely publicized suicide is known as the Werther effect, following [[Goethe]]'s novel ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schmidtke A, Häfner H | year = 1988 | title = The Werther effect after television films: new evidence for an old hypothesis | url = | journal = Psychol. Med. | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 665–76 | pmid = 3263660 | doi=10.1017/s0033291700008345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publicized suicide serves as a trigger, in the absence of protective factors, for the next suicide by a susceptible or suggestible person. This is referred to as suicide contagion.&lt;ref name=&quot;AbnormalPsychologyBook&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Halgin |first=Richard P. |author2=Susan Whitbourne |title=Abnormal Psychology with MindMap II CD-ROM and PowerWeb |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |url=http://www.mheducation.ca/highereducation/products/9780077779948/pk+abnrml+psych+w%7C+%7Ccnct++ac/|date=January 2006 |pages=62  |isbn=0-07-322872-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; They occasionally spread through a school system, through a community, or in terms of a celebrity suicide wave, nationally. This is called a suicide cluster.&lt;ref name=&quot;AbnormalPsychologyBook&quot; /&gt; Suicide clusters are caused by the social learning of suicide-related behaviors, or &quot;copycat suicides&quot;. Point clusters are clusters of suicides in both time and space, and have been linked to direct social learning from nearby individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goleman (1987)&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Golman |first=D |title= Pattern of Death: Copycat Suicides among Youths. |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/18/nyregion/pattern-of-death-copycat-suicides-among-youths.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate= April 21, 2011 |date=1987-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mass clusters are clusters of suicides in time but not space, and have been linked to the broadcasting of information concerning celebrity suicides via the mass media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mesoudi|first=A|title=The Cultural Dynamics of Copycat Suicide|journal=PLOS ONE|year=2009|volume=4|issue=9|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0007252|pmid=19789643|pmc=2748702|pages=e7252|bibcode=2009PLoSO...4.7252M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Wilhelm Amberg Vorlesung aus Goethes Werther.jpg|thumbnail|300px|[[Wilhelm Amberg]] Reading from Goethe's Werther]]
One of the earliest known associations between the media and suicide arose from Goethe's novel ''Die Leiden des jungen Werthers'' (''The Sorrows of Young Werther''). Soon after its publication in 1774, young men began to mimic the main character by dressing in yellow pants and blue jackets. In the novel, Werther shoots himself with a pistol after he is rejected by the woman he loves, and shortly after its publication there were reports of young men using the same method to kill themselves in acts of hopelessness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer's Social Psychology&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Meyers|first=David G.|title=Social Psychology (10th Ed)|year=2009|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-337066-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This resulted in the book being banned in several places. Hence the term &quot;Werther effect&quot;, used in the technical literature to designate copycat suicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/entity/mental_health/media/en/426.pdf |title=Preventing suicide: A report for media professionals |accessdate=2007-06-09 |year=2000 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by researcher [[David Phillips (sociologist)|David Phillips]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=De Wyze |first=Jeannette |title=Why Do They Die? |newspaper= San Diego Reader |date=2005-03-31 |url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2005/mar/31/why-do-they-die/ |accessdate=2008-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports in 1985 and 1989 by Phillips and his colleagues found that suicides and other accidents seem to rise after a well-publicized suicide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer's Social Psychology&quot; /&gt;

== Demographic factors ==
People who are young or old – but not middle-aged – seem to be most susceptible to this effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Sisask|first1=Merike|last2=Värnik|first2=Airi|date=2017-01-04|title=Media Roles in Suicide Prevention: A Systematic Review|url=|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=9|issue=1|pages=123–138|doi=10.3390/ijerph9010123|issn=1661-7827|pmc=3315075|pmid=22470283}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least five percent of youth suicides may be influenced by contagion.&lt;ref name=&quot;margot&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sanger-Katz |first1=Margot |title=The Science Behind Suicide Contagion |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/upshot/the-science-behind-suicide-contagion.html |accessdate=28 June 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the effects of [[differential identification]], the people who attempt to copy a suicidal act tend to have the same age and gender as the triggering suicide.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

== Timing ==
These suicidal actions tend to happen in the days and sometimes weeks after a suicide is announced.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  In exceptional cases, such as a widely discussed suicide by a celebrity, an increased level of thinking about suicide may persist for up to one year.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

== Factors in suicide reporting ==
Copycat suicide is mostly blamed on the media. A study conducted in 2002 found evidence for &quot;the influence of media on suicidal behaviour has been shown for newspaper and television reports of actual suicides, film and television portrayals of suicides, and suicide in literature, especially suicide manuals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hawton|first1=Keith|last2=Williams|first2=Kathryn|date=2002|title=Influences Of The Media On Suicide: Researchers, Policy Makers, And Media Personnel Need To Collaborate On Guidelines|journal=BMJ: British Medical Journal|volume=325|issue=7377|pages=1374–1375|jstor=25453137|pmid=12480830|pmc=1124845|doi=10.1136/bmj.325.7377.1374}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Hearing about a suicide seems to make those who are vulnerable feel they have permission to do it,&quot; Phillips said. He cited studies that showed that people were more likely to engage in dangerous deviant behavior, such as drug taking, if someone else had set the example first.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goleman (1987)&quot; /&gt;

The Werther effect not only predicts an increase in suicide, but the majority of the suicides will take place in the same or a similar way as the one publicized. The more similar the person in the publicized suicide is to the people exposed to the information about it, the more likely the age group or demographic is to die by suicide. The increase generally happens only in areas where the suicide story was highly publicized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer's Social Psychology&quot; /&gt; Upon learning of someone else's suicide, some people decide that action may be appropriate for them as well, especially if the publicized suicide was of someone in a situation similar to their own.

Publishing the means of suicides, romanticized and sensationalized reporting—particularly about celebrities, suggestions that there is an epidemic, glorifying the deceased and simplifying the reasons all lead to increases in the suicide rate. People may see suicide as a glamorous ending, with the victim getting attention, sympathy, and concern that they never got in life. A second possible factor is that vulnerable youth may feel, &quot;If they couldn't cut it, neither can I&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mulvihill&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Mulvihill|first=G|title=Experts Fear Copycat Suicides After Bullying Cases.

Stack&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stack S |title=Media coverage as a risk factor in suicide |journal=Inj. Prev. |volume=8 Suppl 4 |issue=90004 |pages=IV30–2 |year=2002 |pmid=12460954 |pmc=1765497|doi=10.1136/ip.8.suppl_4.iv30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed the results from 42 studies and found that those measuring the effect of a celebrity suicide story were 14.3 times more likely to find a copycat effect than studies that did not. Studies based on a real as opposed to a fictional story were 4.03 times more likely to uncover a copycat effect and research based on televised stories was 82% less likely to report a copycat effect than research based on newspapers. Other scholars have been less certain about whether copycat suicides truly happen or are selectively hyped. For instance, fears of a suicide wave following the [[suicide of Kurt Cobain]] never materialized in an actual increase in suicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jobes D. |author2=Berman A. |author3=O'Carroll P. |author4=Eastgard S. | year = 1996 | title = The Kurt Cobain suicide crisis: Perspectives from research, public health and the news media | url = | journal = Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior | volume = 26 | issue = 3| pages = 260–271 |title-link=Death of Kurt Cobain |pmid=8897665 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coverage of Cobain's suicide in the local [[Seattle]] area focused largely on treatment for mental health issues, suicide prevention and the suffering Cobain's death caused to his family. Perhaps as a result, the local suicide rate actually declined in the following months.&lt;ref name=&quot;margot&quot; /&gt;

Furthermore, there is evidence for an indirect Werther effect, i.e. the perception that suicidal media content influences others which, in turn, can concurrently or additionally influence one person's own future thoughts and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scherr |first1=S. |last2=Reinemann |first2=C. |year=2011 |title=Belief in a Werther effect.

Studies show a high incidence of [[psychiatric disorder]]s in suicide victims at the time of their death with the total figure ranging from 87.3%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Arsenault-Lapierre G, Kim C, Turecki G|year=2004|title=Psychiatric diagnoses in 3275 suicides: a meta-analysis|url=|journal=BMC Psychiatry|volume=4|issue=|page=37|doi=10.1186/1471-244X-4-37|pmc=534107|pmid=15527502}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 98%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bertolote JM, Fleischmann A, De Leo D, Wasserman D | year = 2004 | title = Psychiatric diagnoses and suicide: revisiting the evidence | url = | journal = Crisis | volume = 25 | issue = 4| pages = 147–55 | doi = 10.1027/0227-5910.25.4.147 | pmid = 15580849 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[mood disorder]]s and [[substance abuse]] being the two most common.

== Social proof model ==
An alternate model to explain copycat suicide, called &quot;[[social proof]]&quot; by Cialdini,&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-688-12816-5&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert B. Cialdini |title=Influence: the psychology of persuasion |publisher=Morrow |location=New York |year=1993 |page=[https://archive.org/details/influencepsychol00cial/page/336 336] |isbn=0-688-12816-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/influencepsychol00cial/page/336 }}&lt;/ref&gt; goes beyond the theories of glorification and simplification of reasons to look at why copycat suicides are so similar, demographically and in actual methods, to the original publicized suicide. In the social proof model, people imitate those who seem similar, despite or even because of societal disapproval. This model is important because it has nearly opposite ramifications for what the media ought to do about the copycat suicide effect than the standard model does.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} To deal with this problem, [[Alex Mesoudi]] of [[Queen Mary University of London]], developed a computer model of a community of 1000 people, to examine how copycat suicides occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mesoudi|first=Alex|date=2009-09-30|editor-last=Jones|editor-first=James Holland|title=The Cultural Dynamics of Copycat Suicide|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=4|issue=9|pages=e7252|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0007252|issn=1932-6203|pmc=2748702|pmid=19789643|bibcode=2009PLoSO...4.7252M}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were divided into 100 groups of 10, in a model designed to represent different levels of social organization, such as schools or hospitals within a town or state. Mesoudi then circulated the simulation through 100 generations. He found the simulated people acted just as sociologists' theory predicted. They were more likely to die by suicide in clusters, either because they had learned this trait from their friends, or because suicidal people are more likely to be like one another.&lt;ref name=Hamzelou&gt;{{cite news|last=Hamzelou|first=J|title=Copycat suicides fuelled by media reports.|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17889-copycat-suicides-fuelled-by-media-reports.html|accessdate=April 21, 2011|newspaper=Newscientist|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Journalism codes ==
Various countries have national journalism codes which range from one extreme of, &quot;Suicide and attempted suicide should in general never be given any mention&quot; ([[Norway]]) to a more moderate, &quot;In cases of suicide, publishing or broadcasting information in an exaggerated way that goes beyond normal dimensions of reporting with the purpose of influencing readers or spectators should not occur.&quot; University of London psychologist Alex Mesoudi recommends that reporters follow the sort of guidelines the World Health Organization and others endorse for coverage of any suicide: use extreme restraint in covering these deaths—keep the word &quot;suicide&quot; out of the headline, don't romanticize the death, and limit the number of stories.&lt;ref name=Franklin&gt;{{cite news|last=Franklin|first=D|title=Copycat Suicides: What's The Media's Role?|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2009/09/copycat_suicides_whats_the_med.html|accessdate=August 1, 2015|newspaper=NPR|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photography, pictures, visual images or film depicting such cases should not be made public&quot; ([[Turkey]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;MediaWise Covering&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediawise.org.uk/files/uploaded/Covering%20Suicide%20Worldwide.pdf |title=Covering suicide worldwide: media responsibilities |accessdate=2007-06-09 |last=Norris |first=Bill |author2=Mike Jempson |author3=Lesley Bygrave |date=September 2001 |publisher=[[National Institute on Media and the Family|The MediaWise Trust]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614001050/http://www.mediawise.org.uk/files/uploaded/Covering%20Suicide%20Worldwide.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-14 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; While many countries do not have national codes, media outlets still often have in-house guidelines along similar lines. In the [[United States]], there are no industry-wide standards. A survey of in-house guides of 16 US daily [[newspaper]]s showed that only three mentioned the word ''suicide,'' and none gave guidelines about publishing the method of suicide. Craig Branson, online director of the [[American Society of News Editors]] (ASNE), has been quoted as saying, &quot;Industry codes are very generic and totally voluntary. Most ethical decisions are left to individual editors at individual papers. The industry would fight any attempt to create more specific rules or standards, and editors would no doubt ignore them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MediaWise Covering&quot; /&gt; Guidelines on the reporting of suicides in Ireland were introduced recently with attempt to remove any positive connotations the act might have (e.g. using the term &quot;completed&quot; rather than &quot;successful&quot; when describing a suicide attempt which resulted in a death).{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s journalistic standards and practices manual discourages the reporting of the details of suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Journalist training ===
Australia is one of the few countries where there is a concerted effort to teach journalism students about this subject. The Mindframe national media initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediawise.org.uk/display_page.php?id=171 |title=Reporting Suicide: Guidance for journalists |accessdate=2007-06-09 |publisher=[[National Institute on Media and the Family|The MediaWise Trust]], Spanish, French |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050311215354/http://www.mediawise.org.uk/display_page.php?id=171 |archive-date=2005-03-11 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; followed an ambivalent response by the [[Australian Press Council]] to an earlier media resource kit issued by Suicide Prevention Australia and the Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention.

[[Headline]] is Ireland's media monitoring programme for suicide and mental health issues, set up by Shine and the Health Service Executives National Office for Suicide Prevention as part of 'Reach Out: National Strategy for action on Suicide Prevention.' Headline works with media professionals and students to find ways to collaborate to ensure that suicide, mental health and mental illness are responsibly covered in the media and provides information on reporting on mental health and suicidal behavior, literature and daily analysis of news stories. Headline also serves as a vehicle for the public to become involved in helping to monitor the Irish media on issues relating to mental health and suicide.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Studies suggest that the risk of suicide fell significantly when media outlets began following recommendations for suicide reporting in the late 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;margot&quot; /&gt;

== Prevention ==
The Papageno effect is the effect that mass media can have by presenting non-suicide alternatives to crises.  It is named after a lovelorn character, [[Papageno]], from the 18th-century opera ''[[The Magic Flute]]''; he was contemplating suicide until other characters showed him a different way to resolve his problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The Dow averaged a 5.3% return compounded annually for the 20th century, a record [[Warren Buffett]] called &quot;a wonderful century&quot;; when he calculated that to achieve that return again, the index would need to close at about 2,000,000 by December 2099.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Buffett | first=Warren | title=Letter to Shareholders | url=http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2007ltr.pdf | publisher=[[Berkshire Hathaway]] | date=February 2008 | access-date=March 4, 2008 | archive-date=March 7, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307045252/http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2007ltr.pdf | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DJIA during 911.svg|thumb|left|The Dow fell 14.3% after the [[September 11 attacks]]. Exchanges were closed from September 12 through September 16, 2001.]]
On September 17, 2001, the first day of trading after the [[September 11 attacks]], the Dow fell 7.1%. However, the Dow began an upward trend shortly after the attacks, and quickly regained all lost ground to close above 10,000 for the year. In 2002, the Dow dropped to a 4-year low of 7286 on September 24, 2002 due to the [[stock market downturn of 2002]] and lingering effects of the [[dot-com bubble]]. Overall, while the NASDAQ fell roughly 75% and the S&amp;P 500 fell roughly 50% between 2000 and 2002, the Dow only fell 27% during the same period. In 2003, the Dow held steady within the 7,000 to 9,000-point level and recovered to the 10,000 mark by year end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Dow Jones - DJIA - 100 Year Historical Chart|url=https://www.macrotrends.net/1319/dow-jones-100-year-historical-chart|access-date=September 2, 2020|website=MacroTrends.net|archive-date=August 31, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200831074740/https://www.macrotrends.net/1319/dow-jones-100-year-historical-chart|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dow continued climbing and reached a record high of 14,198.10 on October 11, 2007, a mark which was not matched until March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2013/03/dow-jones-at-all-time-high.html | title=The Dow Jones Has Never Been Higher | first=JOSH | last=VOORHEES | work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | date=March 5, 2013 | access-date=September 15, 2019 | archive-date=July 29, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200729224554/https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2013/03/dow-jones-at-all-time-high.html | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; It then dropped for the next year due to the [[Financial crisis of 2007-2008]].

On September 15, 2008, a wider financial crisis became evident when [[Lehman Brothers]] filed for [[bankruptcy]] along with the economic effect of record high oil prices which had reached almost $150 per [[Barrel of oil equivalent|barrel]] two months earlier. The Dow lost more than 500 points for the day, returning to its mid-July lows below 11,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://money.cnn.com/2008/09/15/markets/markets_newyork2/index.htm | title=Stocks get pummeled | first=Alexandra | last=Twin | work=[[CNN]] | date=September 21, 2008 | access-date=September 15, 2019 | archive-date=January 12, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200112033135/https://money.cnn.com/2008/09/15/markets/markets_newyork2/index.htm | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/09/16/this-day-in-crisis-history-sept-15-16-2008/ | title=This Day in Crisis History: Sept. 15-16, 2008 | first=Paul | last=Vigna | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=September 16, 2013 | url-access=subscription | access-date=September 15, 2019 | archive-date=September 3, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190903215838/https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/09/16/this-day-in-crisis-history-sept-15-16-2008/ | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of [[bailout]] packages, including the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]], proposed and implemented by the [[Federal Reserve]] and [[United States Department of the Treasury]] did not prevent further losses. After nearly six months of extreme volatility during which the Dow experienced its largest one-day point loss, largest daily point gain, and largest intraday range (of more than 1,000 points) at the time, the index closed at a new 12-year low of 6,547.05 on March 9, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/finance/historical?cid=983582&amp;startdate=Mar+05%2C+2009&amp;enddate=Mar+09%2C+2009 ''Dow Jones Industrial Average Historical Prices''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204221443/http://www.google.com/finance/historical?cid=983582&amp;startdate=Mar+05%2C+2009&amp;enddate=Mar+09%2C+2009 |date=February 4, 2017 }}.

Towards the latter half of 2009, the average rallied towards the 10,000 level amid optimism that the [[Late-2000s recession]], the [[United States housing bubble]] and the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]], were easing and possibly coming to an end. For the decade, the Dow saw a rather substantial pullback for a negative return from 11,497 to 10,428, a loss of a little over 9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/12-dr-dooms-shred-2010-investing-optimism-2010-01-05 | title=Optimist?

During the first half of the 2010s decade, aided by the [[Federal Reserve]]'s loose [[monetary policy]] including [[quantitative easing]], the Dow made a notable rally attempt. This was despite significant volatility due to growing global concerns such as the [[2010 European sovereign debt crisis]], the [[Dubai World 2009 debt standstill]], and the [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011]].{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

==Calculation==
To calculate the DJIA, the sum of the prices of all 30 stocks is divided by a [[divisor]], the Dow Divisor. The divisor is adjusted in case of stock splits, spinoffs or similar structural changes, to ensure that such events do not in themselves alter the numerical value of the DJIA. Early on, the initial divisor was composed of the original number of component companies; this initially made the DJIA a simple [[arithmetic]] average. The present divisor, after many adjustments, is less than one (meaning the index is larger than the sum of the prices of the components).
That is:
:&lt;math&gt; \text{DJIA} = {\sum p \over d}&lt;/math&gt;
where '''''p''''' are the prices of the component stocks and '''''d''''' is the ''Dow Divisor''.

Events such as [[stock split]]s or changes in the list of the companies composing the index alter the sum of the component prices. In these cases, in order to avoid discontinuity in the index, the Dow Divisor is updated so that the quotations right before and after the event coincide:

:&lt;math&gt; \text{DJIA} = {\sum p_\text{old} \over d_\text{old} } = {\sum p_\text{new} \over d_\text{new} }.&lt;/math&gt;

{{As of|2020|08|31|since=y|df=us|post=,}} the Dow Divisor is 0.15198707565833&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.barrons.com/market-data/market-lab |title=Market Laboratory |website=Barrons.com |date=August 31, 2020 |access-date=September 5, 2020 |archive-date=August 30, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200830190959/https://www.barrons.com/market-data/market-lab |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and every $1 change in price in a particular stock within the average equates to a 6.579506814434802 (or 1 '''÷''' 0.15198707565833) point movement.

==Assessment==
===Issues with market representation===
With the inclusion of only 30 stocks, critics such as [[Ric Edelman]] argue that the DJIA is an inaccurate representation of overall market performance compared to more comprehensive indexes such as the [[S&amp;P 500 Index]] or the [[Russell 3000 Index]]. Additionally, the DJIA is criticized for being a [[price-weighted index]], which gives higher-priced stocks more influence over the average than their lower-priced counterparts, but takes no account of the relative industry size or market capitalization of the components. For example, a $1 increase in a lower-priced stock can be negated by a $1 decrease in a much higher-priced stock, even though the lower-priced stock experienced a larger [[percentage]] change. In addition, a $1 move in the smallest component of the DJIA has the same effect as a $1 move in the largest component of the average. For example, during September–October 2008, former component [[AIG]]'s reverse split-adjusted stock price collapsed from $22.76 on September 8 to $1.35 on October 27; contributing to a roughly 3,000-point drop in the index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=La Monica | first=Paul | url=https://money.cnn.com/2008/09/14/markets/thebuzz/ | title=Toss AIG from the Dow! | work=[[CNN]] | date=September 15, 2008 | access-date=September 15, 2019 | archive-date=October 29, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029130700/https://money.cnn.com/2008/09/14/markets/thebuzz/ | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2020|03|post=,}} Apple and UnitedHealth Group are among the highest priced stocks in the average and therefore have the greatest influence on it. Alternately, Pfizer and Dow Inc. are among the lowest priced stocks in the average and have the least amount of sway in the price movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indexarb.com/indexComponentWtsDJ.html|title=Index Component Weights of Stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average|publisher=Ergo Inc.|website=Index Insight and Market Timing Tools: Futures, Equities, Options|accessdate=July 25, 2014|archive-date=July 28, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728160411/http://indexarb.com/indexComponentWtsDJ.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the DJIA and most securities professionals recommend the [[capitalization-weighted index|market-capitalization weighted]] [[S&amp;P 500 Index]] or the [[Wilshire 5000]], the latter of which includes most publicly listed U.S. stocks, as better indicators of the U.S. stock market.

===Correlation among components===
A study between the correlation of components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average compared with the movement of the index finds that the correlation is higher when the stocks are declining. The correlation is lowest in a time when the average is flat or rises a modest amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Tobias Preis]], Dror Y. Kenett, [[H.

The '''Council of Ephesus''' was a council of Christian bishops convened in [[Ephesus]] (near present-day [[Selçuk]] in [[Turkey]]) in AD 431 by the [[Roman Emperors|Roman Emperor]] [[Theodosius II]]. This third [[ecumenical council]], an effort to attain [[consensus decision-making|consensus]] in the church through an [[legislature|assembly]] representing all of [[Christendom]],&lt;ref name=&quot;dictionary&quot;&gt;[[Richard Kieckhefer]] (1989). &quot;Papacy&quot;.

It met in June and July 431 at the [[Church of Mary]] in [[Ephesus]] in [[Anatolia]].

==Background==
Nestorius' doctrine, [[Nestorianism]], which emphasized the distinction between Christ's human and divine natures and argued that Mary should be called ''Christotokos'' (Christ-bearer) but not ''Theotokos'' (God-bearer), had brought him into conflict with other church leaders, most notably [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril]], [[Pope of Alexandria#Patriarch|Patriarch of Alexandria]]. Nestorius himself had requested the Emperor to convene the council, hoping that it would prove his [[orthodoxy]]; the council in fact condemned his teachings as [[heresy]]. The council declared Mary as ''Theotokos'' ([[Mother of God]]).&lt;ref&gt;Carl E. Braaten and Robert W. Jenson (2004), ''Mary, Mother of God''&lt;/ref&gt;

Nestorius' dispute with Cyril had led the latter to seek validation from [[Pope Celestine I]], who authorized Cyril to request that Nestorius recant his position or face [[excommunication]]. Nestorius pleaded with the [[Eastern Roman Emperor]] [[Theodosius II]] to call a council in which all grievances could be aired, hoping that he would be vindicated and Cyril condemned.

Approximately 250 [[bishop]]s were present. The proceedings were conducted in a heated atmosphere of confrontation and recriminations and created severe tensions between Cyril and Theodosius II. Nestorius was decisively outplayed by Cyril and removed from his [[Episcopal see|see]], and his teachings were officially [[anathematized]]. This precipitated the [[Nestorian Schism]], by which churches supportive of Nestorius, especially in the [[Persian Empire of the Sassanids]], were severed from the rest of [[Christendom]] and became known as [[Nestorian Christianity]], or the [[Church of the East]], whose present-day representatives are the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], the [[Ancient Church of the East]], the [[Chaldean Syrian Church]], and the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]]. Nestorius himself retired to a monastery, later recanting his [[Nestorian]] position. {{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

==History==
===Political context===
McGuckin cites the &quot;innate rivalry&quot; between [[Alexandria]] and [[Constantinople]] as an important factor in the controversy between [[Cyril of Alexandria]] and Nestorius.&lt;ref&gt;McGuckin, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; However, he emphasizes that, as much as political competition contributed to an &quot;overall climate of dissent&quot;, the controversy cannot be reduced merely to the level of &quot;personality clashes&quot; or &quot;political antagonisms&quot;. According to McGuckin, Cyril viewed the &quot;elevated intellectual argument about christology&quot; as ultimately one and the same as the &quot;validity and security of the simple Christian life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;McGuckin, pp. 19–21&lt;/ref&gt;

Even within Constantinople, some supported the Roman-Alexandrian and others supported the Nestorian factions. For example, [[Pulcheria]] supported the Roman-Alexandrian popes while the emperor and his wife supported Nestorius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The A to Z of the Coptic Church |first=Gawdat |last=Gabra |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2009 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theological context===
{{See also|Nestorianism}}

Contention over Nestorius' teachings, which he developed during his studies at the [[School of Antioch]], largely revolved around his rejection of the long-used title ''[[Theotokos]]'' (&quot;Birth-giver of God&quot;) for the [[Virgin Mary]]. Shortly after his arrival in Constantinople, Nestorius became involved in the disputes of two theological factions, which differed in their [[Christology]].

McGuckin ascribes Nestorius' importance to his being the representative of the Antiochene tradition and characterizes him as a &quot;consistent, if none too clear, exponent of the longstanding Antiochene dogmatic tradition.&quot; Nestorius was greatly surprised that what he had always taught in Antioch without any controversy whatsoever should prove to be so objectionable to the Christians of Constantinople.
Nestorius emphasized the [[Hypostatic union|dual natures]] of [[Christ]], trying to find a middle ground between those who emphasized the fact that in Christ God had been born as a man, insisted on calling the Virgin Mary ''[[Theotokos]]'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Θεοτόκος, &quot;God-bearer&quot;), and those that rejected that title because God as an eternal being could not have been born. Nestorius suggested the title ''Christotokos'' (''Χριστοτόκος'', &quot;Christ-bearer&quot;), but this proposal did not gain acceptance on either side.

Nestorius tried to answer a question considered unsolved: &quot;How can Jesus Christ, being part man, not be partially a sinner as well, since man is by definition a sinner since the Fall?&quot; To solve that he taught that [[Mary, the mother of Jesus]] gave birth to the incarnate Christ, not the divine [[Jesus Christ the Logos|Logos]] who existed before Mary and indeed before time itself. The Logos occupied the part of the human soul (the part of man that was stained by the Fall). But wouldn't the absence of a human soul make Jesus less human? Nestorius rejected this proposition, answering that, because the human soul was based on the archetype of the Logos, only to become polluted by the Fall, Jesus was &quot;more&quot; human for having the Logos and not &quot;less&quot;. Consequently, Nestorius argued that the Virgin Mary should be called ''Christotokos'', Greek for &quot;Birth Giver of Christ&quot;, and not ''[[Theotokos]]'', Greek for &quot;Birth Giver of God&quot;.

Nestorius believed that no union between the human and divine was possible. If such a union of human and divine occurred, Nestorius believed that Christ could not truly be con-substantial with God and con-substantial with us because he would grow, mature, suffer and die (which Nestorius argued God cannot do) and also would possess the power of God that would separate him from being equal to humans.

According to McGuckin, several mid-twentieth-century accounts have tended to &quot;romanticise&quot; Nestorius; in opposition to this view, he asserts that Nestorius was no less dogmatic, uncompromising than Cyril and that he was fully just as prepared to use his political and canonical powers as Cyril or any of the other hierarchs of the period.&lt;ref&gt;McGuckin, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Nestorius's opponents charged him with detaching Christ's divinity and humanity into two persons existing in one body, thereby denying the reality of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]]. [[Eusebius of Dorylaeum|Eusebius, a layman who later became the bishop of the neighbouring Dorylaeum]] was the first to accuse Nestorius of heresy but his most forceful opponent was Patriarch [[Cyril of Alexandria]]. Cyril argued that Nestorianism split Jesus in half and denied that he was both human and divine.

Cyril appealed to [[Pope Celestine I]], charging Nestorius with [[heresy]]. The Pope agreed and gave Cyril his authority to serve a notice to Nestorius to recant his views within ten days or else be [[excommunicated]]. Before acting on the Pope's commission, Cyril convened a synod of Egyptian bishops which condemned Nestorius as well. Cyril then sent four [[suffragan bishops]] to deliver both the Pope's commission as well as the synodal letter of the Egyptian bishops. Cyril sent a letter to Nestorius known as &quot;The Third Epistle of Saint Cyril to Nestorius.&quot; This epistle drew heavily on the established Patristic Constitutions and contained the most famous article of Alexandrian Orthodoxy: &quot;The Twelve Anathemas of Saint Cyril.&quot; In these [[anathema]]s, Cyril excommunicated anyone who followed the teachings of Nestorius. For example, &quot;Anyone who dares to deny the Holy Virgin the title ''[[Theotokos]]'' is Anathema!&quot; Nestorius however, still would not repent.
McGuckin points out that other representatives of the Antiochene tradition such as [[John I of Antioch|John of Antioch]], [[Theodoret]] and [[Andrew of Samosata]] were able to recognize &quot;the point of the argument for Christ's integrity&quot; and concede the &quot;ill-advised nature of Nestorius' immoveability.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McGuckin, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned at the potential for a negative result at a council, they urged Nestorius to yield and accept the use of the title ''Theotokos'' when referring to the Virgin Mary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelly&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The ecumenical councils of the Catholic Church: a history |first=Joseph |last=Kelly |publisher=Liturgical Press |year=2009 |isbn=9780814657034 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pg35WfMdM-QC&amp;q=%22Council+of+Ephesus%22+Candidian&amp;pg=PT74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, John of Antioch wrote to Nestorius urging him to submit to the Pope's judgment and cease stirring up controversy over a word that he disliked (Theotokos) but which could be interpreted as having an orthodox meaning especially in light of the fact that many saints and doctors of the church had sanctioned the word by using it themselves. John wrote to Nestorius, &quot;Don't lose your head. Ten days! It will not take you twenty-four hours to give the needed answer.... Ask advice of men you can trust. Ask them to tell you the facts, not just what they think will please you.... You have the whole of the East against you, as well as Egypt.&quot; Despite this advice from his colleagues, Nestorius persisted in maintaining the rightness of his position.

===Convocation===
[[File:Christian council of Ephèsus in 431.jpg|thumb|Council of Ephesus in 431, in the Basilica of Fourvière, [[Lyon]]]]
On 19 November, Nestorius, anticipating the ultimatum which was about to be delivered, convinced Emperor [[Theodosius II]] to summon a general council through which Nestorius hoped to convict Cyril of heresy and thereby vindicate his own teachings. Theodosius issued a Sacra calling for the metropolitan bishops to assemble in the city of Ephesus, which was a special seat for the veneration of Mary, where the ''theotokos'' formula was popular. Each bishop was to bring only his more eminent suffragans. The date set by the Emperor for the opening of the council was Pentecost (7 June) 431.&lt;ref&gt;McGuckin, pp. 53–54&lt;/ref&gt;

McGuckin notes that the vagueness of the Sacra resulted in wide variations of interpretation by different bishops. In particular, the vastness of John of Antioch's ecclesiastical territory required a lengthy period to notify and gather his delegates. Because the overland trip from Antioch to Ephesus was long and arduous, John composed his delegation of his metropolitan bishops who were restricted to bring no more than two suffragans each. By doing so, he minimized the number who would have to travel to Ephesus.
Neither of the emperors attended the council. Theodosius appointed Count Candidian as the head of the imperial palace guard to represent him, to supervise the proceedings of the Council, and to keep good order in the city of Ephesus. Despite Nestorius' agenda of prosecuting Cyril, Theodosius intended for the council to focus strictly on the christological controversy. He thus gave Candidianus strict directions to remain neutral and not to interfere in the theological proceedings. It is generally assumed that Candidian initially maintained his neutrality as instructed by the emperor and only gradually became more biased towards Nestorius. McGuckin, however, suggests that Candidian may have favored Nestorius from the start.&lt;ref&gt;McGuckin, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Saint Cyril of Alexandria and the Council of Ephesus|url=http://www.lacopts.org/articles/saint-cyril-of-alexandria-and-the-council-of-ephesus |accessdate=2011-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assembly===
Celestine sent Arcadius and Projectus, to represent himself and his Roman council; in addition, he sent the Roman priest, Philip, as his personal representative. Cyril Patriarch of Alexandria was president of the council. Celestine had directed the papal legates not to take part in the discussions, but to give judgment on them.&lt;ref name=&quot;CE2&quot; /&gt;

Bishops arrived in Ephesus over a period of several weeks. While waiting for the other bishops to arrive, they engaged in informal discussions characterized as tending to &quot;exasperate rather than heal their differences&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RobertsonP405&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robertson|first1=John Craigie|title=History of the Christian Church|date=1854|publisher=John Murray|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofchrist1873robe/page/405 405]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofchrist1873robe|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metropolitan of Ephesus, Memnon, was already present with his 52 bishops. Nestorius and his 16 bishops were the first to arrive shortly after Easter. As archbishop of the imperial city of Constantinople, he traveled with a detachment of troops who were under the command of Count Candidian. McGuckin notes that the troops were not there to serve as Nestorius' bodyguard but to support Candidian in his role as the emperor's representative. However, McGuckin theorizes that Candidian's progressive abandonment of neutrality in favor of Nestorius may have created the perception that Candidian's troops were, in fact, there to support Nestorius.&lt;ref&gt;McGuckin, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Candidian ordered all monks and lay strangers to leave the city; he further instructed the bishops not to leave on any pretext until the council was concluded.&lt;ref name=&quot;RobertsonP405&quot; /&gt; Several sources comment that the purpose of this injunction was to prevent bishops from leaving the council to appeal to the emperor directly.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uT09AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=Candidian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kjH5J2vEoP&amp;sig=QuZQcypKR7ey3a0j9AQ0IkxrHP8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj1uqn32MncAhWDq1kKHcobCG84ChDoATAEegQIBhAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Candidian&amp;f=false &quot;The Council of Ephesus&quot;, ''The Church Quarterly Review'', Vol. 33, (Arthur Cayley Headlam, ed.), Spottiswoode, 1892, p. 103]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to McGuckin, Memnon, as bishop of Ephesus, commanded the &quot;fervent and unquestioned loyalty&quot; of the local populace and thus could count on the support of local factions to counterbalance the military might of Candidian's troops.&lt;ref&gt;McGuckin, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; In view of the verdict of Rome against Nestorius, Memnon refused to have communion with Nestorius, closing the churches of Ephesus to him.&lt;ref&gt;McGuckin, pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyril brought with him 50 bishops, arriving only a few days before Pentecost.&lt;ref&gt;McGuckin, pp. 54–56&lt;/ref&gt; There were very few bishops representing the West, as the papal representatives would not arrive until July.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGuckin, p. 57&quot;&gt;McGuckin, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; The Palestinian delegation of 16 bishops and Metropolitan Flavian of Philippi arrived 5 days after the date that had been set for opening the council, and aligned themselves with Cyril.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGuckin, p. 57&quot;/&gt;

At this point, Cyril announced his intention to open the council; however, Candidian enjoined him from doing so on the grounds that the Roman and Antiochean delegations had not arrived yet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelly&quot; /&gt; Cyril initially acceded to Candidian's injunction knowing that he could not legally convene a council without the official reading of the Emperor's Sacra.&lt;ref&gt;McGuckin, p. 78; Nonetheless he must have been acutely aware that he could claim no legal status for his synod under imperial law until the official reading of the Emperor's Sacra had taken place.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of bishops, who were undecided between Nestorius and Cyril, did not want to give Cyril, as one party in the dispute, the right to chair the meeting and decide the agenda;&lt;ref&gt;McGuckin, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; however, they began to take Cyril's side for various reasons.&lt;ref&gt;McGuckin, pp. 60–65&lt;/ref&gt;

Various circumstances including a detour necessitated by flooding as well as sickness and death of some of the delegates seriously delayed John of Antioch and his bishops.&lt;ref&gt;McGuckin, pp. 58–59&lt;/ref&gt; It was rumored that John might be delaying his arrival in order to avoid participating in a council which was likely to condemn Nestorius as a heretic.&lt;ref name=&quot;CE2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Catholic Encyclopedia - Council of Ephesus|url=http://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=4311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First session - June 22===
Two weeks after the date set for the council, John and the bulk of his Syrian group (42 members) had not yet appeared. At this point, Cyril formally opened the council on Monday 22 June by enthroning the Gospels in the centre of the church, as a symbol of Christ's presence among the assembled bishops.&lt;ref&gt;McGuckin, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Kangur.rudy.drs.jpg|thumb|The [[red kangaroo]] is the largest extant [[Macropodidae|macropod]] and is one of Australia's heraldic animals,&lt;ref name=&quot;Egerton, p. 44&quot;&gt;Egerton, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; appearing with the [[emu]] on the [[coat of arms of Australia]].]]
The '''fauna of Australia''' consists of a huge variety of animals; some 83% of mammals, 89% of reptiles, 90% of fish and insects and 93% of [[amphibian]]s that inhabit the continent are [[endemic]] to [[Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot;&gt;Williams, J. et al. 2001. [http://www.environment.gov.au/soe/2001/publications/theme-reports/biodiversity/pubs/biodiversity.pdf ''Biodiversity, Australia State of the Environment Report 2001'' (Theme Report)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110327235509/http://environment.gov.au/soe/2001/publications/theme-reports/biodiversity/pubs/biodiversity.pdf |date=27 March 2011}}, CSIRO Publishing on behalf of the Department of the Environment and Heritage, Canberra. {{ISBN|0-643-06749-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This high level of endemism can be attributed to the continent's long geographic isolation, [[plate tectonics|tectonic]] stability, and the effects of an unusual pattern of climate change on the soil and [[Flora of Australia|flora]] over geological time. A unique feature of Australia's fauna is the relative scarcity of native [[placentalia|placental]] mammals. Consequently, the [[marsupial]]s – a group of mammals that raise their young in a [[pouch (marsupial)|pouch]], including the [[Macropodidae|macropod]]s, [[Phalangeriformes|possums]] and [[dasyuromorphia|dasyuromorphs]] – occupy many of the [[ecological niche]]s placental animals occupy elsewhere in the world. Australia is home to two of the five known extant species of [[monotreme]]s and has numerous [[venom (poison)|venomous]] species, which include the [[platypus]], [[spider]]s, [[scorpion]]s, [[octopus]], [[jellyfish]], [[mollusc]]s, [[stonefish]], and [[stingray]]s. Uniquely, Australia has more venomous than non-venomous species of [[snake]]s.

Hunting, the introduction of non-native species, and land-management practices involving the modification or destruction of habitats have led to numerous [[extinction]]s. Some historical examples include the [[paradise parrot]], [[pig-footed bandicoot]] and the [[broad-faced potoroo]]. Unsustainable land use still threatens the survival of many species. To target threats to the survival of its fauna, Australia has passed wide-ranging federal and state legislation and established numerous [[protected areas of Australia|protected areas]].

==Origins==
{{Main|Natural history of Australia}}
[[Image:Laurasia-Gondwana.png|thumb|250px|Evidence suggests that Australia was a part of the supercontinent [[Gondwana]] (land)]]
Both [[geology of Australia|geologic]] and climatic events helped to make Australia's fauna unique.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, pp. 14, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia was once part of the southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]],&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; which also included South America, Africa, India and Antarctica. Gondwana began to break up 140&amp;nbsp;million years ago (MYA); 50 MYA Australia separated from Antarctica and was relatively isolated until the collision of the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] with Asia in the [[Miocene]] era 5.3 MYA. The establishment and [[evolution]] of the present-day fauna was apparently shaped by the unique climate and the geology of the continent. As Australia [[continental drift|drifted]], it was, to some extent, isolated from the effects of global climate change. The unique fauna that originated in Gondwana, such as the marsupials, survived and [[adaptive radiation|adapted]] in Australia.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

After the [[Miocene]], fauna of Asian origin were able to establish themselves in Australia. The [[Wallace Line]]—the hypothetical line separating the [[zoogeography|zoogeographical]] regions of Asia and Australasia—marks the tectonic boundary between the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] and Indo-Australian plates. This continental boundary prevented the formation of land bridges and resulted in a distinct zoological distribution, with limited overlap, of most Asian and Australian fauna, with the exception of birds. Following the emergence of the circumpolar current in the mid-[[Oligocene]] era (some 15 MYA), the Australian climate became increasingly arid, giving rise to a diverse group of arid-specialised organisms, just as the wet tropical and seasonally wet areas gave rise to their own uniquely adapted species.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Although terrestrial marsupials and placental mammals did coexist in Australia in the Eocene, only the marsupials have survived to the present. Non-volant placental mammals made their reappearance in Australia in the Miocene, when Australia moved closer to [[Indonesia]], and [[rodent]]s started to appear reliably in the Early Pliocene fossil record.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://austhrutime.com/australian_palaeohabitats_from_mammals.htm|title=Australian Palaeohabitats indicated by Mammal Fossil Record|website=austhrutime.com|access-date=2020-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marsupials evolved to fill specific ecological niches, and in many cases they are physically similar to the placental mammals in [[Eurasia]] and North America that occupy similar niches, a phenomenon known as [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, C.R. et al. 2008.

===Monotremes and marsupials===
[[Image:Tachyglossus aculeatus side on.jpg|thumb|left|[[Short-beaked echidna]]]]
[[Image:Platypus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Platypus]]]]
Two of the five living species of [[monotreme]] occur in Australia: the [[platypus]] and the [[short-beaked echidna]].&lt;ref name=e36&gt;Egerton, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The monotremes differ from other mammals in their methods of reproduction; in particular, they lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young.&lt;ref name=e36/&gt; The platypus—a [[venom]]ous, egg-laying, duck-billed amphibious mammal—is considered to be one of the strangest creatures in the animal kingdom. When it was first presented by [[Joseph Banks]] to English naturalists it was thought to be so strange that it was a cleverly created hoax.&lt;ref name=e36/&gt;&lt;ref name=m44&gt;Menkhorst and Knight, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The short-beaked echidna is similarly strange, covered in hairy spikes with a tubular snout in the place of a mouth, and a tongue that can move in and out of the snout about 100 times a minute to capture [[termite]]s.&lt;ref name=m44/&gt;&lt;ref name=e37&gt;Egerton, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Australia Cairns Koala.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The [[koala]] does not normally need to drink, because it can obtain all of the moisture it needs by eating leaves.]]
[[Herbivore|Herbivorous]] marsupials are classified in the order [[Diprotodontia]], and further into the suborders [[Vombatiformes]] and [[Phalangerida]]. The Vombatiformes include the koala and the three species of [[wombat]]. One of Australia's best-known marsupials, the [[koala]] is an arboreal species that feeds on the leaves of various species of [[eucalyptus]].&lt;ref name=m86&gt;Menkhorst and Knight, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Wombats, on the other hand, live on the ground and feed on [[Poaceae|grasses]], [[Cyperaceae|sedges]] and [[root]]s.&lt;ref name=m86/&gt; Wombats use their rodent-like front teeth and powerful claws to dig extensive burrow systems; they are mainly [[crepuscular]] and [[nocturnal animal|nocturnal]].&lt;ref name=m86/&gt;

The [[Phalangerida]] includes six families and 26 species of [[Phalangeriformes|possum]] and three families with 53 species of [[Macropodidae|macropod]]. The possums are a diverse group of arboreal marsupials and vary in size from the [[little pygmy possum]], weighing just 7&amp;nbsp;g,&lt;ref&gt;Menkhorst and Knight, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; to the cat-sized [[Common ringtail possum|common ringtail]] and [[Common brushtail possum|brushtail]] possums.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Menkhorst and Knight, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sugar glider|sugar]] and [[squirrel glider]]s are common species of gliding possum, found in the eucalypt forests of eastern Australia, while the [[feathertail glider]] is the smallest glider species.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, pp. 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Menkhorst and Knight, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; The gliding possums have membranes called &quot;patagia&quot; that extend from the fifth finger of their forelimb back to the first toe of their hind foot. These membranes, when outstretched, allow them to glide between trees.

The macropods are divided into three families: the [[Musky rat-kangaroo|Hypsiprymnodontidae]], with the musky rat-kangaroo as its only member;&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Potoroidae]], with 11 species; and the [[Macropodidae]], with 45 species.&lt;ref&gt;Menkhorst and Knight, pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Macropods are found in all Australian environments except alpine areas. The Potoroidae include the bettongs, potaroos and rat-kangaroos, small species that make nests and carry plant material with their tails.&lt;ref&gt;Menkhorst and Knight, pp. 17, 104–110.&lt;/ref&gt; The Macropodiae include [[kangaroo]]s, [[wallaby|wallabies]] and associated species; size varies widely within this family. Most macropods have large hind legs and long, narrow hind feet,&lt;ref&gt;Menkhorst and Knight, pp. 17–18, 110–120.&lt;/ref&gt; with a distinctive arrangement of four toes, and powerfully muscled [[Tail (anatomy)|tail]]s, which they use to hop around.&lt;ref name=e42&gt;Egerton, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The musky rat-kangaroo is the smallest macropod and the only species that is quadrupedal not bipedal,&lt;ref&gt;Menkhorst and Knight, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; while the male [[red kangaroo]] is the largest, reaching a height of about 2&amp;nbsp;m and weighing up to 85&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name=&quot;Egerton, p. 44&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Menkhorst and Knight, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Placental mammals===
[[Image:Dingo2.jpg|220px|right|thumb|The [[dingo]] was the first placental mammal introduced to Australia by humans, around 4000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Menkhorst and Knight, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=e82&gt;Egerton, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Australia has indigenous placental mammals from two orders: the bats—order Chiroptera—represented by six families; and the mice and rats—order [[Rodent]]ia, family [[Muridae]]. There are only two endemic [[genus|genera]] of bats,&lt;ref name=e82/&gt; although 7% of the world's bat species live in Australia.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Rodents first arrived in Australia 5–10 MYA,&lt;ref name=e82/&gt; undergoing a wide radiation to produce the species collectively known as the &quot;old endemic&quot; rodents.&lt;ref name=e93&gt;Egerton, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The old endemics are represented by 14 extant genera.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} A million years ago, the [[rat]] entered Australia from [[New Guinea]] and evolved into seven species of ''Rattus'', collectively called the &quot;new endemics&quot;.&lt;ref name=e93/&gt;

Since human settlement many additional [[Placentalia|placental]] mammals have been introduced to Australia and are now [[feral]].&lt;ref name=e82/&gt; The first placental mammal introduced to Australia was the [[dingo]].&lt;ref name=e82/&gt; Fossil evidence suggests that people from the north brought the dingo to Australia about 5000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Savolainen | first1 = P. | display-authors = etal | year = 2004 | title = A detailed picture of the origin of the Australian dingo, obtained from the study of mitochondrial DNA | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 101 | issue = 33| pages = 12387–12390 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0401814101 | pmid = 15299143 | pmc=514485| bibcode = 2004PNAS..10112387S }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Europeans settled Australia they intentionally released many species into the wild including the [[red fox]], [[Cape hare|brown hare]], and the [[European rabbit]].&lt;ref name=e82/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, pp. 105–107.&lt;/ref&gt; Other domestic species have escaped and over time have produced wild populations including the [[banteng]], [[cat]], [[fallow deer]], [[red deer]], [[sambar deer]], [[rusa deer]], [[chital]], [[hog deer]], [[horse]], [[donkey]], [[Domestic pig|pig]], [[Domestic goat|goat]], [[water buffalo]], and the [[Dromedary|camel]].&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, pp. 106–110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Menkhorst and Knight, pp. 208–220.&lt;/ref&gt; Only three species of non-native placental mammal were not deliberately introduced to Australia: the [[house mouse]], [[black rat]] and the [[brown rat]].

Forty-six marine mammals from the order [[Cetacea]] are found in Australian coastal waters. Since the majority of these species have global distribution, some authors do not consider them to be Australian species. There are eleven species of [[baleen whale]] present; [[humpback whale]]s, [[southern right whale]]s, dwarf [[minke whale]]s and [[pygmy blue whale]]s are more commonly observed.&lt;ref&gt;Menkhorst and Knight, pp. 22, 240.&lt;/ref&gt; There are 37 species of toothed whale, which include all six genera of the family [[Beaked whale|Ziphiidae]], and 21 species of [[oceanic dolphin]], including the [[Australian snubfin dolphin]], a species first described in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=AAP|title=New species of Reef dolphin discovered|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/new-species-of-reef-dolphin-discovered/2005/07/04/1120329383156.html|access-date=7 January 2012|newspaper=The Age|date=5 July 2005|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207084927/http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/new-species-of-reef-dolphin-discovered/2005/07/04/1120329383156.html|archive-date=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some oceanic dolphins, such as the [[orca]], can be found in all waters around the continent; others, such as the [[Irrawaddy dolphin]], are confined to the warm northern waters.&lt;ref&gt;Menkhorst and Knight, pp. 224–234.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[dugong]] is an endangered marine species that inhabits the waters of north-eastern and north-western Australia, particularly the [[Torres Strait]].&lt;ref name=e82/&gt;&lt;ref name=m254/&gt; It can grow up to 3&amp;nbsp;m long and weigh as much as 400&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name=m254/&gt; The dugong is the only herbivorous marine mammal in Australia, feeding on [[sea grass]] in coastal areas.&lt;ref name=m254/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawler et al. 2002.

==Invasive species==
[[Image:Bufo marinus from Australia.JPG|thumb|The poisonous [[cane toad]]]]
{{Main|Invasive species in Australia}}
Introduction of exotic fauna in Australia by design, accident and natural processes has led to a considerable number of [[invasive species|invasive]], [[feral]] and [[pest (organism)|pest]] species which have flourished and now impact the environment adversely. Introduced organisms affect the environment in a number of ways. [[Rabbit]]s render land economically useless by eating everything.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Red fox]]es affect local [[endemic]] fauna by [[predation]] while the [[cane toad]] poisons the predators by being eaten.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, pp. 105, 389.&lt;/ref&gt; The invasive species include birds ([[Common mynah|Indian mynah]]) and fish ([[common carp]]), insects ([[red imported fire ant]]) and [[mollusc]]s ([[Asian mussel]]). The problem is compounded by invasive exotic [[flora]] as well as introduced diseases, fungi and parasites.

Costly, laborious and time-consuming efforts at control of these species has met with little success and this continues to be a major problem area in the conservation of Australia's biodiversity.

Many of the introduced species are not regulated through wildlife services and can be regularly hunted year round.

==Human impact and conservation==
{{Main|Conservation in Australia}}

For at least 40,000 years, Australia's fauna played an integral role in the traditional lifestyles of [[Indigenous Australians]], who relied upon many species as a source of food and skins. Vertebrates commonly harvested included macropods, possums, seals, fish and the [[short-tailed shearwater]], most commonly known as the muttonbird. Invertebrates used as food included insects such as the [[bogong moth]] and larvae collectively called [[witchetty grub]]s and molluscs. The use of [[fire-stick farming]], in which large swathes of bushland were burnt to facilitate hunting, modified both flora and fauna – and are thought to have contributed to the extinction of large herbivores with a specialised diet, such as the flightless birds from the genus ''[[Genyornis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = G.

Despite the major impact of Aboriginals on native species populations, this is considered to be less significant than that of the European settlers,&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson&quot;/&gt; whose impact on the landscape has been on a relatively large scale. Since European settlement, direct exploitation of native fauna, habitat destruction and the introduction of exotic predators and competitive herbivores has led to the extinction of some 27 mammal, 23 bird and 4 frog species. Much of Australia's fauna is protected by legislation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Egerton, p. 44&quot;/&gt; The federal [[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]] was created to meet Australia's obligations as a signatory to the 1992 [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]. This act protects all native fauna and provides for the identification and protection of [[threatened species]]. In each state and territory, there is statutory listing of threatened species. At present, 380 animal species are classified as either endangered or threatened under the EPBC Act, and other species are protected under state and territory legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Department of the Environment and Heritage (Australia)|Department of the Environment and Heritage]]. [http://www.deh.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicthreatenedlist.pl?wanted=fauna EPBC Act List of Threatened Fauna]&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, a complete cataloguing of all the species within Australia has been undertaken, a key step in the conservation of Australian fauna and biodiversity. In 1973, the federal government established the [[Australian Biological Resources Study]] (ABRS), which coordinates research in the taxonomy, identification, classification and distribution of flora and fauna. The ABRS maintains free online databases cataloguing much of the described Australian flora and fauna. Impacts such as the illegal setting of traps in rivers affect animals such as the Australian platypus, along with lack of awareness each year an average of 2–5 Australians lose their lives to what is presumed a safe creature. The key is understanding of Australia's diverse wildlife and fauna; what seems safe is often deadly.

The [[Australian Wildlife Conservancy]] is the largest private owner of land for conservation in the country which is dedicated to protecting endangered species across 4.8 million hectares of land in the most popular regions such as the Kimberley, Cape York, Lake Eyre and the Top End. This not-for-profit organisation is working hard to avoid extinction of the endangered native species in various wildlife sanctuaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.environment.gov.au/land/nrs/getting-involved/conservation-organisations/australian-wildlife-conservancy |title=Australian Wildlife Conservancy|website=Australian Government Department of the Environment And Energy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia is a member of the [[International Whaling Commission]] and is strongly opposed to commercial whaling—all cetacean species are protected in Australian waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/species/cetaceans/conservation/index.html |title=Whale Protection – How is Australia protecting whales? |publisher=Environment.gov.au |date=11 June 2010 |access-date=24 July 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811091037/http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/species/cetaceans/conservation/index.html |archive-date=11 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia is also a signatory to the [[Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna|CITES]] agreement and prohibits the export of endangered species. [[Protected areas of Australia|Protected areas]] have been created in every state and territory to protect and preserve the country's unique ecosystems. These protected areas include national parks and other reserves, as well as 64 wetlands registered under the [[Ramsar Convention]] and 16 [[World Heritage Site]]s. {{as of|2002}}, 10.8% (774,619.51&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of the total land area of Australia is within protected areas.&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Environment and Heritage. 2002.

The ''State of the Environment Report, 2001'', prepared by independent researchers for the federal government, concluded that the condition of the environment and environmental management in Australia had worsened since the previous report in 1996. Of particular relevance to wildlife conservation, the report indicated that many processes—such as [[Salinity in Australia|salinity]], changing hydrological conditions, land clearing, fragmentation of ecosystems, poor management of the coastal environment, and [[Invasive species in Australia|invasive species]]—pose major problems for protecting Australia's biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;Australian State of the Environment Committee. 2001.

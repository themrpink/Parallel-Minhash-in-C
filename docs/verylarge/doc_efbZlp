:&quot;If a choice is to be made between them, one is faced with the fact that the Tangun, with his supernatural origin, is more clearly a mythological figure than Kija.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; the account has played an important role in developing Korean national identity.
In the 12th century BCE, [[Jizi|Gija]], a prince from the [[Shang dynasty]] of China, purportedly founded [[Gija Joseon]]. However, due to contradicting historical and archaeological evidence, its existence was challenged in the 20th century, and today no longer forms the mainstream understanding of this period.

The historical Gojoseon kingdom was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE.{{sfn|Peterson|Margulies|2009|p=6}}&lt;ref name=&quot;naver1&quot;/&gt; By about the 4th century BCE, Gojoseon had developed to the point where its existence was well known in China,{{sfn|Eckert|Lee|1990|p=11}}{{sfn|Lee Ki-baik|1984|p=14}} and around this time, its capital moved to [[Pyongyang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|ko}} [http://enc.daum.net/dic100/contents.do?query1=b01g4157b001 Gojoseon territory] at Encyclopedia of Korean Culture&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/04/eak/ht04eak.htm Timeline of Art and History, Korea, 1000 BC-1 AD] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207003037/http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/04/eak/ht04eak.htm |date=2010-02-07 }}, Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chinese Rule====
In 108 BCE, the Chinese [[Han dynasty]] defeated [[Wiman Joseon]] and installed [[Four Commanderies of Han|four commanderies]] in the northern Korean peninsula. Three of the commanderies fell or retreated westward within a few decades, but the [[Lelang commandery]] remained as a center of cultural and economic exchange with successive Chinese dynasties for four centuries, until it was conquered by [[Goguryeo]] in 313 AD.

:&quot;Han Chinese built four commanderies, or local military units, to rule the peninsula as far south as the Han River, with a core area at Lolang (Nangnang in Korean), near present-day P'yongyang. It is illustrative of the relentlessly different historiography practiced in North Korea and South Korea, as well as both countries' dubious projection backward of Korean nationalism, that North Korean historians denied that the Lolang district was centered in Korea and placed it northwest of the peninsula, possibly near Beijing.&quot;

:&quot;When material evidence from the Han commandery site excavated during the colonial period began to be reinterpreted by Korean nationalist historians as the first full-fledged &quot;foreign&quot; occupation in Korean history, Lelang's location in the heart of the Korean peninsula became particularly irksome because the finds seemed to verify Japanese colonial theories concerning the dependency of Korean civilization on China.&quot;

:&quot;At present, the site of Lelang and surrounding ancient Han Chinese remains are situated in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang. Although North Korean scholars have continued to excavate Han dynasty tombs in the postwar period, they have interpreted them as manifestations of the Kochoson or the Koguryo kingdom.&quot;

:&quot;Lelang Commandery was crucial to understanding the early history of Korea, which lasted from 108 BCE to 313 CE around the Pyongyang area. However, because of its nature as a Han colony and the exceptional attention paid to it by Japanese colonial scholars for making claims of the innate heteronomy of Koreans, post 1945 Korean scholars intentionally avoided the issue of Lelang.&quot;

:&quot;But when Emperor Wu conquered Choson, all the small barbarian tribes in the northeastern region were incorporated into the established Han commanderies because of the overwhelming military might of Han China.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt;]]

====Jin State====
Around 300 BCE, a state called [[Jin (Korean history)|Jin]] arose in the southern part of the Korean peninsula. Very little is known about Jin, but it established relations with Han China and exported artifacts to the [[Yayoi]] of [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/history/worldhistory/yayoi-period-ema-06/ Yayoi Period History Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726001937/http://www.bookrags.com/history/worldhistory/yayoi-period-ema-06/ |date=2008-07-26 }}, BookRags.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.gol.com/users/hsmr/Content/East%20Asia/Japan/History/roots.html Japanese Roots] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120525105448/http://www2.gol.com/users/hsmr/Content/East%20Asia/Japan/History/roots.html |date=2012-05-25 }}, Jared Diamond, ''Discover'' 19:6 (June 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/japanorigin.htm The Genetic Origins of the Japanese] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209135625/http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/japanorigin.htm |date=2016-02-09 }}, Thayer Watkins&lt;/ref&gt; Around 100 BCE, Jin evolved into the [[Samhan]] confederacies.{{sfn|Lee Hyun-hee|2005|pp= 92–95}}

Many smaller states sprang from the former territory of Gojoseon such as [[Buyeo]], [[Okjeo]], [[Dongye]], [[Goguryeo]], and [[Baekje]]. The [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] refer to [[Goguryeo]], [[Baekje]], and [[Silla]], although Buyeo and the [[Gaya confederacy]] existed into the 5th and 6th centuries respectively.

====Metallurgy====
The [[Bronze Age]] is often held to have begun around 900-800 BCE in Korea,&lt;ref name=&quot;Connor&quot; /&gt; though the transition to the Bronze Age may have begun as far back as 2300 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kim and Bae&quot; /&gt; Bronze daggers, mirrors, jewelry, and weaponry have been found, as well as evidence of walled-town polities. Rice, red beans, soybeans and millet were cultivated, and rectangular pit-houses and increasingly larger [[dolmen]] burial sites are found throughout the peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/977 Gochang, Hwasun and Ganghwa Dolmen Sites] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218153900/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/977/ |date=2017-02-18 }}, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporaneous records suggest that Gojoseon transitioned from a feudal federation of walled cities into a centralised kingdom at least before the 4th-century BCE.{{sfn|Lee Hyun-hee|2005|pp= 82–85}} It is believed that by the 4th century BCE, [[Iron Age|iron culture]] was developing in Korea by northern influence via today's Russia's Maritime Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251565346|title=Large-scale 2nd to 3rd century AD bloomery iron smelting in Korea}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wontack Hong, &quot;The Yemaek Tungus of Central Manchuria and Korean Peninsula: Interactions between the Xianbei and the Yemaek Tungus&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proto–Three Kingdoms===

[[File:평양 석암리 금제교구.jpg|200px|thumb|Gold buckle of the [[Proto–Three Kingdoms of Korea|Proto–Three Kingdoms]] period]]

The Proto-Three Kingdoms period, sometimes called the Several States Period (열국시대),&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|ko}} [http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=120316 Proto-Three Kingdoms period] at [[Doosan Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; is the time before the rise of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], which included [[Goguryeo]], [[Silla]], and [[Baekje]], and occurred after the fall of [[Gojoseon]]. This time period consisted of numerous states that sprang up from the former territories of Gojoseon. Among these states, the largest and most influential were [[Dongbuyeo]] and [[Bukbuyeo]].

====Buyeo and other Northern states====
{{Main|Buyeo|Okjeo|Dongye}}

After the fall of [[Gojoseon]], [[Buyeo]] arose in today's [[North Korea]] and southern [[Manchuria]], from about the 2nd century BCE to 494. Its remnants were absorbed by [[Goguryeo]] in 494, and both Goguryeo and [[Baekje]], two of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], considered themselves its successor.{{sfn|Lee Hyun-hee|2005|pp= 109–116}}

Although records are sparse and contradictory, it is thought that in 86 BCE, [[Dongbuyeo]] (East Buyeo) branched out, after which the original Buyeo is sometimes referred to as [[Bukbuyeo]] (North Buyeo). [[Jolbon|Jolbon Buyeo]] was the predecessor to [[Goguryeo]], and in 538, Baekje renamed itself ''Nambuyeo'' (South Buyeo).&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|ko}} [http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=254242&amp;v=43 Buyeo] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120701173656/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=254242&amp;v=43 |date=2012-07-01 }} at Encyclopedia of Korean Culture&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Okjeo]] was a tribal-state that was located in the northern [[Korean Peninsula]], and was established after the fall of Gojoseon. Okjeo had been a part of [[Gojoseon]] before its fall. It never became a fully developed kingdom due to the intervention of its neighboring kingdoms. Okjeo became a tributary of Goguryeo, and was eventually annexed into Goguryeo by [[Gwanggaeto the Great of Goguryeo|Gwanggaeto Taewang]] in the 5th century.{{sfn|Lee Hyun-hee|2005|pp= 128–130}}

[[Dongye]] was another small kingdom that was situated in the northern [[Korean Peninsula]]. Dongye bordered [[Okjeo]], and the two kingdoms faced the same fate of becoming tributaries of the growing empire of [[Goguryeo]]. Dongye was also a former part of [[Gojoseon]] before its fall.{{sfn|Lee Hyun-hee|2005|pp= 130–131}}

====Samhan====
{{Main|Samhan|Mahan confederacy|Jinhan confederacy|Byeonhan confederacy}}

Sam-han (삼한, 三韓) refers to the three confederacies of [[Mahan confederacy|Mahan]], [[Jinhan]], and [[Byeonhan]]. The Samhan were located in the southern region of the [[Korean Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|ko}} [http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=86824 Samhan] at [[Doosan Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Samhan countries were strictly governed by law, with religion playing an important role. Mahan was the largest, consisting of 54 states, and assumed political, economic, and cultural dominance. Byeonhan and Jinhan both consisted of 12 states, bringing a total of 78 states within the Samhan. The Samhan were eventually conquered by [[Baekje]], [[Silla]], and [[Gaya confederacy|Gaya]] in the 4th century.{{sfn|Lee Hyun-hee|2005|pp= 135–141}}

[[Goguryeo]] was founded in 37 BCE by [[Dongmyeongseong of Goguryeo|Jumong]] (posthumously titled as Dongmyeongseong, a royal given title).&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|ko}} [http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=12449 Goguryeo] at [[Doosan Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Taejo of Goguryeo|King Taejo]] centralized the government.

Goguryeo (also spelled as ''Koguryŏ'') was also known as Goryeo (also spelled as ''Koryŏ''), and it eventually became the source of the modern name of Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Fan Ye, ''Book of the Later Han'', volume 85; the ''Dongyi Liezhuan''&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3rd and 4th centuries were characterized by territorial competition with the Chinese and Xianbei, resulting in both losses and gains. Goguryeo initiated the [[Goguryeo–Wei War]] by attacking a Chinese fortress in 242 in an attempt to cut off Chinese access to its territories in Korea. [[Cao Wei]] of the [[Three Kingdoms|Three Kingdoms of China]] retaliated by invading and destroying [[Hwando]] in 244. This forced the king to flee with Cao Wei in pursuit and broke Goguryeo's rule over the Okjeo and Ye, damaging its economy. The king eventually settled in a new capital, and Goguryeo focused on rebuilding and regaining control. In the early 4th century Goguryeo once again attacked the Chinese (now [[Sima Jin]]) to cut off their access to Korea and this time succeeded, and soon afterward conquered Lelang and Daifang ending the Chinese presence in Korea. However Goguryeo's expansion led to confrontation with the rising Xianbeis. The Xianbeis devastated Goguryeo's capital in the mid 4th century and the king retreated. Goguryeo eventually regrouped and began striking back in the late 4th century by King Gogukyang, culminating with the conquests of Gwanggaeto the Great.&lt;ref name=tennant&gt;{{cite book |year=1996|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlGnq9flYdMC&amp;pg=PA22 |isbn=0-7103-0532-X |publisher=Kegan Paul International|title=A history of Korea|author=Charles Roger Tennant |authorlink = Roger Tennant|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;byington93-96&quot;&gt;Byington, Mark E.

The Sui emperor, Wen Ti, launched a retaliatory attack on Koguryŏ but met with reverses and turned back in mid-course. Yang Ti, the next Sui emperor, proceeded in 612 to mount an invasion of unprecedented magnitude, marshalling a huge force said to number over a million men. And when his armies failed to take Liao-tung Fortress (modern Liao-yang), the anchor of Koguryŏ's first line of defense, he had a nearly a third of his forces, some 300,000 strong, break off the battle there and strike directly at the Koguryŏ capital of P'yŏngyang. But the Sui army was lured into a trap by the famed Koguryŏ commander Ŭlchi Mundŏk, and suffered a calamitous defeat at the Salsu (Ch'ŏngch'ŏn) River. It is said that only 2,700 of the 300,000 Sui soldiers who had crossed the Yalu survived to find their way back, and the Sui emperor now lifted the siege of Liao-tung Fortress and withdrew his forces to China proper. Yang Ti continued to send his armies against Koguryŏ but again without success, and before long his war-weakened empire crumbled. |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161204081948/https://books.google.com/books?id=g2mdVwXpMzwC&amp;pg=PA47 |archivedate=December 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nahm&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nahm|first1=Andrew C.|title=A Panorama of 5000 Years: Korean History|date=2005|publisher=Hollym International Corporation|location=Seoul|isbn=978-0930878689|page=[https://archive.org/details/panoramaof5000ye0000nahm/page/18 18]|edition=Second revised|quote=China, which had been split into many states since the early 3rd century, was reunified by the Sui dynasty at the end of the 6th century.

In 612, Sui troops invaded Korea again, but Koguryŏ forces fought bravely and destroyed Sui troops everywhere. General Ŭlchi Mundŏk of Koguryŏ completely wiped out some 300,000 Sui troops which came across the Yalu River in the battles near the Salsu River (now Ch'ŏngch'ŏn River) with his ingenious military tactics.

After the collapse of Goguryeo, Tang and Silla ended their alliance and fought over control of the [[Korean Peninsula]]. Silla succeeded in gaining control over most of the Korean Peninsula, while Tang gained control over Goguryeo's northern territories. However, 30 years after the fall of Goguryeo, a Goguryeo general by the name of [[Dae Joyeong]] founded the Korean-Mohe state of [[Balhae]] and successfully expelled the Tang presence from much of the former Goguryeo territories.

It expanded into the southwest ([[Chungcheong]] and [[Jeolla]] provinces) of the peninsula and became a significant political and military power. In the process, Baekje came into fierce confrontation with Goguryeo and the Chinese commanderies in the vicinity of its territorial ambitions.

At its peak in the 4th century during the reign of [[Geunchogo of Baekje|King Geunchogo]], Baekje absorbed all of the Mahan states and subjugated most of the western Korean peninsula (including the modern provinces of [[Gyeonggi]], [[Chungcheong]], and [[Jeolla]], as well as part of [[Hwanghae]] and [[Gangwon-do (South Korea)|Gangwon]]) to a centralized government. Baekje acquired Chinese culture and technology through maritime contacts with the [[Southern dynasties]] during the expansion of its territory.{{sfn|Lee Hyun-hee|2005|pp= 202–206}}

According to legend, the kingdom of [[Silla]] began with the unification of six chiefdoms of the [[Jinhan confederacy]] by [[Bak Hyeokgeose]] in 57 BCE, in the southeastern area of Korea. Its territory included the present-day port city of [[Busan]], and Silla later emerged as a sea power responsible for destroying Japanese pirates, especially during the [[Unified Silla]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth B. Lee (1997, pp. 48–49)&lt;/ref&gt;

Silla artifacts, including unique gold metalwork, show influence from the northern nomadic steppes and [[Iranian peoples]] and especially [[Persian people|Persians]], with less Chinese influence than are shown by Goguryeo and Baekje.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah M. Nelson, (1993, pp. 243–258)&lt;/ref&gt;  Silla expanded rapidly by occupying the [[Nakdong River]] basin and uniting the city-states.

By the 2nd century, Silla was a large state, occupying and influencing nearby city-states. Silla gained further power when it annexed the [[Gaya confederacy]] in 562. Silla often faced pressure from Goguryeo, Baekje and Japan, and at various times allied and warred with Baekje and [[Goguryeo]].

Silla was the smallest and weakest of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], but it used cunning diplomatic means to make opportunistic pacts and alliances with the more powerful Korean kingdoms, and eventually Tang China, to its great advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kim |first1=Jinwung |title=A History of Korea: From &quot;Land of the Morning Calm&quot; to States in Conflict |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0253000248 |pages=44–45 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s2EVi-MpnUsC&amp;pg=PA44 |language=en |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161204004100/https://books.google.com/books?id=s2EVi-MpnUsC&amp;pg=PA44 |archivedate=2016-12-04 |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wells |first1=Kenneth M. |title=Korea: Outline of a Civilisation |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9789004300057 |pages=18–19 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6zoLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18 |accessdate=12 September 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203232114/https://books.google.com/books?id=6zoLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18 |archivedate=3 December 2016 |date=2015-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 660, King [[Muyeol of Silla]] ordered his armies to attack Baekje. General [[Kim Yu-shin]], aided by [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] forces, conquered Baekje. In 661, Silla and Tang moved on [[Goguryeo]] but were repelled. King [[Munmu of Silla|Munmu]], son of Muyeol and nephew of Kim, launched another campaign in 667 and Goguryeo fell in the following year.{{sfn|Lee Hyun-hee|2005|pp= 222–225}}

===Gaya===
{{Main|Gaya confederacy}}

[[Gaya Confederacy|Gaya]] was a confederacy of small kingdoms in the [[Nakdong River]] valley of southern [[Korea]], growing out of the [[Byeonhan confederacy]] of the [[Samhan]] period. Gaya's plains were rich in iron, so export of iron tools was possible and agriculture flourished. In the early centuries, the Confederacy was led by [[Geumgwan Gaya]] in the [[Gimhae]] region. However, its leading power changed to [[Daegaya]] in the [[Goryeong]] region after the 5th century.

Constantly engaged in war with the three kingdoms surrounding it, Gaya was not developed to form a unified state, and was ultimately absorbed into [[Silla]] in 562.{{sfn|Lee Hyun-hee|2005|pp= 159–162}}

==North and South States==
{{Main|North–South States Period}}

The term North-South States refers to [[Later Silla|Unifed Silla]] and [[Balhae]], during the time when Silla controlled the majority of the Korean peninsula while Balhae expanded into [[Manchuria]]. During this time, culture and technology significantly advanced, especially in Unifed Silla.

===Unified Silla===

After the unification wars, the [[Tang dynasty]] established outposts in the former [[Goguryeo]], and began to establish and administer communities in [[Baekje]]. Silla attacked Tang forces in Baekje and northern Korea in 671. Tang then invaded Silla in 674 but Silla drove the Tang forces out of the peninsula by 676 to achieve unification of most of the Korean peninsula.{{sfn|Lee Hyun-hee|2005|pp= 241–242}}

This is a historical fact of considerable significance but one which has received virtually no attention in the standard historical compilations of that period or in the modern books based on these sources. . . . While there were limits to the influence of the Koreans along the eastern coast of China, there can be no doubt of their dominance over the waters off these shores. . . .

Silla began to experience political troubles in late 8th century. This severely weakened Silla and soon thereafter, descendants of the former Baekje established [[Hubaekje]]. In the north, rebels revived Goguryeo, beginning the [[Later Three Kingdoms]] period.

Unifed Silla lasted for 267 years until [[Gyeongsun of Silla|King Gyeongsun]] surrendered the country to [[Goryeo]] in 935, after 992 years and 56 monarchs.{{sfn|Lee Hyun-hee|2005|pp= 266–269}}

In 2009, Toronto-based, American-born poet [[Damian Rogers]] released her first volume of poetry, ''Paper Radio''.  The lifestyle and philosophy of the Shakers and their matriarch Ann Lee are recurring themes in her work.

==Education==
[[File:A Shaker School.jpg|thumb|A Shaker School, ''The Communistic Societies of the United States, by Charles Nordhoff,'' 1875]]
New Lebanon, New York, Shakers began keeping school in 1815. Certified as a public school by the state of New York beginning in 1817, the teachers operated on the [[Lancastrian system]], which was considered advanced for its time. Boys attended class during the winter and the girls in the summer. The first Shaker schools taught reading, spelling, oration, arithmetic and manners, but later diversified their coursework to include music, algebra, astronomy, and agricultural chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac N. Youngs, Concise View of the Church of God, Winterthur Museum Library Andrews Shaker Collection ms. 861, p.355, 366–74. Some Shaker school records are extant. For Mount Lebanon, NY, see: Isaac N. Youngs et al., Memorandum of the Proceedings of the School (1817–35), Shaker Museum | Mount Lebanon ms. 10,469; Calvin Reed, Sarah Bates, Polly Reed, William Calver, Amelia Calver, Anna Dodgson, [New Lebanon School Journal] (1852–87), Hancock Shaker Village library, ms. 9758.&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-Shaker parents respected the Shakers' schooling so much that they often took advantage of schools that the Shaker villages provided, sending their children there for an education. State inspectors and other outsiders visited the schools and made favorable comments on teachers and students.&lt;ref&gt;Glendyne R. Wergland, ''One Shaker Life: Isaac Newton Youngs, 1793–1865'' (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 2006), chapter 2; Glendyne R. Wergland, ''Sisters in the Faith: Shaker Women and Equality of the Sexes'' (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 2011), chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern-day Shakers==
[[File:Sabbathday Lake Dwelling House.jpg|thumb|The dwelling house at [[Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village]], the only active Shaker community, located in New Gloucester, Maine]]
Turnover was high; the group reached maximum size of about 5,000 full members in 1840,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hauffe |first=Thomas |title=Design: An Illustrated Historical Overview |location=Koln|publisher=DuMont Buchverlag |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 6,000 believers at the peak of the Shaker movement. The Shaker communities continued to lose members, partly through attrition, since believers did not give birth to children, and also due to economics; hand-made products by Shakers were not as competitive as mass-produced products and individuals moved to the cities for better livelihoods. There were only 12 Shaker communities left by 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Priscilla Brewer, &quot;Demographic Features of the Shaker Decline, 1787–1900,&quot; Journal of Interdisciplinary History 15.1 (summer 1984):31–52; Stein, ''Shaker Experience in America'', 337–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, after &quot;months of prayer&quot;, Eldresses Gertrude, Emma, and Ida, leaders of the United Society of Believers in [[Canterbury Shaker Village]], voted to close the Shaker Covenant, the document which all new members need to sign to become members of the Shakers.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&amp;dat=19881217&amp;id=JnghAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=877,4794790&amp;hl=en|title = Vanishing Shakers leave lasting legacy|last = Hillinger|first = Charles|date = December 17, 1988|work = Schenectady Gazette|access-date = February 22, 2016|via = Google Newspapers}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, speaking about the three men and women in their 20s and 30s who had become Shakers and were living in the [[Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village]], Eldress Bertha Lindsay of the other community, the Canterbury Shaker Village, disputed their membership in the society: &quot;To become a Shaker you have to sign a legal document taking the necessary vows and that document, the official covenant, is locked up in our safe. Membership is closed forever.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

However, Shaker covenants lack a &quot;[[sunset clause]]&quot; and today's Shakers of [[Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village]] welcome sincere new converts to Shakerism into the society:&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams2015&quot;/&gt;
{{quotation|If someone wants to become a Shaker, and the Shakers assent, the would-be member can move into the dwelling house. If the novices, as they are called, stay a week, they sign an articles of agreement, which protects the colony from being sued for lost wages. After a year, the Shakers will take a vote whether to allow the novice in, but it takes another four years to be granted full Shaker status in sharing in the colony's finances and administrative and worship decisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams2015&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/5/3/last-shakers-hope-novice-can-revive-communal-society.html|title=A few good Shakers wanted|last=Williams|first=Kevin|date=3 May 2015|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|language=en|access-date=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{As of|2017}}, the remaining active Shaker community in the United States, [[Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village]] in [[New Gloucester, Maine]], has three members: Brother Arnold Hadd, Sister June Carpenter, and Brother Andrew.&lt;ref name=&quot;home notes&quot; /&gt; Sister Frances Carr died on January 2, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Sister-Frances-Carr-one-of-last-three-Shakers-10831363.php|title=Sister Frances Carr, one of last three Shakers, has died|last=Crowe II|first=Kenneth C.|date=January 3, 2017|newspaper=[[Times Union (Albany)|Times Union]]|access-date=January 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being open to individuals joining their community, the Shakers receive about two inquiries a week.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chiorazzi2017&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bustedhalo.com/features/the-last-of-the-shakers|title=The Last of the Shakers|last=Chiorazzi|first=Anthony|date=13 April 2010|publisher=Busted Halo|language=en|access-date=28 August 2018|quote=Hadd and the other Shakers are not giving up.

His teachings challenged the existing traditions of the [[Indo-Iranians#Religion|Indo-Iranian religion]] and inaugurated a movement that eventually became the dominant religion in [[Ancient Persia]].

==Name and etymology==
Zoroaster's name in his native language, [[Avestan]], was probably ''Zaraϑuštra''. His English name, &quot;Zoroaster&quot;, derives from a later (5th century BC) [[Greek language|Greek]] transcription, ''Zōroastrēs'' ({{lang|grc|Ζωροάστρης}}),&lt;ref name=&quot;Schlerath_1977_133_135&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Schlerath|1977|pp=133–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; as used in [[Xanthus (historian)|Xanthus]]'s ''[[Xanthus (historian)#Lydiaca|Lydiaca]]'' (Fragment 32) and in [[Plato]]'s ''[[First Alcibiades]]'' (122a1). This form appears subsequently in the Latin ''{{lang|la|Zōroastrēs}}'' and, in later Greek orthographies, as Ζωροάστρις ''Zōroastris''. The Greek form of the name appears to be based on a phonetic transliteration or semantic substitution of Avestan ''zaraϑ-'' with the Greek ζωρός ''zōros'' (literally &quot;undiluted&quot;) and the Avestan ''-uštra'' with ἄστρον ''astron'' (&quot;[[star]]&quot;).

In Avestan, ''Zaraϑuštra'' is generally accepted to derive from an Old Iranian ''*Zaratuštra-''; The element half of the name (''-uštra-'') is thought to be the Indo-Iranian root for &quot;camel&quot;, with the entire name meaning &quot;he who can manage camels&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Schmitt_2003&quot;/&gt;{{Ref label|ushtra_camel|a|none}}
Reconstructions from later Iranian languages—particularly from the [[Iranian languages#Middle Iranian languages|Middle Persian]] (300 BCE) ''Zardusht'',{{explain|date=October 2015}} which is the form that the name took in the 9th- to 12th-century Zoroastrian texts—suggest that ''*Zaratuštra-'' might be a [[Indo-European ablaut#Zero grade|zero-grade]] form of ''*Zarantuštra-''.&lt;ref name = &quot;Schmitt_2003&quot;/&gt;
Subject then to whether ''Zaraϑuštra'' derives from ''*Zarantuštra-'' or from ''*Zaratuštra-'', several interpretations have been proposed.{{Ref label|name_contra|b|none}}

If ''Zarantuštra'' is the original form, it may mean
&quot;with old/aging camels&quot;,&lt;ref name = &quot;Schmitt_2003&quot;/&gt; related to [[Avestan language|Avestic]] ''zarant-''&lt;ref name = &quot;Schlerath_1977_133_135&quot;/&gt; (''cf.'' [[Pashto]] ''zōṛ'' and [[Ossetian language|Ossetian]] ''zœrond'', &quot;old&quot;; Middle Persian ''zāl'', &quot;old&quot;):&lt;ref&gt;Paul Horn, Grundriß der neupersischen Etymologie, Strassburg 1893&lt;/ref&gt;
* &quot;with angry/furious camels&quot;: from Avestan ''*zarant-'', &quot;angry, furious&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayrhofer_1977_43_53&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Mayrhofer|1977|pp=43–53}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* &quot;who is driving camels&quot; or &quot;who is fostering/cherishing camels&quot;: related to Avestan ''zarš-'', &quot;to drag&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey_1953_40_42&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bailey|1953|pp=40–42}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mayrhofer (1977) proposed an etymology of &quot;who is desiring camels&quot; or &quot;longing for camels&quot; and related to [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''har-'', &quot;to like&quot;, and perhaps (though ambiguous) also to Avestan ''zara-''.&lt;ref name = &quot;Mayrhofer_1977_43_53&quot;/&gt;
* &quot;with yellow camels&quot;: parallel to [[Younger Avestan]] ''zairi-''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Markwart_1930_7ff&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Markwart|1930|pp=7ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The interpretation of the ''-ϑ-'' ({{IPA|/θ/}}) in Avestan ''zaraϑuštra'' was for a time itself subjected to heated debate because the ''-ϑ-'' is an irregular development: As a rule, ''*zarat-'' (a first element that ends in a [[dental consonant]]) should have Avestan ''zarat-'' or ''zarat̰-'' as a development from it. Why this is not so for ''zaraϑuštra'' has not yet been determined. Notwithstanding the phonetic irregularity, that Avestan ''zaraϑuštra'' with its ''-ϑ-'' was linguistically an actual form is shown by later attestations reflecting the same basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmitt_2003&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Schmitt|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; All present-day, Iranian-language variants of his name derive from the Middle Iranian variants of ''Zarϑošt'', which, in turn, all reflect Avestan's fricative ''-ϑ-''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Date==
There is no consensus on the dating of Zoroaster; the Avesta gives no direct information about it, while historical sources are conflicting. Some scholars base their date reconstruction on the [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language]] and [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyce Intro&quot;/&gt; and thus it is considered to have been some place in northeastern Iran and some time between 1500 and 500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1996|pp=3, 189–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stausberg|Vevaina|Tessmann|2015|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NigosianDate&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Nigosian|1993|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ShahbaziAb&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Shahbazi|1977|pp=25–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Lincoln|1991|pp=149–150}}: &quot;At present, the majority opinion among scholars probably inclines toward the end of the second millennium or the beginning of the first, although there are still those who hold for a date in the seventh century.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Mary Boyce]] (who dated Zoroaster to somewhere between 1700–1000 BC) used linguistic and socio-cultural evidence to place Zoroaster between 1500 and 1000 BC (or 1200 and 900 BC).&lt;ref name=&quot;West Dating&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ShahbaziAb&quot;/&gt; The basis of this theory is primarily proposed on linguistic similarities between the [[Avestan language|Old Avestan language]] of the Zoroastrian [[Gathas]] and the [[Vedic Sanskrit|Sanskrit]] of the [[Rigveda]] (c. 1700–1100 BC), a collection of early Vedic hymns. Both texts are considered to have a common archaic Indo-Iranian origin. The Gathas portray an ancient [[Stone Age|Stone]]-[[Bronze Age#Iranian Plateau|Bronze Age]] bipartite society of warrior-herdsmen and priests (compared to Bronze [[Trifunctional hypothesis|tripartite society]]; some conjecture that it depicts the [[Yaz culture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=J. P.|last1=Mallory|author2-link=Douglas Q. Adams|first2=Douglas Q.|last2=Adams|title=Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tzU3RIV2BWIC|year=1997|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|pages=310–311, 653|isbn=978-1-884964-98-5|author1-link=J. P. Mallory}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and thus it is implausible that the Gathas and Rigveda could have been composed more than a few centuries apart. These scholars suggest that Zoroaster lived in an isolated tribe or composed the Gathas before the 1200–1000 BC migration by the Iranians from the steppe to the [[Iranian Plateau]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyce Background96&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1982|pp=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;West Dating&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|2010|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stausberg|2008|p=572}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shortfall of the argument is the vague comparison, and the archaic language of Gathas does not necessarily indicate time difference.&lt;ref name=&quot;WestDate13&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NigosianDate&quot;/&gt;

Other scholars&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt; propose a period between 7th and 6th century, for example, c. 650–600 BC or 559–522 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;NigosianDate&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ShahbaziAb&quot;/&gt; The latest possible date is the mid 6th century, at the time of [[Achaemenid Empire]]'s [[Darius I]], or his predecessor [[Cyrus the Great]]. This date gains credence mainly on the thesis that certain figures must be based on historical facts,&lt;ref name=&quot;ShahbaziAb&quot;/&gt; thus some have related the mythical [[Vishtaspa]] with Darius I's father Vishtaspa (or [[Hystaspes (father of Darius I)|Hystaspes]] in Greek) with the account on Zoroaster's life. However, in the Avesta it should not be ignored that Vishtaspa's son became the ruler of the Persian Empire, Darius I would not neglect to include his patron-father in the [[Behistun Inscription]]. A different proposed conclusion is that Darius I's father was named in honor of the Zoroastrian patron, indicating possible Zoroastrian faith by [[Arsames]].&lt;ref name=&quot;West 2010 6&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|West|2010|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical scholarship in the 6th to 4th century BC believed he existed six thousand years before [[Xerxes I]]'s invasion of Greece in 480 BCE ([[Xanthus (historian)|Xanthus]], [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]], [[Aristotle]], [[Hermippus]]), which is a possible misunderstanding of the Zoroastrian four cycles of 3000 years i.e. 12,000 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;WestDate13&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stausberg|Vevaina|Tessmann|2015|p=441}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1982|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1996|pp=285–292}}&lt;/ref&gt; This belief is recorded by [[Diogenes Laërtius]], and variant readings could place it six hundred years before Xerxes I, somewhere before 1000 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;NigosianDate&quot;/&gt; However, Diogenes also mentions [[Hermodorus|Hermodorus's]] belief that Zoroaster lived five thousand years before the [[Trojan War]], which would mean he lived around 6200 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;NigosianDate&quot;/&gt; The 10th-century [[Suda]] provides a date of &quot;500 years before [[Plato]]&quot; in the late 10th century BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;WestDate13&quot;/&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]] cited Eudoxus who also placed his death six thousand years before Plato, c. 6300 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;NigosianDate&quot;/&gt; Other pseudo-historical constructions are those of [[Aristoxenus]] who recorded Zaratas the [[Chaldea]]ean to have taught [[Pythagoras]] in [[Babylon]],&lt;ref name=&quot;WestDate13&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuplin2007&quot;/&gt; or lived at the time of mythological [[Ninus]] and [[Semiramis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|2010|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pliny the Elder, there were two Zoroasters. The first lived thousands of years ago, while the second accompanied Xerxes I in the invasion of Greece in 480 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;WestDate13&quot;/&gt; Some scholars propose that the chronological calculation for Zoroaster was developed by Persian [[magi]] in the 4th century BC, and as the early Greeks learned about him from the Achaemenids, this indicates they did not regard him as a contemporary of Cyrus the Great, but as a remote figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1982|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some later pseudo-historical and Zoroastrian sources (the ''[[Bundahishn]]'', which references a date &quot;258 years before Alexander&quot;) place Zoroaster in the 6th century BC,{{Ref label|name_contra|d|none}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stausberg|Vevaina|Tessmann|2015|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which coincided with the accounts by [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] from 4th century CE. The traditional Zoroastrian date originates in the period immediately following [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 330 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;NigosianDate&quot;/&gt; The [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] rulers who gained power following Alexander's death instituted an &quot;Age of Alexander&quot; as the new calendrical epoch. This did not appeal to the Zoroastrian priesthood who then attempted to establish an &quot;Age of Zoroaster&quot;. To do so, they needed to establish when Zoroaster had lived, which they accomplished by (erroneous, some even identified Cyrus with Vishtaspa&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1982|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;) counting back the length of successive generations, until they concluded that Zoroaster must have lived &quot;258 years before Alexander&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WestDate13&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shahbazi_1977_25_26&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Shahbazi|1977|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This estimate then re-appeared in the 9th- to 12th-century Arabic and Pahlavi texts of Zoroastrian tradition,{{Ref label|258Masudi|c|none}} like the 10th century [[Al-Masudi]] who cited a prophecy from a lost Avestan book in which Zoroaster foretold the Empire's destruction in three hundred years, but the religion would last for a thousand years.&lt;ref name=&quot;West 2010 6&quot;/&gt;

The birthplace of Zoroaster is also unknown, and the language of the Gathas is not similar to the proposed north-western and north-eastern regional dialects of Persia. It is also suggested that he was born in one of the two areas and later lived in the other area.&lt;ref name=&quot;NigosianPlace&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Nigosian|1993|pp=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Yasna'' 9 and 17 cite the Ditya River in [[Airyanem Vaejah|Airyanem Vaējah]] ([[Middle Persian]] ''Ērān Wēj'') as Zoroaster's home and the scene of his first appearance. The [[Avesta]] (both Old and Younger portions) does not mention the Achaemenids or of any West Iranian tribes such as the [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], or even [[Parthia]]ns. The ''[[Fravashi|Farvardin Yasht]]'' refers to some Iranian peoples that are unknown in the Greek and Achaemenid sources about the 6th and 5th century BC Eastern Iran. The ''[[Vendidad]]'' contain seventeen regional names, most of which are located in north-eastern and eastern Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1996|pp=190–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in ''Yasna'' 59.18, the ''zaraϑuštrotema'', or supreme head of the Zoroastrian priesthood, is said to reside in 'Ragha' ([[Badakhshan]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;West Birthplace-Surname&quot;/&gt; In the 9th- to 12th-century Middle Persian texts of Zoroastrian tradition, this 'Ragha' and with many other places appear as locations in Western Iran. While the land of Media does not figure at all in the Avesta (the westernmost location noted in scripture is [[Arachosia]]), the ''[[Bundahishn|Būndahišn]]'', or &quot;Primordial Creation,&quot; (20.32 and 24.15) puts Ragha in [[Medes|Media]] (medieval [[Ray, Iran|Rai]]). However, in Avestan, Ragha is simply a toponym meaning &quot;plain, hillside.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gershevitch_1964_36_37&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gershevitch|1964|pp=36–37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from these indications in [[Middle Persian]] sources that are open to interpretations, there are a number of other sources. The Greek and Latin sources are divided on the birthplace of Zarathustra. There are many Greek accounts of Zarathustra, referred usually as Persian or Perso-Median Zoroaster; [[Ctesias]] located him in [[Bactria]], [[Diodorus Siculus]] placed him among Ariaspai (in [[Sistan]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;West Birthplace-Surname&quot;/&gt; [[Cephalion (historian)|Cephalion]] and [[Justin (historian)|Justin]] suggest east of [[greater Iran]] whereas [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Origen]] suggest west of Iran as his birthplace.&lt;ref name=&quot;NigosianPlace&quot;/&gt; Moreover, they have the suggestion that there has been more than one Zoroaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=William Enfield |author2=Johann Jakob Brucker |author3=Knud Haakonssen |title=The History of Philosophy from the Earliest Periods: Drawn Up from Brucker's Historia Critica Philosophia |publisher=Thoemmes |year=2001 |isbn=1-85506-828-1 |pages=18, 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, in post-Islamic sources [[Al-Shahrastani|Shahrastani]] (1086–1153) an [[Iranian people|Iranian]] writer originally from Shahristān, present-day [[Turkmenistan]], proposed that Zoroaster's father was from [[Atropatene]] (also in Medea) and his mother was from [[Rey, Iran|Rey]]. Coming from a reputed scholar of religions, this was a serious blow for the various regions who all claimed that Zoroaster originated from ''their'' homelands, some of which then decided that Zoroaster must then have then been buried in their regions or composed his Gathas there or preached there.&lt;ref name=&quot;cf_Boyce_1975_2_26&quot;&gt;''cf.'' {{harvnb|Boyce|1996|pp=2–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cf_Gronke_1993_59_60&quot;&gt;''cf.'' {{harvnb|Gronke|1993|pp=59–60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also Arabic sources of the same period and the same region of historical Persia consider [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]] as the birthplace of Zarathustra.&lt;ref name=&quot;NigosianPlace&quot;/&gt;

By the late 20th century, most scholars had settled on an origin in eastern [[Greater Iran]]. Gnoli proposed [[Sistan]], [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Baluchistan]] (though in a much wider scope than the present-day province) as the homeland of Zoroastrianism; Frye voted for [[Bactria]] and [[Chorasmia]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Frye_1992_8&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Frye|1992|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Khlopin suggests the Tedzen Delta in present-day [[Turkmenistan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Khlopin_1992_107_110&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Khlopin|1992|pp=107–110}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Sarianidi considered the [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex]] region as &quot;the native land of the Zoroastrians and, probably, of Zoroaster himself.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sarianidi_1987_54&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sarianidi|1987|p=54}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Boyce includes the [[steppe]]s to the west from the [[Volga River|Volga]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyce_1975_1&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1996|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval &quot;from Media&quot; hypothesis is no longer taken seriously, and Zaehner has even suggested that this was a Magi-mediated issue to garner legitimacy, but this has been likewise rejected by Gershevitch and others.

The 2005 ''[[Encyclopedia Iranica]]'' article on the history of Zoroastrianism summarizes the issue with &quot;while there is general agreement that he did not live in western Iran, attempts to locate him in specific regions of eastern Iran, including Central Asia, remain tentative&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malandra_2005&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Malandra|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
[[File:Iranianhistory-tekyemoaven.jpg|thumb|The rings of the ''[[Fravashi]]''.]]
Zoroaster is recorded as the son of Pourušaspa of the Spitamans or Spitamids (Avestan ''spit'' mean &quot;brilliant&quot; or &quot;white&quot;; some argue that Spitama was a remote progenitor) family,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|2010|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dugdōw,&lt;ref name=&quot;NigosianPlace&quot;/&gt; while his great-grandfather was Haēčataspa. All the names appear appropriate to the nomadic tradition. His father's name means &quot;possessing gray horses&quot; (with the word ''aspa'' meaning horse), while his mother's means &quot;milkmaid&quot;. According to the tradition, he had four brothers, two older and two younger, whose names are given in much later [[Pahlavi literature|Pahlavi]] work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1996|pp=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The training for priesthood probably started very early around seven years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1996|pp=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a priest probably around the age of fifteen, and according to Gathas, he gained knowledge from other teachers and personal experience from traveling when he left his parents at age twenty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1996|pp=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of thirty, he experienced a revelation during a spring festival; on the river bank he saw a shining Being, who revealed himself as [[Vohu Manah]] (Good Purpose) and taught him about [[Ahura Mazda]] (Wise Lord) and five other radiant figures. Zoroaster soon became aware of the existence of two primal Spirits, the second being [[Angra Mainyu]] (Destructive Spirit), with opposing concepts of [[Asha]] (order) and [[Druj]] (deception). Thus he decided to spend his life teaching people to seek Asha.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|2010|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received further revelations and saw a vision of the seven [[Amesha Spenta]], and his teachings were collected in the [[Gathas]] and the [[Avesta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|2010|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, at the age of about forty-two, he received the patronage of queen Hutaosa and a ruler named [[Vishtaspa]], an early adherent of [[Zoroastrianism]] (possibly from [[Bactria]] according to the [[Shahnameh]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1996|pp=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zoroaster's teaching about individual judgment, [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]], the [[resurrection]] of the body, the [[Last Judgment]], and everlasting life for the reunited soul and body, among other things, became borrowings in the [[Abrahamic religions]], but they lost the context of the original teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|2010|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the tradition, he lived for many years after Vishtaspa's conversion, managed to establish a faithful community,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|2010|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and married three times.

=== Cypress of Kashmar ===

{{Main|Cypress of Kashmar}}

The Cypress of Kashmar is a mythical cypress tree of legendary beauty and gargantuan dimensions. It is said to have sprung from a branch brought by Zoroaster from Paradise and to have stood in today's [[Kashmar]] in northeastern Iran and to have been planted by Zoroaster in honor of the conversion of [[Vishtaspa|King Vishtaspa]] to Zoroastrianism. According to the Iranian physicist and historian [[Zakariya al-Qazwini]] King Vishtaspa had been a patron of Zoroaster who planted the tree himself. In his ''[[ʿAjā'ib al-makhlūqāt wa gharā'ib al-mawjūdāt]]'', he further describes how the [[Al-Mutawakkil]] in 247 AH ([[861|861 AD]]) caused the mighty cypress to be felled, and then transported it across Iran, to be used for beams in his new palace at [[Samarra]]. Before, he wanted the tree to be reconstructed before his eyes. This was done in spite of protests by the Iranians, who offered a very great sum of money to save the tree. Al-Mutawakkil never saw the cypress, because he was murdered by a [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] soldier (possibly in the employ of his son) on the night when it arrived on the banks of the Tigris.&lt;ref name=&quot;Climate-Data.org23&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenassay.com/tag/cypress-of-kashmar/|title=The Destruction of Sacred Trees|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=www.goldenassay.com|accessdate=6 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Climate-Data.org222&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zoroastrian.org.uk/vohuman/Library/The%20Cypress%20of%20Kashmar%20and%20Zoroaster.htm|title=The Cypress of Kashmar and Zoroaster|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=www.zoroastrian.org.uk|accessdate=6 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Islam===

A number of parallels have been drawn between Zoroastrian teachings and Islam. Such parallels include the evident similarities between [[Amesha Spenta]] and the archangel [[Gabriel]], praying five times a day, covering one's head during prayer, and the mention of [[Thamud]] and [[Iram of the Pillars]] in the [[Quran]]. These may also indicate the vast influence of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] on the development of either religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinnel 1997&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Hinnel|first=J|title=The Penguin Dictionary of Religion|year=1997|publisher=Penguin Books UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

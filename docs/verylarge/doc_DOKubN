[[Balhae]] was founded only thirty years after Goguryeo had fallen, in 698. It was founded in the northern part of former lands of Goguryeo by [[Dae Joyeong]], a former Goguryeo general&lt;ref&gt;''Old records of Silla'' 新羅古記([[:ko:신라고기|Silla gogi]]): ... 高麗舊將祚榮&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Rhymed Chronicles of Sovereigns'' 帝王韻紀([[Jewang ungi]]): ... 前麗舊將大祚榮&lt;/ref&gt; or chief of Sumo Mohe.&lt;ref&gt;''Solitary Cloud'' 孤雲集(Gounjib): ... 渤海之源流也句驪未滅之時本爲疣贅部落靺羯之屬寔繁有徒是名栗末小蕃甞逐句驪, 內徙其首領乞四羽及大祚榮等至武后臨朝之際自營州作孼而逃輒據荒丘始稱振國時有句驪遺燼勿吉雜流梟音則嘯聚白山鴟義則喧張黑姶與契丹濟惡旋於突厥通謀萬里耨苗累拒渡遼之轍十年食葚晚陳降漢之旗.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Solitary Cloud'' 孤雲集(Gounjip): ... 其酋長大祚榮, 始受臣藩第五品大阿餐之秩&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Comprehensive Institutions'' 通典([[Tongdian]]): ... 渤海夲栗末靺鞨至其酋祚榮立國自號震旦, 先天中 玄宗王子始去靺鞨號專稱渤海&lt;/ref&gt; Balhae controlled the northern areas of the [[Korean Peninsula]], much of Manchuria (though it didn't occupy [[Liaodong peninsula]] for much of history), and expanded into present-day [[Primorsky Krai|Russian Primorsky Krai]]. Balhae styled itself as Goguryeo's [[successor state]] and inherited Goguryeo culture. It also adopted the culture of [[Tang dynasty]], such as the government structure and geopolitical system.&lt;ref name=&quot;lhh balhae&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Lee Hyun-hee|2005|pp=244–248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a time of relative peace and stability in the region, Balhae flourished, especially during the reigns of [[Mun of Balhae|King Mun]] and [[Seon of Balhae|King Seon]]. Balhae was called the &quot;Prosperous Country in the East&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Injae |first1=Lee |last2=Miller |first2=Owen |last3=Jinhoon |first3=Park |last4=Hyun-Hae |first4=Yi |title=Korean History in Maps |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781107098466 |pages=64–65 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=46OTBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA64 |accessdate=24 February 2017 |language=en |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225054603/https://books.google.com/books?id=46OTBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA64 |archivedate=25 February 2017 |date=2014-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Balhae was severely weakened and eventually conquered by the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] [[Liao dynasty]] in 926.&lt;ref name=&quot;lhh balhae&quot;/&gt; Large numbers of refugees, including [[Dae Gwang-hyeon]], the last crown prince of Balhae, were welcomed by Goryeo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goryeosa&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Worden&quot; /&gt; [[Dae Gwang-hyeon]] was included in the imperial family of [[Wang Geon]], bringing a national unification between the two successor nations of Goguryeo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Balhae&quot; /&gt;

No historical records from Balhae have survived, and the Liao left no histories of Balhae. While [[Goryeo]] absorbed some Balhae territory and received Balhae refugees, it compiled no known histories of Balhae either. The [[Samguk Sagi]] (&quot;History of the Three Kingdoms&quot;), for instance, includes passages on Balhae, but does not include a dynastic history of Balhae. The 18th century [[Joseon]] dynasty historian [[Yu Deukgong]] advocated the proper study of Balhae as part of Korean history, and coined the term &quot;North and South States Period&quot; to refer to this era.&lt;ref name=&quot;lhh balhae&quot;/&gt;

===Later Three Kingdoms===
{{Main|Later Three Kingdoms}}
The Later Three Kingdoms period (892 – 936) consisted of [[Later Silla|Unifed Silla]] and the revival of [[Baekje]] and [[Goguryeo]], known historiographically as &quot;Later Baekje&quot; and &quot;Later Goguryeo&quot;. During the late 9th century, as Silla declined in power and exorbitant taxes were imposed on the people, rebellions erupted nationwide and powerful regional lords rose up against the waning kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ko:후삼국시대(後三國時代)|url=http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Item/E0065743|website=Encyclopedia of Korean Culture|publisher=Academy of Korean Studies|accessdate=31 March 2018|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Later Baekje]] was founded by the general [[Gyeon Hwon]] in 892, and its capital was established in Wansanju (modern [[Jeonju]]). The kingdom was based in the southwestern regions in the former territories of Baekje. In 927, Later Baekje attacked [[Gyeongju]], the capital of Unifed Silla, and placed a puppet on the throne. Eventually, Gyeon Hwon was ousted by his sons due to a succession dispute and escaped to Goryeo, where he served as a general in the conquest of the kingdom he personally founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ko:일리천(一利川)전투|url=https://www.culturecontent.com/content/contentView.do?search_div=CP_THE&amp;search_div_id=CP_THE009&amp;cp_code=cp0208&amp;index_id=cp02081440&amp;content_id=cp020814400001|website=문화콘텐츠닷컴|publisher=Korea Creative Content Agency|accessdate=31 March 2018|language=ko|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180401075436/https://www.culturecontent.com/content/contentView.do?search_div=CP_THE&amp;search_div_id=CP_THE009&amp;cp_code=cp0208&amp;index_id=cp02081440&amp;content_id=cp020814400001|archive-date=1 April 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Taebong|Later Goguryeo]] was founded by the Buddhist monk [[Gung Ye]] in 901, and its original capital was established in Songak (modern [[Kaesong]]). The kingdom was based in the northern regions, which were the strongholds of Goguryeo refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=이상각|script-title=ko:고려사 - 열정과 자존의 오백년|date=2014|publisher=들녘|isbn=9791159250248|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LonnCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT25|accessdate=23 March 2018|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=(2) 건국―호족들과의 제휴|url=http://contents.history.go.kr/front/nh/view.do?levelId=nh_011_0040_0030_0020_0020|website=우리역사넷|publisher=National Institute of Korean History|accessdate=23 March 2018|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Goguryeo's name was changed to Majin in 904, and Taebong in 911.

===Political history===
In 1392, the general [[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Seong-gye]], later known as Taejo, established the [[Joseon]] dynasty (1392–1897), named in honor of the ancient kingdom [[Gojoseon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yi|first1=Ki-baek|title=A New History of Korea|year=1984|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674615762|pages=165|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2mdVwXpMzwC&amp;q=%22Yi+Song-gye+named+his+dynasty+Choson%22|accessdate=19 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;naver1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Literally &quot;old Joseon&quot;, the term was first coined in the 13th century AD to differentiate the ancient kingdom from [[Wiman Joseon]] and is now used to differentiate it from the Joseon dynasty.&lt;/ref&gt; and based on idealistic [[Confucianism]]-based ideology.{{sfn|Association of Korean History Teachers|2005a|pp=160–163}} The prevailing philosophy throughout the Joseon dynasty was [[Korean Confucianism|Neo-Confucianism]], which was epitomized by the [[seonbi]] class, scholars who passed up positions of wealth and power to lead lives of study and integrity.

Taejo moved the capital to [[Seoul|Hanyang]] (modern-day [[Seoul]]) and built [[Gyeongbokgung]] palace. In 1394 he adopted [[Neo-Confucianism]] as the country's official religion, and pursued the creation of a strong bureaucratic state.

Internal conflicts within the royal court, civil unrest and other political struggles plagued the nation in the years that followed, worsened by the [[Imjin War|Japanese invasion of Korea]] between 1592 and 1598. [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] marshalled his forces and tried to invade the Asian continent through Korea, but was eventually repelled by the Korean military, with the assistance of the [[righteous army|righteous armies]] and Chinese [[Ming dynasty]]. This war also saw the rise of the career of Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]] with the [[turtle ship]].  As Korea was rebuilding, it had to repel  [[First Manchu invasion of Korea|invasions by the Manchu in 1627]] [[Second Manchu invasion of Korea|and 1636]]. Internal politics were bitterly divided and settled by violence.{{sfn|Lee Hyun-hee|2005|pp= 413–416}}  Historian [[JaHyun Kim Haboush]], in the summary by her editor William Haboush in 2016, interpreted the decisive impact of the victories against the Japanese and Manchu invaders:
:Out of this great war at the end of the 16th century and the Manchu invasions of 1627 and 1636–1637, Koreans emerged with a discernible sense of themselves as a disethnic united by birth, language, and belief forged by this immense clash of the three great powers of East Asia&amp;nbsp;...

After the second Manchu invasion and stabilized relations with the new Qing dynasty, Joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of external peace. However internally, the bitter and violent factional battles raged on. In the 18th century, [[Yeongjo of Joseon|King Yeongjo]] (reigned 1724–76) and his grandson [[Jeongjo of Joseon|King Jeongjo]] (reigned 1776–1800) led a new renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Brief History of Korea|date=January 2005|publisher=Ewha Womans University Press|isbn=9788973006199|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o-WlUd3cjh0C&amp;pg=PT98|accessdate=23 December 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yeongjo and Jeongjo reformed the tax system which grew the revenue stream into the treasury, strengthened the military and sponsored a revival of learning.  The printing press was rejuvenated by using movable metal type;  the number and quality of publications sharply increased. Jeongjo sponsored scholars from various factions to work in the Kyujanggak, or Inner Royal Library, established in 1776.{{sfn|Lee Hyun-hee|2005|pp= 421–424}}

====Period of &quot;rule by royal in-laws&quot;====
Corruption in government and social unrest prevailed after 1776. The government attempted sweeping reforms in the late 19th century, but adhered to a strict isolationist policy, earning Korea the nickname &quot;[[Hermit Kingdom]]&quot;. The policy had been established primarily for protection against Western [[imperialism]], but soon the Joseon dynasty was forced to open trade, beginning an era leading into [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]].{{sfn|Lee Hyun-hee|2005|pp= 469–470}}
The destabilization of the Korean nation may be said to have begun in the period of ''Sedo Jeongchi'' ({{Korean|hangul=세도정치|hanja=勢道政治|lit=in-law politics}}) whereby, on the death of [[Jeongjo of Joseon|King Jeongjo of Joseon]] (r. 1776–1800), the 10-year-old [[Sunjo of Joseon]] (r. 1800–34) ascended the Korean throne, with the true power of the administration residing with his regent, Kim Jo-sun, as a representative of the [[Andong Kim clan]]. As a result, the disarray and blatant corruption in the Korean government, particularly in the three main areas of revenues&amp;nbsp;– land tax, military service, and the state granary system&amp;nbsp;– heaped additional hardship on the peasantry. Of special note is the corruption of the local functionaries (''Hyangni''), who could purchase an appointment as an administrator and so cloak their predations on the farmers with an aura of officialdom. [[Yangban]] families, formerly well-respected for their status as a noble class and being powerful both &quot;socially and politically&quot;, were increasingly seen as little more than commoners unwilling to meet their responsibilities to their communities. Faced with increasing corruption in the government, brigandage of the disenfranchised (such as the mounted fire brigands, or ''Hwajok'', and the boat-borne water brigands or ''Sujok'') and exploited by the elite, many poor village folk sought to pool their resources, such as land, tools, and production, to survive. Despite the government effort in bringing an end to the practice of owning slaves in 1801, slavery in Korea remained legal until 1894.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yangban&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feenstra|first1=Robert C.|last2=Hamilton|first2=Gary G.|title=Emergent Economies, Divergent Paths: Economic Organization and International Trade in South Korea and Taiwan|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521622097|page=186|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nC1vk7tTdRE|accessdate=21 August 2017}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anti-Christian forces====
At this time, Catholic and Protestant missions were well tolerated among the nobles, most notably in and around the area of Seoul.&lt;ref&gt;Ryu Dae Young,  &quot;Treaties, Extraterritorial Rights, and American Protestant Missions in Late Joseon Korea.&quot; ''Korea Journal'' 43.1 (2003): 174-203.&lt;/ref&gt; Animus and persecution by more conservative elements, the Pungyang Jo clan, took the lives of priests and followers, known as the [[Korean Martyrs]], dissuading membership by the upper class. The peasants continued to be drawn to Christian egalitarianism, though mainly in urban and suburban areas. Arguably of greater influence were the religious teachings of [[Choe Je-u]], (최제우, 崔濟愚, 1824–64) called &quot;[[Donghak]]&quot;, which literally means ''Eastern Learning'', and the religion became especially popular in rural areas. Themes of exclusionism (from foreign influences), nationalism, salvation and social consciousness were set to music, allowing illiterate farmers to understand and accept them more readily. Along with many other Koreans, Choe was alarmed by the intrusion of Christianity and the Anglo-French occupation of Beijing during the [[Second Opium War]]. He believed the best way to counter foreign influence in Korea was to introduce democratic and human rights reforms internally. Nationalism and social reform struck a chord among peasant guerrillas, and Donghak spread all across Korea. Progressive revolutionaries organized the peasants into a cohesive structure. Arrested in 1863 following the [[Jinju uprising]] led by Yu Kye-chun, Choe was charged with &quot;misleading the people and sowing discord in society&quot;. Choe was executed in 1864, sending many of his followers into hiding in the mountains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Religion&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wessinger|first1=Catherine|title=The Oxford Handbook of Millennialism|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0190611941|pages=331–32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zgUTDAAAQBAJ|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====King Gojong, 1864-1907====
[[Gojong of Korea]] (r. 1864–1907), enthroned at the age of twelve, succeeded [[Cheoljong of Joseon]] (r. 1849–63). King Gojong's father, the [[Heungseon Daewongun]] (Yi Ha-ung; 1820–98), ruled as the de facto regent and inaugurated far-ranging reforms to strengthen the central administration. Of special note was the decision to rebuild palace buildings and finance the project through additional levies on the population. Further inherited rule by a few elite ruling families was challenged by the adoption of a merit system for official appointments. In addition, ''Sowon''&amp;nbsp;– private academies&amp;nbsp;– which threatened to develop a parallel system to the corrupt government and enjoyed special privileges and large landholdings, were taxed and repressed despite bitter opposition from Confucian scholars. Lastly, a policy of steadfast isolationism was enforced to staunch the increasing intrusion of Western thought and technology. He was impeached in 1873 and forced into retirement by the supporters of [[Empress Myeongseong]], also called &quot;Queen Min&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;queen min&quot;&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=940CE7DC1139E033A25753C1A9679D94649ED7CF Characteristics of Queen of Korea] ''[[The New York Times]]'' 10 November 1895&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture and society===
[[File:Koreans oldest pic 3.jpg|thumb|One of the earliest photographs depicting [[yangban]] Koreans, taken in 1863]]
Korea's culture was based on the philosophy of [[Neo-Confucianism]], which emphasizes morality, righteousness, and practical ethics. Wide interest in scholarly study resulted in the establishment of private academies and educational institutions. Many documents were written about history, geography, medicine, and Confucian principles. The arts flourished in painting, calligraphy, music, dance, and [[Korean pottery and porcelain|ceramics]].{{sfn|Lee Hyun-hee|2005|pp= 391–401}}

The most notable cultural event of this era is the creation and promulgation of the Korean alphabet ''[[Hunmin jeongeom]]'' (later called ''[[Hangul]]'') by [[Sejong the Great]] in 1446.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hangul&quot; /&gt; This period also saw various other cultural, scientific and technological advances.{{sfn|Association of Korean History Teachers|2005a|pp=168–173}}

During Joseon dynasty, a social hierarchy system existed that greatly affected Korea's social development. The king and the royal family were atop the hereditary system, with the next tier being a class of civil or military officials and landowners known as ''[[yangban]]'', who worked for the government and lived off the efforts of tenant farmers and slaves.

A middle class, ''jungin'', were technical specialists such as scribes, medical officers, technicians in science-related fields, artists and musicians. Commoners, i.e. peasants, constituted the largest class in Korea. They had obligations to pay taxes, provide labor, and serve in the military. By paying land taxes to the state, they were allowed to cultivate land and farm. The lowest class included tenant farmers, slaves, entertainers, craftsmen, prostitutes, laborers, shamans, vagabonds, outcasts, and criminals. Although slave status was hereditary, they could be sold or freed at officially set prices, and the mistreatment of slaves was forbidden.{{sfn|Lee Hyun-hee|2005|pp= 387–389}}

This ''yangban'' focused system started to change in the late 17th century as political, economic and social changes came into place. By the 19th century, new commercial groups emerged, and the active social mobility caused the ''yangban'' class to expand, resulting in the weakening of the old class system. The Korea government ordered the freedom of government slaves in 1801. The class system of Korea was completely banned in 1894.{{sfn|Lee Hyun-hee|2005|pp= 435–437}}

===Foreign pressure===

[[File:KoreanEmbassy1655KanoTounYasunobu.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Joseon Tongsinsa|Korean Embassy to Japan]], 1655, attributed to Kano Toun Yasunobu; [[British Museum]]]]

Korea dealt with a pair of [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)|Japanese invasions from 1592 to 1598]] (''[[Imjin War]]'' or the ''Seven Years' War''). Prior to the war, Korea sent two ambassadors to scout for signs of Japan's intentions of invading Korea. However, they came back with two different reports, and while the politicians split into sides, few proactive measures were taken.

This conflict brought prominence to Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]] as he contributed to eventually repelling the Japanese forces with the innovative use of his [[turtle ship]], a massive, yet swift, ramming/cannon ship fitted with iron spikes.{{sfn|Hawley|2005|p=195f}}{{sfn|Turnbull|2002|p=244}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Roh 2004, 13&quot;&gt;Roh, Young-koo: &quot;Yi Sun-shin, an Admiral Who Became a Myth&quot;, ''The Review of Korean Studies'', Vol. 7, No. 3 (2004), p.13&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the [[hwacha]] was also highly effective in repelling the Japanese invaders from the land.

Subsequently, Korea was [[First Manchu invasion of Korea|invaded in 1627]] and [[Second Manchu invasion of Korea|again in 1636]] by the Manchus, who went on to conquer China and establish the [[Qing dynasty]], after which the Joseon dynasty recognized [[Qing]] suzerainty. Though Joseon respected its traditional subservient position to China, there was persistent loyalty for the perished [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]] and disdain for the Manchus, who were regarded as barbarians.

During the 19th century, Joseon tried to control foreign influence by closing its borders to all nations but China. In 1853 the [[USS South America]], an American gunboat, visited [[Busan]] for 10 days and had amiable contact with local officials. Several Americans shipwrecked on Korea in 1855 and 1865 were also treated well and sent to China for repatriation. The Joseon court was aware of the foreign invasions and treaties involving Qing China, as well as the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s, and followed a cautious policy of slow exchange with the West.

In 1866, reacting to greater numbers of Korean converts to Catholicism despite several waves of persecutions, the Joseon court clamped down on them, massacring French Catholic missionaries and Korean converts alike. Later in the year France invaded and occupied portions of Ganghwa Island. The Korean army lost heavily, but the French abandoned the island.

The ''General Sherman'', an American-owned armed merchant marine sidewheel schooner, attempted to open Korea to trade in 1866. After an initial miscommunication, the ship sailed upriver and became stranded near Pyongyang.  After being ordered to leave by the Korean officials, the American crewmen killed four Korean inhabitants, kidnapped a military officer and engaged in sporadic fighting that continued for four days. After two efforts to destroy the ship failed, she was finally set aflame by Korean [[fireships]] laden with explosives.
{{Wikisource|Littell's Living Age/Volume 129/Issue 1662/A Glimpse of the Korea|a description of a visit to Korea by a British ship in 1876}} This incident is celebrated by the DPRK as a precursor to the later [[USS Pueblo (AGER-2)|USS Pueblo]] incident.

In response, the United States confronted Korea militarily in 1871, killing 243 Koreans in Ganghwa island before withdrawing. This incident is called the [[United States expedition to Korea|Sinmiyangyo]] in Korea. Five years later, the reclusive Korea signed a trade treaty with Japan, and in 1882 signed a treaty with the United States, ending centuries of isolationism.

Conflict between the conservative court and a reforming faction led to the [[Gapsin Coup]] in 1884. The reformers sought to reform Koreans institutionalized social inequality, by proclaiming social equality and the elimination of the privileges of the [[yangban]] class. The reformers were backed by Japan, and were thwarted by the arrival of Qing troops, invited by the conservative [[Empress Myeongseong|Queen Min]]. The Chinese troops departed but the leading general [[Yuan Shikai]] remained in Korea from 1885-1894 as Resident, directing Korean affairs.

In 1885, British [[Royal Navy]] occupied [[Geomun Island Incident|Geomun Island]], and withdrew in 1887.

Korea became linked by telegraph to China in 1888 with Chinese controlled telegraphs. China permitted Korea to establish embassies with Russia (1884), Italy (1885), France (1886), the United States, and Japan. China attempted to block the exchange of embassies in Western countries, but not with Tokyo. The Qing government provided loans. China promoted its trade in an attempt to block Japanese merchants, which led to Chinese favour in Korean trade. Anti-Chinese riots broke out in 1888 and 1889 and Chinese shops were torched. Japan remained the largest foreign community and largest trading partner.{{sfn|Seth|2010|p=225}}

A [[Meiji period|rapidly modernizing Meiji Japan]] successfully challenged China in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894–1895), forcing it to abandon its long-standing claims to deference by Korea. Modernization began in Korea when Japan forced it to open its ports in 1876. However, the forces of modernization met strong opposition not only from the traditionalism of the ruling Korean elite but from the population at large, which supported the traditional Confucian system of government by gentlemen. Japan used modernization movements to gain more and more control over Korea.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;Haryong Kim, &quot;Problems of the Modernization of Korea: The Modernization of Korean Politics.&quot; ''Asiatic Research Bulletin'' (1963), 6#8 pp 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1895, the Japanese were involved in the murder of [[Empress Myeongseong]],{{sfn|Schmid|2002 |p=72}}{{sfn|Association of Korean History Teachers|2005b|p=43}} who had sought Russian help, and the Russians were forced to retreat from Korea for the time.

As a result of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894–1895), the 1895 [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] was concluded between China and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=A Study of Functionality of the &quot;Symbol&quot; on Nationalism in Modern Korea: Activities of the Independence Club and the Independence Arch (1896–1899) | last=Kim | first=Yong Chan | url=http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/acd/re/k-rsc/ras/04_publications/ria_ja/36_09.pdf | language=ja | journal=Ritsumeikan Journal of International Relations and Area Studies | volume=36 | date=October 2012 | pages=189–205 | access-date=January 21, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313001720/http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/acd/re/k-rsc/ras/04_publications/ria_ja/36_09.pdf | archive-date=March 13, 2014 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; It stipulated the abolition of subordinate relationships Korea had with China, in which Korea was a tributary state of China since the [[Qing invasion of Joseon]] in 1636.

In 1897, Joseon was renamed the [[Korean Empire]], and King Gojong became [[Emperor Gojong of Korea|Emperor Gojong]]. The imperial government aimed to become a strong and independent nation by implementing domestic reforms, strengthening military forces, developing commerce and industry, and surveying land ownership. Organizations like the [[Independence Club]] also rallied to assert the rights of the Joseon people, but clashed with the government which proclaimed absolute monarchy and power.{{sfn|Association of Korean History Teachers|2005b|pp= 51-55}}

Russian influence was strong in the Empire until being defeated by Japan in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904–1905). Korea effectively became a [[protectorate]] of Japan on 17 November 1905, the [[Eulsa Treaty|1905 Protectorate Treaty]] having been promulgated without Emperor Gojong's required seal or commission.{{sfn|Association of Korean History Teachers|2005b|pp= 58-61}}{{sfn|Lee Ki-baik|1984|pp= 309–317}}

Following the signing of the treaty, many intellectuals and scholars set up various organizations and associations, embarking on movements for independence. In 1907, Gojong was forced to abdicate after Japan learned that he [[Hague Secret Emissary Affair|sent secret envoys]] to the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Second Hague Conventions]] to protest against the protectorate treaty, leading to the accession of Gojong's son, [[Emperor Sunjong of Korea|Emperor Sunjong]]. In 1909, independence activist [[An Jung-geun]] assassinated [[Itō Hirobumi]], former [[Resident-General of Korea]], for Ito's intrusions on the Korean politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;hoare pares japanese rule&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hoare|Pares|1988|pp= 50–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.korea.net/news.do?mode=detail&amp;guid=45163 An Jung-geun], Korea.net&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted the Japanese to ban all political organizations and proceed with plans for annexation.

In 1910, the [[Empire of Japan]] effectively annexed [[Korean Empire|Korea]] through the [[Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty]]. Along with all other previously signed treaties between Korea and Japan, the annexation treaty was confirmed to be null and void in 1965. While Japan asserts the treaty was concluded legally, Korea disputes the legality of the treaty, because the treaty was not signed by the Emperor of Korea as required and it violated the international convention on external pressures regarding treaties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kawasaki|first=Yutaka|title=Was the 1910 Annexation Treaty Between Korea and Japan Concluded Legally?|journal=Murdoch University Journal of Law|volume=3|issue=2|date=July 1996|url=http://www.murdoch.edu.au/elaw/issues/v3n2/kawasaki.html|accessdate=2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2010/05/11/2010051101277.html Japan's Annexation of Korea 'Unjust and Invalid'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304121002/http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2010/05/11/2010051101277.html |date=2016-03-04 }}, Chosun Ilbo, 2010-05-11.

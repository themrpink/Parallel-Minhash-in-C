==Labelling of grades==
Brandy has a traditional age grading system, although its use is unregulated outside of [[Cognac]] and [[Armagnac]]. These indicators can usually be found on the label near the brand name:

* '''V.S.''' (&quot;very special&quot;) or ✯✯✯ (three stars) designates a blend in which the youngest brandy has been stored for at least two years in a cask.&lt;ref name=&quot;BNIC etiquette&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bnic.fr/cognac/_en/2_cognac/index.aspx?page=etiquette |title=Website of the BNIC |access-date=9 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223223212/http://www.bnic.fr/cognac/_en/2_cognac/index.aspx?page=etiquette |archive-date=23 December 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''V.S.O.P.''' (&quot;very superior old pale&quot;), '''Reserve''' or ✯✯✯✯✯ (five stars) designates a blend in which the youngest brandy is stored for at least four years in a cask.&lt;ref name=&quot;BNIC etiquette&quot;/&gt;
* '''XO''' (&quot;extra old&quot;) or '''Napoléon''' designates a blend in which the youngest brandy is stored for at least six years.&lt;ref name=&quot;BNIC etiquette&quot;/&gt;
* '''Hors d'âge''' (&quot;beyond age&quot;) is a designation which is formally equal to XO for Cognac, but for Armagnac designates brandy that is at least ten years old. In practice the term is used by producers to market a high-quality product beyond the official age scale.

In the case of [[Brandy de Jerez]], the Consejo Regulador de la Denominacion Brandy de Jerez classifies it according to:

* Brandy de Jerez Solera: one year old.
* Brandy de Jerez Solera Reserva: three years old.
* Brandy de Jerez Solera Gran Reserva: ten years old.

Russian [[Russian brandy|brandies]] (traditionally called &quot;Cognac&quot; within the country), as well as brandies from many other post-Soviet states (except [[Armenian brandy|Armenia]]) use the traditional Russian grading system that is similar to the French one, but extends it significantly:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Товароведение и экспертиза вкусовых товаров: Учебник для вузов|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xn3u6Xa7u3QC&amp;pg=PA137|publisher=Издательский дом &quot;Питер&quot;|isbn=978-5-94723-971-3|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cognacmuseum.ru/o-konyake/sroki-vyderzhki-vs-vsop-xo-kv-kvvk-ks-os/ |title=Сроки выдержки VS, VSOP, XO, КВ, КВВК, КС, ОС |publisher=Cognac Museum Moscow |access-date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* &quot;Three stars&quot; or ✯✯✯ designates the brandy with the youngest component cask-aged for at least two years, analogous to the French V.S.
* &quot;Four stars&quot; or ✯✯✯✯ is for the blends where the youngest brandy is aged for at least three years.
* &quot;Five stars&quot; or ✯✯✯✯✯ means that the youngest brandy in the blend was aged four years, similar to the French V.S.O.P.
* КВ/KV (&quot;Aged Cognac&quot;) is a designation corresponding to &quot;XO&quot; or &quot;Napoléon&quot;, meaning that the youngest spirit in the blend is at least six years old.
* КВВК/KVVK (&quot;Aged Cognac, Superior Quality&quot;) designates the eight-year-old blends and tends to be used only for the highest quality vintages.
* КС/KS (&quot;Old Cognac&quot;): At least ten years of aging for the youngest spirit in the blend (similar to the Armagnac's &quot;Hors d'âge&quot;).
* ОС/OS (&quot;Very Old&quot;): Beyond the French system and designates the blends older than 20 years.

[[File:Caroline Bardua - Bildnis des Komponisten Carl Maria von Weber.jpg|thumb|200px|Carl Maria von Weber (1821), by [[Caroline Bardua]] ]]

'''Carl Maria von Weber''' (18 or 19 November 1786{{spaced ndash}}5 June 1826){{sfn|Brown|2002a}}{{sfn|von Weber|1864|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/carlmariavonweb02webegoog#page/n67/mode/2up 19–20]}} was a German composer, conductor, [[virtuoso]] pianist, guitarist{{sfn|von Weber|1865|pages=1:52, 62, 94, 137, 143, 152, 177, 211, 244, 271, 278}}{{sfn|Warrack|1976|pp=67, 94, 107, 141}} and [[Music criticism|critic]] who was one of the first significant composers of the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] era. Best known for [[List of operas by Carl Maria von Weber|his operas]], he was a crucial figure in the development of ''[[Romantische Oper]]'' (Romantic opera).{{sfn|Brown|2002a}}

Throughout his youth, his father, {{ill|Franz Anton von Weber|de|lt=Franz Anton}}, relentlessly moved the family between [[Hamburg]], [[Salzburg]], [[Freiberg]], [[Augsburg]] and [[Vienna]]. Consequently he studied with many teachers – his father, [[Johann Peter Heuschkel]], [[Michael Haydn]], [[Giovanni Valesi]], [[Johann Nepomuk Kalcher]] and [[Georg Joseph Vogler]] – under whose supervision he composed four [[opera]]s, none of which survive complete.{{sfn|Brown|2002a}} He had a modest output of non-operatic music, which includes two symphonies; a [[Bassoon Concerto (Weber)|bassoon concerto]]; piano pieces such as [[Konzertstück in F minor (Weber)|Konzertstück in F minor]] and ''[[Invitation to the Dance (Weber)|Invitation to the Dance]]''; and many pieces that featured the clarinet, usually written for the virtuoso clarinetist [[Heinrich Baermann]]. His mature operas –  ''[[Silvana (opera)|Silvana]]'' (1810), ''[[Abu Hassan]]''  (1811), ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' (1821), ''[[Die drei Pintos]]'' ({{Abbr|comp.|composed in}} 1820–21), ''[[Euryanthe]]'' (1823), ''[[Oberon (Weber)|Oberon]]'' (1826) – were a major influence on subsequent German composers including [[Heinrich Marschner|Marschner]], [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]], and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]; his compositions for piano anticipated those of [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]] and [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]. His best known work, ''Der Freischütz'', remains among the most significant [[Opera in German|German operas]].{{sfn|Brown|2002f}}

==Life and career==
===Childhood===
Weber was born in [[Eutin]], [[Bishopric of Lübeck]], as the eldest of the three children of {{ill|Franz Anton von Weber|de}} and his second wife, [[Genovefa Weber]], a Viennese singer. He was baptized Catholic on November 20, 1786 with the name Carl Friedrich Ernst; the alternative second name Maria appeared only later. His brother and sister died in  infancy.{{sfn|Carl-Maria-von-Weber-Gesamtausgabe - Biographie}} Both parents were Catholic and originally came from the far south of Germany. The &quot;[[von]]&quot; was an affectation of his father, who was not an aristocrat.

In April 1779, Franz Anton had been appointed director of the prince-bishopric orchestra, Eutin, which, however, was dissolved in 1781 because of spending cuts. He then took the position of Eutin's municipal music director. Dissatisfied with this position, he resigned in 1787 and founded a theatre company in Hamburg. After a brief stay in Vienna, he joined the theatre company of Johann Friedrich Toscani and Peter Carl Santorini, who performed in Kassel, Marburg and Hofgeismar. He tried repeatedly to establish a lasting company of his own but had only intermittent success.{{sfn|Carl-Maria-von-Weber-Gesamtausgabe - Biographie}}

Franz Anton's half-brother, Fridolin, married [[Cäcilia Weber|Cäcilia Stamm]] and had four daughters, [[Josepha Weber|Josepha]], [[Aloysia Weber|Aloysia]], [[Constanze Mozart|Constanze]] and [[Sophie Weber|Sophie]], all of whom became notable singers. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] attempted to woo Aloysia, composing several pieces for her. But, after she rejected his advances, Mozart went on to marry Constanze; thus Mozart's wife was a cousin of Carl Maria von Weber.

A gifted violinist, Franz Anton had ambitions of turning Weber into a [[child prodigy]] like Mozart. Weber was born with a congenital hip disease and did not begin to walk until he was four. But by then, he was already a capable singer and pianist.

===Education===
Franz Anton gave Weber a comprehensive education, which was consistently interrupted by the family's frequent moves. In 1796, Weber continued his musical education in [[Hildburghausen]], where he was instructed by the oboist [[Johann Peter Heuschkel]]. After moving to [[Salzburg]] in autumn 1797, Weber studied from 1798 with [[Michael Haydn]], younger brother of the better known [[Joseph Haydn]], who agreed to teach Weber free of charge.

His time in Salzburg was overshadowed by the death of his, who  succumbed to [[tuberculosis]] on 13 March 1798, and that of his one-year-old sister Antonetta on 29 December 1798 in Munich.

A visit to Joseph Haydn in Vienna, presumably in hope of advanced teaching, was fruitless. In autumn 1798, Weber moved to Munich where he studied singing with [[Giovanni Valesi|Johann Evangelist Wallishauser]] and composing with [[Johann Nepomuk Kalcher]], who supervised Weber's first opera, ''Die Macht der Liebe und des Weins'' (''The Power of Love and Wine''). Like his other compositions of that period, this opera is lost. Six [[fughetta]]s for piano of the twelve-year-old Weber were  published in Leipzig.

Weber's musical education was extended by a mastering of lithography which he learned in the workshop of [[Alois Senefelder]], the inventor of the process, and Franz Gleißner (autumn 1799). A set of his ''Variations for the Pianoforte'' was lithographed by Weber himself.

In 1800, the family moved to [[Freiberg]] in Saxony, where Weber, then 14 years old, wrote an opera called ''Das stumme Waldmädchen'' (''The Silent Forest Maiden''). It was produced at the Freiberg and [[Chemnitz]] theatres and later in Saint Petersburg (1804), Vienna (1805/1805) and Prague (1806). The young Weber also began to publish articles as a music critic, for example in the ''Leipziger Neue Zeitung'' in 1801.

In 1801, the family returned to Salzburg, where Weber resumed his studies with Michael Haydn. Weber composed his third opera ''[[Peter Schmoll und seine Nachbarn]]'' (''Peter Schmoll and His Neighbours'') which his teacher approved. After a concert tour in 1802 the Webers returned to [[Augsburg]]  where it is believed ''Peter Schmoll'' premiered.

In mid 1803, Weber continued his studies in Vienna with [[Georg Joseph Vogler|Abbé Vogler]], founder of important music schools in Mannheim, Stockholm, and Darmstadt. Another famous pupil of Vogler in Darmstadt was Jakob Meyer Beer, later known as [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], who became a close friend of Weber. In letters they addressed each other as &quot;brother&quot;.{{sfn|Carl-Maria-von-Weber-Gesamtausgabe - Biographie}}

===Early career 1804–1810===
[[File:Carl Maria von Weber 1814 painting by Thomas Lawrence.jpg|thumb|200px|Carl Maria von Weber (1814) Painting by [[Thomas Lawrence]]]]
Vogler recommended the 17-year-old Weber for the post of Director at the [[Breslau Opera]] in 1804; Weber was offered and accepted the post. He sought to reform the Opera by pensioning off older singers, expanding the orchestra, and tackling a more challenging repertoire. His ambitious and dedicated work as director of the orchestra was acknowledged, though his tempi were frequently criticized as too fast. As the daily routine did not leave sufficient time for his own creative work, Weber did not seek to extend his two-year appointment.{{fact|date=August 2020}}

After an interlude at the court of [[Duke Eugen of Württemberg (1788–1857)|Duke Eugen of Württemberg]], who resided in [[Province of Lower Silesia|Silesia]], Weber served from 1807 to 1810 in Stuttgart as private secretary to [[Duke Louis of Württemberg|Duke Ludwig]], brother of [[Frederick I of Württemberg|King Frederick I of Württemberg]]. Weber's time in Württemberg was plagued with troubles. He fell deeply into debt and became entangled in the financial manipulations of his employer, e.g. the sale of confirmations of ducal service which exempted the purchaser from military service. Weber was arrested and charged with [[embezzlement]] and [[bribery]]. As he could disprove the allegations, the case was brought under civil law to avoid compromising the ''de facto'' manipulator, the brother of the king. Weber agreed to pay the costs (the last payment was made in 1816) and was banished from Württemberg/ together with his father.{{sfn|Carl-Maria-von-Weber-Gesamtausgabe - Biographie}}

As a sobering side effect, Weber started to keep a diary to list his expenses and correspondence, and make occasional comments on special events.{{Fact|date=August 2020}}

Weber remained prolific as a composer during this period, writing a quantity of religious music, mainly for the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[mass (liturgy)|mass]]. This, however, earned him the hostility of conservatives working for the re-establishment of traditional chant in liturgy.

===Later career 1810–1826===
[[File:Carlmariavonwebermuseum dresden2.jpg|thumb|200px|Weber's summer home (1818–1824) near Dresden; the  [[Carl Maria von Weber Museum]]]]
[[File:Ferdinand Schimon Carl Maria von Weber.tif|thumb|220px| Carl Maria von Weber (1825) Portrait by {{ill|Ferdinand Schimon|de}}, Dresden, Städtische Galerie]]

In 1810, Weber visited several cities throughout Germany; 1811 was a pivotal year in his career when he met and worked with the Munich court [[clarinetist]] [[Heinrich Baermann]] and composed the [[Concertino for Clarinet (Weber)|Concertino in E{{Flat}} Major, Op. 26, J. 109]], and the two concerti [[Clarinet Concerto No. 1 (Weber)|J. 114]] and [[Clarinet Concerto No. 2 (Weber)|J. 118]] for him; from December 1811 through March 1812, Weber went on tour with Baermann playing the clarinet works, and it was some of the final concerts on this tour that changed public, critical and royal opinions of Weber's work, and helped him to mount a successful performance of [[Silvana (opera)|''Silvana'']] in Berlin later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Clarinet Virtuosi of the past|last=Weston|first=Pamela|publisher=Emerson Edition|year=1971|isbn=978-0-9506209-8-5|location=Great Britain|pages=124|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Warrack|1976|pages=138–139}} From 1813 to 1816 he was director of the Opera in Prague; from 1816 to 1817 he worked in Berlin, and from 1817 onwards he was director of the prestigious [[Semperoper|Opera in Dresden]], working hard to establish a [[Opera in German|German opera]], in reaction to the [[Italian opera]] which had dominated the European music scene since the 18th century. On 4 November 1817, he married Caroline Brandt, a singer who created the title role of ''Silvana''.&lt;ref name=&quot;oldandsold.com&quot;&gt;[http://music.yodelout.com/carl-maria-von-weber-masters-of-music/ &quot;Carl Maria {{sic|Von|hide=yes|expected=von}} Weber&quot;], yodelout.com&lt;/ref&gt; In 1819, he wrote perhaps his most famous piano piece, ''[[Invitation to the Dance (Weber)|Invitation to the Dance]]''.

The successful premiere of ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' on 18 June 1821 in Berlin led to performances all over Europe. On the very morning of the premiere, Weber finished his ''[[Konzertstück in F minor (Weber)|Konzertstück in F minor for Piano and Orchestra]]'', and he premiered it a week later.

[[File:The grave of Carl Maria von Weber, Old Catholic Cemetery, Dresden.jpg|thumb|200px|upright|Weber's grave in the Old Catholic Cemetery in Dresden]]

In 1823, Weber composed his first (and only) full-length, [[Through-composed music|through-composed]] opera ''[[Euryanthe]]'' to a [[libretto]] by [[Helmina von Chézy]], several passages of which (notably the music for the villainous couple Lysiart and Eglantine) anticipate the early, romantic operas of [[Richard Wagner]].{{according to whom|date=July 2019}} In 1824, Weber received an invitation from [[The Royal Opera]], London, to compose and produce ''[[Oberon (Weber)|Oberon]]'', based on [[Christoph Martin Wieland]]'s [[Oberon (poem)|poem of the same name]]. Weber accepted the invitation, and in 1826 he travelled to England, to finish the work and conduct the premiere on 12 April.

Weber was already suffering from tuberculosis when he visited London. He conducted the premiere and twelve sold-out performances of ''Oberon'' in London during April and in May, and despite his rapidly worsening health, he continued to fulfil commitments for private concerts and benefits.

He died in his sleep during the night on 5 June 1826 at the home of his good friend and host [[George Thomas Smart|Sir George Smart]]; he was 39 years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;oldandsold.com&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Warrack|1976|pages=356–362}} He was buried in London.

Eighteen years later, in December 1844, his remains were transferred to the family burial plot in the Old Catholic Cemetery (Alter Katholischer Friedhof) in [[Dresden]] at the side of his youngest son Alexander, who at the age of 19 had died of measles seven weeks before. The simple gravestone, designed by [[Gottfried Semper]], lies against the northern boundary wall. The [[eulogy]] at the reburial was delivered by Wagner.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Callow]], ''Being Wagner: The Triumph of the Will'', p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber's unfinished opera ''[[Die drei Pintos]]'' (''The Three Pintos'') was originally given by his widow to Meyerbeer for completion; it was eventually completed by [[Gustav Mahler]], who conducted the first performance in Leipzig on 20 January 1888.

==Legacy==
[[List of operas by Carl Maria von Weber|Weber's operas]] ''Der Freischütz'', ''Euryanthe'' and ''Oberon'' greatly influenced the development of the ''[[Romantische Oper]]'' (Romantic opera) in Germany.{{sfn|Brown|2002a}} ''Der Freischütz'' came to be regarded as the first German opera,{{sfn|Brown|2002f}} ''Euryanthe'' developed the ''[[leitmotif]]'' technique to an unprecedented degree, while ''Oberon'' may have influenced [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]'s music for ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (Mendelssohn)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' and, at the same time, revealed Weber's lifelong interest in the music of non-Western cultures. This interest was first manifested in Weber's [[incidental music]] for [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]'s translation of [[Carlo Gozzi|Gozzi]]'s ''[[Turandot (Gozzi)|Turandot]]'', for which he used a Chinese melody, making him the first Western composer to use an Asian tune that was not of the [[Orientalism|pseudo-Turkish]] kind popularized by Mozart and others.

Weber's compositions for [[clarinet]], [[bassoon]], and [[Horn (instrument)|horn]] occupy an important place in the musical repertoire. His compositions for the clarinet, which include two [[concerto]]s, a concertino, a [[quintet]], a duo concertante, and variations on a theme from his opera ''Silvana'', are regularly performed today. His [[Concertino for Horn and Orchestra (Weber)|Concertino for Horn and Orchestra]] requires the performer to simultaneously produce two notes by humming while playing—a technique known as &quot;[[multiphonic]]s&quot;. His [[bassoon concerto]] and the ''Andante e Rondo ungarese'' (a reworking of a piece originally for [[viola]] and orchestra) are also popular with bassoonists.

Weber's contribution to vocal and choral music is also significant. His body of [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] religious music was highly popular in 19th-century Germany, and he composed one of the earliest [[song cycle]]s, ''Die Temperamente beim Verluste der Geliebten'' (''[Four] Temperaments on the Loss of a Lover''). Weber was also notable as one of the first conductors to conduct without a piano or violin.

Weber's orchestration has also been highly praised and emulated by later generations of composers – [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]] referred to him several times in his ''[[Treatise on Instrumentation]]'' while [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] remarked that the sound of the Weber orchestra was obtained through the scrutiny of the soul of each instrument.

His operas influenced the work of later opera composers, especially in Germany, such as [[Heinrich Marschner|Marschner]],{{sfn|Warrack|1976|p=298}} Meyerbeer and Wagner,{{sfn|Morgan|2017|p=xiii}} as well as several [[Musical nationalism|nationalist]] 19th-century composers such as [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]]. Homage has been paid to Weber byMany 20th-century composers paid homage to Weber, such as Debussy and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]. Mahler completed Weber's unfinished comic opera ''Die drei Pintos'' and made revisions of ''Euryanthe'' and ''Oberon'' while [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]] composed the popular ''[[Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber]]'', based on Weber's lesser-known keyboard works and the incidental music to ''Turandot''.

Weber also wrote [[music journalism]] and was interested in [[folksong]], and learned [[lithography]] to engrave his own works.

A [[virtuoso]] pianist himself,{{#tag:ref|Sources that note Weber's virtuosity as a pianist include:&lt;br/&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2002a}}: &quot;Johann Peter Heuschkel... laid the foundations of Weber’s pianistic virtuosity&quot;&lt;br/&gt;{{harvnb|Morgan|2017|p=xiii}}: &quot;he was also many other things, including... virtuoso pianist&quot;&lt;br/&gt;{{harvnb|Warrack|1976|p=123}}: &quot;a touring virtuoso...&quot;|group=n}} Weber composed four [[Piano sonata|sonatas]], two concertos and the ''Konzertstück in F minor'' (concert piece), which influenced composers such as [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] and Mendelssohn.{{sfn|Morgan|2017|p=xiv}} The ''{{Lang|de|Konzertstück}}'' provided a new model for the one-movement concerto in several contrasting sections (such as Liszt's, who often played the work), and was acknowledged by Stravinsky as the model for his ''[[Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra]]''. Weber's shorter piano pieces, such as the ''Invitation to the Dance'', were later [[Orchestration|orchestrated]] by Berlioz, while his ''Polacca Brillante'' was later set for piano and orchestra by Liszt. However, Weber's piano music all but disappeared from the repertoire. There are several recordings of the major works for the solo piano, including complete recordings of the piano sonatas and the shorter piano pieces, and there are recordings of the individual sonatas by [[Claudio Arrau]] (1st sonata), [[Alfred Cortot]] and [[Emil Gilels]] (2nd sonata), [[Sviatoslav Richter]] (3rd sonata) and [[Leon Fleisher]] (4th sonata). The ''Invitation to the Dance'', although better known in Berlioz's orchestration (as part of the ballet music for a Paris production of ''Der Freischütz''), has long been played and recorded by pianists (e.g., [[Benno Moiseiwitsch]] [in [[Carl Tausig]]'s arrangement]). ''Invitation to the Dance'' also served as the thematic basis for [[Benny Goodman]]'s [[Swing music|swing]] theme song for the radio program ''[[Let's Dance (radio)|Let's Dance]]''.

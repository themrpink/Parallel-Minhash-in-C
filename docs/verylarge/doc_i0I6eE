In January 1953 Leigh travelled to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to film ''[[Elephant Walk]]'' with Peter Finch. Shortly after filming started she suffered a breakdown, and returned to Britain where, between periods of incoherence, she told Olivier that she was in love with Finch, and had been having an affair with him;{{sfn|Capua|2003|pp=128–129}} she gradually recovered over a period of several months. As a result of the breakdown, many of the Oliviers' friends learned of her problems. Niven said she had been &quot;quite, quite mad&quot;,{{sfn|Coleman|2006|pp=254–263}} and in his diary, Coward expressed the view that &quot;things had been bad and getting worse since 1948 or thereabouts.&quot;{{sfn|Coward|1983|p=211}}

For the [[Coronation of Elizabeth II|Coronation]] season of 1953, Olivier and Leigh starred in the West End in [[Terence Rattigan]]'s [[Ruritania]]n comedy, ''[[The Sleeping Prince (play)|The Sleeping Prince]]''. It ran for eight months{{sfn|Darlington|1968|p=79}} but was widely regarded as a minor contribution to the season, in which other productions included Gielgud in ''[[Venice Preserv'd]]'', Coward in ''[[The Apple Cart]]'' and Ashcroft and Redgrave in ''Antony and Cleopatra''.{{sfn|Holden|1988|pp=279–280}}&lt;ref name=&quot;times-coronation-season&quot;/&gt;

Olivier directed his third Shakespeare film in September 1954, ''[[Richard III (1955 film)|Richard III]]'' (1955), which he co-produced with Korda. The presence of four theatrical knights in the one film—Olivier was joined by [[Cedric Hardwicke]], Gielgud and Richardson—led an American reviewer to dub it &quot;An-All-Sir-Cast&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;crowdus&quot;/&gt; The critic for ''The Manchester Guardian'' described the film as a &quot;bold and successful achievement&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Guard: Richard&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Coleman|2006|pp=265–266}} but it was not a box-office success, which accounted for Olivier's subsequent failure to raise the funds for a [[Macbeth (unfinished film)|planned film]] of ''Macbeth''.&lt;ref name=&quot;crowdus&quot;/&gt; He won a BAFTA award for the role and was nominated for the Best Actor Academy Award, which [[Yul Brynner]] won.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oscar: Richard&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=BAFTA/&gt;

===Last productions with Leigh (1955–1956)===
In 1955 Olivier and Leigh were invited to play leading roles in three plays at the [[Royal Shakespeare Theatre|Shakespeare Memorial Theatre]], Stratford. They began with ''Twelfth Night'', directed by Gielgud, with Olivier as Malvolio and Leigh as Viola. Rehearsals were difficult, with Olivier determined to play his conception of the role despite the director's view that it was vulgar.{{sfn|Croall|2000|p=391}} Gielgud later commented:
{{quote|Somehow the production did not work. Olivier was set on playing [[Malvolio]] in his own particular rather extravagant way. He was extremely moving at the end, but he played the earlier scenes like a Jewish hairdresser, with a lisp and an extraordinary accent, and he insisted on falling backwards off a bench in the garden scene, though I begged him not to do it.{{space}}... But then Malvolio is a very difficult part.{{sfn|Gielgud|1979|p=178}}|}}
The next production was ''Macbeth''. Reviewers were lukewarm about the direction by [[Glen Byam Shaw]] and the designs by [[Roger Furse]], but Olivier's performance in the title role attracted superlatives.{{sfn|Holden|1988|pp=294–295}} To [[J. C. Trewin]], Olivier's was &quot;the finest [[Macbeth (character)|Macbeth]] of our day&quot;; to Darlington it was &quot;the best Macbeth of our time&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;trewin-macbeth&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Darlington|1968|p=82}} Leigh's [[Lady Macbeth]] received mixed but generally polite notices,&lt;ref name=&quot;trewin-macbeth&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;times-1955-macbeth&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tynan-macbeth&quot;/&gt; although to the end of his life Olivier believed it to have been the best Lady Macbeth he ever saw.{{sfn|Holden|1988|p=298}}

[[File:Vivien Leigh in Laurence Olivier na brzovlaku v Mariboru 1957.jpg|alt=woman and man seated and looking towards camera|thumb|Olivier and Leigh in 1957]]
In their third production of the 1955 Stratford season, Olivier played the title role in ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'', with Leigh as Lavinia. Her notices in the part were damning,{{efn|Tynan wrote in ''The Observer'', &quot;As Lavinia, Vivien Leigh receives the news that she is about to be ravished on her husband's corpse with little more than the mild annoyance of one who would have preferred foam rubber&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tynan-titus&quot;/&gt;}} but the production by [[Peter Brook]] and Olivier's performance as Titus received the greatest ovation in Stratford history from the first-night audience, and the critics hailed the production as a landmark in post-war British theatre.{{sfn|Holden|1988|pp=296–297}} Olivier and Brook revived the production for a continental tour in June 1957; its final performance, which closed the old [[Stoll Theatre]] in London, was the last time Leigh and Olivier acted together.{{sfn|Darlington|1968|p=82}}

Leigh became pregnant in 1956 and withdrew from the production of Coward's comedy ''[[South Sea Bubble (play)|South Sea Bubble]]''.{{sfn|Coward|1983|p=327}} The day after her final performance in the play she miscarried and entered a period of depression that lasted for months.{{sfnm|1a1=Coward|1y=1983|1pp=330, 358|2a1=Coleman|2y=2006|2pp=284–285}} The same year Olivier decided to direct and produce a film version of ''[[The Sleeping Prince (play)|The Sleeping Prince]]'', retitled ''[[The Prince and the Showgirl]]''. Instead of appearing with Leigh, he cast [[Marilyn Monroe]] as the showgirl. Although the filming was challenging because of Monroe's behaviour, the film was appreciated by the critics.{{sfn|Coleman|2006|p=287}}

===Royal Court and Chichester (1957–1963)===
During the production of ''The Prince and the Showgirl'', Olivier, Monroe and her husband, the American playwright [[Arthur Miller]], went to see the English Stage Company's production of [[John Osborne]]'s ''[[Look Back in Anger]]'' at the [[Royal Court Theatre|Royal Court]]. Olivier had seen the play earlier in the run and disliked it, but Miller was convinced that Osborne had talent, and Olivier reconsidered. He was ready for a change of direction; in 1981 he wrote:
{{quote|I had reached a stage in my life that I was getting profoundly sick of—not just tired—sick. Consequently the public were, likely enough, beginning to agree with me. My rhythm of work had become a bit deadly: a classical or semi-classical film; a play or two at Stratford, or a nine-month run in the West End, etc etc. I was going mad, desperately searching for something suddenly fresh and thrillingly exciting. What I felt to be my image was boring me to death.{{sfn|Findlater|1981|p=40}}}}

[[File:Laurence Olivier and Joan Plowright 1960.jpg|thumb|alt=middle-aged man with young woman on stage|Olivier, with [[Joan Plowright]] in ''[[The Entertainer (play)|The Entertainer]]'' on Broadway in 1958]]
Osborne was already at work on a new play, ''[[The Entertainer (play)|The Entertainer]]'', an allegory of Britain's post-colonial decline, centred on a seedy [[variety show|variety]] comedian, Archie Rice. Having read the first act—all that was completed by then—Olivier asked to be cast in the part. He had for years maintained that he might easily have been a third-rate comedian called &quot;Larry Oliver&quot;, and would sometimes play the character at parties. Behind Archie's brazen façade there is a deep desolation, and Olivier caught both aspects, switching, in the words of the biographer [[Anthony Holden]], &quot;from a gleefully tacky comic routine to moments of the most wrenching pathos&quot;.{{sfn|Holden|1988|pp=314–316}} [[Tony Richardson]]'s production for the English Stage Company transferred from the Royal Court to the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]] in September 1957; after that it toured and returned to the Palace.&lt;ref name=&quot;times-entertainer&quot;/&gt; The role of Archie's daughter Jean was taken by three actresses during the various runs. The second of them was [[Joan Plowright]], with whom Olivier began a relationship that endured for the rest of his life.{{efn|The other two Jeans were [[Dorothy Tutin]] at the Royal Court, and [[Geraldine McEwan]] for part of the run at the Palace.&lt;ref name=&quot;times-entertainer&quot;/&gt; Plowright rejoined the cast when the production opened in New York in February 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-entertainer&quot;/&gt;}} Olivier said that playing Archie &quot;made me feel like a modern actor again&quot;.{{sfn|Holden|1988|p=318}} In finding an ''avant-garde'' play that suited him, he was, as Osborne remarked, far ahead of Gielgud and Ralph Richardson, who did not successfully follow his lead for more than a decade.{{sfn|Bragg|1989|p=99}}{{efn|In 1955 Richardson, advised by Gielgud, had turned down the role of Estragon in [[Peter Hall (director)|Peter Hall]]'s premiere of the English-language version of [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' and later reproached himself for missing the chance to be in &quot;the greatest play of my generation&quot;.{{sfn|Miller|1995|pp=162–163}}}} Their first substantial successes in works by any of Osborne's generation were [[Alan Bennett]]'s ''[[Forty Years On (play)|Forty Years On]]'' (Gielgud in 1968) and [[David Storey]]'s ''[[Home (play)|Home]]'' (Richardson and Gielgud in 1970).{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=1995|1pp=228–229|2a1=Croall|2y=2000|2p=456}}

Olivier received another BAFTA nomination for his supporting role in 1959's ''[[The Devil's Disciple (1959 film)|The Devil's Disciple]]''.&lt;ref name=BAFTA/&gt; The same year, after a gap of two decades, Olivier returned to the role of Coriolanus, in a Stratford production directed by the 28-year-old [[Peter Hall (director)|Peter Hall]]. Olivier's performance received strong praise from the critics for its fierce athleticism combined with an emotional vulnerability.{{sfn|Billington|2004}} In 1960 he made his second appearance for the Royal Court company in [[Eugène Ionesco|Ionesco]]'s [[Theatre of the Absurd|absurdist]] play ''[[Rhinoceros (play)|Rhinoceros]]''. The production was chiefly remarkable for the star's quarrels with the director, Orson Welles, who according to the biographer [[Francis Beckett]] suffered the &quot;appalling treatment&quot; that Olivier had inflicted on Gielgud at Stratford five years earlier. Olivier again ignored his director and undermined his authority.{{sfn|Beckett|2005|p=106}} In 1960 and 1961 Olivier appeared in Anouilh's ''[[Becket]]'' on Broadway, first in the title role, with [[Anthony Quinn]] as the king, and later exchanging roles with his co-star.{{sfn|Billington|2004}}

[[File:Spartacus - 1960 - poster.png|thumb|alt=colourful Hollywood film poster|Poster for [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'', one of two films in which Olivier appeared in 1960]]
Two films featuring Olivier were released in 1960. The first—filmed in 1959—was ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'', in which he portrayed the Roman general, [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]].{{sfn|Coleman|2006|p=318}} His second was ''[[The Entertainer (film)|The Entertainer]]'', shot while he was appearing in ''Coriolanus''; the film was well received by the critics, but not as warmly as the stage show had been.{{sfn|Munn|2007|p=23}} The reviewer for ''The Guardian'' thought the performances were good, and wrote that Olivier &quot;on the screen as on the stage, achieves the tour de force of bringing Archie Rice&amp;nbsp;... to life&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guard: Entertainer&quot;/&gt; For his performance, Olivier was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oscar: Entertainer&quot;/&gt; He also made an adaptation of ''[[The Moon and Sixpence]]'' in 1960, winning an [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy Award]].{{sfn|Tanitch|1985|pp=188–189}}

The Oliviers' marriage was disintegrating during the late 1950s. While directing [[Charlton Heston]] in the 1960 play ''The Tumbler'', Olivier divulged that &quot;Vivien is several thousand miles away, trembling on the edge of a cliff, even when she's sitting quietly in her own drawing room&quot;, at a time when she was threatening suicide.{{sfn|Munn|2007|pp=197–200}} In May 1960 divorce proceedings started; Leigh reported the fact to the press and informed reporters of Olivier's relationship with Plowright.{{sfn|Coleman|2006|p=326}} The [[decree nisi|decree ''nisi'']] was issued in December 1960, which enabled him to marry Plowright in March 1961.{{sfn|Coleman|2006|pp=330 and 334}} A son, Richard, was born in December 1961; two daughters followed, Tamsin Agnes Margaret—born in January 1963—and actress Julie-Kate, born in July 1966.{{sfn|Munn|2007|pp=205, 209 and 218}}

In 1961 Olivier accepted the directorship of a new theatrical venture, the [[Chichester Festival]]. For the opening season in 1962 he directed two neglected 17th-century English plays, [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]'s 1638 comedy ''The Chances'' and [[John Ford (dramatist)|John Ford]]'s 1633 tragedy ''[[The Broken Heart]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;times-chichester-1&quot;/&gt; followed by ''Uncle Vanya''. The company he recruited was forty strong and included Thorndike, Casson, Redgrave, [[Athene Seyler]], [[John Neville (actor)|John Neville]] and Plowright.&lt;ref name=&quot;times-chichester-1&quot;/&gt; The first two plays were politely received; the Chekhov production attracted rapturous notices. ''The Times'' commented, &quot;It is doubtful if the [[Moscow Arts Theatre]] itself could improve on this production.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;times-chichester-2&quot;/&gt; The second Chichester season the following year consisted of a revival of ''Uncle Vanya'' and two new productions—Shaw's ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'' and [[John Arden]]'s ''The Workhouse Donkey''.&lt;ref name=&quot;times-chichester-3&quot;/&gt; In 1963 Olivier received another BAFTA nomination for his leading role as a schoolteacher accused of sexually molesting a student in the film ''[[Term of Trial]]''.&lt;ref name=BAFTA/&gt;

===National Theatre===

====1963–1968====
At around the time the Chichester Festival opened, plans for the creation of the National Theatre were coming to fruition. The British government agreed to release funds for a new building on the [[South Bank]] of the Thames.{{sfn|Billington| 2004}} [[Oliver Lyttelton, 1st Viscount Chandos|Lord Chandos]] was appointed chairman of the National Theatre Board in 1962, and in August Olivier accepted its invitation to be the company's first director. As his assistants, he recruited the directors [[John Dexter]] and [[William Gaskill]], with [[Kenneth Tynan]] as literary adviser or &quot;[[dramaturge]]&quot;.{{sfn|Holden|1988|pp=356 and 368}} Pending the construction of the new theatre, the company was based at the Old Vic. With the agreement of both organisations, Olivier remained in overall charge of the Chichester Festival during the first three seasons of the National; he used the festivals of 1964 and 1965 to give preliminary runs to plays he hoped to stage at the Old Vic.{{sfn|Darlington|1968|p=90}}

The opening production of the National Theatre was ''Hamlet'' in October 1963, starring [[Peter O'Toole]] and directed by Olivier. O'Toole was a guest star, one of occasional exceptions to Olivier's policy of casting productions from a regular company. Among those who made a mark during Olivier's directorship were [[Michael Gambon]], [[Maggie Smith]], [[Alan Bates]], Derek Jacobi and [[Anthony Hopkins]]. It was widely remarked that Olivier seemed reluctant to recruit his peers to perform with his company.&lt;ref name=&quot;times-obit&quot;/&gt; Evans, Gielgud and [[Paul Scofield]] guested only briefly, and Ashcroft and Richardson never appeared at the National during Olivier's time.{{efn|Billington describes Olivier's attitude to Richardson and others as &quot;most ungenerous&quot;.{{sfn|Billington|2004}}}} [[Robert Stephens]], a member of the company, observed, &quot;Olivier's one great fault was a paranoid jealousy of anyone who he thought was a rival&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;lewis-sunday-times&quot;/&gt;

In his decade in charge of the National, Olivier acted in thirteen plays and directed eight.&lt;ref name=&quot;nt-olivier&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/discover-more/artists/laurence-olivier-nt-50th | title=Laurence Olivier| publisher = Royal National Theatre | accessdate=9 January 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203103659/http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/discover-more/artists/laurence-olivier-nt-50th | archivedate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the roles he played were minor characters, including a crazed butler in [[Georges Feydeau|Feydeau]]'s ''[[A Flea in Her Ear]]'' and a pompous solicitor in [[Somerset Maugham|Maugham]]'s ''Home and Beauty''; the vulgar soldier Captain Brazen in [[George Farquhar|Farquhar]]'s 1706 comedy ''[[The Recruiting Officer]]'' was a larger role but not the leading one.&lt;ref name=&quot;recruiting-officer&quot;/&gt; Apart from his Astrov in the ''Uncle Vanya'', familiar from Chichester, his first leading role for the National was Othello, directed by Dexter in 1964. The production was a box-office success and was revived regularly over the next five seasons.{{sfn|Holden|1988|p=403}} His performance divided opinion. Most of the reviewers and theatrical colleagues praised it highly; [[Franco Zeffirelli]] called it &quot;an anthology of everything that has been discovered about acting in the past three centuries.&quot;{{sfn|Holden|1988|pp=379 and 382}} Dissenting voices included ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'', which called it &quot;the kind of bad acting of which only a great actor is capable&amp;nbsp;... near the frontiers of self-parody&quot;;{{sfn|Holden|1988|p=379}} the director [[Jonathan Miller]] thought it &quot;a condescending view of an Afro Caribbean person&quot;.&lt;ref name=walker/&gt; The burden of playing this demanding part at the same time as managing the new company and planning for the move to the new theatre took its toll on Olivier. To add to his load, he felt obliged to take over as Solness in ''[[The Master Builder]]'' when the ailing Redgrave withdrew from the role in November 1964.{{sfn|Holden|1988|p=385}}{{efn|Because of this additional commitment, Olivier had to drop his plan to direct Coward's ''[[Hay Fever (play)|Hay Fever]]''.{{sfn|Coward|1983|p=566}} The author took over the production with a cast, headed by Edith Evans, that Coward said could successfully have played the Albanian telephone directory.{{sfn|Morley|1974|p=369}}}} For the first time Olivier began to suffer from [[stage fright]], which plagued him for several years.{{sfn|Bragg|1989|pp=107–108}} The National Theatre production of ''Othello'' was released [[Othello (1965 British film)|as a film]] in 1965, which earned four Academy Award nominations, including another for Best Actor for Olivier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oscar: Othello&quot;/&gt;

During the following year Olivier concentrated on management, directing one production (''[[The Crucible]]''), taking the comic role of the foppish Tattle in [[William Congreve|Congreve]]'s ''[[Love for Love]]'', and making one film, ''[[Bunny Lake is Missing]]'', in which he and Coward were on the same bill for the first time since ''Private Lives''.{{sfn|Day|2005|p=159}} In 1966, his one play as director was ''[[Juno and the Paycock]]''. ''The Times'' commented that the production &quot;restores one's faith in the work as a masterpiece&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;paycock&quot;/&gt; In the same year Olivier portrayed the [[Mahdi]], opposite Heston as [[Charles George Gordon|General Gordon]], in the film ''[[Khartoum (film)|Khartoum]]''.{{sfn|Darlington|1968|p=44}}

In 1967 Olivier was caught in the middle of a confrontation between Chandos and Tynan over the latter's proposal to stage [[Rolf Hochhuth]]'s ''[[Rolf Hochhuth#Soldiers|Soldiers]]''. As the play speculatively depicted Churchill as complicit in the assassination of the Polish prime minister [[Władysław Sikorski]], Chandos regarded it as indefensible. At his urging the board unanimously vetoed the production. Tynan considered resigning over this interference with the management's artistic freedom, but Olivier himself stayed firmly in place, and Tynan also remained.{{sfn|Holden|1988|pp=396–397}} At about this time Olivier began a long struggle against a succession of illnesses. He was treated for [[prostate cancer]] and, during rehearsals for his production of Chekhov's ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'' he was hospitalised with pneumonia.{{sfn|Coleman|2006|pp=382–383}} He recovered enough to take the heavy role of Edgar in [[August Strindberg|Strindberg]]'s ''[[The Dance of Death (Strindberg)|The Dance of Death]]'', the finest of all his performances other than in Shakespeare, in Gielgud's view.{{sfn|Bragg|1989|p=108}}

====1968–1974====
Olivier had intended to step down from the directorship of the National Theatre at the end of his first five-year contract, having, he hoped, led the company into its new building. By 1968 because of bureaucratic delays construction work had not even begun, and he agreed to serve for a second five-year term.{{sfn|Holden|1988|p=405}} His next major role, and his last appearance in a Shakespeare play, was as [[Shylock]] in ''The Merchant of Venice'', his first appearance in the work.{{efn|With the exception of a walk-on role in a matinée performance of scenes from the play in 1926, with Thorndike as Portia.&lt;ref name=&quot;merchant-1926&quot;/&gt;}} He had intended Guinness or Scofield to play Shylock, but stepped in when neither was available.{{sfn|Coleman|2006|p=397}} The production by Jonathan Miller, and Olivier's performance, attracted a wide range of responses. Two different critics reviewed it for ''The Guardian'': one wrote &quot;this is not a role which stretches him, or for which he will be particularly remembered&quot;; the other commented that the performance &quot;ranks as one of his greatest achievements, involving his whole range&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-merchant1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-merchant2&quot;/&gt;

In 1969 Olivier appeared in two war films, portraying military leaders. He played Field Marshal [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|French]] in the First World War film ''[[Oh! What a Lovely War]]'', for which he won another BAFTA award,&lt;ref name=BAFTA/&gt; followed by Air Chief Marshal [[Hugh Dowding, 1st Baron Dowding|Hugh Dowding]] in ''[[Battle of Britain (film)|Battle of Britain]]''.{{sfn|Munn|2007|p=222}} In June 1970 he became the first actor to be created a peer for services to the theatre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guard: Peerage 1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guard: Peerage 2&quot;/&gt; Although he initially declined the honour, [[Harold Wilson]], the incumbent prime minister, wrote to him, then invited him and Plowright to dinner, and persuaded him to accept.{{sfn|Olivier|1994|pp=303–304}}

[[File:Laurence Olivier Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|alt=elegantly ageing man in cravat|right|Laurence Olivier in 1972, during the production of ''[[Sleuth (1972 film)|Sleuth]]'']]
After this Olivier played three more stage roles: James Tyrone in [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''[[Long Day's Journey into Night]]'' (1971–72), Antonio in [[Eduardo de Filippo]]'s ''Saturday, Sunday, Monday'' and John Tagg in [[Trevor Griffiths]]'s ''The Party'' (both 1973–74). Among the roles he hoped to play, but could not because of ill-health, was Nathan Detroit in the musical ''[[Guys and Dolls]]''.{{sfn|Holden|1988|p=220}} In 1972 he took leave of absence from the National to star opposite [[Michael Caine]] in [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]]'s film of [[Anthony Shaffer (writer)|Anthony Shaffer]]'s ''[[Sleuth (1972 film)|Sleuth]]'', which ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'' considered to be &quot;Olivier at his twinkling, eye-rolling best&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;ILN: Sleuth&quot;/&gt; both he and Caine were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, losing to [[Marlon Brando]] in ''[[The Godfather]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oscar: Sleuth&quot;/&gt;

The last two stage plays Olivier directed were [[Jean Giradoux]]'s ''[[Amphitryon 38|Amphitryon]]'' (1971) and Priestley's ''[[Eden End]]'' (1974).{{sfn|Holden|1988|pp=465–466}} By the time of ''Eden End'', he was no longer director of the National Theatre; Peter Hall took over on 1 November 1973.{{sfn|Hall| 1984|p=50}} The succession was tactlessly handled by the board, and Olivier felt that he had been eased out—although he had declared his intention to go—and that he had not been properly consulted about the choice of successor.{{sfn|Hall|1984|pp=8–9}} The largest of the three theatres within the National's new building was named in his honour, but his only appearance on the stage of the Olivier Theatre was at its official opening by the Queen in October 1976, when he made a speech of welcome, which Hall privately described as the most successful part of the evening.{{sfn|Hall|1984|p=266}}

===Later years (1975–1989)===
Olivier spent the last 15 years of his life securing his finances and dealing with deteriorating health,{{sfn|Billington|2004}} which included thrombosis and [[dermatomyositis]], a degenerative muscle disorder.{{sfn|Coleman|2006|pp=419–420}}&lt;ref name=&quot;EB: LO&quot;/&gt; Professionally, and to provide financial security, he made a series of advertisements for [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] cameras in 1972, although he stipulated that they must never be shown in Britain; he also took a number of cameo film roles, which were in &quot;often undistinguished films&quot;, according to Billington.{{sfnm|1a1=Billington|1y=2004|2a1=Coleman|2y=2006|2p=413}} Olivier's move from leading parts to supporting and cameo roles came about because his poor health meant he could not get the necessary long insurance for larger parts, with only short engagements in films available.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guard: Insurance&quot;/&gt;

Olivier's dermatomyositis meant he spent the last three months of 1974 in hospital, and he spent early 1975 slowly recovering and regaining his strength. When strong enough, he was contacted by the director [[John Schlesinger]], who offered him the role of a Nazi torturer in the 1976 film ''[[Marathon Man (film)|Marathon Man]]''. Olivier shaved his pate and wore oversized glasses to enlarge the look of his eyes, in a role that the critic [[David Robinson (film critic)|David Robinson]], writing for ''The Times'', thought was &quot;strongly played&quot;, adding that Olivier was &quot;always at his best in roles that call for him to be seedy or nasty or both&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times: Marathon&quot;/&gt; Olivier was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, and won the Golden Globe of the same category.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oscar: Marathon&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;globes: Marathon&quot;/&gt;

In the mid-1970s Olivier became increasingly involved in television work, a medium of which he was initially dismissive.{{sfn|Billington|2004}} In 1973 he provided the narration for a 26-episode documentary, ''[[The World at War]]'', which chronicled the events of the Second World War, and won a second Emmy Award for ''[[Long Day's Journey into Night (1973 film)|Long Day's Journey into Night]]'' (1973). In 1975 he won another Emmy for ''[[Love Among the Ruins (film)|Love Among the Ruins]]''.{{sfn|Tanitch|1985|pp=188–189}} The following year he appeared in adaptations of Tennessee Williams's ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'' and [[Harold Pinter]]'s ''[[The Collection (play)|The Collection]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Coleman|1y=2006|1p=592|2a1=Munn|2y=2007|2pp=245–246}} Olivier portrayed the [[Pharisee]] [[Nicodemus]] in Franco Zeffirelli's 1977 miniseries ''[[Jesus of Nazareth (miniseries)|Jesus of Nazareth]]''.  In 1978 he appeared in the film ''[[The Boys from Brazil (film)|The Boys from Brazil]]'', playing the role of Ezra Lieberman, an ageing [[Nazi hunter]]; he received his eleventh Academy Award nomination. Although he did not win the Oscar, he was presented with an Honorary Award for his lifetime achievement.{{sfn|Coleman|2006|pp=445 and 461}}

Olivier continued working in film into the 1980s, with roles in ''[[The Jazz Singer (1980 film)|The Jazz Singer]]'' (1980), ''[[Inchon (film)|Inchon]]'' (1981), ''[[The Bounty (1984 film)|The Bounty]]'' (1984) and ''[[Wild Geese II]]'' (1985).{{sfn|Munn|2007|p=282}} He continued to work in television; in 1981 he appeared as Lord Marchmain in ''[[Brideshead Revisited (TV serial)|Brideshead Revisited]]'', winning another Emmy, and the following year he received his tenth and last BAFTA nomination in the television adaptation of [[John Mortimer]]'s stage play ''[[A Voyage Round My Father]]''.&lt;ref name=BAFTA/&gt; In 1983 he played his last Shakespearean role as Lear in ''[[King Lear (1983 TV programme)|King Lear]]'', for Granada Television, earning his fifth Emmy.{{sfn|Tanitch|1985|pp=188–189}} He thought the role of Lear much less demanding than other tragic Shakespearean heroes: &quot;No, Lear is easy. He's like all of us, really: he's just a stupid old fart.&quot;{{sfn|Olivier|1986|p=93}} When the production was first shown on American television, the critic Steve Vineberg wrote:
{{quote|Olivier seems to have thrown away technique this time—his is a breathtakingly pure Lear. In his final speech, over Cordelia's lifeless body, he brings us so close to Lear's sorrow that we can hardly bear to watch, because we have seen the last Shakespearean hero Laurence Olivier will ever play. But what a finale! In this most sublime of plays, our greatest actor has given an indelible performance. Perhaps it would be most appropriate to express simple gratitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;vineberg&quot;/&gt;}}

The same year he also appeared in a cameo alongside Gielgud and Richardson in ''[[Wagner (film)|Wagner]]'', with Burton in the title role;{{sfn|Tanitch|1985|p=175}} his final screen appearance was as an elderly, wheelchair-bound soldier in [[Derek Jarman]]'s 1989 film ''[[War Requiem (film)|War Requiem]]''.{{sfn|Coleman|2006|p=495}}

After being ill for the last 22 years of his life, Olivier died of [[kidney failure]] on 11 July 1989 aged 82 at his home near [[Steyning]], [[West Sussex]]. His cremation was held three days later;{{sfnm|1a1=Billington|1y=2004|2a1=Coleman|2y=2006|2p=497}} his ashes were buried in [[Poets' Corner]] of [[Westminster Abbey]] during a memorial service in October that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB: LO&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Munn|2007|p=268}}

Olivier was appointed [[Knight Bachelor]] in the [[1947 Birthday Honours]] for services to the stage and to films.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=37977 |date=6 June 1947 |page=2572 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[life peerage]] followed in the [[1970 Birthday Honours]] for services to the theatre;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=45117 |date=5 June 1970 |page=6365 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was subsequently created Baron Olivier, of Brighton in the County of Sussex.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=45319 |date=9 March 1971 |page=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olivier was later appointed to the [[Order of Merit]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=48524 |date=13 February 1981 |page=2145}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also received honours from foreign governments. In 1949 he was made Commander of the [[Order of the Dannebrog]] by the Danish king [[Frederick IX of Denmark|Frederick IX]]; the French appointed him ''{{lang|fr|Officier}}'', [[Legion of Honour]], in 1953; the Italian government created him ''{{lang|it|Grande Ufficiale}}'', [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic]], in 1953; and in 1971 he was granted the Order of Yugoslav Flag with Golden Wreath.&lt;ref name=&quot;who&quot;/&gt;

From academic and other institutions, Olivier received honorary doctorates from [[Tufts University]] in [[Massachusetts]] (1946), [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] (1957) and [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]] (1964). He was also awarded the Danish [[Sonning Prize]] in 1966, the Gold Medallion of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities]] in 1968; and the [[Albert Medal (Royal Society of Arts)|Albert Medal]] of the [[Royal Society of Arts]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;who&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Coleman|2006|loc=photo 39, facing p. 416}}{{efn|Olivier was also offered an honorary degree from [[Yale University]], but was unable to receive it.{{sfn|Coleman|2006|loc=photo 39, facing p. 416}}}}

For his work in films, Olivier received four [[Academy Awards]]: an honorary award for ''Henry V'' (1947), a Best Actor award and one as producer for ''Hamlet'' (1948), and a second honorary award in 1979 to recognise his lifetime of contribution to the art of film. He was nominated for nine other acting Oscars and one each for production and direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oscars.org/search/site/olivier | title=Olivier|publisher= Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences | accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also won two [[British Academy Film Awards]] out of ten nominations,{{efn|For ''Richard III'' (1955) and ''Oh!

In February 1960, for his contribution to the film industry, Olivier was inducted into the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], with a star at 6319 [[Hollywood Boulevard]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Walk of fame&quot;/&gt; he is included in the [[American Theater Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall o F&quot;/&gt; In 1977 Olivier was awarded a [[British Film Institute Fellowship]].{{sfn|Shail|2007|p=158}}

In addition to the naming of the National Theatre's largest auditorium in Olivier's honour, he is commemorated in the [[Laurence Olivier Awards]], bestowed annually since 1984 by the [[The Society of London Theatre|Society of West End Theatre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;who&quot;/&gt; In 1991 Gielgud unveiled a memorial stone commemorating Olivier in Poets' Corner at Westminster Abbey.{{sfn|Gielgud|2004|p=483}} In 2007, the centenary of Olivier's birth, a life-sized statue of him was unveiled on the South Bank, outside the National Theatre;&lt;ref name=&quot;D Tel: Statue&quot;/&gt; the same year the BFI held a retrospective season of his film work.&lt;ref name=&quot;TO: BFI season&quot;/&gt;

==Technique and reputation==
Olivier's acting technique was minutely crafted, and he was known for changing his appearance considerably from role to role. By his own admission, he was addicted to extravagant make-up,{{sfn|Holden|1988|p=3}} and unlike Richardson and Gielgud, he excelled at different voices and accents.{{sfnm|1a1=O'Connor|1y=1982|1p=60|2a1=Croall|2y=2013|2p=128}}{{efn|The American film director [[William Wyler]] said that Olivier's performance in the film ''Carrie'' was &quot;the truest and best portrayal on film of an American by an Englishman&quot;.{{sfn|Holden|1988|p=216}}}} His own description of his technique was &quot;working from the outside in&quot;;{{sfn|Holden|1988|p=2}} he said, &quot;I can never act as myself, I have to have a pillow up my jumper, a false nose or a moustache or wig{{space}}... I cannot come on looking like me and be someone else.&quot;{{sfn|Holden|1988|p=3}} Rattigan described how at rehearsals Olivier &quot;built his performance slowly and with immense application from a mass of tiny details&quot;.{{sfn|Holden|1988|p=281}} This attention to detail had its critics: Agate remarked, &quot;When I look at a watch it is to see the time and not to admire the mechanism. I want an actor to tell me Lear's time of day and Olivier doesn't. He bids me watch the wheels go round.&quot;{{sfn|Bragg|1989|p=90}}

[[File:Laurence Olivier (borders removed).jpg|thumb|alt=head and shoulders semi-profile shot of man in this thirties|Olivier in 1939]]
Tynan remarked to Olivier, &quot;you aren't really a contemplative or philosophical actor&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;tynan-interview&quot;/&gt; Olivier was known for the strenuous physicality of his performances in some roles. He told Tynan this was because he was influenced as a young man by [[Douglas Fairbanks]], [[Ramon Navarro]] and John Barrymore in films, and Barrymore on stage as Hamlet: &quot;tremendously athletic. I admired that greatly, all of us did.&amp;nbsp;... One thought of oneself, idiotically, skinny as I was, as a sort of Tarzan.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tynan-interview&quot;/&gt;{{efn|Billington cites one of the best known instances of Olivier's physicality: &quot;a sense of daring [which] showed itself, physically, in such feats as his famous headlong deathfall off a 12-foot-high platform in ''Coriolanus'' (Olivier was 52 at the time).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-25-anniv&quot;/&gt;}} According to Morley, Gielgud was widely considered &quot;the best actor in the world from the neck up and Olivier from the neck down.&quot;{{sfn|Morley|2001|p=123}} Olivier described the contrast thus: &quot;I've always thought that we were the reverses of the same coin{{space}}... the top half John, all spirituality, all beauty, all abstract things; and myself as all earth, blood, humanity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tynan-interview&quot;/&gt;

Together with Richardson and Gielgud, Olivier was internationally recognised as one of the &quot;great trinity of theatrical knights&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;strachan&quot;/&gt; who dominated the British stage during the middle and later decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;heilpern&quot;/&gt; In an obituary tribute in ''The Times'', Bernard Levin wrote, &quot;What we have lost with Laurence Olivier is ''glory''. He reflected it in his greatest roles; indeed he walked clad in it—you could practically see it glowing around him like a nimbus.{{space}}... no one will ever play the roles he played as he played them; no one will replace the splendour that he gave his native land with his genius.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;levin-obit-times&quot;/&gt; Billington commented:
{{quote|[Olivier] elevated the art of acting in the twentieth century&amp;nbsp;... principally by the overwhelming force of his example. Like Garrick, Kean, and Irving before him, he lent glamour and excitement to acting so that, in any theatre in the world, an Olivier night raised the level of expectation and sent spectators out into the darkness a little more aware of themselves and having experienced a transcendent touch of ecstasy. That, in the end, was the true measure of his greatness.{{sfn|Billington|2004}}}}

After Olivier's death, Gielgud reflected, &quot;He followed in the theatrical tradition of Kean and Irving. He respected tradition in the theatre, but he also took great delight in breaking tradition, which is what made him so unique. He was gifted, brilliant, and one of the great controversial figures of our time in theatre, which is a virtue and not a vice at all.&quot;{{sfn|Munn|2007|p=269}}

Olivier said in 1963 that he believed he was born to be an actor,{{sfn|Holden|1988|p=7}} but his colleague [[Peter Ustinov]] disagreed; he commented that although Olivier's great contemporaries were clearly predestined for the stage, &quot;Larry could have been a notable ambassador, a considerable minister, a redoubtable cleric. At his worst, he would have acted the parts more ably than they are usually lived.&quot;{{sfn|Ustinov|1978|p=279}} The director David Ayliff agreed that acting did not come instinctively to Olivier as it did to his great rivals. He observed, &quot;Ralph was a natural actor, he couldn't stop being a perfect actor; Olivier did it through sheer hard work and determination.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayliff interview&quot;/&gt; The American actor [[William Redfield (actor)|William Redfield]] had a similar view:
{{quote|Ironically enough, Laurence Olivier is less gifted than Marlon Brando. He is even less gifted than Richard Burton, Paul Scofield, Ralph Richardson and John Gielgud. But he is still the definitive actor of the twentieth century. Why? Because he wanted to be. His achievements are due to dedication, scholarship, practice, determination and courage. He is the bravest actor of our time.{{sfn|Darlington|1968|p=91}}|}}

In comparing Olivier and the other leading actors of his generation, Ustinov wrote, &quot;It is of course vain to talk of who is and who is not the greatest actor. There is simply no such thing as a greatest actor, or painter or composer&quot;.{{sfn|Ustinov|1978|p=200}} Nonetheless, some colleagues, particularly film actors such as [[Spencer Tracy]], [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Lauren Bacall]], came to regard Olivier as the finest of his peers.{{sfn|Bacall|2006|pages=214–215}} Peter Hall, though acknowledging Olivier as the head of the theatrical profession,{{sfn|Hall|1984|p=xi}} thought Richardson the greater actor.&lt;ref name=&quot;walker&quot;/&gt; Olivier's claim to theatrical greatness lay not only in his acting, but as, in Hall's words, &quot;the supreme man of the theatre of our time&quot;,{{sfn|Hall|1984|p=ix}} pioneering Britain's National Theatre.&lt;ref name=&quot;times-obit&quot;/&gt; As Bragg identified, &quot;no one doubts that the National is perhaps his most enduring monument&quot;.{{sfn|Bragg|1989|p=103}}

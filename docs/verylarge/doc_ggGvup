There are still areas in the world where lashing spars (or poles) is the basic means of building.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Types==

===Square lashing===

'''Square lashing''' is a type of lashing used to bind spars together, at right angles to one another. There are different types, but all consist of a series of wraps around the spars, and frapping around the line running between the spars.

===Diagonal lashing===

'''Diagonal lashing''' is a type of lashing used to bind [[spar (sailing)|spar]]s or poles together, to prevent racking. It gets its name from the fact that the wrapping turns cross the poles diagonally and is used to spring poles together where they do not touch as in the X-brace of a trestle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scoutpioneering.com/2014/12/14/traditional-diagonal-lashing/|title=Traditional Diagonal Lashing|first=Larry|last=Green|date=14 December 2014|publisher=scoutpioneering.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shear lashing===

'''Shear lashing''' (two-spar shear lashing) also spelled &quot;sheer lashing&quot; is used for lashing together two parallel spars which will be opened out of the parallel to form sheer legs as in the formation of an A-frame. The clove hitch is tied around one leg only and frapping turns are taken between the poles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scoutpioneering.com/2013/10/14/the-somewhat-ambiguous-shear-lashing/|title=The Somewhat Ambiguous Shear Lashing|first=Larry|last=Green|date=14 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Round lashing ===

The '''round lashing''' is most frequently used to join two poles together to extend their length. Typically, two lashings are used a reasonable distance apart for extra strength. In the simple version, a clove hitch is tied around both poles and there are no frapping turns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scoutpioneering.com/2014/01/27/four-different-lashings-to-extend-the-length-of-a-spar/|title=Four Different Lashings to Extend the Length of a Spar|first=Larry|last=Green|date=27 January 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tripod lashing===

The '''tripod lashing''' (also known as [[gyn]] lashing, of eight lashing, and three-spar shear lashing) is used to join three spars together to form a tripod.

It currently serves as the ''de facto'' administrative capital of the [[Palestinian National Authority]] (PNA). While historically an [[Arab Christian]] town, [[Muslim]]s constituted a majority of Ramallah's 27,902 residents by 2007,&lt;ref name=&quot;2007 PCBS Census&quot;&gt;[http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_Rainbow/Documents/ramallah.htm 2007 PCBS Population]. Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics. p.53. (Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt; with Christians making up a significant minority.

==History==
[[Rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel|Ancient rock-cut tombs]] have been found near Ramallah.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Conder|Kitchener|1883|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Potsherd]]s from the [[Crusader states|Crusader]]/[[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] and early Ottoman period have also been found there.&lt;ref name=Finkelstein&gt;{{harvnb|Finkelstein|Lederman|1997|p=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramallah has been identified with the [[Crusader states|Crusader]] place called ''Ramalie''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rey|1883|p=389}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prawer and Benvenisti, 1970, cited in Finkelstein and Lederman, 1997, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt; Remains of a building with an [[arch]]ed doorway from the Crusader era, called ''al-Burj,'' have been identified,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pringle|1997|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the original use of the building is undetermined.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pringle|1997|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman era===
Ramallah was incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1517 with all of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. In 1596 it was listed in the [[Defter|tax registers]] as being in the ''[[nahiya]]'' of Quds, part of the ''[[Jerusalem Sanjak|Liwa of Quds]].'' It had a population of 71 Christian households and 9 [[Muslim]] households. It paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on wheat, barley, olives, vines or fruit trees, and goats or beehives; a total of 9,400 [[akçe]]. All of the revenue went to a [[waqf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hütteroth|Abdulfattah|1977|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Ramallah was founded in the mid-1500s by the Haddadins (also: Haddad''ee''n), a clan of brothers descended from [[Ghassanids|Ghassanid]] [[Christians]]. The Haddadins (ancestors of the present-day Jadallah family, among others), and their leader Rashid El-Haddadin, arrived from east of the [[Jordan River]] from the areas of [[Al Karak|Karak]] and [[Shoubak]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://ramallahlaoc.org/history.aspx American Federation of Ramallah Palestine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029233225/http://www.ramallahlaoc.org/history.aspx |date=October 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Haddadin migration is attributed to fighting and unrest among clans in that area.

Rashid and his brothers were [[blacksmith]]s. The Haddadin name comes from the old ([[Aramaic]]ܚܕܕ or ܚܕܐܕ  ) word [[Haddad]], which translates to [[blacksmith]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Haddadin was attracted to the mountainous site of Ramallah because it was similar to the other mountainous areas he came from. In addition, the heavily forested area could supply him with plenty of fuel for his forges.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

In 1838 American biblical scholar [[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]] visited the area, noting that the inhabitants were Christian &quot;of the Greek rite&quot;. There were 200 taxable men, which gives an estimated total population of 800–900 people. The village &quot;belonged&quot; to the [[Haram al-Sharif]], Jerusalem, to which it paid an annual tax of 350 Mids of grain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robinson|Smith|1841|pp=133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883, the [[Palestine Exploration Fund|PEF]]'s ''[[PEF Survey of Palestine|Survey of Western Palestine]]'' described Ramallah as

&lt;blockquote&gt;A large Christian village, of well-built stone houses, standing on a high ridge, with a view on the west extending to the sea. It stands amongst gardens and olive-yards, and has three springs to the south and one on the west; on the north there are three more, within a mile from the village. On the east there is a well. There are rock-cut tombs to the north-east with well-cut entrances, but completely blocked with rubbish. In the village is a Greek church, and on the east a Latin convent and a Protestant schoolhouse, all modern buildings. The village lands are [[Wakuf]], or ecclesiastical property, belonging to the Haram of Jerusalem. About a quarter of the inhabitants are Roman Catholics, the rest Orthodox Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Conder|Kitchener|1883|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 21st century, a large community of people with direct descent from the Haddadins who founded Ramallah live in the United States. The town is now predominately Muslim, but still contains a Christian minority. The change in demographics is due mostly to new migration of Muslims to the area, and emigration of Christians from the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

====Christian presence====

Ramallah grew dramatically throughout the 17th and 18th centuries as an agricultural village, attracting more (predominantly Christian) inhabitants from all around the region. In 1700, Yacoub Elias was the first Ramallah native to be ordained by the Eastern [[Arab Orthodox|Greek Melkite Orthodox]] Church of Jerusalem, the Christian denomination that prevailed in the Holy Land at the time. In the early 19th century, the first Greek Melkite Jerusalemite Orthodox Christian church was built. Later in the 1850s, &quot;The Church of Transfiguration&quot;, was built to replace it; it is the sole [[Orthodox Church]] in Ramallah today. During that same decade, the Latin (Roman Catholic) Church established its presence in Ramallah, constituting the second largest Christian denomination in the city. The Roman Catholic Church established the [[St. Joseph]]'s Girls' School run by St. Joseph sisters, as well as the co-educational Al-Ahliyyah College high school runs by Rosary sisters. With the influx of Muslim and Christian [[Palestinian refugees|refugees]] and internal migration, new mosques and churches were built.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In the 19th century, the [[Religious Society of Friends]] ([[Quakers]]) established a presence in Ramallah and built the [[Ramallah Friends Schools]], one for girls and later a boys' school, to alleviate the dearth of education for women and girls. Eli and Sybil Jones opened &quot;The Girls Training Home of Ramallah&quot; in 1869. A medical clinic was established in 1883, with Dr. George Hassenauer serving as the first doctor in Ramallah. In 1889, the girls academy became the Friends Girls School (FGS). As the FGS was also a boarding school, it attracted a number of girls from surrounding communities, including Jerusalem, [[Lod|Lydda]], [[Jaffa]], and [[Beirut]]. The Friends Boys School (FBS) was founded in 1901 and opened in 1918. The Quakers opened a Friends Meeting House for worship in the city center in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palfriends.org/schoolhistory.php |title=Religious Society of Friends (Palestine) |publisher=Palfriends.org |access-date=November 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029211841/https://www.palfriends.org/schoolhistory.php |archive-date=October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the school's official website, most high school students choose to take the International Baccalaureate exams (IBE) instead of the traditional &quot;Tawjihi&quot; university exams.&lt;ref name=&quot;RamMuniRel&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palfriends.org/fbs/history.asp |title=History of Friends School |access-date=February 22, 2008 |work=Palestine Friends Boys School |publisher=Visuals Active Media |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071101091350/http://www.palfriends.org/fbs/history.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archive-date = November 1, 2007}} palfriends.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The activity of foreign churches in Palestine in the late 19th century increased awareness of prosperity in the West. In Ramallah and [[Bethlehem]], a few miles south, local residents began to seek economic opportunity overseas. In 1901, merchants from Ramallah emigrated to the United States and established import-export businesses, selling handmade rugs and other exotic wares across the Atlantic. Increased trade dramatically improved living standards for Ramallah's inhabitants. American cars, mechanized farming equipment, radios, and later televisions became attainable luxuries for upper-class families. As residents of Jaffa and Lydda moved to Ramallah, the balance of Muslims and Christians began to change.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Ramallah was declared a modern city in 1908. It had an elected municipality as well as partnership projects with the adjacent town of [[al-Bireh]]. [[Ramallah Friends Schools|The Friends Boys School]] became a temporary hospital during World War I.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

[[File:2010-08 Ramallah 39.jpg|thumb|right|An old Christian cemetery in Ramallah.]]

===British Rule===
The [[British Army]] [[Occupied Enemy Territory Administration|occupied]] Ramallah in December 1917 until the designation of the [[Mandate for Palestine|Palestine mandate]] in 1920, remaining under [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British rule]] until 1948. The economy improved in the 1920s, and the landed aristocracy and merchants of the Palestinian upper class built stately multi-storied villas, many of which still stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.koolpages.com/wael2003/history.htm |title=From a Village to a Town |access-date=February 22, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223214116/http://www.koolpages.com/wael2003/history.htm |archive-date=December 23, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jerusalem Electric Company brought electricity to Ramallah in 1936, and most homes were wired shortly thereafter. The same year the British inaugurated the &quot;Palestine Broadcasting Service&quot; in Ramallah. The [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] trained the local staff to deliver daily broadcasts in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and English. The station was later renamed &quot;[[Kol Yerushalayim]]&quot; (The Voice of Jerusalem).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/radio.html |title=The History of Radio in Israel |access-date=February 22, 2008 |work=Jewish Virtual Library |publisher=American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine]], Ramallah was a center of activities against the British. Nancy Parker McDowell&lt;ref&gt;''Notes from Ramallah, 1939''. Friends United Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; describes vividly how the British attacked Ramallah using the Air Force. Many residents were killed and wounded. The wounded had to be transferred to Jerusalem since no significant medical facilities existed in Ramallah.

===Jordanian era===
[[File:Ramallah Residential.JPG|thumb|right|Residential neighborhood in Ramallah.]]
Following the creation of the State of Israel and the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|ensuing war]], Jordan seized the part of Palestine they named the West Bank. This included Ramallah. The West Bank was relatively peaceful during the years of [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|Jordanian rule]] between 1948 and 1967, with its residents enjoying freedom of movement between the [[West Bank]], Jordan, [[Lebanon]], and Syria. Jordan annexed the West Bank, applying its national law to the conquered territory. However, many Palestinians were jailed for being members of &quot;illegal political parties&quot;, which included the [[Palestine Communist Party]] and other socialist and pro-independence groups. By 1953, Ramallah's population had doubled, but the economy and infrastructure could not accommodate the influx of poor villagers. Natives of Ramallah began to emigrate, primarily to the United States. By 1956, about one fourth of Ramallah's 6,000 natives had left, with Arabs from the surrounding towns and villages (particularly [[Hebron]]) buying the homes and land the émigrés left behind.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}
&lt;!-- Ramallah expatriates created one of the largest Arab communities in the United States, settling mainly in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], New York, Florida, California, Texas, and especially in [[Michigan]]. Many worked in the auto industry. In 1959, the American Federation of Ramallah, Palestine (AFRP) was established in [[Detroit]]. The AFRP has several branches in the United States, and holds an annual convention every summer attended by a sizable number of former Ramallah residents and their offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koolpages.com/wael2003/history.htm|title=koolpages.com/wael2003/history|access-date=October 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afrp.org/aboutus.aspx|title=afrp.org|access-date=October 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; will relocate to future demographics section (it has no relevance here whatsoever)--&gt;

===Israeli era===
[[File:2018 OCHA OpT map Ramallah.jpg|thumb|left|2018 [[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|United Nations]] map of the area, showing the [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank|Israeli occupation]] arrangements.]]
During the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, [[Israel]] captured Ramallah from Jordan, imposing a military closure and conducting a census a few weeks later. Every person registered in the census was given an Israeli identity card which allowed the bearer to continue to reside there. Those who were abroad during the census lost their residency rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.btselem.org/english/Family_Separation/Origins.asp &quot;Creation of the problem of family separation in the Occupied Territories&quot;] [[Btselem]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605003513/http://www.btselem.org/english/Family_Separation/Origins.asp |date=June 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For residents of Ramallah, the situation had now been reversed. For the first time in 19 years, residents could freely visit Israel and the [[Gaza Strip]] and engage in commerce there.

Unlike the Jordanians, Israel did not offer citizenship to the residents. Ramallah residents were issued permits to work in Israel, but did not gain the rights associated with Israeli citizenship. The city remained under Israeli military rule for more than four decades.

According to the Israeli Human Rights activists, the development of Jewish settlements in the Ramallah area, such as [[Beit El]] and [[Psagot]], prevented the expansion of the city and cut it off from the surrounding Arab villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Yehezkel |last1=Lein |first2=Eyal |last2=Weizman |url=http://www.brightonpalestinecampaign.org/pdfs/Articles/Land%20Grab.pdf |title=LAND GRAB: Israel's Settlement Policy in the West Bank |website=Brightonpalestinecampaign.org |publisher=[[B'Tselem]] |date=May 2002 |access-date=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As resistance increased, Ramallah residents who were members of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] were jailed or deported to neighboring countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE15/059/1999/en|title=ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES: Demolition and dispossession: the destruction of Palestinian homes |docket=MDE 15/59/99 |date=8 December 1999|access-date=2 October 2018|first=Anthony |last=Coon|work=Amnesty International}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1987, the popular uprising known as the [[First Intifada|Intifada]] erupted, protesting against the continued [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank|Israeli occupation]].

====First Intifada====
Ramallah residents were among the early joiners of the First Intifada. The Intifada Unified Leadership, an umbrella organization of various Palestinian factions, distributed weekly bulletins on the streets of Ramallah with a schedule of the daily protests, strikes and action against Israeli patrols in the city. At the demonstrations, tires were burned in the street, and the crowds threw stones and [[Molotov cocktail]]s. The [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. Schools in Ramallah were forcibly shut down, and opened gradually for a few hours a day.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} The Israelis conducted house arrests, imposing curfews that restricted travel and exports in what Palestinians regarded as collective punishment. In response to the closure of schools, residents organized home schooling sessions to help students make up missed material; this became one of the few symbols of civil disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmcc.org/research/reports/educate.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210223319/http://www.jmcc.org/research/reports/educate.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 10, 2007|title=JMCC / Research|date=February 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Intifada leadership organized &quot;tree plantings&quot; and resorted to the tactics used in pre-1948 Palestine, such as ordering general strikes in which no commercial businesses were allowed to open and no cars were allowed on the streets.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In 1991, the Palestinian delegation to the [[Madrid Conference of 1991|Madrid International Peace Conference]] included many notables from Ramallah. As the Intifada wound down and the peace process moved forward, normal life in Ramallah resumed. On September 13, 1993 Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and Palestinian Leader [[Yasser Arafat]] shook hands at a meeting at the [[White House]]. Schoolchildren in Ramallah handed out olive branches to Israeli soldiers patrolling the streets. In December 1995, in keeping with the [[Oslo Accords]], the Israeli army abandoned the [[Mukataa]] and withdrew to the city outskirts. The newly established [[Palestinian Authority]] assumed civilian and security responsibility for the city, which was designated &quot;Area A&quot; under the accords.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Palestinian Authority rule===

====1990s====
The years between 1993 and 2000 (known locally as the &quot;Oslo Years&quot;) brought relative prosperity to Ramallah. Ramallah and its immediate environs were classified as [[West Bank Areas in the Oslo II Accord|Area A]] in the [[Oslo II Accord|Oslo Accords]], under full civil and security control of the [[Palestinian Authority]] (PA) administration in September 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://israelipalestinian.procon.org/view.background-resource.php?resourceID=000921 1995 ''Oslo Interim Agreement'']. Text of the Accord&lt;/ref&gt; Many expatriates returned to establish businesses there, and the atmosphere was one of optimism. In 2000, unemployment began to rise and the economy of Ramallah declined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/dps/dps2002/dp2002-100.pdf Wider.unu.edu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102005327/http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/dps/dps2002/dp2002-100.pdf |date=January 2, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/s/said-end.html|title=The End of the Peace Process|work=The New York Times|date=2000|last=Said|first=Edward|author-link=Edward Said|access-date=October 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Israel Defense Forces]] remained in control of the territories and its government did not restore the freedom of movement enjoyed by Ramallah residents prior to the first Intifada. Travel to [[Jerusalem]] required special permits. The number and size of [[Israeli settlement]]s around Ramallah increased dramatically. A network of bypass roads for use of Israeli citizens only was built around Ramallah, and Israel expropriated land for settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ariga.com/5759/law001.htm|title=ariga.com|website=www.ariga.com|access-date=October 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/docs/50/plenary/a50-262.htm |title=PERMANENT SOVEREIGNTY OVER NATIONAL RESOURCES IN THE OCCUPIED PALESTINIAN AND OTHER ARAB TERRITORIES |publisher=United Nations |date=3 July 1995 |access-date=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many official documents previously handled by the Israeli Civil Administration were now handled by the Palestinian Authority but still required Israeli approval. A Palestinian passport issued to Ramallah residents was not valid unless the serial number was registered with the Israeli authorities, who controlled border crossings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.badil.org/e-library/Resident_PA.htm Badil.org] Badil.org {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111001943/http://www.badil.org/e-library/Resident_PA.htm |date=January 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of the [[Camp David 2000 Summit|Camp David summit]] in July 2000 led to the outbreak of the [[Second Intifada]] (al-Aqsa Intifada) in September 2000.

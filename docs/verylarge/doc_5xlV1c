{{Technical|date=September 2010}}

'''Pink noise''' or '''{{frac|1|f}} noise''' is a [[signal (information theory)|signal]] or process with a [[frequency spectrum]] such that the [[power spectral density]] (power per frequency interval) is [[inversely proportional]] to the [[frequency]] of the signal. In pink noise, each [[Octave (electronics)|octave]] interval (halving or doubling in frequency) carries an equal amount of noise energy. 

Pink noise is one of the most common signals in biological systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Szendro |first1=P |title=Pink-Noise Behaviour of Biosystems |journal=European Biophysics Journal |date=2001 |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=227–231 |doi=10.1007/s002490100143 |pmid=11508842 |s2cid=24505215 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1081/JBC-100104145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the scientific literature the term 1/f noise is sometimes used loosely to refer to any noise with a power spectral density of the form

:&lt;math&gt;S(f) \propto \frac{1}{f^\alpha},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f'' is frequency, and 0 &lt; α &lt; 2, with exponent α usually close to 1. The canonical case with α = 1 is called pink noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Baxandall |first=P.

The distinction between the noises with α near 1 and those with a broad range of α approximately corresponds to a much more basic distinction. The former (narrow sense) generally come from [[condensed matter physics|condensed-matter]] systems in [[quasi-equilibrium]], as discussed below.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kogan-1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter (broader sense) generally correspond to a wide range of [[non-equilibrium]] driven [[dynamical system]]s.

Pink noise sources include ''[[flicker noise]]'' in electronic devices. In their study of [[fractional Brownian motion]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mandelbrot1968&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

== Description ==
[[File:Pink noise spectrum.svg|thumb|right|Spectrum of a pink noise approximation on a log-log plot. Power density falls off at 10 dB/decade of frequency.]]
[[File:Noise.jpg|thumb|Relative intensity of pink noise (left) and [[white noise]] (right) on an [[fast Fourier transform|FFT]] [[spectrogram]] with the vertical axis being linear frequency.]]

In pink noise, there is equal energy in all [[octave]]s (or similar log bundles) of frequency. In terms of power at a constant bandwidth, pink noise falls off at 3 [[decibel|dB]] per octave. At high enough frequencies pink noise is never dominant. ([[White noise]] has equal energy per frequency interval.)

The [[human auditory system]], which processes frequencies in a roughly logarithmic fashion approximated by the [[Bark scale]], does not perceive different frequencies with equal sensitivity; signals around 1–4&amp;nbsp;kHz sound [[loudness|loudest]] for a given intensity. However, humans still differentiate between white noise and pink noise with ease.

[[Graphic equalizer]]s also divide signals into bands logarithmically and report power by octaves; audio engineers put pink noise through a system to test whether it has a flat frequency response in the spectrum of interest. Systems that do not have a flat response can be equalized by creating an inverse filter using a graphic equalizer. Because pink noise has a tendency to occur in natural physical systems, it is often useful in audio production. Pink noise can be processed, filtered, and/or effects can be added to produce desired sounds. Pink-noise generators are commercially available.

One parameter of noise, the peak versus average energy contents, or [[crest factor]], is important for testing purposes, such as for [[audio power amplifier]] and [[loudspeaker]] capabilities because the signal power is a direct function of the crest factor. Various crest factors of pink noise can be used in simulations of various levels of [[dynamic range compression]] in music signals. On some digital pink-noise generators the crest factor can be specified.

== Generalization to more than one dimension ==
The power spectrum of pink noise is {{sfrac|1|''f''}} only for one-dimensional signals. For two-dimensional signals (e.g., images) the power spectrum is reciprocal to ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt; In general, in an ''n''-dimensional system, the power spectrum is reciprocal to ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. For higher-dimensional signals it is still true (by definition) that each octave carries an equal amount of noise power. The frequency spectrum of two-dimensional signals, for instance, is also two-dimensional, and the area of the power spectrum covered by succeeding octaves is four times as large.

== Occurrence ==
In the past quarter century, pink noise has been discovered in the [[statistical fluctuations]] of an extraordinarily diverse number of physical and biological systems (Press, 1978;&lt;ref name=&quot;Press-1978&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

General 1/''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;α&lt;/sup&gt; noises occur in many physical, biological and economic systems, and some researchers describe them as being ubiquitous.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bak-1987&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

In biological systems, they are present in, for example, [[cardiac cycle|heart beat]] rhythms, neural activity, and the statistics of [[DNA sequence]]s, as a generalized pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson, Brian D. (1995). &quot;A trans-human source of music?&quot; in (P. Pylkkänen and P. Pylkkö, eds.) ''New Directions in Cognitive Science'', Finnish Artificial Intelligence Society, Helsinki; pp. 280–285.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[financial system]]s, they are often referred to as a ''long-term memory effect''{{specify|date=January 2013}}.

An accessible introduction to the significance of pink noise is one given by [[Martin Gardner]] (1978) in his ''Scientific American'' column &quot;Mathematical Games&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardner-1978&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

      }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this column, Gardner asked for the sense in which music imitates nature. Sounds in nature are not musical in that they tend to be either too repetitive (bird song, insect noises) or too chaotic (ocean surf, wind in trees, and so forth). The answer to this question was given in a statistical sense by Voss and Clarke (1975, 1978), who showed that pitch and loudness fluctuations in speech and music are pink noises.&lt;ref name=&quot;Voss-1975&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Pink noise has also been found to be endemic in human response. Gilden et al. (1995) found extremely pure examples of this noise in the time series formed upon iterated production of temporal and spatial intervals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilden-1995&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

===Electronic devices===
{{Main|Flicker noise}}

The principal sources of pink noise in electronic devices are almost invariably the slow fluctuations of properties of the condensed-matter materials of the devices. In many cases the specific sources of the fluctuations are known. These include fluctuating configurations of defects in metals, fluctuating occupancies of traps in semiconductors, and fluctuating domain structures in magnetic materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kogan-1996&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weissman-1988&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the frequency range of the typical noise experiment (e.g., 1&amp;nbsp;Hz – 1&amp;nbsp;kHz) is low compared with typical microscopic &quot;attempt frequencies&quot; (e.g., 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; Hz), the exponential factors in the [[Arrhenius equation]] for the rates are large. Relatively small spreads in the activation energies appearing in these exponents then result in large spreads of characteristic rates. In the simplest toy case, a flat distribution of activation energies gives exactly a pink spectrum, because &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{d}{df}\ln f = \frac{1}{f}.&lt;/math&gt;

There is no known lower bound to background pink noise in electronics. Measurements made down to 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; Hz (taking several weeks) have not shown a ceasing of pink-noise behaviour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kleinpenning-1988&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

A pioneering researcher in this field was [[Aldert van der Ziel]].&lt;ref&gt;Aldert van der Ziel, (1954), ''Noise'', Prentice–Hall&lt;/ref&gt;

A pink-noise source is sometimes deliberately included on [[analog synthesizer]]s (although a white-noise source is more common), both as a useful audio sound source for further processing and as a source of random control voltages for controlling other parts of the synthesizer. {{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

1/''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;α&lt;/sup&gt; noises with α near 1 are a factor in [[gravitational-wave astronomy]]. The noise curve at very low frequencies affect [[pulsar timing array]]s, the [[European Pulsar Timing Array]] (EPTA) and the future [[International Pulsar Timing Array]] (IPTA); at low frequencies are space-borne detectors, the formerly proposed [[Laser Interferometer Space Antenna]] (LISA) and the currently proposed evolved Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (eLISA), and at high frequencies are ground-based detectors, the initial [[LIGO|Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory]] (LIGO) and its advanced configuration (aLIGO). The characteristic strain of potential astrophysical sources are also shown. To be detectable the characteristic strain of a signal must be above the noise curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gravitational Wave Detectors and Sources|url=http://rhcole.com/apps/GWplotter/|accessdate=17 April 2014|author=Moore, Christopher|author2=Cole, Robert |author3=Berry, Christopher |date=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate change===
Pink noise on timescales of decades has been found in climate proxy data, which may indicate amplification and coupling of processes in the [[climate system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yale.edu/2018/09/04/think-pink-better-view-climate-change|title=Think pink for a better view of climate change|work=YaleNews|access-date=5 September 2018|author=Jim Shelton|date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diffusion processes ===
Many time-dependent stochastic processes are known to exhibit 1/''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;α&lt;/sup&gt; noises with α between 0 and 2. In particular [[Brownian motion]] has a [[Spectral density|power spectral density]] that equals 4''D''/''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of noise and vibration analysis for engineers|last=Norton, M.

== Origin ==
There are many theories of the origin of pink noise. Some theories attempt to be universal, while others are applicable to only a certain type of material, such as [[semiconductor]]s. Universal theories of pink noise remain a matter of current research interest.

A hypothesis (referred to as the Tweedie hypothesis) has been proposed to explain the genesis of pink noise on the basis of a mathematical convergence theorem related to the [[central limit theorem]] of statistics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kendal2011b&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kendal WS, Jørgensen BR | year = 2011 | title = Tweedie convergence: a mathematical basis for Taylor's power law, 1/''f'' noise and [[multifractality]]. | url = | journal = Phys.

These distributions are characterized by a variance to mean [[power law]], that have been variously identified in the ecological literature as [[Taylor's law]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor1961&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Taylor LR | year = 1961 | title = Aggregation, variance and the mean | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 189 | issue = 4766| pages = 732–735 | doi = 10.1038/189732a0 | bibcode = 1961Natur.189..732T | s2cid = 4263093 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the physics literature as ''fluctuation scaling''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eisler2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eisler Z, Bartos I, Kertesz  | year = 2008 | title = Fluctuation scaling in complex systems: Taylor's law and beyond | url = | journal = Adv Phys | volume = 57 | issue = 1| pages = 89–142 | doi = 10.1080/00018730801893043 | bibcode = 2008AdPhy..57...89E | arxiv = 0708.2053 | s2cid = 119608542 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When this variance to mean power law is demonstrated by the method of expanding enumerative bins this implies the presence of pink noise, and vice versa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kendal2011b&quot; /&gt; Both of these effects can be shown to be the consequence of [[convergence in distribution|mathematical convergence]] such as how certain kinds of data will converge towards the [[normal distribution]] under the [[central limit theorem]]. This hypothesis also provides for an alternative paradigm to explain [[power law]] manifestations that have been attributed to [[self-organized criticality]].&lt;ref name=Kendal2015&gt;

There are various mathematical models to create pink noise. Although [[self-organised criticality]] has been able to reproduce pink noise in [[sandpile]] models, these do not have a [[Gaussian distribution]] or other expected statistical qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |title=1/f noise: a pedagogical review |eprint=physics/0204033 |date=2002-04-12 |first=Edoardo |last=Milotti}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Statistical signatures of self-organization|journal = Physical Review A|date = 1992-10-01|pages = R4475–R4478|volume = 46|issue = 8|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.46.R4475|first1 = Kevin P.|last1 = O’Brien|first2 = M.

'''35&amp;nbsp;mm film''' is a [[film gauge]] used in [[filmmaking]], and the film standard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belton&quot; /&gt; In [[motion pictures]] that record on film, 35&amp;nbsp;mm is the most commonly used gauge. The name of the gauge is not a direct measurement, and refers to the nominal width of the [[35 mm format]] [[photographic film]], which consists of strips {{convert|1.377|+/-|0.001|in|mm}} wide. The standard [[negative pulldown|image exposure length]] on 35&amp;nbsp;mm for movies (&quot;single-frame&quot; format) is four [[film perforations|perforations]] per [[Film frame|frame]] along both edges, which results in 16 frames per foot of film.

A variety of largely proprietary gauges were devised for the numerous camera and projection systems being developed independently in the late 19th century and early 20th century, as well as a variety of film feeding systems. This resulted in cameras, projectors, and other equipment having to be calibrated to each gauge. The 35&amp;nbsp;mm width, originally specified as {{frac|1|3|8}} inches, was introduced around 1890 by [[William Kennedy Dickson]] and [[Thomas Edison]], using [[120 film]] stock supplied by [[George Eastman]]. Film 35&amp;nbsp;mm wide with four perforations per frame became accepted as the international standard gauge in 1909, and remained by far the dominant film gauge for image origination and projection until the advent of digital photography and cinematography.

The gauge has been versatile in application. It has been modified to include sound, redesigned to create a safer [[film base]], formulated to capture color, has accommodated a bevy of widescreen formats, and has incorporated digital sound data into nearly all of its non-frame areas. [[Eastman Kodak]], [[Fujifilm]] and [[Agfa-Gevaert]] are some companies that offered 35&amp;nbsp;mm films. Today, Kodak is the last remaining manufacturer of motion picture film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/kodak-inks-deals-studios-extend-770300|title=Kodak Inks Deals With Studios to Extend Film's Life|website=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ubiquity of 35&amp;nbsp;mm [[movie projector]]s in commercial [[movie theater]]s made 35&amp;nbsp;mm the only motion picture format that could be played in almost any cinema in the world, until [[Digital cinema|digital projection]] largely superseded it in the 21st century.

[[File:Eastman giving Edison the first roll of movie film 01.png|thumb|left|Eastman (L) giving Edison the first roll of movie film, which was 35 mm]]
In 1880, [[George Eastman]] began to manufacture [[gelatin]] dry photographic plates in [[Rochester, New York]]. Along with W. H. Walker, Eastman invented a holder for a roll of picture-carrying gelatin layer-coated paper. [[Hannibal Goodwin]] then invented a [[nitrocellulose]] [[film base]] in 1887, the first transparent, flexible film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url = https://www.wired.com/2011/05/0502celuloid-photographic-film/| date = 2 May 2011 | access-date = 29 August 2017 | first = Randy | last = Alfred | magazine = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | title = May 2, 1887: Celluloid-Film Patent Ignites Long Legal Battle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/eastman/timeline/index_2.html |title=The Wizard of Photography: The Story of George Eastman and How He Transformed Photography |work=Timeline PBS American Experience Online |access-date=July 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eastman also produced these components, and his was the first major company to mass-produce such film when, in 1889, Eastman realized that the dry-gelatino-bromide [[emulsion]] could be coated onto this clear base, eliminating the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mees |first=C.

With the advent of flexible film, [[Thomas Edison]] quickly set out on his invention, the [[Kinetoscope]], which was first shown at the [[Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences]] on May 9, 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=David|url=https://archive.org/details/frompeepshowtopa0000robi|title=From peep show to palace: the birth of American film|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-231-10338-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/frompeepshowtopa0000robi/page/39 39]|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kinetoscope was a film loop system intended for one-person viewing.&lt;ref name=&quot;hone&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_4VAAAACAAJ|title=Eastman Professional Motion Picture Films|date=June 1, 1983|publisher=Eastman Kodak Co|isbn=978-0-87985-477-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edison, along with assistant [[William Kennedy Dickson]], followed that up with the [[Kinetoscope#Kinetophone|Kinetophone]], which combined the Kinetoscope with Edison's cylinder [[phonograph]].

For a time, it had been generally assumed that Dickson was following cinematography formats established by Eastman in producing the film, but Eastman had produced film in sheets that were then cut to order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belton&quot; /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;652–653&lt;/sup&gt; Dickson used the film supplied for [[Eastman Kodak]] cameras in 1889, a transparent [[70 mm film|70 mm]] celluloid film, in his development of a more suitable [[film stock]], and &quot;simply slit this film in half&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;Belton&quot; /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;653–654&lt;/sup&gt; it was initially developed for the Kinetoscope, a one-person viewer, not to be projected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belton&quot; /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;658&lt;/sup&gt; The image was still of high quality, even when magnified, and was more economical than 70 mm film (and more economical than any other gauge, as cutting the 70 mm to size would have created waste).&lt;ref name=&quot;Belton&quot; /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;654&lt;/sup&gt; 35 mm was immediately accepted as standard by the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]], and became the main film used in the UK because it was the stock sold to these filmmakers by the Blair company.&lt;ref name=Belton&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7228070|title=The Origins of 35mm Film as a Standard|last=Belton|first=John|journal= Journal of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers|volume=99|issue=8|date=August 1990|pages=652–661|doi=10.5594/J02613|issn=0036-1682}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;653&lt;/sup&gt;

Edison claimed exclusive [[patent]] rights to the design of 35&amp;nbsp;mm motion picture film{{refn|group=fn|{{US patent|0589168}}}}, with four sprocket holes (perforations) per frame, forcing his only major filmmaking competitor, [[American Mutoscope &amp; Biograph]], to use a 68&amp;nbsp;mm film that used friction feed, not sprocket holes, to move the film through the camera. A court judgment in March 1902 invalidated Edison's claim, allowing any producer or distributor to use the Edison 35&amp;nbsp;mm film design without license. Filmmakers were already doing so in Britain and Europe, where Edison did not file patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Musser |first=Charles |title=The Emergence of Cinema: The American Screen to 1907 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IEUMWToGOtUC |year=1994 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=978-0-520-08533-6 |pages=303–313}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, film stock was usually supplied unperforated and punched by the filmmaker to their standards with perforation equipment. A variation developed by the Lumière brothers used a single circular perforation on each side of the frame towards the middle of the horizontal axis.&lt;ref name=&quot;lumiere&quot;&gt;Lobban, Grant. &quot;Film Gauges and Soundtracks&quot;, BKSTS wall chart (sample frame provided).

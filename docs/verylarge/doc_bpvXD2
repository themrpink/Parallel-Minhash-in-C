[[File:Kepler-solar-system-2.png|thumb|upright|Inner section of Kepler's [[Platonic solid]] model of planetary spacing in the [[Solar System]] from ''[[Mysterium Cosmographicum]]'' (1596)]]

'''Sacred geometry''' ascribes symbolic and [[Sacred|sacred meanings]] to certain geometric shapes and certain geometric [[Proportion (architecture)|proportions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.geometry/unit5/unit5.html dartmouth.edu: Paul Calter, ''Polygons, Tilings, &amp; Sacred Geometry'']&lt;/ref&gt; It is associated with the belief that a god is the geometer of the world. The geometry used in the design and construction of [[sacred architecture|religious structures]] such as [[Church (building)|churches]], [[temple]]s, [[mosque]]s, religious [[monuments]], [[altar]]s, and [[church tabernacle|tabernacles]] has sometimes been considered sacred. The concept applies also to sacred spaces such as [[temenos|temenoi]], [[sacred grove]]s, [[village green]]s, [[Pagoda|pagodas]] and [[holy well]]s, and the creation of [[sacred art|religious art]].

==As worldview and cosmology==
{{further|Mathematics and art}}

The belief that a god created the universe according to a geometric plan has ancient origins. [[Plutarch]] attributed the belief to [[Plato]], writing that &quot;Plato said god geometrizes continually&quot; (''Convivialium disputationum'', liber 8,2). In modern times, the mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] adapted this quote, saying &quot;God arithmetizes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cathérine Goldstein, Norbert Schappacher, Joachim Schwermer, ''The shaping of arithmetic'',  [https://books.google.com/books?id=IUFTcOsMTysC&amp;pg=PA235 p. 235].&lt;/ref&gt;

As late as [[Johannes Kepler]] (1571–1630), a belief in the geometric underpinnings of the cosmos persisted among some scientists.&lt;ref name=Calter&gt;{{cite web |last1=Calter |first1=Paul |title=Celestial Themes in Art &amp; Architecture |url=https://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.geometry/unit10/unit10.html |publisher=[[Dartmouth College]] |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural forms==
{{further|Patterns in nature}}

[[File:NautilusCutawayLogarithmicSpiral.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Nautilus]]'' shell's [[logarithm]]ic growth spiral]]

According to [[Stephen Skinner (author)|Stephen Skinner]], the study of sacred geometry has its roots in the study of nature, and the [[Fibonacci number|mathematical principles]] at work therein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Skinner |first=Stephen |title=Sacred Geometry: Deciphering the Code |publisher=Sterling |date=2009 |isbn=978-1-4027-6582-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[patterns in nature|forms observed in nature]] can be related to geometry; for example, the [[chambered nautilus]] grows at a constant rate and so its shell forms a [[logarithmic spiral]] to accommodate that growth without changing shape. Also, [[honeybee]]s construct hexagonal cells to hold their honey.  These and other correspondences are sometimes interpreted in terms of sacred geometry and considered to be further proof of the natural significance of geometric forms.

==Art and architecture==
{{further|Mathematics and architecture|Mathematics and art|Islamic geometric patterns}}

Geometric ratios, and geometric figures were often employed in the designs of ancient [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|Egyptian]], ancient Indian, [[Architecture of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Roman architecture]]. Medieval European cathedrals also incorporated symbolic geometry. Indian and Himalayan spiritual communities often constructed temples and [[fortification]]s on design plans of [[mandala]] and [[yantra]].

Many of the sacred geometry principles of the human body and of ancient architecture were compiled into the [[Vitruvian Man]] drawing by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. The latter drawing was itself based on the much older writings of the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]].

===In Islam===

The geometric designs in Islamic art are often built on combinations of repeated squares and circles, which may be overlapped and interlaced, as can arabesques (with which they are often combined), to form intricate and complex patterns, including a wide variety of tessellations. These may constitute the entire decoration, may form a framework for floral or calligraphic embellishments, or may retreat into the background around other motifs. The complexity and variety of patterns used evolved from simple stars and lozenges in the ninth century, through a variety of 6- to 13-point patterns by the 13th century, and finally to include also 14- and 16-point stars in the sixteenth century.

Geometric patterns occur in a variety of forms in Islamic art and architecture including kilim carpets, Persian girih and Moroccan/Algerian zellige tilework, muqarnas decorative vaulting, jali pierced stone screens, ceramics, leather, stained glass, woodwork, and metalwork.

[[Islamic geometric patterns]] are used in the Quran, Mosques and even in the calligraphies.

===In Hinduism===

[[File:Mandala.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Hindu]] [[Mandala|Maṇḍala]]]]

The [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agamas]] are a collection of Sanskrit,&lt;ref name=Grimes&gt;Grimes, John A. (1996). ''A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English''. State University of New York Press. {{ISBN|9780791430682}}. LCCN 96012383. [https://books.google.com/books?id=eP5p0ev3nJEC]&lt;/ref&gt; Tamil, and [[Grantha script|Grantha]]&lt;ref name=NagalingamCh1&gt;Nagalingam, Pathmarajah (2009). ''The Religion of the Agamas''. Siddhanta Publications. [http://www.siddha.com.my/forum/religionoftheagamas/chapter1.html]&lt;/ref&gt; scriptures chiefly constituting the methods of temple construction and creation of idols, worship means of deities, philosophical doctrines, meditative practices, attainment of sixfold desires, and four kinds of yoga.&lt;ref name=Grimes/&gt;

Elaborate rules are laid out in the Agamas for Shilpa (the art of [[sculpture]]) describing the quality requirements of such matters as the places where temples are to be built, the kinds of image to be installed, the materials from which they are to be made, their dimensions, proportions, air circulation, and lighting in the temple complex. The [[Manasara]] and Silpasara are works that deal with these rules. The rituals of daily worship at the temple also follow rules laid out in the Agamas.

=== In Christianity ===
The construction of Medieval European cathedrals was often based on geometries intended to make the viewer see the world through mathematics, and through this understanding, gain a better understanding of the divine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Petersen|first=Toni|chapter=A(rt and) A(rchitecture) T(hesaurus)|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=10.1093/gao/9781884446054.article.t000037|title=Oxford Art Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; These churches frequently featured a [[Latin Cross]] floor-plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=CUMMINGS|first=L.A.|chapter=A RECURRING GEOMETRICAL PATTERN IN THE EARLY RENAISSANCE IMAGINATION|date=1986|pages=981–997|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080339863|doi=10.1016/b978-0-08-033986-3.50067-7|title=Symmetry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the Renaissance in Europe, views shifted to favor simple and regular geometries. The circle in particular became a central and symbolic shape for the base of buildings, as it represented the perfection of nature and the centrality of man's place in the universe.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The use of the circle and other simple and symmetrical geometric shapes was solidified as a staple of [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] [[sacred architecture]] in [[Leon Battista Alberti]]'s architectural treatise, which described the ideal church in terms of spiritual geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Architectural principles in the age of humanism.|last=Rudolf.|first=Wittkower|date=1998|publisher=Academy Editions|isbn=978-0471977636|oclc=981109542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unanchored geometry==
[[Stephen Skinner (author)|Stephen Skinner]] discusses the tendency of some writers to place a geometric diagram over virtually any image of a natural object or human created structure, find some lines intersecting the image and declare it based on sacred geometry. If the geometric diagram does not intersect major physical points in the image, the result is what Skinner calls &quot;unanchored geometry&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CG0EeHGl_dQC&amp;pg=PA91 Stephen Skinner, ''Sacred geometry: deciphering the code'', p91]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George VI''' (Albert Frederick Arthur George; 14 December 1895&amp;nbsp;– 6 February 1952) was [[King of the United Kingdom]] and the [[Dominion]]s of the [[British Commonwealth]] from 11 December 1936 until his death in 1952. He was also [[Emperor of India]] from 1936 until 1947, when the [[British Raj]] was dissolved.

Known as &quot;Bertie&quot; among his family and close friends, George VI was born in the reign of his great-grandmother [[Queen Victoria]] and was named after his great-grandfather [[Albert, Prince Consort]]. As the second son of [[King George V]], he was not expected to inherit the throne and spent his early life in the shadow of his elder brother, [[Edward VIII|Edward]]. He attended naval college as a teenager and served in the [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Air Force]] during the [[First World War]]. In 1920, he was made [[Duke of York]]. He married [[Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]] in 1923, and they had two daughters, [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]]. In the mid-1920s, he had speech therapy for a [[stammer]], which he learned to manage to some degree. George's elder brother ascended the throne as Edward VIII after their father died in 1936. Later that year, Edward [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated]] to marry the American socialite [[Wallis Simpson]], and George became the third monarch of the [[House of Windsor]].

In September 1939, the [[British Empire]] and Commonwealth—[[Irish neutrality during World War II|except Ireland]]—declared [[World War II|war]] on [[Nazi Germany]]. War with the [[Kingdom of Italy]] and the [[Empire of Japan]] followed in 1940 and 1941, respectively. George was seen as sharing the hardships of the common people and his popularity soared. [[Buckingham Palace]] was bombed during [[the Blitz]] while the King and Queen were there, and his younger brother, [[Prince George, Duke of Kent|the Duke of Kent]], was killed on active service. George became known as a symbol of British determination to win the war. [[Allies of World War II|Britain and its allies]] were victorious in 1945, but the British Empire declined. Ireland had [[Adoption of the Constitution of Ireland|largely broken away]], followed by [[Indian Independence Act 1947|independence of India and Pakistan]] in 1947. George relinquished the title of Emperor of India in June 1948 and instead adopted the new title of [[Head of the Commonwealth]]. He was beset by smoking-related health problems in the later years of his reign and died of [[coronary thrombosis]] in 1952. He was succeeded by his daughter, [[Elizabeth II]].

==Early life==
[[File:Edward VII UK and successors.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|Four kings: [[Edward VII]] (far right); his son George, Prince of Wales, later [[George V]] (far left); and grandsons Edward, later [[Edward VIII]] (rear); and Albert, later George VI (foreground), c. 1908]]

The future George VI was born at [[York Cottage]], on the [[Sandringham House|Sandringham Estate]] in Norfolk, during the reign of his great-grandmother [[Queen Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes James, p. 90; Weir, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Prince George, Duke of York (later [[King George V]]), the second and eldest surviving son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later [[King Edward VII]] and [[Queen Alexandra]]). His mother, the Duchess of York (later [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]), was the eldest child and only daughter of [[Francis, Duke of Teck]], and [[Mary Adelaide, Duchess of Teck]].&lt;ref&gt;Weir, pp. 322–323, 329&lt;/ref&gt; His birthday, 14 December 1895, was the 34th anniversary of the death of his great-grandfather, [[Albert, Prince Consort]].&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 3; Rhodes James, p. 90; Townsend, p. 15; Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; Uncertain of how the Prince Consort's widow, Queen Victoria, would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been &quot;rather distressed&quot;. Two days later, he wrote again: &quot;I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name ''Albert'' to her.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 4–5; Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt;

The Queen was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: &quot;I am all impatience to see the ''new'' one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, he was [[baptised]] &quot;Albert Frederick Arthur George&quot; at [[St Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham]], three months later.{{efn|His godparents were: [[Queen Victoria]] (his great-grandmother, for whom his grandmother the [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]] stood proxy); the [[Frederick William, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg|Grand Duke]] and [[Princess Augusta of Cambridge|Grand Duchess]] of Mecklenburg (his maternal great-aunt and great-uncle, for whom his grandfather the [[Francis, Duke of Teck|Duke of Teck]] and his paternal aunt [[Maud of Wales|Princess Maud of Wales]] stood proxy); [[Empress Frederick]] (his paternal great-aunt, for whom his paternal aunt [[Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom|Princess Victoria of Wales]] stood proxy); the [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|Crown Prince of Denmark]] (his great-uncle, for whom his grandfather the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] stood proxy); the [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Duke of Connaught]] (his great-uncle); the [[Louise, Princess Royal and Duchess of Fife|Duchess of Fife]] (his paternal aunt); and [[Adolphus Cambridge, 1st Marquess of Cambridge|Prince Adolphus of Teck]] (his maternal uncle).&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', Tuesday 18 February 1896, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;}} Within the family, he was known informally as &quot;Bertie&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 6; Rhodes James, p. 90; Townsend, p. 15; Windsor, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The Duchess of Teck did not like the first name her grandson had been given, and she wrote prophetically that she hoped the last name &quot;may supplant the less favoured one&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Albert was fourth in line to the throne at birth, after his grandfather, father and elder brother, [[Edward VIII|Edward]].

He often suffered from ill health and was described as &quot;easily frightened and somewhat prone to tears&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were generally removed from their children's day-to-day upbringing, as was the norm in aristocratic families of that era. He had a [[stammer]] that lasted for many years. Although naturally [[left-handed]], he was forced to write with his right hand, as was common practice at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Howard I. |last=Kushner |title=Retraining the King's left hand |journal=The Lancet |volume=377 |issue=9782 |year=2011 |pages=1998–1999 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60854-4|pmid=21671515 |s2cid=35750495 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered from chronic stomach problems as well as [[knock knees]], for which he was forced to wear painful corrective splints.&lt;ref name=&quot;matthew&quot;&gt;{{citation|first=H. C. G.|last=Matthew|author-link=Colin Matthew|title=George VI (1895–1952)|journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queen Victoria died on 22 January 1901, and the Prince of Wales succeeded her as King Edward VII. Prince Albert moved up to third in line to the throne, after his father and elder brother.

==Military career and education==
From 1909, Albert attended the [[Royal Naval College, Osborne]], as a naval [[cadet]]. In 1911 he came bottom of the class in the final examination, but despite this he progressed to the [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Royal Naval College, Dartmouth]].&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, pp. 41–45; Judd, pp. 21–24; Rhodes James, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; When his grandfather, Edward VII, died in 1910, his father became King George V. Edward became Prince of Wales, with Albert second in line to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert spent the first six months of 1913 on the training ship {{HMS|Cumberland|1902|6}} in the [[West Indies]] and on the east coast of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; He was rated as a [[midshipman]] aboard {{HMS|Collingwood|1908|6}} on 15 September 1913. He spent three months in the Mediterranean, but never overcame his seasickness.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks after the outbreak of World War I he was medically evacuated from the ship to Aberdeen, where his appendix was removed by [[Sir John Marnoch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Royal Connections |url=http://www.med-chi.co.uk/heritage/history/the-archive/royal-connections.html#nav |website=Aberdeen Medico-Chirugical Society |access-date=16 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[mentioned in despatches]] for his actions as a turret officer aboard ''Collingwood'' in the [[Battle of Jutland]] (31 May – 1 June 1916), the great naval battle of the war. He did not see further combat, largely because of ill health caused by a [[duodenal ulcer]], for which he had an operation in November 1917.&lt;ref name=Bradford55&gt;Bradford, pp. 55–76&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Prince Albert in RAF uniform.png|thumb|upright|Albert at an RAF dinner in 1919]]
In February 1918 he was appointed Officer in Charge of Boys at the [[Royal Naval Air Service]]'s training establishment at [[RAF Cranwell|Cranwell]]. With the establishment of the [[Royal Air Force]] Albert transferred from the Royal Navy to the Royal Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; He served as Officer Commanding Number 4 Squadron of the Boys' Wing at Cranwell until August 1918,&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; before reporting to the RAF's Cadet School at [[St Leonards-on-Sea]]. He completed a fortnight's training and took command of a squadron on the Cadet Wing.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler-Bennett, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first member of the British royal family to be certified as a fully qualified pilot.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 45; Rhodes James, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

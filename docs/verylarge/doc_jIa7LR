Sean Kinney said about the band's reunion: &quot;I never called Jerry; he never called me, and said, 'Hey, let's get the band back together,' you know? We had been taking every step extremely cautious and slow, and just doing whatever feels right: If it's genuine and we're doing it for genuine reasons and we're all okay with it then we take a little step. None of us is broke. Nobody needs to be a rock dork, and you know, stroke their ego. I mean, we don't really operate like that. So as long as it felt good and from the right place and it's about making music and carrying on….&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;From The Ashes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://drummagazine.com/sean-kinney-of-alice-in-chains-from-the-ashes/ |title=Sean Kinney Of Alice In Chains: From The Ashes |work=Drum Magazine|date=July 19, 2011|accessdate=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About the pressure being put on DuVall for replacing Staley as lead vocalist, Cantrell said, &quot;To put all that weight on Will's shoulders is unfair. We're just figuring out how we work as a team. Although the band has changed, we've lost Layne, we've added Will, and there was no master plan. Playing again in 2005 felt right, so we did the next thing and toured. We did it step by step. It's more than just making music, and it always has been. We've been friends a long time. We've been more of a family than most, and it had to be okay from here,&quot; Cantrell said pointing to his heart.&lt;ref name=&quot;Classic Rock 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2009-09-16/alice-in-chains-through-the-looking-glass |title=Alice In Chains: &quot;It hurts and you miss them, but you still have to live&quot; |work=Classic Rock|date=September 16, 2009|accessdate=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sean Kinney said about the new album and the fans' mixed reactions about the band moving on after Staley's death: &quot;Look, it's a big move to fucking stand up and move on. Some people, the music connected with them so strongly, their opinions, how they feel about it ... It's amazing that they have such a connection but they seem to act like it happened to them. This happened to us and Layne's family, not them. This is actually our lives. If we're okay with it, why can't you be? This happened to us, this didn't happen to you. But this album isn't about that, it's a bigger universal point. We're all going to fucking die, we're all going to lose somebody, and it fucking hurts. How do you move on? This record is us moving on, and hurting. That, to me, is a victory. I already feel like I've won.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Classic Rock 2009&quot;/&gt; &quot;Sometimes people ask us, 'Wouldn't Layne have been pissed off that we did this?' And I tell them it would have been the opposite: he would have been pissed off that it took us so long to do this. We're not doing this for money; there is no money in the music business anymore. Jerry and I funded the whole album, and we spent lots of our own money, because we believe in this. And one of the reasons I'm doing this is so more light is turned on to something where the light was turned off.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guitar World 2013&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/interview-jerry-cantrell-discusses-alice-chains-2009-comeback-black-gives-way-blue|title=Interview: Jerry Cantrell Discusses Alice in Chain's 2009 Comeback, 'Black Gives Way to Blue'|work=Guitar World|date=January 10, 2013|accessdate=July 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702094006/http://www.guitarworld.com/interview-jerry-cantrell-discusses-alice-chains-2009-comeback-black-gives-way-blue|archive-date=July 2, 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; And Cantrell added: &quot;We've toured around the world, we've lost some friends, we buried a dear friend, and somebody that you just can't fucking replace, and then we've chosen by circumstance to get together again.

The album was expected to be finished by summer of 2012 and released by the end of 2012 or beginning of 2013. While Alice in Chains were writing for the album in 2011, Cantrell underwent surgery on his right shoulder, which delayed recording the new material. In an interview published in May 2012, Cantrell explained, &quot;The thing that set me back is I had some bone spurs [and] cartilage issues in my shoulders. I had the same issue in the other shoulder about six years ago so I've had them both done now.

===2017–present: ''Rainier Fog''===
In January 2017, Mike Inez stated in an interview that the band had begun work on a new album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/alice-in-chains-is-working-on-follow-up-to-the-devil-put-dinosaurs-here |title=Alice in Chains Is Working On Follow-Up To 'The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here' |website=Blabbermouth |date=January 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017, it was reported that the band would return to Studio X (formerly Bad Animals Studios) in Seattle to record a new album later that month, for a tentative early 2018 release. The sessions were helmed by [[Nick Raskulinecz]], who produced the band's last two albums.&lt;ref name=&quot;2018 album&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/alice-in-chains-to-re-team-with-producer-nick-raskulinecz-for-new-album/|title=Alice in Chains To Re-Team With Producer Nick Raskulinecz For New Album|work=Blabbermouth |date=June 6, 2017 |accessdate=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studio X was the studio where Alice in Chains recorded its 1995 self-titled album.&lt;ref name=&quot;2018 album&quot;/&gt; According to Inez, the band was not signed to a label, having completed its previous two-record contract with the Universal Music Group. &quot;This [upcoming album], we're not sure where it's gonna land ... I mean, we financed ['Black Gives Way To Blue'] on our own too, so we're not too worried about that stuff. We've just gotta get it out to ... a significant label [with worldwide distribution].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;2018 album&quot;/&gt;

The band started recording their sixth studio album on June 12, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BVQa0o2jLye/ |title=William DuVall: Day One tracking |date=June 12, 2017 |access-date=April 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 11, 2018, producer Nick Raskulinecz announced via [[Instagram]] that the album was nearly finished and that there was only one more day left of recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/upcoming_releases/big_news_from_alice_in_chains_new_album_almost_wrapped_up.html |title=Big News From Alice in Chains: New Album Almost Wrapped Up! |date=February 8, 2018 |website=Ultimate Guitar |access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an interview with ''Guitar World'' published on April 11, 2018, Jerry Cantrell said that the album was recorded at four studios. After recording at Studio X in Seattle, the band went to [[Nashville]] to record vocals and lead guitars at Nick Raskulinecz's home studio. But Cantrell had to take an unexpected break from work for a couple of weeks after getting sick on a trip to [[Cabo San Lucas|Cabo]] for [[Sammy Hagar]]'s birthday. Cantrell had the band's engineer, Paul Figueroa, come in to his house and record a lot of his vocals and solos there. The band finished recording the album at the Henson Recording Studios in Los Angeles. Cantrell also said he expects the album to be released &quot;probably sometime this summer.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;summer 2018&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.guitarworld.com/artists/jerry-cantrell-offers-more-details-on-alice-in-chains-new-album |title=Jerry Cantrell Offers More Details on Alice in Chains' New Album |last=Bienstock |first=Richard |date=April 11, 2018 |website=Guitar World |access-date=April 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

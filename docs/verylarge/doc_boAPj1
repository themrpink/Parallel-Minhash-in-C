'''Melanin''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=melanin-pronunciation.ogg|ˈ|m|ɛ|l|ə|n|ɪ|n}}; from {{lang-el|μέλας}} ''melas'', &quot;black, dark&quot;) is a broad term for a group of natural [[pigment]]s found in most [[organism]]s. Melanin is produced through a multistage chemical process known as [[melanogenesis]], where the [[oxidation]] of the [[amino acid]] [[tyrosine]] is followed by [[polymerization]]. The melanin pigments are produced in a specialized group of cells known as [[melanocytes]]. 

There are three basic types of melanin: [[eumelanin]], [[pheomelanin]], and [[neuromelanin]]. The most common type is eumelanin, of which there are two types— brown eumelanin and black eumelanin. Pheomelanin is a [[cysteine]]-derivative that contains poly[[benzothiazine]] portions that are largely responsible for the color of [[red hair]], among other pigmentation. Neuromelanin is found in the [[brain]]. Research has been undertaken to investigate its efficacy in treating neurodegenerative disorders such as [[Parkinson's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Haining|first1=Robert L. |last2=Achat-Mendes|first2=Cindy |date=March 2017|title=Neuromelanin, one of the most overlooked molecules in modern medicine, is not a spectator|journal=Neural Regeneration Research |volume=12|issue=3|pages=372–375|doi=10.4103/1673-5374.202928 |pmc=5399705|pmid=28469642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the human skin, melanogenesis is initiated by exposure to [[UV radiation]], causing the skin to darken. Melanin is an effective absorbent of light; the pigment is able to dissipate over 99.9% of absorbed UV radiation.&lt;ref name=Meredith&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Meredith P, Riesz J |title=Radiative relaxation quantum yields for synthetic eumelanin |journal=Photochemistry and Photobiology |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=211–6 |year=2004  |pmid=15068035 |doi=10.1111/j.1751-1097.2004.tb00012.x |arxiv=cond-mat/0312277 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this property, melanin is thought to protect skin cells from [[indirect DNA damage|UVB radiation damage]], reducing the risk of folate depletion and dermal degradation, and it is considered that exposure to UV radiation is associated with increased risk of [[malignant melanoma]], a cancer of melanocytes (melanin cells). Studies have shown a lower incidence for skin cancer in individuals with more concentrated melanin, i.e. darker [[skin tone]]. However, the relationship between skin pigmentation and [[photoprotection]] is still uncertain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Electrodial Crocodile Style&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brenner M, Hearing VJ |title=The protective role of melanin against UV damage in human skin |journal=Photochemistry and Photobiology |volume=84 |issue=3 |pages=539–49 |year=2008 |pmid=18435612 |pmc=2671032 |doi=10.1111/j.1751-1097.2007.00226.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albinistic girl papua new guinea.jpg|thumb|[[Albinism]] occurs when melanocytes produce little melanin. This albino girl is from [[Papua New Guinea]].]]
In humans, melanin is the primary determinant of [[human skin color|skin color]]. It is also found in [[hair]], the pigmented tissue underlying the [[iris (anatomy)|iris]] of the eye, and the [[stria vascularis of cochlear duct|stria vascularis]] of the [[inner ear]]. In the brain, tissues with melanin include the [[adrenal medulla|medulla]] and pigment-bearing neurons within areas of the [[brainstem]], such as the [[locus coeruleus]]. It also occurs in the [[zona reticularis]] of the [[adrenal gland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Solano|first=F.|date=2014|title=Melanins: Skin Pigments and Much More—Types, Structural Models, Biological Functions, and Formation Routes|journal= New Journal of Science|volume=2014|pages=1–28|doi=10.1155/2014/498276|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The melanin in the skin is produced by [[melanocyte]]s, which are found in the [[Stratum germinativum|basal layer]] of the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]. Although, in general, human beings possess a similar concentration of melanocytes in their skin, the melanocytes in some individuals and ethnic groups produce variable amounts of melanin. Some humans have very little or no melanin synthesis in their bodies, a condition known as [[albinism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Cichorek|first1=Mirosława|last2=Wachulska|first2=Małgorzata|last3=Stasiewicz|first3=Aneta|last4=Tymińska|first4=Agata|date=February 20, 2013|title=Skin melanocytes: biology and development|journal=Advances in Dermatology and Allergology |volume=30|issue=1|pages=30–41|doi=10.5114/pdia.2013.33376|pmc=3834696|pmid=24278043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because melanin is an aggregate of smaller component molecules, there are many different types of melanin with different proportions and bonding patterns of these component molecules. Both pheomelanin and eumelanin are found in human skin and hair, but eumelanin is the most abundant melanin in humans, as well as the form most likely to be deficient in albinism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/oculocutaneous-albinism|title=oculocutaneous albinism|website=Genetics Home Reference|access-date=2017-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eumelanin ===
[[File:Eumelanine.svg|thumb|Part of the structural formula of eumelanin. &quot;(COOH)&quot; can be COOH or H, or (more rarely) other [[substituent]]s. The arrow denotes where the polymer continues.]]
Eumelanin polymers have long been thought to comprise numerous cross-linked 5,6-dihydroxy[[indole]] ([[5,6-dihydroxyindole|DHI]]) and 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-[[carboxylic acid]] ([[DHICA]]) polymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Meredith|first1=Paul|last2=Sarna|first2=Tadeusz|date=2006-12-01|title=The physical and chemical properties of eumelanin|journal=Pigment Cell Research|volume=19|issue=6|pages=572–594|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0749.2006.00345.x|pmid=17083485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of eumelanin, which are brown eumelanin and black eumelanin. Those two types of eumelanin chemically differ from each other in their pattern of polymeric bonds. A small amount of black eumelanin in the absence of other pigments causes grey hair. A small amount of brown eumelanin in the absence of other pigments causes yellow (blond) hair. As the body ages, it continues to produce black eumelanin but stops producing brown eumelanin, resulting in the grey hair that is common in elderly people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ito|first1=S.|last2=Wakamatsu|first2=K.|date=December 2011|title=Diversity of human hair pigmentation as studied by chemical analysis of eumelanin and pheomelanin|journal=Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology: JEADV|volume=25|issue=12|pages=1369–1380|doi=10.1111/j.1468-3083.2011.04278.x|issn=1468-3083|pmid=22077870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pheomelanin ===
[[File:Pheomelanine.svg|thumb|Part of the structural formula of pheomelanin. &quot;(COOH)&quot; can be COOH or H, or (more rarely) other [[substituent]]s. The arrows denote where the polymer continues.]]
Pheomelanins (or phaeomelanins) impart a range of yellowish to reddish colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Slominski A, Tobin DJ, Shibahara S, Wortsman J | title = Melanin pigmentation in mammalian skin and its hormonal regulation | journal = Physiological Reviews | volume = 84 | issue = 4 | pages = 1155–228 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15383650 | doi = 10.1152/physrev.00044.2003 | s2cid = 21168932 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e5483673641f40a5a97f84fbf487d4ecd5a69933 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pheomelanins are particularly concentrated in the lips, nipples, glans of the penis, and vagina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://metacyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=COMPOUND&amp;object=CPD-12380|title=pheomelanin|date=2010|website=MetaCyc Metabolic Pathway Database}} {{full citation needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a small amount of brown eumelanin in hair, which would otherwise cause blond hair, is mixed with red pheomelanin, the result is orange hair, which is typically called [[red hair|&quot;red&quot; or &quot;ginger&quot; hair]]. Pheomelanin is also present in the skin, and redheads consequently often have a more pinkish hue to their skin as well.

In chemical terms, pheomelanins differ from eumelanins in that the oligomer structure incorporates [[benzothiazine]] and [[benzothiazole]] units that are produced,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Greco G, Panzella L, Verotta L, d'Ischia M, Napolitano A |title=Uncovering the structure of human red hair pheomelanin: benzothiazolylthiazinodihydroisoquinolines as key building blocks |journal=Journal of Natural Products |volume=74 |issue=4 |pages=675–82 |date=April 2011  |pmid=21341762 |doi=10.1021/np100740n}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of DHI and [[DHICA]], when the amino acid [[L-cysteine]] is present.

==== Trichochromes ====
Trichochromes (formerly called trichosiderins) are pigments produced from the same [[metabolic pathway]] as the eumelanins and pheomelanins, but unlike those molecules they have low molecular weight. They occur in some red human hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Biochemical sites of gene action for melanogenesis in mammals |author1=Prota, G. |author2=Searle, A.

=== Neuromelanin ===
{{main|Neuromelanin}}
Neuromelanin (NM) is a dark insoluble polymer pigment produced in specific populations of [[Catecholaminergic|catecholaminergic neurons]] in the brain. Humans have the largest amount of NM, which is present in lesser amounts in other primates, and totally absent in many other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fedorow H, Tribl F, Halliday G, Gerlach M, Riederer P, Double KL |title= Neuromelanin in human dopamine neurons: comparison with peripheral melanins and relevance to Parkinson's disease |year = 2005| journal= Prog Neurobiol | volume= 75 | issue= 2 |pages = 109–124 |pmid=15784302 |doi= 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2005.02.001|s2cid= 503902 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The biological function remains unknown, although human NM has been shown to efficiently bind [[transition metals]] such as iron, as well as other potentially toxic molecules. Therefore, it may play crucial roles in [[apoptosis]] and the related [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= Double KL|title= Functional effects of neuromelanin and synthetic melanin in model systems |year =2006 | journal= J Neural Transm | volume= 113 | issue= 6 |pages = 751–756 |pmid= 16755379 |doi= 10.1007/s00702-006-0450-5|s2cid= 23096297 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other organisms ==
Melanins have very diverse roles and functions in various organisms. A form of melanin makes up the ink used by many [[cephalopod]]s (see [[cephalopod ink]]) as a defense mechanism against predators. Melanins also protect microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, against stresses that involve cell damage such as [[UV radiation]] from the sun and [[reactive oxygen species]]. Melanin also protects against damage from high temperatures, chemical stresses (such as [[heavy metals]] and [[oxidizing agents]]), and biochemical threats (such as host defenses against invading microbes).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamilton &amp; Gomez&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hamilton AJ, Gomez BL |title=Melanins in fungal pathogens |journal=Journal of Medical Microbiology |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=189–91 |date=March 2002  |pmid=11871612| doi = 10.1099/0022-1317-51-3-189|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in many pathogenic microbes (for example, in ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]'', a fungus) melanins appear to play important roles in [[virulence]] and [[pathogenicity]] by protecting the microbe against [[immune system|immune]] responses of its [[host (biology)|host]]. In invertebrates, a major aspect of the innate immune defense system against invading pathogens involves melanin. Within minutes after infection, the microbe is encapsulated within melanin (melanization), and the generation of free radical byproducts during the formation of this capsule is thought to aid in killing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cerenius L, Söderhäll K |title=The prophenoloxidase-activating system in invertebrates |journal=Immunological Reviews |volume=198 |pages=116–26 |date=April 2004  |pmid=15199959 |doi=10.1111/j.0105-2896.2004.00116.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some types of fungi, called [[radiotrophic fungus|radiotrophic fungi]], appear to be able to use melanin as a [[photosynthetic pigment]] that enables them to capture [[gamma rays]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Science News |title=Dark Power: Pigment seems to put radiation to good use |date=May 26, 2007 |volume=171 |issue=21 |pages=325 |first=Davide |last=Castelvecchi |doi=10.1002/scin.2007.5591712106}}&lt;/ref&gt; and harness this energy for growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dadachova et al.&quot;&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Dadachova E, Bryan RA, Huang X, etal |title=Ionizing radiation changes the electronic properties of melanin and enhances the growth of melanized fungi |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=e457 |year=2007 |pmid=17520016 |pmc=1866175 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000457|bibcode=2007PLoSO...2..457D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melanin in [[arthropods]] has been observed to be deposited in layers thus producing a [[Bragg reflector]] of alternating refractive index. When the scale of this pattern matches the wavelength of visible light, [[structural coloration]] arises: giving a number of species an [[iridescent]] color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VQHtCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA121|title=Biology of the Arthropod Cuticle|last=Neville|first=A.

Some moth species, including the [[Parasemia plantaginis|wood tiger moth]], convert resources to melanin in order to enhance their thermoregulation. As the wood tiger moth has populations over a large range of latitudes, it has been observed that more northern populations showed higher rates of melanization. In both yellow and white male phenotypes of the wood tiger moth, individuals with more melanin had a heightened ability to trap heat but an increased predation rate due to a weaker and less effective [[Aposematism|aposematic]] signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hegna|first1=Robert H.|last2=Nokelainen|first2=Ossi|last3=Hegna|first3=Jonathan R.|last4=Mappes|first4=Johanna|date=2013|title=To quiver or to shiver: increased melanization benefits thermoregulation, but reduces warning signal efficacy in the wood tiger moth|journal=Proc.

Melanin produced by plants are sometimes referred to as 'catechol melanins' as they can yield [[catechol]] on alkali fusion.

The first step of the biosynthetic pathway for both eumelanins and pheomelanins is [[Enzyme catalysis|catalysed]] by [[tyrosinase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1155/2014/854687|pmid=24895537|pmc=4033337|title=Microbial Tyrosinases: Promising Enzymes for Pharmaceutical, Food Bioprocessing, and Environmental Industry|journal=Biochemistry Research International|volume=2014|pages=1–16 (see Fig. 3)|year=2014|last1=Zaidi|first1=Kamal Uddin|last2=Ali|first2=Ayesha S.|last3=Ali|first3=Sharique A.|last4=Naaz|first4=Ishrat}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:[[Tyrosine]] → [[L-DOPA|DOPA]] → [[dopaquinone]]
Dopaquinone can combine with [[cysteine]] by two pathways to benzothiazines and pheomelanins
:Dopaquinone + cysteine → 5-S-cysteinyldopa → benzothiazine intermediate → pheomelanin

:Dopaquinone + cysteine → 2-S-cysteinyldopa → benzothiazine intermediate → pheomelanin

Also, dopaquinone can be converted to [[leucodopachrome]] and follow two more pathways to the eumelanins
:Dopaquinone → leucodopachrome → [[dopachrome]] → 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid → quinone → eumelanin

:Dopaquinone → leucodopachrome → dopachrome → 5,6-dihydroxyindole → [[quinone]] → eumelanin

Detailed metabolic pathways can be found in the [[KEGG]] database (see [[#External links|External links]]).

== Microscopic appearance ==
Melanin is brown, non-refractile, and finely granular with individual granules having a diameter of less than 800 nanometers. This differentiates melanin from common [[hemosiderin|blood breakdown pigments]], which are larger, chunky, and refractile, and range in color from green to yellow or red-brown. In heavily pigmented lesions, dense aggregates of melanin can obscure histologic detail. A dilute solution of [[potassium permanganate]] is an effective melanin bleach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Melanin|title=Melanin|website=pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2017-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetic disorders and disease states ==

There are approximately nine types of [[oculocutaneous albinism]], which is mostly an autosomal recessive disorder. Certain ethnicities have higher incidences of different forms. For example, the most common type, called oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (OCA2), is especially frequent among people of black [[Africa]]n descent. It is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a [[congenital]] reduction or absence of melanin pigment in the skin, hair, and eyes. The estimated frequency of OCA2 among [[African-American]]s is 1 in 10,000, which contrasts with a frequency of 1 in 36,000 in white Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://albinism.med.umn.edu/mmm.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223001138/http://albinism.med.umn.edu/mmm.htm|url-status=dead|title=Oculocutaneous Albinism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|archive-date=December 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some African nations, the frequency of the disorder is even higher, ranging from 1 in 2,000 to 1 in 5,000.&lt;ref name=emedicine&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1216066-overview|title=Ocular Manifestations of Albinism: Background, Pathophysiology, Epidemiology|date=June 18, 2018|via=eMedicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another form of Albinism, the &quot;yellow oculocutaneous albinism&quot;, appears to be more prevalent among the [[Amish]], who are of primarily [[Switzerland|Swiss]] and [[Germany|German]] ancestry. People with this IB variant of the disorder commonly have white hair and skin at birth, but rapidly develop normal skin pigmentation in infancy.&lt;ref name=emedicine/&gt;

Ocular albinism affects not only eye pigmentation but visual acuity, as well. People with albinism typically test poorly, within the 20/60 to 20/400 range. In addition, two forms of albinism, with approximately 1 in 2700 most prevalent among people of Puerto Rican origin, are associated with mortality beyond melanoma-related deaths.

The connection between albinism and [[deafness]] is well known, though poorly understood. In his 1859 treatise ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', [[Charles Darwin]] observed that &quot;cats which are entirely white and have blue eyes are generally deaf&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pages.britishlibrary.net/charles.darwin/texts/origin_6th/origin6th_01.html|title=Causes of Variability |access-date=September 18, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923014321/http://pages.britishlibrary.net/charles.darwin/texts/origin_6th/origin6th_01.html |archive-date=September 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, hypopigmentation and deafness occur together in the rare [[Waardenburg's syndrome]], predominantly observed among the [[Hopi]] in [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EntrezGene|300700}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incidence of albinism in Hopi Indians has been estimated as approximately 1 in 200 individuals. Similar patterns of albinism and deafness have been found in other mammals, including dogs and rodents. However, a lack of melanin ''per se'' does not appear to be directly responsible for deafness associated with hypopigmentation, as most individuals lacking the enzymes required to synthesize melanin have normal auditory function.&lt;ref&gt;{{EntrezGene|606933}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead the absence of [[melanocytes]] in the stria vascularis of the inner ear results in [[cochlea]]r impairment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cable J, Huszar D, Jaenisch R, Steel KP |title=Effects of mutations at the W locus (c-kit) on inner ear pigmentation and function in the mouse |journal=Pigment Cell Research |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=17–32 |date=February 1994 |pmid=7521050 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0749.1994.tb00015.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; though why this is, is not fully understood.

In Parkinson's disease, a disorder that affects [[neuromotor]] functioning, there is decreased neuromelanin in the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus as consequence of specific dropping out of dopaminergic and noradrenergic pigmented neurons. This results in diminished [[dopamine]] and [[norepinephrine]] synthesis. While no correlation between race and the level of neuromelanin in the substantia nigra has been reported, the significantly lower incidence of Parkinson's in blacks than in whites has &quot;prompt[ed] some to suggest that cutaneous melanin might somehow serve to protect the neuromelanin in substantia nigra from external toxins.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seniorpsychiatry.com/pages/articles/lewy.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721054743/http://www.seniorpsychiatry.com/pages/articles/lewy.html|url-status=dead|title=Lewy Body Disease|archive-date=July 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to melanin deficiency, the molecular weight of the melanin polymer may be decreased by various factors such as oxidative stress, exposure to light, perturbation in its association with melanosomal [[matrix protein]]s, changes in [[pH]], or in local concentrations of metal ions. A decreased molecular weight or a decrease in the degree of polymerization of '''ocular melanin''' has been proposed to turn the normally anti-oxidant polymer into a [[pro-oxidant]]. In its pro-oxidant state, melanin has been suggested to be involved in the causation and progression of [[macular degeneration]] and [[melanoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Meyskens FL, Farmer P, Fruehauf JP |title=Redox regulation in human melanocytes and melanoma |journal=Pigment Cell Research |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=148–54 |date=June 2001 |pmid=11434561 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0749.2001.140303.x |url=https://escholarship.org/content/qt72b7988d/qt72b7988d.pdf?t=nhppep}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rasagiline]], an important monotherapy drug in Parkinson's disease, has melanin binding properties, and melanoma tumor reducing properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Meier-Davis SR, Dines K, Arjmand FM, etal |title=Comparison of oral and transdermal administration of rasagiline mesylate on human melanoma tumor growth in vivo |journal=Cutaneous and Ocular Toxicology |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=312–7 |date=December 2012  |pmid=22515841 |doi=10.3109/15569527.2012.676119|s2cid=30344869 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher eumelanin levels also can be a disadvantage, however, beyond a higher disposition toward vitamin D deficiency. Dark skin is a complicating factor in the laser removal of [[port-wine stain]]s. Effective in treating white skin, in general, lasers are less successful in removing port-wine stains in people of Asian or African descent. Higher concentrations of melanin in darker-skinned individuals simply diffuse and absorb the laser radiation, inhibiting light absorption by the targeted tissue. In similar manner, melanin can complicate laser treatment of other dermatological conditions in people with darker skin.

[[Freckles]] and [[mole (skin marking)|mole]]s are formed where there is a localized concentration of melanin in the skin. They are highly associated with pale skin.

[[Nicotine]] has an affinity for melanin-containing tissues because of its precursor function in melanin synthesis or its irreversible binding of melanin. This has been suggested to underlie the increased [[Nicotine#Dependence|nicotine dependence]] and lower [[smoking cessation]] rates in darker pigmented individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=King G, Yerger VB, Whembolua GL, Bendel RB, Kittles R, Moolchan ET |title=Link between facultative melanin and tobacco use among African Americans |journal=Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior |volume=92 |issue=4 |pages=589–96 |date=June 2009  |pmid=19268687 |doi=10.1016/j.pbb.2009.02.011|s2cid=3070838 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human adaptation ==
===Physiology===
Melanocytes insert granules of melanin into specialized cellular [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] called [[melanosome]]s. These are then transferred into the [[keratinocyte]] cells of the human [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]. The melanosomes in each recipient cell accumulate atop the [[cell nucleus]], where they protect the nuclear [[DNA]] from mutations caused by the [[ionizing radiation]] of the sun's [[ultraviolet]] rays. In general, people whose ancestors lived for long periods in the regions of the globe near the [[equator]] have larger quantities of eumelanin in their skins. This makes their skins brown or black and protects them against high levels of exposure to the sun, which more frequently result in [[melanoma]]s in lighter-skinned people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/genetics/human-skin-color-variation|title=Human Skin Color Variation|date=2012-06-20|website=The Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program|language=en|access-date=2019-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all the effects of pigmentation are advantageous. Pigmentation increases the heat load in hot climates, and dark-skinned people absorb 30% more heat from sunlight than do very light-skinned people, although this factor may be offset by more profuse sweating. In cold climates dark skin entails more heat loss by radiation. Pigmentation also hinders synthesis of [[vitamin D]], so that in areas of poor nutrition darker skinned children are more liable to [[rickets]] than lighter skinned children. Since pigmentation appears to be not entirely advantageous to life in the tropics, other hypotheses about its biological significance have been advanced, for example a secondary phenomenon induced by adaptation to parasites and tropical diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Berth-Jones, J. | chapter=Constitutive pigmentation, human pigmentation and the response to sun exposure | editor1=Tony Burns | editor2=Stephen Breathnach | editor3=Neil Cox | editor4=Christopher Griffiths | title=Rook's Textbook of Dermatology | edition=8th | volume=3 | year=2010 | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | page=58.9 | isbn=978-1-4051-6169-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary origins===
[[Early humans]] evolved to have dark skin color around 1.2 million years ago, as an adaptation to a loss of body hair that increased the effects of UV radiation. Before the development of hairlessness, early humans had reasonably light skin underneath their fur, similar to that found in other [[primate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/19/science/why-humans-and-their-fur-parted-ways.html|title=Why Humans and Their Fur Parted Ways|last=Wade|first=Nicholas|date=2003-08-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-24|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent scientific evidence indicates that [[anatomically modern humans]] evolved in [[Africa]] between 200,000 and 100,000 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Tishkoff SA, Reed FA, Friedlaender FR, etal |title=The genetic structure and history of Africans and African Americans |journal=Science |volume=324 |issue=5930 |pages=1035–44 |date=May 2009  |pmid=19407144 |pmc=2947357 |doi=10.1126/science.1172257|bibcode=2009Sci...324.1035T }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then populated the rest of the world through one migration between 80,000 and 50,000 years ago, in some areas [[Archaic human admixture with modern humans|interbreeding]] with certain [[archaic human]] species ([[Neanderthals]], [[Denisovans]], and possibly others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Single Migration From Africa Populated the World, Studies Find|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/science/ancient-dna-human-history.html?_r=0|work=New York Times|date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems likely that the first modern humans had relatively large numbers of eumelanin-producing melanocytes, producing darker skin similar to the indigenous people of Africa today. As some of these original people migrated and settled in areas of [[Asia]] and [[Europe]], the selective pressure for eumelanin production decreased in climates where radiation from the sun was less intense. This eventually produced the current range of human skin color. Of the two common gene variants known to be associated with pale human skin, ''[[Mc1r]]'' does not appear to have undergone positive selection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harding RM |title=Evidence for variable selective pressures at MC1R |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=1351–61 |date=April 2000 |pmid=10733465 |pmc=1288200 |doi=10.1086/302863 |name-list-style=vanc|author2=Healy E |author3=Ray AJ |display-authors=3 |last4=Ellis |first4=Nichola S. |last5=Flanagan |first5=Niamh |last6=Todd |first6=Carol |last7=Dixon |first7=Craig |last8=Sajantila |first8=Antti |last9=Jackson |first9=Ian J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[SLC24A5]]'' has undergone positive selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Lamason RL, Mohideen MA, Mest JR, etal |title=SLC24A5, a putative cation exchanger, affects pigmentation in zebrafish and humans |journal=Science |volume=310 |issue=5755 |pages=1782–6 |date=December 2005  |pmid=16357253 |doi=10.1126/science.1116238|bibcode=2005Sci...310.1782L |s2cid=2245002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects===
As with peoples having migrated northward, those with light skin migrating toward the equator acclimatize to the much stronger solar radiation. Nature selects for less melanin when ultraviolet radiation is weak. Most people's skin darkens when exposed to UV light, giving them more protection when it is needed. This is the physiological purpose of [[sun tanning]]. Dark-skinned people, who produce more skin-protecting eumelanin, have a greater protection against [[sunburn]] and the development of melanoma, a potentially deadly form of skin cancer, as well as other health problems related to exposure to strong [[solar radiation]], including the [[photodegradation]] of certain [[vitamin]]s such as [[riboflavin]]s, [[carotenoid]]s, [[tocopherol]], and [[folate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Jablonski|first1=Nina G.|last2=Chaplin|first2=George|date=2010-05-11|title=Human skin pigmentation as an adaptation to UV radiation|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=107|issue=Supplement 2|pages=8962–8968|doi=10.1073/pnas.0914628107|pmid=20445093|pmc=3024016|bibcode=2010PNAS..107.8962J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Northwestern Europeans]] have substantially lost the ability to tan as a result of relaxed natural selection.  Their skin burns and peels rather than tans. This is due to the fact that they produce a defective form of a skin protein Mc1r (melanocortin-1 receptor) which is necessary for the production of melanin.  They are at a distinct disadvantage in tropical and subtropical environments.  Not only do they suffer the discomfort of readily burning, but they are at a much higher risk for skin cancer; the same is true of albinos.&lt;ref&gt;https://www2.palomar.edu/anthro/adapt/adapt_4.htm&lt;/ref&gt;


Melanin in the eyes, in the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] and [[choroid]], helps protect them from [[ultraviolet]] and [[high-energy visible light|high-frequency visible light]]; people with [[Eye color|gray, blue, and green eyes]] are more at risk of sun-related eye problems. &lt;!--
remainder of this paragraph is a tangent that could and probably should be deleted
--&gt; Further, the ocular lens yellows with age, providing added protection. However, the lens also becomes more rigid with age, losing most of its [[accommodation (eye)|accommodation]] — the ability to change shape to focus from far to near — a detriment due probably to [[protein]] crosslinking caused by UV exposure.

Recent research suggests that melanin may serve a protective role other than photoprotection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liu Y, Hong L, Kempf VR, Wakamatsu K, Ito S, Simon JD |title=Ion-exchange and adsorption of Fe(III) by Sepia melanin |journal=Pigment Cell Research |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=262–9 |date=June 2004 |pmid=15140071 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0749.2004.00140.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Melanin is able to effectively [[chelation|chelate]] metal ions through its carboxylate and phenolic hydroxyl groups, in many cases much more efficiently than the powerful chelating ligand ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA). Thus, it may serve to sequester potentially toxic metal ions, protecting the rest of the cell. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the loss of neuromelanin observed in Parkinson's disease is accompanied by an increase in iron levels in the brain.

With Edward still in the north, the royal army was defeated by a Neville force at [[Battle of Edgecote Moor|Edgecote Moor]] on 26 July 1469. After the battle, Edward was held in [[Middleham Castle]]; on 12 August, his father-in-law Richard Woodville and Richard's younger son, [[John Woodville]], were executed at [[Kenilworth]]. However, it soon became clear there was little support for Warwick or Clarence; Edward was released in September and resumed the throne.{{sfn|Gillingham|1990|p=160}}

Outwardly, the situation remained unchanged, but tensions persisted and Edward did nothing to reduce the Nevilles' sense of vulnerability. The Percys, traditional rivals of the Neville family in the North, fought for Lancaster at Towton; their titles and estates were confiscated and given to Warwick's brother John Neville. In early 1470, Edward reinstated [[Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland|Henry Percy]] as [[Earl of Northumberland]]; John was compensated with the title [[Marquess of Montagu]], but this was a significant demotion for a key supporter.{{sfn|Ross|1974|pp=135–136}}

In March 1470, Warwick and Clarence exploited a private feud to initiate a [[1470 Lincolnshire Rebellion|full-scale revolt]]; when it was defeated, the two fled to France in May 1470.{{sfn|Kendall|1970|p=228}} Seeing an opportunity, Louis XI persuaded Warwick to negotiate with his long-time enemy, Margaret of Anjou; she eventually agreed, first making him kneel before her in silence for fifteen minutes.{{sfn|Ashley|2002|p=170}} With French support, Warwick landed in England on 9 September 1470 and announced his intention to restore Henry.{{sfn|Kendall|1970|p=236}} By now, the Yorkist regime was deeply unpopular and the Lancastrians rapidly assembled an army of over 30,000; when John Neville switched sides, Edward was forced into exile in [[Bruges]].{{sfn|Ross|1974|pp=152–153}}

===Exile and restoration===
[[File:Beheading duke somerset.jpg|thumb|right|Edward IV (left) watching the execution of [[Edmund Beaufort, 4th Duke of Somerset]], at Tewkesbury, 1471]]
Edward took refuge in [[Flanders]], part of the Duchy of Burgundy, accompanied by a few hundred men, including his younger brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, Anthony Woodville and William Hastings.{{sfn|Penn|2019|p=243}} The Duchy was ruled by [[Charles the Bold]], husband of his sister Margaret; he provided minimal help, something Edward never forgot.{{sfn|Penn|2019|pp=256–258}}

The [[Readeption of Henry VI|restored Lancastrian regime]] faced the same issue that dominated Henry's previous reign. Mental and physical frailties made him incapable of ruling and resulted in an internal struggle for control, made worse because the coalition that put him back on the throne consisted of bitter enemies. [[Edmund Beaufort, 4th Duke of Somerset]], held Warwick responsible for [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|his father]]'s death in 1455, while he had executed his elder brother in 1464; Warwick and Clarence quickly found themselves isolated by the new regime.{{sfn|Penn|2019|pp=260–261}}   

Backed by wealthy Flemish merchants, in March 1471 Edward landed near [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], close to his estates in Yorkshire. Supporters were initially reluctant to commit; the key northern city of [[York]] opened its gates only when he claimed to be seeking the return of his dukedom, like [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] seventy years earlier. The first significant contingent to join was a group of 600 men under [[William Parr (died 1483)|Sir William Parr]] and [[James Harrington (Yorkist knight)|Sir James Harrington]].{{sfn|Horrox|1989|p=41}} Parr fought against the Yorkists at Edgecote in 1469 and his defection confirmed Clarence's decision to switch sides; as they marched south, more recruits came in, including 3,000 at Leicester.{{sfn|Penn|2019|p=263}}

Edward entered London unopposed and took Henry prisoner; Warwick was defeated and killed at the [[Battle of Barnet]] on 14 April, while a second Lancastrian army was destroyed at the [[Battle of Tewkesbury]] on 4 May. 16 year old Edward of Westminster died on the battlefield, with surviving leaders like Somerset executed shortly afterwards. This was followed by Henry's death a few days later; a contemporary chronicle claimed this was due to &quot;melancholy,&quot; but it is generally assumed he was killed on Edward's orders.{{sfn|Wolfe|1981|p=347}}

Although the Lancastrian cause seemed at an end, the regime was destabilised by an ongoing quarrel between Clarence and his brother Gloucester. The two were married to Isabel Neville and [[Anne Neville]] respectively, the daughters of the Earl and [[Anne Beauchamp, 16th Countess of Warwick|Countess of Warwick]] and heirs to their mother's considerable inheritance.{{sfn|Ross|1981|pp=26–27}} Many of the estates held by the brothers had been granted by Edward, who could also remove them, making them dependent on his favour. This was not the case with property acquired through marriage and explains the importance of this dispute.{{sfn|Penn|2019|pp=306–307}}

===1471 to 1483===
[[File:Edward IV Plantagenet.jpg|thumb|left|Edward IV c.1520, posthumous portrait from original c. 1470–75; it shows signs of the corpulence that affected him in later life]]
The last significant rebellion ended in March 1474 with the surrender of [[John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford]], who survived to command the Lancastrian army at [[Battle of Bosworth Field|Bosworth]] in 1485. Clarence was widely suspected of involvement, a factor in his eventual death in the Tower on 18 February 1478; claims he &quot;drowned in a butt of [[Malmsey]] wine&quot; appear to have been a joke by Edward, referring to his favourite drink.{{sfn|Penn|2019|p=406}}

In 1475, Edward allied with Burgundy, and declared war on France. However, with Duke Charles focused on [[Siege of Neuss|besieging Neuss]], Louis opened negotiations and soon after Edward landed at Calais, the two signed the [[Treaty of Picquigny]].{{sfn|Penn|2019 |pp=364–365}} Edward received an immediate payment of 75,000 [[Crown (English coin)|crowns]], plus a yearly pension of 50,000 crowns, thus allowing him to recoup the costs of his army.{{sfn|Hicks|2011|p=18}}

In 1482, Edward backed an attempt to usurp the Scottish throne by [[Alexander Stewart, 1st Duke of Albany]], brother of [[James III of Scotland]]. Gloucester invaded Scotland and took the town of [[Edinburgh]], but not the far more formidable [[Edinburgh Castle|castle]], where James was being held by his own nobles. Albany switched sides and without siege equipment, the English army was forced to withdraw, with little to show for an expensive campaign, apart from the capture of [[Berwick Castle]].{{sfn|Penn|2019|pp=434–435}}

Edward's health began to fail, and he became subject to an increasing number of ailments; his physicians attributed this in part to a habitual use of emetics, which allowed him to gorge himself at meals, then return after vomiting to start again.{{sfn|Penn|2019|p=431}} He fell fatally ill at Easter 1483, but survived long enough to add codicils to his will, the most important naming his brother as Protector after his death. He died on 9 April 1483 and was buried in [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]]. His twelve-year-old son, [[Edward V]], was never crowned, Gloucester becoming King [[Richard III]] in July.{{sfn|Penn|2019|p=494}}

The cause of Edward's death is uncertain; allegations of poison were common in an era when lack of medical knowledge meant death often had no obvious explanation. Other suggestions include pneumonia or [[malaria]], although both were well-known and easy to describe. One contemporary attributed it to apoplexy brought on by excess, which fits with what is known of his physical habits.{{sfn|Ross|1974|pp=414–415}}

While the War of the Roses has been documented by numerous historians, Edward as an individual is less well known; 19th century historians like [[William Stubbs]] generally dismissed him as a bloodthirsty nonentity. The most comprehensive modern biography was written by [[Charles Ross (historian)|Charles Ross]] in 1974, who concluded that Edward's greatest apparent achievement – the peace and stability of his latter years – was squandered in short-term aggrandisement.{{sfn|Ross|1974}} Ross states Edward &quot;remains the only king in English history since 1066 in active possession of his throne who failed to secure the safe succession of his son. His lack of political foresight is largely to blame for the unhappy aftermath of his early death.&quot;{{sfn|Ross|1974|p=451}}

Edward is here shown receiving a manuscript copy from Woodville and the scribe. With Edward are depicted his wife Elizabeth, the Prince of Wales (later [[Edward V]]), and the Duke of Gloucester (later [[Richard III]])]]

==Political==
{{Main|Great Bullion Famine|Great Slump (15th century)}}
Commentators observe a marked difference between Edward's first period as king, and the second. The failure of attempts to reconcile former enemies like Somerset meant he was noticeably more ruthless after 1471, including the execution of his brother Clarence.{{sfn|Whittle|2017|pp=22–24}} In his youth, Edward was a capable and charismatic military commander, who led from the front, but as he grew older, the energy noted by contemporaries became less apparent.{{sfn|Penn|2019|p=370}}

One effect of this was that Parliament became increasingly reluctant to approve taxes for wars which Edward failed to prosecute, then used the funds instead to finance his household expenditures. Under his rule, ownership of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] was transferred to the Crown, where it remains today. In 1478, his staff prepared the so-called 'Black Book', a comprehensive review of government finances, still in use a century later.{{sfn|Chibnall|1960|pp=340–341}} He invested heavily in business ventures with the [[City of London]], which he used as an additional source of funding.{{sfn|Ross|1974|p=351}}

Although the economy recovered from the [[Great Slump (15th century)|depression of 1450 to 1470]], Edward's spending habitually exceeded income; on his death in 1483, the Crown had less than £1,200 in cash. His close relationship with the London branch of the [[Medici Bank]] ended in its bankruptcy; in 1517, the Medicis were still seeking repayment of Edward's debts.{{sfn|Rorke|2006|p=270}}

Economics was closely linked to foreign policy; Edward's reign was dominated by the three sided diplomatic contest between England, France, and Burgundy, with two of the three seeking to ally against the third.{{efn|This resurfaced in the 17th century contest between England, the [[Dutch Republic]], and France under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]}} As Flemish merchants were the largest buyers of English wool, Edward was generally pro-Burgundian, although Duke Charles' reluctance to support him in 1471 impacted their relationship. The [[Battle of Nancy|death of Charles]] in 1477 led to the 1482 [[Treaty of Arras (1482)|Treaty of Arras]]; Flanders, along with the lands known as the [[Burgundian Netherlands]], became part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and France acquired the rest. Edward and his successors lost much of their leverage as a result.{{sfn|Kerling|1954|pp=51–57}}

===Cultural===
[[File:Eltham Palace, April 2018 (4).jpg|thumb|left|Edward's Great Hall, [[Eltham Palace]], ca 2018]]
Edward's court was described by a visitor from Europe as &quot;the most splendid ... in all Christendom&quot;.{{sfn|Ross|1974|pp=270–277}} He spent large amounts on expensive status symbols to show off his power and wealth as king of England, while his collecting habits show an eye for style and an interest in scholarship, particularly history. He acquired fine clothes, jewels, and furnishings, as well as a collection of beautifully illuminated historical and literary manuscripts, many made specially for him by craftsmen in Bruges.{{sfn|Backhouse|1987|pp=26, 28, 39}} {{sfn|McKendrick|2011|pp=42–65}}

These included books for both entertainment and instruction, whose contents reveal his interests. They focus on the lives of great rulers, including [[Julius Caesar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=La Grande histoire César |work=Digitised Manuscripts |publisher=British Library |date=1479 |url=http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Royal_MS_17_f_ii&amp;index=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; historical chronicles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jean de Wavrin, Recueil des croniques d'Engleterre, vol. 1 |work=Digitised Manuscripts |publisher=British Library |date=1471 |url=http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Royal_MS_15_e_iv&amp;index=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and instructional and religious works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Guyart des Moulins, La Bible historiale |work=Digitised Manuscripts |publisher=British Library |date=1470 |url=http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Royal_MS_15_d_i&amp;index=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1476, [[William Caxton]] established the first English printing press in the outbuildings of [[Westminster Abbey]]; on 18 November 1477, he produced [[Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers|Sayengis of the Philosophres]], translated into English for Edward by [[Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers|Anthony Woodville]].{{sfn|Timbs|1855|p=4}}

It is not known where or how Edward's library was stored, but it is recorded that he transferred volumes from the [[Great Wardrobe]] to Eltham Palace and that he had a yeoman &quot;to kepe the king's bookes&quot;.{{sfn|Thurley|1993|p=141}} {{sfn|Harris|1830|p=125}} More than forty of his books survive intact from the 15th century, which suggests they were carefully stored, and are now included in the [[Royal manuscripts, British Library|Royal Collection of manuscripts]], held by the British Library.{{sfn|Doyle|2011|p=69}}

Edward spent large sums on [[Eltham Palace]], including the still-extant Great Hall, site of a feast for 2,000 people in December 1482, shortly before his death in April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eltham Palace and Gardens |url=https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/eltham-palace-and-gardens/history/ |website=English Heritage |accessdate=17 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also began a major upgrade of St George's Chapel, Windsor, where he was buried in 1483; later completed by Henry VII, it was badly damaged during the [[First English Civil War]], and little of the original work remains.{{sfn|Panton|2011|pp=431–432}}

=={{anchor|issue}}Marriage and children==
Edward had ten children by Elizabeth Woodville, seven of whom survived him; they were declared illegitimate under the 1483 Titulus Regius, an act repealed by Henry VII, who married his eldest daughter, Elizabeth.{{sfn|Carson|2009|}}
* [[Elizabeth of York]] (11 February 1466&amp;nbsp;– 11 February 1503), [[queen consort]] of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]].
* [[Mary of York]] (11 August 1467&amp;nbsp;– 23 May 1482).
* [[Cecily of York]] (20 March 1469&amp;nbsp;– 24 August 1507); married [[John Welles, 1st Viscount Welles]], then Thomas Kyme or Keme;
* [[Edward V]] (4 November 1470&amp;nbsp;– c. 1483); disappeared, assumed murdered prior to his coronation, ca 1483;
* [[Margaret of York (1472)|Margaret of York]] (10 April 1472&amp;nbsp;– 11 December 1472).
* [[Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York]] (17 August 1473&amp;nbsp;– c. 1483); disappeared, assumed murdered ca 1483;
* [[Anne of York (daughter of Edward IV)|Anne of York]] (2 November 1475&amp;nbsp;– 23 November 1511); married [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Thomas Howard]] (later 3rd Duke of Norfolk).
* [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Bedford]] (March 1477&amp;nbsp;– March 1479).
* [[Catherine of York]] (14 August 1479&amp;nbsp;– 15 November 1527); married [[William Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon]].
* [[Bridget of York]] (10 November 1480&amp;nbsp;– 1517); became a nun.

Edward had numerous mistresses, including [[Lady Eleanor Talbot]] and [[Elizabeth Lucy]], possibly daughter of Thomas Waite (or Wayte), of Southampton. The most famous was [[Jane Shore]], later compelled by Richard III to perform public penance at [[Paul's Cross]]; [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]] claimed this backfired, since &quot;albeit she were out of al array save her kyrtle only: yet went she so fair &amp; lovely … that her great shame wan her much praise.&quot;{{sfn|Horrox|2004}}

Edward had several acknowledged illegitimate children;
* Elizabeth Plantagenet (born circa 1464), possibly daughter of Elizabeth Lucy, who married Thomas, son of George Lumley, [[Baron Lumley]]{{sfn|Corbet|2015|p=316}}{{sfn |Burke|1836|p=290}} {{sfn|Mackenzie|1825|p=136}}
* [[Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle]] (1460s/1470s&amp;nbsp;– 3 March 1542), author of the [[Lisle Papers]], an important historical source for the Tudor period. From his first marriage to [[Elizabeth Grey, 6th Baroness Lisle|Elizabeth Grey]], he had three daughters, Frances, Elizabeth and Bridget Plantagenet.
* Grace Plantagenet, recorded as attending the funeral of Elizabeth Woodville in 1492;{{sfn|Given-Wilson|Curteis|1984|pp=158, 161–174}}

There are claims for many others, including Mary, second wife of Henry Harman of Ellam, and Isabel Mylbery (born circa 1470), who married John Tuchet, son of [[John Tuchet, 6th Baron Audley]]. However, the evidence for these is circumstantial.{{sfn|Ashdown-Hill|2016|loc=Chapter 28}}

==Aftermath==
[[File:El cardenal Reginald Pole, por Sebastiano del Piombo.jpg|thumb|right|Cardinal [[Reginald Pole]], (1500–1558), last legitimate male Yorkist heir]]
Edward IV's eldest son, also named Edward, was made [[Prince of Wales]] when he was seven months old and given his own household at the age of three. Based in Ludlow Castle, he was supervised by his uncle, Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers, who also acted as his regent for the [[Council of Wales and the Marches]].{{sfn|Parry|1851|p=11}} The historical consensus is he and his brother Richard were killed, probably between July to September 1483; debate on who gave the orders, and why, continues, although their uncle Richard III was the beneficiary.{{sfn|Penn|2019|p=497}} 

By mid-August, Elizabeth Woodville was certain of the deaths of her sons; after her initial grief turned to fury, she opened secret talks with Margaret Beaufort. She promised her support in return for Henry's agreement to marry her eldest daughter Elizabeth.{{sfn|Penn|2019|pp=504–505}} In December 1483, Henry swore an oath to do so, which he duly carried out after his coronation in October 1485.{{sfn|Williams|1973|p=25}}

Prior to his succession, Richard III declared his nephews illegitimate, on the grounds his brother's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville was invalid.{{sfn|Penn|2019|pp=504–505}} The [[Titulus Regius]] argued Edward had agreed to marry Lady Eleanor Talbot, rendering his marriage to Elizabeth Woodville void. Both parties were dead, but [[Robert Stillington]], Bishop of Bath and Wells, claimed to have carried out the ceremony. The Titulus was annulled by Henry VII, since his marriage to her daughter Elizabeth added legitimacy to his claim; Stillington died in prison in 1491.{{sfn|Crawford|2008|p=130}} 

Despite this apparent resolution, the Yorkist cause continued well into the 16th century. The most famous are the pretenders [[Lambert Simnel]] and [[Perkin Warbeck]] but Yorkist challengers remained a concern for Henry VII and his son. In 1541, [[Henry VIII]] executed [[Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury]], daughter of the Duke of Clarence, while a number of attempts were made on the life of her son, the last legitimate direct heir, Cardinal [[Reginald Pole]], who died in 1558.{{sfn|Seward|2014|pp=316–320}}

'''James Ramsay MacDonald''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|FRS}} (''né'' '''James McDonald Ramsay'''; 12 October 1866{{spaced ndash}}9 November 1937) was a British politician who was the first [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] member to become [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], leading [[Minority government|minority]] Labour governments for [[First MacDonald ministry|nine months in 1924]] and then from [[Second MacDonald ministry|1929–31]]. From 1931 to 1935, he headed a [[National Government (1931–1935)|National Government]] dominated by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and supported by only a few Labour members. MacDonald was expelled from the Labour Party as a result.

MacDonald, along with [[Keir Hardie]] and [[Arthur Henderson]], was one of the three principal founders of the Labour Party in 1900. He was chairman of the Labour MPs before 1914 and, after an eclipse in his career caused by his opposition to the First World War, he was [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]] from 1922. The second Labour Government (1929–31) was dominated by the [[Great Depression]]. He formed the National Government to carry out spending cuts to defend the [[gold standard]], but it had to be abandoned after the [[Invergordon Mutiny]], and he called a [[1931 United Kingdom general election|general election in 1931]] seeking a &quot;doctor's mandate&quot; to fix the economy. The National coalition won an overwhelming landslide and the Labour Party was reduced to a rump of around 50 seats in the House of Commons. His health deteriorated and he stood down as Prime Minister in 1935, remaining as [[Lord President of the Council]] until retiring in 1937. He died later that year.

MacDonald's speeches, pamphlets and books made him an important theoretician. Historian John Shepherd states that &quot;MacDonald's natural gifts of an imposing presence, handsome features and a persuasive oratory delivered with an arresting Highlands accent made him the iconic Labour leader&quot;. After 1931, MacDonald was repeatedly and bitterly denounced by the Labour movement as a traitor to its cause. Since the 1960s, historians have defended his reputation, emphasising his earlier role in building up the Labour Party, dealing with the Great Depression, and as a putative forerunner of the political realignments of the 1990s and 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;John Shepherd, &quot;The Lad from Lossiemouth.&quot; ''History today'' 57#11 (2007): 31+&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
===Lossiemouth===
MacDonald was born at Gregory Place, [[Lossiemouth]], Morayshire, Scotland, the [[illegitimacy|illegitimate]] son of John MacDonald, a farm labourer, and Anne Ramsay, a housemaid.&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, David: Ramsay MacDonald, London, 1977, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; Registered at birth as James McDonald (sic) Ramsay, he was known as Jaimie MacDonald. Illegitimacy could be a serious handicap in 19th-century [[Presbyterian]] Scotland, but in the north and northeast farming communities this was less of a problem; in 1868 a report of the Royal Commission on the Employment of Children, Young Persons and Women in Agriculture noted that the illegitimacy rate was around 15%—nearly every sixth person was born out of wedlock.&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald's mother had worked as a domestic servant at Claydale farm, near [[Alves, Moray|Alves]], where his father was also employed. They were to have been married, but the wedding never took place, either because the couple quarrelled and chose not to marry, or because Anne's mother, Isabella Ramsay, stepped in to prevent her daughter from marrying a man she deemed unsuitable.&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1887BloodySunday.jpg|thumb|left|Bloody Sunday.]]

Ramsay MacDonald received an elementary education at the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] school in Lossiemouth from 1872 to 1875, and then at Drainie parish school. He left school at the end of the summer term in 1881, at the age of 15, and began work on a nearby farm. In December 1881, he was appointed a [[pupil teacher]] at Drainie parish school.&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885, he left to take up a position as an assistant to Mordaunt Crofton, a clergyman in [[Bristol]] who was attempting to establish a Boys' and Young Men's Guild at [[St Stephen's Church, Bristol|St Stephen's Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; In Bristol Ramsay MacDonald joined the Democratic Federation, a [[Radicals (UK)|Radical]] organisation, which changed its name a few months later to the [[Social Democratic Federation]] (SDF).&lt;ref&gt;Bryher, Samual: An Account of the Labour and Socialist Movement in Bristol, 1929&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elton, p.44&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in the group when it left the SDF to become the [[Bristol Socialist Society]]. In early 1886 he moved to London.&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, pp. 9, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovering socialism in London===
Following a short period of work addressing envelopes at the [[National Cyclists' Union]] in [[Fleet Street]], he found himself unemployed and forced to live on the small amount of money he had saved from his time in Bristol. MacDonald eventually found employment as an invoice clerk in the warehouse of Cooper, Box and Co.&lt;ref&gt;Tracey, Herbert: J. Ramsay MacDonald, 1924, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he was deepening his socialist credentials, and engaged himself energetically in [[C. L. Fitzgerald]]'s [[Socialist Union (UK)|Socialist Union]] which, unlike the SDF, aimed to progress socialist ideals through the parliamentary system.&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald witnessed the [[Bloody Sunday (1887)|Bloody Sunday]] of 13 November 1887 in [[Trafalgar Square]], and in response, had a pamphlet published by the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'', entitled ''Remember Trafalgar Square: Tory Terrorism in 1887''.&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

MacDonald retained an interest in Scottish politics. [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone's]] [[first Irish Home Rule Bill]] inspired the setting-up of a Scottish Home Rule Association in Edinburgh. On 6 March 1888, MacDonald took part in a meeting of London-based Scots, who, upon his motion, formed the London General Committee of the Scottish Home Rule Association.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''J. Ramsay MacDonald'' (1987) p.17&lt;/ref&gt; For a while he supported home rule for Scotland, but found little support among London's Scots.&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; However, MacDonald never lost his interest in Scottish politics and home rule, and in ''Socialism: critical and constructive'', published in 1921, he wrote: &quot;The Anglification of Scotland has been proceeding apace to the damage of its education, its music, its literature, its genius, and the generation that is growing up under this influence is uprooted from its past.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MacDonald1921&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=MacDonald|first=James Ramsay|title=Socialism: critical and constructive|url=https://archive.org/details/socialismcritica00macdiala|publisher=Cassell and Company Ltd|year=1921|series=Cassell's social economics series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politics in the 1880s was still of less importance to MacDonald than furthering his education. From 1886-87, MacDonald studied botany, agriculture, mathematics, and physics.at the [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck Literary and Scientific Institution]] (now Birkbeck, University of London) but his health suddenly failed him due to exhaustion one week before his examinations, which put an end to any thought of a scientific career.&lt;ref&gt;Elton, pp.56–57&lt;/ref&gt; He would however, later be appointed a Governor of the institution in 1895, and continued to have a great fondness for the mission of Birkbeck into his later years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/letter-from-ramsay-mcdonald-to-birkbeck-college-birkbeck-university-of-london/0gG6ATbzWgb9-A|title=Letter from Ramsay McDonald to Birkbeck College - Birkbeck, University of London|website=Google Arts &amp; Culture|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, MacDonald took employment as private secretary to [[Thomas Lough]] who was a tea merchant and a [[Radicalism (historical)|Radical]] politician.&lt;ref&gt;Conor Cruise O' Brien, ''Parnell and his Party'' 1957, p.275&lt;/ref&gt; Lough was elected as the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Islington West (UK Parliament constituency)|West Islington]], in 1892. Many doors now opened to MacDonald: he had access to the [[National Liberal Club]] as well as the editorial offices of Liberal and Radical newspapers; he made himself known to various London Radical clubs among Radical and labour politicians.  MacDonald gained valuable experience in the workings of electioneering.  At the same time he left Lough's employment to branch out as a freelance journalist.  Elsewhere, as a member of the [[Fabian Society]] for some time, MacDonald toured and lectured on its behalf at the [[London School of Economics]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brothers Grimm Blow.jpg|thumb|Wilhelm Grimm and Jacob Grimm in 1847]]
The '''Brothers Grimm''' (''{{lang|de|die Brüder Grimm}}'' or ''{{lang|de|die Gebrüder Grimm}}'', {{IPA-de|diː ɡəˈbʁyːdɐ ɡʁɪm|lang|De-die Gebrüder Grimm.ogg}}), [[Jacob Grimm|Jacob Ludwig Karl Grimm]] (1785–1863) and [[Wilhelm Grimm|Wilhelm Carl Grimm]] (1786–1859), were German academics, [[philologists]], cultural researchers, [[Lexicography|lexicographers]] and authors who together collected and published [[folklore]] during the 19th century. They were among the first and best-known collectors of German and European folk tales, and popularized traditional oral tale types such as &quot;[[Cinderella]]&quot; (&quot;{{lang|de|Aschenputtel}}&quot;), &quot;[[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog Prince]]&quot; (&quot;{{lang|de|Der Froschkönig}}&quot;), &quot;[[The Goose-Girl]]&quot; (&quot;Die Gänsemagd&quot;), &quot;[[Hansel and Gretel]]&quot; (&quot;{{lang|de|Hänsel und Gretel}}&quot;), &quot;[[Rapunzel]]&quot;, &quot;[[Beauty and the Beast]]&quot;, &quot;[[Little Red Riding Hood]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Wolf and the Seven Young Goats]]&quot;, &quot;[[Rumpelstiltskin]]&quot; (&quot;{{lang|de|Rumpelstilzchen}}&quot;), &quot;[[Sleeping Beauty]]&quot; (&quot;{{lang|de|Dornröschen}}&quot;), and &quot;[[Snow White]]&quot; (&quot;{{lang|de|Schneewittchen}}&quot;). Their classic collection, ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales|Children's and Household Tales]]'' (''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausmärchen}}''), was published in two volumes—the first in 1812 and the second in 1815.

The brothers were born in the town of [[Hanau]] in [[Hesse-Cassel]] (now Germany) and spent most of their childhood in the nearby town of [[Steinau an der Straße|Steinau]]. Their father's death in 1796 impoverished  the family and affected the brothers for many years after. They attended the [[University of Marburg]] where they began a lifelong dedication to researching the early history of German language and literature, including German [[Oral tradition|folktales]]. The rise of [[Romanticism]] during the 18th century had revived interest in traditional folk stories, which to the Grimms and their colleagues represented a pure form of national literature and culture. The Brothers Grimm established a methodology for collecting and recording folk stories that became the basis for [[folkloristics|folklore studies]]. Between the first edition of 1812–1815 and the seventh (and final) edition of 1857, they revised their collection many times, so that it grew from 156 stories to more than 200.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The original folk &amp; fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm : the complete first edition|others=Grimm, Wilhelm, 1786-1859,, Grimm, Jacob, 1785-1863,, Zipes, Jack, 1937-, Dezsö, Andrea|isbn=9780691160597|location=Princeton [New Jersey]|oclc=879662315|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to collecting and editing folk tales, the brothers compiled German legends. Individually, they published a large body of linguistic and literary scholarship. Together, in 1838, they began work on a massive historical German dictionary (''{{lang|de|[[Deutsches Wörterbuch]]}}'') which, in their lifetimes, they completed only as far as the word ''Frucht'' ('fruit').

Many of the Grimms' folk tales have enjoyed enduring popularity. The tales are available in more than 100 languages and have been adapted by filmmakers including [[Lotte Reiniger]] and [[Walt Disney]], with films such as ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' and ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]''. During the 1930s and 40s, the tales were used as propaganda by the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]; later in the 20th century, psychologists such as [[Bruno Bettelheim]] reaffirmed the value of the work, in spite of the cruelty and violence in original versions of some of the tales (which the Grimms eventually sanitized).

=== Early life ===
[[File:Steinau Brüder-Grimm-Haus 2016-04-10-12-06-37.jpg|thumb|left|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm lived in this house in [[Steinau an der Straße|Steinau]] from 1791 to 1796.]]
[[Jacob Grimm|Jacob Ludwig Carl Grimm]] was born on 4&amp;nbsp;January 1785, and his brother [[Wilhelm Grimm|Wilhelm Carl Grimm]] was born on 24&amp;nbsp;February 1786. Both were born in [[Hanau]], in the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (present-day Germany), to [[Philipp Grimm|Philipp Wilhelm Grimm]], a [[jurist]], and Dorothea Grimm née Zimmer, daughter of a [[Kassel]] city councilman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)2ff&quot; /&gt; They were the second- and third-eldest surviving siblings in a family of nine children, three of whom died in infancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitt&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Herman George ({{lang|de|Friedrich Hermann Georg}}; 12 December 1783&amp;nbsp;– 16 March 1784), [[Jacob Grimm|Jacob]], [[Wilhelm Grimm|Wilhelm]], Carl Frederick ({{lang|de|Carl Friedrich}}; 24 April 1787&amp;nbsp;– 25 May 1852), Ferdinand Philip ({{lang|de|Ferdinand Philipp}}; 18 December 1788&amp;nbsp;– 6 January 1845), Louis Emil ({{lang|de|Ludwig Emil}}; 14 March 1790&amp;nbsp;– 4 April 1863), Frederick ({{lang|de|Friedrich}}; 15 June 1791&amp;nbsp;– 20 August 1792), Charlotte &quot;Lotte&quot; Amalie (10 May 1793&amp;nbsp;– 15 June 1833) and George Edward ({{lang|de|Georg Eduard}}; 26 July 1794&amp;nbsp;– 19 April 1795).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Michaelis-Jena-9&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Michaelis-Jena|1970|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1791, the family moved to the countryside town of [[Steinau an der Straße|Steinau]], when Philipp was employed there as district [[magistrate]] (''{{lang|de|[[Amtmann]]}}'').  The family became prominent members of the community, residing in a large home surrounded by fields. Biographer [[Jack Zipes]] writes that the brothers were happy in Steinau and &quot;clearly fond of country life&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)2ff&quot; /&gt; The children were educated at home by private tutors, receiving strict instruction as [[Lutherans]] that instilled in both a lifelong religious faith.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Scurla: Die Brüder Grimm, Berlin 1985, pp. 14–16&lt;/ref&gt; Later, they attended local schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)2ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|pp=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1796, Philipp Grimm died of pneumonia, plunging his family into poverty, and they were forced to relinquish their servants and large house. Dorothea depended on financial support from her father and sister, who was the first [[lady-in-waiting]] at the court of [[William I, Elector of Hesse]]. Jacob was the eldest living son, and he was forced at age 11 to assume adult responsibilities (shared with Wilhelm) for the next two years. The two boys adhered to the advice of their grandfather, who continually exhorted them to be industrious.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)2ff&quot; /&gt;

The brothers left Steinau and their family in 1798 to attend the ''{{lang|de|[[Friedrichsgymnasium Kassel|Friedrichsgymnasium]]}}'' in [[Kassel]], which had been arranged and paid for by their aunt. By then, they were without a male provider (their grandfather died that year), forcing them to rely entirely on each other, and they became exceptionally close. The two brothers differed in temperament; Jacob was introspective and Wilhelm was outgoing (although he often suffered from ill health). Sharing a strong work ethic, they excelled in their studies. In Kassel, they became acutely aware of their inferior social status relative to &quot;high-born&quot; students who received more attention. Still, each brother graduated at the head of his class: Jacob in 1803 and Wilhelm in 1804.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)2ff&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)31ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kassel ===
After graduation from the ''{{lang|de|Friedrichsgymnasium}}'', the brothers attended the [[University of Marburg]]. The university was small with about 200 students and there they became painfully aware that students of lower social status were not treated equally. They were disqualified from admission because of their social standing and had to request dispensation to study law. Wealthier students received stipends, but the brothers were excluded even from tuition aid. Their poverty kept them from student activities or university social life; ironically, however, their outsider status worked in their favor, and they pursued their studies with extra vigor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)31ff&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Jacob und Wilhelm Grimm.png|thumb|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in an 1843 drawing by their younger brother [[Ludwig Emil Grimm]]]]

The brothers were inspired by their law professor [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny|Friedrich von Savigny]], who awakened in them an interest in history and [[philology]], and they turned to studying [[Middle High German literature|medieval German literature]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)35ff&quot; /&gt; They shared Savigny's desire to see unification of the 200 German [[Principality|principalities]] into a single state. Through Savigny and his circle of friends—[[German Romanticism|German romantics]] such as [[Clemens Brentano]] and [[Ludwig Achim von Arnim]]—the Grimms were introduced to the ideas of [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], who thought that German literature should revert to simpler forms, which he defined as ''{{lang|de|Volkspoesie}}'' (natural poetry) as opposed to ''{{lang|de|Kunstpoesie}}'' (artistic poetry).&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(2002)7ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Zipes|2002|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brothers dedicated themselves with great enthusiasm to their studies, about which Wilhelm wrote in his autobiography, &quot;the ardor with which we studied Old German helped us overcome the spiritual depression of those days.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(2002)7&quot;&gt;qtd. in {{Harvnb|Zipes|2002|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacob was still financially responsible for his mother, brother, and younger siblings in 1805, so he accepted a post in Paris as research assistant to von Savigny. On his return to Marburg, he was forced to abandon his studies to support the family, whose poverty was so extreme that food was often scarce. He took a job with the Hessian War Commission. In a letter written to his aunt at this time, Wilhelm wrote of their circumstances, &quot;We five people eat only three portions and only once a day&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)35ff&quot;&gt;qtd. in {{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacob found full-time employment in 1808 when he was appointed court librarian to the [[Jérôme Bonaparte|King of Westphalia]] and went on to become librarian in Kassel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitt&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Ashliman |first=D.L |title=Grimm Brothers Home Page |authorlink=D. L. Ashliman|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm.html |publisher=[[University of Pittsburgh]] |accessdate=11 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After their mother's death that year, he became fully responsible for his younger siblings. He arranged and paid for his brother [[Ludwig Emil Grimm|Ludwig]]'s studies at art school and for Wilhelm's extended visit to [[Halle (Westfalen)|Halle]] to seek treatment for heart and respiratory ailments, following which Wilhelm joined Jacob as librarian in Kassel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)2ff&quot; /&gt; The brothers also began collecting folk tales at about this time, in a cursory manner and on Brentano's request. According to Jack Zipes, at this point &quot;the Grimms were unable to devote all their energies to their research and did not have a clear idea about the significance of collecting folk tales in this initial phase.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)2ff&quot; /&gt;

During their employment as librarians—which paid little but afforded them ample time for research—the brothers experienced a productive period of scholarship, publishing a number of books between 1812 and 1830.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z218ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Zipes|2000|pp=218–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1812, they published their first volume of 86 folk tales, ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausmärchen}}'', followed quickly by two volumes of German legends and a volume of early literary history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitt&quot; /&gt; They went on to publish works about [[Danish folklore|Danish]] and [[Irish mythology|Irish]] folk tales and [[Norse mythology]], while continuing to edit the German folk tale collection. These works became so widely recognized that the brothers received honorary doctorates from universities in [[Marburg]], [[Berlin]], and Breslau (now [[Wrocław]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Z218ff&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Ludwig Emil Grimm Dortchen Wild 1815.png|thumb|Ludwig Emil Grimm Dortchen Wild 1815]]
=== Göttingen ===
In 1825, Wilhelm married [[Henriette Dorothea (Dortchen) Wild]]. She came from a story-telling family and, along with her mother and sisters, she provided a number of tales to the Brothers Grimm.&lt;ref&gt;See German (wikipedia.de) page on Wild (Familie) for more info on Wilhelm's inlaws.&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob never married but continued to live in the household with Wilhelm and Dortchen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)7ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|pp=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1830, both brothers were overlooked when the post of chief librarian came available, which disappointed them greatly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z218ff&quot; /&gt; They moved the household to [[Göttingen]] in the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] where they took employment at the [[University of Göttingen]], Jacob as a professor and head librarian and Wilhelm as professor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitt&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Im Kolleg bei Jacob Grimm 1830.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Jacob Grimm lecturing (illustration by [[Ludwig Emil Grimm]], c. 1830)]]

During the next seven years, the brothers continued to research, write, and publish. In 1835, Jacob published the well-regarded ''German Mythology'' (''{{lang|de|[[Deutsche Mythologie]]}}''); Wilhelm continued to edit and prepare the third edition of ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausmärchen}}'' for publication. The two brothers taught  [[German studies]] at the university, becoming well-respected in the newly established discipline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)7ff&quot; /&gt;

In 1837, they lost their university posts after joining the rest of the [[Göttingen Seven]] in protest. The 1830s were a period of political upheaval and peasant revolt in Germany, leading to the movement for democratic reform known as [[Young Germany]].  The Grimm brothers were not directly aligned with the Young Germans, but five of their colleagues reacted against the demands of [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover]], who dissolved the parliament of [[Hanover]] in 1837 and demanded oaths of allegiance from civil servants—including professors at the University of Göttingen. For refusing to sign the oath, the seven professors were dismissed and three were deported from Hanover, including Jacob who went to Kassel. He was later joined there by Wilhelm, Dortchen, and their four children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)7ff&quot; /&gt;

The brothers were without income in 1838 and again in extreme financial difficulty, so they began what became a lifelong project: the writing of a definitive dictionary. The first volume of their ''German Dictionary'' (''{{lang|de|[[Deutsches Wörterbuch]]}}'') was not published until 1854. The brothers again depended on friends and supporters for financial assistance and influence in finding employment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)7ff&quot; /&gt;

=== Berlin and later years ===
[[File:Graves of the Brothers Grimm at Alter St.-Matthäus-Kirchhof Berlin 2012.jpg|thumb|The graves of the Brothers Grimm in [[Schöneberg]], Berlin (St. Matthäus Kirchhof Cemetery)]]

In 1840, von Savigny and Bettina von Arnim appealed successfully to [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] on behalf of the brothers who were offered posts at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]]. In addition to teaching posts, the [[German Academy of Sciences at Berlin|Academy of Sciences]] offered them stipends to continue their research. Once they had established their household in Berlin, they directed their efforts towards the work on the German dictionary and continued to publish their research. Jacob turned his attention to researching German legal traditions and the history of the German language, which was published in the late 1840s and early 1850s; meanwhile, Wilhelm began researching [[medieval literature]] while editing new editions of  ''{{lang|de|Hausmärchen}}''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z218ff&quot; /&gt;

After the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]], the brothers were elected to the civil parliament. Jacob became a prominent member of the National Assembly at [[Mainz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)7ff&quot; /&gt; Their political activities were short-lived, as their hope dwindled for a unified Germany and their disenchantment grew.  In the late 1840s, Jacob resigned his university position and saw the publication of ''The History of the German Language'' (''{{lang|de|Geschichte der deutschen Sprache}}''). Wilhelm continued at his university post until 1852. After retiring from teaching, the brothers devoted themselves to the ''German Dictionary'' for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)7ff&quot; /&gt; Wilhelm died of an infection in Berlin in 1859,&lt;ref name=&quot;NG&quot; /&gt; and Jacob became increasingly reclusive, deeply upset at his brother's death. He continued work on the dictionary until his own death in 1863. Zipes writes of the Grimm brothers' dictionary and of their very large body of work: &quot;Symbolically the last word was ''{{lang|de|Frucht}}'' (fruit).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)7ff&quot; /&gt;

== Collaborations ==

=== ''Children's and Household Tales'' ===
{{Main|Grimms' Fairy Tales}}

==== Background ====
The rise of [[romanticism]], [[Romantic nationalism]], and trends in valuing popular culture in the early 19th century revived interest in fairy tales, which had declined since their late-17th-century peak.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jean&quot; /&gt; [[Johann Karl August Musäus]] published a popular collection of tales between 1782 and 1787;&lt;ref name=&quot;Haase2008&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Haase|2008|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Grimms aided the revival with their folklore collection, built on the conviction that a national identity could be found in popular culture and with the common folk (''{{lang|de|Volk}}''). They collected and published their tales as a reflection of German cultural identity. In the first collection, though, they included [[Charles Perrault]]'s tales, published in Paris in 1697 and written for the [[salon (gathering)|literary salons]] of an aristocratic French audience. Scholar Lydie Jean says that Perrault created a myth that his tales came from the common people and reflected existing folklore to justify including them—even though many of them were original.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jean&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Arthur Rackham Little Red Riding Hood+.jpg|thumb|left|The Grimms defined &quot;[[Little Red Riding Hood]]&quot;, shown here in an illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]], as representative of a uniquely German tale although it existed in various versions and regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Txxxviff&quot; /&gt;]]

The brothers were directly influenced by Brentano and von Arnim, who edited and adapted the folk songs of ''{{lang|de|[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]}}'' (''The Boy's Magic Horn'' or [[cornucopia]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Haase2008&quot; /&gt; They began the collection with the purpose of creating a scholarly treatise of traditional stories and of preserving the stories as they had been handed from generation to generation—a practice that was threatened by increased industrialization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Txxxff&quot; /&gt; [[Maria Tatar]], professor of German studies at [[Harvard University]], explains that it is precisely the handing from generation to generation and the genesis in the [[oral tradition]] that gives folk tales an important mutability. Versions of tales differ from region to region, &quot;picking up bits and pieces of local culture and lore, drawing a turn of phrase from a song or another story and fleshing out characters with features taken from the audience witnessing their performance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|pp=xxxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as Tatar explains, the Grimms appropriated stories as being uniquely German, such as &quot;[[Little Red Riding Hood]]&quot;, which had existed in many versions and regions throughout Europe, because they believed that such stories were reflections of Germanic culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Txxxviff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|pp=xxxviii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the brothers saw fragments of old religions and faiths reflected in the stories, which they thought continued to exist and survive through the telling of stories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy3ff&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Murphy|2000|pp=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Methodology ====
When Jacob returned to Marburg from Paris in 1806, their friend Brentano sought the brothers' help in adding to his collection of folk tales, at which time the brothers began to gather tales in an organized fashion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)2ff&quot; /&gt; By 1810, they had produced a manuscript collection of several dozen tales, written after inviting storytellers to their home and transcribing what they heard. These tales were heavily modified in transcription, and many had roots in previously written sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;H579&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Haase|2008|p=579}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Brentano's request, they printed and sent him copies of the 53 tales that they collected for inclusion in his third volume of ''{{lang|de|Des Knaben Wunderhorn}}''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitt&quot; /&gt; Brentano either ignored or forgot about the tales, leaving the copies in a church in [[Alsace]] where they were found in 1920 and became known as the Ölenberg manuscript. It is the earliest extant version of the Grimms' collection and has become a valuable source to scholars studying the development of the Grimms' collection from the time of its inception. The manuscript was published in 1927 and again in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zipes|2000|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brothers gained a reputation for collecting tales from peasants, although many tales came from middle-class or aristocratic acquaintances. Wilhelm's wife Dortchen Wild and her family, with their nursery maid, told the brothers some of the more well-known tales, such as &quot;[[Hansel and Gretel]]&quot; and &quot;[[Sleeping Beauty]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;J177ff&quot; /&gt; Wilhelm collected a number of tales after befriending [[August von Haxthausen]], whom he visited in 1811 in [[Westphalia]] where he heard stories from von Haxthausen's circle of friends.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)11ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|pp=11–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the storytellers were of [[Huguenot]] ancestry, telling tales of French origin such as those told to the Grimms by [[Marie Hassenpflug]], an educated woman of French Huguenot ancestry,&lt;ref name=&quot;H579&quot; /&gt; and it is probable that these informants were familiar with Perrault's ''{{lang|fr|[[Histoires ou contes du temps passé]]}}'' (''Stories from Past Times'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Jean&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Jean|2007|pp=280–282}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other tales were collected from [[Dorothea Viehmann]], the wife of a middle-class tailor and also of French descent. Despite her middle-class background, in the first English translation she was characterized as a peasant and given the name ''{{lang|de|Gammer Gretel}}''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Txxxff&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Walter Crane12.jpg|thumb|Stories such as &quot;[[Sleeping Beauty]]&quot;, shown here in a [[Walter Crane]] illustration, had been previously published and were rewritten by the Brothers Grimm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jean&quot; /&gt;]]

According to scholars such as Ruth Bottigheimer and [[Maria Tatar]], some of the tales probably originated in written form during the [[Middle ages|medieval period]] with writers such as [[Giovanni Francesco Straparola|Straparola]] and [[Boccaccio]], but were modified in the 17th century and again rewritten by the Grimms. Moreover, Tatar writes that the brothers' goal of preserving and shaping the tales as something uniquely German at a time of [[Convention of Artlenburg|French occupation]] was a form of &quot;intellectual resistance&quot; and, in so doing, they established a methodology for collecting and preserving folklore that set the model followed later by writers throughout Europe during periods of occupation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Txxxff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|pp=xxxiv–xxxviii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;B175ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bottigheimer|1982|pp=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Writing ====
From 1807 onward, the brothers added to the collection. Jacob established the framework, maintained through many iterations; from 1815 until his death, Wilhelm assumed sole responsibility for editing and rewriting the tales. He made the tales stylistically similar, added dialogue, removed pieces &quot;that might detract from a rustic tone&quot;, improved the plots, and incorporated psychological motifs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)11ff&quot; /&gt; Ronald Murphy writes in ''The Owl, the Raven and the Dove'' that the brothers—and in particular Wilhelm—also added religious and spiritual motifs to the tales. He believes that Wilhelm &quot;gleaned&quot; bits from [[Germanic paganism|old Germanic faiths]], Norse mythology, Roman and [[Greek mythology]], and biblical stories that he reshaped.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy3ff&quot; /&gt;

Over the years, Wilhelm worked extensively on the prose and expanded and added detail to the stories, to the point that many grew to twice the length they were in the earliest published editions.&lt;ref name=&quot;T(2004)xiff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|pp=xi–xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the later editions, Wilhelm polished the language to make it more enticing to a bourgeois audience, eliminated sexual elements, and added Christian elements. After 1819, he began writing for children (children were not initially considered the primary audience), adding entirely new tales or adding new elements to existing tales, elements that were often strongly didactic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)11ff&quot; /&gt;

Some changes were made in light of unfavorable reviews, particularly from those who objected that not all the tales were suitable for children because of scenes of violence and sexuality.&lt;ref name=&quot;T(1987)15ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tatar|1987|pp=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked to modify plots for many stories; for example, &quot;[[Rapunzel]]&quot; in the first edition of ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausmärchen}}'' clearly shows a sexual relationship between the prince and the girl in the tower, which he edited out in subsequent editions.&lt;ref name=&quot;T(2004)xiff&quot; /&gt; Tatar writes that morals were added (in the second edition, a king's regret was added to the scene in which his wife is to be burned at the stake) and often the characters in the tale were amended to appear more German: &quot;every [[fairy]] (''{{lang|de|Fee}}''), prince (''{{lang|de|Prinz}}'') and princess (''{{lang|de|Prinzessin}}'')—all words of French origin—was transformed into a more Teutonic-sounding enchantress (''{{lang|de|Zauberin}}'') or wise woman (''{{lang|de|weise Frau}}''), king's son (''{{lang|de|Königssohn}}''), king's daughter (''{{lang|de|Königstochter}}'').&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tatar|1987|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Themes and analysis ====
The Grimms' legacy contains legends, [[novella]]s, and folk stories, the vast majority of which were not intended as children's tales. Von Armin was deeply concerned about the content of some of the tales, such as those that showed children being eaten, and suggested that they be removed. Instead, the brothers added an introduction with cautionary advice that parents steer children toward age-appropriate stories. Despite von Armin's unease, none of the tales were eliminated from the collection, in the brothers' belief that all the tales were of value and reflected inherent cultural qualities. Furthermore, the stories were didactic in nature at a time when discipline relied on fear, according to scholar [[Linda Dégh]], who explains that tales such as &quot;[[Little Red Riding Hood]]&quot; and &quot;[[Hansel and Gretel]]&quot; were written as &quot;warning tales&quot; for children.&lt;ref name=&quot;D91ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dégh|1979|pp=91–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hansel-and-gretel-rackham.jpg|thumb|left|&quot;[[Hansel and Gretel]]&quot;, illustrated by [[Arthur Rackham]], was a &quot;warning tale&quot; for children.&lt;ref name=&quot;D91ff&quot; /&gt;]]

The stories in ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausmärchen}}'' include scenes of violence that have since been sanitized. For example, in the Grimms' original version of &quot;[[Snow White]]&quot;, the Queen is Little Snow White's mother, not her stepmother, yet even so she orders her Huntsman to kill Snow White (her biological daughter) and bring home the child's lungs and liver so that she can eat them. The story ends with the Queen mother dancing at Snow White's wedding wearing a pair of red-hot iron shoes that kill her.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes's translation of the 1812 original edition of &quot;Folk and Fairy Tales&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Another story (&quot;The Goose Girl&quot;) has a servant being stripped naked and pushed into a barrel &quot;studded with sharp nails&quot; pointing inwards and then rolled down the street.&lt;ref name=&quot;NG&quot; /&gt; The Grimms' version of &quot;[[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog Prince]]&quot; describes the princess throwing the frog against a wall instead of kissing him. To some extent, the cruelty and violence may have been a reflection of medieval culture from which the tales originated, such as scenes of witches burning, as described in &quot;[[The Six Swans]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NG&quot; /&gt;

Tales with a spinning [[motif (folkloristics)|motif]] are broadly represented in the collection. In her essay &quot;Tale Spinners: Submerged Voices in Grimms' Fairy Tales&quot;, children's literature scholar Bottigheimer explains that these stories reflect the degree to which spinning was crucial in the life of women in the 19th century and earlier. Spinning, and particularly the spinning of [[flax]], was commonly performed in the home by women. Many stories begin by describing the occupation of a main character, as in &quot;There once was a miller&quot;, yet spinning is never mentioned as an occupation, probably because the brothers did not consider it an occupation. Instead, spinning was a communal activity, frequently performed in a ''{{lang|de|Spinnstube}}'' (spinning room), a place where women most likely kept the oral traditions alive by telling stories while engaged in tedious work.&lt;ref name=&quot;B142ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bottigheimer|1982|pp=142–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the stories, a woman's personality is often represented by her attitude toward spinning; a wise woman might be a spinster and Bottigheimer explains that the [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]] was the symbol of a &quot;diligent, well-ordered womanhood.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bottigheimer|1982|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some stories, such as &quot;[[Rumpelstiltskin]]&quot;, spinning is associated with a threat; in others, spinning might be avoided by a character who is either too lazy or not accustomed to spinning because of her high social status.&lt;ref name=&quot;B142ff&quot; /&gt;&lt;!-- this needs more work; or develop in the KHM article --&gt;

The tales were also criticized for being insufficiently German, which influenced the tales that the brothers included as well as their use of language. Scholars such as Heinz Rölleke say that the stories are an accurate depiction of German culture, showing &quot;rustic simplicity [and] sexual modesty.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NG&quot; /&gt; German culture is deeply rooted in the forest (''{{lang|de|wald}}''), a dark dangerous place to be avoided, most particularly the old forests with large oak trees and yet a place where Little Red Riding Hood's mother sent her daughter to deliver food to her grandmother's house.&lt;ref name=&quot;NG&quot; /&gt;&lt;!-- either something got lost here or it needs expansion --&gt;

[[File:Rumpelstiltskin-Crane1886.jpg|thumb|300px|&quot;[[Rumpelstiltskin]]&quot;, shown here in an illustrated border by [[Walter Crane]], is an example of a &quot;spinning tale&quot;.]]

Some critics such as Alistair Hauke use [[Analytical psychology|Jungian analysis]] to say that the deaths of the brothers' father and grandfather are the reason for the Grimms' tendency to idealize and excuse fathers, as well as the predominance of female villains in the tales, such as the [[wicked stepmother]] and stepsisters in &quot;Cinderella&quot;, but this disregards the fact that they were collectors, not authors of the tales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alister|Hauke|1998|pp=216–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible influence is found in stories such as &quot;[[The Twelve Brothers]]&quot;, which mirrors the brothers' family structure of several brothers facing and overcoming opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Autobiographical elements exist in some of the tales, and according to Zipes the work may have been a &quot;quest&quot; to replace the family life lost after their father died. The collection includes 41 tales about siblings, which Zipes says are representative of Jacob and Wilhelm. Many of the sibling stories follow a simple plot where the characters lose a home, work industriously at a specific task and, in the end, find a new home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|pp=39–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Editions ====
Between 1812 and 1864, ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausmärchen}}'' was published 17 times: seven of the &quot;Large edition&quot; (''{{lang|de|Große Ausgabe}}'') and ten of the &quot;Small edition&quot; (''{{lang|de|Kleine Ausgabe}}''). The Large editions contained all the tales collected to date, extensive annotations, and scholarly notes written by the brothers; the Small editions had only 50 tales and were intended for children. Jacob and Wilhelm's younger brother [[Ludwig Emil Grimm|Emil Grimm]] illustrated the Small editions, adding Christian symbolism to the drawings, such as depicting Cinderella's mother as an angel, and adding a Bible to the bedside table of Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z218ff&quot; /&gt;

The first volume was published in 1812 with 86 folk tales,&lt;ref name=&quot;J177ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Joosen|2006|pp=177–179}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a second volume with 70 additional tales was published late in 1814 (dated 1815 on the title page); together, the two volumes and their 156 tales are considered the first of the Large (annotated) editions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michaelis-Jena&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(2000)276ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Zipes|2000|pp=276–278}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second expanded edition with 170 tales was published in 1819, followed in 1822 by a volume of scholarly commentary and annotations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitt&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;T(1987)15ff&quot; /&gt; Five more Large editions were published in 1837, 1840, 1843, 1850, and 1857. The seventh and final edition of 1857 contained 211 tales—200 numbered folk tales and eleven legends.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitt&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;T(1987)15ff&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(2000)276ff&quot; /&gt;

In Germany, ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausmärchen}}'' was also released in a &quot;popular poster-sized ''{{lang|de|Bilderbogen}}'' (broadsides)&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(2000)276ff&quot; /&gt; format and in single story formats for the more popular tales, such as &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;. The stories were often added to collections by other authors without respect to copyright as the tales became a focus of interest for children's book illustrators,&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(2000)276ff&quot; /&gt; with well-known artists such as [[Arthur Rackham]], [[Walter Crane]], and [[Edmund Dulac]] illustrating the tales. A popular edition that sold well was released in the mid-19th century and included elaborate [[etching]]s by [[George Cruikshank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haase|2008|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- redo again here --&gt; At the deaths of the brothers, the copyright went to Hermann Grimm (Wilhelm's son) who continued the practice of printing the volumes in expensive and complete editions. However, the copyright lapsed after 1893 and various publishers began to print the stories in many formats and editions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(2000)276ff&quot; /&gt; In the 21st century, ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausmärchen}}'' is a universally recognized text, commonly called ''Grimms' Fairy Tales'' in English. Jacob and Wilhelm's collection of stories has been translated to more than 160 languages with 120 different editions of the text available for sale in the US alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;NG&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=O'Neill |first=Thomas |title=Guardians of the Fairy Tale: The Brothers Grimm |url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/grimm/article.html |work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |accessdate=18 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323164919/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/grimm/article.html |archive-date=23 March 2012 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philology ===
[[File:Pied Piper2.jpg|thumb|300px|left|''{{lang|de|[[Deutsche Sagen]]}}'' (''German Legends'') included stories such as &quot;[[Pied Piper of Hamelin]]&quot;, shown here in an illustration by [[Kate Greenaway]].]]
While at the [[University of Marburg]], the brothers came to see culture as tied to language and regarded the purest cultural expression in the [[grammar]] of a language. They moved away from Brentano's practice—and that of the other romanticists—who frequently changed original oral styles of folk tale to a more literary style, which the brothers considered artificial. They thought that the style of the people (the ''{{lang|de|volk}}'') reflected a natural and divinely inspired poetry (''{{lang|de|naturpoesie}}'') as opposed to the ''{{lang|de|kunstpoesie}}'' (art poetry), which they saw as artificially constructed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)32ff&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;D84ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dégh|1979|pp=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; As literary historians and scholars, they delved into the origins of stories and attempted to retrieve them from the oral tradition without loss of the original traits of oral language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)32ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|pp=32–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brothers strongly believed that the dream of national unity and independence relied on a full knowledge of the cultural past that was reflected in folklore.&lt;ref name=&quot;D84ff&quot; /&gt; They worked to discover and crystallize a kind of Germanness in the stories that they collected, because they believed that folklore contained kernels of ancient mythologies and beliefs crucial to understanding the essence of German culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Txxxff&quot; /&gt; By examining culture from a philological point of view, they sought to establish connections between German law and culture and local beliefs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)32ff&quot; /&gt;

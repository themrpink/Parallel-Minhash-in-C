The room Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa is dedicated to General Dalla Chiesa. It contains photos of some of the main bosses of the Mafia placed side by side with those in the legal system who fought organized crime.

Local guides also offer tours through the CIDMA.

===Gorges of the Dragon===
[[File:Gole del drago.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Gorges of the Dragon]]
Along the road that connects Corleone with [[Ficuzza]], following the old railway line connecting Palermo to [[San Carlo (Chiusa Sclafani)|San Carlo]] (a hamlet of [[Chiusa Sclafani]]) (now the bike path), is an old bridge where the Frattina River streams between the limestone rocks. The erosive action of water has produced [[karst]] topography over time forming chasms, reels and small waterfalls where the abundant water first disappears and then reappears in the boulders and lush vegetation. Of considerable size are the &quot;pots of the Giants&quot;, i.e. cylindrical and deep holes where the water takes on a swirling pattern. Old mulberry trees, oranges, pomegranates, and figs are living testimony of the site where a mill once stood. In the section where the slope is gentler, clear water pools have formed allowing visitors to bathe surrounded by bracken, maidenhair ferns, willows and elms, in the company of tortoise, fish, and colorful dragonflies. The walls that enclose the slopes are clad in rock plants of great botanical interest such as wood spurge, cabbage mountain, the carnation, and capers. Among the crevices of the rock shelter are pigeons, jackdaws, and birds of prey such as kestrels and the peregrine falcon. Tours take visitors up to the top of the gorge where the Frattina River continues to flow, in a more gentle manner, down to the Belice.

===Due Rocche Waterfall===
Within the territory of Corleone, a short walk from the historic center of the city, is the &quot;Natural Park of the cascade of two fortresses.&quot; After going through a series of narrow streets in the district of San Giuliano visitors come to the front of a small church dedicated to Our Lady of precisely two fortresses. To the left of this church winds a path that leads between the poplars, willows, and elms to the falls. Comfortably seated on the ancient square blocks in the shade of mulberry trees, nuts and frassinisi visitors have an unimpeded view of the waterfall. The flow of the water in the river has formed a large puddle among rocks through its erosive action. The canyon contains eroded, yellow-green [[glauconite|glauconitic]] rocks occupied by vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;(From ''Corleone SottoSopra'')&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corleone in literature and film==
The name of the town was used as the adopted surname of the title character in [[Mario Puzo]]'s book and [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s film ''[[The Godfather]]''. In the novel, [[Vito Corleone|Vito Andolini]] emigrates from the village of Corleone. In the cinematic release of ''[[The Godfather, Part II]]'', young Vito, shy and unable to speak English, cannot respond when asked for his proper name, and is given the surname Corleone by an immigration official at [[Ellis Island]]. Throughout the [[The Godfather|film series]], various members of the [[Corleone family]] visit the town. In the films, the towns of [[Savoca]] and [[Forza d'Agrò]] were used as locations for those scenes set in Corleone. [[Michael Corleone]] is played by [[Al Pacino]], whose real-life maternal grandparents were Corleonese.

The adaptation of the town's name into the name of a criminal gang leader in ''[[The Godfather]]'' is however predated by [[Graham Greene]]'s 1938 novel ''[[Brighton Rock (novel)|Brighton Rock]]'', which was made into a popular film in 1947. The leading character crosses the rival gang leader &quot;Colleoni&quot; in the English seaside town of Brighton.

{{Italian cuisine}}

'''Sicilian cuisine''' is the style of cooking on the island of [[Sicily]]. It shows traces of all cultures that have existed on the island of Sicily over the last two millennia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umass.edu/journal/sicilyprogram/sicilianfoodhistory.html Sicilian food history] umass.edu&lt;/ref&gt; Although its cuisine has a lot in common with [[Italian cuisine]], Sicilian food also has [[Greek cuisine|Greek]], [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]], [[French cuisine|French]] and [[Arab cuisine|Arab]] influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tesorichicago.com/the-influences-ingredients-of-sicilian-cuisine/|title=The Influences &amp; Ingredients of Sicilian Cuisine - Tesori|date=2016-07-19|work=Tesori|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sicilian cook [[Mithaecus]], born during 5th century BC, is credited with having brought knowledge of Sicilian gastronomy to [[Greece]]:&lt;ref&gt;Dalby (2003), p. 220; Hill and Wilkins (1996), pp. 144-148.&lt;/ref&gt; his cookbook was the first in Greek, therefore he was the earliest cookbook author in any language whose name is known.

==History==
[[Arab]] influences on Sicilian cuisine trace to the [[Emirate of Sicily|Arab domination of Sicily]] in the 10th and 11th centuries, &lt;ref name=&quot;Piras, 423&quot;&gt;Piras, 423.&lt;/ref&gt; and include the use of [[apricot]]s, [[sugar]], [[citrus]], sweet [[melon]]s, [[rice]], [[saffron]], [[raisin]]s, [[nutmeg]], [[clove]], [[Black pepper|pepper]], [[pine nut]]s and [[cinnamon]]. [[Normans]] influences are also found, such as in the fondness for [[meat]] dishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.etnasicilytouring.com/en/sicily/territory-custom/219-a-brief-history-of-sicilian-cuisine.html|title=A Brief History of Sicilian Cuisine|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jews|Jewish]] community, who lived in the island, also left their mark on the Sicilian cuisine, they were responsible for introducing garlic fried in olive oil into the sauce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-08-06|title=Storia della Cucina Siciliana: un'arte unica al mondo, fatta di gusto e tradizione|url=https://www.siciliafan.it/cucina-siciliana/|access-date=2020-09-10|website=Siciliafan|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the [[Spain cuisine|Spanish]] introduced [[Columbian Exchange|numerous items from the New World]], including [[chocolate|cocoa]], [[maize]], [[Bell pepper|peppers]], [[Turkey (food)|turkey]], and [[tomato]]es, along with other [[produce]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Piras, 423&quot; /&gt;  [[Catania]], on the east coast, was initially [[Magna Græcia|settled by Greek colonists]],  who left a preference for [[Fish (food)|fish]], [[olive]]s, [[Vicia faba|broad beans]], [[pistachio|pistachios]] , and fresh vegetables. Much of the island's cuisine encourages the use of fresh vegetables such as [[eggplant]], [[Bell pepper|peppers]], and tomatoes, and fish such as [[tuna]], [[sea bream]], [[European seabass|sea bass]], [[cuttlefish]], and [[swordfish]]. In [[Trapani]] in the extreme western corner of the island, [[North African cuisine|North African]] influences are clear in the use of [[couscous]].

==Dishes==
{{see also|List of Sicilian dishes}}

===Starters===
The starters (called ''[[antipasti]]'') are an important aspect of Sicilian cuisine. Common Sicilian starters include [[caponata]] and gatò di patate (a kind of potato and cheese pie).

===Soups===
[[Maccu]] is a Sicilian [[soup]] and foodstuff prepared with [[Vicia faba|fava beans]] as a primary ingredient.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helstosky&quot;&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pk63U0ppWYAC&amp;pg=PA7 | title=Food Culture in the Mediterranean | publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group | author=Helstosky, Carol | year=2009 | pages=7 | isbn=0313346267}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Peasant foods|peasant food]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont0000rile | url-access=registration | title=The Oxford Companion to Italian Food | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Riley, Gillian | year=2007 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont0000rile/page/501 501] | isbn=0198606176}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[staple food|staple]]  that dates back to [[ancient history]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Helstosky&quot;/&gt; ''Maccu di San Giuseppe'' ([[English language|English]]: maccu of St. Joseph) is a traditional Sicilian dish that consists of various ingredients and maccu.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clarkson&quot;&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KOzYAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA262 | title=Food History Almanac | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield | author=Clarkson, Janet | year=2013 | pages=262 | isbn=144222715X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dish may be prepared on [[Saint Joseph's Day]] in Sicily, to clear out pantries and allow room for the spring's new crops of vegetables.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clarkson&quot;/&gt;

===Pasta===
Sicily is the oldest Italian and Western location on record where [[pasta]]  worked into long and thin form was part of the local cuisine. This dates back to around the 12th century, as attested by the [[Tabula Rogeriana]] of [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]], reporting some traditions about the [[Sicilian kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Spaghetti#cite note-2]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Spaghetti ai ricci (spaghetti prepared with sea urchin), [[pasta con le sarde]] (with sardines) and [[pasta alla Norma]] (a specialty that originated in Catania) are the most popular pasta dishes that are typically Sicilian. [[Cannelloni]] is another common dish. Another popular dish in eastern Sicily is pasta with [[capuliato]].

===Main dish===
After the pasta, the typical Sicilian menu includes a second or main dish (''secondi'') based on meat or fish. Main dishes based on seafood are [[couscous|couscous al pesce]] and Pesce spada alla ghiotta (Swordfish).

===Desserts and sweets===
{{see also|List of Italian desserts|List of Italian dishes#Desserts and pastry}}
Sweets are another specialty.  Examples include: [[frutta martorana]], [[pignolata|Pignolata of Messina]], [[buccellato]], [[cannoli]], [[granita]], [[cassata siciliana]] and the [[Crocetta of Caltanissetta]], a sweet that disappeared and was rediscovered in 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlCaltanissetta riscopre le Crocette&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url =http://tcsnews.tv/news/8469/Caltanissetta-riscopre-le-crocette| title =Caltanissetta riscopre le &quot;Crocette&quot;| date =2014-08-26| language =it| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140924042203/http://tcsnews.tv/news/8469/Caltanissetta-riscopre-le-crocette| archivedate =2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candy in Sicily was heavily influenced by the Arab candymakers in the 9th century, and Sicilian candy has preserved more of that influence than almost any other place in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Richardson |first=Tim H. |title=Sweets: A History of Candy |publisher=Bloomsbury USA |year=2002 |isbn=1-58234-229-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/sweets00timr/page/362 362–364] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/sweets00timr/page/362 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marzipan fruits may have been invented at the [[Convent of Eloise at Martorana]] in the 14th century.  In the 17th and 18th centuries, many Sicilian monasteries produced candies and pastries, some with sexual or fertility themes.  The only surviving convent to follow this tradition is the Monastery of the [[Virgins of Palermo]], which makes breast-shaped cakes in honor of St [[Agatha of Sicily]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Cassata 2.jpg|thumb|[[Cassata]]s are popular and traditional Sicilian [[dessert]]s.|alt=A round, decorated cake|left]]
Traditional sugar statues, called ''pupa di cena'', are still made, although now featuring modern celebrities or culture figures.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Granita brioche.JPG|right|thumb|An almond [[granita]] with brioche|alt=A frozen white dessert in a clear glass, next to a piece of bread]]
Granita is particularly famous and well known. It is a semi-frozen dessert of sugar, water, and flavorings originally from the island, and is commonly associated with [[Messina]] or [[Catania]], even though there is no evident proof that it hails from any particular Sicilian city. Related to [[sorbet]] and [[italian ice]], in most of Sicily it has a coarser, more crystalline texture. Food writer [[Jeffrey Steingarten]] says that &quot;the desired texture seems to vary from city to city&quot; on the island; on the west coast and in [[Palermo]], it is at its chunkiest, and in the east it is nearly as smooth as [[sorbet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steingarten, Jeffrey|title=The Man Who Ate Everything|chapter=The Mother of All Ice Cream|pages=361&amp;ndash;380|year=1997|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=0-375-70202-4}} The chapter is an essay first published in June 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; This is largely the result of different freezing techniques: the smoother types are produced in a [[ice cream maker|gelato machine]], while the coarser varieties are frozen with only occasional agitation, then scraped or shaved to produce separated crystals.

===Fruits===
[[File:Blood oranges.jpg|thumb|right|[[Blood orange#Tarocco|Tarocco]] blood oranges|alt=A plate showing three blood oranges:  one whole, one peeled, and one sliced in half]]
Citrus fruits are a popular ingredient in Sicilian cuisine. Many were first introduced by the [[Arabs]] from the 9th to 11th centuries, but some, such as the Washington navel from [[Brazil]], have been brought to the island more recently. Examples of citrus fruits found in Sicily are :&lt;ref&gt;Piras, Claudia and Medagliani, Eugenio. ''Culinaria Italy''. Cologne: Könemann Verlagsgesellschaft mbh, 2000. pages 440-441.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Biondo comune'' - the &quot;common blonde&quot; orange
* ''Ovale'' - ripens between April and May, with a compact flesh
* ''Sanguigno comune'' - common blood orange harvested between January and April
* Washington navel - introduced from [[Brazil]] during the 1940s-1950s, grown chiefly near [[Ribera, Agrigento|Ribera]] and [[Sciacca]] and harvested from November to January
* ''Sanguinella'' - bitter orange of the [[blood orange]] variety, found in Paternò Santa Maria di Licodia, [[Palagonia]], [[Scordia]] and [[Francofonte]] during January until April
* ''[[Blood orange#Tarocco|Tarocco]]'' - high quality blood orange found in [[Catania]], [[Syracuse, Sicily|Siracusa]] and Francofonte from November to January
* ''Tarocco dal muso'' - bell shaped orange found in Francofonte
* ''[[Valencia orange|Valencia]]'' - similar to the Ovale and used often in [[confectionery]] items
* ''Moro'' - crimson colored flesh found in [[Lentini]], Scordia, and Francofonte from mid-January until the end of April
* ''Comune'' - common variety of the [[mandarin orange]]
* ''Tardivo ciaculli'' - a second variety of the mandarin orange found in Sicily
* ''Femminello'' - the lemon that makes up 80% of Sicily's lemon crop, sound in Catania, Siracusa, [[Messina]] and Palermo
* ''Monachello'' - &quot;little monk&quot;'' lemon harvested from October from March and able to withstand drought better that the Ferrminello
* ''Verdello'' - a lime that grows particularly well and is harvested from May to September

===Wines and drinks===
[[File:SIMAL limoncello jp.jpg|thumb|229x229px| [[Limoncello]] is a popular and strong lemon liqueur.|alt=A yellow liquor bottle next to the yellow packaging it is sold in]]

The drink most often served with the main meal in Sicily is [[wine]]. The soil and climate in Sicily are ideal for [[Viticulture|growing grapes]], mainly due to [[Mount Etna]], and a wine-making tradition on the island has existed since the Greeks first set up colonies on the island. Today, all Sicilian provinces produce wine and Sicilian wine produced by modern methods has established itself on the European wine market.

Sicilian [[red wine]]s have an alcoholic content of 12.5 to 13.5% and are usually drunk in the evening with roast or grilled meat. Well-known red wines include the [[Cerasuolo di Vittoria]] and the [[Nero d'Avola]], mainly those produced around Noto (Siracusa). The dry and [[white wine]]s and [[rosé]]s usually have an alcoholic content from 11.5 to 12.5% and are mainly consumed with fish, poultry and pasta dishes.  Various [[dessert wine]]s are also produced, such as the famous [[Marsala (wine)|Marsala]] and the [[Malvasia delle Lipari]].

Other typical Sicilian alcoholic drinks are the [[limoncello]], a lemon liqueur, and the [[Amaro Averna|Amaro Siciliano]], a herbal drink, which is often consumed after meals as a [[digestif|digestive]].

===Street food===
[[File:Arancini.jpg|thumb|text-top|[[Arancini]] from [[Ragusa, Sicily]]. Arancini are fried or (less often) baked rice balls usually filled with [[ragù]] (meat sauce), [[tomato sauce]], [[mozzarella]] or [[pea]]s, and then coated in bread crumbs.|right]]
Sicilians eat large quantities of street food, including the renowned [[arancini]] (a form of [[Deep frying|deep-fried]] rice [[croquette]]s).  Throughout the [[Palermo]] region are found [[pani ca meusa]] and pane con [[panelle]], while in the [[Catania]] region Cartocciate and Cipolline are very popular, and finally in the [[Messina]] region Focaccia messinese and Pitone messinese are common.

Located in the central part of the country, it has a population of 679,941 (2019).&lt;ref name=&quot;population&quot; /&gt; It is the capital of [[Łódź Voivodeship]], and is located approximately {{convert|120|km|mi}} south-west of [[Warsaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.trasa.info/wyznaczanie-trasy/lodz-warszawa|title=Łódź - Warszawa trasa i odległość na mapie • dojazd PKP, BUS, PKS|website=www.trasa.info|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's [[coat of arms]] is an example of [[canting arms|canting]], as it depicts a boat ({{lang|pl|łódź}} in [[Polish language|Polish]]), which alludes to the city's name.

Łódź was once a small settlement that first appeared in 14th-century records. Despite being granted [[city rights|town rights]] in 1423, it remained the private property of the [[Kuyavia]]n bishops and clergy until the late 18th century. The [[Second Industrial Revolution]] brought rapid growth in textile manufacturing and in population due to the inflow of migrants, notably Germans and Jews. Ever since the industrialization of the area, the city has struggled with [[Multinational state|multinationalism]] and social inequalities, which were documented in the novel ''[[The Promised Land (novel)|The Promised Land]]'' by [[Nobel Prize]]-winning author [[Władysław Reymont]]. The contrasts greatly reflected on the architecture of the city, where luxurious mansions coexisted with redbrick factories and dilapidated tenement houses.&lt;ref name=&quot;staypoland.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staypoland.com/about_lodz.htm|title=Lodz – Tourism {{!}} Tourist Information – Lodz, Poland| publisher=eTravel S.A.| date=|website=staypoland.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The industrial development and demographic surge made Łódź one of the largest cities in Poland. Under the German occupation during [[World War II]], Łódź was briefly renamed to ''Litzmannstadt'' in honour of [[Karl Litzmann]]. The city's large Jewish population was forced into a walled zone known as the [[Łódź Ghetto]], from which they were sent to German [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration and extermination camps]]. The city itself sustained insignificant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://miastol.pl/uniwersytet-dla-robotniczej-lodzi/|title=Uniwersytet dla robotniczej Łodzi|first=Marta|last=Madejska|date=2 November 2017|accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; structural damage during the war and became Poland's temporary seat of power in 1945.

Łódź experienced a sharp demographic and economic decline after 1989.

{{main|History of Łódź}}
{{see also|Timeline of Łódź}}
[[File:Lodz1577.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''Sigillum oppidi Lodzia'' - seal dating back to 1577]]
Łódź first appears in the written record in a 1332 document giving the village of ''Łodzia'' to the bishops of [[Bishopric of Włocławek|Włocławek]]. In 1423 King [[Jogaila|Władysław II Jagiełło]] officially granted [[Magdeburg rights|city rights]] to the village of ''Łódź''. From then until the 18th century the town remained a small settlement on a [[trade route]] between the provinces of [[Masovia]] and [[Silesia]]. In the 16th century the town had fewer than 800 inhabitants, mostly working on the surrounding grain farms.

With the [[Second Partition of Poland|second partition of Poland]] in 1793, Łódź became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]'s province of [[South Prussia]], and was known in German as ''Lodsch''. In 1798 the Prussians nationalised the town, and it lost its status as a town of the bishops of [[Kuyavia]]. In 1806 Łódź joined the Napoleonic [[Duchy of Warsaw]] and in 1810 it had approximately 190 inhabitants. After the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]] treaty it became part of the [[Congress Kingdom of Poland]], a [[client state]] of the [[Russian Empire]].

In the 1815 treaty, it was planned to renew the dilapidated town and with the 1816 decree by the Czar a number of German immigrants received territory deeds for them to clear the land and to build factories and housing. Their incentives for settlement included &quot;exemption from tax obligations for a period of six years, free materials to build houses, perpetual lease of land for construction, exemption from military service or duty-free transport of the immigrants’ livestock.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.centrumdialogu.com/en/niemiecka-lodz| title=German Łódź| publisher=Centrum Dialogu (Dialog Center)| access-date=2019-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1820 [[Stanisław Staszic]] aided in changing the small town into a modern industrial centre. The immigrants came to the ''Promised Land'' (''Ziemia obiecana'', the city's nickname) from all over Europe. Mostly they arrived from [[Saxony]], [[Silesia]] and [[Bohemia]], but also from countries as far away as Portugal, England, France and Ireland.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} The first [[cotton mill]] opened in 1825, and 14 years later the very first [[steam engine|steam-powered]] factory in both Poland and the Russian Empire commenced operations. In 1839, over 78% of the population was German,&lt;ref name=&quot;Muller&quot;&gt;Wiesław Puś, Stefan Pytlas. &quot;Industry and Trade in Łódź and the Eastern Markets in Partitioned Poland&quot;. In: Uwe Müller, Helga Schultz. ''National borders and economic disintegration in modern East Central Europe.'' Berlin Verlag A. Spitz. 2002. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; and German schools and churches were established.

A constant influx of workers, businessmen and craftsmen from all over Europe transformed Łódź into the main textile production centre of the mighty Russian Empire spanning from [[East-Central Europe]] all the way to [[Alaska]]. As long as the town was small, the majority of the town's population was German speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| chapter=Nachbarn, Fremde, Okkupanten: Die Deutschen im unabhängigen und besetzten Polen (1919-44)| author=Włodzimierz Borodziej| title=Als der Osten noch Heimat war| publisher=Rowohls Taschenbuch Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three groups then dominated the city's population and contributed the most to the city's development: Germans, Poles, and Jews, who started to arrive from 1848. Many of the Łódź craftspeople were [[Weaving|weavers]] from [[Upper Silesia|Upper]] and [[Lower Silesia]].

In 1850, Russia abolished the customs barrier between [[Congress Poland]] and Russia proper and therefore industry in Łódź could now develop freely with a huge Russian market not far away. Eventually the city became the second-largest city of Congress Poland. In 1865 the first railroad line opened (to [[Koluszki]], branch line of the [[Warsaw–Vienna railway]]), and soon the city had rail links with Warsaw and [[Białystok]].

One of the most important industrialists of Łódź was [[Karl Wilhelm Scheibler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weser-kurier.de/Artikel/Ratgeber/Reise/36989/Neues+Leben+in+alten+Fabriken:+Lodz+baut+auf+Kultur.html |title=Neues Leben in alten Fabriken: Lódz baut auf Kultur |publisher=Weser Kurier |language=de |date=22 September 2009 |access-date=2 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723000342/http://www.weser-kurier.de/Artikel/Ratgeber/Reise/36989/Neues%2BLeben%2Bin%2Balten%2BFabriken%3A%2BLodz%2Bbaut%2Bauf%2BKultur.html |archive-date=23 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1852 he came to Łódź and with Julius Schwarz together started buying property and building several factories. Scheibler later bought out Schwarz's share and thus became sole owner of a large business. After he died in 1881 his widow and other members of the family decided to pay homage to his memory by erecting a [[Karol Scheibler's Chapel in Łódź|chapel]], intended as a mausoleum with family crypt, in the Lutheran part of the Łódź cemetery on ''ulica Ogrodowa'' (later known as The Old Cemetery).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scheibler.org.pl/eng_fundation.htm |title=Foundation For Saving Karol Scheibler's Chapel |publisher=Scheibler.org.pl |date= |access-date=25 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111022423/http://www.scheibler.org.pl/eng_fundation.htm |archive-date=11 January 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1823 and 1873, the city's population doubled every ten years. The years 1870–1890 marked the period of most intense industrial development in the city's modern history. Many of the industrialists were of Jewish ethnicity. Łódź also soon became a major centre of the socialist movement. In 1892 a huge strike paralyzed most of the factories and manufacturing plants. According to the [[Russian Empire Census|Russian census of 1897]], in which Łódź figured as the fifth-largest city of the Russian Empire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Statesman's Year-Book |year=1898 |location=London |publisher= Macmillan and Co.|chapter= Russia: Principal Towns |page=863|title-link=Statesman's Year-Book |hdl=2027/njp.32101020157267 }}&lt;/ref&gt; out of the total population of 315,000, Jews constituted 99,000 (around 31% percent).&lt;ref&gt;[[Joshua D. Zimmerman]], ''Poles, Jews, and the Politics of Nationality'', Univ of Wisconsin Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-299-19464-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6sbr9cZyw_4C&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=population+Brest+Poles+Jews&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=HS_3SZ2-NITyzQSUtaWtBQ Google Print, p.16]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[1905 Russian Revolution|1905 Revolution]], in what became known as the [[Łódź insurrection (1905)|June Days or Łódź insurrection]], Tsarist police killed hundreds of workers.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bubczyk. ''A History of Poland in Outline''. Maria Curie-Skłodowska University Press. 2002. p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1913, the Poles constituted almost half of the population (49.7%), the German minority had fallen to 14.8%, and the Jews made up 34%, out of some 506,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Muller&quot;/&gt;

Despite the air of impending crisis preceding World War I, the city grew constantly until 1914. By that year it had become one of the most densely populated as well as one of the most polluted industrial cities in the world—{{convert|13280|PD/km2}}. A major [[Battle of Łódź (1914)|battle]] was fought near the city in late 1914, and as a result the city came under German occupation after 6 December&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Jukes, Peter Simkins, Michael Hickey, The First World War: The Eastern Front, 1914–1918, 2002, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Martin|authorlink=Martin Gilbert|title=The First World War: A Complete History|publisher=[[Henry Holt and Company]]|location=New York|date=1994|isbn=080501540X|page=107|url=https://archive.org/details/firstworldwarcom00gilb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan D. Axelrod, The Complete Idiot's Guide to World War I, 2001, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; but with [[History of Poland (1918–39)|Polish independence]] restored in November 1918 the local population liberated the city and disarmed the German troops. In the aftermath of World War I, Łódź lost approximately 40% of its inhabitants, mostly owing to draft, diseases, pollution and primarily because of the mass expulsion of the city's German population back to Germany.

===Restored Poland after the First World War===
In 1922, following the establishment of the [[Second Polish Republic]], Łódź became the capital of the [[Łódź Voivodeship]], but the period of rapid growth had ceased. The [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s and the ''[[Customs war]]'' with Germany closed western markets to Polish textiles while the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Bolshevik Revolution]] (1917) and the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] in Russia (1918–1922) put an end to the most profitable trade with the East. The city became a scene of a series of huge workers' protests and riots in the [[interwar period|interbellum]].

On 13 September 1925 a new airport, [[Łódź Władysław Reymont Airport|Lublinek Airport]], began operations on the outskirts of the city. In the interwar years Łódź continued to be a diverse and multicultural city, with the [[Polish census of 1931|1931 Polish census]] showing that the total population of roughly 604,000 included 375,000 (59%) Poles, 192,000 (32%) Jews and 54,000 (9%) Germans (determined from the main language used). By 1939, the Jewish minority had grown to well over 200,000.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon J Horwitz. ''Ghettostadt: Łódź and the Making of a Nazi City''. [[Harvard University Press]]. 2009. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Germans in the city, however, refused to sign the ''[[Volksliste]]'' and become ''[[Volksdeutsche]]''; they were deported by the General Government. The city was given the new name of &quot;Litzmannstadt&quot; after [[Karl Litzmann]], the German general who had captured it during World War I.

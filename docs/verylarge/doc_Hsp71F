===British Isles===
After the [[Luftwaffe]] had [[Rotterdam Blitz|bombed Rotterdam]], he and Marie Reidemeister fled to Britain, crossing the [[English Channel|Channel]] with other refugees in an open boat. He and Reidemeister married in 1941 after a period of being interned on the [[Isle of Man]] (Neurath was in [[Onchan]] Camp). In Britain, he and his wife set up the [[Isotype Institute]] in [[Oxford]] and he was asked to advise on, and design Isotype charts for, the intended redevelopment of the slums of [[Bilston]], near [[Wolverhampton]].

Neurath died, suddenly and unexpectedly, in December 1945. After his death, [[Marie Neurath]] continued the work of the Isotype Institute, publishing Neurath's writings posthumously, completing projects he had started and writing many children's books using the Isotype system, until her death in the 1980s.

==Ideas==

===Philosophy of science and language===
Neurath's work on [[protocol statement]]s tried to reconcile an [[Empiricism|empiricist]] concern for the grounding of knowledge in experience with the essential publicity of science. Neurath suggested that reports of experience should be understood to have a [[Grammatical person|third-person]] and hence public and impersonal character, rather than as being first person subjective pronouncements.&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; [[Bertrand Russell]] took issue with Neurath's account of protocol statements in his book ''An Inquiry Into Meaning and Truth'' (p.&amp;nbsp;139ff), on the grounds that it severed the connection to experience that is essential to an empiricist account of truth, facts and knowledge.

One of Neurath's later and most important{{according to whom|date=December 2016}} works, ''Physicalism'', completely transformed the nature of the logical positivist discussion of the program of unifying the sciences. Neurath delineates and explains his points of agreement with the general principles of the positivist program and its conceptual bases:
* the construction of a universal system which would comprehend all of the knowledge furnished by the various sciences, and
* the absolute rejection of [[metaphysics]], in the sense of any propositions not translatable into verifiable scientific sentences.
He then rejects the positivist treatment of language in general and, in particular, some of [[Wittgenstein]]'s early fundamental ideas.

First, Neurath rejects isomorphism between language and reality as useless metaphysical speculation, which would call for explaining how words and sentences could represent things in the external world. Instead, Neurath proposed that language and reality coincide—that reality consists in simply the totality of previously verified sentences in the language, and &quot;truth&quot; of a sentence is about its relationship to the totality of already verified sentences. If a sentence fails to &quot;concord&quot; (or cohere) with the totality of already verified sentences, then either it should be considered false, or some of that totality's propositions must be modified somehow. He thus views truth as internal [[coherence theory of truth|coherence]] of linguistic assertions, rather than anything to do with facts or other entities in the world. Moreover, the criterion of verification is to be applied to the system as a whole (see [[semantic holism]]) and not to single sentences. Such ideas profoundly shaped the ''holistic [[verificationism]]'' of [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]. Quine's book ''[[Word and Object]]'' (p.&amp;nbsp;3f) made famous Neurath's analogy which compares the holistic nature of language and consequently scientific verification with the construction of a boat which is already at sea (cf. [[Ship of Theseus]]):

{{Quote|We are like sailors who on the open sea must reconstruct their ship but are never able to start afresh from the bottom. Where a beam is taken away a new one must at once be put there, and for this the rest of the ship is used as support. In this way, by using the old beams and driftwood the ship can be shaped entirely anew, but only by gradual reconstruction.}}

[[Keith Stanovich]] discusses this metaphor in context of [[memes]] and [[memeplexes]] and refers to this metaphor as a &quot;[[Neurathian bootstrap]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stanovich, Keith E. (2004-05-15). The Robot's Rebellion: Finding Meaning in the Age of Darwin (1 ed.). University Of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-77089-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neurath also rejected the notion that science should be reconstructed in terms of sense data, because perceptual experiences are too subjective to constitute a valid foundation for the formal reconstruction of science. Thus, the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] language that most positivists were still emphasizing was to be replaced by the language of mathematical physics. This would allow for the required objective formulations because it is based on spatio-temporal coordinates. Such a ''physicalistic'' approach to the sciences would facilitate the elimination of every residual element of metaphysics because it would permit them to be reduced to a system of assertions relative to physical facts.

&quot;Finally, Neurath suggested that since language itself is a physical system, because it is made up of an ordered succession of sounds or symbols, it is capable of describing its own structure without contradiction.&quot;{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

These ideas helped form the foundation of the sort of [[physicalism]] which remains the dominant position{{weasel inline|date=September 2016}} in metaphysics and especially the [[philosophy of mind]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Economics===
In economics, Neurath was notable for his advocacy of ideas like &quot;[[Calculation in kind|in-kind]]&quot; economic accounting in place of monetary accounting. In the 1920s, he also advocated ''Vollsozialisierung'', that is &quot;complete&quot; rather than merely partial &quot;[[Socialization (economics)|socialization]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neill, &quot;Socialist Calculation and Environmental Valuation: Money, Markets and Ecology,&quot; Science &amp; Society, LXVI/1 (Spring 2002); Joan Martinez-Alier and Klaus Schlupmann, Ecological Economics: Energy, Environment, and Society (1987), 212-218.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he advocated changes to the economic system that were more radical than those of the mainstream Social-Democratic parties of Germany and Austria. In the 1920s, Neurath debated these matters with leading Social Democratic theoreticians (such as [[Karl Kautsky]], who insisted that money is necessary in a socialist economy). While serving as a government economist during the war, Neurath had observed that &quot;As a result of the war, in-kind calculus was applied more often and more systematically than before.... war was fought with ammunition and with the supply of food, not with money&quot; i.e. that goods were [[Commensurability (economics)|incommensurable]]. This convinced Neurath of the feasibility of economic planning in terms of amounts of goods and services, without use of money.&lt;ref&gt;Günther Chaloupek, &quot;Otto Neurath's Concepts of Socialization and Economic Calculation and his Socialist Critics&quot;(2006), at www.chaloupek.eu/work/NeurathFin.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Otto Neurath, ed. T. Uebel and R. S. Cohen, Economic Writings (2004), 304.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these ideas, [[Ludwig von Mises]] wrote his famous essay of 1920, &quot;Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/econcalc.asp |title=Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth by Ludwig von Mises |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |date= |accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.radicalphilosophy.com/article/in-partial-praise-of-a-positivist|author=John O'Neill|title=In partial praise of a positivist: The work of Otto Neurath|journal=Radical Philosophy|date=Nov-Dec 1995|accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To convert from capitalism to socialism, many have argued the best route is market socialism{{who?|date=November 2020}}. Though many, including early 20th century Austrian economist Otto Neurath believed it was ‘war socialism’ that would come into effect after capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Desai |first1=Meghnad |title=Marx's Revenge |date=2002 |publisher=Verso |pages=190–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Neurath, war economies showed advantages in speed of decision and execution, optimal distribution of means relative to (military) goals, and no-nonsense evaluation and utilization of inventiveness. Two disadvantages which he perceived as resulting from centralized decision-making were a reduction in productivity and a loss of the benefits of simple economic exchanges; but he thought that the reduction in productivity could be mitigated by means of &quot;scientific&quot; techniques based on analysis of work-flows etc. as advocated by [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]. Neurath believed that socio-economic theory and scientific methods could be applied together in contemporary practice.

Neurath's view on socioeconomic development was similar to the [[materialist conception of history]] first elaborated in [[classical Marxism]], in which technology and the state of epistemology come into conflict with social organization. In particular, Neurath, influenced also by [[James George Frazer]], associated the rise of scientific thinking and empiricism / positivism with the rise of socialism, both of which were coming into conflict with older modes of epistemology such as theology (which was allied with [[idealist]] philosophy), the latter of which served reactionary purposes. However, Neurath followed Frazer in claiming that primitive magic closely resembled modern technology, implying an [[instrumentalism|instrumentalist]] interpretation of both.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |pages = 225–6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 978-0-226-40336-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurath claimed that magic was [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] and therefore [[disenchantment]] could never be complete in a scientific age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 227 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 978-0-226-40336-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents of the scientific view of the world recognize no authority other than science and reject all forms of metaphysics. Under the socialist phase of history, Neurath predicted that the scientific worldview would become the dominant mode of thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/dspace/bitstream/1808/9325/1/auslegung.v16.n02.175-189.pdf |title= Otto Neurath: Marxist member of the Vienna Circle |last1= Jacobs|first1= Straun|last2= Otto |first2= Karl-Heinz |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate= September 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
Year '''408 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Tribunate of Iullus, Ahala and Cossus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 346 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 408 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
=== By place ===

==== Persian Empire ====
* King [[Darius II]] of [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]] decides to continue the war against [[Athens]] and give support to the [[Sparta]]ns. His wife, [[Parysatis]], persuades him to appoint his younger son, [[Cyrus the Younger|Cyrus]], as [[satrap]] (governor) of [[Lydia]], [[Phrygia]], and [[Cappadocia]] and commander in chief of the [[Achaemenian]] forces in [[Asia Minor]] in place of [[Tissaphernes]].
* Tissaphernes' influence is limited to the satrapy of [[Caria]]. Darius II also gives Cyrus funds to re-create the Spartan fleet and sends him to [[Sardis]] with instructions to increase Persian support for Sparta. Cyrus begins to collect an army of mercenaries (including Greeks) for his own ends.

==== Greece ====
* [[Alcibiades]] enters [[Athens]] in triumph after an absence of 7 years. He leads the religious procession from Athens to [[Eleusis]], thus atoning for his alleged impiety in [[415 BC]] when he was held to have joined in [[Profanity|profaning]] the [[Sacred Mysteries]]. Alcibiades is appointed commander-in-chief with [[autocratic]] powers and leaves for [[Samos]] to rejoin his fleet.
* The Spartan admiral [[Lysander]] arrives at [[Ephesus]] in autumn and builds up a great fleet with help from the new Persian satrap, Cyrus.
* At the Panhellenic gathering at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], the philosopher [[Gorgias]] speaks out against the Spartan alliance with Persia.

=== By topic ===

==== Literature ====
* [[Euripides]]' plays ''[[Orestes (play)|Orestes]]'' and ''[[The Phoenician Women]]'' are performed. Euripides then leaves [[Athens]] in dissatisfaction and travels to the court of [[Archelaus I of Macedon]] at the King's invitation.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]], Greek astronomer, mathematician, physician, scholar and adherent of [[Pythagoras]] (d. c. [[355 BC]])

She is considered by scholars&lt;ref&gt;Nilsen, Helge Normann. &quot;American Women's Literature in the Twentieth Century: A Survey of Some Feminist Trends,&quot; ''American Studies in Scandinavia,'' Vol. 22, 1990, pp. 27-29; University of Trondheim&lt;/ref&gt; to have been a forerunner of American 20th-century [[feminist]] authors of [[Southern United States|Southern]] or Catholic background, such as [[Zelda Fitzgerald]], and is one of the most frequently read and recognized writers of [[Louisiana Creole people|Louisiana Creole]] heritage.

Of maternal French and paternal Irish descent, Chopin was born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. She married and moved with her husband to [[New Orleans]]. They later lived in the country in [[Cloutierville, Louisiana]]. From 1892 to 1895, Chopin wrote short stories for both children and adults that were published in such national magazines as ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[The Century Magazine]]'', and ''[[The Youth's Companion]].'' Her stories aroused controversy because of her subjects and her approach; they were condemned as immoral by some critics.

Her major works were two short story collections: ''Bayou Folk'' (1894) and ''A Night in Acadie'' (1897). Her important short stories included &quot;[[Désirée's Baby]]&quot; (1893), a tale of [[miscegenation]] in [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] Louisiana,&lt;ref name=norton&gt;{{cite book|title=The Literature of the American South: A Norton Anthology|author=William L.

Chopin also wrote two novels: ''At Fault'' (1890) and ''[[The Awakening (Chopin novel)|The Awakening]]'' (1899), which are set in [[New Orleans]] and [[Grand Isle, Louisiana|Grand Isle]], respectively. The characters in her stories are usually residents of [[Louisiana]], and many are Creoles of various ethnic or racial backgrounds. Many of her works are set in [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]] in north-central Louisiana, a region where she lived.

Within a decade of her death, Chopin was widely recognized as one of the leading writers of her time.&lt;ref name=Pattee&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred Lewis Pattee|title=A History of American Literature Since 1870|publisher= Harvard University Press|page= 364}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915, [[Fred Lewis Pattee]] wrote, &quot;some of [Chopin's] work is equal to the best that has been produced in France or even in America. [She displayed] what may be described as a native aptitude for narration amounting almost to genius.&quot;&lt;ref name=Pattee/&gt;

== Life ==
[[File:Kate Chopin and children New Orleans 1877.jpg|right|thumb|Chopin and her children in New Orleans, 1877]]
Chopin was born Katherine O'Flaherty in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]. Her father, Thomas O’Flaherty, was a successful businessman who had immigrated to the United States from [[Galway, Ireland]]. Her mother, Eliza Faris, was his second wife, and a well-connected member of the ethnic French community in St. Louis as the daughter of Athénaïse Charleville, a [[Louisiana Creole people|Louisiana creole]] of [[French Canadian]] descent. Some of Chopin's ancestors were among the first European (French) inhabitants of [[Dauphin Island, Alabama]].&lt;ref name=&quot;litland&quot;/&gt;

Kate was the third of five children, but her sisters died in infancy and her half-brothers (from her father's first marriage) died in their early twenties. They were reared Roman Catholic, in the French and Irish traditions. She also became an avid reader of [[fairy tales]], poetry, and religious [[allegories]], as well as classic and contemporary novels. She graduated from Sacred Heart Convent in St. Louis in 1868.&lt;ref name=&quot;litland&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/LiterarySt.Louis|title=Literary St. Louis: Noted Authors and St. Louis Landmarks Associated With Them|publisher=Associates of St. Louis University Libraries, Inc. and Landmarks Associate of St. Louis, Inc.|year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of five, she was sent to Sacred Heart Academy where she learned how to handle her own money and make her own decisions, as the nuns intended. Upon her father's death, she was brought back home to live with her grandmother and great-grandmother, comprising three generations of women who were widowed young and never remarried. For two years she was tutored at home by her great-grandmother, Victoria (or Victoire) Charleville, who taught French, music, history, gossip and the need to look on life without fear.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion To Kate Chopin|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani00beer|url-access=limited|last=Beer|first=Janet|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=9781139001984|pages=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani00beer/page/n25 13]–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; After those two years, Kate went back to Sacred Heart Academy, which her best friend and neighbor, [[Kitty Garesche]], also attended, and where her mentor, Mary O’Meara, taught. A gifted writer of both verse and prose, O'Meara guided her student to write regularly, to judge herself critically, and to conduct herself valiantly. Nine days after Kate and Kitty's first communions in May 1861, the [[Civil war|Civil War]] came to St. Louis. During the war, Kate's half-brother died of fever, and her great-grandmother died as well. After the war ended, Kitty and her family were banished from St. Louis for supporting the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kate Chopin's Private Papers|last=Toth and Seyersted|first=Emily and Per|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0253331120|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In St. Louis, Missouri, on June 8, 1870,&lt;ref&gt;Marriage certificate between Oscar Chopin and Katie O'Flaherty accessed on ancestry.com on October 19, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; she married Oscar Chopin and settled with him in his home town of [[New Orleans]], an important port. The Chopins had six children between 1871 and 1879: in order of birth, Jean Baptiste, Oscar Charles, George Francis, Frederick, Felix Andrew, and Lélia (baptized Marie Laïza).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Biography {{!}}|url = http://www.katechopin.org/biography/|website = www.katechopin.org|access-date = December 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879, Oscar Chopin's cotton brokerage failed.

The family left the city and moved to [[Cloutierville, Louisiana|Cloutierville]], in south [[Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana|Natchitoches Parish]], to manage several small [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]] and a [[general store]]. They became active in the community, where Chopin found, in the local creole culture, much material for her future writing.

When Oscar Chopin died in 1882, he left Kate $42,000 in debt (approximately $420,000 in 2009 dollars).  According to Emily Toth, &quot;for a while the widow Kate ran his [Oscar's] business and flirted outrageously with local men; (she even engaged in a relationship with a married farmer).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;toth&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author=Toth, Emily|title=Reviews the essay &quot;The Shadows of the First Biographer: The Case of Kate Chopin&quot;|journal=Southern Review|number=26 |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Chopin worked to make her late husband's plantation and general store succeed, two years later she sold her Louisiana business.&lt;ref name=&quot;toth&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;intro&quot;/&gt;

Her mother had implored her to move back to St. Louis, which Chopin did, with her mother's financial support. Her children gradually settled into life in the bustling city, but Chopin's mother died the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| title=Short Story Criticism 'An Introduction to Kate Chopin 1851-1904'| journal=Short Story Criticism|volume=116 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chopin struggled with depression after the successive loss of her husband, her business, and her mother. Chopin's [[obstetrician]] and family friend, Dr. Frederick Kolbenheyer, suggested that she start writing, believing that it could be therapeutic for her. He understood also that writing could be a focus for her extraordinary energy, as well as a source of income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seyersted|first=Per|title=Kate Chopin: A Critical Biography|location=Baton Rouge, LA|publisher=Louisiana State UP|year=1985|isbn=978-0-8071-0678-5|url=https://archive.org/details/katechopin00pers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1890s, Chopin's short stories, articles, and translations were appearing in periodicals, including the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' newspaper, and in various literary magazines. During a period of considerable publishing of folk tales, works in dialect, and other elements of Southern folk life, she was considered a regional writer who provided [[British regional literature|local color]]. Her strong literary qualities were overlooked.&lt;ref name=kc/&gt;

In 1899, her second novel, ''[[The Awakening (Chopin novel)|The Awakening]],'' was published. Some newspaper critics reviewed the novel favorably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Kate Chopin|url = https://archive.org/details/katechopin00toth|url-access = registration|last = Toth|first = Emily|publisher = William Morrow &amp; Company, Inc.|year = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the critical reception was largely negative. The critics considered the behavior of the novel's characters, especially the women - and Chopin's general treatment of female sexuality, motherhood, and marital infidelity - to be in conflict with prevailing standards of moral conduct and therefore offensive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Kate Chopin: A Literary Life|url = https://archive.org/details/katechopinlitera0000walk|url-access = registration|last = Walker|first = Nancy|publisher = Palgrave Publishers|year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

This novel, her best-known work, is the story of a woman trapped within the confines of an oppressive society. [[Out of print]] for several decades, it was rediscovered in the 1970s, when there was a wave of new studies and appreciation of women's writings. The novel has since been reprinted and is widely available. It has been critically acclaimed for its writing quality and importance as an early [[feminist]] work of the South.&lt;ref name=kc&gt;{{cite journal| author=O'Flaherty|title=Kate Chopin, An Introduction to (1851-1904)| journal=Twentieth-Century Literary Criticism|volume=14| year= 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics suggest that such works as ''The Awakening'' were too far ahead of their time and therefore not socially embraced. Chopin herself was deeply discouraged by the lack of acceptance, but she continued to write, turning to the short story.&lt;ref name=kc/&gt; In 1900, she wrote &quot;The Gentleman from New Orleans.&quot; That same year she was listed in the first edition of ''[[Marquis Who's Who]].'' However, she never made much money from her writing, getting by on the investments she made locally in Louisiana and St. Louis of the inheritance from her mother's estate.&lt;ref name=kc/&gt;

[[File:Kate Chopin's grave.jpg|right|thumb|Kate Chopin's grave in Calvary Cemetery, St. Louis, Missouri]]
While visiting the [[St. Louis World's Fair]] on August 20, 1904, Chopin suffered a [[brain hemorrhage]]. She died two days later, at the age of 54. She was interred in [[Calvary Cemetery (St. Louis)|Calvary Cemetery]] in St. Louis.&lt;ref name=kc/&gt;

== Literary themes ==
Kate Chopin lived in a variety of locations, based on different economies and societies. These were sources of insights and observations from which she analyzed and expressed her ideas about late 19th-century Southern American society.  She was brought up by women who were primarily ethnic French. Living in areas influenced by the Louisiana Creole and Cajun cultures after she joined her husband in Louisiana, she based many of her stories and sketches on her life in Louisiana. They expressed her unusual portrayals (for the time) of women as individuals with separate wants and needs.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro&quot;/&gt;

Chopin's writing style was influenced by her admiration of the contemporary French writer [[Guy de Maupassant]], known for his short stories:

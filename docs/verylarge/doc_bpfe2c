Monasteries were important contributors to the surrounding community. They were centres of intellectual progression and education. They welcomed aspiring priests to come study and learn, allowing them even to challenge doctrine in dialogue with superiors. The earliest forms of [[musical notation]] are attributed to a monk named [[Notker of St Gall]], and was spread to musicians throughout [[Europe]] by way of the interconnected monasteries. Since monasteries offered respite for weary [[pilgrim]] travellers, monks were obligated also to care for their injuries or emotional needs. Over time, lay people started to make [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimages]] ''to'' monasteries instead of just using them as a stopover. By this time, they had sizeable libraries that attracted learned tourists. Families would donate a son in return for blessings. During the [[Plague (disease)|plague]]s, monks helped to till the fields and provide food for the sick.

A Warming House is a common part of a [[medieval]] monastery, where monks went to warm themselves. It was often the only room in the monastery where a fire was lit.

A number of distinct [[monastic order]]s developed within Roman Catholicism:
* [[Camaldolese]] monks
* [[Canons Regular of the Order of the Holy Cross]], priests and brothers, all of whom live together like monks according to the [[Rule of St. Augustine]];
* [[Hermits of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel|Carmelite hermits]] and [[Carmelites|Carmelite nuns]] (from the Ancient Observance and [[Discalced Carmelites|Discalced branch]]);
* [[Cistercians|Cistercian Order]], with monks and nuns (both of the Original Observance and of the [[Trappist]] reform);
* [[Monastic Family of Bethlehem, of the Assumption of the Virgin and of Saint Bruno|Monks and Sisters of Bethlehem]]
* [[Minim (religious order)|Order of Minims]], founded by [[Francis of Paola|St. Francis of Paola]]
* [[Order of Saint Benedict]], known as the Benedictine monks and nuns, founded by [[Benedict of Nursia|St. Benedict]] with [[Scholastica|St. Scholastica]], stresses manual labour in self-subsistent monasteries. See also: [[Cluniac Reforms]];
* [[Poor Clares|Order of Saint Claire]], best known as the Poor Clares (of all the observances);
* [[Hieronymites|Order of Saint Jerome]], inspired by [[Jerome|St. Jerome]] and [[Saint Paula|St. Paula]], known as the Hieronymite monks and nuns;
* [[Order of Saint Paul the First Hermit]], known as the Pauline Fathers;
* [[Order of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary]], also known as Sisters of the Annunciation or Annociades, founded by [[Joan of France, Duchess of Berry|St. Joan of France]];
* [[Carthusians|Order of the Carthusians]], a hermitical religious order founded by [[Bruno of Cologne|St. Bruno of Cologne]];
* [[Order of the Immaculate Conception]], also known as the Conceptionists, founded by [[Beatrice of Silva|St. Beatrice of Silva]];
* [[Order of the Most Holy Annunciation]], also known as Turchine Nuns or Blue Nuns, founded by [[Maria Vittoria De Fornari Strata|Bl. Maria Vittoria De Fornari Strata]];
* [[Bridgettines|Order of the Most Holy Savior]], known as Bridgettine nuns and monks, founded by [[Bridget of Sweden|St. Bridget of Sweden]];
* [[Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary]], known as the Visitandine nuns, founded by [[Francis de Sales|St. Francis de Sales]] and [[Jane Frances de Chantal|St. Jane Frances Fremyot de Chantal]];
* [[Passionist]]s
* [[Premonstratensian|Premonstratensian canons]] (&quot;The White Canons&quot;)
* [[Tironensian|Tironensian monks]] (&quot;The Grey Monks&quot;)
* [[Valliscaulian|Valliscaulian monks]]

While in English most [[mendicant Order]]s use the monastic terms of monastery or [[priory]], in the [[Romance languages|Latin languages]], the term used by the [[friar]]s for their houses is [[convent]], from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''conventus'', e.g.,&amp;nbsp;({{lang-it|convento}}) or ({{lang-fr|couvent}}), meaning &quot;gathering place&quot;. The [[Franciscans]] rarely use the term &quot;monastery&quot; at present, preferring to call their house a &quot;friary&quot;.

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Eastern Catholic Church]], both monks and nuns follow a similar [[ascetic]] discipline, and even their [[religious habit]] is the same (though nuns wear an extra veil, called the ''[[apostolnik]]''). Unlike [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] monasticism, the Orthodox do not have separate religious orders, but a single monastic form throughout the Orthodox Church. Monastics, male or female, live away from the world, in order to pray for the world.

Monasteries vary from the very large to the very small. There are three types of monastic houses in the Orthodox Church:
* A [[cenobium]] is a monastic community where monks live together, work together, and pray together, following the directions of an abbot and the elder monks. The concept of the cenobitic life is that when many men (or women) live together in a monastic context, like rocks with sharp edges, their &quot;sharpness&quot; becomes worn away and they become smooth and polished. The largest monasteries can hold many thousands of monks and are called ''[[lavra]]s''. In the cenobium the [[daily office]], work and meals are all done in common.
* A [[skete]] is a small monastic establishment that usually consist of one elder and two or three disciples. In the skete most prayer and work are done in private, coming together on Sundays and [[feast day]]s. Thus, skete life has elements of both solitude and community, and for this reason is called the &quot;middle way&quot;.
* A [[hermit]] is a monk who practises asceticism but lives in solitude rather than in a monastic community.

One of the great centres of Orthodox monasticism is [[Mount Athos]] in [[Greece]], which, like the [[Vatican State]], is self-governing. It is located on an isolated peninsula approximately {{convert|20|mi|km}} long and {{convert|5|mi|km}} wide, and is administered by the heads of the 20 monasteries. Today the population of the Holy Mountain is around 2,200 men only and can only be visited by men with special permission granted by both the Greek government and the government of the Holy Mountain itself.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] churches, distinguished by their [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysite]] beliefs, consist of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] (whose Patriarch is considered first among equals for the following churches), [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]], [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]], [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church|Indian Orthodox Church]], and [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] of Antioch.

The monasteries of St. Macarius (''[[Monastery of Saint Macarius the Great|Deir Abu Makaria]]'') and St. Anthony (''[[Monastery of Saint Anthony|Deir Mar Antonios]]'') are the oldest monasteries in the world and under the patronage of the Patriarch of the Coptic Orthodox Church.

===Others===
The last years of the 18th&amp;nbsp;century marked in the Christian Church the beginnings of growth of monasticism among [[Protestant]] denominations. The center of this movement was in the United States and Canada beginning with the [[Shaker]] Church, which was founded in England and then moved to the United States. In the 19th&amp;nbsp;century many of these monastic societies were founded as Utopian communities based on the monastic model in many cases. Aside from the Shakers, there were the [[Amanna]], the [[Anabaptist]]s, and others. Many did allow marriage but most had a policy of [[celibacy]] and communal life in which members shared all things communally and disavowed personal ownership.

In the 19th-century monasticism was revived in the [[Church of England]], leading to the foundation of such institutions as the [[House of the Resurrection]], [[Mirfield]] ([[Community of the Resurrection]]), [[Nashdom Abbey]] ([[Benedictine]]), [[Cleeve Priory]] ([[Community of the Glorious Ascension]]) and [[Ewell Monastery]] ([[Cistercian]]), [[Benedictine]] orders, [[Franciscan]] orders and the Orders of the Holy Cross, Order of St.&amp;nbsp;Helena. Other Protestant Christian denominations also engage in monasticism, particularly Lutherans in Europe and North America. For example, the Benedictine order of the Holy Cross at St Augustine's House in Michigan is a Lutheran order of monks and there are Lutheran religious communities in Sweden and Germany. In the 1960s, experimental monastic groups were formed in which both men and women were members of the same house and also were permitted to be married and have children—these were operated on a communal form.

==Hinduism==

===Advaita Vedanta===
[[File:Vidyashankara Temple at Shringeri.jpg|thumb|Hindu [[matha]], Vidyasankara Temple]]
From the times of the [[Vedas]] (from circa 1700 BC), people following monastic ways of life have existed in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. In what is now called Hinduism, monks have existed for a long time, and with them, their respective monasteries, called [[matha]]s. Important among them are the chatur-amnaya mathas established by [[Adi Shankara]] which formed the nodal centres of under whose guidance the ancient Order of Advaitin monks were re-organised under ten names of the [[Dashanami Sampradaya]]. 
* [[Ramakrishna Math]]

===Sri Vaishnava===
[[File:Parakala Mutt - as it stands today.jpg|thumb|Parakala Mutt - as it stands today]]
[[Ramanuja]] heralded a new era in the world of Hinduism by reviving the lost faith in it and gave a firm doctrinal basis to the [[Vishishtadvaita]] philosophy which had existed since time immemorial. He ensured the establishment of a number of [[matha]]s of his [[Sri Vaishnava]] creed at different important centres of pilgrimage. 
*[[Emar Matha]] at [[Puri]]
*Sriranga Narayana Jeeyar Mutt at [[Srirangam]]
*Tirumala Pedda Jeeyangar Mutt at [[Tirupati]]
Later on, other famous Sri Vaishnava theologians and religious heads established various important mathas such as
*Vanamamalai Mutt
*[[Parakala Mutt]]
*[[Ahobila Mutt]]

===Nimbarka Vaishnava===
[[File:Ukhra Nimbarka Peeth Mahanta Asthal.JPG|thumb|Ukhra Nimbarka Peeth Mahanta Asthal]]
[[Nimbarka Sampradaya]] of Nimbarkacharya is popular in North, West and East India and has several important Mathas.
*Nimbarakacharya Peeth at Salemabad, [[Rajasthan]]
*Kathia Baba ka Sthaan at [[Vrindavan]]
*[[Ukhra Mahanta Asthal]] at [[Ukhra]] in [[West Bengal]]
*Howrah Nimbarka Ashram at [[Howrah]]

===Dvaita Vedanta===
[[Ashta matha]] (eight monasteries) of [[Udupi]] were founded by [[Madhvacharya]] (Madhwa acharya), a [[dwaitha]] philosopher.

==Jainism==
[[Jainism]], founded by [[Mahavira]] circa 570 BC, had its own monasteries since 5th century BC.

==Sufism==
Islam discourages monasticism, which is referred to in the Quran as &quot;an invention&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:2002.02.0002:sura=57:verse=27|title=The Quran, sura 57, verse 27|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=57&amp;verse=27|title=The Quranic Arabic Corpus - Translation|website=corpus.quran.com|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term &quot;Sufi&quot; is applied to Muslim mystics who, as a means of achieving union with Allah, adopted ascetic practices including wearing a garment made of coarse wool called &quot;sf&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Melchert, &quot;Origins and Early Sufism&quot;, in Lloyd Ridgeon, ed., ''Cambridge Companion to Sufism'' (2014), 3-23.

      <text bytes="3731" xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], a '''Hurwitz polynomial''', named after [[Adolf Hurwitz]], is a [[polynomial]]  whose [[root of a function|roots]] ([[zero (complex analysis)|zeros]]) are located in the left half-plane of the [[complex number|complex plane]] or on the imaginary  axis, that is, the real part of every root is zero or negative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuo&quot;&gt;{{cite book

A polynomial function ''P''(''s'') of a [[complex variable]] ''s'' is said to be Hurwitz if the following conditions are satisfied:

:1. ''P''(''s'') is real when ''s'' is real.
 
:2. The roots of ''P''(''s'') have real parts which are zero or negative.

Hurwitz polynomials are important in [[control system|control systems theory]], because they represent the [[Characteristic polynomial#Characteristic equation|characteristic equations]] of [[Stability theory|stable]] [[linear system]]s.  Whether a polynomial is Hurwitz can be determined by solving the equation to find the roots, or from the coefficients without solving the equation by the [[Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion]].

== Examples ==

A simple example of a Hurwitz polynomial is the following:

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + 2x + 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The only real solution is &amp;minus;1, as it factors to

:&lt;math&gt;(x+1)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

In general, all second-degree polynomials with positive coefficients are Hurwitz.
This follows directly from the [[quadratic formula]]:
:&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac\ }}{2a}.&lt;/math&gt;
where, if the discriminant ''b^2-4ac'' is less than zero, then the polynomial will have two complex-conjugate solutions with real part ''-b/2a'', which is negative for positive ''a'' and ''b''.
If it is equal to zero, there will be two coinciding real solutions at ''-b/2a''. Finally, if the discriminant is greater than zero, there will be two real negative solutions,
because &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{b^2-4ac}&lt;b &lt;/math&gt; for positive ''a'', ''b'' and ''c''.

== Properties ==

For a polynomial to be Hurwitz, it is necessary but not sufficient that all of its coefficients be positive (except for second-degree polynomials, which also doesn't imply sufficiency).  A necessary and sufficient condition that a polynomial is Hurwitz is that it passes the [[Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion]].  A given polynomial can be efficiently tested to be Hurwitz or not by using the Routh continued fraction expansion technique.

The [[International Financial Reporting Standards|IFRS]] (International Financial Reporting Standards) committee developed the International Accounting System 38 with the purpose of prescribing the accounting treatment for intangible assets. IAS 38.8 defines an intangible asset as an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance. An asset is a resource that is controlled by the entity as the result of past events (for example purchase or self-creation) and from which future economic benefits (inflows of cash or other benefits) are expected.

==Classification==
Intellectual capital is normally classified as follows:

*'''[[Human capital]]''', the value that the employees of a business provide through the application of [[skill]]s, [[know-how]] and [[expertise]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Maddocks&quot;&gt;Maddocks, J. &amp; Beaney, M. 2002. See the invisible and intangible. Knowledge Management, March, 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Human capital is an organization's combined human capability for solving business problems and exploiting its [[Intellectual Property|intellectual property]]. Human capital is inherent in people and cannot be owned by an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Younis |first1=Raghda |title=Human Resource Management Practices and the perceived Hospital performance The mediating role of Intellectual Capital |journal=المجلة العلمیة للإقتصاد و التجارة |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=559–586 |doi=10.21608/jsec.2018.39411 |url=http://journals.ekb.eg/article_39411_0cbdae46d450c1785dac0b6e7bc2c5cd.pdf|year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, human capital can leave an organization when people leave, and if the [[management]] has failed to provide a setting where others can pick up their know-how. Human capital also encompasses how effectively an organization uses its people resources as measured by [[creativity]] and [[Innovation]].
*'''[[Structural capital]]''', the supportive non-physical infrastructure, processes and [[database]]s of the organisation that enable human capital to function.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maddocks&quot; /&gt; Structural capital includes processes, [[patent]]s, and [[trademark]]s, as well as the organization's image, [[Organizational structure|organization]], [[information system]], and proprietary [[software]] and databases. Because of its diverse components, structural capital can be classified further into organization, process and innovation capital. [[Organizational capital]] includes the organization philosophy and systems for leveraging the organization's capability. Process capital includes the techniques, procedures, and programs that implement and enhance the delivery of goods and services. Innovation capital includes [[intellectual property]] such as patents, trademarks and [[copyright]]s, and intangible assets.&lt;ref&gt;Edvinsson, L. &amp; Malone, M.S. 1997. Intellectual Capital: Realizing your Company’s True Value by Finding Its Hidden Roots. New York: Harper Business.&lt;/ref&gt; Intellectual properties are protected commercial rights such as patents, [[trade secret]]s, copyrights and trademarks. Intangible assets are all of the other talents and theory by which an organization is run.
*'''[[Relational capital]]''', consisting of such elements as [[customer]] relationships, supplier relationships, trademarks and [[trade name]]s (which have value only by virtue of customer relationships) [[License|licences]], and [[Franchising|franchises]]. The notion that customer capital is separate from human and structural capital indicates its central importance to an organization's worth.&lt;ref&gt;Skyrme, D.J. 1998. Valuing Knowledge: Is it Worth it?&lt;/ref&gt; The value of the relationships a business maintains with its customers and suppliers is also referred as goodwill, but often poorly booked in corporate accounts, because of accounting rules.&lt;ref&gt;Marc M. Levey and Steven C. Wrappe:  Transfer Pricing, Rules, Compliance and Controversy, 2nd edition; CCH, Wolters Kluwer, 2007, p.129-139]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
The intangible nature of many knowledge products and processes, in combination with the increasing importance of their value in corporate balance sheets leads to a growing interest in management of intellectual capital. Creating, shaping and updating the stock of intellectual capital requires the formulation of a strategic vision, which blends together all three dimensions of intellectual capital (Human, Structural and Relational Capital) within the organisational context through exploration and exploitation, measurement and disclosure.&lt;ref&gt;Khavandkar, Ehsan, Theodorakopoulos, Nicholas, Hart, Mark, &amp; Preston, Jude (2016).

Brown (Eds.), Human Resource Management, Innovation and Performance (pp. 213–231). London: Palgrave Macmillan UK.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the organisational value of intellectual capital is developed via an ongoing and emergent process focused on the capability to leverage, develop and change the dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Subramaniam, Mohan, &amp; Youndt, Mark (2005). [http://amj.aom.org/content/48/3/450.abstract The Influence of Intellectual Capital on the Types of Innovative Capabilities]. Academy of Management Journal, 48(3), 450–463.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intellectual capital management|The management of intellectual capital]] is conceptualised as occurring via a multiple stage process, governed by an evolutionary logic. Intellectual capital management is defined as a cycle of four inter-related sets of practices: Strategic Alignment, Exploration and Exploitation, Measurement, and Reporting of intellectual capital.&lt;ref&gt;Khavand Kar, Jalil &amp; Khavandkar, Ehsan (2013), &quot;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BnseAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA387&amp;pg=PA387#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Intellectual Capital: Management, Development and Measurement Models]&quot;, 3rd edition, Ministry of Science, Research and Technology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The recognizing and managing of intellectual capital within organizations is not always that evident and straightforward. For example, what IC means differ from organization to organization; thus requiring a contextual understanding [[Tyskbo, Daniel. &quot;Managers’ views on how intellectual capital is recognized and managed in practice.&quot; Journal of Intellectual Capital (2019).|(Tyskbo, 2019).]]

Merges, Peter S. Menell, Mark A. Lemley: Intellectual Property in the Technological Age, 3rd ed.; Aspen 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;intellectual capital&quot; is not yet common; other terms include &quot;intangible assets&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew J. Sherman: Harvesting Intangible Assets: Uncover Hidden Revenue in Your Company's Intellectual Property; AMACOM. Oct. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; While corporate reports often stress the value and the know-how of its staff, this crucial asset cannot be considered property. A term &quot;[[Workforce]]-in-place&quot; can be used as a category when companies with their staff are purchased.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Smith and Russell Parr (2005): Intellectual Property. Valuation, Exploitation, and Infringement Damages, 4th edition; Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; Without that category, most of the excess purchase price over the tangible [[book value]] would just appear as [[goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]].

==Measurement==
An intellectual capital audit is an [[audit]] of a company's intellectual capital to monitor and oversee the intellectual capital of a firm in order to capitalize on intellectual capital already within the company, and to identify opportunities to increase the intellectual capital of the company.&lt;ref&gt;Brooking, A. (1996) Intellectual Capital, Core Assets for the Third Millennium Enterprise, International Thomson Business Press, London, pp.86&lt;/ref&gt;

Early methods of intellectual capital measurement include the balanced scorecard framework (BSC), the Skandia Navigator, and the Intangible Asset Monitor. Additionally, the Value-Added Intellectual Coefficient method (VAIC) was introduced in 1993 to measure the ''value'' created by intellectual capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gianpaolo Iazzolino|last2=Domenico Laise|date=2013-10-21|title=Value added intellectual coefficient (VAIC): A methodological and critical review|journal=Journal of Intellectual Capital|volume=14|issue=4|pages=547–563|doi=10.1108/jic-12-2012-0107|issn=1469-1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intellectual capital and a Stock Returns Growth ==
Changes in stock returns are primarily determined by external factors such as inflation, exchange rates, and socioeconomic conditions. [[Intellectual capital]] does not affect a company stock's current earnings. [[Intellectual capital]] contributes to a stock's return growth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.652.9595&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf] The Impact of Intellectual Capital on a Firm’s Stock Return | Evidence from Indonesia |

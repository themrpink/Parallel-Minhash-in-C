== Toponymy ==
The name &quot;Islamabad&quot; means &quot;City of Islam&quot;. It is derived from two words: ''Islam'' and ''abad''. Islam refers to the religion of [[Islam]], Pakistan's [[state religion]], and [[-abad]] is a [[Persian language|Persian]] suffix meaning &quot;cultivated place&quot;, indicating an inhabited place or city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adrian Room&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Adrian Room|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1JIPAN-eJ4C&amp;pg=PA177|title=Placenames of the World|date=13 December 2005|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|isbn=978-0786422487|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a history book by [[Muhammad Ismail Zabeeh]], Abdur Rehman Amritsari − a school teacher from [[Arif Wala Tehsil|Arifwala]] − proposed the name of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Capital Talk|date=6 February 2020|title=Islamabad Ka Naam Kisney Rakha Tha, Qaum Be-Khabr Kyun?|trans-title=Who Named Islamabad, Why Is the Nation Unaware?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5BsT0rX5Zs&amp;t=0m27s|access-date=26 June 2020|website=YouTube|language=ur|type=Video|via=Geo News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally in writing, Islamabad is colloquially contracted to &quot;ISB&quot;. Such usage originated in [[SMS language]], in part due to the [[IATA location identifier]] for [[Islamabad International Airport]].

{{Main|History of Islamabad}}

===Early history===
[[Islamabad Capital Territory]], located on the [[Pothohar Plateau]] of the northern [[Punjab region]], is considered one of the earliest sites of human settlement in Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pakistan net&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Islamabad history |publisher=Pakistan.net |url=http://www.pakistan.net/cities/islamabad/islamabad.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630100106/http://www.pakistan.net/cities/islamabad/islamabad.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest Stone Age artefacts in the world have been found on the plateau, dating from 100,000 to 500,000 years ago. Rudimentary stones recovered from the terraces of the [[Soan River]] testify to the endeavours of early man in the [[glacial period|inter-glacial]] period.&lt;ref name=&quot;defence&quot;/&gt; Items of pottery and utensils dating back to prehistory have been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/metropolitan/16-sacred-rocks-of-islamabad-hs-10 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20090807034256/http://beta.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/metropolitan/16-sacred-rocks-of-islamabad-hs-10 |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 August 2009 |title=Sacred rocks of Islamabad |work=Dawn |date=2 August 2009 |access-date=27 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavations by Dr. Abdul Ghafoor Lone reveal evidence of a prehistoric culture in the area.  Relics and human skulls have been found dating back to 5000 BCE that indicate the region was home to [[Neolithic]] peoples who settled on the banks of the [[Swaan River]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Pakistan net&quot;/&gt; and who later developed small communities in the region around 3000 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;defence&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Potohar|author=Pakistan Defence Ministry|url=http://www.defence.pk/forums/military-history/3753-potohar.html|access-date=29 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106014747/http://www.defence.pk/forums/military-history/3753-potohar.html|archive-date=6 November 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Background on the Potohar Plateau |author=LEAD |url=http://casestudies.lead.org/index.php?cscid=71 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720192217/http://casestudies.lead.org/index.php?cscid=71 |archive-date=20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Indus Valley Civilization]] flourished in the region between the 23rd and 18th centuries BCE.

{{Main|Developments in Islamabad}}
When Pakistan gained independence in 1947, the southern port city of Karachi was its provisional national capital. In 1958, a commission was constituted to select a suitable site near Rawalpindi for the national capital with particular emphasis on location, climate, logistics, and defence requirements, along with other attributes. After extensive study, research, and a thorough review of potential sites, the commission recommended the area northeast of Rawalpindi in 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Orient&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;M.

===Architecture===
{{See also|List of tallest buildings in Islamabad}}
Islamabad's architecture is a combination of modernity and old [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] and regional traditions. The [[Saudi-Pak Tower]] is an example of the integration of modern architecture with traditional styles. The beige-coloured edifice is trimmed with blue tile works in Islamic tradition, and is one of Islamabad's tallest buildings. Other examples of intertwined Islamic and modern architecture include [[Pakistan Monument]] and [[Faisal Mosque]]. Other notable structures are: Secretariat Complex designed by [[Gio Ponti]], Prime Minister's secretariat based on [[Mughal architecture]] and the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]] by [[Edward Durell Stone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;M.

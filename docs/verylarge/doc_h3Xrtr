'''Unconventional superconductors''' are materials that display [[superconductivity]] which does not conform to either the conventional [[BCS theory]] or [[Nikolay Bogolyubov]]'s theory or its extensions.

==History==
The superconducting properties of  CeCu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a type of
[[heavy fermion material]], were reported in 1979 by [[Frank Steglich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.43.1892|title=Superconductivity in the Presence of Strong Pauli Paramagnetism: CeCu2Si2|year=1979|last1=Steglich|first1=F.|first2=J.|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=43|pages=1892–1896|last2=Aarts|last3=Bredl|first3=C.D.|last4=Lieke|first4=W.|last5=Meschede|first5=D.|last6=Franz|first6=W.|last7=Schäfer|first7=H.|bibcode=1979PhRvL..43.1892S|issue=25|hdl=1887/81461|hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For a long time it was believed that CeCu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a singlet d-wave superconductor but since the mid 2010s, this notion has been strongly contested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kittaka|first1=Shunichiro|last2=Aoki|first2=Yuya|last3=Shimura|first3=Yasuyuki|last4=Sakakibara|first4=Toshiro|last5=Seiro|first5=Silvia|last6=Geibel|first6=Christoph|last7=Steglich|first7=Frank|last8=Ikeda|first8=Hiroaki|last9=Machida|first9=Kazushige|date=2014-02-12|title=&lt;nowiki&gt;Multiband Superconductivity with Unexpected Deficiency of Nodal Quasiparticles in ${\mathrm{CeCu}}_{2}{\mathrm{Si}}_{2}$&lt;/nowiki&gt;|journal=Physical{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Review Letters|volume=112|issue=6|pages=067002|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.067002|bibcode=2014PhRvL.112f7002K|pmid=24580704|arxiv=1307.3499|s2cid=13367098}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In  the early eighties, many more unconventional, [[heavy fermion]] [[Superconductivity|superconductors]] were discovered, including UBe&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.50.1595|title=UBe_{13}: An Unconventional Actinide Superconductor|year=1983|last1=Ott|first1=H.

The first unconventional triplet superconductor, organic material (TMTSF)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, was discovered by [[Denis Jerome]] and [[Klaus Bechgaard]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1051/jphyslet:0198000410409500|title=Superconductivity in a synthetic organic conductor (TMTSF)2PF 6|year=1980|last1=Jérome|first1=D.|first2=A.|first3=M.|first4=K.|journal=Journal de Physique Lettres|volume=41|pages=95|last2=Mazaud|last3=Ribault|last4=Bechgaard|issue=4|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/jpa-00231730/file/ajp-jphyslet_1980_41_4_95_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent experimental works by [[Paul Chaikin]]'s and Michael Naughton's groups as well as theoretical analysis of their data by [[Andrei Lebed]] have firmly confirmed unconventional nature of superconducting pairing in (TMTSF)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;X (X=PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, etc.) organic materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.46.852|title=Zero-Pressure Organic Superconductor: Di-(Tetramethyltetraselenafulvalenium)-Perchlorate [(TMTSF)2ClO4]|year=1981|last1=Bechgaard|first1=Klaus|first2=Claus S.|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=46|pages=852|last2=Carneiro|last3=Olsen|first3=Malte|last4=Rasmussen|first4=Finn|last5=Jacobsen|first5=Claus|bibcode=1981PhRvL..46..852B|issue=13|url=http://orbit.dtu.dk/files/4927636/Bech.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High-temperature singlet d-wave superconductivity was discovered by [[J.G. Bednorz]] and [[Karl Alexander Müller|K.A. Müller]] in 1986, who discovered that the [[lanthanum]]-based [[cuprate superconductor|cuprate]] [[perovskite]] material LaBaCuO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  develops superconductivity  at a critical temperature (''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) of approximately 35&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin|K]] (-238 degrees [[Celsius]]). This is well above the highest critical temperature known at the time (''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 23&amp;nbsp;K) and thus the new family of materials were called [[High-temperature superconductivity|high-temperature superconductors]]. Bednorz and Müller received the [[Nobel prize]] in Physics for this discovery in 1987. Since then, many other [[High-temperature superconductivity|high-temperature superconductors]] have been synthesized.

LSCO (La&lt;sub&gt;2−''x''&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;CuO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) was discovered the same year (1986). Soon after, in January 1987, [[yttrium barium copper oxide]] (YBCO) was discovered to have a ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; of 90&amp;nbsp;K, the first material to achieve superconductivity above the boiling point of [[liquid nitrogen]] (77&amp;nbsp;K).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Superconductivity at 93 K in a new mixed-phase Yb-Ba-Cu-O compound system at ambient pressure|author = K.

In 1988 [[bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide]] (BSCCO) with ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; up to 107&amp;nbsp;K,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = A New High-''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; Oxide Superconductor without a Rare Earth Element|author1=H.

The current record critical temperature is about ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 133&amp;nbsp;K (−140&amp;nbsp;°C) at standard pressure, and somewhat higher critical temperatures can be achieved at high pressure. Nevertheless, at present it is considered unlikely that cuprate perovskite materials will achieve room-temperature superconductivity.

On the other hand, in recent years other unconventional superconductors have been discovered. These include some that do not superconduct at high temperatures, such as the [[strontium ruthenate|strontium ruthenate Sr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RuO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], but that, like the high-temperature superconductors, are unconventional in other ways (for example, the origin of the attractive force leading to the formation of [[Cooper pair]]s may be different from the one postulated in [[BCS theory]]). In addition to this, superconductors that have unusually high values of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; but that are not cuprate perovskites have been discovered. Some of them may be extreme examples of [[conventional superconductor]]s (this is suspected of [[magnesium diboride]], MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 39&amp;nbsp;K). Others display more unconventional features.

In 2008 a new class (layered [[oxypnictide]] superconductors), for example LaOFeAs, were discovered that do not include copper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Superconductivity at 43K in an iron-based layered compound LaO&lt;sub&gt;1−''x''&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;FeAs|author = Hiroki Takahashi, Kazumi Igawa, Kazunobu Arii, Yoichi Kamihara, Masahiro Hirano, Hideo Hosono|journal = Nature|volume = 453|pages = 376–378|year = 2008|doi = 10.1038/nature06972|pmid = 18432191|issue = 7193|bibcode=2008Natur.453..376T|last2 = Igawa|last3 = Arii|last4 = Kamihara|last5 = Hirano|last6 = Hosono|s2cid = 498756}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=iron-exposed-as-high-temp-superconductor |title=Iron Exposed as High-Temperature Superconductor: Scientific American |publisher=Sciam.com |date=2008-04-23 |accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/05/080528140242.htm New High-Temperature Superconductors Are Iron-based With Unusual Magnetic Properties]&lt;/ref&gt; An oxypnictide of [[samarium]] seems to have a ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; of about 43&amp;nbsp;K which is higher than predicted by [[BCS theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.3603v2 Samarium oxypnictide]&lt;/ref&gt; Tests at up to 45&amp;nbsp;[[tesla (unit)|T]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetanalog.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=208401297 High-temp superconductors pave way for 'supermagnets']{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature07058|title=Very High Field Two-band Superconductivity in LaFeAsO0.89F0.11 at very high magnetic fields|year=2008|last1=Hunte|first1=F.|first2=J.|first3=A.|first4=D.

Recently, other unconventional superconductors, not based on cuprate structure, have been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Superconductivity at 43 K in an iron-based layered compound LaO1-&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;F&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;FeAs|author = Hiroki Takahashi, Kazumi Igawa, Kazunobu Arii, Yoichi Kamihara, Masahiro Hirano, Hideo Hosono|journal = Nature|volume = 453|pages = 376–378|year = 2008|doi = 10.1038/nature06972|pmid = 18432191|issue = 7193|bibcode=2008Natur.453..376T|last2 = Igawa|last3 = Arii|last4 = Kamihara|last5 = Hirano|last6 = Hosono|s2cid = 498756}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have unusually high values of the [[critical temperature]], ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, and hence they are sometimes also called high-temperature superconductors.

==Ongoing research==
After more than twenty years of intensive research the origin of high-temperature superconductivity is still not clear, but it seems that instead of ''electron-phonon'' attraction mechanisms, as in conventional [[superconductivity]], one is dealing with genuine ''electronic'' mechanisms (e.g. by antiferromagnetic correlations), and instead of s-wave pairing, d-waves are substantial.

One goal of all this research is [[room-temperature superconductor|room-temperature superconductivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = A. Mourachkine|title = Room-Temperature Superconductivity|publisher = Cambridge International Science Publishing |arxiv=cond-mat/0606187|year = 2004|isbn=1-904602-27-4|bibcode=2006cond.mat..6187M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of how superconductivity arises in high-temperature superconductors is one of the major unsolved problems of theoretical [[condensed matter physics]] {{As of|2016|lc=on}}. The mechanism that causes the electrons in these crystals to form pairs is not known.

Despite intensive research and many promising leads, an explanation has so far eluded scientists. One reason for this is that the materials in question are generally very complex, multi-layered crystals (for example, [[BSCCO]]), making theoretical modeling difficult.

==Possible mechanism==
&lt;!-- huge overlap with High-temperature_superconductivity#Possible_mechanism --&gt;
The most controversial topic in condensed matter physics has been the mechanism for high-''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; superconductivity (HTS). There have been two representative theories on the HTS :  (See also [[Resonating valence bond theory]] )

;Weak-coupling theory: Firstly, it has been suggested that the HTS emerges by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation in a doped system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=P. Monthoux|journal=Phys. Rev. B|volume=46|year=1992|title=Weak-coupling theory of high-temperature superconductivity in the antiferromagnetically correlated copper oxides|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.46.14803|issue=22|bibcode=1992PhRvB..4614803M|last2=Balatsky|first2=A.|last3=Pines|first3=D.|pages=14803–14817|pmid=10003579|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this [[weak-coupling theory]], the pairing wave function of the HTS should have a ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;−''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry. Thus, whether the symmetry of the pairing wave function is the ''d'' symmetry or not is essential to demonstrate on the mechanism of the HTS in respect of the spin fluctuation. That is, if HTS order parameter (pairing wave function) does not have ''d'' symmetry, then a pairing mechanism related to spin fluctuation can be ruled out. The ''tunnel experiment'' (see below) seems to detect ''d'' symmetry in some HTS.

;Interlayer coupling model: Secondly, there was the [[interlayer coupling model]], according to which a layered structure consisting of BCS-type (s symmetry) superconductor can enhance the superconductivity by itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=S. Chakravarty|journal=Science|volume=261|pages=337–40|year=1993|title=Interlayer Tunneling and Gap Anisotropy in High-Temperature Superconductors|doi=10.1126/science.261.5119.337|pmid=17836845|issue=5119|bibcode=1993Sci...261..337C|last2=Sudbo|first2=A.|last3=Anderson|first3=P. W.|last4=Strong|first4=S.|s2cid=41404478|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; By introducing an additional tunneling interaction between each layer, this model successfully explained the anisotropic symmetry of the order parameter in the HTS as well as the emergence of the HTS.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Thus, in order to solve this unsettled problem, there have been numerous experiments such as photoelectron spectroscopy, NMR, specific heat measurement, etc. Unfortunately, the results were ambiguous, where some reports supported the d symmetry for the HTS but others supported the s symmetry.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} This muddy situation possibly originated from the indirect nature of the experimental evidence, as well as experimental issues such as sample quality, impurity scattering, twinning, etc.

==Previous studies on the symmetry of the HTS order parameter==
The symmetry of the HTS order parameter has been studied in [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] measurements and, more recently, by [[ARPES|angle-resolved photoemission]] and measurements of the microwave penetration depth in a HTS crystal. NMR measurements probe the local magnetic field around an atom and hence reflect the susceptibility of the material. They have been of special interest for the HTS materials because many researchers have wondered whether spin correlations might play a role in the mechanism of the HTS.

NMR measurements of the resonance frequency on [[YBCO]] indicated that electrons in the copper oxide superconductors are paired in [[singlet state|spin-singlet]] states. This indication came from the behavior of the [[Knight shift]], the frequency shift that occurs when the internal field is different from the applied field: In a normal metal, the magnetic moments of the conduction electrons in the neighborhood of the ion being probed align with the applied field and create a larger internal field. As these metals go superconducting, electrons with oppositely directed spins couple to form singlet states. In the anisotropic HTS, perhaps NMR measurements have found that the relaxation rate for copper depends on the direction of the applied static magnetic field, with the rate being higher when the static field is parallel to one of the axes in the copper oxide plane. While this observation by some group supported the d symmetry of the HTS, other groups could not observe it.

Also, by measuring the ''penetration depth'', the symmetry of the HTS order parameter can be studied. The microwave penetration depth is determined by the superfluid density responsible for screening the external field. In the s wave BCS theory, because pairs can be thermally excited across the gap Δ, the change in superfluid density per unit change in temperature goes as exponential behavior, exp(-Δ/''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''). In that case, the penetration depth also varies exponentially with temperature ''T''. If there are nodes in the energy gap as in the ''d'' symmetry HTS, electron pair can more easily be broken, the superfluid density should have a stronger temperature dependence, and the penetration depth is expected to increase as a power of T at low temperatures. If the symmetry is specially ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; then the penetration depth should vary linearly with ''T'' at low temperatures. This technique is increasingly being used to study superconductors and is limited in application largely by the quality of available single crystals.

[[Photoemission spectroscopy]] also could provide information on the HTS symmetry. By scattering photons off electrons in the crystal, one can sample the energy spectra of the electrons. Because the technique is sensitive to the angle of the emitted electrons one can determine the spectrum for different wave vectors on the Fermi surface. However, within the resolution of the [[angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy]] (ARPES), researchers could not tell whether the gap goes to zero or just gets very small. Also, ARPES are sensitive only to the magnitude and not to the sign of the gap, so it could not tell if the gap goes negative at some point. This means that ARPES cannot determine whether the HTS order parameter has the ''d'' symmetry or not.

==Junction experiment supporting the ''d-wave'' symmetry==

There was a clever experimental design to overcome the muddy situation. An experiment based on pair tunneling and flux quantization in a three-grain ring of YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (YBCO) was designed to test the symmetry of the order parameter in YBCO.
&lt;ref name=&quot;Tsuei1994&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=C. C. Tsuei|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|volume=73|year=1994|title=Pairing Symmetry and Flux Quantization in a Tricrystal Ring of Superconductin YBa2Cu3O7- delta|doi=10.1103/PHYSREVLETT.73.593|bibcode=1994PhRvL..73..593T|last2=Kirtley|first2=J.

|last8=Ketchen|first8=M. B.|issue=4|pages=593–596|pmid=10057486|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a ring consists of three YBCO crystals with specific orientations consistent with the d-wave pairing symmetry to give rise to a spontaneously generated half-integer quantum vortex at the tricrystal meeting point. Furthermore, the possibility that junction interfaces can be in the clean limit (no defects) or with maximum zig-zag disorder was taken into account in this tricrystal experiment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tsuei1994&quot; /&gt;
A proposal of studying vortices with half magnetic flux quanta in heavy-fermion superconductors in three polycrystalline configurations was reported in 1987 by V. B. Geshkenbein, A. Larkin and A. Barone in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=V. B. Geshkenbein|journal=Phys. Rev. B|volume=36|issue=1|pages=235–238|year=1987|title=Vortices with half magnetic flux quanta in ''heavy-fermion'' superconductors|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.36.235|bibcode=1987PhRvB..36..235G|last2=Larkin|first2=A.|last3=Barone|first3=A.|display-authors=etal|pmid=9942041}}&lt;/ref&gt;         

In the first tricrystal pairing symmetry experiment &lt;ref name=&quot;Tsuei1994&quot; /&gt;, the spontaneous magnetization of half flux quantum was clearly observed in YBCO, which convincingly supported the ''d-wave'' symmetry of the order parameter in YBCO. Because YBCO is [[orthorhombic]], it might inherently have an admixture of s-wave symmetry. So, by tuning their technique further, it was found that there was an admixture of s-wave symmetry in YBCO within about 3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J. R. Kirtley|journal=Nat. Phys.|volume=2|page=190|year=2006|title=Angle-resolved phase-sensitive determination of the in-plane gap symmetry in YBa2Cu3O7-delta|doi=10.1038/nphys215|issue=3|bibcode=2006NatPh...2..190K|last2=Tsuei|first2=C.

M.|last5=Harkema|first5=S.|last6=Hilgenkamp|first6=H.|s2cid=118447968|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it was demonstrated by Tsuei, Kirtley et al. that there was a pure ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; order parameter symmetry in the [[tetragonal]] Tl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ba&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=C.

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By Place===

==== Byzantine Empire ====
* [[March 25]] &amp;ndash; [[Romanos I Lekapenos|Romanos Lekapenos]], admiral (''[[droungarios]]'') of the [[Byzantine navy]], seizes the [[Boukoleon Palace]] in [[Constantinople]]. He is named ''[[Hetaireia|megas hetaireiarches]]'' (head of the [[imperial guard]]). Lekapenos consolidates his position and becomes [[regent]] of Emperor [[Constantine VII]]. He marries his 9-year-old daughter [[Helena Lekapene]] to Constantine and assumes the new title of ''[[basileopator]]'' (one of the highest offices in the [[Byzantine Empire]]).

==== Europe ====
*  [[May 24]] &amp;ndash; The nobles of [[Franconia]] and [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] elect [[Henry the Fowler]] at the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] in [[Fritzlar]] as ruler of the [[East Francia|East Frankish Kingdom]]. He recognizes the [[Stem duchy|stem duchies]] (uniting them in a German [[confederation]]) and all their sovereign privileges. Two of the four most influential duchies, [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]] and [[Duchy of Swabia|Swabia]], do not accept his rule. Henry fortifies [[Magdeburg]] against the [[Principality of Hungary|Magyars]].
* Summer &amp;ndash; [[Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria]] (&quot;the Bad&quot;), is elected as [[anti-king]] by the East-Frankish nobles in opposition to Henry I. [[Burchard II, Duke of Swabia|Burchard II]], duke of Swabia, submits to Henry's rule — allowing him to retain administrative control over his duchy. After an absence of nearly 15 years, the Magyars raid Bavaria and Northern [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]] again, sacking the [[Po Valley]] (see [[Hungarian invasions of Europe]]).
* [[September 14]] &amp;ndash; [[Battle of Islandbridge]]: High King [[Niall Glúndub]] is killed while leading an Irish coalition against the [[Kingdom of Dublin|Dublin]]-based [[Vikings]] of [[Uí Ímair]], led by King [[Sitric Cáech]].

==== Britain ====
* Lady [[Ælfwynn]] of the Mercians is brought to the court of her uncle, King [[Edward the Elder]], and deprived of her authority in [[Mercia]]. Edward formally annexes the kingdom, ending independent Mercian rule.
* [[Ragnall ua Ímair]], a Viking chief from [[Ireland]], takes control of the Norse [[Scandinavian York|Kingdom of York]] (also referred to as '''Jórvik''') and the English-ruled Earldom of [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]].

==== Africa ====
* [[April 5]] &amp;ndash; The [[Fatimid Caliphate]] of [[Ifriqiya]] (modern-day [[Tunisia]]) launch the second [[Fatimid invasion of Egypt (919–921)]] in an attempt to seize [[Egypt in the Middle Ages|Egypt]] from its [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] rulers. The expedition fails and the Fatimids will be forced to retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Meynier (2010). ''L'Algérie cœur du maghreb classique. De l'ouverture islamo-arabe au repli (658-1518)''.

==== China ====
* [[Battle of Langshan Jiang]]: The [[Wuyue]] navy (500 dragon ships) under Prince [[Qian Yuanguan]] who is preparing an invasion to attack the [[Wu (Ten Kingdoms)|Wu]] Kingdom, defeats the naval forces of General Peng Yanzhang on the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]]. Due to the use of [[flamethrower]] ships (using [[gunpowder]] to ignite [[Gasoline|petrol]], like [[Greek fire]]) Qian Yuanguan manages to destroy 400 enemy ships and captures 7,000 prisoners. 

==== Mesoamerica ====
* The [[Ancestral Puebloans]], living in the [[Four Corners]], begin construction at [[Pueblo Bonito]], in modern-day [[New Mexico]]'s [[Chaco Culture National Historical Park|Chaco Canyon]] (approximate date).

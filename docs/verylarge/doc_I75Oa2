=== 1721: Temperature compensated pendulums ===

During the 18th and 19th century, the [[pendulum clock]]'s role as the most accurate timekeeper motivated much practical research into improving pendulums. It was found that a major source of error was that the pendulum rod expanded and contracted with changes in ambient temperature, changing the period of swing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milham1945&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beckett1874&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The accuracy of gravity measurements made with pendulums was limited by the difficulty of finding the location of their [[Center of percussion|center of oscillation]]. Huygens had discovered in 1673 that a pendulum has the same period when hung from its center of oscillation as when hung from its pivot,&lt;ref name=&quot;HuygensReciprocity&quot; /&gt; and the distance between the two points was equal to the length of a simple gravity pendulum of the same period.&lt;ref name=&quot;HuygensCompound&quot; /&gt;  In 1818 British Captain [[Henry Kater]] invented the reversible [[Kater's pendulum]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Kater1818&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

=== 1851: Foucault pendulum ===
{{Main|Foucault pendulum}}
In 1851, [[Jean Bernard Léon Foucault]] showed that the plane of oscillation of a pendulum, like a [[gyroscope]], tends to stay constant regardless of the motion of the pivot, and that this could be used to demonstrate the  [[rotation of the Earth]]. He suspended a pendulum free to swing in two dimensions (later named the [[Foucault pendulum]]) from the dome of the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon]] in Paris. The length of the cord was {{convert|67|m|abbr =on}}. Once the pendulum was set in motion, the plane of swing was observed to [[precess]] or rotate 360° clockwise in about 32 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In quality clocks the bob is made as heavy as the suspension can support and the movement can drive, since this improves the regulation of the clock (see [[#Accuracy of pendulums as timekeepers|Accuracy]] below). A common weight for [[seconds pendulum]] bobs is {{convert|15|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_78S_w3EBmAC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=matthys+%22common+bob+size Mattheys, 2004, p. 13]&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of hanging from a [[wikt:pivot|pivot]], clock pendulums are usually supported by a short straight [[spring (device)|spring]] ''&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;(d)&lt;/span&gt;'' of flexible metal ribbon. This avoids the friction and 'play' caused by a pivot, and the slight bending force of the spring merely adds to the pendulum's [[restoring force]]. The highest precision clocks have pivots of 'knife' blades resting on agate plates. The impulses to keep the pendulum swinging are provided by an arm hanging behind the pendulum called the ''crutch'', ''&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;(e)&lt;/span&gt;'', which ends in a ''fork'', ''&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;(f)&lt;/span&gt;'' whose prongs embrace the pendulum rod. The crutch is pushed back and forth by the clock's [[escapement]], ''&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;(g,h)&lt;/span&gt;''.

Each time the pendulum swings through its centre position, it releases one tooth of the ''escape wheel'' ''&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;(g)&lt;/span&gt;''. The force of the clock's [[mainspring]] or a driving weight hanging from a pulley, transmitted through the clock's [[Wheel train (horology)|gear train]], causes the wheel to turn, and a tooth presses against one of the pallets ''&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;(h)&lt;/span&gt;'', giving the pendulum a short push. The clock's wheels, geared to the escape wheel, move forward a fixed amount with each pendulum swing, advancing the clock's hands at a steady rate.

The pendulum always has a means of adjusting the period, usually by an adjustment nut ''&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;(c)&lt;/span&gt;'' under the bob which moves it up or down on the rod.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milham1945&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lx0v2dhnZo8C&amp;pg=PA91 Matthys 2004], p.91-92&lt;/ref&gt;  Moving the bob up decreases the pendulum's length, causing the pendulum to swing faster and the clock to gain time. Some precision clocks have a small auxiliary adjustment weight on a threaded shaft on the bob, to allow finer adjustment. Some [[Turret clock|tower clocks]] and precision clocks use a tray attached near to the midpoint of the pendulum rod, to which small weights can be added or removed. This effectively shifts the centre of oscillation and allows the rate to be adjusted without stopping the clock.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OvQ3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA48 Beckett 1874], p.48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The pendulum must be suspended from a rigid support.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milham1945&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OvQ3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA43 Beckett 1874], p.43&lt;/ref&gt;  During operation, any elasticity will allow tiny imperceptible swaying motions of the support, which disturbs the clock's period, resulting in error. Pendulum clocks should be attached firmly to a sturdy wall.

The most common pendulum length in quality clocks, which is always used in [[grandfather clock]]s, is the [[seconds pendulum]], about {{convert|1|m|in|abbr=off}} long.   In [[mantel clock]]s, half-second pendulums, {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, or shorter, are used.

=== Temperature compensation ===
[[File:Howard astronomical regulator clock.png|thumb|130px|Mercury pendulum in Howard astronomical regulator clock, 1887]]
The largest source of error in early pendulums was slight changes in length due to thermal expansion and contraction of the pendulum rod with changes in ambient temperature.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lx0v2dhnZo8C&amp;pg=PA3&amp;sig=yYIWqaccL-YA2Mrigw4sFw5k-tk Matthys 2004], p.3&lt;/ref&gt;  This was discovered when people noticed that pendulum clocks ran slower in summer, by as much as a minute per week&lt;ref name=&quot;Beckett1874&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BritannicaCompensation&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

Picard then mentions that temperature slightly effects the length of this pendulum:  ''&quot;Il est vray que cette longueur ne s'est pas toûjours trouvées si précise, &amp; qu'il a semblé qu'elle devoit estre toûjours un peu accourcie en Hyver, &amp; allongée en esté; mais c'est seulement de la dixieme partie d'une ligne … &quot;''  (It is true that this length [of the pendulum] is not always found [to be] so precise, and that it seemed that it should be always a bit shortened in winter, and lengthened in summer; but it is only by a tenth part of a line [1 ''[[ligne]]'' (line) = 2.2558 mm] … )&lt;/ref&gt;  A pendulum with a steel rod will expand by about 11.3 [[parts per million]] (ppm) with each degree Celsius increase, causing it to lose about 0.27 seconds per day for every degree Celsius increase in temperature, or 9 seconds per day for a {{convert|33|C-change|abbr=on}} change. Wood rods expand less, losing only about 6 seconds per day for a {{convert|33|C-change|abbr=on}} change, which is why quality clocks often had wooden pendulum rods. The wood had to be varnished to prevent water vapor from getting in, because changes in humidity also affected the length.

==== Mercury pendulum ====
The first device to compensate for this error was the mercury pendulum, invented by [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Graham1726&quot; /&gt; in 1721.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milham1945&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BritannicaCompensation&quot; /&gt;  The liquid metal [[mercury (element)|mercury]] expands in volume with temperature. In a mercury pendulum, the pendulum's weight (bob) is a container of mercury. With a temperature rise, the pendulum rod gets longer, but the mercury also expands and its surface level rises slightly in the container, moving its [[centre of mass]] closer to the pendulum pivot. By using the correct height of mercury in the container these two effects will cancel, leaving the pendulum's centre of mass, and its period, unchanged with temperature. Its main disadvantage was that when the temperature changed, the rod would come to the new temperature quickly but the mass of mercury might take a day or two to reach the new temperature, causing the rate to deviate during that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;MatthysCompensation&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lx0v2dhnZo8C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;sig=yYIWqaccL-YA2Mrigw4sFw5k-tk Matthys 2004], p.7-12&lt;/ref&gt;  To improve thermal accommodation several thin containers were often used, made of metal. Mercury pendulums were the standard used in precision regulator clocks into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Milham 1945, p.335&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gridiron pendulum ====
[[Image:BanjoPendulum.png|thumb|Diagram of a gridiron pendulum&lt;br&gt;A: exterior schematic&lt;br&gt;B: normal temperature&lt;br&gt;C: higher temperature]]
{{Main|Gridiron pendulum}}
The most widely used compensated pendulum was the [[gridiron pendulum]], invented in 1726 by [[John Harrison]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Milham1945&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BritannicaCompensation&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MatthysCompensation&quot; /&gt;  This consists of alternating rods of two different metals, one with lower thermal expansion ([[Coefficient of thermal expansion|CTE]]), [[steel]], and one with higher thermal expansion, [[zinc]] or [[brass]]. The rods are connected by a frame, as shown in the drawing at the right, so that an increase in length of the zinc rods pushes the bob up, shortening the pendulum.   With a temperature increase, the low expansion steel rods make the pendulum longer, while the high expansion zinc rods make it shorter. By making the rods of the correct lengths, the greater expansion of the zinc cancels out the expansion of the steel rods which have a greater combined length, and the pendulum stays the same length with temperature.

Zinc-steel gridiron pendulums are made with 5 rods, but the thermal expansion of brass is closer to steel, so brass-steel gridirons usually require 9 rods. Gridiron pendulums adjust to temperature changes faster than mercury pendulums, but scientists found that friction of the rods sliding in their holes in the frame caused gridiron pendulums to adjust in a series of tiny jumps.&lt;ref name=&quot;MatthysCompensation&quot; /&gt; In high precision clocks this caused the clock's rate to change suddenly with each jump. Later it was found that zinc is subject to [[Creep (deformation)|creep]]. For these reasons mercury pendulums were used in the highest precision clocks, but gridirons were used in quality regulator clocks.

Gridiron pendulums became so associated with good quality that, to this day, many ordinary clock pendulums have decorative 'fake' gridirons that don't actually have any temperature compensation function.

==== Invar and fused quartz ====
Around 1900, low thermal expansion materials were developed which could be used as pendulum rods in order to make elaborate temperature compensation unnecessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milham1945&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BritannicaCompensation&quot; /&gt; These were only used in a few of the highest precision clocks before the pendulum became obsolete as a time standard. In 1896 [[Charles Édouard Guillaume]] invented the [[nickel]] [[steel]] [[alloy]] [[Invar]]. This has a [[coefficient of thermal expansion|CTE]] of around 0.5 µin/(in·°F), resulting in pendulum temperature errors over 71&amp;nbsp;°F of only 1.3 seconds per day, and this residual error could be compensated to zero with a few centimeters of aluminium under the pendulum bob&lt;ref name=&quot;Marrison&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MatthysCompensation&quot; /&gt; (this can be seen in the Riefler clock image above). Invar pendulums were first used in 1898 in the [[Riefler escapement|Riefler regulator clock]]&lt;ref&gt;Milham 1945, p.331-332&lt;/ref&gt;  which achieved accuracy of 15 milliseconds per day. Suspension springs of [[Elinvar]] were used to eliminate temperature variation of the spring's [[restoring force]] on the pendulum. Later [[fused quartz]] was used which had even lower CTE. These materials are the choice for modern high accuracy pendulums.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lx0v2dhnZo8C&amp;pg=PA153&amp;sig=yYIWqaccL-YA2Mrigw4sFw5k-tk Matthys 2004], Part 3, p.153-179&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Atmospheric pressure ===
The effect of the surrounding air on a moving pendulum is complex and requires [[fluid mechanics]] to calculate precisely, but for most purposes its influence on the period can be accounted for by three effects:&lt;ref name=&quot;BritannicaP540&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TL4KAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA13# Poynting &amp; Thompson, 1907, p.13-14]&lt;/ref&gt;
* By [[Archimedes' principle]] the effective [[weight]] of the [[bob (physics)|bob]] is reduced by the buoyancy of the air it displaces, while the [[mass]] ([[inertia]]) remains the same, reducing the pendulum's acceleration during its swing and increasing the period. This depends on the air pressure and the density of the pendulum, but not its shape.
* The pendulum carries an amount of air with it as it swings, and the mass of this air increases the inertia of the pendulum, again reducing the acceleration and increasing the period. This depends on both its density and shape.
* Viscous [[air resistance]] slows the pendulum's velocity. This has a negligible effect on the period, but dissipates energy, reducing the amplitude. This reduces the pendulum's [[Q factor]], requiring a stronger drive force from the clock's mechanism to keep it moving, which causes increased disturbance to the period.
Increases in [[barometric pressure]] increase a pendulum's period slightly due to the first two effects, by about 0.11 seconds per day per kilopascal (0.37 seconds per day per [[inch of mercury]] or 0.015 seconds per day per [[torr]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;BritannicaP540&quot; /&gt; Researchers using pendulums to measure the [[Gravity of Earth|acceleration of gravity]] had to correct the period for the air pressure at the altitude of measurement, computing the equivalent period of a pendulum swinging in vacuum. A pendulum clock was first operated in a constant-pressure tank by Friedrich Tiede in 1865 at the [[Berlin Observatory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1900 the highest precision clocks were mounted in tanks that were kept at a constant pressure to eliminate changes in atmospheric pressure. Alternatively, in some a small [[aneroid barometer]] mechanism attached to the pendulum compensated for this effect.

=== Gravity ===
Pendulums are affected by changes in gravitational acceleration, which varies by as much as 0.5% at different locations on Earth, so precision pendulum clocks have to be recalibrated after a move. Even moving a pendulum clock to the top of a tall building can cause it to lose measurable time from the reduction in gravity.

== Accuracy of pendulums as timekeepers ==
The timekeeping elements in all clocks, which include pendulums, [[balance wheel]]s, the [[crystal oscillator|quartz crystals]] used in [[quartz watch]]es, and even the vibrating atoms in [[atomic clock]]s, are in physics called [[harmonic oscillator]]s. The reason harmonic oscillators are used in clocks is that they vibrate or oscillate at a specific [[resonant frequency]] or period and resist oscillating at other rates. However, the resonant frequency is not infinitely 'sharp'.   Around the resonant frequency there is a narrow natural band of [[Frequency|frequencies]] (or periods), called the [[resonance width]] or [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], where the harmonic oscillator will oscillate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== ''Q'' factor ===
[[File:Shortt Synchronome free pendulum clock.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Shortt-synchronome clock|Shortt-Synchronome free pendulum clock]], the most accurate pendulum clock ever made, at the [[NIST]] museum, [[Gaithersburg, MD]], USA.

The measure of a harmonic oscillator's resistance to disturbances to its oscillation period is a dimensionless parameter called the [[Q factor|''Q'' factor]] equal to the resonant frequency divided by the [[resonance width]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jespersen&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reciprocal of the Q is roughly proportional to the limiting accuracy achievable by a harmonic oscillator as a time standard.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lx0v2dhnZo8C&amp;pg=PA32&amp;sig=yYIWqaccL-YA2Mrigw4sFw5k-tk Matthys, 2004, p.32, fig. 7.2 and text]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Q'' is related to how long it takes for the oscillations of an oscillator to die out. The [[Q factor|''Q'']] of a pendulum can be measured by counting the number of oscillations it takes for the amplitude of the pendulum's swing to decay to 1/''e'' = 36.8%  of its initial swing, and multiplying by 2''π''.

In a clock, the pendulum must receive pushes from the clock's [[movement (clockwork)|movement]] to keep it swinging, to replace the energy the pendulum loses to friction. These pushes, applied by a mechanism called the [[escapement]], are the main source of disturbance to the pendulum's motion. The ''Q'' is equal to 2''π'' times the energy stored in the pendulum, divided by the energy lost to friction during each oscillation period, which is the same as the energy added by the escapement each period. It can be seen that the smaller the fraction of the pendulum's energy that is lost to friction, the less energy needs to be added, the less the disturbance from the escapement, the more 'independent' the pendulum is of the clock's mechanism, and the more constant its period is. The ''Q'' of a pendulum is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;Q = \frac{M \omega}{\Gamma} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M'' is the mass of the bob,  ''ω''&amp;nbsp;= 2''π''/''T'' is the pendulum's radian frequency of oscillation, and ''Γ'' is the frictional [[Damping|damping force]] on the pendulum per unit velocity.

''ω'' is fixed by the pendulum's period, and ''M'' is limited by the load capacity and rigidity of the suspension. So the ''Q'' of clock pendulums is increased by minimizing frictional losses (''Γ''). Precision pendulums are suspended on low friction pivots consisting of triangular shaped 'knife' edges resting on agate plates. Around 99% of the energy loss in a freeswinging pendulum is due to air friction, so mounting a pendulum in a vacuum tank can increase the ''Q'', and thus the accuracy, by a factor of 100.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lx0v2dhnZo8C&amp;pg=PA81&amp;sig=yYIWqaccL-YA2Mrigw4sFw5k-tk Matthys, 2004, p.81]&lt;/ref&gt;

Their Q of 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;  is one reason why pendulums are more accurate timekeepers than the [[balance wheel]]s in watches, with ''Q'' around 100–300, but less accurate than the [[Crystal oscillator|quartz crystals]] in [[quartz clock]]s, with ''Q'' of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marrison&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Orologeria&quot; /&gt;

=== Escapement ===
Pendulums (unlike, for example, quartz crystals) have a low enough ''Q'' that the disturbance caused by the impulses to keep them moving is generally the limiting factor on their timekeeping accuracy. Therefore, the design of the [[escapement]], the mechanism that provides these impulses, has a large effect on the accuracy of a clock pendulum. If the impulses given to the pendulum by the escapement each swing could be exactly identical, the response of the pendulum would be identical, and its period would be constant. However, this is not achievable; unavoidable random fluctuations in the force due to friction of the clock's pallets, lubrication variations, and changes in the torque provided by the clock's power source as it runs down, mean that the force of the impulse applied by the escapement varies.

If these variations in the escapement's force cause changes in the pendulum's width of swing (amplitude), this will cause corresponding slight changes in the period, since (as discussed at top) a pendulum with a finite swing is not quite isochronous. Therefore, the goal of traditional escapement design is to apply the force with the proper profile, and at the correct point in the pendulum's cycle, so force variations have no effect on the pendulum's amplitude. This is called an ''isochronous escapement''.

=== The Airy condition ===
Clockmakers had known for centuries that the disturbing effect of the escapement's drive force on the period of a pendulum is smallest if given as a short impulse as the pendulum passes through its bottom [[Equilibrium point|equilibrium position]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Marrison&quot; /&gt;  If the impulse occurs before the pendulum reaches bottom, during the downward swing, it will have the effect of shortening the pendulum's natural period, so an increase in drive force will decrease the period.  If the impulse occurs after the pendulum reaches bottom, during the upswing, it will lengthen the period, so an increase in drive force will increase the pendulum's period.  In 1826 British astronomer [[George Airy]] proved this; specifically, he proved that if a pendulum is driven by an impulse that is [[Symmetry (mathematics)|symmetrical]] about its bottom equilibrium position, the pendulum's period will be unaffected by changes in the drive force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Gravity measurement ==
The presence of the [[Gravitational acceleration|acceleration of gravity]] ''g'' in the periodicity equation (1) for a pendulum means that the local gravitational acceleration of the Earth can be calculated from the period of a pendulum.   A pendulum can therefore be used as a [[gravimeter]] to measure the local [[gravity]], which varies by over 0.5% across the surface of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group = Note&gt;The value of &quot;g&quot; (acceleration due to gravity) at the [[equator]] is 9.780&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and at the [[North Pole|poles]] is 9.832&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a difference of 0.53%.&lt;/ref&gt; The pendulum in a clock is disturbed by the pushes it receives from the clock movement, so freeswinging pendulums were used, and were the standard instruments of [[gravimetry]] up to the 1930s.

The difference between clock pendulums and gravimeter pendulums is that to measure gravity, the pendulum's length as well as its period has to be measured. The period of freeswinging pendulums could be found to great precision by comparing their swing with a precision clock that had been adjusted to keep correct time by the passage of stars overhead. In the early measurements, a weight on a cord was suspended in front of the clock pendulum, and its length adjusted until the two pendulums swung in exact synchronism. Then the length of the cord was measured. From the length and the period, ''g'' could be calculated from equation (1).

=== The seconds pendulum ===
[[File:Pendulum2secondclock.gif|thumb|The seconds pendulum, a pendulum with a period of two seconds so each swing takes one second]] 
The [[seconds pendulum]], a pendulum with a period of two seconds so each swing takes one second, was widely used to measure gravity, because its period could be easily measured by comparing it to precision [[regulator clock]]s, which all had seconds pendulums.   By the late 17th century, the length of the seconds pendulum became the standard measure of the strength of gravitational acceleration at a location. By 1700 its length had been measured with submillimeter accuracy at several cities in Europe. For a seconds pendulum, ''g'' is proportional to its length:
:&lt;math&gt;g \propto L. \,&lt;/math&gt;

At higher latitudes the surface was closer to the center of the Earth, so gravity increased with latitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lenzen1964&quot; /&gt;  From this time on, pendulums began to be taken to distant lands to measure gravity, and tables were compiled of the length of the seconds pendulum at different locations on Earth. In 1743 [[Alexis Claude Clairaut]] created the first hydrostatic model of the Earth, [[Clairaut's theorem]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Poynting &amp; Thompson 1907, p.9&quot; /&gt; which allowed the [[ellipticity]] of the Earth to be calculated from gravity measurements. Progressively more accurate models of the shape of the Earth followed.
* '''1687''': Newton experimented with pendulums (described in ''Principia'') and found that equal length pendulums with bobs made of different materials had the same period, proving that the gravitational force on different substances was exactly proportional to their [[mass]] (inertia).

He calculated the length to the center of oscillation of thread and bob combined, instead of using the center of the bob. He corrected for thermal expansion of the measuring rod and barometric pressure, giving his results for a pendulum swinging in vacuum. Bouguer swung the same pendulum at three different elevations, from sea level to the top of the high Peruvian ''[[altiplano]]''. Gravity should fall with the inverse square of the distance from the center of the Earth. Bouguer found that it fell off slower, and correctly attributed the 'extra' gravity to the gravitational field of the huge Peruvian plateau. From the density of rock samples he calculated an estimate of the effect of the ''altiplano'' on the pendulum, and comparing this with the gravity of the Earth was able to make the first rough estimate of the [[Mass of the Earth|density of the Earth]].

* '''1792''': To define a pendulum standard of length for use with the new [[metric system]], in 1792 [[Jean-Charles de Borda]] and [[Dominique, comte de Cassini|Jean-Dominique Cassini]] made a precise measurement of the seconds pendulum at Paris. They used a {{frac|1|1|2}}-inch (14&amp;nbsp;mm){{clarify|reason=1.5&quot; is not 14mm|date=September 2019}} platinum ball suspended by a {{convert|12|ft|adj=on}} iron wire. Their main innovation was a technique called the &quot;''method of coincidences''&quot; which allowed the period of pendulums to be compared with great precision.  (Bouguer had also used this method). The time interval Δ''t'' between the recurring instants when the two pendulums swung in synchronism was timed. From this the difference between the periods of the pendulums, ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', could be calculated:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{\Delta t} = \frac {1}{T_1} - \frac {1}{T_2}\,&lt;/math&gt;

His measurements showed 'excess' gravity, which he allocated to the effect of the mountain. Modeling the mountain as a segment of a sphere {{convert|11|mi}} in diameter and {{convert|1|mi}} high, from rock samples he calculated its gravitational field, and estimated the density of the Earth at 4.39 times that of water. Later recalculations by others gave values of 4.77 and 4.95, illustrating the uncertainties in these geographical methods.

The precision of the early gravity measurements above was limited by the difficulty of measuring the length of the pendulum, ''L'' .  ''L'' was the length of an idealized simple gravity pendulum (described at top), which has all its mass concentrated in a point at the end of the cord. In 1673 Huygens had shown that the period of a rigid bar pendulum (called a ''compound pendulum'') was equal to the period of a simple pendulum with a length equal to the distance between the [[wikt:pivot|pivot]] point and a point called the [[Center of percussion|center of oscillation]], located under the [[center of gravity]], that depends on the mass distribution along the pendulum. But there was no accurate way of determining the center of oscillation in a real pendulum.

To get around this problem, the early researchers above approximated an ideal simple pendulum as closely as possible by using a metal sphere suspended by a light wire or cord. If the wire was light enough, the center of oscillation was close to the center of gravity of the ball, at its geometric center. This &quot;ball and wire&quot; type of pendulum wasn't very accurate, because it didn't swing as a rigid body, and the elasticity of the wire caused its length to change slightly as the pendulum swung.

However Huygens had also proved that in any pendulum, the pivot point and the center of oscillation were interchangeable.&lt;ref name=&quot;HuygensReciprocity&quot; /&gt;  That is, if a pendulum were turned upside down and hung from its center of oscillation, it would have the same period as it did in the previous position, and the old pivot point would be the new center of oscillation.

British physicist and army captain [[Henry Kater]] in 1817 realized that Huygens' principle could be used to find the length of a simple pendulum with the same period as a real pendulum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kater1818&quot; /&gt;  If a pendulum was built with a second adjustable pivot point near the bottom so it could be hung upside down, and the second pivot was adjusted until the periods when hung from both pivots were the same, the second pivot would be at the center of oscillation, and the distance between the two pivots would be the length ''L'' of a simple pendulum with the same period.

Kater built a reversible pendulum (shown at right) consisting of a brass bar with two opposing pivots made of short triangular &quot;knife&quot; blades ''&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;(a)&lt;/span&gt;'' near either end. It could be swung from either pivot, with the knife blades supported on agate plates. Rather than make one pivot adjustable, he attached the pivots a meter apart and instead adjusted the periods with a moveable weight on the pendulum rod ''&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;(b,c)&lt;/span&gt;''. In operation, the pendulum is hung in front of a precision clock, and the period timed, then turned upside down and the period timed again. The weight is adjusted with the adjustment screw until the periods are equal. Then putting this period and the distance between the pivots into equation (1) gives the gravitational acceleration ''g'' very accurately.

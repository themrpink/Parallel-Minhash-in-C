In 1890, the city had 40,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;populstat.info&quot;&gt;{{Citation | first = Jan | last = Lahmeyer | publisher = University of Utrecht | contribution-url = http://www.populstat.info/Asia/nkoreat.htm | title = Populstat | contribution = North Korea – Urban Population}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the site of the [[Battle of Pyongyang (1894)|Battle of Pyongyang]] during the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], which led to the destruction and depopulation of much of the city. It was the provincial capital of South Pyeongan Province beginning in 1896. Under [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese colonial rule]], the city became an industrial center, called Heijō (with the same Chinese characters {{lang|ja|平壤}} but read as {{lang|ja|へいじょう}}) in Japanese.

[[File:Heijo Tram.JPG|thumb|Pyongyang Tram during the 1920s]]
In July 1931, the city experienced [[Wanpaoshan Incident#Anti-Chinese riots in Korea|anti-Chinese riots]] as a result of the [[Wanpaoshan Incident]] and the sensationalized media reports about it which appeared in Imperial Japanese and Korean newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum (Institute of Pacific Relations, American Council), Vol. 2, No. 5 (16 Mar 1933), pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1938, Pyongyang had a population of 235,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;populstat.info&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Pyongyang aerial view (15124608601).jpg|thumb|right|Modern-day Pyongyang]]
On 25 August 1945, the [[25th Army (Soviet Union)|Soviet 25th Army]] entered Pyongyang and it became the temporary capital of the [[Provisional People's Committee for North Korea]]. A People's Committee was already established there, led by veteran Christian nationalist [[Cho Man-sik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 0-415-23749-1 |pages=54–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pyongyang became the de facto capital of North Korea upon its establishment in 1948. At the time, the Pyongyang government aimed to recapture Korea's official capital, [[Seoul]]. [[Bombing of Pyongyang|Pyongyang was again severely damaged]] in the [[Korean War]], during which it was briefly occupied by South Korean forces from 19 October to 6 December 1950. In 1952, it was the target of the largest aerial raid of the entire war, involving 1,400 UN aircraft.

Already during the war, plans were made to reconstruct the city. On 27 July 1953 – the day the armistice between North Korea and South Korea was signed – ''[[The Pyongyang Review]]'' wrote: &quot;While streets were in flames, an exhibition showing the general plan of restoration of Pyongyang was held at the Moranbong Underground Theater&quot;, the air raid shelter of the government under [[Moranbong]]. &quot;On the way of victory... fireworks which streamed high into the night sky of the capital in a gun salute briefly illuminated the construction plan of the city which would rise soon with a new look&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Schinz | first1 = Alfred | last2 = Eckart | first2 =Dege | year = 1990 | title = Pyongyang-Ancient and Modern – the Capital of North Korea | journal = GeoJournal | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | page = 25| doi = 10.1007/BF02428536 | s2cid = 153574542 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, the city was quickly rebuilt with assistance from the [[Soviet Union]], and many buildings were built in the style of [[Stalinist architecture]]. The plans for the modern city of Pyongyang were first displayed for public viewing in a theatre building. Kim Jung-hee, one of the founding members of the Korean Architects Alliance, who had studied architecture in [[Empire of Japan|prewar Japan]] was appointed by Kim Il Sung to design the city's master plan. [[MArchI|Moscow Architecture Institute]], designed the “Pyongyang City Reconstruction and Construction Comprehensive Plan” in 1951, and it was officially adopted in 1953. The transformation into a modern, propaganda-designed city called Stalin style architecture with a Korean-style arrangement (and other modernist architecture that was said to have been greatly influenced by Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer) began.&lt;ref&gt;金聖甫、李信澈『写真と絵で見る北朝鮮現代史』監修：李泳采、韓興鉄訳、コモンズ、東京・新宿（原著2010年12月1日）。{{ISBN|978-4861870750}}。2018年4月30日閲覧。&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Constitution of North Korea|1972 Constitution]] it was officially declared as the capital.

In 2001, North Korean authorities began a long-term modernisation programme. The Ministry of Capital City Construction Development was included in the [[Cabinet of North Korea|Cabinet]] in that year. In 2006, Kim Jong-il's brother-in-law [[Jang Song-thaek]] took charge of the ministry.

==Geography==
Pyongyang is in the west-central part of North Korea; the city lies on a flat plain about {{convert|50|km|0}} east of the [[Korea Bay]], an arm of the [[Yellow Sea]]. The [[Taedong River]] flows southwestward through the city toward the Korea Bay. The Pyongyang plain, where the city is situated, is one of the two large plains on the Western coast of the Korean peninsula, the other being the Chaeryong plain. Both have an area of approximately 500 square kilometers.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p=63}}

===Climate===
Pyongyang has a hot-summer [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dwa''), featuring warm to hot, humid summers and cold, dry winters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Muller|first=M. J.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=az3qCAAAQBAJ&amp;q=Pyongyang+koppen+dwa&amp;pg=PA125|title=Selected climatic data for a global set of standard stations for vegetation science|date=2012-12-06|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-009-8040-2|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=85074&amp;cityname=Pyongyang,+North+Korea|title=Pyongyang, North Korea Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=2020-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cold, dry winds can blow from [[Siberian High|Siberia]] in winter, making conditions very cold; the low temperature is usually below freezing between November and early March, although the average daytime high is at least a few degrees above freezing in every month except January. The winter is generally much drier than summer, with snow falling for 37 days on average.

The transition from the cold, dry winter to the warm, wet summer occurs rather quickly between April and early May, and there is a similarly abrupt return to winter conditions in late October and November. Summers are generally hot and humid, with the [[East Asian monsoon]] taking place from June until September; these are also the hottest months, with average temperatures of {{convert|21|to|25|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}, and daytime highs often above {{convert|30|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Although largely transitional seasons, spring and autumn experience more pleasant weather, with average high temperatures ranging from 20 to 26 °C (69 to 78 °F) in May and 22 to 27 °C (80 to 71 °F) in September,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Average Weather in May in Pyongyang, North Korea - Weather Spark|url=https://weatherspark.com/m/141759/5/Average-Weather-in-May-in-Pyongyang-North-Korea|access-date=2020-08-23|website=weatherspark.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Average Weather in September in Pyongyang, North Korea - Weather Spark|url=https://weatherspark.com/m/141759/9/Average-Weather-in-September-in-Pyongyang-North-Korea|access-date=2020-08-23|website=weatherspark.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; coupled with relatively clear, sunny skies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Average Weather in Pyongyang, North Korea, Year Round - Weather Spark|url=https://weatherspark.com/y/141759/Average-Weather-in-Pyongyang-North-Korea-Year-Round#Sections-Clouds|access-date=2020-08-23|website=weatherspark.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Average Weather in Pyongyang, North Korea, Year Round - Weather Spark|url=https://weatherspark.com/y/141759/Average-Weather-in-Pyongyang-North-Korea-Year-Round#Sections-Precipitation|access-date=2020-08-23|website=weatherspark.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
[[File:Mansudae Assembly Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Mansudae Assembly Hall]], seat of the [[Supreme People's Assembly]], the North Korean parliament]]
Major government and other public offices are located in Pyongyang, which is constitutionally designated as the country's capital.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p=196}} The seat of the [[Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea|Workers' Party Central Committee]] and the Pyongyang People's Committee are located in Haebangsan-dong, [[Chung-guyok]]. The [[Cabinet of North Korea]] is located in Jongro-dong, [[Chung-guyok]].

Pyongyang is also the seat of all major North Korean security institutions. The largest of them, the [[Ministry of Public Security (North Korea)|Ministry of People's Security]], has 130,000 employees working in 12 bureaus. These oversee activities including: police services, security of party officials, classified documents, census, civil registrations, large-scale public construction, [[traffic control]], fire safety, [[civil defence]], [[public health]] and [[customs]].{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|pp=276–277}} Another significant structure based in the city is the [[State Security Department]], whose 30,000 personnel manage intelligence, political prison systems, military industrial security and entry and exit management.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p=277}}

The politics and management of the city is dominated by the [[Workers' Party of Korea]], as they are in the national level. The city is managed by the Pyongyang Party Committee of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] and its chairman is the ''de facto'' [[mayor]]. The supreme standing state organ is the Pyongyang People's Committee, responsible
for everyday events in support of the city. This includes following local Party guidance as channeled through the Pyongyang Party Committee, the distribution of resources prioritised to Pyongyang, and providing support to KWP and internal security agency personnel and families.

==Administrative status and divisions==
P'yŏngyang is divided into 18 wards (''ku-'' or ''guyŏk'') ''(the city proper)'' and 2 counties (''kun'' or ''gun'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nk.chosun.com/map/map.html?ACT=geo_01|title=행정구역현황 (''Haengjeong Guyeok Hyeonhwang'')|work=NK Chosun|accessdate=10 January 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109202822/http://nk.chosun.com/map/map.html?ACT=geo_01|archivedate=9 January 2006}} Also [http://www.xzqh.org/waiguo/asia/1002.htm Administrative divisions of North Korea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041018022439/http://www.xzqh.org/waiguo/asia/1002.htm |date=18 October 2004 }} (used as reference for hanja)&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign media reports in 2010 stated that [[Kangnam-gun]], [[Chunghwa-gun]], [[Sangwŏn-gun]], and [[Sŭngho-guyŏk]] had been transferred to the administration of neighboring [[North Hwanghae]] province.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.asahi.com/english/TKY201007160470.html|periodical=[[Asahi Shimbun]]|date=17 July 2010|accessdate=19 July 2010|title=Pyongyang now more than one-third smaller; food shortage issues suspected}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kangnam-gun was returned to Pyongyang in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.nkeconwatch.com/2012/02/29/kangnam-moved-into-pyongyang/ |title = Kangnam moved into Pyongyang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being destroyed during the Korean War, Pyongyang was entirely rebuilt according to Kim Il-sung's vision, which was to create a capital that would boost morale in the post-war years.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p=91,93–94}} The result was a city with wide, tree-lined boulevards and public buildings with terraced landscaping, [[mosaic]]s and decorated ceilings.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p=91}} Its Russian-style architecture makes it reminiscent of a [[Siberia]]n city during winter snowfall, although edifices of traditional Korean design somewhat soften this perception. In summer, it is notable for its rivers, willow trees, flowers and parkland.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p=91}}

The streets are laid out in a north-south, east-west grid, giving the city an orderly appearance.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p=91}} North Korean designers applied the Swedish experience of self-sufficient urban neighbourhoods throughout the entire country, and Pyongyang is no exception. Its inhabitants are mostly divided into administrative units of 5,000 to 6,000 people (''dong''). These units all have similar sets of amenities including a food store, a barber shop, a [[tailor]], a public bathhouse, a [[post office]], a clinic, a library and others. Many residents occupy high-rise apartment buildings.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p=97}} One of Kim Il-sung's priorities while designing Pyongyang was to limit the population. Authorities maintain a restrictive regime of movement into the city, making it atypical of [[East Asia]] as it is silent, uncrowded and spacious.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p=91-92}}

Structures in Pyongyang are divided into three major architectural categories: monuments, buildings with traditional Korean motifs and high-rises.&lt;ref name=&quot;LCCS93&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+kp0053)|title=Architecture and City Planning|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of North Korea's most recognisable landmarks are monuments, like the [[Juche Tower|''Juche'' Tower]], the [[Arch of Triumph (Pyongyang)|Arch of Triumph]] and the [[Mansu Hill Grand Monument]]. The first of them is a 170-meter [[granite]] spire symbolizing the ''[[Juche]]'' ideology. It was completed in 1982 and contains 25,550 granite blocks, one for each day of Kim Il-sung's life up to that point.&lt;ref name=&quot;LCCS93&quot;/&gt; The most prominent building on Pyongyang's skyline is [[Ryugyong Hotel]],&lt;ref name=&quot;LCCS93&quot;/&gt; the [[List of buildings with 100 floors or more|seventh highest building]] in the world terms of floor count, the tallest unoccupied building in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2014|last=Glenday|first=Craig|isbn=978-1-908843-15-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/144 144]|year=2013|url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/144}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the [[List of tallest hotels in the world|tallest hotels in the world]].

Pyongyang served as the provincial capital of [[South Pyongan Province]] until 1946,&lt;ref name=&quot;EncyKorea Pyongyang&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=298139&amp;v=44 |script-title=ko:평양시 平壤市 |trans-title=Pyongyang |publisher=Nate/Encyclopedia of Korean Culture |language=Korean |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610080045/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=298139&amp;v=44 |archivedate=10 June 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pyongyang cuisine shares the general culinary tradition of the Pyongan province. The most famous local food is ''[[Pyongyang naengmyeon|Pyongyang raengmyŏn]]'', or also called ''mul raengmyŏn'' or just simply ''raengmyŏn''. ''Raengmyŏn'' literally means &quot;cold noodles&quot;, while the affix ''mul'' refers to water because the dish is served in a cold broth. ''Raengmyŏn'' consists of thin and chewy buckwheat noodles in a cold meat-broth with ''[[dongchimi]]'' (watery kimchi) and topped with a slice of sweet [[Korean pear]].

Pyongyang ''raengmyŏn'' was originally eaten in homes built with ''[[ondol]]'' (traditional [[underfloor heating]]) during the cold winter, so it is also called ''&quot;Pyongyang deoldeori&quot;'' (shivering in Pyongyang). Pyongyang locals sometimes enjoyed it as a ''[[haejangguk]]'', which is any type of food eaten as a hangover-cure, usually a warm soup.&lt;ref name=&quot;Korean Portal&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.knowledge.go.kr/jsp/theme/themeView.jsp?themeIdx=2872&amp;dir=al&amp;page=4&amp;searchOption=all&amp;searchValue= |script-title= ko:닮은 듯 색다른 매력을 간직한 북한의 음식 문화 |publisher= Korea Knowledge Portal |date= 19 June 2009 |language= Korean |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111009165958/http://www.knowledge.go.kr/jsp/theme/themeView.jsp?themeIdx=2872&amp;dir=al&amp;page=4&amp;searchOption=all&amp;searchValue= |archivedate= 9 October 2011 |df= dmy-all }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Another representative Pyongyang dish, ''[[Taedonggang sungeoguk]]'', translates as &quot;trout soup from the [[Taedong River]]&quot;. The soup features [[trout]] (abundant in the Taedong River) along with black peppercorns and salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ko:'오마니의 맛' 관심 |trans-title=Attention to &quot;Mother's taste&quot;|newspaper= [[The Chosun Ilbo]]| last =Ju | first = Wan-jung (주완중)|language= Korean|date= 12 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, it has been served to guests visiting Pyongyang. Therefore, there is a common saying, &quot;How good was the trout soup?&quot;, which is used to greet people returning from Pyongyang.

[[File:Laika ac Pyongyang (7975203722).jpg|thumb|right|Central Pyongyang with the newly built Changjon Apartment Complex. The [[Okryu Bridge]] and [[Ryugyong Hotel]] are in the background]]
Pyongyang is North Korea's industrial center.&lt;ref name=&quot;EBPyongyang&quot;/&gt; Thanks to the abundance of natural resources like [[coal]], [[iron]] and [[limestone]], as well as good land and water transport systems, it was the first industrial city to emerge in North Korea after the Korean War. Light and heavy industries are both present and have developed in parallel. Heavy manufactures include [[cement]], industrial ceramics, munitions and weapons, but mechanical engineering remains the core industry. Light industries in Pyongyang and its vicinity include [[textiles]], footwear and food, among others. Special emphasis is put on the production and supply of fresh produce and subsidiary crops in farms on the city's outskirts. Other crops include [[rice]], [[maize|sweetcorn]] and [[soybeans]]. Pyongyang aims to achieve self-sufficiency in meat production. High-density facilities raise pigs, chicken and other livestock.&lt;ref name=&quot;EBPyongyang&quot;/&gt;

The city still experiences frequent shortages of electricity.&lt;ref name=&quot;IFES1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ifes.kyungnam.ac.kr/eng/FRM/FRM_0101V.aspx?code=FRM141219_0001|title=Ten Power Plants on Chongchon River under Construction to Increase Power Supply to Pyongyang|publisher=Institute for Far Eastern Studies|date=19 December 2014|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427143900/http://ifes.kyungnam.ac.kr/eng/FRM/FRM_0101V.aspx?code=FRM141219_0001|archive-date=27 April 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; To solve this problem, two power stations – Huichon Power Stations 1 and 2 – were built in [[Chagang Province]] and supply the city through direct transmission lines. A second phase of the power expansion project was launched in January 2013, consisting of a series of small dams along the [[Chongchon River]]. The first two power stations have a maximum generating capacity of 300 megawatts (MW), while the 10 dams to be built under second phase are expected to generate about 120 MW.&lt;ref name=&quot;IFES1&quot;/&gt; In addition, the city has several existing or planned [[thermal power station]]s. These include Pyongyang TPS with a capacity of 500 MW, East Pyongyang TPS with a capacity of 50 MW, and Kangdong TPS which is under construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://38north.org/2014/11/cmelvin112514/|title=Pyongyang's Perpetual Power Problems|publisher=38North.org|date=25 November 2014|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city also has Hwanggumbol Shop, a chain of state-owned convenience stores supplying goods at prices cheaper than those in the [[jangmadang]] markets. Hwanggumbol Shops are specifically designed to control North Korea's expanding markets by attracting consumers and guaranteeing the circulation of money in government-operated stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ifes.kyungnam.ac.kr/eng/FRM/FRM_0101V.aspx?code=FRM150320_0001|title=Effort to Prevent Outflow of Capital into Markets|publisher=Institute for Far Eastern Studies|date=20 March 2015|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308213634/http://ifes.kyungnam.ac.kr/eng/FRM/FRM_0101V.aspx?code=FRM150320_0001|archive-date=8 March 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transportation===
[[File:Tatra tram in Pyongyang.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tatra KT8D5K]] tram]]
Pyongyang is also the main transport hub of the country: it has a network of roads, railways and air routes which link it to both foreign and domestic destinations. It is the starting point of inter-regional highways reaching Nampo, Wonsan and Kaesong.&lt;ref name=&quot;EBPyongyang&quot;/&gt; [[Pyongyang Station|Pyongyang railway station]] serves the main railway lines, including the [[Pyongui Line]] and the [[Pyongbu Line]]. Regular international rail services to [[Beijing]], the Chinese border city of [[Dandong]] and [[Moscow]] are also available.

A rail journey to Beijing takes about 25&amp;nbsp;hours and 25&amp;nbsp;minutes (K27 from Beijing/K28 from Pyongyang, on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays); a journey to Dandong takes about 6 hours (daily); a journey to Moscow takes six days. The city also connects to the [[Eurasian Land Bridge]] via the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]. A [[high-speed rail]] link to Wonsan is planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ifes.kyungnam.ac.kr/eng/FRM/FRM_0101V.aspx?code=FRM150326_0001|title=Outline for Development of Wonsan-Kumgangsan Tourist Region Revealed|publisher=Institute for Far Eastern Studies|date=26 March 2015|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427143855/http://ifes.kyungnam.ac.kr/eng/FRM/FRM_0101V.aspx?code=FRM150326_0001|archive-date=27 April 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloemfontein has a large and diverse Christian population. The city houses several churches and denominations:

* It is the seat of the [[Anglican Diocese of the Free State]]
* Afrikaans [[Baptist Church]] (Afrikaans: ''Afrikaanse Baptiste Kerk'')
* [[Dutch Reformed Church]] (Afrikaans: ''Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk'')
* [[Sacred Heart]] Cathedral in Bloemfontein is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bloemfontein]]
* [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], Southern African headquarters.

CRC's net is widely cast and is established in Bloemfontein, Pretoria and Johannesburg along with 90 national and international CRC Churches worldwide, executing the mission of &quot;One Church, Many Locations&quot; throughout South Africa, Europe, America &amp; Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crc.org.za/|title=Christian Revival Church - Win the lost at any cost!|last=alphawebdesign.co.za|website=www.crc.org.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church is led by Pastor At Boshoff, together with his wife Nyretta.
* [[New Covenant Ministries International]] had a church called Fountainhead led by Chris Gerber.  It was a New Testament Church known by the name Fountainhead Church International. Later this church merged with [[Doxa Deo Church|Doxa Deo Bloemfontein]], which is now the name of the combined church.

The city also has a large Jewish population, which was established during the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Issroff|first=Dr Saul|title=A HISTORY OF THE JEWISH COMMUNITY ARCHIVES|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/safrica/communities/8/index.htm|publisher=Saul Issroff, Mike Getz, SAfrica SIG and Jewishgen Inc.|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main cemeteries in Bloemfontein:
* The Old Cemetery: Over 1,000 names from the three cemeteries. Old: The oldest of the three cemeteries, dating from 1871, is simply a small fenced off area of a public cemetery near the city centre. It includes a few graves of several Jewish pioneers involved in the early days of the city who died serving on either side in the Boer War, 1899–1902. Each of the thirty or so tombstones of these pioneer families has been completely transcribed.
* South Park: This cemetery was consecrated in 1978 and now includes more than 10 000 graves and is the biggest cemetery in the Free State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BLOEMFONTEIN - Free State Prov|url=http://www.iajgsjewishcemeteryproject.org/south-africa/bloemfontein.html|publisher=International Jewish Cemetery Project|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 October 2010, Several tombstones in the Jewish cemetery in Bloemfontein were defaced with swastikas and antisemitic graffiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Africa – Jewish cemetery was desecrated|url=http://antisemitism.org.il/article/13935/south-africa-%E2%80%93-jewish-cemetery-was-desecrated|publisher=CFCA|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 10 April 2012, Bloemfontein's historic Memorium cemetery was vandalized, with 35 tombstones toppled and obscene graffiti daubed on the walls of the adjoining Ohel. The graffiti included images of money bags and diamonds, as well as of a crudely drawn [[Star of David|Magen David]], allegedly as part of an anti-Semitic act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish cemetery vandalized|url=http://antisemitism.org.il/article/71463/jewish-cemetery-vandalized|publisher=CFCA|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is also the old Phahameng cemetery which dates back to the 1960s and was specifically reserved for Africans during the apartheid era and has a Heroes Acre, where freedom fighters are laid to rest.
The Heide Heights cemetery in Heidedal was reserved for coloured people during the apartheid era but all races could bury their dead after 1994. This cemetery has been closed due to it being full.

==Community service organisations==
* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080123182124/http://www.roundtable158.co.za/ Round Table 158 Bloemfontein] The first [[Round Table (club)|Round Table]] was formed in [[Norwich]], England in 1927. The founder, [[Louis Marchesi]], was a young member of Norwich Rotary Club who felt a need existed for a club where the young business men of the town could gather on a regular basis. At their meetings they could exchange ideas, learn from the experiences of their colleagues and play a collective part in the civic life of Norwich. From a very early stage it was agreed that Round Table would be a non-religious, non-political club and this has continued to this day.
* [http://www.childwelfarebfn.org.za Child Welfare Bloemfontein] Child Welfare Bloemfontein &amp; Childline Free State is a non-profit organisation that was founded in 1914 by a group of volunteers who identified a need for welfare services among the community. In 2004, Child Welfare Bloemfontein celebrated its 90th birthday. Over the past 90 years, many community programmes have been successfully implemented.
* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131113044451/http://www.masoniclodges.co.za/index.php FreeMasons] The Masonic Centre, Bloemfontein, was built during the 1970s when all the Masonic Lodges in Bloemfontein, sold their individual properties.

{{SouthAfrica state}}
The '''Cape of Good Hope''', also known as the '''Cape Colony''' ({{lang-nl|Kaapkolonie}}), was a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[colony]] in present-day [[South Africa]] named after the [[Cape of Good Hope (landmark)|Cape of Good Hope]].  The British colony was preceded by an earlier Corporate colony that became a Dutch colony of the same name (controlled by France), the ''[[Dutch Cape Colony|Kaap de Goede Hoop]]'', established in 1652 by the [[Dutch East India Company|United East India Company (VOC)]]. The Cape was under VOC rule from 1652 to 1795 and under rule of the [[Batavian Republic|Batavia Republic]] from 1803 to 1806.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=J. A. |last=Heese|title= Die Herkoms van die Afrikaner 1657 - 1867|language=af|trans-title=The Origin of the Afrikaaner 1657 - 1867|publisher= A. A. Balkema|location = Cape Town|date= 1971|isbn=978-1-920429-13-3|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
The VOC lost the colony to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] following the 1795 [[Battle of Muizenberg]], but it was acceded to the Batavia Republic following the 1802 [[Peace of Amiens]]. It was re-occupied by the UK following the [[Battle of Blaauwberg]] in 1806, and British possession affirmed with the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]].[[File:SouthAfrica1885.svg|thumb|Map of the Cape of Good Hope in 1885 (blue). The area of Griqualand East is large, while the southern half of Bechuanaland Protectorate has been annexed as British Bechuanaland.|alt=|left]]The Cape of Good Hope then remained in the British Empire, becoming [[Responsible government|self-governing]] in 1872. The colony was coextensive with the later Cape Province, stretching from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic coast]] inland and eastward along the southern coast, constituting about half of modern South Africa: the final eastern boundary, after several wars against the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]], stood at the [[Great Fish River|Fish River]]. In the north, the [[Orange River]],  natively known as the ǂNūǃarib (Black River) and subsequently called the Gariep River, served as the boundary for some time, although some land between the river and the southern boundary of [[Botswana]] was later added to it.

From 1878, the colony also included the enclave of [[Walvis Bay]] and the [[Penguin Islands]], both in what is now [[Namibia]]. It united with three other colonies to form the [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910.  It then was renamed the [[Cape Province|Province of the Cape of Good Hope]].{{sfn|Keltie|Epstein|1920|p=222}} South Africa became a sovereign state in 1931 by the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]]. In 1961 it became the Republic of South Africa and obtained its own monetary unit called the Rand. Following the 1994 creation of [[Provinces of South Africa|the present-day South African provinces]], the Cape Province was partitioned into the [[Eastern Cape]], [[Northern Cape]], and [[Western Cape]], with smaller parts in [[North West (South African province)|North West]] province.

==History==
===VOC settlement===
{{main|Dutch Cape Colony}}

An expedition of the [[Dutch East India Company|United East India Company]] (VOC) led by [[Jan van Riebeeck]] established a trading post and naval victualing station at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652.&lt;ref name=Hunt1&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunt|first=John|editor-last=Campbell|editor-first=Heather-Ann|title=Dutch South Africa: Early Settlers at the Cape, 1652-1708|date=2005|pages=13–35|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1904744955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Riebeeck's objective was to secure a harbour of refuge for VOC ships during the long voyages between Europe and Asia.&lt;ref name=Hunt1/&gt; Within about three decades, the Cape had become home to a large community of &quot;''vrijlieden''&quot;, also known as &quot;''vrijburgers''&quot; (free citizens), former VOC employees who settled in the colonies overseas after completing their service contracts.&lt;ref name=Parthesius&gt;{{cite book|last=Parthesius|first=Robert|title=Dutch Ships in Tropical Waters: The Development of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) Shipping Network in Asia 1595–1660|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-9053565179}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vrijburgers'' were mostly married citizens who undertook to spend at least twenty years farming the land within the fledgling colony's borders; in exchange they received tax exempt status and were loaned tools and seeds.&lt;ref name=Lucas&gt;{{cite book|last=Lucas|first=Gavin|title=An Archaeology of Colonial Identity: Power and Material Culture in the Dwars Valley, South Africa|date=2004|pages=29–33|publisher=Springer, Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0306485381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting the multi-national nature of the early trading companies, the VOC granted ''vrijburger'' status to Dutch, Scandinavian and German employees, among others.{{sfn|Worden|2010|pp= 94–140}} In 1688 they also sponsored the immigration of nearly two hundred French [[Huguenot]] refugees who had fled to the Netherlands upon the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]].&lt;ref name=Lambert&gt;{{cite book|last=Lambert|first=David|title=The Protestant International and the Huguenot Migration to Virginia|date=2009|pages=32–34|publisher=Peter Land Publishing, Incorporated|location=New York|isbn=978-1433107597}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a degree of cultural assimilation due to Dutch cultural hegemony, that included the almost universal adoption of the Dutch language.&lt;ref name=NHOSA&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mbenga|first1=Bernard|last2=Giliomee|first2=Hermann|title=New History of South Africa|date=2007|pages=59–60|publisher=Tafelburg, Publishers|location=Cape Town|isbn=978-0624043591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British conquest===
{{main|Invasion of the Cape Colony (1795)}}
In 1795, France occupied the [[Dutch Republic|Seven Provinces]] of the Netherlands, the mother country of the [[Dutch East India Company|United East India Company]]. This prompted [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] to occupy the territory in 1795 as a way to better control the seas in order to stop any potential French attempt to reach [[India]]. The British sent a fleet of nine warships which anchored at [[Simon's Town]] and, following the defeat of the VOC militia at the [[Battle of Muizenberg]], took control of the territory. The United East India Company transferred its territories and claims to the [[Batavian Republic]] (the Revolutionary period Dutch state) in 1798, and went bankrupt in 1799. Improving relations between Britain and [[First French Empire|Napoleonic France]], and its vassal state the Batavian Republic, led the British to hand the Cape of Good Hope over to the Batavian Republic in 1803, under the terms of the [[Treaty of Amiens]].

{{CapeColony}}
In 1806, the Cape, now nominally controlled by the Batavian Republic, was occupied again by the British after their victory in the [[Battle of Blaauwberg]]. The temporary peace between the UK and Napoleonic France had crumbled into open hostilities, whilst Napoleon had been strengthening his influence on the Batavian Republic (which Napoleon would subsequently abolish later the same year). The British, who set up a colony on 8 January 1806,{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} hoped to keep [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] out of the Cape, and to control the Far East trade routes.

The Cape Colony at the time of British occupation was three months’ sailing distance from London. The white colonial population was small, no more than 25,000 in all, scattered across a territory of 100,000 square miles. Most lived in Cape Town and the surrounding farming districts of the [[Boland, Western Cape|Boland]], an area favoured with rich soils, a Mediterranean climate and reliable rainfall. Cape Town had a population of 16,000 people. {{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=1}} 
In 1814 the Dutch government formally ceded sovereignty over the Cape to the British, under the terms of the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814|Convention of London]].

===British colonisation===
The British started to settle the eastern border of the cape colony, with the arrival in [[Port Elizabeth]] of the [[1820 Settlers]]. They also began to introduce the first rudimentary rights for the Cape's black African population and, in 1834, [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolished slavery]]. The resentment that the Dutch farmers felt against this social change, as well as the imposition of English language and culture, caused them to trek inland en masse. This was known as the [[Great Trek]], and the migrating Boers settled inland, forming the [[Boer republics]] of [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] and the [[Orange Free State]].

British immigration continued in the Cape, even as many of the Boers continued to trek inland, and the ending of the British East India Company's monopoly on trade led to economic growth.
At the same time, the long series of [[Xhosa Wars|border wars]] fought against the [[Xhosa people]] of the Cape's eastern frontier finally died down when the Xhosa took part in a [[Xhosa Wars#Cattle-killing movement (1856–58)|mass destruction of their own crops and cattle]], in the belief that this would cause their spirits to appear and defeat the whites. The resulting famine crippled Xhosa resistance and ushered in a long period of stability on the border.

Peace and prosperity led to a desire for political independence. In 1853, the Cape Colony became a British Crown colony with representative government.{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=576}} In 1854, the Cape of Good Hope [[Cape Colony parliamentary election, 1854|elected its first parliament]], on the basis of the multi-racial [[Cape Qualified Franchise]]. Cape residents qualified as voters based on a universal minimum level of property ownership, regardless of race.

The fact that executive power remained completely in the authority of the British governor did not relieve tensions in the colony between its [[Eastern Cape|eastern]] and [[Western Cape|western]] sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Illustrated History of South Africa|publisher=The Reader’s Digest Association South Africa|date= 1992|isbn=0-947008-90-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responsible government===

In 1872, after a long political battle, the Cape of Good Hope achieved [[responsible government]] under its first Prime Minister, [[John Molteno]]. Henceforth, an elected Prime Minister and his cabinet had total responsibility for the affairs of the country. A period of strong economic growth and social development ensued, and the [[Eastern Cape Separatist League|eastern-western division]] was largely laid to rest. The system of [[Cape Qualified Franchise|multi-racial franchise]] also began a slow and fragile growth in political inclusiveness, and ethnic tensions subsided.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, Neil, ''A New History of Southern Africa'', Second Edition. Macmillan, London (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1877, the state expanded by annexing [[Griqualand West]] and [[Griqualand East]]&lt;ref&gt;John Dugard: ''International Law, A South African Perspective''. Cape Town. 2006. p.136.&lt;/ref&gt; – that is, the Mount Currie district ([[Kokstad, KwaZulu-Natal|Kokstad]]). The emergence of two Boer mini-republics along the Missionary Road resulted in 1885 in the Warren Expedition, sent to annex the republics of [[Stellaland]] and [[Goshen (South Africa)|Goshen]]. Major-General [[Charles Warren]] annexed the land south of the (usually dry) Molopo River as the colony of British Bechuanaland and proclaimed a protectorate over the land lying to its north. [[Vryburg, North West|Vryburg]], the capital of Stellaland, became capital of British Bechuanaland, while [[Siege of Mafeking|Mafeking]] (now [[Mahikeng]]), although situated south of the protectorate border, became the protectorate's administrative centre. The border between the protectorate and the colony ran along the Molopo and Nossob rivers. In 1895 British Bechuanaland became part of the Cape Colony.

However, the discovery of diamonds around [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] and gold in the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] led to a return to instability, particularly because they fuelled the rise to power of the ambitious imperialist [[Cecil Rhodes]]. On becoming the Cape's Prime Minister in 1890, he instigated a rapid expansion of British influence into the hinterland. In particular, he sought to engineer the conquest of the Transvaal, and although his ill-fated [[Jameson Raid]] failed and brought down his government, it led to the [[Second Boer War]] and British conquest at the turn of the century. The politics of the colony consequently came to be increasingly dominated by tensions between the British colonists and the Boers. Rhodes also brought in the first formal restrictions on the political rights of the Cape of Good Hope's black African citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, Philip (2008). ''Legacy: Cecil Rhodes, the Rhodes Trust and Rhodes Scholarships''. Yale: Yale University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-300-11835-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cape of Good Hope remained nominally under British rule until the formation of the [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910, when it became the Province of the Cape of Good Hope, better known as the [[Cape Province]].

The '''Union of South Africa''' ({{lang-nl|Unie van Zuid-Afrika}}; {{lang-af|Unie van Suid-Afrika}} {{audio|Nl-UnionofSouthAfrica.ogg|pronunciation}}) is the historical predecessor to the present-day [[South Africa|Republic of South Africa]]. It came into being on 31 May 1910 with the unification of the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]], the [[Colony of Natal|Natal Colony]], the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]], and the [[Orange River Colony]]. It included the territories that were formerly a part of the [[South African Republic]] and the [[Orange Free State]].

Following the [[First World War]], the Union of South Africa was a signatory of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and became one of the [[Member states of the League of Nations|founding members]] of the [[League of Nations]]. It was conferred the administration of [[South West Africa]] (now known as [[Namibia]]) as a [[League of Nations mandate]]. It became treated in most respects as another province of the Union, but it never was formally annexed.

Like [[Canada]] and [[Australia]], the Union of South Africa was a [[Associated state|self-governing]] [[dominion]] of the [[British Empire]]. Its full sovereignty was confirmed with the [[Balfour Declaration 1926]] and the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]]. It was governed under a form of [[constitutional monarchy]], with the Crown being represented by a governor-general. The Union came to an end with the enactment of the [[Constitution of South Africa, 1961|constitution of 1961]], by which it became a [[republic]] and left the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].

===Main features===
[[File:Map of the provinces of South Africa 1910-1976 with English labels.svg|thumb|The provinces of the Union]]

The Union of South Africa was a [[unitary state]], rather than a [[federation]] like Canada and Australia, with each colony's parliaments being abolished and replaced with [[provincial council (South Africa)|provincial council]]s.&lt;ref&gt;South Africa Act, 1909, Part V, sections 68 to 94.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[bicameral]] [[parliament]] was created, consisting of the [[House of Assembly (South Africa)|House of Assembly]] and [[Senate (South Africa)|Senate]], with members of the parliament being elected mostly by the country's white minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/details/jstor-2212266|title=The South Africa Act, 1909|date=1 January 1910|journal=The American Journal of International Law|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of the Union, the franchise changed on several occasions always to suit the needs of the government of the day.&lt;ref&gt;See Representation of Natives Act, No. 12 of 1936 and Separate Representation of Voters Act, No. 46 of 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; Parliamentary supremacy was a convention of the constitution, inherited from the United Kingdom; save for procedural safeguards in respect of the entrenched sections of franchise and language, the courts were unable to intervene in Parliament's decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Hahlo &amp; Kahn, Union of South Africa, Stevens &amp; Sons Limited, London, 1960, pp. 146 to 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capitals===

Owing to disagreements over where the Union's [[capital (city)|capital]] should be, a compromise was reached in which every province would be dealt a share of the benefits of the capital:  the administration would be seated in [[Pretoria]]&lt;ref&gt;Section 18 of South Africa Act, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; (Transvaal), [[Parliament (South Africa)|Parliament]] would be in [[Cape Town]]&lt;ref&gt;Section 23 of South Africa Act, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; (Cape Province), the [[Appellate Division (South Africa)|Appellate Division]] would be in [[Bloemfontein]]&lt;ref&gt;Section 109 of South Africa Act, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; (Orange Free State). Bloemfontein and [[Pietermaritzburg]] (Natal) were given financial compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/details/jstor-2212266|title=The South Africa Act, 1909|date=1 January 1910|journal=The American Journal of International Law|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship to the Crown===

The Union initially remained under the [[British monarchy|British Crown]] as a self-governing [[dominion]] of the [[British Empire]].  With the passage of the [[Statute of Westminster (1931)|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931, the Union and other dominions became equal in status to the United Kingdom, and the Parliament of the United Kingdom could no longer legislate on behalf of them.&lt;ref&gt;Hahlo &amp; Kahn, supra, p. 146 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; This had the effect of making the Union and the other dominions ''de jure'' sovereign nations. The [[Status of the Union Act, 1934|Status of the Union Act]], passed by the South African Parliament in 1934, incorporated the applicable portions of the Statute of Westminster into South African law, underscoring its status as a sovereign nation. It removed what remaining authority Whitehall had to legislate for South Africa, as well as any nominal role that the Crown had in granting [[Royal Assent]]. The Governor-General was now required to sign or veto bills passed by Parliament, without the option of seeking advice from London.

In the [[United States]], '''Social Security''' is the commonly used term for the [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] '''Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance''' ('''OASDI''') program and is administered by the [[Social Security Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;Social Security Administration, [https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/progdesc/sspus/oasdi.pdf Social Insurance Programs], retrieved 1 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The original [[Social Security Act]] was signed into law by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1935,&lt;ref name=&quot;Social Security Act of 1935&quot;&gt;Social Security Act of 1935 {{cite web|title=Legislative History 1935 Social Security Act | url=http://www.socialsecurity.gov/history/35actinx.html|access-date=8 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the current version of the Act, as amended,&lt;ref name=&quot;42 USC&quot;&gt;[42 USC 7] {{cite web|title=US Code—Title 42—The Public Health and Welfare|url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/uscode/title42/chapter7_.html|access-date=8 November 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012002738/http://www.access.gpo.gov/uscode/title42/chapter7_.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archive-date=12 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; encompasses several social [[welfare]] and [[social insurance]] programs.

Social Security is funded primarily through [[payroll tax]]es called [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax]] (FICA) or Self Employed Contributions Act Tax (SECA). Tax deposits are collected by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and are formally entrusted to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, the two [[Social Security Trust Fund]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;42 USC 401&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=42 USC 401, Trust Funds|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/401-|access-date=8 November 2006}}four&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morton|first1=William R.|last2=Liou|first2=Wayne|title=Social Security: The Trust Funds|date=12 September 2017|publisher=Congressional Research Service|location=Washington, DC|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33028.pdf|access-date=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two trust funds purchase government securities, the interest income from which is used presently to fund the monthly allocations to qualifying citizens. With a few exceptions, all salaried income, up to an amount specifically determined by law (see tax rate table below), is subject to the Social Security payroll tax. All income over said amount is not taxed. In 2020, the maximum amount of taxable earnings is $137,700.&lt;ref name=&quot;United States Social Security Administration&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=United States Social Security Administration|title=Contribution and Benefit Base|url=http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/cbb.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With few exceptions, all legal residents working in the United States now have an individual Social Security number. Indeed, nearly all working (and many non-working) residents since Social Security's 1935 inception have had a Social Security number because it is requested by a wide range of businesses.

In 2017, Social Security expenditures totaled $806.7 billion for OASDI and $145.8 billion for DI.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehouse.gov&quot;&gt;[https://www.ssa.gov/oact/trsum/ A SUMMARY OF THE 2018 ANNUAL REPORTS], Social Security and Medicare Boards of Trustees

A limited form of the Social Security program began, during [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Franklin D. Roosevelt's]] first term, as a measure to implement &quot;[[Social security|social insurance]]&quot; during the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s.&lt;ref name=&quot;college.hmco.com.653&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=A Reader's Companion to American History: Poverty | url=http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/rcah/html/ah_070900_poverty.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210081706/http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/rcah/html/ah_070900_poverty.htm |archive-date=February 10, 2006 |access-date=June 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act was an attempt to limit unforeseen and unprepared-for dangers in modern life, including old age, disability, poverty, unemployment, and the burdens of widow(er)s with and without children.

Opponents, however, decried the proposal as socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Finance, Business, Economics: Huge Old-Age Reserve Fund Under Doughton Bill Gives Treasury Extensive New Financial Powers; Could Be Used to Control Credit Also |work= The Washington Post |date= April 25, 1935 |page= 23 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/150734868/|quote= The social security bill, in its present form, is thus not only a sweeping piece of legislation, but also a far-reaching financial measure. To have investments available for such large reserve funds, the Treasury will have to keep as much of its debt as possible in short-dated maturities, so that securities can be provided by the Old-Age Reserve Account. The existence of this huge reserve, furthermore, will constantly encourage resort to venture in State Socialism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Security Bill's Passage Held Likely Monday: Hastings and Long Assail Measure; Few Changes Are Expected |first= Robert C. |last= Albright |work= The Washington Post |date= June 15, 1935 |page= 2 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/150634350/ |quote= &quot;Senator [[Frederick Hale (US senator)|Frederick Hale]] (Republican), Maine, assailed the [Social Security] bill incidentally in the course of a speech in which he said President Roosevelt is filling Washington with 'socialistic agencies.'

Its credit relief, social security and such unemployment relief devices as the Civilian Conservation Corps are not likely to become the target for oratorical attack. But its State socialism plans and its anti-constitutional regimentation laws apparently will come in for an avalanche of opposition from groups of both parties.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Senate Finance Committee hearing, Senator [[Thomas Gore]] (D-OK) asked [[Secretary of Labor]] [[Frances Perkins]], &quot;Isn't this socialism?&quot; She said that it was not, but he continued, &quot;Isn't this a teeny-weeny bit of socialism?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Altman, Nancy J. (August 14, 2009), [http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/14/opinion/oe-altman14/ President Barack Obama could learn from Franklin D. Roosevelt] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', October 27, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The provisions of Social Security have been changing since the 1930s, shifting in response to economic worries as well as coverage for the poor, dependent children, spouses, survivors and the disabled.&lt;ref&gt;Achenbaum, Andrew. Social Security Visions and Revisions, 1986. p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1950, debates moved away from which occupational groups should be included to get enough taxpayers to fund Social Security to how to provide more benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler-Harris, Alice. In Pursuit of Equity, 2001. p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in Social Security have reflected a balance between promoting &quot;equality&quot; and efforts to provide &quot;adequate&quot; and affordable protection for low wage workers.&lt;ref&gt;Achenbaum 1986. p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest component of OASDI is the payment of [[retirement]] benefits. These retirement benefits are a form of social insurance that is heavily biased toward lower paid workers to make sure they do not have to retire in relative poverty. With few exceptions, throughout a worker's career, the Social Security Administration and the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) keeps track of his or her earnings and requires Federal Insurance Contribution Act, [[FICA]] or Self Employed Contribution Act, SECA, taxes to be paid on the earnings. The OASI accounts plus trust funds are the only Social Security funding source that brings in more than it sends out.

Social Security revenues exceeded expenditures between 1983 and 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;''[http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/43648-SocialSecurity.pdf The 2012 Long-Term Projections for Social Security]'', [[Congressional Budget Office]], October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The disability insurance (DI) taxes of 1.4% are included in the OASDI rate of 6.2% for workers and employers or 12.4% for the self-employed. Outgo of $140.3 billion while having income of only $109.1 billion means the disability trust fund is rapidly being depleted and may require either revisions on what &quot;disabilities&quot; are included/allowed/defined as, fraud minimization, or tax increases.

The Medicare hospital insurance, HI (Part A: Hospital Insurance, inpatient care, skilled nursing facility care, home health care, and hospice care), expenditure rate of $266.8 billion in 2012—while bringing in only $243.0 billion—means that the Medicare HI trust funds are being seriously depleted and increased taxes or reduced coverage will be required. The additional retirees expected under the &quot;baby boom bulge&quot; will hasten this trust fund depletion. Medicare expenses, tied to medical costs growth rates, have traditionally increased much faster than GDP growth rates.&lt;ref name=&quot;cms.gov&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.cms.gov/fastfacts/ Medicare fast facts]&quot;, accessed November 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supplementary Medical Insurance, SMI (otherwise known as Medicare Part B &amp; D), expenditure rate of $307.4 billion in 2012 while bringing in only $293.9 billion means that the Supplementary Medical Insurance trust funds are also being seriously depleted and increased tax rates or reduced coverage will be required. The additional retirees expected under the &quot;baby boom bulge&quot; will hasten this trust fund depletion as well as legislation to end the Medicare Part D medical prescription drug funding &quot;donut hole&quot; are all tied to medical costs growth rates, which have traditionally increased much faster than GDP growth rates.&lt;ref name=&quot;cms.gov&quot; /&gt;

For workers the [[Social Security tax]] rate is 6.2% on income under $127,200 through the end of 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;United States Social Security Administration&quot;/&gt; The worker Medicare tax rate is 1.45% of all income—employers pay another 1.45%. Employers pay 6.2% up to the wage ceiling and the Medicare tax of 1.45 percent on all income. Workers defined as &quot;self employed&quot; pay 12.4% on income under $113,700 and a 2.9% Medicare tax on all income.

The amount of the monthly Social Security benefit to which a worker is entitled depends upon the earnings record they have paid FICA or SECA taxes on and upon the age at which the retiree chooses to begin receiving benefits.

===Primary Insurance Amount and benefit calculations===
{{Main|Primary Insurance Amount}}

All workers paying [[FICA]] ([[Federal Insurance Contributions Act]]) and SECA (Self Employed Contributions Act) taxes for forty quarters of coverage (QC) or more on a specified minimum income or more are &quot;fully insured&quot; and eligible to retire at age 62 with reduced benefits and higher benefits at full retirement ages, FRA, of 65, 66 or 67 depending on birth date.&lt;ref name=&quot;socialsecuritypotluckdotcom.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Minimum salary needed for Social Security vesting|url=http://socialsecuritypotluckdotcom.wordpress.com/2010/08/20/question-1-when-does-one-become-fully-vested-in-social-security/|access-date=November 7, 2013|date=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retirement benefits depend upon the &quot;adjusted&quot; average wage earned in the last 35 years. Wages of earlier years are &quot;adjusted&quot; before averaging by multiplying each annual salary by an annual adjusted wage index factor, AWI, for earlier salaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;ssa.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Retirement Benefit: How It's Figured|url=http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10070.pdf|access-date=October 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adjusted wages for 35 years are always used to compute the 35 year &quot;average&quot; indexed monthly salary. Only wages lower than the &quot;ceiling&quot; income are considered in calculating the adjusted average wage. If the worker has fewer than 35 years of covered earnings these non-contributory years are assigned zero earnings. If there are more than 35 years of covered earnings only the highest 35 are considered. The sum of the 35 adjusted salaries (or less if worker has less than 35 years of covered income) times its inflation index, AWI divided by 420 (35 years x 12 months per year) gives the 35-year covered Average Indexed Monthly salary, [[Average Indexed Monthly Earnings|AIME]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ssa.gov&quot; /&gt;

To calculate the total benefits a retiree is eligible for, the average indexed monthly salary (AIME) is then divided into three separate salary brackets—each multiplied by a different benefit percentage. The benefits receivable (the so-called Primary Insurance Amount, PIA) are the sum of the salary in each bracket times the benefit percentages that apply to each bracket. The benefit percentages are set by Congress and so can easily change in the future. The ''bendpoints'', where the brackets change, are adjusted for inflation each year by Social Security. For example, in 2013 the first bracket runs from $1 to $791/month and is multiplied by the benefit percentage of 90%, the second salary bracket extends from $791 to $4,781/month is multiplied by 32%, the third salary bracket of more than $4,781/month is multiplied by 15%. Any higher incomes than the ceiling income are not FICA covered and are not considered in the benefits calculation or in determining the average indexed monthly salary, AIME. At full retirement age the projected retirement income amount (PIA) is the sum of these three brackets of income multiplied by the appropriate benefit percentages—90%, 32% and 15%. Unlike income tax brackets, the Social Security benefits are heavily biased towards lower salaried workers. Social Security has always been primarily a retirement, disability and spousal insurance policy for low wage workers and a very poor retirement plan for higher salaried workers who hopefully have a supplemental retirement plan unless they want to live on significantly less after retirement than they used to earn.

Full retirement age spouses and divorced spouses ([https://www.simplywise.com/blog/social-security-benefits-for-divorced-spouses/ who were married for at least 10 years before divorce to a worker who is eligible]) are entitled to the higher of 50% of the wage earners benefits or their own earned benefits. A low salary worker and his full retirement age spouse making less than or equal to $791/month with 40 quarters of employment credit and at full retirement age (65 if born before 1938, 66 if born from 1938 to 1954 and 67 if born after 1960) could retire with 135% of his indexed average salary. A full retirement age worker and his full retirement age spouse making the ceiling income or more would be eligible for 43% of the ceiling FICA salary (29% if single) and even less if making more than the ceiling income.

During working years, the low wage worker is eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit (FICA refunds) and federal child credits and may pay little or no FICA tax or Income tax. By Congressional Budget Office (CBO) calculations the lowest income quintile (0–20%) and second quintile (21–40%) of households in the U.S. pay an average income tax of −9.3% and −2.6% and Social Security taxes of 8.3% and 7.9% respectively. By CBO calculations the household incomes in the first quintile and second quintile have an '''average Total Federal Tax rate''' of 1.0% and 3.8% respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbo.gov&quot;&gt;The Distribution of Household Income and Federal Taxes, 2008 and 2009, Supplemental Tables; Table 1 [http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43373] accessed October 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Higher income retirees will have to pay income taxes on 85% of their Social Security benefits and 100% on all other retirement benefits they may have.&lt;ref name=&quot;ssa.gov&quot; /&gt;

All workers paying FICA and SECA taxes for forty quarters of credit (QC) or more on a specified minimum income is &quot;fully insured&quot; and eligible to retire at age 62 with reduced benefits.&lt;ref name=&quot;socialsecuritypotluckdotcom.wordpress.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Social Security &quot;fully insured&quot; status [http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title02/0214.htm] accessed November 7, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In general the Social Security Administration tries to limit the projected lifetime benefits to the same amounts of retirement income the recipient would receive if retiring at full retirement age. If a recipient retires earlier he/she draws a lower Social Security benefit income for a longer prospective lifetime after retirement. The basic correction of benefits are age 62 retirees can only draw 75% of what they would draw at full retirement age with higher percentages at different ages more than 62 and less than full retirement age.

Similar computations based on career average adjusted earnings and age of recipient determine disability and survivor benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://actionecon.com/know-social-security-benefits/|title=7 Steps To Optimize Your Social Security Benefits|work=Action Economics|access-date=September 1, 2015|date=April 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal, state and local employees who have elected (when they could) NOT to pay FICA taxes are eligible for a reduced FICA benefits and full Medicare coverage if they have more than forty quarters of qualifying Social Security covered work.&lt;ref name=&quot;socialsecuritypotluckdotcom.wordpress.com&quot; /&gt; To minimize the Social Security payments to those who have not contributed to FICA for 35+ years and are eligible for federal, state and local benefits, which are usually more generous, Congress passed the Windfall Elimination Provision, WEP.&lt;ref&gt;Windfall Elimination Provision [http://www.socialsecurity.gov/pubs/EN-05-10045.pdf] accessed October 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The WEP provision will not eliminate all Social Security or Medicare eligibility if the worker has 40 quarters of qualifying income, but calculates the benefit payments by reducing the 90% multiplier in the first PIA  bendpoint to 40–85% depending on the number of Years of Coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10045.pdf|title=WEP Factsheet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign pensions are subject to WEP.

To be eligible the recipient along with their auxiliaries and survivors must have very low assets and not be eligible for other retirement system benefits. About 75,000 people in 2013 receive this benefit.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Special Minimum Benefit [http://www.ssa.gov/retirementpolicy/projections/special-minimum.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192643/http://www.ssa.gov/retirementpolicy/projections/special-minimum.html |date=October 29, 2013 }} accessed October 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The benefits someone is eligible for are potentially so complicated that potential retirees should consult the Social Security Administration directly for advice. Many questions are addressed and at least partially answered on many online publications and online calculators.
{{Main|Retirement Insurance Benefits}}

===Online benefits estimate===
On July 22, 2008, the Social Security Administration introduced a new online benefits estimator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/estimator/ |title=Retirement Estimator |publisher=Ssa.gov |date=July 25, 2011 |access-date=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Taylor| first = Andrew| title = Social Security unveils new earnings calculator| newspaper = [[USA Today]]| date = July 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A worker who has enough Social Security credits to qualify for benefits, but who is not currently receiving benefits on his or her own Social Security record and who is not a Medicare beneficiary, can obtain an estimate of the retirement benefit that will be provided, for different assumptions about age at retirement. This process is done by opening a secure online account called ''my Social Security.'' For retirees who have non FICA or SECA taxed wages the rules get complicated and probably require additional help.

===Normal retirement age===
The earliest age at which (reduced) benefits are payable is 62. Full retirement benefits depend on a retiree's year of birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/ProgData/nra.html| title=Normal Retirement Age| date=September 19, 2005| access-date= May 14, 2006| publisher= [[Social Security Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This table was copied in November 2011 from the Social Security Administration web site cited above and referenced in the footnotes. There are different rules for widows and widowers. Also from that site, come the following two notes:
Notes:
1. Persons born on January 1 of any year should refer to the normal retirement age for the previous year.
2. For the purpose of determining benefit reductions for early retirement, widows and widowers whose entitlement is based on having attained age 60 should add 2 years to the year of birth shown in the table.

Those born before 1938 have a normal retirement age of 65. Normal retirement age increases by two months for each ensuing year of birth until 1943, when it reaches 66 and stays at 66 until 1955. Thereafter the normal retirement age increases again by two months for each year until 1960, when normal retirement age is 67 and remains 67 for all individuals born thereafter.

A worker who starts benefits before normal retirement age has their benefit reduced based on the number of months before normal retirement age they start benefits. This reduction is 5/9 of 1% for each month up to 36 and then 5/12 of 1% for each additional month. This formula gives an 80% benefit at age 62 for a worker with a normal retirement age of 65, a 75% benefit at age 62 for a worker with a normal retirement age of 66, and a 70% benefit at age 62 for a worker with a normal retirement age of 67. The [[Great Recession]] has resulted in an increase in [[long-term unemployment]] and an increase in workers taking [[early retirement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT62&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Forced to Early Social Security, Unemployed Pay a Steep Price|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/10/business/forced-to-retire-early-jobless-pay-a-steep-price.html|access-date=June 10, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 9, 2012|author=Motoko Rich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A worker who delays starting retirement benefits past normal retirement age earns delayed retirement credits that increase their benefit until they reach age 70. These credits are also applied to their widow(er)'s benefit. Children and spouse benefits are not affected by these credits.

The normal retirement age for widow(er) benefits shifts the year-of-birth schedule upward by two years, so that those widow(er)s born before 1940 have age 65 as their normal retirement age.

===Spouse's benefit and government pension offsets===
The spousal ''retirement benefit'' is ''one-half'' the ''PIA'' benefit amount of their spouse or their own earned benefits, whichever is higher, if they both retire at &quot;normal&quot; retirement ages. Only after the working spouse applies for retirement benefits may the non-working spouse apply for spousal retirement benefits. The spousal benefit is the PIA times an &quot;early-retirement factor&quot; if the spouse is younger than the &quot;normal&quot; full retirement age. The '''early-retirement factor''' is 50% minus 25/36 of 1% per month for the first 36 months and 5/12 of 1% for each additional month earlier than the &quot;normal&quot; full retirement date. This typically works out to between 50% and 32.5% of the primary workers PIA benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Benefit Reduction for Early Retirement [http://www.ssa.gov/oact/quickcalc/earlyretire.html] accessed November 6, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; There is no increase for starting spousal benefits ''after'' full retirement age. A spouse is eligible, after a one-year duration of marriage is met and [[divorced]] or former spouses are eligible for spousal benefits if the marriage lasted for at least 10 years and the person applying is not currently married. It is [[arithmetic]]ally possible for one worker to generate spousal benefits for up to five of his/her spouses that he/she may have, each must be in succession after a proper divorce for each after a marriage that lasted at least ten years each.

There is a '''Social Security government pension offset'''&lt;ref&gt;Social Security Government pension offset [http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10007.pdf] accessed November 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; that will reduce or eliminate any spousal (or ex-spouse) or widow(er)'s benefits if the spouse or widow(er) is also receiving a government (federal, state, or local) pension that did not require paying Social Security taxes. The basic rule is that Social Security benefits will be reduced by 2/3's of the spouse or widow(er)'s non-FICA taxed government pension. If the spouse's or widow(er)'s government (non-FICA paying) pension exceeds 150% of the &quot;normal&quot; spousal or widow(er)'s benefit the spousal benefit is eliminated. For example, a &quot;normal&quot; spousal or widow(er)'s benefit of $1,000/month would be reduced to $0.00 if the spouse or widow(er)'s if already drawing a non-FICA taxed government pension of $1,500/month or more per month. Pensions not based on income do not reduce Social Security spousal or widow(er)'s benefits. Pensions received from foreign countries do not cause GPO; however, a foreign pension may be subject to the WEP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/lnx/0200307290|title=SSA - POMS: GN 00307.290 - Evidence of Foreign Pensions and the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) - 06/04/2015|website=secure.ssa.gov|access-date=2019-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage of the '''Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act''', in 2000, allows the worker to earn unlimited outside income without offsets in the year after they reach full retirement. It also allows the spouse and children of a worker who has reached normal full retirement age to receive benefits under some circumstances while he/she does not. The full retirement age worker must have begun the receipt of benefits, to allow the spousal/children's benefits to begin, and then subsequently suspended their own benefits in order to continue the postponement of benefits in exchange for an increased benefit amount (5.5–8.0%/yr increase)&lt;ref name=&quot;socialsecurity.gov&quot;&gt;Delayed Retirement Credits [http://www.socialsecurity.gov/retire2/delayret.htm] accessed November 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; up to the age of 70. Thus a worker can delay retirement up to age seventy without affecting spousal or children's benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act [http://www.ssa.gov/legislation/legis_bulletin_040700.html] accessed November 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

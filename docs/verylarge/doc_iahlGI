In the spring of 1916, Lawrence was dispatched to Mesopotamia to assist in relieving the [[Siege of Kut]] by some combination of starting an Arab uprising and bribing Ottoman officials.  This mission produced no useful result.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, pp. 256–276.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the [[Sykes–Picot Agreement]] was being negotiated in London without the knowledge of British officials in Cairo, which awarded a large proportion of Syria to France. Further, it implied that the Arabs would have to conquer Syria's four great cities if they were to have any sort of state there: [[Damascus]], [[Homs]], [[Hama]], and [[Aleppo]]. It is unclear at what point Lawrence became aware of the treaty's contents.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 313. In note 24, Wilson argues that Lawrence must have known about Sykes-Picot prior to his relationship with Faisal, contrary to a later statement.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arab Revolt==
{{Main|Arab Revolt}}
[[File:Ljidda.jpg|thumb|upright|Lawrence at [[Rabigh]], north of [[Jeddah]], 1917]]

The [[Arab Revolt]] began in June 1916, but it bogged down after a few successes, with a real risk that the Ottoman forces would advance along the coast of the Red Sea and recapture Mecca.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 October 1916, Lawrence was sent to the Hejaz on an intelligence-gathering mission led by [[Ronald Storrs]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; He interviewed Sharif Hussein's sons [[Ali of Hejaz|Ali]], [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah]], and [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal]],&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 307–311.&lt;/ref&gt; and he concluded that Faisal was the best candidate to lead the Revolt.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November, [[S. F. Newcombe]] was assigned to lead a permanent British liaison to Faisal's staff.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; Newcombe had not yet arrived in the area and the matter was of some urgency, so Lawrence was sent in his place.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; In late December 1916, Faisal and Lawrence worked out a plan for repositioning the Arab forces to prevent the Ottoman forces around Medina from threatening Arab positions and putting the railway from Syria under threat.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 347. Also see note 43, where the origin of the repositioning idea is examined closely.&lt;/ref&gt; Newcombe arrived and Lawrence was preparing to leave Arabia, but Faisal intervened urgently, asking that Lawrence's assignment become permanent.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence's most important contributions to the Arab Revolt were in the area of strategy and liaison with British armed forces, but he also participated personally in several military engagements:

* 3 January 1917: Attack on an Ottoman outpost in the [[Hejaz]]&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 348&lt;/ref&gt;
* 26 March 1917: Attack on the railway at Aba el Naam&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|last=Alleyne|first=Richard|title=Garland of Arabia: the forgotten story of TE Lawrence's brother-in-arms|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/7918929/Garland-of-Arabia-the-forgotten-story-of-TE-Lawrences-brother-in-arms.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=29 March 2014|date=30 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 7 November 1917: Following a failed attack on the [[Yarmouk River|Yarmuk]] bridges, blew up a train on the railway between [[Dera'a]] and [[Amman]], suffering several wounds in the explosion and ensuing combat&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, pp. 455–457.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 23 January 1918: The battle of [[Tafileh]], a region southeast of the [[Dead Sea]], with Arab regulars under the command of [[Jafar Pasha al-Askari]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Mack&quot;&gt;Mack, 1976, pp. 158, 161.&lt;/ref&gt; the battle was a defensive engagement that turned into an offensive rout&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, ''7 Pillars (1922)'', pp. 537–546.&lt;/ref&gt; and was described in the official history of the war as a &quot;brilliant feat of arms&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mack&quot;/&gt; Lawrence was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for his leadership at Tafileh and was promoted to lieutenant colonel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mack&quot;/&gt;
* March 1918: Attack on the railway near Aqaba&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 495.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 19 April 1918: Attack using British armoured cars on Tell Shahm&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 498.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 16 September 1918: Destruction of railway bridge between Amman and Dera'a&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 546.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 26 September 1918: Attack on retreating Ottomans and Germans near the village of [[Tafas]]; the Ottoman forces massacred the villagers and then Arab forces in return massacred their prisoners with Lawrence's encouragement.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, pp. 556–557.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence made a 300-mile personal journey northward in June 1917, on the way to Aqaba, visiting [[Ras Baalbek]], the outskirts of Damascus, and [[Azraq, Jordan]].  He met Arab nationalists, counselling them to avoid revolt until the arrival of Faisal's forces, and he attacked a bridge to create the impression of guerrilla activity. His findings were regarded by the British as extremely valuable and there was serious consideration of awarding him a [[Victoria Cross]]; in the end, he was invested as a Companion of the [[Order of the Bath]] and promoted to Major.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, pp. 424–425.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence travelled regularly between British headquarters and Faisal, co-ordinating military action.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 491.&lt;/ref&gt; But by early 1918, Faisal's chief British liaison was Colonel Pierce Charles Joyce, and Lawrence's time was chiefly devoted to raiding and intelligence-gathering.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1918, p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Strategy===
The chief elements of the Arab strategy which Faisal and Lawrence developed were to avoid capturing [[Medina]], and to extend northwards through Maan and Dera'a to Damascus and beyond. Faisal wanted to lead regular attacks against the Ottomans, but Lawrence persuaded him to drop that tactic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morsey pages 185&quot;&gt;Morsey, Konrad &quot;T.E. Lawrence: Strategist&quot; pages 185–203 from ''The T.E. Lawrence Puzzle'' edited by Stephen Tabachnick, Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984 page 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence wrote about the Bedouin as a fighting force:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The value of the tribes is defensive only and their real sphere is guerilla warfare. They are intelligent, and very lively, almost reckless, but too individualistic to endure commands, or fight in line, or to help each other. It would, I think, be possible to make an organized force out of them.… The Hejaz war is one of dervishes against regular forces—and we are on the side of the dervishes. Our text-books do not apply to its conditions at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morsey pages 185&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Medina was an attractive target for the revolt as Islam's second holiest site, and because its Ottoman garrison was weakened by disease and isolation.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt;  It became clear that it was advantageous to leave it there rather than try to capture it, while continually attacking the [[Hejaz railway]] south from Damascus without permanently destroying it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy, David 2008 page 36&quot;&gt;Murphy, David (2008). &quot;The Arab Revolt 1916–1918&quot;, London: Osprey, 2008 page 36.&lt;/ref&gt; This prevented the Ottomans from making effective use of their troops at Medina, and forced them to dedicate many resources to defending and repairing the railway line.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 329 describes a very early argument for letting the Ottomans stay in Medina in a November 1916 letter from Clayton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, pp. 383–384 describes Lawrence's arrival at this conclusion. However, Aldington 1955 disagrees strongly with the value of the strategy, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy, David 2008 page 36&quot;/&gt;  

It is not known when Lawrence learned the details of the [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]], nor if or when he briefed Faisal on what he knew,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, pp. 361–362 argues that Lawrence knew the details and briefed Faisal in February 1917.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 444. shows Lawrence definitely knew of Sykes-Picot in September 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is good reason to think that both these things happened, and earlier rather than later.  In particular, the Arab strategy of northward extension makes perfect sense given the Sykes-Picot language that spoke of an independent Arab entity in Syria, which would only be granted if the Arabs liberated the territory themselves.  The French, and some of their British Liaison officers, were specifically uncomfortable about the northward movement, as it would weaken French colonial claims.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, pp. 390–391.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- (encyclopedic, but needs to go somewhere else) In December 1926 Lawrence obtained assistance from the [[Royal Navy]] to turn back an Ottoman attack on [[Yanbu]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Parnell&quot;&gt;Parnell, Charles L., CDR USN &quot;Lawrence of Arabia's Debt to Seapower&quot; US Naval Institute Proceedings (August 1979) pp. 76, 78&lt;/ref&gt;  --&gt;

===Capture of Aqaba===
{{Main|Battle of Aqaba}}
[[File:Lcamel.jpg|thumb|upright|Lawrence at [[Aqaba]], 1917]]

In 1917, Lawrence proposed a joint action with the Arab [[Irregular military|irregulars]] and forces including [[Auda Abu Tayi]], who had previously been in the employ of the Ottomans, against the strategically located but lightly defended&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The bombardment of Akaba.&quot; ''The Naval Review''. Volume IV. 1916. pp. 101–103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Egyptian Expeditionary Force&quot;. ''Operations in the Gulf of Akaba, Red Sea HMS ''Raven'' II''. July—August 1916. National Archives, Kew London. File: AIR 1 /2284/ 209/75/8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Naval Operation in the Red Sea 1916—1917&quot;. ''The Naval Review'', Volume XIII, no.4 (1925). pp. 648–666.&lt;/ref&gt; town of [[Aqaba]] on the Red Sea. Aqaba could have been attacked from the sea, but the narrow defiles leading through the mountains were strongly defended and would have been very difficult to assault.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, 1934, p. 161. &quot;Akaba was so strongly protected by the hills, elaborately fortified for miles back, that if a landing were attempted from the sea a small Turkish force could hold up a whole Allied division in the defiles.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition was led by Sharif Nasir of Medina.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence carefully avoided informing his British superiors about the details of the planned inland attack, due to concern that it would be blocked as contrary to French interests.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition departed from [[Wejh]] on 9 May,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; and Aqaba fell to the Arab forces on 6 July, after a surprise overland attack which took the Turkish defences from behind. After Aqaba, [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Sir Edmund Allenby]], the new commander-in-chief of the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]], agreed to Lawrence's strategy for the revolt. Lawrence now held a powerful position as an adviser to Faisal and a person who had Allenby's confidence, as Allenby acknowledged after the war:

{{quote|I gave him a free hand. His cooperation was marked by the utmost loyalty, and I never had anything but praise for his work, which, indeed, was invaluable throughout the campaign. He was the mainspring of the Arab movement and knew their language, their manners and their mentality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1935/may/19/fromthearchive &quot;Strategist of the Desert Dies in Military Hospital&quot;.]  ''The Guardian''. Retrieved 16 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Dera'a===
Lawrence describes an episode on 20 November 1917 while reconnoitering [[Daraa|Dera'a]] in disguise, when he was captured by the Ottoman military, heavily beaten, and sexually abused by the local [[bey]] and his guardsmen,&lt;ref&gt;Letter to W.F. Stirling, Deputy Chief Political Officer, Cairo, 28 June 1919, in Brown, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; though he does not specify the nature of the sexual contact.  Some scholars have stated that he exaggerated the severity of the injuries that he suffered,&lt;ref&gt;Mack, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; or alleged that the episode never actually happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Mack]], and [[Jeremy Wilson]] have argued that this episode had strong psychological effects on Lawrence, which may explain some of his unconventional behaviour in later life. Lawrence ended his account of the episode in ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' with the statement: &quot;In Dera'a that night the citadel of my integrity had been irrevocably lost.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, T. E. (1935). ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom'', Jonathan Cape, p. 447&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fall of Damascus===
[[File:With Lawrence in Arabia.jpg|thumb|upright|Lawrence in 1919]]

Lawrence was involved in the build-up to the capture of [[Damascus]] in the final weeks of the war, but he was not present at the city's formal surrender, much to his disappointment. He arrived several hours after the city had fallen, entering Damascus around 9&amp;nbsp;am on 1 October 1918; the first to arrive was the 10th Australian Light Horse Brigade led by Major A. C. N. &quot;Harry&quot; Olden, who formally accepted the surrender of the city from acting Governor Emir Said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Barker, A|year=1998 |title =The Allies Enter Damascus|journal= History Today| volume= 48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence was instrumental in establishing a provisional Arab government under Faisal in newly liberated Damascus, which he had envisioned as the capital of an Arab state. Faisal's rule as king, however, came to an abrupt end in 1920, after the [[battle of Maysaloun]] when the French Forces of [[Henri Gouraud (French Army officer)|General Gouraud]] entered Damascus under the command of General [[Mariano Goybet]], destroying Lawrence's dream of an independent Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;Eliezer Tauber. The Formation of Modern Syria and Iraq. Frank Cass and Co. Ltd. Portland, Oregon. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the closing years of the war, Lawrence sought to convince his superiors in the British government that Arab independence was in their interests, but he met with mixed success. The secret [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]] between France and Britain contradicted the promises of independence that he had made to the Arabs and frustrated his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00qgtjk/The_Legacy_of_Lawrence_of_Arabia_Episode_2/|title=The Legacy of Lawrence of Arabia|volume=2|people=Rory Stewart (presenter)|publisher=BBC|date=23 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war years==
Lawrence returned to the United Kingdom a full colonel.&lt;ref&gt;Asher, 1998, p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the war, he worked for the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]], attending the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] between January and May as a member of Faisal's delegation. On 17 May 1919, a [[Handley Page Type O/400]] taking Lawrence to Egypt crashed at the airport of [[Centocelle Airport|Roma-Centocelle]]. The pilot and co-pilot were killed; Lawrence survived with a broken shoulder blade and two broken ribs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protestantcemetery.it/press/webnewsletter-eng/no5-2008.pdf|title=Newsletter: Friends of the Protestant Cemetery|location=Rome|year=2008|website=protestantcemetery.it|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66WbaWVSO?url=http://www.protestantcemetery.it/press/webnewsletter-eng/no5-2008.pdf|archivedate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his brief hospitalisation, he was visited by King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;RID Marzo 2012, ''Storia dell'Handley'' Page type 0&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lawrence of Arabia's map, presented to the Eastern Committee of the War Cabinet in November 1918.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Map presented by Lawrence to the [[Eastern Committee]] of the War Cabinet in November 1918&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4332702.stm|title=UK – Lawrence's Mid-East map on show|date=11 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 1918, [[Lowell Thomas]] went to Jerusalem where he met Lawrence, &quot;whose enigmatic figure in Arab uniform fired his imagination&quot;, in the words of author Rex Hall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall, Rex 1975 120–121&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author = Hall, Rex | date=1975| title= The Desert Hath Pearls| location=Melbourne| publisher= Hawthorn Press| pages= 120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas and his cameraman Harry Chase shot a great deal of film and many photographs involving Lawrence. Thomas produced a stage presentation entitled ''With Allenby in Palestine'' which included a lecture, dancing, and music&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy, David 2008, page 86&quot;&gt;Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916–18'', London: Osprey, 2008, page 86&lt;/ref&gt; and engaged in &quot;[[Orientalism]]&quot;, depicting the Middle East as exotic, mysterious, sensuous, and violent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy, David 2008, page 86&quot;/&gt;
The show premiered in New York in March 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Aldington, 1955, p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; He was invited to take his show to England, and he agreed to do so provided that he was personally invited by the King and provided the use of either [[Drury Lane]] or [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]]. He opened at Covent Garden on 14 August 1919 and continued for hundreds of lectures, &quot;attended by the highest in the land&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall, Rex 1975 120–121&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aldington, 1955, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Lawrence played only a supporting role in the show, as the main focus was on Allenby's campaigns; but then Thomas realised that it was the photos of Lawrence dressed as a Bedouin which had captured the public's imagination, so he had Lawrence photographed again in London in Arab dress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy, David 2008, page 86&quot;/&gt; With the new photos, Thomas re-launched his show under the new title ''With Allenby in Palestine and Lawrence in Arabia'' in early 1920, which proved to be extremely popular.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy, David 2008, page 86&quot;/&gt; The new title elevated Lawrence from a supporting role to a co-star of the Near Eastern campaign and reflected a changed emphasis. Thomas' shows made the previously obscure Lawrence into a household name.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy, David 2008, page 86&quot;/&gt;

Lawrence worked with Thomas on the creation of the presentation, answering many questions and posing for many photographs.&lt;ref&gt;Aldington, 1955, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;. After its success, however, he expressed regret about having been featured in it.&lt;ref&gt;Aldington, 1955, pp. 293, 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence served as an advisor to [[Winston Churchill]] at the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Office]] for just over a year starting in February 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Korda, 2010, pp. 513, 515.&lt;/ref&gt; He hated bureaucratic work, writing on 21 May 1921 to [[Robert Graves]]: &quot;I wish I hadn't gone out there: the Arabs are like a page I have turned over; and sequels are rotten things. I'm locked up here: office every day and much of it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Klieman, Aaron &quot;Lawrence as a Bureaucrat&quot; pages 243–268 from ''The T.E. Lawrence Puzzle'' edited by Stephen Tabachnick, Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984 page 253.&lt;/ref&gt; He travelled to the Middle East on multiple occasions during this period, at one time holding the title of &quot;chief political officer for [[Emirate of Transjordan|Trans-Jordania]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Korda, 2010, p. 519.&lt;/ref&gt;

He campaigned actively for his and Churchill's vision of the Middle East, publishing pieces in multiple newspapers, including the ''Times'', ''The Observer'', ''The Daily Mail'', and ''The Daily Express''.&lt;ref&gt;Korda, 2010, p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence had a sinister reputation in France during his lifetime and even today as an implacable &quot;enemy of France&quot;, the man who was constantly stirring up the Syrians to rebel against French rule throughout the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Larès, Maurice &quot;T.E. Lawrence and France: Friends or Foes?&quot; pages 220–242 from ''The T.E. Lawrence Puzzle'' edited by Stephen Tabachnick, Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984 page 224 &amp; 236–237.&lt;/ref&gt; However, French historian Maurice Larès wrote that the real reason for France's problems in Syria was that the Syrians did not want to be ruled by France, and the French needed a &quot;scapegoat&quot; to blame for their difficulties in ruling the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larès pages 220&quot;&gt;Larès, Maurice &quot;T.E. Lawrence and France: Friends or Foes?&quot; pages 220–242 from ''The T.E. Lawrence Puzzle'' edited by Stephen Tabachnick, Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984 page 236.&lt;/ref&gt; Larès wrote that Lawrence is usually pictured in France as a Francophobe, but he was really a Francophile.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larès pages 220&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Samuelarrival.jpg|thumb|upright|Lawrence, [[Emir Abdullah]], Air Marshal Sir [[Geoffrey Salmond]], Sir [[Wyndham Deedes]], and others in Jerusalem]]
In August 1922, Lawrence enlisted in the Royal Air Force as an aircraftman, under the name ''John Hume Ross''. At the RAF recruiting centre in Covent Garden, London, he was interviewed by recruiting officer Flying Officer [[W. E. Johns]], later known as the author of the [[Biggles]] series of novels.&lt;ref&gt;Biography of Johns, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Johns rejected Lawrence's application, as he suspected that &quot;Ross&quot; was a false name. Lawrence admitted that this was so and that he had provided false documents. He left, but returned some time later with an RAF messenger who carried a written order that Johns must accept Lawrence.&lt;ref&gt;Orlans, 2002, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Lawrence was forced out of the RAF in February 1923 after his identity was exposed. He changed his name to ''T. E. Shaw'' (apparently as a consequence of his friendship with G. B. and Charlotte Shaw&lt;ref&gt;Korda, 2020, p. 577.&lt;/ref&gt;) and joined the [[Royal Tank Corps]] later that year. He was unhappy there and repeatedly petitioned to rejoin the RAF, which finally readmitted him in August 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hillingdon.gov.uk/index.jsp?articleid=8998 |title=T.

At that time, he was forced to return to Britain after rumours began to circulate that he was involved in espionage activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|work=The New York Times|date=27 September 1928|page=1|title=Report Lawrence now a Muslim Saint, Spying on the Bolshevist Agents in India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He purchased several small plots of land in [[Chingford]], built a hut and swimming pool there, and visited frequently. The hut was removed in 1930 when Chingford Urban District Council acquired the land; it was given to the [[City of London Corporation]] which re-erected it in the grounds of The Warren, [[Loughton]]. Lawrence's tenure of the Chingford land has now been commemorated by a plaque fixed on the sighting obelisk on [[Pole Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://telsociety.org.uk/places-to-visit/pole-hill/|title=Pole Hill|publisher=T.E.

Lawrence continued serving in the RAF based at [[RAF Mount Batten]] near Plymouth, [[RAF Calshot]] near Southampton, and [[RAF Bridlington]], East Riding of Yorkshire. He specialised in high-speed boats and professed happiness, and he left the service with considerable regret at the end of his enlistment in March 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/19/day-1935-death-lawrence-arabia/|title=On this day in 1935: The death of Lawrence of Arabia|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=19 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late August or early September 1931 he stayed with [[Lucy, Lady Houston|Lady Houston]] aboard her luxury yacht, the ''Liberty'', off Calshot, shortly before the Schneider Trophy competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Adventuress, the Life and Loves of Lucy, Lady Houston|last=Crompton|first=Teresa|publisher=The History Press|year=2020|isbn=|location=|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later letters [[Lucy, Lady Houston|Lady Houston]] would ask Lawrence's advice on obtaining a new chauffeur for her Rolls Royce car ('Forgive my asking, but you know everything')&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; and suggest that he join the ''Liberty'', for she had discharged her captain, who had turned out to be a 'wrong 'un.'&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

In the inter-war period, the RAF's [[Royal Air Force Marine Branch|Marine Craft Section]] began to commission air-sea rescue launches capable of higher speeds and greater capacity. The arrival of high-speed craft into the MCS was driven in part by Lawrence. He had previously witnessed a seaplane crew drowning when the [[seaplane tender]] sent to their rescue was too slow in arriving. He worked with [[Hubert Scott-Paine]], the founder of the [[British Power Boat Company]] (BPBC), to introduce the {{convert|37.5|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} long ST 200 Seaplane Tender Mk1 into service. These boats had a range of 140 miles when cruising at 24 knots and could achieve a top speed of 29 knots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He read an account of [[Eugene Vinaver]]'s discovery of the [[Winchester Manuscript]] of the ''Morte'' in ''[[The Times]]'' in 1934, and he motorcycled from [[Manchester]] to [[Winchester]] to meet Vinaver.&lt;ref&gt;Walter F.

[[File:20180505-Lawrence of Arabia Memorial.JPG|thumb|upright|Memorial near the crash site which is found south of his cottage at [[Clouds Hill]], [[Wareham, Dorset]]]]

On 13 May 1935 Lawrence was fatally injured in an accident on his [[Brough Superior SS100]] motorcycle in [[Dorset]] close to his cottage [[Clouds Hill]], near [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]], just two months after leaving military service. A dip in the road obstructed his view of two boys on their bicycles; he swerved to avoid them, lost control, and was thrown over the handlebars.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Lawrence&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/oxford/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8130000/8130638.stm |publisher=BBC |title=T.

One of the doctors attending him was neurosurgeon [[Hugh Cairns (surgeon)|Hugh Cairns]], who consequently began a long study of the loss of life by motorcycle dispatch riders through head injuries. His research led to the use of crash helmets by both military and civilian motorcyclists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neurosurgery-online.com/pt/re/neurosurg/abstract.00006123-200201000-00026.htm;jsessionid=LjXXhLWV91Gj2H4GlTrvw2pbgDqDFHTmB0h0WsgfvpzLQpXr3QxY!-341159882!181195629!8091!-1|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120629015306/http://www.neurosurgery-online.com/pt/re/neurosurg/abstract.00006123-200201000-00026.htm;jsessionid=LjXXhLWV91Gj2H4GlTrvw2pbgDqDFHTmB0h0WsgfvpzLQpXr3QxY!-341159882!181195629!8091!-1|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-06-29|title=Lawrence of Arabia, Sir Hugh Cairns, and the Origin of Motor... : Neurosurgery|work=LWW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Moreton, Dorset|Moreton]] estate borders [[Bovington Camp]], and Lawrence bought it from his cousins the Frampton family. He had been a frequent visitor to their home Okers Wood House, and had corresponded with Louisa Frampton for years. Lawrence's mother arranged with the Framptons to have his body buried in their family plot in the separate burial ground of [[St Nicholas' Church, Moreton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kerrigan|first=Michael|title=Who Lies Where – A guide to famous graves|year=1998|publisher=Fourth Estate Limited|location=London|isbn=978-1-85702-258-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/wholieswhereguid00kerr/page/51 51]|url=https://archive.org/details/wholieswhereguid00kerr/page/51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott.

==Writings==
Lawrence was a prolific writer throughout his life, a large portion of which was [[wikt:epistolary|epistolary]]; he often sent several letters a day, and several collections of his letters have been published. He corresponded with many notable figures, including [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Edward Elgar]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Robert Graves]], [[Noël Coward]], [[E. M. Forster]], [[Siegfried Sassoon]], [[John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir|John Buchan]], [[Augustus John]], and [[Henry Williamson]]. He met [[Joseph Conrad]] and commented perceptively on his works. The many letters that he sent to Shaw's wife [[Charlotte Payne-Townshend|Charlotte]] are revealing as to his character.&lt;ref name=&quot;C-Shaw-Letters&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author= T. E. Lawrence| title= Correspondence with Bernard and Charlotte Shaw, 1922–1926 | volume= 1 |editor=Jeremy and Nicole Wilson |publisher= Castle Hill Press|year=2000}} Foreword by Jeremy Wilson.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence was a competent speaker of French and Arabic, and reader of Latin and [[Ancient Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;Korda, 2010, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence published three major texts in his lifetime. The most significant was his account of the Arab Revolt in ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''. [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and [[The Forest Giant (book)|''The Forest Giant'']] were translations, the latter an otherwise forgotten work of French fiction. He received a flat fee for the second translation, and negotiated a generous fee plus royalties for the first.&lt;ref&gt;Orlans, 2002, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''===
[[File:Thomas Edward Lawrence-London Barton St.JPG|thumb|upright|left|14 Barton Street, London SW1, where Lawrence lived while writing ''Seven Pillars'']]
{{main|Seven Pillars of Wisdom}}
Lawrence's major work is ''[[Seven Pillars of Wisdom]]'', an account of his war experiences. In 1919, he was elected to a seven-year research fellowship at [[All Souls College, Oxford]], providing him with support while he worked on the book. Certain parts of the book also serve as essays on military strategy, Arabian culture and geography, and other topics. He rewrote ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' three times, once &quot;blind&quot; after he lost the manuscript while changing trains at [[Reading railway station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/found-lawrence-of-arabias-lost-text-1266823.html|title=Found: Lawrence of Arabia's lost text|date=13 April 1997|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=18 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many alleged &quot;embellishments&quot; in ''Seven Pillars'', though some allegations have been disproved with time, most definitively in [[Jeremy Wilson]]'s [[Lawrence of Arabia: The Authorised Biography of T. E. Lawrence|authorised biography]]. However, Lawrence's own notebooks refute his claim to have crossed the [[Sinai Peninsula]] from [[Aqaba]] to the Suez Canal in just 49 hours without any sleep. In reality, this famous camel ride lasted for more than 70 hours and was interrupted by two long breaks for sleeping, which Lawrence omitted when he wrote his book.&lt;ref&gt;Asher, 1998, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the preface, Lawrence acknowledged [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s help in editing the book. The first edition was published in 1926 as a high-priced private subscription edition, printed in London by [[Herbert John Hodgson]] and Roy Manning Pike, with illustrations by [[Eric Kennington]], [[Augustus John]], [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[Blair Hughes-Stanton]], and Hughes-Stanton's wife [[Gertrude Hermes]]. Lawrence was afraid that the public would think that he would make a substantial income from the book, and he stated that it was written as a result of his war service. He vowed not to take any money from it, and indeed he did not, as the sale price was one third of the production costs,&lt;ref&gt;Graves, 1928, ch. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; leaving him in substantial debt.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, 1976, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Revolt in the Desert''===
[[File:Ljohn.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait by [[Augustus John]], 1919. [[Tate Modern]], London]]

''[[Revolt in the Desert]]'' was an abridged version of ''Seven Pillars'' that he began in 1926 and that was published in March 1927 in both limited and trade editions.&lt;ref&gt;''Grand Strategies; Literature, Statecraft, and World Order'', Yale University Press, 2010, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; He undertook a needed but reluctant publicity exercise, which resulted in a best-seller. Again he vowed not to take any fees from the publication, partly to appease the subscribers to ''Seven Pillars'' who had paid dearly for their editions. By the fourth reprint in 1927, the debt from ''Seven Pillars'' was paid off. As Lawrence left for military service in India at the end of 1926, he set up the &quot;Seven Pillars Trust&quot; with his friend [[David George Hogarth|D. G. Hogarth]] as a trustee, in which he made over the copyright and any surplus income of ''Revolt in the Desert''. He later told Hogarth that he had &quot;made the Trust final, to save myself the temptation of reviewing it, if ''Revolt'' turned out a best seller.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telstudies.org/writings/letters/1927/270407_hogarth.shtml|title=T. E. Lawrence to D. G. Hogarth|date=7 April 1927|publisher=T.E. Lawrence Society|accessdate=19 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resultant trust paid off the debt, and Lawrence then invoked a clause in his publishing contract to halt publication of the abridgment in the United Kingdom. However, he allowed both American editions and translations, which resulted in a substantial flow of income. The trust paid income either into an educational fund for children of RAF officers who lost their lives or were invalided as a result of service, or more substantially into the [[RAF Benevolent Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ICT5DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT96|title=T.E.Lawrence: Tormented Hero|first= Andrew|last= Norman|publisher=Fonthill Media |year=2014|isbn=978-1781550199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Posthumous===
Lawrence left ''[[The Mint (book)|The Mint]]'' unpublished,&lt;ref&gt;Doubleday, Doran &amp; Co, New York, 1936; rprnt Penguin, Harmondsworth,1984 {{ISBN|0-14-004505-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; a memoir of his experiences as an enlisted man in the Royal Air Force (RAF). For this, he worked from a notebook that he kept while enlisted, writing of the daily lives of enlisted men and his desire to be a part of something larger than himself. The book is stylistically very different from ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom'', using sparse prose as opposed to the complicated syntax found in ''Seven Pillars''. It was published posthumously, edited by his brother Professor [[A. W. Lawrence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mint, by 352087 A/c Ross A Day-book of the R.A.F. Depot between August and December 1922|first=T.E.|last=Lawrence|publisher=Jonathan Cape|year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Lawrence's death, A. W. Lawrence inherited Lawrence's estate and his copyrights as the sole beneficiary. To pay the inheritance tax, he sold the US copyright of ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' (subscribers' text) outright to [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday Doran]] in 1935.&lt;ref name=orlans134&gt;Orlans, 2002, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Doubleday still controls publication rights of this version of the text of ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' in the US, and will continue to until the copyright expires at the end of 2022 (publication plus 95 years). In 1936, A. W. Lawrence split the remaining assets of the estate, giving Clouds Hill and many copies of less substantial or historical letters to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], and then set up two trusts to control interests in his brother's residual copyrights.&lt;ref name=SPOWF&gt;{{cite web |title=Seven Pillars of Wisdom Fund |url=https://research.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=92933 |website=Research.britishmuseum.org |publisher=British Museum |accessdate=19 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; He assigned the copyright in ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' to the Seven Pillars of Wisdom Trust,&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity |208669|Seven Pillars Of Wisdom Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was given its first general publication as a result. He assigned the copyright in ''The Mint'' and all Lawrence's letters to the Letters and Symposium Trust,&lt;ref name=orlans134/&gt; which he edited and published in the book ''T. E. Lawrence by his Friends'' in 1937.&lt;ref name=orlans134/&gt;

A substantial amount of income went directly to the RAF Benevolent Fund and to archaeological, environmental, and academic projects. The two trusts were amalgamated in 1986, and the unified trust acquired all the remaining rights to Lawrence's works that it had not owned on the death of A. W. Lawrence in 1991, plus rights to all of A. W. Lawrence's works.&lt;ref name=SPOWF/&gt; The UK copyrights on Lawrence's works published in his lifetime and within 20 years of his death expired on 1 January 2006. Works published more than 20 years after his death were protected for 50 years from publication or to 1 January 2040, whichever is earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telstudies.org/writings/tel_uk_copyright.shtml|title=British copyright law and T.

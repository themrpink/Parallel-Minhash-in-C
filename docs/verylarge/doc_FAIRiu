==Military career and rise to power==
[[File:Ritratto virile c.d. claudio il gotico, 270-285 dc ca.jpg|thumb|alt=Noseless head statue|Probable bust of Claudius in the [[Palatine Museum]], [[Rome]]]]

Before coming to power, Claudius served with the Roman army, where he made a good career and secured appointment to the highest military posts. During the reign of [[Decius]] (249–251), he served as a [[military tribune]].&lt;ref&gt;See SHA, ''Vita Claudii'', 14. It is in fact doubtful that Claudius was a military tribune at the time of Gallienus's murder. At that time this military tribune was usually the commander of a legionary [[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]] or an ''[[Ala (Roman cavalry unit)|ala]]'' of auxiliary cavalry. For Claudius to have been demoted to this level from the heights he had previous occupied (''Hipparchos'' of the Cavalry and Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Armies) would suggest a serious rift between himself and Gallienus. It is possible, but there is no evidence for it in any of the ancient sources; even Zosimus, who is notably cool towards Claudius, gives no hint of it. The most likely explanation for the suggestion is that the author of the ''Historia Augusta'', writing in the Fourth Century AD after the Constantinian reform of the army, had no notion what the term 'tribune' denoted in the seventh decade of the previous century.&lt;/ref&gt; In this post, Claudius was sent to defend [[Thermopylae]], in connection with which the governor of [[Achaea]] was ordered to send him 200 Dardanian soldiers, 60 horsemen, 60 Cretan archers, and a thousand well-armed recruits. However, there is no evidence that the Goths who invaded at that time threatened the region, since their invasion did not extend beyond the middle Balkans. Most likely the message of the &quot;History of the Augustus&quot; is an anachronism, since it is known that the garrison at Thermopylae appeared in 254. Historian François Pashau offers a version that this passage was invented in order to contrast the successful pagan commander Claudius and the unlucky Christian generals who allowed the ruin of Greece by the Gothic leader [[Alaric I]] in 396.{{sfn|Paschoud|1992|loc=p. 25—26}} In addition, Trebellius Pollio reveals that Decius rewarded Claudius after he demonstrated his strength while fighting another soldier at the Games of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;Aurelius Victor, 33&lt;/ref&gt;

His troops then proclaimed him Emperor&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, pg. 209&quot;/&gt; amid charges, never proven, that he murdered his predecessor [[Gallienus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Weigel, Richard D.|url=http://www.roman-emperors.org/claudgot.htm|title=Claudius II Gothicus (268—270)|publisher=An Online Encyclopedia of Roman Emperors|date=2001|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61C8sKPqG?url=http://www.roman-emperors.org/claudgot.htm|archivedate=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he soon proved to be less than bloodthirsty, as he asked the [[Roman Senate]] to spare the lives of Gallienus' family and supporters. He was less magnanimous toward Rome's enemies, however, and it was to this that he owed his popularity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 11&quot;&gt;Gibbon, Ch. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible Claudius gained his position and the respect of the soldiers by being physically strong and especially cruel. A legend tells of Claudius knocking out a horse's teeth with one punch. When Claudius performed as a wrestler in the 250s, he supposedly knocked out the teeth of his opponent when his genitalia had been grabbed in the match.&lt;ref&gt;Meijer, pg. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

Claudius, like [[Maximinus Thrax]] before him, was of [[barbarian]] birth. After an interlude of failed [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] Roman emperors since Maximinus' death, Claudius was the first in a series of tough &quot;[[soldier emperor]]s&quot; who would eventually restore the Empire after the [[Crisis of the Third Century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lightfoot|first= Christopher|title= The Roman empire (27 B.C.-393 A.D.)|series=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher= The Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/roem/hd_roem.htm|date= October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What were the causes of the 3rd century crisis in the Roman Empire?|access-date=2 August 2019|date=2018|url=https://dailyhistory.org/What_were_the_causes_of_the_3rd_century_crisis_in_the_Roman_Empire%3F|website=dailyhistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Downfall of Gallienus===
[[File:Coin of Claudis II.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Antoninianus]] of Claudius II. Legend: IMPerator Caesar CLAVDIVS AVGustus.]]

During the 260s, the breakup of the [[Roman Empire]] into three distinct governing entities (the core Roman Empire, the [[Gallic Empire]] and the [[Palmyrene Empire]]) placed the whole Roman imperium into a precarious position. [[Gallienus]] was seriously weakened by his failure to defeat [[Postumus]] in the West, and the ability of [[Odaenathus]] to live with his arrangement with Gallienus in the East. By 268, however, the situation had changed, as Odaenathus was assassinated, most likely due to court intrigue, and Gallienus fell victim to a mutiny in his own ranks. Upon the death of Odaenathus, power fell to his younger son, who was dominated by his mother, [[Zenobia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 263&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

Under threat of invasion by multiple tribes, Gallienus' troubles primarily lay with [[Postumus]], whom he could not attack because his attention was required in dealing with [[Macrianus Major|Macrianus]] and the invading [[Scythians]]. After four years of delay, Postumus had established power, but in 265, when Gallienus and his men crossed the Alps, they defeated and besieged Postumus in an (unnamed) [[Gallic Empire|Gallic]] city. When victory appeared to be near, Gallienus made the mistake of approaching the city walls too closely and was gravely injured, compelling him to withdraw the campaign. In the next three years, Gallienus' troubles would only get worse. The Scythians successfully invaded the [[Balkans]] in the early months of 268, and [[Aureolus]], a commander of the cavalry, declared himself an ally of Postumus and the new emperor in [[Milan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 263&quot;/&gt;

At this time, another invasion was taking place. A group called the [[Herules|Herulians]] navigated through [[Asia Minor]] and then into [[Greece]] on a naval expedition. Details of these invasions are abstract, as it is nearly impossible to reconstruct the happenings, due to the chain of conflicts initiated by the Herulians in 268. Scholars assume Gallienus' efforts were focused on Aureolus, the officer who betrayed him, and the defeat of the Herulians was left to his successor, Claudius Gothicus.&lt;ref name=&quot;EmpireAtBay&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Roman empire at bay, AD 180-395|first=David|last=Potter|edition=second|series=Routledge history of the ancient world|date=2004|chapter=7|isbn=978-1-315-88256-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of Gallienus is surrounded by conspiracy and betrayal, as were many emperors' deaths. Different accounts of the incident are recorded, but they agree that senior officials wanted Gallienus dead. According to two accounts, the prime conspirator was [[Aurelius Heraclianus]], the [[Praetorian Prefect]]. One version of the story tells of Heraclianus bringing Claudius into the plot while the account given by the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'' exculpates the would-be emperor and adds the prominent general [[Lucius Aurelius Marcianus]] into the plot. The removal of Claudius from the conspiracy is due to his later role as the progenitor of the house of [[Constantinian dynasty|Constantine]], a fiction of [[Constantine I|Constantine]]'s time, and may serve to guarantee that the original version from which these two accounts spring was current prior to the reign of Constantine. It is written that while sitting down at dinner, Gallienus was told that Aureolus and his men were approaching the camp. Gallienus rushed to the front lines, ready to give orders, when he was struck down by a commander of his cavalry. In a different and more controversial account, Aureolus forges a document in which Gallienus appears to be plotting against his generals and makes sure it falls into the hands of the emperor's senior staff. In this plot, [[Aurelian]] is added as a possible conspirator. The tale of his involvement in the conspiracy might be seen as at least partial justification for the murder of Aurelian himself under circumstances that seem remarkably similar to those in this story.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 264&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

Whichever story is true, Gallienus was killed in the summer of 268, and Claudius was chosen by the army outside of [[Milan]] to succeed him. Accounts tell of people hearing the news of the new Emperor, and reacting by murdering Gallienus' family members until Claudius declared he would respect the memory of his predecessor. Claudius had the deceased emperor deified and buried in a family tomb on the [[Appian Way]]. The traitor [[Aureolus]] was not treated with the same reverence, as he was killed by his besiegers after a failed attempt to surrender.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 264&quot;/&gt;

===The Campaigns of Claudius===
At the time of Claudius' accession, the [[Roman Empire]] was in serious danger from several incursions, both within and outside its borders. The most pressing of these was an invasion of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] and [[Pannonia]] by the [[Goths]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 11&quot;/&gt; Although [[Gallienus]] had already inflicted some damage on them at the Battle of Nestus,&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 109&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 109&lt;/ref&gt; Claudius, not long after being named Emperor, followed this up by winning his greatest victory, and one of the greatest in the history of Roman arms.&lt;ref name=&quot;EmpireAtBay&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Map of Ancient Rome 271 AD.svg|thumb|right|400px|The Roman Empire in 268 A.D.]]

At the [[Battle of Naissus]], Claudius and his legions routed a huge Gothic army.&lt;ref name=&quot;roman-emperors.org&quot;/&gt;  Together with his [[cavalry]] commander, the future Emperor [[Aurelian]], the Romans took thousands of prisoners, destroyed the Gothic cavalry as a force, and stormed their [[laager]] (a circular alignment of wagons long favored by the Goths).{{dubious|date=July 2012}} The victory earned Claudius his surname of &quot;Gothicus&quot; (conqueror of the Goths), and that is how he is known to this day. More importantly, the Goths were soon driven back across the [[Danube River]] by Aurelian, and nearly a century passed before they again posed a serious threat to the empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;EmpireAtBay&quot; /&gt;

At the same time, the [[Alamanni]] had crossed the [[Alps]] and attacked the empire. Claudius responded quickly, routing the Alamanni at the [[Battle of Lake Benacus]] in the late fall of 268, a few months after the Battle of Naissus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 110&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 110&lt;/ref&gt; For this he was awarded the title of &quot;Germanicus Maximus.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;roman-emperors.org&quot;/&gt; He then turned on the [[Gallic Empire]], ruled by a pretender for the past eight years and encompassing [[Roman Britain|Britain]], [[Gaul]], and the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. He won several victories and soon regained control of [[Hispania]] and the Rhone river valley of Gaul.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 109&quot;/&gt;  This set the stage for the ultimate destruction of the Gallic Empire under Aurelian.&lt;ref name=&quot;roman-emperors.org&quot;/&gt;

Claudius did not live long enough to fulfill his goal of reuniting all the lost territories of the empire. Late in 269 he had traveled to [[Sirmium]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, pg. 209&quot;&gt;Jones, pg. 209&lt;/ref&gt; and was preparing to go to war against the [[Vandals]], who were raiding in [[Pannonia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 110&quot;/&gt; However, he fell victim to the [[Plague of Cyprian]] (possibly [[smallpox]]), and died early in January 270.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Now when the war with the Goths was finished, there spread abroad a most grievous pestilence, and then Claudius himself was stricken by the disease, and, leaving mankind, he departed to heaven, an abode befitting his virtues.&quot; (''[[Historia Augusta]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; Before his death, he is thought to have named Aurelian as his successor, though Claudius' brother [[Quintillus]] briefly seized power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 11&quot;/&gt;

The [[Roman Senate|Senate]] immediately deified Claudius as &quot;Divus Claudius Gothicus&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, ''The Cambridge Ancient History: The Crisis of Empire, A.D. 193-337'', pg. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Empire and Foreign Affairs under Claudius===
Claudius was not the only man to reap the benefits of holding high office after the death of [[Gallienus]]. Before the rule of Claudius Gothicus, there had only been two emperors from the [[Balkans]], but afterwards there would only be one emperor who did not hail from the provinces of [[Pannonia]], [[Moesia]] or [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] until the year 378, when [[Theodosius I]] from [[Hispania]] would take the throne. To comprehend the structure of government during the reign of Claudius, we must look at four inscriptions that deepen our understanding of a new, truncated empire. The first is a dedication to [[Aurelius Heraclianus]], the prefect involved in the conspiracy against Gallienus, from Traianus Mucianus, who also gave a dedication to [[Heraclianus]]' brother, Aurelius Appollinaris, who was the equestrian governor of the province of ''[[Thracia]]'' in 267–68 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Christol|first=Michel|title=Une carrière équestre sous le règne de l'empereur Gallien|journal=Latomus|year=1976|volume=35|pages=866–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because these men shared the family name, Marcus Aurelius, a name given to those made citizens by the [[constitutio Antoniniana]], we can understand that these men did not come from the imperial ''élite''. The third inscription reveals the career of [[Marcianus]], another leading general by the time that Gallienus died. The fourth honors Julius Placidianus, the prefect of the [[vigiles]]. While we cannot prove that Heraclianus, Appollinaris, [[Placidianus]], or Marcianus were of [[Danubian]] origin themselves, it is clear that none of them were members of the [[Severan]] aristocracy, and all of them appear to owe their prominence to their military roles. To those men must be added [[Marcus Aurelius Probus]] (another emperor in waiting), also of Balkan background, and from a family enfranchised in the time of [[Caracalla]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 265&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Radiate of Claudius II Gothicus (YORYM 2001 6659) obverse.jpg|thumb|A Radiate of Claudius II Gothicus. Legend: IMP. CLAVDIVS AVG.]]

Although we see a rise in Pannonian, Moesian and Illyrian marshals, and foreigners become notable figures, it would be impractical to think the government could function without help from the traditional classes within the empire.  Although their influence was weakened, there were still a number of men with influence from the older [[aristocracy]]. Claudius assumed the consulship in 269 with [[Paternus (consul 269)|Paternus]], a member of the prominent senatorial family, the Paterni, who had supplied consuls and urban prefects throughout Gallienus' reign, and thus were quite influential. In addition, [[Flavius Antiochianus]], one of the consuls of 270, who was an urban prefect the year before, would continue to hold his office for the following year. A colleague of Antiochianus, Virius Orfitus, also the descendant of a powerful family, would continue to hold influence during his father's term as prefect. Aurelian's colleague as consul was another such man, Pomponius Bassus, a member of one of the oldest senatorial families, as was one of the consuls in 272, Junius Veldumnianus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 265&quot;/&gt;

In his first full year of power, Claudius was greatly assisted by the sudden destruction of the imperium Galliarum. When Ulpius Cornelius Laelianus, a high official under [[Postumus]], declared himself emperor in [[Germania Superior]], in the spring of 269, Postumus defeated him, but in doing so, refused to allow the sack of [[Mainz]], which had served as [[Laelianus]]' headquarters. This proved to be his downfall, for out of anger, Postumus' army mutinied and murdered him. Selected by the troops, [[Marcus Aurelius Marius]] was to replace Postumus as ruler. Marius' rule did not last long though, as [[Victorinus]], Postumus' praetorian prefect, defeated him. Now emperor of the [[Gaul]]s, Victorinus was soon in a precarious position, for the Spanish provinces had deserted the [[Gallic Empire]] and declared their loyalty to Claudius, while in southern [[France]], [[Placidianus]] had captured [[Grenoble]]. Luckily, it was there that Placidianus stopped and Victorinus' position stabilized. In the next year, when [[Autun]] revolted, declaring itself for Claudius, the central government made no moves to support it. As a result, the city went through a siege, lasting many weeks, until it was finally captured and sacked by Victorinus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 266&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

It is still unknown why Claudius did nothing to help the city of Autun, but sources tell us his relations with [[Palmyra]] were waning in the course of 270. An obscure passage in the ''[[Historia Augusta]]''{{'}}s life of Gallienus states that he had sent an army under [[Aurelius Heraclianus]] to the region that had been annihilated by [[Zenobia]]. But because Heraclianus was not actually in the east in 268 (instead, at this time, he was involved in the conspiracy of Gallienus' death), we can see that this can not be correct. But the confusion evident in this passage, which also places the bulk of Scythian activity during 269 a year earlier, under Gallienus, may stem from a later effort to pile all possible disasters in this year into the reign of the former Emperor. This would keep Claudius' record of being an ancestor of [[Constantine I|Constantine]] from being tainted. If this understanding of the sources is correct, it might also be correct to see the expedition of Heraclianus to the east as an event of Claudius' time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 266&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Carska palata Sirmijum1.JPG|thumb|Ruins of Imperial Palace at [[Sirmium]], today in [[Sremska Mitrovica]]]]

The victories of Claudius over the [[Goths]] would not only make him a hero in [[Latin]] tradition, but an admirable choice as an ancestor for [[Constantine I]], who was born at [[Niš|Naissus]], the site of Claudius' victory in 269. Claudius is also held in high esteem by [[Zonaras]], whose [[Greeks|Greek]] tradition seems to have been influenced by Latin. For [[Zosimus]], a more reasoned contemporary view shows Claudius as less grand. Claudius' successes in the year 269 were not continued in his next year as Emperor. As the Scythians starved in the mountains or surrendered, the legions pursuing them began to see an epidemic spreading throughout the men. Also, Claudius' unwillingness to do anything at the siege of [[Autun]] likely provoked a quarrel with [[Zenobia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 267&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is not proven that the invasion of [[Gaul]] was the breaking point between Claudius and Zenobia, the sequence of events point to the siege as an important factor. The issue at hand was the position that [[Odaenathus]] held as ''corrector totius orientis'' (imparting overall command of the Roman armies and authority over the Roman provincial governors in the designated region). [[Vaballathus]], the son of Zenobia, was given this title when Zenobia claimed it for him. From then on, tension between the two empires would only get worse. [[Aurelius Heraclianus]]' fabled arrival might have been an effort to reassert central control after the death of Odaenathus, but, if so, it failed. Although coins were never minted with the face of Odaenathus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Gary K.|date=2003|title=Rome's Eastern Trade: International Commerce and Imperial Policy 31 BC – AD 305|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-54793-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; soon after his death coins were made with image of his son&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Southern|first=Patricia|date=2008|title=Empress Zenobia: Palmyra's Rebel Queen|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn= 978-1-4411-4248-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; – outstripping his authority under the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coins with power|first=Liesbeth|last=Claes|publisher=Jaarboek voor Munt|date=2015|issue=102|pages=15–60|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/37219/Claes%202015%20JMP%20Coins%20with%20power_def.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Zabdas]], a [[Palmyrene Empire|Palmyrene]] army invaded [[Arabia]] and moved into [[Egypt]] in the late summer. At this time, the prefect of Egypt was Tenagino Probus, described as an able soldier who not only defeated an invasion of [[Cyrenaica]] by the nomadic tribes to the south in 269, but also was successful in hunting down Scythian ships in the [[Mediterranean]]. However, he did not see the same success in Egypt, for a Palmyrene underground, led by [[Timagenes]], undermined Probus, defeated his army, and killed him in a battle near the modern city of [[Cairo]] in the late summer of 270.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 267&quot;/&gt;

Generally, when a Roman commander is slaughtered it is taken as a sign that a state of war is in existence, and if we can associate the death of [[Heraclianus]] in 270, as well as an inscription from [[Bostra]] recording the rebuilding of a temple destroyed by the Palmyrene army, then these violent acts could be interpreted the same way. Yet they apparently were not. As [[David Stone Potter|David Potter]] writes, &quot;The coins of [[Vaballathus]] avoid claims to imperial power: he remains vir consularis, rex, imperator, dux Romanorum, a range of titles that did not mimic those of the central government. The status vir consularis was, as we have seen, conferred upon [[Odaenathus]]; the title rex, or king, is simply a [[Latin]] translation of [[Malik|mlk]], or king; imperator in this context simply means &quot;victorious general&quot;; and dux Romanorum looks like yet another version of corrector totius orientis&quot; (Potter, 263). These titles suggest that Odaenathus' position was inheritable. In Roman culture, the status gained in procuring a position could be passed on, but not the position itself. It is possible that the thin line between office and the status that accompanied it were dismissed in the Palmyrene court, especially when the circumstance worked against the interests of a regime that was able to defeat [[Persia]], which a number of Roman emperors had failed to do.  Vaballathus stressed the meanings of titles, because in the Palmyrene context, the titles of Odaenathus meant a great deal. When the summer of 270 ended, things were looking very different in the empire than they did a year before. After its success, [[Gaul]] was in a state of inactivity and the empire was failing in the east. Insufficient resources plagued the state, as a great deal of silver was used for the [[antoninianus]], which was again diluted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 267&quot;/&gt;

A large number of rare gold coins of Claudius have been discovered as part of the [[Lava Treasure]] in Corsica, France, in the 1980s.

==Religion==
A short history of imperial Rome, entitled ''De Caesaribus''  written by [[Aurelius Victor]] in AD 361 states that Claudius consulted the [[Sibylline Books]] prior to his campaigns against the [[Goths]]. Hinting that Claudius &quot;revived the tradition of the Decii&quot;, Victor illustrates the senatorial view, which saw Claudius' predecessor, [[Gallienus]], as too relaxed when it came to religious policies.&lt;ref&gt;Curran, pg. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Links to the Constantinian dynasty==
The unreliable ''[[Historia Augusta]]'' reports Claudius and Quintillus having another brother named Crispus and through him a niece, Claudia,  who reportedly married Eutropius and was mother to [[Constantius Chlorus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Augusta'', Claudius, 13:2&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians suspect this account to be a [[genealogical]] fabrication, however, intended to link the family of [[Constantine I]] to that of a well-respected emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;roman-emperors.org&quot;/&gt;

==Saint Valentine==
Claudius Gothicus has been linked to [[Saint Valentine]] since the [[Middle Ages]]. Contemporary records of his deeds were most probably destroyed during the [[Diocletianic Persecution]] in early 4th century&lt;ref name=&quot;oruch&quot;/&gt; and a tale of martyrdom was recorded in ''Passio Marii et Marthae'', a work published in the 5th or 6th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;oruch&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kelly&quot;/&gt; Twentieth-century historians agree that the accounts from this period cannot be verified.&lt;ref name=&quot;oruch&quot;&gt;Jack Oruch, &quot;St. Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February&quot;, ''Speculum'' '''56'''.3 (July 1981 pp 534–565) p 535.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kelly&quot;/&gt; The legend refers to &quot;Emperor Claudius&quot;, but [[Claudius I]] did not persecute Christians (minus the one mention by [[Suetonius]] of Jewish followers of &quot;Chrestus&quot; being expelled from Rome; ''see'' [[Suetonius on Christians]]), so people believe he was Claudius II even though this emperor spent most of his time warring outside his territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;oruch&quot;/&gt;

The legend was retold in later texts, and in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' of 1493 AD, involved the Roman priest being martyred during a general persecution of Christians. The text states that St. Valentine was beaten with clubs and finally beheaded for giving aid to [[Christians]] in Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;oruch&quot;/&gt; The ''[[Golden Legend]]'' of 1260 AD recounts how St. Valentine refused to deny Christ before the &quot;Emperor Claudius&quot; in 270 AD and as a result was beheaded.&lt;ref name=&quot;kelly&quot;&gt;Henry Kelly, ''Chaucer and the cult of Saint Valentine'', pg. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, February 14 marks [[Valentine's Day]], a day set aside by the Christian church in memory of the Roman priest and physician.&lt;ref&gt;Larue, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Defenestrations of Prague''' ({{lang-cs|Pražská defenestrace}}, {{lang-de|Prager Fenstersturz}}, {{lang-la|Defenestratio Pragensis}}) were three incidents in the history of [[Bohemia]] in which multiple people were [[Defenestration|defenestrated]] (thrown out of a window). The origin of the word &quot;defenestrate&quot; (&quot;out of the window&quot;) is believed to come from the episodes in Prague in 1618 when the disgruntled Protestant estates threw two royal governors out of a window of the [[Hradčany Castle]] and wrote an extensive [[Apologia]] explaining their action. In the Middle Ages and early modern times, defenestration was not uncommon--the act carried elements of lynching and mob violence in the form of  murder committed together. 

The first governmental defenestration occurred in 1419, second in 1483 and the third in 1618, although the term &quot;Defenestration of [[Prague]]&quot; more commonly refers to the third. Often, however, the 1483 event does not count as a &quot;significant defenestration&quot;, which leads to some ambiguity when the &quot;second Prague defenestration&quot; is referred to as the 1618 defenestration. The first and third defenestration helped to trigger a prolonged [[Religious war|religious conflict]] inside Bohemia (the [[Hussite Wars]], 1st defenestration) or beyond ([[Thirty Years' War]], 3rd defenestration), while the second helped establish a religious peace in the country for 31 years ([[Religious peace of Kutná Hora|Peace of Kutná Hora]], 2nd defenestration). 

==First Defenestration of Prague==

The First Defenestration of [[Prague]] involved the killing of seven members of the city council by a crowd of [[Czechs|Czech]] [[Hussite]]s on 30 July 1419.{{Citation needed|date = August 2017}}

[[Jan Želivský]], a Hussite [[priest]] at the [[Church of Our Lady of the Snows (Prague)|church of the Virgin Mary of the Snows]], led his congregation on a procession through the streets of Prague to the New Town Hall ([[New Town Hall (Prague)|Novoměstská radnice]]) on [[Charles Square]]. The town council members had refused to exchange their Hussite prisoners. While they were marching, a stone was thrown at Želivský from the window of the town hall and allegedly hit him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Wolfsgrüber |first=C. |year=1907 |chapter=The Austro-Hungarian Monarchy |title=The Catholic Encyclopedia |location=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |accessdate=11 August 2014 |chapter-url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02121b.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; This enraged the mob and they stormed the town hall.  Once inside the hall, the group defenestrated the judge, the [[burgomaster]], and several members of the town council. They were all killed by the fall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;/&gt;

King [[Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia]], after hearing the news, was stunned and died shortly after, supposedly due to shock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;/&gt;

The procession was a result of the growing discontent at the contemporary direction of the Church and the inequality between the peasants, the Church's prelates, and the nobility. This discontent combined with rising feelings of nationalism increased the influence of preachers such as Jan Želivský, influenced by [[John Wycliffe]], who saw the state of the Catholic Church as corrupt. These preachers urged their congregations to action, including taking up arms, to combat these perceived transgressions.{{Citation needed|date = August 2017}}

The First Defenestration was thus the turning point between talk and action leading to the prolonged [[Hussite Wars]]. The wars broke out shortly afterward and lasted until 1436.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americaninprague.eu/history/Defenestrations.shtml|title=Defenestrations of Prague, Czech Republic, Bohemia|last=AmericanInPrague.EU|website=AmericanInPrague.EU|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date = August 2017}}

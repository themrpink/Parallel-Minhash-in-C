An '''endospore''' is a [[dormancy|dormant]], tough, and non-reproductive structure produced by some [[bacteria]] in the phylum [[Firmicutes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Murray, Patrick R.|author2=Ellen Jo Baron|title=Manual of Clinical Microbiology|volume=1|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=ASM|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=C.

It is a stripped-down, dormant form to which the bacterium can reduce itself. Endospore formation is usually triggered by a lack of nutrients, and usually occurs in [[gram-positive bacteria]]. In endospore formation, the bacterium divides within its cell wall, and one side then engulfs the other.&lt;ref name=Cornell/&gt; Endospores enable [[bacteria]] to lie dormant for extended periods, even centuries. There are many reports of spores remaining viable over 10,000 years, and revival of spores millions of years old has been claimed. There is one report of viable spores of ''[[Virgibacillus marismortui|Bacillus marismortui]]'' in salt crystals approximately 250 million years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cano | first1 = RJ | last2 = Borucki | first2 = MK | year = 1995 | title = Revival and identification of bacterial spores in 25- to 40-million-year-old Dominican amber | url = | journal = Science | volume = 268 | issue = 5213| pages = 1060–1064 | doi = 10.1126/science.7538699 | pmid=7538699| bibcode = 1995Sci...268.1060C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ringo2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ringo|first1=John|title=Fundamental Genetics|chapter=Reproduction of Bacteria|year=2004|pages=153–160|doi=10.1017/CBO9780511807022.018|isbn=9780511807022}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Environment (biology)|environment]] becomes more favorable, the endospore can reactivate itself to the vegetative state. Most types of bacteria cannot change to the endospore form. Examples of bacterial [[species]] that can form endospores include ''[[Bacillus cereus]]'', ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'', ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'', ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]'', and ''[[Clostridium tetani]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|three/000035434|endospore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The endospore consists of the bacterium's DNA, ribosomes and large amounts of [[dipicolinic acid]]. Dipicolinic acid is a spore-specific chemical that appears to help in the ability for endospores to maintain dormancy. This chemical accounts for up to 10% of the spore's dry weight.&lt;ref name=Cornell/&gt;

Endospores can survive without nutrients. They are resistant to [[ultraviolet radiation]], [[desiccation]], high temperature, extreme freezing and chemical [[disinfectants]]. Thermo-resistant endospores were first hypothesized by [[Ferdinand Cohn]] after studying ''Bacillus subtilis'' growth on cheese after boiling the cheese. His notion of spores being the reproductive mechanism for the growth was a large blow to the previous suggestions of spontaneous generation. [[Astrophysicist]] [[Steinn Sigurdsson]] said &quot;There are viable bacterial spores that have been found that are 40 million years old on Earth – and we know they're very hardened to radiation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=BBC Staff |title=Impacts 'more likely' to have spread life from Earth |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14637109 |date=23 August 2011 |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=2011-08-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824155136/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14637109 |archive-date=24 August 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Common antibacterial agents that work by destroying vegetative cell walls do not affect endospores. Endospores are commonly found in soil and water, where they may survive for long periods of time. A variety of different microorganisms form &quot;spores&quot; or &quot;cysts&quot;, but the endospores of [[Firmicutes|low G+C gram-positive bacteria]] are by far the most resistant to harsh conditions.&lt;ref name=Cornell/&gt;

Some classes of bacteria can turn into exospores, also known as [[microbial cyst]]s, instead of endospores. Exospores and endospores are two kinds of &quot;hibernating&quot; or dormant stages seen in some classes of microorganisms.

==Structure==
[[File:Bakterien Sporen.png|thumb|260px|Variations in endospore morphology: (1,&amp;nbsp;4)&amp;nbsp;central endospore; (2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;5)&amp;nbsp;terminal endospore; (6)&amp;nbsp;lateral endospore]]
Bacteria produce a single endospore internally. The spore is sometimes surrounded by a thin covering known as the [[exosporium]], which overlies the ''spore coat''. The spore coat, which acts like a [[sieve]] that excludes large toxic molecules like [[lysozyme]], is resistant to many toxic [[molecules]] and may also contain [[enzymes]] that are involved in [[germination]]. In ''Bacillus subtilus'' endospores, the spore coat is estimated to contain more than 70 coat proteins, which are organized into an inner and an outer coat layer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henriques&amp;Moran_2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Henriques AO, Moran CP Jr | title = Structure, assembly, and function of the spore surface layers | journal = Annu Rev Microbiol | volume = 61 | issue = | pages = 555–588 | date = 2007 | pmid = 18035610| doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.61.080706.093224 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The X-ray diffraction pattern of purified ''B. subtilis'' endospores indicates the presence of a component with a regular periodic structure, which Kadota and Iijima speculated might be formed from a keratin-like protein.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kadota_Iijima_1965&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kadota H, Iijima K | title = The X-ray diffraction pattern of spores of ''Bacillus subtilis'' | journal = Agric Biol Chem | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 80–81 | date = 1965 | pmid = | doi = 10.1080/00021369.1965.10858352| doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after further studies this group concluded that the structure of the spore coat protein was different from keratin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hiragi_etal_1967&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hiragi Y, Iijima K, and Kadota H | title = Hexagonal single crystal pattern from the spore coat of ''Bacillus subtilis'' | journal = Nature | volume = 215 | issue = 5097 | pages = 154–5 | date = 1967 | pmid = 4963432 | doi = 10.1038/215154a0 | bibcode = 1967Natur.215..154H }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the ''B. subtilis'' genome was sequenced, no ortholog of human keratin was detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kunst F et al. | title = The complete genome sequence of the gram-positive bacterium ''Bacillus subtilis'' | journal = Nature | volume = 390 | issue = 6657 | pages = 249–56 | date = 1997 | pmid = 9384377 | doi = 10.1038/36786 | doi-access = free | bibcode = 1997Natur.390..249K }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''cortex'' lies beneath the spore coat and consists of [[peptidoglycan]]. The ''core wall'' lies beneath the cortex and surrounds the [[protoplast]] or ''core'' of the endospore. The core contains the spore chromosomal [[DNA]] which is encased in [[chromatin]]-like proteins known as SASPs (small acid-soluble spore proteins), that protect the spore DNA from UV radiation and heat.  The core also contains normal cell structures, such as [[ribosome]]s and other [[enzymes]], but is not metabolically active.

Up to 20% of the dry weight of the endospore consists of [[calcium]] [[Dipicolinic acid|dipicolinate]] within the core, which is thought to stabilize the [[DNA]]. Dipicolinic acid could be responsible for the heat resistance of the spore, and calcium may aid in resistance to heat and oxidizing agents. However, mutants resistant to heat but lacking dipicolinic acid have been isolated, suggesting other mechanisms contributing to heat resistance are also at work.&lt;ref&gt;Prescott, L. (1993). ''Microbiology'', Wm. C. Brown Publishers, {{ISBN|0-697-01372-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Small acid-soluble proteins (SASPs) are found in endospores. These proteins tightly bind and condense the DNA, and are in part responsible for resistance to UV light and DNA-damaging chemicals.&lt;ref name=Cornell&gt;{{cite web | title=Bacterial Endospores | publisher=Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Department of Microbiology | accessdate=October 21, 2018 | url=http://micro.cornell.edu/research/epulopiscium/bacterial-endospores | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615001904/https://micro.cornell.edu/research/epulopiscium/bacterial-endospores/ | archive-date=June 15, 2018 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visualising endospores under light microscopy can be difficult due to the impermeability of the endospore wall to dyes and stains. While the rest of a bacterial cell may stain, the endospore is left colourless. To combat this, a special stain technique called a [[Moeller stain]] is used. That allows the endospore to show up as red, while the rest of the cell stains blue. Another staining technique for endospores is the [[Schaeffer-Fulton stain]], which stains endospores green and bacterial bodies red. The arrangement of spore layers is as follows:
* Exosporium
* Spore coat
* Spore cortex
* Core wall

==Location==
The position of the endospore differs among bacterial species and is useful in identification. The main types within the cell are terminal, subterminal, and centrally placed endospores. Terminal endospores are seen at the poles of cells, whereas central endospores are more or less in the middle. Subterminal endospores are those between these two extremes, usually seen far enough towards the poles but close enough to the center so as not to be considered either terminal or central. Lateral endospores are seen occasionally.

Examples of bacteria having terminal endospores include ''[[Clostridium tetani]]'', the pathogen that causes the disease [[tetanus]]. Bacteria having a centrally placed endospore include ''[[Bacillus cereus]]''. Sometimes the endospore can be so large the cell can be distended around the endospore. This is typical of ''Clostridium tetani''.

==Formation and destruction==
[[File:Sporulation.png|thumb|Endospore formation and cycle]]
{{See|Bacterial morphological plasticity}}
Under conditions of starvation, especially the lack of carbon and nitrogen sources, a single endospore forms within some of the bacteria through a process called sporulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Microbiology/Book%3A_Microbiology_(Kaiser)/Unit_1%3A_Introduction_to_Microbiology_and_Prokaryotic_Cell_Anatomy/2%3A_The_Prokaryotic_Cell_-_Bacteria/2.4%3A_Cellular_Components_within_the_Cytoplasm/2.4E%3A_Endospores|title=2.4E: Endospores|date=2016-03-02|website=Biology LibreTexts|language=en|access-date=2019-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a bacterium detects environmental conditions are becoming unfavourable it may start the process of endosporulation, which takes about eight hours. The [[DNA]] is replicated and a membrane wall known as a ''spore [[septum]]'' begins to form between it and the rest of the cell. The [[plasma membrane]] of the cell surrounds this wall and pinches off to leave a double membrane around the DNA, and the developing structure is now known as a forespore. Calcium dipicolinate, the calcium salt of dipicolinic acid, is incorporated into the forespore during this time. The dipicolinic acid helps stabilize the proteins and DNA in the endospore.&lt;ref name=Pommerville&gt;{{cite book|last=Pommerville|first=Jeffrey C.|title=Fundamentals of microbiology|year=2014|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|location=Burlington, MA|isbn=978-1449688615|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|141}} Next the peptidoglycan cortex forms between the two layers and the bacterium adds a spore coat to the outside of the forespore. In the final stages of endospore formation the newly forming endospore is dehydrated and allowed to mature before being released from the mother cell.&lt;ref name=Cornell/&gt; The cortex is what makes the endospore so resistant to temperature. The cortex contains an inner membrane known as the core. The inner membrane that surrounds this core leads to the endospore's resistance against UV light and harsh chemicals that would normally destroy microbes.&lt;ref name=Cornell/&gt; Sporulation is now complete, and the mature endospore will be released when the surrounding vegetative cell is degraded.

Endospores are resistant to most agents that would normally kill the vegetative cells they formed from. Unlike persister cells, endospores are the result of a morphological differentiation process triggered by nutrient limitation (starvation) in the environment; endosporulation is initiated by [[quorum sensing]] within the &quot;starving&quot; population.&lt;ref name=Pommerville/&gt;{{rp|141}} Most disinfectants such as household cleaning products, [[alcohols]], [[quaternary ammonium compounds]] and [[detergents]] have little effect on endospores. However, sterilant [[alkylation|alkylating]] agents such as [[ethylene oxide]] (ETO), and 10% bleach are effective against endospores. To kill most [[anthrax]] spores, standard household bleach (with 10% [[sodium hypochlorite]]) must be in contact with the spores for at least several minutes; a very small proportion of spores can survive longer than 10 minutes in such a solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heninger|first=Sara|author2=Christine A. Anderson |author3=Gerald Beltz |author4=Andrew B. Onderdonk |title=Decontamination of Bacillus anthracis Spores: Evaluation of Various Disinfectants|journal= Applied Biosafety|date=January 1, 2009|volume=14|issue=1|pages=7–10|pmid=20967138|pmc=2957119|doi=10.1177/153567600901400103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher concentrations of bleach are not more effective, and can cause some types of bacteria to aggregate and thus survive.

While significantly resistant to heat and radiation, endospores can be destroyed by burning or by [[autoclave|autoclaving]] at a temperature exceeding the boiling point of water, 100&amp;nbsp;°C. Endospores are able to survive at 100&amp;nbsp;°C for hours, although the larger the number of hours the fewer that will survive. An indirect way to destroy them is to place them in an environment that reactivates them to their vegetative state. They will germinate within a day or two with the right environmental conditions, and then the vegetative cells, not as hardy as endospores, can be straightforwardly destroyed. This indirect method is called [[tyndallization]]. It was the usual method for a while in the late 19th century before the introduction of inexpensive autoclaves. Prolonged exposure to [[ionising radiation]], such as [[x-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s, will also kill most endospores.

The endospores of certain types of (typically non-pathogenic) bacteria, such as ''[[Geobacillus stearothermophilus]]'', are used as probes to verify that an autoclaved item has been rendered truly sterile: a small capsule containing the spores is put into the autoclave with the items; after the cycle the content of the capsule is cultured to check if anything will grow from it.  If nothing will grow, then the spores were destroyed and the sterilization was successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eplantscience.com/index/microbiology_methods/destructions_microorganisms/the_autoclave.php|title=The Autoclave|accessdate=June 18, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303212536/http://www.eplantscience.com/index/microbiology_methods/destructions_microorganisms/the_autoclave.php|archive-date=March 3, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In hospitals, endospores on delicate invasive instruments such as [[endoscope]]s are killed by low-temperature, and non-corrosive, ethylene oxide sterilizers.  ETO is the only low-temperature sterilant to stop outbreaks on these instruments.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Ethylene Oxide Sterilization {{!}} Disinfection &amp; Sterilization Guidelines {{!}} Guidelines Library {{!}} Infection Control {{!}}CDC |url=https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/disinfection/sterilization/ethylene-oxide.html |website=www.cdc.gov |accessdate=11 October 2019 |language=en-us |date=4 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191117130336/https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/disinfection/sterilization/ethylene-oxide.html |archive-date=17 November 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, &quot;high level disinfection&quot; does not kill endospores but is used for instruments such as a colonoscope that do not enter sterile bodily cavities. This latter method uses only warm water, enzymes, and detergents.

Bacterial endospores are resistant to antibiotics, most disinfectants, and physical agents such as radiation, boiling, and drying. The impermeability of the spore coat is thought to be responsible for the endospore's resistance to chemicals. The heat resistance of endospores is due to a variety of factors:

* Calcium dipicolinate, abundant within the endospore, may stabilize and protect the endospore's DNA.
* Small acid-soluble proteins (SASPs) saturate the endospore's DNA and protect it from heat, drying, chemicals, and radiation. They also function as a carbon and energy source for the development of a vegetative bacterium during germination. 
* The cortex may osmotically remove water from the interior of the endospore and the dehydration that results is thought to be very important in the endospore's resistance to heat and radiation.
* Finally, DNA repair enzymes contained within the endospore are able to repair damaged DNA during germination.

== Reactivation ==

Reactivation of the endospore occurs when conditions are more favourable and involves ''activation'', ''germination'', and ''outgrowth''. Even if an endospore is located in plentiful nutrients, it may fail to germinate unless activation has taken place. This may be triggered by heating the endospore. Germination involves the dormant endospore starting metabolic activity and thus breaking hibernation. It is commonly characterised by rupture or absorption of the spore coat, swelling of the endospore, an increase in metabolic activity, and loss of resistance to environmental stress.

Outgrowth follows germination and involves the core of the endospore manufacturing new chemical components and exiting the old spore coat to develop into a fully functional vegetative bacterial cell, which can divide to produce more cells.

Endospores possess five times more sulfur than vegetative cells.  This excess sulfur is concentrated in spore coats as an amino acid, [[cysteine]].  It is believed that the macromolecule accountable for maintaining the dormant state has a protein coat rich in cystine, stabilized by S-S linkages.  A reduction in these linkages has the potential to change the tertiary structure, causing the protein to unfold.  This conformational change in the protein is thought to be responsible for exposing active enzymatic sites necessary for endospore germination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keynan | first1 = A. | last2 = Evenchik | first2 = Z. | last3 = Halvorson | first3 = H. O. | last4 = Hastings | first4 = J. W. | year = 1964 | title = Activation of bacterial endospores | url = | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 88 | issue = 2| pages = 313–318 | pmid = 14203345 | pmc = 277301 | doi = 10.1128/JB.88.2.313-318.1964 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Endospores can stay dormant for a very long time. For instance, endospores were found in the tombs of the Egyptian pharaohs. When placed in appropriate medium, under appropriate conditions, they were able to be reactivated. In 1995, Raul Cano of California Polytechnic State University found bacterial spores in the gut of a fossilized bee trapped in amber from a tree in the Dominican Republic. The bee fossilized in amber was dated to being about 25 million years old. The spores germinated when the amber was cracked open and the material from the gut of the bee was extracted and placed in nutrient medium. After the spores were analyzed by microscopy, it was determined that the cells were very similar to ''Bacillus sphaericus'' which is found in bees in the Dominican Republic today.&lt;ref name=Pommerville/&gt;

==Importance==

As a simplified model for [[cellular differentiation]], the molecular details of endospore formation have been extensively studied, specifically in the [[model organism]] ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]''.  These studies have contributed much to our understanding of the regulation of [[gene expression]], [[transcription factor]]s, and the [[sigma factor]] subunits of [[RNA polymerase]].

Endospores of the bacterium ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' were used in the [[2001 anthrax attacks]]. The powder found in contaminated postal letters consisted of anthrax endospores. This intentional distribution led to 22 known cases of anthrax (11 inhalation and 11 cutaneous).  The case fatality rate among those patients with inhalation anthrax was 45% (5/11).  The six other individuals with inhalation anthrax and all the individuals with cutaneous anthrax recovered. Had it not been for antibiotic therapy, many more might have been stricken.&lt;ref name=Pommerville/&gt;

According to WHO veterinary documents, ''B. anthracis'' sporulates when it sees oxygen instead of the carbon dioxide present in mammal blood; this signals to the bacteria that it has reached the end of the animal, and an inactive dispersable morphology is useful.

Sporulation requires the presence of free oxygen. In the natural situation, this means the vegetative cycles occur within the low oxygen environment of the infected host and, within the host, the organism is exclusively in the vegetative form. once outside the host, sporulation commences upon exposure to the air and the spore forms are essentially the exclusive phase in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/anthrax_webs.pdf | title=Anthrax in humans and animals | publisher=OIE | isbn=978-92-4-154753-6 | edition=4th | year=2008 | access-date=2013-08-22 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023232424/http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/anthrax_webs.pdf | archive-date=2012-10-23 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/fr/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.01_ANTHRAX.pdf | title=OIE Listed Diseases and Other Diseases of Importance | work=Terrestrial Manual | date=2012 | accessdate=June 18, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812180308/http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/fr/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.01_ANTHRAX.pdf | archive-date=August 12, 2016 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theodore the Studite''' (also known as '''Theodorus Studita''', '''Saint Theodore of Stoudios''', and '''Saint Theodore of Studium'''; 759–826) was a [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine Greek]] [[monasticism|monk]] and abbot of the [[Stoudios Monastery]] in [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1933|p=76}}; {{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|loc=&quot;Theodorus—Theodosia&quot;, p. 769}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He played a major role in the revivals both of Byzantine monasticism and of classical literary genres in Byzantium. He is known as a zealous opponent of [[Iconoclasm (Byzantine)|iconoclasm]], one of several conflicts that set him at odds with both emperor and patriarch.

==Biography==

===Family and childhood===
Theodore was born in [[Constantinople]] in 759.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|loc=&quot;Theodorus—Theodosia&quot;, p. 769}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the oldest son of [[Photeinos (fl. 8th century)|Photeinos]], an important financial official in the [[Byzantine aristocracy and bureaucracy|palace bureaucracy]],&lt;ref&gt;He is described as ''tamias tōn basilikōn phorōn'', &quot;administrator of the imperial monies,&quot; a position that seems to have been equivalent to the ''basilikos [[sakellarios]]''. He was therefore an extremely high-ranking official with a close relationship to the emperor himself. ({{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=18–21}})&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Theoktiste (740–802)|Theoktiste]], herself the offspring of a distinguished Constantinopolitan family.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore emphasizes the high standing of her parents, Sergios and Euphemia, who died in the plague of 747/48. ({{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=26–27}})&lt;/ref&gt; The brother of Theoktiste, Theodore's uncle [[Plato of Sakkoudion|Platon]], was an important official in the imperial financial administration.&lt;ref&gt;He was a ''[[Zygostates (Byzantine official)|zygostates]]'', a position for which he was trained by his own uncle. ({{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=27–28}})&lt;/ref&gt; The family therefore controlled a significant portion, if not all, of the imperial financial administration during the reign of [[Constantine V]] (r. 741–775).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=62–63 (including footnote #175)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Theodore had two younger brothers ([[Joseph I of Thessalonica|Joseph]], later [[Archbishop of Thessalonica]], and Euthymios) and one sister, whose name we do not know.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=28–29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has often been assumed that Theodore's family belonged to the [[iconodule]] party during the first period of [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]]. There is however no evidence to support this, and their high position in the imperial bureaucracy of the time renders any openly iconodule position highly unlikely. Furthermore, when Platon left his office and entered the priesthood in 759, he was ordained by an abbot who, if he was not actively iconoclastic himself, at the very least offered no resistance to the iconoclastic policies of Constantine V. The family as a whole was most likely indifferent to the question of icons during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=42–45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the later hagiographical literature, Theodore received an education befitting his family's station and from the age of seven was instructed by a private tutor, eventually concentrating in particular on theology. It is however not clear that these opportunities were available to even the most well-placed Byzantine families of the eighth century, and it is possible that Theodore was at least partially an autodidact.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=67–69}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early monastic career===
Following the death of Emperor [[Leo IV the Khazar|Leo IV]] (r. 775–780) in 780, Theodore's uncle Platon, who had lived as a monk in the Symbola Monastery in [[Bithynia]] since 759, visited Constantinople, and persuaded the entire family of his sister, Theoktiste, to likewise take monastic vows. Theodore, together with his father and brothers, sailed back to Bithynia with Platon in 781, where they set about transforming the family estate into a religious establishment, which became known as the Sakkudion Monastery. Platon became abbot of the new foundation, and Theodore was his &quot;right hand.&quot; The two sought to order the monastery according to the writings of [[Basil of Caesarea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=71–76}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period of the regency of [[Irene (empress)|Eirene]], Abbot Platon emerged as a supporter of the [[Patriarch Tarasios of Constantinople|Patriarch Tarasios]], and was a member of Tarasios's iconodule party at the [[Second Council of Nicaea]], where the veneration of icons was declared orthodox. Shortly thereafter Tarasios himself ordained Theodore as a priest. In 794, Theodore became abbot of the Sakkudion Monastery, while Platon withdrew from the daily operation of the monastery and dedicated himself to silence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=80–81}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict with Constantine VI===
Also in 794, Emperor [[Constantine VI]] (r. 776–797) decided to separate from his first wife, [[Maria of Amnia]], and to marry Maria's ''kubikularia'' ([[Lady-in-waiting]]), [[Theodote]], a cousin of Theodore the Studite.&lt;ref&gt;She was the daughter of Anna, a sister of Theoktiste. ({{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=53, 83}})&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Patriarch may initially have resisted this development, as a divorce without proof of adultery on the part of the wife could be construed as illegal, he ultimately gave way. The marriage of Constantine and Theodote was celebrated in 795, although not by the patriarch, as was normal, but by a certain Joseph, a priest of Hagia Sophia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=89–90}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A somewhat obscure chain of events followed (the so-called &quot;Moechian controversy,&quot; from the Greek ''moichos'', &quot;adulterer&quot;), in which Theodore initiated a protest against the marriage from the Sakkudion Monastery, and appears to have demanded the excommunication, not only of the priest Joseph, but also of all who had received communion from him, which, as Joseph was a priest of the imperial church, included implicitly the emperor and his court.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=98–101}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This demand had no official weight, however, and Constantine appears to have attempted to make peace with Theodore and Platon (who, on account of his marriage, were now his relatives), inviting them to visit him during a sojourn at the imperial baths of Prusa in Bithynia. In the event neither appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=101–102}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, imperial troops were sent to the Sakkudion Monastery, and the community was dispersed. Theodore was flogged, and, together with ten other monks, banished to Thessaloniki, while Platon was imprisoned in Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=107–110}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The monks arrived in Thessaloniki in March 797, but did not remain for long; in August of the same year Constantine VI was blinded and overthrown, and his mother Irene, the new empress, lifted the exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=110–113}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abbot of the Studites===
[[Image:Theodore Studite (Menologion of Basil II).jpg|thumb|200px|The Stoudios Monastery as depicted in an 11th-century manuscript.]]
Following the accession of Irene, the priest Joseph was stripped of his office, and Theodoros was received in the imperial palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|p=118}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The monks then returned to the Sakkudion Monastery, but were forced back to the capital in either 797 or 798 on account of an Arab raid on Bithynia. At this time, Irene offered Theodore the leadership of the ancient [[Stoudios]] Monastery in Constantinople, which he accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=120–122}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Theodore then set about building various workshops within the monastery to guarantee [[autarky]], constructing a library and a [[scriptorium]], and restoring and decorating the church. He also composed a series of poems on the duties of the various members of the community, which were likely inscribed and displayed within the monastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|p=125}}; for the poems, {{harvnb|Speck|1984|loc=''Jamben'', pp. 114–174 (Epigrams 3–29)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He furthermore composed a rule for the governance of the monastery,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|p=126}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and made the Studios community the center of an extensive congregation of dependent monasteries, including the Sakkudion. He maintained contact with these other monasteries above all through his prodigious literary output (letters as well as [[catechism]]s), which reached a quantitative peak at this time, and developed a system of messengers that was so elaborate as to resemble a private postal service.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=128–133}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

To this period may also date the so-called iconophile epigrams, [[Iamb (foot)|iamb]]ic [[acrostic]]s composed by Theodore that replaced the &quot;iconoclastic epigrams&quot; which were previously exhibited on the [[Chalke]] gate of the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|Great Palace]]. It has been suggested that these were commissioned by Irene, as another sign of her good favor toward Theodore, although a commission under [[Michael I Rangabe]] (r. 811–813) is also possible; in any case, they were removed in 815 by [[Leo V the Armenian]] (r. 813–820) and replaced by new &quot;iconoclastic&quot; verses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=122–123 (with notes)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 806, the Patriarch Tarasios died, and Emperor [[Nikephoros I]] (r. 802–811) set about seeking his replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=135–136}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears likely that Platon at this time put forth Theodore's name,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=139–140}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Ecumenical Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople|Nikephoros]], a layman who held the rank of ''[[asekretis]]'' in the imperial bureaucracy, was chosen instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|p=142}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The selection of Nikephoros gave rise to an immediate protest on the part of the Studites, and in particular Theodore and Platon, who objected to the elevation of a layman to the patriarchal throne. Theodore and Platon were jailed for 24 days before the Emperor Nikephoros allowed them to return to their congregations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=144–145}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

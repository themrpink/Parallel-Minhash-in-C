== Reliability ==
[[File:DeLaRue ATM Crash.jpg|thumb|left|An ATM running [[Microsoft Windows]] that has [[blue screen of death|crashed]] due to a peripheral component failure]]

Before an ATM is placed in a public place, it typically has undergone extensive testing with both [[Test Money|test money]] and the [[Front and back ends|backend]] computer systems that allow it to perform transactions. Banking customers also have come to expect high reliability in their ATMs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.managementjournals.com/journals/marketing/article27-p5.htm |title=Barking Up the Wrong Tree â€“ Factors Influencing Customer Satisfaction in Retail Banking in the UK - Page 5 |publisher=Managementjournals.com |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116061441/http://www.managementjournals.com/journals/marketing/article27-p5.htm |archivedate=16 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides incentives to ATM providers to minimise machine and network failures. Financial consequences of incorrect machine operation also provide high degrees of incentive to minimise malfunctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rebecca Allison |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,875749,00.html |title=ATM gives out free cash and lands family in court &amp;#124; UK news |newspaper=The Guardian |date= 2003-01-16|accessdate=2011-02-11 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATMs and the supporting electronic financial networks are generally very reliable, with industry benchmarks typically producing 98.25% customer availability for ATMs&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncr.com/en/self-service/services_v_1.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061122012524/http://www.ncr.com/en/self-service/services_v_1.pdf|date=22 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and up to 99.999% availability for host systems that manage the networks of ATMs. If ATM networks do go out of service, customers could be left without the ability to make transactions until the beginning of their bank's next time of opening hours.

This said, not all errors are to the detriment of customers; there have been cases of machines giving out money without debiting the account, or giving out higher value notes as a result of incorrect [[denomination (currency)|denomination]] of [[banknote]] being loaded in the money cassettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/3667279.stm | work=BBC News | title=Double money in cash point error | date=2004-04-28 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115111715/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/3667279.stm | archivedate=15 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of receiving too much money may be influenced by the card holder agreement in place between the customer and the bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rbcroyalbank.com/cards/documentation/ch_agreements/ch_agree_client.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628204818/http://www.rbcroyalbank.com/cards/documentation/ch_agreements/ch_agree_client.html |archivedate=28 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4552288.stm |title=Europe &amp;#124; Mad rush to faulty ATM in France |work=BBC News |date=2005-12-23 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115044752/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4552288.stm |archivedate=15 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Errors that can occur may be [[Machine|mechanical]] (such as card transport mechanisms; keypads; [[hard disk failure]]s; envelope deposit mechanisms); [[software]] (such as [[operating system]]; [[device driver]]; [[application software|application]]); [[information transfer|communications]]; or purely down to operator error.

To aid in reliability, some ATMs print each transaction to a roll-paper journal that is stored inside the ATM, which allows its users and the related financial institutions to settle things based on the records in the journal in case there is a dispute. In some cases, transactions are posted to an electronic journal to remove the cost of supplying journal paper to the ATM and for more convenient searching of data.

Improper money checking can cause the possibility of a customer receiving [[counterfeit]] banknotes from an ATM. While bank personnel are generally trained better at spotting and removing counterfeit cash,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ottawabusinessjournal.com/286598582617402.php] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910100650/http://www.ottawabusinessjournal.com/286598582617402.php|date=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/banknotes/education/index.htm |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080511084240/http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/banknotes/education/index.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=11 May 2008 |title=Materials- Bank Notes- Bank of Canada |publisher=Bankofcanada.ca |accessdate=2011-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the resulting ATM money supplies used by banks provide no guarantee for proper banknotes, as the [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|Federal Criminal Police Office of Germany]] has confirmed that there are regularly incidents of false banknotes having been dispensed through ATMs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.de/wirtschaft/geldanlage/:Falschgeld-Bl%FCten-Geldautomat/523625.html |title=Falschgeld: BlÃ¼ten aus dem Geldautomat? - Wirtschaft |publisher=Stern.De |date=2004-05-05 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ATMs may be stocked and wholly owned by outside companies, which can further complicate this problem.
[[Bill validator|Bill validation]] technology can be used by ATM providers to help ensure the authenticity of the cash before it is stocked in the machine; those with cash recycling capabilities include this capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wincor-nixdorf.com/internet/com/Products/CashSystems/CashRecycling/ProCash3100/index.html |title=Wincor Nixdorf Germany |language=de |publisher=Wincor-nixdorf.com |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225656/http://www.wincor-nixdorf.com/internet/com/Products/CashSystems/CashRecycling/ProCash3100/index.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, whenever a transaction fails with an ATM due to network or technical issue and if the amount does not get dispensed in spite of account being debited then the banks are supposed to return the debited amount to the customer within 7 working days from the day of receipt of complaint. Banks are also liable to pay the late fees in case of delay in repayment of funds post 7 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_RTI_Diclosure_Logs.aspx?fn=9 |title = Reserve Bank of India - Function Wise Monetary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with any device containing objects of value, ATMs and the systems they depend on to function are the targets of fraud. Fraud against ATMs and people's attempts to use them takes several forms.

The first known instance of a fake ATM was installed at a shopping mall in [[Manchester, Connecticut]] in 1993. By modifying the inner workings of a [[Fujitsu]] model 7020 ATM, a criminal gang known as the Bucklands Boys stole information from cards inserted into the machine by customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.05/atm_pr.html |title=1.05: The Bucklands Boys and Other Tales of the ATM |journal=Wired |accessdate=2011-02-11 |first=Phil |last=Patton |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029073146/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.05/atm_pr.html |archivedate=29 October 2010 |date=May 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[WAVY-TV]] reported an incident in Virginia Beach in September 2006 where a hacker, who had probably obtained a factory-default administrator password for a filling station's white-label ATM, caused the unit to assume it was loaded with US$5 bills instead of $20s, enabling himselfâ€”and many subsequent customersâ€”to walk away with four times the money withdrawn from their accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/video/player/player.html?url=/video/tech/2006/09/14/owens.va.atm.scam.wavy |title=Video |publisher=Cnn.com |date=2005-06-06 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109222545/http://www.cnn.com/video/player/player.html?url=%2Fvideo%2Ftech%2F2006%2F09%2F14%2Fowens.va.atm.scam.wavy |archivedate=9 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of scam was featured on the TV series ''[[The Real Hustle]]''.

ATM behaviour can change during what is called &quot;stand-in&quot; time, where the bank's cash dispensing network is unable to access databases that contain account information (possibly for database maintenance). In order to give customers access to cash, customers may be allowed to withdraw cash up to a certain amount that may be less than their usual daily withdrawal limit, but may still exceed the amount of available money in their accounts, which could result in fraud if the customers intentionally withdraw more money than they had in their accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/4.html |title=Kennison v Daire [1986&amp;#93; HCA 4; (1986) 160 CLR 129 (20 February 1986) |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |date=1986-02-20 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Card fraud ===
In an attempt to prevent criminals from [[shoulder surfing (computer security)|shoulder surfing]] the customer's [[personal identification number]] (PIN), some banks draw privacy areas on the floor.

For a low-tech form of fraud, the easiest is to simply steal a customer's card along with its PIN. A later variant of this approach is to trap the card inside of the ATM's card reader with a device often referred to as a [[Lebanese loop]]. When the customer gets frustrated by not getting the card back and walks away from the machine, the criminal is able to remove the card and withdraw cash from the customer's account, using the card and its PIN.

This type of fraud has spread globally. Although somewhat replaced in terms of volume by skimming incidents, a re-emergence of card trapping has been noticed in regions such as Europe, where EMV chip and PIN cards have increased in circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atmsecurity.com/articles/atm-fraud/atm-security-issues-atm-fraud-issues-by-geography.html |title=ATM Security Issues &amp; ATM Fraud Issues by Geography &amp;#124; ATMSecurity.com ATM Security news ATM Security issues ATM fraud info ATM |publisher=Atmsecurity.com |date=2009-03-04 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024215333/http://www.atmsecurity.com/articles/atm-fraud/atm-security-issues-atm-fraud-issues-by-geography.html |archivedate=24 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another simple form of fraud involves attempting to get the customer's bank to issue a new card and its PIN and stealing them from their mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://venus.soci.niu.edu/~cudigest/phracks/phrack-08 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724213440/http://venus.soci.niu.edu/~cudigest/phracks/phrack-08 |archivedate=24 July 2008 }} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, a newer high-tech method of operating, sometimes called '''card skimming''' or '''card cloning''', involves the installation of a magnetic card reader over the real ATM's card slot and the use of a wireless surveillance camera or a modified digital camera or a false PIN keypad to observe the user's PIN. Card data is then cloned into a duplicate card and the criminal attempts a standard cash withdrawal. The availability of low-cost commodity wireless cameras, keypads, card readers, and card writers has made it a relatively simple form of fraud, with comparatively low risk to the fraudsters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/crime/warnings/atmcamera.asp|title=Skimming with ATM Cameras : snopes.com|author=snopes|date=29 March 2016|work=snopes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to stop these practices, countermeasures against card cloning have been developed by the banking industry, in particular by the use of [[smart card]]s which cannot easily be copied or spoofed by unauthenticated devices, and by attempting to make the outside of their ATMs [[tamper-evident|tamper evident]]. Older chip-card security systems include the French [[Carte Bleue]], [[Visa Cash]], [[Mondex]], [[Blue from American Express]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/56/wth.html |title=What the Hell Do Smart Cards Do? |magazine=Fast Company |date=2002-02-28 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701223645/http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/56/wth.html |archivedate=1 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[EMV 96|EMV '96 or EMV 3.11]]. The most actively developed form of smart card security in the industry today is known as [[EMV 2000|EMV 2000 or EMV 4.x]].

[[EMV]] is widely used in the UK ([[Chip and PIN]]) and other parts of Europe, but when it is not available in a specific area, ATMs must fall back to using the easyâ€“toâ€“copy magnetic stripe to perform transactions. This fallback behaviour can be exploited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/05/19/stories/2006051920380300.htm |title=Tamil Nadu / Chennai News : Four more held in fake credit card racket case |newspaper=The Hindu |date=2006-05-19 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |location=Chennai, India |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810232850/http://www.hindu.com/2006/05/19/stories/2006051920380300.htm |archivedate=10 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the fallback option has been removed on the ATMs of some UK banks, meaning if the chip is not read, the transaction will be declined.

Card cloning and [[Skimming (credit card fraud)|skimming]] can be detected by the implementation of magnetic card reader heads and firmware that can read a signature embedded in all magnetic stripes during the card production process. This signature, known as a &quot;MagnePrint&quot; or &quot;BluPrint&quot;, can be used in conjunction with common two-factor authentication schemes used in ATM, debit/retail point-of-sale and prepaid card applications.

The concept and various methods of copying the contents of an ATM card's magnetic stripe onto a duplicate card to access other people's financial information was well known in the hacking communities by late 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Fredric L. Rice, Organised Crime Civilian Response |url=http://www.skepticfiles.org/hacker/phrack32.htm |title=Phrack Classic Volume Three, Issue 32, File #1 of XX Phrack Classic Newsletter Issue XXXII |publisher=Skepticfiles.org |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121231232/http://www.skepticfiles.org/hacker/phrack32.htm |archivedate=21 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Andrew Stone, a computer security consultant from Hampshire in the UK, was convicted of stealing more than Â£1&amp;nbsp;million by pointing high-definition video cameras at ATMs from a considerable distance and recording the card numbers, expiry dates, etc. from the embossed detail on the ATM cards along with video footage of the PINs being entered. After getting all the information from the videotapes, he was able to produce clone cards which not only allowed him to withdraw the full daily limit for each account, but also allowed him to sidestep withdrawal limits by using multiple copied cards. In court, it was shown that he could withdraw as much as Â£10,000 per hour by using this method. Stone was sentenced to five years and six months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Stephen Castell |url=http://itnow.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/6/17 |title=Seeking after the truth in computer evidence: any proof of ATM fraud? â€” ITNOW  |doi=10.1093/combul/38.6.17 |publisher=Itnow.oxfordjournals.org |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012184756/http://itnow.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/6/17 |archivedate=12 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[talking ATM]] is a type of ATM that provides audible instructions so that people who cannot read a screen can independently use the machine, therefore effectively eliminating the need for assistance from an external, potentially malevolent source. All audible information is delivered privately through a standard [[headphone jack]] on the face of the machine. Alternatively, some banks such as the [[Nordea]] and [[Swedbank]] use a built-in external speaker which may be invoked by pressing the talk button on the keypad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=pepsi says |url=http://zidbits.com/2011/01/25/why-is-there-braille-on-drive-up-atm-machines/ |title=Why is there braille on drive-up ATMs? |publisher=Zidbits |date=2011-01-25 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129211251/http://zidbits.com/2011/01/25/why-is-there-braille-on-drive-up-atm-machines/ |archivedate=29 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Information is delivered to the customer either through pre-recorded [[sound]] files or via text-to-speech [[speech synthesis]].

A postal [[interactive kiosk]] may share many components of an ATM (including a vault), but it only dispenses items related to postage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usps.com/communications/news/press/2004/pr04_098.htm |title=Postal Service Mailing Kiosks Now in Every State |publisher=Usps.com |date=2004-12-30 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103030043/http://www.usps.com/communications/news/press/2004/pr04_098.htm |archivedate=3 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lunewsviews.com/apc.htm Automated Postal Centers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413211117/http://www.lunewsviews.com/apc.htm |date=13 April 2016 }}.

A '''scrip cash dispenser''' may have many components in common with an ATM, but it lacks the ability to dispense physical cash and consequently requires no vault. Instead, the customer requests a withdrawal transaction from the machine, which prints a receipt or [[scrip]]. The customer then takes this receipt to a nearby sales clerk, who then exchanges it for cash from the till.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atmscrip.com/what_is_scrip.html |title=About Script ATMs: How Do Cashless ATMs Work? - What is Scrip, or Cashless ATMs? |publisher=Atmscrip.com |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324150807/http://www.atmscrip.com/what_is_scrip.html |archivedate=24 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[teller assist unit]] (TAU) is distinct in that it is designed to be operated solely by trained personnel and not by the general public, does integrate directly into interbank networks, and usually is controlled by a computer that is not directly integrated into the overall construction of the unit.

A Web ATM is an online interface for ATM card banking that uses a [[Card reader#Smart card readers|smart card reader]]. All the usual ATM functions are available, except for withdrawing cash. Most banks in [[Taiwan]] provide these online services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://netbank.megabank.com.tw/natm/ |title=Megabank WebATM |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319155928/https://netbank.megabank.com.tw/natm/ |archivedate=19 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://webatm.post.gov.tw/postatm/index1.jsp |title=Post Office Bank WebATM |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409144215/https://webatm.post.gov.tw/postatm/index1.jsp |archivedate=9 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''embedded system''' is a computer system&amp;mdash;a combination of a [[computer processor]], [[computer memory]], and [[input/output]] peripheral devices&amp;mdash;that has a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barr-glossary&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Barr|title=Embedded Systems Glossary|work=Neutrino Technical Library|access-date=2007-04-21|url=http://www.netrino.com/Embedded-Systems/Glossary|author-link=Michael Barr (software engineer)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heath|first=Steve |title=Embedded systems design|publisher=Newnes|year=2003|edition=2|series=EDN series for design engineers|page=[https://archive.org/details/embeddedsystemsd0000heat/page/2 2]|url=https://archive.org/details/embeddedsystemsd0000heat|url-access=registration|quote= An embedded system is a [[microprocessor]] based system that is built to control a function or a range of functions. | isbn=978-0-7506-5546-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is ''embedded'' as part of a complete device often including electrical or electronic hardware and mechanical parts. 
Because an embedded system typically controls physical operations of the machine that it is embedded within, it often has [[real-time computing]] constraints.  Embedded systems control many devices in common use today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Michael Barr|author2=Anthony J.

Modern embedded systems are often based on [[microcontroller]]s (i.e. microprocessors with integrated memory and peripheral interfaces), but ordinary microprocessors (using external chips for memory and peripheral interface circuits) are also common, especially in more complex systems. In either case, the processor(s) used may be types ranging from general purpose to those specialized in a certain class of computations, or even custom designed for the application at hand. A common standard class of dedicated processors is the [[digital signal processor]] (DSP).

Since the embedded system is dedicated to specific tasks, [[design engineer]]s can optimize it to reduce the size and cost of the product and increase the reliability and performance. Some embedded systems are mass-produced, benefiting from [[economies of scale]].

Embedded systems range from portable devices such as [[digital watch]]es and [[MP3 player]]s, to large stationary installations like [[Traffic light control and coordination|traffic light controllers]], [[programmable logic controller]]s, and large complex systems like [[hybrid vehicles]], [[medical imaging]] systems, and [[avionics]]. Complexity varies from low, with a single microcontroller chip, to very high with multiple units, [[peripheral]]s and networks mounted inside a large [[equipment rack]].

==History==
=== Background ===
{{See also|Microprocessor chronology}}

The origins of the [[microprocessor]] and the [[microcontroller]] can be traced back to the [[MOS integrated circuit]], which is an [[integrated circuit]] chip [[semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] from [[MOSFET]]s (metal-oxide-semiconductor [[field-effect transistor]]s) and was developed in the early 1960s. By 1964, MOS chips had reached higher [[transistor density]] and lower manufacturing costs than [[bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]] chips. MOS chips further increased in complexity at a rate predicted by [[Moore's law]], leading to [[large-scale integration]] (LSI) with hundreds of [[transistors]] on a single MOS chip by the late 1960s. The application of MOS LSI chips to [[computing]] was the basis for the first microprocessors, as engineers began recognizing that a complete [[computer processor]] system could be contained on several MOS LSI chips.&lt;ref name=&quot;ieee&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shirriff |first1=Ken |title=The Surprising Story of the First Microprocessors |journal=[[IEEE Spectrum]] |volume=53 |issue=9 |pages=48â€“54 |date=30 August 2016 |publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/silicon-revolution/the-surprising-story-of-the-first-microprocessors |access-date=13 October 2019|doi=10.1109/MSPEC.2016.7551353 |s2cid=32003640 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first multi-chip microprocessors, the [[Four-Phase Systems AL1]] in 1969 and the [[Garrett AiResearch]] [[MP944]] in 1970, were developed with multiple MOS LSI chips. The first single-chip microprocessor was the [[Intel 4004]], released in 1971. It was developed by [[Federico Faggin]], using his [[silicon-gate]] MOS technology, along with [[Intel]] engineers [[Marcian Hoff]] and [[Stan Mazor]], and [[Busicom]] engineer [[Masatoshi Shima]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1971: Microprocessor Integrates CPU Function onto a Single Chip |website=The Silicon Engine |url=https://www.computerhistory.org/siliconengine/microprocessor-integrates-cpu-function-onto-a-single-chip/ |publisher=[[Computer History Museum]] |access-date=22 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development ===
One of the first recognizably modern embedded systems was the [[Apollo Guidance Computer]],{{citation needed|reason=linked article claims it is the first IC-based computer. nothing there supports it being the first embedded system.|date=August 2018}} developed ca. 1965 by [[Charles Stark Draper]] at the [[MIT Instrumentation Laboratory]]. At the project's inception, the Apollo guidance computer was considered the riskiest item in the Apollo project as it employed the then newly developed [[monolithic integrated circuit]]s to reduce the computer's size and weight. 

An early mass-produced embedded system was the [[D-17B|Autonetics D-17 guidance computer]] for the [[Minuteman (missile)|Minuteman missile]], released in 1961. When the Minuteman II went into production in 1966, the D-17 was replaced with a new computer that represented the first high-volume use of integrated circuits.

Since these early applications in the 1960s, embedded systems have come down in price and there has been a dramatic rise in processing power and functionality. An early [[microprocessor]], the [[Intel 4004]] (released in 1971), was designed for [[calculator]]s and other small systems but still required external memory and support chips. By the early 1980s, memory, input and output system components had been integrated into the same chip as the processor forming a [[microcontroller]]. Microcontrollers find applications where a general-purpose computer would be too costly. As the cost of microprocessors and microcontrollers fell the prevalence of embedded systems increased. 

Today, a comparatively low-cost microcontroller may be programmed to fulfill the same role as a large number of separate components. With microcontrollers, it became feasible to replace, even in consumer products, expensive knob-based [[Analogue electronics|analog]] components such as [[potentiometer]]s and [[variable capacitor]]s with up/down buttons or knobs read out by a microprocessor. Although in this context an embedded system is usually more complex than a traditional solution, most of the complexity is contained within the microcontroller itself. Very few additional components may be needed and most of the design effort is in the software. Software prototype and test can be quicker compared with the design and construction of a new circuit not using an embedded processor.

Embedded systems are commonly found in consumer, industrial, [[Automotive industry|automotive]], [[home appliance]]s, medical, telecommunication, commercial and military applications.

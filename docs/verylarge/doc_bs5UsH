===XLIFF===
'''[[XLIFF|XML Localisation Interchange File Format]]''' (XLIFF) is intended to provide a single interchange file format that can be understood by any localization provider. [[XLIFF]] is the preferred way{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} of exchanging data in XML format in the translation industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=xliff XML Localisation Interchange File Format]
&lt;/ref&gt;

===TransWS===
'''Translation Web Services'''. TransWS specifies the calls needed to use Web services for the submission and retrieval of files and messages relating to localization projects. It is intended as a detailed framework for the automation of much of the current localization process by the use of Web Services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=trans-ws Translation Web Services]&lt;/ref&gt;

===xml:tm===
{{Main article|xml:tm}}
The xml:tm (XML-based Text Memory) approach to translation memory is based on the concept of text memory which comprises author and translation memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OAXAL—What is it and why should I care|url=http://www.infomanagementcenter.com/enewsletter/200808/second.htm|work=CIDM Information Management News|accessdate=March 30, 2013|author=Andrzej Zydroń|date=August 2008|quote=At the core of xml:tm are the following concepts which together make up 'Text Memory': Author Memory and Translation Memory.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517222230/http://www.infomanagementcenter.com/enewsletter/200808/second.htm|archive-date=May 17, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;   xml:tm has been donated to Lisa OSCAR by XML-INTL.

===PO===
[[Gettext| Gettext Portable Object format]]. Though often not regarded as a translation memory format, Gettext PO files are bilingual files that are also used in translation memory processes in the same way translation memories are used.  Typically, a PO translation memory system will consist of various separate files in a directory tree structure.  Common tools that work with PO files include the [[GNU Gettext]] Tools and the [[Translate Toolkit]].  Several tools and programs also exist that edit PO files as if they are mere [[source text]] files.

'''Mohamed Farrah Hassan Aidid''' ({{lang-so|Maxamed Faarax Xasan Caydiid, {{lang-ar|محمد فرح حسن عيديد}}}}; 15 December 1934 – 1 August 1996) was a Somali warlord.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-07-20-me-14836-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;  A former general and diplomat, he was the chairman of the [[United Somali Congress]] (USC) and later led the [[Somali National Alliance]] (SNA). Along with other armed opposition groups, he succeeded in overthrowing and exiling President [[Mohamed Siad Barre]]'s socialist and anti-communist regime from [[Somalia]] during the [[Somali Civil War]] that broke out in the early 1990s.

In 1992, Aidid attacked [[United Nations]] troops, causing him to be named the Worlds first ''Wanted Man'' of the [[Unified Task Force]]. After UN peacekeepers withdrew in 1993, 18 American soldiers were killed by Aidid's forces,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tzwYzL9KcwEC&amp;q=mohamed+farah+aidid+&amp;pg=PA203|title=U.S. Foreign Policy: A Documentary and Reference Guide|isbn=9780313383755|last1=Kalaitzidis|first1=Akis|last2=Streich|first2=Gregory W.|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also attacked peacekeepers, incited violence, and committed crimes against humanity at Aidid's behest.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-06-18-mn-4401-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1, 1996, Aidid suffered a heart attack and died at the age of 61.

==Early years==
Aidid was born in 1934 in [[Mudug]], [[Italian Somaliland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian: Life in the Crosshairs of the CIA's War on Terror&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Pecora |first=Thomas |title=Guardian: Life in the Crosshairs of the CIA's War on Terror|work=Time |date=May 7, 2019 |isbn=9780810883116 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4j-ZUgKCiqIC&amp;q=aidid+born+in+mudug&amp;pg=PA143}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is from the Reer Jalaf, Habar Gidir subclan of Hawiye. He was educated in [[Rome]] and [[Moscow]] and served in the Italian colonial police force in the 1950s. He later joined the [[Somali Armed Forces|Somali National Army]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Twwno&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Purvis |first=Andrew |title=Wanted: Warlord No. 1 |work=Time |date=June 28, 1993 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,978788,00.html |access-date=2007-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aidid was a highly qualified officer and quirky person who was selected to study advanced post graduate  military science at the [[M. V. Frunze Military Academy]] (Военная академия им. М. В. Фрунзе) in the [[Soviet Union]], an elite institution reserved for the most qualified officers of the [[Warsaw Pact]] armies and their allies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahmedbiapo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Ahmed III|first=Abdul|title=Brothers in Arms Part I|url=http://wardheernews.com/Articles_2011/Oct/29_Brothers_in_Army_abdul.pdf|publisher=WardheerNews|access-date=15 July 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503221634/http://www.wardheernews.com/Articles_2011/Oct/29_Brothers_in_Army_abdul.pdf|archive-date=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, a few days after the assassination of Somalia's second president [[Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke]], a military junta led by Major General [[Mohamed Siad Barre]] staged a bloodless coup d'état. Aidid at the time was serving as Army Commander of the 26th Division based in Hargeisa. He was also the Head of Operations for the Central Regions and Northern Regions of Somalia. However he was relieved of his duties and soon after was recalled to [[Mogadishu]] to lead the troops guarding the burial of the deceased President. He quickly fell out of favour with the new regime's leaders and was subsequently detained along with [[Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed]]. Aidid was eventually released from prison six years afterwards to take part in the [[Ogaden War|1977–78 war]] against [[Ethiopia]] over the disputed [[Ogaden]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=United Nations. Dept. of Public Information|title=The Blue Helmets: A Review of United Nations Peace-keeping|year=1996|publisher=United Nations, Dept. of Public Information|isbn=9211006112|page=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later served as an advisor to President Barre and as Somalia's [[ambassador]] to [[India]], before being appointed [[intelligence (agency)|intelligence]] chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9608/02/aideed/|title=CNN - Somali faction leader Aidid dies - Aug. 2, 1996|date=2007-09-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909180649/http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9608/02/aideed/|archive-date=2007-09-09|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4j-ZUgKCiqIC&amp;q=aidid+born+in+mudug&amp;pg=PA143|title = Somali Piracy and Terrorism in the Horn of Africa|isbn = 9780810883116|last1 = Daniels|first1 = Christopher L.|date = 5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Somali Congress==
{{main|Somali Rebellion|United Somali Congress}}
After a fallout from the unsuccessful Ogaden campaign of the late 1970s, the Barre administration began arresting government and military officials under suspicion of participation in the abortive 1978 [[coup d'état]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ararep&quot;&gt;''ARR: Arab Report and Record'', (Economic Features, ltd.: 1978), p.602.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahmed&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Ahmed III|first=Abdul|title=Brothers in Arms Part Forces I|url=http://wardheernews.com/Articles_2011/Oct/29_Brothers_in_Army_abdul.pdf|publisher=WardheerNews|access-date=February 28, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503221634/http://www.wardheernews.com/Articles_2011/Oct/29_Brothers_in_Army_abdul.pdf|archive-date=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the people who had allegedly helped plot the [[Coup d'état|putsch]] were summarily executed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Npmc&quot;&gt;New People Media Centre, ''New People'', Issues 94–105, (New People Media Centre: Comboni Missionaries, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; However, several officials managed to escape abroad and started to form the first of various dissident groups dedicated to ousting Barre's regime by force.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fitzgerald&quot;&gt;Nina J. Fitzgerald, ''Somalia: Issues, History, and Bibliography'', (Nova Publishers: 2002), p.25.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1980s, Barre's regime had become increasingly unpopular. The State took an increasingly hard line, and [[insurgency|insurgencies]], encouraged by Ethiopia's communist [[Derg]] administration, sprang up across the country. This eventually led to the outbreak of the [[Somali Civil War|civil war]], the gradual breakup of the [[Somali Armed Forces]], and the toppling of Barre's government on 26 January 1991. Many of the opposition groups subsequently began competing for influence in the power vacuum that followed the ouster of Barre's regime. Armed factions led by [[United Somali Congress]] (USC) commanders General Aidid and [[Ali Mahdi Mohamed]], in particular, clashed as each sought to exert power over the capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lirs&quot;&gt;Library Information and Research Service, ''The Middle East: Abstracts and Index'', Volume 2, (Library Information and Research Service: 1999), p.327.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahmed&quot; /&gt;

[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 733]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 746|UN Security Council Resolution 746]] led to the creation of the [[United Nations Operation in Somalia I|UNOSOM I]] after the dissolution of the central government. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 794]] was unanimously passed on 3 December 1992, which approved a coalition led by the [[United States]]. Forming the [[Unified Task Force]] (UNITAF), the alliance was given the task of assuring security until humanitarian efforts were transferred to the UN. Landing in 1993, the UN peacekeeping coalition started the two-year [[United Nations Operation in Somalia II]] (UNOSOM II) primarily in the south.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ken Rutherford (scientist)|Ken Rutherford]], [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1565492609 ''Humanitarianism Under Fire: The US and UN Intervention in Somalia'', Kumarian Press, July 2008] {{ISBN|1-56549-260-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidency declaration==
Aidid subsequently declared himself President of Somalia in June 1995.&lt;ref name=PRESIDENT-AIDIDS-SOMALIA&gt;{{cite web|title=President Aidid's Somalia|url=http://www.h-net.org/~africa/confrpt/marcus.html|date=September 1995|access-date=2007-02-04|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716002145/http://www.h-net.org/~africa/confrpt/marcus.html|archive-date=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his declaration received no international recognition, as his rival Ali Mahdi Muhammad had already been elected interim president at a conference in 1991 in [[Djibouti]] and recognized as such by the [[international community]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://circle.ubc.ca/bitstream/handle/2429/5267/ubc_1994-0415.pdf?sequence=1 Djibouti Conference] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316145832/https://circle.ubc.ca/bitstream/handle/2429/5267/ubc_1994-0415.pdf?sequence=1 |date=2012-03-16 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==  
On 24 July 1996, Aidid and his men clashed with the forces of former allies Ali Mahdi Muhammad and [[Osman Ali Atto]]. Atto was a former supporter and financier of Aidid, and of the same subclan. Atto is alleged to have masterminded the defeat of Aidid.&lt;ref&gt;''Indian Ocean Newsletter'', 27 April 1996 and ''Indian Ocean Newsletter'', 4 May 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  Aidid suffered a gunshot wound in the ensuing battle. He later died from a heart attack on August 1, either during or after surgery to treat his injuries.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{Citation | last = Serrill  | first = Michael  | title = Dead by the Sword  | newspaper = Time Magazine  | date = 12 August 1996  | url = http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,7034,00.html  | access-date = 2011-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other officers allegedly targeted by Atto include General Talan. In its 2000 Country Report for Somalia, the [[U.S. Department of State]] asserted that the killing of Yusuf Tallan, a former general under the Barre regime, was connected to Osman Ali Atto &quot;because of Atto's business deals in the north and the possibility of a deal between Somaliland President Egal and Atto in order to destabilize the south.&quot;&lt;ref name=COUNTRY-REPORTS-2000-SOMALIA&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=[[US Department of State]]
|access-date=2007-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
During the events leading up to the civil war, Aidid's wife Khadiga Gurhan sought asylum in Canada in 1989, moving the couple's four children with her. Local media shortly afterwards alleged that she had returned to Somalia for a five-month stay while still receiving welfare payments. Gurhan admitted in an interview to collecting welfare and having briefly traveled to Somalia in late 1991. However, it was later brought to light that she had been granted [[landed immigrant]] status in June 1991, thereby making her a legal resident of Canada. Additionally, Aidid's rival President Barre had been overthrown in January of that year. This altogether ensured that Gurhan's five-month trip would not have undermined her initial 1989 claim of refugee status. An official probe by Canadian immigration officials into the allegations also concluded that she had obtained her landing papers through normal legal processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Scott|title=Tory probe into warlord's wife too late to save Lewis|url=http://contests.eyeweekly.com/eye/issue/issue_11.04.93/NEWS/med1104.php|access-date=18 February 2013|newspaper=Eye Weekly|date=4 November 1993|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028230350/http://contests.eyeweekly.com/eye/issue/issue_11.04.93/NEWS/med1104.php|archive-date=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hussein Mohamed Farrah]], son of General Aidid, emigrated to the United States when he was 17 years old. Staying 16 years in the country, he eventually became a [[naturalized citizen]] and later a [[United States Marine]] who served in Somalia. Two days after his father's death, the [[Somali National Alliance]] declared Farrah as the new president, although he too was not internationally recognized as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first =Ron|last =Kampeas|title =From Marine to warlord: The strange journey of Hussein Farrah Aidid|url =http://www.boston.com/news/daily/11/somali_warlord.htm|publisher =Associated Press|date =2 November 2002|access-date =2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aaron Copland''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|p|l|ə|n|d}}, {{respell|KOHP|lənd}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/people/copland-aaron.html |title=Copland, Aaron |website=InfoPlease}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/pronunciation/english/aaron |title=Aaron Copland – Pronunciation – Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary |publisher=OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; November 14, 1900{{spaced ndash}}December 2, 1990) was an American composer, composition teacher, writer, and later a conductor of his own and other American music. Copland was referred to by his peers and critics as &quot;the Dean of American Composers&quot;. The open, slowly changing harmonies in much of his music are typical of what many people consider to be the sound of American music, evoking the vast American landscape and pioneer spirit. He is best known for the works he wrote in the 1930s and 1940s in a deliberately accessible style often referred to as &quot;populist&quot; and which the composer labeled his &quot;vernacular&quot; style.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=186}} Works in this vein include the ballets ''[[Appalachian Spring]]'', ''[[Billy the Kid (ballet)|Billy the Kid]]'' and ''[[Rodeo (ballet)|Rodeo]]'', his ''[[Fanfare for the Common Man]]'' and [[Symphony No. 3 (Copland)|Third Symphony]]. In addition to his ballets and orchestral works, he produced music in many other genres, including chamber music, vocal works, opera and film scores.

After some initial studies with composer [[Rubin Goldmark]], Copland traveled to Paris, where he first studied with [[Isidor Philipp]] and [[Paul Vidal]], then with noted [[pedagogue]] [[Nadia Boulanger]]. He studied three years with Boulanger, whose eclectic approach to music inspired his own broad taste. Determined upon his return to the U.S. to make his way as a full-time composer, Copland gave lecture-recitals, wrote works on commission and did some teaching and writing. However, he found that composing orchestral music in the [[Modernism (music)|modernist]] style, which he had adopted while studying abroad, was a financially contradictory approach, particularly in light of the [[Great Depression]]. He shifted in the mid-1930s to a more accessible musical style which mirrored the German idea of {{lang|de|[[Gebrauchsmusik]]}} (&quot;music for use&quot;), music that could serve utilitarian and artistic purposes. During the Depression years, he traveled extensively to Europe, Africa, and Mexico, formed an important friendship with Mexican composer [[Carlos Chávez]] and began composing his signature works.

During the late 1940s, Copland became aware that [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] and other fellow composers had begun to study [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s use of [[Twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone (serial) techniques]]. After he had been exposed to the works of French composer [[Pierre Boulez]], he incorporated serial techniques into his ''Piano Quartet'' (1950), ''Piano Fantasy'' (1957), ''[[Connotations (Copland)|Connotations]]'' for orchestra (1961) and ''[[Inscape (Copland)|Inscape]]'' for orchestra (1967). Unlike Schoenberg, Copland used his tone rows in much the same fashion as his tonal material—as sources for melodies and harmonies, rather than as complete statements in their own right, except for crucial events from a structural point of view. From the 1960s onward, Copland's activities turned more from composing to conducting. He became a frequent guest conductor of orchestras in the U.S. and the UK and made a series of recordings of his music, primarily for [[Columbia Records]].

== Life ==

=== Early years ===
[[File:Aaron Copland School of Music (541691170).jpg|thumb|Aaron Copland School of Music, Queens College (part of the [[City University of New York]])]]
Aaron Copland was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], on November 14, 1900.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=15}} He was the youngest of five children in a [[Conservative Jewish]] family of [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian]] origins.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=19}} While emigrating from Russia to the United States, Copland's father, Harris Morris Copland, lived and worked in Scotland for two to three years to pay for his boat fare to the US. It was there that Copland's father may have [[Anglicisation|Anglicized]] his surname &quot;Kaplan&quot; to &quot;Copland&quot;, though Copland himself believed for many years that the change had been due to an [[Ellis Island]] immigration official when his father entered the country.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=15}}&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor.org&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=832353 |title=Conversation with Aaron Copland |first1=Edward T. |last1=Cone |first2=Aaron |last2=Copland |date=January 1, 1968 |journal=Perspectives of New Music |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=57–72 |doi=10.2307/832353}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copland was however unaware until late in his life that the family name had been Kaplan, and his parents never told him this.&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor.org&quot; /&gt; Throughout his childhood, Copland and his family lived above his parents' [[Brooklyn]] shop, H.M. Copland's, at 628 Washington Avenue (which Aaron would later describe as &quot;a kind of neighborhood [[Macy's]]&quot;),{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=16}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Paton |first=David W. |title=1905 State of New York Census. Ninth Election District, Block &quot;D&quot;, Eleventh Assembly District, Borough of Brooklyn, County of Kings |page=36 |date=July 1, 1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the corner of Dean Street and Washington Avenue,{{sfn|Ross|2007|p=266}} and most of the children helped out in the store. His father was a staunch Democrat. The family members were active in [[Congregation Baith Israel Anshei Emes]], where Aaron celebrated his [[Bar Mitzvah]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=26}} Not especially athletic, the sensitive young man became an avid reader and often read [[Horatio Alger]] stories on his front steps.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=15}}

Copland's father had no musical interest. His mother, Sarah Mittenthal Copland, sang, played the piano, and arranged for music lessons for her children.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=19}} Of his siblings, oldest brother Ralph was the most advanced musically, proficient on the violin. His sister Laurine had the strongest connection with Aaron; she gave him his first piano lessons, promoted his musical education, and supported him in his musical career.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=19}} A student at the Metropolitan Opera School and a frequent opera-goer, Laurine also brought home [[libretti]] for Aaron to study.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=17}} Copland attended [[Boys High School (Brooklyn)|Boys High School]] and in the summer went to various camps. Most of his early exposure to music was at Jewish weddings and ceremonies, and occasional family musicales.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=26}}

Copland began writing songs at the age of eight and a half.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=22}} His earliest notated music, about seven bars he wrote when age 11, was for an opera scenario he created and called ''Zenatello''.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=22}}{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=32}} From 1913 to 1917 he took piano lessons with Leopold Wolfsohn, who taught him the standard classical fare.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=22}} Copland's first public music performance was at a [[Wanamaker's]] recital.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=18}}{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=23}} By the age of 15, after attending a concert by Polish composer-pianist [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]], Copland decided to become a composer.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=33}} After attempts to further his music study from a [[correspondence course]], Copland took formal lessons in [[harmony]], [[music theory|theory]], and [[Musical composition|composition]] from [[Rubin Goldmark]], a noted teacher and composer of American music (who had given [[George Gershwin]] three lessons). Goldmark, with whom Copland studied between 1917 and 1921, gave the young Copland a solid foundation, especially in the Germanic tradition.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=34}} As Copland stated later: &quot;This was a stroke of luck for me. I was spared the floundering that so many musicians have suffered through incompetent teaching.&quot;{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=23}} But Copland also commented that the maestro had &quot;little sympathy for the advanced musical idioms of the day&quot; and his &quot;approved&quot; composers ended with [[Richard Strauss]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=35}}

Copland's graduation piece from his studies with Goldmark was a three-movement piano [[sonata]] in a [[Romantic music|Romantic style]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=36}} But he had also composed more original and daring pieces which he did not share with his teacher.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=37}} In addition to regularly attending the [[Metropolitan Opera]] and the [[New York Symphony]], where he heard the standard classical repertory, Copland continued his musical development through an expanding circle of musical friends. After graduating from high school, Copland played in dance bands.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=39}} Continuing his musical education, he received further piano lessons from Victor Wittgenstein, who found his student to be &quot;quiet, shy, well-mannered, and gracious in accepting criticism&quot;.{{sfn|Smith|1953|pp=25, 31}} Copland's fascination with the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]] and its promise for freeing the lower classes drew a rebuke from his father and uncles.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=30}} In spite of that, in his early adult life Copland would develop friendships with people with socialist and communist leanings.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=237}}

=== Study in Paris ===
[[File:Nadia Boulanger 1925.jpg|thumb|Nadia Boulanger in 1925]]
Copland's passion for the latest European music, plus glowing letters from his friend Aaron Schaffer, inspired him to go to Paris for further study.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=33}} An article in ''[[Musical America]]'' about a summer school program for American musicians at the [[Fontainebleau School of Music]], offered by the French government, encouraged Copland still further.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=35}} His father wanted him to go to college, but his mother's vote in the family conference allowed him to give Paris a try. On arriving in [[France]], he studied at Fontainebleau with pianist and pedagogue [[Isidor Philipp]] and composer [[Paul Vidal]]. When Copland found Vidal too much like Goldmark, he switched at the suggestion of a fellow student to [[Nadia Boulanger]], then aged 34.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|pp=47–48, 50}} He had initial reservations: &quot;No one to my knowledge had ever before thought of studying with a woman.&quot;{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=41}} She interviewed him, and recalled later: &quot;One could tell his talent immediately.&quot;{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=41}}

Boulanger had as many as 40 students at once and employed a formal regimen that Copland had to follow. Copland found her incisive mind much to his liking and found her ability to critique a composition impeccable. Boulanger &quot;could always find the weak spot in a place you suspected was weak.... She could also tell you ''why'' it was weak [italics Copland].&quot;{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=63}} He wrote in a letter to his brother Ralph, &quot;This intellectual Amazon is not only professor at the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Conservatoire]], is not only familiar with all music from Bach to Stravinsky, but is prepared for anything worse in the way of dissonance. But make no mistake&amp;nbsp;... A more charming womanly woman never lived.&quot;{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=47}} Copland later wrote that &quot;it was wonderful for me to find a teacher with such openness of mind, while at the same time she held firm ideas of right and wrong in musical matters. The confidence she had in my talents and her belief in me were at the very least flattering and more—they were crucial to my development at this time of my career.&quot;{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=64}} Though he planned on only one year abroad, he studied with her for three years, finding her eclectic approach inspired his own broad musical taste.

Along with his studies with Boulanger, Copland took classes in French language and history at the [[Sorbonne]], attended plays, and frequented [[Shakespeare and Company (bookstore)|Shakespeare and Company]], the English-language bookstore that was a gathering-place for expatriate American writers.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=54–55}} Among this group in the heady cultural atmosphere of Paris in the 1920s were [[Paul Bowles]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[Gertrude Stein]], and [[Ezra Pound]], as well as artists like [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Marc Chagall]], and [[Amedeo Modigliani]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=51}} Also influential on the new music were the French intellectuals [[Marcel Proust]], [[Paul Valéry]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], and [[André Gide]]; the latter cited by Copland as being his personal favorite and most read.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=53–54}} Travels to Italy, Austria, and Germany rounded out Copland's musical education. During his stay in Paris, Copland began writing musical critiques, the first on [[Gabriel Fauré]], which helped spread his fame and stature in the music community.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=62}}

=== 1925 to 1935 ===
[[File:Kousewitzky.gif|thumb|left|[[Serge Koussevitzky]] was a mentor and supporter of Copland]]
Instead of wallowing in self-pity and self-destruction like many of the expatriate members of the [[Lost Generation]]{{weasel-inline|date=August 2020}}, Copland returned to America optimistic and enthusiastic about the future, determined to make his way as a full-time composer.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=55}} He rented a studio apartment on New York City's [[Upper West Side]] in the [[The Empire Hotel (New York City)|Empire Hotel]], close to [[Carnegie Hall]] and other musical venues and publishers. He remained in that area for the next thirty years, later moving to [[Westchester County, New York]]. Copland lived frugally and survived financially with help from two $2,500 [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]s in 1925 and 1926 (each of the two {{Inflation|US|2500|1925|fmt=eq}}).{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=89}} Lecture-recitals, awards, appointments, and small commissions, plus some teaching, writing, and personal loans kept him afloat in the subsequent years through World War II.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=90}} Also important, especially during the Depression, were wealthy patrons who underwrote performances, helped pay for publication of works and promoted musical events and composers.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=90}} Among those mentors was [[Serge Koussevitzky]], the music director of the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] and known as a champion of &quot;new music&quot;. Koussevitsky would prove to be very influential in Copland's life, and was perhaps the second most important figure in his career after Boulanger.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=121–22}} Beginning with the [[Symphony for Organ and Orchestra (Copland)|Symphony for Organ and Orchestra]] (1924), Koussevitzky would perform more of Copland's music than that of any the composer's contemporaries, at a time when other conductors were programming only a few of Copland's works.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=123}}

Soon after his return to the United States, Copland was exposed to the artistic circle of photographer [[Alfred Stieglitz]]. While Copland did not care for Stieglitz's domineering attitude, he admired his work and took to heart Stieglitz's conviction that American artists should reflect &quot;the ideas of American Democracy&quot;.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=101}} This ideal influenced not just the composer but also a generation of artists and photographers, including [[Paul Strand]], [[Edward Weston]], [[Ansel Adams]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], and [[Walker Evans]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=101}} Evans' photographs inspired portions of Copland's opera ''[[The Tender Land]]''.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=103}}

In his quest to take up the slogan of the Stieglitz group, &quot;Affirm America&quot;, Copland found only the music of [[Carl Ruggles]] and [[Charles Ives]] upon which to draw.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=101, 110}} Without what Copland called a &quot;usable past&quot; in American classical composers, he looked toward jazz and popular music, something he had already started to do while in Europe.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=113}}  In the 1920s, [[George Gershwin]], [[Bessie Smith]], and [[Louis Armstrong]] were in the forefront of American popular music and jazz.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=115–16}} By the end of the decade, Copland felt his music was going in a more abstract, less jazz-oriented direction.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|pp=134–35}} However, as large swing bands such as those of [[Benny Goodman]] and [[Glenn Miller]] became popular in the 1930s, Copland took a renewed interest in the genre.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=116}}

[[File:Portrait of Alfred Stieglitz 1935 Apr 17.jpg|thumb|Copland admired the work and philosophy of [[Alfred Stieglitz]] ]]
Inspired by the example of [[Les Six]] in France, Copland sought out contemporaries such as [[Roger Sessions]], [[Roy Harris]], [[Virgil Thomson]], and [[Walter Piston]], and quickly established himself as a spokesman for composers of his generation.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=159}} He also helped found the Copland-Sessions Concerts to showcase these composers' chamber works to new audiences.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=166–67}} Copland's relationship with these men, who became known as &quot;commando unit&quot;, was one of both support and rivalry, and he played a key role in keeping them together until after World War II.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=176}} He was also generous with his time with nearly every American young composer he met during his life, later earning the title &quot;Dean of American Music&quot;.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=178, 215}}

With the knowledge he had gained from his studies in Paris, Copland came into demand as a lecturer and writer on contemporary European [[classical music]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=58}} From 1927 to 1930 and 1935 to 1938, he taught classes at [[The New School|The New School of Social Research]] in New York City.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=58}} Eventually, his New School lectures would appear in the form of two books—''What to Listen for in Music'' (1937, revised 1957) and ''Our New Music'' (1940, revised 1968 and retitled ''The New Music: 1900–1960'').{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=58}} During this period, Copland also wrote regularly for ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Musical Quarterly]]'' and a number of other journals. These articles would appear in 1969 as the book ''Copland on Music''.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=58}}

Copland's compositions in the early 1920s reflected the modernist attitude that prevailed among intellectuals, that the arts need be accessible to only a cadre of the enlightened and that the masses would come to appreciate their efforts over time. However, mounting troubles with the ''Symphonic Ode'' (1929) and ''Short Symphony'' (1933) caused him to rethink this approach. It was financially contradictory, particularly in the Depression. Avant-garde music had lost what cultural historian [[Morris Dickstein]] calls &quot;its buoyant experimental edge&quot; and the national mood toward it had changed.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=91}} As biographer [[Howard Pollack]] points out,{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=158}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Copland observed two trends among composers in the 1930s: first, a continuing attempt to &quot;simplify their musical language&quot; and, second, a desire to &quot;make contact&quot; with as wide an audience as possible. Since 1927, he had been in the process of simplifying, or at least paring down, his musical language, though in such a manner as to sometimes have the effect, paradoxically, of estranging audiences and performers. By 1933 ... he began to find ways to make his starkly personal language accessible to a surprisingly large number of people.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In many ways, this shift mirrored the German idea of {{lang|de|[[Gebrauchsmusik]]}} (&quot;music for use&quot;), as composers sought to create music that could serve a utilitarian as well as artistic purpose. This approach encompassed two trends: first, music that students could easily learn, and second, music which would have wider appeal, such as incidental music for plays, movies, radio, etc.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=162}} Toward this end, Copland provided musical advice and inspiration to [[Group Theatre (New York)|The Group Theatre]], a company which also attracted [[Stella Adler]], [[Elia Kazan]] and [[Lee Strasberg]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=258}} Philosophically an outgrowth of Stieglitz and his ideals, the Group focused on socially relevant plays by the American authors.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=257}} Through it and later his work in film, Copland met several major American playwrights, including [[Thornton Wilder]], [[William Inge]], [[Arthur Miller]], and [[Edward Albee]], and considered projects with all of them.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=267}}

Around 1935 Copland began to compose musical pieces for young audiences, in accordance with the first goal of American Gebrauchsmusik.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=303}} These works included piano pieces (''The Young Pioneers'') and an opera (''[[The Second Hurricane]]'').{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=303–05}} During the Depression years, Copland traveled extensively to Europe, Africa, and Mexico. He formed an important friendship with Mexican composer [[Carlos Chávez]] and would return often to Mexico for working vacations conducting engagements.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=178, 226}} During his initial visit to Mexico, Copland began composing the first of his signature works, ''[[El Salón México]]'', which he completed in 1936. In it and in ''The Second Hurricane'' Copland began &quot;experimenting&quot;, as he phrased it, with a simpler, more accessible style.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=245}} This and other incidental commissions fulfilled the second goal of American Gebrauchsmusik, creating music of wide appeal.

[[File:Carlos Chavez.jpg|thumb|Carlos Chávez in 1937]]
Concurrent with ''The Second Hurricane'', Copland composed (for radio broadcast) &quot;Prairie Journal&quot; on a commission from the [[Columbia Broadcast System]].{{Sfn|Pollack|1999|p=310}} This was one of his first pieces to convey the landscape of the American West.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=312}} This emphasis on the frontier carried over to his ballet ''[[Billy the Kid (ballet)|Billy the Kid]]'' (1938), which along with ''El Salón México'' became his first widespread public success.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=187}}{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=323}} Copland's ballet music established him as an authentic composer of American music much as Stravinsky's ballet scores connected the composer with Russian music and came at an opportune time.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=184}} He helped fill a vacuum for American choreographers to fill their dance repertory{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=185}} and tapped into an artistic groundswell, from the motion pictures of [[Busby Berkeley]] and [[Fred Astaire]] to the ballets of [[George Balanchine]] and [[Martha Graham]], to both democratize and Americanize dance as an art form.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=94}} In 1939, Copland completed his first two Hollywood film scores, for ''[[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|Of Mice and Men]]'' and ''[[Our Town (1940 film)|Our Town]]'', and composed the radio score &quot;John Henry&quot;, based on [[John Henry (folklore)|the folk ballad]].{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=169}}

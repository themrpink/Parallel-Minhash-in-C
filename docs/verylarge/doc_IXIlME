For most of recorded history, capital punishments were often cruel and inhumane. Severe historical penalties include [[breaking wheel]], [[boiling to death]], [[flaying]], [[slow slicing]], [[disembowelment]], [[crucifixion]], [[impalement]], [[Crushing (execution)|crushing]], [[stoning]], [[execution by burning]], [[dismemberment]], [[sawing (torture)|sawing]], [[decapitation]], [[scaphism]], or [[necklacing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950826,00.html|title=The Death Penalty :Revenge Is the Mother of Invention|date=24 January 1983|journal=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Lingchi]]'', also known as ''Slow slicing'' or ''death by/of a thousand cuts'', was a form of [[execution]] used in China from roughly 900 AD to its abolition in 1905. According to apocryphal lore, ''lingchi'' began when the torturer, wielding an extremely sharp knife, began by putting out the eyes, rendering the condemned incapable of seeing the remainder of the torture and, presumably, adding considerably to the psychological terror of the procedure. Successive rather minor cuts chopped off ears, nose, tongue, fingers, toes, and such before proceeding to grosser cuts that removed large collops of flesh from more sizable parts, e.g., thighs and shoulders. The entire process was said to last three days, and to total 3,600 cuts. The heavily carved bodies of the deceased were then put on a parade for a show in the public. More typical was to bribe the executioner to administer hasty death to the victim after a small number of dramatic slices inflicted for showmanship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereventsguide.co.uk/feature/Death_by_a_Thousand_Cuts_at_Chinese_Arts_Centre_18th_January_to_23rd_March/114.html|title=Death by a Thousand Cuts at Chinese Arts Centre until 23rd March|website=manchestereventsguide.co.uk|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418031632/http://www.manchestereventsguide.co.uk/feature/Death_by_a_Thousand_Cuts_at_Chinese_Arts_Centre_18th_January_to_23rd_March/114.html|archivedate=18 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{bettersourceneeded|date=October 2020}}&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, H.

''Impalement'' was a method of torture and [[execution (legal)|execution]] whereby a person is pierced with a long stake. The penetration can be through the sides, from the [[rectum]], or through the [[Human mouth|mouth]] or [[vagina]]. This method would lead to slow, painful, death. Often, the victim was hoisted into the air after partial impalement. Gravity and the victim's own struggles would cause him to slide down the pole. Death could take many days. Impalement was frequently practiced in Asia and Europe throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. [[Vlad III Dracula]] and [[Ivan the Terrible]] have passed into legend as major users of the method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9382120/Dracula Dracula – Britannica Concise] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''breaking wheel'' was a torturous [[capital punishment]] device used in the [[Middle Ages]] and early modern times for public execution by [[Club (weapon)|cudgeling]] to death, especially in France and Germany. In France the condemned were placed on a cart-wheel with their limbs stretched out along the spokes over two sturdy wooden beams. The wheel was made to slowly revolve. Through the openings between the spokes, the executioner hit the victim with an iron hammer that could easily break the victim's bones. This process was repeated several times per limb. Once his bones were broken, he was left on the wheel to die. It could take hours, even days, before shock and dehydration caused death. The punishment was abolished in Germany as late as 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Wheel, Breaking on the |volume=28 |page=586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
The word 'torture' comes from the French ''torture'', originating in the [[Late Latin]] ''tortura'' and ultimately deriving the [[past participle]] of ''torquere'' meaning 'to twist'.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0877797137 &quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's collegiate dictionary, 10th Edition |publisher=Merriam-Webster |location=Springfield, Mass |year=1999 |page= 1246|isbn=978-0-87779-713-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The word is also used loosely to describe more ordinary discomforts that would be accurately described as tedious rather than painful; for example, &quot;making this spreadsheet was torture!&quot;

According to Diderot's ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', torture was also referred to as &quot;the question&quot; in seventeenth-century France. This term is derived from the use of torture in criminal cases: as the accused is tortured, the torturers would typically ask questions to the accused in an effort to learn more about the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;rgn=main;view=text;idno=did2222.0000.891 | title = Question or Torture | journal = Encyclopedia of Diderot &amp; d'Alembert – Collaborative Translation Project | accessdate = 1 April 2015| date = February 2008 | last1 = d'Argis (Biography) | first1 = Antoine-Gaspard Boucher }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Religious perspectives}}

==Religious perspectives==

===Roman Catholic Church===
{{main|Inquisition|Spanish Inquisition|Medieval Inquisition}}
{{see also|Christian views on Hell#Roman Catholicism}}

Throughout the [[Early Middle Ages]], the [[Catholic Church]] generally opposed the use of torture during criminal proceedings. This is evident from a letter sent by Pope [[Pope Nicholas I|Saint Nicholas]] the Great to [[Boris I of Bulgaria|Khan Boris]] of the Bulgars in AD 866, delivered in response to a series of questions from the former and concerned with the ongoing [[Christianization of Bulgaria|Christianisation of Bulgaria]]. ''Ad Consulta Vestra'' (as entitled in Latin) declared judicial torture to be a practice that was fundamentally contrary to [[divine law]].&lt;ref name=&quot;legacy.fordham.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Responses of Pope Nicholas I to the Questions of the Bulgars, 866|url=http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/866nicholas-bulgar.asp=27}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pontiff made it a point of incontrovertible truth that, in his own words: &quot;confession [to a crime] should be spontaneous, not compelled, and should not be elicited with violence but rather proferred voluntarily&quot;. He argued for an alternative and more humane procedure, in which the accused person would be required to swear an oath of innocence upon the &quot;holy Gospel that he did not commit [the crime] which is laid against him and from that moment on the matter is [to be put] at an end&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;legacy.fordham.edu&quot;/&gt; Nicholas likewise stressed in the same letter that &quot;those who refuse to receive the good of Christianity and sacrifice and bend their knees to idols&quot; were to be moved towards accepting the true faith &quot;by warnings, exhortations, and reason rather than by force,&quot; emphasising to this end that &quot;violence should by no means be inflicted upon them to make them believe. For everything which is not voluntary, cannot be good&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;legacy.fordham.edu&quot;/&gt;

In the High Middle Ages, the Church became increasingly concerned with the perceived threat posed to its existence by resurgent heresy, in particular, that attributed to a purported sect known as the [[Cathars]]. Catharism had its roots in the Paulician movement in Armenia and eastern Byzantine Anatolia and the [[Bogomils]] of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. Consequently, the Church began to enjoin secular rulers to extirpate heresy (lest the ruler's Catholic subjects are absolved from their allegiance), and in order to coerce heretics or witnesses &quot;into confessing their errors and accusing others,&quot; decided to sanction the use of methods of torture, already utilized by secular governments in other criminal procedures due to the [[Medieval Roman law|recovery of Roman Law]], in the medieval inquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canons of the Fourth Lateran Council, 1215|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/lateran4.asp|website=canon 3|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SS Innocentius IV – Bulla 'Ad_Extirpanda'|url=http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/01p/1252-05-15,_SS_Innocentius_IV,_Bulla_%27Ad_Extirpanda%27,_EN.pdf|website=1252|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pope Innocent IV, in the Bull [[Ad extirpanda]] (15 May 1252), stipulated that the inquisitors were to &quot;stop short of danger to life or limb&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad extirpanda'', quoted at [http://www.rtforum.org/lt/lt119.html ''The Roman Theological Forum'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern Church's views regarding torture have changed drastically, largely reverting to the earlier stance. In 1953, in an address to the 6th International Congress of Penal Law, Pope Pius XII approvingly reiterated the position of Pope Nicholas the Great over a thousand years before him, when his predecessor had unilaterally opposed the use of judicial torture, stating: {{quotation|
Preliminary juridical proceedings must exclude physical and psychological torture and the use of drugs: first of all, because they violate a natural right, even if the accused is indeed guilty, and secondly because all too often they give rise to erroneous results...About eleven hundred years ago, in 866, the great Pope Nicholas I replied in the following way to a question posed by a people which had just come into contact with Christianity:
'If a thief or a bandit is caught, and denies what is imputed to him, you say among you that the judge should beat him on the head with blows and pierce his sides with iron spikes, until he speaks the truth. That, neither divine nor human law admits: the confession must not be forced, but spontaneous; it must not be extorted, but voluntary; lastly, if it happens that, after having inflicted these sufferings, you discover absolutely nothing concerning that with which you have charged the accused, are you not ashamed then at least, and do you not recognize how impious your judgment was? Likewise, if the accused, unable to bear such tortures, admits to crimes which he has not committed, who, I ask you, has the responsibility for such an impiety? Is it not he who forced him to such a deceitful confession? Furthermore, if some one utters with his lips what is not in his mind, it is well known that he is not confessing, he is merely speaking. Put away these things, then, and hate from the bottom of your heart what heretofore you have had the folly to practice; in truth, what fruit did you then draw from that of which you are now ashamed?'
Who would not wish that, during the long period of time elapsed since then, justice had never laid this rule aside! The need to recall the warning given eleven hundred years ago is a sad sign of the miscarriages of juridical practice in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pope Pius XII: 6th International Congress of Penal Law |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gyIgwz_lDGkC&amp;pg=PA161|website=1252|isbn=9789287145147|last1=Carpentier|first1=Jean|last2=Council For Cultural Co-Operation|first2=Council of Europe|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Thus, the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' (published in 1994) condemns the use of torture as a grave violation of [[human rights]]. In No. 2297-2298 it states:

{{quotation|
Torture, which uses physical or moral violence to extract confessions, punish the guilty, frighten opponents, or satisfy hatred is contrary to respect for the person and for human dignity... In times past, cruel practices were commonly used by legitimate governments to maintain law and order, often without protest from the Pastors of the Church, who themselves adopted in their own tribunals the prescriptions of Roman law concerning torture. Regrettable as these facts are, the Church always taught the duty of clemency and mercy. She forbade clerics to shed blood. In recent times it has become evident that these cruel practices were neither necessary for public order nor in conformity with the legitimate rights of the human person. On the contrary, these practices led to ones even more degrading. It is necessary to work for their abolition. We must pray for the victims and their tormentors. }}

===Sharia law===
The prevalent view among jurists of [[sharia law]] is that torture is not permitted under any circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cjil/vol8/iss1/4/ Reza, Sadiq (2007) ''Torture and Islamic Law,'' Chicago Journal of International Law: Vol. 8: No. 1, Article 4.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Banchoff|first1=Thomas|title=Democracy and the New Religious Pluralism|date=2007|page=147|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=98C_ii1-2RYC&amp;q=hudud|isbn=9780195307221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Judaism===
Torture has no presence within ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law). There did once exist a system of [[capital and corporal punishment in Judaism]], as well as a [[Flagellation#Judaism|flagellation]] statute for non-capital offences, but it was all abolished by the [[Sanhedrin]] during the [[Second Temple period]].

[[Maimonides]] issued a ruling in the case of a man who was ordered by a [[beth din]] (religious court) to divorce his wife and refused that &quot;we coerce him until he states 'I want to.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Maimoides; ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' Hilkhot Gerushin 2:20&lt;/ref&gt; This is only true in cases where specific grounds for the verdict exist.&lt;ref&gt;Malinowitz, Chaim;[http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/getart3.html &quot;The New York State Get Bill and its Halachic Ramifications&quot;]; ''Jewish Law Articles''&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, some activist rabbis had interpreted this statement to mean that torture could be applied against husbands in troubled marriages in order to force them into granting ''[[Get (divorce document)|gittin]]'' (religious divorces) to their wives.&lt;ref&gt;Samaha, Albert (4 December 2013) [http://www.villagevoice.com/news/bad-rabbi-tales-of-extortion-and-torture-depict-a-divorce-brokers-brutal-grip-on-the-orthodox-community-6440276 &quot;Bad Rabbi: Tales of Extortion and Torture Depict a Divorce Broker's Brutal Grip on the Orthodox Community&quot;], ''Village Voice''&lt;/ref&gt; One such group, the [[New York divorce coercion gang]], was broken up by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Reuven (22 April 2015) [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/orthodox-rabbi-guilty-kidnapping-beating-jewish-husbands-article-1.2193597/ &quot;N.J.

==Laws against torture==
On 10 December 1948, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR). Article 5 states, &quot;No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html Universal Declaration of Human Rights], United Nations, 10 December 1948&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, a number of other international treaties have been adopted to prevent the use of torture. The most notable treaties relating to torture are the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] and the [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Conventions of 1949]] and their [[Protocol I|Additional Protocols I]] and [[Protocol II|II]] of 8 June 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/faq/torture-law-2011-06-24.htm |title=What does the law say about torture? |publisher=[[International Committee of the Red Cross]]|date=24 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations Convention Against Torture===
The [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]] came into force in June 1987. The most relevant articles are Articles 1, 2, 3, and 16.

{{quotation|Article 1&lt;br /&gt;
1. For the purposes of this Convention, the word &quot;torture&quot; means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.&lt;br /&gt;
2. This article is without prejudice to any international instrument or national legislation which does or may contain provisions of wider application.}}

{{quotation|Article 2&lt;br /&gt;
1. Each State Party shall take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent acts of torture in any territory under its jurisdiction.&lt;br /&gt;
2. No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of [[war]] or a threat of war, internal [[Failed state|political instability]] or any other [[State of emergency|public emergency]], may be invoked as a justification of torture.&lt;br /&gt;
3. An [[Superior Orders|order from a superior officer or a public authority]] may not be invoked as a justification of torture.}}

{{quotation|Article 3&lt;br /&gt;
1. No State Party shall expel, return (&quot;refouler&quot;) or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.&lt;br /&gt;
2. For the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds, the competent authorities shall take into account all relevant considerations including, where applicable, the existence in the State concerned of a consistent pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights.}}

{{quotation|Article 16&lt;br /&gt;
1. Each State Party shall undertake to prevent in any territory under its jurisdiction other acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment which do not amount to torture as defined in Article I when such acts are committed by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. In particular, the obligations contained in articles 10, 11, 12 and 13 shall apply with the substitution for references to torture of references to other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&lt;br /&gt;
2. The provisions of this Convention are without prejudice to the provisions of any other international instrument or national law which prohibits cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or which relates to extradition or expulsion.}}

The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]], which established the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), provides for criminal prosecution of individuals responsible for [[genocide]], [[war crime]]s, and [[crimes against humanity]]. The statute defines torture as &quot;intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, upon a person in the custody or under the control of the accused; except that torture shall not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to, lawful sanctions&quot;.

===Geneva Conventions===
The four [[Geneva Conventions]] provide protection for people who fall into enemy hands.
The conventions do not clearly divide people into [[combatant]] and [[non-combatant]] roles. The conventions refer to:
* &quot;wounded and sick combatants or non-combatants&quot;
* &quot;civilian persons who take no part in hostilities, and who, while they reside in the zones, perform no work of a military character&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Fourth Geneva Convention|Fourth Geneva Convention]], Article 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* &quot;Members of the [[armed forces]] of a Party to the conflict as well as members of [[militias]] or [[Military volunteer|volunteer corps]] forming part of such armed forces&quot;
* &quot;Members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps, including those of organized [[resistance movements]] belonging to a Party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory, even if this [[Military occupation|territory is occupied]]&quot;
* &quot;Members of regular armed forces who profess allegiance to a government or an authority not recognized by the Detaining Power&quot;
* &quot;Persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof, such as civilian members of [[military aircraft]] crews, [[war correspondent]]s, supply contractors, members of labour units or of services responsible for the welfare of the armed forces&quot;
* &quot;Members of crews, including masters, pilots, and apprentices, of the [[merchant marine]] and the crews of [[civil aircraft]] of the Parties to the conflict&quot;
* &quot;Inhabitants of a non-occupied territory, who on the approach of the enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Third Geneva Convention|Third Geneva Convention]], Article 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[first Geneva Convention|first]] (GCI), [[second Geneva Convention|second]] (GCII), [[third Geneva Convention|third]] (GCIII), and [[fourth Geneva Convention|fourth]] (GCIV) Geneva Conventions are the four most relevant for the treatment of the victims of conflicts. All treaties states in Article 3, in similar wording, that in a non-international armed conflict, &quot;Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms... shall in all circumstances be treated humanely.&quot; The treaty also states that there must not be any &quot;violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, [[mutilation]], cruel treatment and torture&quot; or &quot;outrages upon personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading treatment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:First Geneva Convention|First Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Second Geneva Convention|Second Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Third Geneva Convention|Third Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Fourth Geneva Convention|Fourth Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

GCI covers wounded combatants in an international armed conflict. Under Article 12, members of the armed forces who are sick or wounded &quot;shall be respected and protected in all circumstances. They shall be treated humanely and cared for by the Party to the conflict in whose power they may be, without any adverse distinction founded on sex, race, nationality, religion, political opinions, or any other similar criteria. Any attempts upon their lives, or violence to their persons, shall be strictly prohibited; in particular, they shall not be murdered or exterminated, subjected to torture or to biological experiments&quot;.

GCII covers shipwreck survivors at sea in an international armed conflict. Under Article 12, persons &quot;who are at sea and who are wounded, sick or shipwrecked, shall be respected and protected in all circumstances, it being understood that the term &quot;shipwreck&quot; means shipwreck from any cause and includes forced landings at sea by or from aircraft. Such persons shall be treated humanely and cared for by the Parties to the conflict in whose power they may be, without any adverse distinction founded on sex, race, nationality, religion, political opinions, or any other similar criteria. Any attempts upon their lives, or violence to their persons, shall be strictly prohibited; in particular, they shall not be murdered or exterminated, subjected to torture or to biological experiments&quot;.

GCIII covers the treatment of [[prisoners of war]] (POWs) in an international armed conflict. In particular, Article 17 says that &quot;No physical or mental torture, nor any other form of coercion, may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from them information of any kind whatever. Prisoners of war who refuse to answer may not be threatened, insulted or exposed to unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind.&quot; POW status under GCIII has far fewer exemptions than &quot;Protected Person&quot; status under GCIV. Captured combatants in an international armed conflict automatically have the protection of GCIII and are POWs under GCIII unless they are determined by a competent tribunal to not be a POW (GCIII Article 5).

GCIV covers most [[civilian]]s in an international armed conflict, and says they are usually &quot;Protected Persons&quot; (see exemptions section immediately after this for those who are not). Under Article 32, civilians have the right to protection from &quot;murder, torture, corporal punishments, mutilation, and medical or scientific experiments...but also to any other measures of brutality whether applied by civilian or military agents.&quot;

====Geneva Convention IV exemptions====
GCIV provides an important exemption:
{{quotation|Where in the territory of a Party to the conflict, the latter is satisfied that an individual protected person is definitely suspected of or engaged in activities hostile to the security of the State, such individual person shall not be entitled to claim such rights and privileges under the present Convention [ie GCIV] as would ... be prejudicial to the security of such State ... In each case, such persons shall nevertheless be treated with humanity (GCIV Article 5)}}

Also, nationals of a State not bound by the Convention are not protected by it, and nationals of a neutral State in the territory of a combatant State, and nationals of a co-belligerent State, cannot claim the protection of GCIV if their home state has normal diplomatic representation in the State that holds them (Article 4), as their diplomatic representatives can take steps to protect them. The requirement to treat persons with &quot;humanity&quot; implies that it is still prohibited to torture individuals not protected by the Convention.

The [[George W. Bush administration]] afforded fewer protections, under GCIII, to detainees in the &quot;[[War on Terror]]&quot; by codifying the legal status of an &quot;[[unlawful combatant]]&quot;. If there is a question of whether a person is a lawful combatant, he (or she) must be treated as a POW &quot;until their status has been determined by a competent tribunal&quot; (GCIII Article 5). If the tribunal decides that he is an unlawful combatant, he is not considered a protected person under GCIII. However, if he is a protected person under GCIV he still has some protection under GCIV and must be &quot;treated with humanity and, in case of trial, shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed by the present Convention&quot; (GCIV Article 5).&lt;ref group=nb&gt;
&quot;Every person in enemy hands must have some status under international law: he is either a prisoner of war and, as such, covered by the Third Convention, a civilian covered by the Fourth Convention, or again, a member of the medical personnel of the armed forces who is covered by the First Convention. ''There is no'' intermediate status; nobody in enemy hands can be outside the law. We feel that this is a satisfactory solution – not only satisfying to the mind but also, and above all, satisfactory from the humanitarian point of view.&quot;, because in the opinion of the ICRC &quot;If civilians directly engage in hostilities, they are considered 'unlawful' or 'unprivileged' combatants or belligerents (the treaties of humanitarian law do not expressly contain these terms). They may be prosecuted under the domestic law of the detaining state for such action&quot; ([[Jean Pictet]] (ed.) – [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600007?OpenDocument Commentary: IV Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (1958)] – 1994 reprint edition). [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/7c4d08d9b287a42141256739003e636b/f6c8b9fee14a77fdc125641e0052b079 Geneva Conventions Protocol I] Article 51.3 also covers this interpretation &quot;Civilians shall enjoy the protection afforded by this section, unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions====
There are two additional protocols to the Geneva Convention: [[Protocol I]] (1977), relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts and [[Protocol II]] (1977), relating to the protection of victims of non-international armed conflicts. These clarify and extend the definitions in some areas, but to date, many countries, including the United States, have either not signed them or have not ratified them.

[[Protocol I]] does not mention torture but it does affect the treatment of POWs and Protected Persons. In Article 5, the protocol explicitly involves &quot;the appointment of Protecting Powers and of their substitute&quot; to monitor that the Parties to the conflict are enforcing the Conventions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080410223403/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/protocol1.htm Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol 1)], Diplomatic Conference on the Reaffirmation and Development of International Humanitarian Law applicable in Armed Conflicts, 8 June 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; The protocol also broadens the definition of a lawful combatant in wars against &quot;alien occupation, colonial domination, and racist regimes&quot; to include those who carry arms openly but are not wearing uniforms, so that they are now [[lawful combatant]]s and protected by the Geneva Conventions—although only if the Occupying Power has ratified Protocol I. Under the original conventions, combatants without a recognizable insignia could be treated as war criminals, and potentially be executed. It also mentions spies and defines who is a mercenary. Mercenaries and spies are considered an unlawful combatant, and not protected by the same conventions.

[[Protocol II]] &quot;develops and supplements Article 3 [relating to the protection of victims of non-international armed conflicts] common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 without modifying its existing conditions of application&quot; (Article 1). Any person who does not take part in or ceased to take part in hostilities is entitled to humane treatment. Among the acts prohibited against these persons are, &quot;Violence to the life, health and physical or mental well-being of persons, in particular, murder as well as cruel treatment such as torture, mutilation or any form of corporal punishment&quot; (Article 4.a), &quot;Outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment, rape, enforced prostitution and any form of indecent assault&quot; (Article 4.e), and &quot;Threats to commit any of the foregoing acts&quot; (Article 4.h).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080612085204/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/protocol2.htm Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II)], Diplomatic Conference on the Reaffirmation and Development of International Humanitarian Law applicable in Armed Conflicts, 8 June 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Clauses in other articles implore humane treatment of enemy personnel in an internal conflict. These have a bearing on torture, but no other clauses explicitly mention torture.

===Other conventions===
In accordance with the optional [[UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners]] (1955), ''&quot;[[corporal punishment]], punishment by placing in a dark cell, and all cruel, inhuman or degrading punishments shall be completely prohibited as punishments for disciplinary offences.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080718003225/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_comp34.htm Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners], United Nations, Geneva, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], (16 December 1966), explicitly prohibits torture and ''&quot;cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&quot;'' by signatories.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights] United Nations, 16 December 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

;European agreements
[[File:10CFREU-Article4.jpg|right|thumb|Article 4 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] prohibits torture.]]

In 1950 during the [[Cold War]], the participating member states of the [[Council of Europe]] signed the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. The treaty was based on the [[UDHR]]. It included the provision for a court to interpret the treaty, and Article 3 '''&quot;Prohibition of torture&quot;''' stated; ''&quot;No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm European Convention on Human Rights], 4 November 1950(with later protocols).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that the [[five techniques]] of &quot;[[sensory deprivation]]&quot; were not torture as laid out in Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, but were &quot;''inhuman or degrading treatment''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1978/1.html Ireland v. United Kingdom, 1977]. (Case No. 5310/71)&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Uses of torture in recent times#United Kingdom|Accusations of use of torture by United Kingdom]] for details). This case occurred nine years before the United Nations Convention Against Torture came into force and had an influence on thinking about what constitutes torture ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Michael John Garcia (Legislative Attorney American Law Division) [http://www.ilw.com/immigdaily/news/2005,1223-crs.pdf U.N. Convention Against Torture (CAT):Overview and Application to Interrogation Techniques] [http://www.ilw.com/ CRS Report for Congress] 7 November 2005. pp. 13–15&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 November 1987, the member states of the [[Council of Europe]], meeting at [[Strasbourg]], adopted the [[European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]] (ECPT). Two additional Protocols amended the Convention, which entered into force on 1 March 2002. The Convention set up the [[Committee for the Prevention of Torture]] to oversee compliance with its provisions.

;Inter-American Convention
The [[Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture]], currently ratified by 18 nations of the [[Americas]] and in force since 28 February 1987, defines torture more expansively than the United Nations Convention Against Torture.

{{quotation|For the purposes of this Convention, torture shall be understood to be any act intentionally performed whereby physical or mental pain or suffering is inflicted on a person for purposes of a criminal investigation, as a means of intimidation, as personal punishment, as a preventive measure, as a penalty, or for any other purpose. Torture shall also be understood to be the use of methods upon a person intended to obliterate the personality of the victim or to diminish his physical or mental capacities, even if they do not cause physical pain or mental anguish.

The concept of torture shall not include physical or mental pain or suffering that is inherent in or solely the consequence of lawful measures, provided that they do not include the performance of the acts or use of the methods referred to in this article.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1985&quot;/&gt;}}

===Supervision of anti-torture treaties===
The [[Istanbul Protocol]], an official UN document, is the first set of international guidelines for documentation of torture and its consequences. It became a United Nations official document in 1999.

In addition to the observation of the intermediate vector mesons, the CERN [[Proton-Antiproton Collider]] dominated the scene of high energy physics from its first operation in 1981 until its close in 1991, when the [[Tevatron]] at [[Fermilab]] took over this role. An entirely new phenomenology of high energy collisions has resulted, in which strong interaction phenomena are dominated by the exchange of the quanta of the strong force, the [[gluon]]s, particles which are similar to the intermediate vector bosons, although, like the photons, they are apparently massless. Instead, the W and Z particles are among the heaviest particles so far produced in a particle accelerator.

Together, these discoveries provide strong evidence that theoretical physicists are on the right track in their efforts to describe Nature at its most basic level through the so-called &quot;[[Standard Model]]&quot;. The data on the intermediate vector bosons confirm the predictions included in the &quot;electroweak&quot; theory, which gained the 1979 Nobel Prize for Physics to [[Steven Weinberg]], [[Sheldon Glashow]] and [[Abdus Salam]]. The &quot;electroweak&quot; theory attempts to unite two of the four forces of nature—the weak and the electromagnetic forces—under the same set of equations. It provides the basis for work on the long-standing dream of the theoretical physicists, a [[unified field theory]], encompassing also the strong force which binds together the atomic nucleus, and ultimately, [[gravity]].

In 1970 Rubbia was appointed Higgins Professor of Physics at [[Harvard University]], where he spent one semester per year for 18 years,&lt;ref name = CVCR /&gt; while continuing his research activities at CERN. In 1989, he was appointed Director-General of the CERN Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/1731464/ |title=Looking to the future |accessdate=1 September 2015 |website=CERN Courier |publisher=CERN}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his mandate, in 1993, &quot;CERN agreed to allow anybody to use the Web protocol and code free of charge … without any royalty or other constraint&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Berners-Lee, T., Fischetti, M., &amp; Foreword By-Dertouzos, M. L. (2000). Weaving the Web: The original design and ultimate destiny of the World Wide Web by its inventor. HarperInformation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubbia has also been one of the leaders in a collaboration effort deep in the [[Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso|Gran Sasso Laboratory]], designed to detect any sign of decay of the proton. The experiment seeks evidence that would disprove the conventional belief that matter is stable. The most widely accepted version of the unified field theories predicts that protons do not last forever, but gradually decay into energy after an average lifetime of at least 10&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; years. The same experiment, known as [[ICARUS (experiment)|ICARUS]] and based on a new technique of electronic detection of ionizing events in ultra-pure liquid [[argon]], is aiming at the direct detection of the neutrinos emitted from the Sun, a first rudimentary neutrino telescope to explore neutrino signals of cosmic nature.

Rubbia further proposed the concept of an [[energy amplifier]], a novel and safe way of producing nuclear energy exploiting present-day accelerator technologies, which is actively being studied worldwide in order to incinerate high activity waste from nuclear reactors, and produce energy from natural [[thorium]] and depleted [[uranium]]. In 2013 he proposed building a large number of small-scale thorium power plants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Boyle |first=Rebecca |url=http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2010-08/thorium-reactors-could-wean-world-oil-just-five-years |title=Development of Tiny Thorium Reactors Could Wean the World Off Oil In Just Five Years &amp;#124; Popular Science |publisher=Popsci.com |date=2010-08-30 |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubbia's research activities are concentrated on the problem of energy supply for the future, with particular focus on the development of new technologies for renewable energy sources. During his term as President of [[ENEA (Italy)|ENEA]] (1999–2005) he has promoted a novel method for [[Concentrated solar power|concentrating solar power]] at high temperatures for energy production, known as the [[Archimede combined cycle power plant|Archimede Project]], which is being developed by industry for commercial use.

Carlo Rubbia was principal Scientific Adviser of [[CIEMAT]] ([[Spain]]),  a member of the high-level Advisory Group on [[Climate change|global warming]] set up by EU's President Barroso in 2007 and of the Board of Trustees at the [[IMDEA]] Energy Institute. In 2009–2010 he was Special Adviser for Energy to the Secretary General of ECLAC, the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, based in Santiago (Chile). In June 2010 Carlo Rubbia has been appointed Scientific Director of the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies in Potsdam (Germany).

He is a member of the [[Italy-USA Foundation]].

==Awards and honors==
In December 1984, Rubbia was nominated Cavaliere di Gran Croce [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic|OMRI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Di Laura Laurenzi |url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1984/12/19/pertini-festeggia-rubbia.html |title=Pertini Festeggia Rubbia – La Repubblica |language=it |publisher=Ricerca.repubblica.it |date=1984-12-19 |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has a population of c. 73,086.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tuttitalia |title=Popolazione Pavia 2001-2018 |url=https://www.tuttitalia.it/lombardia/56-pavia/statistiche/popolazione-andamento-demografico/ |website=Tuttitalia |publisher=2019 Gwind srl |accessdate=10 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was the capital of the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]] from 572 to 774.

Pavia is the capital of the fertile [[province of Pavia]], which is known for a variety of agricultural products, including wine, rice, cereals, and dairy products. Although there are a number of industries located in the suburbs, these tend not to disturb the peaceful atmosphere of the town. It is home to the ancient [[University of Pavia]] (founded in 1361), which together with the [[IUSS Pavia|IUSS]] (Institute for Advanced Studies of Pavia), [[Ghislieri College]], [[Borromeo College]], Nuovo College, Santa Caterina College, and the {{lang|it|Istituto per il Diritto allo Studio|italic=no}} (EDiSU), belongs to the Pavia Study System. Pavia is the [[episcopal see|episcopal seat]] of the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Bishop of Pavia]]. The city possesses many artistic and cultural treasures, including several important [[Church (building)|churches]] and [[museums]], such as the well-known [[Certosa di Pavia]].

The Central Hospital of Pavia is one of the most important hospitals in Italy.

[[File:Josse Lieferinxe - Saint Sebastian Interceding for the Plague Stricken - Walters 371995.jpg|left|thumb|This painting by [[Josse Lieferinxe]] depicts an outbreak of the plague in 7th-century Pavia (then under the [[Lombard Kingdom]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]

 |title= Saint Sebastian Interceding for the Plague Stricken}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Walters Art Museum.]]Dating back to pre-Roman times, the town of Pavia was said, by [[Pliny the Elder]], to have been founded by the [[Laevi]] and [[Marici (Ligures)|Marici]], two [[Ligures|Ligurian]] tribes, while [[Ptolemy]] attributes it to the [[Insubres]]. The Roman city, known as [[Ticinum]], was a municipality and an important military site (a [[castrum]]) under the [[Roman Empire]]. It most likely began as a small military camp, built by the [[consul]] [[Publius Cornelius Scipio]] in 218 BC to guard a wooden bridge he had built over the [[river]] Ticinum, on his way to search for [[Hannibal]], who was rumoured to have managed to lead an army over the [[Alps]] and into [[Italy]]. The forces of Rome and [[Carthage]] ran into each other soon thereafter, and the Romans suffered the first of many crushing defeats at the hands of Hannibal, with the consul himself almost losing his life. The bridge was destroyed, but the fortified camp, which at the time was the most forward Roman military outpost in the [[Po Valley]], somehow survived the long [[Second Punic War]], and gradually evolved into a garrison town.

Its importance grew with the extension of the [[Via Aemilia]] from [[Ariminum]] (Rimini) to the [[Po River]] (187 BC), which it crossed at Placentia ([[Piacenza]]) and there forked, one branch going to [[Mediolanum]] ([[Milan]]) and the other to Ticinum, and thence to [[Laumellum]] where it divided once more, one branch going to [[Vercellae]] - and thence to [[Eporedia]] and [[Augusta Praetoria]] - and the other to Valentia - and thence to [[Augusta Taurinorum]] ([[Turin]]).

It was at Pavia in 476 AD that the reign of [[Romulus Augustulus]] (r. 475-476), the last emperor of the [[Western Roman Empire]] ended and Roman rule ceased in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=E. A.|title=Romans and Barbarians The Decline of the Western Empire|url=https://archive.org/details/romansbarbarians00thom|url-access=registration|year=1982|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, Wisconsin|pages=[https://archive.org/details/romansbarbarians00thom/page/61 61–63]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romulus Augustulus, while considered the last emperor of the Western Roman Empire, was actually a usurper of the imperial [[throne]]; his father [[Flavius Orestes]] dethroned the previous emperor, [[Julius Nepos]], and raised the young Romulus Augustulus to the imperial throne at [[Ravenna]] in 475.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|title=Romans and Barbarians|pages=61–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though being the emperor, Romulus Augustulus was simply the mouthpiece for his father Orestes, who was the person who actually exercised power and governed Italy during Romulus Augustulus's short reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|title=Romans and Barbarians|pages=61–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten months after Romulus Augustulus's reign began, Orestes's soldiers under the command of one of his officers named [[Odoacer]], rebelled and killed Orestes in the city of Pavia in 476.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|title=Romans and Barbarians|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rioting that took place as part of Odoacer's uprising against Orestes sparked fires that burnt much of Pavia to the point that Odoacer, as the new king of Italy, had to suspend the [[taxes]] for the city for five years so that it could finance its recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|title=Romans and Barbarians|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without his father, Romulus Augustulus was powerless. Instead of killing Romulus Augustulus, Odoacer pensioned him off at 6,000 solidi a year before declaring the end of the Western Roman Empire and himself king of the new Kingdom of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|title=Romans and Barbarians|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Odoacer's reign as king of Italy did not last long, because in 488 the [[Ostrogothic]] peoples led by their [[king]] [[Theoderic]] invaded Italy and waged war against Odoacer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moorhead|first=John|title=Theoderic in Italy|year=1992|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; After fighting for 5 years, Theoderic defeated Odoacer and on March 15, 493, assassinated Odoacer at a banquet meant to negotiate a peace between the two rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moorhead|title=Theoderic|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the establishment of the Ostrogoth kingdom based in northern Italy, Theoderic began his vast program of public building. Pavia was among several cities that Theodoric chose to restore and expand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moorhead|title=Theoderic|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began the construction of the vast palace complex that would eventually become the residence of Lombard monarchs several decades later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wickham|first=Chris|title=Early Medieval Italy Central Power and Local Society 400-100|year=1981|publisher=Macmillan Press Ltd.|location=London|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoderic also commissioned the building of the Roman-styled [[amphitheatre]] and bath complex in Pavia;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moorhead|title=Theoderic|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 7th century these would be among the few still functioning bath complexes in [[Europe]] outside of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wickham|title=Early Medieval Italy|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of Theoderic's reign the Christian [[philosopher]] [[Boethius]] was imprisoned in one of Pavia's churches from 522 to 525 before his execution for treason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moorhead|title=Theoderic|pages=219–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during Boethius's captivity in Pavia that he wrote his seminal work the ''Consolation of Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moorhead|title=Theoderic|pages=223–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pavia played an important role in the war between the Eastern Roman Empire and the Ostrogoths that began in 535.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|title=Romans and Barbarians|pages=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Eastern Roman general Belisarius's victory over the Ostrogothic leader Wittigis in 540 and the loss of most of the Ostrogoth lands in Italy, Pavia was among the last centres of Ostrogothic resistance that continued the war and opposed Eastern Roman rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|title=Romans and Barbarians|pages=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the capitulation of the Ostrogothic leadership in 540 more than a thousand men remained garrisoned in Pavia and Verona dedicated to opposing Eastern Roman rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|title=Romans and Barbarians|pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resilience of Ostrogoth strongholds like Pavia against invading forces allowed pockets of Ostrogothic rule to limp along until finally being defeated in 561.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wickham|title=Early Medieval Italy|pages=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pavia and the peninsula of Italy didn't remain long under the rule of the Eastern Roman Empire, for in 568, a new people invaded Italy. This new invading people in 568 were the [[Lombards]] (otherwise called the Longobards).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christie|first=Neil|title=The Lombards The Ancient Longobards|year=1995|publisher=Basil Blackwell Inc.|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=xxii}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their invasion of Italy in 568, the Lombards were led by their king Alboin (r. 560-572), who would become the first Lombard king of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christie|title=The Lombards|pages=xxv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alboin captured much of northern Italy in 568 but his progress was halted in 569 by the fortified city of Pavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christie|title=The Lombards|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul the Deacon's History of the Lombards written more than a hundred years after the Siege of Ticinum provides one of the few records of this period: “The city of Ticinum (Pavia) at this time held out bravely, withstanding a siege more than three years, while the army of the Langobards remained close at hand on the western side. Meanwhile Alboin, after driving out the soldiers, took possession of everything as far as Tuscany except Rome and Ravenna and some other fortified places which were situated on the shore of the sea.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paul the Deacon|title=History of the Lombards|year=2003|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia|pages=80|author2=William Dudley Foulke|editor=Edward Peters}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Siege of Ticinum finally ended with the Lombards capturing the city of Pavia in 572.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hodgkin|first=Thomas|title=Italy and Her Invaders 553 Volume V The Lombard Invasion|year=1895|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=162–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pavia's strategic location and the Ostrogoth palaces located within it would make Pavia by the 620s the main capital of the Lombards’ Kingdom of Pavia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnaldi|first=Girolamo|title=Italy and Its Invaders|year=2005|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the main residence for the Lombard rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christie|title=The Lombards|pages=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lombard capital===
Under Lombard rule many monasteries, nunneries, and churches were built at Pavia by the devout Christian Lombard monarchs. Even though the first Lombard kings were Arian Christians, sources from the period such as Paul the Deacon have recorded that the Arian Lombards were very tolerant of their Catholic subjects’ faith and that up to the 690s Arian and Catholic cathedrals coexisted in Pavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christie|title=The Lombards|pages=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lombard kings, queens, and nobles would engage in building churches, monasteries, and nunneries as a method to demonstrate their piety and their wealth by extravagantly decorating these structures which in many cases would become the site of that person's tomb, as in the case of Grimoald (r. 662-671) who built San Ambrogio in Pavia and buried there after his death in 671.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christie|title=The Lombards|pages=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perctarit (r. 661-662, 672-688) and his son Cunicpert (r.679-700) built a nunnery and a church at Pavia during their reigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christie|title=The Lombards|pages=xxv, 101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lombard churches were sometimes named after those who commissioned their construction, such as San Maria Theodota in Pavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wickham|title=Early Medieval Italy|pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monastery of San Michele alla Pusterla located at Pavia was the royal monastery of the Lombard kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christie|title=The Lombards|pages=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous churches built by a Lombard king in Pavia is the church [[San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro]]. This famous church was commissioned by king [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand]] (r. 712-744)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christie|title=The Lombards|pages=xxv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it would become the site of his tomb as well as two other famous Christian figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dale|first=Sharon|title=A house divided: San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro in Pavia and the politics of Pope John XXII|journal=Journal of Medieval History|year=2001|volume=27|issue=1|pages=55–77|doi=10.1016/S0304-4181(00)00016-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In building San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro the unit of measurement used by the builders was the length of Liutprand's royal foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Leader|title=The Cathedral Builders The Story of a Great Masonic Guild|url=https://archive.org/details/cathedralbuilde00scotgoog|year=1899|publisher=S.

As the kingdom's capital, Pavia in the late 7th century also became one of the central locations of the Lombards' efforts to mint their own coinage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christie|title=The Lombards|pages=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bust of the Lombard king would have been etched on the coins as a symbolic gesture so that those who used the coins, mostly Lombard nobles, would understand that king had the ultimate power and control of wealth in the Kingdom of Pavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christie|title=The Lombards|pages=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Pavia played a key role in the war between the Lombard Kingdom of Pavia and the Franks led by Charlemagne. In 773, Charlemagne king of the Franks declared war and invaded across the Alps into northern Italy defeating the Lombard army commanded by king Desiderius (r. 757-774).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wickham|title=Early Medieval Italy|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the autumn of 773 and June of 774&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wickham|title=Early Medieval Italy|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charlemagne laid siege to Pavia first and then Verona, capturing the seat of Lombard power and quickly crushing any resistance from the northern Lombard fortified cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christie|title=The Lombards|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Pavia had been the official capital of the Lombards since the 620s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wickham|title=Early Medieval Italy|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was also the place upon where the Lombard Kingdom in Italy ended. Upon entering Pavia in triumph, Charlemagne crowned himself king of the lands of the former Kingdom of Pavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wickham|title=Early Medieval Italy|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lombard kingdom and its northern territories from then onwards were a sub-kingdom of the Frankish Empire, while the Lombard southern [[duchy of Benevento]] persisted for several centuries longer with relative independence and autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wickham|title=Early Medieval Italy|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval history===
[[File:County of Pavia Visconti CoA.svg|right|thumb|Coat of Arms of the county of Pavia under the Visconti Dynasty]]In 924, the Hungarians, led by the deposed Lombard king, [[Berengar I of Italy|Berengar I]], sacked and destroyed the city. Pavia remained the capital of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italian Kingdom]] and the centre of royal coronations until the diminution of imperial authority there in the 12th century. In 1004, [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Henry II]] bloodily suppressed a revolt of the citizens of Pavia, who disputed his recent coronation as [[King of Italy]].

In the 12th century, Pavia acquired the status of a self-governing [[Medieval commune|commune]]. In the political division between [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]] that characterized the Italian Middle Ages, Pavia was traditionally Ghibelline, a position that was as much supported by the rivalry with [[Milan]] as it was a mark of the defiance of the Emperor that led the [[Lombard League]] against the emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]], who was attempting to reassert long-dormant Imperial influence over Italy. The city also had a reputation as a place to have a &quot;good time,&quot; as witness the [[Archpoet]]'s famous comments of 1163.&lt;ref&gt;Quis in igne positus, igne non uratur? Quis Papiae demorans, castus habeatur? Ubi Venus digito juvenes venatur, oculis illaqueat, facie praedatur? Si ponas Hippolytum hodie Papiae, non erit Hippolytus in sequenti die. Veneris in thalamos &quot;ducunt omnes viae.&quot; Non est in tot turribus turris Alethiae.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following centuries Pavia was an important and active town.
Under the [[Treaty of Pavia (1329)|Treaty of Pavia]], Emperor [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] granted during his stay in Italy the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] to his brother Duke [[Rudolf I, Duke of Bavaria|Rudolph's]] descendants. Pavia held out against the domination of [[Milan]], finally yielding to the [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]] family, rulers of that city in 1359; under the Visconti Pavia became an intellectual and artistic centre, being the seat from 1361 of the [[University of Pavia]] founded around the nucleus of the old school of law, which attracted students from many countries.

=== Early modern ===

The [[Battle of Pavia]] (1525) marked a watershed in the city's fortunes, since by that time, the former schism between the supporters of the Pope and those of the Holy Roman Emperor had shifted to one between a French party (allied with the Pope) and a party supporting the Emperor and King of Spain [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. Thus during the [[House of Valois|Valois]]-[[Habsburg]] [[Italian Wars]], Pavia was naturally on the Imperial (and Spanish) side. The defeat and capture of king [[Francis I of France|Francis&amp;nbsp;I]] of [[Kingdom of France|France]] during the battle ushered in a period of [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish]] occupation which lasted until 1713 at the conclusion of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. Pavia was then ruled by the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]]ns until 1796, when it was occupied by the French army under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]. During this Austrian period the University was greatly supported by [[Maria Theresa]] of Austria and oversaw a culturally rich period due to the presence of leading scientists and humanists like [[Ugo Foscolo]], [[Alessandro Volta]], [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]], and [[Camillo Golgi]] among others.

In 1815, it again came under Austrian administration until the [[Second War of Italian Independence]] (1859) and the [[unification of Italy]] one year later.

== Main sights ==

Pavia's most famous landmark is the ''[[Certosa di Pavia|Certosa]]'', or [[Carthusian]] monastery, founded in 1396 and located eight kilometres ({{convert|8|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) north of the city.

Among other notable structures are:
* [[Pavia Cathedral|Cathedral of Pavia]] (''[[Duomo]] di Pavia''): Construction of the cathedral began in 1488; however, only by 1898 were the façade and the dome completed according to the original design. The central dome has an octagonal plan, stands 97 m high, and weighs some 20,000 tons. This dome is the third for size in Italy, after [[St. Peter's Basilica]] and [[Santa Maria del Fiore]] in Florence. Next to the Duomo were the [[Torre Civica (Pavia)|Civic Tower]] (existing at least from 1330 and enlarged in 1583 by [[Pellegrino Tibaldi]]): its fall on March 17, 1989, was the final motivating force that started the last decade's efforts to save the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] from a similar fate.
* ''[[San Michele Maggiore]]'' (St. Michael Major): This church is an outstanding example of Lombard-Romanesque church architecture in Lombardy. It is located on the site of a pre-existing [[Lombards|Lombard]] church, which the lower part of the [[campanile]] belongs to. Destroyed in 1004, it was rebuilt from around the end of the 11th century (including crypt, transept and choir), and finished in 1155. It is characterized by an extensive use of [[sandstone]] and by a very long transept, provided with a façade and an apse of its own. In the church the Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]] was crowned in 1155.
* ''[[Basilica of San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro]]'' (&quot;St. Peter in Golden Sky&quot;): In this church, St [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]] and the [[Lombards|Lombard]] king [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand]] are said to be buried. Construction was begun in the 6th century. The current construction was built in 1132. It is similar to San Michele Maggiore, but different in the asymmetric façade with a single portal, the use of [[brickwork]] instead of [[sandstone]], and, in the interior, the absence of matronei, galleries reserved for women and the shortest [[transept]]. The noteworthy arch housing the relics of St. Augustine was built in 1362 by artists from [[Campione d'Italia|Campione]], and is decorated by some 150 statues and reliefs. The church is mentioned by [[Dante Alighieri]] in the X canto of his ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.
* ''San Francesco d'Assisi'': This is a late [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church (1238–98) with a restored [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] façade, located on Corso Cairoli.
* ''[[San Teodoro, Pavia|San Teodoro]]'': This church dating to 1117 and dedicated to [[Theodore of Pavia]], a medieval bishop of the [[Diocese of Pavia]], is the third. albeit smaller, Romanesque basilica in Pavia. Situated on the slopes leading down to the [[Ticino river]], it served the fishermen. The apses and the three-level tiburium exemplify effective simplicity of Romanesque decoration. Inside are two outstanding bird's-eye-view frescoes of the city (1525) attributed to [[Bernardino Lanzani]]. The latter, the definitive release, was stripped off disclosing the unfinished first one. Both are impressively detailed and reveal how Pavia's urban layout has changed little in 500 years.
*''[[Visconti Castle (Pavia)|Castello Visconteo]]'': Built in 1360-1365 by [[Galeazzo II Visconti]], this large castle served as a private residence rather than a stronghold. The poet [[Francesco Petrarca]] spent some time there, when [[Gian Galeazzo Visconti]] called him to take charge of the magnificent library which owned about a thousand books and manuscripts, subsequently lost. The Castle is now home to the City Museums ([[Musei Civici]]) and the park is a popular attraction for children. An unconfirmed legend wants the Castle to be connected by a secret tunnel to the ''[[Certosa di Pavia|Certosa]]''.
*''[[Santa Maria del Carmine, Pavia|Santa Maria del Carmine]]'': This church is a well-preserved example of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] brickwork architecture in northern Italy. Built on the Latin cross plan, it is the second largest Pavian church after the Duomo, with a perimeter of 80 x 40 meters comprising a nave and two aisles. The characteristic façade has a large [[rose window]] and seven cusps.
* ''[[Santa Maria di Canepanova]]'': This renaissance octagonal church is attributed to [[Bramante]].
* The [[medieval towers]] still shape the town skyline. The main clusters still rising are rallied in Piazza Leonardo da Vinci (three towers), Via Luigi Porta (two towers), and in Piazza of Collegio Borromeo. These towers are closed to the public.

== Universities, colleges and other institutions ==
Pavia is a major Italian college town, with several institutes, universities and academies, including the ancient [[University of Pavia]]. Here is an incomplete list of the main institutions located in the city:

* The [[University of Pavia]], one of the most ancient universities in Europe, was founded in 1361, although a school of rhetoric is documented in 825 making this center perhaps the oldest proto-university of Europe. The ''Centrale'' Building is a wide block made up of twelve courts of the 15th to 19th centuries. The sober façade shifts from baroque style to neoclassic. The ''Big Staircase'', the ''Aula Foscolo'', the ''Aula Volta'', the ''Aula Scarpa'' and the ''Aula Magna'' are neoclassic too. The ''Cortile degli Spiriti Magni'' hosts the statues of some of the most important scholars and alumni. Ancient burial monuments and gravestones of scholars of the 14th to 16th centuries are walled up in the ''Cortile Voltiano'' (most come from demolished churches). The ''Cortile delle Magnolie'' holds an ancient pit. The ''Cortile di Ludovico il Moro'' has a renaissance loggia and terracotta decorations. Both courts, as well as two more, were the cloisters of the ancient Ospedale di San Matteo. The [[Orto Botanico dell'Università di Pavia]] is the university's [[botanical garden]]. There is also the [[University History Museum, University of Pavia|University History Museum]] and the [[Natural History Museum (Pavia)|Natural History Museum of Pavia]].
*[[Borromeo College]] (Ital. ''Almo Collegio Borromeo''), founded in 1561 by [[Carlo Borromeo]], is the oldest college at the University of Pavia in northern Italy.
*[[Ghislieri College]] (Ital. ''Collegio Ghislieri''), founded in 1567 by [[Pope Pius V]], is the second ancient college in Pavia, with the other first being [[Almo Collegio Borromeo]], and one of the most ancient [[colleges]] in Italy and co-founder of the [[IUSS Pavia|IUSS]], located in Pavia as well. Collegio Ghislieri is a 450-year-old Italian institution committed to promote University studies on the basis of merit, hosting around 200 pupils (males and females) who attend all faculties in [[University of Pavia|Pavia State University]], offering them logistic and cultural opportunities such as scholarships, lectures, conferences, a 100,000-volume library (third among private libraries in Northern Italy), and foreign languages courses. Each year about 30 new students coming from all over the country are selected by a public contest. Founded by Pope Pius V (Antonio Ghislieri) in 1567, since 18th century laically managed, nowadays under the High Patronage of the Presidency of the Italian Republic, it is ranked among high qualifying institutions by the Italian Ministry for Education and University.
*The [[IUSS Pavia]] or the &quot;Istituto Universitario di Studi Superiori&quot; of Pavia (Eng. ''IUSS School for Advanced Studies'') is a higher learning institute located in Pavia, Italy. It was founded in 1997 by the [[University of Pavia]], [[Borromeo College]] and [[Ghislieri College]], supported by the Italian Minister of Education. It is shaped according to the [[Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa]] model and reunites all the five colleges of Pavia, forming the [[Pavia Study System]].

==Transport==
[[Pavia railway station]], opened in 1862, forms part of the [[Milan–Genoa railway]], and is also a terminus of four secondary railways, linking Pavia with [[Pavia–Alessandria railway|Alessandria]], [[Pavia–Mantua railway|Mantua]], [[Vercelli–Pavia railway|Vercelli]] and [[Pavia–Stradella railway|Stradella]].

Pavia is also connected to [[Milan]] through the S13 line of the [[Milan suburban railway service]] with trains every 30 minutes. [[Pavia porta Garibaldi railway station|Pavia P. Garibaldi]] is a small railway station on the [[Pavia–Mantua railway]].

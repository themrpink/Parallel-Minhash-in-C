In his short story &quot;By The Turtles of Tasman&quot;, a character, defending her &quot;ne'er-do-well grasshopperish father&quot; to her &quot;antlike uncle&quot;, says: &quot;... my father has been a king. He has lived .... Have you lived merely to live? Are you afraid to die? I'd rather sing one wild song and burst my heart with it, than live a thousand years watching my digestion and being afraid of the wet. When you are dust, my father will be ashes.&quot;

==== &quot;The Scab&quot; ====
A short diatribe on &quot;The [[Strikebreaker|Scab]]&quot; is often quoted within the U.S. labor movement and frequently attributed to London. It opens:

{{quote|
After God had finished the rattlesnake, the toad, and the vampire, he had some awful substance left with which he made a scab. A scab is a two-legged animal with a corkscrew soul, a water brain, a combination backbone of jelly and glue. Where others have hearts, he carries a tumor of rotten principles. When a scab comes down the street, men turn their backs and Angels weep in Heaven, and the Devil shuts the gates of hell to keep him out....&lt;ref name=thescab&gt;{{cite web |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=418&amp;invol=264 |title=Letter Carriers v. Austin, 418 U.S. 264 (1974) |accessdate=23 May 2006 |date=25 June 1974 |author=Thurgood Marshall}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In 1913 and 1914, a number of newspapers printed the first three sentences with varying terms used instead of &quot;scab&quot;, such as
&quot;knocker&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Callan, Claude, 1913, &quot;Cracks at the Crowd&quot;, ''Fort Worth Star-Telegram'', December 30, 1913, p. 6: &quot;Saith the Rule Review: 'After God had finished making the rattlesnake, the toad and the vampire, He had some awful substance left, with which he made the knocker.' Were it not for being irreverent, we would suggest that He was hard up for something to do when He made any of those pests you call his handiwork.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Food for Your Think Tank&quot;, ''The Macon Daily Telegraph'', August 23, 1914, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;stool pigeon&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot; Madame Gain is Found Guilty. Jury Decides Woman Conducted House of Ill Fame at the Clifton Hotel,&quot; ''The Duluth News Tribune'', February 5, 1914, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
or &quot;scandal monger&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;T. W. H.&quot;, (1914), &quot;Review of the Masonic 'Country' Press: The Eastern Star&quot; ''The New Age Magazine: A Monthly Publication Devoted to Freemasonry and Its Relation to Present Day Problems,'' published by the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry for the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States; June 1917, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GMVNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA283&amp;as_brr=1 p. 283]:&quot;SCANDAL MONGER: After God had finished making the rattlesnake, the toad and the vampire, He had some awful substance left, with which He made a scandal monger. A scandal monger is a two-legged animal with a cork-screw soul, a water-sogged brain and a combination backbone made of jelly and glue. Where other men have their hearts he carries a tumor of decayed principles. When the scandal monger comes down the street honest men turn their backs, the angels weep tears in heaven, and the devil shuts the gates of hell to keep him out. —Anon&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

This passage as given above was the subject of a 1974 Supreme Court case, ''[[Letter Carriers v. Austin]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Letter Carriers v. Austin|link=|volume=418|page=264|pin=|year=1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in which Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]] referred to it as &quot;a well-known piece of trade union literature, generally attributed to author Jack London&quot;. A union newsletter had published a &quot;list of scabs,&quot; which was granted to be factual and therefore not libelous, but then went on to quote the passage as the &quot;definition of a scab&quot;. The case turned on the question of whether the &quot;definition&quot; was defamatory. The court ruled that &quot;Jack London's... 'definition of a scab' is merely rhetorical hyperbole, a lusty and imaginative expression of the contempt felt by union members towards those who refuse to join&quot;, and as such was not libelous and was protected under the First Amendment.&lt;ref name=&quot;thescab&quot; /&gt;

Despite being frequently attributed to London, the passage does not appear at all in the extensive collection of his writings at [[Sonoma State University]]'s website. However, in his book ''War of the Classes'' he published a 1903 speech entitled &quot;The Scab&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://london.sonoma.edu/Writings/WarOfTheClasses/scab.html |title=War of the Classes: The Scab |website=london.sonoma.edu |access-date=April 14, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807072644/http://london.sonoma.edu/Writings/WarOfTheClasses/scab.html |archive-date=August 7, 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; which gave a much more balanced view of the topic:

{{quote|The laborer who gives more time or strength or skill for the same wage than another, or equal time or strength or skill for a less wage, is a scab. The generousness on his part is hurtful to his fellow-laborers, for it compels them to an equal generousness which is not to their liking, and which gives them less of food and shelter. But a word may be said for the scab. Just as his act makes his rivals compulsorily generous, so do they, by fortune of birth and training, make compulsory his act of generousness.

[...]

Nobody desires to scab, to give most for least. The ambition of every individual is quite the opposite, to give least for most; and, as a result, living in a tooth-and-nail society, battle royal is waged by the ambitious individuals. But in its most salient aspect, that of the struggle over the division of the joint product, it is no longer a battle between individuals, but between groups of individuals. Capital and labor apply themselves to raw material, make something useful out of it, add to its value, and then proceed to quarrel over the division of the added value. Neither cares to give most for least. Each is intent on giving less than the other and on receiving more.

{{Electromagnetism |Network}}

'''Alternating current''' ('''AC''') is an [[electric current]] which periodically reverses direction and changes its magnitude continuously with time in contrast to [[direct current]] (DC) which flows only in one direction. Alternating current is the form in which [[electric power]] is delivered to businesses and residences, and it is the form of [[electrical energy]] that consumers typically use when they plug [[kitchen appliance]]s, televisions, fans and electric lamps into a [[wall socket]]. A common source of DC power is a [[battery (electricity)|battery cell]] in a [[flashlight]]. The abbreviations ''AC'' and ''DC'' are often used to mean simply ''alternating'' and ''direct'', as when they modify ''[[Electric current|current]]'' or ''[[voltage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The usual [[waveform]] of alternating current in most electric power circuits is a [[sine wave]], whose positive half-period corresponds with positive direction of the current and vice versa. In certain applications, like [[guitar amplifier]]s, different waveforms are used, such as [[Triangle wave|triangular waves]] or [[square wave]]s. [[Audio frequency|Audio]] and [[radio frequency|radio]] signals carried on electrical wires are also examples of alternating current. These types of alternating current carry information such as sound (audio) or images (video) sometimes carried by [[modulation]] of an AC carrier signal. These currents typically alternate at higher frequencies than those used in power transmission.

== Transmission, distribution, and domestic power supply ==

{{Main|Electric power transmission|Electric power distribution}}
[[File:Electric Transmission.png|thumb|265px|A schematic representation of long distance electric power transmission. From left to right: G=generator, U=step up transformer, V=voltage at beginning of transmission line, Pt=power entering transmission line, I=current in wires, R=total resistance in wires, Pw=power lost in transmission line, Pe=power reaching the of the transmission line,    D=step down transformer , C=consumers.]]

Electrical energy is distributed as alternating current because AC [[voltage]] may be increased or decreased with a [[transformer]]. This allows the power to be transmitted through [[power line]]s efficiently at high voltage, which reduces the energy lost as heat due to [[electrical resistance|resistance]] of the wire, and transformed to a lower, safer, voltage for use. Use of a higher voltage leads to significantly more efficient transmission of power. The power losses (&lt;math&gt;P_{\rm w}&lt;/math&gt;) in the wire are a product of the square of the current ( I ) and the [[electrical resistance|resistance]] (R) of the wire, described by the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{\rm w} = I^2 R \, .&lt;/math&gt;

This means that when transmitting a fixed power on a given wire, if the current is halved (i.e. the voltage is doubled), the power loss due to the wire's resistance will be reduced to one quarter.

The power transmitted is equal to the product of the current and the voltage (assuming no phase difference); that is,
:&lt;math&gt;P_{\rm t} = IV \, .&lt;/math&gt;
Consequently, power transmitted at a higher voltage requires less loss-producing current than for the same power at a lower voltage. Power is often transmitted at hundreds of kilovolts on pylons, and transformed down to tens of kilovolts to be transmitted on lower level lines, and finally transformed down to 100&amp;nbsp;V – 240&amp;nbsp;V for domestic use.

[[File:Highvoltagetransmissionlines.jpg|thumb|right|265px|Three-phase high voltage transmission lines use alternating currents to distribute power over long distances between [[electric generation]] plants and consumers. The lines in the picture are located in eastern [[Utah]].]]

High voltages have disadvantages, such as the increased insulation required, and generally increased difficulty in their safe handling. In a [[power plant]], energy is generated at a convenient voltage for the design of a [[Electric generator|generator]], and then stepped up to a high voltage for transmission. Near the loads, the transmission voltage is stepped down to the voltages used by equipment. Consumer voltages vary somewhat depending on the country and size of load, but generally motors and lighting are built to use up to a few hundred volts between phases. The voltage delivered to equipment such as lighting and motor loads is standardized, with an allowable range of voltage over which equipment is expected to operate. Standard power utilization voltages and percentage tolerance vary in the different [[mains power systems]] found in the world. [[High-voltage direct current|High-voltage direct-current]] (HVDC) electric power transmission systems have become more viable as technology has provided efficient means of changing the voltage of DC power. Transmission with high voltage direct current was not feasible in the early days of [[electric power transmission]], as there was then no economically viable way to step down the voltage of DC for end user applications such as lighting incandescent bulbs.

[[Three-phase electric power|Three-phase]] electrical generation is very common. The simplest way is to use three separate coils in the generator [[stator]], physically offset by an angle of 120° (one-third of a complete 360° phase) to each other. Three current waveforms are produced that are equal in magnitude and 120° [[out of phase]] to each other. If coils are added opposite to these (60° spacing), they generate the same phases with reverse polarity and so can be simply wired together. In practice, higher &quot;pole orders&quot; are commonly used. For example, a 12-pole machine would have 36 coils (10° spacing). The advantage is that lower rotational speeds can be used to generate the same frequency. For example, a 2-pole machine running at 3600&amp;nbsp;rpm and a 12-pole machine running at 600&amp;nbsp;rpm produce the same frequency; the lower speed is preferable for larger machines. If the load on a three-phase system is balanced equally among the phases, no current flows through the [[neutral point]]. Even in the worst-case unbalanced (linear) load, the neutral current will not exceed the highest of the phase currents. Non-linear loads (e.g. the switch-mode power supplies widely used) may require an oversized neutral bus and neutral conductor in the upstream distribution panel to handle [[Harmonic (electrical power)|harmonics]]. Harmonics can cause neutral conductor current levels to exceed that of one or all phase conductors.

For three-phase at utilization voltages a four-wire system is often used. When stepping down three-phase, a transformer with a Delta (3-wire) primary and a Star (4-wire, center-earthed) secondary is often used so there is no need for a neutral on the supply side. For smaller customers (just how small varies by country and age of the installation) only a [[single-phase electric power|single phase]] and neutral, or two phases and neutral, are taken to the property. For larger installations all three phases and neutral are taken to the main distribution panel. From the three-phase main panel, both single and three-phase circuits may lead off. [[Split-phase electric power|Three-wire single-phase]] systems, with a single center-tapped transformer giving two live conductors, is a common distribution scheme for residential and small commercial buildings in North America. This arrangement is sometimes incorrectly referred to as &quot;two phase&quot;. A similar method is used for a different reason on construction sites in the UK. Small power tools and lighting are supposed to be supplied by a local center-tapped transformer with a voltage of 55&amp;nbsp;V between each power conductor and earth. This significantly reduces the risk of [[electric shock]] in the event that one of the live conductors becomes exposed through an equipment fault whilst still allowing a reasonable voltage of 110&amp;nbsp;V between the two conductors for running the tools.

A [[Ground and neutral|third wire]], called the bond (or earth) wire, is often connected between non-current-carrying metal enclosures and earth ground. This conductor provides protection from electric shock due to accidental contact of circuit conductors with the metal chassis of portable appliances and tools. Bonding all non-current-carrying metal parts into one complete system ensures there is always a low [[electrical impedance]] path to ground sufficient to carry any [[Fault (power engineering)|fault]] current for as long as it takes for the system to clear the fault. This low impedance path allows the maximum amount of fault current, causing the overcurrent protection device (breakers, fuses) to trip or burn out as quickly as possible, bringing the electrical system to a safe state. All bond wires are bonded to ground at the main service panel, as is the neutral/identified conductor if present.

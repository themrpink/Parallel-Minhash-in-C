Of other early sources, the life of Oswald of Worcester, attributed to [[Byrhtferth]] of Ramsey, adds that Edward was killed by Æthelred's advisers, who attacked him when he was dismounting. It agrees that he was buried without ceremony at Wareham.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Æthelred the Unready'', pp. 11–12; Hart, &quot;Edward&quot;, pp. 784–785; Miller, &quot;Edward the Martyr&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Archbishop [[Wulfstan II]] alludes to the killing of Edward in his ''[[Sermo Lupi ad Anglos]],'' written not later than 1016. A recent study translates his words as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;And a very great betrayal of a lord it is also in the world, that a man betray his lord to death, or drive him living from the land, and both have come to pass in this land: Edward was betrayed, and then killed, and after that burned ...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Bernstein Ser's translation in her [http://english3.fsu.edu/~wulfstan/ Electronic ''Sermo Lupi ad Anglos''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081107044657/http://english3.fsu.edu/~wulfstan/ |date=November 7, 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:death of edward martyr.jpg|thumb|right|Ælfthryth looks on as Edward is stabbed to death: from a Victorian edition of [[John Foxe|Foxe's]] ''[[Book of Martyrs]]'']]

Later sources, further removed from events, such as the late 11th-century ''Passio S. Eadwardi'' and [[John of Worcester]], claim that Ælfthryth organised the killing of Edward, while [[Henry of Huntingdon]] wrote that she killed Edward herself.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Æthelred the Unready'', pp. 12–13; Miller, &quot;Edward the Martyr&quot;; Dales, ''Dunstan'', p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern historians have offered a variety of interpretations of Edward's killing. Three main theories have been proposed. Firstly, that Edward was killed, as the life of Oswald claims, by nobles in Æthelred's service, either as a result of a personal quarrel, or to place their master on the throne.&lt;ref&gt;So, for example, Williams, ''Æthelred the Unready'', p. 12; Dales, ''Dunstan'', p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; The life of Oswald portrays Edward as an unstable young man who, according to [[Frank Stenton]]: &quot;had offended many important persons by his intolerable violence of speech and behaviour. Long after he had passed into veneration as a saint it was remembered that his outbursts of rage had alarmed all who knew him, and especially the members of his own household.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stenton&quot;&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 372&lt;/ref&gt;  This may be a [[Trope (literature)|trope]] of [[hagiography]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Æthelred the Unready'', pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second version, Ælfthryth was implicated, either beforehand by plotting the killing, or afterwards in allowing the killers to go free and unpunished.&lt;ref&gt;Thus Hart, &quot;Edward&quot;, p. 785; Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third alternative, noting that Edward in 978 was very close to ruling on his own, proposes that Ealdorman Ælfhere was behind the killing so as to preserve his own influence and to prevent Edward taking revenge for Ælfhere's actions earlier in the reign.&lt;ref&gt;For this, see Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; John notes this and interprets Ælfhere's part in Edward's reburial as being a penance for the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;John, ''Reassessing Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 119–121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reburial and early cult==
[[Image:Shaftesbury Abbey.jpg|thumb|left|The Great Seal of [[Shaftesbury Abbey]], where Edward's relics lay until the [[English Reformation]]]]

Edward's body lay at Wareham for a year before being disinterred. Ælfhere initiated the reinterment, perhaps as a gesture of reconciliation. According to the life of Oswald, Edward's body was found to be [[incorrupt]] when it was disinterred (which was taken as a miraculous sign). The body was taken to the [[Shaftesbury Abbey]], a nunnery with royal connections which had been endowed by King [[Alfred the Great]] and where Edward and Æthelred's grandmother [[Ælfgifu of Shaftesbury|Ælfgifu]] had spent her latter years.

Edward's remains were reburied with lavish public ceremony. Later versions, such as the ''Passio S. Eadwardi,'' have more complicated accounts.  It said that Edward's body was concealed in a marsh, where it was revealed by miraculous events. The ''Passio'' dates the reburial to 18 February.&lt;ref&gt;Stafford, ''Unification and Conquest'', p. 59; Ridyard, ''Royal Saints'', pp. 155–156; Hart, &quot;Edward&quot;, p. 785; Williams, ''Æthelred the Unready'', p. 16; Miller, &quot;Edward the Martyr&quot;. It is possible that the ''Passio S. Eadwardi'' is based in part on an earlier life compiled at Shaftesbury.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1001, Edward's relics (for he was considered a saint, although never canonized) were [[translation (relics)|translated]] to a more prominent place within the nunnery at Shaftesbury. The ceremonies are said to have been led by the then-[[Bishop of Sherborne (historic)|Bishop of Sherborne]], [[Wulfsige III]], accompanied by a senior cleric whom the ''Passio'' calls Elsinus, sometimes identified with Ælfsige, the abbot of the [[New Minster, Winchester]]. King Æthelred, preoccupied with the threat of a Danish invasion, did not attend in person, but he issued a charter to the Shaftesbury nuns late in 1001 granting them lands at [[Bradford on Avon]], which is thought to be related. A 13th-century [[calendar of saints]] gives the date of this translation as 20 June.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Æthelred the Unready'', pp. 15–16; Ridyard, ''Royal Saints'', pp. 156–157. Æthelred's charter is [http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&amp;type=charter&amp;id=899 S 899].&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of Edward's cult has been interpreted in various ways. It is sometimes portrayed as a popular movement, or as the product of a political attack on King Æthelred by former supporters of Edward. Alternatively, Æthelred has been seen as one of the key forces in the promotion of Edward's cult and that of their sister Eadgifu ([[Edith of Wilton]]). He was thought to make the charter in 1001 granting land to Shaftesbury at the elevation of Edward's relics, and some accounts suggest that Æthelred legislated the observation of Edward's feast days across England in a law code of 1008. It is unclear whether this innovation, seemingly drafted by Archbishop Wulfstan II, dates from Æthelred's reign.  It may instead have been promulgated by King [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]]. David Rollason has drawn attention to the increased importance of the cults of other murdered royal saints in this period. Among these are the cults of King [[Ecgberht of Kent]]'s nephews, whose lives form part of the [[Mildrith]] Legend, and those of the [[Mercia]]n Saints [[Kenelm]] and [[Wigstan]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Æthelred the Unready'', pp. 14–17; Rollason, ''Mildrith Legend'', pp. 53–57; Hart, &quot;Edward&quot;, p. 785; Miller, &quot;Edward the Martyr&quot;; Ridyard, ''Royal Saints'', pp. 154–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the sixteenth century and English Reformation, [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] led the [[dissolution of the monasteries]] and many holy places were demolished.  Edward's remains were hidden so as to avoid [[desecration]].&lt;ref name=&quot;life&quot;&gt;{{Citation  | last =Serfes

In 1931, the relics were recovered by Wilson-Claridge during an [[archaeological]] excavation; their identity was confirmed by Dr. [[Thomas E. A. Stowell|T. E. A. Stowell]], an osteologist. In 1970, examinations performed on the relics suggested that the young man had died in the same manner as Edward.&lt;ref name=&quot;NN&quot;&gt;{{Citation| title =St Edward the Martyr| work =Necropolis Notables| publisher =The Brookwood Cemetery Society| url =http://www.tbcs.org.uk/st_edward_the_martyr.htm| access-date =2007-09-21| url-status =dead| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20151106070324/http://www.tbcs.org.uk/st_edward_the_martyr.htm| archive-date =2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wilson-Claridge wanted the relics to go to the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]]. His brother, however, wanted them to be returned to [[Shaftesbury Abbey]]. For decades, the relics were kept in a cutlery box in a bank vault at the [[Midland Bank]] in [[Woking]], [[Surrey]]&lt;ref&gt;''Magnificent Monarchs'' (Fact Attack series) p.20-21 by [[Ian Locke]]; published by [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] in 1999; {{ISBN|978-0330-374965}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the unresolved dispute about which of two churches should have them.&lt;ref name=&quot;LL&quot;&gt;{{Citation  | last =Longford  | first =Elizabeth | author-link = Elizabeth Longford | title =Oxford Book of Royal Anecdotes  | publisher =Oxford Univ. Press  | year =1991  | location =Oxford  | pages =29–30  | isbn = 0-19-282851-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia was victorious and placed the relics in a church in [[Brookwood Cemetery]] in Woking, with the enshrinement ceremony occurring in September 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;NN&quot; /&gt; The St Edward Brotherhood of monks was organized there as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;NN&quot; /&gt; The church is now named [[St Edward the Martyr Orthodox Church]], and it is under the jurisdiction of a traditionalist Greek Orthodox community.

In the Orthodox Church, St Edward is ranked as a [[Passion-bearer]], a type of saint who accepts death out of love for Christ.&lt;ref name=&quot;NN&quot; /&gt; Edward was widely venerated before the canonization process was formalized,&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.allexperts.com/q/British-History-3243/Alfred-Great.htm Mark Smith, AllExperts British History, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; and he is also regarded as a saint in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Anglican Communion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NN&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ste&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=About St Edward's |work=St Edward King and Martyr |publisher=St Edward King and Martyr |url=http://www.st-edwards-cam.org.uk/about.shtml |access-date=2007-10-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071004132653/http://www.st-edwards-cam.org.uk/about.shtml |archive-date=2007-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[feast day]] is celebrated on 18 March, the day of his murder. The Orthodox Church commemorates him a second time each year on [[September 3 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|3 September]] and commemorates the translation of his relics into Orthodox possession on [[February 13 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|13 February]].

[[File:2009-04-13 ConstantineTheGreat York.jpg|thumb|[[Constantine the Great]] ([[York]])]]
__NOTOC__
Year '''306''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CCCVI]]''') was a [[common year starting on Tuesday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Constantius and Valerius''' (or, less frequently, '''year 1059 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 306 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

Brooklyn was an independent incorporated city (and previously an authorized village and town within the provisions of the [[New York State Constitution]]) until January 1, 1898, when, after a long political campaign and public relations battle during the 1890s, according to the new Municipal Charter of &quot;Greater New York&quot;, [[consolidation of New York City|Brooklyn was consolidated]] with other cities, towns, and counties, to form the modern ''City of New York'', surrounding the [[New York Bay|Upper New York Bay]] with five constituent boroughs. The borough continues, however, to maintain a [[Culture of Brooklyn|distinct culture]]. Many [[List of Brooklyn neighborhoods|Brooklyn neighborhoods]] are [[ethnic enclave]]s. Brooklyn's official motto, displayed on the Borough [[Seal (device)|seal]] and [[Flags of New York City's boroughs#Brooklyn|flag]], is {{lang|nl|Eendraght Maeckt Maght}}, which translates from early modern [[Dutch language|Dutch]] as &quot;[[Unity makes strength]]&quot;.

The name Brooklyn is derived from the original [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch colonial]] name ''Breuckelen''. The oldest mention of the settlement in the Netherlands, is in a charter of 953 of Holy Roman Emperor Otto I, namely ''Broecklede''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manten|first=A.

The history of [[European colonization of the Americas|European settlement]] in Brooklyn spans more than 350 years. The settlement began in the 17th century as the small [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch-founded]] town of &quot;Breuckelen&quot; on the [[East River]] shore of [[Long Island]], grew to be a sizeable city in the 19th century, and was consolidated in 1898 with New York City (then confined to [[Manhattan]] and [[the Bronx]]), the remaining rural areas of Kings County, and the largely rural areas of [[Queens]] and [[Staten Island]], to form the modern City of New York.

===Colonial era===

====Six Dutch towns====
The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] were the first Europeans to settle Long Island's western edge, which was then largely inhabited by the [[Lenape]], an Algonquian-speaking [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] tribe often referred to in colonial documents by a variation of the place name &quot;[[Canarsie]]&quot;. Bands were associated with place names, but the colonists thought their names represented different tribes. The ''Breuckelen'' settlement was named after [[Breukelen]] in the [[Netherlands]]; it was part of [[New Netherland]]. The [[Dutch West India Company]] lost little time in chartering the six original parishes (listed here by their later English town names):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bklyn-genealogy-info.com/Town/Bushwick/index.html ''Brooklyn Daily Eagle''], &quot;Map of six townships&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gravesend, Brooklyn|Gravesend]]: in 1645, settled under Dutch patent by English followers of [[Anabaptist]] [[Deborah Moody]], named for [['s-Gravenzande]], Netherlands, or [[Gravesend]], England
* [[Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn|Brooklyn Heights]]: as ''Breuckelen'' in 1646, after the town now spelled [[Breukelen]], [[Netherlands]]. Breuckelen was along Fulton Street (now Fulton Mall) between Hoyt Street and Smith Street (according to H. Stiles and P. Ross). Brooklyn Heights, or Clover Hill, is where the village of Brooklyn was founded in 1816.
* [[Flatlands, Brooklyn|Flatlands]]: as ''Nieuw [[Amersfoort]]'' in 1647
* [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]]: as ''[[Midwood, Brooklyn|Midwout]]'' in 1652
* [[New Utrecht, Brooklyn|''Nieuw Utrecht'']]: in 1657, after the city of [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], Netherlands
* [[Bushwick, Brooklyn|Bushwick]]: as ''Boswijck'' in 1661

[[File: Dining table in Brooklyn, c. 1664 IMG 3837.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.15|A typical dining table in the Dutch village of Brooklyn, {{circa|1664}}, from [[The Brooklyn Museum]]]]

The colony's capital of [[New Amsterdam]], across the East River, obtained its charter in 1653. The neighborhood of [[Marine Park, Brooklyn|Marine Park]] was home to North America's first [[tide mill]]. It was built by the Dutch, and the foundation can be seen today. But the area was not formally settled as a town. Many incidents and documents relating to this period are in [[Gabriel Furman]]'s 1824 compilation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/libraryscience/30/ ''Notes Geographical and Historical, relating to the Town of Brooklyn, in Kings County on Long-Island''].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Six townships in an English province====
[[File:BrooklynMap1766.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Village of Brooklyn and environs, 1766]]
What is now Brooklyn today left Dutch hands after the final [[Kingdom of England|English]] conquest of [[New Netherland]] in 1664, a prelude to the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]]. New Netherland was taken in a naval action, and the conquerors renamed their prize for the overall English naval commander, [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]], brother of the then monarch [[Charles II of England|King Charles II of England]] and future king himself as [[James II of England|King James II of England and James VII of Scotland]]; Brooklyn became a part of the new English and later British colony, the [[Province of New York]].

The English reorganized the six old Dutch towns on southwestern Long Island as ''Kings County'' on November 1, 1683,&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Col. Laws, ch4/1:122&lt;/ref&gt; one of the [[Province of New York#Counties|&quot;original twelve counties&quot;]] then established in New York Province. This tract of land was recognized as a political entity for the first time, and the municipal groundwork was laid for a later expansive idea of Brooklyn identity.

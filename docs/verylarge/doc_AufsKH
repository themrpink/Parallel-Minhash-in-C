Crawford continued her reign as a popular movie actress well into the mid-1930s. ''[[No More Ladies]]'' (1935) co-starred Robert Montgomery and then-husband Franchot Tone, and was a success. Crawford had long pleaded with MGM's head [[Louis B. Mayer]] to cast her in more dramatic roles, and although he was reluctant, he cast her in the sophisticated comedy-drama ''[[I Live My Life]]'' (1935), directed by [[W. S. Van Dyke]], and it was well received by critics.

She next starred in ''[[The Gorgeous Hussy]]'' (1936), opposite [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]] and Lionel Barrymore, as well as Tone. It was a critical and box-office success, and became one of Crawford's biggest hits of the decade. ''[[Love on the Run (1936 film)|Love on the Run]]'' (1936), a romantic comedy directed by W. S. Van Dyke, was her seventh film co-starring Clark Gable.

Even though Crawford remained a respected MGM actress, and her films still earned profits, her popularity declined in the late 1930s. In 1937, Crawford was proclaimed the first &quot;Queen of the Movies&quot; by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. She unexpectedly slipped from seventh to sixteenth place at the box office that year, and her public popularity also began to wane.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas, p. 113&quot;&gt;Thomas, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Boleslawski]]'s comedy-drama ''[[The Last of Mrs. Cheyney (1937 film)|The Last of Mrs. Cheyney]]'' (1937) teamed her opposite [[William Powell]] in their sole screen pairing. The film was also Crawford's last box-office success before the onset of her &quot;box office poison&quot; period.

She co-starred opposite Franchot Tone for the seventh—and final—time in ''[[The Bride Wore Red]]'' (1937). The film was generally unfavorably reviewed by the majority of critics. It also ran a financial loss, becoming one of MGM's biggest failures of the year. ''[[Mannequin (1937 film)|Mannequin]]'', co-starring Spencer Tracy, also released in 1937 did, as the ''New York Times'' stated, &quot;restore Crawford to her throne as queen of the working girls&quot;.
[[File:Crawford+tone 1936.jpg|thumb|left|Crawford with second husband, actor [[Franchot Tone]], 1936|alt=]]
On May 3, 1938, Crawford—along with Greta Garbo, Norma Shearer, [[Luise Rainer]], John Barrymore, [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Dolores del Río]], and others—was dubbed &quot;[[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|Box Office Poison]]&quot; in an open letter in the ''Independent Film Journal''. The list was submitted by Harry Brandt, president of the Independent Theatre Owners Association of America. Brandt stated that while these stars had &quot;unquestioned&quot; dramatic abilities, their high salaries did not reflect in their ticket sales, thus hurting the movie exhibitors involved. Crawford's follow-up movie, ''[[The Shining Hour]]'' (1938), co-starring [[Margaret Sullavan]] and [[Melvyn Douglas]], was well received by critics, but it was a box-office flop.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

She made a comeback in 1939 with her role as home-wrecker Crystal Allen in ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'', opposite her professional nemesis, Norma Shearer. A year later, she played against type in the unglamorous role of Julie in ''[[Strange Cargo (1940 film)|Strange Cargo]]'' (1940), her eighth—and final—film with Clark Gable. She later starred as a facially disfigured blackmailer in ''[[A Woman's Face]]'' (1941), a remake of the Swedish film ''[[A Woman's Face (1938 film)|En kvinnas ansikte]]'' which had starred [[Ingrid Bergman]] in the lead role three years earlier. While the film was only a moderate box office success, Crawford's performance was hailed by many critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1941/05/16/archives/at-the-capitol.html |title=At the Capitol |last=T.S. |date=1941-05-16 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-12-14 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crawford adopted her first child, a daughter, in 1940. Because she was single, California law prevented her from adopting within the state; so, she arranged the adoption through an agency in Las Vegas. The child was temporarily called Joan, until Crawford changed her name to [[Christina Crawford|Christina]]. Crawford married actor [[Phillip Terry]] on July 21, 1942, after a six-month courtship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Joan Crawford Weds Actor Phillip Terry |work=Lubbock (TX) Morning Avalanche |page=11 |publisher=UP |date=July 22, 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, the couple adopted a son whom they named Christopher, but his birth mother reclaimed the child. The couple adopted another boy, whom they named Phillip Terry, Jr. After the marriage ended in 1946, Crawford changed that child's name to Christopher Crawford.

After 18 years, Crawford's contract with MGM was terminated by mutual consent on June 29, 1943. In lieu of the last film remaining under her contract, MGM bought her out for $100,000.

===Move to Warner Bros.===
For $500,000, Crawford signed with [[Warner Bros.]] for a three-movie deal, and was placed on the payroll on July 1, 1943. Her first film for the studio was ''[[Hollywood Canteen (film)|Hollywood Canteen]]'' (1944), an all-star morale-booster film that teamed her with several other top movie stars at the time. Crawford said one of the main reasons she signed with Warner Bros. was because she wanted to play the character &quot;Mattie&quot; in a proposed 1944 film version of [[Edith Wharton]]'s novel ''[[Ethan Frome]]'' (1911).
[[File:Joan Crawford in Mildred Pierce trailer.jpg|thumb|''Mildred Pierce'' trailer (1945)|alt=]]
She wanted to play the title role in ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (1945), but [[Bette Davis]] was the studio's first choice. However, Davis turned the role down. Director [[Michael Curtiz]] did not want Crawford to play the part, and he instead lobbied for the casting of [[Barbara Stanwyck]]. Warner Bros. defied Curtiz and cast Crawford in the film. Throughout the entire production of the movie, Curtiz criticized Crawford. &quot;She comes over here with her high-hat airs and her goddamn shoulder pads... Why should I waste my time directing a has-been?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Curtiz, quoted in Thomas, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Curtiz demanded Crawford prove her suitability by taking a screen test; she agreed. After the test, Curtiz agreed to Crawford's casting. Costume fittings started filming off roughly when Curtiz suspected Crawford of wearing shoulder pads and he proceeded to tear the top of her dress. She said &quot;Thankfully I was wearing a bra.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jorgensen |first1=Jay |last2=Scoggins |first2=Donald L. |title=Creating the Illusion: A Fashionable History of Hollywood Costume Designers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4G4uCgAAQBAJ&amp;q=joan+crawford+curtiz+shoulder+pad&amp;pg=PA73 |publisher=Running Press |date=2015-10-06 |isbn=9780762458073}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mildred Pierce'' was a resounding critical and commercial success. It epitomized the lush visual style and the hard-boiled [[film noir]] sensibility that defined Warner Bros. movies of the late forties. Crawford earned the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress in a Leading Role]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Miller |first1=Julie |title=The Academy Award That Joan Crawford Accepted in Bed Sells; Can You Guess for How Much? |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2012/09/joan-crawford-academy-award-auction |website=Vanity Fair |date=September 26, 2012 |accessdate=December 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of ''Mildred Pierce'' revived Crawford's movie career. For several years, she starred in what were called &quot;a series of first-rate [[melodrama]]s&quot;. Her next film was ''[[Humoresque (1946 film)|Humoresque]]'' (1946), co-starring [[John Garfield]], a romantic drama about a love affair between an older woman and a younger man. She starred alongside [[Van Heflin]] in ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947), for which she received a second Academy Award nomination. In ''[[Daisy Kenyon]]'' (1947), she appeared opposite [[Dana Andrews]] and [[Henry Fonda]], and in ''[[Flamingo Road (film)|Flamingo Road]]'' (1949), her character has an ultimately deadly feud with a corrupt southern sheriff played by [[Sydney Greenstreet]]. She made a cameo in ''[[It's a Great Feeling]]'' (1949), poking fun at her own screen image. In 1950, she starred in the film noir ''[[The Damned Don't Cry]]'' and in the melodrama ''[[Harriet Craig]]''.

In 1947, Crawford adopted two more children, whom she named Cindy and Cathy. The children were adopted from [[Tennessee Children's Home Society]], an orphanage/child-trafficking unit operated by [[Georgia Tann]], a source used by many childless Hollywood stars to adopt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Raymond |first=Barbara Bisantz |title=The Baby Thief: The Untold Story of Georgia Tann, the Baby Seller Who Corrupted Adoption |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zin051ICeYoC&amp;q=childless+Hollywood+stars+adopt++Tann's+discovery+and+death+erupted+in+infamy |publisher=Hachette Books |date=2009-04-29 |isbn=978-0-7867-3374-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; until Tann's discovery and death erupted in infamy in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Austin |first=Linda T. |title=Babies for Sale: Tennessee Children's Adoption Scandal |journal=Tennessee Historical Quarterly |volume=49 |issue=2 |date=1990 |pages=91–102 |jstor=42626860 |issn=0040-3261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the completion of ''[[This Woman Is Dangerous]]'' (1952), a film Crawford called her &quot;worst&quot;, she asked to be released from her Warner Bros. contract. By this time, she felt Warners was losing interest in her due to &quot;feeble scripts, poor leading men and inept cameramen&quot;, so she decided it was time to move on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Joan Crawford: Hollywood Martyr |last=Bret |first=David |publisher=Da Capo Press |location=Cambridge, MA |date=2009 |isbn=9780786732364 |oclc=818854961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same year, she received her third—and final—Academy Award nomination for ''[[Sudden Fear]]'' for [[RKO Radio Pictures]].

===Radio and television===
Crawford worked in the radio series ''[[The Screen Guild Theater]]'' on January 8, 1939; ''Good News''; ''Baby'', broadcast on March 2, 1940, on [[Arch Oboler]]'s ''[[Lights Out (radio show)|Lights Out]]''; ''The Word'' on ''[[Everyman's Theater]]'' (1941); ''Chained'' on the ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]'', and [[Norman Corwin]]'s ''Document A/777'' (1948). She appeared in episodes of anthology television series in the 1950s, and, in 1959, made a pilot for ''The Joan Crawford Show''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Terrace |first=Vincent |title=Encyclopedia of Unaired Television Pilots, 1945–2018 |isbn=9781476633497 |location=Jefferson, NC |date=October 9, 2018 |oclc=1056952162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al Steele and Pepsi-Cola Company===
Crawford married her fourth—and final—husband, [[Alfred Steele]], at the [[Flamingo Las Vegas|Flamingo Hotel]] in Las Vegas on May 10, 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Joan Crawford Is Wed in Las Vegas to Businessman |work=Moberly (MO) Monitor-Index and Democrat |page=8 |agency=Associated Press |date=May 10, 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford and Steele met at a party in 1950, when Steele was an executive at [[PepsiCo]]. They renewed their acquaintance at a New Year's Eve party in 1954. By that time, Steele had become president of Pepsi-Cola.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; He later was named chairman of the board and CEO of Pepsi-Cola. Crawford traveled extensively on behalf of Pepsi following the marriage. She estimated that she traveled over 100,000 miles for the company.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0323.html |title=Joan Crawford Dies at Home; Joan Crawford, Screen Star, Dies in Manhattan Home |date=May 11, 1977 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=August 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steele died of a heart attack in April 1959. Crawford initially was advised that her services were no longer required. After she told the story to [[Louella Parsons]], Pepsi reversed its position, and Crawford was elected to fill the vacant seat on the board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;Considine, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;

Crawford received the sixth annual &quot;Pally Award&quot;, which was in the shape of a bronze Pepsi bottle. It was awarded to the employee making the most significant contribution to company sales. In 1973, Crawford was forced to retire from the company at the behest of company executive [[Donald M. Kendall|Don Kendall]], whom Crawford had referred to for years as &quot;Fang&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;QuirkSchoell2013&quot; /&gt;

===Later career===
[[File:Louis B Mayer and Joan Crawford.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|In 1953 with [[Louis B. Mayer]] at the premiere of ''Torch Song.''&lt;br /&gt;&quot;To me, L.B. Mayer was my father, my father confessor, the best friend I ever had&quot;, Crawford was quoted as saying.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hay, 22&quot;&gt;Hay, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=]]
After her Academy Award-nominated performance in 1952's ''[[Sudden Fear]]'', Crawford continued to work steadily throughout the rest of the decade. After a 10-year absence from MGM, she returned to that studio to star in ''[[Torch Song (1953 film)|Torch Song]]'' (1953), a musical drama centering on the life of a demanding stage star who falls in love with a blind pianist, played by [[Michael Wilding (actor)|Michael Wilding]]. Although the film was highly publicized as Crawford's major comeback, it was a critical and financial failure, known today for its [[Camp (style)|camp]] appeal. In 1954, she starred in ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'', a [[cult film|cult]] [[cult following|classic]] directed by [[Nicholas Ray]], co-starring [[Sterling Hayden]] and [[Mercedes McCambridge]]. She also starred in ''[[Female on the Beach]]'' (1955) with [[Jeff Chandler]], and in ''[[Queen Bee (film)|Queen Bee]]'' (1955), alongside [[John Ireland (actor)|John Ireland]]. The following year, she starred opposite a young [[Cliff Robertson]] in ''[[Autumn Leaves (film)|Autumn Leaves]]'' (1956), and filmed a leading role in ''[[The Story of Esther Costello]]'' (1957), co-starring [[Rossano Brazzi]]. Crawford, who had been left near-penniless following Alfred Steele's death,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=I'm Broke, Says Joan Crawford|work=Jefferson City (MO) Post-Tribune|page=1|agency=Associated Press|date=June 1, 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; accepted a small role in ''[[The Best of Everything (1959 film)|The Best of Everything]]'' (1959). Although she was not the star of the film, she received positive reviews. Crawford later named the role as being one of her personal favorites. By 1961, Joan Crawford was once again her own publicity machine, with a new script, &quot;Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot;, sent by [[Robert Aldrich]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bette and Joan: the divine feud|first=Shaun|last=Considine|date=2010|publisher=iUniverse.com, Inc|isbn=978-1450243278|edition= Authors Guild backinprint.com |location=Lincoln, NE|oclc=650442615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joan Crawford in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane trailer.jpg|alt=Facial shot of a dishevelled middle-aged woman on the telephone.|thumb|Crawford as Blanche Hudson]]
Crawford starred as Blanche Hudson, an elderly, disabled former [[A-list]] movie star who lives in fear of her psychotic sister [[Baby Jane Hudson|Jane]], in the highly successful psychological thriller ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962). Despite the actresses' earlier tensions, Crawford reportedly suggested [[Bette Davis]] for the role of Jane. The two stars maintained publicly that there was no feud between them. The director, [[Robert Aldrich]], fueling publicity rumors, explained that Davis and Crawford were each aware of how important the film was to their respective careers, and commented, &quot;It's proper to say that they really detested each other, but they behaved absolutely perfectly.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Considine, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

After filming was completed, their public comments against each other propelled their animosity into a life-long feud. The film was a huge success, recouping its costs within eleven days of its nationwide release reviving Davis and Crawford's careers. Davis was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance as Jane Hudson. Crawford contacted each of the other Oscar nominees in the category ([[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Lee Remick]], [[Geraldine Page]], and [[Anne Bancroft]], all East Coast-based actresses), to let them know that if they could not attend the ceremony, she would be happy to accept the Oscar on their behalf; all agreed. Both Davis and Crawford were backstage - Crawford having presented best director - when the absent [[Anne Bancroft]] was announced as the winner and Crawford accepted the award on her behalf. Davis claimed for the rest of her life that Crawford had campaigned against her, a charge Crawford denied.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

That same year, Crawford starred as Lucy Harbin in [[William Castle]]'s horror mystery ''[[Strait-Jacket]]'' (1964). [[Robert Aldrich]] cast Crawford and Davis in ''[[Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte]]'' (1964). After a purported campaign of harassment by Davis on location in Louisiana, Crawford returned to Hollywood entering a hospital. After a prolonged absence, during which Crawford was accused of feigning illness, Aldrich was forced to replace her with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. Crawford, who was devastated, said &quot;I heard the news of my replacement over the radio, lying in my hospital bed ... I cried for nine hours.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford nursed grudges against Davis and Aldrich for the rest of her life, saying of Aldrich, &quot;He is a man who loves evil, horrendous, vile things&quot;, to which Aldrich replied &quot;If the shoe fits, wear it, and I am very fond of Miss Crawford&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Considine, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being replaced, brief footage of Crawford made it into the film when she is seen sitting in a taxi in a wide shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K_40HXjkKw|title=The References: &quot;Feud&quot; Episode 7 + &quot;Hush...

[[File:Joan Crawford Night Gallery 1969.JPG|left|thumb|alt=|''Night Gallery'' episode (1969)]]
In 1965, she played Amy Nelson in ''[[I Saw What You Did]]'', another William Castle vehicle. She starred as Monica Rivers in [[Herman Cohen]]'s horror thriller film ''[[Berserk!]]'' (1967). After the film's release, Crawford guest-starred as herself on ''[[The Lucy Show]]''. The episode, &quot;Lucy and the Lost Star&quot;, first aired on February 26, 1968. Crawford struggled during rehearsals, and drank heavily on-set, leading series star [[Lucille Ball]] to suggest replacing her with [[Gloria Swanson]]. However, Crawford was letter-perfect the day of the show, which included dancing the Charleston, and received two standing ovations from the studio audience.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1968, Crawford's 29-year-old daughter, Christina (who was then acting in New York on the soap opera ''[[The Secret Storm]]''), needed immediate medical attention for a ruptured ovarian tumor. Despite the fact that Christina's character was a 28-year-old, and Crawford was in her sixties, Crawford offered to play her role until Christina was well enough to return, to which producer [[Gloria Monty]] readily agreed.&lt;ref name=&quot;joan&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Windeler |first=Robert |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/10/23/archives/joan-crawford-takes-daughters-soap-opera-role.html |title=Joan Crawford Takes Daughter's Soap Opera Role |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 23, 1968 |accessdate=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crawford's appearance in the 1969 television film ''[[Night Gallery (film)|Night Gallery]]'' (which served as pilot to the series that followed) marked one of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s earliest directing jobs. Crawford made a cameo appearance as herself in the first episode of ''[[The Tim Conway Show (1970 TV series)|The Tim Conway Show]]'', which aired on January 30, 1970. She starred on the big screen one final time, playing Dr. Brockton in Herman Cohen's science fiction horror film ''[[Trog]]'' (1970), rounding out a career spanning 45 years and more than 80 motion pictures. Crawford made three more television appearances, including one as Stephanie White in a 1970 episode (&quot;The Nightmare&quot;) of ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' and as Joan Fairchild (her final dramatic performance) in a 1972 episode (&quot;Dear Joan: We're Going to Scare You to Death&quot;) of ''[[The Sixth Sense (TV series)|The Sixth Sense]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIrPtI_uD_Q |title=Joan Crawford on The Sixth Sense |work=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=October 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final years==
In 1970, Crawford was presented with the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award|Cecil B. DeMille Award]] by [[John Wayne]] at the [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globes]], which was telecast from the Coconut Grove at [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|The Ambassador Hotel]] in Los Angeles. She also spoke at Stephens College, where she had been a student for two months in 1922.&lt;ref name=&quot;Considine2017&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Shaun Considine|title=Bette &amp; Joan: The Divine Feud|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MhT-DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT347|date=January 25, 2017|publisher=Graymalkin Media|isbn=978-1-63168-107-3|page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crawford published her autobiography, ''A Portrait of Joan'', co-written with [[Jane Ardmore|Jane Kesner Ardmore]], in 1962 through Doubleday. Crawford's next book, ''My Way of Life'', was published in 1971 by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]. Those expecting a racy tell-all were disappointed, although Crawford's meticulous ways were revealed in her advice on grooming, wardrobe, exercise, and even food storage. After her death, photographs of [[John F. Kennedy]] (for whom she had voted in the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 presidential election]])&lt;ref&gt;Cowie, Peter. ''Joan Crawford: The Enduring Star'' (Rizzoli Universe Promotional Books, March 8, 2011), pp. 204–205&lt;/ref&gt; were found in her apartment.

In September 1973, Crawford moved from apartment 22-G to a smaller apartment next door, 22-H, at the Imperial House, 150 East 69th Street. Her last public appearance was made on September 23, 1974, at a book party cohosted with her old friend [[Rosalind Russell]] at New York's [[Rainbow Room]]. Russell was suffering from breast cancer and arthritis at the time. When Crawford saw the unflattering photos that appeared in the papers the next day, she said &quot;If that's how I look, then they won't see me anymore.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Considine, p. 396&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford cancelled all public appearances, began declining interviews, and left her apartment less and less. Dental problems, including surgery which left her needing round-the-clock nursing care, plagued her from 1972 until mid-1975. While on antibiotics for this problem in October 1974, her drinking caused her to pass out, slip, and strike her face. Whether it was this incident or her return to religion, [[Christian Science]], she quit drinking in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnnes |first=Carl |title=Joan Crawford: The Last Years |publisher=Dell Publishing |isbn=0-440-11536-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
On May 6, 1977, Crawford gave away her [[Shih Tzu]], Princess Lotus Blossom, because she was too weak to continue to care for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=There's No Place Like Home: Confessions of an Interior Designer by Carleton Varney |last=Varney |first=Carleton |date=1980|publisher=Bobbs-Merrill|isbn=978-0672518720|edition= Hardcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford died on May 10, 1977, at her apartment in [[Lenox Hill]], New York City, of a [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/11/archives/joan-crawford-dies-at-home-joan-crawford-screen-star-dies-in.html|title=Joan Crawford Dies at Home|last=Flint|first=Peter B.|date=1977-05-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-11-30|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; A funeral was held at [[Campbell Funeral Home]], New York, on May 13, 1977. In her will, which was signed on October 28, 1976, Crawford bequeathed to her two youngest children, Cindy and Cathy, $77,500 each from her $2&amp;nbsp;million estate.

She explicitly disinherited the two eldest, Christina and Christopher: &quot;It is my intention to make no provision herein for my son, Christopher, or my daughter, Christina, for reasons which are well known to them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.joancrawfordbest.com/willtext.htm |title=Joan Crawford's Last Will and Testament}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of them challenged the will and received a $55,000 settlement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert. 2002&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Hollywood book of death : the bizarre, often sordid, passings of more than 125 American movie and TV idols|last=Robert.|first=Parish, James|date=2002|publisher=Contemporary Books|isbn=0809222272|location=Chicago|oclc=46617003}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also bequeathed nothing to her niece, Joan Lowe (1933–1999; born Joan Crawford LeSueur, the only child of her estranged brother, Hal). Crawford left money to her favorite charities: the USO of New York, the [[Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital]], the [[American Cancer Society]], the [[Muscular Dystrophy Association]], the [[American Heart Association]], and the Wiltwyck School for Boys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/03/crawford200803# &quot;Daughter Dearest&quot;], March 2008, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, she was a member of [[American Women's Voluntary Services]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Essential Biography2&quot; /&gt;

A memorial service was held for Crawford at All Souls' Unitarian Church on Lexington Avenue in New York on May 16, 1977.

Crawford has also attracted a following in the gay community.

==''Mommie Dearest''==
{{main|Mommie Dearest}}
In November 1978, Christina Crawford published ''[[Mommie Dearest]]'', which contained allegations that her late adoptive mother was emotionally and physically abusive to Christina and her brother Christopher because she chose fame and her career over parenthood.

Many of Crawford's friends and co-workers, including [[Van Johnson]], [[Ann Blyth]], [[Myrna Loy]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Cesar Romero]], [[Gary Gray (actor)|Gary Gray]], [[Douglas Fairbanks Jr.]] (Crawford's first husband), and Crawford's two other younger daughters, Cathy and Cindy, denounced the book, categorically denying any abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Considine, p. 412&lt;/ref&gt; Others including [[Betty Hutton]], [[Helen Hayes]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Hayes&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hayes|first1=Helen|author-link1=Helen Hayes|last2=Hatch|first2=Katherine|title=My Life in Three Acts|year=1990|publisher=Harcourt, Brace Jovanovich|isbn=0-15-163695-8|url=https://archive.org/details/mylifeinthreeact00haye_0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James MacArthur]] (Hayes' son),&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsweek&quot;&gt;[[Jean Strouse|Strouse, Jean]] (1978). &quot;Mommie Monster&quot; ''Newsweek'': Volume 92, Issues 10–18, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; [[June Allyson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allyson|first1=June|author-link1=June Allyson|last2=Leighton|first2=Frances Spatz|title=June Allyson|year=1983|publisher=Berkley|location=New York|isbn=0-425-06251-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/juneallyson00ally/page/77 77–84]|url=https://archive.org/details/juneallyson00ally/page/77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vincent Sherman]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherman&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherman|first=Vincent|title=Studio Affairs: My Life As a Film Director|year=1996|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0813119758|pages=209–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated they had witnessed some form of abusive behavior.

''Mommie Dearest'' became a best-seller, and was made into the 1981 film ''[[Mommie Dearest (film)|Mommie Dearest]]'', starring [[Faye Dunaway]] as Crawford.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Ebert (January 1, 1981). [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19810101/REVIEWS/101010346/1023 &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot;], ''Chicago Sun-Times''; accessed March 12, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Pictures of Crawford were used in the album artwork of The Rolling Stones album ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' (1972).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.popsike.com/ROLLING-STONES-EXILE-ON-MAIN-STREET-1972-COC-UK-1st-Press-2LP-Excellent/192027513582.html ROLLING STONES EXILE ON MAIN STREET 1972 COC UK 1st Press 2LP]&lt;/ref&gt;

Four years after her death, [[Blue Öyster Cult]] released the song &quot;[[Joan Crawford (song)|Joan Crawford]]&quot; as part of their album ''[[Fire of Unknown Origin]] (''1981).

The alleged feud between Crawford and Bette Davis is depicted in the 1989 book ''[[Bette and Joan: The Divine Feud]]''. It was fueled by competition over film roles, Academy Awards, and Franchot Tone (Joan Crawford's second husband), who was Davis's co-star in 1935's ''[[Dangerous (film)|Dangerous]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;nypost&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2017/02/26/why-bette-davis-and-joan-crawfords-feud-lasted-a-lifetime|title=Why Bette Davis and Joan Crawford's Feud Lasted a Lifetime|first=Robert |last=Rorke|work=[[The New York Post]]|date=February 26, 2017|accessdate=February 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crawford-Davis rivalry is the subject of the 2017 first season of the television series ''[[Feud (TV series)|Feud]]'', inspired by the book and subtitled ''Bette and Joan''. Crawford is played by [[Jessica Lange]], and Davis is played by [[Susan Sarandon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;variety&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/feud-ryan-murphy-fx-anthology-jessica-lange-susan-sarandon-1201758686|title=''Feud'': Ryan Murphy Lands Third FX Anthology With Susan Sarandon, Jessica Lange|first=Elizabeth|last=Wagmeister|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 5, 2016|accessdate=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/fx-premiere-dates-feud-the-americans-archer-1201959126|title=FX Sets Premiere Dates for ''Feud'', ''The Americans'', ''Archer''|work=Variety|first=Debra|last=Birnbaum|date=January 12, 2017|accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, any streaming/airing of this series was stopped by restraint order from lower California courts until [[Olivia de Havilland]] could be heard by the United States Supreme Court on whether producers had the right to use her likeness without permission despite her being a public figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/actress-olivia-de-havilland-now-102-will-take-feud-supreme-court-1137142 |title=Olivia de Havilland, Now 102, Will Take 'Feud' to Supreme Court |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=November 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2019, the Supreme Court refused to hear the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2019/01/07/supreme-court-wont-hear-olivia-de-havillands-case-feud/2506752002/ |title=Supreme Court won't hear Olivia de Havilland case that 'Feud' depicted her as gossipmonger |website=USA Today |access-date=2019-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restraint is no longer in place.

The Christian holiday of '''Pentecost''', which is celebrated the 50th day (the seventh Sunday) from [[Easter Sunday]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Pritchard2019&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pritchard |first1=Ray |title=What Is Pentecost? |url=https://www.christianity.com/jesus/early-church-history/pentecost/where-did-pentecost-come-from.html |publisher=[[Christianity.com]] |accessdate=9 June 2019 |language=English |quote=According to the Old Testament, you would go to the day of the celebration of Firstfruits, and beginning with that day, you would count off 50 days. The fiftieth day would be the Day of Pentecost. So Firstfruits is the beginning of the barley harvest and Pentecost the celebration of the beginning of the wheat harvest. Since it was always 50 days after Firstfruits, and since 50 days equals seven weeks, it always came a &quot;week of weeks&quot; later.}}&lt;/ref&gt; commemorates the descent of the [[Holy Spirit]] upon the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] and other followers of [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] while they were in Jerusalem celebrating the [[Feast of Weeks]], as described in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Acts|chapter=2|verse=1|range=–31}}).

The holiday is also called &quot;White Sunday&quot; or &quot;[[Whitsunday]]&quot; or &quot;Whitsun&quot;, especially in the [[United Kingdom]], where traditionally the next day, [[Whit Monday]], was also a public holiday (since 1971 fixed by statute on the last Monday in May). The Monday after Pentecost is a legal holiday in many European countries.

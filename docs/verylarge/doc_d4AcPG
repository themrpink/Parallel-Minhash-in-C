===Historical accuracy===
Shaffer used [[artistic licence]] in his portrayals of Mozart and Salieri. Documentary evidence suggests that there may have been some occasional antipathy between the two men but the idea that Salieri was the instigator of Mozart's demise is not taken seriously by scholars of the men's lives and careers. While historically there may have been some rivalry and mild tension between Mozart and Salieri, there is also evidence that they enjoyed a relationship marked by mutual respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=A.

Writer [[David Cairns (writer)|David Cairns]] called ''Amadeus'' &quot;myth-mongering&quot; and argued against Shaffer's portrait of Mozart as &quot;two contradictory beings, sublime artist and fool&quot;, positing instead that Mozart was &quot;fundamentally well-integrated&quot;. Cairns also rejects the &quot;romantic legend&quot; that Mozart always wrote out perfect manuscripts of works already completely composed in his head, citing major and prolonged revisions to several manuscripts (see: [[Mozart's compositional method]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cairns|first1=David|authorlink=David Cairns (writer)|title=Mozart and his Operas|date=2006|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|isbn=978-0520228986|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mozart scholar [[H. C. Robbins Landon]] commented that &quot;it may prove difficult to dissuade the public from the current Schafferian view of the composer as a divinely gifted drunken lout, pursued by a vengeful Salieri.

[[File:Doryphoros MAN Napoli Inv6011-2.jpg|thumb|A marble copy of [[Polykleitos]]' [[Doryphoros]], an early example of classical contrapposto.]]
'''''Contrapposto''''' ({{IPA-it|kontrapˈposto}}) is an [[Italian language|Italian]] term that means &quot;counterpoise&quot;. It is used in the [[visual arts]] to describe a human figure standing with most of its weight on one foot, so that its shoulders and arms twist off-axis from the hips and legs in the axial plane.

First appearing in [[Ancient Greece]] in the early 5th century BCE, contrapposto is considered a crucial development in the history of [[Ancient Greek art]] (and, by extension, [[Art of Europe|Western art]]), as it marks the first time in Western art that the human body is used to express a psychological disposition. The style was further developed and popularized by sculptors in the [[Hellenistic Art|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman]] periods, fell out of use in the [[Middle Ages]], and was later revived during the [[Renaissance]]. [[Michaelangelo]]'s statue of [[David (Michelangelo)|David]], one of the most iconic sculptures in the world, is a famous example of contrapposto.

==Definition==
Contrapposto was historically an important sculptural development, for its appearance marks the first time in Western art that the human body is used to express a more relaxed psychological disposition. This gives the figure a more dynamic, or alternatively relaxed appearance. In the frontal plane this also results in opposite levels of shoulders and hips, for example: if the right hip is higher than the left; correspondingly the right shoulder will be lower than the left, and vice versa. The term can also be used to refer to multiple figures which are in counter-pose (or opposite pose) to one another.  It can further encompass the tension as a figure changes from resting on a given leg to walking or running upon it (so-called ''ponderation''). The leg that carries the weight of the body is known as the ''engaged'' leg, the relaxed leg is known as the ''free'' leg.&lt;ref name=Janson&gt;[[H. W. Janson|Janson, H.W.]] (1995) ''History of Art''. 5th edn. Revised and expanded by Anthony F. Janson. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], p. 139. {{ISBN|0500237018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrapposto is less emphasized than the more sinuous [[S Curve (art)|S Curve]], and creates the illusion of past and future movement.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Contrapposto&quot;.

==History==

[[Image:009MA Kritios.jpg|thumb|upright|''Kritios Boy''. c. 480 BC, was the first known Greek statue to use ''contrapposto''.]]

===Classical===
The first known statue to use contrapposto is [[Kritios Boy]], c. 480 BC,&lt;ref name=HF&gt;[[Hugh Honour|Honour, H.]] and J. Fleming, (2009) ''A World History of Art''. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 122. {{ISBN|9781856695848}}&lt;/ref&gt; so called because it was once attributed to the sculptor [[Kritios]]. It is possible, even likely, that earlier bronze statues had used the technique, but if they did, they have not survived and [[Kenneth Clark]] called the statue &quot;the first beautiful nude in art&quot;.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;Clark, Kenneth. (2010) ''The Nude: A study in ideal form''. New edition. London: [[The Folio Society]], pp. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The statue is a Greek marble original and not a Roman copy.

Prior to the introduction of contrapposto, the statues that dominated ancient Greece were the [[Archaic Greece|archaic]] [[kouros]] (male) and the [[Kore (sculpture)|kore]] (female). Contrapposto has been used since the dawn of classical western sculpture. According to the ''canon'' of the Classical Greek [[Sculpture|Sculptor]] [[Polykleitos]] in the 4th century BC, it is one of the most important characteristics of his figurative works and those of his successors, [[Lysippos]], [[Skopas]], etc. The Polykletian statues – for example, ''[[Discophoros]]'' (''discus-bearer'') and ''[[Doryphoros]]'' (''spear-bearer'') – are idealized athletic young men with the divine sense, and captured in contrapposto. In these works, the pelvis is no longer [[Axial skeleton|axial]] with the [[Kouros|vertical statue as in the archaic style]] of earlier Greek sculpture before ''Kritios Boy''.

Contrapposto can be clearly seen in the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] copies of the statues of [[Hermes]] and [[Heracles]]. A famous example is [[Hermes and the Infant Dionysus|the marble statue]] of Hermes with the infant [[Dionysus]] in [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] by [[Praxiteles]]. It can also be seen in the Roman copies of Polyclitus's ''[[Amazons|Amazon]]''.

Greek art emphasized humanism along with the human mind and the human body's beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Greek Humanism|url = http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/engl257/Ancient/greek_humanism.htm|website = www.webpages.uidaho.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek youths trained and competed in athletic contests in the nude. A great contribution to the contrapposto pose was the concept of a canon of proportions, in which mathematical properties are used to create proportions.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Max (2010). &quot;The 'Golden Canon' of book-page construction: proving the proportions geometrically&quot;. Journal of Mathematics &amp; The Arts. 4 no. 3: 137–141.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
Classical contrapposto was revived in [[Renaissance art]] by the Italian artists [[Donatello]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]], followed by [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]] and other artists of the [[High Renaissance]]. One of the achievements of the [[Italian Renaissance]] was the re-discovery of contrapposto.

'''''Forrest Gump''''' is a 1994 American [[Romance film|romantic]] [[comedy-drama]] film directed by [[Robert Zemeckis]] and written by [[Eric Roth]]. It is based on the [[Forrest Gump (novel)|1986 novel]] of the same name by [[Winston Groom]] and stars [[Tom Hanks]], [[Robin Wright]], [[Gary Sinise]], [[Mykelti Williamson]] and [[Sally Field]]. The story depicts several decades in the life of [[Forrest Gump (character)|Forrest Gump]] (Hanks), a slow-witted but kind-hearted man from [[Alabama]] who witnesses and unwittingly influences several defining historical events in the 20th century United States. The film differs substantially from the novel.

Principal photography took place between August and December 1993, mainly in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Extensive visual effects were used to incorporate Hanks into archived footage and to develop other scenes. The [[Forrest Gump (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] features songs reflecting the different periods seen in the film.

''Forrest Gump'' was released in the United States on July 6, 1994 and received favorable reviews for Zemeckis's directing, Sinise and Hanks's performances, the visual effects, the music and the screenplay. The film was an enormous success at the box office; it became the top-grossing film in America released that year and earned over {{US$|677{{nbsp}}million|link=yes}} worldwide during its theatrical run, making it the [[1994 in film|second highest-grossing film of 1994]], behind ''[[The Lion King]]''. The soundtrack sold over 12 million copies. ''Forrest Gump'' won the [[Academy Awards]] for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Hanks, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Visual Effects, and Best Film Editing. It received many [[List of accolades received by Forrest Gump|award nominations]], including [[Golden Globe]]s, [[British Academy Film Awards]] and [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]].

Varying interpretations have been made of the protagonist and the film's political symbolism. In 2011, the [[Library of Congress]] selected the film for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forrest Gump join Library of Congress film trove&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-11-240/2011-national-film-registry-more-than-a-box-of-chocolates/2011-12-28/|title=2011 National Film Registry More Than a Box of Chocolates|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/forrest-gump-bollywood-remake-works-1194721|title='Forrest Gump' Bollywood Remake in the Works|website=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing {{!}} Film Registry {{!}} National Film Preservation Board {{!}} Programs at the Library of Congress {{!}} Library of Congress|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-10-02|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
&lt;!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], film plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words.--&gt;
In 1981, at a bus stop in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], a man named Forrest Gump recounts his life story to strangers who sit next to him on a bench.

In 1951, in Greenbow, [[Alabama]], young Forrest is fitted with leg braces to correct [[Scoliosis|a curved spine]], and is unable to walk properly. He lives alone with his mother, who runs a boarding house out of their home that attracts many tenants, including a young [[Elvis Presley]], who plays the guitar for Forrest and incorporates Forrest's jerky dance movements into his performances. On his first day of school, Forrest meets a girl named Jenny Curran, and the two become best friends.

Forrest is often bullied because of his physical disability and marginal intelligence. While fleeing from several bullies, his leg braces break off, revealing Forrest to be a very fast runner. This talent eventually allows him to receive a [[American football|football]] [[scholarship]] at the [[University of Alabama]] in 1963, where he is coached by [[Bear Bryant]]; he witnesses [[List of governors of Alabama|Governor]] [[George Wallace]]'s [[Stand in the Schoolhouse Door|stand in the schoolhouse door]], becomes a top [[kick returner]], is named on the [[College Football All-America Team|All-American team]], and meets [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] at the [[White House]].

After graduating college in 1967, Forrest enlists into the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. During basic training, he befriends a fellow soldier nicknamed &quot;Bubba&quot;, who convinces Forrest to go into the [[Shrimp fishery|shrimping]] business with him after their service. In 1968, they are sent to [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], serving with the [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Division]] in the [[Mekong Delta]] region. After months of routine operations, their platoon is ambushed while on patrol, and Bubba is killed in action. Forrest saves several wounded platoon-mates—including his lieutenant, Dan Taylor, who loses both his legs—and is awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for his heroism by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].

At the [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war]] &quot;[[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam#1967 &quot;March on the Pentagon&quot;|March on the Pentagon]]&quot; rally, Forrest meets [[Abbie Hoffman]] and briefly reunites with Jenny, who has been living a [[hippie]] lifestyle. He also develops a talent for [[Table tennis|ping-pong]], and becomes a sports celebrity as he competes against Chinese teams in [[ping-pong diplomacy]], earning him an interview alongside [[John Lennon]] on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]''. He spends the holidays and the 1972 new year in [[New York City]] with Lieutenant Dan, who has become an embittered handicap. Forrest soon meets President [[Richard Nixon]] and is put up in the [[Watergate complex]], where he accidentally exposes the [[Watergate scandal]], forcing Nixon to resign. Forrest is eventually discharged from the army.

Returning to Greenbow, Forrest endorses a company that makes ping-pong paddles. He uses the earnings to buy a shrimping boat in [[Bayou La Batre, Alabama|Bayou La Batre]], fulfilling his promise to Bubba. Lieutenant Dan joins Forrest in 1974, and they initially have little success. After their boat becomes the only one to survive [[Hurricane Carmen]], they pull in huge amounts of shrimp and create the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, after which Lieutenant Dan finally thanks Forrest for saving his life. Lieutenant Dan invests into what Forrest thinks is [[Apple Inc.|”some kind of fruit company”]] and the two become millionaires, but Forrest also gives half of the earnings to Bubba's family. Forrest then returns home to see his mother as she dies of [[cancer]].

In 1976, Jenny—in the midst of recovering from years of drugs and abuse—returns to visit Forrest, and after a while he proposes to her. That night she tells Forrest she loves him and the two make love, but she leaves the next morning. Heartbroken, Forrest goes running, and spends the next three years in a relentless cross-country marathon, becoming famous again.  He eventually decides that he's grown tired of running (metaphorically and physically) and returns home to Greenbow.

Back in 1981, Forrest reveals that he is waiting at the bus stop because he received a letter from Jenny, who asked him to visit her. As Forrest is finally reunited with Jenny, she introduces him to their son, named Forrest Gump, Jr. Jenny tells Forrest she is sick with an incurable disease ([[Hepatitis C]]) and the three move back to Greenbow. Jenny and Forrest finally marry, but she dies a year later. The film ends with Forrest seeing his son off on his first day of school.

**[[Michael Conner Humphreys]] as young Forrest Gump: Hanks revealed in interviews that instead of having Michael copy his accent, he copied Michael's unique accented drawl into the older character's accent. 
* [[Robin Wright]] as Jenny Curran: Forrest's childhood friend with whom he immediately falls in love, and never stops loving throughout his life. A victim of [[child sexual abuse]] at the hands of her bitterly widowed father, Jenny embarks on a different path from Forrest, leading a self-destructive life and becoming part of the [[hippie]] movement in California in the 1960s and the following decade's sex and drug culture of the 1970s. She re-enters Forrest's life at various times in adulthood. Jenny eventually becomes a waitress in Savannah, Georgia, where she lives in an apartment with her (and Forrest's) son, Forrest Jr. They eventually get married, but soon afterward she dies from complications due to an unnamed disease (presumed to be [[hepatitis C]], according to Winston Groom, author of the original Forrest Gump novel).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.factinate.com/things/50-facts-forrest-gump-momma-didnt-tell/2/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://newravel.com/uncategorized/forrest-gump-facts/&lt;/ref&gt;

After losing his legs in an ambush and being rescued against his will by Forrest, he is initially bitter and antagonistic towards Forrest for leaving him a &quot;cripple&quot; and denying him his family's destiny, falling into a deep depression. He later serves as Forrest's first mate at the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, gives most of the orders, becoming wealthy with Forrest, and regains his will to live. He ultimately forgives and thanks Forrest for saving his life. By the end of the film, he is engaged to be married and is sporting &quot;magic legs&quot; – [[Titanium Beta C|titanium alloy]] [[prosthesis|prosthetics]] that allow him to walk again. [[Joe Pesci]] was considered for the role.
* [[Mykelti Williamson]] as Benjamin Buford &quot;Bubba&quot; Blue: Bubba was originally supposed to be the senior partner in the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, but due to his death in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], their platoon leader, Dan Taylor, took his place.

=== Script ===
{{Main|Forrest Gump (novel)}}

{{Quote box |width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|quote=&quot;The writer, Eric Roth, departed substantially from the book. We flipped the two elements of the book, making the love story primary and the fantastic adventures secondary. Also, the book was cynical and colder than the movie. In the movie, Gump is a completely decent character, always true to his word.

The film is based on the 1986 [[Forrest Gump (novel)|novel]] by [[Winston Groom]]. Both center on the character of Forrest Gump. However, the film primarily focuses on the first eleven chapters of the novel, before skipping ahead to the end of the novel with the founding of Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. and the meeting with Forrest, Jr. In addition to skipping some parts of the novel, the film adds several aspects to Gump's life that do not occur in the novel, such as his needing leg braces as a child and his run across the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;MoviesBook&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Delarte|first=Alonso |title=Movies By The Book: Forrest Gump|work=Bob's Poetry Magazine|date=February 2004|url=http://bobspoetry.com/Bobs01Fe.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327090919/http://bobspoetry.com/Bobs01Fe.pdf |archivedate=March 27, 2009|page=24|accessdate=July 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gump's core character and personality are also changed from the novel; among other things his film character is less of a [[Savant syndrome|savant]]—in the novel, while playing football at the university, he fails craft and gym, but receives a perfect score in an advanced physics class he is enrolled in by his coach to satisfy his college requirements.&lt;ref name=&quot;MoviesBook&quot; /&gt; The novel also features Gump as an [[astronaut]], a [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], and a [[chess]] player.&lt;ref name=&quot;MoviesBook&quot; /&gt;

===Power===
Incandescent lamps are nearly pure resistive loads with a [[power factor]] of 1. Unlike discharge lamps or LED lamps, the power consumed is equal to the [[apparent power]] in the circuit. Incandescent light bulbs are usually [[marketing|marketed]] according to the [[electric power|electrical power]] consumed.  This depends mainly on the operating [[electrical resistance|resistance]] of the filament. For two bulbs of the same voltage, and type, the higher-powered bulb gives more light.

The table shows the approximate typical output, in [[Lumen (unit)|lumens]], of standard 120 volt incandescent light bulbs at various powers. Light output of similar 230&amp;nbsp;V bulbs is slightly less. The lower current (higher voltage) filament is thinner and has to be operated at a slightly lower temperature for the same life expectancy, which reduces energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://donklipstein.com/lfunfact.html|title=Light and Lighting Fun Facts|work=donklipstein.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720233038/http://donklipstein.com/lfunfact.html|archivedate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lumen values for &quot;soft white&quot; bulbs will generally be slightly lower than for clear bulbs at the same power.

===Current and resistance===
The resistance of the filament is temperature dependent. The cold resistance of tungsten-filament lamps is about 1/15 the resistance when operating. For example, a 100-watt, 120-volt lamp has a resistance of 144 [[ohm]]s when lit, but the cold resistance is much lower (about 9.5 ohms).&lt;ref name=&quot;GETP110&quot; /&gt;{{efn|1=Edison's research team was aware of the large negative [[temperature coefficient of resistance]] of possible lamp filament materials and worked extensively during the period 1878–1879 on devising an automatic regulator or ''ballast'' to stabilize current. It wasn't until 1879 that it was realized a self-limiting lamp could be built. See {{cite book |ref=harv |last1=Friedel |first1=Robert |last2=Israel |first2=Paul |year=2010 |name-list-style=amp |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8U-Naf4DuzMC&amp;pg=PA26 |title=Edison's Electric Light: The Art of Invention |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |edition=Revised |isbn=978-0-8018-9482-4 |pages=29–31 |access-date=2018-07-03 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206142310/https://books.google.com/books?id=8U-Naf4DuzMC&amp;pg=PA7 |archive-date=2017-12-06}}}} Since incandescent lamps are resistive loads, simple phase-control [[TRIAC]] [[dimmer]]s can be used to control brightness. Electrical contacts may carry a &quot;T&quot; rating symbol indicating that they are designed to control circuits with the high inrush current characteristic of tungsten lamps. For a 100-watt, 120-volt general-service lamp, the current stabilizes in about 0.10 seconds, and the lamp reaches 90% of its full brightness after about 0.13 seconds.{{sfnp|Friedel|Israel|2010|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8U-Naf4DuzMC&amp;pg=PA22 22–23]}}

==Physical characteristics==
===Security===
The filament in a tungsten light bulb is not easy to break when the bulb is cold, but filaments are more vulnerable when they are hot because the incandescent metal is less rigid. An impact on the outside of the bulb may cause the filament to break or experience a surge in [[electric current]] that causes part of it to melt or vaporize.
In most modern incandescent bulbs, part of the wire inside the bulb acts like a [[fuse (electrical)|fuse]]: if a broken filament produces an [[electrical short]] inside the bulb, the fusible section of wire will melt and cut the current off to prevent damage to the supply lines.

A hot glass bulb may fracture on contact with cold objects. When the glass envelope breaks, the bulb [[implosion (mechanical process)|implodes]], exposing the filament to ambient air. The air then usually destroys the hot filament through [[oxidation]].

===Bulb shapes ===
[[File:incandescent bulb shapes.svg|thumb|upright=2|Incandescent light bulbs come in a range of shapes and sizes.]]
Bulb shape and size designations are given in national standards.   
Some designations are one or more letters followed by one or more numbers, e.g. A55 or PAR38, where the letters identify the shape and the numbers some characteristic size.

National standards such as [[ANSI]] C79.1-2002, [[Indian Standard|IS]] 14897:2000&lt;ref name=&quot;IS 14897:2000&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=IS 14897 (2000): Glass Bulb Designation System for Lamps — Guide |publisher=Bureau of Indian Standards |location=New Delhi |url=https://archive.org/details/gov.in.is.14897.2000 |access-date=2018-07-03 |pages=1, 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Japanese Industrial Standards|JIS]] C 7710:1988&lt;ref name=&quot;JIS C 7710:1988&quot;&gt;{{cite web |script-title=ja:JIS C 7710:1988 電球類ガラス管球の形式の表し方|url=http://kikakurui.com/c7/C7710-1988-01.html |accessdate=2017-03-21 |language=ja |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111224419/http://kikakurui.com/c7/C7710-1988-01.html |archivedate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; cover a common terminology for bulb shapes.

===Lamp bases===
{{Main|Lightbulb socket}}

[[File:BCincandescentlamp.jpg|upright|thumb|The double-contact bayonet cap on an incandescent bulb]]
Large lamps may have a [[Edison screw|screw base]] or a [[Bayonet mount|bayonet base]], with one or more contacts on the base. The shell may serve as an electrical contact or only as a mechanical support.  Bayonet base lamps are frequently used in [[Automotive lamp types|automotive lamps]] to resist loosening by vibration. Some tubular lamps have an electrical contact at either end. Miniature lamps may have a [[wedge base]] and wire contacts, and some automotive and special purpose lamps have screw terminals for connection to wires.  Very small lamps may have the filament support wires extended through the base of the lamp for connections.  A [[bipin]] base is often used for halogen or reflector lamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Single-Ended Halogen Bases |url=http://www.bulbster.com/lightbulbs/singleended-halogen-c-783_43230.html |publisher=Bulbster.com |accessdate=17 June 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919152653/http://bulbster.com/lightbulbs/singleended-halogen-c-783_43230.html |archivedate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, manufacturers introduced a multitude of incompatible lamp bases. [[General Electric]]'s &quot;[[Mazda (light bulb)|Mazda]]&quot; standard base sizes were soon adopted across the US.

Lamp bases may be secured to the bulb with a cement, or by mechanical crimping to indentations molded into the glass bulb.

Lamps intended for use in optical systems have bases with alignment features so that the filament is positioned accurately within the optical system. A screw-base lamp may have a random orientation of the filament when the lamp is installed in the socket.

Contacts in the [[lightbulb socket]] allow the electric current to pass through the base to the filament. The socket provides electrical connections and mechanical support, and allows changing the lamp when it burns out.

==Light output and lifetime==
{{See also|Lamp rerating}}
Incandescent lamps are very sensitive to changes in the supply voltage. These characteristics are of great practical and economic importance.

For a supply voltage ''V'' near the rated voltage of the lamp:

* ''Light'' output is approximately proportional to ''V''&lt;sup&gt; 3.4&lt;/sup&gt;
* ''Power'' consumption is approximately proportional to ''V''&lt;sup&gt; 1.6&lt;/sup&gt;
* ''Lifetime'' is approximately proportional to ''V''&lt;sup&gt; −16&lt;/sup&gt;
* ''Color temperature'' is approximately proportional to ''V''&lt;sup&gt; 0.42&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald G. Fink]] and H. Wayne Beaty, ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers, Eleventh Edition'', McGraw-Hill, New York, 1978, {{ISBN|0-07-020974-X}}, pg 22–8&lt;/ref&gt;

A 5% reduction in voltage will double the life of the bulb, but reduce its light output by about 16%. Long-life bulbs take advantage of this trade-off in applications such as traffic signal lamps. Since electric energy they use costs more than the cost of the bulb, general service lamps emphasize efficiency over long operating life. The objective is to minimize the cost of light, not the cost of lamps.&lt;ref name=&quot;GETP110&quot; /&gt; Early bulbs had a life of up to 2500 hours, but in 1924 a [[Phoebus cartel|cartel]] agreed to limit life to 1000 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Great Lightbulb Conspiracy |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/history/the-great-lightbulb-conspiracy |work=IEEE Spectrum |publisher=IEEE |first=Markus |last=Krajewski |date=24 September 2014|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106040631/https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/history/the-great-lightbulb-conspiracy |archivedate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this was exposed in 1953, General Electric and other leading American manufacturers were banned from limiting the life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_17287091|title=Tests shine light on the secret of the Livermore light bulb|date=6 February 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310100846/http://www.mercurynews.com//ci_17287091|archivedate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationships above are valid for only a few percent change of voltage around standard rated conditions, but they indicate that a lamp operated at low voltage could last much longer than at rated voltage, albeit with greatly reduced light output. The &quot;[[Centennial Light]]&quot; is a light bulb that is accepted by the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as having been burning almost continuously at a [[fire station]] in [[Livermore, California]], since 1901. However, the bulb emits the equivalent light of a four watt bulb. A similar story can be told of a 40-watt bulb in Texas that has been illuminated since 21 September 1908. It once resided in an [[opera house]] where notable celebrities stopped to take in its glow, and was moved to an area museum in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homelighting.com/article.cfm?intarticleID=880 |title=Watts Up? – A parting look at lighting|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207211654/http://www.homelighting.com/article.cfm?intarticleID=880 |archivedate=7 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flood lamps used for photographic lighting favor light output over life, with some lasting only two hours. The upper temperature limit for the filament is the melting point of the metal. Tungsten is the metal with the highest melting point, {{convert|3695|K|°C °F}}. A 50-hour-life projection bulb, for instance, is designed to operate only {{convert|50|°C|°F}} below that melting point. Such a lamp may achieve up to 22 lumens per watt, compared with 17.5 for a 750-hour general service lamp.&lt;ref name=&quot;GETP110&quot; /&gt;

Lamps of the same power rating but designed for different voltages have different luminous efficacy. For example, a 100-watt, 1000 hour, 120-volt lamp will produce about 17.1 lumens per watt. A similar lamp designed for 230&amp;nbsp;V would produce only around 12.8 lumens per watt, and one designed for 30 volts (train lighting) would produce as much as 19.8 lumens per watt.&lt;ref name=&quot;GETP110&quot; /&gt; Lower voltage lamps have a thicker filament, for the same power rating. They can run hotter for the same lifetime before the filament evaporates.

The wires used to support the filament make it mechanically stronger, but remove heat, creating another tradeoff between efficiency and long life. Many general-service 120-volt lamps use no additional support wires, but lamps designed for &quot;[[rough service]]&quot; or &quot;vibration service&quot; may have as many as five. Low-voltage lamps have filaments made of heavier wire and do not require additional support wires.

Very low voltages are inefficient since the lead wires would conduct too much heat away from the filament, so the practical lower limit for incandescent lamps is 1.5 volts. Very long filaments for high voltages are fragile, and lamp bases become more difficult to insulate, so lamps for illumination are not made with rated voltages over 300 volts.&lt;ref name=&quot;GETP110&quot; /&gt; Some infrared heating elements are made for higher voltages, but these use tubular bulbs with widely separated terminals.

[[File:InnerSolarSystem-en.png|thumb]]
A '''minor-planet group''' is a population of [[minor planet]]s that share broadly similar orbits. Members are generally unrelated to each other, unlike in an [[asteroid family]], which often results from the break-up of a single asteroid. It is customary to name a group of asteroids after the first member of that group to be discovered, which is often the largest.

== Groups out to the orbit of Earth ==

There are relatively few asteroids that orbit close to the Sun. Several of these groups are hypothetical at this point in time, with no members having yet been discovered; as such, the names they have been given are provisional.
* [[Vulcanoid asteroid]]s are hypothetical asteroids that orbit entirely within the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] (have an [[aphelion]] of less than 0.3874&amp;nbsp;AU). A few searches for vulcanoids have been conducted but none have been discovered so far.
* [[Atira asteroid]]s (Apohele; Interior-Earth Objects) are a small group of known asteroids whose aphelion is less than 0.983&amp;nbsp;AU, meaning they orbit entirely within Earth's orbit. The group is named after its first confirmed member, [[163693&amp;nbsp;Atira]]. {{As of|2020}}, the group consists of 22 members, 6 of which are numbered.&lt;ref name=&quot;jpl-search-by-smallest-aphelion&quot; /&gt;
* [[List of Mercury-crossing minor planets|Mercury-crosser asteroid]]s having a [[perihelion]] smaller than Mercury's 0.3075&amp;nbsp;AU.
* [[List of Venus-crossing minor planets|Venus-crosser asteroid]]s having a perihelion smaller than [[Venus]]'s 0.7184&amp;nbsp;AU. This group includes the above Mercury-crossers (if their aphelion is greater than Venus's perihelion. All known Mercury crossers satisfy this condition except 2020 AV2, which has an aphelion smaller than Venus's perihelion and a perihelion slightly smaller than Mercury's aphelion).
* [[List of Earth-crossing minor planets|Earth-crosser asteroid]]s having a perihelion smaller than [[Earth]]'s 0.9833&amp;nbsp;AU. This group includes the above Mercury- and Venus-crossers, apart from the Apoheles. They are also divided into the
** [[Aten asteroid]]s having a [[semi-major axis]] less than 1&amp;nbsp;AU, named after [[2062&amp;nbsp;Aten]].
** [[Apollo asteroid]]s having a [[semi-major axis]] greater than 1&amp;nbsp;AU, named after [[1862&amp;nbsp;Apollo]].
* [[Arjuna asteroid]]s are somewhat vaguely defined as having orbits similar to Earth's; i.e. with an average orbital radius of around 1&amp;nbsp;AU and with low eccentricity and inclination.&lt;ref name=geo /&gt; Due to the vagueness of this definition some asteroids belonging to the [[Atira asteroid|Atira]], [[Amor asteroid|Amor]], [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo]] or [[Aten asteroid|Aten]] groups can also be classified as Arjunas. The term was introduced by [[Spacewatch]] and does not refer to an existing asteroid; examples of Arjunas include [[1991&amp;nbsp;VG]].
* [[Earth trojan]]s are asteroids located in the Earth–Sun [[Lagrangian point]]s {{L4}} and {{L5}}. Their location in the sky as observed from Earth's surface would be fixed at about 60 degrees east and west of the Sun, and as people tend to search for asteroids at much greater elongations few searches have been done in these locations. The only known Earth trojan is {{mpl|2010 TK|7}}.
* [[Near-Earth asteroid]]s is a catch-all term for asteroids whose orbit closely approaches that of Earth. It includes almost all of the above groups, as well as the [[Amor asteroid]]s.

== Groups out to the orbit of Mars ==

Of the reign of the last Babylonian king, [[Nabonidus]] (''Nabu-na'id'', 556–539 BC) who is the son of the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] priestess [[Addagoppe of Harran|Adda-Guppi]] and who managed to kill the last Chaldean king, Labashi-Marduk, and took the reign, there is a fair amount of information available. Nabonidus (hence his son, the regent [[Belshazzar]]) was, at least from the mother's side, neither Chaldean nor Babylonian, but ironically Assyrian, hailing from its final capital of [[Harran]] (Kharranu). His father's origins remain unknown. Information regarding Nabonidus is chiefly derived from a chronological tablet containing the annals of Nabonidus, supplemented by another inscription of Nabonidus where he recounts his restoration of the temple of the Moon-god [[Sin]] at Harran; as well as by a proclamation of Cyrus issued shortly after his formal recognition as king of Babylonia.{{sfn|Sayce|1911|p=105}}

A number of factors arose which would ultimately lead to the fall of Babylon. The population of Babylonia became restive and increasingly disaffected under Nabonidus. He excited a strong feeling against himself by attempting to centralize the polytheistic religion of Babylonia in the temple of Marduk at Babylon, and while he had thus alienated the local priesthoods, the military party also despised him on account of his antiquarian tastes. He seemed to have left the defense of his kingdom to his son [[Belshazzar]] (a capable soldier but poor diplomat who alienated the political elite), occupying himself with the more congenial work of excavating the foundation records of the temples and determining the dates of their builders.{{sfn|Sayce|1911|p=105}} He also spent time outside Babylonia, rebuilding temples in the Assyrian city of Harran, and also among his Arab subjects in the deserts to the south of Mesopotamia. Nabonidus and Belshazzar's Assyrian heritage is also likely to have added to this resentment. In addition, Mesopotamian military might had usually been concentrated in the martial state of Assyria. Babylonia had always been more vulnerable to conquest and invasion than its northern neighbour, and without the might of Assyria to keep foreign powers in check and Mesopotamia dominant, Babylonia was ultimately exposed.

It was in the sixth year of Nabonidus (549 BC) that [[Cyrus the Great]], the Achaemenid Persian &quot;king of [[Anshan (Persia)|Anshan]]&quot; in Elam, revolted against his suzerain [[Astyages]], &quot;king of the Manda&quot; or Medes, at [[Ecbatana]]. Astyages' army betrayed him to his enemy, and Cyrus established himself at Ecbatana, thus putting an end to the empire of the Medes and making the Persian faction dominant among the Iranic peoples.{{sfn|Sayce|1911|pp=105–106}} Three years later Cyrus had become king of all Persia, and was engaged in a campaign to put down a revolt among the Assyrians. Meanwhile, Nabonidus had established a camp in the desert of his colony of Arabia, near the southern frontier of his kingdom, leaving his son [[Belshazzar]] (''Belsharutsur'') in command of the army.

In 539 BC Cyrus invaded Babylonia. A battle was fought at [[Opis]] in the month of June, where the Babylonians were defeated; and immediately afterwards Sippar surrendered to the invader. Nabonidus fled to Babylon, where he was pursued by [[Gobryas]], and on the 16th day of [[Tammuz (Babylonian calendar)|Tammuz]], two days after the capture of Sippar, &quot;the soldiers of Cyrus entered Babylon without fighting.&quot; Nabonidus was dragged from his hiding place, where the services continued without interruption. Cyrus did not arrive until the 3rd of ''Marchesvan'' (October), Gobryas having acted for him in his absence. Gobryas was now made governor of the province of Babylon, and a few days afterwards Belshazzar the son of Nabonidus died in battle. A public mourning followed, lasting six days, and Cyrus' son [[Cambyses]] accompanied the corpse to the tomb.{{sfn|Sayce|1911|p=106}}

One of the first acts of Cyrus accordingly was to allow the Jewish exiles to return to their own homes, carrying with them their sacred temple vessels. The permission to do so was embodied in a proclamation, whereby the conqueror endeavored to justify his claim to the Babylonian throne.{{sfn|Sayce|1911|p=106}}

Cyrus now claimed to be the legitimate successor of the ancient Babylonian kings and the avenger of [[Bel-Marduk]], who was assumed to be wrathful at the impiety of Nabonidus in removing the images of the local gods from their ancestral shrines to his capital Babylon.{{sfn|Sayce|1911|p=106}}

The Chaldean tribe had lost control of Babylonia decades before the end of the era that sometimes bears their name, and they appear to have blended into the general populace of Babylonia even before this (for example, Nabopolassar, Nebuchadnezzar II and their successors always referred to themselves as ''Shar Akkad'' and never as ''Shar Kaldu'' on inscriptions), and during the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]] the term ''Chaldean'' ceased to refer to a race of people, and instead specifically to a social class of priests educated in classical Babylonian literature, particularly Astronomy and Astrology. By the mid [[Seleucid Empire]] (312–150 BC) period this term too had fallen from use.

Babylonia was absorbed into the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 539 BC.

A year before Cyrus' death, in 529 BC, he elevated his son [[Cambyses II]] in the government, making him king of Babylon, while he reserved for himself the fuller title of &quot;king of the (other) provinces&quot; of the empire. It was only when [[Darius I]] acquired the Persian throne and ruled it as a representative of the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian religion]], that the old tradition was broken and the claim of Babylon to confer legitimacy on the rulers of western Asia ceased to be acknowledged.{{sfn|Sayce|1911|p=106}}

Immediately after Darius seized Persia, Babylonia briefly recovered its independence under a native ruler, [[Nidinta-Bel]], who took the name of [[Nebuchadnezzar III]], and reigned from October 522 BC to August 520 BC, when Darius took the city by storm, during this period Assyria to the north also rebelled. A few years later, probably 514 BC, Babylon again revolted under the [[Armenians|Armenian]] king [[Nebuchadnezzar IV]]; on this occasion, after its capture by the Persians, the walls were partly destroyed. The [[Esagila]], the great temple of [[Bel (mythology)|Bel]], however, still continued to be kept in repair and to be a center of Babylonian religious feelings.{{sfn|Sayce|1911|p=106}}

[[Alexander the Great]] conquered Babylon in 333 BC for the [[ancient Greece|Greeks]], and died there in 323 BC. Babylonia and Assyria then became part of the Greek [[Seleucid Empire]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
It has long been maintained that the foundation of [[Seleucia]] diverted the population to the new capital of southern Mesopotamia, and that the ruins of the old city became a quarry for the builders of the new seat of government,{{sfn|Sayce|1911|p=106}} but the recent publication of the ''[[Babylonian Chronicles]]'' has shown that urban life was still very much the same well into the [[Parthian Empire]] (150 BC to 226 AD). The Parthian king [[Mithridates I of Parthia|Mithridates]] conquered the region into the Parthian Empire in 150 BC, and the region became something of a battleground between Greeks and Parthians.

There was a brief interlude of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] conquest (the provinces of [[Assyria (Roman province)|Assyria]] and [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamia]]; 116–118 AD) under [[Trajan]], after which the Parthians reasserted control.

The [[satrap]]y of Babylonia was absorbed into [[Asōristān]] (meaning ''The land of the Assyrians'' in [[Persian language|Persian]]) in the [[Sasanian Empire]], which began in 226 AD, and by this time [[East Syriac Rite]] [[Syriac Christianity]] (which emerged in Assyria and Upper Mesopotamia the first century AD) had become the dominant religion among the native [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]]-[[Babylon]]ian populace, who had never adopted the [[Zoroastrianism]] or [[Hellenistic religion|Hellenic religions]] and languages of their rulers.

Apart from the small 2nd century BC to 3rd century AD independent [[Neo-Assyrian]] states of [[Adiabene]], [[Osroene]], [[Assur]], [[Beth Garmai]], [[Beth Nuhadra]] and [[Hatra]] in the north, Mesopotamia remained under largely Persian control until the [[Arab]] [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] in the seventh century AD. Asōristān was dissolved as a geopolitical entity in 637 AD, and the native [[Eastern Aramaic]]-speaking and largely Christian populace of southern and central Mesopotamia (with the exception of the [[Mandeans]]) gradually underwent [[Arabization]] and [[Islamization]] in contrast to northern Mesopotamia where an [[Assyrian continuity]] endures to the present day.

==Culture==
Bronze Age to Early Iron Age Mesopotamian culture is sometimes summarized as &quot;Assyro-Babylonian&quot;, because of the close ethnic, linguistic and cultural interdependence of the two political centers. The term &quot;Babylonia&quot;, especially in writings from around the early 20th century, was formerly used to also include Southern Mesopotamia's earliest ''pre-Babylonian'' history, and not only in reference to the later city-state of Babylon proper. This geographic usage of the name &quot;Babylonia&quot; has generally been replaced by the more accurate term ''Sumer'' or ''Sumero-Akkadian'' in more recent writing, referring to the pre-Assyro-Babylonian Mesopotamian civilization.

In Babylonia, an abundance of [[clay]], and lack of [[Rock (geology)|stone]], led to greater use of [[mudbrick]]; Babylonian, Sumerian and Assyrian temples were massive structures of crude brick which were supported by [[buttress]]es, the rain being carried off by drains. One such drain at [[Ur]] was made of [[lead]]. The use of brick led to the early development of the [[pilaster]] and column, and of [[fresco]]es and enameled tiles. The walls were brilliantly coloured, and sometimes plated with [[zinc]] or [[gold]], as well as with [[tile]]s. Painted [[terracotta]] cones for torches were also embedded in the plaster. In Babylonia, in place of the [[relief]], there was greater use of three-dimensional figures—the earliest examples being the [[Statues of Gudea]], that are realistic if somewhat clumsy. The paucity of stone in Babylonia made every pebble precious, and led to a high perfection in the art of gem-cutting.{{sfn|Sayce|1911|p=108}}

====Astronomy====
{{Main| Babylonian astronomy}}
Tablets dating back to the [[First Babylonian dynasty|Old Babylonian period]] document the application of mathematics to the variation in the length of daylight over a solar year. Centuries of Babylonian observations of celestial phenomena are recorded in the series of [[cuneiform script]] tablets known as the 'Enūma Anu Enlil'. The oldest significant astronomical text that we possess is Tablet 63 of 'Enūma Anu Enlil', the Venus tablet of Ammi-Saduqa, which lists the first and last visible risings of Venus over a period of about 21 years and is the earliest evidence that the phenomena of a planet were recognized as periodic. The oldest rectangular [[astrolabe]] dates back to Babylonia c. 1100 BC. The [[MUL.APIN]], contains catalogues of stars and constellations as well as schemes for predicting [[heliacal rising]]s and the settings of the planets, lengths of daylight measured by a [[water clock]], [[gnomon]], shadows, and [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalations]]. The Babylonian GU text arranges stars in 'strings' that lie along declination circles and thus measure right-ascensions or time-intervals, and also employs the stars of the zenith, which are also separated by given right-ascensional differences.&lt;ref name=pingree&gt;{{Citation | last=Pingree | first=David | author-link=David Pingree | year=1998 | contribution=Legacies in Astronomy and Celestial Omens | editor-last=Dalley | editor-first=Stephanie | editor-link= Stephanie Dalley | title=The Legacy of Mesopotamia | publisher=Oxford University Press | pages=125–137 | isbn =978-0-19-814946-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Rochberg | first=Francesca | year=2004 | title=The Heavenly Writing: Divination, Horoscopy, and Astronomy in Mesopotamian Culture | publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=practice&gt;{{cite book|title=The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy|first=James|last=Evans|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|pages=296–297|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nS51_7qbEWsC&amp;q=babylon+greek+astronomy&amp;pg=PA17

Biggs |journal=Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies |volume=19 |number=1 |year=2005 |pages=7–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most extensive Babylonian medical text, however, is the ''Diagnostic Handbook'' written by the ''ummânū'', or chief scholar, [[Esagil-kin-apli]] of [[Borsippa]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Stol-99&quot;/&gt; during the reign of the Babylonian king [[Adad-apla-iddina]] (1069–1046 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Marten Stol (1993), ''Epilepsy in Babylonia'', p. 55, [[Brill Publishers]], {{ISBN|90-72371-63-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with contemporary [[ancient Egyptian medicine]], the Babylonians introduced the concepts of [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]], [[prognosis]], [[physical examination]], and [[medical prescription|prescriptions]]. In addition, the ''Diagnostic Handbook'' introduced the methods of [[therapy]] and [[aetiology]] and the use of [[empiricism]], [[logic]] and [[rationality]] in diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. The text contains a list of medical [[symptom]]s and often detailed empirical [[observation]]s along with logical rules used in combining observed symptoms on the body of a [[patient]] with its diagnosis and prognosis.&lt;ref&gt;H.

The symptoms and diseases of a patient were treated through therapeutic means such as [[bandage]]s, [[Cream (pharmaceutical)|creams]] and [[pill (pharmacy)|pills]]. If a patient could not be cured physically, the Babylonian physicians often relied on [[exorcism]] to cleanse the patient from any [[curse]]s. Esagil-kin-apli's ''Diagnostic Handbook'' was based on a logical set of [[axiom]]s and assumptions, including the modern view that through the examination and inspection of the symptoms of a patient, it is possible to determine the patient's [[disease]], its aetiology and future development, and the chances of the patient's recovery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stol-99&quot;&gt;H.

Esagil-kin-apli discovered a variety of illnesses and diseases and described their symptoms in his ''Diagnostic Handbook''. These include the symptoms for many varieties of [[epilepsy]] and related ailments along with their diagnosis and prognosis.&lt;ref&gt;Marten Stol (1993), ''Epilepsy in Babylonia'', p. 5, [[Brill Publishers]], {{ISBN|90-72371-63-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later Babylonian medicine resembles early [[Ancient Greek medicine|Greek medicine]] in many ways.

====Literature====
{{Main|Akkadian literature}}
There were libraries in most towns and temples; an old Sumerian proverb averred that &quot;he who would excel in the school of the scribes must rise with the dawn&quot;. Women as well as men learned to read and write,{{sfn|Sayce|1911|p=107}}&lt;ref&gt;Tatlow, Elisabeth Meier ''Women, Crime, and Punishment in Ancient Law and Society: The Ancient Near East'' Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd.

A considerable amount of Babylonian literature was translated from Sumerian originals, and the language of religion and law long continued to be written in the old agglutinative language of Sumer. Vocabularies, grammars, and interlinear translations were compiled for the use of students, as well as commentaries on the older texts and explanations of obscure words and phrases. The characters of the syllabary were all arranged and named, and elaborate lists of them were drawn up.{{sfn|Sayce|1911|p=107}}

There are many Babylonian literary works whose titles have come down to us. One of the most famous of these was the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], in twelve books, translated from the original Sumerian by a certain Sin-liqi-unninni, and arranged upon an astronomical principle. Each division contains the story of a single adventure in the career of [[Gilgamesh]]. The whole story is a composite product, and it is probable that some of the stories are artificially attached to the central figure.{{sfn|Sayce|1911|p=107}}

===Neo-Babylonian culture===
The brief resurgence of Babylonian culture in the 7th to 6th centuries BC was accompanied by a number of important cultural developments.

====Astronomy====
{{Main|Babylonian astronomy|Chronology of the ancient Near East}}
Among the sciences, [[astronomy]] and [[astrology]] still occupied a conspicuous place in Babylonian society. Astronomy was of old standing in Babylonia. The [[zodiac]] was a Babylonian invention of great antiquity; and [[eclipse]]s of the [[sun]] and [[moon]] could be foretold.{{sfn|Sayce|1911|p=107}} There are dozens of cuneiform records of original Mesopotamian eclipse observations.

Babylonian astronomy was the basis for much of what was done in [[ancient Greek astronomy]], in classical , in Sasanian, [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and Syrian astronomy, [[astronomy in the medieval Islamic world]], and in [[Central Asia]]n and [[Western Europe]]an astronomy.{{sfn|Sayce|1911|p=107}}&lt;ref name=pingree /&gt;
Neo-Babylonian astronomy can thus be considered the direct predecessor of much of ancient [[Greek mathematics]] and astronomy, which in turn is the historical predecessor of the European (Western) [[scientific revolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Aaboe, Asger&quot;&gt;Aaboe, Asger. &quot;The culture of Babylonia: Babylonian mathematics, astrology, and astronomy&quot;.

Walker. Cambridge University Press,  (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 8th and 7th centuries BC, Babylonian astronomers developed a new approach to astronomy. They began studying [[philosophy]] dealing with the ideal nature of the early [[universe]] and began employing an [[consistency|internal logic]] within their predictive planetary systems. This was an important contribution to astronomy and the [[philosophy of science]] and some scholars have thus referred to this new approach as the first scientific revolution.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;D. Brown (2000), ''Mesopotamian Planetary Astronomy-Astrology'', Styx Publications, {{ISBN|90-5693-036-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This new approach to astronomy was adopted and further developed in Greek and Hellenistic astronomy.

In [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] and Parthian times, the astronomical reports were of a thoroughly scientific character;{{sfn|Sayce|1911|p=107}} how much earlier their advanced knowledge and methods were developed is uncertain. The Babylonian development of methods for predicting the motions of the planets is considered to be a major episode in the [[Assyrian astronomy|history of astronomy]].

The only Babylonian astronomer known to have supported a [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model of planetary motion was [[Seleucus of Seleucia]] (b. 190 BC).&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto E. Neugebauer]] (1945). &quot;The History of Ancient Astronomy Problems and Methods&quot;, ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'' '''4''' (1), pp. 1–38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Sarton]] (1955). &quot;Chaldaean Astronomy of the Last Three Centuries B.C.&quot;, ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''75''' (3), pp. 166–173 [169].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William P. D. Wightman (1951, 1953), ''The Growth of Scientific Ideas'', Yale University Press p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Seleucus is known from the writings of [[Plutarch]]. He supported the heliocentric theory where the [[Earth's rotation|Earth rotated]] around its own axis which in turn revolved around the [[Sun]]. According to [[Plutarch]], Seleucus even proved the heliocentric system, but it is not known what arguments he used.

====Mathematics====
{{Main|Babylonian mathematics}}
Babylonian mathematical texts are plentiful and well edited.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aaboe, Asger&quot; /&gt; In respect of time they fall in two distinct groups: one from the [[First Babylonian dynasty]] period (1830–1531 BC), the other mainly [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] from the last three or four centuries BC. In respect of content there is scarcely any difference between the two groups of texts. Thus Babylonian mathematics remained stale in character and content, with very little progress or innovation,  for nearly two millennia.{{Dubious|date=April 2010}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Aaboe, Asger&quot; /&gt;

The Babylonian system of mathematics was [[sexagesimal]], or a base 60 [[Babylonian numerals|numeral system]]. From this we derive the modern-day usage of 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 360 (60 × 6) degrees in a circle. The Babylonians were able to make great advances in mathematics for two reasons. First, the number 60 has many [[divisor]]s (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, and 30), making calculations easier. Additionally, unlike the Egyptians and Romans, the Babylonians had a true place-value system, where digits written in the left column represented larger values (much as in our base-ten system: 734 = 7×100 + 3×10 + 4×1). Among the Babylonians' mathematical accomplishments were the determination of the [[square root of two]] correctly to seven places ([[YBC 7289]]). They also demonstrated knowledge of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] well before Pythagoras, as evidenced by this tablet translated by Dennis Ramsey and dating to c. 1900 BC:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
4 is the length and 5 is the diagonal.
What is the breadth?
Its size is not known.
4 times 4 is 16. And 5 times 5 is 25.
You take 16 from 25 and there remains 9.
What times what shall I take in order to get 9?
3 times 3 is 9. 3 is the breadth.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''ner'' of 600 and the ''sar'' of 3600 were formed from the unit of 60, corresponding with a degree of the [[equator]]. Tablets of squares and cubes, calculated from 1 to 60, have been found at [[Senkera]], and a people acquainted with the sun-dial, the clepsydra, the lever and the pulley, must have had no mean knowledge of mechanics. A [[Lead crystal|crystal]] lens, turned on the [[lathe]], was discovered by [[Austen Henry Layard]] at [[Nimrud]] along with glass vases bearing the name of Sargon; this could explain the excessive minuteness of some of the writing on the Assyrian tablets, and a lens may also have been used in the observation of the heavens.{{sfn|Sayce|1911|pp=107–108}}

The Babylonians might have been familiar with the general rules for measuring the areas. They measured the circumference of a circle as three times the diameter and the area as one-twelfth the square of the circumference, which would be correct if π were estimated as 3. The volume of a cylinder was taken as the product of the base and the height, however, the volume of the frustum of a cone or a square pyramid was incorrectly taken as the product of the height and half the sum of the bases. Also, there was a recent discovery in which a tablet used π as 3 and 1/8. The Babylonians are also known for the Babylonian mile, which was a measure of distance equal to about 11 kilometres (7&amp;nbsp;mi) today. This measurement for distances eventually was converted to a time-mile used for measuring the travel of the Sun, therefore, representing time. (Eves, Chapter 2) The Babylonians used also space time graphs to calculate the velocity of Jupiter. This is an idea that is considered highly modern, traced to the 14th century England and France and anticipating integral calculus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ossendrijver |first1=Mathieu |title=Ancient Babylonian astronomers calculated Jupiter's position from the area under a time-velocity graph |issue=6272 |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6272/482.full |journal=Science |volume=351 |pages=482–484 |language=en |doi=10.1126/science.aad8085 |pmid=26823423 |date=29 January 2016|bibcode=2016Sci...351..482O |s2cid=206644971 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philosophy====
{{Further|Babylonian literature#Philosophy}}
The origins of Babylonian philosophy can be traced back to early Mesopotamian [[wisdom literature]], which embodied certain philosophies of life, particularly [[ethics]], in the forms of [[dialectic]], [[Dialogue|dialog]]s, [[epic poetry]], [[folklore]], [[hymn]]s, [[lyrics]], [[prose]], and [[proverb]]s. Babylonian [[reasoning]] and [[rationality]] developed beyond [[Empiricism|empirical]] observation.&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Buccellati (1981), &quot;Wisdom and Not: The Case of Mesopotamia&quot;, ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''101''' (1), pp. 35–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that Babylonian philosophy had an influence on [[Greek philosophy]], particularly [[Hellenistic philosophy]]. The Babylonian text ''[[Dialogue of Pessimism]]'' contains similarities to the [[agonist]]ic thought of the [[Sophism|sophists]], the [[Heraclitus|Heraclitean]] doctrine of contrasts, and the dialogs of [[Plato]], as well as a precursor to the [[Maieutics|maieutic]] [[Socratic method]] of [[Socrates]].&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Buccellati (1981), &quot;Wisdom and Not: The Case of Mesopotamia&quot;, ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''101''' (1), pp. 35–47 [43].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Milesian school|Milesian]] philosopher [[Thales]] is also known to have studied philosophy in Mesopotamia.

==Legacy==
Babylonia, and particularly its capital city Babylon, has long held a place in the [[Abrahamic religions]] as a symbol of excess and dissolute power. Many references are made to Babylon in the [[Bible]], both literally (historical) and allegorically. The mentions in the [[Tanakh]] tend to be historical or prophetic, while [[New Testament]] apocalyptic references to the [[Whore of Babylon]] are more likely figurative, or cryptic references possibly to pagan Rome, or some other archetype. The legendary [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]] and the [[Tower of Babel]] are seen as symbols of luxurious and arrogant power respectively.

Early Christians sometimes referred to Rome as Babylon: The apostle [[Saint Peter|Peter]] ends his first letter with this advice: &quot;She who is in Babylon [Rome], chosen together with you, sends you her greetings, and so does my son Mark.&quot; ({{bibleverse|1 Peter|5:13|NIV}}).

{{bibleverse|Revelation|14:8}} says: &quot;A second angel followed and said, 'Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great,' which made all the nations drink the maddening wine of her adulteries&quot;. Other examples can be found in {{bibleverse|Revelation|16:19}} and {{bibleverse|Revelation|18:2}}.

Babylon is referred to in Quran in verse 102 of chapter 2 of Surah [[Baqarah]] (The Cow):
{{Quote Quran translation|2|102|And they followed [instead] what the devils had recited during the reign of Solomon. It was not Solomon who disbelieved, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels at Babylon, Harut and Marut. But the two angels do not teach anyone unless they say, &quot;We are a trial, so do not disbelieve [by practicing magic]&quot;. And [yet] they learn from them that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife. But they do not harm anyone through it except by permission of Allah. And the people learn what harms them and does not benefit them. But the Children of Israel certainly knew that whoever purchased the magic would not have in the Hereafter any share. And wretched is that for which they sold themselves, if they only knew.|translator=Sahih International}}

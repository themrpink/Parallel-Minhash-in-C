===Piers Gaveston and sexuality===
[[File:Gaveston Cornwall charter.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Initial from a charter|[[Initial]] from the [[charter]] granting [[Piers Gaveston]] the [[earldom of Cornwall]]]]

During this time, Edward became close to [[Piers Gaveston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaveston was the son of one of the king's household knights whose lands lay adjacent to Gascony, and had himself joined Prince Edward's household in 1300, possibly on Edward I's instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two got on well; Gaveston became a [[squire]] and was soon being referred to as a close companion of Edward, before being knighted by the king during the Feast of the Swans in 1306.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=96–97, 120}}; {{harvnb|Chaplais|1994|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The king then exiled Gaveston to Gascony in 1307 for reasons that remain unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=112; 120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one chronicler, Edward had asked his father to allow him to give Gaveston the County of Ponthieu, and the king responded furiously, pulling his son's hair out in great handfuls, before exiling Gaveston.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official court records, however, show Gaveston being only temporarily exiled, supported by a comfortable stipend; no reason is given for the order, suggesting that it may have been an act aimed at punishing the prince.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=120–123}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The possibility that Edward had a sexual relationship with Gaveston or his later favourites has been extensively discussed by historians, complicated by the paucity of surviving evidence to determine for certain the details of their relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ormrod|2006|p=22}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|John Boswell puts forward one of the most prominent arguments in favour of Edward and Gaveston having been lovers. Jeffrey Hamilton supports that the relationship was sexual, but that it was probably not overtly so. The historian Michael Prestwich is sympathetic to the argument that Edward and Gaveston had entered into a bond of adoptive brotherhood, but with a &quot;sexual element&quot; to both this and Edward's relationship with Despenser; Roy Haines echoes Prestwich's judgements; Miri Rubin argues in favour of their being friends, with a &quot;very intense working relationship&quot;; [[Seymour Phillips]] believes it most likely that Edward regarded Gaveston as his adoptive brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|p=72}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=374}}; {{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=31}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=102}}; {{harvnb|Ormrod|2006|p=23}}; {{harvnb|Hamilton|2010|pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} Homosexuality was fiercely condemned by the Church in 14th-century England, which equated it with [[heresy]], but engaging in sex with another man did not necessarily define an individual's personal identity in the same way that it might in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ormrod|2006|pp=23–25}}; {{harvnb|Prestwich|2006|p=70}}; {{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both men had sexual relationships with their wives, who bore them children; Edward also had an illegitimate son, and may have had an affair with his niece, [[Eleanor de Clare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|2006|p=71}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=101}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary evidence supporting their homosexual relationship comes primarily from an anonymous chronicler in the 1320s who described how Edward &quot;felt such love&quot; for Gaveston that &quot;he entered into a covenant of constancy, and bound himself with him before all other mortals with a bond of indissoluble love, firmly drawn up and fastened with a knot&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first specific suggestion that Edward engaged in sex with men was recorded in 1334, when [[Adam Orleton]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]], was accused of having stated in 1326 that Edward was a &quot;sodomite&quot;, although Orleton defended himself by arguing that he had meant that Edward's advisor, [[Hugh Despenser the Younger]], was a sodomite, rather than the late king.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mortimer|2006|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Meaux Chronicle]] from the 1390s simply notes that Edward gave himself &quot;too much to the vice of sodomy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mortimer|2006|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, Edward and Gaveston may have simply been friends with a close working relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|pp=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary [[chronicler]] comments are vaguely worded; Orleton's allegations were at least in part politically motivated, and are very similar to the highly politicised sodomy allegations made against [[Pope Boniface VIII]] and the [[Knights Templar]] in 1303 and 1308 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mortimer|2006|pp=51–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later accounts by chroniclers of Edward's activities may trace back to Orleton's original allegations, and were certainly adversely coloured by the events at the end of Edward's reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mortimer|2006|p=52}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such historians as Michael Prestwich and Seymour Phillips have argued that the public nature of the English royal court would have made it unlikely that any homosexual affairs would have remained discreet; neither the contemporary Church, Edward's father nor his father-in-law appear to have made any adverse comments about Edward's sexual behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|2006|pp=70–71}}; {{harvnb|Chaplais|1994|p=9}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent theory, proposed by the historian [[Pierre Chaplais]], suggests that Edward and Gaveston entered into a bond of [[blood brother|adoptive brotherhood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=100}}; {{harvnb|Chaplais|1994|pp=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compacts of adoptive brotherhood, in which the participants pledged to support each other in a form of &quot;brotherhood-in-arms&quot;, were not unknown between close male friends in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chaplais|1994|pp=14–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many chroniclers described Edward and Gaveston's relationship as one of brotherhood, and one explicitly noted that Edward had taken Gaveston as his adopted brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaplais argues that the pair may have made a formal compact in either 1300 or 1301, and that they would have seen any later promises they made to separate or to leave each other as having been made under duress, and therefore invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chaplais|1994|pp=20–22.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early reign (1307–1311)==

===Coronation and marriage===
[[File:Edward II - British Library Royal 20 A ii f10 (detail).jpg|thumb|alt=Picture of Edward II being crowned|Edward II shown receiving the English crown in a contemporary illustration]]
Edward I mobilised another army for the Scottish campaign in 1307, which Prince Edward was due to join that summer, but the elderly king had been increasingly unwell and died on 7 July at [[Burgh by Sands]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Phillips 2011 123&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward travelled from London immediately after the news reached him, and on 20 July he was proclaimed king.&lt;ref name=Phillips2011PP125/&gt; He continued north into Scotland and on 4 August received homage from his Scottish supporters at [[Dumfries]], before abandoning the campaign and returning south.&lt;ref name=Phillips2011PP125&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=125–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward promptly recalled Piers Gaveston, who was then in exile, and made him [[Earl of Cornwall]], before arranging his marriage to the wealthy Margaret de Clare.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Despite Edward appointing Piers Gaveston as the Earl of Cornwall in 1307, Edward's [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]] declined to recognise him as such until 1309.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chaplais|1994|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} Edward also arrested his old adversary Bishop Langton, and dismissed him from his post as treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward I's body was kept at [[Waltham Abbey Church|Waltham Abbey]] for several months before being taken for burial to Westminster, where Edward erected a simple [[marble]] tomb for his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The story that Edward I had asked his son to swear to boil his body, bury the flesh and take bones on campaign in Scotland was a later invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=123}}; {{harvnb|Prestwich|1988|p=557}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}

In 1308, Edward's marriage to Isabella of France proceeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward crossed the [[English Channel]] to France in January, leaving Gaveston as his ''custos regni'' in charge of the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; This arrangement was unusual, and involved unprecedented powers being delegated to Gaveston, backed by a specially engraved [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chaplais|1994|pp=34–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward probably hoped that the marriage would strengthen his position in Gascony and bring him much needed funds.&lt;ref name=Brown1988P575/&gt; The final negotiations, however, proved challenging: Edward and Philip IV did not like each other, and the French king drove a hard bargain over the size of Isabella's [[dower]] and the details of the administration of Edward's lands in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1988|pp=574–575, 578, 584}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=131–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the agreement, Edward gave homage to Philip for the Duchy of Aquitaine and agreed to a commission to complete the implementation of the 1303 Treaty of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=131–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pair were married in [[Boulogne]] on 25 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward gave Isabella a [[Isabella Psalter|psalter]] as a wedding gift, and her father gave her gifts worth over 21,000 [[French livre|livres]] and a fragment of the [[True Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=135}}; {{harvnb|Brown|1988|p=574}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair returned to England in February, where Edward had ordered [[Westminster Palace]] to be lavishly restored in readiness for their coronation and wedding feast, complete with marble tables, forty ovens and a fountain that produced wine and pimento, a spiced medieval drink.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=135, 139–140}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some delays, the ceremony went ahead on 25 February at Westminster Abbey, under the guidance of [[Henry Woodlock]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the coronation, Edward swore to uphold &quot;the rightful laws and customs which the community of the realm shall have chosen&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is uncertain what this meant: it might have been intended to force Edward to accept future legislation, it may have been inserted to prevent him from overturning any future vows he might take, or it may have been an attempt by the king to ingratiate himself with the barons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phillips 2011 140-143&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=140–143}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=56–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|It is unclear who wrote this part of the coronation oath, or what their intentions where. Historical discussions over the coronation oath have included debate over the tense of the Latin phrase ''aura eslau'', which would change the meaning of the oath from referring to future legislation, to a retrospective statement about respecting existing laws and customs. It is also uncertain to what extent any changes in the coronation oath were driven by wider political disagreements between Edward and the barons, or were specifically focused over concerns with Gaveston's position.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phillips 2011 140-143&quot;/&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} The event was marred by the large crowds of eager spectators who surged into the palace, knocking down a wall and forcing Edward to flee by the back door.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Isabella was only 12 years old at the time of her wedding, young by the standards of the period, and Edward probably had sexual relations with mistresses during their first few years together.&lt;ref name=HainesPhillipsP61&gt;{{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=61}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he fathered an illegitimate son, [[Adam FitzRoy|Adam]], who was born possibly as early as 1307.&lt;ref name=HainesPhillipsP61/&gt; Edward and Isabella's first son, the future [[Edward III]], was born in 1312 amid great celebrations, and three more children followed: [[John of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall|John]] in 1316, [[Eleanor of Woodstock|Eleanor]] in 1318 and [[Joan of the Tower|Joan]] in 1321.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=93}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tensions over Gaveston===
[[File:Philip iv and family.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of Philip IV and family|[[Isabella of France]], third from left, with her father, [[Philip IV of France]], centre]]
Gaveston's return from exile in 1307 was initially accepted by the barons, but opposition quickly grew.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|p=74}}; {{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared to have an excessive influence on royal policy, leading to complaints from one chronicler that there were &quot;two kings reigning in one kingdom, the one in name and the other in deed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=135–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accusations, probably untrue, were levelled at Gaveston that he had stolen royal funds and had purloined Isabella's wedding presents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=136–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaveston had played a key role at Edward's coronation, provoking fury from both the English and French contingents about the earl's ceremonial precedence and magnificent clothes, and about Edward's apparent preference for Gaveston's company over that of Isabella at the feast.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=144–146}}; {{harvnb|Chaplais|1994|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Parliament of England|Parliament]] met in February 1308 in a heated atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Phillips2011PP146&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward was eager to discuss the potential for governmental reform, but the barons were unwilling to begin any such debate until the problem of Gaveston had been resolved.&lt;ref name=Phillips2011PP146/&gt; Violence seemed likely, but the situation was resolved through the mediation of the moderate [[Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln]], who convinced the barons to back down.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fresh parliament was held in April, where the barons once again criticised Gaveston, demanding his exile, this time supported by Isabella and the French monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=147–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward resisted, but finally acquiesced, agreeing to send Gaveston to Aquitaine, under threat of [[excommunication]] by the Archbishop of Canterbury should he return.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=149–150}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the last moment, Edward changed his mind and instead sent Gaveston to [[Dublin]], appointing him as the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward called for a fresh military campaign for Scotland, but this idea was quietly abandoned, and instead the king and the barons met in August 1308 to discuss reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behind the scenes, Edward started negotiations to convince both [[Pope Clement V]] and Philip IV to allow Gaveston to return to England, offering in exchange to suppress the Knights Templar in England, and to release Bishop Langton from prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward called a new meeting of members of the Church and key barons in January 1309, and the leading earls then gathered in March and April, possibly under the leadership of [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another parliament followed, which refused to allow Gaveston to return to England, but offered to grant Edward additional taxes if he agreed to a programme of reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward sent assurances to the Pope that the conflict surrounding Gaveston's role was at an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of these promises, and procedural concerns about how the original decision had been taken, the Pope agreed to annul the Archbishop's threat to excommunicate Gaveston, thus opening the possibility of Gaveston's return.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=155, 157–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaveston arrived back in England in June, where he was met by Edward.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the parliament the next month, Edward made a range of concessions to placate those opposed to Gaveston, including agreeing to limit the powers of the [[Lord Steward|royal steward]] and the [[marshal]] of the royal household, to regulate the Crown's unpopular powers of [[purveyance]] and to abandon recently enacted customs legislation; in return, parliament agreed to fresh taxes for the war in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temporarily, at least, Edward and the barons appeared to have come to a successful compromise.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ordinances of 1311===
{{Main article|Ordinances of 1311}}

Following his return, Gaveston's relationship with the major barons became increasingly difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was considered arrogant, and he took to referring to the earls by offensive names, including calling one of their more powerful members the &quot;dog of Warwick&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=161}}; {{harvnb|Chaplais|1994|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Earl of Lancaster and Gaveston's enemies refused to attend parliament in 1310 because Gaveston would be present.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward was facing increasing financial problems, owing £22,000 to his [[Frescobaldi]] Italian bankers, and facing protests about how he was using his right of [[prise]]s to acquire supplies for the war in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=162–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; His attempts to raise an army for Scotland collapsed and the earls suspended the collection of the new taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The king and parliament met again in February 1310, and the proposed discussions of Scottish policy were replaced by debate of domestic problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward was petitioned to abandon Gaveston as his counsellor and instead adopt the advice of 21 elected barons, termed [[Ordainers]], who would carry out a widespread reform of both the government and the royal household.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=164–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under huge pressure, he agreed to the proposal and the Ordainers were elected, broadly evenly split between reformers and conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Ordainers began their plans for reform, Edward and Gaveston took a new army of around 4,700 men to Scotland, where the military situation had continued to deteriorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=167–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert the Bruce declined to give battle and the campaign progressed ineffectually over the winter until supplies and money ran out in 1311, forcing Edward to return south.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=169–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By now the Ordainers had drawn up their Ordinances for reform and Edward had little political choice but to give way and accept them in October.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=176}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ordinances of 1311]] contained clauses limiting the king's right to go to war or to grant land without parliament's approval, giving parliament control over the royal administration, abolishing the system of prises, excluding the Frescobaldi bankers, and introducing a system to monitor the adherence to the Ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Ordinances exiled Gaveston once again, this time with instructions that he should not be allowed to live anywhere within Edward's lands, including Gascony and Ireland, and that he should be stripped of his titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=178–179, 182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward retreated to his estates at [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]] and [[Kings Langley]]; Gaveston left England, possibly for northern France or Flanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=180–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mid-reign (1311–1321)==

===Death of Gaveston===
Tensions between Edward and the barons remained high, and the earls opposed to the king kept their personal armies mobilised late into 1311.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; By now Edward had become estranged from his cousin, the Earl of Lancaster, who was also the [[Earl of Leicester]], Lincoln, [[Earl of Salisbury|Salisbury]] and [[Earl of Derby|Derby]], with an income of around £11,000 a year from his lands, almost double that of the next wealthiest baron.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=152, 174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Backed by the earls of [[Edmund Fitzalan, 2nd Earl of Arundel|Arundel]], [[Gilbert de Clare, 8th Earl of Gloucester|Gloucester]], [[Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford|Hereford]], [[Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]] and [[Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick|Warwick]], Lancaster led a powerful faction in England, but he was not personally interested in practical administration, nor was he a particularly imaginative or effective politician.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=182, 276}}; {{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|p=77}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=82–83, 87, 95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward responded to the baronial threat by revoking the Ordinances and recalling Gaveston to England, being reunited with him at York in January 1312.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=182–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; The barons were furious and met in London, where Gaveston was excommunicated by the Archbishop of Canterbury and plans were put in place to capture Gaveston and prevent him from fleeing to Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=184–185}}; {{harvnb|Chaplais|1994|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward, Isabella and Gaveston left for Newcastle, pursued by Lancaster and his followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=186–187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abandoning many of their belongings, the royal party fled by ship and landed at [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], where Gaveston stayed while Edward and Isabella returned to York.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a short siege, Gaveston surrendered to the earls of Pembroke and [[John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey|Surrey]], on the promise that he would not be harmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=187–188}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had with him a huge collection of gold, silver and gems, probably part of the royal treasury, which he was later accused of having stolen from Edward.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamilton|1991|pp=202–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the way back from the north, Pembroke stopped in the village of [[Deddington]] in the Midlands, putting Gaveston under guard there while he went to visit his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=189}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Earl of Warwick took this opportunity to seize Gaveston, taking him to [[Warwick Castle]], where the Earl of Lancaster and the rest of his faction assembled on 18 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=189–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a brief trial, Gaveston was declared guilty of being a traitor under the terms of the Ordinances; he was executed on [[Blacklow Hill]] the following day, under the authority of Lancaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=190–191}}; {{harvnb|Chaplais|1994|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaveston's body was not buried until 1315, when his funeral was held in [[King's Langley Priory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tensions with Lancaster and France===
[[File:Trojka kralove.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of Edward at a knighting ceremony|Edward (left) and Philip IV at the knighting ceremony of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]], 1312]]
Reactions to the death of Gaveston varied considerably.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaplais 1994 89&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Chaplais|1994|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward was furious and deeply upset over what he saw as the murder of Gaveston; he made provisions for Gaveston's family, and intended to take revenge on the barons involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chaplais|1994|p=82}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earls of Pembroke and Surrey were embarrassed and angry about Warwick's actions, and shifted their support to Edward in the aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=191}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Lancaster and his core of supporters, the execution had been both legal and necessary to preserve the stability of the kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaplais 1994 89&quot;/&gt; Civil war again appeared likely, but in December, the Earl of Pembroke negotiated a potential peace treaty between the two sides, which would pardon the opposition barons for the killing of Gaveston, in exchange for their support for a fresh campaign in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=193–196, 199–200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lancaster and Warwick, however, did not give the treaty their immediate approval, and further negotiations continued through most of 1313.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=206–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the Earl of Pembroke had been negotiating with France to resolve the long-standing disagreements over the administration of Gascony, and as part of this Edward and Isabella agreed to travel to Paris in June 1313 to meet with Philip IV.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=207–920}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward probably hoped both to resolve the problems in the south of France and to win Philip's support in the dispute with the barons; for Philip it was an opportunity to impress his son-in-law with his power and wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=209–211}}&lt;/ref&gt; It proved a spectacular visit, including a grand ceremony in which the two kings knighted Philip's sons and 200 other men in [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], large banquets along the [[River Seine]], and a public declaration that both kings and their queens would join a crusade to the [[Levant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=210–211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip gave lenient terms for settling the problems in Gascony, and the event was spoiled only by a serious fire in Edward's quarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return from France, Edward found his political position greatly strengthened.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; After intense negotiation, the earls, including Lancaster and Warwick, came to a compromise in October 1313, fundamentally very similar to the draft agreement of the previous December.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward's finances improved, thanks to parliament agreeing to the raising of taxes, a loan of 160,000 [[florin]]s (£25,000) from the Pope, £33,000 borrowed from Philip, and further loans organised by Edward's new Italian banker, [[Antonio Pessagno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=218–219}}; {{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time in his reign, Edward's government was well-funded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=225–226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Bannockburn===
[[File:Battle from Holkham Bible.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Sketch of the Battle of Bannockburb|Depiction of the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in 1314 from the Holkham Bible]]
{{main article|Battle of Bannockburn}}
By 1314, Robert the Bruce had recaptured most of the [[castles in Scotland]] once held by Edward, pushing raiding parties into northern England as far as [[Carlisle]].&lt;ref name=Phillips2011PP223&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=223–224}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Edward planned a major military campaign with the support of Lancaster and the barons, mustering a large army between 15,000 and 20,000 strong.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=225–227}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Robert had besieged Stirling Castle, a key fortification in Scotland; its English commander had stated that unless Edward arrived by 24 June, he would surrender.&lt;ref name=Phillips2011PP223/&gt; News of this reached the king in late May, and he decided to speed up his march north from [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]] to relieve the castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=223, 227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert, with between 5,500 and 6,500 troops, predominantly [[spearmen]], prepared to prevent Edward's forces from reaching Stirling.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=228–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The battle began on 23 June as the English army attempted to force its way across the high ground of the [[Bannock Burn]], which was surrounded by marshland.&lt;ref name=Phillips2011P230&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skirmishing between the two sides broke out, resulting in the death of Sir [[Henry de Bohun]], whom Robert killed in personal combat.&lt;ref name=Phillips2011P230/&gt; Edward continued his advance the following day, and encountered the bulk of the Scottish army as they emerged from the woods of New Park.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phillips 2011 231-232&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=231–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward appears not to have expected the Scots to give battle here, and as a result had kept his forces in marching, rather than battle, order, with the [[archers]] − who would usually have been used to break up enemy spear formations − at the back of his army, rather than the front.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phillips 2011 231-232&quot;/&gt; His cavalry found it hard to operate in the cramped terrain and were crushed by Robert's spearmen.&lt;ref name=Phillips2011P232&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English army was overwhelmed and its leaders were unable to regain control.&lt;ref name=Phillips2011P232/&gt;

Edward stayed behind to fight, but it became obvious to the Earl of Pembroke that the battle was lost and he dragged the king away from the battlefield, hotly pursued by the Scottish forces.&lt;ref name=Phillips2011P233&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward only just escaped the heavy fighting, making a vow to found a [[Carmelite]] religious house at [[Oxford]] if he survived.&lt;ref name=Phillips2011P233/&gt; The historian Roy Haines describes the defeat as a &quot;calamity of stunning proportions&quot; for the English, whose losses in the battle were huge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=234–236}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the defeat, Edward retreated to [[Dunbar]], then travelled by ship to Berwick, and then back to [[York]]; in his absence, Stirling Castle quickly fell.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=233, 238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Famine and criticism===
{{main article|Great Famine of 1315–17}}

After the fiasco of Bannockburn, the earls of Lancaster and Warwick saw their political influence increase, and they pressured Edward to re-implement the Ordinances of 1311.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=239, 243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lancaster became the head of the [[royal council]] in 1316, promising to take forward the Ordinances through a new reform commission, but he appears to have abandoned this role soon afterwards, partially because of disagreements with the other barons, and possibly because of ill-health.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=246, 267, 276}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lancaster refused to meet with Edward in parliament for the next two years, bringing effective governance to a standstill. This stymied any hopes for a fresh campaign into Scotland and raised fears of civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=280, 282–283, 294}}; {{harvnb|Tebbit|2005|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; After much negotiation, once again involving the Earl of Pembroke, Edward and Lancaster finally agreed to the [[Treaty of Leake]] in August 1318, which pardoned Lancaster and his faction and established a new royal council, temporarily averting conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=308, 330}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward's difficulties were exacerbated by prolonged problems in [[Economics of English Agriculture in the Middle Ages#The Great Famine of 1315–1317|English agriculture]], part of a wider phenomenon in northern Europe known as the [[Great Famine of 1315–17|Great Famine]]. It began with torrential rains in late 1314, followed by a very cold winter and heavy rains the following spring that killed many sheep and cattle. The bad weather continued, almost unabated, into 1321, resulting in a string of bad harvests.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jordan|1996|p=171}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=252–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revenues from the exports of wool plummeted and the price of food rose, despite attempts by Edward's government to control prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jordan|1996|p=171}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward called for hoarders to release food, and tried to encourage both internal trade and the importation of grain, but with little success.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jordan|1996|pp=172–174}}&lt;/ref&gt; The requisitioning of provisions for the royal court during the famine years only added to tensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ormrod|2011|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Robert the Bruce exploited his victory at Bannockburn to raid northern England, initially attacking Carlisle and Berwick, and then reaching further south into [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]], even threatening York itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=248, 281, 329, 343–348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward undertook an expensive but unsuccessful campaign to stem the advance in 1319, but the famine made it increasingly difficult to keep his garrisons supplied with food.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=343–348}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, a Scottish expedition led by Robert's brother [[Edward Bruce]] successfully invaded Ireland in 1315. Edward Bruce declared himself the [[King of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=248, 253–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was finally defeated in 1318 by Edward II's Irish justiciar, Edmund Butler, at the [[Battle of Faughart]], and Edward Bruce's severed head was sent back to Edward II.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=256–258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revolts also broke out [[Banastre Rebellion|in Lancashire]] and [[Bristol]] in 1315, and in [[Glamorgan]] in Wales in 1316, but were suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=247–248}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The famine and the Scottish policy were felt to be a punishment from God, and complaints about Edward multiplied, one contemporary poem describing the &quot;Evil Times of Edward II&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|pp=17, 36}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many criticised Edward's &quot;improper&quot; and ignoble interest in rural pursuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1318, a mentally ill man named [[John of Powderham]] appeared in Oxford, claiming that he was the real Edward II, and that Edward was a [[changeling]], swapped at birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; John was duly executed, but his claims resonated with those criticising Edward for his lack of regal behaviour and steady leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=43–44}}; {{harvnb|Childs|1991|pp=160–162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition also grew around Edward's treatment of his royal favourites.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tebbit|2005|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward had managed to retain some of his previous advisers, despite attempts by the Ordainers to remove them, and divided the extensive [[Gilbert de Clare, 8th Earl of Gloucester#Dispersal of estates and aftermath|de Clare inheritance]] among two of his new favourites, the former household knights Hugh Audley and [[Roger Damory]], instantly making them extremely rich.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tebbit|2005|p=205}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The de Clare inheritance had belonged to Gilbert de Clare, the late Earl of Gloucester, who died fighting at Bannockburn. The estates were divided up among his three sisters, one of whom was already married to Hugh Despenser the Younger.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tebbit|2005|p=205}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} Many of the moderates who had helped deliver the peaceful compromise in 1318 now began to turn against Edward, making violence ever more likely.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later reign (1321–1326)==

===The Despenser War===
{{main article|Despenser War}}
The long-threatened [[Despenser War|civil war]] finally broke out in England in 1321,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=372–378}}&lt;/ref&gt; triggered by the tension between many of the barons and the royal favourites, the Despenser family.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=121–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hugh Despenser the Elder]] had served both Edward and his father, while Hugh Despenser the Younger had married into the wealthy de Clare family, became the King's [[chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]], and acquired Glamorgan in the [[Welsh Marches]] in 1317.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=364–365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh the Younger subsequently expanded his holdings and power across Wales, mainly at the expense of the other [[Marcher Lord]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=365–366}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Earl of Lancaster and the Despensers were fierce enemies, and Lancaster's antipathy was shared by most of the Despensers' neighbours, including the Earl of Hereford, the [[Mortimer#Medieval magnates|Mortimer family]] and the recently elevated Hugh Audley and Roger Damory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=364, 366–367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward, however, increasingly relied on the Despensers for advice and support, and he was particularly close to Hugh the Younger, whom one chronicler noted he &quot;loved&amp;nbsp;... dearly with all his heart and mind&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=367–368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1321, Lancaster mobilised a coalition of the Despensers' enemies across the Marcher territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=374–375}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward and Hugh the Younger became aware of these plans in March and headed west, hoping that negotiations led by the moderate Earl of Pembroke would defuse the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=375–377}}&lt;/ref&gt; This time, Pembroke made his excuses and declined to intervene, and war broke out in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=376–377}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Despensers' lands were quickly seized by a coalition of the Marcher Lords and the local gentry, and Lancaster held a high-level gathering of the barons and clergy in June which condemned the Despensers for having broken the Ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=377–379}}; {{harvnb|Jordan|1996|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward attempted reconciliation, but in July the opposition occupied London and called for the permanent removal of the Despensers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=383–387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing that he might be deposed if he refused, Edward agreed to exile the Despensers and pardoned the Marcher Lords for their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=390}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward began to plan his revenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=394}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of Pembroke, he formed a small coalition of his half-brothers, a few of the earls and some of the senior clergy, and prepared for war.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=395–397}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward started with [[Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere]], and Isabella was sent to Bartholomew's stronghold, [[Leeds Castle]], to deliberately create a ''[[casus belli]]''.&lt;ref name=Phillips2011P397&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=397}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bartholomew's wife, [[Margaret de Clare, Baroness Badlesmere|Margaret]], took the bait and her men killed several of Isabella's retinue, giving Edward an excuse to intervene.&lt;ref name=Phillips2011P397/&gt; Lancaster refused to help Bartholomew, his personal enemy, and Edward quickly regained control of south-east England.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=397–398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alarmed, Lancaster now mobilised his own army in the north of England, and Edward mustered his own forces in the south-west.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=399–400}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Despensers returned from exile and were pardoned by the royal council.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=400–401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December, Edward led his army across the [[River Severn]] and advanced into the Welsh Marches, where the opposition forces had gathered.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=403–404}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition of Marcher Lords crumbled and the Mortimers surrendered to Edward,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=404}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Damory, Audley and the Earl of Hereford marched north in January to join Lancaster, who had laid siege the king's castle at [[Tickhill Castle|Tickhill]].&lt;ref name=Phillips2011PP406407&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=406–407}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolstered by fresh reinforcements from the Marcher Lords, Edward pursued them, meeting Lancaster's army on 10 March at [[Burton-on-Trent]]. Lancaster, outnumbered, retreated without a fight, fleeing north.&lt;ref name=Phillips2011PP406407/&gt; [[Andrew Harclay]] cornered Lancaster at the [[Battle of Boroughbridge]], and captured the earl.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=408}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward and Hugh the Younger met Lancaster at [[Pontefract Castle]], where, after a [[summary trial]], the earl was found guilty of treason and beheaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=408–409}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edward and the Despensers===
[[File:Philippe4 eduard2 ludvikNavarra.jpg|thumb|alt=painting of Edward hunting|Edward (third from the left) hunting with Philip IV]]
Edward punished Lancaster's supporters through a system of special courts across the country, with the judges instructed in advance how to sentence the accused, who were not allowed to speak in their own defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=410–411}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these so-called &quot;Contrariants&quot; were simply executed, and others were imprisoned or fined, with their lands seized and their surviving relatives detained.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=411–413}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Earl of Pembroke, whom Edward now mistrusted, was arrested and only released after pledging all of his possessions as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] for his own loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward was able to reward his loyal supporters, especially the Despenser family, with the confiscated estates and new titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=417}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fines and confiscations made Edward rich: almost £15,000 was brought in during the first few months, and by 1326, Edward's treasury contained £62,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=419}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; A parliament was held at York in March 1322 at which the Ordinances were formally revoked through the [[Statute of York]], and fresh taxes agreed for a new campaign against the Scots.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=423–425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English campaign against Scotland was planned on a massive scale, with a force of around 23,350 men.&lt;ref name=Phillips2011PP426&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=426–427}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward advanced through [[Lothian]] towards [[Edinburgh]], but Robert the Bruce declined to meet him in battle, drawing Edward further into Scotland. Plans to resupply the campaign by sea failed, and the large army rapidly ran out of food.&lt;ref name=Phillips2011PP426/&gt; Edward was forced to retreat south of the border, pursued by Scottish raiding parties.&lt;ref name=Phillips2011PP426/&gt; Edward's illegitimate son, Adam, died during the campaign, and the raiding parties almost captured Isabella, who was staying at [[Tynemouth]] and was forced to flee by sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=428–431}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward planned a fresh campaign, backed by a round of further taxes, but confidence in his Scottish policy was diminishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Harclay, instrumental in securing Edward's victories the previous year and recently made the [[Earl of Carlisle]], independently negotiated a peace treaty with Robert the Bruce, proposing that Edward would recognise Robert as the King of Scotland and that, in return, Robert would cease to interfere in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=423–433}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward was furious and immediately executed Harclay, but agreed to a thirteen-year truce with Robert.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=434–435}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugh Despenser the Younger lived and ruled in grand style, playing a leading role in Edward's government, and executing policy through a wide network of family retainers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=440–442, 445}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supported by Chancellor [[Robert Baldock]] and Lord Treasurer [[Walter Stapledon]], the Despensers accumulated land and wealth, using their position in government to provide superficial cover for what historian Seymour Phillips describes as &quot;the reality of fraud, threats of violence and abuse of legal procedure&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=445–446}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Edward faced growing opposition. [[Miracle]]s were reported around the late Earl of Lancaster's tomb, and at the [[gallows]] used to execute members of the opposition in Bristol.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=436}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law and order began to break down, encouraged by the chaos caused by the seizure of lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=419–420}}&lt;/ref&gt; The old opposition consisting of Marcher Lords' associates attempted to free the prisoners Edward held in [[Wallingford Castle]], and [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]], one of the most prominent of the imprisoned Marcher Lords, escaped from the [[Tower of London]] and fled to France.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=438, 440–441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===War with France===
{{main article|War of Saint-Sardos}}
The disagreements between Edward and the French Crown over the Duchy of Gascony led to the [[War of Saint-Sardos]] in 1324.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=455–456}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles IV of France|Charles]], Edward's brother-in-law, had become King of France in 1322, and was more aggressive than his predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=456}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1323, he insisted that Edward come to Paris to give homage for Gascony, and demanded that Edward's administrators in Gascony allow French officials there to carry out orders given in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=456–457}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matters came to a head in October when a group of Edward's soldiers hanged a French sergeant for attempting to build a new [[bastide|fortified town]] in the [[Agenais]], a contested section of the Gascon border.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=461–462}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward denied any responsibility for this incident, but relations between Edward and Charles soured.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=274–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1324, Edward dispatched the Earl of Pembroke to Paris to broker a solution, but the earl died suddenly of an illness along the way. Charles mobilised his army and ordered the invasion of Gascony.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=461, 464–465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward's forces in Gascony were around 4,400 strong, but the French army, commanded by [[Charles of Valois]], numbered 7,000.&lt;ref name=Phillips2011P464&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=464}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valois took the Agenais and then advanced further and cut off the main city of [[Bordeaux]].&lt;ref name=Phillips2011P464/&gt; In response, Edward ordered the arrest of any French persons in England and seized Isabella's lands, on the basis that she was of French origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=466}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1324 he met with the earls and the English Church, who recommended that Edward should lead a force of 11,000 men to Gascony.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=467}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward decided not to go personally, sending instead the Earl of Surrey.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=468}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Edward opened up fresh negotiations with the French king.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles advanced various proposals, the most tempting of which was the suggestion that if Isabella and Prince Edward were to travel to Paris, and the Prince was to give homage to Charles for Gascony, he would terminate the war and return the Agenais.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=470}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward and his advisers had concerns about sending the prince to France, but agreed to send Isabella on her own as an envoy in March 1325.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=470–471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fall from power (1326–1327)==

===Rift with Isabella===
[[File:Isabela Karel Eda.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Painting of Edward III giving homage|The future [[Edward III]] giving homage in 1325 to Charles IV under the guidance of Isabella of France]]
Isabella, with Edward's envoys, carried out negotiations with the French in late March.&lt;ref name=Phillips2011P472&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=472}}&lt;/ref&gt; The negotiations proved difficult, and they arrived at a settlement only after Isabella personally intervened with her brother, Charles.&lt;ref name=Phillips2011P472/&gt; The terms favoured the French Crown: in particular, Edward would give homage in person to Charles for Gascony.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=472–473}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned about the consequences of war breaking out once again, Edward agreed to the treaty but decided to give Gascony to his son, Edward, and sent the prince to give homage in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=473–476}}&lt;/ref&gt; The young Prince Edward crossed the English Channel and completed the bargain in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=479}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Edward's lawyers put forward various arguments in the dispute with the French kings. One line of argument stemmed from the 1259 treaty agreed by Edward's grandfather, Henry III, under which Henry had agreed to give homage for Gascony; Edward's lawyers observed that this treaty, which underpinned Edward's 1303 treaty with France, had been a bilateral agreement between the two kings, rather than a conventional feudal agreement. As such, Edward's offering homage for Gascony was dependent on the French crown delivering on its own commitments, rather than an absolute duty. Edward's lawyers also argued that Isabella had a potential claim to the lands in the south under customary French law. When granting Gascony to Isabella, Phillip IV appeared to have been dividing up his lands, as was customary at the time, rather than giving a conditional grant, which meant that Gascony was an [[allod]], Edward's personal property, and as such not subject to the French king's laws on the carrying of weapons or money.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hallam|Everard|2001|pp=322, 387}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=19–20, 305–306}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}

Edward now expected Isabella and their son to return to England, but instead she remained in France and showed no intention of making her way back.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=485–486}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1322, Edward and Isabella's marriage appears to have been successful, but by the time Isabella left for France in 1325, it had deteriorated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|2004|pp=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isabella appears to have disliked Hugh Despenser the Younger intensely, not least because of his abuse of high-status women.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|2004|pp=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isabella was embarrassed that she had fled from Scottish armies three times during her marriage to Edward, and she blamed Hugh for the final occurrence in 1322.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|2004|pp=75–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Edward had negotiated the recent truce with Robert the Bruce, he had severely disadvantaged a range of noble families who owned land in Scotland, including the Beaumonts, close friends of Isabella's.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=437–438}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also angry about the arrest of her household and seizure of her lands in 1324. Finally, Edward had taken away her children and given custody of them to Hugh Despenser's wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|2004|pp=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By February 1326, it was clear that Isabella was involved in a relationship with an exiled Marcher Lord, Roger Mortimer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=488–489}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear when Isabella first met Mortimer or when their relationship began, but they both wanted to see Edward and the Despensers removed from power.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=489–491}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Historian Roy Haines stresses the lack of evidence for any earlier relationship, while Paul Doherty argues that there is no evidence for them having been closely involved before December 1325, although he suspects that they may have been friends by 1323. While agreeing that there is no documentary evidence available, Ian Mortimer takes a more radical perspective, arguing that they met much earlier, and that Isabella helped Mortimer escape from the Tower of London in 1323.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mortimer|2004|p=284}}; {{harvnb|Doherty|2004|pp=86–88}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} Edward appealed for his son to return, and for Charles to intervene on his behalf, but this had no effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

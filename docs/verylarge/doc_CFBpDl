===Materials and distribution===
[[File:Coronilla san miguel.jpg|thumb|A [[Chaplet of Saint Michael|Saint Michael Chaplet]].]]
The beads can be made from any materials, including wood, bone, [[glass]], crushed flowers, semi-precious stones such as [[agate]], [[jet (gemstone)|jet]], [[amber]], or [[jasper]], or precious materials including [[Coral (precious)#Coral as a gemstone|coral]], crystal, [[silver]], and [[gold]]. Beads may be made to include enclosed sacred relics or drops of [[holy water]]. Rosaries are sometimes made from the seeds of the &quot;[[Abrus precatorius|rosary pea]]&quot; or &quot;[[Adenanthera pavonina|bead tree]].&quot; Today, the vast majority of rosary beads are made of glass, plastic or wood. It is common for beads to be made of material with some special significance, such as jet from the shrine of [[St. James the Greater|St. James]] at [[Santiago de Compostela]], or olive seeds from the [[Garden of Gethsemane]]. In rare cases beads are made of expensive materials, from [[gold]] and [[silver]] to [[mother of pearl]] and [[Swarovski]] black diamond designs. Early rosaries were strung on thread, often [[silk]], but modern ones are more often made as a series of chain-linked beads. Catholic missionaries in [[Africa]] have reported that rosaries made of [[Bark (botany)|tree bark]] have been used there for praying due to the lack of conventional rosaries. [[Our Lady's Rosary Makers]] produce some 7 million rosaries annually that are distributed to those considered to be in economic and spiritual need.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olrm.org/ &quot;Our Lady's Rosary Makers&quot;, Access date: 15 May 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most rosaries used in the world today have simple and inexpensive plastic or wooden beads connected by cords or strings. The major cost is labor for assembly. A large number of inexpensive rosary beads are manufactured in [[Asia]], especially in [[China]]. [[Italy]] has a strong manufacturing presence in medium- and high-cost rosaries.

Rosaries are often made for sale; hundreds of millions have also been made and distributed free of charge by Catholic [[apostolates|lay and religious apostolates]] worldwide. There are a number of rosary-making clubs around the world that make and distribute rosaries to missions, hospitals, prisons, etc. free of charge. To comply with safety precautions in prisons, special rosaries are donated using string that easily breaks.

===Wearing the rosary===
The Apostolate of Holy Motherhood writes that the Virgin Mary encourages the faithful to wear the rosary and scapular because &quot;it will help them to love [[Jesus]] more&quot; and serve as a &quot;protection from [[Satan]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shamon2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Shamon |first=Albert Joseph Mary |title=Our Lady Teaches about Sacramentals and Blessed Objects |date=2003 |publisher=CMJ Publishers and Distributors |isbn=978-1891280122 |page=31 |quote=To Mariamante, Our Lady said: &quot;The Scapular of Mount Carmel is a sign of my protection. Wear it always. It will help you to do good because it is a sign of my love and will remind you of me often. This is the purpose of all sacramentals—to remind you of the person behind them and to help you to imitate their virtues. The Scapular and the Rosary are the greatest of these and will afford you the most protection. I want all my children to wear one. It will help them to love Jesus more. This is a simple means by which God helps His children. Wear it always.&quot; (''The Apostolate of Holy Motherhood'', pp. 10–11.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Saint Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort]] encouraged Christians to wear the rosary, stating that doing so &quot;eased him considerably.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Saint Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort |title=The Secret of the Rosary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wMvAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=St.+Louis+De+Montfort+rosary+wear+neck |accessdate=6 November 2012 |year=1965 |publisher=Montfort Publications |isbn=0895550563 |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many religious orders wear the rosary as part of their habit. A rosary hanging from the belt often forms part of the [[Carthusian]] habit.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, William M., ''Encyclopedia of Monasticism'', Volume 1 (2000, {{ISBN|1-57958-090-4}}), p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Canon Law|Canon Law §1171]] provides that sacred objects, which are designated for divine worship by dedication or blessing, are to be treated reverently and are not to be employed for profane or inappropriate use even if they are owned by private persons.&lt;ref name=Canon1171&gt;{{cite book |title=Code of Canon Law |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P48.HTM |quote=Can. 1171 |publisher=[[Holy See]] |accessdate=2011-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, according to Edward McNamara, professor of liturgy at the [[Pontifical Athenaeum Regina Apostolorum|Regina Apostolorum University]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If the reason for wearing a rosary is as a statement of faith, as a reminder to pray it, or some similar reason &quot;to the glory of God,&quot; then there is nothing to object to. It would not be respectful to wear it merely as jewelry. This latter point is something to bear in mind in the case of wearing a rosary around the neck. In the first place, while not unknown, it is not common Catholic practice. ...While a Catholic may wear a rosary around the neck for a good purpose, he or she should consider if the practice will be positively understood in the cultural context in which the person moves. If any misunderstanding is likely, then it would be better to avoid the practice. ...Similar reasoning is observed in dealing with rosary bracelets and rings, although in this case there is far less danger of confusion as to meaning. They are never mere jewelry but are worn as a sign of faith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/wearing-the-rosary-as-a-necklace McNamara, Edward. &quot;Wearing the Rosary as a Necklace&quot;, Zenit, 14 June 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Ringrosary.JPG|thumb|Single-decade ring rosary.]]
A rosary ring is a ring worn around the finger with 10 indentations and a cross on the surface, representing one decade of a rosary. These and other kinds of religious rings were especially popular during the 15th and the 16th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O121196/ring-unknown/ &quot;Collections: Ring&quot;, Victoria and Albert Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; These rosary rings have been given to some Catholic nuns at the time of their solemn profession.{{sfn|Ball|2003|p=483}} A finger rosary is similar to a ring, but is somewhat larger. Rosaries like these are used by either rotating or just holding them between a finger and thumb while praying. A hand rosary is a decade in a complete loop, with one bead separated from ten other beads, this is meant to be carried while walking or running, so as not to entangle the larger type.

In addition to a string of beads, single-decade rosaries are made in other physical forms. A ring rosary, also known as a &quot;[[Basque ring rosary|Basque rosary]],&quot; is a finger ring with eleven knobs on it, ten round ones and one crucifix.

A rosary bracelet is one with ten beads and often a cross or medal. Another form is the rosary card. A rosary card is either one with a &quot;handle&quot; that moves like a [[slide rule]] to count the decade, or it has a whole rosary with bumps similar to [[Braille]] and ancient counting systems. Some households that cannot afford Christian artwork or a [[crucifix]] hang up a rosary.&lt;ref name=Kinmonth&gt;{{cite book |author=Claudia Kinmonth |title=Irish Rural Interiors in Art |year=2006 |url=https://archive.org/details/irishruralinteri00kinm |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/irishruralinteri00kinm/page/n82 67] |quote=Such icons were displayed in homes which sometimes seemed to possess few other material things: in some of the poorest houses, where people could not afford religious pictures, prints, or even a crucifix, a rosary could be hung up in their place. |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |accessdate=2011-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many Christians hang rosaries from the [[rear-view mirror]] of their automobiles as a sign of their faith and for protection as they drive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garbowski2014&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Garbowski |first=Christopher |title=Religious Life in Poland: History, Diversity and Modern Issues |year=2014 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0786475896 |page=222 |quote=If folk religion is demonstrated by drivers with rosaries hanging from rearview mirrors or St. Christopher figures on the dashboard, still common enough in Poland, the fish sticker on the car is a more conscious symbol of a witnessing Christian—significantly, unlike the former, it is on the outside of the car for everyone to see. This stops some interested Catholics from placing the symbol on their cars since they feel might not live up to the good driving practices that should accompany its presence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rosary and Scapular===
{{Main|Rosary and scapular}}
[[File:Rosary&amp;scapular.jpg|thumb|right|Rosary and Scapular]]

&quot;The [[Rosary and the Scapular]] are inseparable&quot; were words attributed to the Virgin Mary by [[Lucia Santos]], one of the three children who reported the Marian apparitions of [[Our Lady of Fátima]] in 1917 and later the [[Pontevedra apparitions]] in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Ordaz, Lynette Marie, ''The Real Mary'', Authorhouse Books, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-4343-4332-1}} p. 88{{better source|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these apparitions, the Virgin Mary reportedly called herself ''The Lady of the Rosary'' and in one of the final Fátima appearances on 13 October 1917 had a [[Brown Scapular]] in one hand and a rosary in the other. ''The Lady of the Rosary'' reportedly encouraged the praying of the Rosary and the wearing of the Brown Scapular.&lt;ref&gt;Santos, Lucia, ''Fatima in Lucia's Own Words'', 1976, Ravengate Press {{ISBN|0-911218-10-6}}{{page needed|date=April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout history, the Rosary and the [[Scapular]] as objects for [[Catholic devotions|devotions]] and prayers have been encouraged and associated by a number of popes, and specific indulgences have been attached to them.&lt;ref&gt;Vatican website for Pope [[Paul VI]]'s [[Apostolic Constitution]] [[Indulgentiarum Doctrina]] [https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-vi_apc_19670101_indulgentiarum-doctrina_en.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pope John Paul II, 1996, ''Gift And Mystery'', Doubleday Books {{ISBN|978-0-385-40966-7}} p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Click To Pray eRosary===
In October 2019 the Vatican launched a [[US$]]109 &quot;electronic rosary&quot; with ten black agate and hematite beads, and a metal cross that detects movement. It is connected to the &quot;Click to Pray eRosary&quot; mobile telephone app, designed to help Catholic users pray for world peace and contemplate the gospel. The rosary can be worn as a bracelet; it is activated by making the sign of the cross. The app gives visual and audio explanations of the rosary..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-50081466 |title=Vatican launches new 'eRosary' bracelet|website=BBC News |date= 17 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.extremetech.com/electronics/300388-wearables-for-christ-vatican-launches-new-click-to-pray-erosary |title=Wearables for Christ: Vatican Launches New 'Click to Pray eRosary'|website=ExtremeTech   |author=Joel Hruska|date=17 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rosary based devotions==
The use of [[Novena]]s which include a rosary is popular among Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11141b.htm Hilgers, Joseph. &quot;Novena.&quot; The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911.]&lt;/ref&gt; As in other Novenas, the traditional method consists of praying the rosary on nine consecutive days, and submitting a petition along with each prayer. Indulgences are provided for rosary Novenas that include specific prayers, e.g. a prayer to Saint [[Catherine of Siena]] and [[Saint Dominic]].&lt;ref name=Raccolta294 &gt;Christopher, Joseph P., Spence, Charles E., and Rowan, John F., ''The Raccolta or A Manual of Indulgences'', 2003 {{ISBN|0-9706526-6-6}} pp. 294–296&lt;/ref&gt;

The longer &quot;54-day Rosary Novena&quot; consists of two parts, 27 days each, i.e. three repetitions of the 9-day Novena cycle. It is an uninterrupted series of Rosaries in honor of the Virgin Mary, reported as a private revelation by Fortuna Agrelli in [[Naples, Italy]], in 1884.&lt;ref name=Dubruiel171 &gt;''The Church's Most Powerful Novenas'' by Michael Dubruiel 2006 {{ISBN|1-59276-097-X}} pp. 171–174&lt;/ref&gt; The Novena is performed by praying five decades of the Rosary each day for twenty-seven days in petition. The second phase which immediately follows it consists of five decades each day for twenty-seven days in thanksgiving, and is prayed whether or not the petition has been granted. During the novena, the meditations rotate among the joyful, sorrowful and glorious mysteries.{{sfn|Ball|2003|p=394}}

Rosary beads are at times used to say rosary-based prayers that do not primarily involve the Hail Mary and the mysteries of the Rosary. Some forms of the Catholic rosary are intended as reparation ''including the sins of others''. An example is the [[Rosary of the Holy Wounds]] first introduced at the beginning of the 20th century by the Venerable Sister [[Marie Martha Chambon]], a Catholic nun of the ''Monastery of the Visitation Order'' in [[Chambéry]], France.{{sfn|Ball|2003|pp=121, 245}} This rosary is somewhat similar in structure to the [[Chaplet of Divine Mercy]] introduced by Saint [[Faustina Kowalska]] said on the usual rosary beads and intended as an [[Act of Reparation to Jesus Christ]] for the sins of the world. These prayers often use rosary beads, but their words and format do not correspond to the Mysteries. Both Kowalska and Chambon attributed these prayers to [[Visions of Jesus and Mary|visions of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Freze, 1993, ''Voices, Visions, and Apparitions'', OSV Publishing {{ISBN|0-87973-454-X}}{{page needed|date=April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recordings of the Rosary==
Recordings of the Rosary prayers are sometimes used by devotees to help with aspects of prayer such as pacing, memorization, and by providing inspirational meditations. Some of the more well known include:

* The Rosary is a Place, [[Benedict Groeschel|Fr. Benedict J. Groeschel, CFR]] and Simonetta, The Saint Philomena Foundation
* The Rosary, [[Fr. Kevin Scallon]] and [[Dana Rosemary Scallon|Dana]], Heartbeat Records
* Pray the Rosary with Servant of God, [[Patrick Peyton|Fr. Patrick Peyton]]

==In non-Catholic Christianity==
Many similar prayer practices exist in other Christian communities, each with its own set of prescribed prayers and its own form of [[prayer beads]] (known as the &quot;[[Chotki]]&quot;), such as the [[prayer rope]] in [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christianity. These other devotions and their associated beads are usually referred to as &quot;[[Chaplet (Prayer)|chaplets]].&quot; The rosary is sometimes used by other [[Christians]], especially in [[Lutheranism]], the [[Anglican Communion]], and the [[Old Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lutheran /&gt;

Another example of Rosary-based prayers includes the non-denominational [[Ecumenical Miracle Rosary]], &quot;a set of prayers and meditations which covers key moments in the New Testament.&quot;&lt;ref name=Paulist1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://paulist.org/ecumenism/rosary-all-christians |title=A Rosary for All Christians? |year=2012 |publisher=[[Paulist Fathers]] |accessdate=5 November 2012 |author=Dennis Di Mauro |quote=I call the rosary &quot;ecumenical&quot;, since the prayers and &quot;miracles&quot; are either directly from the Bible or are derived from the Bible. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028192011/http://paulist.org/ecumenism/rosary-all-christians |archivedate=28 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anglicanism===
{{Main|Anglican prayer beads}}
[[File:Anglican prayer beads-2006 04 08.jpg|thumb|Anglican prayer beads.]]

The use of the Catholic Rosary is fairly common among Anglicans of [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] [[churchmanship]].&lt;ref name=Duckworth /&gt; Many Anglo-Catholic prayer books and manuals of devotion, such as [[Saint Augustine's Prayer Book]] contain the Catholic Rosary along with other Marian devotions. The public services of the Anglican churches, as contained in the [[Book of Common Prayer]], do not directly invoke the Blessed Virgin or any other saint in prayer as the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] reject the practice of praying to saints, but many Anglo-Catholics feel free to do so in their private devotions. Anglicans who pray the Catholic Rosary tend not to use the Luminous Mysteries or the Fátima decade prayer.&lt;ref name=Schultz &gt;''The Rosary for Episcopalians/Anglicans'' by Thomas Schultz 2003 {{ISBN|1-58790-055-6}}{{page needed|date=April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anglican prayer beads]], also known informally as the &quot;Anglican rosary,&quot; are a recent innovation created in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kingofpeace.org/prayerbeads.htm|title=King of Peace – Anglican Prayer Beads|website=kingofpeace.org|access-date=2019-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; They consist of four &quot;weeks&quot; (the equivalent of a decade) of seven beads each. The weeks are separated from each other by single beads termed &quot;cruciform beads.&quot; A variety of different prayers may be said, the most common being the [[Jesus Prayer]].

Anglican Prayer Beads are not a Marian devotion, and there are no appointed meditations. Although it is sometimes called the &quot;Anglican ''rosary'',&quot; it is distinct from the Rosary of Our Lady as prayed by Catholics, Anglicans, and other Western Christians.&lt;ref name=Duckworth &gt;''Mary: The Imagination of Her Heart'' by Penelope Duckworth 2004 {{ISBN|1-56101-260-2}} p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lutheranism===
A small minority of Lutherans pray the Rosary.&lt;ref&gt;''Personal Prayer Book'', 1522&lt;/ref&gt; However, while using the Catholic format of the Rosary, each &quot;Hail Mary&quot; is replaced with the &quot;Jesus Prayer.&quot; The only time the &quot;Hail Mary&quot; is said is at the end of the Mysteries on the medal, where it is then replaced with the &quot;Pre-Trent&quot; version of the prayer (which omits &quot;Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death&quot;). The final &quot;Hail Mary&quot; can also be replaced by reciting of either the prayer ''[[Magnificat]],'' or [[Martin Luther]]'s &quot;Evangelical praise of the Mother of God.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lutheran&gt;[http://www.giftsofaith.com/Files/lutheranrosary.pdf A Lutheran Rosary]. Retrieved 14 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wreath of Christ]] is used in the Swedish Lutheran church.

==Churches named for the Holy Rosary==
{{commons|Structured gallery of churches named after the rosary}}

==In Marian art==
Since the 17th century, the rosary began to appear as an element in key pieces of [[Catholic Marian art]]. Key examples include [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murrillo]]'s ''Madonna with the Rosary'' at the [[Museo del Prado]] in Spain and the statue of ''Madonna with Rosary'' at the church of [[San Nazaro Maggiore]] in Milan.

'''Ionia''' ({{IPAc-en|aɪ|ˈ|oʊ|n|i|ə}}; [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]: [[wikt:Ἰωνία|Ἰωνία]] /i.ɔː.ní.aː/, ''Iōnía'' or Ἰωνίη, ''Iōníē'') was an ancient [[region]] on the central part of the western coast of [[Anatolia]] in present-day [[Turkey]], the region nearest [[İzmir]], which was historically [[Smyrna]]. It consisted of the northernmost territories of the [[Ionian League]] of [[Greeks|Greek]]  settlements. Never a unified state, it was named after the [[Ionians|Ionian tribe]] who, in the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic Period]] (600–480 BC), settled mainly the shores and islands of the [[Aegean Sea]]. Ionian states were identified by tradition and by their use of [[Ancient Greek dialects#Groups|Eastern Greek]].

Ionia proper comprised a narrow coastal strip from [[Phocaea]] in the north near the mouth of the river [[Hermus]] (now the [[Gediz River|Gediz]]), to [[Miletus]] in the south near the mouth of the river [[Maeander]], and included the islands of [[Chios]] and [[Samos]]. It was bounded by [[Aeolis|Aeolia]] to the north, [[Lydia]] to the east and [[Caria]] to the south. The cities within the region figured large in the strife between the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] and the Greeks.

According to [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] tradition, the cities of Ionia were founded by [[colonists]] from the other side of the Aegean. Their settlement was connected with the legendary history of the Ionic people in [[Attica, Greece|Attica]], which asserts that the colonists were led by Neleus and Androclus, sons of [[Codrus]], the last [[king of Athens]]. In accordance with this view the &quot;Ionic migration&quot;, as it was called by later chronologers, was dated by them one hundred and forty years after the [[Trojan War]], or sixty years after the return of the [[Heracleidae]] into the [[Peloponnese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William|last=Smith|authorlink=William Smith (lexicographer)|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography: Volume II Iabadius-Zymethus|location=London|publisher=Walton and Maberly|year=1857|pages=''Ionia'' pages 60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ionia&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1911|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/39908/39908-h/39908-h.htm#ar78|title=Ionia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
===Physical===
Ionia was of small extent, not exceeding {{convert|150|km|mi|-1}} in length from north to south, with a breadth varying from {{convert|60|to|90|km|mi|-1}}, but to this must be added the peninsula of [[Karaburun|Mimas]], together with the two islands. So intricate is the coastline that the voyage along its shores was estimated at nearly four times the direct distance. A great part of this area was, moreover, occupied by mountains. Of these the most lofty and striking were Mimas and Corycus, in the peninsula which stands out to the west, facing the island of Chios; [[Mount Sipylus|Sipylus]], to the north of Smyrna, Corax, extending to the south-west from the Gulf of Smyrna, and descending to the sea between Lebedus and Teos; and the strongly marked range of [[Mycale]], a continuation of Messogisin the interior, which forms the bold headland of Trogilium or Mycale, opposite Samos. None of these mountains attains a height of more than {{convert|1200|m|ft|-1}}. The district comprised three extremely fertile valleys formed by the outflow of three rivers, among the most considerable in Asia Minor: the [[Hermus]] in the north, flowing into the [[Gulf of Smyrna]], though at some distance from the city of that name; the Caster, which flowed under the walls of Ephesus; and the [[Maeander]], which in ancient times discharged its waters into the deep gulf that once bathed the walls of Miletus, but which has been gradually filled up by this river's deposits. With the advantage of a peculiarly fine climate, for which this part of [[Asia Minor]] has been famous in all ages, Ionia enjoyed the reputation in ancient times of being the most fertile of all the rich provinces of Asia Minor; and even {{as of|1911|alt=in modern times}}, though very imperfectly cultivated, it produces abundance of fruit of all kinds, and the [[raisin]]s and [[ficus|fig]]s of Smyrna supply almost all the markets of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ionia&quot;/&gt;

===Political===
The geography of Ionia placed it in a strategic position that was both advantageous and disadvantageous. Ionia was always a maritime power founded by a people who made their living by trade in peaceful times and marauding in unsettled times. The coast was rocky and the arable land slight. The native Luwians for the most part kept their fields further inland and used the rift valleys for wooded pasture. The coastal cities were placed in defensible positions on islands or headlands situated so as to control inland routes up the rift valleys. The people of those valleys were of different ethnicity. The populations of the cities came from many civilizations in the eastern [[Mediterranean]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Demography==
Ancient demographics are available only from literary sources. [[Herodotus]] states that in Asia the Ionians kept the division into twelve cities that had prevailed in Ionian lands of the north Peloponnese, their former homeland, which became [[Achaea]] after they left.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D145 1.145].&lt;/ref&gt; These twelve cities (aka [[Ionian League]]) were (from south to north) [[Miletus]], [[Myus]], [[Priene]], [[Ephesus]], [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]], [[Lebedos]], [[Teos]], [[Erythrae]], [[Clazomenae]] and [[Phocaea]], together with [[Samos]] and [[Chios]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D142 1.142].&lt;/ref&gt; [[İzmir|Smyrna]], originally an [[Aeolis|Aeolic]] colony, was afterwards occupied by Ionians from Colophon, and became an Ionian city — an event which had taken place before the time of Herodotus.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D143 1.143], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D149 1.149–150].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Art relics from the Ionian cities of Asia.jpg|thumb|left|Art relics from the Ionian cities of Asia]]
These cities do not match those of [[Achaea]]. Moreover, the Achaea of Herodotus' time spoke [[Doric Greek|Doric]] (Corinthian), but in [[Homer]] it is portrayed as being in the kingdom of [[Mycenae]], which most likely spoke [[Mycenaean Greek]], which is not Doric. If the Ionians came from Achaea, they departed during or after the change from East Greek to West Greek there. Mycenaean continued to evolve in the mountainous region of [[Arcadia]].

There is no record of any people named Ionians in [[Bronze Age#Ancient Near East|Late Bronze Age]] Anatolia but [[Hittite texts]] record the Achaeans of [[Achaeans (Homer)#Hittite documents|Ahhiyawa]], of location not completely certain, but in touch with the Hittites of that time. [[Miletus]] and some other cities founded earlier by non-Greeks received populations of [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greeks]] probably under the name of Achaeans. The tradition of Ionian colonizers from Achaea suggests that they may have been known by both names even then. In the absence of archaeological evidence of discontinuity at Miletus the Achaean population whatever their name appears to have descended to archaic Ionia, which does not exclude the possibility of another colonizing and founding event from Athens.

In the Indian (e.g.: Sanskrit) historic literary texts, the Ionians are referred to as [[Yona|&quot;yavana&quot; or &quot;yona&quot;]], and are described as wearing leather and wielding whips.  In modern Turkish, the people of that region and the Greeks were called &quot;yunan&quot; (plural &quot;yunanlar&quot;) and the country that is now Greece is known as &quot;Yunanistan&quot;.

Herodotus expresses some impatience at the ethnic views of his countrymen concerning Ionia: &quot;for it would be foolishness to say that these are more truly Ionian or better born ....&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D146 1.146].&lt;/ref&gt; He lists other ethnic populations among the settlers: Abantes from [[Euboea]], [[Minyans]] from [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenus]], Cadmeians, [[Dryopia]]ns, [[Phocis|Phocians]], [[Molossians]], Arcadian [[Pelasgians]], [[Dorians]] of [[Epidaurus]], and others. The presence of Doric Ionians is somewhat contradictory, but Herodotus himself, a major author of the Ionic dialect, was from a Doric city, [[Halicarnassus]]. Even &quot; the best born of the Ionians&quot;, the Athenians, married girls from [[Caria]]. &quot;Yet since they set more store by the name than the rest of the Ionians, let it be granted that those of pure birth are Ionians.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D147 1.147].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Western Asia Minor Greek Colonization.svg|230px|right|thumb|Greek settlements in western [[Asia Minor]], Ionian area in green.]]
From the 18th century BC the region was a part of the [[Hittite Empire]] with possible name [[Arzawa]], which was destroyed by invaders during the 12th century BC together with the collapse of the Empire. Ionia was settled by the Greeks probably during the 11th century BC. The most important city was [[Miletus]] (the ''Millawanda/Milawata'' of Hittites).
Several centuries later Ionia was the place where [[Western philosophy]] began and was the homeland of [[Thales]], [[Anaximander]], [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] and [[Heraclitus]]. They were natural-philosophers of the [[Ionian School (philosophy)|Ionian School of philosophy]] and tried to explain phenomena according to non-supernatural laws. They also searched for a simple material form behind the appearances of things (origin) and this conception had a great influence on the early archaic art in Greece.

===Settlement===
{{Main|First Greek colonisation}}
During the late 13th century BC the peoples of the [[Aegean Sea]] took to marauding and resettling as a way of life and were called by the Egyptians the [[Sea Peoples]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Mycenaean Greeks must have been among them. They settled lightly on the shores of [[Luwian]] Anatolia often by invitation. In the background was the stabilizing influence of the Hittites, who monitored maritime movement and suppressed piracy. When that power was gone the Luwian people remained in the vacuum as a number of coastal splinter states that were scarcely able now to defend themselves. Ionian Greeks took advantage of opportunities for coastal raiding: an inscription of [[Sargon II]] (ca 709–07, recording a naval expedition of 715) boasts &quot;in the midst of the sea&quot; he had &quot;caught the Ionians like fish and brought peace to the land of Que [[Cilicia]] and the city of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox 2008&quot;&gt;Sargon's inscription in A. Fuchs, ''Die Inschriften Sargons II aus Khorsabad'' (1994:40) noted in Robin Lane Fox, ''Travelling Heroes in the Epic Age of Homer'', 2008:29f.&lt;/ref&gt; For a full generation earlier Assyrian inscriptions had recorded troubles with the Ionians, who escaped on their boats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox 2008&quot; /&gt;

[[Caria]] and [[Lycia]] came to the attention of [[Athens]], most powerful state remaining in Greece, which also had lost its central government ruling from [[Mycenae]], now burned and nearly vacant. Ionians had been expelled from the [[Peloponnesus]] by the [[Dorians]] and had sought refuge in Athens. The Athenian kings decided to relieve the crowding by resettling the coast of Lydia with Ionians from the Peloponnesus under native Athenian leadership.

[[File:Milet_2013-03-25p.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The site of [[Miletus]], once coastal, now inland. The plain was a bay in [[Classical Greece]].]]

They were not the only Greeks to have such a perception and reach such a decision. The [[Aeolians]] of [[Boeotia]] contemporaneously settled the coast to the north of the Ionians and the newly arrived  [[Dorians]] of [[Crete]] and the islands the coast of [[Caria]]. The Greeks descended on the [[Luwians]] of the Anatolian coast in the 10th century BC. The descent was not peaceful and the Luwians were not willing.

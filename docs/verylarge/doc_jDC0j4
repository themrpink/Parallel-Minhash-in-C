The application of pest control agents is usually carried out by dispersing the chemical in a (often hydrocarbon-based) [[solvent]]-[[surfactant]] system to give a homogeneous preparation. A virus lethality study performed in 1977 demonstrated that a particular pesticide did not increase the lethality of the virus, however combinations which included some surfactants and the solvent clearly showed that pretreatment with them markedly increased the viral lethality in the test mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Safe S, Plugge H, Crocker JF |date=1977|title=Analysis of an aromatic solvent used in a forest spray program|journal=Chemosphere|volume=6|issue=10|pages=641–651|doi=10.1016/0045-6535(77)90075-3|bibcode=1977Chmsp...6..641S|issn=0045-6535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pesticides can be classified based upon their biological mechanism function or application method. Most pesticides work by [[poison]]ing pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psep.cce.cornell.edu/Tutorials/core-tutorial/module04/index.aspx|title=Pesticide Applicator Core Tutorial: Module 4 - Toxicity of Pesticides |website=Pesticide Safety Education Program (PSEP)|publisher=[[Cornell University]]|access-date=Dec 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A systemic pesticide moves inside a plant following absorption by the plant. With insecticides and most fungicides, this movement is usually upward (through the [[xylem]]) and outward. Increased efficiency may be a result. Systemic insecticides, which poison [[pollen]] and [[nectar]] in the [[flower]]s, may kill [[bees]] and other needed [[pollinator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| authors = Rortais A, Arnold G, Halm MP, Touffet-Briens F |date=2005|title=Modes of honeybees exposure to systemic insecticides: estimated amounts of contaminated pollen and nectar consumed by different categories of bees|journal=Apidologie|language=en|volume=36|issue=1|pages=71–83|doi=10.1051/apido:2004071 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the development of a new class of fungicides called [[paldoxins]] was announced. These work by taking advantage of natural defense chemicals released by plants called [[phytoalexins]], which fungi then detoxify using enzymes. The paldoxins inhibit the fungi's detoxification enzymes. They are believed to be safer and greener.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-03/acs-np030909.php|title=New 'green' pesticides are first to exploit plant defenses in battle of the fungi|author = American Chemical Society |date=2009|work=EurekAlert!|access-date=Dec 1, 2018|publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Since before 2000 BC, humans have utilized pesticides to protect their crops. The first known pesticide was elemental [[sulfur]] dusting used in ancient Sumer about 4,500 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia. The [[Rigveda]], which is about 4,000 years old, mentions the use of poisonous plants for pest control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rao GV, Rupela OP, Rao VR, Reddy YV |date=2007|title=Role of biopesticides in crop protection: present status and future prospects|url=http://oar.icrisat.org/872/1/Indian_Journal_of_Plant_Protection_35_1_1-9_2007.pdf|journal=Indian Journal of Plant Protection|volume=35|issue=1|pages=1–9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 15th century, toxic chemicals such as [[arsenic]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[lead]] were being applied to crops to kill pests. In the 17th century, [[nicotine]] [[sulfate]] was extracted from [[tobacco]] leaves for use as an insecticide. The 19th century saw the introduction of two more natural pesticides, [[pyrethrum]], which is derived from [[chrysanthemum]]s, and [[rotenone]], which is derived from the roots of tropical [[vegetable]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Living in the Environment| vauthors = Miller GT |publisher=Wadsworth/Thomson Learning|year=2002|isbn=9780534376970|edition=12th|location=Belmont|pages=|oclc=819417923}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 1950s, arsenic-based pesticides were dominant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pinpointing&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/87/8707cover1a.html|title=Pinpointing Trends In Pesticide Use In 1939| vauthors = Ritter SK |work=Chemical &amp; Engineering News|access-date=|publisher=[[American Chemical Society|ACS]]|year=2009|issue=7|volume=87|issn=0009-2347}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Hermann Müller|Paul Müller]] discovered that [[DDT]] was a very effective insecticide. Organochlorines such as DDT were dominant, but they were replaced in the U.S. by organophosphates and carbamates by 1975. Since then, [[pyrethrin]] compounds have become the dominant insecticide.&lt;ref name=Pinpointing/&gt; Herbicides became common in the 1960s, led by &quot;triazine and other nitrogen-based compounds, carboxylic acids such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and glyphosate&quot;.&lt;ref name=Pinpointing/&gt;

In the 1960s, it was discovered that DDT was preventing many fish-eating birds from reproducing, which was a serious threat to [[biodiversity]]. [[Rachel Carson]] wrote the best-selling book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' about [[biological magnification]]. The agricultural use of DDT is now banned under the [[Stockholm Convention]] on Persistent Organic Pollutants, but it is still used in some developing nations to prevent [[malaria]] and other tropical diseases by spraying on interior walls to kill or repel mosquitoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines06/0916-05.htm|title=WHO urges DDT for malaria control Strategies| vauthors = Lobe J |date=Sep 16, 2006|website=Common Dreams News Center|publisher=Inter Press Service|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017195527/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines06/0916-05.htm|archive-date=October 17, 2006|url-status=dead|access-date=Sep 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pesticides are used to control organisms that are considered to be harmful.&lt;ref name=&quot;purdue&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/ppp/ppp-70.pdf|title=The Benefits of Pesticides, A Story Worth Telling|last=Whitford|first=F|publisher=Purdue Extension|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, they are used to kill [[mosquitoes]] that can transmit potentially deadly diseases like [[West Nile virus]], [[yellow fever]], and [[malaria]]. They can also kill [[bee]]s, [[wasp]]s or [[ant]]s that can cause allergic reactions. Insecticides can protect animals from illnesses that can be caused by [[parasitism|parasites]] such as [[flea]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;purdue&quot;/&gt; Pesticides can prevent sickness in humans that could be caused by [[Mold (fungus)|mold]]y food or diseased produce. Herbicides can be used to clear roadside weeds, trees, and brush. They can also kill invasive [[weed]]s that may cause environmental damage. Herbicides are commonly applied in ponds and lakes to control [[algae]] and plants such as water grasses that can interfere with activities like swimming and fishing and cause the water to look or smell unpleasant.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCE&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ext.vt.edu/pubs/waterquality/420-013/420-013.html|title=Pesticides and aquatic animals: A guide to reducing impacts on aquatic systems | vauthors = Helfrich LA, Weigmann DL |date=Jun 1996|website=Virginia Cooperative Extension|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305060503/http://www.ext.vt.edu/pubs/waterquality/420-013/420-013.html|archive-date=March 5, 2009|url-status=dead|access-date=Oct 14, 2007|last3=Hipkins|first3=P|last4=Stinson|first4=ER}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uncontrolled pests such as termites and mold can damage structures such as houses.&lt;ref name=&quot;purdue&quot;/&gt; Pesticides are used in grocery stores and food storage facilities to manage [[rodents]] and insects that infest food such as grain. Each use of a pesticide carries some associated risk. Proper pesticide use decreases these associated risks to a level deemed acceptable by pesticide regulatory agencies such as the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and the [[Pest Management Regulatory Agency]] (PMRA) of Canada.

[[DDT]], sprayed on the walls of houses, is an organochlorine that has been used to fight [[malaria]] since the 1950s. Recent policy statements by the [[World Health Organization]] have given stronger support to this approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2006/pr50/en/|title=WHO gives indoor use of DDT a clean bill of health for controlling malaria | date=Sep 15, 2006|website=[[World Health Organization|WHO]]|access-date=Sep 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, DDT and other organochlorine pesticides have been banned in most countries worldwide because of their persistence in the environment and human toxicity. DDT use is not always effective, as [[Pesticide resistance|resistance to DDT]] was identified in Africa as early as 1955, and by 1972 nineteen species of mosquito worldwide were resistant to DDT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://magazine.panna.org/summer2006/inDepthDDT.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118043120/http://magazine.panna.org/summer2006/inDepthDDT.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-01-18 |title=In Depth: DDT &amp; Malaria |publisher=PAN Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afronets.org/files/malaria.pdf|title=A Story to be Shared: the Successful Fight Against Malaria in Vietnam | date=Nov 6, 2000|publisher=WHO WPRO|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031005062640/http://www.afronets.org/files/malaria.pdf|archive-date=October 5, 2003|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two levels of benefits for pesticide use, primary and secondary. Primary benefits are direct gains from the use of pesticides and secondary benefits are effects that are more long-term.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooper&quot; /&gt;

===Primary benefits===
Controlling [[pest (organism)|pest]]s and plant disease vectors
*Improved crop yields
*Improved crop/livestock quality
*[[Invasive species]] controlled

Controlling human/livestock [[disease vector]]s and nuisance organisms
*Human lives saved and disease reduced.

Pesticide use is widespread in [[Latin America]], as around US$3&amp;nbsp;billion are spent each year in the region. Records indicate an increase in the frequency of pesticide poisonings over the past two decades. The most common incidents of pesticide poisoning is thought to result from exposure to organophosphate and carbamate insecticides.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Laborde|first1=A|last2=Tomasina|first2=F|last3=Bianchi|first3=F|last4=Bruné|first4=M-N|last5=Buka|first5=I|last6=Comba|first6=P|last7=Corra|first7=L|last8=Cori|first8=L|last9=Duffert|first9=CM|display-authors=3|date=2015|title=Children's Health in Latin America: The Influence of Environmental Exposures|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=123|issue=3|pages=201–209|doi=10.1289/ehp.1408292|issn=0091-6765|pmc=4348745|pmid=25499717}}&lt;/ref&gt; At-home pesticide use, use of unregulated products, and the role of undocumented workers within the agricultural industry makes characterizing true pesticide exposure a challenge. It is estimated that 50–80% of pesticide poisoning cases are unreported.

Underreporting of pesticide poisoning is especially common in areas where agricultural workers are less likely to seek care from a healthcare facility that may be monitoring or tracking incidence of acute poisoning. The extent of unintentional pesticide poisoning may be much greater than available data suggest, particularly among developing countries. Globally, agriculture and food production remains one of the largest industries. In East Africa, the agricultural industry represents one of the largest sectors of the economy, with nearly 80% of its population relying on agriculture for income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Agriculture &amp; Food Security|url=https://www.eac.int/agriculture#:~:text=The%20major%20food%20crops%20are,tobacco,%20coconut%20and%20cashew%20nuts.|access-date=2020-11-30|website=www.eac.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers in these communities rely on pesticide products to maintain high crop yields.

In some countries in East Africa, governments are shifting towards commercial agriculture, and opportunities for foreign conglomerates to operate commercial farms has led to more accessible research on pesticide use and exposure among workers.&lt;sup&gt;[source?]&lt;/sup&gt; In other areas where large proportions of the population rely on subsistence, small-scale farming, estimating pesticide use and exposure is more difficult.

===== Pesticide Poisoning =====
[[File:Cholinergic synapse-de.svg|thumb|The cholinergic synapse and the breakdown of [[acetylcholine]] into choline and acetate by acetylcholinesterase.]]
Pesticides may exhibit toxic effects on [[Environmental impact of pesticides#Humans|humans]] and other non-target species, the severity of which depends on the frequency and magnitude of exposure. Toxicity also depends on the rate of absorption, distribution within the body, metabolism, and elimination of compounds from the body. Commonly used pesticides like organophosphates and carbamates act by inhibiting [[acetylcholinesterase]] activity, which prevents the breakdown of [[acetylcholine]] at the neural [[synapse]]. Excess acetylcholine can lead to [[Organophosphate poisoning#Signs and symptoms|symptoms]] like muscle cramps or tremors, confusion, dizziness and nausea. Studies show that farm workers in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Zimbabwe have decreased concentrations of plasma acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme responsible for breaking down acetylcholine acting on synapses throughout the [[nervous system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Mekonnen|first1=Yalemtsehay|last2=Ejigu|first2=D.|date=2005|title=Plasma cholinesterase level of Ethiopian farm workers exposed to chemical pesticide|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16140842/|journal=Occupational Medicine (Oxford, England)|volume=55|issue=6|pages=504–505|doi=10.1093/occmed/kqi088|issn=0962-7480|pmid=16140842|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ohayo-Mitoko|first1=G.

===== Measuring Exposure to Pesticides =====
There are multiple approaches to measuring a person's exposure to pesticides, each of which provides and estimate of an individual's internal dose. Two broad approaches include measuring biomarkers and markers of biological effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;:03&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=He|first=F|date=1999-09-05|title=Biological monitoring of exposure to pesticides: current issues|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378427499000995|journal=Toxicology Letters|volume=108|issue=2–3|pages=277–283|doi=10.1016/S0378-4274(99)00099-5|pmid=10511272}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former involves taking direct measurement of the parent compound or its metabolites in various types of media: urine, blood, serum. Biomarkers may include a direct measurement of the compound in the body before it’s been biotransformed during metabolism. Other suitable biomarkers may include the metabolites of the parent compound after they’ve been biotransformed during metabolism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:03&quot; /&gt; Toxicokinetic data can provide more detailed information on how quickly the compound is metabolized and eliminated from the body, and provide insights into the timing of exposure.

Markers of biological effect provide an estimation of exposure based on cellular activities related to the mechanism of action. For example, many studies investigating exposure to pesticides often involve the quantification of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme at the neural synapse to determine the magnitude of the inhibitory effect of organophosphate and carbamate pesticides.&lt;ref name=&quot;:04&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=He|first=F|date=1999-09-05|title=Biological monitoring of exposure to pesticides: current issues|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378427499000995|journal=Toxicology Letters|volume=108|issue=2–3|pages=277–283|doi=10.1016/S0378-4274(99)00099-5|pmid=10511272}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Mekonnen|first1=Yalemtsehay|last2=Ejigu|first2=D.|date=2005|title=Plasma cholinesterase level of Ethiopian farm workers exposed to chemical pesticide|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16140842/|journal=Occupational Medicine (Oxford, England)|volume=55|issue=6|pages=504–505|doi=10.1093/occmed/kqi088|issn=0962-7480|pmid=16140842|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:332&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ohayo-Mitoko|first1=G.

Another method of quantifying exposure involves measuring, at the molecular level, the amount of pesticide interacting with the site of action. These methods are more commonly used for occupational exposures where the mechanism of action is better understood, as described by WHO guidelines published in “Biological Monitoring of Chemical Exposure in the Workplace&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Health|first=World Health Organization Office of Occupational|url=https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/41856|title=Biological monitoring of chemical exposure in the workplace : guidelines|date=1996|publisher=World Health Organization|hdl=10665/41856|isbn=978-951-802-158-5|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Better understanding of how pesticides elicit their toxic effects is needed before this method of exposure assessment can be applied to occupational exposure of agricultural workers. 

Alternative methods to assess exposure include questionnaires to discern from participants whether they are experiencing symptoms associated with pesticide poisoning. Self-reported symptoms may include headaches, dizziness, nausea, joint pain, or respiratory symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;:333&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ohayo-Mitoko|first1=G.

===== Challenges in Assessing Pesticide Exposure =====
Multiple challenges exist in assessing exposure to pesticides in the general population, and many others that are specific to occupational exposures of agricultural workers. Beyond farm workers, estimating exposure to family members and children presents additional challenges, and may occur through “take-home” exposure from pesticide residues collected on clothing or equipment belonging to parent farm workers and inadvertently brought into the home. Children may also be exposed to pesticides prenatally from mothers who are exposed to pesticides during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Jurewicz|first1=Joanna|last2=Hanke|first2=Wojciech|date=2008-01-01|title=Prenatal and Childhood Exposure to Pesticides and Neurobehavioral Development: Review of Epidemiological Studies|url=http://www.imp.lodz.pl/home_en/publishing_office/journals_/_ijomeh/&amp;articleId=20948&amp;l=PL|journal=International Journal of Occupational Medicine and Environmental Health|volume=21|issue=2|pages=121–32|doi=10.2478/v10001-008-0014-z|pmid=18614459|issn=1896-494X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characterizing children’s exposure resulting from drift of airborne and spray application of pesticides is similarly challenging, yet well documented in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Wesseling|first1=Catharina|last2=De Joode|first2=Berna Van Wendel|last3=Ruepert|first3=Clemens|last4=León|first4=Catalina|last5=Monge|first5=Patricia|last6=Hermosillo|first6=Hernán|last7=Partanen|first7=Limo J.|date=October 2001|title=Paraquat in Developing Countries|url=http://www.maneyonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/oeh.2001.7.4.275|journal=International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health|language=en|volume=7|issue=4|pages=275–286|doi=10.1179/oeh.2001.7.4.275|pmid=11783857|issn=1077-3525}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of critical development periods of the fetus and newborn children, these non-working populations are more vulnerable to the effects of pesticides, and may be at increased risk of developing neurocognitive effects and impaired development.&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=Goldmann|first=L|date=May 2004|title=Childhood Pesticide Poisoning: Information for Advocacy and Action|url=https://www.who.int/ceh/publications/pestpoisoning.pdf|publisher=[[World Health Organization|WHO]]|type=Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:34&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Jurewicz|first1=Joanna|last2=Hanke|first2=Wojciech|date=2008-01-01|title=Prenatal and Childhood Exposure to Pesticides and Neurobehavioral Development: Review of Epidemiological Studies|url=http://www.imp.lodz.pl/home_en/publishing_office/journals_/_ijomeh/&amp;articleId=20948&amp;l=PL|journal=International Journal of Occupational Medicine and Environmental Health|volume=21|issue=2|pages=121–32|doi=10.2478/v10001-008-0014-z|pmid=18614459|issn=1896-494X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While measuring biomarkers or markers of biological effects may provide more accurate estimates of exposure, collecting these data in the field is often impractical and many methods are not sensitive enough to detect low level concentrations. Rapid cholinesterase test kits exist to collect blood samples in the field. Conducting large scale assessments of agricultural workers in remote regions of developing countries makes implementation of these kits a challenge.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=He|first=F|date=1999-09-05|title=Biological monitoring of exposure to pesticides: current issues|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378427499000995|journal=Toxicology Letters|volume=108|issue=2–3|pages=277–283|doi=10.1016/S0378-4274(99)00099-5|pmid=10511272}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cholinesterase assay is a useful clinical tool to assess individual exposure and acute toxicity. However, considerable variability in baseline enzyme activity among individuals makes it difficult to compare field measurements of cholinesterase activity to a [[reference dose]] to determine health risk associated with exposure.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt; Another challenge researchers face in deriving a [[reference dose]] is identifying health endpoints that are relevant to exposure. More epidemiological research is needed to identify critical health endpoints, particularly among populations who are occupationally exposed.  

===== Prevention =====
Minimizing harmful exposure to pesticides can be achieved by proper use of personal protective equipment, adequate reentry times into recently sprayed areas, and effective product labeling for hazardous substances as per [[Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act|FIFRA]] regulations. Training high risk populations, including agricultural workers, on the proper use and storage of pesticides can reduce the incidence of acute pesticide poisoning and potential chronic health effects associated with exposure.  Continued research into the human toxic health effects of pesticides serve as a basis for relevant policies and enforceable [[Pesticide regulation in the United States|standards]] that are health protective to all populations.

===Environmental effects===
{{Main|Environmental effects of pesticides}}
Pesticide use raises a number of environmental concerns. Over 98% of sprayed insecticides and 95% of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species, including non-target species, air, water and soil.&lt;ref name=&quot;sustaining&quot;/&gt; [[Pesticide drift]] occurs when pesticides suspended in the air as particles are carried by wind to other areas, potentially contaminating them.

In one study, the human health and environmental costs due to pesticides in the United States was estimated to be [[Orders of magnitude (currency)|$9.6 billion]]: offset by about $40&amp;nbsp;billion in increased agricultural production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pimental&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pimentel D | year = 2005 | title = Environmental and Economic Costs of the Application of Pesticides Primarily in the United States | url = http://www.beyondpesticides.org/documents/pimentel.pesticides.2005update.pdf | journal = Environment, Development and Sustainability | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 229–252 | doi=10.1007/s10668-005-7314-2| s2cid = 35964365 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional costs include the registration process and the cost of purchasing pesticides: which are typically borne by agrichemical companies and farmers respectively. The registration process can take several years to complete (there are 70 different types of field test) and can cost $50–70&amp;nbsp;million for a single pesticide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pimental&quot; /&gt; At the beginning of the 21st century, the United States spent approximately $10&amp;nbsp;billion on pesticides annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pimental&quot; /&gt;

==Alternatives==
Alternatives to pesticides are available and include methods of cultivation, use of [[biological pest control]]s (such as pheromones and microbial pesticides), [[genetic engineering]], and methods of interfering with insect breeding.&lt;ref name=&quot;sustaining&quot;/&gt; Application of composted yard waste has also been used as a way of controlling pests.&lt;ref name=&quot;nematodes&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McSorley R, Gallaher RN | title = Effect of yard waste compost on nematode densities and maize yield | journal = Journal of Nematology | volume = 28 | issue = 4S | pages = 655–60 | date = December 1996 | pmid = 19277191 | pmc = 2619736 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These methods are becoming increasingly popular and often are safer than traditional chemical pesticides. In addition, EPA is registering reduced-risk conventional pesticides in increasing numbers.

Cultivation practices include [[polyculture]] (growing multiple types of plants), [[crop rotation]], planting crops in areas where the pests that damage them do not live, timing planting according to when pests will be least problematic, and use of [[trap crop]]s that attract pests away from the real crop.&lt;ref name=&quot;sustaining&quot;/&gt; Trap crops have successfully controlled pests in some commercial agricultural systems while reducing pesticide usage;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Shelton AM, Badenes-Perez FR|date=Dec 6, 2005|title=Concepts and applications of trap cropping in pest management|url=|journal=Annual Review of Entomology|volume=51|issue=1|pages=285–308|doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.51.110104.150959|pmid=16332213}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in many other systems, trap crops can fail to reduce pest densities at a commercial scale, even when the trap crop works in controlled experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Holden|first1=Matthew H.|last2=Ellner|first2=Stephen P.|last3=Lee|first3=Doo-Hyung|last4=Nyrop|first4=Jan P.|last5=Sanderson|first5=John P. | name-list-style = vanc |date=2012-06-01|title=Designing an effective trap cropping strategy: the effects of attraction, retention and plant spatial distribution |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|volume=49|issue=3|pages=715–722|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02137.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., farmers have had success controlling insects by spraying with hot water at a cost that is about the same as pesticide spraying.&lt;ref name=&quot;sustaining&quot;/&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=September 2014}}

Release of other organisms that fight the pest is another example of an alternative to pesticide use. These organisms can include natural [[predator]]s or [[parasite]]s of the pests.&lt;ref name=&quot;sustaining&quot;/&gt; [[Biological pesticides]] based on [[entomopathogenic fungi]], [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es causing disease in the pest species can also be used.&lt;ref name=&quot;sustaining&quot;/&gt;

Interfering with insects' reproduction can be accomplished by [[Sterile insect technique|sterilizing males]] of the target species and releasing them, so that they [[mating|mate]] with females but do not produce offspring.&lt;ref name=&quot;sustaining&quot;/&gt; This technique was first used on the [[Cochliomyia hominivorax|screwworm fly]] in 1958 and has since been used with the [[medfly]], the [[tsetse fly]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/B/Biocontrols.html|title=The Biological Control of Pests|date=Jul 25, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921015356/http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/B/Biocontrols.html|archive-date=September 21, 2007|url-status=dead|access-date=Sep 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[gypsy moth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Skylab, Classroom in Space|publisher=[[Marshall Space Flight Center|MSFC]]|year=1977|editor-last=Summerlin|editor-first=Lee B|location=Washington|chapter=Chapter 17: Life Sciences|name-list-style=vanc|access-date=Sep 17, 2007|chapter-url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-401/ch17.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this can be a costly, time-consuming approach that only works on some types of insects.&lt;ref name=&quot;sustaining&quot;/&gt;

===Push pull strategy===
{{main|Push–pull technology}}

The term &quot;push-pull&quot; was established in 1987 as an approach for [[integrated pest management]] (IPM). This strategy uses a mixture of behavior-modifying stimuli to manipulate the distribution and abundance of insects. &quot;Push&quot; means the insects are repelled or deterred away from whatever resource that is being protected. &quot;Pull&quot; means that certain stimuli (semiochemical stimuli, pheromones, food additives, visual stimuli, genetically altered plants, etc.) are used to attract pests to trap crops where they will be killed.&lt;ref name=PushPull&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cook SM, Khan ZR, Pickett JA | title = The use of push-pull strategies in integrated pest management | journal = Annual Review of Entomology | volume = 52 | issue = 1 | pages = 375–400 | year = 2007 | pmid = 16968206 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ento.52.110405.091407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous different components involved in order to implement a Push-Pull Strategy in IPM.

Many case studies testing the effectiveness of the push-pull approach have been done across the world. The most successful push-pull strategy was developed in Africa for subsistence farming. Another successful case study was performed on the control of ''Helicoverpa'' in cotton crops in Australia. In Europe, the Middle East, and the United States, push-pull strategies were successfully used in the controlling of ''Sitona lineatus'' in bean fields.&lt;ref name=PushPull/&gt;

Encouraged by the defeat, Austria, Prussia, and Russia formed the Sixth Coalition and began a new campaign against France, decisively defeating Napoleon at [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]] in October 1813 after several inconclusive engagements. The Allies then invaded France from the east, while the Peninsular War spilled over into southwestern France. Coalition troops captured Paris at the end of March 1814 and [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1814)|forced Napoleon to abdicate]] in April. He was exiled to the island of [[Principality of Elba|Elba]], and the [[Bourbon Restoration|Bourbons were restored to power]]. But Napoleon escaped in February 1815, and reassumed control of France for around [[Hundred Days|one hundred days]]. After forming the Seventh Coalition, the Allies defeated him permanently at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] in June 1815 and exiled him to [[Saint Helena]], where he died six years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;zamoy&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zamoyski |first1=Adam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NqVKDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT480 |title=Napolean: A Life |date=16 October 2018 |publisher=Basic Books |page=480 |location=London |isbn=9780465055937 |access-date=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Congress of Vienna]] redrew the borders of Europe and brought a period of relative peace. The wars had profound consequences on global history, including the spread of [[nationalism]] and [[liberalism]], the rise of Britain as the world's [[Pax Britannica|foremost naval and economic power]], the appearance of [[Decolonization of the Americas|independence movements]] in Latin America and subsequent collapse of the [[Spanish Empire]] and [[Portuguese Empire]], the fundamental reorganisation of German and Italian territories into larger states, and the introduction of radically new methods of conducting warfare, as well as [[Napoleonic Code#Codes in other countries|civil law]].

Britain ended the [[Treaty of Amiens]] and declared war on France in May 1803. Among the reasons were Napoleon's changes to the international system in Western Europe, especially in Switzerland, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. Historian [[Frederick Kagan]] argues that Britain was irritated in particular by Napoleon's assertion of [[Switzerland in the Napoleonic era|control over Switzerland]]. Furthermore, Britons felt insulted when Napoleon stated that their country deserved no voice in European affairs, even though King George III was an [[Prince-elector|elector]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. For its part, Russia decided that the intervention in Switzerland indicated that Napoleon was not looking toward a peaceful resolution of his differences with the other European powers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frederick Kagan 2007 pp 42-43&quot;/&gt;

The British hastily enforced a [[naval blockade]] of France to starve it of resources. Napoleon responded with [[Continental System|economic embargoes against Britain]], and sought to eliminate Britain's Continental allies to break the coalitions arrayed against him. The so-called ''[[Continental System]]'' formed a [[Second League of Armed Neutrality|league of armed neutrality]] to disrupt the blockade and enforce [[free trade]] with France. The British responded by [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|capturing the Danish fleet]], breaking up the league, and later [[Battle of Trafalgar|secured dominance over the seas]], allowing it to freely continue its strategy. Napoleon won the [[War of the Third Coalition]] at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], forcing the [[Austrian Empire]] [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|out of the war]] and formally dissolving the Holy Roman Empire. Within months, [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] declared war, triggering a [[War of the Fourth Coalition]]. This war ended disastrously for Prussia, [[Battle of Jena–Auerstedt|defeated and occupied]] within 19 days of the beginning of the campaign. Napoleon subsequently defeated Russia at [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]], creating powerful client states in Eastern Europe and ending the fourth coalition.

Concurrently, the refusal of [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]] to commit to the Continental System, and Spain's failure to maintain it, led to the [[Peninsular War]] and the outbreak of the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]]. The French occupied Spain and formed a [[Kingdom of Spain under Joseph Bonaparte|Spanish client kingdom]], ending the alliance between the two. Heavy British involvement in the Iberian Peninsula soon followed, while a [[Walcheren Expedition|British effort to capture Antwerp]] failed. Napoleon oversaw the situation in Iberia, [[Battle of Somosierra|defeating the Spanish]], and [[Battle of Corunna|expelling the British]] from the Peninsula. Austria, keen to recover territory lost during the [[War of the Third Coalition]], invaded France's client states in Eastern Europe. Napoleon defeated the fifth coalition at [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]].

Anger at British naval actions led the United States to declare war on Britain in the [[War of 1812]], but it did not become an ally of France. Grievances over control of Poland, and Russia's withdrawal from the [[Continental System]], led to [[French invasion of Russia|Napoleon invading Russia]] in June 1812. The invasion was an unmitigated disaster for Napoleon; [[Scorched-earth|scorched earth]] tactics, desertion, [[Battle of Borodino|French strategic failures]] and the onset of the Russian winter [[French invasion of Russia#Retreat and losses|compelled Napoleon to retreat with massive losses]]. Napoleon suffered further setbacks; French power in the Iberian Peninsula was broken at [[Battle of Vitoria]] the following summer, and a new coalition began the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]].

The coalition defeated Napoleon at [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]], precipitating his fall from power and eventual abdication on 6 April 1814. The victors exiled Napoleon to [[Elba]] and [[Bourbon Restoration|restored the Bourbon monarchy]]. Napoleon escaped from Elba in 1815, gathering enough support to overthrow the monarchy of [[Louis XVIII]], triggering a [[War of the Seventh Coalition|seventh, and final, coalition against him]]. Napoleon was [[Battle of Waterloo|decisively defeated at Waterloo]], and he abdicated again on 22 June. On 15 July, he surrendered to the British at [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]], and was permanently exiled to remote [[Saint Helena]]. The [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris]], signed on 20 November 1815, formally ended the war.

The [[Bourbon Restoration|Bourbon monarchy was restored once more]], and the victors began the [[Congress of Vienna]], to restore peace to the continent. As a direct result of the war, the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] rose to become a [[Great Power|great power]] on the continent,&lt;ref name=&quot;auto3&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FEDKAgAAQBAJ&amp;q=napoleonic+wars+rise+of+prussia&amp;pg=PA255|title=The Rise of Prussia 1700–1830|isbn=9781317887034|last1=Dwyer|first1=Philip G.|date=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Great Britain, with its unequalled [[Royal Navy]] and growing [[British Empire|Empire]] became the world's dominant [[superpower]], beginning the ''[[Pax Britannica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Niall|year=2004|title=Empire, The rise and demise of the British world order and the lessons for global power|url=https://archive.org/details/empire00nial|url-access=registration|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0-465-02328-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Holy Roman Empire]] was dissolved, and the philosophy of [[nationalism]], that emerged early in the war, greatly contributed to the later [[Unification of Germany|unification of the German states]], [[Italian unification|and those of the Italian peninsula]].

Due to the longevity of the wars, the extent of Napoleon's conquests, and the popularity of the ideals of the [[French Revolution]], the ideals had a deep impact on European social culture. Many subsequent revolutions, such as that of [[Russian Revolution|Russia]], looked to the French as their source of inspiration,&lt;ref&gt;Dmitry Shlapentokh, ''The French Revolution and the Russian Anti-Democratic Tradition'' (Edison, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 1997), p. 220-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.R.

==Background==
{{See also|French Revolutionary Wars}}
[[File:Valmy Battle painting.jpg|thumb|French victory over the Prussians at the [[Battle of Valmy]] in 1792]]
The outbreak of the French Revolution had been received with great alarm by the rulers of Europe's continental powers, which had been further exacerbated by the [[Execution of Louis XVI|execution of Louis XVI of France]], and the [[French First Republic|overthrow of the French monarchy]]. In 1793, the [[Austrian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the [[Spanish Empire]], and the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] formed the [[First Coalition]] to curtail the growing unrest in France. Measures such as [[Levée en masse|mass conscription]], military reforms, and total war allowed France to defeat the coalition, despite the [[War in the Vendée|concurrent civil war in France]]. [[Napoleon]], then a general in the French army, forced the Austrians to sign the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], leaving only Great Britain opposed to the fledgling French Republic.

A [[War of the Second Coalition|Second Coalition]] was formed in 1798 by Great Britain, [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Papal States]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], and [[Kingdom of Sweden|Sweden]]. The French Republic, under the [[French Directory|Directory]], suffered from heavy levels of corruption and [[Chouannerie|internal strife]]. The new republic also lacked funds, and no longer enjoyed the services of [[Lazare Carnot]], the minister of war who had guided France to its victories during the early stages of the [[French Revolutionary Wars|Revolution]]. Bonaparte, commander of the [[Armée d'Italie]] in the latter stages of the First Coalition, had [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|launched a campaign in Egypt]], intending to disrupt the British economic powerhouse of [[British India|India]]. Pressed from all sides, the Republic suffered a string of successive defeats against revitalised enemies, supported by Britain's financial help.

[[File:Napoleon at the Battle of Rivoli.jpg|thumb|Bonaparte defeating the Austrians at the [[Battle of Rivoli]] in 1797]]
Bonaparte returned to France from Egypt on 23 August 1799, his [[Battle of the Nile|campaign there having failed]]. He seized control of the French government on 9 November, in [[coup of 18 Brumaire|a bloodless coup d'état]], replacing the Directory with the [[French Consulate|Consulate]] and transforming the republic into a ''de facto'' dictatorship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge University Press&quot;/&gt; He further reorganised the French military forces, establishing a large reserve army positioned to support campaigns on the [[Rhine]] or in [[Italy]]. [[Second Battle of Zurich|Russia had already been knocked out of the war]], and, under Napoleon's leadership, the French [[Battle of Marengo|decisively defeated the Austrians in June 1800]], crippling Austrian capabilities in Italy. Austria was [[Battle of Hohenlinden|definitively defeated that December]], by Moreau's forces in Bavaria. The Austrian defeat was sealed by the [[Treaty of Lunéville]] early the following year, further compelling the British to sign the [[Treaty of Amiens]] with France, establishing a tenuous peace.

===Start date and nomenclature===
No consensus exists as to when the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] ended and the Napoleonic Wars began. Possible dates include 9 November 1799, when Bonaparte [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|seized power on 18 Brumaire]], the date according to the [[French Republican Calendar|Republican Calendar]] then in use;&lt;ref&gt;Frank McLynn, ''Napoleon'' (1998). p 215.&lt;/ref&gt; 18 May 1803, when Britain and France ended the one short period of peace between 1792 and 1814; or 2 December 1804, when Bonaparte crowned himself Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Spencer C. Tucker|title=The Encyclopedia of the War Of 1812|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VljA5QEI9_wC&amp;pg=PA499|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=499|isbn=9781851099573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British historians occasionally refer to the nearly continuous period of warfare from 1792 to 1815 as the Great French War, or as the final phase of the Anglo-French [[Second Hundred Years' War]], spanning the period 1689 to 1815.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur H. Buffinton, ''The Second Hundred Years' War, 1689–1815''  (1929). See also: Francois Crouzet, &quot;The Second Hundred Years War: Some Reflections&quot;. ''French History'' 10 (1996), pp. 432–450. and H. M. Scott, &quot;Review: The Second 'Hundred Years War' 1689–1815&quot;. ''The Historical Journal'' 35 (1992), pp. 443–469.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Mike Rapport (2013) suggested to use the term &quot;French Wars&quot; to unambiguously describe the entire period from 1792 to 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rapport |first=Mike |date=2013 |title=The Napoleonic Wars: A Very Short Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wPK7XxVwF6YC&amp;pg=PA4 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=4 |isbn=9780191642517 |access-date=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the Napoleonic Wars are generally integrated with the French Revolutionary Wars: ''{{lang|fr|Les guerres de la Révolution et de l'Empire}}''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herodote.net/histoire/synthese.php?ID=560 France – Les guerres de la Révolution et de l'Empire]. Herodote.net. Retrieved on 12 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

German historiography may count the War of the Second Coalition (1798/9–1801/2), during which Napoleon seized power, as the ''Erster Napoleonischer Krieg'' (&quot;First Napoleonic War&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rabich |first=Adalbert |date=2011 |title=Die Regionalgeschichte von Dülmen und Umgebung, Teil 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TmA1lqBCMlwC&amp;q=&quot;erster+napoleonischer+krieg&quot;&amp;pg=PA37 |location=Norderstedt |publisher=GRIN Verlag |page=37 |isbn=9783640805846 |access-date=29 May 2016 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Dutch historiography, it is common to refer to the seven major wars between 1792 and 1815 as the [[Coalition Wars]] (''coalitieoorlogen''), referring to the first two as the French Revolution Wars (''Franse Revolutieoorlogen'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Encarta coalitieoorlogen&quot;&gt;{{in lang|nl}} Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993–2002) s.v. &quot;coalitieoorlogen&quot;. Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Napoleon's tactics===
Napoleon was, and remains, famous for his battlefield victories, and historians have spent enormous attention in analysing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Chandler |title=The Campaigns of Napoleon. The Mind and Method of History's Greatest Soldier |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan |year=1966 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Donald Sutherland wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ideal Napoleonic battle was to manipulate the enemy into an unfavourable position through manoeuvre and deception, force him to commit his main forces and reserve to the main battle and then undertake an enveloping attack with uncommitted or reserve troops on the flank or rear. Such a surprise attack would either produce a devastating effect on morale, or force him to weaken his main battle line. Either way, the enemy's own impulsiveness began the process by which even a smaller French army could defeat the enemy's forces one by one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Donald M. G. |last=Sutherland |title=The French Revolution and Empire: The Quest for a Civic Order |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DuwHSN9QTroC&amp;pg=PA356 |year=2008 |publisher=Wiley |page=356|isbn=9780470758267 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After 1807, Napoleon's creation of a highly mobile, well-armed artillery force gave artillery usage increased tactical importance. Napoleon, rather than relying on infantry to wear away the enemy's defences, could now use massed artillery as a spearhead to pound a break in the enemy's line. Once that was achieved he sent in infantry and cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Bruce |last=McConachy |s2cid=159945703 |title=The Roots of Artillery Doctrine: Napoleonic Artillery Tactics Reconsidered |journal=[[Journal of Military History]] |year=2001 |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=617–640 |jstor=2677528 |doi=10.2307/2677528 }} McConachy rejects the alternative theory that growing reliance on artillery by the French army beginning in 1807 was an outgrowth of the declining quality of the French infantry and, later, France's inferiority in cavalry numbers.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude==
[[File:Battle of zurich.jpg|thumb|French victory over the Austrians and Russians at the [[Second Battle of Zurich|Second Battle of Zürich]]]]
Britain was irritated by several French actions following the [[Treaty of Amiens]]. Bonaparte had annexed [[Piedmont]] and [[Elba]], made himself President of the [[Italian Republic (Napoleonic)|Italian Republic]], a state in northern Italy that France had set up, and failed to evacuate Holland, as it had agreed to do in the treaty. France continued to interfere with British trade despite peace having been made and complained about Britain harbouring certain individuals and not cracking down on the anti-French press.&lt;ref name=register&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NNU7AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA646&amp;dq=annual+register+1803&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IQS8VNa2Lo2TsQS04YDoDg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Annual Register... for the Year 1803] (1805)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|220–239}}

[[Malta]] had been captured by Britain during the war and was subject to a complex arrangement in the 10th article of the Treaty of Amiens where it was to be restored to the [[Knights of St. John]] with a Neapolitan garrison and placed under the guarantee of third powers. The weakening of the Knights of St. John by the confiscation of their assets in France and Spain along with delays in obtaining guarantees prevented the British from evacuating it after three months as stipulated in the treaty.&lt;ref name=register/&gt;{{rp|239–247}}

[[File:Philip James de Loutherbourg - The Battle of Alexandria, 21 March 1801 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|The British victory over the French at the [[Battle of Alexandria]], resulted in the end of [[Napoleon]]'s military presence in Egypt.]]
The [[Helvetic Republic]] had been set up by France when it [[French invasion of Switzerland|invaded Switzerland in 1798]]. France had withdrawn its troops, but [[Stecklikrieg|violent strife broke out against the government]], which many Swiss saw as overly centralised. Bonaparte reoccupied the country in October 1802 and [[Act of Mediation|imposed a compromise settlement]]. This caused widespread outrage in Britain, which protested that this was a violation of the Treaty of Lunéville. Although continental powers were unprepared to act, the British decided to send an agent to help the Swiss obtain supplies, and also ordered their military not to return [[Cape Colony]] to Holland as they had committed to do in the Treaty of Amiens.&lt;ref name=register/&gt;{{rp|248–252}}

Swiss resistance collapsed before anything could be accomplished, and after a month Britain countermanded the orders not to restore Cape Colony. At the same time Russia finally joined the guarantee with regards to Malta. Concerned that there would be hostilities when Bonaparte found out that Cape Colony had been [[Battle of Muizenberg|retained]], the British began to procrastinate on the evacuation of Malta.&lt;ref name=register/&gt;{{rp|252–258}} In January 1803 a government paper in France published a report from a commercial agent which noted the ease with which Egypt could be conquered. The British seized on this to demand satisfaction and security before evacuating Malta, which was a convenient stepping stone to Egypt. France disclaimed any desire to seize Egypt and asked what sort of satisfaction was required but the British were unable to give a response.&lt;ref name=register/&gt;{{rp|258–264}} There was still no thought of going to war; Prime Minister Addington publicly affirmed that Britain was in a state of peace.&lt;ref name=register/&gt;{{rp|265}}

In early March 1803 the Addington ministry received word that Cape Colony had been [[Battle of Blaauwberg|re-occupied]] by the British army in accordance with the orders which had subsequently been countermanded. On 8 March they ordered military preparations to guard against possible French retaliation, and justified them by falsely claiming that it was only in response to French preparations and that they were conducting serious negotiations with France. In a few days it was known that Cape Colony had been surrendered in accordance with the counter-orders, but it was too late. Bonaparte berated the British ambassador in front of 200 spectators over the military preparations.&lt;ref name=register/&gt;{{rp|264–268}}

The Addington ministry realised they would face an inquiry over their false reasons for the military preparations, and during April unsuccessfully attempted to secure the support of [[William Pitt the Younger]] to shield them from damage.&lt;ref name=register/&gt;{{rp|277}} In the same month the ministry issued an ultimatum to France demanding the retention of Malta for at least ten years, the permanent acquisition of the island of [[Lampedusa]] from the Kingdom of Sicily, and the evacuation of Holland. They also offered to recognise French gains in Italy if they evacuated Switzerland and compensated the King of Sardinia for his territorial losses. France offered to place Malta in the hands of Russia to satisfy British concerns, pull out of Holland when Malta was evacuated, and form a convention to give satisfaction to Britain on other issues. The British falsely denied that Russia had made an offer and their ambassador left Paris.&lt;ref name=register/&gt;{{rp|268–278}} Desperate to avoid war, Bonaparte sent a secret offer where he agreed to let Britain retain Malta if France could occupy the Otranto peninsula in Naples.&lt;ref&gt;Mahan, A.T. [https://archive.org/stream/influenceofsea02maha#page/106/mode/1up The influence of sea power on the French Revolution and Empire] Vol. II (1892) pp. 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; All efforts were futile and Britain declared war on 18 May 1803.

==War between Britain and France, 1803–1814==
{{Main|United Kingdom in the Napoleonic Wars}}

===British motivations===
Britain ended the uneasy truce created by the Treaty of Amiens when it declared war on France in May 1803. The British were increasingly angered by Napoleon's reordering of the international system in Western Europe, especially in Switzerland, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Kagan argues that Britain was especially alarmed by Napoleon's assertion of control over Switzerland. The British felt insulted when Napoleon said it deserved no voice in European affairs (even though King George was an elector of the Holy Roman Empire), and sought to restrict the London newspapers that were vilifying him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frederick Kagan 2007 pp 42-43&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Maniac-Ravings-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|left|&quot;Maniac-raving's-or-Little Boney in a strong fit&quot; by [[James Gillray]]. His caricatures ridiculing Napoleon greatly annoyed the Frenchman, who wanted them suppressed by the British government.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Roberts, ''Napoleon: A Life'' (2014) p 316&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Britain had a sense of loss of control, as well as loss of markets, and was worried by Napoleon's possible threat to its overseas colonies. McLynn argues that Britain went to war in 1803 out of a &quot;mixture of economic motives and national neuroses – an irrational anxiety about Napoleon's motives and intentions.&quot; McLynn concludes that it proved to be the right choice for Britain, because in the long run Napoleon's intentions were hostile to the British national interest. Napoleon was not ready for war and so this was the best time for Britain to stop them. Britain seized upon the Malta issue, refusing to follow the terms of the Treaty of Amiens and evacuate the island.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, ''Napoleon: A Life'' (2014) p 309&lt;/ref&gt;

There was one serious attempt to negotiate peace with France during the war, made by [[Charles James Fox]] in 1806. The British wanted to retain their overseas conquests and have Hanover restored to George III in exchange for accepting French conquests on the continent. The French were willing to cede Malta, Cape Colony, [[Tobago]], and [[French India]]n posts to Britain but wanted to obtain Sicily in exchange for the restoration of Hanover, a condition the British refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J9g7AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA692|title=The Annual Register, Or, A View of the History, Politics, and Literature for ...|year=1808}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike its many coalition partners, Britain remained at war throughout the period of the Napoleonic Wars. Protected by naval supremacy (in the words of Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Jervis]] to the House of Lords &quot;I do not say, my Lords, that the French will not come. I say only they will not come by sea&quot;), Britain did not have to spend the entire war defending itself and could therefore focus on supporting its embattled allies, maintaining low-intensity land warfare on a global scale for over a decade. The British government paid out large sums of money to other European states, so that they could pay armies in the field against France. These payments are colloquially known as the [[Golden Cavalry of St George]]. The British Army provided long-term support to the Spanish rebellion in the Peninsular War of 1808–1814, assisted by Spanish [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] ('little war') tactics. Anglo-Portuguese forces under [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]] supported the Spanish, which campaigned successfully against the French armies, eventually driving them from Spain and allowing Britain to invade southern France. By 1815, the British Army played the central role in the final defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo.
[[File:BritishEmpire1815.png|thumb|260px|The British managed to occupy and take control of [[Cape Colony]], [[British Guiana]], [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], [[British Mauritius|Mauritius]] and [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]] during the Napoleonic Wars.]]
Beyond minor naval actions against British imperial interests, the Napoleonic Wars were much less global in scope than preceding conflicts such as the [[Seven Years' War]], which historians term a &quot;[[world war]]&quot;.

===Economic warfare===
In response to the naval blockade of the French coasts enacted by the British government on 16 May 1806, Napoleon issued the [[Berlin Decree]] on 21 November 1806, which brought into effect the [[Continental System]].&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, ''The Transformation of European Politics 1763–1848'' (1994) pp&amp;nbsp;307–10&lt;/ref&gt; This policy aimed to eliminate the threat from Britain by closing French-controlled territory to its trade. Britain maintained a standing army of 220,000 at the height of the Napoleonic Wars, of whom less than half were available for campaigning. The rest were necessary for garrisoning Ireland and the colonies, and providing security for Britain. France's strength peaked at around 2,500,000 full-time and part-time soldiers including several hundred thousand National Guardsmen whom Napoleon could draft into the military if necessary. Both nations enlisted large numbers of sedentary militia who were unsuited for campaigning, and were mostly employed to release regular forces for active duty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul Kennedy 1989 pp. 128&quot;&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers – economic change and military conflict from 1500 to 2000'' (1989), pp. 128–9&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Navy disrupted France's extra-continental trade by seizing and threatening French shipping and [[French colonial empire|colonial possessions]], but could do nothing about France's trade with the major continental economies and posed little threat to French territory in Europe. France's population and agricultural capacity far outstripped that of Britain. Britain had the greatest industrial capacity in Europe, and its mastery of the seas allowed it to build up considerable economic strength through trade. This ensured that France could never consolidate its control over Europe in peace. Many in the French government believed that cutting Britain off from the Continent would end its economic influence over Europe and isolate it.

===Financing the war===
A key element in British success was its ability to mobilise the nation's industrial and financial resources and apply them to defeating France. Although the UK had a population of approximately 16&amp;nbsp;million against France's 30&amp;nbsp;million, the French numerical advantage was offset by British subsidies that paid for many of the Austrian and Russian soldiers, peaking at about 450,000 men in 1813.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul Kennedy 1989 pp. 128&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John M. Sherwig, ''Guineas and Gunpowder British Foreign Aid in the War with France, 1793–1815'' (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Anglo-Russian agreement of 1803, Britain paid a subsidy of £1.5&amp;nbsp;million for every 100,000 Russian soldiers in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Palmer, ''Alexander I'' (1974) p 86&lt;/ref&gt;

British national output remained strong, and the well-organised business sector channeled products into what the military needed. Britain used its economic power to expand the Royal Navy, doubling the number of [[frigate]]s, adding 50% more large [[ship of the line|ships of the line]], and increasing the number of sailors from 15,000 to 133,000 in eight years after the war began in 1793. France saw its navy shrink by more than half.&lt;ref&gt;Asa Briggs, ''The Making of Modern England 1783–1867: The Age of Improvement'' (1959) p 143&lt;/ref&gt; The smuggling of finished products into the continent undermined French efforts to weaken the British economy by cutting off markets. Subsidies to Russia and Austria kept them in the war. The British budget in 1814 reached £98&amp;nbsp;million, including £10&amp;nbsp;million for the Royal Navy, £40&amp;nbsp;million for the army, £10&amp;nbsp;million for the allies, and £38&amp;nbsp;million as interest on the national debt, which soared to £679&amp;nbsp;million, more than double the GDP. This debt was supported by hundreds of thousands of investors and taxpayers, despite the higher taxes on land and a new income tax. The cost of the war came to £831&amp;nbsp;million.{{refn|£3 trillion in modern economic cost terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/relativevalue.php?use2=a%3A5%3A{i%3A0%3Bs%3A3%3A%22CPI%22%3Bi%3A1%3Bs%3A6%3A%22DEFIND%22%3Bi%3A2%3Bs%3A4%3A%22WAGE%22%3Bi%3A3%3Bs%3A5%3A%22GDPCP%22%3Bi%3A4%3Bs%3A4%3A%22GDPC%22%3B}&amp;amount=0.831&amp;year_source=1815&amp;year_result=2016&amp;button=Submit|title=Measuring Worth – Purchase Power of the Pound|access-date=15 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601215026/https://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/relativevalue.php?use2=a%3A5%3A%7Bi%3A0%3Bs%3A3%3A%22CPI%22%3Bi%3A1%3Bs%3A6%3A%22DEFIND%22%3Bi%3A2%3Bs%3A4%3A%22WAGE%22%3Bi%3A3%3Bs%3A5%3A%22GDPCP%22%3Bi%3A4%3Bs%3A4%3A%22GDPC%22%3B%7D&amp;amount=0.831&amp;year_source=1815&amp;year_result=2016&amp;button=Submit|archive-date=1 June 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} In contrast, the French financial system was inadequate and Napoleon's forces had to rely in part on requisitions from conquered lands.&lt;ref&gt;Élie Halévy, ''A History of the English People in 1815'' (1924) vol 2 p&amp;nbsp;205–28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Knight, ''Britain Against Napoleon: The Organisation of Victory, 1793–1815''  (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.

From London in 1813 to 1815, [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild]] was instrumental in almost single-handedly financing the British war effort, organising the shipment of bullion to the Duke of Wellington's armies across Europe, as well as arranging the payment of British financial subsidies to their continental allies.&lt;ref&gt;''The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World'', (London 2008), page 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before he could invade, he needed to achieve naval superiority—or at least to pull the British fleet away from the [[English Channel]]. A complex plan to distract the British by threatening their possessions in the [[West Indies]] failed when a Franco-Spanish fleet under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles de Villeneuve|Villeneuve]] turned back after an indecisive action off [[battle of Cape Finisterre (1805)|Cape Finisterre]] on 22 July 1805. The Royal Navy blockaded Villeneuve in [[Cádiz]] until he left for Naples on 19 October; the British squadron caught and overwhelmingly defeated the combined enemy fleet in the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] on 21 October (the British commander, [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]], died in the battle). Napoleon never again had the opportunity to challenge the British at sea, nor to threaten an invasion. He again turned his attention to enemies on the Continent.

[[File:Strategic Situation of Europe 1805.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|left|European strategic situation in 1805 before the War of the Third Coalition]]

In April 1805, Britain and Russia signed a treaty with the aim of removing the French from the [[Batavian Republic]] (roughly present-day Netherlands) and the [[Swiss Confederation (Napoleonic)|Swiss Confederation]]. Austria joined the alliance after the annexation of [[Genoa]] and the proclamation of Napoleon as [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|King of Italy]] on 17 March 1805. Sweden, which had already agreed to lease [[Swedish Pomerania]] as a military base for British troops against France, entered the coalition on 9 August.

The Austrians began the war by invading [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]] on 8 September&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=ВЕЛИКИЕ БИТВЫ ВЕЛИКОЙ РОСИИ|last=Сизенко|first=А.Г.|year=2011|isbn=978-5-9567-1173-6|pages=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1805 with an army of about 70,000 under [[Karl Mack von Leiberich]], and the French army marched out from [[Camp of Boulogne|Boulogne]] in late July 1805 to confront them. At [[Battle of Ulm|Ulm]] (25 September&amp;nbsp;– 20 October) Napoleon surrounded Mack's army, forcing its surrender without significant losses.

With the main Austrian army north of the [[Alps]] defeated ([[Armee von Italien|another army]] under [[Archduke Charles of Austria|Archduke Charles]] fought against [[André Masséna]]'s [[Army of Italy (France)|French army in Italy]]), Napoleon occupied [[Vienna]] on 13 November. Far from his supply lines, he faced a larger Austro-Russian army under the command of [[Mikhail Kutuzov]], with the Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]] personally present. On 2 December, Napoleon crushed the Austro-Russian force in [[Moravia]] at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] (usually considered his greatest victory). He inflicted 25,000 casualties on a numerically superior enemy army while sustaining fewer than 7,000 in his own force.

Austria signed the [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]] (26 December 1805) and left the coalition. The treaty required the Austrians to give up [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]] to the French-dominated [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] and the [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]] to Bavaria. With the withdrawal of Austria from the war, stalemate ensued. Napoleon's army had a record of continuous unbroken victories on land, but the full force of the Russian army had not yet come into play. Napoleon had now consolidated his hold on France, had taken control of Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and most of Western Germany and northern Italy. His admirers say that Napoleon wanted to stop now, but was forced to continue in order to gain greater security from the countries that refused to accept his conquests. Esdaille rejects that explanation and instead says that it was a good time to stop expansion, for the major powers were ready to accept Napoleon as he was:
: in 1806 both Russia and Britain had been positively eager to make peace, and they might well have agreed to terms that would have left the Napoleonic imperium almost completely intact. As for Austria and Prussia, they simply wanted to be left alone. To have secured a compromise peace, then, would have been comparatively easy. But Napoleon was prepared to make no concessions.&lt;ref&gt;Esdaille, ''Napoleon's Wars'', pp 252–53&lt;/ref&gt;

==War of the Fourth Coalition 1806–1807==
{{Main|War of the Fourth Coalition}}
[[File:Charles Meynier - Entrée de Napoléon à Berlin. 27 octobre 1806.jpg|thumb|After defeating Prussian forces at [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena]], the French Army entered Berlin on 27 October 1806.]]

Within months of the collapse of the Third Coalition, the [[Fourth Coalition]] (1806–07) against France was formed by Britain, Prussia, Russia, Saxony, and Sweden. In July 1806, Napoleon formed the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] out of the many tiny German states which constituted the [[Rhineland]] and most other western parts of Germany. He amalgamated many of the smaller states into larger electorates, duchies, and kingdoms to make the governance of non-Prussian Germany smoother. Napoleon elevated the rulers of the two largest Confederation states, [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]], to the status of kings.

In August 1806, the Prussian king, [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]], decided to go to war independently of any other great power. The army of Russia, a Prussian ally, in particular was too far away to assist. On 8 October 1806, Napoleon unleashed all the French forces east of the Rhine into Prussia. Napoleon defeated a Prussian army at [[Battle of Jena|Jena]] (14 October 1806), and [[Louis-Nicolas Davout|Davout]] defeated another at [[Battle of Auerstädt|Auerstädt]] on the same day. 160,000 French soldiers (increasing in number as the campaign went on) attacked Prussia, moving with such speed that they destroyed the entire Prussian army as an effective military force. Out of 250,000 troops the Prussians sustained 25,000 casualties, lost a further 150,000 as prisoners, 4,000 artillery pieces, and over 100,000 muskets. At Jena, Napoleon had fought only a detachment of the Prussian force. The battle at Auerstädt involved a single French corps defeating the bulk of the Prussian army. Napoleon entered Berlin on 27 October 1806. He visited the tomb of [[Frederick the Great]] and instructed his marshals to remove their hats there, saying, &quot;If he were alive we wouldn't be here today&quot;. Napoleon had taken only 19 days from beginning his attack on Prussia to knock it out of the war with the capture of Berlin and the destruction of its principal armies at Jena and Auerstädt. Saxony left Prussia, and together with small states from north Germany, allied with France.

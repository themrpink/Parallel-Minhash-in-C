&lt;!-- Definition  and medical uses--&gt;
'''Caesarean section''', also known as '''C-section''', or '''caesarean delivery''', is the [[Surgery|surgical procedure]] by which a baby is [[Childbirth|delivered]] through an incision in the mother's abdomen, often performed because [[vaginal delivery]] would put the baby or mother at risk.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIH2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date=1 February 2017|title=Pregnancy Labor and Birth|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/childbirth-and-beyond/labor-and-birth|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728021055/https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/childbirth-and-beyond/labor-and-birth|archive-date=28 July 2017|access-date=15 July 2017|publisher=Office on Women’s Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons for this include [[obstructed labor]], [[twin pregnancy]], [[pre-eclampsia|high blood pressure]] in the mother, [[breech birth]], and problems with the [[placenta]] or [[umbilical cord]].&lt;ref name=NIH2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=ACOG2014/&gt; A caesarean delivery may be performed based upon the shape of the mother's [[pelvis]] or history of a previous C-section.&lt;ref name=NIH2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=ACOG2014/&gt; A trial of [[Vaginal birth after previous C-section|vaginal birth after C-section]] may be possible.&lt;ref name=NIH2010/&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] recommends that caesarean section be performed only when medically necessary.&lt;ref name=ACOG2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Safe Prevention of the Primary Cesarean Delivery|url=http://www.acog.org/Resources_And_Publications/Obstetric_Care_Consensus_Series/Safe_Prevention_of_the_Primary_Cesarean_Delivery|work=American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine|access-date=20 February 2014|date=March 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302063757/http://www.acog.org/Resources_And_Publications/Obstetric_Care_Consensus_Series/Safe_Prevention_of_the_Primary_Cesarean_Delivery|archive-date=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; Some C-sections are performed [[Caesarean delivery on maternal request|without a medical reason, upon request]] by someone, usually the mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIH2010&quot; /&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Cesarean section scar and linea nigra.JPG|thumb|right|A 7-week old caesarean section [[scar]] and [[linea nigra]] visible on a 31-year-old mother: Longitudinal incisions are still sometimes used.]]
Caesarean section is recommended when [[vaginal delivery]] might pose a risk to the mother or baby. C-sections are also carried out for personal and social reasons on [[Caesarean delivery on maternal request|maternal request]] in some countries.

===Medical uses===
Complications of labor and factors increasing the risk associated with vaginal delivery include:
* abnormal presentation ([[Breech birth|breech]] or [[:wikt:transverse|transverse positions]]).
* prolonged [[Childbirth|labor]] or a failure to progress ([[obstructed labour]], also known as dystocia) 
* [[fetal distress]]
* [[cord prolapse]]
* [[uterine rupture]] or an elevated risk thereof
* [[hypertension]] in the mother or baby after [[amniotic fluid|amniotic rupture]] (the waters breaking)
* [[tachycardia]] in the mother or baby after amniotic rupture (the waters breaking)
* [[placenta]] problems ([[placenta praevia]], [[placental abruption]] or [[placenta accreta]])
* failed [[labor induction]]
* failed instrumental delivery (by [[Forceps in childbirth|forceps]] or [[ventouse]] (Sometimes, a trial of forceps/ventouse delivery is attempted, and if unsuccessful, the baby will need to be delivered by caesarean section.)
* large baby weighing &gt; 4,000 grams ([[macrosomia]])
* umbilical cord abnormalities ([[vasa previa]], multilobate including bilobate and succenturiate-lobed placentas, [[velamentous insertion]])

Other complications of pregnancy, pre-existing conditions, and concomitant disease, include:
* [[pre-eclampsia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Turner R |title=Caesarean Section Rates, Reasons for Operations Vary Between Countries |journal=Fam Plann Perspect |volume=22 |issue=6|pages=281–2 |year=1990 |doi=10.2307/2135690 |jstor=2135690 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* previous (high risk) fetus
* [[HIV]] infection of the mother with a high [[viral load]] (HIV with a low maternal viral load is not necessarily an indication for caesarean section)
* An outbreak of [[genital herpes]] in the third trimester&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Management of Genital Herpes in Pregnancy |url=https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-bulletin/articles/2020/05/management-of-genital-herpes-in-pregnancy |website=ACOG |access-date=3 May 2020 |date=May 2020 }}{{Dead link|date=May 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; (which can cause infection in the baby if born vaginally)
* previous classical (longitudinal) caesarean section
* previous uterine rupture
* prior problems with the healing of the [[perineum]] (from previous childbirth or [[Crohn's disease]])
* [[bicornuate uterus]]
* rare cases of [[posthumous birth]] after the death of the mother

Other
* Decreasing experience of accoucheurs with the management of breech presentation. Although obstetricians and midwives are extensively trained in proper procedures for breech presentation deliveries using simulation mannequins, there is decreasing experience with actual vaginal breech delivery, which may increase the risk.&lt;ref name=Savage07&gt;{{cite journal | author = Savage W | title = The rising Caesarean section rate: a loss of obstetric skill? | journal = J Obstet Gynaecol | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 339–46 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17654182 | doi = 10.1080/01443610701337916 | s2cid = 27545840 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prevention===
The prevalence of caesarean section is generally agreed to be higher than needed in many countries, and physicians are encouraged to actively lower the rate, as a caesarean rate higher than 10-15% is not associated with reductions in maternal or infant mortality rates,&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO2015&quot; /&gt; although some evidence support that a higher rate of 19% may result in better outcomes.&lt;ref name=Mol2015/&gt;

Some of these efforts are: emphasizing a long [[Childbirth#First stage: latent phase|latent phase]] of labor is not abnormal and not a justification for C-section; a new definition of the start of active labor from a cervical dilatation of 4&amp;nbsp;cm to a dilatation of 6&amp;nbsp;cm; and allowing women who have previously given birth to push for at least 2 hours, with 3 hours of pushing for women who have not previously given birth, before [[Tocolytic|labor arrest]] is considered.&lt;ref name=ACOG2014/&gt; [[Physical exercise]] during pregnancy decreases the risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Domenjoz|first1=I|last2=Kayser|first2=B|last3=Boulvain|first3=M|title=Effect of physical activity during pregnancy on mode of delivery |journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=October 2014|volume=211|issue=4|pages=401.e1–11|pmid=24631706|doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2014.03.030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks==
Adverse outcomes in low-risk pregnancies occur in 8.6% of vaginal deliveries and 9.2% of caesarean section deliveries.&lt;ref name=ACOG2014/&gt;

===Mother===
In those who are low risk, the [[mortality rate|risk of death]] for caesarean sections is 13 per 100,000 vs. for vaginal birth 3.5 per 100,000 in the developed world.&lt;ref name=ACOG2014/&gt; The United Kingdom [[National Health Service]] gives the risk of death for the mother as three times that of a vaginal birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=71&amp;sectionId=7681 |title=Caesarean Section |publisher=[[NHS Direct]] |access-date=26 July 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201155120/http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=71&amp;sectionId=7681 |archive-date=1 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the difference in serious morbidity or mortality for the mother (e.g. cardiac arrest, wound hematoma, or hysterectomy) was 1.8 additional cases per 100.&lt;ref name=Liu2007/&gt; The difference in in-hospital maternal death was not significant.&lt;ref name=Liu2007&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liu S, Liston RM, Joseph KS, Heaman M, Sauve R, Kramer MS | title = Maternal mortality and severe morbidity associated with low-risk planned cesarean delivery versus planned vaginal delivery at term | journal = CMAJ | volume = 176 | issue = 4 | pages = 455–60 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17296957 | pmc = 1800583 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.060870 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Normal post-Caesarean.jpg|thumb|[[Transvaginal ultrasonography]] of a uterus years after a caesarean section, showing the characteristic scar formation in its anterior part]]
A caesarean section is associated with risks of postoperative [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]], incisional hernias (which may require surgical correction), and wound infections.&lt;ref name=Pai00&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pai, Madhukar|title=Medical Interventions: Caesarean Sections as a Case Study |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=35 |issue=31 |pages=2755–61 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a caesarean is performed in an emergency, the risk of the surgery may be increased due to a number of factors. The patient's stomach may not be empty, increasing the risk of anaesthesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gynaecworld.com/Pregnancy/pg9.html#3 |title=Why are Caesareans Done? |publisher=Gynaecworld |access-date=26 July 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203134401/http://www.gynaecworld.com/Pregnancy/pg9.html#3 |archive-date=3 December 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other risks include severe blood loss (which may require a blood transfusion) and [[Post dural puncture headache|postdural-puncture spinal headaches]].&lt;ref name=Pai00/&gt;

Wound infections occur after caesarean sections at a rate of 3–15%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saee2017&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Saeed |first1=Khalid B M |last2=Greene |first2=Richard A |last3=Corcoran |first3=Paul |last4=O'Neill |first4=Sinéad M |title=Incidence of surgical site infection following caesarean section: a systematic review and meta-analysis protocol |journal=BMJ Open |date=11 January 2017 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=e013037 |doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2016-013037 |pmid=28077411 |pmc=5253548 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of chorioamnionitis and obesity predisposes the woman to develop a surgical site infection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saee2017&quot; /&gt;

Women who had caesarean sections are more likely to have problems with later pregnancies, and women who want larger families should not seek an elective caesarean unless medical indications to do so exist. The risk of [[placenta accreta]], a potentially life-threatening condition which is more likely to develop where a woman has had a previous caesarean section, is 0.13% after two caesarean sections, but increases to 2.13% after four and then to 6.74% after six or more.  Along with this is a similar rise in the risk of emergency hysterectomies at delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Silver |first1=Robert M. |last2=Landon |first2=Mark B. |last3=Rouse |first3=Dwight J. |last4=Leveno |first4=Kenneth J. |last5=Spong |first5=Catherine Y. |last6=Thom |first6=Elizabeth A. |last7=Moawad |first7=Atef H. |last8=Caritis |first8=Steve N. |last9=Harper |first9=Margaret |last10=Wapner |first10=Ronald J. |last11=Sorokin |first11=Yoram |last12=Miodovnik |first12=Menachem |last13=Carpenter |first13=Marshall |last14=Peaceman |first14=Alan M. |last15=O’Sullivan |first15=Mary J. |last16=Sibai |first16=Baha |last17=Langer |first17=Oded |last18=Thorp |first18=John M. |last19=Ramin |first19=Susan M. |last20=Mercer |first20=Brian M. |title=Maternal Morbidity Associated With Multiple Repeat Cesarean Deliveries |journal=Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology |date=June 2006 |volume=107 |issue=6 |pages=1226–1232 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000219750.79480.84 |pmid=16738145 |s2cid=257455 |lay-url=http://www.webmd.com/content/article/123/115093?action=related_link |lay-source=WebMD }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mothers can experience an increased incidence of [[postnatal depression]], and can experience significant psychological trauma and ongoing [[Childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder|birth-related post-traumatic stress disorder]] after obstetric intervention during the birthing process.&lt;ref name=Olde2006&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olde E, van der Hart O, Kleber R, van Son M | title = Post-traumatic stress following childbirth: a review | journal = Clin Psychol Rev | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–16 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16176853 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2005.07.002 | hdl = 1874/16760 | hdl-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors like pain in the first stage of labor, feelings of powerlessness, intrusive emergency obstetric intervention are important in the subsequent development of psychological issues related to labor and delivery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olde2006&quot;/&gt;

====Subsequent pregnancies====
{{Further|Delivery after previous caesarean section}}
Women who have had a caesarean for any reason are somewhat less likely to become pregnant again as compared to women who have previously delivered only vaginally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gurol-UrganciBou-Antoun2013&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gurol-Urganci |first1=I. |last2=Bou-Antoun |first2=S. |last3=Lim |first3=C.P. |last4=Cromwell |first4=D.A. |last5=Mahmood |first5=T.A. |last6=Templeton |first6=A. |last7=van der Meulen |first7=J.H. |title=Impact of Caesarean section on subsequent fertility: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Human Reproduction |date=July 2013 |volume=28 |issue=7 |pages=1943–1952 |doi=10.1093/humrep/det130 |pmid=23644593 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women who had just one previous caesarean section are more likely to have problems with their second birth.&lt;ref name=ACOG2014/&gt; [[Delivery after previous caesarean section]] is by either of two main options:
*Vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC)
*[[Elective surgery|Elective]] repeat caesarean section (ERCS)

Both have higher risks than a vaginal birth with no previous caesarean section. A vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC) confers a higher risk of [[uterine rupture]] (5 per 1,000), blood transfusion or [[endometritis]] (10 per 1,000), and [[perinatal death]] of the child (0.25 per 1,000).&lt;ref name=rcog2007&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/gtg4511022011.pdf |title=Birth After Previous Caesarean Birth, Green-top Guideline No. 45 |date=February 2007 |publisher=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207031819/https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/gtg4511022011.pdf |archive-date=7 December 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, 20% to 40% of planned VBAC attempts end in caesarean section being needed, with greater risks of complications in an emergency repeat caesarean section than in an elective repeat caesarean section.&lt;ref name=&quot;americanpregnancy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mayoclinic&quot;/&gt; On the other hand, VBAC confers less [[maternal morbidity]] and a decreased risk of complications in future pregnancies than elective repeat caesarean section.&lt;ref name=&quot;American Congress of Obstetricians and 450–63&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=American Congress of Obstetricians and|first=Gynecologists|title=ACOG Practice bulletin no. 115: Vaginal birth after previous cesarean delivery |journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=Aug 2010|volume=116|issue=2 Pt 1|pages=450–63|pmid=20664418|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181eeb251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Adhesions====
[[File:Suturing uterus.JPG|thumb|Suturing of the uterus after extraction]]
[[Image:C-sec suture.jpg|thumb|right|Closed incision for ''low transverse abdominal incision'' after stapling has been completed]]
There are several steps that can be taken during abdominal or pelvic surgery to minimize postoperative complications, such as the formation of [[adhesions]]. Such techniques and principles may include:

:• Handling all tissue with absolute care
:• Using powder-free surgical gloves
:• Controlling bleeding
:• Choosing sutures and implants carefully
:• Keeping tissue moist
:• Preventing infection with antibiotics given intravenously to the mother before skin incision

Despite these proactive measures, adhesion formation is a recognized complication of any abdominal or pelvic surgery. To prevent adhesions from forming after caesarean section, [[adhesion barrier]] can be placed during surgery to minimize the risk of adhesions between the uterus and ovaries, the small bowel, and almost any tissue in the abdomen or pelvis. This is not current UK practice, as there is no compelling evidence to support the benefit of this intervention.

Adhesions can cause long-term problems, such as:

:• [[Female Infertility|Infertility]], which may end when adhesions distort the tissues of the ovaries and tubes, impeding the normal passage of the egg (ovum) from the ovary to the uterus.  One in five infertility cases may be adhesion related (stoval)
:• Chronic pelvic pain, which may result when adhesions are present in the pelvis. Almost 50% of chronic pelvic pain cases are estimated to be adhesion related (stoval)
:• Small bowel obstruction: the disruption of normal bowel flow, which can result when adhesions twist or pull the small bowel.

The risk of adhesion formation is one reason why vaginal delivery is usually considered safer than elective caesarean section where there is no medical indication for section for either maternal or fetal reasons.

==Classification==
Caesarean sections have been classified in various ways by different perspectives.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlthabeTorloni2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Torloni |first1=Maria Regina |last2=Betran |first2=Ana Pilar |last3=Souza |first3=Joao Paulo |last4=Widmer |first4=Mariana |last5=Allen |first5=Tomas |last6=Gulmezoglu |first6=Metin |last7=Merialdi |first7=Mario |last8=Althabe |first8=Fernando |title=Classifications for Cesarean Section: A Systematic Review |journal=PLOS ONE |date=20 January 2011 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=e14566 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0014566 |pmid=21283801 |pmc=3024323 |bibcode=2011PLoSO...614566T }}&lt;/ref&gt; One way to discuss all classification systems is to group them by their focus either on the urgency of the procedure, characteristics of the mother, or as a group based on other, less commonly discussed factors.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlthabeTorloni2011&quot;/&gt;

It is most common to classify caesarean sections by the urgency of performing them.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlthabeTorloni2011&quot;/&gt;

===By urgency===
Conventionally, caesarean sections are classified as being either an [[elective surgery]] or an [[emergency]] operation.&lt;ref name=&quot;classification 2000&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lucas|first1=DN|last2=Yentis|first2=SM|last3=Kinsella|first3=SM|last4=Holdcroft|first4=A|last5=May|first5=AE|last6=Wee|first6=M|last7=Robinson|first7=PN|title=Urgency of caesarean section: a new classification |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|date=Jul 2000|volume=93|issue=7|pages=346–50|pmid=10928020|pmc=1298057|doi=10.1177/014107680009300703}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classification is used to help communication between the obstetric, midwifery and anaesthetic team for discussion of the most appropriate method of anaesthesia. The decision whether to perform [[general anesthesia]] or [[regional anesthesia]] (spinal or epidural anaesthetic) is important and is based on many indications, including how urgent the delivery needs to be as well as the medical and obstetric history of the woman.&lt;ref name=&quot;classification 2000&quot;/&gt; Regional anaesthetic is almost always safer for the woman and the baby but sometimes general anaesthetic is safer for one or both, and the classification of urgency of the delivery is an important issue affecting this decision.

A planned caesarean (or elective/scheduled caesarean), arranged ahead of time, is most commonly arranged for medical indications which have developed before or during the pregnancy, and ideally after 39 weeks of gestation. In the UK, this is classified as a 'grade 4' section (delivery timed to suit the mother or hospital staff) or as a 'grade 3' section (no maternal or fetal compromise but early delivery needed).
Emergency caesarean sections are performed in pregnancies in which a vaginal delivery was planned initially, but an indication for caesarean delivery has since developed. In the UK they are further classified as grade 2 (delivery required within 90 minutes of the decision but no immediate threat to the life of the woman or the fetus) or grade 1 (delivery required within 30 minutes of the decision: immediate threat to the life of the mother or the baby or both.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miheso|first1=Johnstone|last2=Burns|first2=Sean|title=Care of women undergoing emergency caesarean section|url=https://www.wwl.nhs.uk/Library/FOI/Requests/2013-2014/July_2013/1678_Emergency_Caesarean_Section_Jul12.pdf|website=NHS Choices|access-date=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elective caesarean sections may be performed on the basis of an obstetrical or medical indication, or because of a medically non-indicated [[Caesarean delivery on maternal request|maternal request]].&lt;ref name=NICE2011 /&gt; Among women in the United Kingdom, Sweden and Australia, about 7% preferred caesarean section as a method of delivery.&lt;ref name=NICE2011 /&gt; In cases without medical indications the [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] and the UK Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommend a planned vaginal delivery.&lt;ref name=ACOG559&gt;{{cite journal|last1=American College of Obstetricians and|first1=Gynecologists|title=ACOG committee opinion no. 559: Cesarean delivery on maternal request |journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=Apr 2013|volume=121|issue=4|pages=904–7|pmid=23635708|doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000428647.67925.d3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] recommends that if after a woman has been provided information on the risk of a planned caesarean section and she still insists on the procedure it should be provided.&lt;ref name=NICE2011 /&gt; If provided this should be done at 39 weeks of gestation or later.&lt;ref name=ACOG559/&gt; There is no evidence that ECS can reduce mother-to-child [[Hepatitis B virus|hepatitis B]] and [[Hepatitis C virus|hepatitis C]] virus transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yang |first1=Jin |last2=Zeng |first2=Xue-mei |last3=Men |first3=Ya-lin |last4=Zhao |first4=Lian-san |title=Elective caesarean section versus vaginal delivery for preventing mother to child transmission of hepatitis B virus – a systematic review |journal=Virology Journal |date=2008 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=100 |doi=10.1186/1743-422X-5-100 |pmc=2535601 |pmid=18755018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Borgia |first1=Guglielmo |title=Hepatitis B in pregnancy |journal=World Journal of Gastroenterology |date=2012 |volume=18 |issue=34 |pages=4677–83 |doi=10.3748/wjg.v18.i34.4677 |pmc=3442205 |pmid=23002336 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hu |first1=Yali |last2=Chen |first2=Jie |last3=Wen |first3=Jian |last4=Xu |first4=Chenyu |last5=Zhang |first5=Shu |last6=Xu |first6=Biyun |last7=Zhou |first7=Yi-Hua |title=Effect of elective cesarean section on the risk of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus |journal=BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth |date=24 May 2013 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=119 |doi=10.1186/1471-2393-13-119 |pmc=3664615 |pmid=23706093 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McIntyre |first1=Paul G |last2=Tosh |first2=Karen |last3=McGuire |first3=William |title=Caesarean section versus vaginal delivery for preventing mother to infant hepatitis C virus transmission |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=4 |pages=CD005546 |date=18 October 2006 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005546.pub2 |pmid=17054264 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Significant Sex—but Not Elective Cesarean Section—Effect on Mother‐to‐Child Transmission of Hepatitis C Virus Infection |journal=The Journal of Infectious Diseases |date=December 2005 |volume=192 |issue=11 |pages=1872–1879 |doi=10.1086/497695 |pmid=16267757 |author1=European Paediatric Hepatitis C Virus Network |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mothers who have previously had a caesarean section are more likely to have a caesarean section for future pregnancies than mothers who have never had a caesarean section. There is discussion about the circumstances under which women should have a vaginal birth after a previous caesarean.

Vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC) is the practice of [[Childbirth|birthing a baby]] vaginally after a previous baby has been delivered by caesarean section (surgically).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webmd.com/baby/tc/vaginal-birth-after-cesarean-vbac-overview Vaginal Birth After Cesarean (VBAC) – Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230133854/http://www.webmd.com/baby/tc/vaginal-birth-after-cesarean-vbac-overview |date=30 December 2009 }}, [[WebMD]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG), successful VBAC is associated with decreased maternal morbidity and a decreased risk of complications in future pregnancies.&lt;ref name=&quot;American College of Obstetricians and 450–63&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=American College of Obstetricians and|first=Gynecologists|title=ACOG Practice bulletin no. 115: Vaginal birth after previous cesarean delivery |journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=Aug 2010|volume=116|issue=2 Pt 1|pages=450–63|pmid=20664418|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181eeb251}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the American Pregnancy Association, 90% of women who have undergone caesarean deliveries are candidates for VBAC.&lt;ref name=&quot;americanpregnancy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanpregnancy.org/labornbirth/vbac.html |title=Vaginal Birth after Cesarean (VBAC) |publisher=American Pregnancy Association |access-date=16 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621050450/http://www.americanpregnancy.org/labornbirth/vbac.html |archive-date=21 June 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 60–80% of women opting for VBAC will successfully give birth vaginally, which is comparable to the overall vaginal delivery rate in the United States in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;americanpregnancy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mayoclinic&quot;&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vbac/VB99999 Vaginal birth after C-section (VBAC) guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312103525/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vbac/vb99999 |date=12 March 2010 }}, [[Mayo Clinic]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db35.htm#ref1 |title=NCHS Data Brief: Recent Trends in Cesarean Delivery in the United States Products |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=March 2010 |access-date=16 June 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517145002/http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db35.htm#ref1 |archive-date=17 May 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For otherwise healthy twin pregnancies where both twins are head down a trial of vaginal delivery is recommended at between 37 and 38 weeks.&lt;ref name=NICE2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bis2013/&gt; Vaginal delivery in this case does not worsen the outcome for either infant as compared with caesarean section.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bis2013&quot;/&gt; There is controversy on the best method of delivery where the first twin is head first and the second is not.&lt;ref name=Bis2013/&gt; When the first twin is not head down at the point of labor starting, a caesarean section should be recommended.&lt;ref name=Bis2013/&gt; Although the second twin typically has a higher frequency of problems, it is not known if a planned caesarean section affects this.&lt;ref name=NICE2011 /&gt; It is estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by caesarean section in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid22015878&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee HC, Gould JB, Boscardin WJ, El-Sayed YY, Blumenfeld YJ | title = Trends in cesarean delivery for twin births in the United States: 1995–2008 | journal = Obstet Gynecol | volume = 118 | issue = 5 | pages = 1095–101 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22015878 | pmc = 3202294 | doi = 10.1097/AOG.0b013e3182318651 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Breech birth====
{{main|Breech birth}}
A breech birth is the birth of a baby from a breech [[presentation (obstetrics)|presentation]], in which the baby exits the pelvis with the [[buttocks]] or [[foot|feet]] first as opposed to the normal [[cephalic presentation|head-first presentation]]. In breech presentation, fetal heart sounds are heard just above the umbilicus.

Babies are usually born head first. If the baby is in another position the birth may be complicated. In a 'breech presentation', the unborn baby is bottom-down instead of head-down. Babies born bottom-first are more likely to be harmed during a normal (vaginal) birth than those born head-first. For instance, the baby might not get enough oxygen during the birth. Having a planned caesarean may reduce these problems. A review looking at planned caesarean section for singleton breech presentation with planned vaginal birth, concludes that in the short term, births with a planned caesarean were safer for babies than vaginal births. Fewer babies died or were seriously hurt when they were born by caesarean. There was tentative evidence that children who were born by caesarean had more health problems at age two. Caesareans caused some short-term problems for mothers such as more abdominal pain. They also had some benefits, such as less urinary incontinence and less perineal pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hofmeyr |first1=G Justus |last2=Hannah |first2=Mary |last3=Lawrie |first3=Theresa A |title=Planned caesarean section for term breech delivery |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=7 |pages=CD000166 |date=21 July 2015 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000166.pub2 |pmid=26196961 |pmc=6505736 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bottom-down position presents some hazards to the baby during the process of birth, and the mode of delivery (vaginal versus caesarean) is controversial in the fields of [[obstetrics]] and [[midwifery]].

Though vaginal [[childbirth|birth]] is possible for the breech baby, certain fetal and maternal factors influence the safety of vaginal breech birth. The majority of breech babies born in the United States and the UK are delivered by caesarean section as studies have shown increased risks of morbidity and mortality for vaginal breech delivery, and most obstetricians counsel against planned vaginal breech birth for this reason.  As a result of reduced numbers of actual vaginal breech deliveries, obstetricians and midwives are at risk of de-skilling in this important skill. All those involved in delivery of obstetric and midwifery care in the UK undergo mandatory training in conducting breech deliveries in the simulation environment (using dummy pelvises and mannequins to allow practice of this important skill) and this training is carried out regularly to keep skills up to date.

====Resuscitative hysterotomy====
{{main|Resuscitative hysterotomy}}
A resuscitative [[hysterotomy]], also known as a peri-mortem caesarean delivery, is an emergency caesarean delivery carried out where maternal [[cardiac arrest]] has occurred, to assist in [[resuscitation]] of the mother by removing the [[aortocaval compression syndrome|aortocaval compression]] generated by the gravid uterus. Unlike other forms of caesarean section, the welfare of the fetus is a secondary priority only, and the procedure may be performed even prior to the limit of [[fetal viability]] if it is judged to be of benefit to the mother.

===Other ways, including the surgery technique===
There are several types of caesarean section (CS). An important distinction lies in the type of incision (longitudinal or transverse) made on the [[uterus]], apart from the incision on the skin: the vast majority of skin incisions are a transverse suprapubic approach known as a [[Pfannenstiel incision]] but there is no way of knowing from the skin scar which way the uterine incision was conducted.
* The classical caesarean section involves a [[sagittal plane|longitudinal]] midline incision on the uterus which allows a larger space to deliver the baby. It is performed at very early gestations where the lower segment of the uterus is unformed as it is safer in this situation for the baby: but it is rarely performed other than at these early gestations, as the operation is more prone to complications than a low transverse uterine incision. Any woman who has had a classical section will be recommended to have an elective repeat section in subsequent pregnancies as the vertical incision is much more likely to rupture in labor than the transverse incision.
* The [[lower uterine segment section]] is the procedure most commonly used today; it involves a [[transverse cut]] just above the edge of the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]]. It results in less [[Bleeding|blood loss]] and has fewer early and late complications for the mother, as well as allowing her to consider a vaginal birth in the next pregnancy.
* A caesarean [[hysterectomy]] consists of a caesarean section followed by the removal of the [[uterus]]. This may be done in cases of intractable bleeding or when the [[placenta]] cannot be separated from the uterus.

The [[EXIT procedure]] is a specialized surgical delivery procedure used to deliver babies who have airway compression.

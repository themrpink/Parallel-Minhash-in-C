'''Transister''' was an [[alternative rock]] band, formed in late 1995 in Los Angeles, by music industry veterans from both the United States and the United Kingdom.  Despite only having released one album to moderate sales, their work has been featured on a number of film soundtracks.  The band was fronted by [[Keely Hawkes]], the sister of [[Chesney Hawkes]] (daughter of [[The Tremeloes|Len 'Chip' Hawkes]]).

==History==
Transister's formation was the culmination of various collaborations between songwriter Eric Pressly, former [[Danny Wilson (band)|Danny Wilson]] frontman [[Gary Clark (musician)|Gary Clark]], and vocalist Keely Hawkes.  Hawkes first made use of Pressly's songwriting on her 1993 solo debut for [[EMI]], while Pressly and Clark first worked together in the band King L in 1995.  The three were encouraged by the results of their early songwriting attempts, and decided to release a six-song [[Extended play|EP]] on their own record label.

Transister began to attract major label attention after [[KCRW]] DJ [[Christopher Douridas]] played a few of the self-recorded tracks on ''[[Morning Becomes Eclectic]]'' in early 1996.  [[Interscope Records]] released Transister's self-titled debut in the US in 1997; UK and international distribution was handled by [[Virgin Records]].  Tracks from the album were featured on a number of film soundtracks, including ''[[Nightwatch (1997 film)|Nightwatch]]'' (1997), ''[[Wild Things (film)|Wild Things]]'' (1998), ''[[Jawbreaker (film)|Jawbreaker]]'' (1999), ''[[Never Been Kissed]]'' (1999), ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]'' (2000) and ''[[Cheaters (2000 film)|Cheaters]]'' (2000).  Although members of the band have since gone on to other projects, Hawkes and Pressly maintained a relationship and were married on January 8, 2005.

Their song &quot;Look Who's Perfect Now&quot; was their only foray into the [[UK Singles Chart]], where it peaked at No.&amp;nbsp;56 in March 1998.&lt;ref name=occ&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/4338/transister/|title=Official Charts &gt; Transister|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=23 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;&gt;{{cite book

They are probably best known for their invasions and destruction in the [[Avar–Byzantine wars]] from 568 to 626.

The name Pannonian Avars (after [[Pannonian Basin|the area]] in which they eventually settled) is used to distinguish them from the [[Avars (Caucasus)|Avars of the Caucasus]], a separate people with whom the Pannonian Avars might or might not have had links.

They established the Avar Khaganate, which spanned the [[Pannonian Basin]] and considerable areas of [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] from the late 6th to the early 9th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pohl26&quot;&gt;Walter Pohl, ''Die Awaren: ein Steppenvolk im Mitteleuropa, 567–822 n.

Although the name ''Avar'' first appeared in the mid-5th century, the Pannonian Avars entered the historical scene in the mid-6th century,&lt;ref name=Curta2006&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YIAYMNOOe0YC&amp;pg=RA2-PA100|title=Southeastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 500–1250 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |series=Cambridge medieval textbooks |year=2006 |access-date=2009-11-20 |last=Curta |first=Florin |isbn=978-0-521-81539-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe|Pontic–Caspian steppe]] as a people who wished to escape the rule of the [[Göktürks]].

==Origins==
===Avars and pseudo-Avars===
The earliest clear reference to the Avar ethnonym comes from [[Priscus|Priscus the Rhetor]] (died after 472 AD). Priscus recounts that, c. 463, the [[Saragurs|Šaragurs]], [[Onogurs]] and [[Ogurs]] were attacked by the [[Sabir people|Sabirs]], who had been attacked by the Avars. In turn, the Avars had been driven off by people fleeing &quot;man-eating [[griffin]]s&quot; coming from &quot;the ocean&quot; (''Priscus Fr 40'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=436}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst Priscus' accounts provide some information about the ethno-political situation in the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]]-[[Kuban]]-[[Volga Delta|Volga]] region after the demise of the [[Huns]], no unequivocal conclusions can be reached. Denis Sinor has argued that whoever the &quot;Avars&quot; referred to by Priscus were, they differed from the Avars who appear a century later, during the time of [[Justinian]] (who reigned from 527 to 565).&lt;ref name=&quot;Dobrovits 2003&quot;&gt;{{harvtxt|Dobrovits|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next author to discuss the Avars, [[Menander Protector]], appeared during the 6th century, and wrote of [[Göktürks|Göktürk]] embassies to [[Constantinople]] in 565 and 568 AD. The Turks appeared angry at the Byzantines for having made an alliance with the Avars, whom the Turks saw as their subjects and slaves. [[Turxanthos]], a Turk prince, calls the Avars &quot;Varchonites&quot; and &quot;escaped slaves of the Turks&quot;, who numbered &quot;about 20 thousand&quot; (''Menander Fr 43'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Whitby| 1986|p= 226, footnote 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many more, but somewhat confusing, details come from [[Theophylact Simocatta]], who wrote c. 629, describing the final two decades of the 6th century. In particular, he claims to quote a triumph letter from the Turk lord [[Tamgan]]:

{{quote|text=For this very [[Khagan|Chagan]] had in fact outfought the leader of the nation of the [[Durrani|Abdali]] (I mean indeed, of the [[Hephthalites]], as they are called), conquered him, and assumed the rule of the nation.
Then he ... enslaved the Avar nation.

But let no one think that we are distorting the history of these times because he supposes that the Avars are those barbarians neighbouring on Europe and [[Pannonian Basin|Pannonia]], and that their arrival was prior to the times of the [[emperor Maurice]]. For it is by a misnomer that the barbarians on the Ister have assumed the appellation of Avars; the origin of their race will shortly be revealed.

So, when the Avars had been defeated (for we are returning to the account) some of them made their escape to those who inhabit [[Tuoba|Taugast]]. Taugast is a famous city, which is a total of one thousand five hundred miles distant from those who are called Turks, ... Others of the Avars, who declined to humbler fortune because of their defeat, came to those who are called Moukri; this nation is the closest neighbour to the men of Taugast;

Then the Chagan embarked on yet another enterprise, and subdued all the Ogur, which is one of the strongest tribes on account of its large population and its armed training for war. These make their habitations in the east, by the course of the Til, which Turks are accustomed to call Melas. The earliest leaders of this nation were named [[Uar|Var]] and [[Huns|Chunni]]; from them some parts of those nations were also accorded their nomenclature, being called Var and Chunni.

Then, while the emperor Justinian was in possession of the royal power, a small section of these Var and Chunni fled from that ancestral tribe and settled in Europe. These named themselves Avars and glorified their leader with the appellation of Chagan. Let us declare, without departing in the least from the truth, how the means of changing their name came to them.&amp;nbsp;...

When the [[Barsils]], [[Onogurs]], [[Sabir people|Sabirs]], and other Hun nations in addition to these, saw that a section of those who were still Var and Chunni had fled to their regions, they plunged into extreme panic, since they suspected that the settlers were Avars. For this reason they honoured the fugitives with splendid gifts and supposed that they received from them security in exchange.

Then, after the Var and Chunni saw the well-omened beginning to their flight, they appropriated the ambassadors' error and named themselves Avars: for among the Scythian nations that of the Avars is said to be the most adept tribe. In point of fact even up to our present times the Pseudo-Avars (for it is more correct to refer to them thus) are divided in their ancestry, some bearing the time-honoured name of Var while others are called Chunni.}}

[[File:Avaric - Drinking Bowl - Walters 57565 - Profile.jpg|thumb|Gold Avar bowl, found in modern [[Albania]].]]
According to the interpretation of Dobrovits and Nechaeva, the Turks insisted that the Avars were only &quot;pseudo-Avars&quot;, so as to boast that they were the only formidable power in the Eurasian steppe. The [[Göktürks]] claimed that the &quot;real Avars&quot; remained loyal subjects of the Turks, farther east.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dobrovits 2003&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nechaeva|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Dobrovits has questioned the authenticity of Theophylact's account. As such, he has argued that Theophylact borrowed information from Menander's accounts of Byzantine–Turk negotiations to meet political needs of his time – i.e. to castigate and deride the Avars during a time of strained political relations between the Byzantines and Avars (coinciding with Emperor Maurice's northern Balkan campaigns).&lt;ref name=&quot;Dobrovits 2003&quot;/&gt;

According to some scholars the Pannonian Avars originated from a confederation formed in the [[Aral Sea]] region, by the [[Uar]], also known as the ''Var'' or ''Warr'' (who were probably a [[Uralic people]]) and the [[Xionites|Xūn]] or Xionites (also known as the ''Chionitae'', ''Chunni'', ''Hunni'', ''Yun'' and similar names);&lt;ref&gt;Гулямов Я. Г., История орошения Хорезма с древнейших времен до наших дней, Ташкент, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Муратов Б.А. Аланы, кавары и хиониты в этногенезе башкир//Урал-Алтай: через века в будущее: Материалы Всероссийской научной конференции. Уфа, 27 июня 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; the Xionites were maybe [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] or [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking or both.&lt;ref&gt;Peter B. Golden, 2005 &quot;Turks and Iranians: a cultural sketch&quot;, in: Lars Johanson and Christiane Bulut (ed.), ''Turkic-Iranian Contact Areas: Historical and Linguistic Aspects'', Turcologica 62, Wiesbaden, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; A third tribe affiliated previously to the Uar and Xionites, the [[Hephthalites]], had remained in [[Central Asia|Central]] and northern [[South Asia]]. In some transliterations, the term ''Var'' is rendered ''Hua'', which is an alternate Chinese term for the Hephthalites. (While one of the cities most significant to the Hephthalites was [[Walwalij]] or ''Varvaliz'', this may also be an [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] term for &quot;upper fortress&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harmatta 2001&quot; /&gt;) The Pannonian Avars were also known by names including ''Uarkhon'' or ''Varchonites'' – which may have been [[portmanteau word]]s combining ''Var'' and ''Chunni''.

The 18th-century historian [[Joseph de Guignes]] postulated a link between the Avars of European history with the [[Rouran Khaganate]] of [[Inner Asia]] based on a coincidence between Tardan Khan's letter to Constantinople and events recorded in [[Chinese people|Chinese]] sources, notably the ''[[Wei Shu]]'' and ''[[Bei Shi]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harmatta 2001&quot;&gt;{{harvtxt|Harmatta|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese sources state that [[Bumin Qaghan]], founder of the [[First Turkic Khaganate]], defeated the Rouran, some of whom fled and joined the [[Western Wei]]. Later, Bumin's successor [[Muqan Qaghan]] defeated the [[Hephthalites]] as well as the Turkic [[Tiele people|Tiele]]. Superficially these victories over the Tiele, Rouran and Hephthalites echo a narrative in the ''Theophylact'', boasting of Tardan's victories over the Hephthalites, Avars and Oghurs. However, the two series of events are not synonymous: the events of the latter took place during Tardan's rule, c. 580–599, whilst Chinese sources referring to the Turk defeat of the Rouran and other Central Asian peoples occurred 50 years earlier, at the founding of the First Turkic Khaganate. It is for this reason that the linguist [[János Harmatta]] rejects the identification of the Avars with the Rouran.

According to [[Edwin G. Pulleyblank]], the name Avar is the same as the prestigious name [[Wuhuan]] in the Chinese sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/161177 ''The Peoples of the Steppe Frontier in Early Chinese Sources''], Edwin G. Pulleyblank, pages 35, 44&lt;/ref&gt; Several historians, including Peter Benjamin Golden, suggest that the Avars are of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic origin]], likely from the [[Oghur languages|Oghur branch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/12545004|title=An Introduction to the History of the Turkic Peoples|last=Golden|first=Peter B.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory suggests that some of the Avars were of [[Tungusic people|Tungusic]] origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2004&quot;&gt;Helimski, E (2004). &quot;Die Sprache(n) der Awaren: Die mandschu-tungusische Alternative&quot;. Proceedings of the First International Conference on Manchu-Tungus Studies, Vol. II: 59–72.&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Emil Heršak and Ana Silić suggests that the Avars were of heterogeneous origin, including mostly Turkic (Oghuric) and Mongolic groups. Later in Europe some Germanic and Slavic groups were assimilated into the Avars. They concluded that their exact origin is unknown but state that it is likely that the Avars were originally mainly composed of Turkic (Oghuric) tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Silić|first1=Ana|last2=Heršak|first2=Emil|date=2002-09-30|title=The Avars: A Review of Their Ethnogenesis and History|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=158267|journal=Migracijske I Etničke Teme|language=hr|volume=18|issue=2–3|pages=197–224|issn=1333-2546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steppe empire dynamics and ethnogenesis===
[[File:Pontic steppe region around 650 AD.png|thumb|The [[Pontic steppe]], c. 650, showing the early territories of the [[Khazars]], [[Bulgars]], and Avars]]

In 2003, [[Walter Pohl]] summarized the formation of [[nomadic empire]]s:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pohl| 2003| pp=477–478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=
1. Many steppe empires were founded by groups who had been defeated in previous power struggles but had fled from the dominion of the stronger group. The Avars were likely a losing faction previously subordinate to the (legitimate) [[Ashina tribe|Ashina clan]] in the [[Western Turkic Khaganate]], and they fled west of the [[Dnieper]].

2. These groups usually were of mixed origin, and each of its components was part of a previous group.

3. Crucial in the process was the elevation of a khagan, which signified a claim to independent power and an [[expansionist]] strategy. This group also needed a new name that would give all of its initial followers a sense of identity.

4. The name for a new group of steppe riders was often taken from a repertoire of prestigious names which did not necessarily denote any direct affiliation to or descent from groups of the same name; in the [[Early Middle Ages]], [[Huns]], Avars, [[Bulgars]], and Ogurs, or names connected with -(o)gur ([[Kutrigur]]s, [[Utigurs]], [[Onogurs]], etc.), were most important. In the process of name-giving, both perceptions by outsiders and self-designation played a role. These names were also connected with prestigious traditions that directly expressed political pretensions and programmes, and had to be endorsed by success. In the world of the steppe, where agglomerations of groups were rather fluid, it was vital to know how to deal with a newly-emergent power. The symbolical hierarchy of prestige expressed through names provided some orientation for friend and foe alike.}}

Such views are mirrored by {{ill|Bálint Csanád|hu|Bálint Csanád|lt=Csanád Bálint}}. &quot;The [[ethnogenesis]] of early medieval peoples of steppe origin cannot be conceived in a ''single linear'' fashion due to their great and constant mobility&quot;, with no ethnogenetic &quot;point zero&quot;, theoretical &quot;proto-people&quot; or proto-language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Balint|2010|p=150}}{{full citation needed|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Avar identity was strongly linked to Avar political institutions. Groups who rebelled or fled from the Avar realm could never be called &quot;Avars&quot;, but were rather termed &quot;[[Bulgars]]&quot;. Similarly, with the final demise of Avar power in the early 9th century, Avar identity disappeared almost instantaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pohl|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anthropology===
In contemporary art, Avars were sometimes depicted as mounted archers, riding backwards on their horses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.bg/books?id=iQUUAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=archers+riding++reverse&amp;dq=archers+riding++reverse&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwie7O7G0L_OAhUK1xQKHf5PDpE4ChDoAQg5MAY ''Archivum Eurasiae Medii Aevi'', Vol. 4]. Otto Harrassowitz, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; According to mid-20th Century [[Biological anthropology|physical anthropologists]] such as [[Pál Lipták]], human remains from the early Avar (7th century) period had mostly &quot;[[Europoid]]&quot; features, while [[grave goods]] indicated cultural links to the [[Eurasian steppe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fóthi&quot;/&gt; Cemeteries dated to the late Avar period (8th century) included many human remains with physical features typical of [[East Asian people]] or [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasians]] (i.e., people with both East Asian and European ancestry).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Acta archaeologica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae&quot;, Magyar Tudományos Akadémia, 1 Jan 1967, Page 86 [https://books.google.com/books?id=HCIrAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Avars++mongoloids&amp;dq=Avars++mongoloids&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=s6_OTrv0CMTc8AOUwpT0Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y]

''[http://opac.regesta-imperii.de/lang_en/anzeige.php?aufsatz=Recherches+anthropologiques+sur+les+ossements+avares+des+environs+d%27%C3%9Cll%C3%B6&amp;pk=772686 Recherches anthropologiques sur les ossements avares des environs d'Üllö]'' (1955) – In: Acta archaeologica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae, vol. 6 (1955), pp. 231–314&lt;/ref&gt;) Several theories suggest that the ruling class of the Avars were of [[Tungusic people|Tungusic]] East Asian origin or of partially Tungusic origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2004&quot;/&gt;

===Genetics===
{{See also|Donghu people#Genetics|Rouran Khaganate#Genetics|Xianbei#Genetics|Xiongnu#Genetics|Huns#Genetics}}
A genetic study published in ''[[Scientific Reports]]'' in September 2016 examined the [[mtDNA]] of 31 people buried in the Carpathian Basin during the Avar period between the 7th and 9th centuries AD.{{sfn|Csősz et al.|2016|p=1}} They were found to be mostly carrying European haplogroups such as [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)|H]], [[Haplogroup K (mtDNA)|K]], [[Haplogroup T (mtDNA)|T]] and [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|U]], while ca. 15% carried Asian haplogroups such as [[Haplogroup C (mtDNA)|C]], [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|M6]], [[Haplogroup D (mtDNA)|D41c]] and [[Haplogroup F (mtDNA)|F1a]].{{sfn|Csősz et al.|2016|pp=2-4}} Their mtDNA were found to be primarily characteristic of Eastern and Southern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Csősz et al.|2016|p=1}}. &quot;[T]he analyzed Avars represents a certain group of the Avar society that shows East and South European genetic characteristics...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

A genetic study published in the ''[[American Journal of Physical Anthropology]]'' in 2018 examined 62 individuals buried in the 8th and 9th centuries AD at an Avar-Slavic burial in Cífer‐Pác, [[Slovakia]].{{sfn|Šebest et al.|2018|p=1}} Of the 46 samples of mtDNA extracted, 93,48% belonged to west Eurasian lineages, while 6,52% belonged to east Eurasian lineages.{{sfn|Šebest et al.|2018|pp=1, 6}} The amount of east Eurasian lineages was higher than among modern European populations, but lower than what has been found in other genetic studies on the Avars.{{sfn|Šebest et al.|2018|p=14}} The mtDNA of the examined individuals was found to be quite similar to medieval and modern [[Slavs]], and it was suggested that the mixed population examined had emerged through intermarriage between Avar males and Slavic females.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Šebest et al.|2018|p=14}}. &quot;The most probable explanation of our findings could be that the assimilation rate of Avars and Slavs was already relatively high in theanalyzed mixed ancient population, where a majority of the inter-ethnic marriages involved Avar men and Slavic women.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

A genetic study published in ''Scientific Reports'' in November 2019 examined the remains of fourteen Avar males. Eleven of them were dated to the early Avar period, and three were dated to the middle and late Avar period.{{sfn|Neparáczki et al.|2019|p=3|loc=Figure 1}} The eleven early Avar males were found to be carrying the paternal haplogroups [[Haplogroup N-M231#N1a1a (M178)|N1a1a1a1a3]] (four samples), [[Haplogroup N-M231#N1a1a (M178)|N1a1a]] (two samples),  [[Haplogroup R1a#R1a1a1b2 (R-Z93) (Asia)|R1a1a1b2a]] (two samples), [[Haplogroup C-M217|C2]] [[Haplogroup G-M201|G2a]], and [[Haplogroup I-M253|I1]].{{sfn|Neparáczki et al.|2019|p=3|loc=Figure 1}} The three males dated to the middle and late Avar period carried the paternal haplogroups C2, N1a1a1a1a3 and [[Haplogroup E-V68|E1b1b1a1b1a]].{{sfn|Neparáczki et al.|2019|p=3|loc=Figure 1}} The Avars studied were all determined to have had [[Eye color|dark eye]]s and [[black hair|dark hair]], and the majority of them were found to be primarily of [[East Asian people|East Asian]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Neparáczki et al.|2019|pp=5–7}}. &quot;All Hun and Avar age samples had inherently dark eye/hair colors... 8/15 Avar age individuals showed predominantly East Asian origin with both methods, 4 individuals were definitely European, while two showed evidence of admixture.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

A genetic study published in ''Scientific Reports'' in January 2020 examined the remains of twenty-six individuals buried at various elite Avar cemeteries in the Pannonian Basin dated to the 7th century AD.{{sfn|Csáky et al.|2020|p=1}} The [[mtDNA]] of these Avars belonged mostly to [[East Asia]]n haplogroups, while the [[Y-DNA]] was exclusively of East Asian origin and &quot;strikingly homogenous&quot;, belonging to haplogroups [[Haplogroup N-M231|N-M231]] and [[Haplogroup Q-M242|Q-M242]].{{sfn|Csáky et al.|2020|pp=1, 4}} The evidence suggested that the Avars were a [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] and [[endogamous]] people who entered the Pannonian Basin through migrations from East Asia involving both men and women.{{sfn|Csáky et al.|2020|pp=1, 9-10}}

=== Arrival in Europe ===
In 557 the Avars sent an embassy to [[Constantinople]] {{mdash}} presumably from the northern [[Caucasus]]. This marked their first contact with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In exchange for gold, they agreed to subjugate the &quot;unruly ''gentes''&quot; on behalf of the Byzantines: subsequently they conquered and incorporated various nomadic tribes{{mdash}}[[Kutrigurs]] and [[Sabir people|Sabirs]]{{mdash}}and defeated the [[Antes people|Antes]].&lt;ref&gt;

| quote = [...] the first thing the Avars did when they came near the Caucasus on their flight from Central Asia was to send an embassy to the aging emperor Justinian. That took place sometime in winter 558/59, and they struck the usual deal: the Avars were to fight for the Empire against unruly ''gentes'' and in turn would receive annual payments and other benefits. Indeed, for 20 years to come the Avars, under their Khagan Baian, fought Utigurs and Antes, Gepids and Slavs, whereas their policy towards the Empire relied more on negotiation than on war.

By 562 the Avars controlled the lower Danube basin and the steppes north of the Black Sea.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Pohl]], &quot;Conceptions of Ethnicity in Early Medieval Studies&quot;, ''Debating the Middle Ages: Issues and Readings'', ed.

However, [[Franks|Frankish]] opposition halted the Avars' expansion in that direction.

Seeking rich pastoral lands, the Avars initially demanded land south of the [[Danube River]] in present-day [[Bulgaria]], but the Byzantines refused, using their contacts with the [[Göktürks]] as a threat against Avar aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

However, the Carpathian basin was then occupied by the [[Gepids]]. In 567 the Avars formed an alliance with the [[Lombards]]{{mdash}}enemies of the Gepids{{mdash}}and together they destroyed much of the Gepid Kingdom. The Avars then persuaded the Lombards to move into [[Kingdom of the Lombards|northern Italy]], an invasion that marked the last Germanic mass-movement in the [[Migration Period]].{{citation needed|date= May 2014}}

Continuing their successful policy of turning the various barbarians against each other, the Byzantines persuaded the Avars to attack the [[Sclaveni|Sclavenes]] in [[Scythia Minor]] (modern [[Dobruja]]), a land rich with goods.{{sfn|Curta|2001}}{{page needed|date= December 2015}} After devastating much of the Sclavenes' land, the Avars returned to Pannonia after many of the Khagan's subjects deserted to the Byzantine Emperor.

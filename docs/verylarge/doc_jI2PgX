Pillars and columns, such as [[Washington Column (Yosemite)|Washington Column]] and [[Lost Arrow Spire|Lost Arrow]], are created by cross joints. Erosion acting on master joints is responsible for creating valleys and later canyons.&lt;ref name=&quot;GeologyUSP220&quot;/&gt; The single most erosive force over the last few million years has been large alpine glaciers, which have turned the previously V-shaped river-cut valleys into U-shaped glacial-cut canyons (such as Yosemite Valley and Hetch Hetchy Valley). [[Exfoliation (geology)|Exfoliation]] (caused by the tendency of [[crystal]]s in [[pluton]]ic rocks to expand at the surface) acting on granitic rock with widely spaced joints is responsible for creating domes such as [[Half Dome]] and [[North Dome]] and inset arches like Royal Arches.&lt;ref name=&quot;GeologyNP332&quot;/&gt;

===Popular features===
[[File:The spiny crown of Cathedral Peak, Yosemite National Park, California.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cathedral Peak (California)|Cathedral Peak]]]]
Yosemite Valley represents only one percent of the park area, but this is where most visitors arrive and stay. The [[Tunnel View]] is the first view of the Valley for many visitors and is extensively photographed. [[El Capitan]], a prominent granite cliff that looms over Yosemite Valley, is one of the most popular rock climbing destinations in the world because of its diverse range of climbing routes in addition to its year-round accessibility. [[Granite dome]]s such as [[Sentinel Dome]] and [[Half Dome]] rise {{convert|3000|and|4800|ft|m}}, respectively, above the valley floor. In the park are [[Granite Domes of Yosemite National Park|many domes]].{{cn|date=November 2020}}

The high country of Yosemite contains beautiful areas such as [[Tuolumne Meadows]], [[Dana Meadows (California)|Dana Meadows]], the [[Clark Range (California)|Clark Range]], the [[Cathedral Range]], and the [[Kuna Crest]]. The Sierra crest and the [[Pacific Crest Trail]] run through Yosemite, with peaks of red metamorphic rock, such as Mount Dana and [[Mount Gibbs]], and granite peaks, such as [[Mount Conness]]. [[Mount Lyell (California)|Mount Lyell]] is the highest point in the park, standing at {{convert|13,120|ft|m}}.  The Lyell Glacier is the largest glacier in Yosemite National Park and is one of the few remaining in the Sierra Nevada today.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

The park has three groves of ancient giant sequoia (''Sequoiadendron giganteum'') trees; the Mariposa Grove (200 trees), the [[Tuolumne Grove]] (25 trees), and the [[Merced Grove]] (20 trees).&lt;ref name=&quot;GeologyNP340&quot;/&gt; This species grows larger in volume than any other and is one of the tallest and longest-lived.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiver227&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kiver|Harris|1999|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Valley View Yosemite August 2013 002.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Merced River]] flowing through [[Yosemite Valley]], a [[U-shaped valley]]]]
The Tuolumne and Merced River systems originate along the crest of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in the park and have carved river canyons {{convert|3000|to|4000|ft|m}} deep. The Tuolumne River drains the entire northern portion of the park, an area of approximately {{convert|680|mi2|km2}}. The Merced River begins in the park's southern peaks, primarily the Cathedral and Clark Ranges, and drains an area of approximately {{convert|511|mi2|km2}}.&lt;ref name = &quot;water overview&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Water Overview | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/nature/water.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107180730/http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/nature/water.htm|archivedate=January 7, 2007 | publisher = National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | date = December 22, 2004 | accessdate = January 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrologic processes, including [[glaciation]], flooding, and fluvial geomorphic response, have been fundamental in creating landforms in the park.&lt;ref name = &quot;water overview&quot;/&gt; The park also contains approximately 3,200 lakes (greater than 100 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), two [[reservoir (water)|reservoirs]], and {{convert|1700|mi|km}} of streams, all of which help form these two large [[Drainage basin|watersheds]].&lt;ref name = &quot;hydrology&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Hydrology and Watersheds | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/nature/wtr_hydrology.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100728075552/http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/nature/wtr_hydrology.htm | archivedate = July 28, 2010 | publisher = National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | date = December 22, 2004 | accessdate = January 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wetland]]s in Yosemite occur in valley bottoms throughout the park, and are often hydrologically linked to nearby lakes and rivers through seasonal flooding and groundwater movement. Meadow habitats, distributed at elevations from {{convert|3000|to|11000|ft|m}} in the park, are generally wetlands, as are the [[riparian]] habitats found on the banks of Yosemite's numerous streams and rivers.&lt;ref name = &quot;wetland vegetation&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Wetland Vegetation | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/nature/veg_wetlands.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100419080619/http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/nature/veg_wetlands.htm | archivedate = April 19, 2010 | publisher = National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | date = December 22, 2004 | accessdate = January 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bridalveil Fall and valley.JPG|thumb|[[Bridalveil Fall]] flows from a U-shaped hanging valley that was created by a tributary glacier.]]
Yosemite is famous for its [[List of waterfalls in Yosemite National Park|high concentration of waterfalls]] in a small area. Numerous sheer drops, glacial steps and [[hanging valley]]s in the park provide many places for waterfalls to exist, especially during April, May, and June (the snowmelt season). Located in Yosemite Valley, the [[Yosemite Falls]] is the highest in North America at {{convert|2425|ft|m}}. Also in Yosemite Valley is the much lower volume [[Ribbon Fall]]s, which has the highest single vertical drop, {{convert|1612|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiver227&quot;/&gt; Perhaps the most prominent of the Yosemite Valley waterfalls is [[Bridalveil Fall (Yosemite)|Bridalveil Fall]], which is the waterfall seen from the Tunnel View viewpoint at the east end of the Wawona Tunnel. Wapama Falls in Hetch Hetchy Valley is another notable waterfall. Hundreds of [[ephemeral]] waterfalls also exist in the park.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

All glaciers in the park are relatively small glaciers that occupy areas that are in almost permanent shade, such as north- and northeast-facing [[cirque (landform)|cirques]]. [[Lyell Glacier]] is the largest glacier in Yosemite (the Palisades Glaciers are the largest in the Sierra Nevada) and covers {{convert|160|acre}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;GeologyUSP228&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kiver|Harris|1999|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of the Yosemite glaciers are a remnant of the much, much larger [[Ice Age]] alpine glaciers responsible for sculpting the Yosemite landscape. Instead, they were formed during one of the [[neoglacial]] episodes that have occurred since the thawing of the Ice Age (such as the [[Little Ice Age]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;GeologyNP340&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1998|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Climate change]] has reduced the number and size of glaciers around the world. Many Yosemite glaciers, including Merced Glacier, which was discovered by John Muir in 1871 and bolstered his glacial origins theory of the Yosemite area, have disappeared and most of the others have lost up to 75% of their surface area.&lt;ref name=&quot;GeologyUSP228&quot;/&gt;

===Climate===
[[File:El Capitan at fall.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Yosemite in [[autumn]]]]
Yosemite has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Csa''), meaning most precipitation falls during the mild winter, and the other seasons are nearly dry (less than 3% of precipitation falls during the long, hot summers).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wuerthner8&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Wuerthner|1994|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of [[orographic lift]], precipitation increases with elevation up to {{convert|8000|ft|m}} where it slowly decreases to the crest. Precipitation amounts vary from {{convert|36|in|mm}} at {{convert|4000|ft|m}} elevation to {{convert|50|in|mm}} at {{convert|8600|ft|m}}. Snow does not typically persist on the ground until November in the high country. It accumulates all winter and into March or early April.&lt;ref name=&quot;climate&quot;&gt;{{cite web | publisher = National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/nature/wtr_climate.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101113353/http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/nature/wtr_climate.htm|archivedate=January 1, 2007 | title = Climate | date = December 22, 2004 | accessdate = January 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mean daily temperatures range from {{convert|25|°F|0}} to {{convert|53|°F|0}} at Tuolumne Meadows at {{convert|8600|ft|m}}. At the Wawona Entrance (elevation {{convert|5130|ft|m|disp=or}}), mean daily temperature ranges from {{convert|36|to|67|°F|°C}}. At the lower elevations below {{convert|5000|ft|m}}, temperatures are hotter; the mean daily high temperature at Yosemite Valley (elevation {{convert|3966|ft|m|disp=or}}) varies from {{convert|46|to|90|°F|°C}}. At elevations above {{convert|8000|ft|m}}, the hot, dry summer temperatures are moderated by frequent summer thunderstorms, along with snow that can persist into July. The combination of dry vegetation, low relative humidity, and thunderstorms results in frequent lightning-caused [[wildfire|fires]] as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;climate&quot;/&gt;

At the park headquarters, with an elevation of {{convert|3966|ft}}, January averages {{convert|38.2|°F|1}}, while July averages {{convert|73.0|°F|1}}, though in summer the nights are much cooler than the hot days.&lt;ref name= NCDC2 &gt;{{cite web |url = https://w2.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=hnx |title = NOWData&amp;nbsp;– NOAA Online Weather Data |publisher =[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |accessdate = June 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are an average of 39.5 days with highs of {{convert|90|°F|0}} or higher and an average of 97.9 nights with freezing temperatures.&lt;ref name= NCDC2 /&gt; Freezing temperatures have been recorded in every month of the year. The record high temperature was {{convert|115|°F|0}} on July 20, 1915, while the record low temperature was {{convert|-6|°F|0}} on January 2, 1924 and on January 21, 1937.&lt;ref name= NCDC2 /&gt;&lt;ref name = WRCC&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?ca9855 |title = Yosemite Park HDQTRS, California |publisher= Western Regional Climate Center |accessdate = June 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Average annual precipitation is nearly {{convert|37|in|0}}, falling on 65 days.

===Tectonic and volcanic activity===
[[File:Map of Yosemite National Park.svg|thumb|Generalized geologic map of the Yosemite area (based on a [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] image)]]
The area of the park was astride a [[passive continental margin]] during the [[Precambrian]] and early [[Paleozoic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GeologyNP328&quot;/&gt; Sediment was derived from continental sources and was deposited in shallow water. These rocks have since been deformed and metamorphosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of Late Jurassic-early Miocene sedimentationand plate-tectonic evolution of northern California: illuminatingexample of an accretionary margin|first=WG|last=Ernst|journal=Chin.

Heat generated from the [[Farallon Plate]] [[subduction|subducting]] below the [[North American Plate]] led to the creation of an [[island arc]] of volcanoes on the west coast of proto-North America between the late [[Devonian]] and [[Permian]] periods.&lt;ref name=&quot;GeologyNP328&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1998|p=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later volcanism in the [[Jurassic]] intruded and covered these rocks in what may have been magmatic activity associated with the early stages of the creation of the Sierra Nevada Batholith. 95% of these rocks were eventually removed by uplifted-accelerated erosion.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

The first phase of regional [[intrusion (geology)|plutonism]] started 210&amp;nbsp;million years ago in the late Triassic and continued throughout the Jurassic to about 150&amp;nbsp;million years before present ([[Before Present|BP]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;GeologyNP329&quot;/&gt; Around the same time, the [[Nevadan orogeny]] built the Nevadan mountain range (also called the Ancestral Sierra Nevada) to a height of {{convert|15000|ft|m}}. This was directly part of the creation of the Sierra Nevada Batholith, and the resulting rocks were mostly granitic in composition and emplaced about {{convert|6|mi|km}} below the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;GeologyNP337&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1998|p=337}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second major pluton emplacement phase lasted from about 120&amp;nbsp;million to 80&amp;nbsp;million years ago during the [[Cretaceous]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GeologyNP329&quot;/&gt; This was part of the [[Sevier orogeny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Yonkee|first1=W. Adolph|last2=Weil|first2=Arlo Brandon|date=2015-11-01|title=Tectonic evolution of the Sevier and Laramide belts within the North American Cordillera orogenic system|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825215300258|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|language=en|volume=150|pages=531–593|doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2015.08.001|bibcode=2015ESRv..150..531Y|issn=0012-8252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting 20&amp;nbsp;million years ago (in the [[Cenozoic]]) and lasting until 5&amp;nbsp;million years ago, a now-extinct extension of [[Cascade Range]] volcanoes erupted, bringing large amounts of igneous material in the area. These igneous deposits blanketed the region north of the Yosemite region. Volcanic activity persisted past 5&amp;nbsp;million years BP east of the current park borders in the Mono Lake and [[Long Valley Caldera|Long Valley]] areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Geology of the Sierra Nevada|last = Hill|first = Mary|location = Berkeley, California|publisher = University of California Press|year = 2006|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uplift and erosion===
[[File:Half Dome from Glacier Point, Yosemite NP - Diliff.jpg|thumb|[[Exfoliation joint]]s cause erosion in granitic rocks, creating many [[Granite dome|domes]] including [[Half Dome]].]]
Starting 10&amp;nbsp;million years ago, vertical movement along the Sierra fault started to uplift the Sierra Nevada. Subsequent tilting of the Sierra block and the resulting accelerated uplift of the Sierra Nevada increased the [[gradient]] of western-flowing streams.&lt;ref name=&quot;GeologyNP339&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1998|p=339}}&lt;/ref&gt; The streams consequently ran faster and thus cut their valleys more quickly. Additional uplift occurred when major faults developed to the east, especially the creation of [[Owens Valley]] from [[Basin and Range Province|Basin and Range]]-associated extensional forces. Uplift of the Sierra accelerated again about two million years ago during the [[Pleistocene]].{{cn|date=September 2020}}

The uplifting and increased erosion exposed granitic rocks in the area to surface pressures, resulting in exfoliation (responsible for the rounded shape of the many domes in the park) and mass wasting following the numerous fracture joint planes (cracks; especially vertical ones) in the now solidified plutons.&lt;ref name=&quot;GeologyNP332&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1998|p=332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pleistocene glaciers further accelerated this process and the larger ones transported the resulting [[scree|talus]] and [[till]] from valley floors.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

Numerous vertical joint planes controlled where and how fast erosion took place. Most of these long, linear and very deep cracks trend northeast or northwest and form parallel, often regularly spaced sets. They were created by uplift-associated pressure release and by the unloading of overlying rock via erosion.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

===Sculpting by glaciers===
[[File:Glacially polished granite.jpg|thumbnail|Glacially polished granite [[cirque]] in upper [[Tenaya Canyon]]]]
A series of glaciations further modified the region starting about 2 to 3&amp;nbsp;million years ago and ending sometime around 10,000 BP. At least four major glaciations have occurred in the Sierra Nevada, locally called the Sherwin (also called the pre-Tahoe), Tahoe, Tenaya, and Tioga.&lt;ref name=&quot;GeologyNP339&quot;/&gt; The Sherwin glaciers were the largest, filling Yosemite and other valleys, while later stages produced much smaller glaciers. A Sherwin-age glacier was almost surely responsible for the major excavation and shaping of Yosemite Valley and other canyons in the area.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

Glacial systems reached depths of up to {{convert|4000|ft|m}} and left their marks in the Yosemite area. The longest glacier in the Yosemite area ran down the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne River for {{convert|60|mi|km}}, passing well beyond Hetch Hetchy Valley. Merced Glacier flowed out of Yosemite Valley and into the Merced River Gorge. Lee Vining Glacier carved Lee Vining Canyon and emptied into Lake Russel (the much-enlarged ice age version of Mono Lake). Only the highest peaks, such as Mount Dana and Mount Conness, were not covered by glaciers. Retreating glaciers often left recessional [[moraine]]s that impounded lakes such as the {{convert|5.5|mi|km|0}} long Lake Yosemite (a shallow lake that periodically covered much of the floor of Yosemite Valley).&lt;ref name=&quot;GeologyNP333&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1998|p=333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taken together, the park's varied [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]] support over 250 species of [[vertebrate]]s, which include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.&lt;ref name = &quot;wildlife&quot;&gt;{{NPS| title = Wildlife Overview | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/nature/wildlife.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127153544/http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/nature/wildlife.htm|archivedate=January 27, 2007 | publisher = National Park Service: Yosemite Park Service | date = December 22, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Yosemite's western boundary has habitats dominated by [[mixed coniferous forest]]s of [[ponderosa pine]], [[sugar pine]], [[incense cedar]], [[white fir]], [[Douglas fir]], and a few stands of giant sequoia, interspersed by areas of [[California black oak|black oak]] and [[Live oak|canyon live oak]]. A relatively high diversity of wildlife species is supported by these habitats, because of relatively mild, lower-elevation climate and the mixture of habitat types and plant species. Wildlife species typically found in these habitats include [[American black bear|black bear]], [[coyote]], raccoon, [[Kingsnake|mountain kingsnake]], [[Gilbert's skink]], [[white-headed woodpecker]], [[bobcat]], [[North American river otter|river otter]], [[gray fox]], [[red fox]], [[brown creeper]], two species of skunk, [[North American cougar|cougar]], [[spotted owl]], and a wide variety of bat species.&lt;ref name=&quot;wildlife&quot;/&gt;

Going higher in elevation, the coniferous forests become purer stands of [[Fir|red fir]], [[western white pine]], [[Jeffrey pine]], [[lodgepole pine]], and the occasional [[foxtail pine]]. Fewer wildlife species tend to be found in these habitats, because of their higher elevation and lower complexity. Species likely to be found include [[golden-mantled ground squirrel]], [[chickaree]], [[Fisher (animal)|fisher]], [[Steller's jay]], [[hermit thrush]], and [[northern goshawk]]. Reptiles are not common, but include [[rubber boa]], [[western fence lizard]], and [[northern alligator lizard]].&lt;ref name = &quot;wildlife&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Marmota flaviventris (Yellow Bellied Marmot), Yosemite NP - Diliff.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yellow-bellied marmot|Marmot]] in [[Tuolumne Meadows]]]]
As the landscape rises, trees become smaller and more sparse, with stands broken by areas of exposed granite. These include lodgepole pine, [[whitebark pine]], and [[mountain hemlock]] that, at highest elevations, give way to vast expanses of granite as treeline is reached. The climate in these habitats is harsh and the growing season is short, but species such as [[American pika|pika]], [[yellow-bellied marmot]], white-tailed [[jackrabbit]], [[Clark's nutcracker]], and [[black rosy finch]] are adapted to these conditions. Also, the treeless alpine habitats are the areas favored by [[Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep]]. This species, however, is now found in the Yosemite area only around Tioga Pass, where a small, reintroduced population exists.&lt;ref name = &quot;wildlife&quot;/&gt;

At a variety of elevations, meadows provide important, productive habitat for wildlife. Animals come to feed on the green [[Poaceae|grasses]] and use the flowing and standing water found in many meadows. Predators, in turn, are attracted to these areas. The interface between meadow and forest is also favored by many animal species because of the proximity of open areas for foraging and cover for protection. Species that are highly dependent upon meadow habitat include [[great grey owl]], [[willow flycatcher]], [[Yosemite toad]], and [[mountain beaver]].&lt;ref name = &quot;wildlife&quot;/&gt;

===Management issues===
[[File:YosemiteBlackBearTagged wb.jpg|thumb|A [[American black bear|black bear]] with an ear tag in Yosemite Valley]]
The black bears of Yosemite were once famous for breaking into parked cars to steal food. They were also an encouraged tourist sight for many years at the park's garbage dumps, where bears congregated to eat park visitors' garbage and tourists gathered to photograph the bears. Increasing encounters between bears and humans and increasing damage to property led to an aggressive campaign to discourage bears from relying on human food or interacting with people and their property. The open-air dumps were closed; all trash receptacles were replaced with [[bear-resistant food storage container|bear-proof]] receptacles; all campgrounds were equipped with bear-proof food lockers so that people would not leave food in their vehicles, which were easy targets for the powerful and resourceful bears. Because bears who show aggression towards people usually are eventually destroyed, park personnel have continued to come up with innovative ways to have bears associate humans and their property with unpleasant experiences, such as being hit with [[rubber bullet]]s. Today,{{when|date=November 2020}} about 30 bears a year are captured and [[ear tag|ear-tagged]] and their [[DNA]] is sampled so that, when bear damage occurs, rangers can ascertain which bear is causing the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/04/0423_wirebears.html | title= DNA to Help Identify &quot;Problem&quot; Bears at Yosemite | magazine= National Geographic | date = April 23, 2001 | accessdate=January 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{needs update|date=November 2020}}

Despite the richness of high-quality habitats in Yosemite, the [[brown bear]], [[California condor]], and [[least Bell's vireo]] have become extinct in the park within historical time,&lt;ref name = &quot;snepTerrestrialVertebrates&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | first = David M. | last = Graber | chapter = 25: Status of Terrestrial Vertebrates | year = 1996 | pages = 709–734 | title = Sierra Nevada Ecosystem Project.

The most serious current threats to Yosemite's wildlife and the ecosystems they occupy include loss of a natural fire regime, [[exotic species]], air pollution, [[habitat fragmentation]], and climate change. On a more local basis, factors such as [[road kill]]s and the availability of human food have affected some wildlife species.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

[[File:Yellow star thistle.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|The [[Centaurea solstitialis|yellow star thistle]] competes with Yosemite's native plants.{{cn|date=November 2020}}]]
Yosemite National Park has documented more than 130 non-native plant species within park boundaries. These non-native plants were introduced into Yosemite following the migration of early [[European colonization of the Americas|Euro-American]] settlers in the late 1850s. Natural and human-caused disturbances, such as wildland fires and construction activities, have contributed to a rapid increase in the spread of non-native plants. A number of these species aggressively invade and displace the native plant communities, resulting in impacts on the park's resources. Non-native plants can bring about significant changes in park ecosystems by altering the native plant communities and the processes that support them. Some non-native species may cause an increase in the fire frequency of an area or increase the available nitrogen in the soil that may allow more non-native plants to become established. Many non-native species, such as [[Centaurea solstitialis|yellow star thistle]] (''Centaurea solstitialis''), are able to produce a long [[tap root]] that allows them to out-compete the native plants for available water.&lt;ref name = &quot;exotic&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/nature/veg_exotics.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102234435/http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/nature/veg_exotics.htm|archivedate=January 2, 2007 | title= Exotic Plants | date = December 22, 2004| publisher= National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | accessdate= January 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bull thistle (''[[Cirsium vulgare]]''), common mullein (''[[Verbascum thapsus]]''), and Klamath weed (''[[Hypericum perforatum]]'') have been identified as noxious [[pest (organism)|pests]] in Yosemite since the 1940s. Additional species that have been recognized more recently as aggressive and requiring control are yellow star thistle (''Centaurea solstitialis''), sweet clover (''[[Melilot]]'' spp.), Himalayan blackberry (''[[Rubus armeniacus]]''), cut-leaved blackberry (''[[Rubus laciniatus]]'') and large periwinkle (''[[Vinca major]]'').&lt;ref name = &quot;exotic&quot;/&gt;

Increasing [[ozone]] pollution is causing tissue damage to the massive giant sequoia trees in the park, making them more vulnerable to insect infestation and disease. Since the [[conifer cone|cones]] of these trees require fire-touched soil to [[germination|germinate]], historic [[Wildfire#Suppression|fire suppression]] has reduced these trees' ability to reproduce. The current policy of setting [[prescribed fire]]s is expected to help the germination issue.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

Yosemite Valley is open year-round and numerous activities are available through the [[National Park Service]], Yosemite Conservancy, and [[Aramark]] at Yosemite, including nature walks, photography and art classes, stargazing programs, tours, bike rentals, rafting, mule and horseback rides, and rock climbing classes. Many people enjoy short walks and longer hikes to waterfalls in Yosemite Valley, or walks among giant sequoias in the Mariposa, Tuolumne, or Merced Groves. Others like to drive or take a tour bus to Glacier Point (summer–fall) to see views of Yosemite Valley and the high country, or drive along the scenic [[Tioga Road]] to Tuolumne Meadows (May–October) and go for a walk or hike.

Most park visitors stay just for the day, and visit only those locations within Yosemite Valley that are easily accessible by automobile. There is a [[United States dollar|US$]]25–30 per automobile user fee to enter the park, depending on the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/feesandreservations.htm | title = Fees and Reservations}} National Park Service: Yosemite National Park.

In addition to exploring the natural features of the park, visitors can also learn about the natural and cultural history of Yosemite Valley at a number of facilities in the valley: the Yosemite Valley Visitor Center, the adjoining Yosemite Museum, and the Nature Center at Happy Isles. There are also two [[National Historic Landmark]]s: the [[Sierra Club]]'s [[LeConte Memorial Lodge]] (Yosemite's first public visitor center), and the Ahwahnee Hotel.

The park can be divided into five sections for the day-user—Yosemite Valley, Wawona/Mariposa Grove/Glacier Point, Tuolumne Meadows, Hetch Hetchy, and [[Crane Flat Campground|Crane Flat]]/White Wolf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.yosemitehikes.com/hikes.htm|title = Yosemite Hikes|first = Russ|last = Cary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous books describe park trails, and free information is available from the National Park Service in Yosemite. Park rangers encourage visitors to experience portions of the park in addition to Yosemite Valley.

Between late spring and early fall, much of the park can be accessed for multiple-day backpacking trips. All overnight trips into the back country require a wilderness permit&lt;ref name = &quot;permits&quot;/&gt; and most require approved bear-resistant food storage.&lt;ref name = &quot;food storage&quot;&gt;{{cite web | publisher = National Park Service: National Park Service | url = http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/bears.htm| title = Bear and food storage | date = February 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Driving destinations===
{{Further|List of Yosemite destinations}}
While some locations in Yosemite require hiking, other locations can be reached via automobile transportation. Driving locations also allow guests to observe the night sky in locations other than their campsite or lodge. All of the roads in Yosemite are scenic, but the most famous is the Tioga Road, typically open from late May or early June through November.&lt;ref name = &quot;auto touring&quot;&gt;{{cite web | publisher = National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | title = Auto Touring | url =http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/touring.htm | date = December 22, 2004 | accessdate = January 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

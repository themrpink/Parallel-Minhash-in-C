In 1957, Heaney travelled to Belfast to study English Language and Literature at [[Queen's University Belfast]]. While there, he found a copy of [[Ted Hughes]]'s ''Lupercal,'' which spurred him to write poetry. &quot;Suddenly, the matter of contemporary poetry was the material of my own life,&quot; he said.&lt;ref name=bbc_faces_of_the_week&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6279053.stm|title=Faces of the week|date=19 January 2007|access-date=9 April 2010|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in 1961 with a First Class Honours degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=BBC |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/yourplaceandmine/londonderry/A803639.shtml |title=Your Place and Mine: Bellaghy – Seamus Heaney |access-date=12 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During teacher training at St Joseph's Teacher Training College in Belfast (now merged with [[St. Mary's University College (Belfast)|St Mary's, University College]]), Heaney went on a placement to St Thomas' secondary Intermediate School in west Belfast. The headmaster of this school was the writer [[Michael McLaverty]] from [[County Monaghan]], who introduced Heaney to the poetry of [[Patrick Kavanagh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography|publisher=British Council|url=http://www.britishcouncil.org/china-aboutuk-northernireland-literature-poetry-seamus.htm|access-date=23 May 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009142735/http://www.britishcouncil.org/china-aboutuk-northernireland-literature-poetry-seamus.htm|archive-date=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;assets.cambridge.org&quot;&gt;[http://assets.cambridge.org/97805218/38825/frontmatter/9780521838825_frontmatter.pdf Ed.

Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; With McLaverty's mentorship, Heaney first started to publish poetry in 1962. [[Sophia Hillan]] describes how McLaverty was like a foster father to the younger Belfast poet.&lt;ref&gt;Sophia Hillan, ''New Hibernia Review / Iris Éireannach Nua'', Vol. 9, No. 3 (Autumn, 2005), pp. 86–106. &quot;Wintered into Wisdom: Michael McLaverty, Seamus Heaney, and the Northern Word-Hoard&quot;. University of St. Thomas (Center for Irish Studies)&lt;/ref&gt; In the introduction to McLaverty's ''Collected Works,'' Heaney summarised the poet's contribution and influence: &quot;His voice was modestly pitched, he never sought the limelight, yet for all that, his place in our literature is secure.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McLaverty, Michael (2002) ''Collected Short Stories'', Blackstaff Press Ltd, p. xiii, {{ISBN|0-85640-727-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Heaney's poem ''Fosterage'', in the sequence ''Singing School'' from ''[[North (poetry collection)|North]]'' (1975), is dedicated to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/michael-mclaverty-seamus-heaney-and-the-writerly-bond-1.3263062 |work=Irish Times |title=Michael McLaverty, Seamus Heaney and the writerly bond |date=20 October 2017 |author=Sophia Hillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, Heaney became a lecturer at St Joseph's, and in the spring of 1963, after contributing various articles to local magazines, he came to the attention of [[Philip Hobsbaum]], then an English lecturer at Queen's University. Hobsbaum set up a Belfast Group of local young poets (to mirror the success he had with the London group), and Heaney was able to meet other Belfast poets such as [[Derek Mahon]] and [[Michael Longley]]. In August 1965, he married Marie Devlin, a school teacher and native of [[Ardboe]], [[County Tyrone]]. (Also a writer, Devlin published ''Over Nine Waves'' (1994), a collection of traditional Irish myths and legends.) Heaney's first book, ''Eleven Poems,'' was published in November 1965 for the Queen's University Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SRD2K80JYpYC&amp;pg=PA504 |page=504 |title=Nobel Faces: A Gallery of Nobel Prize Winners |author=Peter Badge |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2008|isbn=9783527406784 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, [[Faber and Faber]] published ''[[Death of a Naturalist]]'', his first major volume. This collection was met with much critical acclaim and won several awards, including the Gregory Award for Young Writers and the Geoffrey Faber Prize.&lt;ref name=&quot;assets.cambridge.org&quot;/&gt; Also in 1966, Heaney was appointed as a lecturer in Modern English Literature at [[Queen's University Belfast]]. That year his first son, Michael, was born. A second son, Christopher, was born in 1968. That year Heaney and [[Michael Longley]] undertook a reading tour called ''Room to Rhyme'', which increased awareness of the poet's work. In 1969 he published his second major volume, ''[[Door into the Dark]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/17/door-into-the-dark-seamus-heaney-andrew-motion |work=The Guardian |author=Andrew Motion |title=Door into the Dark opened the portals to a different future |date=17 August 2014|author-link=Andrew Motion }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a spell as guest lecturer at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], Heaney returned in 1971 to Queen's University. In 1972, Heaney left his lectureship at Belfast, moved to [[Wicklow]] in the Republic of Ireland, and began writing on a full-time basis. In the same year, he published ''[[Wintering Out]].'' Over the next few years, Heaney began to give readings throughout Ireland, Great Britain and the United States. In 1975, Heaney published his fourth volume, ''[[North (poetry collection)|North]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1995/heaney/biographical/ |work=Nobel Prize |title=Seamus Heaney}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pamphlet of prose poems entitled ''[[Stations (poetry collection)|Stations]]'' was published the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zfHKH2HlwbYC&amp;pg=PA76 |page=76 |title=Seamus Heaney: The Crisis of Identity |author=Floyd Collins |publisher=University of Delaware Press |year=2003|isbn=9780874138054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became Head of English at [[Carysfort College]] in Dublin in 1976, and he moved with his family to Sandymount in that city. His next volume, ''[[Field Work (poetry collection)|Field Work]],'' was published in 1979. ''[[Selected Poems 1965-1975]]'' and ''Preoccupations: Selected Prose 1968–1978'' were published in 1980. When ''[[Aosdána]],'' the national Irish Arts Council, was established in 1981, Heaney was among those elected into its first group. (He was subsequently elected a ''[[Saoi]],'' one of its five elders and its highest honour, in 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://aosdana.artscouncil.ie/Members/Literature/Heaney.aspx|title=Biography|work=Aosdána}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1981, Heaney traveled to the United States as a visiting professor at Harvard, where he was affiliated with [[Adams House (Harvard University)|Adams House]]. He was awarded two honorary doctorates, from Queen's University and from [[Fordham University]] in New York City (1982). At the Fordham commencement ceremony on 23 May 1982, Heaney delivered his address as a 46-stanza poem entitled &quot;Verses for a Fordham Commencement.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fordhamnotes.blogspot.com/2013/08/seamus-heaneys-verses-for-fordham.html|title=Fordham Notes: Seamus Heaney's &quot;Verses for a Fordham Commencement&quot;|last=Blog|first=News|date=30 August 2013|website=Fordham Notes|access-date=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born and educated in Northern Ireland, Heaney stressed that he was Irish and not British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/502601/20130830/seamus-heaney-died-irish-poet.htm |title=Irish Nobel Prize Poet Seamus Heaney Dies Aged 74 -VIDEO |publisher=Ibtimes.co.uk |access-date=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the success of the [[Field Day Theatre Company]]'s production of [[Brian Friel]]'s ''[[Translations (play)|Translations]],'' the founders Brian Friel and [[Stephen Rea]] decided to make the company a permanent group.

Heaney received a tenure position at Harvard, becoming Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory (formerly Visiting Professor) 1985–1997, and the [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] Poet in Residence at Harvard 1998–2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101214173915/http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=auth189 British Council biography of Heaney]. Retrieved 19 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Heaney received a Litt.D. from [[Bates College]]. His father, Patrick, died in October the same year.&lt;ref name=&quot;parker-2212&quot;/&gt; The loss of both parents within two years affected Heaney deeply, and he expressed his grief in poems.&lt;ref name=&quot;parker-2212&quot;/&gt; In 1988, a collection of his critical essays, ''The Government of the Tongue'', was published.

In 1985 Heaney wrote the poem &quot;From the Republic of Conscience&quot; at the request of [[Amnesty International]] Ireland. He wanted to &quot;celebrate United Nations Day and the work of Amnesty&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seamus Heaney, Poet|url=http://www.frontlinedefenders.org/node/110|website=Frontline Defenders|access-date=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem inspired the title of Amnesty International's highest honor, the [[Ambassador of Conscience Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From the Republic of Conscience|url=http://www.amnesty.ie/RepublicofConscience|website=Amnesty International|access-date=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Heaney donated his lecture notes to the [http://marbl.library.emory.edu/ Manuscripts, Archives, and Rare Book Library] (MARBL) of [[Emory University]] in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, after giving the notable [http://arts.emory.edu/about/special-programs/ellmann-lectures.html [[Ellmann]] Lecture in Modern Literature] there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.emory.edu/stories/2014/01/er_seamus_heaney_exhibit/campus.html &quot;Seamus Heaney Exhibit&quot;], Emory University, January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Heaney was elected [[Professor of Poetry]] at the [[University of Oxford]], which he held for a five-year term to 1994. The chair does not require residence in Oxford. Throughout this period, he was dividing his time between Ireland and the United States. He also continued to give public readings. So well attended and keenly anticipated were these events that those who queued for tickets with such enthusiasm were sometimes dubbed &quot;Heaneyboppers&quot;, suggesting an almost [[teenybopper]] fan base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heaney 'catches the heart off guard'|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2008/10/heaney-%E2%80%98catches-the-heart-off-guard%E2%80%99/|date=2 October 2008|publisher=[[Harvard University]]|work=Harvard News Office|access-date=15 May 2010|quote=Over the years, readings by poet Seamus Heaney have been so wildly popular that his fans are called &quot;Heaneyboppers.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, ''[[The Cure at Troy]]'', his play based on [[Sophocles]]'s ''[[Philoctetes (Sophocles)|Philoctetes]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Play Listing|url=http://www.irishplayography.com/search/play.asp?play_id=617|work=Irish Playography|publisher=Irish Theatre Institute|access-date=24 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published to much acclaim. The next year, he published another volume of poetry, ''[[Seeing Things (poetry)|Seeing Things]]'' (1991). Heaney was named an Honorary Patron of the [[University Philosophical Society]], [[Trinity College, Dublin]], and was elected an Honorary Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]] (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rslit.org/content/fellows |title=Royal Society of Literature All Fellows |publisher=Royal Society of Literature |access-date=9 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305070326/http://www.rslit.org/content/fellows |archive-date= 5 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Heaney guest-edited ''[[The Mays]] Anthology'', a collection of new writing from students at the University of Oxford and [[University of Cambridge]]. That same year, he was awarded the [[Dickinson College]] Arts Award and returned to the Pennsylvania college to deliver the commencement address and receive an honorary degree. He was scheduled to return to Dickinson again to receive the Harold and Ethel L. Stellfox Award—for a major literary figure—at the time of his death in 2013. Irish poet [[Paul Muldoon]] was named recipient of the award that year, partly in recognition of the close connection between the two poets.

Heaney was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1995 for what the Nobel committee described as &quot;works of lyrical beauty and ethical depth, which exalt everyday miracles and the living past&quot;.&lt;ref name=nobel_prize&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1995|publisher=Nobelprize|date=7 October 2010|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1995/|access-date=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was on holiday in Greece with his wife when the news broke. Neither journalists nor his own children could reach him until he arrived at [[Dublin Airport]] two days later, although an Irish television camera traced him to [[Kalamata]]. Asked how he felt to have his name added to the Irish Nobel pantheon of [[W. B. Yeats]], [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[Samuel Beckett]], Heaney responded: &quot;It's like being a little foothill at the bottom of a mountain range. You hope you just live up to it. It's extraordinary.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;laureate&quot;/&gt; He and his wife Marie were immediately taken from the airport to [[Áras an Uachtaráin]] for champagne with [[President of Ireland|President]] [[Mary Robinson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;laureate&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/12/20/specials/heaney-laureate.html|title=Laureate and Symbol, Heaney Returns Home|first=James F.|last=Clarity|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=9 October 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would refer to the prize discreetly as &quot;the N thing&quot; in personal exchanges with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Rosita|last=Boland|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/michael-longley-being-77-and-three-quarters-is-the-best-time-of-my-life-1.3097831|title=Michael Longley: 'Being 77 and three-quarters is the best time of my life'|work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=17 June 2017|access-date=17 June 2017|quote='Seamus once thanked me for the way I dealt with what he called 'the N Thing',' Longley says, making tea.

But I have had to be very judicious answering questions about Seamus since he’s been turned into a kind of saint'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heaney's 1996 collection ''[[The Spirit Level (poetry)|The Spirit Level]]'' won the [[Costa Book Awards|Whitbread Book of the Year Award]]; he repeated the success in 1999 with ''[[Beowulf: A New Verse Translation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rambles.net/heaney_beowulf.html|title=Beowulf: A New Translation |publisher=Rambles.net|access-date=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He spoke at the [[Féile an Phobail|West Belfast Festival 2010]] in celebration of his mentor, the poet and novelist [[Michael McLaverty]], who had helped Heaney to first publish his poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.feilebelfast.com/news/august-feile-2010-programme-online/ |title=Féile an Phobail, Festival of the People, 2010 programme |access-date=12 July 2010 |work=Official website |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823030106/http://www.feilebelfast.com/news/august-feile-2010-programme-online/ |archive-date=23 August 2010 }} Archived at Wayback Engine.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
In 2010, Faber published ''[[Human Chain (poetry collection)|Human Chain]]'', Heaney's twelfth collection. ''Human Chain'' was awarded the [[Forward Prize|Forward Poetry Prize]] for Best Collection, one of the major poetry prizes Heaney had never previously won, despite having been twice shortlisted.&lt;ref name=benedicte_page_forward_prize&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/06/seamus-heaney-forward-poetry-prize?INTCMP=SRCH|title=Seamus Heaney wins £10k Forward poetry prize for Human Chain|date=6 October 2010|access-date=6 October 2010|first=Benedicte|last=Page|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/22/seamus-heaney-human-chain-faber?INTCMP=SRCH|title=Human Chain by Seamus Heaney|date=22 August 2010|access-date=22 August 2010|first=Kate|last=Kellaway|work=The Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book, published 44 years after the poet's first, was inspired in part by Heaney's stroke in 2006, which left him &quot;babyish&quot; and &quot;on the brink&quot;. Poet and Forward judge [[Ruth Padel]] described the work as &quot;a collection of painful, honest and delicately weighted poems ... a wonderful and humane achievement.&quot;&lt;ref name=benedicte_page_forward_prize/&gt; Writer [[Colm Tóibín]] described ''Human Chain'' as &quot;his best single volume for many years, and one that contains some of the best poems he has written... is a book of shades and memories, of things whispered, of journeys into the underworld, of elegies and translations, of echoes and silences.&quot;&lt;ref name=toibin_human_chain&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/21/seamus-heaney-human-chain-review|title=Human Chain by Seamus Heaney – review|first=Colm|last=Tóibín|author-link=Colm Tóibín|newspaper=The Guardian|date=21 August 2010|access-date=21 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2010, the collection was shortlisted for the [[T. S. Eliot Prize]].

Heaney was named one of &quot;Britain's top 300 intellectuals&quot; by ''[[The Observer]]'' in 2011, though the newspaper later published a correction acknowledging that &quot;several individuals who would not claim to be British&quot; had been featured, of which Heaney was one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/may/08/top-300-british-intellectuals|title=Britain's top 300 intellectuals|date=8 May 2011|access-date=8 May 2011|first=John|last=Naughton|work=The Observer|publisher=Guardian Media Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year,&lt;!-- 2011 --&gt; he contributed translations of [[Old Irish]] [[marginalia]] for ''[[Songs of the Scribe]]'', an album by Traditional Singer in Residence of the Seamus Heaney Centre for Poetry, [[Pádraigín Ní Uallacháin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://journalofmusic.com/radar/songs-scribe-sung-padraigin-ni-uallachain &quot;Songs of the Scribe Sung by Pádraigín Ní Uallacháin&quot;]. ''Journal of Music''. 6 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, he donated his personal literary notes to the [[National Library of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/arts/seamus-heaney-declutters-home-and-donates-personal-notes-to-national-library-2970392.html|title=Seamus Heaney declutters home and donates personal notes to National Library|date=21 December 2011|access-date=21 December 2011|first=Lyndsey|last=Telford|work=Irish Independent|publisher=Independent News &amp; Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though he admitted he would likely have earned a fortune by auctioning them, Heaney personally packed up the boxes of notes and drafts and, accompanied by his son Michael, delivered them to the National Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Anne|last=Madden|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/seamus-heaneys-papers-go-to-dublin-but-we-dont-mind-insists-qub-28694856.html|title=Seamus Heaney's papers go to Dublin, but we don't mind, insists QUB|newspaper=The Belfast Telegraph|date=22 December 2011|access-date=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, Heaney accepted the [[Griffin Poetry Prize|Griffin Trust for Excellence in Poetry's Lifetime Recognition Award]] and gave a speech in honour of the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Griffin Poetry|last=Prize|url=http://www.griffinpoetryprize.com/awards-and-poets/lifetime-recognition-award/2012-seamus-heaney/|title=2012 – Seamus Heaney|newspaper=Griffin Poetry Prize|date=7 June 2012|access-date=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heaney was compiling a collection of his work in anticipation of ''Selected Poems 1988–2013'' at the time of his death. The selection includes poems and writings from ''Seeing Things'', ''The Spirit Level'', the translation of ''[[Beowulf: A New Verse Translation|Beowulf]]'', ''Electric Light'', ''District and Circle'', and ''Human Chain'' (fall 2014).

In February 2014, [[Emory University]] premiered ''Seamus Heaney: The Music of What Happens'', the first major exhibition to celebrate the life and work of Seamus Heaney since his death.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.library.emory.edu/news-events/exhibitions/seamus-heaney-the-music-of-what-happens.html|website=Emory Library|title=Seamus Heaney: The Music of What Happens}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibit holds a display of the surface of Heaney's personal writing desk that he used in the 1980s as well as old photographs and personal correspondence with other writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlantaplanit.com/events/event.php?eid=55136|title=Seamus Heaney: The Music of What Happens|access-date=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Heaney died in August 2013, during the exhibition's curatorial process. Though the exhibit's original vision to celebrate Heaney's life and work remains at the forefront, there is a small section commemorating his death and its influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://emorywheel.com/woodruff-library-welcomes-seamus-heaney-exhibit/|title=Woodruff Library Welcomes Seamus Heaney Exhibit|date=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, it was announced that Heaney's family would posthumously publish his translation of Book VI of [[The Aeneid]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/10/new-seamus-heaney-translation-to-be-published-next-year|title=New Seamus Heaney translation to be published next year|author=Alison Flood|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His funeral was broadcast live the following day on [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] television and radio and was streamed internationally at RTÉ's website. [[RTÉ Radio 1 Extra]] transmitted a continuous broadcast, from 8 a.m. to 9:15&amp;nbsp;p.m. on the day of the funeral, of his ''[[Seamus Heaney Collected Poems|Collected Poems]]'' album, recorded by Heaney in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejournal.ie/seamus-heaney-funeral-1063647-Sep2013/ &quot;Funeral of Seamus Heaney to be broadcast live on RTÉ&quot;], TheJournal.ie, 1 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; His poetry collections sold out rapidly in Irish bookshops immediately following his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/heaney-books-sell-out-amid-massive-demand-1.1517133 &quot;Heaney books sell out amid massive demand&quot;], ''Irish Times,'' 5 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many tributes were paid to Heaney. President [[Michael D. Higgins]] said: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;...we in Ireland will once again get a sense of the depth and range of the contribution of Seamus Heaney to our contemporary world, but what those of us who have had the privilege of his friendship and presence will miss is the extraordinary depth and warmth of his personality...Generations of Irish people will have been familiar with Seamus' poems. Scholars all over the world will have gained from the depth of the critical essays, and so many rights organisations will want to thank him for all the solidarity he gave to the struggles within the republic of conscience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.president.ie/uncategorized/statement-from-aras-an-uachtarain-seamus-heaney/ Statement from Áras an Uachtaráin – Seamus Heaney] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525232149/http://www.president.ie/uncategorized/statement-from-aras-an-uachtarain-seamus-heaney/ |date=25 May 2014 }} Áras an Uachtaráin, 30 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;President Higgins also appeared live from [[Áras an Uachtaráin]] on the [[RTÉ News: Nine O'Clock|''Nine O'Clock News'']] in a five-minute segment in which he paid tribute to Seamus Heaney.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|_RB3Agnpz14|President Michael D Higgins pays tribute to his friend Seamus Heaney}} RTÉ News, 31 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill Clinton]], former President of the United States, said: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Both his stunning work and his life were a gift to the world. His mind, heart, and his uniquely Irish gift for language made him our finest poet of the rhythms of ordinary lives and a powerful voice for peace...His wonderful work, like that of his fellow Irish Nobel Prize winners Shaw, Yeats, and Beckett, will be a lasting gift for all the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;tributes-bbc&quot;&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-23899646 Tributes to Seamus Heaney], BBC News Northern Ireland, 30 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[José Manuel Barroso]], European Commission president, said: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;I am greatly saddened today to learn of the death of Seamus Heaney, one of the great European poets of our lifetime. ... The strength, beauty and character of his words will endure for generations to come and were rightly recognised with the Nobel Prize for Literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;tributes-bbc&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Harvard University issued a statement: &lt;blockquote&gt;We are fortunate and proud to have counted Seamus Heaney as a revered member of the Harvard family.

We will remember him with deep affection and admiration.&lt;ref name=&quot;tributes-bbc&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Quote box |width=300px|align=right|quoted=true|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|salign=left|quote =

In order that human beings bring about the most radiant conditions for themselves to inhabit, it is essential that the vision of reality which poetry offers should be transformative, more than just a printout of the given circumstances of its time and place. The poet who would be most the poet has to attempt an act of writing that outstrips the conditions even as it observes them.

|source =—from &quot;''Joy Or Night: Last Things in the Poetry of W. B. Yeats and Philip Larkin''&quot;, W. D. Thomas Memorial Lecture delivered by Seamus Heaney at University College of Swansea on 18 January 1993.}}

===Naturalism===
At one time, Heaney's books made up two-thirds of the sales of living poets in the UK.&lt;ref name=bbc_faces_of_the_week/&gt; His work often deals with the local surroundings of Ireland, particularly in Northern Ireland, where he was born and lived until young adulthood. Speaking of his early life and education, he commented, &quot;I learned that my local County Derry experience, which I had considered archaic and irrelevant to 'the modern world', was to be trusted. They taught me that trust and helped me to articulate it.&quot;&lt;ref name=poetry_foundation/&gt; ''Death of a Naturalist'' (1966) and ''Door into the Dark'' (1969) mostly focus on the details of rural, parochial life.&lt;ref name=poetry_foundation/&gt;

In a number of volumes, beginning with ''Door into the Dark'' (1969) and ''Wintering Out'' (1972), Heaney also spent a significant amount of time writing on the northern Irish bog. Particularly of note is the collection of bog body poems in [[North (poetry collection)|''North'']] (1975), featuring mangled bodies preserved in the bog. In a review by Ciaran Carson, he said that the bog poems made Heaney into &quot;the laureate of violence—a mythmaker, an anthropologist of ritual killing...the world of megalithic doorways and charming noble barbarity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Donoghue|first1=Bernard|title=The Cambridge Companion to Seamus Heaney|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poems such as &quot;Bogland&quot; and &quot;Bog Queen&quot; addressed political struggles directly for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0LZlAAAAMAAJ |page=5 |title=The body and desire in contemporary Irish poetry |author=Irene Gilsenan Nordin |publisher=Irish Academic Press |year=2006|isbn=9780716533689 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
Allusions to sectarian difference, widespread in Northern Ireland through his lifetime, can be found in his poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://independentleft.ie/seamus-heaney-political-poems/ |work=[[Independent Left (Ireland)]] |author=Ciarán O'Rourke |title=Did Seamus Heaney Write Political Poems?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://trinity.duke.edu/node/1637 |work=[[Duke University]] |author=Ezgi Ustundag |title=Expressing Humanity During 'The Troubles:' The Poetry of Seamus Heaney}}&lt;/ref&gt; His books ''Wintering Out'' (1973) and ''North'' (1975) seek to interweave commentary on [[the Troubles]] with a historical context and wider human experience.&lt;ref name=poetry_foundation&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/seamus-heaney|title=Biography|work=Poetry Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some critics accused Heaney of being &quot;an apologist and a mythologiser&quot; of the violence, [[Blake Morrison]] suggests the poet &lt;blockquote&gt;has written poems directly about the Troubles as well as elegies for friends and acquaintances who have died in them; he has tried to discover a historical framework in which to interpret the current unrest; and he has taken on the mantle of public spokesman, someone looked to for comment and guidance... Yet he has also shown signs of deeply resenting this role, defending the right of poets to be private and apolitical, and questioning the extent to which poetry, however &quot;committed&quot;, can influence the course of history.&lt;ref name=poetry_foundation/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shaun O'Connell in the ''New Boston Review'' notes that &quot;those who see Seamus Heaney as a symbol of hope in a troubled land are not, of course, wrong to do so, though they may be missing much of the undercutting complexities of his poetry, the backwash of ironies which make him as bleak as he is bright.&quot;&lt;ref name=poetry_foundation/&gt; O'Connell notes in his ''Boston Review'' critique of ''[[Station Island (poetry collection)|Station Island]]'': 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Again and again Heaney pulls back from political purposes; despite its emblems of savagery, ''Station Island'' lends no rhetorical comfort to Republicanism. Politic about politics, ''Station Island'' is less about a united Ireland than about a poet seeking religious and aesthetic unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://new.bostonreview.net/BR10.1/heaney.html|title=Station Island, Seamus Heaney|date=1 February 1985|access-date=2 October 2010|first=Shaun|last=O'Connell|work=Boston Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heaney is described by critic [[Terry Eagleton]] as &quot;an enlightened cosmopolitan liberal&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v21/n22/terry-eagleton/hasped-and-hooped-and-hirpling |title=Terry Eagleton reviews 'Beowulf' translated by Seamus Heaney · ''LRB'' 11 November 1999 |publisher=Lrb.co.uk |access-date=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; refusing to be drawn. Eagleton suggests: &quot;When the political is introduced... it is only in the context of what Heaney will or will not say.&quot;&lt;ref name=the_guardian_robert_potts_2001&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/apr/07/poetry.tseliotprizeforpoetry2001|title=The view from Olympia|first=Robert|last=Potts|newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 April 2001|access-date=7 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflections on what Heaney identifies as &quot;tribal conflict&quot;&lt;ref name=the_guardian_robert_potts_2001/&gt; favour the description of people's lives and their voices, drawing out the &quot;psychic landscape&quot;. His collections often recall the assassinations of his family members and close friends, lynchings and bombings. [[Colm Tóibín]] wrote, &quot;throughout his career there have been poems of simple evocation and description. His refusal to sum up or offer meaning is part of his tact.&quot;&lt;ref name=toibin_human_chain/&gt;

Heaney published &quot;Requiem for the [[Croppy|Croppies]]&quot;, a poem that commemorates the Irish rebels of 1798, on the 50th anniversary of the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]. He read the poem to both Catholic and Protestant audiences in Ireland. He commented, &quot;To read 'Requiem for the Croppies' wasn't to say ‘up the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]]’ or anything. It was silence-breaking rather than rabble-rousing.&quot;&lt;ref name=sameer_rahim_70th_birthday_interview&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/5132022/Interview-with-Seamus-Heaney.html|title=Interview with Seamus Heaney: On the eve of his 70th birthday, Seamus Heaney tells Sameer Rahim about his lifetime in poetry – and who he thinks would make a good poet laureate|first=Sameer|last=Rahim|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=11 May 2009|access-date=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated, &quot;You don't have to love it. You just have to permit it.&quot;&lt;ref name=sameer_rahim_70th_birthday_interview/&gt;

He turned down the offer of [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|laureateship of the United Kingdom]], partly for political reasons, commenting, &quot;I’ve nothing against the Queen personally: I had lunch at [[Buckingham Palace|the Palace]] once upon a time.&quot;&lt;ref name=sameer_rahim_70th_birthday_interview/&gt; He stated that his &quot;cultural starting point&quot; was &quot;off-centre&quot;.&lt;ref name=sameer_rahim_70th_birthday_interview/&gt; A much-quoted statement was when he objected to being included in ''[[The Penguin Book of Contemporary British Poetry]]'' (1982). Although he was born in Northern Ireland, his response to being included in the British anthology was delivered in his poem &quot;An Open Letter&quot;:

===Translation===
He was concerned, as a poet and a translator, with the English language as it is spoken in Ireland but also as spoken elsewhere and in other times; he explored [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] influences in his work and study. Critic [[W. S. Di Piero]] noted &lt;blockquote&gt;Whatever the occasion, childhood, farm life, politics and culture in Northern Ireland, other poets past and present, Heaney strikes time and again at the taproot of language, examining its genetic structures, trying to discover how it has served, in all its changes, as a culture bearer, a world to contain imaginations, at once a rhetorical weapon and nutriment of spirit. He writes of these matters with rare discrimination and resourcefulness, and a winning impatience with received wisdom.&lt;ref name=poetry_foundation/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Heaney's first translation was of the Irish lyric poem ''[[Buile Shuibhne|Buile Suibhne]]'', published as ''Sweeney Astray: A Version from the Irish'' (1984). He took up this character and connection in poems published in ''Station Island'' (1984). Heaney's prize-winning translation of ''[[Beowulf: A New Verse Translation|Beowulf]]'' (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 2000, Whitbread Book of the Year Award) was considered groundbreaking in its use of modern language melded with the original Anglo-Saxon &quot;music&quot;.&lt;ref name=poetry_foundation/&gt;

===Plays and prose===
His plays include ''The Cure at Troy: A Version of Sophocles' Philoctetes'' (1991). Heaney's 2004 play, ''[[The Burial at Thebes]],'' suggests parallels between [[Creon]] and the foreign policies of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/21/arts/21weekahead.html|title=The Week Ahead: Jan. 21 – 27|first=Steven|last=McElroy|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=21 January 2007|access-date=21 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heaney's engagement with poetry as a necessary engine for cultural and personal change is reflected in his prose works ''The Redress of Poetry'' (1995) and ''Finders Keepers: Selected Prose, 1971–2001'' (2002).&lt;ref name=poetry_foundation/&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;When a poem rhymes,&quot; Heaney wrote, &quot;when a form generates itself, when a metre provokes consciousness into new postures, it is already on the side of life. When a rhyme surprises and extends the fixed relations between words, that in itself protests against necessity. When language does more than enough, as it does in all achieved poetry, it opts for the condition of overlife, and rebels at limit.&quot;&lt;ref name=toibin_human_chain/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;He continues: &quot;The vision of reality which poetry offers should be transformative, more than just a printout of the given circumstances of its time and place&quot;.&lt;ref name=toibin_human_chain/&gt; Often overlooked and underestimated in the direction of his work is his profound poetic debts to and critical engagement with 20th-century Eastern European poets, and in particular Nobel laureate [[Czesław Miłosz]].&lt;ref&gt;Kay, Magdalena.

Furthermore, HRW is concerned by OIC's apparent unwillingness to recognise as terrorism acts that serve causes endorsed by their member states. Article 2 reads: &quot;Peoples' struggle including armed struggle against foreign occupation, aggression, colonialism, and hegemony, aimed at liberation and self-determination.&quot; HRW has suggested to OIC that they embrace &quot;longstanding and universally recognised international human rights standards&quot;,&lt;ref name=terrorism/&gt; a request that has as yet not led to any results.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Contradictions between OIC's and other UN members' understanding of terrorism has stymied efforts at the UN to produce a comprehensive convention on international terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Goodenough: [http://www.cnsnews.com/Public/Content/Article.aspx?rsrcid=34958 UN Anti-Terror Effort Bogged Down Over Terrorism Definition] CNSNew, 2 September 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207195652/http://www.cnsnews.com/Public/Content/Article.aspx?rsrcid=34958 |date=7 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a meeting in Malaysia in April 2002, delegates discussed terrorism but failed to reach a definition of it. They rejected, however, any description of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict|Palestinian fight with Israel]] as terrorism. Their declaration was explicit: &quot;We reject any attempt to link terrorism to the struggle of the Palestinian people in the exercise of their inalienable right to establish their independent state with Al-Quds Al-Shrif ([[Jerusalem]]) as its capital.&quot; In fact, at the outset of the meeting, the OIC countries signed a statement praising the Palestinians and their &quot;blessed [[Wikt:intifada|intifada]].&quot; The word terrorism was restricted to describe Israel, whom they condemned for &quot;[[state terrorism]]&quot; in their war with the Palestinian people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ed20020409a1.html The OIC's blind eye to terror] ''The Japan Times'' 9 April 2002. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 34th Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers (ICFM), an OIC section, in May 2007, the foreign ministers termed [[Islamophobia]] &quot;the worst form of terrorism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabnews.com/?page=4&amp;section=0&amp;article=96276&amp;d=17&amp;m=5&amp;y=2007 ‘Islamophobia Worst Form of Terrorism’] ''Arab News'' 17 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dispute with Thailand===
[[Thailand]] has responded to OIC criticism of human rights abuses in the [[Islam in Thailand|Muslim majority]] provinces of [[Pattani]], [[Yala Province|Yala]], and [[Narathiwat Province|Narathiwat]] in the south of the country. In a statement issued on 18 October 2005, secretary-general Ihsanoglu vocalised concern over the continuing conflict in the south that &quot;claimed the lives of innocent people and forced the migration of local people out of their places&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;patanipost.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patanipost.com/090418OIC.html |title=Ihsanoglu urges OIC Member States to accord greater attention to Muslim minority issues |publisher=Patanipost.com |accessdate=25 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715051741/http://www.patanipost.com/090418OIC.html |archivedate=15 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stressed that the Thai government's security approach to the crisis would aggravate the situation and lead to continued violence.

On 18–19 April 2009, the exiled Patani leader [[Abu Yasir Fikri]] (see [[Patani United Liberation Organisation]]) was invited to the OIC to speak about the conflict and present a solution to end the violence between the Thai government and the ethnically Malay Muslims living in the socioeconomically neglected south, that has been struggling against Thai assimilation policy and for self governance since it became annexed by Thailand in 1902. Fikri presented a six-point solution at the conference in Jiddah that included obtaining the same basic rights as other groups when it came to right of language, religion, and culture. He also suggested that Thailand give up its discriminatory policies against the Patani people and allow Patani to at least be allowed the same self-governing rights as other regions in Thailand already have, citing that this does not go against the Thai constitution since it has been done in other parts of Thailand and that it is a matter of political will.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patanipost.com/OIC090419.html |title=Welcome to Patani Post! PULO President invited to speak at OIC meeting 18–19 April 2009 |work=Patani Post|accessdate=25 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316105054/http://www.patanipost.com/OIC090419.html |archivedate=16 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also criticised the Thai government's escalation of violence by arming and creating Buddhist [[militia]] groups and questioned their intentions. He added Thai policies of not investigating corruption, murder, and human rights violations perpetrated by Bangkok-led administration and military personnel against the Malay Muslim population was an obstacle for achieving peace and healing the deep wounds of being treated as third-class citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;amnesty.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/region/thailand|title=Thailand |publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=25 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thailand responded to this criticism over its policies. The [[Thailand|Thai]] [[foreign minister]], [[Kantathi Suphamongkhon]], said: &quot;We have made it clear to the OIC several times that the violence in the deep South is not caused by religious conflict and the government grants protection to all of our citizens no matter what religion they embrace.&quot; The Foreign Ministry issued a statement dismissing the OIC's criticism and accusing it of disseminating misperceptions and misinformation about the situation in the southern provinces. &quot;If the OIC secretariat really wants to promote the cause of peace and harmony in the three southern provinces of Thailand, the responsibility falls on the OIC secretariat to strongly condemn the militants, who are perpetrating these acts of violence against both Thai Muslims and Thai Buddhists.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;patanipost.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/English/News/2005-10/20/article08.shtml] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823154242/http://www.islamonline.net/English/News/2005-10/20/article08.shtml|date=23 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patanipost.com/OicResolution.html |title=OIC Resolution |work=Patani Post|accessdate=25 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715051807/http://www.patanipost.com/OicResolution.html |archivedate=15 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; HRW&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/asia/thailand |title=Thailand |publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=25 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Amnesty International&lt;ref name=&quot;amnesty.org&quot;/&gt; have echoed the same concerns as OIC, rebuffing Thailand's attempts to dismiss the issue.

== Notable meetings ==

A number of OIC meetings have attracted global attention.

===Ninth meeting of PUOICM===
The ninth meeting of Parliamentary Union of the OIC member states (PUOICM) was held on 15 and 16 February 2007 in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/Display_news.asp?section=Local_News&amp;subsection=Qatar+News&amp;month=February2007&amp;file=Local_News2007021523026.xml] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016074912/http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/Display_news.asp?section=Local_News&amp;subsection=Qatar+News&amp;month=February2007&amp;file=Local_News2007021523026.xml|date=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speaker of Malaysia's [[Dewan Rakyat|House of Representatives]], [[Ramli bin Ngah Talib]], delivered a speech at the beginning of the inaugural ceremony. OIC secretary-general [[Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu]] said prior to the meeting that one main agenda item was stopping Israel from continuing its excavation at the [[Western Wall#Recent damage to plaza|Western Wall]] near the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]], Islam's third holiest site.&lt;ref name=mnna&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news.php?id=247167 |title=Malaysian National News Agency |agency=Bernama |accessdate=25 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090226/http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news.php?id=247167 |archivedate=29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The OIC also discussed how it might send peacekeeping troops to Muslim states, as well as the possibility of a change in the name of the body and its charter.&lt;ref name=mnna/&gt; Additionally, return of the sovereignty right to the Iraqi people along with withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq was another one of the main issues on the agenda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianmuslims.info/comment/reply/17638] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906005234/http://www.indianmuslims.info/comment/reply/17638|date=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistani Foreign Minister [[Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri]] told reporters on 14 February 2007 that the secretary general of OIC and foreign ministers of seven &quot;like-minded Muslim countries&quot; would meet in [[Islamabad]] on 25 February 2007 following meetings of [[Pervez Musharraf|President Musharraf]] with heads of key Muslim countries to discuss &quot;a new initiative&quot; for the resolution of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]. Kasuri said this would be a meeting of foreign ministers of key Muslim countries to discuss and prepare for a summit in [[Mecca|Makkah Al Mukarramah]] to seek the resolution of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pakistanlink.com/Headlines/Feb07/15/05.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007071428/http://www.pakistanlink.com/Headlines/Feb07/15/05.htm|date=7 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IPHRC Trip to Washington DC===
In December 2012, the IPHRC met in Washington, DC for the first time. The IPHRC held meetings at the National Press Club, Capitol Hill and Freedom House discussing the issues of human rights defense in the OIC member states. During their roundtable discussion with Freedom House the IPHRC emphasised the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the rejection of the Cairo Declaration by the OIC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/event/upcoming-event-roundtable-discussion-oics-human-rights-commission|title=Upcoming Event: Roundtable Discussion with the OIC's Human Rights Commission |publisher=Freedom House|date=13 December 2012|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observer Status dispute===
The September 2014's high-level Summit of the OIC, in New York, ended without adopting any resolutions or conclusions, for the first time in several years in the modern history of the organization, due to a dispute regarding the status of one of its Observer states. [[Egypt]], [[Iran]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]] have demanded that the OIC remove the term 'Turkish Cypriot State' in reference to the unrecognized [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus|Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC)]], which has observer status within the organization. Egypt's president [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] insisted that any reference to the &quot;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus or Turkish Cypriot State&quot; was unacceptable and was ultimately the reason for the OIC not adopting any resolutions or conclusions in the 2014 summit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldbulletin.net/headlines/145743/egypts-sisi-demands-turkish-cypriots-removed-from-oic] The World Bulletin news: Egypt's Sisi demands Turkish Cypriots removed from OIC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sheikyermami.com/egypt-sisi-tells-turks-to-get-out-of-cyprus/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012082714/http://sheikyermami.com/egypt-sisi-tells-turks-to-get-out-of-cyprus/ |date=12 October 2014 }} Egypt's Sisi tells Turks to get out of Cyprus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141012144555/http://www.newsit.com.cy/default.php?pname=Article&amp;art_id=152107&amp;catid=7] OIC says «NO» to «Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus»&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

OIC has been criticised by many Muslims for its lack of real engagement and solutions for Muslim countries in crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/general/2009/10/200910261043188533.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801041646/https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/general/2009/10/200910261043188533.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 August 2018|title=OIC: 40 Years of Frustrations {{!}} {{!}} Al Jazeera|date=1 August 2018|access-date=17 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said to have made progress in social and academic terms but not politically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/general/2009/10/200910261043188533.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801041646/https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/general/2009/10/200910261043188533.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 August 2018|title=OIC: 40 Years of Frustrations {{!}} {{!}} Al Jazeera|date=1 August 2018|access-date=17 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2020, Pakistan's Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Shah Mahmood Qureshi|SM Qureshi]] criticized OIC for its stand with regards to [[Kashmir dispute|Kashmir issue]], stating with Pakistan might consider to call a meeting of Islamic countries that are ready to stand with them on the issue. This comment invited immediate retaliation from Saudi Arabia, where the latter forced Pakistan to repay 1 Billion dollars from the 3 Billion dollars loan it had taken in 2018 and by also ending its oil supply credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Harsha Kakar |title=Pakistan isolated on Kashmir |url=https://www.thestatesman.com/opinion/pakistan-isolated-kashmir-1502915906.html |accessdate=12 August 2020 |work=The Statesman |date=11 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baltimore County''' is the third-most populous [[County (United States)|county]] located in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Maryland]] and is part of the [[Baltimore metropolitan area]] and [[Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area]] (a combined statistical area). Baltimore County is part of the [[Northeast megalopolis]], which stretches from Virginia northward to [[Boston]]. Baltimore County hosts a diversified economy, with particular emphasis on education, government, and health care.

The county is home to multiple universities, including [[Goucher College]], [[Stevenson University]] (formerly Villa Julie College), [[Towson University]], and [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County]].{{toclimit|3}}

==History==
The name &quot;Baltimore&quot; derives from [[Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore]] (1605–1675), the proprietor of the new colony in the [[Province of Maryland]], and the town of Baltimore in [[County Cork]], [[Ireland]]. The earliest known documentary record of the county is dated January 12, 1659, when a [[writ]] was issued on behalf of the [[Maryland General Assembly|General Assembly of Maryland]] to its sheriff.&lt;ref&gt;Located in the [[Maryland State Archives]] in the Hall of Records of the state capital of [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]],&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; The official founding of the county came in 1659, among the now 23 counties of the State of Maryland. This assumes that a certain amount of organization and appointments in the mid-17th century had already occurred. Previously, (old) Baltimore County was known more as a geographical entity than a political one, with its territorial limits including most of northeastern Maryland, which was then the northwestern frontier of the [[Province of Maryland|Province]] and included the present-day jurisdictions of [[Baltimore City]], [[Cecil County, Maryland|Cecil]] and [[Harford County, Maryland|Harford Counties]], as well as parts of [[Carroll County, Maryland|Carroll]], [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland|Anne Arundel]], [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick]], [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard]] and [[Kent County, Maryland|Kent Counties]].

In 1674, a proclamation of the Proprietor established the then-extensive boundary lines for old Baltimore County. Over the next century, various segments of the old county were sliced off as population and settlements increased in fringe regions. A portion of northeastern Baltimore County, as well as a portion of northwestern [[Kent County, Maryland|Kent County]], was split off to create [[Cecil County, Maryland|Cecil County]]. In 1748, a portion of western Baltimore County, as well as a portion of [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]] to the south, were split off to create [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick County]]. In 1773, Harford County to the east was split off, and in 1837 another part of western Baltimore County was combined with a part of eastern [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick County]] to create [[Carroll County, Maryland|Carroll County]]. After the adjustment of Baltimore County's southern boundary with [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland|Anne Arundel County]], stated to be the upper Middle and Western Branches of the [[Patapsco River]] in 1727, a portion of the County's northwestern area was designated in 1838 as the &quot;Western District&quot; or &quot;Howard District&quot; of Arundel and in 1851 was officially separated to form [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard County]].

Before 1674, Baltimore County court sessions were held in private residences, according to sketchy documentary evidence. In 1674, the [[Maryland General Assembly|General Assembly]] passed &quot;An Act for erecting a Court-house and Prison in each County within this Province&quot;. The site of the courthouse, jail and county seat for Baltimore County was evidently &quot;Old Baltimore&quot; near the [[Bush River (Maryland)|Bush River]] on land that in 1773 became part of Harford County.

The exact location of Old Baltimore was lost. It was certain that the location was somewhere on the site of the present-day [[Aberdeen Proving Grounds]] (APG), a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] weapons testing facility. APG's Cultural Resource Management Program attempted to find Old Baltimore, contracting with R. Christopher Goodwin &amp; Associates (Goodwin). Goodwin first performed historical and archival work and coordinated with existing landscape features to locate the site of Old Baltimore. APG's Explosive Ordnance Disposal of Army personnel defused any unexploded ordnance. In 1997–1998. Goodwin dug 420 test pits, uncovering artifacts including a [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] farthing coin, and French and English gun flints. An unearthed brick foundation proved to be the remains of the tavern owned by colonist James Phillips. Another prominent landholder in Old Baltimore was William Osbourne, who operated the ferry across the Bush River.

In his article &quot;Migrations of Baltimore Town&quot;, Reverend George Armistead Leakin related a letter he had received from Dr. George I. Hays. In that letter, Dr. Hays related an account of a raid by the [[Susquehannocks]] who took William Osbourne's oldest son. Osbourne was unsuccessful in an attempt to rescue the boy. The boy was never seen by Osbourne again.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

In 1683, the [[Maryland General Assembly]] passed &quot;An Act for Advancement of Trade&quot; to &quot;establish towns, ports, and places of trade, within the province.&quot; One of the towns established by the act was &quot;on Bush River, on Town Land, near the Court-House&quot;.  The courthouse on the Bush River referenced in the 1683 Act was in all likelihood the one created by the 1674 Act. &quot;Old Baltimore&quot; was in existence as early as 1674, but no documents describe what may have preceded it.

By 1695, the &quot;Old Baltimore&quot; courthouse had evidently been abandoned. County justices put the site up for sale. Apparently a new courthouse at &quot;Simm's Choice&quot; on the Baltimore County side of [[Gunpowder River|Little Gunpowder Falls]] had been under construction since 1692. In 1700, builder Michael Judd sold it to the county justices. This change of location, away from the Bush River area, reflects the growing economic and political importance of the Gunpowder region. During the next decade, the county seat moved to [[Joppa, Maryland|Joppa]].

By 1724, the legislative assembly authorized Thomas Tolley, Capt. John Taylor, Daniel Scott, Lancelot Todd, and John Stokes to purchase 20 acres from &quot;Taylor's Choice,&quot; a tract named after John Taylor. The assembly's ordinance directed that the land be divided into 40 lots with streets and alleys to accompany the courthouse and jail erected previously. By 1750, about 50 houses (including a few large two-story brick structures), a church (St. John's Anglican Parish), a courthouse, three stone warehouses, inns, taverns, stores, a public wharf and a &quot;gallows-tree&quot; with an &quot;Amen Corner&quot; with pillories and whipping posts (now located northeast of the City of Baltimore near present-day suburban &quot;Joppatowne&quot; off [[Harford Road]]) existed.

A new port and wharfing site, [[Elkridge Landing]], on the upper [[Patapsco River]]'s Western Branch, became prosperous in the 18th century. It was established on the &quot;falls&quot; of the river, below the rapids and rocks, where the river was deep enough for loaded sailing merchantmen. The landing was a designated &quot;port of entry&quot; and was the terminus of several &quot;rolling roads&quot; on which horse or oxen-drawn [[hogshead]]s (huge barrels) packed with tobacco were wheeled down to the Landing/port to be loaded on ships sailing for London and Europe. Gradually the site silted-up from soil erosion and poor farming cultivation on the upper Patapsco, and the maritime economy of the Landing faded. In the 19th century, it became an important stop on the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] and the main north-south East Coast highway for wagons and carriages. Still, later it was on Washington Boulevard (designated [[United States Route 1|U.S. Route 1]]) by 1926.

With a bit of financial pressure, and after paying for the cost of a new courthouse (300 pounds sterling), dominant business, commercial and political residents of the Town of Baltimore were able to have the [[Maryland General Assembly]] relocate the county seat to their growing port town. In 1768, following receipt of petitions for and against the relocation, the General Assembly passed an Act that moved the county seat from Joppa to Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://aomol.msa.maryland.gov/000001/000061/html/am61p--86.html|title=Baltimore Town Made the County Seat|journal=Maryland State Archives (Archives of Maryland Online)|volume=61|pages=86–87|publisher=Maryland State Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first courthouse was constructed in 1768 at a new &quot;Courthouse Square&quot; (today on [[St. Paul Street-Calvert Street|North Calvert Street]], between East Lexington and East Fayette Streets).

The Town of Baltimore, [[Jonestown, Baltimore|Jonestown]] and [[Fell's Point, Baltimore|Fells Point]] were [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] as the ''[[Baltimore|City of Baltimore]]'' in 1796–1797. The city remained a part of surrounding Baltimore County and continued to serve as its [[county seat]] from 1768–1851.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maryland Manual&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/mdmanual/36loc/bcity/html/bcity.html| title=Baltimore, Maryland—Government| work=Maryland Manual On-Line: A Guide to Maryland Government| publisher=Maryland State Archives| date=October 23, 2008| access-date=October 27, 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919221820/http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/mdmanual/36loc/bcity/html/bcity.html| archive-date=September 19, 2008| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site of the courthouse is now &quot;[[Battle Monument|Battle Monument Square]]&quot;, constructed 1815–1822 to commemorate the city and county defense in the [[War of 1812]], including the bombardment of [[Fort McHenry]] by the British [[Royal Navy]] fleet in the [[Patapsco River]], the two-day stand-off in fortifications dug east of the city on Loudenschlager's Hill (now &quot;Hampstead Hill&quot; in today's [[Patterson Park]]) and the earlier [[Battle of North Point]] in &quot;Godly Woods&quot; on the &quot;Patapsco Neck&quot; peninsula in the southeastern portion of the county, during September 12–14, 1814. These events have been commemorated ever since by [[Defenders Day|Defenders' Day]], an annual city, county, and state official holiday on September 12.

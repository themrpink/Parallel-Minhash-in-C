==Costs and trends==
As an industrial process, the cost of welding plays a crucial role in manufacturing decisions. Many different variables affect the total cost, including equipment cost, labor cost, material cost, and [[electric power|energy]] cost.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weman18489&quot;&gt;Weman, pp. 184–89&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the process, equipment cost can vary, from inexpensive for methods like [[shielded metal arc welding]] and [[oxyfuel welding]], to extremely expensive for methods like laser beam welding and electron beam welding. Because of their high cost, they are only used in high production operations. Similarly, because automation and robots increase equipment costs, they are only implemented when high production is necessary. Labor cost depends on the deposition rate (the rate of welding), the hourly wage, and the total operation time, including time spent fitting, welding, and handling the part. The cost of materials includes the cost of the base and filler material, and the cost of shielding gases. Finally, energy cost depends on arc time and welding power demand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weman18489&quot; /&gt;

For manual welding methods, labor costs generally make up the vast majority of the total cost. As a result, many cost-saving measures are focused on minimizing operation time. To do this, welding procedures with high deposition rates can be selected, and weld parameters can be fine-tuned to increase welding speed. Mechanization and automation are often implemented to reduce labor costs, but this frequently increases the cost of equipment and creates additional setup time. Material costs tend to increase when special properties are necessary, and energy costs normally do not amount to more than several percent of the total welding cost.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weman18489&quot; /&gt;

In recent years, in order to minimize labor costs in high production manufacturing, industrial welding has become increasingly more automated, most notably with the use of robots in resistance spot welding (especially in the automotive industry) and in arc welding. In robot welding, mechanized devices both hold the material and perform the weld&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln Electric, p. 4.5-1&lt;/ref&gt; and at first, spot welding was its most common application, but robotic arc welding increases in popularity as technology advances. Other key areas of research and development include the welding of dissimilar materials (such as steel and aluminum, for example) and new welding processes, such as friction stir, magnetic pulse, conductive heat seam, and laser-hybrid welding. Furthermore, progress is desired in making more specialized methods like laser beam welding practical for more applications, such as in the aerospace and automotive industries. Researchers also hope to better understand the often unpredictable properties of welds, especially microstructure, [[residual stress]]es, and a weld's tendency to crack or deform.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASM International&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

The trend of accelerating the speed at which welds are performed in the [[steel erector|steel erection]] industry comes at a risk to the integrity of the connection. Without proper fusion to the base materials provided by sufficient arc time on the weld, a project inspector cannot ensure the effective diameter of the puddle weld therefore he or she cannot guarantee the published load capacities unless they witness the actual installation.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This method of puddle welding is common in the United States and Canada for attaching steel sheets to [[bar joist]] and [[structural steel]] members. Regional agencies are responsible for ensuring the proper installation of puddle welding on steel construction sites. Currently there is no standard or weld procedure which can ensure the published holding capacity of any unwitnessed connection, but this is under review by the [[American Welding Society]].

==Glass and plastic welding==

[[File:Glass welding two tubes together.JPG|thumb|The welding together of two tubes made from lead glass]]

Glasses and certain types of plastics are commonly welded materials. Unlike metals, which have a specific [[melting point]], glasses and plastics have a melting range, called the [[glass transition]]. When heating the solid material past the glass-transition temperature (T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;) into this range, it will generally become softer and more pliable. When it crosses through the range, above the glass-melting temperature (T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;), it will become a very thick, sluggish, viscous liquid, slowly decreasing in viscosity as temperature increases. Typically, this [[viscous liquid]] will have very little [[surface tension]] compared to metals, becoming a sticky, [[taffy (candy)|taffy]] to [[honey]]-like consistency, so welding can usually take place by simply pressing two melted surfaces together. The two liquids will generally mix and join at first contact. Upon cooling through the glass transition, the welded piece will solidify as one solid piece of [[amorphous solid|amorphous material]].

===Glass welding===
{{main|Glassblowing}}

Glass welding is a common practice during glassblowing. It is used very often in the construction of lighting, [[neon sign]]s, [[flashtube]]s, scientific equipment, and the manufacture of dishes and other glassware. It is also used during [[glass casting]] for joining the halves of glass molds, making items such as bottles and jars. Welding glass is accomplished by heating the glass through the glass transition, turning it into a thick, formable, liquid mass. Heating is usually done with a gas or oxy-gas torch, or a furnace, because the temperatures for melting glass are often quite high. This temperature may vary, depending on the type of glass. For example, [[lead glass]] becomes a weldable liquid at around {{convert|1600|F|C}}, and can be welded with a simple propane torch. On the other hand, quartz glass ([[fused silica]]) must be heated to over {{convert|3000|F|C}}, but quickly loses its viscosity and formability if overheated, so an [[oxyhydrogen]] torch must be used. Sometimes a tube may be attached to the glass, allowing it to be blown into various shapes, such as bulbs, bottles, or tubes. When two pieces of liquid glass are pressed together, they will usually weld very readily. Welding a handle onto a pitcher can usually be done with relative ease. However, when welding a tube to another tube, a combination of blowing and suction, and pressing and pulling is used to ensure a good seal, to shape the glass, and to keep the surface tension from closing the tube in on itself. Sometimes a filler rod may be used, but usually not.

Because glass is very brittle in its solid state, it is often prone to cracking upon heating and cooling, especially if the heating and cooling are uneven. This is because the brittleness of glass does not allow for uneven [[thermal expansion]]. Glass that has been welded will usually need to be cooled very slowly and evenly through the glass transition, in a process called [[annealing (glass)|annealing]], to relieve any internal stresses created by a [[temperature gradient]].

There are many types of glass, and it is most common to weld using the same types. Different glasses often have different rates of thermal expansion, which can cause them to crack upon cooling when they contract differently. For instance, quartz has very low thermal expansion, while [[soda-lime glass]] has very high thermal expansion. When welding different glasses to each other, it is usually important to closely match their coefficients of thermal expansion, to ensure that cracking does not occur. Also, some glasses will simply not mix with others, so welding between certain types may not be possible.

Glass can also be welded to metals and ceramics, although with metals the process is usually more adhesion to the surface of the metal rather than a commingling of the two materials. However, certain glasses will typically bond only to certain metals. For example, lead glass bonds readily to [[copper]] or [[molybdenum]], but not to aluminum. [[Tungsten]] electrodes are often used in lighting but will not bond to quartz glass, so the tungsten is often wetted with molten [[borosilicate glass]], which bonds to both tungsten and quartz. However, care must be taken to ensure that all materials have similar coefficients of thermal expansion to prevent cracking both when the object cools and when it is heated again. Special [[alloy]]s are often used for this purpose, ensuring that the coefficients of expansion match, and sometimes thin, metallic coatings may be applied to a metal to create a good bond with the glass.&lt;ref&gt;Freek Bos, Christian Louter, Fred Veer (2008) ''Challenging Glass: Conference on Architectural and Structural Applications''. JOS Press. p. 194. {{ISBN|1586038664}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernard D. Bolas (1921) [https://archive.org/details/handbookoflabora02bolarich ''A handbook of laboratory glassblowing'']. London, G. Routledge and sons&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plastic welding===
{{main|Plastic welding}}

Plastics are generally divided into two categories, which are &quot;thermosets&quot; and &quot;thermoplastics.&quot; A [[thermoset]] is a plastic in which a chemical reaction sets the molecular bonds after first forming the plastic, and then the bonds cannot be broken again without degrading the plastic. Thermosets cannot be melted, therefore, once a thermoset has set it is impossible to weld it. Examples of thermosets include [[epoxy|epoxies]], [[silicone]], [[vulcanized rubber]], [[polyester]], and [[polyurethane]].

[[Thermoplastic]]s, by contrast, form long molecular chains, which are often coiled or intertwined, forming an amorphous structure without any long-range, crystalline order. Some thermoplastics may be fully amorphous, while others have a partially crystalline/partially amorphous structure. Both amorphous and semicrystalline thermoplastics have a glass transition, above which welding can occur, but semicrystallines also have a specific melting point which is above the glass transition. Above this melting point, the viscous liquid will become a free-flowing liquid (see [[rheological weldability]] for [[thermoplastics]]). Examples of thermoplastics include [[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]], [[polystyrene]], [[polyvinylchloride]] (PVC), and fluoroplastics like [[Teflon]] and [[Spectralon]].

Welding thermoplastic is very similar to welding glass. The plastic first must be cleaned and then heated through the glass transition, turning the weld-interface into a thick, viscous liquid. Two heated interfaces can then be pressed together, allowing the molecules to mix through intermolecular diffusion, joining them as one. Then the plastic is cooled through the glass transition, allowing the weld to solidify. A filler rod may often be used for certain types of joints. The main differences between welding glass and plastic are the types of heating methods, the much lower melting temperatures, and the fact that plastics will burn if overheated. Many different methods have been devised for heating plastic to a weldable temperature without burning it. Ovens or electric heating tools can be used to melt the plastic. Ultrasonic, laser, or friction heating are other methods. Resistive metals may be implanted in the plastic, which respond to induction heating. Some plastics will begin to burn at temperatures lower than their glass transition, so welding can be performed by blowing a heated, inert gas onto the plastic, melting it while, at the same time, shielding it from oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;''Plastics and Composites: Welding Handbook'' By David A. Grewell, A. Benatar, Joon Bu Park – Hanser Gardener 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Many thermoplastics can also be welded using chemical [[solvent]]s. When placed in contact with the plastic, the solvent will begin to soften it, bringing the surface into a thick, liquid solution. When two melted surfaces are pressed together, the molecules in the solution mix, joining them as one. Because the solvent can permeate the plastic, the solvent evaporates out through the surface of the plastic, causing the weld to drop out of solution and solidify. A common use for solvent welding is for joining PVC or ABS ([[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]]) pipes during [[plumbing]], or for welding [[styrene]] and polystyrene plastics in the construction of [[physical model|models]]. Solvent welding is especially effective on plastics like PVC which burn at or below their glass transition, but may be ineffective on plastics like Teflon or polyethylene that are resistant to [[chemical decomposition]].&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Plastics Joining: A Practical Guide'' By Plastics Design Library – PDL 1997 Page 137, 146&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?''''' is a play by [[Edward Albee]] first staged in October 1962. It examines the complexities of the marriage of a middle-aged couple, Martha and George.  Late one evening, after a university faculty party, they receive an unwitting younger couple, Nick and Honey, as guests, and draw them into their bitter and frustrated relationship.

The play is in three acts, normally taking a little less than three hours to perform, with two 10-minute [[intermission]]s. The title is a [[pun]] on the song &quot;[[Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?]]&quot; from [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Three Little Pigs (film)|Three Little Pigs]]'' (1933), substituting the name of the celebrated English author [[Virginia Woolf]]. Martha and George repeatedly sing this version of the song throughout the play.

''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' won both the 1963 [[Tony Award for Best Play]] and the 1962–63 [[New York Drama Critics' Circle]] Award for Best Play. It is frequently revived on the modern stage. The [[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (film)|film adaptation]] was released in 1966, written by [[Ernest Lehman]], directed by [[Mike Nichols]], and starring [[Richard Burton]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[George Segal]] and [[Sandy Dennis]].

==Plot summary==

===Act One: &quot;Fun and Games&quot;===
George and Martha engage in dangerous emotional games. George is an associate professor of history and Martha is the daughter of the president of the college where George teaches. After they return home from a faculty party, Martha reveals she has invited a young married couple she met at the party over for a drink. The guests arrive—Nick, a biology professor (who Martha thinks teaches math), and his wife, Honey. As the four drink, Martha and George engage in scathing verbal abuse of each other in front of Nick and Honey. The younger couple is first embarrassed and later enmeshed. They stay.

Martha taunts George aggressively, and he retaliates with his usual [[passive aggression]]. Martha tells an embarrassing story about how she humiliated him with a [[sucker punch]] in front of her father. During the telling, George appears with a gun and fires at Martha, but an umbrella pops out. After this scare, Martha's taunts continue, and George reacts violently by breaking a bottle. Nick and Honey become increasingly unsettled and, at the end of the act, Honey runs to the bathroom to vomit, having had too much to drink.

===Act Two: &quot;Walpurgisnacht&quot;===
Traditionally, &quot;[[Walpurgisnacht]]&quot; is the name of an annual witches' meeting (satiric in the context of the play). Nick and George are sitting outside. As they talk about their wives, Nick says Honey had a &quot;[[false pregnancy|hysterical pregnancy]]&quot;. George tells Nick about a time he went to a [[Dive bar|gin mill]] with some [[boarding school]] classmates, one of whom had accidentally killed his mother by shooting her. This friend was laughed at for ordering &quot;bergin&quot;. The following summer, the friend accidentally killed his father while driving, was committed to an [[psychiatric hospital|asylum]], and never spoke again. George and Nick discuss the possibility of having children and eventually argue and insult each other. After they rejoin the women in the house, Martha and Nick dance suggestively. Martha also reveals the truth about George's creative writing escapades: he had tried to publish a novel about a boy who accidentally killed both of his parents (with the implication that the deaths were actually murder), but Martha's father would not let it be published. George responds by attacking Martha, but Nick separates them.

George suggests a new game called &quot;Get the Guests&quot;. George insults and mocks Honey with an extemporaneous tale of &quot;the Mousie&quot; who &quot;tooted brandy immodestly and spent half her time in the upchuck&quot;. Honey realizes that the story is about her and her &quot;hysterical pregnancy&quot;. The implication is that she trapped Nick into marrying her because of a false pregnancy. She feels sick and runs to the bathroom again.

At the end of this scene, Martha starts to act seductively toward Nick in George's presence. George pretends to react calmly, reading a book. As Martha and Nick walk upstairs, George throws his book against the door. In all productions until 2005, Honey returns, wondering who rang the doorbell (Martha and Nick had knocked into some bells). George comes up with a plan to tell Martha that their son has died, and the act ends with George eagerly preparing to tell her. In what is labeled the &quot;Definitive Edition&quot; of the script, however, the second act ends before Honey arrives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaterjones.com/reviews/20110930061816/2011-10-02/University-of-North-Texas-Department-of-Dance-and-Theatre/Whos-Afraid-of-Virginia-Woolf &quot;Drink, Drink and Be Merry&quot;] Theater Jones, accessed October 15, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act Three: &quot;The Exorcism&quot;===

Exorcism is the expulsion or attempted expulsion of a supposed evil spirit from a person or place. In this act, it seems that Martha and George intend to remove the great desire they have always had for a child by continuing their story of their imagined son and his death.

Martha appears alone in the living room, shouting at the others to come out from hiding. Nick joins her. The doorbell rings: it is George, with a bunch of [[Antirrhinum|snapdragons]] in his hand, calling out, &quot;Flores para los muertos&quot; (''flowers for the dead''), a reference to the [[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|play]] and [[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|movie]] ''A Streetcar Named Desire'', also about a marriage and outside influences. Martha and George argue about whether the moon is up: George insists it is, while Martha says she saw no moon from the bedroom. This leads to a discussion in which Martha and George insult Nick in tandem, an argument revealing that Nick was too drunk to have sex with Martha upstairs.

George asks Nick to bring Honey back for the final game, &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;. George and Martha have a son, about whom George has repeatedly told Martha to keep quiet. George talks about Martha's overbearing attitude toward their son. He then prompts her for her &quot;recitation&quot;, in which they describe, in a bizarre duet, their son's upbringing. Martha describes their son's beauty and talents and then accuses George of ruining his life. As this segment progresses, George recites sections of the ''[[Libera me]]'' (part of the [[Requiem Mass]], the [[Latin]] mass for the dead).

At the end of the play, George informs Martha that a messenger from [[Western Union]] arrived at the door earlier with a telegram saying their son was &quot;killed late in the afternoon...on a country road, with his learner's permit in his pocket&quot; and that he &quot;swerved, to avoid a porcupine&quot;. The description matches that of the boy in the gin mill story told earlier. Martha screams, &quot;You can't do that!&quot; and collapses.

It becomes clear to the guests that George and Martha's son is a mutually agreed-upon fiction. The fictional son is a final &quot;game&quot; the two have been playing since discovering early in their marriage that they are infertile. George has decided to &quot;kill&quot; him because Martha broke the game's single rule: never mention the son to others. Overcome with horror and pity, Nick and Honey leave. Martha suggests they could invent a new imaginary child, but George forbids the idea, saying it was time for the game to end. The play ends with George singing, &quot;Who's afraid of [[Virginia Woolf]]?&quot; to Martha, whereupon she replies, &quot;I am, George...I am.&quot;

==Themes==

===Reality and illusion===
Most plays establish the difference between reality and illusion. ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' starts with the latter but leans to the former. More specifically, &quot;George and Martha have evaded the ugliness of their marriage by taking refuge in illusion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kingsley (1973:74){{full citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disappointment that is their life together leads to the bitterness between them. Having no real bond, or at least none that either is willing to admit, they become dependent upon a fake child.

The fabrication of a child, as well as the impact its supposed demise has on Martha, questions the difference between deception and reality. As if to spite their efforts, the contempt Martha and George have for each other destroys their illusion. This lack of illusion does not result in any apparent reality. &quot;All truth&quot;, George says, &quot;[becomes] relative&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1968:69){{full citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, through the fabrication of a child and invention of some silly games, Martha and George intend to escape their problems, including infertility, and reduce their tensions. Martha says, &quot;Awww, 'tis the refuge we take when the unreality of the world weighs too heavy on our tiny heads&quot; (198).

===Critique of societal expectations===
[[Christopher Bigsby]] asserts that this play opposes the idea of a perfect American family and societal expectations as it &quot;attacks the false optimism and myopic confidence of modern society&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bigsby (1967:268){{full citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albee takes a heavy-handed approach to displaying this contrast, making examples of every character and their expectations of the people around them. Societal norms of the 1950s consisted of a nuclear family, two parents and two (or more) children. This conception was picturesque in the idea that the father was the breadwinner, the mother a housewife, and the children well-behaved.

''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' smashes these conventions and shows realistic families that are far from perfect and possibly ruined. The families of Honey and Martha were dominated by their fathers, with no sign of a mother figure in their lives. George and Martha's chance at a perfect family was ruined by infertility and George's failure to become a prominent figure at the university.

==Inspirations==

===Title===
The play's title, which alludes to the English novelist [[Virginia Woolf]], is also a reference to the song &quot;[[Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?]]&quot; from [[Walt Disney]]'s animated version of ''[[Three Little Pigs (film)|The Three Little Pigs]]''. Because the rights to the Disney song are expensive, most stage versions, and the film, have Martha sing to the tune of &quot;[[Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush]]&quot;, a melody that fits the [[meter (poetry)|meter]] fairly well and is in the [[public domain]]. In the first few moments of the play, it is revealed that someone sang the song earlier in the evening at a party, although who first sang it (Martha or some other anonymous party guest) remains unclear. Martha repeatedly needles George over whether he found it funny.

Albee described the inspiration for the title thus:

[[John S. Bell]] criticized Einstein's work in his famous [[Bell's theorem]], which proved that quantum mechanics can make statistical predictions that would be violated if local hidden variables really existed. A number of experiments have tried to verify such predictions, and so far they do not appear to be violated. Current experiments continue to verify the result, including the 2015 &quot;[[Bell test experiments#Hensen et al..2C Giustina et al..2C Shalm et al. .282015.29: .22loophole-free.22 Bell tests|Loophole Free Test]]&quot; that plugged all known sources of error and the 2017 &quot;[[Bell test experiments#Johannes Handsteiner et al. .282017.29: .22Cosmic Bell Test.22 - Measurement Settings from Milky Way Stars|Cosmic Bell Test]]&quot; experiment that used cosmic data streaming from different directions toward the Earth, precluding the possibility the sources of data could have had prior interactions. However, it is possible to augment quantum mechanics with non-local hidden variables to achieve a deterministic theory that is in agreement with experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Jabs | first=Arthur | year=2016 | title= A conjecture concerning determinism, reduction, and measurement in quantum mechanics | doi= 10.1007/s40509-016-0077-7 | journal= Quantum Studies: Mathematics and Foundations | volume= 3 | issue= 4 | pages=279–292| arxiv=1204.0614 | s2cid=32523066 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the [[Bohm interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. Bohm's Interpretation, though, violates special relativity and it is highly controversial whether or not it can be reconciled without giving up on determinism.

More advanced variations on these arguments include [[Quantum contextuality]], by Bell, [[Simon B. Kochen]] and [[Ernst Specker]], which argues that hidden variable theories cannot be &quot;sensible,&quot; meaning that the values of the hidden variables inherently depend on the devices used to measure them.

This debate is relevant because it is easy to imagine specific situations in which the arrival of an electron at a screen at a certain point and time would trigger one event, whereas its arrival at another point would trigger an entirely different event (e.g. see [[Schrödinger's cat]] - a thought experiment used as part of a deeper debate).

Thus, quantum physics casts reasonable doubt on the traditional determinism of classical, Newtonian physics in so far as reality does not seem to be absolutely determined. This was the subject of the famous [[Bohr–Einstein debates]] between Einstein and [[Niels Bohr]] and there is [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics#Comparison|still no consensus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bishop |first1=Robert C. |editor1-first=Robert |editor1-last=Kane |title=The Oxford Handbook of Free Will |edition=Second |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, New York |isbn=9780195399691 | oclc=653483691 |page=90 |chapter=Chaos, Indeterminism, and Free Will |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=kzcFDsWg0GEC&amp;pg=PA90 |quote=The key question is whether to understand the nature of this probability as epistemic or ontic. Along epistemic lines, one possibility is that there is some additional factor (i.e., a hidden mechanism) such that once we discover and understand this factor, we would be able to predict the observed behavior of the quantum stoplight with certainty (physicists call this approach a &quot;hidden variable theory&quot;; see, e.g., Bell 1987, 1–13, 29–39; Bohm 1952a, 1952b; Bohm and Hiley 1993; Bub 1997, 40–114, Holland 1993; see also the preceding essay in this volume by Hodgson). Or perhaps there is an interaction with the broader environment (e.g., neighboring buildings, trees) that we have not taken into account in our observations that explains how these probabilities arise (physicists call this approach decoherence or consistent histories&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;). Under either of these approaches, we would interpret the observed indeterminism in the behavior of stoplights as an expression of our ignorance about the actual workings. Under an ignorance interpretation, indeterminism would not be a fundamental feature of quantum stoplights, but merely epistemic in nature due to our lack of knowledge about the system. Quantum stoplights would turn to be deterministic after all.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baggott|first1=Jim E.|title=Beyond Measure: Modern Physics, Philosophy, and the Meaning of Quantum Theory|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, New York|isbn=978-0-19-852536-3|oclc=52486237|page=203|chapter=Complementarity and Entanglement|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=uVdjwsqrgz8C&amp;q=scientific+consensus+determinism+bell+theorem&amp;pg=PA203|quote=So, was Einstein wrong? In the sense that the EPR paper argued in favour of an objective reality for each quantum particle in an entangled pair independent of the other and of the measuring device, the answer must be yes. But if we take a wider view and ask instead if Einstein was wrong to hold to the realist's belief that the physics of the universe should be objective and deterministic, we must acknowledge that we cannot answer such a question. It is in the nature of theoretical science that there can be no such thing as certainty. A theory is only 'true' for as long as the majority of the scientific community maintain a consensus view that the theory is the one best able to explain the observations. And the story of quantum theory is not over yet.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adequate determinism (see [[#Varieties|Varieties]], above) is the reason that Stephen Hawking calls [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|Libertarian free will]] &quot;just an illusion&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GDesign&quot;/&gt;

[[File:HEUraniumC.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Chaotic radioactivity is the next explanatory challenge for physicists supporting determinism.]]
All uranium found on earth is thought to have been synthesized during a [[supernova]] explosion that occurred roughly 5 billion years ago. Even before the laws of quantum mechanics were developed to their present level, the [[radioactivity]] of such elements has posed a challenge to determinism due to its unpredictability. One gram of [[uranium-238]], a commonly occurring radioactive substance, contains some 2.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; atoms. Each of these atoms are identical and indistinguishable according to all tests known to modern science. Yet about 12600 times a second, one of the atoms in that gram will decay, giving off an [[alpha particle]]. The challenge for determinism is to explain why and when decay occurs, since it does not seem to depend on external stimulus. Indeed, no extant theory of physics makes [[testable]] predictions of exactly when any given atom will decay. At best scientists can discover determined probabilities in the form of the element's [[half life]].

The time dependent [[Schrödinger equation]] gives the first time [[derivative]] of the [[quantum state]]. That is, it explicitly and uniquely predicts the development of the [[wave function]] with time.
::&lt;math&gt;i\hbar\frac{\partial\psi(x,t)}{\partial t} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2\psi(x,t)}{\partial x^2}+V(x)\psi&lt;/math&gt;
So if the wave function itself is reality (rather than probability of classical coordinates), then the unitary evolution of the wave function in quantum mechanics, can be said to be deterministic. But the unitary evolution of the wave function is not the entirety of quantum mechanics.

Asserting that quantum mechanics is deterministic by treating the wave function itself as reality might be thought to imply a [[Universal wavefunction|single wave function for the entire universe]], starting at the origin of the universe. Such a &quot;wave function of everything&quot; would carry the probabilities of not just the world we know, but every other possible world that could have evolved. For example, large voids in the distributions of [[galaxy|galaxies]] are believed by many cosmologists to have originated in quantum fluctuations during the big bang. (''See'' [[cosmic inflation]], [[primordial fluctuations]] and [[large-scale structure of the cosmos]].)

However, neither the posited reality nor the proven and extraordinary accuracy of the wave function and quantum mechanics at small scales can imply or reasonably suggest the existence of a single wave function for the entire universe. Quantum mechanics breaks down wherever gravity becomes significant, because nothing in the wave function, or in quantum mechanics, predicts anything at all about gravity. And this is obviously of great importance on larger scales.

Gravity is thought of as a large-scale force, with a longer reach than any other. But gravity becomes significant even at masses that are tiny compared to the mass of the universe.

A wave function the size of the universe might successfully model a universe with no gravity. Our universe, with gravity, is vastly different from what quantum mechanics alone predicts. To forget this is a colossal error.

[[Objective collapse theory|Objective collapse theories]], which involve a dynamic (and non-deterministic) collapse of the wave function (e.g. [[Ghirardi–Rimini–Weber theory]], [[Penrose interpretation]], or [[causal fermion system]]s) avoid these absurdities. The theory of [[causal fermion system]]s for example, is able to unify [[quantum mechanics]], [[general relativity]] and [[quantum field theory]], via a more fundamental theory that is non-linear, but gives rise to the linear behaviour of the wave function and also gives rise to the non-linear, non-deterministic, wave-function collapse. These theories suggest that a deeper understanding of the theory underlying quantum mechanics shows the universe is indeed non-deterministic at a fundamental level.

'''Victoria''' (Alexandrina Victoria; 24 May 1819 – 22 January 1901) was [[List of British monarchs|Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] from 20 June 1837 until her death. Parliament  voted her the additional title of [[Empress of India]] in 1876. Known as the [[Victorian era]], her reign of 63 years and seven months was [[List of monarchs in Britain by length of reign|longer than that of any of her predecessors]]. It was a period of industrial, political, scientific, and military change within the United Kingdom, and was marked by a great expansion of the [[British Empire]].

Victoria was the daughter of [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn]] (the fourth son of [[King George&amp;nbsp;III]]), and [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]]. After both the Duke and his father died in 1820, she was [[Kensington System|raised under close supervision]] by her mother and her [[comptroller]], [[John Conroy]]. She inherited the throne aged 18 after her father's three elder brothers died without surviving legitimate issue. Though a [[constitutional monarch]], privately, Victoria attempted to influence government policy and ministerial appointments; publicly, she became a national icon who was identified with strict standards of [[Victorian morality|personal morality]].

Victoria married her first cousin [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] in 1840. Their [[#Issue|children]] married into royal and noble families across the continent, earning Victoria the [[sobriquet]] &quot;the [[grandmother of Europe]]&quot; and spreading [[haemophilia in European royalty]]. After Albert's death in 1861, Victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances. As a result of her seclusion, [[republicanism in the United Kingdom]] temporarily gained strength, but in the latter half of her reign, her popularity recovered. Her [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria|Golden]] and Diamond Jubilees were times of public celebration. She died on the [[Isle of Wight]] in 1901. The last [[British monarch]] of the [[House of Hanover]], she was succeeded by her son [[Edward VII]] of the [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]].

==Birth and family==

[[File:Denning, Stephen Poyntz - Princess Victoria aged Four - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Portrait of Victoria at age 4|Victoria at age four, by [[Stephen Poyntz Denning]] (1823)]]

Victoria's father was [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn]], the fourth son of the reigning King of the United Kingdom, [[George&amp;nbsp;III]]. Until 1817, Edward's niece, [[Princess Charlotte of Wales]], was the only legitimate grandchild of George&amp;nbsp;III. Her death in 1817 precipitated a [[succession crisis]] that brought pressure on the Duke of Kent and his unmarried brothers to marry and have children. In 1818 he married [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]], a widowed German princess with two children—[[Carl, 3rd Prince of Leiningen|Carl]] (1804–1856) and [[Princess Feodora of Leiningen|Feodora]] (1807–1872)—by her first marriage to the [[Emich Carl, 2nd Prince of Leiningen|Prince of Leiningen]]. Her brother [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold]] was Princess Charlotte's widower. The Duke and Duchess of Kent's only child, Victoria, was born at 4:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 24 May 1819 at [[Kensington Palace]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 3–12; Strachey, pp. 1–17; Woodham-Smith, pp. 15–29&lt;/ref&gt;

Victoria was christened privately by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Charles Manners-Sutton]], on 24 June 1819 in the Cupola Room at Kensington Palace.&lt;ref&gt;Her godparents were Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]] (represented by her uncle [[Frederick, Duke of York]]), her uncle [[George, Prince Regent]], her aunt [[Queen Charlotte of Württemberg]] (represented by Victoria's aunt [[Princess Augusta Sophia of the United Kingdom|Princess Augusta]]) and Victoria's maternal grandmother the [[Countess Augusta of Reuss-Ebersdorf|Dowager Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]] (represented by Victoria's aunt [[Princess Mary, Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh]]).&lt;/ref&gt; She was baptised ''Alexandrina'' after one of her godparents, Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]], and ''Victoria'', after her mother. Additional names proposed by her parents—Georgina (or Georgiana), Charlotte, and Augusta—were dropped on the instructions of Kent's eldest brother [[George, Prince Regent]].&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 12–13; Longford, p. 23; Woodham-Smith, pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt;

At birth, Victoria was fifth in the line of succession after the four eldest sons of George&amp;nbsp;III: the Prince Regent (later George&amp;nbsp;IV); [[Frederick, Duke of York]]; [[William, Duke of Clarence]] (later William&amp;nbsp;IV); and Victoria's father, Edward, Duke of Kent.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The Prince Regent had no surviving children, and the Duke of York had no children; further, both were estranged from their wives, who were both past child-bearing age, so the two eldest brothers were unlikely to have any further legitimate children. William and Edward married on the same day in 1818, but both of William's legitimate daughters died as infants. The first of these was Princess Charlotte, who was born and died on 27 March 1819, two months before Victoria was born. Victoria's father died in January 1820, when Victoria was less than a year old. A week later her grandfather died and was succeeded by his eldest son as George&amp;nbsp;IV. Victoria was then third in line to the throne after Frederick and William. William's second daughter, [[Princess Elizabeth of Clarence]], lived for twelve weeks from 10 December 1820 to 4&amp;nbsp;March 1821, and for that period Victoria was fourth in line.&lt;ref&gt;Worsley, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Duke of York died in 1827, followed by George&amp;nbsp;IV in 1830; the throne passed to their next surviving brother, William, and Victoria became [[heir presumptive]]. The [[Regency Act 1830]] made special provision for Victoria's mother to act as regent in case William died while Victoria was still a minor.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 31; St Aubyn, p. 26; Woodham-Smith, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; King William distrusted the Duchess's capacity to be regent, and in 1836 he declared in her presence that he wanted to live until Victoria's 18th birthday, so that a [[regency]] could be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 46; Longford, p. 54; St Aubyn, p. 50; Waller, p. 344; Woodham-Smith, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heir presumptive==

[[File:Princess Victoria and Dash by George Hayter.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Victoria with her spaniel Dash by [[George Hayter]], 1833]]

Victoria later described her childhood as &quot;rather melancholy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 19; Marshall, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother was extremely protective, and Victoria was raised largely isolated from other children under the so-called &quot;[[Kensington System]]&quot;, an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the Duchess and her ambitious and domineering [[comptroller]], Sir [[John Conroy]], who was rumoured to be the Duchess's lover.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 27; Longford, pp. 35–38, 118–119; St Aubyn, pp. 21–22; Woodham-Smith, pp. 70–72. The rumours were false in the opinion of these biographers.&lt;/ref&gt; The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable (including most of her father's family), and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 27–28; Waller, pp. 341–342; Woodham-Smith, pp. 63–65&lt;/ref&gt; The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of King William's illegitimate children.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 32–33; Longford, pp. 38–39, 55; Marshall, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria shared a bedroom with her mother every night, studied with private tutors to a regular timetable, and spent her play-hours with her dolls and her [[King Charles Spaniel]], [[Dash (spaniel)|Dash]].&lt;ref&gt;Waller, pp. 338–341; Woodham-Smith, pp. 68–69, 91&lt;/ref&gt; Her lessons included French, German, Italian, and Latin,&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 18; Longford, p. 31; Woodham-Smith, pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt; but she spoke only English at home.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 31; Woodham-Smith, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1830, the Duchess of Kent and Conroy took Victoria across the centre of England to visit the [[Malvern Hills]], stopping at towns and great [[country houses]] along the way.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt; Similar journeys to other parts of England and Wales were taken in 1832, 1833, 1834 and 1835. To the King's annoyance, Victoria was enthusiastically welcomed in each of the stops.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 35–39; Woodham-Smith, pp. 88–89, 102&lt;/ref&gt; William compared the journeys to [[royal progress]]es and was concerned that they portrayed Victoria as his rival rather than his heir presumptive.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 36; Woodham-Smith, pp. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria disliked the trips; the constant round of public appearances made her tired and ill, and there was little time for her to rest.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 35–40; Woodham-Smith, pp. 92, 102&lt;/ref&gt; She objected on the grounds of the King's disapproval, but her mother dismissed his complaints as motivated by jealousy and forced Victoria to continue the tours.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 38–39; Longford, p. 47; Woodham-Smith, pp. 101–102&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Ramsgate]] in October 1835, Victoria contracted a severe fever,&lt;!--Longford and Marshall says typhoid; Hibbert says maybe typhoid or tonsillitis; Woodham-Smith says probably tonsillitis and that biographer Sidney Lee was the first to say typhoid--&gt; which Conroy initially dismissed as a childish pretence.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 42; Woodham-Smith, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; While Victoria was ill, Conroy and the Duchess unsuccessfully badgered her to make Conroy her private secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 42; Longford, pp. 47–48; Marshall, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager, Victoria resisted persistent attempts by her mother and Conroy to appoint him to her staff.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 42, 50; Woodham-Smith, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Once queen, she banned him from her presence, but he remained in her mother's household.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 46; St Aubyn, p. 67; Waller, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1836, Victoria's maternal uncle [[Leopold I, King of the Belgians|Leopold]], who had been King of the Belgians since 1831, hoped to marry her to [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]],&lt;ref&gt;Longford, pp. 29, 51; Waller, p. 363; Weintraub, pp. 43–49&lt;/ref&gt; the son of his brother [[Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. Leopold arranged for Victoria's mother to invite her Coburg relatives to visit her in May 1836, with the purpose of introducing Victoria to Albert.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 51; Weintraub, pp. 43–49&lt;/ref&gt; [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], however, disapproved of any match with the Coburgs, and instead favoured the suit of [[Prince Alexander of the Netherlands]], second son of [[William II of the Netherlands|the Prince of Orange]].&lt;ref&gt;Longford, pp. 51–52; St Aubyn, p. 43; Weintraub, pp. 43–49; Woodham-Smith, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria was aware of the various matrimonial plans and critically appraised a parade of eligible princes.&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub, pp. 43–49&lt;/ref&gt; According to her diary, she enjoyed Albert's company from the beginning. After the visit she wrote, &quot;[Albert] is extremely handsome; his hair is about the same colour as mine; his eyes are large and blue, and he has a beautiful nose and a very sweet mouth with fine teeth; but the charm of his countenance is his expression, which is most delightful.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Victoria quoted in Marshall, p. 27 and Weintraub, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander, on the other hand, she described as &quot;very plain&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria quoted in Hibbert, p. 99; St Aubyn, p. 43; Weintraub, p. 49 and Woodham-Smith, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

Victoria wrote to King Leopold, whom she considered her &quot;best and kindest adviser&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[[Queen Victoria's journals|Victoria's journal]], October 1835, quoted in St Aubyn, p. 36 and Woodham-Smith, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; to thank him &quot;for the prospect of ''great'' happiness you have contributed to give me, in the person of dear Albert&amp;nbsp;... He possesses every quality that could be desired to render me perfectly happy. He is so sensible, so kind, and so good, and so amiable too. He has besides the most pleasing and delightful exterior and appearance you can possibly see.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 102; Marshall, p. 60; Waller, p. 363; Weintraub, p. 51; Woodham-Smith, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; However at 17, Victoria, though interested in Albert, was not yet ready to marry. The parties did not undertake a formal engagement, but assumed that the match would take place in due time.&lt;ref&gt;Waller, pp. 363–364; Weintraub, pp. 53, 58, 64, and 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early reign==

[[File:Victoriatothrone.jpg|alt=Drawing of two men on their knees in front of Victoria|thumb|left|Victoria receives the news of her accession from [[Francis Conyngham, 2nd Marquess Conyngham|Lord Conyngham]] (left) and [[William Howley|the Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Engraving after painting by [[Henry Tanworth Wells]], 1887.]]

Victoria turned 18 on 24 May 1837, and a regency was avoided. Less than a month later, on 20 June 1837, William IV died at the age of 71, and Victoria became Queen of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Under section&amp;nbsp;2 of the Regency Act 1830, the [[Accession Council]]'s proclamation declared Victoria as the King's successor &quot;saving the rights of any issue of His late Majesty King William the Fourth which may be borne of his late Majesty's Consort&quot;. {{London Gazette|issue=19509|date=20 June 1837|page=1581}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her diary she wrote, &quot;I was awoke at 6&amp;nbsp;o'clock by Mamma, who told me the [[William Howley|Archbishop of Canterbury]] and [[Francis Conyngham, 2nd Marquess Conyngham|Lord Conyngham]] were here and wished to see me. I got out of bed and went into my sitting-room (only in my dressing gown) and ''alone'', and saw them. Lord Conyngham then acquainted me that my poor Uncle, the King, was no more, and had expired at 12 minutes past 2&amp;nbsp;this morning, and consequently that ''I'' am ''Queen''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;St Aubyn, pp. 55–57; Woodham-Smith, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Official documents prepared on the first day of her reign described her as Alexandrina Victoria, but the first name was withdrawn at her own wish and not used again.&lt;ref&gt;Woodham-Smith, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1714, [[Great Britain|Britain]] had shared a monarch with [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]] in Germany, but under [[Salic law]] women were excluded from the Hanoverian succession. While Victoria inherited all the British [[Dominion]]s, her father's unpopular younger brother, the [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|Duke of Cumberland]], became [[King of Hanover]]. He was her [[heir presumptive]] while she was childless.&lt;ref&gt;Packard, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of Victoria's accession, the government was led by the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] prime minister [[Lord Melbourne]]. The Prime Minister at once became a powerful influence on the politically inexperienced Queen, who relied on him for advice.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 66–69; St Aubyn, p. 76; Woodham-Smith, pp. 143–147&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Greville (diarist)|Charles Greville]] supposed that the widowed and childless Melbourne was &quot;passionately fond of her as he might be of his daughter if he had one&quot;, and Victoria probably saw him as a father figure.&lt;ref&gt;Greville quoted in Hibbert, p. 67; Longford, p. 70 and Woodham-Smith, pp. 143–144&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coronation of Queen Victoria|Her coronation]] took place on 28 June 1838 at [[Westminster Abbey]]. Over 400,000 visitors came to London for the celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Queen Victoria's Coronation 1838|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/The%20Royal%20Collection%20and%20other%20collections/TheRoyalArchives/QueenVictoriaeducationproject/QueenVictoriasCoronation1838.aspx|publisher=The British Monarchy|access-date=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became the first sovereign to take up residence at [[Buckingham Palace]]&lt;ref&gt;St Aubyn, p. 69; Waller, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt; and inherited the revenues of the duchies of [[Duchy of Lancaster|Lancaster]] and [[Duchy of Cornwall|Cornwall]] as well as being granted a [[civil list]] allowance of £385,000 per year. Financially prudent, she paid off her father's debts.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 58; Longford, pp. 73–74; Woodham-Smith, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of her reign Victoria was popular,&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 42; St Aubyn, pp. 63, 96&lt;/ref&gt; but her reputation suffered in an 1839 court intrigue when one of her mother's ladies-in-waiting, [[Lady Flora Hastings]], developed an abdominal growth that was widely rumoured to be an out-of-wedlock pregnancy by Sir John Conroy.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 47; Waller, p. 356; Woodham-Smith, pp. 164–166&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria believed the rumours.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 77–78; Longford, p. 97; St Aubyn, p. 97; Waller, p. 357; Woodham-Smith, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; She hated Conroy, and despised &quot;that odious Lady Flora&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Victoria's journal, 25 April 1838, quoted in Woodham-Smith, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; because she had conspired with Conroy and the Duchess of Kent in the Kensington System.&lt;ref&gt;St Aubyn, p. 96; Woodham-Smith, pp. 162, 165&lt;/ref&gt; At first, Lady Flora refused to submit to an intimate medical examination, until in mid-February she eventually agreed, and was found to be a virgin.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 79; Longford, p. 98; St Aubyn, p. 99; Woodham-Smith, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; Conroy, the Hastings family, and the opposition [[Tories]] organised a press campaign implicating the Queen in the spreading of false rumours about Lady Flora.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 80–81; Longford, pp. 102–103; St Aubyn, pp. 101–102&lt;/ref&gt; When Lady Flora died in July, the post-mortem revealed a large tumour on her liver that had distended her abdomen.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 122; Marshall, p. 57; St Aubyn, p. 104; Woodham-Smith, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; At public appearances, Victoria was hissed and jeered as &quot;Mrs. Melbourne&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 83; Longford, pp. 120–121; Marshall, p. 57; St Aubyn, p. 105; Waller, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1839, Melbourne resigned after [[Radicals (UK)|Radicals]] and Tories (both of whom Victoria detested) voted against a bill to suspend the constitution of [[Jamaica]]. The bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;St Aubyn, p. 107; Woodham-Smith, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen commissioned a Tory, Sir [[Robert Peel]], to form a new ministry. At the time, it was customary for the prime minister to appoint members of the [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|Royal Household]], who were usually his political allies and their spouses. Many of the Queen's [[ladies of the bedchamber]] were wives of Whigs, and Peel expected to replace them with wives of Tories. In what became known as the [[bedchamber crisis]], Victoria, advised by Melbourne, objected to their removal. Peel refused to govern under the restrictions imposed by the Queen, and consequently resigned his commission, allowing Melbourne to return to office.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 94–96; Marshall, pp. 53–57; St Aubyn, pp. 109–112; Waller, pp. 359–361; Woodham-Smith, pp. 170–174&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==

[[File:Victoria Marriage01.jpg|upright=1.4|alt=Painting of a lavish wedding attended by richly dressed people in a magnificent room|thumb|Marriage of Victoria and Albert, painted by [[George Hayter]]]]

Though Victoria was now queen, as an unmarried young woman she was required by social convention to live with her mother, despite their differences over the Kensington System and her mother's continued reliance on Conroy.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 84; Marshall, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother was consigned to a remote apartment in Buckingham Palace, and Victoria often refused to see her.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 72; Waller, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt; When Victoria complained to Melbourne that her mother's proximity promised &quot;torment for many years&quot;, Melbourne sympathised but said it could be avoided by marriage, which Victoria called a &quot;schocking {{sic}} alternative&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Woodham-Smith, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria showed interest in Albert's education for the future role he would have to play as her husband, but she resisted attempts to rush her into wedlock.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 103–104; Marshall, pp. 60–66; Weintraub, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Victoria continued to praise Albert following his second visit in October 1839. Albert and Victoria felt mutual affection and the Queen proposed to him on 15 October 1839, just five days after he had arrived at Windsor.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 107–110; St Aubyn, pp. 129–132; Weintraub, pp. 77–81; Woodham-Smith, pp. 182–184, 187&lt;/ref&gt; They were married on 10 February 1840, in the [[Chapel Royal]] of [[St James's Palace]], London. Victoria was love-struck. She spent the evening after their wedding lying down with a headache, but wrote ecstatically in her diary:
{{Quote|I NEVER, NEVER spent such an evening!!! MY DEAREST DEAREST DEAR Albert&amp;nbsp;... his excessive love &amp; affection gave me feelings of heavenly love &amp; happiness I never could have ''hoped'' to have felt before! He clasped me in his arms, &amp; we kissed each other again &amp; again! His beauty, his sweetness &amp; gentleness – really how can I ever be thankful enough to have such a ''Husband''!&amp;nbsp;... to be called by names of tenderness, I have never yet heard used to me before – was bliss beyond belief! Oh! This was the happiest day of my life!&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 123; Longford, p. 143; Woodham-Smith, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Albert became an important political adviser as well as the Queen's companion, replacing Melbourne as the dominant influential figure in the first half of her life.&lt;ref&gt;St Aubyn, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria's mother was evicted from the palace, to Ingestre House in [[Belgrave Square]]. After the death of Victoria's aunt, [[Princess Augusta Sophia of the United Kingdom|Princess Augusta]], in 1840, Victoria's mother was given both [[Clarence House|Clarence]] and [[Frogmore House]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 265, Woodham-Smith, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; Through Albert's mediation, relations between mother and daughter slowly improved.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 152; St Aubyn, pp. 174–175; Woodham-Smith, p. 412&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Edward Oxford shoots at H. M. the Queen, 1840.jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|Contemporary lithograph of [[Edward Oxford]]'s attempt to assassinate Victoria, 1840]]

During Victoria's first pregnancy in 1840, in the first few months of the marriage, 18-year-old [[Edward Oxford]] attempted to assassinate her while she was riding in a carriage with Prince Albert on her way to visit her mother. Oxford fired twice, but either both bullets missed or, as he later claimed, the guns had no shot.&lt;ref&gt;Charles, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; He was tried for [[high treason]], found [[not guilty by reason of insanity]], committed to an insane asylum indefinitely, and later sent to live in [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 421–422; St Aubyn, pp. 160–161&lt;/ref&gt; In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Victoria's popularity soared, mitigating residual discontent over the Hastings affair and the bedchamber crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Woodham-Smith, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; Her daughter, also named [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Victoria]], was born on 21 November 1840. The Queen hated being pregnant,&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 130; Longford, p. 154; Marshall, p. 122; St Aubyn, p. 159; Woodham-Smith, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; viewed breast-feeding with disgust,&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 149; St Aubyn, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; and thought newborn babies were ugly.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 149; Longford, p. 154; Marshall, p. 123; Waller, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, over the following seventeen years, she and Albert had a further eight children: [[Edward VII|Albert Edward]] (b. 1841), [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom|Alice]] (b. 1843), [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Alfred]] (b. 1844), [[Princess Helena of the United Kingdom|Helena]] (b. 1846), [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Louise]] (b. 1848), [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Arthur]] (b. 1850), [[Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany|Leopold]] (b. 1853) and [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|Beatrice]] (b. 1857).

Victoria's household was largely run by her childhood governess, Baroness [[Louise Lehzen]] from [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]]. Lehzen had been a formative influence on Victoria&lt;ref&gt;Woodham-Smith, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; and had supported her against the Kensington System.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 56; St Aubyn, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Albert, however, thought that Lehzen was incompetent and that her mismanagement threatened his daughter's health. After a furious row between Victoria and Albert over the issue, Lehzen was pensioned off in 1842, and Victoria's close relationship with her ended.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 150–156; Marshall, p. 87; St Aubyn, pp. 171–173; Woodham-Smith, pp. 230–232&lt;/ref&gt;

==1842–1860==

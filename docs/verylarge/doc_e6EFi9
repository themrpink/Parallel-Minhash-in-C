After thirteen years of exile, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana journey southward along the banks of river [[Godavari]], where they build cottages and live off the land. At the [[Panchavati]] forest they are visited by a [[rakshasi]] named [[Shurpanakha]], sister of Ravana. She tries to seduce the brothers and, after failing, attempts to kill Sita. Lakshmana stops her by cutting off her nose and ears. Hearing of this, her brothers [[Khara (Ramayana)|Khara]] and Dushan organise an attack against the princes. Rama defeats Khara and his raskshasas.

When the news of these events reach Ravana, he resolves to destroy Rama by capturing Sita with the aid of the ''rakshasa'' [[Maricha]]. Maricha, assuming the form of a golden deer, captivates Sita's attention. Entranced by the beauty of the deer, Sita pleads with Rama to capture it. Rama, aware that this is the ploy of the demons, cannot dissuade Sita from her desire and chases the deer into the forest, leaving Sita under Lakshmana's guard. 

After some time, Sita hears Rama calling out to her; afraid for his life, she insists that Lakshmana rush to his aid. Lakshmana tries to assure her that Rama cannot be hurt that easily and that it is best if he continues to follow Ram's orders to protect her. On the verge of hysterics, Sita insists that it is not she but Rama who needs Lakshman's help. He obeys her wish but stipulates that she is not to leave the cottage or entertain any stranger. He draws a chalk outline, the [[Lakshmana rekha]], around the cottage and casts a spell on it that prevents anyone from entering the boundary but allows people to exit. With the coast finally clear, Ravana appears in the guise of an ascetic requesting Sita's hospitality. Unaware of her guest's plan, Sita is tricked into leaving the rekha and is then forcibly carried away by Ravana.&lt;ref&gt;Rajarajan, R.K.K.

[[Jatayu]], a [[vulture]], tries to rescue Sita, but is mortally wounded. At Lanka, Sita is kept under the guard of ''rakshasis''. Ravana asks Sita to marry him, but she refuses, being eternally devoted to Rama. Meanwhile, Rama and Lakshmana learn about Sita's abduction from Jatayu and immediately set out to save her. During their search, they meet [[Kabandha]] and the ascetic [[Shabari]], who direct them towards Sugriva and Hanuman.

''Kishkindha Kanda'' is set in the [[ape]] (''Vanara'') citadel [[Kishkindha]]. Rama and Lakshmana meet Hanuman, the biggest devotee of Rama, greatest of ape heroes and an adherent of [[Sugriva]], the banished pretender to the throne of Kishkindha. Rama befriends Sugriva and helps him by killing his elder brother [[Vali (Ramayana)|Vali]] thus regaining the kingdom of Kishkindha, in exchange for helping Rama to recover Sita.

However Sugriva soon forgets his promise and spends his time enjoying his newly gained power. The clever former ape queen [[Tara (Ramayana)|Tara]] (wife of Vali) calmly intervenes to prevent an enraged Lakshmana from destroying the ape citadel. She then eloquently convinces Sugriva to honour his pledge. Sugriva then sends search parties to the four corners of the earth, only to return without success from north, east and west. The southern search party under the leadership of [[Angada]] and Hanuman learns from a vulture named [[Sampati]] (elder brother of Jatayu), that Sita was taken to Lanka.

===''Sundara Kanda''===

{{Main|Sundara Kanda}}
[[File:Sita at ashokavana.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Ravana is meeting Sita at Ashokavana. Hanuman is seen on the tree.]]

''Sundara Kand'' forms the heart of Valmiki's Ramyana and consists of a detailed, vivid account of [[Hanuman]]'s adventures. After learning about Sita, Hanuman [[shapeshifting|assumes]] a gargantuan form and makes a colossal leap across the sea to Lanka. On the way he meets with many challenges like facing a Gandharva kanya who comes in the form of a demon to test his abilities. He encounters a mountain named Mainakudu who offers Hanuman assistance and offers him rest. Hanuman refuses because there is little time remaining to complete the search for Sita.

After entering into Lanka, he finds a demon, Lankini, who protects all of Lanka. Hanuman fights with her and subjugates her in order to get into Lanka. In the process Lankini, who had an earlier vision/warning from the gods that the end of Lanka nears if someone defeats Lankini. Here, Hanuman explores the demons' kingdom and spies on Ravana. He locates Sita in Ashoka grove, where she is being wooed and threatened by Ravana and his rakshasis to marry Ravana. Hanuman reassures Sita, giving Ram's signet ring as a sign of good faith. He offers to carry Sita back to Ram; however, she refuses and says that it is not the dharma, stating that Ramyana will not have significance if Hanuman carries her to Rama – &quot;When Rama is not there Ravana carried Sita forcibly and when Ravana was not there, Hanuman carried Sita back to Ram&quot;. She says that Rama himself must come and avenge the insult of her abduction.

Hanuman then wreaks havoc in Lanka by destroying trees and buildings and killing Ravana's warriors. He allows himself to be captured and delivered to Ravana. He gives a bold lecture to Ravana to release Sita. He is condemned and his tail is set on fire, but he escapes his bonds and leaping from roof to roof, sets fire to Ravana's citadel and makes the giant leap back from the island. The joyous search party returns to Kishkindha with the news.

Also known as ''Lanka Kanda'', this book describes the war between the army of Rama and the army of Ravana. Having received Hanuman's report on Sita, Rama and Lakshmana proceed with their allies towards the shore of the southern sea. There they are joined by Ravana's renegade brother [[Vibhishana]]. The apes named [[Nala]] and [[Nila (Ramayana)|Nila]] construct a floating bridge (known as [[Adam's Bridge|Rama Setu]])&lt;ref&gt;Rajarajan, R.K.K. (2014) Reflections on &quot;Rāma-Setu&quot; in South Asian Tradition. ''The Quarterly Journal of the Mythic Society'', Vol. 105.3: 1–14, {{ISSN|0047-8555}}. https://www.academia.edu/8779702/Reflections_on_R%C4%81ma-Setu_in_South_Asian_Tradition&lt;/ref&gt; across the sea, using stones that floated on water because they had Ram's name written on them. The princes and their army cross over to Lanka. A lengthy war ensues. During a battle, Ravana's son [[Indrajit]] hurls a powerful weapon at Lakshmana, who is badly wounded. So Hanuman assumes a gigantic form and flies from Lanka to the Himalayas. Upon reaching Mount Sumeru, Hanuman was unable to identify the herb that could cure Lakshmana and so decided to bring the entire mountain back to Lanka. Eventually, the war ends when Rama kills Ravana. Rama then installs Vibhishana on the throne of Lanka.

On meeting Sita, Rama asks her to undergo an Agni Pariksha (test of fire) to prove her chastity, as he wants to get rid of the rumors surrounding her purity. When Sita plunges into the sacrificial fire, [[Agni]], lord of fire raises Sita, unharmed, to the throne, attesting to her innocence. The episode of ''Agni Pariksha'' varies in the versions of Ramayana by Valmiki and [[Tulsidas]]. In [[Tulsidas]]'s [[Ramacharitamanas]], Sita was under the protection of Agni (see [[Maya Sita]]) so it was necessary to bring her out before reuniting with Rama.

=== ''Uttara Kanda'' ===

[[File:Sita with children.jpg|180px|thumb|[[Sita]] with [[Lava]] and [[Kusha]]]]

Uttara Kanda is the last book of Ramayana. It is a book of made up of conversations between Kakbhusundi and Garud. This book was added by Tulsidas after hearing it from Kakbhusundi and Garud. It depicts Ram's reign of [[Ayodhya (Ramayana)|Ayodhya]], birth of [[Lava (Ramayana)|Lava]] and [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kusha]], the [[Ashvamedha]] [[yajna]] and last days of Rama. At the expiration of his term of exile, Rama returns to Ayodhya with Sita, Lakshmana and Hanuman, where the coronation is performed. On being asked to prove his devotion to Rama, Hanuman tears his chest open and to everyone's surprise, there is an image of Rama and Sita inside his chest. Rama rules Ayodhya and the reign is called ''Ram-Rajya'' (a place where the common folk are happy, fulfilled and satisfied).

This book (kanda) is likely a later addition to the earliest layers of the ''Valmiki'' ''Ramayana''. In this chapter, as time passes in reign of Rama, spies start getting rumours that people are questioning Sita's purity as she stayed in the home of another man for a year without her husband. The common folk start gossiping about Sita and question Ram's decision to make her Queen. Rama is extremely distraught on hearing the news, but finally tells Lakshmana that the purity of the Queen of Ayodhya has to be above any gossip and rumour. He instructs him to take Sita to a forest outside Ayodhya and leave her there with a heavy heart. Lakshmana reluctantly drops Sita in a forest for another exile.

Sita finds refuge in Sage [[Valmiki]]'s ashram, where she gives birth to twin boys, Lava and Kusha. Meanwhile, Rama conducts an Ashwamedha yajna (A holy declaration of the authority of the king). Lava and Kusha capture the horse (sign of the yajna) and defeat the whole army of Ayodhya which come to protect the horse. Later on, both the brothers defeat [[Lakshmana]], [[Bharata (Ramayana)]], [[Shatrughan]] and other warriors and take Hanuman as prisoner. Finally Rama himself arrives and defeats the two mighty brothers. Valmiki updates Sita about this development and advises both the brothers to go to Ayodhya and tell the story of Sita's sacrifice to the common folks. Both brothers arrive at Ayodhya but face many difficulties while convincing the people. Hanuman helps both the brothers in this task. At one point of time, Valmiki brings Sita forward. Seeing Sita, Rama realises that Lava and Kusha are his own sons. Again complicit Nagarsen (One of the primaries who instigated the hatred towards Sita) challenges Sita's character and asks her to prove her purity. Sita is overflown with emotions and decides to go back to Mother Earth from where she emerged. She says that, &quot;If I am pure, this earth will open and swallow me whole.&quot; At that very moment, the earth opens up and swallows Sita. Rama rules Ayodhya for many years and finally takes Samadhi into [[Sarayu]] river along with his 3 brothers and leaves the world. He goes back to [[Vaikuntha]] in his [[Vishnu]] form and meets Sita there who by then assumed the form of [[Lakshmi]].

As in many oral epics, multiple versions of the ''Ramayana'' survive. In particular, the ''Ramayana'' related in north India differs in important respects from that preserved in south India and the rest of southeast Asia. There is an extensive tradition of oral storytelling based on ''Ramayana'' in [[Indonesia]], [[Cambodia]], [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Maldives]].

===India===

There are diverse regional versions of the ''Ramayana'' written by various authors in India. Some of them differ significantly from each other. During the 12th century, [[Kambar (poet)|Kamban]] wrote [[Ramavataram]], known popularly as [[Kambaramayanam]] in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], but references to [[Ramayana in Tamil literature|Ramayana story appear in Tamil literature]] as early as 3rd century CE. A [[Telugu language|Telugu]] version, [[Ranganatha Ramayanam]], was written by [[Gona Budda Reddy]] in the 14th century. The earliest translation to a regional Indo-Aryan language is the early 14th century [[Saptakanda Ramayana]] in [[Assamese language|Assamese]] by [[Madhava Kandali]]. Valmiki's ''Ramayana'' inspired [[Sri Ramacharit Manas]] by [[Tulsidas]] in 1576, an epic [[Awadhi]] (a dialect of Hindi) version with a slant more grounded in a different realm of Hindu literature, that of [[bhakti]]; it is an acknowledged masterpiece of India, popularly known as ''Tulsi-krita Ramayana''. [[Gujarat]]i poet Premanand wrote a version of the ''Ramayana'' in the 17th century. Other versions include [[Krittivasi Ramayan]], a [[Bengali language|Bengali]] version by [[Krittibas Ojha]] in the 15th century; [[Vilanka Ramayana]] by 15th century poet [[Sarala Dasa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC|publisher=Infobase Publishing|date=1 January 2006|isbn=9780816075645|first1=Constance|last1=Jones|first2=James D.|last2=Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Dandi Ramayana]]'' (also known as ''[[Jagamohana Ramayana]]'') by 16th century poet Balarama Dasa, both in [[Odia language|Odia]]; a Torave Ramayana in [[Kannada]] by 16th-century poet Narahari; [[Adhyathmaramayanam]], a [[Malayalam]] version by [[Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan]] in the 16th century; in [[Marathi language|Marathi]] by Sridhara in the 18th century; in [[Maithili language|Maithili]] by Chanda Jha in the 19th century; and in the 20th century, Rashtrakavi [[Kuvempu]]'s [[Sri Ramayana Darshanam]] in [[Kannada]] and Srimad Ramayana Kalpavrikshamu in Telugu by Viswanatha Satyanarayana who received Jnanapeeth award for this work. 

There is a sub-plot to the ''Ramayana'', prevalent in some parts of India, relating the adventures of [[Ahiravan]] and Mahi Ravana, evil brother of Ravana, which enhances the role of Hanuman in the story. Hanuman rescues Rama and Lakshmana after they are kidnapped by the Ahi-Mahi Ravana at the behest of Ravana and held prisoner in a cave, to be sacrificed to the goddess [[Kali]]. [[Adbhuta Ramayana]] is a version that is obscure but also attributed to [[Valmiki]] – intended as a supplementary to the original [[Valmiki Ramayana]]. In this variant of the narrative, Sita is accorded far more prominence, such as elaboration of the events surrounding her birth – in this case to [[Ravana]]'s wife, [[Mandodari]] as well as her conquest of Ravana's older brother in the [[Mahakali]] form.

====Early references in Tamil literature====
{{main|Ramayana in Tamil literature}}
Even before [[Kambar (poet)|Kambar]] wrote the [[Ramavataram]] in Tamil in the 12th century AD, there are many ancient references to the story of Ramayana, implying that the story was familiar in the Tamil lands even before the Common Era. References to the story can be found in the [[Sangam literature]] of [[Akanaṉūṟu]],(dated 400BC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dakshinamurthy |first1=A |title=Akananuru: Neytal – Poem 70 |url=https://adakshinamurthy.wordpress.com/2015/07/01/akananuru-neythal-poem-70/ |website=Akananuru |accessdate=22 July 2019|date=July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Purananuru]] (dated 300 BC),&lt;ref name=&quot;Hart&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hart |first1=George L |last2=Heifetz |first2=Hank |title=The four hundred songs of war and wisdom : an anthology of poems from classical Tamil : the Puṟanāṉūṟu |url=https://archive.org/details/fourhundredsongs00 |url-access=registration |date=1999 |publisher=Columbia University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Kalakam |editor1-first=Turaicămip Pillai |title=Purananuru |date=1950 |location=Madras}}&lt;/ref&gt; the twin epics of [[Silappatikaram]] (dated 2nd Century CE)&lt;ref name=&quot;VRRDikshitar&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dikshitar |first1=V R Ramachandra |title=The Silappadikaram |date=1939 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Madras, British India |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.201802/page/n5 |accessdate=22 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Manimekalai]] (cantos 5, 17 and 18),&lt;ref name=&quot;PPP&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pandian |first1=Pichai Pillai |title=Cattanar's Manimekalai |date=1931 |publisher=Saiva Siddhanta Works |location=Madras |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.65472 |accessdate=30 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RBKA&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aiyangar |first1=Rao Bahadur Krishnaswami |title=Manimekhalai In Its Historical Setting |date=1927 |publisher=Luzac &amp; Co. |location=London |url=https://archive.org/details/manimekhalaiinit031176mbp |accessdate=30 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniélou&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shattan |first1=Merchant-Prince |editor1-last=Daniélou |editor1-first=Alain |title=Manimekhalai: The Dancer With the Magic Bowl |date=1989 |publisher=New Directions |location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Alvars|Alvar]] literature of [[Kulasekhara Alvar]], [[Thirumangai Alvar]], [[Andal]] and [[Nammalvar]] (dated between 5th and 10th Centuries CE).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hooper&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hooper |first1=John Stirling Morley |title=Hymns of the Alvars |date=1929 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Calcutta |url=https://archive.org/details/hymnsofthealvars020204mbp |accessdate=30 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the songs of the Nayanmars have references to Ravana and his devotion to Lord Siva.

====Buddhist version====

In the Buddhist variant of the ''Ramayana'' ([[Dasharatha Jataka]]), Dasharatha was king of [[Benares]] and not Ayodhya. Rama (called Rāmapaṇḍita in this version) was the son of Kaushalya, first wife of Dasharatha. Lakṣmaṇa (Lakkhaṇa) was a sibling of Rama and son of Sumitra, the second wife of Dasharatha.  Sita was the wife of Rama. To protect his children from his wife Kaikeyi, who wished to promote her son Bharata, Dasharatha sent the three to a hermitage in the Himalayas for a twelve-year exile. After nine years, Dasharatha died and Lakkhaṇa and Sita returned; Rāmapaṇḍita, in deference to his father's wishes, remained in exile for a further two years. This version does not include the abduction of Sītā.There is no Ravan in this version i.e. no Ram-ravan war.

In the explanatory commentary on Jātaka, Rāmapaṇḍita is said to have been a previous incarnation of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], and Sita an incarnation of [[Yasodharā]].

But, [[Ravana]] appears in other Buddhist literature, the [[Lankavatara Sutra]].

====Jain version====

{{main|Rama in Jainism|Salakapurusa}}
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
[[Jain]] versions of the ''Ramayana'' can be found in the various [[Jain agama (disambiguation)|Jain agama]]s like Ravisena's [[Padma Purana|Padmapurana]] (story of Padmaja and [[Rama]], Padmaja being the name of [[Sita]]), [[Hemacandra]]'s [[Salakapurusa|Trisastisalakapurusa charitra]] (hagiography of 63 illustrious persons), Sanghadasa's ''Vasudevahindi'' and ''Uttarapurana'' by Gunabhadara. According to [[Jain cosmology]], every [[Kalachakra (Jainism)|half time cycle]] has nine sets of [[Balarama]], [[Vasudeva]] and prativasudeva. Rama, [[Lakshmana]] and [[Ravana]] are the eighth Baldeva, Vasudeva and [[prativasudeva]] respectively. [[Padmanabh Jaini]] notes that, unlike in the Hindu Puranas, the names Baladeva and Vasudeva are not restricted to [[Balarama]] and [[Krishna]] in Jain Puranas. Instead they serve as names of two distinct classes of mighty brothers, who appear nine times in each half time cycle and jointly rule half the earth as half-[[chakravartin]]s. Jaini traces the origin of this list of brothers to the ''jinacharitra'' (lives of jinas) by [[Acharya Bhadrabahu]] (3d–4th century BCE).

In the Jain epic of ''Ramayana'', it is not Rama who kills Ravana as told in the Hindu version. Perhaps this is because Rama, a liberated Jain Soul in his last life, is unwilling to kill.&lt;ref name=&quot;A.K&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ramanujan|first1=A.K|title=The Collected Essays of A.K. Ramanujan|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New Delhi|page=145|edition=4. impr.|url=http://www.trans-techresearch.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/three-hundred-Ramayanas-A-K-Ramanujan.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it is Lakshmana who kills Ravana (as Vasudeva killes Prativasudeva).&lt;ref name=&quot;A.K&quot;/&gt; In the end, Rama, who led an upright life, renounces his kingdom, becomes a [[Jain monasticism|Jain monk]] and attains [[Moksa (Jainism)|moksha]]. On the other hand, Lakshmana and Ravana go to [[Naraka (Jainism)|Hell]]. However, it is predicted that ultimately they both will be reborn as upright persons and attain liberation in their future births. According to [[Jain texts]], Ravana will be the future [[Tirthankara]] (omniscient teacher) of Jainism.

The Jain versions have some variations from Valmiki's ''Ramayana''. Dasharatha, the king of Ayodhya had four queens: Aparajita, Sumitra, Suprabha and Kaikeyi. These four queens had four sons. Aparajita's son was Padma and he became known by the name of Rama. Sumitra's son was Narayana: he came to be known by another name, Lakshmana. Kaikeyi's son was Bharata and Suprabha's son was Shatrughna. Furthermore, not much was thought of Ram's fidelity to Sita. According to the Jain version, Rama had four chief queens: Maithili, Prabhavati, Ratinibha, and Sridama. Furthermore, Sita takes renunciation as a Jain ascetic after Rama abandons her and is reborn in heaven as Indra. Rama, after Lakshman's death, also renounces his kingdom and becomes a Jain monk. Ultimately, he attains [[Kevala Jnana]] omniscience and finally liberation. Rama predicts that Ravana and Lakshmana, who were in the [[Naraka (Jainism)|fourth hell]], will attain liberation in their future births. Accordingly, Ravana is the future Tirthankara of the next half ascending time cycle and Sita will be his [[Ganadhara]].

====Sikh version====

In [[Guru Granth Sahib]], there is a description of two types of ''Ramayana''. One is a spiritual ''Ramayana'' which is the actual subject of Guru Granth Sahib, in which Ravana is ego, Sita is ''budhi'' (intellect), Rama is inner soul and Laxman is ''mann'' (attention, mind). Guru Granth Sahib also believes in the existence of [[Dashavatara]] who were kings of their times which tried their best to restore order to the world. King Rama (Ramchandra) was one of those who is not covered in Guru Granth Sahib. Guru Granth Sahib states:
:ਹੁਕਮਿ ਉਪਾਏ ਦਸ ਅਉਤਾਰਾ॥
:हुकमि उपाए दस अउतारा॥
:By [[hukam]] (supreme command), he created his ten incarnations
Rather there is no Ramayana written by any Guru. Guru Gobind Singh however is known to have written Ram Avatar in a text which is highly debated on its authenticity. Guru Gobind Singh clearly states that though all the 24 avatars incarnated for the betterment of the world, but fell prey to ego and therefore were destroyed by the supreme creator. 

He also said that the almighty, invisible, all prevailing God created great numbers of Indras, Moons and Suns, Deities, Demons and sages, and also numerous saints and Brahmanas (enlightened people). But they too were caught in the noose of death (Kaal) ([[transmigration of the soul]]).

===Nepal===

Besides being the site of discovery of the oldest surviving manuscript of the ''Ramayana'', Nepal gave rise to two regional variants in mid 19th – early 20th century. One, written by [[Bhanubhakta Acharya]], is considered the first epic of [[Nepali language]], while the other, written by [[Siddhidas Mahaju]] in [[Nepal Bhasa]] was a foundational influence in the [[Nepal Bhasa renaissance]].

[[Bhanubhakta Ramayana|Ramayana]] written by [[Bhanubhakta Acharya]] is one of the most popular verses in Nepal. The popularization of the ''Ramayana'' and its tale, originally written in [[Sanskrit Language]] was greatly enhanced by the work of Bhanubhakta. Mainly because of his writing of Nepali Ramayana, Bhanubhakta is also called ''Aadi Kavi'' or ''The Pioneering Poet''.

====Cambodia====

[[File:Sita Ravana Cambodia.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cambodian classical dancers as Sita and Ravana, the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh (c. 1920s)]]
The Cambodian version of the ''Ramayana'', [[Reamker]] ({{lang-km|រាមកេរ្ដិ៍}} - ''Glory of Rama''), is the most famous story of Khmer literature since the [[Kingdom of Funan]] era. It adapts the Hindu concepts to Buddhist themes and shows the balance of good and evil in the world. The Reamker has several differences from the original ''Ramayana'', including scenes not included in the original and emphasis on [[Hanuman]] and [[Sovanna Maccha]], a retelling which influences the Thai and Lao versions. Reamker in Cambodia is not confined to the realm of literature but extends to all Cambodian art forms, such as sculpture, [[Khmer classical dance]], [[Theatre of Cambodia|theatre]] known as ''lakhorn luang'' (the foundation of the royal ballet), poetry and the mural and bas-reliefs seen at the [[Silver Pagoda]] and [[Angkor Wat]].

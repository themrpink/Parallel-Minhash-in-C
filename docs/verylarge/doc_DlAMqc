Highdown is the only 5th-century Saxon cemetery found outside the Ouse/Cuckmere area, and is 2&amp;nbsp;km from a hoard of Roman gold and silver that was found in 1997.&lt;ref name=white28&gt;Sally White.

The Patching hoard published in Medieval Archaeology. pp. 88-93&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of hoards in Britain#patching|Patching hoard]], as it came to be known, contained a coin as recent as 461 AD. Thus, Highdown cemetery would have been in use by Saxons when the hoard was buried at Patching.&lt;ref name=&quot;white88&quot;/&gt; The settlement that used Highdown as a burial ground in the 5th century has never been identified, but White speculates that there may have been some link between Patching and Highdown, and Welch has suggested that a Romano-British community was based there and that they controlled a group of Saxon mercenaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;brandon23&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;white88&quot;/&gt;

Despite the difficulties presented by the large forest tract of the Weald that separated Sussex from Surrey, similarities in the archaeological record from this period between Sussex and Surrey help to substantiate the claim of Ælle of Sussex to be the first ''[[Bretwalda]]'' in the [[Thames Valley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Loyn 1991 37&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Loyn|1991| p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such unified regional commands were probably not long-lasting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Loyn 1991 37&quot;/&gt; Archaeological evidence in the form of distinctive Saxon saucer brooches suggests that Ælle's forces penetrated far to the north, perhaps as far as modern [[Gloucestershire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanities360.com/index.php/the-saxon-king-aelle-34964/ |title=The Saxon King Aelle |publisher=Humanities360.com |first=Mark |last=Hopkins |date=23 September 2009 |accessdate=13 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213235332/http://www.humanities360.com/index.php/the-saxon-king-aelle-34964/ |archivedate=13 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[H.R.

===Christianisation and loss of independence (600–860)===
After 491 the written history of Sussex goes blank until 607, when the annals report that [[Ceolwulf of Wessex]] fought against the South Saxons.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASC607&quot;&gt;ASC Parker MS. AD607.&lt;/ref&gt; Threatened by Wessex, the South Saxons sought to secure their independence by alliance with Mercia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fisher|2014| p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the South Saxons, the more distant influence and control of a king from Mercia is likely to have been preferable to that of the West Saxons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brandon 1978 32&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Brandon|1978| p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alliance between Mercia and the South Saxons was further sealed by [[Aethelwalh of Sussex|Æðelwealh]], king of Sussex, receiving baptism into the Christian church through the Mercian court, with [[Wulfhere of Mercia|Wulfhere]] acting as his sponsor, making Æðelwealh Sussex's first Christian king. Wulfhere gave Æðelwealh the [[Isle of Wight]] and the territory of the ''[[Meonwara]]'' (the [[River Meon|Meon]] valley of present-day Hampshire).&lt;ref name=&quot;bede225&quot;/&gt; Æðelwealh also married Eabe, a princess of the ''[[Hwicce]]'', a Mercian satellite province.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yorke|1995| p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Barnard Chichester mural.png|thumb|16th-century Barnardi picture of Cædwalla granting lands to Wilfrid.]]

In 681, the exiled [[Wilfrid|St Wilfrid of Northumbria]] arrived in the kingdom of the South Saxons and remained there for five years evangelising and baptising the people.&lt;ref name=&quot;bede225&quot;&gt;Bede.HE.IV.13&lt;/ref&gt; There had been a famine in the land of the South Saxons when Wilfrid arrived.&lt;ref name=&quot;bede225&quot;/&gt; Wilfrid taught the locals to fish, and they were impressed with Wilfrid's teachings and agreed to be baptised ''en masse''.&lt;ref name=&quot;bede225&quot;/&gt; On the day of the baptisms the rain fell on the &quot;thirsty earth&quot;, so ending the famine.&lt;ref name=&quot;bede225&quot;/&gt; Æðelwealh gave 87 [[Hide (unit)|hides]] (an area of land) and a [[royal vill]] to Wilfrid to enable him to found [[Selsey Abbey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bede225&quot;/&gt; The abbey eventually became the seat of the [[Bishop of Selsey|South Saxon bishopric]], where it remained until after the [[Norman Conquest]], when it was moved to [[Bishop of Chichester|Chichester]] by decree of the [[Council of London (1075)|Council of London of 1075]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bede225&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kelly1&quot;&gt;Kelly.Chichester Cathedral:The Bishopric of Selsey. p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the arrival of St Wilfrid, the kingdom was ravaged with &quot;fierce slaughter and devastation&quot; and Æðelwealh was slain by an exiled West Saxon prince [[Cædwalla of Wessex|Cædwalla]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bede230&quot;&gt;Bede.HE.IV.15&lt;/ref&gt; The latter was eventually expelled, by Æðelwealh's successors, two Ealdormen named [[Berthun of Sussex|Berhthun]] and [[Andhun]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bede230&quot;/&gt; In 686 the South Saxons attacked [[Hlothhere]], king of [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], in support of his nephew [[Eadric of Kent|Eadric]], who afterwards became king of Kent. At this time, a new South Saxon hegemony extending from the Isle of Wight into Kent could conceivably have seen Sussex re-emerge as a regional power but the revival of Wessex ended this possibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby114&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kirby|2000| p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Venning45-46&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Venning|2013|pp=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eadric's rule in Kent lasted until Kent was invaded by Cædwalla who had managed to establish himself as ruler of Wessex. With his additional resources, Cædwalla once more invaded Sussex, killing Berhthun.&lt;ref name=&quot;KellyODNB&quot;/&gt; Sussex now became for some years subject to a period of harsh West Saxon domination.&lt;ref name=&quot;KellyODNB&quot;/&gt; According to [[Bede]], the subjection reduced the kingdom of Sussex to &quot;a worse state of slavery&quot;; it also included placing the South Saxon clergy under the authority of Wessex through the [[bishop of Winchester|bishops of Winchester]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brandon 1978 32&quot;/&gt; Cædwalla also seized the Isle of Wight where he ruthlessly exterminated its population, including its royal line. According to John Hinds, Cædwalla's savage behaviour towards Sussex and the Isle of Wight can be explained by Sussex's westward expansion with assistance from Mercia at the expense of Wessex and Cædwalla was determined that this should never happen again.&lt;ref name=&quot;HinesAS&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Hinds |first=John |title=The Anglo-Saxons from the Migration Period to the Eighth Century: An Ethnographic Perspective |year=1997 |publisher=Boydell Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the later South Saxon kings we have little knowledge except from occasional [[Anglo-Saxon charters|charters]]. In 692 a grant is made by a king called [[Nothelm of Sussex|Noðhelm]] (or ''Nunna'') to his sister, which is witnessed by another king called [[Watt of Sussex|Watt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&amp;query=S+45 |title=S 45 |publisher=Anglo-Saxons.net |accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a theory that Watt may have been a sub-king who ruled over a tribe of people centred around modern day Hastings, known as the ''[[Haestingas]]'' and Nunna is described, in the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', as the kinsman of [[Ine of Wessex]] who fought with him against [[Geraint of Dumnonia|Geraint]], King of the Britons, in 710.&lt;ref name=brandon23 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;asc710&quot;&gt;ASC Parker MS AD 710&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bede, Sussex was subject to Ine for a number of years&lt;ref name=&quot;HE415&quot;&gt;HE.VI.15.&lt;/ref&gt; and like Cædwalla, Ine also oppressed the people of Sussex in the same harsh way for many years.&lt;ref name=&quot;HE415&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sawyer 1978 43&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sawyer|1978| p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 710 Sussex was still under West Saxon domination when King Nothhelm of Sussex is recorded as having campaigned with Ine in the west against Dumnonia. Sussex evidently broke away from West Saxon domination some time before 722 when Ine is recorded as invading Sussex, which he repeated three years later, killing a West Saxon exile named Ealdberht who had fled to the Weald of Sussex and Surrey&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Swanton|1996| p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appears to have attempted to find support in Sussex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sawyer 1978 43&quot;/&gt; The ''Anglo Saxon Chronicle'' records a further campaign against the South Saxons by the West Saxons in 725.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brandon 1978 32&quot;/&gt;

According to a charter dated 775, the former [[Selsey Abbey|abbot of Selsey]], Bishop [[Eadberht of Selsey]] ({{Circa|705}} x?709)&amp;nbsp;– (716 x?), was given a grant of land by King [[Nothhelm of Sussex|Nunna]]; the document included King [[Watt of Sussex|Watt]] as a witness. However, the charter is now believed to have been a 10th- or early-11th-century forgery.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly. ''Charters of Selsey''. p.26. W. de Gray Birch had suggested an emendation (of the date) to 725 but Kelly says ''this is still unsatisfactory since it is too late for Bishop Eadberht''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eadberht1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=182-cap&amp;cid=1-17-1#1-17-1|title=Cap.

There is another charter, that is thought to be genuine, that records a series of transactions of a piece of land near modern-day [[Burpham]] in the [[River Arun|Arun Valley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kelly34&quot;&gt;Kelly. Charters of Selsey. p.34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&amp;query=S+44 |title=S 44 |publisher=Anglo-Saxons.net |accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It starts off with a grant of land, at Peppering, by Nunna to Berhfrith probably for the foundation of a minster.&lt;ref name=&quot;kelly31&quot;&gt;Kelly. Charters of Selsey. p.31&lt;/ref&gt;
Berhfrith transferred the land to Eolla, who in turn sold it to Wulfhere. The land then went to Beoba who passed it on to Beorra and Ecca.&lt;ref name=&quot;kelly31&quot;/&gt; Finally King Osmund bought the land from his [[comes]] Erra and granted it to a religious woman known as Tidburgh.&lt;ref name=&quot;kelly31&quot;/&gt; The charter is undated but it has been possible to date the various transactions approximately, by cross referencing people who appear both on this charter and on other charters that ''do'' provide dates.&lt;ref name=&quot;kelly31&quot;/&gt; On the transaction, where Eolla has acquired the land from Berhfrith and sells it to Wulfhere [{{Circa|AD 705}} x (716x?)], Nunna's subscription is followed by a certain [[Osric of Sussex|Osric]] who was possibly Nunna's co-ruler.&lt;ref name=&quot;kelly33&quot;&gt;Kelly. Charters of Selsey. p.33&lt;/ref&gt; The other witnesses who followed Osric were Eadberht and Eolla, both who can be identified as ecclesiastics.&lt;ref name=&quot;kelly33&quot;/&gt;

Nunna's last surviving charter, which is dated 714 in error for 717,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&amp;query=S+42 |title=S 42 |publisher=Anglo-Saxons.net |accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is witnessed by a King [[Aethelstan of Sussex|Æðelstan]].

A little later, [[Aethelbert of Sussex|Æðelberht]] was King of Sussex, but he is known only from charters. The dates of Æðelberht's reign are unknown beyond the fact that he was a contemporary of [[Sigeferth of Selsey|Sigeferth]], Bishop of Selsey from 733, as Sigeferth witnessed an undated charter of Æðelberht&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&amp;query=S+46 |title=S 46 |publisher=Anglo-Saxons.net |accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Æðelberht is styled Ethelbertus rex Sussaxonum.

After this we hear nothing more until about 765, when a grant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&amp;query=S+50 |title=S 50 |publisher=Anglo-Saxons.net |accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; of land is made by a king named [[Ealdwulf of Sussex|Ealdwulf]], with two other kings, [[Aelfwald of Sussex|Ælfwald]] and [[Oslac of Sussex|Oslac]], as witnesses.

In 765&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&amp;query=S+48 |title=S 48 |publisher=Anglo-Saxons.net |accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 770&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&amp;query=S+49 |title=S 49 |publisher=Anglo-Saxons.net |accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; grants are made by a King [[Osmund of Sussex|Osmund]], the latter one was later confirmed by [[Offa of Mercia]].

The independent existence of the Kingdom of Sussex came to an end in the early 770s.&lt;ref name=&quot;KellyODNB&quot;/&gt; In 771, King Offa of Mercia conquered the territory of the ''Haestingas''; he may have entered Sussex from the Kingdom of Kent, where he was already dominant.&lt;ref name=&quot;KellyODNB&quot;/&gt; By 772 he apparently controlled the whole of the Kingdom of Sussex.&lt;ref name=&quot;KellyODNB&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Kelly |first=S.E. |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=52344&amp;back= |title=S. E. Kelly, 'Kings of the South Saxons (act. 477–772)'in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Offa also confirmed two charters of [[Aethelbert of Sussex|Æðelberht]], and in 772&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&amp;query=S+108 |title=S 108 |publisher=Anglo-Saxons.net |accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; he grants land himself in Sussex, with [[Oswald of Sussex|Oswald]], ''dux Suðsax'', as a witness. It is probable that about this time Offa annexed the kingdom of Sussex, as several persons, [[Osmund of Sussex|Osmund]], [[Aelfwald of Sussex|Ælfwald]] and [[Oslac of Sussex|Oslac]], who had previously used the royal title, now sign with that of ''dux''.

Offa may not have been able to maintain control in the period 776–785 but he appears to have re-established control afterwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wil&quot;/&gt; Mercian power collapsed in the years following Offa's death in 796, and the South Saxons re-emerged as an independent political entity.

After the [[Battle of Ellandun]] in 825&lt;ref name=&quot;Wil&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England Appendix I |type=PDF |first=Simon |last=Keynes |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |doi=10.1002/9781118316061.app1 |journal=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England |pages=521–538|year = 2013|isbn = 9781118316061}}&lt;/ref&gt; the South Saxons submitted to [[Egbert of Wessex|Ecgberht of Wessex]], and from this time they remained subject to the West Saxon dynasty. According to Heather Edwards in the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', it is probable that Sussex was not annexed by Wessex until 827.&lt;ref name=&quot;EcgODNB&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/8581 |last=Edwards |first=Heather |title=Ecgberht [Egbert] (d. 839), king of the West Saxons |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earldom of Sussex seems later to have been sometimes combined with that of Kent. [[Æthelberht of Wessex]] was ruling Sussex and the other south-eastern kingdoms by 855, and succeeded to the kingship of Wessex on the death of his brother, King [[Æthelbald of Wessex|Æthelbald]], thus bringing Sussex fully under the crown of Wessex.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yorke|2002| p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ealdormanry and shire (860–1066)===
From 895 Sussex suffered from constant raids by the [[Vikings|Danes]], till the accession of [[Canute]], after which arose the two great forces of the house of [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex|Godwine]] and of the [[Normans]]. Godwine was probably a native of Sussex, and by the end of [[Edward the Confessor]]'s reign a third part of the county was in the hands of his family.

It is thought that the ''Æellingi'' (the South Saxon royal house) continued to govern Sussex as ''eorldermen'' (earls) under West Saxon sovereignty until the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066.

The death of [[eadwine of Sussex|Eadwine]], Ealdorman of Sussex, is recorded in 982, because he was buried at [[Abingdon Abbey]] in Berkshire, where one version of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' was compiled. According to the abbey's records, in which he was called ''princeps Australium Saxonum, Eadwinus nomine'' (Eadwine leader of the South Saxons), he bequeathed estates to them in his will, although the document itself has not survived.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly.Charters of Abingdon Abbey, Volume 2. p.581.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in the same year he witnessed a charter of King [[Ethelred the Unready]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&amp;query=S+839 |title=S 839 |publisher=Anglo-Saxons.net |accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as ''Eaduuine dux''. His name was also added to a forged charter dated 956 (possibly an error for 976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&amp;query=S+828 |title=S 828 |publisher=Anglo-Saxons.net |accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BayeuxTapestryScene02-03.jpg|right|thumb|600px|[[Harold Godwinson]], the future king of England, shown on the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] riding with his knights to [[Bosham]] from where he set sail in 1064.]]

In the next generation, [[Wulfnoth Cild]], Thegn of Sussex, played a prominent part in English politics. In 1009 his actions resulted in the destruction of the English fleet, and by 1011 Sussex, together with most of South East England, was in the hands of the Danes. In an early example of local government reform, the Anglo-Saxon ealdormanries were abolished by the Danish kings and replaced with a smaller number of larger earldoms. Wulfnoth Cild was the father of [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex|Godwin]], who was made Earl of Wessex in 1020. His earldom included Sussex. When he died in 1053, Godwin was succeeded as Earl of Wessex (including Sussex) by his son [[Harold Godwinson|Harold]], who had previously been Earl of East Anglia.

[[Edward the Confessor]], who had spent much of his early life in exile in Normandy, was pro-Norman and in Sussex gave to the abbot of [[Fécamp Abbey]] the minster church at Steyning, as well as confirming land existing land grants at Hastings, Rye and Winchelsea.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lowerson|1980| p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; To his chaplain, [[Osbern FitzOsbern|Osborn]], later William's Bishop of Exeter, Edward gave the harbour and other land at [[Bosham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1971|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Saxon nobles grew jealous and from 1049 there was conflict between the disgruntled Saxon nobility, the king and the incoming Normans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong 1971 44&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1971| p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Godwine and his second son Harold kept the peace off the Sussex coast by using Bosham and Pevensey to drive away pirates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong 1971 44&quot;/&gt; In 1049 the murder by [[Sweyn Godwinson]] of his cousin Beorn after Beorn has been tricked in going to Bosham resulted in the entire [[House of Godwin|Godwine family]] being banished.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong 1971 44&quot;/&gt; It was from Bosham in 1051 that Godwin, Sweyn and [[Tostig Godwinson|Tostig]] fled to [[Bruges]] and the court of [[Baldwin V, Count of Flanders]], a relative of Tostig's wife, [[Judith of Flanders, Countess of Northumbria|Judith of Flanders]].&lt;ref name=&quot;harvnb|Phillips|Smith|2014&quot;/&gt; When they returned in 1052 to an enthusiastic welcome in the Sussex ports, Edward had to reinstate the Godwine family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong 1971 44&quot;/&gt;

In 1064 Harold sailed from Bosham, from where a storm cast him up in Normandy. Here he was apparently tricked into pledging his support for William of Normandy as the next king of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1971| p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 October 1066, Harold II, the last Saxon king of England was killed at the [[Battle of Hastings]] and the English army defeated, by [[William the Conqueror]] and his army.&lt;ref name=&quot;seward5&quot;&gt;Seward. Sussex. pp. 5-7.&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that all the fighting men of Sussex were at the battle, as the county's [[thegns]] were decimated and any that survived had their lands confiscated.&lt;ref name=&quot;seward5&quot;/&gt; At least 353 of the 387 manors, in the county, were taken from their Saxon owners and given to the victorious Normans by the Conqueror, and Saxon power in Sussex was at an end.&lt;ref name=horsfield77&gt;Horsfield. Sussex. Volume 1. pp. 77-78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and society==

===Defence and warfare===
The earliest recorded Viking raid on Sussex took place in 895&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowerson 1980 43&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Lowerson|1980| p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was particularly difficult for a scattered farming community to meet these sudden attacks. In 895 the population of Chichester killed many hundreds of Danes who plundered the area. Eadulf, a Saxon noble, was appointed to organise the defence of Sussex but died from the plague before much could be done.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowerson 1980 43&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Southern edge of Burpham Saxon Burgh - geograph.org.uk - 1028951.jpg|thumb|Remains of the burh wall at Burpham]]

[[Alfred the Great]] almost certainly inaugurated the building of a series of ''[[burh]]s'' or forts to be garrisoned at the threat of danger by men drawn from the surrounding population. The development of the burhs across the southern half of England suggests a considerable awareness of a repeated problem&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowerson 1980 43&quot;/&gt; The [[Burghal Hidage]] documents five such fortifications in Sussex&amp;nbsp;— at [[Chichester]], [[Burpham]], Lewes, Hastings and ''[[Eorpeburnan]]''.

In the reign of [[Æthelred the Unready]], the threat of the Danes continued&amp;nbsp;— in 994 and 1000 the ''Anglo Saxon Chronicle'' records burning, plundering and manslaughter on the coast of Sussex and neighbouring counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1971| p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most serious attacks took place in 1009, when a Viking army took up position over the winter period on the Isle of Wight and ravaged Sussex, Hampshire and Berkshire.

The rectilinear street plan of Chichester is typical of the towns which developed from the fortified ''burhs'', which had intramural streets running around the town walls; this allowed garrison troops to defend the town and large peripheral blocks that were left as hedged areas (''hagae'') into which fugitives from the countryside could flee.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvnb|Phillips|Smith|2014&quot;/&gt;

===Economy===
[[File:Holloway, Chanctonbury Ring Road - geograph.org.uk - 149405.jpg|thumb|[[Droveway]]s such as this one near [[Chanctonbury Ring]] were used throughout the Saxon period to transport pigs and cattle between coastal areas and summer pasture in the Weald]]

Deposited around {{Circa|470}} as the kingdom of Sussex was being established, the [[Patching]] hoard of coins represents the earliest early mediaeval coins found in Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Higham 2013 51&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Higham|Ryan|2013| p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hoard includes five imported ''[[siliqua]]e'' that had not been clipped, so coin-clipping had probably ceased by then, although the coinage had probably collapsed decades earlier than this, after Roman rule in Britain collapsed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Higham 2013 51&quot;/&gt;

In the first quarter of the 8th century the Kingdom of Sussex was among the kingdoms producing coinage, possibly from a mint near Selsey where the finds of coins termed Series G ''[[sceatta]]s'' are concentrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Drewett|Rudling|Gardiner|1998| p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That a cash economy had returned by the 10th century is suggested by the various mints which became increasingly plentiful after [[Æthelstan|King Æthelstan]] reorganised England's coinage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brandon 2006 776–77&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Brandon|2006| pp=776–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were mints at Chichester, Lewes and Steyning. A new mint also seems to have existed on a temporary basis in the Iron Age hillfort at [[Cissbury]], which may have been refortified as a refuge during the Danish invasions in the reign of [[Æthelred the Unready]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brandon 2006 776–77&quot;/&gt; The Cissbury mint seems to have worked in close association with the mint at Chichester rather than replacing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Higham|Ryan|2013| pp=346–347}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the eve of the Norman conquest, there were further mints at Arundel, Pevensey and Hastings.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvnb|Phillips|Smith|2014&quot;/&gt;

Lewes seems to have prospered with overseas trade; coins from Lewes stamped 'LAE URB' travelled as far as Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brandon 2006 776–77&quot;/&gt; The substantial sea-faring trade of Lewes is indicated by the payment of 20 [[shilling]]s for munitions of war payable whenever [[Edward the Confessor]]'s fleet put to sea. This is the probable origin of the [[Cinque Ports]] organisation that flourished under the Normans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brandon|2006| pp=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The River Ouse would have been navigable at least as far north as Lewes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong 1971 41&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1971| p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong argues that while Sussex was separated from much else of mainstream English experience, this should not hide the rich trade that Sussex had with other parts of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lowerson|1980| p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1060s Lewes also supported a cattle market.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong 1971 41&quot;/&gt;

By the end of the Anglo Saxon period and the [[Domesday Book|Domesday Survey]] by the Normans in 1086, Sussex contained some of the richest and most heavily populated pockets of England on the coastal plain, albeit alongside some of England's most economically underdeveloped areas in the Weald.&lt;ref name=&quot;HamGT&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-285-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_139/04_thomas.pdf |last=Thomas |first=Gabor |title=Hamsey, near Lewes, East Sussex=The Implications of Recent Finds of Late Anglo-Saxon Metalwork For Its Importance In The Pre-Conquest Period |publisher=Sussex Archaeological Collections 139 |year=2001 |page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, Sussex had a network of urban centres such that farmers were within 15&amp;nbsp;km to 30&amp;nbsp;km of market facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Higham|Ryan|2013| p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agriculture seems to have flourished on the Sussex coastal plain and on the Sussex Downs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brandon|2006| pp=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the Sussex coast appears to have been relatively densely settled for centuries implies that the land was being more competently farmed than was typical of the standard of the day.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvnb|Phillips|Smith|2014&quot;/&gt; The Weald was pig-fattening and cattle-grazing country. Drovers would divide their year between their 'winter house' in their parent village outside the Weald and their 'summer house' in the outlying woodland pasture up to {{convert|20|mi|-1}} away. Surviving features include a close network of former droveways and surviving fragments of wood pasture, such as the Mens and Ebernoe Common near [[Petworth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;harvnb|Phillips|Smith|2014&quot;/&gt;

The Domesday Book records that by the 11th century, the unknown Rameslie in Sussex had 100 [[Saltern|salt pans]] to extract salt from sea water.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Loyn|1991| p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisheries were also important to the economy of Sussex. Lewes was an important centre of a herring industry&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Loyn|1991| p=374}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had to pay a rent of 38,500 herrings for its sea fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Loyn|1991| p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kingship===
{{See also|List of monarchs of Sussex}}
The South Saxon kingdom remains one of the most obscure of the Anglo-Saxon polities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Semple 2013 25&quot;/&gt; A few names of South Saxon kings are recorded, and the history of the kingdom is sometimes illustrated by that of other areas, but information is otherwise limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yorke|2002| p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sussex seems to have had a greater degree of decentralisation than other kingdoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Semple 2013 25&quot;/&gt; For a period during the 760s there may have been as many as four or five kings based within the territory, perhaps with each ruling over a distinct tribal territory,&lt;ref name=&quot;SERF&quot;/&gt; perhaps on a temporary basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lapidge 2013 p&quot;/&gt; It seems possible that the people of the ''Haestingas'' may have had their own ruler for a while, and another sub-division may have been along the River Adur.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lapidge 2013 p&quot;/&gt;

Complex tiers of relationships between kings and kingdoms existed. For instance in the 7th century, when Wulfhere of Mercia was trying to increase his influence over the South Saxons, he ceded control of the provinces of the ''Meonwara'' and Wight to the South Saxon king Æðelwealh. Wight at least had its own ruler, Arvald, who presumably recognised the authority of the South Saxon king, Æðelwealh, and who in turn recognised the overlordship of the Mercian king, Wulfhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yorke|2002| p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kingdom of Sussex was an independent unit until the reign of [[Offa of Mercia]]. Under Offa, who ruled over most of the kingdoms of the heptarchy, local South Saxon rulers were allowed to continue provided that they recognised Offa's overriding authority and some estates seem to have come into his direct possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yorke|2002| p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 9th century, Sussex was ruled by the West Saxons. It would appear that the ultimate intention of [[Æthelwulf of Wessex]] was for the kingdom of Wessex and the eastern regions of Sussex, Surrey, Kent and Essex to become separate kingdoms, with separate but related royal dynasties. It was only the early deaths of Aethelwulf's first two sons that allowed [[Æthelbert of Wessex]], his third son, to reunite Wessex and the eastern regions, including Sussex, into a single kingdom in 860.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby 2000 169&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kirby|2000| p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred only after Athelberht had secured the consent of his younger brothers, Aethelred and Alfred. Though in part due to the careful cultivation of conquered regions, the establishment of an enduring 'Greater Wessex' stretching along the southern coast owed much to chance, early deaths, and perhaps, to the growing recognition of the need for unity in the face of an increasing Viking threat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Higham 2013 245&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Higham|Ryan|2013| p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sussex was never again treated as part of an eastern subkingdom but was not closely integrated with the old West Saxon provinces either. Sussex seems to have had its own ealdorman for much of the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yorke|1995| p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Royal tributes and dues were often collected at settlements known as king's tuns, often a separate place from where the royal hall of that the king would stay when in the area. Sussex has several places that are king's tuns including from west to east, [[Kingston by Ferring]], [[Kingston by Sea]], now part of Shoreham-by-Sea, and [[Kingston near Lewes]]. King's tuns in Anglo-Saxon England often acted as places of assembly, where the king could settle disputes or hear appeals.&lt;ref name=&quot;ULeic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.le.ac.uk/users/grj1/asl.html |first=Graham |last=Jones |publisher=University of Leicester |title=Anglo-Saxon England. Settlement - rural and town life |accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Æthelstan, the first king of England, his grandmother [[Ælfthryth, wife of Edgar|Ælfthryth]] had the use of an estate at ''Æthelingadene'' ([[East Dean, West Sussex|East]] and [[West Dean, West Sussex|West Dean]] near Chichester). Ælfthryth may have brought up her grandchildren, the sons of Æthelred of Wessex, at ''Æthelingadene'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Lapidge 2013 p&quot;/&gt; which may have been one of the estates set aside for the benefit of the royal princes or [[Ætheling]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2003| p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law===
Various [[folkmoot]]s would have been held in Sussex, for instance at [[Ditchling]],&lt;ref name=&quot;DitEUS&quot;/&gt; Tinhale (in [[Bersted]]) and [[Madehurst]]. Placename evidence for early assemblies in Sussex comes from Tinhale (from the Old English ''þing'' (thing) meaning hold a meeting, so 'meeting-hill') and [[Madehurst]] (from the Old English ''maedel'' meaning assembly, so 'assembly wooded hill').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Semple|2013| p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a location in [[Durrington, West Sussex|Durrington]] that had the name ''gemot biorh'' meaning a moot barrow or meeting barrow, a boundary barrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Semple|2013| p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early hundreds often lacked the formality of later attempts of local government: frequently they met in the open, at a convenient central spot, perhaps marked by a tree, as at [[Easebourne]]. Dill, meaning the boarded meeting place, was one of the few hundreds in Sussex that provided any accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lowerson|1980| pp=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 10th century onwards the hundred became important as a court of justice as well as dealing with matters of local administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong 1971 39&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1971| pp=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting place was often a point within the hundred such as a bridge (as in the bridge over the [[River Rother, West Sussex|western River Rother]] in Rotherbridge hundred) or a notable tree (such as a tree called Tippa's Oak in Tipnoak hundred).&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong 1971 39&quot;/&gt;

It is also recorded that an England-wide Royal Council (''[[Witenagemot]]'') took place in Sussex on 3 April 930,&lt;ref name=&quot;Roach 2013 60–61&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roach|2013|pp=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Æthelstan]], the first king of the English, and his councillors gathered at [[Lyminster]] by the [[River Arun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2013| p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lowerson|1980| p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another ''Witenagemot'' took place in Sussex in the reign of Æthelstan (924-939), probably at [[Hamsey]], on the [[River Ouse, Sussex|River Ouse]] near Lewes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roach 2013 60–61&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VCH-L&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=56908|title='The borough of Lewes: Introduction and history', A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 7: The rape of Lewes|year=1940|pages= 7–19|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small number of [[diploma]]s (documents affirming the grant or tenure of specified land) from Sussex survive from this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roach|2013|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1060s Lewes may have been Sussex's legal centre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong 1971 41&quot;/&gt;

===Religion===
{{See also|Anglo-Saxon paganism|History of Christianity in Sussex#Saxon|Christianisation of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon Christianity}}
After the departure of the Roman army, the Saxons arrived in Sussex in the 5th century and brought with them their polytheistic religion.&lt;ref&gt;Jones. The end of Roman Britain. pp. 164–168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong 1971 38–40&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1971| pp=38–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Saxon pagan culture probably caused a reversal of the spread of Christianity.&lt;ref name=&quot;higham79&quot;&gt;Higham The English Conquest. p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilfrid's biographer records that in the year 666 Wilfrid's ship ran aground on the Sussex coast near Selsey where it was attacked and a pagan priest sought to cast magic spells from a high mound.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brandon 1978 37&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Brandon|1978| p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bede also refers to a mass suicide committed by groups of 40 or 50 men who jumped from cliffs during a time of [[famine]]. It is probable that these suicides represented sacrifices to appease the god [[Woden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brandon 1978 37&quot;/&gt;

[[Aethelwalh of Sussex|Æðelwealh]] became Sussex's first Christian king when he married Eafe, the daughter of [[Wulfhere]], the Christian king of [[Mercia]]. In 681 AD Saint [[Wilfrid]], the exiled [[Bishop of York]], landed at Selsey and is credited with evangelising the local population and founding the church in Sussex. King Æðelwealh granted land to Wilfrid which became the site of [[Selsey Abbey]]. According to [[Bede]], it was the last area of the country to be converted.&lt;ref name=&quot;bede225&quot;&gt;Bede.HE.IV.13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong 1971 38–40&quot;/&gt; Whilst Wilfrid is credited with the conversion of the Kingdom of Sussex to Christianity, it is unlikely that it was wholly heathen when he arrived.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brandon 2006 70–71&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Brandon|2006| pp=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Æðelwealh, Sussex's king, had been baptised. [[Damianus]], a South Saxon, was made [[Bishop of Rochester]] in the Kingdom of Kent in the 650s and may indicate earlier missionary work in the first half of the 7th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brandon 2006 70–71&quot;/&gt; At the time of Wilfrid's mission there was a monastery at [[Bosham]] containing a few monks led by an Irish monk named Dicul,&lt;ref name=&quot;Brandon 2006 70–71&quot;/&gt; which was probably part of the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]] of the time. Wilfrid was a champion of Roman customs and it was these customs that were adopted by the church in Sussex rather than the [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic]] customs that had taken root in Scotland and Ireland.

Shortly after Æðelwealh granted land to Wilfrid for the church, Æðelwealh was killed by [[Cædwalla of Wessex]], Sussex was conquered by Cædwalla and Christianity in Sussex was put under control of the [[diocese of Winchester]]. It was not until {{Circa|715}} that [[Eadberht of Selsey|Eadberht, Abbot of Selsey]] was consecrated the first [[Bishop of Selsey|bishop of the South Saxons]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brandon 2006 71&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Brandon|2006| p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean-Baptiste Say''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒɑ̃batist sɛ|lang}}; 5 January 1767 – 15 November 1832) was a [[Economic liberalism|liberal]] French economist and businessman who argued in favor of [[Competition (economics)|competition]], [[free trade]] and lifting restraints on business. He is best known for [[Say's law]]—also known as the law of markets—which he popularized. Scholars disagree on the surprisingly subtle question of whether it was Say who first stated what is now called Say's law.&lt;ref&gt;Thweatt, William O. &quot;Early Formulators of Say's Law&quot;. In {{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=John Cunningham (editor)|editor-link1=John Cunningham Wood|last2=Kates|first2=Steven (editor)|title=Jean-Baptiste Say: Critical Assessments|volume=V|date=2000|place=London|publisher=Routledge|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=EcaDC1q_eaAC&amp;pg=PA78 78–93]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, Fernand (1979).

[https://books.google.com/books?id=WPDbSXQsvGIC&amp;pg=PA181 p. 181].&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he was one of the first economists to study [[entrepreneurship]] and conceptualized entrepreneurs as organizers and leaders of the economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Entrepreneurship&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koolman|first=G.|year=1971|title=Say's Conception of the Role of the Entrepreneur|journal=Economica|volume=38|issue=151|pages=269–286|doi=10.2307/2552843|jstor=2552843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
[[File:Say map.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Map of [[Croydon]], drawn by the 18-year-old Say in 1785]]
Say was born in [[Lyon]]. His father Jean-Etienne Say was born to a [[Protestant]] family which had moved from [[Nîmes]] to [[Geneva]] for some time in consequence of the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]]. Say was intended to follow a commercial career and in 1785 was sent with his brother Horace to complete his education in England. He lodged for a time in [[Croydon]] and afterwards (following a return visit to France) in [[Fulham]]. During the latter period, he was employed successively by two London-based firms of sugar merchants, James Baillie &amp; Co and Samuel and William Hibbert.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Brian|last=Lancaster|title=Jean-Baptiste Say's 1785 Croydon street plan|journal=Croydon Natural History &amp; Scientific Society Bulletin|volume=144|date=March 2012|pages=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Brian|last=Lancaster|year=2015|title=Jean-Baptiste Say's First Visit to England (1785/6)|journal=History of European Ideas|volume=41|issue=7|pages=922–930|doi=10.1080/01916599.2014.989676|s2cid=144520487}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1786, he accompanied Samuel Hibbert on a voyage to France which ended in December with Hibbert's death in [[Nantes]]. Say returned to Paris, where he found employment in the office of a [[life assurance]] company directed by [[Étienne Clavière]]. His brother [[Louis Auguste Say|Louis Auguste]] (1774–1840) also became an economist.

== Writings, teaching and entrepreneurship ==
[[File:Say - Lettres a M. Malthus, 1820 - 5496950.tif|thumb|upright|Title page of Say's ''Lettres à M. Malthus, sur différens sujets d'économie politique'', published in 1820]]
Say's first literary attempt was a pamphlet on the liberty of the press, published in 1789. He later worked under [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, Comte de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]] on the ''Courrier de Provence''. In 1792, he took part as a volunteer in the campaign of [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]]. In 1793, he assumed in keeping with [[French Revolution]]ary fashion the pseudonym Atticus and became secretary to [[Étienne Clavière]], the then finance minister.

From 1794 to 1800, he edited a periodical, entitled ''La Decade philosophique, litteraire, et politique'', in which he expounded the doctrines of [[Adam Smith]]. He had by this time established his reputation as a publicist and when the [[French Consulate|consular government]] was established in 1799 he was selected as one of the 100 members of the [[Tribunat]], resigning the editorship of the ''Decade''. In 1800, Say published ''Olbie, ou essai sur les moyens de réformer les mœurs d'une nation''. In 1803, he published his principal work, the ''[[Say's Political Economy|Traité d'économie politique ou simple exposition de la manière dont se forment, se distribuent et se composent les richesses]]''. Having proved unwilling to compromise his convictions in the interests of [[Napoleon]], Say was removed from the office of tribune in 1804. He turned to industrial activities and after having familiarised himself with the processes of cotton manufacture he established a [[Cotton mill|spinning-mill]] at [[Auchy-lès-Hesdin]] in the [[Pas de Calais]] which employed some 400–500 people, mainly women and children. He devoted his leisure time to revising his economic treatise which had been out of print for some time, but the system of state censorship in place prevented him from republishing it.

In 1814, Say availed himself (to use his own words) of the relative liberty arising from the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|entrance of the allied powers into France]] to bring out a second edition of the work dedicated to the emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]], who had professed himself his pupil. In the same year, the French government sent him to study the economic condition of the United Kingdom. The results of his observations appeared in a tract, ''De l'Angleterre et des Anglais''. A third edition of the ''Traité'' appeared in 1817.

A chair of industrial economy was established for him in 1819 at the [[Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers]]. In 1825, he became a member of the improvement council of the ''École spéciale de commerce et d'industrie'', one of the first [[business school]]s in the world, and now (as ''École supérieure de commerce de Paris -'' [[ESCP Europe|ESCP]]) regarded as the world's oldest business school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document|title=Adrien Jean-Guy Passant: Between filial piety and managerial opportunism: The strategic use of the history of a family business after the buyout by non-family purchasers, Entreprises et Histoire, Volume 91, Issue 2, pp.62-81, 2018|doi=10.3917/eh.091.0062|url=https://doi.org/10.3917/eh.091.0062|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the French scholar Adrien Jean-Guy Passant reveals, Jean-Baptiste Say is not the founder of this business school.&lt;ref&gt;Adrien Jean-Guy Passant: À l’origine des écoles de commerce : ESCP Business School, la passion d’entreprendre, L'Harmattan, 2020, isbn=978-2-343-18659-7.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1831, he was made professor of political economy at the [[Collège de France]]. In 1828–1830, he published his ''Cours complet d'économie politique pratique''.

== Say's law ==
{{neoliberalism sidebar}}
{{further|Say's law}}
Say is well known for Say's law, or the law of markets, often controversially summarised as:
* &quot;[[Aggregate supply]] creates its own [[aggregate demand]]&quot;
* &quot;[[Supply creates its own demand]]&quot;

Say's law is instead uncontroversially summarized as:
* &quot;Supply constitutes its own demand&quot;
* &quot;Inherent in supply is the wherewithal for its own consumption&quot; (direct translation from French ''Traité d'économie politique'')

The exact phrase &quot;supply creates its own demand&quot; was coined by [[John Maynard Keynes]], who criticized it as in the former two, equating all four of these statements to mean the same thing. Some economists, including some advocates of Say's law who dispute this characterization as a misrepresentation,&lt;ref name=&quot;clower92&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Clower|2004|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tzzClShefiYC&amp;pg=PA92 p. 92]}}&lt;/ref&gt; have disputed his interpretation, claiming that Say's law can actually be summarized more accurately as &quot;production precedes consumption&quot; and that Say was claiming that in order to consume one must produce something of value so that one can trade this (either in the form of money or barter) in order to consume later.&lt;ref&gt;Bylund, Per. [https://twitter.com/perbylund/status/883692795583746049 &quot;Say's Law (the Law of Markets)&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar sentiments through different wordings appear in the work of [[John Stuart Mill]] (1848) and his father [[James Mill]] (1808). The Scottish classical economist James Mill restates Say's law in 1808, writing that &quot;production of commodities creates, and is the one and universal cause which creates a market for the commodities produced&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, James (1808). ''Commerce Defended''. [http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1668&amp;layout=html &quot;Chapter VI: Consumption&quot;]. p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Say's language, &quot;products are paid for with products&quot; (1803, p. 153) or &quot;a glut can take place only when there are too many means of production applied to one kind of product and not enough to another&quot; (1803, pp. 178–179). Explaining his point at length, he wrote the following:&lt;ref&gt;[http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/profiles/say.htm &quot;Information on Jean-Baptiste Say&quot;].{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326021523/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/profiles/say.htm|date=26 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|It is worthwhile to remark that a product is no sooner created than it, from that instant, affords a market for other products to the full extent of its own value. When the producer has put the finishing hand to his product, he is most anxious to sell it immediately, lest its value should diminish in his hands. Nor is he less anxious to dispose of the money he may get for it; for the value of money is also perishable. But the only way of getting rid of money is in the purchase of some product or other. Thus the mere circumstance of creation of one product immediately opens a vent for other products.&lt;ref&gt;Say, Jean-Baptiste (1803). ''A Treatise on Political Economy''. pp. 138–139.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Say also wrote that it is not the abundance of money, but the abundance of other products in general that facilitates sales:&lt;ref&gt;Say, Jean-Baptiste (1803). ''A Treatise on Political Economy''. Translated from the fourth edition of the French in 2001. Batoche Books Kitchener. p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Money performs but a momentary function in this double exchange; and when the transaction is finally closed, it will always be found, that one kind of commodity has been exchanged for another.}}

Say's law may also have been culled from [[Ecclesiastes]] 5:11 – &quot;When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes?&quot; ([[King James Version|KJV]]). Say's law has been considered by [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] as &quot;the most distinguished example of the stability of economic ideas, including when they are wrong&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=John Kenneth|last=Galbraith|title=Money: Whence It Came, Where It Went|location=Boston|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1975|isbn=0-395-19843-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Say's law emerged during the early period of the [[Industrial Revolution]], at a time when the economic phenomena of increased output merged with England's cyclical inability to maintain both sales and unemployment. This led many to believe that there was a limit to the growth of production, and there may come a point when there is no means of purchasing all output generated. Say's Law of Markets deals with the fact that production of commodities causes income to be paid to suppliers of the components of capital, labor, and land used in producing these goods and services. The sale price of these commodities is the sum of the payments of wages, rents, and profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sowell |first=Thomas |title=Say's Law: An Historical Analysis |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |year=1972 |isbn=9781400871223 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Income generated during production of a commodity equals the value of that commodity. Therefore, an increase in the supply of output will result in an increase in the income necessary to generate demand for those products. In the words of Jean-Baptiste Say, &quot;unless we produce, we cannot consume; unless we first supply, we cannot demand&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Eberling |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Ebeling |title=Economic Ideas: Jean-Baptiste Say and the 'Law of Markets' |publisher=The Future of Freedom Foundation |date=19 June 2017  |url=https://www.fff.org/explore-freedom/article/economic-ideas-jean-baptiste-say-law-markets/ |accessdate=21 April 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory of entrepreneurship ==
In the ''Treatise'', his main economic work, Say stated that any production process required effort, knowledge and the &quot;application&quot; of the entrepreneur. According to him, entrepreneurs are intermediaries in the production process who combine productive agents such as land, capital and labor in order to meet the demand of consumers. As a result, they play a central role in the economy and fulfil a coordinating role.&lt;ref name=&quot;Entrepreneurship&quot;/&gt;

Besides studying large-scale entrepreneurs, Say looked at people working for themselves:
{{quote|When a workman carries on an enterprise on his own account, as the knife grinder in the streets, he is both workman and entrepreneur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/library/catechism-political-economy|title=Catechism of Political Economy|last=Say|first=Jean-Baptiste|year=1821|publisher=Mises Institute|accessdate=13 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Say also thought about which qualities are essential for successful entrepreneurs and highlighted the quality of judgement. To his mind, entrepreneurs have to continuously assess market needs and the means which could meet them, which requires an &quot;unerring market sense&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Entrepreneurship&quot;/&gt;

As he emphasized the coordinating function of entrepreneurs, Say viewed entrepreneurial income primarily as high wages that are paid in compensation for the skills and expert knowledge of entrepreneurs. He did so by making a distinction between the enterprise function and the supply-of-capital-function which allowed him to look at the earnings of the entrepreneur on the one hand and the remuneration of capital on the other hand. This clearly differentiates his theory from that of [[Joseph Schumpeter]], who described entrepreneurial rent as short-term profits that compensate for high risk ([[Schumpeterian rent]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Entrepreneurship&quot;/&gt; Say also touched upon [[risk]] and [[uncertainty]] as well as [[innovation]] when discussing entrepreneurship, although he never deeply investigated their relationships. However, Say stated:
{{quote|[In any enterprise activity] there is an abundance of obstacles to be surmounted, of anxieties to be repressed, of misfortunes to be repaired, and of expedients to be devised [...] [and] there is always a degree of risk attending such undertakings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Treatise on Political Economy|last=Say|first=Jean-Baptiste|publisher=Claxton, Remsen &amp; Haffelfinger|year=1880|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{quote|Sometimes a manufacturer discovers a process, calculated either to introduce a new product, to increase the beauty of an old one, or to produce with greater economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Treatise on Political economy.|last=Say|first=Jean-Baptiste|publisher=Claxton, Remsen &amp; Haffelfinger|year=1880|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=329}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Honours ==
In 1826, Say was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

== Later years and death ==
[[File:Père-Lachaise - Division 39 - Say 01.jpg|thumb|Say's tomb in the [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris]]
In his later years, Say became subject to attacks of nervous [[apoplexy]]. He lost his wife in January 1830 and from that time his health declined. When the [[July Revolution|revolution of that year]] broke out, Say was named a member of the council-general of the department of the [[Seine]], but he found it necessary to resign.

Say died in Paris on 15 November 1832 and was buried in the [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]].

== Personal life ==
In 1793, Say married Mlle Deloche, daughter of a former lawyer.

'''Desert varnish''' or '''rock varnish''' is an orange-yellow to black coating found on exposed [[Rock (geology)|rock]] surfaces in [[arid]] environments. Desert varnish is approximately one [[micrometre|micrometer]] thick and exhibits [[nanometer]]-scale layering.&lt;ref&gt;David Krinsley, Ronald Dorn, N. K. Tovey 1995. Nanometer-Scale Layering in Rock Varnish: Implications for Genesis and Paleoenvironmental Interpretation, The Journal of Geology, 103(1): 106–113&lt;/ref&gt; '''Rock rust''' and '''desert patina''' are other terms which are also used for the condition, but less often.

==Formation==
Desert varnish forms only on physically stable rock surfaces that are no longer subject to frequent [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], fracturing or [[ventifact|wind abrasion]]. The varnish is primarily composed of particles of [[clay]] along with [[iron]] and [[manganese]] [[oxidation|oxides]].&lt;ref&gt;Perry, R.S. and Adams, J.B. 1978. Desert varnish: evidence for cyclic deposition of manganese. Nature 276(5687):489–491.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a host of trace elements and almost always some [[organic matter]]. The color of the varnish varies from shades of brown to black.&lt;ref name=Chernicoff&gt;Chernicoff, Stanley and Whitney, Donna 2007. Geology: An Introduction to Physical Geology 4th ed. Pearson Education p. 585&lt;/ref&gt;

Desert varnish appears to have been observed by rovers on Mars, and if examined may contain fossilized life from Mars's wet period.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rms.org.uk/study-read/infocus-magazine/infocus-listing/desert-varnish-with-microscopy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally scientists thought that the varnish was made from substances drawn out of the rocks it coats.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, W.P. 1905. Superficial blackening and discoloration of rocks especially in desert regions. Transactions of the American Institute of Mining Engineers 35:371–375.&lt;/ref&gt;  Microscopic and microchemical observations, however, show that a major part of varnish is clay, which could only arrive by wind.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, R.M. and Rossman, G.R. 1977. Desert varnish: the importance of clay minerals. Science 196(4297):1446–1448.&lt;/ref&gt;  Clay, then, acts as a [[wikt:substrate|substrate]] to catch additional substances that chemically react together when the rock reaches high temperatures in the [[desert]] sun.  Wetting by [[dew]] is also important in the process.&lt;ref name=Chernicoff/&gt;

An important characteristic of black desert varnish is that it has an unusually high concentration of [[manganese]]. Manganese is relatively rare in the Earth's crust, making up only 0.12% of its weight. In black desert varnish, however, manganese is 50 to 60 times more abundant. One proposal&lt;ref&gt;The Photocatalytic Reactions of Desert Varnish, Lacie Johnson (Carrick Eggleston), 2013,  [http://repository.uwyo.edu/ugrd/2013_UGRD/Presentations/58/]&lt;/ref&gt; for a mechanism of desert varnish formation is that it is caused by manganese-oxidizing [[microbe]]s ([[mixotroph]]s) which are common in environments poor in [[Organic matter|organic nutrients]]. A micro-environment [[pH]] above 7.5 is inhospitable for manganese-concentrating microbes. In such conditions, orange varnishes develop, poor in manganese (Mn) but rich in iron (Fe).&lt;ref&gt;Dorn, R.I. and Oberlander, T.M. 1981. Microbial origin of desert varnish. Science 213:1245–1247.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative hypothesis for Mn/Fe fluctuation has been proposed that considers Mn-rich and Fe-rich varnishes to be related to humid and [[arid climate]]s, respectively &lt;ref&gt;Tanzhuo Liu and Ronald I. Dorn 1996. Understanding the Spatial Variability of Environmental Change in Drylands with Rock Varnish Microlaminations. Annals of the Association of American Geographers 86(2): 187–212.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Valley of Fire petroglyphs.jpg|thumb|Petroglyphs carved in desert varnish at the [[Valley of Fire]] near [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. Area shown is about one metre across.]]

Even though it contains high concentrations of iron and manganese, there are no significant modern uses of desert varnish. However, some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] peoples created [[petroglyph]]s by scraping or chipping away the dark varnish to expose the lighter rock beneath.

Desert varnish often obscures the identity of the underlying rock, and different rocks have varying abilities to accept and retain varnish. [[Limestone]]s, for example,  typically do not have varnish because they are too water-soluble and therefore do not provide a stable surface for varnish to form. Shiny, dense and black varnishes form on [[basalt]], fine [[quartzite]]s and [[metamorphic rock|metamorphosed]] [[shale]]s due to these rocks' relatively high resistance to weathering.

Its presence has been cited as a key factor in the preservation of a large number of petroglyphs dating back to the [[Iron Age in the United Arab Emirates|Iron Age]] and earlier in areas such as the [[Wadi Saham]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]].

'''Death Valley National Park''' is an American [[national park]] that straddles the [[California]]–[[Nevada]] border, east of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. The park boundaries include [[Death Valley]], the northern section of [[Panamint Valley]], the southern section of [[Eureka Valley (Inyo County)|Eureka Valley]], and most of [[Saline Valley, California|Saline Valley]]. The park occupies an interface zone between the arid [[Great Basin Desert|Great Basin]] and [[Mojave Desert|Mojave]] deserts, protecting the northwest corner of the Mojave Desert and its diverse environment of [[Salt pan (geology)|salt-flat]]s, sand [[dune]]s, [[badlands]], valleys, canyons, and mountains. Death Valley is the largest national park in the [[contiguous United States]], and the hottest, driest and lowest of all the national parks in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/deva/index.htm|title=Death Valley National Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126142816/https://www.nps.gov/deva/index.htm|archive-date=2017-01-26|url-status=live|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second-lowest point in the Western Hemisphere is in [[Badwater Basin]], which is {{convert|282|ft|m}} below sea level. Approximately 91% of the park is a designated [[U.S. Wilderness Area|wilderness area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/deva/planyourvisit/backcountryroads.htm|title=Backcountry Roads - Death Valley National Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126142625/https://www.nps.gov/deva/planyourvisit/backcountryroads.htm|archive-date=2017-01-26|url-status=live|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park is home to many species of plants and animals that have adapted to this harsh [[desert]] environment. Some examples include [[Larrea tridentata|creosote bush]], [[bighorn sheep]], [[coyote]], and the [[Death Valley pupfish]], a survivor from much wetter times. [[UNESCO]] included Death Valley as the principal feature of its [[Mojave and Colorado Deserts Biosphere Reserve]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=USA+39&amp;mode=all &quot;Biosphere Reserve Information - United States of America - Mojave and Colorado Deserts&quot;]. ''unesco.org''. [[UNESCO]]. November 3, 2005. Retrieved June 22, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] groups inhabited the area from as early as 7000&amp;nbsp;BC, most recently the [[Timbisha]] around 1000&amp;nbsp;AD who migrated between winter camps in the valleys and summer grounds in the mountains. A group of European Americans, trapped in the valley in 1849 while looking for a shortcut to the [[California Gold Rush|gold fields of California]], gave the valley its name, even though only one of their group died there. Several short-lived [[boomtown|boom town]]s sprang up during the late 19th and early 20th centuries to mine gold and silver. The only long-term profitable [[ore]] to be mined was [[borax]], which was transported out of the valley with [[twenty-mule team]]s. The valley later became the subject of books, radio programs, television series, and movies. Tourism expanded in the 1920s when resorts were built around [[Stovepipe Wells, California|Stovepipe Wells]] and [[Furnace Creek, California|Furnace Creek]]. Death Valley National Monument was declared in 1933 and the park was substantially expanded and became a national park in 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPSindex&quot;&gt;[[#NPSindex|National Park Index (2001–2003)]], p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The natural environment of the area has been shaped largely by its geology. The valley is actually a [[graben]] with the oldest [[rock (geology)|rock]]s being extensively [[metamorphism|metamorphosed]] and at least 1.7&amp;nbsp;billion years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright1997p611&quot;/&gt; Ancient, warm, shallow seas deposited marine sediments until [[rift]]ing opened the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Additional sedimentation occurred until a [[subduction]] zone formed off the coast. The subduction [[Orogeny|uplifted]] the region out of the sea and created a line of [[volcano]]es. Later the [[crust (geology)|crust]] started to pull apart, creating the current [[Basin and Range Province|Basin and Range]] landform. Valleys filled with sediment and, during the wet times of [[glacial period]]s, with lakes, such as [[Lake Manly]].

In 2013, Death Valley National Park was designated as a [[dark-sky preserve|dark sky park]] by the [[International Dark-Sky Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berwyn|title=Death Valley NP earns dark skies certification|url=http://summitcountyvoice.com/2013/02/21/death-valley-np-earns-dark-skies-certification/|accessdate=1 December 2015|work=Summit County Citizens Voice|date=21 February 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151204023627/http://summitcountyvoice.com/2013/02/21/death-valley-np-earns-dark-skies-certification/|archivedate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic setting==
There are two major valleys in the park, [[Death Valley]] and [[Panamint Valley]]. Both of these valleys were formed within the last few million years and both are bounded by north–south-trending [[mountain range]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharp1997p1&quot;/&gt; These and adjacent valleys follow the general trend of [[Basin and range topography|Basin and Range topography]] with one modification: there are parallel [[strike-slip fault]]s that perpendicularly bound the central extent of Death Valley. The result of this shearing action is additional extension in the central part of Death Valley which causes a slight widening and more subsidence there.

Uplift of surrounding mountain ranges and subsidence of the valley floor are both occurring. The uplift on the Black Mountains is so fast that the [[alluvial fan]]s (fan-shaped deposits at the mouth of canyons) there are small and steep compared to the huge alluvial fans coming off the [[Panamint Range]]. Fast uplift of a mountain range in an arid environment often does not allow its canyons enough time to cut a classic V-shape all the way down to the stream bed. Instead, a V-shape ends at a [[slot canyon]] halfway down, forming a 'wine glass canyon.'  Sediment is deposited on a small and steep alluvial fan.

At {{convert|282|ft|m}} below [[sea level]] at its lowest point,&lt;ref name=NED&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/usgs-national-elevation-dataset-ned-1-meter-downloadable-data-collection-from-the-national-map-|title=USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED) 1 meter Downloadable Data Collection from The National Map 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) - National Geospatial Data Asset (NGDA) National Elevation Data Set (NED)|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|date=September 21, 2015|accessdate=September 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Badwater Basin on Death Valley's floor is the second-lowest depression in the Western Hemisphere (behind [[Laguna del Carbón]] in [[Argentina]]), while [[Mount Whitney]], only {{convert|85|mi|km}} to the west, rises to {{convert|14505|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharp1997p1&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sharp|1997|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This topographic relief is the greatest elevation gradient in the [[Continental United States|contiguous United States]] and is the terminus point of the [[Great Basin]]'s southwestern drainage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright1997p611&quot;/&gt; Although the extreme lack of water in the Great Basin makes this distinction of little current practical use, it does mean that in wetter times the lake that once filled Death Valley ([[Lake Manly]]) was the last stop for water flowing in the region, meaning the water there was saturated in dissolved materials. Thus the [[salt pan (geology)|salt pan]]s in Death Valley are among the largest in the world and are rich in minerals, such as [[borax]] and various salts and [[hydrate]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright1997p625&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Wright and Miller|1997|p=625}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest salt pan in the park extends {{convert|40|mi|km}} from the Ashford Mill Site to the Salt Creek Hills, covering some {{convert|200|sqmi|km2}} of the valley floor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright1997p625&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Badwater, the Devils Golf Course, and Salt Creek are all part of the Death Valley Saltpan.&lt;/ref&gt; The best known [[Dry lake|playa]] in the park is the [[Racetrack Playa|Racetrack]], known for its moving rocks.{{clear}}

==Climate==
[[File:DevaxsectSM.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.8|A cross section through the highest and lowest points in Death Valley National Park]]

According to the [[Köppen climate classification]] system, Death Valley National Park has a Hot Desert Climate (''BWh''). The [[plant hardiness zone]] at Badwater Basin is 9b with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of 27.3&amp;nbsp;°F (-2.6&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name=&quot;USDA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/InteractiveMap.aspx|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]|accessdate=2019-07-03|title=USDA Interactive Plant Hardiness Map}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death Valley is the hottest and driest place in North America due to its lack of surface water and low relief. It is so frequently the hottest spot in the United States that many tabulations of the highest daily temperatures in the country omit Death Valley as a matter of course.&lt;ref&gt;Hickcox, David H., &quot;Temperature extremes. (United States)(1996 Weather)&quot;, ''Weatherwise'', February 1, 1997.

On the afternoon of July 10, 1913, the [[National Weather Service|United States Weather Bureau]] recorded a high temperature of 134&amp;nbsp;°F (56.7&amp;nbsp;°C) at [[Furnace Creek, California|Greenland Ranch]] (now [[Furnace Creek, California|Furnace Creek]]) in Death Valley.&lt;ref name=WorldHighTemp&gt;{{cite web|title=World Meteorological Organization World Weather/Climate Extremes Archive |url=http://wmo.asu.edu/world-highest-temperature |accessdate=10 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104143844/http://wmo.asu.edu/world-highest-temperature |archivedate=4 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This temperature stands as the highest ambient air temperature ever recorded at the surface of the Earth.

Several of the larger Death Valley springs derive their water from a regional [[aquifer]], which extends as far east as southern [[Nevada]] and [[Utah]]. Much of the water in this aquifer has been there for many thousands of years, since the [[Quaternary glaciation|Pleistocene ice ages]], when the [[climate]] was cooler and wetter. Today's drier climate does not provide enough precipitation to recharge the aquifer at the rate at which water is being withdrawn.&lt;ref name=&quot;FocusWater&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|USGS|2004|p=&quot;Furnace Creek&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

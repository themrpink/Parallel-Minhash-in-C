      <text bytes="21414" xml:space="preserve">{{short description|Topological space in which every open cover has an open refinement that is locally finite}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''paracompact space''' is a [[topological space]] in which every [[open cover]] has an open [[Cover (topology)#Refinement|refinement]] that is [[locally finite collection|locally finite]]. These spaces were introduced by {{harvtxt|Dieudonné|1944}}. Every [[compact space]] is paracompact. Every paracompact [[Hausdorff space]] is [[normal space|normal]], and a Hausdorff space is paracompact if and only if it admits [[partition of unity|partitions of unity]] subordinate to any open cover.  Sometimes paracompact spaces are defined so as to always be Hausdorff.

Every [[closed set|closed]] [[subspace (topology)|subspace]] of a paracompact space is paracompact. While compact subsets of Hausdorff spaces are always closed, this is not true for paracompact subsets. A space such that every subspace of it is a paracompact space is called '''hereditarily paracompact'''. This is equivalent to requiring that every [[open set|open]] subspace be paracompact.

[[Tychonoff's theorem]] (which states that the [[product (topology)|product]] of any collection of compact topological spaces is compact) does not generalize to paracompact spaces in that the product of paracompact spaces need not be paracompact. However, the product of a paracompact space and a compact space is always paracompact.

Every [[metric space]] is paracompact. A topological space is [[Metrizable space|metrizable]] if and only if it is a paracompact and [[locally metrizable space|locally metrizable]] [[Hausdorff space]].

== Definition ==

A ''[[cover (set theory)|cover]]'' of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a collection of [[subset]]s of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; whose [[union (set theory)|union]] contains &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. In symbols, if &lt;math&gt;U = \{U_\alpha : \alpha \in A\}&lt;/math&gt; is an indexed family of subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a cover of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if

: &lt;math&gt;X \subseteq \bigcup_{\alpha \in A}U_{\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

A cover of a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is ''[[open cover|open]]'' if all its members are [[open set]]s. A ''refinement'' of a cover of a space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a new cover of the same space such that every set in the new cover is a [[subset]] of some set in the old cover. In symbols, the cover &lt;math&gt;V = \{V_\beta : \beta \in B\}&lt;/math&gt; is a refinement of the cover &lt;math&gt;U = \{U_\alpha : \alpha \in A\}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if, [[universal quantification|for any]] &lt;math&gt;V_\beta&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, [[existential quantification|there exists some]] &lt;math&gt;U_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;V_\beta \subseteq U_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

An open cover of a space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is ''locally finite'' if every point of the space has a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] that intersects only [[finite set|finite]]ly many sets in the cover. In symbols, &lt;math&gt;U = \{U_\alpha : \alpha \in A\}&lt;/math&gt; is locally finite if and only if, for any &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, there exists some neighbourhood &lt;math&gt;V(x)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that the set

: &lt;math&gt;\left\{ \alpha \in A : U_{\alpha} \cap V(x) \neq \varnothing \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

is finite. A topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is now said to be '''paracompact''' if every open cover has a locally finite open refinement.

== Examples ==

* Every [[compact space]] is paracompact.
* Every [[regular space|regular]] [[Lindelöf space]] is paracompact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michael|first=Ernest|date=1953|title=A note on paracompact spaces|url=https://www.ams.org/journals/proc/1957-008-04/S0002-9939-1957-0087079-9/S0002-9939-1957-0087079-9.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society|language=en-US|volume=4|issue=5|pages=831–838|doi=10.1090/S0002-9939-1953-0056905-8|issn=0002-9939|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, every [[locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[second-countable space]] is paracompact.
* The [[Sorgenfrey line]] is paracompact, even though it is neither compact, locally compact, second countable, nor metrizable.
* Every [[CW complex]] is paracompact &lt;ref&gt;[[Allen Hatcher|Hatcher, Allen]], ''Vector bundles and K-theory'', preliminary version available on the [http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/ author's homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ('''Theorem of [[A. H. Stone]]''') Every [[metric space]] is paracompact.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, A. H.

Soc. 54 (1948), 977–982&lt;/ref&gt;  Early proofs were somewhat involved, but an elementary one was found by [[Mary Ellen Rudin|M.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;Rudin]].&lt;ref&gt;Rudin, Mary Ellen.  [http://www.ams.org/journals/proc/1969-020-02/S0002-9939-1969-0236876-3/S0002-9939-1969-0236876-3.pdf A new proof that metric spaces are paracompact].  Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. 20, No. 2. (Feb., 1969), p. 603.&lt;/ref&gt;  Existing proofs of this require the [[axiom of choice]] for the non-separable case.  It has been shown that [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]] theory is not sufficient to prove it, even after the weaker [[axiom of dependent choice]] is added.&lt;ref&gt;C. Good, I. J. Tree, and W. S. Watson.  [http://www.ams.org/proc/1998-126-04/S0002-9939-98-04163-X/S0002-9939-98-04163-X.pdf On Stone's Theorem and the Axiom of Choice].  Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. 126, No. 4. (April, 1998), pp. 1211–1218.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of spaces that are not paracompact include:

* The most famous counterexample is the [[long line (topology)|long line]], which is a nonparacompact [[topological manifold]]. (The long line is locally compact, but not second countable.)
* Another counterexample is a [[product topology|product]] of [[uncountable set|uncountably]] many copies of an [[infinite (cardinality)|infinite]] [[discrete space]]. Any infinite set carrying the [[particular point topology]] is not paracompact; in fact it is not even [[metacompact]].
* The [[Prüfer manifold]] is a non-paracompact surface.
* The [[bagpipe theorem]] shows that there are 2&lt;sup&gt;ℵ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; isomorphism classes of non-paracompact surfaces.
* The [[Sorgenfrey plane]] is not paracompact despite being a product of two paracompact spaces.

== Properties ==

Paracompactness is weakly hereditary, i.e. every closed subspace of a paracompact space is paracompact. This can be extended to [[F-sigma set|F-sigma]] subspaces as well.

* A [[regular space]] is paracompact if every open cover admits a locally finite refinement. (Here, the refinement is not required to be open.) In particular, every regular [[Lindelöf space]] is paracompact.
* ('''Smirnov metrization theorem''') A topological space is metrizable if and only if it is paracompact, Hausdorff, and locally metrizable.
* [[Michael selection theorem]] states that lower semicontinuous multifunctions from ''X'' into nonempty closed convex subsets of Banach spaces admit continuous selection iff ''X'' is paracompact.

Although a product of paracompact spaces need not be paracompact, the following are true:

* The product of a paracompact space and a [[compact space]] is paracompact.
* The product of a [[metacompact space]] and a compact space is metacompact.

Both these results can be proved by the [[tube lemma]] which is used in the proof that a product of ''finitely many'' compact spaces is compact.

== Paracompact Hausdorff spaces ==

Paracompact spaces are sometimes required to also be [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] to extend their properties.

* ('''Theorem of [[Jean Dieudonné]]''') Every paracompact Hausdorff space is [[normal space|normal]].
* Every paracompact Hausdorff space is a [[shrinking space]], that is, every open cover of a paracompact Hausdorff space has a shrinking: another open cover indexed by the same set such that the closure of every set in the new cover lies inside the corresponding set in the old cover.
* On paracompact Hausdorff spaces, [[sheaf cohomology]] and [[Čech cohomology]] are equal.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Loop Spaces, Characteristic Classes and Geometric Quantization|volume=107|series=Progress in Mathematics|first=Jean-Luc|last=Brylinski|publisher=Springer|year=2007|isbn=9780817647308|page=32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ta5UB1D64_gC&amp;pg=PA32}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Partitions of unity ===

The most important feature of paracompact [[Hausdorff space]]s is that they are [[normal space|normal]] and admit [[partition of unity|partitions of unity]] subordinate to any open cover. This means the following: if ''X'' is a paracompact Hausdorff space with a given open cover, then there exists a collection of [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] functions on ''X'' with values in the [[unit interval]] [0, 1] such that:

* for every function ''f'':&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' from the collection, there is an open set ''U'' from the cover such that the [[support (mathematics)|support]] of ''f'' is contained in ''U'';
* for every point ''x'' in ''X'', there is a neighborhood ''V'' of ''x'' such that all but finitely many of the functions in the collection are identically 0 in ''V'' and the sum of the nonzero functions is identically 1 in ''V''.

In fact, a T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space is Hausdorff and paracompact if and only if it admits partitions of unity subordinate to any open cover (see [[Paracompact space#Proof that paracompact Hausdorff spaces admit partitions of unity|below]]). This property is sometimes used to define paracompact spaces (at least in the Hausdorff case).

Partitions of unity are useful because they often allow one to extend local constructions to the whole space. For instance, the integral of [[differential form]]s on paracompact [[manifold]]s is first defined locally (where the manifold looks like [[Euclidean space]] and the integral is well known), and this definition is then extended to the whole space via a partition of unity.

==== Proof that paracompact Hausdorff spaces admit partitions of unity ====

A Hausdorff space &lt;math&gt;X\,&lt;/math&gt; is paracompact if and only if it every open cover admits a subordinate partition of unity. The ''if'' direction is straightforward. Now for the ''only if'' direction, we do this in a few stages.

: '''Lemma 1:''' If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}\,&lt;/math&gt; is a locally finite open cover, then there exists open sets &lt;math&gt;W_{U}\,&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;U\in\mathcal{O}\,&lt;/math&gt;, such that each &lt;math&gt;\bar{W_{U}}\subseteq U\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{W_{U}:U\in\mathcal{O}\}\,&lt;/math&gt; is a locally finite refinement.

: '''Lemma 2:''' If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}\,&lt;/math&gt; is a locally finite open cover, then there are continuous functions &lt;math&gt;f_{U}:X\to[0,1]\,&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{supp}~f_{U}\subseteq U\,&lt;/math&gt; and such that &lt;math&gt;f:=\sum_{U\in\mathcal{O}}f_{U}\,&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous function which is always non-zero and finite.

: '''Theorem:''' In a paracompact Hausdorff space &lt;math&gt;X\,&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}\,&lt;/math&gt; is an open cover, then there exists a partition of unity subordinate to it.

: '''Proof (Lemma 1):''' 
:Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}\,&lt;/math&gt; be the collection of open sets meeting only finitely many sets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}\,&lt;/math&gt;, and whose closure is contained in a set in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt;. One can check as an exercise that this provides an open refinement, since paracompact Hausdorff spaces are regular, and since &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}\,&lt;/math&gt; is locally finite. Now replace &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}\,&lt;/math&gt; by a locally finite open refinement. One can easily check that each set in this refinement has the same property as that which characterised the original cover.

: Now we define &lt;math&gt;W_{U}=\bigcup\{A\in\mathcal{V}:\bar{A}\subseteq U\}\,&lt;/math&gt;. The property of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}\,&lt;/math&gt; guarantees that every &lt;math&gt;A\in\mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt; is contained in some &lt;math&gt;W_U&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore &lt;math&gt;\{W_{U}:U\in\mathcal{O}\}\,&lt;/math&gt; is an open refinement of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}\,&lt;/math&gt;. Since we have &lt;math&gt; W_{U} \subseteq U &lt;/math&gt;, this cover is immediately locally finite.
:
: Now we want to show that each &lt;math&gt;\bar{W_{U}}\subseteq U\,&lt;/math&gt;. For every &lt;math&gt;x \notin U&lt;/math&gt;, we will prove that &lt;math&gt; x \notin \bar{W_U} &lt;/math&gt;. Since we chose &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{V} &lt;/math&gt; to be locally finite, there is a neighbourhood &lt;math&gt; V[x] &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; such that only finitely many sets in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{V} &lt;/math&gt; have non-empty intersection with &lt;math&gt; V[x] &lt;/math&gt;, and we note &lt;math&gt; A_{1},...,A_{n},... \in \mathcal{V} &lt;/math&gt; those in the definition of &lt;math&gt; W_U &lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore we can decompose &lt;math&gt; W_U &lt;/math&gt; in two parts: &lt;math&gt; A_{1},...,A_{n} \in \mathcal{V} &lt;/math&gt; who intersect  &lt;math&gt; V[x] &lt;/math&gt;, and the rest &lt;math&gt; A \in \mathcal{V} &lt;/math&gt; who don't, which means that they are contained in the closed set &lt;math&gt; C:= X\setminus V[x] &lt;/math&gt;. We now have &lt;math&gt; \bar{W_U} \subseteq \bar{A_1} \cup...\cup \bar{A_n}\cup C &lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt; \bar{A_i} \subseteq U &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x \notin U &lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt; x \notin \bar{A_i} &lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;. And since &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt; is the complement of a neighbourhood of &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is also not in &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore we have &lt;math&gt; x \notin \bar{W_U} &lt;/math&gt;.

:Applying Lemma 1, let &lt;math&gt;f_{U}:X\to[0,1]\,&lt;/math&gt; be continuous maps with &lt;math&gt;f_{U}\upharpoonright\bar{W}_{U}=1\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{supp}~f_{U}\subseteq U\,&lt;/math&gt; (by Urysohn's lemma for disjoint closed sets in normal spaces, which a paracompact Hausdorff space is). Note by the support of a function, we here mean the points not mapping to zero (and not the closure of this set). To show that &lt;math&gt;f=\sum_{U\in\mathcal{O}}f_{U}\,&lt;/math&gt; is always finite and non-zero, take &lt;math&gt;x\in X\,&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;N\,&lt;/math&gt; a neighbourhood of &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; meeting only finitely many sets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}\,&lt;/math&gt;; thus &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; belongs to only finitely many sets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}\,&lt;/math&gt;; thus &lt;math&gt;f_{U}(x)=0\,&lt;/math&gt; for all but finitely many &lt;math&gt;U\,&lt;/math&gt;; moreover &lt;math&gt;x\in W_{U}\,&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;U\,&lt;/math&gt;, thus &lt;math&gt;f_{U}(x)=1\,&lt;/math&gt;; so &lt;math&gt;f(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; is finite and &lt;math&gt;\geq 1\,&lt;/math&gt;. To establish continuity, take &lt;math&gt;x,N\,&lt;/math&gt; as before, and let &lt;math&gt;S=\{U\in\mathcal{O}:N\text{ meets }U\}\,&lt;/math&gt;, which is finite; then &lt;math&gt;f\upharpoonright N=\sum_{U\in S}f_{U}\upharpoonright N\,&lt;/math&gt;, which is a continuous function; hence the preimage under &lt;math&gt;f\,&lt;/math&gt; of a neighbourhood of &lt;math&gt;f(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; will be a neighbourhood of &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt;.

:Take &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}^*\,&lt;/math&gt; a locally finite subcover of the refinement cover: &lt;math&gt;\{V\text{ open }:(\exists{U\in\mathcal{O}})\bar{V}\subseteq U\}\,&lt;/math&gt;. Applying Lemma 2, we obtain continuous functions &lt;math&gt;f_{W}:X\to[0,1]\,&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{supp}~f_{W}\subseteq W\,&lt;/math&gt; (thus the usual closed version of the support is contained in some &lt;math&gt;U\in\mathcal{O}\,&lt;/math&gt;, for each &lt;math&gt;W\in\mathcal{O}^*\,&lt;/math&gt;; for which their sum constitutes a ''continuous'' function which is always finite non-zero (hence &lt;math&gt;1/f\,&lt;/math&gt; is continuous positive, finite-valued). So replacing each &lt;math&gt;f_{W}\,&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;f_{W}/f\,&lt;/math&gt;, we have now — all things remaining the same — that their sum is everywhere &lt;math&gt;1\,&lt;/math&gt;. Finally for &lt;math&gt;x\in X\,&lt;/math&gt;, letting &lt;math&gt;N\,&lt;/math&gt; be a neighbourhood of &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; meeting only finitely many sets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}^*\,&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;f_{W}\upharpoonright N=0\,&lt;/math&gt; for all but finitely many &lt;math&gt;W\in\mathcal{O}^*\,&lt;/math&gt; since each &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{supp}~f_{W}\subseteq W\,&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we have a partition of unity subordinate to the original open cover.

== Relationship with compactness ==

There is a similarity between the definitions of [[compact space|compactness]] and paracompactness:
For paracompactness, &quot;subcover&quot; is replaced by &quot;open refinement&quot; and &quot;finite&quot; by is replaced by &quot;locally finite&quot;. Both of these changes are significant: if we take the definition of paracompact and change &quot;open refinement&quot; back to &quot;subcover&quot;, or &quot;locally finite&quot; back to &quot;finite&quot;, we end up with the compact spaces in both cases.

Paracompactness has little to do with the notion of compactness, but rather more to do with breaking up topological space entities into manageable pieces.

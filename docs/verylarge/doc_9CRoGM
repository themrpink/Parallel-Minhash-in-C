With {{convert|319|acre|km2}} between the downtown [[Chicago Loop]] and [[Lake Michigan]], Grant Park offers many different attractions in its large open space. The park is generally flat. It is also crossed by large boulevards and even a bed of sunken railroad tracks.  While bridges are used to span the tracks, and to connect with Millennium Park, the rest of the park must be reached by pedestrians at traffic crossings, except for a spacious underpass connection to the Museum Campus. There are also several parking garages under the park, along Michigan Avenue and east of Columbus Drive.

When the park was landscaped in the early 20th century in a formal [[Beaux-Arts architecture|beaux arts]] style, tall [[Ulmus americana|American Elms]] were planted in allées and rectangular patterns.&lt;ref name=Mack&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-11-22/news/ct-met-elm-trees-grant-park-20101121_1_| newspaper=Chicago Tribune| first=Kristen| last=Mack| title=Volunteers want to survey, save elm trees of Grant Park| date=November 22, 2010|  accessdate=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While hundreds of these trees still exist, reaching {{convert|60|ft|m}} tall, they were devastated in the late 1970s by [[Dutch elm disease]].  Hybrid elms have since been used to replace those lost.

===Millennium Park===
The northwestern corner of the park was renovated from 1998 to 2004 to become [[Millennium Park]], a contiguous area with a variety of artistic features by architects and artists. Millennium Park features the [[Jay Pritzker Pavilion]], the ''[[Cloud Gate]]'' (aka ''The Bean''), the ''[[Crown Fountain]]'', the [[Lurie Garden]], and other attractions.&lt;ref name=LFC&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806EED71E3BF930A25754C0A9629C8B63| title=Letter From Chicago; A Prized Project, a Mayor and Persistent Criticism| accessdate=May 31, 2008| date=July 13, 2004| newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| last=Kinzer| first=Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park is connected by the [[BP Pedestrian Bridge]] and the [[Nichols Bridgeway]] to other portions of Grant Park.

===Maggie Daley Park===
Across the [[BP Pedestrian Bridge]] from Millennium Park, the northeast corner of Grant Park hosts outdoor and indoor activities at what is now [[Maggie Daley Park]], previously called Daley Bicentennial Plaza.&lt;ref name=Daley&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/parks.detail/object_id/21fa6a8a-700a-4206-8080-5fbcbebb108a.cfm| title=Daley Bicentennial Plaza| accessdate=August 29, 2008| publisher=[[Chicago Park District]]| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://archive.today/20080907174933/http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/parks.detail/object_id/21fa6a8a-700a-4206-8080-5fbcbebb108a.cfm| archivedate=September 7, 2008| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://chicago.metromix.com/events/community_venue/daley-bicentennial-plaza-grant-park-museums/142788/content| title=Daley Bicentennial Plaza| accessdate=July 29, 2008| journal=[[Metromix]]| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913015752/http://chicago.metromix.com/events/community_venue/daley-bicentennial-plaza-grant-park-museums/142788/content| archivedate=September 13, 2008| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Designed by landscape architect [[Michael Van Valkenburgh]], attractions here include summer and winter skating rinks, an extensive playground, climbing walls, tennis courts, and an activities building, which were redeveloped from 2012 to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-former-mayor-makes-appearance-at-maggie-daley-park-ribboncutting-20141213-story.html| title=Hundreds Attend Maggie Daley Park Ribbon-Cutting| accessdate=December 15, 2014| date=December 13, 2014| work=Chicago Tribune| last1=Rodriguez| first1=Meredith| first2=Bob| last2=Secter| first3=Marwa| last3=Eltagouri| name-list-style=amp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art Institute of Chicago===
Built in 1893 on the western edge of Grant Park, the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] is one of the premier art museums and art schools in the US, known especially for the extensive collection of [[Impressionist]] and American art, such as ''[[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte]]'', and [[Grant Wood]]'s ''[[American Gothic]]''.  The [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] has facilities in the southeast corner of the museum's complex.

===Buckingham Fountain===
The center piece of Grant Park is [[Buckingham Fountain]], one of the world's largest [[fountain]]s.&lt;ref name=Buckingham&gt;{{cite web| title=Buckingham Fountain| publisher=Chicago Park District| url=http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/buckinghamfountain.fountainhome| accessdate=February 28, 2011| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://archive.today/20060320101226/http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/buckinghamfountain.fountainhome| archivedate=March 20, 2006| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[rococo]] wedding cake style, the fountain was dedicated in 1927 as a gift to the city from [[Kate Sturges Buckingham]] in memory of her brother Clarence. The fountain operates from April to October with water displays every 20 minutes and a light and water display from 8:00 am to 11:00 pm.

===Museum Campus===
Chicago's [[Museum Campus]] is a {{convert|57|acre|ha|adj=on}} addition to Grant Park's southeastern end. The Museum Campus is the site of three of the city's most notable museums, all dedicated to the [[natural science]]s: [[Adler Planetarium]], [[Field Museum of Natural History]], and [[Shedd Aquarium]]. A narrow isthmus along Solidarity Drive dominated by [[neoclassical sculpture]]s of [[Tadeusz Kościuszko|Kościuszko]], [[Karel Havlíček Borovský|Havliček]] and [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] connects to [[Northerly Island]] where the planetarium is located to the east of the Museum Campus situated on the mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Graf| first=John| title=Chicago's Parks| publisher=Arcadia Publishing| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PYY7H6jcfPEC&amp;q=planetarium| year=2000| pages=13–14| isbn=978-0-7385-0716-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Petrillo Music Shell===
Located at Jackson and Columbus Drives, the [[Petrillo Music Shell]] hosts music performances during the Chicago Jazz Festival, Chicago Blues Festival, Taste of Chicago, and Lollapalooza. The music shell's seating area includes an area called Butler Field, the block bounded by [[Lake Shore Drive]], Columbus Drive, Monroe Drive, and Jackson Drive.  The previous Petrillo Bandshell structure faced Hutchinson Field at the south end of the park, near 1100 South Columbus Drive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Loop&quot;&gt;{{cite book| title=Then &amp; Now: Chicago's Loop|author1=Janice A.

===Congress Plaza===
Congress Plaza is a ceremonial entrance located on the park's western edge, at the [[Congress Parkway|Ida B. Wells Drive]] and [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] intersection .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://explorechicago.org/city/en/things_see_do/attractions/park_district/congress_plaza_gardens.html| title=Congress Plaza| publisher=City of Chicago| work=Explore Chicago| accessdate=November 5, 2011| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028091309/http://explorechicago.org/city/en/things_see_do/attractions/park_district/congress_plaza_gardens.html| archivedate=October 28, 2011| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two semicircular plazas flanking Ida B. Wells Drive contain gardens, fountains, and artwork, including a pair of large bronze warrior statues, [[The Bowman and The Spearman]] that are positioned like gatekeepers to the park.

===Gardens===
There are several gardens and flower displays throughout the park.  Millennium Park houses the [[Lurie Garden]], known for its display of tall grass flowers, particularly [[lavender]], and a decorative post-modern water stream. To the east, across the [[BP Pedestrian Bridge]], Daley Park holds tall grass plantings. To the northeast in Daley Park, at 375 East Randolph Drive, is the Richard &amp; Annette Bloch Cancer Survivors Garden, marked by two huge doric columns from the demolished [[Chicago Federal Building]] and a wrought-iron pergola. The garden contains numerous walkways lined with planters and is one of several similar spaces created nationwide by R. A. Bloch Cancer Foundation.&lt;ref name=&quot;bloch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Cancer Survivors Garden| url=http://www.explorechicago.org/city/en/things_see_do/attractions/park_district/cancer_survivors_garden.html| publisher=City of Chicago| accessdate=June 15, 2011| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623060352/http://www.explorechicago.org/city/en/things_see_do/attractions/park_district/cancer_survivors_garden.html| archivedate=June 23, 2011| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flanking the original [[Art Institute of Chicago Building]] are gardens in the north and south McCormick Courtyards; in the south courtyard is the bronze sculpture [[Fountain of the Great Lakes]]. To the south of the art museum, along Michigan Avenue, are a succession of gardens. Two of these are not far from to [[Orchestra Hall, Chicago|Orchestra Hall]] and honor former conductors of the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] ([[Georg Solti|Sir Georg Solti]] and [[Theodore Thomas (conductor)|Theodore Thomas]]).&lt;ref name=Solti&gt;{{cite web| title=Sir George Solti Garden| publisher=Public Art in Chicago| date=January 29, 2013| url=http://www.publicartinchicago.com/chicago-art-in-grant-park/| accessdate=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the southeast of the Art Institute, near the ''Court of Presidents'', are demonstration gardens that flank Ida B. Wells Drive and surrounding Buckingham Fountain are a series of formal gardens, including the Tiffany Celebration Garden to the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tiffany&quot;&gt;{{cite press release| title=Park District Announces the Grand Opening of &quot;The Tiffany &amp; Co.

===The Court of the Presidents===
The Court of the Presidents is located directly on the north and south side of E. Ida B. Wells Drive, west of S. Columbus Drive and east of S. Michigan Ave.&amp;nbsp;  Manicured gardens and  art work help define the Court of Presidents. South President's Court, until recently, has primarily been gardens. However, within the past decade the city has decided to use the area to showcase art work by Chicagoans. While unique artwork has long been a tradition of Chicago's parks, South President's Court had the added benefit of showcasing &quot;in house&quot; art as its first newsworthy collection, entitled &quot;Artist and Automobiles.&quot; The collection, organized by the Public Art Program and the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs, consisted of sculptures composed entirely of parts found on old automobiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Srivastava| first1=Jvoti| title=Chicago: Art In Grant Park| url=http://www.publicartinchicago.com/chicago-art-in-grant-park/| website=Public Art In Chicago| accessdate=September 30, 2014| date=January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hutchinson Field===
Much of the southern end of Grant Park is given over to Hutchinson Field, an open space for large events, with a dozen baseball or softball diamonds named for financier and long-time Art Institute President, [[Charles L. Hutchinson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Putre| first=Laura| title=Hutchinson Field emerging from Grant Park shadow| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-hutchinson-field-city-zonemar12,0,4673018.story| accessdate=July 2, 2011| newspaper=Chicago Tribune| date=March 12, 2009| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922103550/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-hutchinson-field-city-zonemar12,0,4673018.story| archivedate=September 22, 2010| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chicago Lakefront Trail===
A section of the [[Chicago Lakefront Trail]], an 18-mile [[multi-use path]] along the city's [[Lake Michigan]] shoreline, runs through the park's eastern edge. The trail runs adjacent to [[Lake Shore Drive]] from Randolph Drive to Balbo Drive, then along the very edge of the seawall around the Shedd Aquarium. An underpass carries the trail under Solidarity Drive into Burnham Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpdit01.com/resources/brochures/pdf/Lakefront%20Trail%20Map.pdf Chicago Park District Lakefront Trail Map] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708201147/http://www.cpdit01.com/resources/brochures/pdf/Lakefront%20Trail%20Map.pdf |date=July 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marinas and harbors===
Two Lake Michigan marinas are accessed from Grant Park. Monroe Harbor provides 1000 mooring cans (served by tender service) and facilities in the expansive harbor east of the park.&lt;ref name=Monroe&gt;{{cite web| title=Monroe Harbor| publisher=The Chicago Harbors| url=http://www.chicagoharbors.info/harbors/monroe.php| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719184905/http://www.chicagoharbors.info/harbors/monroe.php| archivedate=July 19, 2011| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is home to both the Chicago Yacht Club and the Columbia Yacht Club.  ''Queen's Landing,'' at the center of the harbor and park's shoreline, is named for a 1959 visit there by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] aboard the [[Royal Yacht]] ''[[HMY Britannia|Britannia]],'' in conjunction with the opening of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]].  Du Sable Harbor, created in 1999 north of Randolph Drive, offers 420 boat docks and a harbor store.&lt;ref name=Dusable&gt;{{cite web| publisher=The Chicago Harbors| title=DuSable Harbor| url=http://www.chicagoharbors.info/harbors/dusable.php| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719184955/http://www.chicagoharbors.info/harbors/dusable.php| archivedate=July 19, 2011| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skate Plaza===
The Grant Park Skate Plaza, designed by Chicago Landscape Architects Altamanu, was opened on December 6, 2014.  The Plaza was initiated by Grant Park Conservancy President, Robert O’Neill. The new park occupies {{convert|3|acre|m2}} and has replaced the former skate area near the tennis courts. The Conservancy sought planning support from local skateboarders and BMX bikers who formed the Grant Park Conservancy &amp; Advisory Council Skate Committee. The Plaza is located in the southwest corner of the park near the former site of the 1893 [[Central Station (Chicago terminal)|Central Station]] and includes limestone pieces from the former railroad terminal. The plaza cost $2.65 Million to build.&lt;ref name=LaTrace&gt;{{cite journal| title=The Brand New Grant Park Skate Park is Now Officially Open| last=LaTrace| first=AJ| url=http://chicago.curbed.com/archives/2014/12/08/the-brand-new-grant-park-skate-park-is-now-officially-open.php| journal=Curbed Chicago| date=December 8, 2014| accessdate=October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, the park hosted both the Mountain Dew Skate Tour for its first return to Chicago since 2010 and the Volcom Wild in the Parks Tour for its first appearance in Chicago.&lt;ref name=volcom&gt;{{cite web| title=Stop #5 of Volcom's Wild in the Parks – Grant Park Skatepark – Chicago, IL| url=http://www.volcom.com/news/stop-5-of-volcoms-wild-in-the-parks-grant-park-skatepark-chicago-il/| website=Volcom| date=July 30, 2015| accessdate=October 14, 2015| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007141905/http://www.volcom.com/news/stop-5-of-volcoms-wild-in-the-parks-grant-park-skatepark-chicago-il/| archivedate=October 7, 2015| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dew&gt;{{cite web| title=Mountain Dew Skate Tour Takes Shape in Grant Park| last=Matthews| first=David| date=June 19, 2015| url=http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20150619/downtown/mountain-dew-skate-tour-takes-shape-grant-park| website=DNAinfo Chicago| accessdate=October 14, 2015| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016064142/http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20150619/downtown/mountain-dew-skate-tour-takes-shape-grant-park| archivedate=October 16, 2015| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dog park===
Grant Bark Park, located on the corner of Columbus Drive and 11th Street, is a place for dogs to get their exercise. It's an off-leash park of {{convert|18000|sqft}}. The park is made of asphalt and pea gravel. Members pay a monthly fee to attend the park that helps with the upkeep and maintains the cleanliness. A water fountain for both dogs and humans is provided. Membership fees and any donations go toward maintenance. The park hosts benefits and events related to dogs to raise money as well.&lt;ref name=SouthPAC&gt;{{cite web| title=Grant Park Bark| url=http://southloopdogpac.org/south-loop-dog-parks/grant-bark-park/| publisher=South Loop Dog Park Action Cooperative| accessdate=October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=K9friendly&gt;{{cite web| title=Dog Friendly Areas| url=http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/facilities/dog-friendly-areas/| publisher=Chicago Park District| accessdate=October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leashed dogs are permitted in most areas of the park, but not in [[Millennium Park]].

===Other facilities===
The shaded walking paths in Grant Park cover several miles. A circuit of the park's walking paths is estimated to take 4 miles (6.4&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.scientificsessions-365.com/Assets/AHA/PDFs/5_BikeWalkTrails.pdf |title=City Guide: Chicago Bike/Walking Trails |accessdate=May 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110051125/http://www.scientificsessions-365.com/Assets/AHA/PDFs/5_BikeWalkTrails.pdf |archivedate=November 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For other sporting activities, the park has 16 [[softball]]/[[baseball]] fields and 12 [[tennis]] courts, open to the general public.

==Public art==
The park holds a great deal of public art, much of it sculpture, in many areas including in Millennium Park, near Buckingham Fountain, the several gardens, and Congress Plaza.  Four individual large installations, in other areas of the park, include:

===''Abraham Lincoln Monument''===
''[[Abraham Lincoln: The Head of State]]'' is a statue by sculptor [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] set in a 150-foot wide [[exedra]] by architect [[Stanford White]], honoring the Illinois resident and 16th President of the United States.  The statue was cast in 1908 and was displayed at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and at the 1915 [[San Francisco World's Fair]], prior to being installed in the park in 1926.  It is located in the ''Court of Presidents,'' north of Ida B. Wells Drive and west of Columbus Drive and is frequently called ''Seated Lincoln'' to avoid confusion with Saint-Gaudens' 1887 sculpture ''[[Abraham Lincoln: The Man]]'' in Lincoln Park.

===''Agora''===
''[[Agora (sculpture)|Agora]]'' (from Greek, for urban meeting place) is an installation of 106 headless, armless sculptures designed by the Polish artist [[Magdalena Abakanowicz]] in southwestern Grant Park near [[Roosevelt Road]].  The piece was brought to the park in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;Agora&quot;&gt;{{cite news| first=Noreen S.| last=Ahmed| title=Walking among iron giants; Gift to Grant Park 'not a decoration'| newspaper=Chicago Tribune| date=October 27, 2006| page=1| via=[[HighBeam Research]]| url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-153422041.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106051942/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-153422041.html| url-status=dead| archive-date=November 6, 2012| accessdate=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figures are {{convert|9|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall and weigh approximately {{convert|1800|lb|abbr=on}}.

The '''School of the Art Institute of Chicago''' ('''SAIC''') is a private university associated with the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] (AIC) in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. Tracing its history to an art students' cooperative founded in 1866, which grew into the museum and school, SAIC has been accredited since 1936 by the [[Higher Learning Commission]], by the [[National Association of Schools of Art and Design]] since 1944 (charter member), and by the [[Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design]] (AICAD) since the associations founding in 1991. Additionally it is accredited by the [[National Architectural Accrediting Board]]. In a 2002 survey conducted by Columbia University's National Arts Journalism Program, SAIC was named the “most influential art school” in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbia_2002&quot;&gt;{{Cite report |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/najp/publications/researchreports/tvac.pdf |title=The Visual Arts Critic |last=Szántó |first=András |date=2002 |publisher=NAJP/Columbia University|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:School of the Art Institute Chicago Grant Park.JPG|thumb|300px|The school's [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], Columbus Avenue, building, attached to the museum, houses a premier gallery showcase.]]

Its downtown Chicago campus consists of seven buildings located in the immediate vicinity of the [[Art Institute of Chicago Building|AIC building]]. SAIC is in an equal partnership with the AIC and share many administrative resources such as design, construction, and human resources. The campus, located in [[Chicago Loop|the Loop]], comprises chiefly five main buildings: the McLean Center (112 S. Michigan Ave.), the Michigan building (116 S Michigan Ave),  the Sharp (36 S. Wabash Ave.), Sullivan Center (37 S. Wabash Ave.), and the Columbus (280 S. Columbus Dr.). SAIC also holds classes in the [[Spertus Institute for Jewish Learning and Leadership|Spertus]] building at 610 S. Michigan. SAIC owns additional buildings throughout Chicago that are used as student galleries or investments. There are three dormitory facilities: [[The Buckingham (Chicago)|The Buckingham]], Jones Hall, and 162 N State Street residencies.

== History ==
The institute has its roots in the 1866 founding of the '''Chicago Academy of Design''', which local artists established in rented rooms on Clark Street.  It was financed by member dues and patron donations. Four years later, the school moved into its own Adams Street building, which was destroyed in the [[Great Chicago Fire of 1871]].

Because of the school's financial and managerial problems after this loss, business leaders in 1878 formed a [[Board of directors|board of trustees]] and founded the '''Chicago Academy of Fine Arts'''.  They expanded its mission beyond education and exhibitions to include collecting. In 1882, the academy was renamed the Art Institute of Chicago.  The banker [[Charles L. Hutchinson]] served as its elected president until his death in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2005 |title=Art Institute of Chicago |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Chicago |publisher=Chicago Historical Society and Newberry Library |url=http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/79.html |last=Dillon |first=Diane |editor-last=Reiff|editor-first=Janice L.|editor2-last=Keating |editor2-first=Ann Durkin |editor3-last=Grossman |editor3-first=James R. |edition=Electronic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school grew to become among the &quot;most influential&quot; art schools in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2005 |title=Artists, Education and Culture of |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Chicago |publisher=Chicago Historical Society and Newberry Library |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/83.html |last=Roeder, Jr. |first=George H. |editor-last=Reiff|editor-first=Janice L.|editor2-last=Keating |editor2-first=Ann Durkin |editor3-last=Grossman |editor3-first=James R. |edition=Electronic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

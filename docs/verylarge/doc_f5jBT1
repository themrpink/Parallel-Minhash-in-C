Both Korean and Chinese legends, including reports in the ''Book of Documents'' and the ''Bamboo Annals'', state that a disgruntled Shang prince named [[Jizi]], who had refused to cede power to the Zhou, left China with a small army. According to these legends, he founded a state known as [[Gija Joseon]] in northwest Korea during the [[Gojoseon]] period of ancient Korean history. However, scholars debate the historical accuracy of these legends.

Before the 20th century, the [[Zhou dynasty]] (1046–256&amp;nbsp;BC) was the earliest Chinese dynasty that could be verified from its own records.  However, during the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279 AD), [[antiquarian]]s collected [[bronze]] ritual vessels attributed to the Shang era, some of which bore inscriptions.{{sfnp|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=33}}

=== Yellow River valley ===
In 1899, several scholars noticed that Chinese pharmacists were selling &quot;[[Oracle bone|dragon bones]]&quot; marked with curious and archaic characters.{{sfnp|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=33}} These were finally traced back in 1928 to a site (now called [[Yinxu]]) near [[Anyang]], north of the [[Yellow River]] in modern [[Henan]] province, where the [[Academia Sinica]] undertook archeological excavation until the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion]] in 1937.{{sfnp|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=33}}

Archaeologists focused on the Yellow River valley in Henan as the most likely site of the states described in the traditional histories.
After 1950, the remnants of the earlier walled settlement of [[Zhengzhou Shang City|Shang City]] were discovered near [[Zhengzhou]].{{sfnp|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=33}}
It has been determined that the earth walls at Zhengzhou, erected in the 15th century&amp;nbsp;BC, would have been {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide at the base, rising to a height of {{convert|8|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and formed a roughly rectangular wall {{convert|7|km|mi|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} around the ancient city.{{sfnp|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=34}}&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 4 part 3 43&quot;&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The rammed earth construction of these walls was an inherited tradition, since much older fortifications of this type have been found at Chinese [[Neolithic]] sites of the [[Longshan culture]] {{nowrap|(c. 3000–2000 BC)}}.{{sfnp|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=34}}

In 1959, the site of the [[Erlitou culture]] was found in Yanshi, south of the Yellow River near [[Luoyang]].{{sfnp|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=34}} [[Radiocarbon dating]] suggests that the Erlitou culture flourished ca. 2100&amp;nbsp;BC to 1800&amp;nbsp;BC. They built large palaces, suggesting the existence of an organized state.{{sfnp|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|pp=34–35}}
In 1983, [[Yanshi Shang City]] was discovered {{convert|6|km|mi}} north-east of the Erlitou site in Yanshi's Shixianggou Township. This was a large walled city dating from 1600&amp;nbsp;BC. It had an area of nearly {{convert|200|ha|acres}} and featured pottery characteristic of the [[Erligang culture]].

The remains of a walled city of about {{convert|470|ha}} were discovered in 1999 across the [[Huan River]] from the well explored Yinxu site.  The city, now known as [[Huanbei]], was apparently occupied for less than a century and destroyed shortly before the construction of the Yinxu complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Chinese historians were accustomed to the notion of one dynasty succeeding another, and readily identified the Erligang and Erlitou sites with the early Shang and [[Xia dynasty]] of traditional histories.
The actual political situation in early China may have been more complicated, with the Xia and Shang being political entities that existed concurrently, just as the early [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]], who established the successor state of the Shang, are known to have existed at the same time as the Shang.{{sfnp|Sun|2006}} It has also been suggested the Xia legend originated as a Shang myth of an earlier people who were their opposites.{{sfnp|Allan|1991|p=63}}

=== Other sites ===
The [[Erligang culture]] centred on the Zhengzhou site is found across a wide area of China, even as far northeast as the area of modern [[Beijing]], where at least one burial in this region during this period contained both Erligang-style [[bronze]] utensils and local-style [[gold]] jewelry.{{sfnp|Sun|2006}}  The discovery of a [[Chenggu]]-style ''ge'' [[dagger-axe]] at Xiaohenan demonstrates that even at this early stage of Chinese history, there were some ties between the distant areas of north China.{{sfnp|Sun|2006}}
The [[Panlongcheng]] site in the middle [[Yangtze valley]] was an important regional center of the [[Erligang culture]].{{sfnp|Bagley|1999|pp=168–171}}

Accidental finds elsewhere in China have revealed advanced civilizations contemporaneous with but culturally unlike the settlement at Anyang, such as the walled city of [[Sanxingdui]] in Sichuan. Western scholars are hesitant to designate such settlements as belonging to the Shang dynasty.{{sfnp|Bagley|1999|pp=124–125}} Also unlike the Shang, there is no known evidence that the Sanxingdui culture had a system of writing.  The late Shang state at Anyang is thus generally considered the first verifiable civilization in Chinese history.{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|p=232}}

In contrast, the earliest layers of the [[Wucheng culture|Wucheng site]], pre-dating Anyang, have yielded pottery fragments containing short sequences of symbols, suggesting that they may be a form of writing quite different in form from [[oracle bone script|oracle bone characters]], but the sample is too small for decipherment.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2013|p=669}}{{sfnp|Wagner|1993|p=20}}{{sfnp|Cheung|1983}}

===Genetic studies===
A study of [[mitochondrial DNA]] (inherited in the maternal line) from Yinxu graves showed similarity with modern northern [[Han Chinese]], but significant differences from southern Han Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/5297877

==Absolute chronology==
The earliest securely dated event in Chinese history is the start of the [[Gonghe Regency]] in 841 BC, early in the [[Zhou dynasty]], a date first established by the [[Han dynasty]] historian [[Sima Qian]].  Attempts to establish earlier dates have been plagued by doubts about the origin and transmission of traditional texts and the difficulties in their interpretation.  More recent attempts have compared the traditional histories with archaeological and astronomical data.{{sfnp|Lee|2002|pp=16–17}}
At least 44 dates for the end of the dynasty have been proposed, ranging from 1130 BC to 1018 BC.{{sfnp|Lee|2002|p=32}}

* The traditional dates of the dynasty, from 1766 BC to 1122 BC, were calculated by [[Liu Xin (scholar)|Liu Xin]] during the Han dynasty.{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|p=248}}
* A calculation based on the &quot;old text&quot; of the ''[[Bamboo Annals]]'' yields dates of 1523 BC to 1027 BC.{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|p=248}}
* David Pankenier, by attempting to identify astronomical events mentioned in Zhou texts, dated the beginning of the dynasty at 1554 BC and its overthrow at 1046 BC.{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|p=248}}
* The [[Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project]] identified the establishment of the dynasty with the foundation of an [[Erligang culture]] walled city at [[Yanshi]], dated at c. 1600 BC.{{sfnp|Lee|2002|p=28}}  The project also arrived at an end date of 1046 BC, based on a combination of the astronomical evidence considered by Pankenier and dating of archaeological layers.{{sfnp|Lee|2002|pp=31–34}}

==Late Shang at Anyang==
[[File:Oracle bones pit.JPG|thumb|right|Oracle bones pit at Yin]]
The oldest extant direct records date from approximately 1250&amp;nbsp;BC at Anyang, covering the reigns of the last nine Shang kings.
The Shang had a fully developed system of writing, preserved on [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|bronze inscriptions]] and a small number of other writings on pottery, jade and other stones, horn, etc., but most prolifically on [[oracle bones]].{{sfnp|Qiu|2000|p=60}} The complexity and sophistication of this writing system indicates an earlier period of development, but direct evidence of that development is still lacking.
Other advances included the invention of many musical instruments and celestial observations of [[Mars]] and various [[comet]]s by Shang astronomers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kerr|first=Gordon|title=A Short History of China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=URV4e7IDaKYC&amp;pg=PT3|year=2013|publisher=Oldcastle Books|isbn=978-1-84243-969-2|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their civilization was based on [[agriculture]] and augmented by [[hunting]] and [[animal husbandry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PoI&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Beck | first = Roger B. |author2=Linda Black |author3=Larry S.

In addition to war, the Shang also practiced [[human sacrifice]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NGC&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.slashcontrol.com/free-tv-shows/ngc-presents/4006945677-shang-dynasty-human-sacrifice| title=Shang Dynasty Human Sacrifice|last=Flad|first=Dr. Rowan |date=28 February 2010| work= NGC Presents| publisher=National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cowry|Cowry shells]] were also excavated at [[Anyang]], suggesting trade with coast-dwellers, but there was very limited sea trade since China was isolated from other large civilizations during the Shang period.{{sfnp|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=35}} Trade relations and diplomatic ties with other formidable powers via the [[Silk Road]] and Chinese voyages to the Indian Ocean did not exist until the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu]] during the [[Han dynasty]] (206&amp;nbsp;BC – 221 AD).{{sfnp|Sun|1989|pp=161–167}}{{sfnp|Chen|2002|pp=67–71}}

===Court life===
[[File:Shang_dynasty_inscribed_tortoise_plastron.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Oracle shell with inscriptions.]]
[[File:Tomb Fu Hao YinXu.jpg|thumb|right|Bronzewares from the excavated [[tomb of Fu Hao]]]]
At the excavated royal palace of [[Yinxu]], large stone pillar bases were found along with [[rammed earth]] foundations and platforms, which according to Fairbank, were &quot;as hard as cement&quot;.{{sfnp|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=33}}  These foundations in turn originally supported 53 buildings of wooden [[timber framing|post-and-beam]] construction.{{sfnp|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=33}} In close proximity to the main palatial complex, there were underground pits used for storage, servants' quarters, and housing quarters.{{sfnp|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=33}}

Many Shang royal tombs had been tunneled into and ravaged by [[Grave robbing|grave robbers]] in ancient times,{{sfnp|Thorp|1981|p=239}} but in the spring of 1976, the [[Tomb of Fu Hao|discovery of Tomb 5]] at Yinxu revealed a tomb that was not only undisturbed, but one of the most richly furnished Shang tombs that archaeologists had yet come across.{{sfnp|Thorp|1981|p=240}} With over 200 bronze ritual vessels and 109 inscriptions of [[Fu Hao|Lady Fu Hao]]'s name, [[Zheng Zhenxiang]] and other archaeologists realized they had stumbled across the tomb of [[Wu Ding|King Wu Ding]]'s most famous consort, Fu Hao, who is mentioned in 170 to 180 Shang oracle bone inscriptions, and who was also renowned as a military general.{{sfnp|Thorp|1981|pp=240, 245}} Along with bronze vessels, [[stoneware]] and pottery vessels, bronze weapons, [[Chinese jade|jade]] figures and hair combs, and bone hairpins were found.{{sfnp|Thorp|1981|pp=242, 245}}{{sfnp|Li|1980|pp=393–394}}{{sfnp|Lerner|Murck|Ford|Hearn|1985|p=77}} The archaeological team argue that the large assortment of weapons and ritual vessels in her tomb correlate with the oracle bone accounts of her military and ritual activities.{{sfnp|Thorp|1981|p=245}}

The capital was the center of court life. Over time, court rituals to appease spirits developed, and in addition to his secular duties, the king would serve as the head of the [[ancestor worship]] cult. Often, the king would even perform oracle bone divinations himself, especially near the end of the dynasty. Evidence from excavations of the royal tombs indicates that royalty were buried with articles of value, presumably for use in the afterlife. Perhaps for the same reason, hundreds of commoners, who may have been [[Slavery|slave]]s, were buried alive with the royal corpse.

A line of hereditary Shang kings ruled over much of northern China, and Shang troops fought frequent wars with neighboring settlements and nomadic herdsmen from the inner Asian [[steppe]]s. The Shang king, in his oracular divinations, repeatedly showed concern about the ''fang'' groups, the barbarians living outside of the civilized ''tu'' regions, which made up the center of Shang territory.{{Clarify|reason=are tu areas all of Shang or only the Shang heartland?|date=September 2010}}  In particular, the ''tufang'' group of the [[Yan Mountains|Yanshan]] region were regularly mentioned as hostile to the Shang.{{sfnp|Sun|2006}}

Apart from their role as the head military commanders, Shang kings also asserted their social supremacy by acting as the high priests of society and leading the divination ceremonies.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=14}} As the oracle bone texts reveal, the Shang kings were viewed as the best qualified members of society to offer sacrifices to their royal ancestors and to the high god [[Shangdi|Di]], who in their beliefs was responsible for the rain, wind, and thunder.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=14}}

The King appointed officials to manage certain activities, usually in a specified area. These included field (agricultural) officials 田, pastors 牧, dog officers 犬 (hunting), and guards 衛. These officers led their own retinues in the conduct of their duties, and some grew more independent and emerged as rulers of their own.  There was a basic system of bureaucracy in place, with references to positions such as the &quot;Many Dog officers&quot;, &quot;Many horse officers&quot;, the &quot;Many Artisans&quot;, the &quot;Many Archers&quot; or court titles like &quot;Junior Servitor for Cultivation&quot; or &quot;Junior Servitor for labourers&quot;. More distant rulers were known as marquess 侯 or count 伯, who sometimes provided tribute and support to the Shang King in exchange for military aid and augury services. However these alliances were unstable, as indicated by the frequent royal divinations about the sustainability of such relations. {{sfnp|Keightley|1999|pp=272-273, 286}}

===Religion===
[[File:Shang bronze masks, 16-14th.JPG|thumb|Chinese Shang dynasty bronze face masks, 16th–14th century BC]]
Shang religious rituals featured divination and sacrifice.  The degree to which [[shamanism]] was a central aspect of Shang religion is a subject of debate.{{sfnp|Chang|1994}}{{sfnp|Keightley|1998}}

There were six main recipients of sacrifice: (1) Di (the High God), (2) nature powers like the sun and mountain powers, (3) former lords, deceased humans who had been added to the dynastic pantheon, (4) pre-dynastic ancestors, (5) dynastic ancestors, and (6) royal wives who were ancestors of the present king.{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|pp=253–254}}

The Shang believed that their ancestors held power over them and performed divination rituals to secure their approval for planned actions.{{sfnp|Keightley|2004}}  Divination involved cracking a turtle carapace or ox scapula to answer a question, and to then record the response to that question on the bone itself.{{sfnp|Chang|1994}}  It is unknown what criteria the diviners used to determine the response, but it is believed to be the sound or pattern of the cracks on the bone. {{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The Shang also seem to have believed in an afterlife, as evidenced by the elaborate burial tombs built for deceased rulers.  Often &quot;carriages, utensils, sacrificial vessels, [and] weapons&quot; would be included in the tomb.{{sfnp|Smith|1961}}  A king's burial involved the burial of up to several hundred humans and horses as well to accompany the king into the afterlife, in some cases even numbering four hundred.{{sfnp|Smith|1961}}  Finally, tombs included ornaments such as jade, which the Shang may have believed to protect against decay or confer immortality.

The Shang religion was highly bureaucratic and meticulously ordered.  Oracle bones contained descriptions of the date, ritual, person, ancestor, and questions associated with the divination.{{sfnp|Chang|1994}}  Tombs displayed highly ordered arrangements of bones, with groups of skeletons laid out facing the same direction.

===Bronze working===
{{main|Chinese ritual bronzes}}
[[File:Bronze square ding (cauldron) with human faces.jpg|thumb|right|Shang dynasty bronze vessel ding (sacrificial vessel)]]
Chinese bronze casting and pottery advanced during the Shang dynasty, with bronze typically being used for ritually significant, rather than primarily utilitarian, items.
As far back as c. 1500&amp;nbsp;BC, the early Shang dynasty engaged in large-scale production of [[bronze]]-ware vessels and weapons.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=17}} This production required a large labor force that could handle the mining, refining, and transportation of the necessary [[copper]], [[tin]], and [[lead]] ores. This in turn created a need for official managers that could oversee both hard-laborers and skilled artisans and craftsmen.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=17}} The Shang royal court and aristocrats required a vast number of different bronze vessels for various ceremonial purposes and events of religious [[divination]].{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=17}}  Ceremonial rules even decreed how many bronze containers of each type a nobleman or noblewoman of a certain rank could own. With the increased amount of bronze available, the army could also better equip itself with an assortment of bronze weaponry. Bronze was also used for the fittings of [[spoke]]-wheeled [[Chariot (Ancient China)|chariot]]s, which appeared in China around 1200&amp;nbsp;BC.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=14}}

===Military===
[[File:CMOC Treasures of Ancient China exhibit - bronze battle axe.jpg|thumb|right|A bronze [[axe]] of the Shang dynasty]]
Bronze weapons were an integral part of Shang society.{{sfnp|Sawyer|Sawyer|1994}} 
Shang infantry were armed with a variety of stone and bronze weaponry, including ''máo'' (矛) spears, ''yuè'' (鉞) pole-axes, ''gē'' (戈) pole-based [[dagger-axe]]s, composite bows, and bronze or leather helmets.{{sfnp|Wang|1993}}{{sfnp|Sawyer|Sawyer|1994|p=35}}

The [[chariot]] first appeared in China around 1200 BC, during the reign of Wu Ding. There is little doubt that the chariot entered China through the Central Asia and the Northern Steppe, possibly indicating some form of contact with the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]].{{sfnp|Shaughnessy|1988|p=190}} Recent archaeological finds have shown that the late Shang used horses, chariots, bows and practiced [[horse burial]]s that are similar to the steppe peoples to the west.{{sfnp|Mair|2011|p=100}} These influences led [[Christopher I. Beckwith]] to speculate that Indo-Europeans &quot;may even have been responsible for the foundation of the Shang Dynasty&quot;, though he admits there is no direct evidence.{{sfnp|Beckwith|2009|pp=43–48}} Oracle bone inscriptions suggest that the Shang used chariots in royal hunts and in battle only as mobile command vehicles.{{sfnp|Shaughnessy|1988|pp=213–221}} In contrast, the western enemies of the Shang, such as the Zhou, began to use limited numbers of chariots in battle towards the end of the Shang period.{{sfnp|Shaughnessy|1988|pp=218–221}}

Although the Shang depended upon the military skills of their nobility, Shang rulers could mobilize the masses of town-dwelling and rural commoners as conscript laborers and soldiers for both campaigns of defense and conquest.{{sfnp|Sawyer|Sawyer|1994|p=33}}  Aristocrats and other state rulers were obligated to furnish their local garrisons with all necessary equipment, armor, and armaments. The Shang king maintained a force of about a thousand troops at his capital and would personally lead this force into battle.{{sfnp|Sawyer|Sawyer|1994|p=34}} A rudimentary military bureaucracy was also needed in order to muster forces ranging from three to five thousand troops for border campaigns to thirteen thousand troops for suppressing rebellions.

== Kings ==
{{Main list|List of rulers of China#Shang dynasty|Family tree of ancient Chinese emperors#Shang dynasty}}
{{anchor|list|kings|king list|emperors}}

The earliest records are the [[oracle bone]]s inscribed during the reigns of the Shang kings from [[Wu Ding]].{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2013|p=684}}
The oracle bones do not contain king lists, but they do record the sacrifices to previous kings and the ancestors of the current king, which follow a standard schedule that scholars have reconstructed. From this evidence, scholars have assembled the implied king list and genealogy, finding that it is in substantial agreement with the later accounts, especially for later kings.{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|p=235}}
According to this implied king list, Wu Ding was the twenty-first Shang king.{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|p=235}}

The Shang kings were referred to in the oracle bones by [[posthumous name]]s.
The last character of each name is one of the 10 [[celestial stem]]s, which also denoted the day of the 10-day Shang week on which sacrifices would be offered to that ancestor within the ritual schedule.
There were more kings than stems, so the names have distinguishing prefixes such as 大 ''Dà'' (greater), 中 ''Zhōng'' (middle), 小 ''Xiǎo'' (lesser), 卜 ''Bǔ'' (outer), 祖 ''Zǔ'' (ancestor) and a few more obscure names.{{sfnp|Smith|2011|pp=3–5}}

The kings, in the order of succession derived from the oracle bones, are here grouped by generation.  Later reigns were assigned to oracle bone diviner groups by [[Dong Zuobin]]:{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|pp=234–235, 240–241}}

{{History of China |BC=1}}
The '''Xia dynasty'''&lt;!--Chinese already included in the infobox; see WP:MOS-ZH--&gt; is the first dynasty in traditional [[Chinese historiography]]. According to tradition, the Xia dynasty was established by the legendary [[Yu the Great]], after [[Emperor Shun|Shun]], the last of the [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors|Five Emperors]], gave the throne to him.&lt;ref&gt;Mungello, David E. ''The Great Encounter of China and the West, 1500–1800'' Rowman &amp; Littlefield; 3 ed (28 March 2009) {{ISBN|978-0-7425-5798-7}} p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; In the traditional historiography, the Xia was later succeeded by the [[Shang dynasty]].

There are no contemporaneous records of the Xia, and they are not mentioned in the oldest Chinese texts, since the earliest [[oracle bone]] inscriptions date from the late [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] period (13th century BC). The earliest mentions occur in the oldest chapters of the ''[[Book of Documents]]'', which report speeches from the early [[Western Zhou]] period, and are accepted by most scholars as dating from that time. These speeches justify the Zhou conquest of the Shang as the passing of the [[Mandate of Heaven]], likening it to the succession of the Xia by the Shang. This political philosophy was promoted by the [[Confucian]] school in the [[Eastern Zhou]] period. The succession of dynasties was incorporated into the ''[[Bamboo Annals]]'' and the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', and became the official position of [[Chinese historiography|imperial historiography]] and ideology. Some scholars consider the Xia dynasty mythical, or at least unsubstantiated, while others identify it with the archaeological [[Erlitou culture]].

According to the traditional chronology based upon calculations by [[Liu Xin (scholar)|Liu Xin]], the Xia ruled between 2205 and 1766 BC; according to the chronology based upon the ''[[Bamboo Annals]]'', it ruled between 1989 and 1558 BC. The [[Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project]], commissioned by the Chinese government in 1996, concluded that the Xia existed between 2070 and 1600 BC.

==Traditional accounts==
The Xia dynasty was described in classic texts such as the ''[[Classic of History]]'' (''Shujing''), the ''[[Bamboo Annals]]'', and the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (''Shiji'') by [[Sima Qian]].  According to tradition, the [[Huaxia]] were the ancestral people of the [[Han Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Cioffi-Revilla | first=Claudio | year=1995 | title=War and Politics in Ancient China, 2700 BC to 722 BC | journal=The Journal of Conflict Resolution | volume=39 | issue=3 | pages=471–472 |author2=Lai, David | doi=10.1177/0022002795039003004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Lung | first=Rachel | title=Interpreters in early imperial China | year=2011 | publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company | location=Amsterdam | page=5 | isbn=978-90-272-2444-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins and early development===
Traditional histories trace the development of the Xia to the legendary [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors]]. According to ancient Chinese texts, before the Xia dynasty was established, battles were frequent between the Xia tribe and [[Chi You]]'s tribe. The Xia tribe slowly developed around the time of [[Zhuanxu]], one of the Five Emperors. The [[Records of the Grand Historian]] and the [[Classic of Rites]] say that [[Yu the Great]] is the grandson of Zhuanxu, but there are also other records, like [[Ban Gu]], that say Yu is the fifth generation of Zhuanxu. Based on this, tradition ascribes the ancestry of the Xia clan to Zhuanxu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ancient-origins.net/myths-legends/gun-yu-and-chinese-flood-myth-00370|title=Gun-Yu and the Chinese Flood Myth|last=aprilholloway|work=Ancient Origins|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source needed|date=July 2020}}

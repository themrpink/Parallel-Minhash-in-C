=== Critical response ===
''Rocky'' received positive reviews at the time of its release. [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave it 4 out of 4 stars and said that Stallone reminded him of &quot;the young [[Marlon Brando]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date= January 1, 1977 &lt;!-- although the online version says 1976, it was actually 1977 --&gt; |title = Rocky Movie Review &amp; Film Summary | first=Roger | last=Ebert | author-link=Roger Ebert | url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/rocky-1976 | access-date=October 9, 2017 | newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | via=RogerEbert.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Box Office Magazine'' claimed that audiences would be &quot;touting Sylvester 'Sly' Stallone as a new star&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=1976-11-22 |title=Box Office Magazine Rocky Review |url=http://www.boxoffice.com/scripts/fiw.dll?GetReview?&amp;where=ID&amp;terms=4828 |accessdate=2006-09-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051123101307/http://www.boxoffice.com/scripts/fiw.dll?GetReview%3F&amp;where=ID&amp;terms=4828 |archive-date=November 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Arizona Daily Star Review |url=http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=107744&amp;section=pressQuote |accessdate= 2006-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Rich]] liked the film, calling it &quot;almost 100 per cent [[schmaltz]],&quot; but favoring it over the cynicism that was prevalent in movies at that time, although he referred to the plot as &quot;gimmicky&quot; and the script &quot;heavy-handed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Rich. ''[[The New York Post]]'' November 22, 1976.  p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Several reviews, including [[Richard Eder]]'s (as well as Canby's negative review), compared the work to that of [[Frank Capra]].

The film, however, did not escape criticism. [[Vincent Canby]], of ''[[The New York Times]]'', called it &quot;pure '30s make believe&quot; and dismissed both Stallone's acting and Avildsen's directing, calling the latter &quot;none too decisive&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date = November 22, 1976|accessdate = September 23, 2006|url=http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/movies/bestpictures/rocky-re.html|archive-url = https://www.nytimes.com/1976/11/22/archives/film-rocky-pure-30s-makebelieve.html|archive-date=November 22, 1976 |title = Film: 'Rocky,' Pure 30's Make-Believe |work = The New York Times|first = Vincent |last = Canby |author-link=Vincent Canby  |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Sarris]] found the Capra comparisons disingenuous: &quot;Capra's movies projected more despair deep down than a movie like ''Rocky'' could envisage, and most previous ring movies have been much more cynical about the fight scene,&quot; and, commenting on Rocky's work as a loan shark, says that the film &quot;teeters on the edge of sentimentalizing gangsters.&quot;  Sarris also found Meredith &quot;oddly cast in the kind of part the late [[James Gleason]] used to pick his teeth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Village Voice]]'' November 22, 1976, p.61&lt;/ref&gt;

Four decades later, the film enjoys a reputation as a classic and still receives nearly universal praise; ''Rocky'' holds a 94% &quot;Certified Fresh&quot; rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 65 reviews, with an average rating of 8.52/10. The site's consensus states: &quot;This story of a down-on-his-luck boxer is thoroughly predictable, but Sylvester Stallone's script and stunning performance in the title role brush aside complaints.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Rocky |website=Rotten Tomatoes| url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1017776-rocky/| accessdate = October 2, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the positive online reviews came from the [[BBC]] Films website, with both reviewer Almar Haflidason and BBC online users giving it 5/5 stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/03/12/rocky_1976_review.shtml|title = Rocky @ BBC Films|accessdate=2006-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Steven J. Schneider's ''1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die'', Schneider says the film is &quot;often overlooked as schmaltz.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Schneider| first = Stephen Jay | title = 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die |publisher = New Burlington Books|year= 2005 |location = London, England| page = 615| edition = Revised }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, ''Rocky'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/07012/film.html |title=Librarian Adds 25 Titles to Film Preservation List: National Film Registry 2006 |publisher=Library of Congress.gov |accessdate=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2745890220061229 |title=''Rocky'', ''Fargo'' join National Film Registry |work=Reuters |date= 2006-12-28|accessdate=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Directors Guild of America]] awarded ''Rocky'' its [[Directors Guild of America Award|annual award]] for best film of the year in 1976, and in 2006, Sylvester Stallone's original screenplay for ''Rocky'' was selected for the [[Writers Guild of America Award]] as the 78th best screenplay of all time.&lt;ref name=Screenplay&gt;{{cite web|title=The 101 Best Screenplays |author=Writers Guild of America, West |url=http://www.wga.org/subpage_newsevents.aspx?id=1807 |accessdate=2006-08-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813151310/http://www.wga.org/subpage_newsevents.aspx?id=1807 |archive-date=August 13, 2006 |author-link=Writers Guild of America, West }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, AFI revealed its &quot;[[AFI's 10 Top 10|Ten top Ten]]&quot;—the best ten films in ten &quot;classic&quot; American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. ''Rocky'' was acknowledged as the second-best film in the sports genre, after ''[[Raging Bull]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = AFI Crowns Top 10 Films in 10 Classic Genres | work = ComingSoon.net | date = 2008-06-17 | url = http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=46072 | accessdate= 2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Top 10 Sports | url = http://www.afi.com/10top10/sports.html | publisher= [[American Film Institute]] |accessdate= 2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' polled hundreds of Academy members, asking them to re-vote on past controversial decisions. Academy members indicated that, given a second chance, they would award the 1977 Oscar for Best Picture to ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]'' instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/recount-oscar-voters-today-would-773522|title=Recount!

=== Sequel ===
{{Main|Rocky II}}
A sequel titled ''Rocky II'', was released in 1979.

=== Possible prequel ===
In July 2019, Stallone said in an interview that there have been ongoing discussions about a prequel to the original film based on the life of a young Rocky Balboa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://popculture.com/movies/2019/07/23/sylvester-stallone-reveals-rocky-sequel-prequel-in-development/ |title=Sylvester Stallone Reveals 'Rocky' Sequel and Prequel Are in Development |work= popculture.com |accessdate=July 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rocky steps ===
{{Main|Rocky Steps}}
[[File:Philadelphia Museum of Art Pennsylvania USA.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]]]
[[File:Philly042107-014-RockyStatue.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The statue, situated just northeast of the steps]]

The famous scene of Rocky running up the steps of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] has become a cultural icon, with the steps acquiring the vernacular title of &quot;Rocky Steps&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holzman|first1=Laura|title=Rocky|url=http://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/rocky/|website=Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia|publisher=Mid-Atlantic Regional Center for the Humanities|accessdate=December 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202174125/http://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/rocky/|archive-date=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, a statue of Rocky, commissioned by Stallone for ''[[Rocky III]]'', was placed at the top of the [[Rocky Steps]]. City Commerce Director [[Dick Doran]] claimed that Stallone and Rocky had done more for the city's image than &quot;anyone since [[Benjamin Franklin|Ben Franklin]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RockyStatue&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Avery|first1=Ron|title=Rocky Statue|url=http://www.ushistory.org/oddities/rocky.htm|website=UShistory.org|publisher=[[Independence Hall Association]]|accessdate=December 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110174827/http://www.ushistory.org/oddities/rocky.htm|archive-date=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differing opinions of the statue and its placement led to a relocation to the sidewalk outside the Spectrum Arena, although the statue was temporarily returned to the top of the steps in 1990 for ''[[Rocky V]]'', and again in 2006 for the 30th anniversary of the original ''Rocky'' (although this time it was placed at the bottom of the steps). Later that year, it was permanently moved to a spot next to the steps.&lt;ref name=&quot;RockyStatue&quot; /&gt;

The scene is frequently parodied in the media. In the 2008 movie ''[[You Don't Mess with the Zohan]]'', Zohan's nemesis, Phantom, goes through a parodied training sequence finishing with him running up a desert dune and raising his hands in victory. In the fourth-season finale of ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', as the credits roll at the end of the episode, Will is seen running up the same steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art; however, as he celebrates after finishing his climb, he passes out in exhaustion, and while he lies unconscious on the ground, a pickpocket steals his wallet and his wool hat. In ''[[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'', there is a scene where Sherman Klump ([[Eddie Murphy]]) struggles to and eventually succeeds at running up a lengthy flight of steps on his college campus, victoriously throwing punches at the top.

In 2006, [[E!]] named the &quot;Rocky Steps&quot; scene #13 in its ''101 Most Awesome Moments in Entertainment''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060118091605/http://www.eonline.com/On/101/MostAwesome/List/index5.html|url=http://www.eonline.com/On/101/MostAwesome/List/index5.html|archive-date=2006-01-18|accessdate=2015-12-12|url-status=dead|title = E! Channel's 101 Most Awesome Moments in Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] torch relay, Philadelphia native [[Dawn Staley]] was chosen to run up the museum steps. In [[2004 United States presidential election|2004, Presidential candidate]] [[John Kerry]] ended his pre-convention campaign at the foot of the steps before going to Boston to accept his party's nomination for president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philly.com |url=http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/9258078.htm |accessdate=2006-11-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041217163800/http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/9258078.htm |archive-date=December 17, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Novelization ===
Upon the film's release, a paperback [[novelization]] of the screenplay was written by [[Rosalyn Drexler]] under the [[pseudonym]] Julia Sorel and published by [[Ballantine Books]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rocky (Book, 1976) |publisher=WorldCat.org |oclc = 2851748}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sorel |first1=Julia |author-link1=Rosalyn Drexler |title=Rocky |date=1976 |publisher=[[Ballantine Books]] |isbn=0-345-25321-3 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/rockysore00sore }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Video games ===
Several [[video game]]s have also been made based on the film. [[Rocky (1987 video game)|Another]] was released in 1987 for the [[Sega Master System]]. In 1985, [[Dinamic Multimedia|Dinamic Software]] released a boxing game for the [[ZX Spectrum|Sinclair ZX Spectrum]] (also advertised for and/or published on the Sega Master System, Amstrad CPC and MSX) called ''Rocky''. Due to copyright reasons it was quickly renamed &quot;Rocco&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{WoS game|id=0004198|title=Rocky}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rocky-themed merchandise is commonplace in Philadelphia.

More recently, a [[Rocky (2002 video game)|''Rocky'' video game]] was released in 2002 for the [[Nintendo GameCube]], [[Game Boy Advance]], [[PlayStation 2]], and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], and a [[sequel]], ''[[Rocky Legends]]'', was released in 2004 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. In 2016, [[Tapinator]] released a mobile game named ''ROCKY'' for the iOS platform, with a planned 2017 release for Google Play and Amazon platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2016/12/08/rocky-mobile-gaming/|title=Rocky Says 'Yo, Adrian' to the Mobile Gaming Market|last=Grubb|first=Jeff|date=Dec 8, 2016|work=Fortune Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kinshasa''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɪ|n|ˈ|ʃ|ɑː|s|ə}}; {{IPA-fr|kinʃasa|lang}}; {{lang-ln|Kinsásá}}), formerly '''Léopoldville''' ({{lang-nl|Leopoldstad}}), is the [[Capital city|capital]] and the largest city of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. The city is situated alongside the [[Congo River]].

Once a site of fishing and trading villages, Kinshasa is now a [[megacity]] with a population of about 16 million. It faces [[Brazzaville]], the capital of the neighbouring [[Republic of the Congo]], which can be seen in the distance across the wide Congo River, making them the world's second-closest pair of capital cities after [[Rome]] and [[Vatican City]]. The city of Kinshasa is also one of the DRC's [[Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|26 provinces]]. Because the administrative boundaries of the city-province cover a vast area, over 90 percent of the city-province's land is rural in nature, and the urban area occupies a small but expanding section on the western side.&lt;ref name=&quot;area&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Géographie de Kinshasa |url=http://www.kinshasa.cd/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=300 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723091147/http://www.kinshasa.cd/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=300 |archive-date=23 July 2012 |access-date=25 June 2012 |publisher=Ville de Kinshasa |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinshasa is Africa's third-largest urban area after [[Cairo]] and [[Lagos]].&lt;ref name=&quot;population&quot; /&gt; It is also the world's largest [[Francophone]] urban area (surpassing [[Paris]] in population), with French being the language of government, schools, newspapers, public services, and high-end commerce in the city, while [[Lingala]] is used as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' in the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Cécile B.

Residents of Kinshasa are known as ''Kinois'' (in French and sometimes in English) or Kinshasans (English). The indigenous people of the area include the {{interlanguage link|Humbu people|lt=Humbu|fr|Humbu}} and [[Teke people|Teke]].

[[File:Bateke Village, Kinshasa - Starr, Frederick, Congo natives - an ethnographic album (1912).png|thumb|left|Kinshassa village (1912)]]

The city was colonized as a trading post by [[Henry Morton Stanley]] in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; It was named Léopoldville in honour of [[Leopold II of the Belgians|King Leopold II of the Belgians]], who controlled the [[Congo Free State]], the vast territory that is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, not as a colony but as a private property. The post flourished as the first navigable port on the Congo River above [[Livingstone Falls]], a series of rapids over {{convert|300|km|abbr=off}} below Leopoldville. At first, all goods arriving by sea or being sent by sea had to be carried by porters between Léopoldville and [[Matadi]], the port below the rapids and {{convert|150|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the coast. The completion of the [[Matadi-Kinshasa Railway|Matadi-Kinshasa]] [[portage railway]], in 1898, provided an alternative route around the rapids and sparked the rapid development of Léopoldville. In 1914, a pipeline was installed so that crude oil could be transported from Matadi to the upriver steamers in Leopoldville.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Kinshasa – national capital, Democratic Republic of the Congo |encyclopedia=britannica.com |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/318863/Kinshasa/9050/History |access-date=25 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018021639/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/318863/Kinshasa/9050/History |archive-date=18 October 2014 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1923, the city was elevated to capital of the [[Belgian Congo]], replacing the town of [[Boma, Congo|Boma]] in the Congo estuary.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot; /&gt; The town, nicknamed &quot;Léo&quot; or &quot;Leopold&quot;, became a commercial centre and grew rapidly during the colonial period.

After gaining its independence on 30 June 1960, following [[Léopoldville riots|riots in 1959]], the [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] [[Belgian Congo general election, 1960|elected]] its first prime minister, [[Patrice Lumumba]]. Lumumba's perceived pro-Soviet leanings were viewed as a threat by Western interests. This being the height of the Cold War, the U.S. and Belgium did not want to lose control of the strategic wealth of the Congo, in particular its uranium. Less than a year after Lumumba's election, the Belgians and the U.S. bought the support of his Congolese rivals and set in motion the events that culminated in Lumumba's assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Georges Nzongola-Ntalaja |date=17 January 2011 |title=Patrice Lumumba: the most important assassination of the 20th century |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/jan/17/patrice-lumumba-50th-anniversary-assassination |access-date=9 February 2020 |website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, with the help of the U.S. and Belgium, [[Mobutu Sese Seko|Joseph-Désiré Mobutu]] seized power in the Congo. He initiated a policy of &quot;[[Authenticité (Zaire)|Authenticity]]&quot; the names of people and places in the country. In 1966, Léopoldville was renamed ''Kinshasa'', for a village named Kinshasa that once stood near the site, today [[Kinshasa (commune)]]. The city grew rapidly under Mobutu, drawing people from across the country who came in search of their fortunes or to escape ethnic strife elsewhere, thus adding to the many ethnicities and languages already found there.

In the 1990s, a rebel uprising began, which, by 1997, had brought down the regime of Mobutu.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot; /&gt; Kinshasa suffered greatly from Mobutu's excesses, mass corruption, nepotism and the civil war that led to his downfall. Nevertheless, it is still a major cultural and intellectual centre for Central Africa, with a flourishing community of musicians and artists. It is also the country's major industrial centre, processing many of the natural products brought from the interior. The city has recently{{when|date=January 2018}} had to fend off rioting soldiers, who were protesting the government's failure to pay them.

[[Joseph Kabila]], president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 2001-2019, was not overly popular in Kinshasa.&lt;ref name=Trapido2016 /&gt; Violence broke out following the announcement of Kabila's victory in the contested [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2006|election of 2006]]; the European Union deployed troops ([[EUFOR RD Congo]]) to join the UN force in the city. The announcement in 2016 that a new election would be delayed two years led to large protests in September and [[December 2016 Congolese protests|in December]] which involved [[barricade]]s in the streets and left dozens of people dead. Schools and businesses were closed down.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-37406407 DR Congo election: 17 dead in anti-Kabila protests] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616023724/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-37406407 |date=16 June 2018 }}&quot;, ''BBC'', 19 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merritt Kennedy, &quot;[https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/21/506449446/congo-a-powder-keg-as-security-forces-crack-down-on-whistling-demonstrators Congo A 'Powder Keg' As Security Forces Crack Down On Whistling Demonstrators] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180517153108/https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/21/506449446/congo-a-powder-keg-as-security-forces-crack-down-on-whistling-demonstrators |date=17 May 2018 }}&quot;, ''NPR'', 21 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Fleuve Congo Kinshasa 8.JPG|thumb|Down at the banks of the Congo River in [[Ngaliema]] commune]]

Kinshasa is a city of sharp contrasts, with affluent residential and commercial areas and three universities alongside sprawling slums. It is located along the south bank of the Congo River, downstream on the [[Pool Malebo]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Flouriot2013&quot;&gt;Jean Flouriot, &quot;[https://com.revues.org/6770 Kinshasa 2005. Trente ans après la publication de l’Atlas de Kinshasa] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917080851/https://com.revues.org/6770 |date=17 September 2017 }}&quot;, ''Les Cahiers d’Outre-Mer'' 261, January–March 2013; [[doi:10.4000/com.6770]].&lt;/ref&gt; and directly opposite the city of Brazzaville, capital of the Republic of the Congo. The Congo River is the second longest river in Africa after the [[Nile]], and has the continent's greatest [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]]. As a [[waterway]] it provides a means of transport for much of the Congo basin; it is navigable for river barges between Kinshasa and [[Kisangani]]; many of its tributaries are also navigable. The river is an important source of [[hydroelectric power]], and downstream from Kinshasa it has the potential to generate power equivalent to the usage of roughly half of Africa's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Wachter |first=Sarah J. |date=19 June 2007 |title=Giant dam projects aim to transform African power supplies |work=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/19/business/worldbusiness/19iht-rnrghydro.1.6204822.html |url-status=live |access-date=15 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101175527/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/19/business/worldbusiness/19iht-rnrghydro.1.6204822.html |archive-date=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The older and wealthier part of the city (''ville basse'') is located on a flat area of alluvial sand and clay near the river, while many newer areas are found on the [[erosion|eroding]] red soil of surrounding hills.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kayembe2009&quot;&gt;Matthieu Kayembe Wa Kayembe, Mathieu De Maeyer et Eléonore Wolff, &quot;[https://belgeo.revues.org/7349 Cartographie de la croissance urbaine de Kinshasa (R.D.

[[Urban planning|City plans]] of the 1920s–1950s featured a ''[[Cordon sanitaire (politics)|cordon sanitaire]]'' or buffer between the white and black neighborhoods, which included the central market as well as parks and gardens for Europeans.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeeckmansBigon2016&quot;&gt;Luce Beeckmans &amp; Liora Bigon, &quot;The making of the central markets of Dakar and Kinshasa: from colonial origins to the post-colonial period”; ''Urban History'' 43(3), 2016; [[doi:10.1017/S0963926815000188]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban planning in post-independence Kinshasa has not been extensive. The ''Mission Française d'Urbanisme'' drew up some plans in the 1960s which envisioned a greater role for [[automobile]] transportation but did not predict the city's significant population growth. Thus much of the [[urban structure]] has developed without guidance from a master plan. According to [[UN-Habitat]], the city is expanding by eight square kilometers per year. It describes many of the new neighborhoods as [[slum]]s, built in unsafe conditions with inadequate infrastructure.&lt;ref name=ChirisaEtAl2017 /&gt; Nevertheless spontaneously developed areas have in many cases extended the [[grid plan|grid street plan]] of the original city.&lt;ref name=Flouriot2013 /&gt;

Kinshasa is both a city (''ville'' in French) and a province, one of the 26 [[provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Nevertheless it has city subdivisions and is divided into 24 [[Communes of Kinshasa|commune]]s (municipalities), which in turn are divided into 369 quarters and 21 embedded groupings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Commission Électorale Nationale Indépendante |author-link=Independent National Electoral Commission (Democratic Republic of the Congo) |title=La Cartographie Electorale des 26 Provinces—Kinshasa |url=https://www.ceni.cd/cartographie-electorale/provinces/kinshasa |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181028000421/http://www.ceni.cd/cartographie-electorale/provinces/kinshasa |archive-date=28 October 2018 |access-date=18 April 2020 |website=www.ceni.cd |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maluku, Kinshasa|Maluku]], the rural commune to the east of the urban area, accounts for 79% of the 9.965 km2 total land area of the city-province,&lt;ref name=&quot;area&quot; /&gt; with a population of 200,000–300,000.&lt;ref name=Flouriot2013 /&gt;  The communes are grouped into four districts which are not in themselves administrative divisions.

===Climate===
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Kinshasa has a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] (''Aw''). Its lengthy rainy season spans from October through May, with a relatively short dry season, between June and September. Kinshasa lies south of the [[equator]], so its dry season begins around its winter solstice, which is in June. This is in contrast to African cities further north featuring this climate where the dry season typically begins around December. Kinshasa's dry season is slightly cooler than its wet season, though temperatures remain relatively constant throughout the year.

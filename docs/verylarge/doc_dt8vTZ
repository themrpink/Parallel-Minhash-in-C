==Television==

===''Flash Gordon'' (1954–55 live-action)===
{{Main|Flash Gordon (1954 TV series)}}
[[Steve Holland (actor)|Steve Holland]] starred in a 1954–55 live-action [[Flash Gordon (1954 TV series)|television series]] which ran for 39 episodes.&lt;ref name=&quot;mc&quot; /&gt; The first 26 episodes had the distinction of being filmed in [[West Berlin]], [[Germany]] less than a decade after the end of [[World War II]]. This is notable, given that some episodes show the real-life destruction still evident in Germany several years after the war. The final 13 episodes were filmed in [[Marseille]], [[France]].

In this series, Flash, Dale ([[Irene Champlin]]) and Dr. Zarkov (Joseph Nash) worked for the Galactic Bureau of Investigation in the year 3203. The actual timeline was established in one episode, &quot;Deadline at Noon&quot;, in which Flash, Dale and Dr. Zarkov went back in time to Berlin in the year 1953. The GBI agents traveled in the Skyflash and Skyflash II spaceships.

The series was syndicated, appearing on stations affiliated with the long-defunct [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont Network]], and many other independent stations in the United States. It was recut into a movie in 1957.

===''Flash Gordon'' animated (1979–80)===
{{Main|The New Adventures of Flash Gordon}}
In 1979, [[Filmation]] produced an [[animated series]], often referred to as ''[[The New Adventures of Flash Gordon]]'', though it is actually titled ''Flash Gordon''. The expanded title was used to distinguish it from previous versions. The project was originally designed as a television film but NBC decided to change it into an animated series.&lt;ref name=&quot;mc&quot; /&gt;

===''Flash Gordon: The Greatest Adventure of All'' (1982)===
{{Main|Flash Gordon: The Greatest Adventure of All}}
[[Filmation]] produced this successful animated television movie, written by ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' writer [[Samuel A. Peeples]], before they began their Saturday morning series, but the television movie did not actually air until 1982. It was critically well-received, and is considered one of the best film versions of Flash Gordon, though it would never be re-broadcast following its premiere.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|270950|Flash Gordon: The Greatest Adventure of All}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This movie has yet to be commercially released in the United States, although some sources indicate that off-air bootlegs are prevalent. The only known commercial releases were by VAP Video in Japan (catalog #67019-128), in 1983, in both laserdisc and NTSC VHS videotape formats; and in Bulgaria, where it was released on VHS &quot;Van Chris&quot; and &quot;Drakar&quot;. The movie also aired numerous times on &quot;Diema&quot; Channel in the late 1990s. In the Japanese release, it is presented uncut with the original English voice track, with Japanese subtitles added for its intended audience. At the movie's ending is a trailer for the [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group|De Laurentiis]] live-action movie, as well as trailers for other titles from the VAP Video library at the time. The covers for both versions feature comic-strip panels, using stills taken from the movie.

===''Defenders of the Earth'' (1986)===
{{Main|Defenders of the Earth}}
In the 1986 cartoon ''[[Defenders of the Earth]]'', Flash teamed up with fellow [[King Features]] heroes [[Phantom (comics)|The Phantom]] and [[Mandrake the Magician]] in 65 episodes. This series took extreme liberties with all the characters, revealing that Flash and Dale Arden had conceived a son, Rick Gordon, who is in his mid-teens when the series begins. Dale has her mind torn from her body by Ming in the first episode and is preserved in a crystal, which Rick is able to recover and give to his father. Dale is reborn on Earth as Dynak-X, the strategic super-computer based in the Defenders' Headquarters.

===''Flash Gordon'' (1996)===
{{Main|Flash Gordon (1996 TV series)}}
In 1996, Hearst Entertainment premiered an animated ''[[Flash Gordon (1996 TV series)|Flash Gordon]]'' television series. In this version, Alex &quot;Flash&quot; Gordon and Dale Arden are [[hoverboard]]ing teenagers, who become trapped on Mongo after stopping Ming's attempt to invade Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Marsha Ann Tate,''Canadian Television Programming Made for the United States Market: A History with Production and Broadcast Data''.

===''Flash Gordon'' (2007–08 live-action)===
{{Main|Flash Gordon (2007 TV series)}}
{{more citations needed section|date=July 2018}}
On January 12, 2007, at the [[Television Critics Association]] tour, it was announced that the live-action series would comprise 22 one-hour episodes, produced in Canada in early 2007. Under an agreement with [[King Features Syndicate]], the series was produced by [[Reunion Pictures]] of Vancouver with [[Robert Halmi Sr.]] and [[Robert Halmi Jr.]] of [[RHI Entertainment]] serving as Executive Producers.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

On August 10, 2007, the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] premiered its new ''[[Flash Gordon (2007 TV series)|Flash Gordon]]'' series in the [[United States]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The traditional primary supporting characters of Ming, Dale Arden, and Dr. Hans Zarkov were drastically altered. [[Eric Johnson (actor)|Eric Johnson]], best known for his earlier work on the WB's ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', played the title character of Steven &quot;Flash&quot; Gordon. [[Gina Holden]] (who has appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]'' (2005) and ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]'' (2007)) played [[Dale Arden]], [[Jody Racicot]] (''[[Night at the Museum]]'' (2006)) played [[Hans Zarkov|Dr. Hans Zarkov]], and [[John Ralston (actor)|John Ralston]] portrayed the arch-villain, Ming.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Advertisements featured a cover version of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s &quot;[[Flash (song)|Flash's Theme]]&quot; (from the 1980 film) performed by the band [[Louis XIV (band)|Louis XIV]]. The song was not present in any episode of the show.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Radio serials==
Starting April 22, 1935, the strip was adapted into ''The Amazing Interplanetary Adventures of Flash Gordon'', a 26-episode weekly radio serial.&lt;ref name=&quot;mc&quot; /&gt; The series followed the strip very closely, amounting to a week-by-week adaptation of the Sunday strip for most of its run.

Flash Gordon was played by [[Gale Gordon]], later famous for his television roles in ''[[Our Miss Brooks]]'', ''[[Dennis the Menace (1959 TV series)|Dennis the Menace]]'', ''[[The Lucy Show]]'' and ''[[Here's Lucy]]'' (the latter two with [[Lucille Ball]]). The cast also included Maurice Franklin as Dr. Zarkov and Bruno Wick as Ming the Merciless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audio-classics.com/ltheamazinginterplanetary.html |title=Audio Classics Archive: The Amazing Interplanetary Adventures of Flash Gordon |publisher=Audio-classics.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The radio series broke with the strip continuity in the last two episodes, when Flash, Dale and Zarkov returned to Earth. They make a crash landing in [[Malaysia]], where they meet [[Jungle Jim]], the star of another of Alex Raymond's comic strips.

The series ended on October 26, 1935 with Flash and Dale's marriage. The next week, ''The Adventures of Jungle Jim'' picked up in that Saturday timeslot.

Two days later, on October 28, ''The Further Interplanetary Adventures of Flash Gordon'' debuted as a daily show, running four&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;[http://www.jjonz.us/RadioLogs/ Newspaper Radio Logs. At website, select New York Times, then Radio Pages for 1935 list the show aired Monday through Thursdays from October 28 1935 to February 6 1936. Also the shows themselves state it is a Monday through Thursday series.]&lt;/ref&gt; days a week. This series strayed further from Raymond's strip, involving Flash, Dale and Zarkov in an adventure in [[Atlantis]]. The series aired 60 episodes, ending on February 6, 1936.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.otrsite.com/articles/artts013.html Radio Science Fiction: Information and Help to the New Collector]&quot;, by Terry G.G. Salmonson. Retrieved 09-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stage==
In 1989, Lee Ahlin and Gary Gordon wrote a musical for children, ''Flash Gordon'', based on the comic.&lt;ref name=&quot;gs&quot;&gt;Arline Greer, &quot;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1320&amp;dat=19890621&amp;id=tOYxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MOoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5516,7392847&amp;hl=en ''Flash Gordon'' light and tuneful]&quot;. ''Gainesville Sun'' June 21, 1989 (p.1D-2D)&lt;/ref&gt; The musical premiered in 1989 in [[Oak Hall Performing Arts Theater]] in [[Gainesville, Florida]]. ''Flash Gordon'' starred [[Brian LeDuc]] as Flash, [[Kim Ehrich]] as Dale Arden, [[John Pelkey]] as Ming, and [[Julie Hamric]] as Princess Aura.&lt;ref name=&quot;gs&quot;/&gt;

==Comic books==
Over the years, several publishers have produced ''Flash Gordon'' comics, either reprints or original stories.
* [[David McKay Publications]] ''King Comics'' #1&amp;ndash;155 ([[1936 in comics|1936]]&amp;ndash;[[1949 in comics|1949]]) [strip reprints]

Several issues of the King Comics series were drawn by [[Al Williamson]], who won the 1966 [[National Cartoonists Society]] Award for Best Comic Book for his work on the series.&lt;ref&gt;Ringenberg, Steve. &quot;Al Williamson Interviewed&quot;, ''The Comics Journal'' #90 (May 1984), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reuben.org/ncs-awards/division-awards/#comic |title=Division Awards Comic Books |year=2013 |publisher=[[National Cartoonists Society]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216074848/http://www.reuben.org/ncs-awards/division-awards/#comic |archivedate=December 16, 2013 |url-status=dead |accessdate=December 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Williamson later said, &quot;I was paying homage to Alex [Raymond], you know. I tried to treat his creation with respect and dignity and tried to do it to the best of my ability. I find that other artists who have done Flash Gordon just don't seem to get the feeling of the strip, you know. Flash is a noble guy and it's kind of nice to have that kind of a hero.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Zimmerman | first = Dwight Jon | date = November 1988 | title = Al Williamson | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 62 | pages = 43–59 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; King also released a comic version as a part of their Comics Reading Library in the 1970s.

Williamson provided artwork for a Western Publishing adaptation of Dino De Laurentiis' ''Flash Gordon'' film, written by Bruce Jones. It was released by Western Publishing in both hardcover and softcover formats to coincide with the film's release, and was also serialized in three issues of Whitman's Flash Gordon comic book, #31-33, March–May 1981.

In [[1988 in comics|1988]], [[Dan Jurgens]] wrote a modernized version of the comic strip as a nine-issue [[DC Comics]] miniseries. It features Flash as a washed up [[basketball]] player who finds new purpose in life on Mongo, Dale as an adventurous reporter who is just as capable as Flash, and a gray-skinned Ming who is less of an Asian stereotype. The series ran for the planned nine issues and was left with an open-ended conclusion. Though Mongo is not a threat to Earth in this series, Ming had every intention of conquering Earth once he coerced Dr. Zarkov into designing the needed ships.

In [[1995 in comics|1995]], [[Marvel Comics]] published a new two-issue series, written by [[Mark Schultz (comics)|Mark Schultz]] with art by Al Williamson, in the style of the ''Flash'' comics Williamson had produced for King and others.

A new comic book series was released by Ardden Entertainment in August [[2008 in comics|2008]], though with inconsistent release dates for subsequent issues. The series was written by Brendan Deneen and Paul Green and debuted in 2008, with the first arc entitled &quot;The Mercy Wars&quot;. The initial story arc concluded in mid-2009 with an open door to an announced new story arc to begin fall 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ardden-entertainment.com/ |title=Ardden Entertainment's site |publisher=Ardden-entertainment.com |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsarama.com/php/multimedia/album.php?aid=18387 Previewing Ardden's Flash Gordon #1], [[Newsarama]], June 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; These were followed by further storylines. Ardden also published a Flash Gordon anthology entitled ''The Secret History of Mongo''. Ardden's second Flash Gordon arc is titled ''Invasion of the Red Sword'' (2010). Two other arcs were completed.

A reprint of all of Al Williamson's ''Flash Gordon'' comic books in black and white was printed by Flesk in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;M. Keith Brooker, ''Comics through time : a history of icons, idols, and ideas''. Santa Barbara, California : Greenwood, 2014. {{ISBN|9780313397509}} (p. 419).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Dark Horse Comics]] began an archive reprint series in hardback, starting with the original comics published by Dell. The second volume covers the comics published by King Comics, the third covers the comics published by Charlton Comics, the fourth covers the comics published by Gold Key, and the fifth covers the comics published by Whitman.

In 2011, [[Dynamite Entertainment]] began a new series called ''Flash Gordon: Zeitgeist''. The series is written by Eric Trautmann (Vampirella, Red Sonja), from a story and designs by [[Alex Ross]] (Kingdom Come, Marvels, Project: Superpowers) and illustrated by Daniel Lindro.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsarama.com/comics/dynamite-entertainment-flash-gordon-110825.html&lt;/ref&gt; The company also produced a spinoff miniseries, ''Merciless: The Rise of Ming'', in 2012, with story and art by [[Scott Beatty]] and Ron Adrian.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=36384&lt;/ref&gt; Following a crossover miniseries called ''King's Watch'' (where, much like ''Defenders of the Earth'', Flash Gordon teamed up with Mandrake and the Phantom; albeit, set in the 21st century), Dynamite launched a new Flash Gordon ongoing series in 2014, with story and art by [[Jeff Parker (comics)|Jeff Parker]] and Evan &quot;Doc&quot; Shaner.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/20/dynamite-announce-a-new-flash-gordon-comic&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Dynamite followed this run with another ''Flash Gordon'' miniseries as part of their &quot;King:Dynamite&quot; series. This series was written by Ben Acker and Ben Blacker and illustrated by Lee Ferguson.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.newsarama.com/22344-king-five-new-dynamite-launches-of-classic-characters-prince-valiant-flash-gordon-more.html KING: Five New Dynamite Launches of Classic Characters]&quot; [[Newsarama]], 8 October 2014.

==''Flash Gordon Strange Adventure Magazine''==
[[File:Flash Gordon Strange Adventures December 1936.jpg|thumb|Cover of the December 1936 issue of Flash Gordon Strange Adventures]]
In 1936, one issue of ''Flash Gordon Strange Adventure Magazine'' was published by [[Harold Hersey]], featuring a novel about Flash Gordon, entitled ''The Master of Mars''.&lt;ref name=&quot;mc&quot; /&gt; It was written by little-known author James Edison Northford. The saddle-stitched novel was based (more or less) on the comic strip story lines, and included color illustrations reminiscent of Alex Raymond's artwork. On the back pages a second installment, ''The Sun Men of Saturn'', was promised, but it never saw print. Even though the series did not gain in popularity, the lone issue of ''Flash Gordon Strange Adventure Magazine'' has become a much sought-after item for pulp magazine collectors.&lt;ref name=&quot;dm2&quot; /&gt;

==Novels==
The first novel based on the strip, ''Flash Gordon in the Caverns of Mongo'', was published in 1936 by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]]. The credited author was Alex Raymond, but Doug Murray claims the novel &quot;was almost certainly ghost-written&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;dm2&quot; /&gt; Like the pulp magazine of the same year, it failed to launch a series.

In 1973, Avon books launched a six-book series of adult-oriented Flash Gordon novels: ''The Lion Men of Mongo'', ''The Plague of Sound'', ''The Space Circus'', ''The Time Trap of Ming XIII'', ''The Witch Queen of Mongo'' and ''The War of the Cybernauts''.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfafsas&quot;&gt;Tim Cottrill, Martin Harry Greenberg, and Charles Waugh ''Science Fiction and Fantasy Series and Sequels''. Garland, 1986. {{ISBN|0824086716}} (p.177)&lt;/ref&gt; Although the books were credited to Alex Raymond, the first three were written by SF writer [[Ron Goulart]] (under the [[Pen name|house name]] &quot;Con Steffanson&quot;) and the other three novels were by [[Bruce Cassiday]] (the first under the &quot;Steffanson&quot; name, and the latter two under the pseudonym &quot;Carson Bingham&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;sfafsas&quot; /&gt;

In 1980, Tempo books released a series by [[David Hagberg]]: ''Massacre in the 22nd Century'', ''War of the Citadels'', ''Crisis on Citadel II'', ''Forces from the Federation'', ''Citadels under Attack'' and ''Citadels on Earth''. Except for the names of the hero and his co-stars of [[Dale Arden]] and Dr. [[Hans Zarkov]], this series had little to do with any other version of Flash Gordon.

==1939 World's Fair==
The name &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; was emblazoned on the proscenium of a ride at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]]. An article in ''[[Popular Science]]'' (March 1939) described how 150 people could enter a ride designed to resemble a rocket ship with a motion picture screen and vibrating seats for a simulated trip to another planet. The ride was located &quot;at the opposite end of the amusement zone from the parachute tower&quot;. Fairgoers walked around a simulation of Venus as a jungle planet, inhabited by mechanical dinosaurs to enter a &quot;Martian Headquarters&quot;, where &quot;weirdly costumed Martians and mechanically animated models of giant beasts enact[ed] episodes from the adventures of Flash Gordon&quot;. The ride's Martians did not look like those in the 1938 serial, nor did the rocket ship.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;World's Fair Thrills&quot;, ''Popular Science''. March, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reprints==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Flash Gordon]] --&gt;
Raymond's work, particularly his [[Sunday strip]]s, has been reprinted many times over the years by many publishers, most notably [[Woody Gelman|Nostalgia Press]], [[Kitchen Sink Press]] and [[Checker Book Publishing Group]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mc&quot; /&gt;

Some of the Austin Briggs dailies were reprinted by [[Kitchen Sink Press]]. The [[King Comics]] run of ''Flash Gordon'' reprinted one Alex Raymond story and two Mac Raboy ones in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;John Wells and Keith Dallas, ''American comic book chronicles: the 1960s,1965-1969'' Raleigh, North Carolina : TwoMorrows Publishing, 2014. {{ISBN|9781605490557}} (p. 141-5, 150-2)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mac Raboy]] Sundays have been reprinted by [[Dark Horse Comics]] in black and white, while Kitchen Sink began to collect both the Dan Barry and Austin Briggs daily strips. The Dan Barry dailies have never been entirely reprinted, but the Barry stories written by noted author [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]] were reprinted in ''[[Comics Revue]]'' magazine, published by Manuscript Press. [[Tempo Books]] published six [[mass-market paperbacks]] reprinting Dan Barry strips from the 1970s in the 1980s. Two stories from the Dan Barry dailies, D2-133 &quot;Baldur Battles Skorpi&quot; (February 24 to May 10, 1986) and D2-134 &quot;The Bear&quot; (May 12 to August 21, 1986), were reprinted in an oblong format, 6.5 by 10.5 paperback edition with two strips per page by Budget Books PTY of Melbourne, Australia in 1987 under the title ''The New Adventures of Flash Gordon'', {{ISBN|0-86801-795-7}}. A reprint of all of Al Williamson's ''Flash Gordon'' comic strip and comic book work was released in 2009.

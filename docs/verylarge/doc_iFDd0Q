He became known as a performer on ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'' and ''[[Marty (TV series)|Marty]]'', the latter of which won two [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTA]] awards. He quickly became a celebrity in the United Kingdom.

Feldman went on to appear in films such as ''[[The Bed Sitting Room (film)|The Bed Sitting Room]]'' and ''[[Every Home Should Have One]]'', the latter of which was one of the most popular comedies at the British box office in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=269|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NTmrBgAAQBAJ&amp;q=guinness+book+of+box+office+hits+swern+childs&amp;pg=PA268|title=British Film Culture in the 1970s: The Boundaries of Pleasure: The Boundaries of Pleasure|first=Sue|last= Harper|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|date= 2011|isbn = 9780748654260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feldman moved to the United States after becoming well-known on American [[variety shows]]. He famously starred as [[Igor (Young Frankenstein)|Igor]] in [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' and then directed ''[[The Last Remake of Beau Geste]]'' and ''[[In God We Tru$t]]''. He died in 1982 of a heart attack on the set of ''[[Yellowbeard]]'' in [[Mexico City]].

== Early life ==
Feldman was born on 8 July 1934 in [[East London]], the son of Cecilia (née Crook) and Myer Feldman, a gown manufacturer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2002/08/04/2002-08-04_movie_memory_marty_feldman_1.html |title=Movie Memory: Marty Feldman 1977 |newspaper=New York Daily News |date=4 August 2002 |accessdate=30 August 2009 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;&gt;{{cite book| url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/59533 |title=Feldman, Martin Alan [Marty] (1934–1982), comedian and scriptwriter |first=Barry |last=Took |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |date=September 2004 |isbn=978-0-19-861412-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were Jewish immigrants from [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]]. He recalled his childhood as &quot;solitary&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;six&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Marty Feldman: Six Degrees of Separation |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b009pgsc |work=[[BBC Two]] |date=13 August 2011 |accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feldman suffered from [[thyroid]] disease and developed [[Graves' ophthalmopathy]], causing his eyes to [[exophthalmos|protrude]] and become [[strabismus|misaligned]]. A childhood injury, a car crash, a boating accident, and reconstructive eye surgery may also have contributed to his appearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;amc.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph.co.uk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;six&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theofficialmartyfeldman.com/main/news/the-unorthodox-comedian-marty-feldman/|title=The Unorthodox Comedian - The Official Marty Feldman website!|date=4 January 2016|website=Theofficialmartyfeldman.com|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later described his appearance as a factor in his career success: &quot;If I aspired to be [[Robert Redford]], I'd have my eyes straightened and my nose fixed and end up like every other lousy actor, with two lines on ''[[Kojak]]''. But this way I'm a novelty.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lawson1982&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lawson|first1=Carol|title=Marty Feldman, Film Comic, Victim of Heart Attack at 48|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/04/obituaries/marty-feldman-film-comic-victim-of-heart-attack-at-48.html|work=The New York Times|date=4 December 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
===Early career===
Leaving school at 15, Feldman worked at the [[Dreamland Margate|Dreamland]] [[Fair|funfair]] in [[Margate]],&lt;ref name=&quot;six&quot; /&gt; but had dreams of a career as a [[jazz]] [[trumpet]]er, and performed in the first group in which tenor [[Saxophone|saxophonist]] [[Tubby Hayes]] was a member.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chilton&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Martin |last=Chilton |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/8894915/Marty-Feldman-The-Biography-Of-A-Comedy-Legend-by-Robert-Ross-review.html |title=Marty Feldman – The Biography Of A Comedy Legend by Robert Ross: review |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=17 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119071340/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/8894915/Marty-Feldman-The-Biography-Of-A-Comedy-Legend-by-Robert-Ross-review.html |archive-date=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feldman joked that he was 'the world's worst trumpet player'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chilton&quot; /&gt; By the age of 20, he had decided to pursue a career as a comedian.

Although his early performing career was undistinguished, Feldman became part of a comedy act — Morris, Marty and Mitch — who made their first television appearance on the [[BBC]] series ''Showcase'' in April 1955.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oliver&quot; /&gt; Later in the decade, Feldman worked on the scripts for ''[[Educating Archie]]'' in both its radio and television incarnations, with [[Chesney and Wolfe|Ronald Chesney]] and later, Ronald Wolfe.

In 1954, Feldman first met [[Barry Took]] while both were working as performers, and with Took, he eventually formed an enduring writing partnership which lasted until 1974.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oliver&quot; /&gt; They wrote a few episodes of ''[[The Army Game]]'' (1960) and the bulk of ''[[Bootsie and Snudge]]'' (1960–62), both [[Sitcom|situation comedies]] made by [[Granada Television]] for the [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] network. For [[BBC Radio]] they wrote ''[[Round the Horne]]'' (1964–67), their best-remembered comedy series, which starred [[Kenneth Horne]] and [[Kenneth Williams]].&lt;ref name=&quot;six&quot; /&gt; (The last season of ''Round the Horne'', in 1968, was written by others.) This work placed Feldman and Took 'in the front rank of comedy writers', according to [[Denis Norden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;six&quot; /&gt;

Feldman then became the chief writer and script editor on ''[[The Frost Report]]'' (1966–67). With John Law, he co-wrote the much-shown [[Class sketch|&quot;Class&quot; sketch]], in which [[John Cleese]], [[Ronnie Barker]] and [[Ronnie Corbett]] faced the audience, with their descending order of height, suggesting their relative social status as upper class (Cleese), middle class (Barker) and working class (Corbett).&lt;ref name=&quot;six&quot; /&gt;

===Ascent===
The television [[sketch comedy]] series ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'' raised Feldman's profile as a performer. The other three participants (future [[Monty Python]] members [[Graham Chapman]] and John Cleese; and future star of ''[[The Goodies]]'', [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]]) needed a fourth cast member, and had Feldman in mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;six&quot; /&gt; In a sketch broadcast on 1 March 1967, Feldman's character harassed a patient shop assistant (played by Cleese) regarding a series of fictitious books, achieving success with ''Ethel the Aardvark Goes Quantity Surveying''. His character in ''At Last the 1948 Show'' was often called Mr. Pest, according to Cleese.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC Radio 2]] programme ''East End Boys'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Feldman was co-author - along with Chapman, Cleese and Brooke-Taylor - of the sketch [[Four Yorkshiremen sketch|&quot;Four Yorkshiremen&quot;]], which was written for ''At Last the 1948 Show''.&lt;ref name=&quot;six&quot; /&gt;

Feldman was given his own series on the BBC, ''[[Marty (TV series)|Marty]]'', in 1968;&lt;ref name=&quot;six&quot; /&gt; it featured Brooke-Taylor, [[John Junkin]] and [[Roland MacLeod]], with Cleese as one of the writers.&lt;ref name=&quot;six&quot; /&gt; Feldman won two [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] awards. The second series in 1969 was retitled ''It's Marty'' (this title being retained for the [[DVD-Video|DVD]] release of the series).

=== After 1970 ===
[[File:Marty Feldman 1972.JPG|thumb|250px|Promotional photo for ''[[The Marty Feldman Comedy Machine]]'', 1972]]
In 1971, Feldman gave evidence in favour of the defendants in the obscenity trial for [[OZ (magazine)#UK obscenity trial and appeal|''Oz'']] magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;six&quot; /&gt; He would not swear on the Bible, choosing instead to affirm.&lt;ref name=&quot;six&quot; /&gt; Throughout his testimony, he mocked the judge after it was implied that Feldman had no religion because he was not Christian.&lt;ref name=&quot;six&quot; /&gt; By this point, preparation had begun on ''[[The Marty Feldman Comedy Machine]]'' (1971–72), a television series co-produced by [[Associated Television]] (ATV) in the UK and the [[American Broadcasting Company]], and which was produced at ATV's [[BBC Elstree Centre|Elstree Studios]], near London. This vehicle lasted for just one series.&lt;!-- See talk. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Marty Feldman Comedy Machine (The): The Complete Series|url=http://networkonair.com/shop/2243-marty-feldman-comedy-machine-the-the-complete-series-5027626436049.html|work=Network ON AIR|date=2015-11-01|access-date=9 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504000815/http://networkonair.com/shop/2243-marty-feldman-comedy-machine-the-the-complete-series-5027626436049.html|archive-date=4 May 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, [[Dennis Main Wilson]] produced a short BBC sketch series for Feldman titled ''Marty Back Together Again'' — a reference to reports about the star's health — but it never captured the impact of the earlier series. ''Marty'' proved popular enough with an international audience (the first series winning the Golden Rose Award at Montreux) to launch a film career. Feldman's first feature film role was in ''Every Home Should Have One'' (1970).&lt;ref name=&quot;six&quot; /&gt; He spent time in [[Soho]] jazz clubs, as he found a parallel between 'riffing' in a comedy partnership and the improvisation of jazz.&lt;ref name=&quot;six&quot; /&gt;

On film, in [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' (1974), Feldman played [[Igor (Young Frankenstein)|Igor]] (pronounced &quot;EYE-gore&quot;, a comic response to [[Gene Wilder]]'s claim that 'it's pronounced FRONK-EN-SCHTEEN'). Many lines in ''Young Frankenstein'' were improvised. Wilder says he had Feldman in mind when he wrote the part.&lt;ref name=&quot;six&quot; /&gt; 
Feldman's performances on American television included ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]''.

In 1976, Feldman ventured into [[Cinema of Italy|Italian cinema]], starring with [[Barbara Bouchet]] in the [[sex comedy]] ''40 Gradi All'Ombra del Lenzuolo'' ''([[Sex With A Smile]]''). He later appeared in ''[[The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother]]'' and Brooks' ''[[Silent Movie]]'', as well as directing and starring in ''[[The Last Remake of Beau Geste]]''. He also guest-starred in &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, an episode of ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' in which he was teamed up with several ''[[Sesame Street]]'' characters, especially [[Cookie Monster]], with whom he shared a playful cameo comparing their eyes side by side.

During the course of his career, Feldman recorded two albums, ''Marty'' (1968) and ''I Feel a Song Going Off'' (1969), re-released in 1971 as ''The Crazy World of Marty Feldman''.

Feldman was married to Lauretta Sullivan (29 September 1935&amp;nbsp;– 12 March 2010) from January 1959 until his death in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/623/000043494/ |title=Marty Feldman |website=[[NNDB]] |access-date=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died, aged 74, in [[Studio City, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/latimes/obituary.aspx?pid=141834867 |title=Lauretta Sullivan Feldman |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=15 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feldman's peers have reported, in a number of biographies, that he was highly attractive to women in spite of his unconventional facial appearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ross2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qne_BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT252 |title=Marty Feldman: The Biography of a Comedy Legend |date=25 October 2011 |publisher=Titan Books |isbn=978-0-85768-602-2 |page=252 |first=Robert |last=Ross}}{{Request quotation|date=June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feldman wrote an  autobiography, &quot;eYE Marty: The newly discovered autobiography of a comic genius&quot;, which was discovered following Lauretta's death. It was first published on 11 December 2012 with a foreword by Eric Idle.

Politically, Feldman was described as an 'avowed [[socialism|socialist]]'&lt;ref name=current&gt;[http://jewishcurrents.org/marty-feldman-versus-the-suits-42434 &quot;Marty Feldman versus the Suits]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&quot; by Mike Kuhlenbeck, ''Jewish Currents'', June 29, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; telling one interviewer 'I'm a socialist by conviction, if not by lifestyle'&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Feldman has 'ideal equipment'&quot;, ''The Pittsburgh Press'', January 11, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; and another, 'I'm a socialist from way back, but in order to pay my back taxes I have to live in America to earn enough money to pay the back tax I owe to the socialist government that I voted in.'&lt;ref name=&quot;six&quot;/&gt; He later joked that when a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] cabinet minister said to him 'Of course you vote Labour,' Feldman replied, 'No, I don't, because I'm a socialist!'&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=9j04CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT535&amp;lpg=PT535&amp;dq=%22I%27m+a+socialist%22+marty+feldman&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Qc_gIUsae3&amp;sig=-4E07OZBPWyJzUZiXtF-QgHYJAA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiR_eX3hITPAhUJJR4KHYXUCnkQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22I'm%20a%20socialist%22%20marty%20feldman&amp;f=false Marty Feldman: The Biography of a Comedy Legend]'' by Robert Ross, chapter 15, footnote 17&lt;/ref&gt; However, he generally did not seriously discuss politics in public. An exception was when during a promotional tour for ''The Last Remake of Beau Geste'', he denounced the campaign led by [[Anita Bryant]] against [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Marty Feldman versus the Suits&quot; by Mike Kuhlenbeck, ''Jewish Currents'', June 29, 2016 https://jewishcurrents.org/marty-feldman-versus-the-suits/&lt;/ref&gt;

Feldman was a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]]. In a 1979 interview, when asked how long he had practised this, he stated: 'I was about five and a half or six when I converted; I'm forty-three now, so it's been approximately thirty-eight years.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Berry |first=Rynn |author-link=Rynn Berry |title=The Vegetarians |year= 1979 |location=Brookline, MA |publisher=Autumn Press |chapter=Marty Feldman |page=30 |isbn=0-394-73633-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Feldman died from a heart attack,&lt;ref name=Lawson1982/&gt; in a hotel room in [[Mexico City]] on 2 December 1982 at age 48, during the making of the film ''[[Yellowbeard]]''; the film was subsequently dedicated to him. On the [[Audio commentary|DVD commentary]] of ''Young Frankenstein,'' Mel Brooks cites factors that may have contributed to Feldman's death: 'He sometimes smoked half a carton (five packs) of cigarettes daily, drank copious amounts of black coffee, and ate a diet rich in eggs and dairy products.'

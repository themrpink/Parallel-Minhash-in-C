[[File:Corvallis Fire &amp; Rescue logo.png|thumb|right]]

The city's water system has two water treatment plants, nine processed water reservoirs, one raw water reservoir, and some {{convert|210|mi|km}} of pipe.  The system can process up to about {{convert|19|e6USgal|m3}} of water per day.&lt;ref name=&quot;wateroverview&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ci.corvallis.or.us/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=398&amp;Itemid=353| title = Water Utility| publisher = City of Corvallis Public Works| access-date = 2009-01-26| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070808150446/http://www.ci.corvallis.or.us/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=398&amp;Itemid=353| archive-date = 2007-08-08| url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rock Creek treatment plant processes water from sources in the {{convert|10000|acre|km2|adj=on}} Rock Creek Municipal Watershed near Marys Peak.  The three sources are surface streams, which are all tributaries of the Marys River.  Rock Creek has a processing capacity of {{convert|7|e6USgal|m3}} of water per day (gpd), though operational characteristics of the {{convert|9|mi|km|adj=on}}, {{convert|20|in|cm|adj=on}} pipeline to the city limits capacity to half that.&lt;ref name=&quot;waterdetail&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ci.corvallis.or.us/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=431&amp;Itemid=364| title = Water Treatment Facilities| publisher = City of Corvallis Public Works| access-date = 2009-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Rock Creek Plant output remains steady year round at about {{convert|3|e6USgal|m3}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;wateroverview&quot;/&gt;

The H.D. Taylor treatment plant obtains water from the Willamette River, and has been expanded at least four times since it was first constructed in 1949.  Its output varies seasonally according to demand, producing from {{convert|2|to|16|e6USgal|m3}} per day,&lt;ref name=&quot;wateroverview&quot;/&gt; though it has a capacity of {{convert|21|e6USgal|m3}} per day.&lt;ref name=&quot;waterdetail&quot;/&gt;

The total reservoir capacity is {{convert|21|e6USgal|m3}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ci.corvallis.or.us/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=400&amp;Itemid=355| title = Water Distribution | publisher = City of Corvallis Public Works| access-date = 2009-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; though measures to voluntarily reduce water usage begin when reservoir levels fall below 90% of capacity, and become mandatory at 80% or below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ci.corvallis.or.us/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=842&amp;Itemid=2942| title = Water Supply Emergency Curtailment Plan| publisher = City of Corvallis Public Works| access-date = 2009-01-26| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070812211809/http://www.ci.corvallis.or.us/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=842&amp;Itemid=2942| archive-date = 2007-08-12| url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of its ongoing water-conservation program, the water department jointly publishes a guide to water-efficient garden plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ci.corvallis.or.us/downloads/pw/PGPlantGuide.pdf| title = Water Efficient Plants for the Willamette Valley| format = PDF| date = c. 2004| publisher = City of Corvallis Public Works| access-date = 2009-01-26| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090320140549/http://www.ci.corvallis.or.us/downloads/pw/PGPlantGuide.pdf| archive-date = 2009-03-20| url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origin of name===
[[File:SalemOregon1876.gif|thumb|left|Map of Salem in 1876]]
The Native Americans who inhabited the central Willamette Valley at first European contact, the [[Kalapuya people|Kalapuya]], called the area Chim-i-ki-ti, which means &quot;meeting or resting place&quot; in the [[Central Kalapuya language]] (Santiam).&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Tony, Language Education Supervisor, CTGR Cultural Resources Division&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Methodist Mission]] moved to the area, they called the new establishment Chemeketa; although it was more widely known as the Mill, because of its situation on [[Mill Creek (Marion County, Oregon)|Mill Creek]].&lt;ref name=OGN&gt;{{cite book

When the Institute was dissolved, the trustees decided to lay out a town site on the Institute lands.&lt;ref name=OGN/&gt; Some possible sources for the name &quot;Salem&quot; include [[William H. Willson]], who in 1850 and 1851 filed the plans for the main part of the city, and suggested adopting an Anglicized version of the [[Biblical Hebrew]] word &quot;שָׁלוֹם, Shalom&quot;, meaning &quot;peace&quot; (as well as &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;goodbye&quot;).&lt;ref name=OGN/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SPL&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = How Salem Got its Name | publisher = Salem Public Library, Salem, Oregon | url = http://www.salemhistory.net/brief_history/salem_name.htm | accessdate = March 25, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180409092113/http://www.salemhistory.net/brief_history/salem_name.htm | archive-date = April 9, 2018 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reverend [[David Leslie (Oregon politician)|David Leslie]], President of the town's Trustees, also wanted a Biblical name, and suggested using the last five letters of &quot;Jerusalem&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SPL&quot;/&gt; Or, the town may be named after [[Salem, Massachusetts]], where Leslie was educated.

===Native Americans===
It is estimated that the Willamette Valley area has been inhabited for over 10,000&amp;nbsp;years. The Kalapuya peoples would gather on the plateau east and south of the current downtown area in the winter and establish camps. They fished and harvested in the streams and fields of the area. One staple of life was the [[Camassia|camas root]], and periodically the Kalapuya would set fires that would clear and fertilize the meadows where it grew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salemhistory.net/people/native_americans.htm|title=Salem (Oregon) Online History - Kalapuya|website=www.salemhistory.net|access-date=December 8, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226052535/http://www.salemhistory.net/people/native_americans.htm|archive-date=December 26, 2007|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1850s, the Kalapuya, along with the other native peoples west of the [[Cascade Range|Cascade Mountains]], were removed by the U.S. government through a combination of treaties and force.  Most Kalapuya people were moved to the [[Grande Ronde Reservation]] somewhat to the west of Salem, with smaller numbers ending up at [[Siletz Reservation]] and other Oregon and Washington reservations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctsi.nsn.us/chinook-indian-tribe-siletz-heritage/our-history/part-i/ |title=Siletz Indian Tribe History |accessdate=October 14, 2009 |publisher=Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091105215448/http://www.ctsi.nsn.us/chinook-indian-tribe-siletz-heritage/our-history/part-i/ |archive-date=November 5, 2009 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europeans===
The first people of European descent arrived in the area as early as 1812; they were animal trappers and food gatherers for the fur trading companies in [[Astoria, Oregon]].

The first permanent American settlement in the area was the [[Jason Lee (missionary)|Jason Lee]] Methodist mission (1840) located in the area north of Salem known as [[Wheatland, Oregon|Wheatland]].&lt;ref name=SOH&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salemhistory.net/brief_history/brief_history.htm|title=Salem (Oregon) Online History - Brief History|website=www.salemhistory.net|access-date=December 8, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928031339/http://www.salemhistory.net/brief_history/brief_history.htm|archive-date=September 28, 2007|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1842, the missionaries established the [[Oregon Institute]] (the forerunner of [[Willamette University]]) in the area that was to become the site of Salem. In 1844, the mission was dissolved and the town site established.

In 1851, Salem became the territorial capital after it was moved from [[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]]. The capital was moved briefly to [[Corvallis, Oregon|Corvallis]] in 1855, but was moved back to Salem permanently that same year. Salem incorporated as a city in 1857, and with the coming of statehood in 1859, it became the state capital.

===Capitol buildings===
[[File:1935 Capitol Fire.png|thumb|right|Capitol building after 1935 fire]]
Oregon has had three capitol buildings in Salem. A two-story state house, which had been occupied for only two months, burned to the ground in December 1855. Oregon's second capitol building was completed in 1876 on the site of the original. The [[Greek Revival architecture|Revival]]-style building was based in part on the [[U.S. Capitol building]]. The building received its distinctive copper dome in 1893. On April 25, 1935, this building was also destroyed by fire. The third and current [[Oregon State Capitol]] was completed on the same site in 1938. It is recognizable by its distinctive pioneer statue atop the capitol dome that is plated with gold-leaf and officially named the ''[[Oregon Pioneer]]''.

===State fair and cherry festival===
[[File:1867 Oregon State Fair.png|thumb|left|Oregon State Fair 1867]]
Agriculture has always been important to Salem, and the city has historically recognized and celebrated it in a number of ways. In 1861, Salem was chosen as the permanent site of the [[Oregon State Fair]] by the Oregon State Agricultural Association.&lt;ref name=Heine&gt;Heine, Steven Robert [https://books.google.com/books?id=UY1bWuRoaswC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=The+Oregon+State+Fair+Images+of+America&amp;sig=0R6dJjCQh4mFCGyGqCB0XFTcpgs#PPP1, M1 ''The Oregon State Fair Images of America''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120071331/https://books.google.com/books?id=UY1bWuRoaswC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=The+Oregon+State+Fair+Images+of+America&amp;sig=0R6dJjCQh4mFCGyGqCB0XFTcpgs#PPP1, |date=January 20, 2016 }} Arcadia Publishing August 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Salem is nicknamed the &quot;Cherry City&quot;, because of the past importance of the local [[cherry]]-growing industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salemhistory.net/commerce/cherries.htm |title=The Cherry City |accessdate=August 5, 2007 |author=Lucas, Bill |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811051110/http://www.salemhistory.net/commerce/cherries.htm |archive-date=August 11, 2007 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first cherry festival in Salem was held in 1903 and was an annual event, with parades and the election of a cherry queen, until sometime after World War I.

==Geography and climate==
Salem is located in the north-central [[Willamette Valley]], in [[Marion County, Oregon|Marion]] and [[Polk County, Oregon|Polk]] counties. The [[45th parallel north|45th Parallel]] (roughly the halfway point between the [[North Pole]] and the [[Equator]]) passes through Salem's city limits.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|48.45|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|47.90|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.55|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=December 21, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702145235/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archive-date=July 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[Willamette River]] flows through Salem, the [[North Santiam River]] [[drainage basin|watershed]] is Salem's primary drinking water source. Other important streams that pass through Salem are [[Mill Creek (Marion County, Oregon)|Mill Creek]], the Mill Race, Pringle Creek, and [[Shelton Ditch (Oregon)|Shelton Ditch]].&lt;ref name=Creeks&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salemhistory.net/natural_history/salems_creeks.htm |title=The Creeks of Salem |publisher=Salem Online History |accessdate=January 31, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213041930/http://www.salemhistory.net/natural_history/salems_creeks.htm |archive-date=December 13, 2007 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller streams in the southern and southeastern parts of the city include Clark Creek, Jory Creek, Battle Creek, Croisan Creek, and Claggett Creek, while Glen Creek and Brush Creek flow through [[West Salem, Salem, Oregon|West Salem]].&lt;ref name=Creeks/&gt;

Elevation within the city limits ranges from about {{convert|120|to|800|ft|m}}. Salem contains the volcanic Salem Hills in the south and is sandwiched by the {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on}} Eola Hills directly to the west and the {{convert|600|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Waldo Hills]] to the east. Northern and eastern Salem are less hilly. South and West Salem contain some canyons and are the hilliest areas. The [[Oregon Coast Range|coast range]] and the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]]—including [[Mount Hood]], [[Mount Jefferson (Oregon)|Mount Jefferson]], and on the clearest of days, [[Mount St. Helens]] and [[Mount Adams (Washington)|Mount Adams]] in Washington—can be viewed from throughout the city.

Like most of the Willamette Valley area, Salem has a [[marine west coast]] climate ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csb'') with some distinct characteristics of the [[Mediterranean climate]]. Rain is heaviest in late fall and throughout winter, and almost all of the annual precipitation falls between October and May, with a dry season from June through September. Light snowfall occurs in winter, but major snows are rare. Mostly cloudy skies and low cloud ceilings are commonplace during the rainy season.

Salem's mean annual temperature is {{convert|53|°F|1}};&lt;ref name = NOAA/&gt; its annual precipitation is {{convert|39.64|in|mm|0}}, with an average {{convert|3.5|in|cm|1}} of snow included. However, over a quarter of years receive no snowfall.&lt;ref name = NOAA/&gt; The state capital is about {{convert|47|mi|0|abbr=on}} south of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], but actually has a lower average temperature than that of Portland ({{convert|54.4|°F|1|disp=or}}),&lt;ref name = NOAA/&gt; due in part to the lower daily minima.

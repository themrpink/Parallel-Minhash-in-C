By early summer, Forrest commanded a new brigade of inexperienced cavalry regiments. In July, he led them into Middle Tennessee under orders to launch a cavalry raid, and on July 13, 1862, led them into the [[First Battle of Murfreesboro]], as a result of which all of the Union units surrendered to Forrest, and the Confederates destroyed much of the Union's supplies and railroad track in the area.{{sfn|Boatner III|1988|p=289}}

===West Tennessee raids===
[[File:NathanBedfordForrestportrait.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Gen. Bedford Forrest]]
Promoted on July 21, 1862 to [[Brigadier General (CSA)|brigadier general]], Forrest was given command of a Confederate cavalry brigade.&lt;ref name=Eicher240&gt;{{harvnb|Eicher|Eicher|2001|p=240}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1862, Forrest's veteran troopers were reassigned by General [[Braxton Bragg]] to another officer, against his protest. Forrest had to recruit a new brigade, composed of about 2,000 inexperienced recruits, most of whom lacked weapons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones2017&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert C.

Forrest protested that to send such untrained men behind enemy lines was suicidal, but Bragg insisted, and Forrest obeyed his orders. In the ensuing raids he was pursued by thousands of Union soldiers trying to locate his fast-moving forces. Avoiding attack by never staying in one place long, eventually Forrest led his troops during the spring and summer of 1864 on [[West Tennessee Raids|raids]] into west Tennessee, as far north as the banks of the [[Ohio River]] in southwest Kentucky and into north Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod 2011, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Millar2018&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=G.

Forrest returned to his base in Mississippi with more men than he had started with. By then, all were fully armed with captured Union weapons. As a result, Grant was forced to revise and delay the strategy of his [[Vicksburg campaign]]. Newspaper correspondent Sylvanus Cadwallader, who traveled with Grant for three years during his campaigns, wrote that Forrest &quot;was the only Confederate cavalryman of whom Grant stood in much dread&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miers1984&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Earl S.

===Dover, Brentwood, and Chattanooga===
The Union Army gained military control of Tennessee in 1862 and occupied it for the duration of the war, having taken control of strategic cities and railroads. Forrest continued to lead his men in small-scale operations, including the [[Battle of Dover (1863)|Battle of Dover]] and the [[Battle of Brentwood]] until April 1863. The Confederate army dispatched him with a small force into the [[backcountry]] of northern [[Alabama in the American Civil War|Alabama]] and western [[Georgia in the American Civil War|Georgia]] to defend against an attack of 3,000 Union cavalrymen commanded by Colonel [[Abel Streight]]. Streight had orders to cut the Confederate railroad south of [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] to seal off Bragg's supply line and force him to retreat into Georgia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conway1966&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Conway|title=Reconstruction of Georgia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gVkHeW45ELAC&amp;pg=PA4|year=1966|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-0392-3|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forrest chased Streight's men for 16 days, harassing them all the way. Streight's goal changed from dismantling the railroad to escaping the pursuit. On May 3, Forrest caught up with Streight's unit east of [[Cedar Bluff, Alabama]]. Forrest had fewer men than the Union side but feigned having a larger force by parading some repeatedly around a hilltop until Streight was convinced to surrender his 1,500 or so exhausted troops (historians Kevin Dougherty and Keith S. Hebert say he had about 1,700 men).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hebert2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author1=Keith S.

===Day's Gap, Chickamauga, and Paducah===
Not all of Forrest's exploits of individual combat involved enemy troops. Lieutenant Andrew Wills Gould, an artillery officer in Forrest's command, was being transferred, presumably because cannons under his command&lt;ref&gt;Hurst 2011, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; were [[touch hole|spiked]] (disabled) by the enemy&lt;ref&gt;Hurst 2011, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Battle of Day's Gap]]. On June 13, 1863, Gould confronted Forrest about his transfer, which escalated into a violent exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst 2011, pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt; Gould shot Forrest in the hip and Forrest mortally stabbed Gould.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davison2016&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Eddy W.

===Fort Pillow massacre===
{{Main|Battle of Fort Pillow}}
[[image:Battle of Fort Pillow.png|right|thumb|Fort Pillow Massacre]]
Fort Pillow, located {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=}} upriver from Memphis (near [[Henning, Tennessee]]), was originally constructed by Confederate general [[Gideon Johnson Pillow]] on the bluffs of the Mississippi River, and taken over by Union forces in 1862 after the Confederates had abandoned the fort.{{sfn|Buhk|2012|p=139}} The fort was manned by 557 Union troops, 295 white and 262 black, under Union commander Maj. L.F. Booth.{{sfn|Buhk|2012|p=139}}

On April 12, 1864, Forrest's men, under Brig. Gen. James Chalmers, attacked and recaptured Fort Pillow.{{sfn|Buhk|2012|p=139}} Booth and his adjutant were killed in the battle, leaving Fort Pillow under the command of Major William Bradford.{{sfn|Buhk|2012|p=139}} Forrest had reached the fort at 10:00 am after a hard ride from Mississippi,{{sfn|Buhk|2012|p=139}} and his horse was soon shot out from under him, causing him to fall to the ground. He then mounted a second horse, which was shot out from under him as well, forcing him to mount a third horse.{{sfn|Buhk|2012|p=139}} By 3:30 pm, Forrest had concluded that the Union troops could not hold the fort, thus he ordered a flag of truce raised and demanded that the fort be surrendered.{{sfn|Buhk|2012|p=140}} Bradford refused to surrender, believing his troops could escape to the Union gunboat, [[USS New Era (1862)|USS ''New Era'']], on the Mississippi River.{{sfn|Buhk|2012|p=140}} Forrest's men immediately took over the fort, while Union soldiers retreated to the lower bluffs of the river, but the USS ''New Era'' did not come to their rescue.{{sfn|Buhk|2012|p=140}} What happened next became known as the Fort Pillow Massacre.{{sfn|Buhk|2012|p=141}} As the Union troops surrendered, Forrest's men opened fire, slaughtering both black and white soldiers.{{sfn|Buhk|2012|p=141}}&lt;ref name=&quot;WarDept1891610&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=United States.

On April 21, Capt. John Goodwin, of Forrest's cavalry command, forwarded a dispatch listing the prisoners captured. The list included the names of 7 officers and 219 white enlisted soldiers.

At the time of the massacre, General Grant was no longer in Tennessee but had transferred to the east to command all Union troops. He wrote in his [[Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S.

The day was worse for Union troops, who suffered 223 killed, 394 wounded and 1,623 missing. The losses were a deep blow to the black regiment under Sturgis's command. In the hasty retreat, they stripped off commemorative badges that read &quot;Remember Fort Pillow&quot; to avoid goading the Confederate force pursuing them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wills1993&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Steel Wills|title=A Battle from the Start: The life of Nathan Bedford Forrest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vHVXAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22uniforms%20and%20badges%22|date=1993|publisher=HarperPerennial|isbn=978-0-06-092445-4|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tennessee Raids===
[[File:Forrest Memphis Raid.jpg|thumb|250px|Forrest's raid into Memphis]]
Forrest led other raids that summer and fall, including a famous one into Union-held downtown Memphis in August 1864 (the [[Second Battle of Memphis]])&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradley2010&quot; /&gt; and another on a major Union supply depot at [[New Johnsonville, Tennessee|Johnsonville, Tennessee]].

===Murfreesboro, Nashville, and Selma===
After his bloody defeat at Franklin, Hood continued on to Nashville. Hood ordered Forrest to conduct an independent raid against the [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]] [[garrison]]. After success in achieving the objectives specified by Hood, Forrest engaged Union forces near Murfreesboro on December 5, 1864. In what would be known as the [[Third Battle of Murfreesboro]], a portion of Forrest's command broke and ran.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lardas2017&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Lardas|title=Nashville 1864: From the Tennessee to the Cumberland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JfwyDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74|date=2017|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4728-1983-3|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Hood's battle-hardened Army of Tennessee, consisting of 40,000 men deployed in three infantry corps plus 10,000 to 15,000 cavalry, was all but destroyed on December 15–16, at the [[Battle of Nashville]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Bobrick2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Benson Bobrick|title=The Battle of Nashville|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dZJ0BI6VLRwC&amp;pg=PA81|year=2010|publisher=Random House Children's Books|isbn=978-0-375-84887-2|pages=81, 100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forrest distinguished himself by commanding the Confederate rear guard in a series of actions that allowed what was left of the army to escape. For this, he would later be promoted to the rank of [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|lieutenant general]] on March 2, 1865.&lt;ref name=&quot;Head1885&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas A.

In the spring of 1865, Forrest led an unsuccessful defense of the state of Alabama against [[Wilson's Raid]]. His opponent, Brig. Gen. [[James H. Wilson]], defeated Forrest at the [[Battle of Selma]] on April 2, 1865.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eicher2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=David J Eicher|title=The Longest Night: A Military History of the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1p94XzYASDAC&amp;pg=PA837|date= 2002|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-1846-7|page=837}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, General Robert E. Lee surrendered to Grant in Virginia. When he received news of Lee's surrender, Forrest surrendered as well. On May 9, 1865, at [[Gainesville, Alabama|Gainesville]], Forrest read his [[farewell address]] to the men under his command, enjoining them to &quot;submit to the powers to be, and to aid in restoring peace and establishing law and order throughout the land.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Davison 2016, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postwar years and later life==

===Business ventures===
As a former [[slave trader]] and slave owner, Forrest experienced the [[Abolition of slavery in the USA#The end of slavery|abolition of slavery]] at war's end as a major financial setback. He had become interested in the area around [[Crowley's Ridge]] during the war, and took up civilian life in 1865 in Memphis, Tennessee. In 1866, Forrest and C.C. McCreanor contracted to finish the Memphis &amp; Little Rock Railroad, including a [[right-of-way]] that passed over the ridge.&lt;ref&gt;Mitcham 2016, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; The ridgetop [[Commissary (store)|commissary]] he built as a provisioning store for the 1,000 Irish laborers hired to lay the rails became the nucleus of a town, which most residents called &quot;Forrest's Town&quot; and which was incorporated as [[Forrest City, Arkansas]] in 1870.&lt;ref name=&quot;EOA2017&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mike Polston|title=Forrest City (St. Francis County)|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=996|website=Encyclopedia of Arkansas www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net|publisher=The Central Arkansas Library System|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105132923/http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=996|archive-date=November 5, 2017|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian Court Carney writes that Forrest was not universally popular in the white Memphis community: he alienated many of the city's businessmen in his commercial dealings and he was criticized for questionable business practices that caused him to default on debts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carney2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Carney, Court|title=The Contested Image of Nathan Bedford Forrest|jstor=3070019|journal=The Journal of Southern History|date=August 2001|volume=67|issue=3|pages=601–630|doi=10.2307/3070019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later found employment at the [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]]-based Marion &amp; Memphis Railroad and eventually became the company president. He was not as successful in railroad promoting as in war and, under his direction, the company went [[bankrupt]]. Nearly ruined as the result of this failure, Forrest spent his final days running an eight-hundred acre farm on land he leased on [[President's Island]] in the Mississippi River, where he and his wife lived in a [[log cabin]]. There, with the labor of over a hundred prison convicts, he grew corn, potatoes, vegetables and cotton profitably, but his health was in steady decline.&lt;ref&gt;Ashdown, Caudill 2006, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hurst 2011, p. 374&lt;/ref&gt;

===Offers services to Sherman===
During the [[Virginius Affair|''Virginius'' Affair]] of 1873, some of Forrest's old Southern friends were [[filibuster (military)|filibusters]] aboard the vessel; consequently, he wrote a letter to then General-in-Chief of the United States Army William T. Sherman and offered his services in case of war with Spain. Sherman, who in the Civil War had recognized how formidable an opponent Forrest was in battle, replied after the crisis settled down. He thanked Forrest for the offer and stated that had war broken out, he would have considered it an honor to have served side by side with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davison 2016, pp. 474–475&quot;&gt;Davison 2016, pp. 474–475&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Henry1991&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Selph Henry|title=&quot;First with the Most&quot; Forrest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AcBWAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Tennessee%20state%20law%22|year=1991|publisher=Mallard Press|isbn=978-0-7924-5605-6|page=456}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DavisPohanka1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=William C.

===Ku Klux Klan membership===
{{wikisource|Interview with Nathan Bedford Forrest}}
Forrest was an early member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK), which was formed by six veterans of the Confederate Army in [[Pulaski, Tennessee]], during the spring of 1866&lt;ref name=&quot;Wade1998&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Wyn Craig Wade|title=The Fiery Cross: The Ku Klux Klan in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6O_XYBMhNYAC&amp;pg=PA32|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-512357-9|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton2014&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Newton|title=White Robes and Burning Crosses: A History of the Ku Klux Klan from 1866|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NT0xBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5|year=2014|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-7774-6|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Parsons2015&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Elaine Frantz Parsons|title=Ku-Klux: The Birth of the Klan during Reconstruction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gl60CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30|date=2015|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-1-4696-2543-0|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon expanded throughout the state and beyond. Forrest became involved sometime in late 1866 or early 1867. A common report is that Forrest arrived in Nashville in April 1867 while the Klan was meeting at the [[Maxwell House Hotel]], probably at the encouragement of a state Klan leader, former Confederate general [[George Gordon (Civil War General)|George Gordon]].&lt;ref&gt;Newton 2014, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The organization had grown to the point where an experienced commander was needed, and Forrest was well-suited to the role.

====Democratic convention 1868====
{{main|1868 Democratic National Convention}}
The Klan's activity infiltrated the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s campaign for the [[1868 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1868]]. Prominent ex-Confederates, including Forrest, the Grand Wizard of the Klan, and South Carolina's [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]], attended as delegates at the 1868 Democratic Convention, held at [[Tammany Hall]] headquarters at 141 East 14th Street in New York City.{{sfnm|Newton|2014|1p=12|Calhoun|2p=46}} Forrest rode to the convention on a train that stopped in a small Northern town along the way, where he faced a protester who wanted to fight the &quot;damned butcher&quot; of Fort Pillow.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst 2011, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; Former Governor of New York [[Horatio Seymour]] was nominated as the Democratic presidential candidate, while Forrest's friend, [[Francis Preston Blair Jr.|Frank Blair, Jr.]] was nominated as the Democratic vice presidential candidate, Seymour's running mate.{{sfn|Newton|2014|p=12}} The Seymour–Blair Democratic ticket's campaign slogan was: &quot;Our Ticket, Our Motto, This Is a White Man's Country; Let White Men Rule&quot;.{{sfn|Newton|2014|p=12}} The Democratic Party platform denounced the Reconstruction Acts as unconstitutional, void, and revolutionary.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=46}} The party advocated termination of the Freedman's Bureau and any government policy designed to aid blacks in the South.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=46}} These developments worked to the advantage of the Republicans, who focused on the Democratic Party's alleged disloyalty during and after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=46}}

====Election of 1868 and Grant====
[[image:George W. Ashburn.jpg|right|thumb|Prominent Republican organizer George Ashburn was murdered in Georgia by the Ku Klux Klan on March 31, 1868.]]
During the presidential election of 1868, the Ku Klux Klan under the leadership of Forrest, along with other terrorist groups, used brutal violence and intimidation against blacks and Republican voters.{{sfn|Grant,  Reconstruction and the KKK 2018}}{{sfn|Chernow|2017|p=588}} Forrest played a prominent role in the spread of the Klan in the South, meeting with racist whites in Atlanta several times between February and March 1868. Forrest probably organized a statewide Klan network in Georgia during these visits.{{sfn|Bryant|2002}} On March 31 the Klan struck, killing prominent Republican organizer [[George W. Ashburn|George Ashburn]] in [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]].{{sfn|Bryant|2002}}

The Republicans had nominated one of Forrest's battle adversaries, Union war hero [[Ulysses S. Grant]], for the Presidency at their convention held in October. Klansmen took their orders from their former Confederate officers.{{sfn|Chernow|2017|p=588}} In Louisiana, 1,000 blacks were killed to suppress Republican voting. In Georgia, blacks and Republicans also faced a lot of violence. The Klan's violence was primarily designed to intimidate voters, targeting black and white supporters of the Republican Party.{{sfn|Bryant|2002}} The Klan's violent tactics backfired, as Grant, whose slogan was &quot;Let us have peace&quot;, won the election and Republicans gained a majority in Congress.{{sfn|Grant, Reconstruction and the KKK 2018}} Grant defeated [[Horatio Seymour]], the Democratic presidential candidate, by a comfortable electoral margin, 214 to 80.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=55}} The popular vote was much closer: Grant received 3,013,365 (52.7%) votes, while Seymour received 2,708,744 (47.3%) votes.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=55}} Grant lost Georgia and Louisiana, where the violence and intimidation against blacks was most prominent.

====Klan prosecution and Congressional testimony (1871)====
Many in the north, including President Grant, backed the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, that gave voting rights to Americans regardless of &quot;race, color, or previous condition of servitude&quot;. Congress and Grant passed the [[Enforcement Acts]] from 1870 to 1871, to protect &quot;registration, voting, officeholding, or jury service&quot; of African Americans. Under these laws enforced by Grant and the newly formed [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], there were over 5,000 indictments and 1,000 convictions of Klan members across the South.{{sfn|Grant, Reconstruction and the KKK 2018}}

Forrest testified before the Congressional investigation of Klan activities on June 27, 1871. He denied membership, but his individual role in the KKK was beyond the scope of the investigating committee, which wrote: &quot;Our design is not to connect General Forrest with this order (the reader may form his own conclusion upon this question)&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;States1872&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=United States.

He sidestepped some questions and pleaded failure of memory on others. Afterwards, he admitted to 'gentlemanly lies'. He wanted nothing more to do with the Klan, but felt honor bound to protect former associates.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cantor2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=George Cantor|title=Confederate Generals: Life Portraits|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AW4VAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22gentlemanly%20lies%22|date=2000|publisher=Taylor Trade Pub.|isbn=978-0-87833-179-6|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Differences with Southern white majority (1870s)====
After the [[lynching|lynch mob]] murder of four blacks who had been arrested for defending themselves in a brawl at a barbecue, Forrest wrote to Tennessee Governor [[John C. Brown]] in August 1874 and &quot;volunteered to help 'exterminate' those men responsible for the continued violence against the blacks&quot;, offering &quot;to exterminate the white marauders who disgrace their race by this cowardly murder of Negroes&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davison 2016, pp. 474–475&quot;/&gt;

On July 5, 1875, Forrest gave a speech before the Independent Order of Pole-Bearers Association, a post-war organization of black Southerners advocating to improve the economic condition of blacks and to gain equal rights for all citizens. At this, his last public appearance, he made what ''[[The New York Times]]'' described as a &quot;friendly speech&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1533-8525.1999.tb02361.x|title = Kommemorating the Ku Klux Klan| journal=The Sociological Quarterly| volume=40| pages=139–158|year = 1999|last1 = Lewis|first1 = Michael| last2=Serbu| first2=Jacqueline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0713.html |title=On This Day: Death of General Forrest |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 30, 1877}}&lt;/ref&gt; during which, when offered a bouquet of flowers by a young black woman, he accepted them,&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=John Richard Stephens|title=Commanding the Storm: Civil War Battles in the Words of the Generals Who Fought Them|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e2VBBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT319|date=2012|publisher=Lyons Press|isbn=978-0-7627-9002-9|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; thanked her and kissed her on the cheek.

In response to the Pole-Bearers speech, the [[Confederate Survivors Association|Cavalry Survivors Association of Augusta]], the first Confederate organization formed after the war, called a meeting in which Captain F. Edgeworth Eve gave a speech expressing strong disapproval of Forrest's remarks promoting inter-ethnic harmony, ridiculing his faculties and judgment and berating the woman who gave Forrest flowers as &quot;a mulatto wench&quot;.

===Death===
Forrest reportedly died from acute complications of [[diabetes]] at the Memphis home of his brother Jesse on October 29, 1877.&lt;ref&gt;Welsh 1999, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; His eulogy was delivered by his recent spiritual mentor, former Confederate chaplain [[George Tucker Stainback]], who declared in his eulogy: &quot;Lieutenant-General Nathan Bedford Forrest, though dead, yet speaketh. His acts have photographed themselves upon the hearts of thousands, and will speak there forever.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ashdown Caudill 2006, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Forrest was buried at [[Elmwood Cemetery (Memphis, Tennessee)|Elmwood Cemetery]] in Memphis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foote III, p. 1052&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Foote|1974|p=1052}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, the remains of Forrest and his wife Mary were [[Burial#Reinterment|disinterred]] from Elmwood and moved to a Memphis city park that was originally named Forrest Park in his honor, but has since been renamed Health Sciences Park.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sainz&quot;&gt;{{citation |last=Sainz |first=Adrian |title=Memphis renames 3 parks that honored Confederacy |url=https://news.yahoo.com/memphis-renames-3-parks-honored-confederacy-010653790.html |access-date=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 7, 2015, the Memphis City Council unanimously voted to remove the statue of Forrest from Health Sciences Park, and to return the remains of Forrest and his wife to Elmwood Cemetery.&lt;ref name=&quot;TaylorArthur2015&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author1=Eryn Taylor |author2=Shay Arthur |title=Council begins process of removing Nathan Bedford Forrest's remains |url=https://wreg.com/2015/07/07/statue-debate-heats-up-as-city-council-gets-set-to-vote/ |access-date=September 3, 2019 |work=News Channel 3 |publisher=WREG |date=July 7, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423002454/https://wreg.com/2015/07/07/statue-debate-heats-up-as-city-council-gets-set-to-vote/ |archive-date=April 23, 2019 |language=en |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on October 13, 2017, the [[Tennessee Historical Commission]] invoked the Tennessee Heritage Protection Act of 2013 and U.S. Public Law 85-425: Sec. 410 to overrule the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;TDEC2018&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Tennessee Heritage Protection Act|url=https://www.tn.gov/environment/about-tdec/tennessee-historical-commission/redirect---tennessee-historical-commission/tennessee-heritage-protection-act.html|website=www.tn.gov|publisher=Tennessee Department of Environment &amp; Conservation|access-date=April 14, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Memphis sold the park land to [[Memphis Greenspace]], a non-profit entity not subject to the Tennessee Heritage Protection Act, which immediately removed the monument as explained below.

==Historical reputation and legacy==
[[File:NBFSP Camden TN 03 Museum NBF Bust.jpg|thumb|Bronze bust of Forrest at [[Nathan Bedford Forrest State Park]]]]
Many memorials have been erected to Forrest, especially in Tennessee and adjacent Southern states. [[Forrest County, Mississippi]] is named after him, as is [[Forrest City, Arkansas]]. [[Obelisks]] in his memory were placed at his birthplace in [[Chapel Hill, Tennessee]] and at [[Nathan Bedford Forrest State Park]] near [[Camden, Tennessee|Camden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Loewen2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=James Loewen|title=Lies Across America: What Our Historic Sites Get Wrong|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zRtFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA258|year= 2010|publisher=New Press|isbn=978-1-59558-676-6|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forrest was elevated in Memphis in particular—where he lived and died—to the status of folk hero. &quot;Embarrassed by their city's early capitulation during the Civil War, white Memphians desperately needed a hero and therefore crafted a distorted depiction of Forrest's role in the war.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carney2001&quot; /&gt; A memorial to him, the first Civil War memorial in Memphis, was erected in 1905 in a new Nathan Bedford Forrest Park.

In 1978, [[Middle Tennessee State University]] abandoned imagery it had formerly used (in 1951, the school's yearbook, ''The Midlander'', featured the first appearance of Forrest's likeness as MTSU's official mascot) and MTSU president M. G. Scarlett removed the General's image from the university's official seal. The Blue Raiders' athletic mascot was changed to an ambiguous swash-buckler character called the &quot;Blue Raider&quot;, to avoid association with Forrest or the Confederacy. The school unveiled its latest mascot, a winged horse called &quot;Lightning&quot; inspired by the mythological [[Pegasus]], during halftime of a basketball game against rival [[Tennessee State University]] on January 17, 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTSU2016&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Forrest Hall: The Evolution of Middle Tennessee's Mascot|url=http://mtsusidelines.com/2016/03/the-evolution-of-middle-tennessees-mascot/|website=mtsusidelines.com|publisher=Sidelines|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407015445/http://mtsusidelines.com/2016/03/the-evolution-of-middle-tennessees-mascot/|archive-date=April 7, 2018|date=March 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps|ROTC]] building at MTSU had been named Forrest Hall to honor him in 1958, but the [[frieze]] depicting General Forrest on horseback that had adorned the side of the building was removed amid protests in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lind2017&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author1=J.R.

Forrest became well known for his early use of maneuver tactics as applied to a mobile horse cavalry deployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Sanders |first=John R. |date=August 17, 1994 |title=Operational Leadership of Nathan Bedford Forrest |location=Newport R.I. |publisher=Naval War College |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a283415.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grasped the doctrines of [[maneuver warfare|mobile warfare]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Encyclopedia of the American Civil War: A Political, Social, and Military History |editor1-last=Heidler |editor1-first=David Stephen |editor2-last=Heidler |editor2-first=Jeanne T. |editor3-last=Coles |editor3-first=David J. |date=2002 |publisher=W.W.

Paramount in his strategy was fast movement, even if it meant pushing his horses at a killing pace, to constantly harass the enemy during raids by disrupting their supply trains and communications with the destruction of railroad tracks and the cutting of telegraph lines, as he wheeled around his opponent's flank. The Civil War scholar [[Bruce Catton]] writes:
{{quote|Forrest ... used his horsemen as a modern general would use [[motorized infantry]]. He liked horses because he liked fast movement, and his mounted men could get from here to there much faster than any infantry could; but when they reached the field they usually tied their horses to trees and fought on foot, and they were as good as the very best infantry.{{sfn|Catton|1971|p=160}} }}

Forrest is often erroneously quoted as saying his strategy was to &quot;git thar fustest with the mostest&quot;. Now often recast as &quot;Getting there firstest with the mostest&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://mason.gmu.edu/~fdillon/military.htm |title=for example |publisher=George Mason University |first=Francis H.|last=Dillon |access-date=October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; this misquote first appeared in a ''New York Tribune'' article written to provide colorful comments in reaction to European interest in Civil War generals. The aphorism was addressed and corrected as &quot;Ma'am, I got there first with the most men&quot; by a ''New York Times'' story in 1918.&lt;ref name=Times1918&gt;{{Citation |title=Forrest |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/05/28/118141825.pdf |year=1918 |author=Times, New York  |access-date=October 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it was a novel and succinct condensation of the [[Principles of War|military principles]] of [[Force concentration|mass]] and [[Maneuver warfare|maneuver]], Bruce Catton writes of the spurious quote:
{{quote|Do not, under any circumstances whatever, quote Forrest as saying 'fustest' and 'mostest'. He did not say it that way, and nobody who knows anything about him imagines that he did.{{sfn|Catton|1971|pp=160–61}}}}

===Fort Pillow===

Modern historians generally believe that Forrest's attack on Fort Pillow was a massacre, noting high casualty rates, and the rebels targeting black soldiers.{{sfn|Buhk|2012|p=147}} It was the South's publicly stated position that slaves firing on whites would be killed on the spot, along with Southern whites that fought for the Union, whom the Confederacy considered traitors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Congress1863&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=May 1, 1863 [No. 5.] – Joint Resolution on the Subject of Retaliation.|url=https://deadconfederates.com/2014/04/15/|website=deadconfederates.com|publisher=Confederate States of America|access-date=March 6, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306033105/https://deadconfederates.com/2014/04/15/|archive-date=March 6, 2018|date=May 1, 1863}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this analysis, Forrest's troops were carrying out Confederate policy. The historical record does not support his repeated denials that he knew a massacre was taking place, or that he even knew a massacre had occurred at all. Consequently, his role at Fort Pillow was a [[Social stigma|stigmatizing]] one for him the rest of his life, both professionally and personally,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cimprich2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=John Cimprich|title=Fort Pillow, a Civil War Massacre, and Public Memory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BeFiumliWOEC&amp;pg=PR94|date=2011|publisher=LSU Press|isbn=978-0-8071-3918-9|page=xciv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tap2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce Tap|title=The Fort Pillow Massacre: North, South, and the Status of African Americans in the Civil War Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZC3AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA103|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-17390-5|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed to his business problems after the war.

Along with dates mentioned above, members of the palm family with human uses are numerous.
*The type member of Arecaceae is the [[areca]] palm, the fruit of which, the [[areca nut]], is chewed with the [[betel]] leaf for intoxicating effects (''Areca catechu'').
*[[Carnauba]] wax is harvested from the leaves of a Brazilian palm (''Copernicia'').
*[[Rattan]]s, whose stems are used extensively in [[furniture]] and [[basket]]s, are in the genus ''Calamus''.
*[[Palm oil]] is an edible vegetable oil produced by the [[oil palm]]s in the genus ''[[Elaeis]]''.
*Several species are harvested for [[heart of palm]], a vegetable eaten in salads.
*Sap of the nipa palm, ''[[Nypa fruticans]]'', is used to make vinegar.
*Palm [[Sap (plant)|sap]] is sometimes [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] to produce [[palm wine]] or toddy, an [[alcoholic beverage]] common in parts of Africa, India, and the [[Philippines]]. The sap may be drunk fresh, but fermentation is rapid, reaching up to 4% alcohol content within an hour, and turning vinegary in a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/x0560e/x0560e09.htm|title=Chapter Four: Products of Yeast Fermentation|last1=Battcock|first1=Mike|last2=Azam-Ali|first2=Sue|website=Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations|access-date=31 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Palmyra and date palm sap is harvested in Bengal, India, to process into ''gur'' and ''jaggery''.
*[[Dragon's blood]], a red resin used traditionally in [[medicine]], [[varnish]], and [[dye]]s, may be obtained from the fruit of ''[[Daemonorops]]'' species.
*[[Coconut]] is the partially edible seed of the fruit of the coconut palm (''Cocos nucifera'').
*[[Coir]] is a coarse, water-resistant fiber extracted from the outer shell of coconuts, used in doormats, brushes, mattresses, and ropes. In India, beekeepers use coir in their bee smokers.
*Some indigenous groups living in palm-rich areas use palms to make many of their necessary items and food. [[Sago]], for example, a [[starch]] made from the pith of the trunk of the sago palm ''[[Metroxylon sagu]]'', is a major [[staple food]] for lowland peoples of [[New Guinea]] and the [[Moluccas]]. This is not the same plant commonly used as a house plant and called &quot;sago palm&quot;.
*Palm wine is made from ''[[Jubaea]]'' also called Chilean wine palm, or coquito palm
*Recently, the fruit of the açaí palm ''[[Açaí Palm|Euterpe]]''  has been used for its reputed health benefits.
*Saw palmetto (''[[Serenoa repens]]'') is under investigation as a drug for treating enlarged prostates.
*Palm leaves are also valuable to some peoples as a material for thatching, basketry, clothing, and in religious ceremonies (see &quot;Symbolism&quot; below).&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO&quot;/&gt;
*Ornamental uses: Today, palms are valuable as [[ornamental plant]]s and are often grown along streets in [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] cities. ''[[Chamaedorea elegans]]'' is a popular [[houseplant]] and is grown indoors for its low maintenance. Farther north, palms are a common feature in [[botanical gardens]] or as indoor plants. Few palms tolerate severe cold and the majority of the species are tropical or subtropical. The three most [[hardy palms|cold-tolerant species]] are ''[[Trachycarpus fortunei]]'', native to eastern Asia, and ''[[Rhapidophyllum hystrix]]'' and ''[[Sabal minor]]'', both native to the southeastern United States.
*The southeastern U.S. state of [[South Carolina]] is nicknamed the Palmetto State after the [[sabal palmetto]] (cabbage palmetto), logs from which were used to build the fort at [[Fort Moultrie National Monument|Fort Moultrie]]. During the [[American Revolutionary War]], they were invaluable to those defending the fort, because their spongy wood absorbed or deflected the British cannonballs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/fomo/2_History/FOMO%20RevWar%20Exhibit%20Text.pdf Revolutionary War Exhibit Text – November 2002] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110143616/http://www.nps.gov/fomo/2_History/FOMO%20RevWar%20Exhibit%20Text.pdf |date=November 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endangered species==
[[Image:Pritchardia affinis.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Pritchardia affinis]]'', a critically endangered species endemic to the [[Hawaiian Islands]]]]

Like many other plants, palms have been threatened by [[human impact on the environment|human intervention]] and [[exploitation of natural resources|exploitation]]. The greatest risk to palms is [[habitat destruction|destruction of habitat]], especially in the [[tropical forest]]s, due to [[urbanization]], [[wood-chipping]], [[mining]], and [[conversion to farmland]]. Palms rarely reproduce after such great changes in the habitat, and those with small habitat ranges are most vulnerable to them. The harvesting of heart of palm, a delicacy in salads, also poses a threat because it is derived from the palm's [[apical meristem]], a vital part of the palm that cannot be regrown (except in domesticated varieties, e.g. of [[peach palm]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;KaheleHeartsHanaHou&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hanahou.com/pages/Magazine.asp?Action=DrawArticle&amp;ArticleID=591&amp;MagazineID=38 |title= Big Island Hearts |author= Rose Kahele |work= [[Hana Hou!]] Vol. 10, No. 4 |date= August–September 2007 |accessdate= 2016-08-14 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160826100500/http://www.hanahou.com/pages/Magazine.asp?Action=DrawArticle&amp;ArticleID=591&amp;MagazineID=38 |archive-date= 2016-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[rattan palm]]s in furniture has caused a major population decrease in these species that has negatively affected local and international markets, as well as biodiversity in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Palms: Their Conservation and Sustained Utilization | year = 1996 | editor = Dennis Johnson | publisher = International Union for Conservation of Nature | isbn = 978-2-8317-0352-7 | url = http://intranet.iucn.org/webfiles/doc/SSC/SSCwebsite/Act_Plans/Executive_Summary_Palms_Action_Plan_EN.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090114055220/http://intranet.iucn.org/webfiles/doc/SSC/SSCwebsite/Act_Plans/Executive_Summary_Palms_Action_Plan_EN.pdf | archive-date = 2009-01-14 | access-date = 2009-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale of seeds to nurseries and collectors is another threat, as the seeds of popular palms are sometimes harvested directly from the wild. At least 100 palm species are currently endangered, and nine species have reportedly recently become extinct.&lt;ref name = &quot;VPEintro&quot;/&gt;

However, several factors make palm conservation more difficult. Palms live in almost every type of warm habitat and have tremendous morphological diversity. Most palm seeds lose viability quickly, and they cannot be preserved in low temperatures because the cold kills the embryo. Using botanical gardens for conservation also presents problems, since they can rarely house more than a few plants of any species or truly imitate the natural setting.&lt;ref name = &quot;VPEconserv&quot;/&gt; Also, the risk of cross-pollination can lead to hybrid species.

The Palm Specialist Group of the [[World Conservation Union]] (IUCN) began in 1984, and has performed a series of three studies to find basic information on the status of palms in the wild, use of wild palms, and palms under cultivation. Two projects on palm conservation and use supported by the [[WWF (conservation organization)|World Wildlife Fund]] took place from 1985 to 1990 and 1986–1991, in the American tropics and southeast Asia, respectively. Both studies produced copious new data and publications on palms. Preparation of a global action plan for palm conservation began in 1991, supported by the IUCN, and was published in 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;VPEconserv&quot;&gt;[http://www.plantapalm.com/Vpe/conservation/vpe_conservation2.htm Palm Conservation: Its Atecedents, Status, and Needs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060815153142/http://www.plantapalm.com/vpe/conservation/vpe_conservation2.htm |date=2006-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==
{{Main article|Palm branch (symbol)}}

The palm branch was a symbol of triumph and victory in [[classical antiquity]]. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] rewarded champions of the games and celebrated military successes with palm branches. Early [[Christians]] used the palm branch to symbolize the victory of the faithful over enemies of the soul, as in the [[Palm Sunday]] festival celebrating the triumphal entry of [[Jesus Christ]] into [[Jerusalem]]. In [[Judaism]], the palm represents peace and plenty, and is one of the [[Lulav|Four Species]] of [[Sukkot]]; the palm may also symbolize the [[Tree of Life]] in [[Kabbalah]].

Panaiveriyamman was an ancient Tamil [[tree deity]] related to [[fertility]].  Named after ''panai'', the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] name for the [[Palmyra palm]], she was also known as Taalavaasini, a name that further related her to all types of palms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khandro.net/nature_trees.htm Symbolism of trees] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123204004/http://www.khandro.net/nature_trees.htm |date=2016-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The canopies of the Rathayatra carts which carry the deities of Krishna and his family members in the cart festival of Jagganath Puri in India are marked with the emblem of a palm tree. Specifically it is the symbol of Krishna's brother, Baladeva.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

Today, the palm, especially the coconut palm, remains a symbol of the tropical island [[paradise]].&lt;ref name=&quot;VPEintro&quot;&gt;[http://www.plantapalm.com/vpe/introduction/vpe_introduction.htm Virtual Palm Encyclopedia – Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719185520/http://www.plantapalm.com/vpe/introduction/vpe_introduction.htm |date=2006-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Palms appear on the flags and seals of several places where they are native, including those of [[Coat of arms of Haiti|Haiti]], [[Coat of arms of Guam|Guam]], [[Coat of arms of Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]], [[Seal of Florida|Florida]], and [[Flag of South Carolina|South Carolina]].

A '''transporter''' is a [[Teleportation in fiction|fictional teleportation]] machine used in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe. Transporters convert a person or object into an [[energy]] pattern (a process called &quot;dematerialization&quot;), then &quot;beam&quot; it to a target location, where it is reconverted into matter (&quot;rematerialization&quot;).  The term &quot;transporter accident&quot; is a catch-all term for when a person or object does not rematerialize correctly.

A transporter in the Gerry Anderson episode of Fireball XL5 entitled 'The Forbidden Planet' (broadcast in March 1963) predates the Star Trek version. Although dematerialisation is implied, there are no special effects other than vanishing and re-appearing.    

According to ''The Making of Star Trek'', ''Star Trek'' creator [[Gene Roddenberry]]'s original plan did not include transporters, instead calling for characters to land the starship itself. However, this would have required unfeasible and unaffordable sets and model filming, as well as episode running time spent while landing, taking off, etc.  The shuttlecraft was the next idea, but when filming began, the full-sized shooting model was not ready. Transporters were devised as a less expensive alternative, achieved by a simple [[fade (filmmaking)|fade-out/fade-in]] of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;''Star Trek: The Next Generation 365'' by Paula M. Block, Terry J. Erdmann&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}} Transporters first appear in the original pilot episode &quot;[[The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Cage]]&quot;. The transporter special effect, before being done using [[computer-generated imagery|computer animation]], was created by turning a slow-motion camera upside down and photographing some backlit shiny grains of aluminium powder that were dropped between the camera and a black background.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert F. Solow and Robert H. Justman, ''Inside Star Trek the real story'', 1996, {{ISBN|0-671-00974-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual]]'', the three touch-sensitive light-up bars on the ''Enterprise''-D's transporter console were an homage to the three sliders used on the duotronic transporter console on the original ''Enterprise'' in ''The Original Series''.

In August 2008, physicist [[Michio Kaku]] predicted in ''Discovery Channel Magazine'' that a [[Teleportation#Beaming|teleportation device similar to those in ''Star Trek'']] would be invented within 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Sledge, ''Discovery Channel Magazine'' Issue 3, {{ISSN|1793-5725}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physics students at  University of Leicester  calculated that to &quot;beam up&quot; just the genetic information of a single human cell, not the positions of the atoms, just the gene sequences, together with a &quot;brain state&quot; would take 4,850 trillion years assuming a 30 gigahertz microwave bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boyle|first1=Alan|title=The trouble with teleportation: It could take quadrillions of years|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/trouble-teleportation-it-could-take-quadrillions-years-f6C10817487|publisher=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Eric Davis for the US [[Air Force Research Laboratory]] of speculative teleportation technologies showed that to dematerialize a human body by heating it up to a million times the temperature of the core of the sun so that the quarks lose their binding energy and become massless and can be beamed at the speed of light in the closest physics equivalent to the ''Star Trek'' teleportation scenario would require the equivalent of 330 megatons of energy. To meet the information storage and transmission requirements would require current computing capabilities to continue improve by a factor of 10 to 100 times per decade for 200 to 300 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Eric W.|title=Teleportation Physics Study - section 3.0 q-TELEPORTATION|url=https://fas.org/sgp/eprint/teleport.pdf|pages=30 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
According to dialogue in the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' (&quot;ENT&quot;) episode &quot;[[Daedalus (Enterprise episode)|Daedalus]]&quot;, the transporter was invented in the early 22nd century by Dr. Emory Erickson, who also became the first human to be successfully transported. Although the [[Enterprise (NX-01)|''Enterprise'' (NX-01)]] has a transporter, the crew does not routinely use it for moving biological organisms. Instead, they generally prefer using shuttlepods or other means of transportation unless no other means of transportation are possible or feasible. The capability is rare; in &quot;[[The Andorian Incident]]&quot;, the [[Andorians]], technologically far superior to Starfleet in many regards, are explicitly stated not to possess the technology. In &quot;[[Chosen Realm]]&quot;, a group of alien religious extremists who hijack the ship is unaware of it to the point that when Archer insists on sacrificing a crew member and claims that the device disintegrates matter rather than teleporting it, he is unhesitatingly taken at his word.  The crew aboard the 23rd century [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] frequently use the transporter. By the [[24th century]], transporter travel was reliable and &quot;the safest way to travel&quot; according to dialogue in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (''TNG'') episode &quot;[[Realm of Fear (TNG episode)|Realm of Fear]]&quot;.

According to the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode &quot;[[Homefront (DS9 episode)|Homefront]]&quot;, [[Starfleet Academy]] cadets receive transporter rations, and the [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]] family once used a transporter to move furniture into a new home.

Despite its frequent use, characters such as [[Leonard McCoy]] and [[Katherine Pulaski]] are reluctant to use the transporter, as the characters express in the ''Next Generation'' episodes &quot;[[Encounter at Farpoint (TNG episode)|Encounter at Farpoint]]&quot; and &quot;[[Unnatural Selection (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Unnatural Selection]]&quot;, respectively. [[Reginald Barclay]] expresses his outright fear of transporting in &quot;[[Realm of Fear]]&quot;.

=== Capabilities and limitations ===
The television series and films do not go into great detail about transporter technology.  The ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual]]'' claims that the devices transport objects in real time, accurate to the [[quantum realm|quantum level]]. The episode &quot;Realm of Fear&quot; specifies the length of a transport under unusual circumstances would last &quot;... four or five seconds; about twice the normal time&quot;. This calculates the length of a typical transport as between 2 and 2.5 seconds and possibly less. Heisenberg compensators remove [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle|uncertainty]] from the subatomic measurements, making transporter travel feasible. Further technology involved in transportation include a computer pattern buffer to enable a degree of leeway in the process. When asked &quot;How does the Heisenberg compensator work?&quot; by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, ''Star Trek'' technical adviser [[Michael Okuda]] responded: &quot;It works very well, thank you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,981892,00.html|title=Reconfigure the Modulators!|date=November 28, 1994|magazine=Time Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Original Series'' (''TOS'') writers' guide, the effective range of a transporter is 40,000 kilometers, although thick layers of rock can reduce this range (''TNG'': &quot;[[Legacy (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Legacy]]&quot;). The ''TOS'' episode &quot;[[Obsession (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Obsession]]&quot; however, appears to indicate that the transporters' maximum range, during that time period in ''Star Trek'' history, is actually around 30,000 kilometers. Transporter operations have been disrupted or prevented by dense metals (''TNG'': &quot;[[Contagion (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Contagion]]&quot;), solar flares (''TNG'': &quot;[[Symbiosis (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Symbiosis]]&quot;), and other forms of radiation, including electromagnetic (''TNG'': &quot;[[The Enemy (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Enemy]]&quot;; ''TNG'': &quot;[[Power Play (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Power Play]]&quot;) and nucleonic (''TNG'': &quot;[[Schisms (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Schisms]]&quot;), and affected by ion storms (''TOS'': &quot;[[Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Mirror, Mirror]]&quot;). Transporting, in progress, has also been stopped by telekinetic powers (''TNG'': &quot;[[Skin of Evil (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Skin of Evil]]&quot;) and by brute strength (''TNG'': &quot;[[The Hunted (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Hunted]]&quot;). The ''TNG'' episode &quot;[[Bloodlines (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Bloodlines]]&quot; features a dangerous and experimental &quot;[[subspace (Star Trek)|subspace]] transporter&quot; capable of interstellar distances and the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]] had the ability to transport over great distances (''DS9'': &quot;[[Covenant (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Covenant]]&quot;).  The 40,000-kilometer limit is also referred to in ''ENT'': &quot;[[Daedalus (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Daedalus]]&quot;.

[[Starfleet]] transporters from the ''TNG'' era onward include a device that can detect and disable an active weapon (''TNG'': &quot;[[The Most Toys (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Most Toys]]&quot;), and a bio-filter to remove contagious [[microbes]] or [[viruses]] from an individual in transport (''TNG'': &quot;[[Shades of Gray (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Shades of Gray]]&quot;, ''TOS'': &quot;[[The Naked Time]]&quot;). The transporter can also serve a tactical purpose, such as beaming a photon grenade or [[photon torpedo]] to detonate at remote locations (''TNG'': &quot;[[Legacy (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Legacy]]&quot;, ''{{abbr|VOY|Star Trek: Voyager}}'': &quot;[[Dark Frontier (Star Trek: Voyager)|Dark Frontier]]&quot;), or to outright destroy objects (''TNG'': &quot;[[Captain's Holiday]]&quot;).  The ''TOS'' episode &quot;[[A Taste of Armageddon]]&quot; mentions Vendikar materializing fusion bombs over targets of enemy planet Eminiar VII in the course of theoretical computer warfare.

Whenever a person or object is transported, the machine creates a memory file of the pattern.  This has been used at least once in every ''Star Trek'' series to revert people adversely affected by a transport to their original state.

Various episodes of ''Deep Space Nine'' (&quot;DS9&quot;) and ''Voyager'' (&quot;VOY&quot;) have introduced two anti-transporter devices:  transport inhibitors and transporter scramblers.  Inhibitors prevent a transporter beam from &quot;locking on&quot; to whatever the device is attached.  Scramblers distort the pattern that is in transit, literally scrambling the atoms upon rematerialization, resulting in the destruction of inanimate objects and killing living beings by rematerializing them as masses of random tissue; this was gruesomely demonstrated in the ''DS9'' episode &quot;[[The Darkness and the Light (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|The Darkness and the Light]]&quot;.

Transporter operations can also be curtailed when either the point of origin and/or the intended target site is moving at warp velocities.  In the ''TNG'' episode, &quot;[[The Schizoid Man (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Schizoid Man]]&quot;, a &quot;long-range&quot; or &quot;near-warp&quot; transport was required as a transporter beam cannot penetrate a warp field. (In the 2009 ''Star Trek'' film Kirk and Scotty beam aboard while the ''Enterprise'' is traveling at warp, however, the movie takes place in an alternate continuity, thus not affecting the Prime Continuity used in all previous media and the ''Star Trek'' Online computer game.) To deposit an away team on the planet Gravesworld while at the same time responding to a distress signal, the ''Enterprise'' would only drop out of warp drive just long enough to energize the transporter beam.  [[Geordi La Forge]] personally performed the delicate operation, which involved compensating for the ship's relativistic motion.  After materializing, Deanna Troi commented that for a moment she thought she was trapped in a nearby wall, to which Worf replied, &quot;For a moment, you were.&quot;  In later stories (&quot;[[The Emissary (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Emissary]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Best of Both Worlds (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Best of Both Worlds]]&quot;), it was confirmed that the transporter would work at warp only if the sending and receiving sites were moving at equal velocities.

In his book ''[[The Physics of Star Trek]]'',  after explaining the difference between transporting information and transporting the actual atoms, Krauss notes that &quot;The ''Star Trek'' writers seem never to have got it exactly clear what they want the transporter to do. Does the transporter send the atoms and the bits, or just the bits?&quot; He notes that according to the canon definition of the transporter the former seems to be the case, but that that definition is inconsistent with a number of applications, particularly incidents, involving the transporter, which appear to involve only a transport of information, for example the way in which it splits Kirk into two versions in the episode &quot;[[The Enemy Within (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Enemy Within]]&quot; or the way in which Riker is similarly split in the episode &quot;[[Second Chances (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Second Chances]]&quot;. Krauss elaborates that: &quot;If the transporter carries both the matter stream and the information signal, this splitting phenomenon is impossible. The number of atoms you end up with has to be the same as the number you began 
with. There is no possible way to replicate people in this manner. On the other hand, if only the information were beamed up, one could imagine combining it with atoms that might be stored aboard a starship and making as many copies as you wanted of an individual.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence M. Krauss (1995), ''[[The Physics of Star Trek]]'',  Basic Books, {{ISBN|978-0465002047}}, pp. 67-68&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transporter accidents====
Aside from external influences causing disruptions in the normal operations of transporters, the technology itself has been known to fail on occasion, causing serious injury or usually death to those being transported. This was demonstrated in Star Trek's 1979 film debut, ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' when a malfunction in the transporter sensor circuits resulted in insufficient signal being present at the ''[[Starship Enterprise|Enterprise]]'' end to successfully rematerialize the two subjects, and [[Starfleet]] was unable to pull them back to where they had dematerialized from. The transporter system attempted to rematerialize what little signal was available, and despite the efforts of [[James T. Kirk|Kirk]] and [[Montgomery Scott|Scotty]], the system failed and both subjects vanished from the transporter pad. Kirk, visibly shaken by what he had witnessed asked, &quot;Starfleet, do you have them?&quot;, to which the response was made &quot;''Enterprise'', what we got back didn't live long, fortunately&quot;.

By the time of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|The Next Generation]]'', transporter technology has advanced considerably, meaning that accidents are now remote, if not near impossible. In the episode &quot;[[Realm of Fear]]&quot;, [[Geordi La Forge]] states that there have been no more than two or three transporter accidents in the preceding ten years. Reference is also made to the advancement of transporter technology in the same episode, where [[Miles O'Brien (Star Trek)|Chief O'Brien]] states that each individual transporter pad has four redundant scanners whereby in the event a scanner fails the other three will take over, and that he has never lost anyone having been a transporter operator for over 20 years.

In &quot;[[Rascals (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Rascals]]&quot;, several adult Enterprise crew members were beamed off a shuttle and re materialized as children still in their adult sized clothing, the incoming &quot;matter stream&quot; had a commensurate drop in mass, the operator had initially thought the reduction in mass meant &quot;we may have lost one&quot;.

In the ''[[Star Trek: Voyager|Voyager]]'' episode &quot;[[Tuvix]]&quot;, a transporter accident combines both the physical and behavioral aspects of [[Tuvok|Lt. Tuvok]] and [[Neelix]] into a single being wearing a melange of each other's clothing. Notably, Tuvix was of equal mass of both Tuvok and Neelix combined. When they were later separated, Neelix and Tuvok were both wearing Starfleet uniforms.

====Technological and scientific restrictions====
While several characters have asserted that transporters cannot transport through a ship's [[shields (Star Trek)|shields]] or planetary defense shields, there are instances of this &quot;rule&quot; being broken through a [[technobabble]] solution (''TNG'': &quot;[[The Wounded (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Wounded]]&quot;, ''DS9'': &quot;[[Trials and Tribble-ations]]&quot;) or disregarded by the show's writers (''Voyager'': &quot;[[Caretaker (Star Trek: Voyager)|Caretaker]]&quot;). The non-canon ''TNG Technical Manual'' describes how a starship may create &quot;windows&quot; in the shield geometry through which a transporter beam may propagate at the expense of creating weak spots in the vessel's defensive field.

In ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', [[Vice Admiral (Star Trek)|Vice Admiral]] [[James T. Kirk]] and [[Lieutenant (Star Trek)|Lieutenant]] [[Saavik]] carry on a conversation during rematerialization. In ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]'', Dr. Gillian Taylor jumps into Kirk's transporter beam during dematerialization, and rematerializes without any apparent ill effects. This is probably due to the &quot;annular confinement beam&quot;, a component of the transporter mentioned in the various television episodes which serves to keep patterns separate from one another. In the same film, Mr. Spock is beamed onto a cloaked ship while walking.

According to the ''TNG Technical Manual'', the transporter cannot move [[antimatter]], but in the ''Voyager'' episode &quot;[[Dark Frontier]]&quot; ''Voyager'' transported a live photon torpedo equipped with antimatter onto a Borg ship. Also in ''TOS'' episode &quot;[[Obsession (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Obsession]]&quot; Kirk and a fellow crewman beam down to the surface of a planet with an antimatter bomb. The ''TAS'' episode &quot;[[One of Our Planets Is Missing]]&quot; has the ''Enterprise'' beaming a chunk of antimatter into a stasis box.

[[Image:Transporter3.jpg|thumb|right|Transporter chamber and control console aboard USS ''[[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|Voyager]]'']]
In the original series, beaming to and from the transporter chamber was a necessity. This is explained in the ''TOS'' episode &quot;[[Day of the Dove]]&quot;. Spock and Scotty had said that doing a site-to-site transport, as they are referred to on the show, on board the ship could be risky. They could beam into a deck or other inanimate object and get stuck there. However, there are apparently safeguards in place to prevent people from being beamed into hostile environments such as under water and into lava pits, although it is possible to override this safety feature; for example, in the ''TOS'' episode &quot;[[And the Children Shall Lead]]&quot;, two security guards are beamed into open space. In the following series, however, the transporter room seems to become mostly obsolete, the actual equipment notwithstanding. Characters are shown activating the transporter from ordinary consoles and beaming from place to place without apparent trouble. The main operator can likewise send those in transport anywhere with ease (for example, in the ''Voyager'' episode &quot;[[In the Flesh (Star Trek: Voyager)|In the Flesh]]&quot;, a medical console is used to transport a body from the morgue to the surgical bay). A possible explanation for this is put forward in the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Technical Manual]]'', where such site-to-site transports would probably use twice as much energy as would be required for transport to or from the transporter room itself, since the subject would have to be beamed to the transporter, stored, then shunted to their destination. In addition, the six circles on the platform are generally used as targets for the subjects to stand on, but they do not appear to represent any limitation of the hardware to six or fewer people. People have been transported carrying others, in a coffin style transport, as well as animals, hay, and various inanimate objects.

Dialogue in ''Deep Space Nine'' indicates the existence of portable transporters, but these are never seen. The ''Next Generation'' episode &quot;[[Timescape (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Timescape]]&quot; features emergency transporter armbands, although these may have served only to activate a remote transporter. To confuse things more, ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'' featured the prototype &quot;emergency transport unit&quot;. Tom Paris uses a portable transporter in the  ''Voyager'' episode &quot;[[Non Sequitur (Star Trek: Voyager)|Non Sequitur]]&quot;. 
For special effects reasons, in ''TOS'', people generally appear immobilized during transport, with the exception of Kirk in the episode &quot;[[That Which Survives]]&quot;. However, by ''TNG'', characters can move within the confines of the transporter beam while being transported, although this is rarely shown. Persons being transported are at least sometimes able to perceive the functioning of the transporter while they are in transit. In the ''TOS'' episode &quot;[[The Doomsday Machine (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Doomsday Machine]]&quot;, the ''Enterprise'' transporter malfunctions while transporting Scotty from the disabled USS ''Constellation'' to the ''Enterprise'' due to a power drain, and Scotty's pattern is nearly lost in transit. As soon as he successfully materializes, Scotty asks the transporter operator with concern, &quot;What's the matter with that thing?&quot; and orders the transporter to be taken offline for emergency repair.

Some species do not use transporter technology for a variety of reasons. In the first appearance of Trill in the ''TNG'' episode &quot;[[The Host (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Host]]&quot;, Trill were unable to be transported, once joined with a symbiont. It seems that was due to the symbiont being detected and removed by the transporter technology as an infestation in the host. Odan, the Trill host in this episode, is reluctant to say why he will not travel this way, and it only becomes apparent that he is carrying a symbiont when he is later injured. All the crew of the ''Enterprise'' react as if they have had no contact with this species before. It later becomes apparent that joined Trill have been working in the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] for some time.

In season three of [[Star Trek: Discovery]], set on the 23rd century, personal transporters are used.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.space.com/star-trek-discovery-season-3-episode-1-recap&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
The famous [[catchphrase]] &quot;[[Beam me up, Scotty]]&quot; refers to the transporter device, which was often operated by chief engineer [[Montgomery Scott]] during the original series. &quot;Scotty, beam me up&quot; was spoken by Admiral Kirk in ''Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home''.  On the special edition DVD of ''Star Trek IV'', the text commentary provided by Michael and Denise Okuda (co-authors of ''The Star Trek Encyclopedia'' and ''The Star Trek Chronology: The History of the Future'') indicates that this was the closest anyone came to using that catchphrase in an official ''Star Trek'' production.

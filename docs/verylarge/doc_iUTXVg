== Technology and use ==
The most common printer to use this technology was the line-matrix printer made by [[Printronix]] and its licensees.  In this type, the hammers are arranged as a &quot;hammerbank&quot;; a type of comb that oscillate horizontally to produce a line of dots.

A character matrix printer has also been produced.  In this printer, the [[hammer]]s are machined from an oval of magnetically permeable stainless steel, and the hammer-tips form vertical rows.

The original technology, patented by Printronix in 1974, has the top of a stiff [[leaf spring]] held back by a [[magnet]]ic pole-piece.  A [[tungsten carbide]] hammer is [[Brazing|brazed]] to the center-top of the leaf spring.  When it produces a dot, a coil ([[electromagnet]]) wrapped around the pole-piece neutralizes the magnetic field.  The leaf spring snaps the hammer away from the pole-piece, pushing the hammer out against a ribbon and placing an image of a dot onto the paper.

Recent designs have performed complex optimizations in the magnetic circuit, and eliminated unwanted [[resonance]]s in the spring.  The result was a near-doubling of speed.  Other improvements include the use of [[electrical discharge machining]] to produce complex, three-dimensional hammers that trade-off the magnetic circuit, mechanical resonances, and printing speed.

Normal wear usually occurs when the spring rubs against the pole-piece as it returns.  This causes the pole-piece to wear, eventually requiring the pole pieces to be reground and recertified.

[[Hexavalent chromium|Hexavalent]] [[chrome plating]] on the pole-piece, combined with careful design, more than doubles speeds and improves life-span. It produces approximately a billion impressions per hammer.

      <text bytes="4218" xml:space="preserve">{{hatnote|This article deals with the general meaning of the '''integument'''. Consult articles listed below for other articles dealing with similar or related concepts}}

In biology, '''integument''' is the natural covering of an organism or an organ, such as its [[skin]], [[husk]], [[Exoskeleton|shell]], or [[Peel (fruit)|rind]].&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-19-861271-0&quot;/&gt;

It derives from ''integumentum'', which is [[Latin]] for &quot;a covering&quot;. In a transferred or figurative sense, it could mean a [[cloak]] or a [[disguise]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Latin Cassel&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Marchant, J.R.V. |author2=Charles Joseph F. | title = Cassell's Latin dictionary | publisher = Cassell | location = London | year = 1952 | isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In English &quot;integument&quot; is a fairly modern word, its origin having been traced back to the early seventeenth century. It can mean a material or layer with which anything is enclosed, clothed, or covered in the sense of &quot;clad&quot; or &quot;coated&quot;, as with a skin or husk.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-19-861271-0&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Lesley |title=The New shorter Oxford English dictionary on historical principles |publisher=Clarendon |location=Oxford [Eng.] |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-19-861271-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/newshorteroxford00lesl }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Botanical usage ==
In [[botany]] the senses are similar to those in zoology, referring to the covering of an organ. When the context indicates nothing to the contrary, the word commonly refers to an envelope covering the [[Ovule#Integuments, chivai and chalaza|ovule]]. The integument may consist of one layer (unitegmic) or two layers (bitegmic), each of which consisting of two or more layers of cells. The integument is perforated by a pore, the micropyle, through which the pollen tube can enter. It may develop into the testa, or [[seed]] coat.

==Zoological usage==
The integument of an organ in [[zoology]] typically would comprise membranes of connective tissue such as those around a kidney or liver. In referring to the integument of an animal, the usual sense is its skin and its derivatives: the [[integumentary system]], where &quot;integumentary&quot; is a synonym for &quot;[[Skin|cutaneous]]&quot;.

In arthropods, the integument, or external &quot;skin&quot;, consists of a single layer of [[epithelium|epithelial]] [[ectoderm]] from which arises the [[cuticle]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristensen&amp;Georges2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kristensen|first1=Niels P.|last2=Georges|first2=Chauvin|title=Lepidoptera, Moths and Butterflies: Morphology, Physiology, and Development : Teilband|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5w8FgSGuH34C&amp;pg=PA484|accessdate=10 January 2013|date=1 December 2003|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-016210-3|page=484|chapter=Integument}}&lt;/ref&gt; an outer covering of [[chitin]] the rigidity of which varies as per its chemical composition.It is present in ovule and also work in it with nucelleus.


==Derivative terms and sundry usages==
Derivative terms include various adjectival forms such as integumentary (e.g. system), integumental (e.g. integumental glands, &quot;peltate glands, the integument being raised like a bladder due to abundant secretion&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BotGloss&quot;&gt;Jackson, Benjamin, Daydon; A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent; Published by Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. London, 4th ed 1928&lt;/ref&gt;) and integumented (as opposed to bare).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Collocott, T. C. (ed.) | title = Dictionary of science and technology | publisher = W. and R. Chambers | location = Edinburgh | year = 1974 | isbn = 0-550-13202-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other illustrative examples of usage occur in the following articles:
*[[Connective tissue in skeletal muscle]]
*[[Dorsal artery of the penis]] (example of integument enclosing an internal organ)
*[[Flensing]]
*[[Flesh]] (generic use of plural &quot;integuments&quot;)

[[File:Wood router jmc 2005 03 12.jpg|thumb|A &quot;D-handle&quot; fixed-base router]]
A '''router '''{{efn|Pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɹ|aʊ|t|ə}} in [[British English]], {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɹ|aʊ|t|ɚ}} in [[American English|American]] and [[Australian English]]}}  is a hand [[tool]] or [[power tool]] that routs (hollows out) an area in hard material, such as wood or plastic. Routers are mainly used in [[woodworking]], especially [[cabinet making|cabinetry]]. Usually they're handheld or fastened, with the cutting end up, in router tables.

The [[hand tool]] type of router is the original form. It is a specialized [[plane (tool)|hand plane]] with a broad base and a narrow [[blade]] that projects well beyond its base plate (giving it the nickname ''old woman's tooth''). The [[power tool]] form of router, with a [[spindle (tool)|spindle]] driven by an [[electric motor]], is now the more common form. The hand tool version is now often called a ''router plane''; for some tasks, it still has a few advantages over the power tool. Some workers consider the electric router one of the most versatile woodworking power tools.&lt;ref&gt;Broun 1989&lt;/ref&gt; [[CNC wood router]]s implement the advantages of [[Computer Numerical Control]] (CNC).

Related to the router is a smaller, lighter version, designed specifically for trimming laminates. It can be used for smaller general routing work. For example, with an appropriate [[jig (tool)|jig]] it can be used for recessing [[hinge#Door hinges|door hinges]] and recessing lock faceplates. Even [[rotary tool]]s can be used as routers when the right bits and accessories (such as plastic router bases) are attached.

==History==
Before power routers existed, the hand tool form was frequently used, especially by [[pattern (casting)|patternmakers]] and [[staircase]] makers.

The first handheld power routers were invented in 1915{{cn|date=September 2019}} and were Jet Motor Hand Routers, called Onsruters. The name derives from a combination of the inventor's last name &quot;Onsrud&quot; and the term &quot;router&quot;. The Onsruter combined a router plane with an [[endmill]] to create the first handheld power router. The idea for the Onsruter started when a rail road company decided they wanted to power the front light on a [[steam locomotive]] using steam from the engine. Oscar Onsrud and his son Rudy submitted a design for an air turbine to generate the power for the light, however they didn't win the contract. A few months later Rudy Onsrud told a friend about his frustrations making the groove in the bottom of a cane bottom chair using a router plane. He suddenly realized that he could re-purpose the air turbine to run on compressed air and spin a modified endmill to rout the groove. Modified endmills would have to spin at 30,000 RPM, instead of the 3,000 RPM of a [[milling (machining)|milling machine]] to cut wood without burning it. The bits also needed a steeper rake and clearance angle than a traditional endmill so they could evacuate the [[swarf|chips]]. These new bits became known as [[router bit]]s or router cutters (UK).

Further refinement produced the plunge router, invented by ELU (now part of [[DeWalt]]) in Germany around 1949. This is even better adapted for many types of work.{{cn|date=September 2019}}

Starting in the 1960s, the power tool form of router became the more common form.

Modern routers are often used in place of traditional moulding planes or spindle moulder machines for edge decoration (moulding) of timber.

== Process ==
Routing is a high speed process of cutting, trimming, and shaping wood, metal, plastic, and a variety of other materials.

=== Chip formation ===
[[File:Modern plunge router.jpg|thumb|Modern plunge router showing dust extraction tube]]
Routing and [[milling machine|milling]] are conceptually similar, and [[end mill]]s can be used in routers, but routing wood is different from milling metal in terms of the mechanics. Chip formation is different, so the optimal tool geometry is different. Routing is properly applied to relatively weak and brittle materials, typically wood. As these materials are weak in small sections, routers can run at extremely high speeds, so even a small router may cut rapidly. Owing to inertia at these high speeds, the normal wood cutting mechanism of [[Type I chip]]s cannot take place. The cutter edge angle is blunt, approaching 90°, and so a [[Type III chip]] forms, with waste material produced as fine dust. This dust is a respiratory hazard, even in benign materials. The forces against the cutter are light, so routers may be hand-held.

When milling metals, the material is relatively ductile, although remaining [[strength of materials|strong]] even at a small scale. A [[Type II chip]] forms, and waste may be produced as continuous [[swarf]]. Cutter forces are high, so milling machines must be robust and rigid, usually substantial constructions of cast iron.

Intermediate materials, such as plastics and sometimes soft aluminium, may be cut by either method, though routing aluminium is usually more of an improvised expedient than a production process, and is noisy and hard on tools.

=== Process characteristics ===
[[File:Makita laminate trimmer.jpg|thumb|Makita [[laminate trimmer]]]]
Routing is usually limited to soft metals (aluminium etc.) and rigid non-metals. Specially designed cutters are used for a variety of patterns, cuts, and edging. Both hand controlled and machine controlled/aided routers are common today.

=== Workpiece geometry ===
Routing is a shaping process that produces finished edges and shapes. Some materials that are difficult to shape with other processes, such as fiber-glass, Kevlar, and graphite, can be shaped and finished neatly via various routing techniques. Apart from finished edges and shaping, cutaways, holes, and contours can also be shaped using routers.

== Tools and equipment ==
* The set up includes an air or electric driven router, a [[cutting tool]] often referred to as a '''router bit''', and a guide template. Also the router can be fixed to a table or connected to radial arms which can be controlled more easily.
* In general there are three types of cutting bits or tools.
*# Fluted cutters (used for edging and trimming)
*# Profile cutters (used for shaping and trimming)
*# Helical cutters (used on easily machined materials, for drilling, shaping, trimming)
* Safety glasses and ear protection should be worn at all times when using a router.
* Only trained adults, or trained adolescents with supervision, should use the router.

== Moulding ==
The spindle router is positioned at the finer end of the scale of work done by a [[molding (decorative)|moulding]] spindle. That is to say it is able to cut grooves, edge moulding, and [[chamfer]] or radius the edge of a piece of wood. It is also possible to use it for cutting some [[Woodworking joints|joints]]. The shape of cut that is created is determined by the size and shape of the bit (cutter) held in the [[collet]] and the depth by the depth adjustment of the sole plate.

== Variety of routers ==
There are a variety of router styles, some are plunge, some are D handled, some are double knob handled. Different manufacturers produce the routers for different wood works, as plunge routers, fixed-base wood routers, combo routers, variable-speed routers, laminate trimmers, CNC wood routers.{{cn|date=September 2019}} Nowadays, most better quality routers have variable speed controls and will have plunge bases that can also be locked in place so the router can be used as a fixed-base router.{{cn|date=September 2019}} Some have a soft-start feature, meaning they build up speed gradually. This feature is particularly desirable for routers with a large cutter. Holding a 3-horsepower router and turning it on without a soft-start is potentially dangerous, due to the torque of the motor. Holding it with two hands is a must. For routers with a toggle type on/off switch it is important to check to verify the switch is in the off position, prior to plugging it in. For safety, larger router cutters can usually only be used in a router that is mounted in a router table. This makes the tool even more versatile and stable.{{cn|date=September 2019}}

The purpose of multiple handle arrangements depends on the bit. Control is easier with different configurations. For example, when shaping the edge of a fine table top, many users prefer a D handle, with variable speed, as it seems to permit better control and burning the wood can be minimized.

Routers have many uses. With the help of the multitude of jigs and various bits, they are capable of producing dovetails, mortises, and tenons, moldings of infinite varieties, dados, [[Rabbet|rabbets/rebates]], raised-panel doors and frames, cutting circles, and so much more.{{cn|date=September 2019}}

== Features of the modern spindle router ==
[[File:RouterJig.jpg|thumb|template guide bushing secured in the base around the router cutter]]
The tool usually consists of a base housing a vertically mounted universal [[electric motor]] with a [[collet]] on the end of its shaft. The bit is height-adjustable to allow protrusion through an opening in a flat sole plate, usually via adjusting the motor-mounting height (the mechanism of adjustment is widely varied among manufacturers).  Control of the router is derived from a handle or knob on each side of the device, or by the more recently developed &quot;D-handle&quot;.

There are two standard types of router—plunge and fixed. When using a '''plunge-base router''', the sole of the base is placed on the face of the work with the cutting bit raised above the work, then the motor is turned on and the cutter is lowered into the work.  With a '''fixed-base router''', the cut depth is set before the tool is turned on.  The sole plate is then either rested flat on the workpiece overhanging the edge so that the cutting bit is not contacting the work (and then entering the work from the side once the motor is turned on), or the sole plate is placed at an angle with the bit above the work and the bit is &quot;rocked&quot; over into the work once the motor is turned on.  In each case, the bit cuts its way in, but the plunge router does it in a more refined way, although the bit used must be shaped so it bores into the wood when lowered.

The baseplate (sole plate) is generally circular (though this, too, varies by individual models) and may be used in conjunction with a fence attached to the base, which then braces the router against the edge of the work, or via a straight-edge clamped across the work to obtain a straight cut. Other means of guiding the machine include the template guide bushing secured in the base around the router cutter, or router cutters with built-in guide bearings. Both of these run against a straight edge or shaped template. Without this, the varying reaction of the wood against the [[torque]] of the tool makes it impossible to control with the precision normally required.

== Table mounted router ==
[[File:Router table showing router attached.jpg|thumb|right|View underneath a router table showing plunge router attached.]]
A router may be mounted upside down in a [[Router table (woodworking)|router table]] or bench. The router's base plate is mounted to the underside of the table, with a hole allowing the bit to protrude above the table top. This allows the work to be passed over the router, rather than passing the router over the work. This has benefits when working with smaller objects and makes some router operations safer to execute. A router table may be fitted with a [[Fence (woodworking)|fence]], fingerboards and other work-guiding accessories to make the operation safer and more accurate.

A simple router table consists of a rigid top with the router bolted or screwed directly to the underside. More complex solutions can be developed to allow the router to be easily removed from the table as well as facilitate adjusting the router's bit height using a ''lift'' mechanism; there is a wide range of commercially available systems.

In this mode, the router can perform tasks similar to a [[wood shaper|spindle moulder]].  For smaller, lighter jobs, the router used in this way can be more convenient than the spindle moulder, with the task of set up being somewhat faster. There is also a much wider range of bit profiles available for the router, although the size is limited.

The router table is usually oriented so that the router bit is vertical and the table over which the work is passed is horizontal. Variations on this include the horizontal router table, in which the table remains horizontal but the router is mounted vertically above the table, so that the router bit cuts from the side.  This alternative is for edge operations, such as panel raising and slot cutting.

== Available cutters ==
[[File:router bit profiles en.svg|frame|right|Profiles made in wood by several common router bits.]]
[[File:Routerbits.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Two typical router bits: (top) a ¼-inch shaft Roman Ogee with bearing, (bottom) 1/4-inch shaft dovetail bit.]]
'''Router bits''' come in sixteen thousand of varieties model to create either decorative effects or [[Woodworking joints|joinery]] aids. Generally, they are classified as either [[high-speed steel]] (HSS) or [[Tungsten carbide|carbide-tipped]], however some recent innovations such as solid carbide bits provide even more variety for specialized tasks.

Aside from the materials they are made of, bits can be classified as edge bits or non-edge bits, and whether the bit is designed to be ''anti-kickback''. Edge bits have a small wheel bearing to act as a fence against the work in making edge moldings. These bearings can be changed by using commercially available bearing kits. Changing the bearing, in effect, changes the diameter of the cutting edge. This is especially important with rabbeting/rebating bits. Non-edge bits require the use of a fence, either on a router table or attached to the work or router.  Anti-kickback bits employ added non-cutting bit material around the circumference of the bit's shoulders which serves to limit feed-rate. This reduces the chance that the workpiece is pushed too deeply into the bit (which would result in significant kickback from the cutting edge being unable to compensate).

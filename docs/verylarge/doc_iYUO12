Without halftoning, the three primary process colors could be printed only as solid blocks of color, and therefore could produce only seven colors: the three primaries themselves, plus three secondary colors produced by layering two of the primaries: cyan and yellow produce green, cyan and magenta produce blue, yellow and magenta produce red (these subtractive secondary colors correspond roughly to the additive primary colors), plus layering all three of them resulting in black. With halftoning, a full continuous range of colors can be produced.

=== Screen angle ===

{{main|Screen angle}}
To improve print quality and reduce [[moiré pattern]]s, the screen for each color is set at a different angle. While the angles depend on how many colors are used and the preference of the press operator, typical CMYK process printing uses any of the following screen angles:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Designer's Lexicon|last=Campbell|first=Alastair|page=192|publisher=Chronicle Books|year=2000|isbn=9780811826259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Real World Print Production|last=McCue|first=Claudia|year=2007|publisher=Peachpit|page=31|isbn=9780321410184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits of using black ink ==

The &quot;black&quot; generated by mixing commercially practical cyan, magenta, and yellow inks is unsatisfactory, so four-color printing uses black ink in addition to the subtractive primaries. Common reasons for using black ink include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = WWW.Color | author = Roger Pring | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Uq-hLlV-h7sC&amp;pg=PT178|page=178| publisher = Watson–Guptill | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-8230-5857-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In traditional preparation of color separations, a red keyline on the black line art marked the outline of solid or tint color areas. In some cases a black keyline was used when it served as both a color indicator and an outline to be printed in black because usually the black plate contained the keyline. The K in CMYK represents the keyline or black plate, also sometimes called the key plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/the-difference-between-rgb-and-cmyk-explained-1777830600|title=The Difference Between RGB and CMYK, Explained|last=Menegus|first=Bryan|website=[[Gizmodo]]|date=May 20, 2016|access-date=October 4, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Text is typically printed in black and includes fine detail (such as [[serif]]s), so to reproduce text or other finely detailed outlines, without slight blurring, using three inks would require impractically accurate [[printing registration|registration]].
* A combination of 100% cyan, magenta, and yellow inks soaks the paper with ink, making it slower to dry, causing bleeding, or (especially on cheap paper such as [[newsprint]]) weakening the paper so much that it tears.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}
* Although a combination of 100% cyan, magenta, and yellow inks should, in theory, completely absorb the entire [[visible spectrum]] of light and produce a perfect black, practical inks fall short of their ideal characteristics and the result is actually a dark muddy color that does not quite appear black. Adding black ink absorbs more light and yields much better blacks.
* Using black ink is less expensive than using the corresponding amounts of colored inks.

When a very dark area is desirable, a coloured or gray CMY &quot;bedding&quot; is applied first, then a full black layer is applied on top, making a rich, deep black; this is called ''[[rich black]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Guild Handbook of Scientific Illustration |author=R. S. Hodges|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YWaOBSjevD0C&amp;pg=PA242|page=242|year=2003|publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=0-471-36011-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A black made with just CMY inks is sometimes called a ''composite black''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3iuwCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA331|page=331|title=Forensic Chemistry: Fundamentals and Applications|last=Sigel|first=Jay A.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2015|isbn=978-1-118-89772-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of black to use to replace amounts of the other ink is variable, and the choice depends on the technology, paper and ink in use. Processes called [[under color removal]], [[under color addition]], and [[gray component replacement]] are used to decide on the final mix; different CMYK recipes will be used depending on the printing task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VrdqBRgSKasC&amp;pg=PA87|page=87|title=Handbook of Print Media: Technologies and Production Methods|editor-last=Kipphan|editor-first=Helmut|publisher=
Springer|year=2001|isbn=3-540-67326-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other printer color models ==
CMYK or process color printing is contrasted with [[spot color]] printing, in which specific colored inks are used to generate the colors appearing on paper. Some printing presses are capable of printing with both four-color process inks and additional spot color inks at the same time. High-quality printed materials, such as marketing brochures and books, often include photographs requiring process-color printing, other graphic effects requiring spot colors (such as metallic inks), and finishes such as varnish, which enhances the glossy appearance of the printed piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.frontsigns.com/blog/top-large-format-printing-tips-to-achieve-the-highest-quality/|title=Top 8 Large Format Printing Tips To Achieve High-End Projects|last=Davies|first=Helen|website=frontsigns.com|date=August 3, 2020|access-date=October 4, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CMYK are the process printers which often have a relatively small color [[gamut]]. Processes such as [[Pantone]]'s proprietary six-color (CMYKOG) [[Hexachrome]] considerably expand the gamut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/5008/1/3D-color-separation-maximizing-the-printer-gamut/10.1117/12.472012.short?SSO=1|title=3-D Color Separation Maximizing the Printer Gamut|last=Zeng|first=Huanzhao|journal=[[Proceedings of SPIE]]|volume=5008|year=2003|doi=10.1117/12.472012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Light, saturated colors often cannot be created with CMYK, and light colors in general may make visible the halftone pattern. Using a [[CcMmYK color model|CcMmYK process]], with the addition of light cyan and magenta inks to CMYK, can solve these problems, and such a process is used by many [[inkjet]] printers, including desktop models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Sams Teach Yourself Adobe Photoshop Elements 2 in 24 Hours | author = Carla Rose | url = https://archive.org/details/samsteachyoursel00rose_4| url-access = registration | page = 108|publisher = Sams Publishing | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-672-32430-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison with RGB displays ==
[[File:CIE1931xy gamut comparison.svg|thumb|Comparison of some RGB and CMYK color gamut on a [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE 1931]] xy chromaticity diagram.]]
Comparisons between [[RGB]] displays and CMYK prints can be difficult, since the color reproduction technologies and properties are very different. A computer monitor mixes shades of red, green, and blue light to create color pictures. A CMYK printer instead uses light-absorbing cyan, magenta, and yellow inks, whose colors are mixed using [[dithering]], [[halftoning]], or some other optical technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/color.html|title=About color|publisher=[[Adobe Inc.]]|access-date=October 4, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to monitors, the inks used in printing produce a color gamut that is &quot;only a subset of the visible spectrum&quot; although both color modes have their own specific ranges. As a result of this, items which are displayed on a computer monitor may not completely match the look of items which are printed if opposite color modes are being combined in both mediums.&lt;ref&gt;Damien van Holten, print international.org, &quot;RGB Vs CMYK&quot; http://www.printernational.org/rgb-versus-cmyk.php&lt;/ref&gt; When designing items to be printed, designers view the colors which they are choosing on an RGB color mode (their computer screen), and it is often difficult to visualize the way in which the color will turn out post-printing because of this.

=== Spectrum of printed paper ===
To reproduce color, the CMYK color model codes for absorbing light rather than emitting it (as is assumed by RGB). The 'K' component absorbs all wavelengths and is therefore achromatic. The Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow components are used for color reproduction and they may be viewed as the inverse of RGB. Cyan absorbs Red, Magenta absorbs Green, and Yellow absorbs Blue (-R,-G,-B).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.physics.wisc.edu/ingersollmuseum/exhibits/opticscolor/subcolormix/|title=Subtractive Color Mixing|publisher=[[L. R. Ingersoll Physics Museum]]|access-date=October 4, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;


[[File:CMYK Spectrum printed paper.pdf|thumb|center|800px|Spectrum of the visible wavelengths on printed paper (SCA Graphosilk). Shown is the transition from Red to Yellow. White, red, blue, and green are shown for reference. Readings from a white orchid flower, a rose (red and yellow petals), and a red cyclamen flower are shown for comparison. The units of spectral power are simply raw sensor values (with a linear response at specific wavelengths).]]

== Conversion ==
[[File:NIEdot367.jpg|thumb|Early representation of the three-color process (1902).]]
Since RGB and CMYK spaces are both device-dependent spaces, there is no simple or general conversion formula that converts between them. Conversions are generally done through [[color management]] systems, using [[color profile]]s that describe the spaces being converted. An ICC profile defines the bidirectional conversion between a neutral &quot;profile connection&quot; color space (CIE XYZ or Lab) and a colorspace we are interested in, in this case both RGB and CMYK. The precision of the conversion depends on the profile itself, the exact methodology, and because the [[gamut]]s do not generally match, the [[rendering intent]] and constraints such as ink limit.

ICC profiles, internally built out of lookup tables and other transformation functions, are capable of handling many effects of ink blending. One example is the [[dot gain]], which show up as non-linear components in the color-to-density mapping. More complex interactions such as ''Neugebauer'' blending can be modelled in higher-dimension lookup tables.

The problem of computing a colorimetric estimate of the color that results from printing various combinations of ink has been addressed by many scientists.&lt;ref name = Sharma&gt;{{cite book | title = Digital Color Imaging Handbook | author = Gaurav Sharma | year = 2003 | publisher = CRC Press | isbn = 0-8493-0900-X | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AkByHKRGTsQC&amp;pg=PA68|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; A general method that has emerged for the case of halftone printing is to treat each tiny overlap of color dots as one of 8 (combinations of CMY) or of 16 (combinations of CMYK) colors, which in this context are known as ''[[Neugebauer primary|Neugebauer primaries]]''. The resultant color would be an area-weighted colorimetric combination of these primary colors, except that the ''Yule–Nielsen'' effect of scattered light between and within the areas complicates the physics and the analysis; empirical formulas for such analysis have been developed, in terms of detailed dye combination absorption spectra and empirical parameters.&lt;ref name = Sharma/&gt;

Standardization of printing practices allow for some profiles to be predefined. One of them is the US [[Specifications for Web Offset Publications]] (SWOP), which has its ICC color profile built into many software including [[Microsoft Office]] (as [[Agfa-Gevaert|Agfa]] RSWOP.icm).{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

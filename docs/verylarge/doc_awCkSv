=== Boer organisation and skills ===
War was declared on 11 October 1899 with a Boer offensive into the British-held Natal and Cape Colony areas. The Boers had about 33,000 soldiers, and decisively outnumbered the British, who could move only 13,000 troops to the front line.{{sfn|Searle|2004|p=276}} The Boers had no problems with mobilisation, since the fiercely independent Boers had no regular army units, apart from the ''Staatsartillerie'' (Afrikaans for 'States Artillery') of both republics. As with the First Boer War, since most of the Boers were members of civilian militias, none had adopted uniforms or insignia. Only the members of the ''Staatsartillerie'' wore light green uniforms.

When danger loomed, all the ''burgers'' (citizens) in a district would form a military unit called a ''commando'' and would elect officers. A full-time official titled a ''Veldkornet'' maintained muster rolls, but had no disciplinary powers. Each man brought his own weapon, usually a hunting rifle, and his own horse. Those who could not afford a gun were given one by the authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;André Wessels 2000 p.80&quot; /&gt; The Presidents of the Transvaal and Orange Free State simply signed decrees to concentrate within a week and the Commandos could muster between 30,000 and 40,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pakenham|1979|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average Boer nevertheless was not thirsty for war. Many did not look forward to fighting against fellow Christians and, by and large, fellow Christian Protestants. Many may have had an overly optimistic sense of what the war would involve, imagining that victory could be won as easily as in the First South African War.{{sfn|Wessels|2000|p=74}} Many, including many generals, also had a sense that their cause was holy and just, and blessed by God.{{sfn|Pretorius|2000|p=179}}

It rapidly became clear that the Boer forces presented the British forces with a severe tactical challenge. What the Boers presented was a mobile and innovative approach to warfare, drawing on their experiences from the First Boer War. The average Boers who made up their Commandos were farmers who had spent almost all their working life in the saddle, both as farmers and hunters. They depended on the pot, horse and rifle; they were also skilled stalkers and marksmen. As hunters they had learned to fire from cover; from a [[prone position]] and to make the first shot count, knowing that if they missed, the game would either be long gone or could charge and potentially kill them.

At community gatherings, target shooting was a major sport; they practised shooting at targets such as hens' eggs perched on posts {{convert|100|m|yd}} away. They made expert mounted infantry, using every scrap of cover, from which they could pour in a destructive fire using modern, smokeless, [[Mauser]] rifles. In preparation for hostilities, the Boers had acquired around one hundred of the latest [[Krupp]] [[8 cm Kanone C/80|field guns]], all horse-drawn and dispersed among the various Kommando groups and several [[Le Creusot]] &quot;[[155 mm Creusot Long Tom|Long Tom]]&quot; siege guns. The Boers' skill in adapting themselves to become first-rate artillerymen shows them to have been a versatile adversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pakenham|1979|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Transvaal also had an intelligence service that stretched across South Africa and of whose extent and efficiency the British were as yet unaware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wessels|2000|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Boers besiege Ladysmith, Mafeking and Kimberley ===
[[File:NorthNatalWarTheatre, colour, crop.png|thumb|right|War theatre in northern Natal]]
The Boers struck first on 12 October at the [[Battle of Kraaipan]], an attack that heralded the invasion of the [[Cape Colony]] and [[Colony of Natal]] between October 1899 and January 1900. With speed and surprise, the Boer drove quickly towards the British garrison at Ladysmith and the smaller ones at Mafeking and Kimberley. The quick Boer mobilisation resulted in early military successes against scattered British forces. Sir [[George White (British Army officer)|George Stuart White]], commanding the British division at [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|Ladysmith]], had unwisely allowed Major-General [[Penn Symons]] to throw a brigade forward to the coal-mining town of Dundee (also reported as Glencoe), which was surrounded by hills. This became the site of the first engagement of the war, the [[Battle of Talana Hill]]. Boer guns began shelling the British camp from the summit of Talana Hill at dawn on 20 October. Penn Symons immediately counter-attacked: his infantry drove the Boers from the hill, for the loss of 446 British casualties, including Penn Symons.

Another Boer force occupied Elandslaagte, which lay between Ladysmith and Dundee. The British under Major General [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|John French]] and Colonel [[Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton|Ian Hamilton]] attacked to clear the line of communications to Dundee. The resulting [[Battle of Elandslaagte]] was a clear-cut British tactical victory, but Sir George White feared that more Boers were about to attack his main position and so ordered a chaotic retreat from Elandslaagte, throwing away any advantage gained. The detachment from Dundee was compelled to make an exhausting cross-country retreat to rejoin White's main force. As Boers surrounded Ladysmith and opened fire on the town with siege guns, White ordered a major sortie against their artillery positions. The result was a disaster, with 140 men killed and over 1,000 captured. The [[Siege of Ladysmith]] began, and was to last several months.

Meanwhile, to the north-west at Mafeking, on the border with Transvaal, Colonel [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]] had raised two regiments of local forces amounting to about 1,200 men in order to attack and create diversions if things further south went amiss. Mafeking, being a railway junction, provided good supply facilities and was the obvious place for Baden-Powell to fortify in readiness for such attacks. However, instead of being the aggressor Baden-Powell and Mafeking were forced to defend when 6,000 Boer, commanded by [[Piet Cronjé]], attempted a determined assault on the town. But this quickly subsided into a desultory affair with the Boers prepared to starve the stronghold into submission, and so, on 13 October, began the 217-day [[Siege of Mafeking]].

Lastly, over {{convert|360|km|mi}} to the south of Mafeking lay the diamond mining city of Kimberley, which was also subjected to a [[Siege of Kimberley|siege]]. Although not militarily significant, it nonetheless represented an enclave of British imperialism on the borders of the [[Orange Free State]] and was hence an important Boer objective. From early November about 7,500 Boer began their siege, again content to starve the town into submission. Despite Boer shelling, the 40,000 inhabitants, of which only 5,000 were armed, were under little threat as the town was well-stocked with provisions. The garrison was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel [[Robert Kekewich]], although [[Cecil Rhodes]] was also a prominent figure in the town's defences.

Siege life took its toll on both the defending soldiers and the civilians in the cities of Mafeking, Ladysmith, and Kimberley as food began to grow scarce after a few weeks. In Mafeking, [[Sol Plaatje]] wrote, &quot;I saw horseflesh for the first time being treated as a human foodstuff.&quot; The cities under siege also dealt with constant artillery bombardment, making the streets a dangerous place. Near the end of the siege of Kimberley, it was expected that the Boers would intensify their bombardment, so Rhodes displayed a notice encouraging people to go down into shafts of the [[Big Hole|Kimberley Mine]] for protection. The townspeople panicked, and people surged into the mine-shafts constantly for a 12-hour period. Although the bombardment never came, this did nothing to diminish the anxious civilians distress.  The most well-heeled of the townspeople, such as Cecil Rhodes, sheltered in the Sanatorium, site of the present-day [[McGregor Museum]]; the poorer residents, notably the black population, did not have any shelter from the shelling.

In retrospect, the Boer decision to commit themselves to sieges (''[[Sitzkrieg]]'') was a mistake and one of the best illustrations of the Boers' lack of strategic vision.  Historically, it had little in its favour. Of the seven sieges in the First Boer War, the Boers had won none. More importantly, it handed the initiative back to the British and allowed them time to recover, which they then did.  Generally speaking, throughout the campaign, the Boers were too defensive and passive, wasting the opportunities they had for victory.  Yet that passiveness also testified to the fact that they had no desire to conquer British territory, but only to preserve their ability to rule in their own territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wessels|2000|pp=82–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First British relief attempts ===
[[File:VCRedversHenryBuller.jpg|thumb|upright|General [[Redvers Henry Buller]] launched an offensive against the Boers in the early phases of the war but after several defeats, culminating at the [[Battle of Colenso]], he was replaced by [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Earl Roberts]].]]

By February 1900 General Sir [[Redvers Henry Buller]], a much respected commander, arrived in South Africa with the Army Corps, made up of the [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|1st]], [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd]] and [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd divisions]]. Buller originally intended an offensive straight up the railway line leading from [[Cape Town]] through [[Bloemfontein]] to [[Pretoria]]. Finding on arrival that the British troops already in South Africa were under siege, he split his army corps into detachments to relieve the besieged garrisons. One division, led by Lieutenant General [[Paul Methuen, 3rd Baron Methuen|Lord Methuen]], was to follow the Western Railway to the north and relieve Kimberley and Mafeking. A smaller force of about 3,000 led by Major General [[William Forbes Gatacre|William Gatacre]], was to push north toward the railway junction at Stormberg, to secure the [[Cape Midlands]] district from Boer raids and local rebellions by Boer inhabitants and Buller led the major part of the army corps to relieve Ladysmith to the east.

The initial results of this offensive were mixed, with Methuen winning several bloody skirmishes in the [[Battle of Belmont (1899)|Battle of Belmont]] on 23 November, the [[Battle of Graspan]] on 25 November, and at a larger engagement, the [[Battle of Modder River]] on 28 November resulting in British losses of 71 dead and over 400 wounded. British commanders had trained on the lessons of the [[Crimean War]] and were adept at battalion and regimental set pieces with columns manoeuvring in jungles, deserts and mountainous regions. What British generals failed to comprehend was the impact of destructive fire from trench positions and the mobility of cavalry raids. The British troops went to war with what would prove to be antiquated tactics and in some cases antiquated weapons against the mobile Boer forces with the destructive fire of their modern Mausers, the latest Krupp field guns and their novel tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Field Marshal Lord Carver, ''The Boer War'', pp. 259–62&lt;/ref&gt;

The middle of December was disastrous for the British Army.  In a period known as [[Black Week]] (10–15 December 1899), the British suffered defeats on each of the three fronts.  On 10 December, General Gatacre tried to recapture Stormberg railway junction about {{convert|50|mi|km|order=flip}} south of the [[Orange River]].  Gatacre's attack was marked by administrative and tactical blunders and the [[Battle of Stormberg]] ended in a British defeat, with 135 killed and wounded and two guns and over 600 troops captured.

At the [[Battle of Magersfontein]] on 11 December, Methuen's 14,000 British troops attempted to capture a Boer position in a dawn attack to relieve Kimberley. This too turned into a disaster when the [[Highland Brigade (Scottish)|Highland Brigade]] became pinned down by accurate Boer fire. After suffering from intense heat and thirst for nine hours, they eventually broke in ill-disciplined retreat. The Boer commanders, [[Koos de la Rey]] and [[Piet Cronjé]], had ordered [[trench]]es to be dug in an unconventional place to fool the British and to give their riflemen a greater firing range. The plan worked and this tactic helped write the doctrine of the supremacy of the defensive position, using modern small arms and trench fortifications.&lt;ref&gt;'Historical Overview' in Antony O'Brien, ''Bye-Bye Dolly Gray''&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} The British lost 120 killed and 690 wounded and were prevented from relieving Kimberley and Mafeking. A British soldier said of the defeat

{{quote|Such was the day for our regiment&lt;br /&gt;Dread the revenge we will take.&lt;br /&gt;Dearly we paid for the blunder –&lt;br /&gt;A drawing-room General's mistake.&lt;br /&gt;Why weren't we told of the trenches?&lt;br /&gt;Why weren't we told of the wire? &lt;br /&gt;Why were we marched up in column,&lt;br /&gt;May [[Tommy Atkins]] enquire&amp;nbsp;...|Private Smith&lt;ref&gt;From the ''&quot;Battle of Magersfontein,&quot;'' verse by Private Smith of the Black Watch December 1899. (Quoted in {{Harvnb|Pakenham|1979|p=115}})&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[nadir]] of [[Black Week]] was the Battle of Colenso on 15 December, where 21,000 British troops commanded by Buller attempted to cross the [[Tugela River]] to relieve Ladysmith, where 8,000 Transvaal Boers under the command of [[Louis Botha]] were awaiting them.  Through a combination of artillery and accurate rifle fire and better use of the ground, the Boers repelled all British attempts to cross the river.  After his first attacks failed, Buller broke off the battle and ordered a retreat, abandoning many wounded men, several isolated units and ten field guns to be captured by Botha's men. Buller's forces lost 145 men killed and 1,200 missing or wounded and the Boers suffered only 40 casualties, including 8 killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steele|2000|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second phase: The British offensive of January to September 1900 ==
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2020}}
[[File:British casualties, Spionkop, 1900.jpg|thumb|British casualties lie dead on the battlefield after the [[Battle of Spion Kop]], 24 January 1900.]]
The British government took these defeats badly and with the sieges still continuing was compelled to send two more divisions plus large numbers of colonial volunteers. By January 1900 this would become the largest force Britain had ever sent overseas, amounting to some 180,000 men with further reinforcements being sought.

While watching for these reinforcements, Buller made another bid to relieve Ladysmith by crossing the Tugela west of [[Colenso, KwaZulu-Natal|Colenso]]. Buller's subordinate, Major General [[Charles Warren]], successfully crossed the river, but was then faced with a fresh defensive position centred on a prominent hill known as Spion Kop. In the resulting [[Battle of Spion Kop]], British troops captured the summit by surprise during the early hours of 24 January 1900, but as the early morning fog lifted they realised too late that they were overlooked by Boer gun emplacements on the surrounding hills. The rest of the day resulted in a disaster caused by poor communication between Buller and his commanders. Between them they issued contradictory orders, on the one hand ordering men off the hill, while other officers ordered fresh reinforcements to defend it. The result was 350 men killed and nearly 1,000 wounded and a retreat across the Tugela River into British territory. There were nearly 300 Boer casualties.

Buller attacked Louis Botha again on 5 February at [[Battle of Vaal Krantz|Vaal Krantz]] and was again defeated. Buller withdrew early when it appeared that the British would be isolated in an exposed bridgehead across the Tugela, for which he was nicknamed &quot;Sir Reverse&quot; by some of his officers.

===Buller replaced===
[[File:Peter de wet01.jpg|thumb|left|Boer General Piet de Wet, 1900]]
By taking command in person in Natal, Buller had allowed the overall direction of the war to drift. Because of concerns about his performance and negative reports from the field, he was replaced as Commander in Chief by [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Field Marshal Lord Roberts]]. Roberts quickly assembled an entirely new team for headquarters staff and he chose military men from far and wide: [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] (Chief of Staff) from the Sudan; [[Frederick Russell Burnham]] (Chief of Scouts), the American scout, from the Klondike; [[George Francis Robert Henderson|George Henderson]] from the Staff College; [[Neville Bowles Chamberlain]] from Afghanistan; and [[William Nicholson, 1st Baron Nicholson|William Nicholson]] (Military Secretary) from Calcutta.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Like Buller, Roberts first intended to attack directly along the Cape Town–Pretoria railway but, again like Buller, was forced to relieve the beleaguered garrisons. Leaving Buller in command in Natal, Roberts massed his main force near the [[Orange River]] and along the Western Railway behind Methuen's force at the [[Modder River]], and prepared to make a wide outflanking move to relieve Kimberley.

[[File:Inniskillings al colle di Hart.jpg|thumb|Siege of Ladysmith]]
Except in Natal, the war had stagnated. Other than a single attempt to storm Ladysmith, the Boers made no attempt to capture the besieged towns. In the Cape Midlands, the Boers did not exploit the British defeat at Stormberg, and were prevented from capturing the railway junction at [[Colesberg]]. In the dry summer, the grazing on the veld became parched, weakening the Boers' horses and draught oxen, and many Boer families joined their menfolk in the siege lines and ''laagers'' (encampments), fatally encumbering Cronjé's army.

===Roberts relieve the sieges===
Roberts launched his main attack on 10 February 1900 and although hampered by a long supply route, managed to outflank the Boers defending [[Magersfontein]]. On 14 February, a cavalry division under Major General [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|John French]] launched a major attack to relieve Kimberley. Although encountering severe fire, a massed cavalry charge split the Boer defences on 15 February, opening the way for French to enter Kimberley that evening, ending its 124 days' siege.

Meanwhile, Roberts pursued Piet Cronjé's 7,000-strong force, which had abandoned Magersfontein to head for Bloemfontein. General French's cavalry was ordered to assist in the pursuit by embarking on an epic {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} drive towards Paardeberg where Cronjé was attempting to cross the Modder River. At the [[Battle of Paardeberg]] from 18 to 27 February, Roberts then surrounded General [[Piet Cronjé]]'s retreating Boer army. On 17 February, a pincer movement involving both French's cavalry and the main British force attempted to take the entrenched position, but the frontal attacks were uncoordinated and so were repulsed by the Boers. Finally, Roberts resorted to bombarding Cronjé into submission. It took ten days, and when the British troops used the polluted Modder River as water supply, [[typhoid]] killed many troops. General Cronjé was forced to surrender at [[Surrender Hill]] with 4,000 men.

In Natal, the [[Battle of the Tugela Heights]], which started on 14 February was Buller's fourth attempt to relieve Ladysmith. The losses Buller's troops had sustained convinced Buller to adopt Boer tactics &quot;in the firing line—to advance in small rushes, covered by rifle fire from behind; to use the tactical support of artillery; and above all, to use the ground, making rock and earth work for them as it did for the enemy.&quot; Despite reinforcements his progress was painfully slow against stiff opposition. However, on 26 February, after much deliberation, Buller used all his forces in one all-out attack for the first time and at last succeeded in forcing a crossing of the Tugela to defeat Botha's outnumbered forces north of Colenso. After a siege lasting 118 days, the [[Relief of Ladysmith]] was effected, the day after Cronjé surrendered, but at a total cost of 7,000 British casualties. Buller's troops marched into Ladysmith on 28 February.{{sfn|Pakenham|1991a|p=573}}

After a succession of defeats, the Boers realised that against such overwhelming numbers of troops, they had little chance of defeating the British and so became demoralised. Roberts then advanced into the Orange Free State from the west, putting the Boers to flight at the [[Battle of Poplar Grove]] and capturing [[Bloemfontein]], the capital, unopposed on 13 March with the Boer defenders escaping and scattering. Meanwhile, he detached a small force to relieve Baden-Powell. The [[Relief of Mafeking]] on 18 May 1900 provoked riotous celebrations in Britain, the origin of the Edwardian slang word &quot;mafficking&quot;.  On 28 May, the Orange Free State was annexed and renamed the Orange River Colony.

===Capture of Pretoria===
After being forced to delay for several weeks at Bloemfontein by a shortage of supplies, an outbreak of typhoid at Paardeburg, and poor medical care, Roberts finally resumed his advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Paterson|first=Andrew Barton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vEV1AAAAMAAJ|title=From the Front: Dispatches from the Boer War|publisher=[[Pan Macmillan]]|year=2000|isbn=978-0-7329-1062-4|editor-last=Droogleever|editor-first=R. W. F.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was forced to halt again at Kroonstad for 10 days, due once again to the collapse of his medical and supply systems, but finally captured Johannesburg on 31 May and the capital of the Transvaal, [[Pretoria]], on 5 June. The first into Pretoria was Lt. William Watson of the New South Wales Mounted Rifles, who persuaded the Boers to surrender the capital.{{sfn|Wilcox|2002|pp=84-85}} Before the war, the Boers had constructed several forts south of Pretoria, but the artillery had been removed from the forts for use in the field, and in the event they abandoned Pretoria without a fight. Having won the principal cities, Roberts declared the war over on 3 September 1900; and the South African Republic was formally annexed.

British observers believed the war to be all but over after the capture of the two capital cities. However, the Boers had earlier met at the temporary new capital of the Orange Free State, [[Kroonstad]], and planned a guerrilla campaign to hit the British supply and communication lines. The first engagement of this new form of warfare was at [[Sanna's Post]] on 31 March where 1,500 Boers under the command of [[Christiaan De Wet|Christiaan de Wet]] attacked Bloemfontein's waterworks about {{convert|23|mi|km|order=flip}} east of the city, and ambushed a heavily escorted convoy, which caused 155 British casualties and the capture of seven guns, 117 wagons, and 428 British troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Speed, Neil G.|title=Born to fight : Major Charles Joseph Ross DSO, a definitive study of his life|date=2002|publisher=Caps &amp; Flints Press|isbn=0-9581356-0-6|location=Melbourne|oclc=61567917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PACronje CHM VA2863.jpg|thumb|right|General [[Piet Cronjé]] as a prisoner of war in Saint Helena, 1900–02. He was captured, with 4,000 men, after the loss of the [[Battle of Paardeberg]].]]
After the fall of Pretoria, one of the last formal battles was at [[Battle of Diamond Hill|Diamond Hill]] on 11–12 June, where Roberts attempted to drive the remnants of the Boer field army under Botha beyond striking distance of Pretoria. Although Roberts drove the Boers from the hill, Botha did not regard it as a defeat, for he inflicted 162 casualties on the British while suffering only around 50 casualties.

===Boers retreat===
The set-piece period of the war now largely gave way to a mobile guerrilla war, but one final operation remained. President Kruger and what remained of the Transvaal government had retreated to eastern Transvaal. Roberts, joined by troops from Natal under Buller, advanced against them, and broke their last defensive position at [[Battle of Bergendal|Bergendal]] on 26 August. As Roberts and Buller followed up along the railway line to [[Komatipoort]], Kruger sought asylum in Portuguese East Africa (modern [[Mozambique]]). Some dispirited Boers did likewise, and the British gathered up much war material. However, the core of the Boer fighters under Botha easily broke back through the [[Drakensberg]] Mountains into the Transvaal highveld after riding north through the bushveld.

As Roberts's army occupied Pretoria, the Boer fighters in the Orange Free State retreated into the Brandwater Basin, a fertile area in the north-east of the Republic. This offered only temporary sanctuary, as the mountain passes leading to it could be occupied by the British, trapping the Boers. A force under General [[Archibald Hunter]] set out from Bloemfontein to achieve this in July 1900. The hard core of the Free State Boers under De Wet, accompanied by President Steyn, left the basin early. Those remaining fell into confusion and most failed to break out before Hunter trapped them. 4,500 Boers surrendered and much equipment was captured but as with Roberts's drive against Kruger at the same time, these losses were of relatively little consequence, as the hard core of the Boer armies and their most determined and active leaders remained at large.

From the Basin, Christiaan de Wet headed west. Although hounded by British columns, he succeeded in crossing the Vaal into western Transvaal, to allow Steyn to travel to meet their leaders.  There was much sympathy for the Boers on mainland Europe. In October, President Kruger and members of the Transvaal government left Portuguese East Africa on the Dutch warship ''[[De Gelderland]]'', sent by the Queen [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]]. Paul Kruger's wife, however, was too ill to travel and remained in South Africa where she died on 20 July 1901 without seeing her husband again. President Kruger first went to Marseille and then on to the Netherlands, where he stayed for a while before moving finally to [[Clarens, Switzerland]], where he died in exile on 14 July 1904.

=== POWs sent overseas ===
The first sizeable batch of Boer prisoners of war taken by the British consisted of those captured at the [[Battle of Elandslaagte]] on 21 October 1899. At first, many were put on ships, but as numbers grew, the British decided they did not want them kept locally. The capture of 400 POWs in February 1900 was a key event, which made the British realise they could not accommodate all POWs in South Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;collint&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boerwarsociety.org/Interests.cfm|title=Anglo-Boer War Philatelic Society: Collecting Interests|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051210040529/http://www.boerwarsociety.org/Interests.cfm|archive-date=10 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British feared they could be freed by sympathetic locals. Moreover, they already had trouble supplying their own troops in South Africa, and did not want the added burden of sending supplies for the POWs. Britain therefore chose to send many POWs overseas.

There are no records of Boer POWs being sent to the Dominions of the British Empire such as Australia, Canada, or New Zealand.&lt;ref name=&quot;collint&quot; /&gt;

In all, nearly 26,000 POWs were sent overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/projects/Anglo-Boere-Oorlog-Boer-War-1899-1902-Prisoners-Of-War/12770|title=Anglo Boere Oorlog/Boer War (1899-1902) Prisoners Of War genealogy project|website=geni_family_tree|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oath of neutrality ===
On 15 March 1900, Lord Roberts proclaimed an amnesty for all [[Burgher (Boer republics)|burghers]], except leaders, who took an oath of neutrality and returned quietly to their homes.{{sfn|Cameron|1986|p=207}} It is estimated that between 12,000 and 14,000 burghers took this oath between March and June 1900.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=46}}

== Third phase: Guerrilla war (September 1900 – May 1902) ==
[[File:StateLibQld 1 102586 Lord Herbert Kichener on horseback..jpg|thumb|upright|Kitchener succeeded Roberts in November 1900 and launched anti-guerrilla campaigns. 1898 photograph in 1910 magazine.]]
By September 1900, the British were nominally in control of both Republics, with the exception of the northern part of Transvaal. However, they soon discovered that they only controlled the territory their columns physically occupied. Despite the loss of their two capital cities and half of their army, the Boer commanders adopted [[guerrilla warfare]] tactics, primarily conducting raids against railways, resource and supply targets, all aimed at disrupting the operational capacity of the British Army. They avoided pitched battles and casualties were light.

Each Boer commando unit was sent to the district from which its members had been recruited, which meant that they could rely on local support and personal knowledge of the terrain and the towns within the district thereby enabling them to live off the land. Their orders were simply to act against the British whenever possible. Their tactics were to strike fast and hard causing as much damage to the enemy as possible, and then to withdraw and vanish before enemy reinforcements could arrive. The vast distances of the Republics allowed the Boer commandos considerable freedom to move about and made it nearly impossible for the 250,000 British troops to control the territory effectively using columns alone. As soon as a British column left a town or district, British control of that area faded away.

The Boer commandos were especially effective during the initial guerrilla phase of the war because Roberts had assumed that the war would end with the capture of the Boer capitals and the dispersal of the main Boer armies. Many British troops were therefore redeployed out of the area, and had been replaced by lower-quality contingents of [[Imperial Yeomanry]] and locally raised irregular corps.

From late May 1900, the first successes of the Boer guerrilla strategy were at Lindley (where 500 Yeomanry surrendered), and at Heilbron (where a large convoy and its escort were captured) and other skirmishes resulting in 1,500 British casualties in less than ten days. In December 1900, De la Rey and [[Christiaan Beyers]] attacked and mauled a British brigade at [[Battle of Nooitgedacht|Nooitgedacht]]. As a result of these and other Boer successes, the British, led by Lord Kitchener, mounted three extensive searches for [[Christiaan de Wet]], but without success. However, the very nature of the Boer guerrilla war and the Boer raids on British camps were sporadic, poorly planned, and had little overall long-term objective, with the exception to simply harass the British. This led to a disorganised pattern of scattered engagements between the British and the Boers throughout the region.

===British response===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Blockhouse]] --&gt;
The British were forced to quickly revise their tactics. They concentrated on restricting the freedom of movement of the Boer commandos and depriving them of local support. The railway lines had provided vital lines of communication and supply, and as the British had advanced across South Africa, they had used [[armoured train]]s and had established fortified [[blockhouses]] at key points.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot; /&gt; They now built additional blockhouses (each housing 6–8 soldiers) and fortified these to protect supply routes against Boer [[raid (military)|raiders]]. Eventually some 8,000 such blockhouses were built across the two South African republics, radiating from the larger towns along principal routes. Each blockhouse cost between £800 to £1,000 and took about three months to build. They proved very effective; not one bridge at which a blockhouse was sited and manned was blown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot; /&gt;

The blockhouse system required an enormous number of troops to garrison. Well over 50,000 British troops, or 50 battalions, were involved in blockhouse duty, greater than the approximately 30,000 Boers in the field during the guerrilla phase. In addition, up to 16,000 Africans were used both as armed guards and to patrol the line at night.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Army linked the blockhouses with barbed wire fences to parcel up the wide veld into smaller areas. &quot;New Model&quot; drives were mounted under which a continuous line of troops could sweep an area of veld bounded by blockhouse lines, unlike the earlier inefficient scouring of the countryside by scattered columns.

[[File:VerskroeideAarde1.jpg|thumb|left|One British response to the guerrilla war was a '[[scorched earth]]' policy to deny the guerrillas supplies and refuge. In this image [[Boer]] civilians watch their house as it is burned.]]
The British also implemented a &quot;[[scorched earth]]&quot; policy under which they targeted everything within the controlled areas that could give sustenance to the Boer guerrillas with a view to making it harder for the Boers to survive. As British troops swept the countryside, they systematically destroyed crops, burned homesteads and farms, in some cases raping the resident women and children as young as 10,&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stead|first=W.

Finally, the British also established their own mounted raiding columns in support of the sweeper columns. These were used to rapidly follow and relentlessly harass the Boers with a view to delaying them and cutting off escape, while the sweeper units caught up. Many of the 90 or so mobile columns formed by the British to participate in such drives were a mixture of British and colonial troops, but they also had a large minority of armed Africans. The total number of armed Africans serving with these columns has been estimated at approximately 20,000.

The British Army also made use of Boer auxiliaries who had been persuaded to change sides and enlist as &quot;National Scouts&quot;. Serving under the command of General Andries Cronjé, the National Scouts were despised as ''joiners'' but came to number a fifth of the fighting Afrikaners by the end of the War.{{sfn|Pakenham|1991|p=571}}

The British utilised armoured trains throughout the War to deliver rapid reaction forces much more quickly to incidents (such as Boer attacks on blockhouses and columns) or to drop them off ahead of retreating Boer columns.

=== Peace committees ===
Among those Burghers who had stopped fighting, it was decided to form peace committees to persuade those who were still fighting to desist. In December 1900 Lord Kitchener gave permission that a central Burgher Peace Committee be inaugurated in Pretoria. By the end of 1900 some thirty envoys were sent out to the various districts to form local peace committees to persuade burghers to give up the fight. Previous leaders of the Boers, like Generals Piet de Wet and Andries Cronjé were involved in the organisation. [[Meyer de Kock]] was the only emissary of a peace committee to be convicted of high treason and executed by firing squad.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=140}}

=== Joiners ===
Some burghers joined the British in their fight against the Boers. By the end of hostilities in May 1902, there were no fewer than 5,464 burghers working for the British.{{sfn|Ploeger1985|pp=15–22}}

=== Orange Free State ===
[[File:Christiaan de Wet.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Christiaan De Wet]] was the most formidable leader of the Boer guerrillas. He successfully evaded capture on numerous occasions and was later involved in the negotiations for a peace settlement.]]
After having conferred with the Transvaal leaders, [[Christiaan de Wet]] returned to the Orange Free State, where he inspired a series of successful attacks and raids from the hitherto quiet western part of the country, though he suffered a rare defeat at [[Battle of Bothaville|Bothaville]] in November 1900. Many Boers who had earlier returned to their farms, sometimes giving formal parole to the British, took up arms again. In late January 1901, De Wet led a renewed invasion of [[Cape Colony]]. This was less successful, because there was no general uprising among the Cape Boers, and De Wet's men were hampered by bad weather and relentlessly pursued by British forces. They narrowly escaped across the [[Orange River]].

From then until the final days of the war, De Wet remained comparatively quiet, partly because the Orange Free State was effectively left desolate by British sweeps. In late 1901, De Wet overran an isolated British detachment at [[Battle of Groenkop|Groenkop]], inflicting heavy casualties. This prompted Kitchener to launch the first of the &quot;New Model&quot; drives against him. De Wet escaped the first such drive, but lost 300 of his fighters. This was a severe loss, and a portent of further attrition, although the subsequent attempts to round up De Wet were badly handled, and De Wet's forces avoided capture.

=== Western Transvaal ===
The Boer commandos in the Western Transvaal were very active after September 1901. Several battles of importance were fought here between September 1901 and March 1902. At Moedwil on 30 September 1901 and again at Driefontein on 24 October, General [[Koos De La Rey]]'s forces attacked the British, but were forced to withdraw after the British offered strong resistance.

===Lifespan===

Little is known of the life histories of many jellyfish as the places on the seabed where the benthic forms of those species live have not been found. However, an asexually reproducing strobila form can sometimes live for several years, producing new medusae (ephyra larvae) each year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brusca 2016&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Brusca | first=Richard | title=Invertebrates | publisher=Sinauer Associates | year=2016 | isbn=978-1-60535-375-3 | page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unusual species, ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]'', formerly classified as ''[[Turritopsis nutricula]]'',&lt;ref name=mig&gt;{{cite journal |last=Miglietta |first=M.

So far this reversal has been observed only in the laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/1543022 | pmid=29227703 | last1=Piraino | first1=S. | last2=Boero | year=1996 | first2=F. | last3=Aeschbach | first3=B. | last4=Schmid | first4=V. | s2cid=3956265 | title=Reversing the life cycle: medusae transforming into polyps and cell transdifferentiation in ''Turritopsis nutricula'' (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa) | jstor=1543022| journal=Biological Bulletin | volume=190 | issue=3| pages=302–312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Locomotion===
[[File:Jellyfish locomotion.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Jellyfish [[animal locomotion|locomotion]] is highly efficient. [[Muscle]]s in the jellylike bell contract, setting up a start [[vortex]] and propelling the animal. When the contraction ends, the bell recoils elastically, creating a stop vortex with no extra energy input.]]

Using the moon jelly ''[[Aurelia aurita]]'' as an example, jellyfish have been shown to be the most energy efficient swimmers of all animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2014/05/jellyfish-are-the-most-energy-efficient-swimmers-new-metric-confirms/ |title=Jellyfish are the most energy-efficient swimmers, new metric confirms |author=Rathi, Akshat |website=Ars Technica |access-date=3 December 2014 |date=15 May 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103061826/http://arstechnica.com/science/2014/05/jellyfish-are-the-most-energy-efficient-swimmers-new-metric-confirms/|archive-date=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They move through the water by radially expanding and contracting their bell-shaped bodies to push water behind them. They pause between the contraction and expansion phases to create two [[vortex]] rings. Muscles are used for the contraction of the body, which creates the first vortex and pushes the animal forward, but the mesoglea is so elastic that the expansion is powered exclusively by relaxing the bell, which releases the energy stored from the contraction. Meanwhile, the second vortex ring starts to spin faster, sucking water into the bell and pushing against the centre of the body, giving a secondary and &quot;free&quot; boost forward. The mechanism, called passive energy recapture, only works in relatively small jellyfish moving at low speeds, allowing the animal to travel 30 percent farther on each swimming cycle. Jellyfish achieved a 48 percent lower cost of transport (food and oxygen intake versus energy spent in movement) than other animals in similar studies. One reason for this is that most of the gelatinous tissue of the bell is inactive, using no energy during swimming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/jellyfish-energy-efficiency-to-improve-bio-inspired-robotic-designs-for-navy |title=Jellyfish energy efficiency to improve bio-inspired robotic designs for Navy |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=110 |issue=44 |pages=17904–9 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1306983110 |pmid=24101461 |pmc=3816424 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022140928/http://www.kurzweilai.net/jellyfish-energy-efficiency-to-improve-bio-inspired-robotic-designs-for-navy |archive-date=22 October 2013 |bibcode=2013PNAS..11017904G |last1=Gemmell |first1=Brad J. |last2=Costello |first2=John H. |last3=Colin |first3=Sean P. |last4=Stewart |first4=Colin J. |last5=Dabiri |first5=John O. |last6=Tafti |first6=Danesh |last7=Priya |first7=Shashank |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gemmell | first1=B.

==Ecology==

===Diet===

Jellyfish are like other cnidarians generally carnivorous (or parasitic),&lt;ref name=&quot;Brusca296&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Brusca | first=Richard | title=Invertebrates | publisher=Sinauer Associates | year=2016 | isbn=978-1-60535-375-3 | page=296 |quote=All cnidarians are carnivores (or parasites). Typically, nematocyst-laden feeding tentacles capture animal prey and carry it to the mouth region where it is ingested whole.}}&lt;/ref&gt; feeding on planktonic organisms, crustaceans, small fish, fish eggs and larvae, and other jellyfish, ingesting food and voiding undigested waste through the mouth. They hunt passively using their tentacles as drift lines, or sink through the water with their tentacles spread widely; the tentacles, which contain nematocysts to stun or kill the [[Predation|prey]], may then flex to help bring it to the mouth.&lt;ref name=Ruppert/&gt; Their swimming technique also helps them to capture prey; when their bell expands it sucks in water which brings more potential prey within reach of the tentacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/44523885/ns/world_news-world_environment/t/bigger-jellyfish-are-inheriting-ocean-study-finds/#.U7MlOmeKCcw |title=Bigger jellyfish inheriting the ocean, study finds |website=msnbc.com |access-date=3 December 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714121949/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/44523885/ns/world_news-world_environment/t/bigger-jellyfish-are-inheriting-ocean-study-finds/#.U7MlOmeKCcw |archive-date=14 July 2014|date=2011-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few species such as ''[[Aglaura hemistoma]]'' are omnivorous, feeding on microplankton which is a mixture of [[zooplankton]] and [[phytoplankton]] (microscopic plants) such as [[dinoflagellate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Davies |first1=C.H. |last2=Slotwinski |first2=A.S. |title=Australian Marine Zooplankton-Jellyfish, Cladocerans |url=http://www.imas.utas.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/401264/AustralianZooplanktonGuide_JellyfishCladocerans.pdf |publisher=Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies, University of Tasmania |access-date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others harbour [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] algae ([[Zooxanthellae]]) in their tissues;&lt;ref name=Ruppert/&gt; the spotted jellyfish (''[[Mastigias papua]]'') is typical of these, deriving part of its nutrition from the products of [[photosynthesis]], and part from captured zooplankton.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawson2000&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Variegated mesocosms as alternatives to shore-based planktonkreisels: notes on the husbandry of jellyfish from marine lakes |journal=Journal of Plankton Research |first=Michael N. |last=Dawson |volume=22 |issue=9 |pages=1673–1682 |year=2000 |doi=10.1093/plankt/22.9.1673|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawson2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iQSTgX1UkdUC&amp;pg=PA131 |title=Jellyfish swarms, tourists, and the Christ-child |journal=[[Hydrobiologia]] |publisher=Springer |first1=Mike N. |last1=Dawson |first2=Laura E. |last2=Martin |last3=Lolita K |first3=Lolita K. |last4=Penland |volume=451 |pages=131–144 |date=May 2001 |isbn=978-0-7923-6964-6 |doi=10.1023/A:1011868925383|s2cid=1679552 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other species of jellyfish are among the most common and important jellyfish predators. Sea anemones may eat jellyfish that drift into their range. Other predators include [[tuna]]s, sharks, [[swordfish]], sea turtles and penguins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Yin | first=Steph | date=September 29, 2017 | title=Who's Eating Jellyfish?

===Habitats===
[[File:Common jellyfish swimming close to shore.jpg|thumb|upright|A common Scyphozoan jellyfish seen near beaches in the Florida Panhandle]]

Most jellyfish are marine animals, although a few hydromedusae inhabit [[freshwater]].  The best known freshwater example is the [[Cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] hydrozoan jellyfish, ''[[Craspedacusta sowerbii]]''. It is less than an inch (2.5&amp;nbsp;cm) in diameter, colorless and does not sting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nobanis.org/files/factsheets/Craspedacusta_sowerbyi.pdf |title=Invasive Alien Species Fact Sheet: ''Craspedacusta sowerbyi'' |last=Didžiulis |first=Viktoras |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517210230/http://www.nobanis.org/files/factsheets/Craspedacusta_sowerbyi.pdf |publisher=NOBANIS |archive-date=17 May 2014 |url-status=live |access-date=16 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some jellyfish populations have become restricted to coastal saltwater lakes, such as [[Jellyfish Lake]] in [[Palau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iQSTgX1UkdUC&amp;pg=PA131 |title=Jellyfish swarms, tourists, and the Christ-child |journal=[[Hydrobiologia]] |first1=Mike N. |last1=Dawson |first2=Laura E. |last2=Martin |first3=Lolita K. |last3=Penland |volume=451 |pages=131–144 |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-7923-6964-6 |doi=10.1023/A:1011868925383|s2cid=1679552 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jellyfish Lake is a [[marine lake]] where millions of golden jellyfish (''Mastigias'' spp.) migrate horizontally across the lake daily.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawson2001&quot;/&gt;

Although most jellyfish live well off the ocean floor and form part of the plankton, a few species are closely associated with the bottom for much of their lives and can be considered [[benthic]]. The upside-down jellyfish in the genus ''[[Cassiopea]]'' typically lie on the bottom of shallow lagoons where they sometimes pulsate gently with their umbrella top facing down. Even some deep-sea species of hydromedusae and scyphomedusae are usually collected on or near the bottom. All of the [[stauromedusae]] are found attached to either seaweed or rocky or other firm material on the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mills |first=C. E. |author2=Hirano, Y. M. |title=Stauromedusae |journal=Encyclopedia of Tidepools and Rocky Shores |year=2007 |pages=541–543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some species explicitly adapt to [[tide|tidal]] flux. In [[Roscoe Bay Provincial Park|Roscoe Bay]], jellyfish ride the current at ebb tide until they hit a [[gravel bar]], and then descend below the current. They remain in still waters until the tide rises, ascending and allowing it to sweep them back into the bay. They also actively avoid fresh water from mountain snowmelt, diving until they find enough salt.&lt;ref name=angier2dec/&gt;

===Parasites===

Jellyfish are [[host (biology)|hosts]] to a wide variety of parasitic organisms. They act as intermediate hosts of endoparasitic [[helminth]]s, with the infection being transferred to the definitive host fish after [[predation]]. Some [[digenea]]n [[trematode]]s, especially species in the family [[Lepocreadiidae]], use jellyfish as their second intermediate hosts. Fish become infected by the trematodes when they feed on infected jellyfish.&lt;ref name=&quot;KondoOhtsuka2016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kondo |first1=Yusuke |last2=Ohtsuka |first2=Susumu |last3=Hirabayashi |first3=Takeshi |last4=Okada |first4=Shoma |last5=Ogawa |first5=Nanako O. |last6=Ohkouchi |first6=Naohiko |last7=Shimazu |first7=Takeshi |last8=Nishikawa |first8=Jun |title=Seasonal changes in infection with trematode species utilizing jellyfish as hosts: evidence of transmission to definitive host fish via medusivory |journal=Parasite |volume=23 |year=2016 |page=16 |doi=10.1051/parasite/2016016 |url=http://www.parasite-journal.org/articles/parasite/full_html/2016/01/parasite150043/parasite150043.html |pmid=27055563 |pmc=4824873 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171104045257/https://www.parasite-journal.org/articles/parasite/full_html/2016/01/parasite150043/parasite150043.html|archive-date=4 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Leung, Tommy |url=http://dailyparasite.blogspot.fr/2016/05/opechona-olssoni.html |title=''Opechona olssoni'' |publisher=Blog: Parasite of the Day |date=26 May 2016|access-date=1 June 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630161725/http://dailyparasite.blogspot.fr/2016/05/opechona-olssoni.html |archive-date=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fisheries===
Jellyfish have long been eaten in some parts of the world.&lt;ref name=asfood/&gt; Fisheries have begun harvesting the American cannonball jellyfish, ''[[Stomolophus meleagris]]'', along the southern Atlantic coast of the United States and in the Gulf of Mexico for export to Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hydrobiologia&quot;/&gt;

Jellyfish are also harvested for their [[collagen]], which is being investigated for use in a variety of applications including the treatment of [[rheumatoid arthritis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://endocrinenews.endocrine.org/jellies-in-the-spotlight/ |title=Jellies in the Spotlight |author=George, Aleta |date=1 November 2012 |website=Endocrine News |publisher=Endocrine Society|access-date=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, including China, Japan, and Korea, jellyfish are a delicacy. The jellyfish is dried to prevent spoiling.
Only some 12 species of scyphozoan jellyfish belonging to the order [[Rhizostomeae]] are harvested for food, mostly in southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Omori | first1=M. | last2=Nakano | first2=E. | year=2001 | title=Jellyfish fisheries in southeast Asia | journal=Hydrobiologia | volume=451 | pages=19–26 | doi=10.1023/A:1011879821323| s2cid=6518460 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhizostomes, especially ''[[Rhopilema]] esculentum'' in China ({{lang|zh|海蜇}} ''hǎizhé'', 'sea stingers') and ''Stomolophus meleagris'' (cannonball jellyfish) in the United States, are favored because of their larger and more rigid bodies and because their toxins are harmless to humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hydrobiologia&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Hsieh, Y-H.

Traditional processing methods, carried out by a jellyfish master, involve a 20- to 40-day multi-phase procedure in which, after removing the gonads and [[mucous membrane]]s, the umbrella and oral arms are treated with a mixture of [[table salt]] and [[alum]], and compressed. Processing makes the jellyfish drier and more acidic, producing a crisp texture. Jellyfish prepared this way retain 7–10% of their original weight, and the processed product consists of approximately 94% water and 6% protein. Freshly processed jellyfish has a white, creamy color and turns yellow or brown during prolonged storage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hydrobiologia&quot;/&gt;

In China, processed jellyfish are desalted by soaking in water overnight and eaten cooked or raw. The dish is often served shredded with a dressing of oil, soy sauce, vinegar and sugar, or as a salad with vegetables. In Japan, cured jellyfish are rinsed, cut into strips and served with vinegar as an appetizer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hydrobiologia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Marine Resources |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofma0000firt |url-access=registration |last=Firth |first=F.

In 1961, [[Osamu Shimomura]] extracted [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) and another bioluminescent protein, called [[aequorin]], from the large and abundant hydromedusa ''[[Aequorea victoria]]'', while studying [[photoprotein]]s that cause [[bioluminescence]] in this species.&lt;ref name=Shimomura_1962/&gt; Three decades later, [[Douglas Prasher]] sequenced and cloned the gene for GFP.&lt;ref name=Prasher_1992&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Prasher, D.

Man-made GFP became widely used as a [[fluorescent tag]] to show which cells or tissues express specific genes. The [[genetic engineering]] technique fuses the [[gene]] of interest to the GFP gene. The fused [[DNA]] is then put into a cell, to generate either a cell line or (via [[IVF]] techniques) an entire animal bearing the gene. In the cell or animal, the [[artificial gene]] turns on in the same tissues and the same time as the normal gene, making GFP instead of the normal protein. Illuminating the animal or cell reveals what tissues express that protein—or at what stage of development. The fluorescence shows where the gene is expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author1=Pieribone, V. | author2=Gruber, D.

===Aquarium display===
[[File:Jellyfish aqurium.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pacific sea nettle]]s (''Chrysaora fuscescens'') in an aquarium exhibit|alt=Photo of downward-swimming jellies]]

Jellyfish are displayed in many [[public aquarium]]s. Often the tank's background is blue and the animals are illuminated by side light, increasing the contrast between the animal and the background. In natural conditions, many jellies are so transparent that they are nearly invisible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Herring |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Herring |year=2002 |title=The Biology of the Deep Ocean Oxford University Press |url=https://archive.org/details/biologydeepocean00herr |url-access=limited |isbn=978-0-19-854956-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/biologydeepocean00herr/page/n199 190]–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jellyfish are not adapted to closed spaces.

===Stings===
[[File:Irukandji-jellyfish-queensland-australia.jpg|thumb|[[Box jellyfish]] are small and venomous.]]

Jellyfish are armed with nematocysts. Contact with a jellyfish tentacle can trigger millions of nematocysts to pierce the skin and inject [[venom]],&lt;ref&gt;Purves, W.K.; Sadava, D.; Orians, G.H.; Heller, H.C. 1998. Life. The Science of Biology. Part 4: The Evolution of Diversity. Chapter 31&lt;/ref&gt; but only some species' venom causes an adverse reaction in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jellyfishart.com/kb_results.asp?ID=11 |title=Jellyfish Tanks and live pet Jellyfish for sale at Jellyfish Art – Buy Jellyfish and Jellyfish tanks |website=jellyfishart.com |access-date=3 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302090841/http://www.jellyfishart.com/kb_results.asp?ID=11 |archive-date=2 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a study published in [[Communications Biology]], researchers found a jellyfish species called ''[[Cassiopea xamachana]]'' which when triggered will release tiny balls of cells that swim around the jellyfish stinging everything in their path. Researchers described these as &quot;self-propelling microscopic grenades&quot; and named them cassiosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Giaimo|first=Cara|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/science/jellyfish-stingers-floating.html|title=You Didn't Touch These Jellyfish, but They Can Sting You With Tiny Grenades|date=2020-02-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-02-27|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stings may cause [[anaphylaxis]] (a form of shock), which can be fatal. Jellyfish kill 20 to 40 people a year in the Philippines alone. In 2006 the Spanish Red Cross treated 19,000 stung swimmers along the [[Costa Brava]].&lt;ref name=&quot;smith&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams2016&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ourbeautifulplanet.org/nature/box-jellyfish-deadly/ |author=Adams, Julie |title=Box Jellyfish: Why are they so deadly? |date=13 August 2016 |access-date=17 September 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910014412/http://www.ourbeautifulplanet.org/nature/box-jellyfish-deadly/ |publisher=Our Beautiful Planet |archive-date=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

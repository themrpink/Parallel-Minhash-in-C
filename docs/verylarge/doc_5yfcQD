As a busy town frequented by travellers, it appears to have become important for preachers such as [[Gautama Buddha]] and [[Mahavira]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=13}} The ''Samyutta Nikaya'' and ''[[Anguttara Nikaya]]'' mention that Buddha resided at Saketa at times.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=5}} The early Jain canonical texts (such as ''Antagada-dasao'', ''Anuttarovavaiya-dasao'', and ''Vivagasuya'') state that Mahavira visited Saketa; ''Nayadhammakahao'' states that [[Parshvanatha]] also visited Saketa.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=6}} The Jain texts, both canonical and post-canonical, describe Ayodhya as the location of various shrines, such as those of snake, [[yaksha]] Pasamiya, Muni Suvratasvamin, and Surappia.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=6}}

It is not clear what happened to Saketa after Kosala was conquered by the [[Magadha]] emperor [[Ajatashatru]] around 5th century BC. There is lack of historical sources about the city's situation for the next few centuries: it is possible that the city remained a commercial centre of secondary importance, but did not grow into a political centre of Magadha, whose capital was located at [[Pataliputra]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=14}} Several Buddhist buildings may have been constructed in the town during the rule of the [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]] emperor [[Ashoka]] in the 3rd century BC: these buildings were probably located on the present-day man-made mounds in Ayodhya.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|pp=14–18}} Excavations at Ayodhya have resulted in the discovery of a large brick wall, identified as a fortification wall by archaeologist [[B. B. Lal]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=2}} This wall probably erected in the last quarter of the 3rd-century BC.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|pp=19–20}}

After the decline of the Maurya empire, Saketa appears to have come under the rule of [[Pushyamitra Shunga]]. The 1st century BC [[Ayodhya Inscription of Dhana|inscription of Dhanadeva]] suggests that he appointed a governor there.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=20}} The ''[[Yuga Purana]]'' mentions Saketa as the residence of a governor, and describes it as being attacked by a combined force of [[Yavanas|Greeks]], [[Mathura]]s, and [[Panchala]]s.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|pp=18–19}} Patanjali's commentary on Panini also refers to the Greek siege of Saketa.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=7,19}}

Later, Saketa appears to have become part of a small, independent kingdom.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=18}} The ''Yuga Purana'' states that Saketa was ruled by seven powerful kings after the retreat of the Greeks.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=20}} The ''Vayu Purana'' and the ''Brahmanda Purana'' also state that seven powerful kings ruled in the capital of Kosala. The historicity of these kings is attested by the discovery of the coins of the [[Deva dynasty (Saketa)|Deva dynasty]] kings, including Dhanadeva, whose inscription describes him as the king of Kosala (''Kosaladhipati'').{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=21}} As the capital of Kosala, Saketa probably eclipsed Shravasti in importance during this period. The east–west route connecting Pataliputra to [[Taxila]], which earlier passed through Saketa and Shravasti, appears to have shifted southwards during this period, now passing through Saketa, [[Ahichhatra]] and [[Kanyakubja]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=22}}

After the Deva kings, Saketa appears to have been ruled by the [[Datta dynasty|Datta]], [[Kushan Empire|Kushan]], and Mitra kings, although the chronological order of their rule is uncertain. Bakker theorises that the [[Datta dynasty|Dattas]] succeeded the Deva kings in the mid-1st century AD, and their kingdom was annexed to the Kushan Empire by [[Kanishka]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=24}} The Tibetan text ''Annals of Li Country'' (c. 11th century) mentions that an alliance of king Vijayakirti of [[Khotan]], king Kanika, the king of Gu-zan, and the king of Li, marched to India and captured the So-ked city. During this invasion, Vijayakirti took several Buddhist relics from Saketa, and placed them in the stupa of Phru-no. If Kanika is identified as Kanishka, and So-ked as Saketa, it appears that the invasion of Kushans and their allies led to the destruction of the Buddhist sites at Saketa.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=25}}

Nevertheless, Saketa appears to have remained a prosperous town during the Kushan rule.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=25}} The 2nd century geographer [[Ptolemy]] mentions a metropolis &quot;Sageda&quot; or &quot;Sagoda&quot;, which has been identified with Saketa.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=18}} The earliest inscription that mentions Saketa as a place name is dated to the late Kushan period: it was found on the pedestal of a Buddha image in Shravasti, and records the gift of the image by Sihadeva of Saketa.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=24}} Before or after the Kushans, Saketa appears to have been ruled by a dynasty of kings whose names end in &quot;-mitra&quot;, and whose coins have been found at Ayodhya. They may have been members of a local dynasty that was distinct from the [[Mitra dynasty (Mathura)|Mitra dynasty]] of Mathura. These kings are attested only by their coinage: Sangha-mitra, Vijaya-mitra, Satya-mitra, Deva-mitra, and Arya-mitra; coins of Kumuda-sena and Aja-varman have also been discovered.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=23}}

=== Gupta period ===

Around the 4th century, the region came under the control of the [[Gupta Empire|Guptas]], who revived [[Brahmanism]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=26}} The ''[[Vayu Purana]]'' and the ''[[Brahmanda Purana]]'' attest that the early Gupta kings ruled Saketa.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=7}} No Gupta-era archaeological layers have been discovered in present-day Ayodhya, although a large number of Gupta coins have been discovered here. It is possible that during the Gupta period, the habitations in the city were located in the areas that have not yet been excavated.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=27}} The Buddhist sites that had suffered destruction during the Khotanese-Kushan invasion appear to have remained deserted.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|pp=25–26}} The 5th-century Chinese traveller [[Faxian]] states that the ruins of Buddhist buildings existed at &quot;Sha-chi&quot; during his time.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=17}} One theory identifies Sha-chi with Saketa, although this identification is not undisputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=J. C. Aggarwal |author2=N. K. Chowdhry |title=Ram Janmabhoomi through the ages: Babri Masjid controversy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V3JuAAAAMAAJ |year=1991 |publisher=S. Chand |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Sha-chi is indeed Saketa, it appears that by the 5th century, the town no longer had a flourshing Buddhist community or any important Buddhist building that was still in use.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=18}}

An important development during the Gupta time was the recognition of Saketa as the [[Ayodhya (legendary city)|legendary city of Ayodhya]], the capital of the [[Ikshvaku dynasty]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=26}} The 436 AD Karamdanda (Karmdand) inscription, issued during the reign of [[Kumaragupta I]], names Ayodhya as the capital of the Kosala province, and records commander Prithvisena's offerings to Brahmins from Ayodhya.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=28}} Later, the capital of the [[Gupta Empire]] was moved from Pataliputra to Ayodhya. [[Paramartha]] states that king Vikramaditya moved the royal court to Ayodhya; Xuanzang also corroborates this, stating that this king moved the court to the &quot;country of Shravasti&quot;, that is, Kosala.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=29}} A local oral tradition of Ayodhya, first recorded in writing by [[Robert Montgomery Martin]] in 1838,{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=30}} mentions that the city was deserted after the death of Rama's descendant [[Brihadbala]]. The city remain deserted until King Vikrama of [[Ujjain]] came searching for it, and re-established it. He cut down the forests that had covered the ancient ruins, erected the Ramgar fort, and built 360 temples.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=30}}

Vikramditya was a title of multiple Gupta kings, and the king who moved the capital to Ayodhya is identified as Skandagupta.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=29}} Bakker theorises that the move to Ayodhya may have been prompted by a flooding of the river Ganges at Pataliputra, the need to check the [[Huna people|Huna]] advance from the west, and Skandagupta's desire to compare himself with Rama (whose Ikshvaku dynasty is associated with the legendary Ayodhya).{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=30}} According to Paramaratha's ''Life of Vasubandhu'', Vikramaditya was a patron of scholars, and awarded 300,000 pieces of gold to [[Vasubandhu]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=31}} The text states that Vasubandhu was a native of Saketa (&quot;Sha-ki-ta&quot;), and describes Vikramaditya as the king of Ayodhya (&quot;A-yu-ja&quot;).{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=8}} This wealth was used to build three monasteries in the country of A-yu-ja (Ayodhya).{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=31}} Paramartha further states that the later king Baladitya (identified with [[Narasimhagupta]]) and his mother also awarded large sums of gold to Vasubandhu, and these funds were used to build another Buddhist temple at Ayodhya.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=32}} These structures may have been seen by the 7th century Chinese traveller [[Xuanzang]], who describes a [[stupa]] and a [[monastery]] at Ayodhya (&quot;O-yu-t-o&quot;).{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=18, 31}}

=== Decline as a political centre ===

Ayodhya probably suffered when the Hunas led by [[Mihirakula]] invaded the Gupta empire in the 6th century. After the fall of the Guptas, it may have been ruled by the [[Maukhari]] dynasty, whose coins have been found in the nearby areas. It was not devastated, as Xuanzang describes it as a flourshing town and a Buddhist centre.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|pp=32–33}} However, it had lost its position as an important political centre to [[Kanyakubja]] (Kannauj).{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|pp=33–34}} At the time of Xuanzang's visit, it was a part of [[Harsha]]'s empire, and was probably the seat of a vassal or an administrative officer. Xuanzang states that the city measured about 0.6&amp;nbsp;km (20 [[li (unit)|li]]) in circumference. Another 7th-century source, ''[[Kāśikāvṛttī]]'', mentions that the town was surrounded by a moat similar to that around [[Pataliputra]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=33}}

After the fall of Harsha's empire, Ayodhya appears to have been variously controlled by local kings and the rulers of Kannauj, including [[Yashovarman]] and the [[Gurjara-Pratihara]]s. The town is not mentioned in any surviving texts or inscriptions composed during 650–1050 AD, although it may be identified with the &quot;city of [[Harishchandra]]&quot; mentioned in the 8th-century poem ''Gaudavaho''. Archaeological evidence (including images to [[Vishnu]], Jain [[tirthankara]]s, [[Ganesha]], the seven [[Matrikas]], and a Buddhist stupa) suggests that the religious activity in the area continued during this period.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=34}}

=== Early medieval period ===

According to Indologist [[Hans T. Bakker]], the only religious significance of Ayodhya in the first millennium AD was related to the ''Gopratara'' [[tirtha (Hinduism)|tirtha]] (now called Guptar Ghat), where Rama and his followers are said to have ascended to heaven by entering the waters of Sarayu.{{sfn|Bakker, The rise of Ayodhya as a place of pilgrimage|1982|p=105}}&lt;ref name=Paramasivan /&gt;{{sfn|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|p=12}}

In the 11th century, the [[Gahadavala]] dynasty came to power in the region, and promoted [[Vaishnavism]]. They built several [[Vishnu]] temples in Ayodhya, five of which survived till the end of [[Aurangzeb]]'s reign. Hans Bakker concludes that there might have been a temple at the supposed birth spot of Rama built by the Gahadavalas (see [[Vishnu Hari inscription]]). In subsequent years, the cult of Rama developed within Vaishnavism, with Rama being regarded as the foremost avatar of Vishnu. Consequently, Ayodhya's importance as a pilgrimage centre grew.&lt;ref name=Paramasivan&gt;{{cite book |last=Paramasivan |first=Vasudha |chapter=Yah Ayodhya Vah Ayodhya: Earthly and Cosmic Journeys in the Anand-lahari |editor=Heidi R.

In 1226 AD, Ayodhya became the capital of the province of [[Awadh]] (or &quot;Oudh&quot;) within the [[Delhi sultanate]]. Muslim historians state that the area was little more than wilderness prior to this. Pilgrimage was tolerated, but the tax on pilgrims ensured that the temples did not receive much income.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya: A Hindu Jerusalem|1991}}

=== Mughal and British period ===

Under [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rule, the [[Babri mosque]] was constructed in Ayodhya. The city was the capital of the province of [[Awadh]] (later Anglicised to &quot;Oudh&quot;), which is also believed to be a variant of the name &quot;Ayodhya.&quot;{{according to whom|date=August 2020}}

After the death of Aurangzeb in 1707 AD, the central Muslim rule weakened, and Awadh became virtually independent, with Ayodhya as its capital. However, the rulers became increasingly dependent on the local Hindu nobles, and control over the temples and pilgrimage centres was relaxed.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya: A Hindu Jerusalem|1991}}{{better source|date=August 2020}} [[Saadat Ali Khan II|Saadat Ali Khan]], [[Nawab of Awadh]], bestowed the ''riyasat'' (principality) of Ayodhya on his loyal [[Brahmin]] soldier [[Dwijdeo Mishra]] of the [[Kasyapa]] [[gotra]], for quelling revenue rebels in Mehendauna in [[Poorvanchal|Eastern UP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FE20040822&quot;&gt;[http://www.financialexpress.com/news/plaint-of-ayodhya/113041/ Plaint Of Ayodhya], [[The Financial Express (India)|The Financial Express]], Sunday, 22 August 2004 at 0000 hrs IST&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:United Provinces 1903.gif|thumb|left|[[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh]], showing 'Ajodhia', 1903 map]]

Ayodhya was annexed in 1856 by the British rulers. The rulers of Awadh were [[Shia]], and the [[Sunni]] groups had already protested against the permissive attitude of the former government. The British intervened and crushed the Sunni resistance. In 1857, the British annexed Oudh (Awadh) and subsequently reorganised it into the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya: A Hindu Jerusalem|1991}}

In the 1850s, a group of Hindus attacked the Babri mosque, on the grounds that it was built over [[Ram Janmabhoomi|the birthplace]] of the Hindu deity [[Rama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Christophe Jaffrelot |title=The Hindu Nationalist Movement and Indian Politics: 1925 to the 1990s : Strategies of Identity-building, Implantation and Mobilisation (with Special Reference to Central India) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iVsfVOTUnYEC&amp;pg=PA92 |year=1999 |publisher=Penguin Books India |isbn=978-0-14-024602-5 |page=92 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent further disputes, the British administrators divided the mosque premises between Hindus and Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;P.

Ayodhya is an important place of pilgrimage for the Hindus. A verse in the ''[[Brahmanda Purana]]'' names Ayodhya among &quot;the most sacred and foremost cities&quot;, the others being [[Mathura]], [[Haridwar|Haridvara]], [[Varanasi|Kashi]], [[Kanchipuram|Kanchi]] and [[Ujjain|Avantika]]. This verse is also found in the other [[Purana]]s with slight variations.{{sfn|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|p=2}} In [[Garuda Purana]], Ayodhya is said to be one of seven holiest places for [[Hindus]] in India, with [[Varanasi]] being the most sacrosanct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NNcXrBlI9S0C&amp;pg=PA3|title=The Hindu temple, Volume 1 |author1=Stella Kramrisch |author2=Raymond Burnier |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |page=3 |isbn=9788120802230|year=1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hanuman Garhi Fort ===
[[Hanumangarhi|Hanuman Garhi]], a massive four-sided fort with circular bastions at each corner and a temple of Hanuman inside, is the most popular shrine in Ayodhya. Situated in the center of town, it is approachable by a flight of 76 steps. Its legend is that Hanuman lived here in a cave and guarded the Janambhoomi, or Ramkot. The main temple contains the statue of Maa Anjani with Bal Hanuman seated on her lap. The faithful believe wishes are granted with a visit to the shrine. Kanak Bhawan is a temple said to have been given to [[Sita]] and Rama by Rama's stepmother [[Kaikeyi]] as a wedding gift, and only contains statues of Sita with her husband.

=== Ramkot ===
Ramkot is the main place of worship in Ayodhya, and the site of the ancient citadel of its namesake, standing on elevated ground in the western city. Although visited by pilgrims throughout the year, it attracts devotees from all over the world on &quot;[[Ram Navami]]&quot;, the day of the birth of Rama. Ram Navami is celebrated with great pomp in the Hindu month of [[Chaitra]], which falls between March and April. Swarg Dwar is believed to be the site of cremation of Rama. Mani Parbat and Sugriv Parbat are ancient earth mounds, the first identified by a stupa built by the emperor [[Ashoka]], and the second is an ancient monastery. Treta ke Thakur is a temple standing at the site of the [[Ashwamedha|Ashvamedha Yajnya]] of Rama. Three centuries prior, the Raja of Kulu built a new temple here, which was improved by [[Ahilyabai Holkar]] of Indore in 1784, the same time the adjacent Ghats were built. The initial idols in black sandstone were recovered from Sarayu and placed in the new temple, which was known as Kaleram-ka-Mandir. Chhoti Devkali Mandir is the temple of goddess Ishani, or Durga, Kuldevi of Sita.

=== Nageshwarnath Temple ===
The temple of Nageshwarnath was established by [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kush]], son of Rama. Legend has it that Kush lost his armlet while bathing in the [[Sarayu]], and it was retrieved by a Nag-Kanya who fell in love with him. As she was a devotee of Shiva, Kush built her this temple. It was the only temple to survive when Ayodhya was abandoned until the time of [[Vikramaditya]]. While the rest of city was in ruin and covered by dense forest, this temple allowed Vikramaditya to recognise the city. The festival of [[Shivratri]] is celebrated here with great splendor.

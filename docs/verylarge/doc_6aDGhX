==Abdication==
In retaliation for Scotland's treaty with France, Edward I invaded, commencing the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]]. The Scots were defeated at [[Battle of Dunbar (1296)|Dunbar]] and the English took [[Dunbar Castle]] on 27 April 1296.&lt;ref name=dunbar116/&gt; John abdicated at [[Stracathro]] near [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]] on 10 July 1296.&lt;ref name=dunbar116/&gt; Here the arms of Scotland were formally torn from John's surcoat, giving him the abiding name of &quot;Toom Tabard&quot; (empty coat).&lt;ref name=trans&gt;This translation is disputed.{{cn|date=November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] until allowed to go to France in July 1299. When his baggage was examined at [[Dover]], the Royal Golden Crown and Seal of the Kingdom of Scotland, with many vessels of gold and silver, and a considerable sum of money, were found in his chests. Edward I ordered that the Crown be offered to the shrine of [[St Thomas Becket]] at Canterbury, and that the money be returned to John for the expenses of his journey. But he kept the Seal himself.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Foedera]]'', vol.1, part 2, p.909&lt;/ref&gt; John was released into the custody of [[Pope Boniface VIII]] on condition that he remain at a papal residence. He was released around the summer of 1301 and lived the rest of his life on his family's ancestral estates at [[Tilloy-Floriville|Hélicourt]], Picardy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sEV4zgXOJLsC&amp;q=scotland+king+balliol&amp;pg=PA117|title=Scotland: The Story of a Nation|last=Magnusson|first=Magnus|date=2003|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=9780802139320|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next few years, there were several Scottish rebellions against Edward (for example, in 1297 under [[William Wallace]] and [[Andrew Moray]]).  The rebels would invoke the name of &quot;King John&quot;, on the grounds that his abdication had been under duress and therefore invalid.{{cn|date=November 2020}} This claim came to look increasingly tenuous, as John's position under nominal house-arrest meant that he could not return to Scotland nor campaign for his release, despite the Scots' diplomatic attempts in Paris and Rome. After 1302, he made no further attempts to extend his personal support to the Scots.{{cn|date=November 2020}} Effectively, Scotland was left without a monarch until the accession of Robert the Bruce in 1306.

==Death==
John died in late 1314 at his family's [[Château de Hélicourt|château at Hélicourt]] in France.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; On 4 January 1315, King [[Edward II of England]], writing to King [[Louis X of France]], said that he had heard of the death of 'Sir John de Balliol'&lt;ref name=dunbar117&gt;Dunbar, Sir Archibald H.,Bt., ''Scottish Kings – A Revised Chronology of Scottish History 1005–1625'', Edinburgh, 1899: p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; and requested the fealty and homage of Edward Balliol to be given by proxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

A John de Bailleul is interred in the church of St Waast at [[Bailleul-Neuville|Bailleul-sur-Eaune]] in Normandy.&lt;ref name=dunbar117/&gt; This may or may not be the Scottish king.

John was survived by his son [[Edward Balliol]], who later revived his family's claim to the Scottish throne, received support from the English, and had some temporary successes.

==Marriage and children==
[[Image:SetonArmorialJohnBalliolAndWife.jpg|thumb|John Balliol and his wife]]
John married around 9 February 1281 to [[Isabella de Warenne]], daughter of [[John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey]].&lt;ref name=dunbar115/&gt; Her mother, [[Alice de Lusignan, Countess of Surrey|Alice de Lusignan]], was niece of [[Henry III of England]].  John was also the brother-in-law to [[John Comyn III of Badenoch|John Comyn]], who was killed following a scuffle with Robert the Bruce in February 1306, in the chapel of the [[Greyfriars, Dumfries]]. Opinion remains divided on who started the fight and who exactly killed Comyn.

It has been established that John and Isabella had at least one child:

* [[Edward Balliol]], [[Pretender|Scottish pretender]], (d.1367). Possibly married to Marguerite de Taranto, daughter of [[Philip I, Prince of Taranto]] (d. 1332) – annulled or divorced with no children.&lt;ref name=dunbar115/&gt;

However, other children have been linked to the couple as other possible issue:
* Henry de Balliol. He was killed in the [[Battle of Annan]] on 16 December 1332, leaving no children.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, Sir Archibald H.,Bt., ''Scottish Kings – A Revised Chronology of Scottish History 1005–1625'', Edinburgh, 1899: p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;
* Agnes (or Maud or Anne) Balliol was married to [[Bryan FitzAlan, Lord FitzAlan]], and feudal Baron of [[Bedale]]. They were parents to Agnes FitzAlan (b. 1298), who married Sir Gilbert Stapleton, Knt., of Bedale (1291–1324). Gilbert is better known for his participation in the assassination of [[Piers Gaveston]], [[Earl of Cornwall]].
* Margaret Balliol. Married Sir John St Clere, Knight, of East Grinsted, Sussex, and left children, a daughter, Margaret, who married Sir William Wallis (or Waleys) of Glynde Place, Sussex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5kJbAAAAQAAJ&amp;q=%22Margt.+d.+of+John+Bayloll%22&amp;pg=PP11 |title = Visitation of Sussex, 1570}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional portrayals==
John Balliol has been depicted in drama:

*''[[John Balliol (play)|John Balliol, An Historical Drama]]. In Five Acts'' (1825), play based on his life by [[William Tennant]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electricscotland.com/history/men/tennant_william.htm William Tennant in ''&quot;Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen&quot;'' by William Chambers]&lt;/ref&gt;
*A character named Balliol, portrayed by British actor [[Bernard Horsfall]], appears in [[Mel Gibson]]'s 1995 Oscar-winning epic ''[[Braveheart]]'', an heroic tale of Scottish national hero [[William Wallace]]. The character is merely presented as a claimant to the Scottish crown, with no further delving into his significance. He is presumably loosely based on John Balliol,{{cn|date=November 2020}} although in reality he was a prisoner in France at that time.

An '''independence day''' is an annual event commemorating the [[anniversary]] of a [[nation]]'s independence or [[Sovereign state|statehood]], usually after ceasing to be a group or part of another nation or state, or more rarely after the end of a [[military occupation]]. Many countries commemorate their independence from a [[colonial empire]]. American political commentator [[Walter Russell Mead]] notes that, &quot;World-wide, British Leaving Day is never out of season.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Walter Russell Mead, &quot;The Sun Ever Sets on the British Empire: Like the U.S., nations from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe celebrate ‘British Leaving Day.’&quot; [https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-sun-ever-sets-on-the-british-empire-11594076187 ''Wall Street Journal''] July 6, 2020].&lt;/ref&gt;

== List ==
The following list includes current [[United Nations General Assembly observers|observer]] and [[member states of the United Nations]] that have [[public holiday]]s dedicated to the establishment of the country's independence or sovereignty from a foreign power. The list does not include days commemorating regime changes (e.g. various [[Revolution Day]]s or [[Republic Day]]s), days commemorating its liberation from an occupying military power ([[Liberation Day]]s or [[Victory Day]]s), or other [[National Day]]s not tied to the establishment of independence.

|Portugal was officially an autonomous state, but the country was in a personal union with the Spanish crown from 1580 to 1640 – date of the restoration of full Portuguese autonomy from [[Iberian Union]] with Spain.&lt;ref&gt;The country's original independence (from the [[Kingdom of León]]) occurred on June 24, 1128 ([[Battle of São Mamede]]) and was recognized on October 5, 1143. That day is a holiday in Portugal, but for a different reason. (Implantation of the Republic, or Republic Day. [[5 October 1910 revolution|Event of 1910]].) Note that none of these events is similar to today's declarations or recognition of independence as these are in fact the recognition of the rule of a king to the land. Portugal existed as a separate entity before 1143 and during the union with Spain between 1580 and 1640.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[number theory]], a '''Liouville number''' is a [[real number]] ''x'' with the property that, for every positive [[integer]] ''n'', there exist infinitely many pairs of integers (''p, q'') with ''q'' &gt; 1 such that

:&lt;math&gt;0&lt;  \left |x- \frac{p}{q} \right| &lt; \frac{1}{q^{n}}. &lt;/math&gt;

Liouville numbers are &quot;almost rational&quot;, and can thus be approximated &quot;quite closely&quot; by [[sequence]]s of rational numbers. They are precisely the [[transcendental number|transcendental]] numbers that can be more closely approximated by rational numbers than any algebraic irrational number. In 1844, [[Joseph Liouville]] showed that all Liouville numbers are transcendental, thus establishing the existence of transcendental numbers for the first time.

== The existence of Liouville numbers (Liouville's constant) ==
Here we show that Liouville numbers exist by exhibiting a construction that produces such numbers.

For any integer ''b'' ≥ 2, and any sequence of integers (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&amp;hellip;,&amp;nbsp;), such that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;{0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;&amp;hellip;,&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1} for all ''k''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;{1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;&amp;hellip;} and there are infinitely many k with ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ 0, define the number

:&lt;math&gt;x = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{a_k}{b^{k!}}&lt;/math&gt;

In the special case when ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10, and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, for all ''k'', the resulting number ''x'' is called '''Liouville's constant:'''

:''L'' = 0.'''11'''000'''1'''00000000000000000'''1'''0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'''1'''...

It follows from the definition of ''x'' that its base-''b'' representation is

:&lt;math&gt;x = \left(0.a_{1}a_{2}000a_{3}00000000000000000a_{4}0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a_{5}\ldots\right)_b\;&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''n''th term is in the (''n''!)th decimal place.

Since this base-''b'' representation is non-repeating it follows that ''x'' cannot be rational.  Therefore, for any rational number ''p''/''q'', we have |''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''p''/''q''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.

Now, for any integer ''n'' ≥ 1, define ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;q_n = b^{n!}\,; \quad p_n = q_n \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{a_k}{b^{k!}} = \sum_{k=1}^n {a_k}{b^{n!-k!}} \; .&lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
0 &lt; \left|x - \frac{p_n}{q_n}\right| &amp; = \left|x - \frac{q_n\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{a_k}{b^{k!}}}{q_n}\right| = \left|x - \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{a_k}{b^{k!}}\right| = \left|\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{a_k}{b^{k!}} - \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{a_k}{b^{k!}}\right| = \left|\left(\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{a_k}{b^{k!}} + \sum_{k=n+1}^\infty \frac{a_k}{b^{k!}}\right) - \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{a_k}{b^{k!}}\right| = \sum_{k=n+1}^\infty \frac{a_k}{b^{k!}} \\[6pt]
&amp; \le \sum_{k=n+1}^\infty \frac{b-1}{b^{k!}} &lt; \sum_{k=(n+1)!}^\infty \frac{b-1}{b^k} = \frac{b-1}{b^{(n+1)!}} + \frac{b-1}{b^{(n+1)!+1}} + \frac{b-1}{b^{(n+1)!+2}} + ... = \frac{b-1}{b^{(n+1)!}b^{0}} + \frac{b-1}{b^{(n+1)!}b^{1}} + \frac{b-1}{b^{(n+1)!}b^{2}} + ... = \frac{b-1}{b^{(n+1)!}} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{b^k} \\[6pt]
&amp; = \frac{b-1}{b^{(n+1)!}}\cdot\frac{b}{b-1} = \frac{b}{b^{(n+1)!}} \le \frac{b^{n!}}{b^{(n+1)!}} = \frac{1}{b^{(n+1)! - n!}} = \frac{1}{b^{(n+1)n! - n!}} = \frac{1}{b^{n(n!) + n! - n!}} = \frac{1}{b^{(n!)n}} = \frac{1}{{q_n}^n}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, we conclude that any such ''x'' is a Liouville number.

=== Notes on the proof ===

# The inequality &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=n+1}^\infty \frac{a_k}{b^{k!}} \le \sum_{k=n}^\infty \frac{b-1}{b^{k!}}&lt;/math&gt;follows from the fact that there exists ''k'', ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;{0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;&amp;hellip;, b−1}. Therefore, at most, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= b-1. The largest possible sum would occur if the sequence of integers, (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&amp;hellip;), were (b-1, b-1, ...) where ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= b-1, for all k. &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=n+1}^\infty \frac{a_k}{b^{k!}}&lt;/math&gt;will thus be less than, or equal to, this largest possible sum.
# The strong inequality &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sum_{k=n+1}^\infty \frac{b-1}{b^{k!}} &lt; \sum_{k=(n+1)!}^\infty \frac{b-1}{b^k}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;follows from our motivation to eliminate the series by way of reducing it to a series for which we know a formula. In the proof so far, the purpose for introducing the inequality in 1. comes from intuition that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{b^{k}} = \frac{b}{b-1}&lt;/math&gt;(the [[geometric series]] formula); therefore, if we can find an inequality from &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=n+1}^\infty \frac{a_k}{b^{k!}}&lt;/math&gt;that introduces a series with (b-1) in the numerator, and if we can work to further reduce the denominator term &lt;math&gt;b^{k!}&lt;/math&gt;to &lt;math&gt;b^{k}&lt;/math&gt;, as well as shifting the series indices from 0 to &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, then we will be able to eliminate both series and (b-1) terms, getting us closer to a fraction of the form &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{b^{(exponent)*n}}&lt;/math&gt;, which is the end-goal of the proof. We further this motivation here by selecting now from the sum &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=n+1}^\infty \frac{b-1}{b^{k!}}&lt;/math&gt;a partial sum. Observe that, for any term in &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=n+1}^\infty \frac{b-1}{b^{k!}}&lt;/math&gt;, since  b ≥ 2, then &lt;math&gt;\frac{b-1}{b^{k!}} &lt; \frac{b-1}{b^{k}}&lt;/math&gt;, for all k (except for when n=1). Therefore, &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sum_{k=n+1}^\infty \frac{b-1}{b^{k!}} &lt; \sum_{k=n+1}^\infty \frac{b-1}{b^k}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;(since, even if n=1, all subsequent terms are smaller). In order to manipulate the indices so that k starts at 0, we select a partial sum from within &lt;math&gt;
\sum_{k=n+1}^\infty \frac{b-1}{b^k}
&lt;/math&gt;(also less than the total value since it's a partial sum from a series whose terms are all positive). We will choose the partial sum formed by starting at k = (n+1)! which follows from our motivation to write a new series with k=0, namely by noticing that &lt;math&gt;b^{(n+1)!} = b^{(n+1)!}b^0&lt;/math&gt;.
#For the final inequality &lt;math&gt;\frac{b}{b^{(n+1)!}} \le \frac{b^{n!}}{b^{(n+1)!}}&lt;/math&gt;, we have chosen this particular inequality (true because ''b'' ≥ 2, where equality follows if and only if n=1) because we wish to manipulate &lt;math&gt;\frac{b}{b^{(n+1)!}}&lt;/math&gt;into something of the form &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{b^{(exponent)*n}}&lt;/math&gt;. This particular inequality allows us to eliminate (n+1)! and the numerator, using the property that (n+1)! - n! = (n!)n, thus putting the denominator in ideal form for the substitution &lt;math&gt;q_n = b^{n!}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Irrationality ==
Here we will show that the number ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c''/''d'', where ''c'' and ''d'' are integers and ''d''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, cannot satisfy the inequalities that define a Liouville number. Since every [[rational number]] can be represented as such ''c''/''d'', we will have proven that '''no Liouville number can be rational'''.

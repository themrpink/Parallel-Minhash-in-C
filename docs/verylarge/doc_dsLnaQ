===Illness and death===

During the run of ''[[The Constant Wife]]'' in London, Bergman discovered a small hard lump on the underside of her left breast. On 15 June 1974, she entered a London clinic and had her first operation. While working on ''[[Autumn Sonata]]'', Bergman discovered another lump, and flew back to London for another surgery.&lt;ref name=&quot;MS&quot; /&gt;{{rp|568–569}}
Afterwards, she began rehearsals for ''[[Waters of the Moon]]'' (1978).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Production of Waters of the Moon &amp;#124; Theatricalia|url=https://theatricalia.com/play/3zb/waters-of-the-moon/production/vqd|website=theatricalia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite her illness, she agreed to play Golda Meir in 1981. As soon as the film finished, Bergman retired to her apartment in Cheyne Gardens, London. She suffered greatly from chemotherapy. Photographers had camped outside on the pavement of her London apartment. Because of their telephoto lenses, she refrained from approaching the front window. At this point, the cancer had spread to her spine, collapsing her twelfth vertebra. Her right lung no longer functioned, and only a small part of her left lung had not collapsed.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Leamer|first=Laurence|title=As Time Goes By; The Life of Ingrid Bergman|publisher=Sphere Books Limited|year=1987|isbn=9780722154939|location=London, United Kingdom|page=396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 August 1982 at 12:00 am, her 67th birthday, Ingrid Bergman died in London, from [[breast cancer]]. Her ex-husband, Lars Schmidt and three others were there, where they drank their last toast to her hours earlier. A copy of ''The Little Prince'' found at her bedside, opened to a page near the end.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot; /&gt; The memorial service was held in [[Saint Martin-in-the-Fields]] church in October with twelve hundred mourners in attendance. Her children were in attendance, in addition to the Rossellinis, relatives from Sweden, Liv Ullmann, John Gielgud, Wendy Hiller, Birgit Nilsson and Joss Ackland and many others. As part of the service, quotations from [[Shakespeare]] were read. Musical selections included  ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'This Old Man''' from ''The Inn of the Sixth Happiness,'' a Beethoven song, and strains of ''As Time Goes By''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Most were scattered into the sea, around the islet of Dannholmen near the fishing village of [[Fjällbacka]] in [[Bohuslän]].The location is  on the west coast of Sweden, a place where she had spent most of the summers from 1958 until her death. The remainder of her ashes, were placed next to her parents' ashes in [[Norra Begravningsplatsen]] (Northern Cemetery), [[Stockholm]], Sweden.&lt;ref name=&quot;James&quot; /&gt;

Ingmar Bergman stated that they argued frequently, on set. &quot;She went to a limit and objected to go beyond the limit.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Jan Göransson of the Swedish Film Institute described Bergman as stubborn and loved to question her directors, whose innovative ideas to acting eventually won her over.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Oczypok|first=Kate|date=2015-09-30|title=Swedish Embassy Celebrates 100 Years of Ingrid Bergman|url=https://washdiplomat.com/swedish-embassy-celebrates-100-years-of-ingrid-bergman/|access-date=2020-11-19|website=Washington Diplomat|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergman's ability to instantly change emotions was one of her greatest talents. Dr Funing Tang from the  [[University of Miami]] asserted, &quot;even a moment of reticence, a little glance, or even an eye movement can alter the film's direction and provide her film and character with suspense, ambiguity and mysteriousness, which are rooted in her singular characteristics.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://scholarship.miami.edu/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma991031447435202976&amp;context=L&amp;vid=01UOML_INST:ResearchRepository&amp;lang=en&amp;search_scope=Research&amp;adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&amp;tab=Research&amp;query=sub,exact,Star%20Studies,AND&amp;mode=advanced|title= Acting as Being: Ingrid Bergman's Performances|website=scholarship.miami.edu|last= Tang|first= Funing |date= 13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Ebert echoed the same observation when he cited that Bergman has her way of looking into a man's face. He added, &quot;She doesn't simply gaze at his eyes, as so many actresses do, their thoughts on the next line of dialogue. She peers into the eyes, searching for meaning and clues, and when she is in a close two-shot with an actor, watch the way her own eyes reflect the most minute changes in his expression.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:10&quot; /&gt; For writer Susan Kerr, Bergman might have the greatest downcast eyes in history. &quot;She got her greatest effects in ''Casablanca'' and ''Gaslight'' and ''Spellbound'' and ''Notorious'' by swooping her eyes down to the floor and darting them back and forth, as if watching a mouse scurry across the room&quot;, Kerr wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kerr|first=Sarah|date=1998-01-14|title=Human, All Too Human|language=en-US|work=Slate|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/movies/1998/01/human_all_too_human.html|access-date=2020-11-26|issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It had nothing to do with the body, but in the relationship between her mouth, her skin, and her eyes.

According to  '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Stardom and the Aesthetics of Neorealism: Ingrid Bergman in Rossellini's Italy','' Alfred Hitchcock is responsible of transforming the Bergman's screen persona towards a 'less is more'. He coaxed her to be more understated and neutral, while his camera concentrated the expression in the micro-movement of her face. Much of his work with her involved efforts to quell her expressiveness, gestures and body movements. Susan White, one of the contributing authors in '''A Companion to Alfred Hitchcock''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', argued that while Bergman was one of his favorite collaborators, she is not the quintessential Hitchcock blonde. She is more like 'a resistant and defiant blonde', in contrast to Grace Kelly type, which is more malleable and conformative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Leitch|first=Thomas|url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=ePMxuoC5kTYC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;dq=ingrid+bergman+++%22screen+persona%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CJlZYC2M7T&amp;sig=ACfU3U0H4Dh5xDRVafPi5OKZz0JaKcaxzw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjQnfGOv_7sAhVkxTgGHcxOAfk4PBDoATAIegQIBhAB#v=onepage&amp;q=ingrid%20bergman%20+%20%22screen%20persona%22&amp;f=false|title=A Companion to Alfred Hitchcock|last2=Poague|first2=Leland|date=2011-03-01|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-9731-4|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Bergman, the face became a central aspect to her persona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=McElhaney|first=Joe|title=THE OBJECT AND THE FACE: NOTORIOUS, Bergman and the Close-Up|url=https://www.academia.edu/33339019|language=en|editor-last1=Allen |editor-first1=Richard |editor-last2=Ishi-Gonzales |editor-first2=Same |work=Hitchcock: Past and Future |access-date=10 November 2020 |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415275255 |page=72 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many of her films, her body is covered up in what are often elaborate costumes; nun's habits, doctor's coats, soldier's armors, and Victorian dresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gelley|first=Ora|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gjy0MiV8Bc0C|title=Stardom and the Aesthetics of Neorealism: Ingrid Bergman in Rossellini's Italy|date=21 August 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-32300-3|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique of ''[[chiaroscuro]]'', had been used in many of Bergman's films to capture the ambience and the emotional turmoils of her characters through her face.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Scene Analysis Of Casablanca Film Studies Essay|url=https://www.ukessays.com/essays/film-studies/scene-analysis-of-casablanca-film-studies-essay.php|access-date=6 November 2020|website=UKEssays.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of ''Casablanca'', shadows and lighting were used to make her face look thinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Nichols|first=Peter M.|date=8 August 2003|title=Rick or Victor?

Dan Callahan, a prominent film writer commented that there is an element of suspense when watching how Bergman, who was a polyglot, emotes, enhanced by her voice and the way she read her lines. He wrote that Bergman was less effective while speaking in French and German, as if she were void of creative energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Callahan|first=Dan|title=A Woman's Voice: Ingrid Bergman in Five Languages|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/6483-a-woman-s-voice-ingrid-bergman-in-five-languages|access-date=26 October 2020|website=The Criterion Collection|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angelica Jade Bastién of Vulture echoed the same sentiment, that Bergman's secret weapon is her voice and her accent. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/6147-notorious-the-same-hunger|title=Notorious: The Same|first=Angelica Jade|last=Bastién|website=The Criterion Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For the majority of her pre-scandal career, she played the role of a &quot;fallen woman&quot;. Bergman portrayed women in extra-marital affairs in ''Intermezzo'' and ''Casablanca'', prostitutes in ''Arch of Triumph'' and ''Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde,'' and a villain in ''Saratoga Trunk''. Nonetheless, the public seemed to believe that Bergman's off-screen persona was similar to the saintly characters she played in ''Joan of Arc'' and ''The Bells of St. Mary's''. Although the preponderance of &quot;fallen woman&quot; roles did not besmirch Bergman's saintly status, the publicized affair with Rossellini resulted in a public sense of betrayal. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smit|first=David W.|date=1 July 2005|title=Marketing Ingrid Bergman|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10509200490474465|journal=Quarterly Review of Film and Video|volume=22|issue=3|pages=237–250|doi=10.1080/10509200490474465|s2cid=194074353|issn=1050-9208}}&lt;/ref&gt; David O. Selznick testified later, &quot;I'm afraid I'm responsible for the public's image of her as Saint Ingrid.

Charles River Editors called Bergman the first international movie star. He profiles her international career in his book, how Bergman was the unique star who was willing to act in different languages produced in different countries. However, he admits that Bergman's European pictures have been neglected and relegated in favor of her much more popular Hollywood films, thus prevented most people from gaining a complete understanding of her filmography. As a result, Bergman, today is recognized as a Hollywood star rather than an international actress. To American culture, Bergman is the heroine of Casablanca who later became the darling of Hollywood, thus reducing the equally important phase of her career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=ThriftBooks|title=Ingrid Bergman: The First International... book by Charles River Editors|url=https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/ingrid-bergman-the-first-international-movie-star_charles-river-editors/14287244/|access-date=2020-11-19|website=ThriftBooks|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergman's death was mourned by many, especially her fellow co-stars. They praised her tenacity, spirit, and warmth. Joseph Cotten considered her as a great friend and a great actress. Paul Henreid commented, &quot;She was so terribly beautiful in her youth. She was a very strong lady with great desires and emotions and she led a colorful life.&quot; Liv Ullmann said that she would mourn her because &quot;She made me very proud to be a woman,&quot; she added. Leonard Nimoy praised her tenacity and courage. &quot;I developed enormous respect for her as a person and talent. She was a marvelous lady and actress&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Actress remembered as strong in cancer fight|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/08/30/Actress-remembered-as-strong-in-cancer-fight/3760399528000/|access-date=19 October 2020|website=UPI|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite suffering from cancer for eight years, Bergman continued her career, and won international honors for her final roles. &quot;Her spirit triumphed with remarkable grace and courage&quot;, added biographer [[Donald Spoto]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Spoto&quot; /&gt; Director [[George Cukor]] once summed up her contributions to the film media when he said to her, &quot;Do you know what I especially love about you, Ingrid, my dear? I can sum it up as your naturalness. The camera loves your beauty, your acting, and your individuality. A star must have individuality. It makes you a great star.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chandler&quot; /&gt;{{rp|11}}

Writing about her first years in Hollywood, ''[[Life Magazine|Life]]'' stated that &quot;All Bergman vehicles are blessed&quot;, and &quot;they all go speedily and happily, with no temperament from the leading lady&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LifeMag&quot; /&gt; She was &quot;completely pleased&quot; with her early career's management by [[David O. Selznick]], who always found excellent dramatic roles for her to play, and equally satisfied with her salary, once saying, &quot;I am an actress, and I am interested in acting, not in making money.&quot; ''Life'' adds that &quot;she has greater versatility than any actress on the American screen&amp;nbsp;... Her roles have demanded an adaptability and sensitiveness of characterization to which few actresses could rise&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LifeMag&quot; /&gt;

Biographer Donald Spoto said she was &quot;arguably the most international star in the history of entertainment&quot;. After her American film debut in the film ''[[Intermezzo (1939 film)|Intermezzo: A Love Story]]'' (1939), Hollywood saw her as a unique actress who was completely natural in style and without need of make-up. Film critic [[James Agee]] wrote that she &quot;not only bears a startling resemblance to an imaginable human being; she really knows how to act, in a blend of poetic grace with quiet realism&quot;.&lt;ref name=James/&gt;

Film historian [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]], said she &quot;always strove to be a 'true' woman&quot;, and many filmgoers identified with her:{{quote|There was a time in the early and mid-1940s when Bergman commanded a kind of love in America that has been hardly ever matched. In turn, it was the strength of that affection that animated the &quot;scandal&quot; when she behaved like an impetuous and ambitious actress instead of a saint.&lt;ref name=Thomson&gt;Thomson, David. ''The New Biographical Dictionary of Film'', Alfred A. Knopf, N.Y. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|76}}}}

According to her daughter, Isabella Rossellini, her mother had a deep sense of freedom and independence. She then added, &quot;She was able to integrate so many cultures... she is not even American but she is totally part of American culture like she is totally part of the Swedish, Italian, French, European film making.&quot;&lt;ref name= JP/&gt;

During a press conference in [[Washington, D.C.]] for the promotion of the play ''Joan of Lorraine'', she protested to the newspapers, regarding [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] after seeing it first hand at Lisner Auditorium, the theater where she was working. This led to significant publicity and some hate mail. A bust of Bergman has been placed outside the Lisner Auditorium, in recognition of her protest, and as a reminder of the venue's segregated past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Top Five Last Looks for Graduates|url=https://gwtoday.gwu.edu/top-five-last-looks-graduates|access-date=10 October 2020|website=gwtoday.gwu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergman went to [[Alaska]] during World War II to entertain [[US Army]] troops. Soon after the war ended, she also went to Europe for the same purpose, where she was able to see the devastation caused by the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Carter|first=Grace May|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SeeRDQAAQBAJ&amp;q=bergman+went+to+europe+entertain+troops&amp;pg=PT148|title=Ingrid Bergman|date=24 November 2016|publisher=New Word City|isbn=978-1-61230-098-6|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She arrived in Paris on 6 June 1945 with [[Jack Benny]], Larry Adler and [[Martha Tilton|Martha Thilton]] where they stayed at The Ritz Hotel. Bergman's performance was rather limited; she couldn't sing, she couldn't play an instrument, she didn't have the humour of Jack Benny. In Kassel she ran offstage in tears.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; When they went to see a concentration camp, she stayed behind.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt; After the onset of World War II, Bergman felt guilt for her initial dismissal of the German state. According to her biographer Charlotte Chandler, she had at first considered the [[Nazi]]s only a &quot;temporary aberration, 'too foolish to be taken seriously'. She believed Germany would not start a war.&quot; Bergman felt that &quot;the good people there would not permit it&quot;. Chandler adds that she &quot;felt guilty all the rest of her life because when she was in Germany at the end of the war, she had been afraid to go with the others to witness the atrocities of the [[Nazi concentration camp|Nazi extermination camps]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chandler&quot; /&gt;{{rp|293–295}}

Two types of polarential systems, known as types A and B, are in use. In [[half-duplex operation]] of a type A polarential system, the direct-current balance is independent of [[line (electrical engineering)|line]] resistance. In half-duplex operation of a type B polarential system, the direct current is substantially independent of the line leakage. Type A is better for [[Electrical cable|cable]] loops where leakage is negligible but resistance varies with temperature. Type B is considered better for [[open wire]] where variable line leakage is frequent.&lt;ref&gt;{{FS1037C MS188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a transverse wave, the direction of the oscillation is perpendicular to the direction of motion of the wave.&lt;ref name=&quot;Avadhanulu&quot; /&gt;  A simple example of a polarized transverse wave is vibrations traveling along a taut string ''(see image)''; for example, in a musical instrument like a [[guitar string]]. Depending on how the string is plucked, the vibrations can be in a vertical direction, horizontal direction, or at any angle perpendicular to the string.  In contrast, in [[longitudinal wave]]s, such as [[sound wave]]s in a liquid or gas, the displacement of the particles in the oscillation is always in the direction of propagation, so these waves do not exhibit polarization.  Transverse waves that exhibit polarization include [[electromagnetic wave]]s such as [[light]] and [[radio wave]]s, [[gravitational wave]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and transverse sound waves ([[shear wave]]s) in solids.

An [[electromagnetic wave]] such as light consists of a coupled oscillating [[electric field]] and [[magnetic field]] which are always perpendicular to each other; by convention, the &quot;polarization&quot; of electromagnetic waves refers to the direction of the electric field.  In [[linear polarization]], the fields oscillate in a single direction.  In [[circular polarization|circular]] or [[elliptical polarization]], the fields rotate at a constant rate in a plane as the wave travels.  The rotation can have two possible directions; if the fields rotate in a [[right hand rule|right hand]] sense with respect to the direction of wave travel, it is called [[right circular polarization]], while if the fields rotate in a left hand sense, it is called [[left circular polarization]].

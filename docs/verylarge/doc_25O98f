[[Gravitational-wave astronomy]] is an emerging field of astronomy that employs [[gravitational-wave detector]]s to collect observational data about distant massive objects. A few observatories have been constructed, such as the ''Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory'' [[LIGO]]. LIGO made its [[First observation of gravitational waves|first detection]] on 14 September 2015, observing gravitational waves from a [[binary black hole]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PRL-20160211&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | collaboration = LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration | last1 = Abbott | first1 = Benjamin P. |title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger |journal=[[Phys.

===Astrometry and celestial mechanics===
{{Main|Astrometry|Celestial mechanics}}
[[File:EmissionNebula NGC6357.jpg|thumb|Star cluster [[Pismis 24]] with a nebula]]
One of the oldest fields in astronomy, and in all of science, is the measurement of the positions of celestial objects. Historically, accurate knowledge of the positions of the Sun, Moon, planets and stars has been essential in [[celestial navigation]] (the use of celestial objects to guide navigation) and in the making of [[calendar]]s.

Careful measurement of the positions of the planets has led to a solid understanding of gravitational [[Perturbation theory|perturbations]], and an ability to determine past and future positions of the planets with great accuracy, a field known as [[celestial mechanics]]. More recently the tracking of [[near-Earth object]]s will allow for predictions of close encounters or potential collisions of the Earth with those objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Calvert|first = James B.|date = 28 March 2003|url = http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/phys/orbits.htm|title = Celestial Mechanics|publisher = University of Denver|access-date = 21 August 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060907120741/http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/phys/orbits.htm|archive-date = 7 September 2006|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The measurement of [[stellar parallax]] of nearby stars provides a fundamental baseline in the [[cosmic distance ladder]] that is used to measure the scale of the Universe. Parallax measurements of nearby stars provide an absolute baseline for the properties of more distant stars, as their properties can be compared. Measurements of the [[radial velocity]] and [[proper motion]] of stars allows astronomers to plot the movement of these systems through the Milky Way galaxy. Astrometric results are the basis used to calculate the distribution of speculated [[dark matter]] in the galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.virginia.edu/~rjp0i/museum/engines.html|title=Hall of Precision Astrometry|publisher=[[University of Virginia]] Department of Astronomy|access-date=17 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826104509/http://www.astro.virginia.edu/~rjp0i/museum/engines.html|archive-date=26 August 2006 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, the measurement of the [[stellar wobble]] of nearby stars was [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Astrometry|used to detect]] large [[extrasolar planet]]s orbiting those stars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolszczan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author=Wolszczan, A.| author2=Frail, D.

==Theoretical astronomy==
{{Nucleosynthesis}}
{{Main|Theoretical astronomy}}
Theoretical astronomers use several tools including [[mathematical model|analytical models]] and [[computation]]al [[Numerical analysis|numerical simulations]]; each has its particular advantages. Analytical models of a process are better for giving broader insight into the heart of what is going on. Numerical models reveal the existence of phenomena and effects otherwise unobserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=H.|last=Roth|title=A Slowly Contracting or Expanding Fluid Sphere and its Stability|journal=Physical Review |volume=39|issue=3|pages=525–29|date=1932|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.39.525|bibcode = 1932PhRv...39..525R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=A.S.|last=Eddington|title=Internal Constitution of the Stars|journal=Science|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1926|volume=52|issue=1341|pages=233–40|doi=10.1126/science.52.1341.233|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hJW3JbhnFQMC&amp;pg=PA182|isbn=978-0-521-33708-3|pmid=17747682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorists in astronomy endeavor to create theoretical models and from the results predict observational consequences of those models. The observation of a phenomenon predicted by a model allows astronomers to select between several alternate or conflicting models as the one best able to describe the phenomena.

Theorists also try to generate or modify models to take into account new data. In the case of an inconsistency between the data and model's results, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model so that it produces results that fit the data. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.

Phenomena modeled by theoretical astronomers include: [[stellar dynamics]] and [[Stellar evolution|evolution]]; [[Galaxy formation and evolution|galaxy formation]]; [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale distribution]] of [[matter]] in the [[Universe]]; origin of [[cosmic ray]]s; [[general relativity]] and [[physical cosmology]], including [[string theory|string]] [[cosmology]] and [[astroparticle physics]]. Astrophysical relativity serves as a tool to gauge the properties of large scale structures for which gravitation plays a significant role in physical phenomena investigated and as the basis for [[black hole]] (''astro'')[[physics]] and the study of [[gravitational waves]].

Some widely accepted and studied theories and models in astronomy, now included in the [[Lambda-CDM model]] are the [[Big Bang]], [[dark matter]] and fundamental theories of [[physics]].

Along with [[Cosmic inflation]], [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]] are the current leading topics in astronomy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/dark_matter.html|quote=third paragraph, &quot;There is currently much ongoing research by scientists attempting to discover exactly what this dark matter is&quot;|access-date=2 November 2009|publisher=NASA|title=Dark matter|date=2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091030022817/http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/dark_matter.html| archive-date= 30 October 2009 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; as their discovery and controversy originated during the study of the galaxies.

Because astrophysics is a very broad subject, ''astrophysicists'' typically apply many disciplines of physics, including [[mechanics]], [[electromagnetism]], [[statistical mechanics]], [[thermodynamics]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[theory of relativity|relativity]], [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[particle physics]], and [[atomic, molecular, and optical physics|atomic and molecular physics]].

In practice, modern astronomical research often involves a substantial amount of work in the realms of [[Theoretical physics|theoretical]] and observational physics. Some areas of study for astrophysicists include their attempts to determine the properties of [[dark matter]], [[dark energy]], and [[black holes]]; whether or not [[time travel]] is possible, [[wormhole]]s can form, or the [[multiverse]] exists; and the [[Cosmogony|origin]] and [[ultimate fate of the universe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nasa.gov&quot;/&gt; Topics also studied by theoretical astrophysicists include [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|Solar System formation and evolution]]; [[stellar dynamics]] and [[Stellar evolution|evolution]]; [[galaxy formation and evolution]]; [[magnetohydrodynamics]]; [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale structure]] of [[matter]] in the universe; origin of [[cosmic ray]]s; [[general relativity]] and [[physical cosmology]], including [[string theory|string]] cosmology and [[astroparticle physics]].

===Astrochemistry===

[[Astrochemistry]] is the study of the abundance and reactions of [[molecule]]s in the [[Universe]], and their interaction with [[radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/research/amp-rg/astrochemistry|title=Astrochemistry|date=15 July 2013|newspaper=www.cfa.harvard.edu/|access-date=20 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120211934/https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/research/amp-rg/astrochemistry|archive-date=20 November 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline is an overlap of astronomy and [[chemistry]]. The word &quot;astrochemistry&quot; may be applied to both the [[Solar System]] and the [[interstellar medium]]. The study of the abundance of elements and [[isotope]] ratios in Solar System objects, such as [[meteorite]]s, is also called [[cosmochemistry]], while the study of interstellar atoms and molecules and their interaction with radiation is sometimes called molecular astrophysics. The formation, atomic and chemical composition, evolution and fate of [[molecular cloud|molecular gas clouds]] is of special interest, because it is from these clouds that solar systems form.

Studies in this field contribute to the understanding of the [[formation of the Solar System]], Earth's origin and geology, [[abiogenesis]], and the origin of climate and oceans.

===Astrobiology===

[[Astrobiology]] is an interdisciplinary scientific field concerned with the [[abiogenesis|origins]], [[Protocell|early evolution]], distribution, and future of [[life]] in the [[universe]]. Astrobiology considers the question of whether [[extraterrestrial life]] exists, and how humans can detect it if it does.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/about-astrobiology/ |title=About Astrobiology |access-date=20 October 2008 |date=21 January 2008 |work=NASA Astrobiology Institute |publisher=NASA | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081011192341/http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/about-astrobiology/| archive-date= 11 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''exobiology''' is similar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/exobiology Mirriam Webster Dictionary entry &quot;Exobiology&quot;] (accessed 11 April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Astrobiology makes use of [[molecular biology]], [[biophysics]], [[biochemistry]], [[chemistry]], astronomy, [[physical cosmology]], [[exoplanetology]] and [[geology]] to investigate the possibility of life on other worlds and help recognize [[biosphere]]s that might be different from that on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The life and death of planet Earth |last1=Ward |first1=P.D. |author2=Brownlee, D. |date=2004 |publisher=Owl Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8050-7512-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abiogenesis|The origin]] and early evolution of life is an inseparable part of the discipline of astrobiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://link.springer.com/journal/11084 |title=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres |work=Journal: Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres |access-date=6 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Astrobiology concerns itself with interpretation of existing [[Scientific method|scientific data]], and although speculation is entertained to give context, astrobiology concerns itself primarily with [[hypotheses]] that fit firmly into existing [[Theory#Science|scientific theories]].

===Physical cosmology===
{{Nature timeline}}
{{Main|Physical cosmology}}
[[Cosmology]] (from the Greek κόσμος (''kosmos'') &quot;world, universe&quot; and λόγος (''logos'') &quot;word, study&quot; or literally &quot;logic&quot;) could be considered the study of the Universe as a whole.
[[File:Hubble Extreme Deep Field (full resolution).png|thumb|[[Hubble Extreme Deep Field]]]]

Observations of the [[large-scale structure of the Universe]], a branch known as [[physical cosmology]], have provided a deep understanding of the formation and evolution of the cosmos. Fundamental to modern cosmology is the well-accepted theory of the [[Big Bang]], wherein our Universe began at a single point in time, and thereafter [[metric expansion of space|expanded]] over the course of 13.8 billion years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title = Cosmic Detectives
|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Cosmic_detectives

&lt;/ref&gt; to its present condition.&lt;ref name=Dodelson2003/&gt; The concept of the Big Bang can be traced back to the discovery of the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|microwave background radiation]] in 1965.&lt;ref name=Dodelson2003&gt;{{cite book|last=Dodelson|first=Scott|title=Modern cosmology|date=2003|isbn=978-0-12-219141-1|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|pages=1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of this expansion, the Universe underwent several evolutionary stages. In the very early moments, it is theorized that the Universe experienced a very rapid [[cosmic inflation]], which homogenized the starting conditions. Thereafter, [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|nucleosynthesis]] produced the elemental abundance of the early Universe.&lt;ref name=Dodelson2003/&gt; (See also [[nucleocosmochronology]].)

When the first neutral [[atom]]s formed from a sea of primordial ions, space became transparent to radiation, releasing the energy viewed today as the microwave background radiation. The expanding Universe then underwent a Dark Age due to the lack of stellar energy sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;cosmology 101&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last = Hinshaw|first = Gary|date = 13 July 2006|url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_uni.html|title = Cosmology 101: The Study of the Universe|publisher = NASA WMAP|access-date =10 August 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060813053535/http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_uni.html| archive-date= 13 August 2006 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A hierarchical structure of matter began to form from minute variations in the mass density of space. Matter accumulated in the densest regions, forming clouds of gas and the earliest stars, the [[Population III stars]]. These massive stars triggered the [[reionization]] process and are believed to have created many of the heavy elements in the early Universe, which, through nuclear decay, create lighter elements, allowing the cycle of nucleosynthesis to continue longer.&lt;ref&gt;Dodelson, 2003, pp. 216–61&lt;/ref&gt;

Gravitational aggregations clustered into filaments, leaving voids in the gaps. Gradually, organizations of gas and dust merged to form the first primitive galaxies. Over time, these pulled in more matter, and were often organized into [[Galaxy groups and clusters|groups and clusters]] of galaxies, then into larger-scale superclusters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/gal_lss.html|title = Galaxy Clusters and Large-Scale Structure|publisher = University of Cambridge|access-date =8 September 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061010041120/http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/gal_lss.html| archive-date= 10 October 2006 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various fields of physics are crucial to studying the universe. Interdisciplinary studies involve the fields of [[quantum mechanics]], [[particle physics]], [[plasma physics]], [[condensed matter physics]], [[statistical mechanics]], [[optics]], and [[nuclear physics]].

Fundamental to the structure of the Universe is the existence of [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]]. These are now thought to be its dominant components, forming 96% of the mass of the Universe. For this reason, much effort is expended in trying to understand the physics of these components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Preuss|first = Paul|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/dark-energy.html|title = Dark Energy Fills the Cosmos|publisher = U.S. Department of Energy, Berkeley Lab|access-date =8 September 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060811215815/http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/dark-energy.html| archive-date= 11 August 2006 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extragalactic astronomy===

{{Main|Extragalactic astronomy}}
The study of objects outside our galaxy is a branch of astronomy concerned with the [[Galaxy formation and evolution|formation and evolution of Galaxies]], their morphology (description) and [[Galaxy morphological classification|classification]], the observation of [[Active galaxy|active galaxies]], and at a larger scale, the [[Galaxy groups and clusters|groups and clusters of galaxies]]. Finally, the latter is important for the understanding of the [[large-scale structure of the cosmos]].

Most [[galaxy|galaxies]] are organized into distinct shapes that allow for classification schemes. They are commonly divided into [[spiral galaxy|spiral]], [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical]] and [[irregular galaxy|Irregular]] galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Keel|first = Bill|date = 1 August 2006|url=http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/galaxies/classify.html|title = Galaxy Classification|publisher = University of Alabama|access-date =8 September 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060901074027/http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/galaxies/classify.html| archive-date= 1 September 2006 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the name suggests, an elliptical galaxy has the cross-sectional shape of an [[ellipse]]. The stars move along [[randomness|random]] orbits with no preferred direction. These galaxies contain little or no interstellar dust, few star-forming regions, and older stars. Elliptical galaxies are more commonly found at the core of galactic clusters, and may have been formed through mergers of large galaxies.

A spiral galaxy is organized into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a prominent bulge or bar at the center, and trailing bright arms that spiral outward. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint. Spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by a halo of older stars. Both the [[Milky Way]] and one of our nearest galaxy neighbors, the [[Andromeda Galaxy]], are spiral galaxies.

Irregular galaxies are chaotic in appearance, and are neither spiral nor elliptical. About a quarter of all galaxies are irregular, and the peculiar shapes of such galaxies may be the result of gravitational interaction.

An active galaxy is a formation that emits a significant amount of its energy from a source other than its stars, dust and gas. It is powered by a compact region at the core, thought to be a super-massive black hole that is emitting radiation from in-falling material.

A [[radio galaxy]] is an active galaxy that is very luminous in the radio portion of the spectrum, and is emitting immense plumes or lobes of gas. Active galaxies that emit shorter frequency, high-energy radiation include [[Seyfert galaxy|Seyfert galaxies]], [[Quasar]]s, and [[Blazar]]s. Quasars are believed to be the most consistently luminous objects in the known universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/active_galaxies.html|title=Active Galaxies and Quasars|publisher=NASA|access-date=17 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831033713/http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/active_galaxies.html|archive-date=31 August 2006 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[large-scale structure of the cosmos]] is represented by groups and clusters of galaxies. This structure is organized into a hierarchy of groupings, with the largest being the [[supercluster]]s. The collective matter is formed into [[Galaxy filament|filaments]] and walls, leaving large [[Void (astronomy)|voids]] between.&lt;ref name=&quot;evolving universe&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Zeilik|title=Astronomy: The Evolving Universe|edition=8th|publisher=Wiley|date=2002|isbn=978-0-521-80090-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Solar System]] orbits within the [[Milky Way]], a [[barred spiral galaxy]] that is a prominent member of the [[Local Group]] of galaxies. It is a rotating mass of gas, dust, stars and other objects, held together by mutual gravitational attraction. As the Earth is located within the dusty outer arms, there are large portions of the Milky Way that are obscured from view.

In the center of the Milky Way is the core, a bar-shaped bulge with what is believed to be a [[supermassive black hole]] at its center. This is surrounded by four primary arms that spiral from the core. This is a region of active star formation that contains many younger, [[Stellar population|population I]] stars. The disk is surrounded by a [[Galactic spheroid|spheroid halo]] of older, [[population II]] stars, as well as relatively dense concentrations of stars known as [[globular cluster]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpe.mpg.de/ir/GC/index.php|title=The Galactic Centre|last=Ott|first=Thomas|date=24 August 2006|publisher=Max-Planck-Institut für extraterrestrische Physik|access-date=17 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904140550/http://www.mpe.mpg.de/ir/GC/index.php|archive-date=4 September 2006 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the stars lies the [[interstellar medium]], a region of sparse matter. In the densest regions, [[molecular cloud]]s of [[Hydrogen|molecular hydrogen]] and other elements create star-forming regions. These begin as a compact [[pre-stellar core]] or [[dark nebula]]e, which concentrate and collapse (in volumes determined by the [[Jeans length]]) to form compact protostars.&lt;ref name=Smith2004&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael David|last=Smith|date=2004| pages=53–86|title=The Origin of Stars|chapter=Cloud formation, Evolution and Destruction| publisher=Imperial College Press|isbn=978-1-86094-501-4 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UVgBoqZg8a4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the more massive stars appear, they transform the cloud into an [[H II region]] (ionized atomic hydrogen) of glowing gas and plasma. The [[Solar wind|stellar wind]] and supernova explosions from these stars eventually cause the cloud to disperse, often leaving behind one or more young [[open cluster]]s of stars. These clusters gradually disperse, and the stars join the population of the Milky Way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael David|last=Smith|date=2004| pages=185–99|title=The Origin of Stars|chapter=Massive stars

Kinematic studies of matter in the Milky Way and other galaxies have demonstrated that there is more mass than can be accounted for by visible matter. A [[dark matter halo]] appears to dominate the mass, although the nature of this dark matter remains undetermined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Van den Bergh, Sidney|title=The Early History of Dark Matter|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific|date=1999|volume=111|issue=760|pages=657–60|doi=10.1086/316369|arxiv = astro-ph/9904251 |bibcode = 1999PASP..111..657V |s2cid=5640064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of stars and [[stellar evolution]] is fundamental to our understanding of the Universe. The astrophysics of stars has been determined through observation and theoretical understanding; and from computer simulations of the interior.&lt;ref name=Amos7&gt;Harpaz, 1994, pp. 7–18&lt;/ref&gt; [[Star formation]] occurs in dense regions of dust and gas, known as [[Dark nebula|giant molecular clouds]]. When destabilized, cloud fragments can collapse under the influence of gravity, to form a [[protostar]]. A sufficiently dense, and hot, core region will trigger [[nuclear fusion]], thus creating a [[main-sequence star]].&lt;ref name=Smith2004/&gt;

Almost all elements heavier than [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] were [[nucleosynthesis|created]] inside the cores of stars.&lt;ref name=Amos7/&gt;

'''Socrates of Constantinople''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Σωκράτης ὁ Σχολαστικός}};&lt;ref&gt;The traditional epithet &quot;Socrates Scholasticus&quot; is not well-founded in any early tradition, according to his most recent editor, Theresa Urbainczyk, ''Socrates of Constantinople: Historian of Church and State'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press) 1997. {{ISBN|0-472-10737-2}}. On the title pages of some surviving manuscripts he is designated  ''scholastikos'' (&quot;schooled&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt; {{c.}} 380 – after 439), also known as '''Socrates Scholasticus''', was a 5th-century [[ancient Roman Christianity|Christian]] [[church historian]], a contemporary of [[Sozomen]] and [[Theodoret]].

He is the author of a ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' (&quot;Church History&quot;, Ἐκκλησιαστική Ἱστορία) which covers the [[history of late ancient Christianity]] during the years 305 to 439.

==Life==
He was born in [[Constantinople]]. Even in ancient times nothing seems to have been known of his life except what can be gathered from notices in his ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', which departed from its ostensible model, [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], in emphasizing the place of the emperor in church affairs and in giving secular as well as church history.

Socrates' teachers, noted in his prefaces, were the grammarians [[Helladius of Tarsus|Helladius]] and [[Ammonius Grammaticus|Ammonius]], who came to Constantinople from Alexandria, where they had been pagan priests. A revolt, accompanied by an attack on the pagan temples, had forced them to flee. This attack, in which the [[Serapeum]] was vandalized and destroyed, is dated about 391.

It is not proved that Socrates of Constantinople later profited by the teaching of the [[sophist]] [[Troilus (sophist)|Troilus]]. No certainty exists as to Socrates' precise vocation, though it may be inferred from his work that he was a layman.

In later years he traveled and visited, among other places, [[Paphlagonia]] and [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;'Hist. Eccl.'' 1.12.8, 2.33.30.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' ==
The history covers the years 305 to 439, and experts believe it was finished in 439 or soon thereafter, and certainly during the lifetime of Emperor [[Theodosius II]], i.e., before 450. The purpose of the history is to continue the work of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] (1.1). It relates in simple [[Medieval Greek|Greek]] language what the Church experienced from the days of [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]] to the writer's time. Ecclesiastical dissensions occupy the foreground, for when the Church is at peace, there is nothing for the church historian to relate (7.48.7). In the preface to Book 5, Socrates defends dealing with [[Arianism]] and with political events in addition to writing about the church.

The ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' is one of the few sources of information about [[Hypatia]], the female mathematician and philosopher of Alexandria.

Socrates' account is in many respects well-balanced. He is careful not to use hyperbolic titles when referring to prominent personalities in the church and the government.

He is often assumed to have been a follower of [[Novatianism]], but this is based on the fact that he gives a lot of details about the Novatianists, and speaks of them in generous terms, as he does of Arians and other groups. He speaks of himself as belonging to the Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf202.ii.iii.ii.html Rev. A. C. Zenos, &quot;Life of Socrates,&quot;] A Selected Library of the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, series 2, vol. ii, eds. Henry Wace and Philip Schaff, (New York: Christian, 1887-1900), p. x-xi&lt;/ref&gt;

Socrates asserts that he owed the impulse to write his work to a certain Theodorus, who is alluded to in the [[proemium]] to the second book as &quot;a holy man of [[God]]&quot; and seems therefore to have been a [[monk]] or one of the higher [[clergy]]. The contemporary historians [[Sozomen]] and [[Theodoret]] were combined with Socrates in a sixth-century compilation, which has obscured their differences until recently, when their individual portrayals of the series of Christian emperors were distinguished one from another and contrasted by Hartmut Leppin, ''Von Constantin dem Großen zu Theodosius II'' (Göttingen 1996).

===Editions and translations===
The ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' was first edited in Greek by [[Robert Estienne]], on the basis of ''Codex Regius'' 1443 (Paris, 1544); a translation into Latin by Johannes Christophorson (1612) is important for its variant readings. The fundamental early modern edition, however, was produced by  [[Henri Valois|Henricus Valesius]] (Henri Valois) (Paris, 1668), who used the ''Codex Regius'', a Codex Vaticanus, and a Codex Florentinus, and also employed the indirect tradition of [[Theodorus Lector]] (''Codex Leonis Alladi'').

The text was edited in [[Patrologia Graeca]] vol. 67 (online at [http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/04z/z_0380-0440__Socrates_Scholasticus__Historia_ecclesiastica_%28MPG_067_0030_0842%29__GM.pdf.html documentacatholicaomnia.eu]).

The new critical edition of the text is edited by G. C. Hansen, and published in the series ''Die Griechischen Christlichen Schriftsteller'' (Berlin:Akademie Verlag) 1995.

An English translation  by A. C. Zenos was published in '' [[Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers]]'', Second Series, Vol. 2. Edited by Philip Schaff and Henry Wallace. (Buffalo, NY: Christian Literature Publishing Co., 1890.)  (online editions: [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2601.htm newadvent.org] [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf202.html ccel.org][https://archive.is/20130129093928/http://www.munseys.com/book/7649/ECCLESIASTICAL_HISTORY,_THE munseys.com] .

More recently (2004-2007) Socrates' History has been published in four bilingual volumes by {{ill|Pierre Maraval|fr|Pierre Maraval (historien)}} in the ''[[Sources Chrétiennes]]'' collection.

He was known especially for his trilogy of war films consisting of ''[[A Generation]]'' (1955), ''[[Kanał]]'' (1956) and ''[[Ashes and Diamonds (film)|Ashes and Diamonds]]'' (1958).&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/andrzej-wajda-polish-director-dead-dies-1201883386/|title=Andrzej Wajda, Celebrated Polish Director, Dies at 90|first=Richard|last=Natale|date=9 October 2016|work=variety.com|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is considered one of the world's most renowned filmmakers&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrzej Wajda&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://culture.pl/en/artist/andrzej-wajda#second-menu-15 |title=Andrzej Wajda |access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose works chronicled his native country's political and social evolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.allmovie.com/artist/andrzej-wajda-p115731 |title=Andrzej Wajda |access-date=2017-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dealt with the myths of Polish [[national identity]] offering insightful analyses of the universal element of the Polish experience - the struggle to maintain dignity under the most trying circumstances.

Four of his films have been nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]: ''[[The Promised Land (1975 film)|The Promised Land]]'' (1975),&lt;ref name=&quot;Oscars1976&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1976 |title=The 48th Academy Awards (1976) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=18 March 2012 |work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Maids of Wilko]]'' (1979),&lt;ref name=&quot;Oscars1980&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1980 |title=The 52nd Academy Awards (1980) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=8 June 2013 |work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Man of Iron]]'' (1981) and ''[[Katyń (film)|Katyń]]'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LEussU2CjokC&amp;q=wajda+katyn&amp;pg=PT33|title=Remembering Katyn|first1=Alexander|last1=Etkind|first2=Rory|last2=Finnin|first3=Uilleam|last3=Blacker|first4=Julie|last4=Fedor|first5=Simon|last5=Lewis|first6=Maria|last6=Mälksoo|first7=Matilda|last7=Mroz|date=24 April 2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780745662961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Wajda was born in [[Suwałki]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/10/legendary-polish-director-andrzej-wajda-dies-at-90-1201833782/|title=Andrzej Wajda Dies: Oscar &amp; Palme d'Or-Winning Director Was 90|first=Ross A.|last=Lincoln|date=10 October 2016|work=deadline.com|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poland, the son of Aniela (née Białowąs), a school teacher, and Jakub Wajda, an army officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/88/Andrzej-Wajda.html |title=Andrzej Wajda Biography (1926?-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wajda's father was murdered by the Soviets in 1940 in what came to be known as the [[Katyn massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/katyn-andrzej-wajda-118-mins-15-1709287.html|title=Katyn, Andrzej Wajda, 118 mins, (15)|date=19 June 2009|work=independent.co.uk|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, he joined the Polish resistance and served in the [[Home Army]]. After the war, he studied to be a painter at [[Academy of Fine Arts, Kraków|Kraków's Academy of Fine Arts]] before entering the [[Łódź Film School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culture.pl/en/artist/andrzej-wajda|title=Andrzej Wajda – Twórca – Culture.pl|work=culture.pl|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
After Wajda's apprenticeship to director [[Aleksander Ford]], Wajda was given the opportunity to direct his own film. ''[[A Generation]]'' (1955) was his first major film. At the same time Wajda began his work as a director in theatre, including [[Michael V. Gazzo]]'s ''[[A Hatful of Rain]]'' (1959), ''[[Hamlet]]'' (1960), and ''[[Two for the Seesaw]]'' (1963) by [[William Gibson (playwright)|William Gibson]]. Wajda made two more increasingly accomplished films, which developed further the anti-war theme of ''A Generation'': ''[[Kanał]]'' (1956) ([[Jury Prize (Cannes Film Festival)#Prize winners|Special Jury Prize]] at [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1957, shared with Bergman's ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'') and ''[[Ashes and Diamonds (film)|Ashes and Diamonds]]'' (1958) with [[Zbigniew Cybulski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/andrzej-wajda-dead-oscar-winning-936684|title=Andrzej Wajda, Oscar-Winning Polish Director, Dies at 90|work=hollywoodreporter.com|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While capable of turning out mainstream commercial fare (often dismissed as &quot;trivial&quot; by critics), Wajda was more interested in works of [[allegory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/222801/legendary-polish-director-andrzej-wajda-dies|title=Legendary Polish director Andrzej Wajda dies|work=buenosairesherald.com|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[symbol]]ism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theculturetrip.com/europe/poland/articles/man-of-hope-andrzej-wajda-s-solidarity-trilogy/|title=Man of Hope: Andrzej Wajda's Solidarity Trilogy|first=Thomas|last=Storey|work=theculturetrip.com|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and certain symbols (such as setting fire to a glass of liquor, representing the flame of youthful idealism that was extinguished by the war) recur often in his films. ''[[Lotna]]'' (1959) is full of [[surrealistic]] and symbolic scenes and shots, but he managed to explore other styles, making [[French New Wave|new wave]] style ''[[Innocent Sorcerers]]'' (1960) with music by [[Krzysztof Komeda]], starring [[Roman Polanski]] and [[Jerzy Skolimowski]] (who was also a co-script writer) in the episodes. Then Wajda directed ''[[Samson (1961 Polish film)|Samson]]'' (1961), the story of Jacob, a Jewish boy, who wants to survive during the Nazi occupation of Poland. In the mid-1960s Wajda made ''[[The Ashes (film)|The Ashes]]'' (1965) based on the novel by Polish writer [[Stefan Żeromski]] and directed several films abroad: ''[[Love at Twenty]]'' (1962), ''[[Siberian Lady Macbeth]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wajda.pl/en/filmy/film07.html|title=Andrzej Wajda.

In 1967, Cybulski was killed in a train accident, whereupon the director articulated his grief with ''[[Everything for Sale]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wajda.pl/en/filmy/film12.html|title=Andrzej Wajda.

The following year he directed an ironic satire ''[[Hunting Flies (1969 film)|Hunting Flies]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wajda.pl/en/filmy/film13.html|title=Andrzej Wajda.

==Artistic recognition==
[[File:Olbrychski wajda.jpg|thumb|right|Andrzej Wajda (center), c. 1970]]
The 1970s were the most prolific artistic period for Wajda, who made over ten films: ''[[Landscape After the Battle]]'' (1970), ''[[Pilate and Others]]'' (1971), ''[[The Wedding (1972 film)|The Wedding]]'' (1972) – the film version of the famous Polish poetic drama by [[Stanisław Wyspiański]], ''[[The Promised Land (1975 film)|The Promised Land]]'' (1974), ''[[Man of Marble]]'' (1976) – the film takes place in two time periods, the first film showing the episodes of [[Stalinism]] in Poland, ''[[Smuga cienia|The Shadow Line]]'' (1976), ''[[Rough Treatment]]'' (the other title: ''[[Without Anesthesia]])'' (1978), ''[[The Orchestra Conductor]]'' (1980), starring [[John Gielgud]]; and two psychological and existential films based upon novels by [[Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz]] – ''[[The Birch Wood]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Maids of Wilko]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://spartanecho.org/2016/03/06/poland-marks-90-birthday-of-leading-filmmaker-andrzej-wajd/|title=Poland marks 90 birthday of leading filmmaker Andrzej Wajd|first=Teena|last=Martin|date=6 March 2016|work=spartanecho.org|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1979).

Wajda continued to work in theatre, including ''[[Play Strindberg]]'', Dostoyevsky's ''[[The Possessed (play)|The Possessed]]'' and ''Nastasja Filippovna'' – Wajda's version of ''[[The Idiot (novel)|The Idiot]]'', ''November Night'' by Wyspiański, ''[[The Immigrants]]'' by Sławomir Mrożek, ''The Danton Affair'' or ''The Dreams of Reason''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9804E0DC1F38F93BA1575AC0A965948260? |title = Movie Reviews|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 13 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Andrzej Wajda 1974.jpg|thumb|left|Wajda during filming in 1974]]
Wajda's later commitment to Poland's burgeoning [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement was manifested in ''[[Man of Iron]]'' (1981), a thematic sequel to ''The Man of Marble'', with Solidarity leader [[Lech Wałęsa]] appearing as himself in the latter film. The film sequence is loosely based on the life of [[Anna Walentynowicz]], a hero of socialist labor [[Stakhanovite]] turned dissident and alludes to events from real life, such as the firing of Walentynowicz from the shipyard and the underground wedding of [[Bogdan Borusewicz]] to [[Alina Pienkowska]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Szporer, [http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/solidarity-michael-m-phd-szporer-phd/1110913404 Solidarity: The Great Workers Strike of 1980]. Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The director's involvement in this movement would prompt the Polish government to force Wajda's production company out of business. For the film, Wajda won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].

In 1983, he directed ''[[Danton (1983 film)|Danton]]'', starring [[Gérard Depardieu]] in the title role, a film set in 1794 (Year Two of the [[French Republican Calendar]]) dealing with the [[Reign of Terror|Post-Revolutionary Terror]]. Made against the backdrop of the [[martial law in Poland]], Wajda showed how easily revolution can change into terror and start to &quot;eat its own children.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szporer|first=Mieczyslaw [Michael]|title=Andrzej Wajda's Reign of Terror: Danton's Polish Ambiance|journal=Film Quarterly|date=Winter 1983–1984|volume=37:2|issue=2|pages=27–34|jstor=3697387}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this film Wajda was honoured with the [[Louis Delluc Prize]] and a [[César Award for Best Director]]. In the 1980s he also made ''[[A Love in Germany]]'' (1983) featuring [[Hanna Schygulla]], ''The Chronicle of Amorous Incidents'' (1986) an adaptation of [[Tadeusz Konwicki]]'s novel and ''[[The Possessed (play)|The Possessed]]'' (1988) based on [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]]'s novel. In theatre he prepared an interpretation of Dostoyevsky's ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' (1984) and other unique spectacles such as ''Antygone'', his sequential ''[[Hamlet]]'' versions or an old Jewish play ''[[The Dybbuk]]''. In 1989, he was the President of the Jury at the [[16th Moscow International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Moscow1989&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1989 |title=16th Moscow International Film Festival (1989) |accessdate=24 February 2013 |work=MIFF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316085017/http://moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1989 |archivedate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career after 1990==
[[File:Andrzej Wajda-Post Mortem (2007).jpg|thumb|right|During the filming of ''[[Katyń (film)|Katyń]]'' in 2007]]
In 1990, Andrzej Wajda was honoured by the [[European Film Awards]] for his lifetime achievement, only the third director to be so honoured, after [[Federico Fellini]] and [[Ingmar Bergman]]. In the early 1990s, he was elected a senator and also appointed artistic director of Warsaw's Teatr Powszechny. He continued to make films set during World War II, including ''[[Korczak (film)|Korczak]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmsbytheyear.com/index.php/2015/11/22/korczak-1990/|title=Korczak (1990)|first=Dan|last=Willard|date=23 November 2015|work=filmsbytheyear.com|accessdate=10 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161016192434/http://filmsbytheyear.com/index.php/2015/11/22/korczak-1990/|archive-date=16 October 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1990), a story about a Jewish-Polish doctor who takes care of orphan children, in ''The Crowned-Eagle Ring'' (1993) and ''[[Holy Week (film)|Holy Week]]'' (1995) specifically on Jewish-Polish relations. In 1994, Wajda presented his own film version of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]]'s novel [[The Idiot]] in the movie ''[[Nastasja]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com.au/search?q=miss%20nobody%20wajda&amp;oq=miss%20nobody%20wajda&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l5.2263j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8|title=miss nobody wajda – Google Search|work=google.com.au|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; starring Japanese actor Tamasoburo Bando in the double role of Prince Mishkin and Nastasja. The film's cinematographer was [[Pawel Edelman]], who subsequently became one of Wajda's great collaborators. In 1996, the director went in a different direction with ''[[Miss Nobody (1996 film)|Miss Nobody]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1997/film/reviews/miss-nobody-2-1200449243/|title=Review: 'Miss Nobody'|first=Derek|last=Elley|date=16 March 1997|work=variety.com|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a coming-of-age drama that explored the darker and more spiritual aspects of a relationship between three high-school girls. In 1999, Wajda released the epic film ''[[Pan Tadeusz (1999 film)|Pan Tadeusz]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ce-review.org/99/21/kinoeye21_kosc.html|title=Central Europe Review – Film: Wajda's Pan Tadeusz|work=ce-review.org|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the [[Pan Tadeusz|epic poem]] of the Polish 19th-century romantic poet [[Adam Mickiewicz]].

A year later, at the [[72nd Academy Awards|2000 Academy Awards]], Wajda was presented with an [[honorary Oscar]] for his contribution to world cinema;&lt;ref name=&quot;Storoznyski, Alex (March 2000)&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Storozynski|first1=Alex|title=Poland's Movie Conscience: Academy Honors Andrzej Wajda for his films of freedom|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/poland-movie-conscience-academy-honors-andrzej-wajda-films-freedom-article-1.858349|accessdate=13 September 2016|work=The New York Daily News|date=26 March 2000|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; he subsequently donated the award to [[Kraków]]'s [[Jagiellonian University]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Vancouver Sun (April 2000)&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Polish film-maker donates oscar to university|work=The Vancouver Sun|issue=Final Edition|date=7 April 2000|location=Vancouver, B.C.|page=D9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Wajda directed  ''[[The Revenge (film)|The Revenge]]'', a film version of his 1980s comedy theatre production, with [[Roman Polanski]] in one of the main roles. In February 2006, Wajda received an [[Honorary Golden Bear]] for lifetime achievement at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=&quot;berlinale2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Prizes &amp; Honours 2006|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/2006/03_preistr_ger_2006/03_Preistraeger_2006.html|website=Berlin International Film Festival|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, ''[[Katyń (film)|Katyń]]'' was released, a well-received film about the [[Katyn massacre]], in which Wajda's father was murdered; the director also shows the dramatic situation of those who await their relatives (mothers, wives and children). The film was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] Oscar in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jun/19/katyn-andrzej-wajda-film-review|title=Katyn|first=Peter|last=Bradshaw|date=18 June 2009|accessdate=10 October 2016|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:2010-08 Andrzej Wajda 4.jpg|thumb|right|Wajda pictured with his wife, [[Krystyna Zachwatowicz]], in 2010]]
Wajda followed it with ''[[Tatarak|Sweet Rush]]'' (2009) with [[Krystyna Janda]] as a main character. It is partly based upon a short [[Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz]] novel.  The film is dedicated to [[Edward Kłosiński]], Janda's husband, a cinematographer and a long-time Wajda friend and co-worker who died of cancer the same year. For this film Wajda was awarded by [[Alfred Bauer Prize]] at the 2009 Berlin International Film Festival. He received the Prix FIPRESCI during the 2009 European Film Awards. ''[[Walesa. Man of Hope]]'' (''Wałęsa. Człowiek z nadziei''), Wajda's biography of [[Lech Wałęsa]], based on a script by [[Janusz Głowacki]] and starring [[Robert Więckiewicz]] in the title role, had its world premiere at the 2013 [[Venice International Film Festival]]. His last film was the 2016 ''[[Afterimage (film)|Afterimage]]'' (''Powidoki''), starring [[Bogusław Linda]] as Polish avant-garde painter [[Władysław Strzemiński]].

Wajda founded The Japanese Centre of Art and Technology in [[Kraków]] in 1994. In 2002, he founded and led his own film school with Polish filmmaker [[Wojciech Marczewski]]. Students of Wajda School take part in different film courses led by famous European film makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wajdaschool.pl|title=Strona Wajda School &amp; Studio tymczasowo niedost pna|work=wajdaschool.pl|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and death==
Wajda was married four times. His third wife was actress [[Beata Tyszkiewicz]] with whom he had a daughter, Karolina (born 1967). His fourth wife was the theatre costume designer and actress [[Krystyna Zachwatowicz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culture.pl/pl/tworca/krystyna-zachwatowicz-wajda|title=Krystyna Zachwatowicz-Wajda – Twórca – Culture.pl|work=culture.pl|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, Wajda called for the release of director [[Roman Polanski]] after he was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his [[Roman Polanski sexual abuse case|1977 charge for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8277886.stm|title=Outcry over Polanski's detention|work=BBC News|date=28 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wajda died in [[Warsaw]] on 9 October 2016 at the age of 90 from [[pulmonary failure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-37603756|title=Polish film director Andrzej Wajda dies|date=10 October 2016|accessdate=10 October 2016|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; He was buried at [[Salwator Cemetery]] in [[Kraków]].

'''Marcus Aurelius Claudius 'Gothicus'''' (10 May 214 – January 270), also known as '''Claudius II''', was [[Roman emperor]] from 268 to 270. During his reign he fought successfully against the [[Alemanni]] and decisively defeated the [[Goths]] at the [[Battle of Naissus]]. He died after succumbing to &quot;pestilence&quot;, possibly the [[Plague of Cyprian]] that had ravaged the provinces of the Empire.

== Early life and origin ==
The most significant source for Claudius II is the biography written by [[Trebellius Pollio]] as part of the collection of imperial biographies called the ''[[Historia Augusta]]''. However, his story is riddled with fabrications and obsequious praises. This is due to the fact that in the 4th century, Claudius was declared a relative of [[Constantine the Great]]'s father, [[Constantius I Chlorus]], and, consequently, of the ruling dynasty. Thus, this biography should be used with extreme caution and supplemented with information from other sources: the works of [[Aurelius Victor]], Pseudo-Aurelius Victor, [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], [[Orosius]], [[Joannes Zonaras]], and [[Zosimus]], as well as coins and inscriptions.&lt;ref name=&quot;roman-emperors.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Weigel, Richard D.|url=http://www.roman-emperors.org/claudgot.htm|title=Claudius II Gothicus (268—270)|publisher=An Online Encyclopedia of Roman Emperors|date=2001|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61C8sKPqG?url=http://www.roman-emperors.org/claudgot.htm|archivedate=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By promising a spiritual transformation at a time of great turmoil, the manifestos influenced many figures to seek esoteric knowledge. Seventeenth-century occult philosophers such as [[Michael Maier]], [[Robert Fludd]], and [[Thomas Vaughan (philosopher)|Thomas Vaughan]] interested themselves in the Rosicrucian world view.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yates, Frances A 1972&quot; /&gt; According to the historian David Stevenson, it was influential on [[Freemasonry in Scotland|Freemasonry as it was emerging in Scotland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;origins&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Catholic Historical Review, Vol. 5, No. 2/3 (Jul. - Oct., 1919), pp. 265–270 by Joseph A.

In later centuries, many [[Esotericism|esoteric]] societies have claimed to derive from the original Rosicrucians. Rosicrucianism is symbolized by the [[Rosy Cross]] or Rose Cross. 
The largest and most influential of these societies has been the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], which consisted of several well known members of society. The other is the [[Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis|Rosicrucian Order, A.M.O.R.C]], an international, initiatic Fraternity, which involves itself in several educational and cultural activities worldwide.

== Rosicrucian manifestos ==
=== Origins ===
Between 1614 and 1617, three anonymous manifestos were published, first in Germany and later throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Philalethes |first=Eugenius |url=https://archive.org/details/fameconfessionof0000unse |url-access=registration |title=Fame and Confession of the Fraternity of the Rosy Cross |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |year=1997 |isbn=1-56459-257-X |location=City |page=9ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were the ''[[Fama Fraternitatis|Fama Fraternitatis RC]]'' (''The Fame of the Brotherhood of RC'', 1614), the ''[[Confessio Fraternitatis]]'' (''The Confession of the Brotherhood of RC'', 1615), and the ''[[Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz|Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosicross anno 1459]]'' (1617).

The ''[[Fama Fraternitatis]]'' presents the legend of a German doctor and mystic philosopher referred to as &quot;Father Brother C.R.C.&quot; (later identified in a third manifesto as [[Christian Rosenkreuz]], or &quot;Rose-cross&quot;). The year 1378 is presented as being the birth year of &quot;our Christian Father&quot;, and it is stated that he lived 106 years. After studying in the Middle East under various masters, possibly adhering to [[Sufism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Archived copy |url=http://www.nthposition.com/lususserius.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513044205/http://www.nthposition.com/lususserius.php |archive-date=13 May 2008 |access-date=2009-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was unable to spread the knowledge he had acquired to prominent European scientists and philosophers. Instead, he gathered a small circle of friends/disciples and founded the Rosicrucian Order (this can be deduced to have occurred around 1407).

During Rosenkreuz's lifetime, the order was said to comprise no more than eight members, each a doctor and a sworn [[bachelor]]. Each member undertook an oath to heal the sick without accepting payment, to maintain a secret fellowship, and to find a replacement for himself before he died. Three such generations had supposedly passed between c. 1500 and c. 1600: a time when scientific, philosophical, and religious freedom had grown so that the public might benefit from the Rosicrucians' knowledge, so that they were now seeking good men.&lt;ref&gt;Gorceix, Bernard (1970), ''La Bible des Rose-Croix'', Paris: a work of reference, containing translations of the three Rosicrucian Manifestos, recommended in ''Accès de l'Ésoterisme Occidental'' (1986, 1996) by [[Antoine Faivre]] (École Pratique des Hautes Études, Sorbonne)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reception ===
The manifestos were, and continue to be, not taken literally by many but rather regarded either as [[hoax]]es or as [[allegory|allegorical]] statements. They state: &quot;We speak unto you by parables, but would willingly bring you to the right, simple, easy, and ingenuous exposition, understanding, declaration, and knowledge of all secrets.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yates&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Yates |first=Frances |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8uAAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA321 |title=The Rosicrucian Enlightenment |date=2003 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-49836-9 |page=321 |author-link=Frances Yates |orig-year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Rosicrucian manifesto was influenced by the work of the respected hermetic philosopher [[Heinrich Khunrath]], of [[Hamburg]], author of the ''Amphitheatrum Sapientiae Aeternae'' (1609), who was in turn influenced by [[John Dee]], author of the ''[[Monas Hieroglyphica]]'' (1564).&lt;ref name=&quot;Yates, Frances A 1972&quot; /&gt;{{rp|51}} The invitation to the royal wedding in the ''[[Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz]]'' opens with Dee's philosophical key, the ''Monas Hieroglyphica'' symbol. The writer also claimed the brotherhood possessed a book that resembled the works of [[Paracelsus]]. [[Adam Haslmayr]] a friend of [[Karl Widemann]] wrote him a letter about Rosicrucian people who revealed the Theophrastiam{{clarify|date=April 2019}} 24 December 1611.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grell&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ole Peter Grell |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_m1Mf52bK70C&amp;q=Paracelsus%20Widemann&amp;pg=PA163 |title=Paracelsus |year=1998 |isbn=9004111778 |page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiography, [[Johann Valentin Andreae]] (1586–1654) claimed that the anonymously published ''Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz'' was one of his works, and he subsequently described it as a ''[[ludibrium]]''. In his later works, he makes alchemy an object of ridicule and places it along with music, art, theater, and [[astrology]] in the category of less serious sciences. According to some sources, his role in the origin of the Rosicrucian legend is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Frances Yates|Yates, Frances A.]] (1972), ''The Rosicrucian Enlightenment'', London &amp; Edighoffer, Roland (I-1982, II-1987), ''Rose-Croix et Société Idéale selon Johann Valentin Andreae'', Paris&lt;/ref&gt; But according to others, it was generally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

[[File:Rose_Cross.png|thumb|left|[[Rose Cross]]]]

In the early 17th century, the manifestos caused excitement throughout Europe by declaring the existence of a secret brotherhood of [[alchemy|alchemists]] and sages who were preparing to transform the arts and sciences, and religious, political, and intellectual landscapes of Europe. Wars of politics and religion ravaged the continent. The works were re-issued several times, followed by numerous pamphlets, favorable or otherwise. Between 1614 and 1620, about 400 manuscripts and books were published which discussed the Rosicrucian documents.

The peak of the &quot;Rosicrucianism furore&quot; was reached when two mysterious posters appeared on the walls of Paris in 1622 within a few days of each other. The first said &quot;We, the Deputies of the Higher College of the Rose-Croix, do make our stay, visibly and invisibly, in this city (...)&quot;, and the second ended with the words &quot;The thoughts attached to the real desire of the seeker will lead us to him and him to us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Sédir in ''Les Rose-Croix'', Paris (1972), pp. 65–66&lt;/ref&gt;

The legendary first manifesto, ''[[Fama Fraternitatis|Fama Fraternitatis Rosae Crucis]]'' (1614), inspired the works of [[Michael Maier]] (1568–1622) of Germany; [[Robert Fludd]] (1574–1637) and [[Elias Ashmole]] (1617–1692) of England; [[Teophilus Schweighardt Constantiens]], [[Gotthardus Arthusius]], [[Julius Sperber]], [[Henricus Madathanus]], [[Gabriel Naudé]], [[Thomas Vaughan (philosopher)|Thomas Vaughan]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Sédir (1972), ''Les Rose-Croix'', Paris, pp. 59–68&lt;/ref&gt;

In Elias Ashmole's ''Theatrum Chimicum britannicum'' (1650) he defends the Rosicrucians. Some later works impacting Rosicrucianism were the ''Opus magocabalisticum et theosophicum'' by [[George von Welling]] (1719)—of [[alchemical]] and [[paracelsian]] inspiration—and the ''Aureum Vellus oder Goldenes Vliess'' by [[Hermann Fictuld]] in 1749.

Michael Maier was appointed ''Pfalzgraf'' ([[Count Palatine (Imperial)|Count Palatine]]) by [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]] and King of [[Hungary]] and King of [[Bohemia]]. He also was one of the most prominent defenders of the Rosicrucians, clearly transmitting details about the &quot;Brothers of the Rose Cross&quot; in his writings. Maier made the firm statement that the Brothers of R.C. exist to advance inspired arts and sciences, including [[alchemy]]. Researchers of Maier's writings point out that he never claimed to have produced gold, nor did [[Heinrich Khunrath]] or any of the other &quot;Rosicrucianists&quot;. Their writings point toward a symbolic and spiritual alchemy, rather than an operative one. In a combination of direct and veiled styles, these writings conveyed the nine stages of the involutive-evolutive transmutation of the ''threefold body'' of the human being, the ''threefold soul'' and the ''threefold spirit'', among other [[esoteric knowledge]] related to the &quot;Path of Initiation&quot;.

In his 1618 pamphlet, ''Pia et Utilissima Admonitio de Fratribus Rosae Crucis'', [[Henrichus Neuhusius]] wrote that the Rosicrucians departed for the east due to European instability caused by the start of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. In 1710, [[Sigmund Richter]], founder of the [[secret society]] of the [[Order of the Golden and Rosy Cross|Golden and Rosy Cross]], also suggested the Rosicrucians had migrated eastward. In the first half of the 20th century, [[René Guénon]], a researcher of the [[occult]], presented this same idea in some of his works.&lt;ref&gt;Guénon, René, ''Simboles de la Science Sacrée'', Paris 1962, pp. 95ff&lt;/ref&gt; An eminent author of the 19th century, [[A. E. Waite|Arthur Edward Waite]], presented arguments contradicting this idea.&lt;ref&gt;Waite, Arthur E. (1887), ''The Real History of the Rosicrucians – founded on their own Manifestos, and on facts and documents collected from the writings of Initiated Brethren'', London, p.&amp;nbsp;408&lt;/ref&gt; It was in this fertile field of discourse that many Rosicrucian societies arose. They were based on the occult, inspired by the mystery of this &quot;College of Invisibles&quot;.

Some modern scholars, for example [[Adam McLean]] and [[Giordano Berti]], assume that among the first followers of the Rose Cross there was also the German theologian [[Daniel Cramer]], who in 1617 published a bizarre treatise entitled &quot;Societas Jesus et Rosae Crucis Vera&quot; (The True Society of Jesus and the Rosy Cross), containing 40 emblematic figures accompanied by biblical quotations.&lt;ref&gt;See. Adam McLean (editor), ''The Rosicrucian Emblems of Daniel Cramer: The True Society of Jesus and the Rosy Cross'' (Edinburgh, 1991), and Giordano Berti (editor), ''The Sibyl of the Heart'' (Boves, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prosphil.jpg|left|thumb|Frater C.R.C. – [[Christian Rosenkreuz|Christian Rose Cross]] (symbolical representation)]]
The literary works of the 16th and 17th centuries were full of enigmatic passages containing references to the [[Rose Cross]], as in the following (somewhat modernized):

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;For what we do presage is not in grosse,
For we are brethren of the Rosie Crosse;
We have the Mason Word and second sight,
Things for to come we can foretell aright.&lt;/poem&gt;|[[Henry Adamson]]|The Muses' Threnodie (Perth, 1638).}}

The idea of such an order, exemplified by the network of astronomers, professors, mathematicians, and natural philosophers in 16th-century Europe promoted by such men as [[Johannes Kepler]], [[Georg Joachim Rheticus]], [[John Dee]] and [[Tycho Brahe]], gave rise to the [[Invisible College]]. This was the precursor to the [[Royal Society]] founded in 1660.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The origins of the Royal Society lie in an 'invisible college' of natural philosophers who began meeting in the mid-1640s to discuss the new philosophy of promoting knowledge of the natural world through observation and experiment, which we now call science.&quot; http://royalsociety.org/about-us/history accessed 2 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It was constituted by a group of scientists who began to hold regular meetings to share and develop knowledge acquired by [[scientific method|experimental investigation]]. Among these were [[Robert Boyle]], who wrote: &quot;the cornerstones of the Invisible (or as they term themselves the Philosophical) College, do now and then honour me with their company...&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Cited by R Lomas (2002) in ''The Invisible College'', London&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Wilkins]] and [[John Wallis]], who described those meetings in the following terms: &quot;About the year 1645, while I lived in London (at a time when, by our civil wars, academical studies were much interrupted in both our Universities), ... I had the opportunity of being acquainted with divers worthy persons, inquisitive natural philosophy, and other parts of human learning; and particularly of what hath been called the New Philosophy or Experimental Philosophy. We did by agreements, divers of us, meet weekly in London on a certain day and hour, under a certain penalty, and a weekly contribution for the charge of experiments, with certain rules agreed amongst us, to treat and discourse of such affairs...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cited by H. Lyons (1944) in ''The Royal Society 1660–1940'', Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rose-Cross Degrees in Freemasonry ===
[[File:Bijou fm 18eme.jpg|thumb|170px|right|18° ''Knight of the Rose Croix'' jewel (from the Masonic [[Scottish Rite]])]]

According to [[Jean Pierre Bayard]],&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Bayard, Les Rose-Croix, M. A. Éditions, Paris, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; two Rosicrucian-inspired [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] rites emerged toward the end of 18th century,&lt;!--reference to be added--&gt; the [[Rectified Scottish Rite]], widespread in Central Europe where there was a strong presence of the &quot;Golden and Rosy Cross&quot;, and the [[Scottish Rite|Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite]], first practised in France, in which the 18th degree is called ''[[Scottish Rite#The Rose Croix|Knight of the Rose Croix]]''.

The change from &quot;operative&quot; to &quot;speculative&quot; Masonry occurred between the end of the 16th and the beginning of the 18th century. Two of the earliest speculative Masons for whom a record of initiation exists were Sir [[Robert Moray]] and [[Elias Ashmole]]. [[Robert Vanloo]] states that earlier 17th century Rosicrucianism had a considerable influence on Anglo-Saxon Masonry. [[Hans Schick]] sees in the works of [[Jan Amos Komenský|Comenius]] (1592–1670) the ideal of the newly born English Masonry before the foundation of the [[Grand Lodge]] in 1717. Comenius was in England during 1641.

The [[Gold und Rosenkreuzer]] (Golden and Rosy Cross) was founded by the alchemist [[Samuel Richter]] who in 1710 published ''Die warhhaffte und vollkommene Bereitung des Philosophischen Steins der Brüderschaft aus dem Orden des Gülden-und Rosen-Creutzes'' (''The True and Complete Preparation of the [[Philosopher's Stone]] by the Brotherhood from the Order of the Golden and Rosy Cross'') in Breslau under the pseudonym Sincerus Renatus&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, [[The Occult Roots of Nazism]], p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Prague]] in the early 18th century as a hierarchical [[secret society]] composed of internal circles, recognition signs and alchemy treatises. Under the leadership of [[Hermann Fictuld]] the group reformed itself extensively in 1767 and again in 1777 because of political pressure. Its members claimed that the leaders of the Rosicrucian Order had invented Freemasonry and only they knew the secret meaning of Masonic symbols. The Rosicrucian Order had been founded by Egyptian &quot;[[Ormusse]]&quot; or &quot;[[Licht-Weise]]&quot; who had emigrated to Scotland with the name &quot;Builders from the East&quot;. In 1785 and 1788 the Golden and Rosy Cross group published the ''Geheime Figuren'' or &quot;The Secret Symbols of the 16th and 17th century Rosicrucians&quot;.

Led by [[Johann Christoph von Wöllner]] and General Johann Rudolf von Bischoffwerder, the Masonic lodge (later: ''Grand Lodge'') ''Zu den drei Weltkugeln'' (''The Three Globes'') was infiltrated and came under the influence of the Golden and Rosy Cross. Many Freemasons became Rosicrucianists and Rosicrucianism was established in many lodges. In 1782 at the Convent of Wilhelmsbad the ''Alte schottische Loge Friedrich zum goldenen Löwen'' (''Old Scottish Lodge Friedrich at the Golden Lion'') in Berlin strongly requested [[Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]] and all other Freemasons to submit to the Golden and Rosy Cross, without success.

After 1782, this highly secretive society added Egyptian, Greek, and Druidic mysteries to its alchemy system.&lt;ref&gt;Bayard, Jean-Pierre, ''Les Rose-Croix'', M.A.Édition, Paris 1986&lt;/ref&gt; A comparative study of what is known about the Gold and Rosenkreuzer appears to reveal, on the one hand, that it has influenced the creation of some modern initiatic groups and, on the other hand, that the Nazis (see ''[[The Occult Roots of Nazism]]'') may have been inspired by this German group.

According to the writings of the Masonic historian E.J. Marconis de Negre,&lt;ref&gt;de Negre, E.J. Marconis (1849), ''Brief History of Masonry''&lt;/ref&gt; who together with his father Gabriel M. Marconis is held to be the founder of the &quot;[[Rite of Memphis-Misraim]]&quot; of Freemasonry, based on earlier conjectures (1784) by a Rosicrucian scholar Baron de Westerode&lt;ref&gt;Nesta Webster's, ''[http://ellhn.e-e-e.gr/books/assets/secret_societies.pdf Secret Societies and Subversive Movements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228205819/http://ellhn.e-e-e.gr/books/assets/secret_societies.pdf |date=28 February 2008 }}'', London, 1924, p. 87 and note 37&lt;/ref&gt; and also promulgated by the 18th century secret society called the &quot;[[Order of the Golden and Rosy Cross|Golden and Rosy Cross]]&quot;, the Rosicrucian Order was created in the year 46 when an [[Alexandria]]n [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] sage named [[Ormus]] and his six followers were converted by one of Jesus' disciples, [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]]. Their symbol was said to be a red cross surmounted by a rose, thus the designation of [[Rosy Cross]]. From this conversion, Rosicrucianism was supposedly born, by purifying [[Egyptian Mythology|Egyptian]] [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mysteries]] with the new higher teachings of early Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Further research in ''[http://www.book-of-thoth.com/article1662.html Legend and Mythology: Ormus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113204045/http://book-of-thoth.com/article1662.html |date=13 January 2010 }}'' by Sol, The Book of THoTH, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Maurice Magre (1877–1941) in his book ''Magicians, Seers, and Mystics'', Rosenkreutz was the last descendant of the Germelshausen, a German family from the 13th century. Their castle stood in the [[Thuringian Forest]] on the border of [[Hesse]], and they embraced [[Albigensian]] doctrines. The whole family was put to death by [[Konrad von Marburg|Landgrave Conrad]] of [[Thuringia]], except for the youngest son, who was then five years old. He was carried away secretly by a monk, an Albigensian adept from [[Languedoc]], and placed in a monastery under the influence of the Albigenses, where he was educated and met the four Brothers later to be associated with him in the founding of the Rosicrucian Brotherhood. Magre's account supposedly derives from oral tradition.

Around 1530, more than eighty years before the publication of the first manifesto, the association of cross and rose already existed in Portugal in the [[Convent of the Order of Christ]], home of the [[Knights Templar]], later renamed [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]]. Three ''bocetes'' were, and still are, on the ''abóboda'' (vault) of the initiation room. The rose can clearly be seen at the center of the cross.&lt;ref&gt;[[:pt:António de Macedo|Macedo, António de]] (2000), ''Instruções Iniciáticas – Ensaios Espirituais'', 2nd edition, Hughin Editores, Lisbon, {{ISBN|972-8534-00-0}}, p.&amp;nbsp;55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gandra, J. Manuel (1998), ''Portugal Misterioso'' (''Os Templários''), Lisbon, pp. 348–349&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, a minor writing by [[Paracelsus]] called ''Prognosticatio Eximii Doctoris Paracelsi'' (1530), containing 32 [[prophecy|prophecies]] with [[allegory|allegorical]] pictures surrounded by enigmatic texts, makes reference to an image of a double cross over an open rose; this is one of the examples used to prove the &quot;Fraternity of the Rose Cross&quot; existed far earlier than 1614.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanislas de Guaita]] (1886), ''Au seuil du Mystère''&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, various groups styled themselves Rosicrucian. The diverse groups who link themselves to a &quot;Rosicrucian Tradition&quot; can be divided into three categories: [[esoteric Christianity|Esoteric Christian]] Rosicrucian groups, which profess Christ; [[Masonic]] Rosicrucian groups such as [[Societas Rosicruciana]]; and initiatory groups such as the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]] and the [[Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis]] (AMORC).

The Fellowship seeks to prepare the individual through harmonious development of mind and heart in a spirit of unselfish service to mankind and an all-embracing [[altruism]].

These great adepts have already advanced far beyond the cycle of [[reincarnation|rebirth]]. Their mission is to prepare the ''whole wide world'' for a new phase in religion, which includes awareness of the [[plane (cosmology)|inner worlds]] and the [[subtle bodies]], and to provide safe guidance in the gradual awakening of man's latent [[spirituality|spiritual]] faculties during the next six centuries toward the coming [[Age of Aquarius]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.rosicrucian.com/rms/rmseng01.htm The Rosicrucian Mysteries]'' by [[Max Heindel]]. Accessed 29 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Masonic writers, the Order of the [[Rose Cross]] is expounded in a major Christian literary work that molded the subsequent spiritual beliefs of western civilization: ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' (ca. 1308–1321) by [[Dante Alighieri]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Pike]], ''[[Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry]]'', [http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/morals_and_dogma/table_of_contents.htm &quot;XXX: Knight Kadosh&quot;], p. 822, 1872&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[René Guénon]], ''[http://www.thule-italia.net/Sitospagnolo/Guenon/Guenon,%20Rene%20-%20El%20esoterismo%20de%20Dante.pdf El Esoterismo de Dante]'', pp. 5–6, 14, 15–16, 18–23, 1925&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Manly Palmer Hall]], ''[http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/secret_teachings_of_all_ages/table_of_contents.htm The Secret Teachings of All Ages]: The Fraternity of The Rose Cross'', p. 139, 1928&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Christian-Rosicrucian oriented bodies include:

* [[Lectorium Rosicrucianum]], 1924
* [[Archeosophical Society]], 1968

Freemasonic Rosicrucian bodies providing preparation either through direct study and/or through the practice of symbolic-initiatic journey.
* [[Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite]], 1801
* [[Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia]], 1866, in Scotia (SRIS; Scotland), in Civitatibus Foederatis (MSRICF/SRICF; United States) etc. This Masonic esoteric society reprinted the Rosicrucian manifestos in 1923. A well-known member was [[Arthur Edward Waite]].
*Societas Rosicruciana in Canadiensis, first mentioned in a declaration dated 31 May 1876, but it was not formally constituted (by a Col. W.J.B. McLeod Moore,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=W.Bro. Colonel William James Bury MacLeod Moore |url=https://rosicrucians.ca/macleod-moore/ |last=Salus |first=Incruce |date=4 April 2016 |website=S.R.I.C. - Societas Rosicruciana in Canada |access-date=4 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; through his acquaintance with [[John Yarker]]) until 19 September of that year. Most of the membership came from the town of [[Maitland, Ontario]]. The society constituted a High Council exactly one year later, but the Society went into abeyance at some point after 1889.  In 1936, Ontario College was created via a charter from SRICF. [[Manly Palmer Hall]]'s father, E.H.D. Hall, a member of Canada's first Rosicrucian Society, was voted a charter member of the Ontario College. Due to possible jurisdictional issues, rather than procure a charter from SRIA or SRIS, a Canadian High Council was formed on 29 June 1997, and the SRIC is now an independent body.

Initiatory groups which follow a degree system of study and initiation include:
* The [[Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis]] (AMORC), incorporated in the U.S. in 1915
* The Order of the Hermetic Gold and Rose + Cross, established in the Philippines in 1930
* The Rose Cross Order, reestablished in [[Canary Islands]], Spain in 1988.

The mineral or gemstone '''chrysoberyl''' is an [[aluminate]] of [[beryllium]] with the formula [[beryllium|Be]][[aluminium|Al]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Webmin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Chrysoberyl|volume=6|page=320|first=Frederick William|last=Rudler}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name chrysoberyl is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words χρυσός ''chrysos'' and βήρυλλος ''beryllos'', meaning &quot;a gold-white spar&quot;. Despite the similarity of their names, chrysoberyl and [[beryl]] are two completely different gemstones, although they both contain beryllium. Chrysoberyl is the third-hardest frequently encountered natural gemstone and lies at 8.5 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]], between [[corundum]] (9) and [[topaz]] (8).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klein|first=Cornelis|author2=Cornelius S.

An interesting feature of its crystals are the [[cyclic twin]]s called ''trillings''. These twinned crystals have a [[hexagon]]al appearance, but are the result of a triplet of twins with each &quot;twin&quot; oriented at 120° to its neighbors and taking up 120° of the cyclic trilling. If only two of the three possible twin orientations are present, a &quot;V&quot;-shaped twin results.

Ordinary chrysoberyl is yellowish-green and transparent to [[translucent]]. When the mineral exhibits good pale green to yellow color and is transparent, then it is used as a gemstone. The three main varieties of chrysoberyl are: ordinary yellow-to-green chrysoberyl, cat's eye or '''cymophane''', and '''alexandrite'''. Yellow-green chrysoberyl was referred to as &quot;chrysolite&quot; during the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and Edwardian eras, which caused confusion since that name has also been used for the mineral [[olivine]] (&quot;[[peridot]]&quot; as a gemstone); that name is no longer used in the [[gemological]] nomenclature.

Alexandrite, a strongly [[pleochroic]] (trichroic) gem, will exhibit [[emerald]] green, red and orange-yellow colors depending on viewing direction in partially [[polarization (waves)|polarised light]]. However, its most distinctive property is that it also changes color in artificial (tungsten/halogen) light compared to daylight. The color change from red to green is due to strong absorption of light in a narrow yellow portion of the spectrum, while allowing large bands of more blue-green and red [[wavelength]]s to be transmitted. Which of these prevails to give the perceived hue depends on the spectral balance of the illumination. Fine-quality alexandrite has a green to bluish-green color in daylight (relatively blue illumination of high [[color temperature]]), changing to a red to purplish-red color in [[incandescent light]] (relatively yellow illumination).&lt;ref name=&quot;gia.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gia.edu/alexandrite-quality-factor|title=Alexandrite Quality Factors|accessdate=20 January 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161218193254/https://www.gia.edu/alexandrite-quality-factor|archivedate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, fine-color material is extremely rare. Less-desirable stones may have daylight colors of yellowish-green and incandescent colors of brownish red.&lt;ref name=&quot;gia.edu&quot;/&gt;

Cymophane is popularly known as &quot;cat's eye&quot;. This variety exhibits pleasing [[chatoyancy]] or opalescence that reminds one of the [[Cat senses#Sight|eye of a cat]]. When cut to produce a [[cabochon]], the mineral forms a light-green specimen with a silky band of light extending across the surface of the stone.

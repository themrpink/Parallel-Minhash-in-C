Under the provisions of [[OPCAT]] that entered into force on 22 June 2006 independent international and national bodies regularly visit places where people are deprived of their liberty, to prevent torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Each state that ratified the OPCAT, according to Article 17, is responsible for creating or maintaining at least one independent national preventive mechanism for torture prevention at the domestic level.

The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, citing Article 1 of the [[European Convention for the Prevention of Torture]], states that it will, &quot;by means of visits, examine the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty with a view to strengthening, if necessary, the protection of such persons from torture and from inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpt.coe.int/en/about.htm|title=About the CPT|website=coe.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In times of armed conflict between a signatory of the Geneva Conventions and another party, delegates of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) monitor the compliance of signatories to the Geneva Conventions, which includes monitoring the use of torture. Human rights organizations, such as [[Amnesty International]], the [[World Organization Against Torture]], and [[Association for the Prevention of Torture]] work actively to stop the use of torture throughout the world and publish reports on any activities they consider to be torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apt.ch/|title=Association for the Prevention of Torture|website=apt.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Municipal law===
[[Sovereign state|States]] that ratified the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] have a treaty obligation to include the provisions into [[municipal law]]. The laws of many states therefore formally prohibit torture. However, such ''[[de jure]]'' legal provisions are by no means a proof that, ''[[de facto]]'', the signatory country does not use torture. To prevent torture, many legal systems have a [[right against self-incrimination]] or explicitly prohibit undue force when dealing with suspects.

The French 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], of constitutional value, prohibits submitting suspects to any hardship not necessary to secure his or her person.

The [[U.S. Constitution]] and [[U.S. law]] prohibits the use of unwarranted force or coercion against any person who is subject to interrogation, detention, or arrest. The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] includes protection against [[self-incrimination]], which states that &quot;[n]o person...shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself&quot;. This serves as the basis of the [[Miranda warning]], which [[Law enforcement in the United States|U.S. law enforcement personnel]] issue to individuals upon their arrest. Additionally, the U.S. Constitution's [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] forbids the use of &quot;[[cruel and unusual punishments]],&quot; which is widely interpreted as prohibiting torture. Finally, 18 U.S.C. § 2340&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|18|2340}} ''et seq''..&lt;/ref&gt; ''et seq.'' define and forbid torture committed by U.S. nationals outside the United States or non-U.S. nationals who are present in the United States. As the United States recognizes [[customary international law]], or the [[law of nations]], the U.S. [[Alien Tort Claims Act]] and the [[Torture Victim Protection Act]] also provides legal remedies for victims of torture outside of the United States. Specifically, the status of torturers under the law of the United States, as determined by a famous legal decision in 1980, ''[[Filártiga v. Peña-Irala]]'', 630 [[Federal Reporter|F.2d]] 876 ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|2d Cir.]] 1980), is that, &quot;the torturer has become, like the [[maritime piracy|pirate]] and the [[slave trade]]r before him, [[hostis humani generis]], an enemy of all mankind.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Filártiga v. Peña-Irala |vol=630 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=876 |pinpoint= |court=2d Cir. |date=1980 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/630/876/238132/ |accessdate=6 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exclusion of evidence obtained under torture===

====International law====
Article 15 of the 1984 [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] specify that:

{{quotation|Each State Party shall ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made.}}

A similar provision is also found in Article 10 of the 1985 [[Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture]]:

{{quotation|No statement that is verified as having been obtained through torture shall be admissible as evidence in a legal proceeding, except in a legal action taken against a person or persons accused of having elicited it through acts of torture, and only as evidence that the accused obtained such statement by such means.}}

These provisions have the double dissuasive effect of nullifying any utility in using torture with the purpose of eliciting a confession, as well as confirming that should a person extract statements by torture, this can be used against him or her in criminal proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Human Rights in Times of Conflict and Terrorism |author=Louise Doswald-Beck |page=220 |date=21 March 2011 |publisher=Praeger; 1 edition |isbn=978-0-1995-7894-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is because experience has shown that under torture, or even under a threat of torture, a person will say or do anything solely to avoid the pain. As a result, there is no way to know whether or not the resulting statement is actually correct. If any court relies on any evidence obtained from torture regardless of validity, it provides an incentive for state officials to force a confession, creating a marketplace for torture, both domestically and overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apt.ch/en/evidence-obtained-through-torture/ |title=Exclusion of evidence obtained through torture |publisher=[[Association for the Prevention of Torture]] |accessdate=7 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207021357/http://apt.ch/en/evidence-obtained-through-torture/ |archive-date=7 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most states have prohibited their legal systems from accepting evidence that is extracted by torture. The question of the use of evidence obtained under torture has arisen in connection with prosecutions during the [[War on Terror]] in the United Kingdom and the United States.

=====UK &quot;torture by proxy&quot;=====
The [[United Kingdom|UK]]'s Ambassador to [[Uzbekistan]], [[Craig Murray]], states that he was aware from August 2002 &quot;that the CIA were bringing in detainees to [[Tashkent]] from [[Bagram Air Base|Bagram airport Afghanistan]], who were handed over to the [[Uzbek security services]] (SNB). I presumed at the time that these{{clarification needed|date=September 2020}} were all Uzbek nationals—that may have been a false presumption. I knew that the CIA were obtaining intelligence from their subsequent interrogation by the SNB.&quot; He goes on to say that he did not know at the time that any non-Uzbek nationals were flown to Uzbekistan and although he has studied the reports by several journalists and finds their reports credible he is not a firsthand authority on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.craigmurray.co.uk/archives/2005/07/extraordinary_r_1.html |title=Extraordinary Rendition |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120728095612/http://www.craigmurray.co.uk/archives/2005/07/extraordinary_r_1.html |archivedate=28 July 2012 |website=www.craigmurray.co.uk |date=11 July 2005 |url-status=dead |first=Craig |last=Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Murray suggested that it was &quot;wrong to use information gleaned from torture&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1474852/The-envoy-silenced-after-telling-undiplomatic-truths.html |title=The envoy silenced after telling undiplomatic truths |last=Gedye |first=Robin |date=23 October 2004 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |quote=Murray fired off a memorandum to the Foreign Office last July suggesting that Britain's intelligence services were wrong to use information gleaned from torture victims |accessdate=26 August 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unanimous [[House of Lords Judicial Committee|Law Lords]] judgment on 8 December 2005 confirmed this position. They ruled that, under English law tradition, &quot;torture and its fruits&quot; could not be used in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/terrorism/story/0,15935,1662107,00.html |title=Torture evidence inadmissible in UK courts, Lords rules |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=8 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the information thus obtained could be used by the British police and security services as &quot;it would be ludicrous for them to disregard information about a ticking bomb if it had been procured by torture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4510866.stm |title=Torture ruling's international impact |first=Jon |last=Silverman |work=[[BBC]] |date=8 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray's accusations{{explain|date=August 2020}} did not lead to any investigation by his employer, the FCO, and he resigned after disciplinary action was taken against him in 2004. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office itself was being investigated by the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] because of accusations that it has victimized, bullied and intimidated its own staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1533100,00.html |title=Foreign Office faces probe into 'manipulation' |first=Robert |last=Winnett |work=[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]] |date=20 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray later stated that he felt that he had unwittingly stumbled upon what has been called &quot;torture by proxy&quot;.&lt;ref name=tbp&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/02/14/050214on_onlineonly01?currentPage=all |title=An interview with Jane Mayer |first=David |last=Remnick |work=[[The New Yorker]] on 14 February 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220065459/https://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/02/14/050214on_onlineonly01?currentPage=all |archivedate=9 July 2014 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that Western countries moved people to regimes and nations where it was known that information would be extracted by torture, and made available to them.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

During a [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] debate on 7 July 2009, MP [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] accused the UK government of outsourcing torture, by allowing [[Rangzieb Ahmed]] to leave the country (even though they had evidence against him upon which he was later convicted for terrorism) to Pakistan, where it is said the [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] was given the go-ahead by the British intelligence agencies to torture Ahmed. Davis further accused the government of trying to gag Ahmed, stopping him coming forward with his accusations after he had been imprisoned back in the UK. He said, there was &quot;an alleged request to drop his allegations of torture: if he did that, they could get his sentence cut and possibly give him some money. If this request to drop the torture case is true, it is frankly monstrous. It would at the very least be a criminal misuse of the powers and funds under the Government's Contest strategy, and at worst a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |house=House of Commons |title=Government Policy (Torture Overseas) |date=7 July 2009 |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090707/debtext/90707-0020.htm |accessdate=11 July 2009 |column_start=940 |column_end=943 |volume=495 |jurisdiction=Parliament of the United Kingdom |speaker=[[David Davis (British politician)|Davis, David]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====United States=====
In May 2008, [[Susan J. Crawford]], the [[Convening authority (court-martial)|official overseeing prosecutions]] before the [[Guantanamo military commissions]], declined to refer for trial the case of [[Mohammed al-Qahtani]] because she said, &quot;we tortured [him].&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Qahtani Tortured&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5134328.stm Q&amp;A: Guantanamo detentions] BBC News, 22 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Qhatani remains imprisoned at Guantanamo.

On 28 October 2008, Guantanamo military judge [[Stephen R. Henley]] ruled that the government cannot use statements made as a result of torture in the military commission case against Afghan national [[Mohammed Jawad]]. The judge held that Jawad's alleged confession to throwing a grenade at two U.S. service members and an Afghan interpreter was obtained after armed Afghan officials on 17 December 2002,&lt;ref name=usatoday13Jan2009&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-01-13-torture-hearings_N.htm| title=Court hears arguments over detainee's confession| newspaper=USA Today | agency=Associated Press| date=13 January 2009 | accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; threatened to kill Jawad and his family. The government had previously told the judge that Jawad's alleged confession while in Afghan custody was central to the case against him. Hina Shamsi, staff attorney with the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] National Security Project stated: &quot;We welcome the judge's decision that death threats constitute torture and that evidence obtained as a result must be excluded from trial. Unfortunately, evidence obtained through torture and coercion is pervasive in military commission cases that, by design, disregard the most fundamental due process rights, and no single decision can cure that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yubanet.com/usa/Guantanamo-Judge-Rejects-Evidence-Obtained-Through-Torture-In-Jawad-Case.php#.VRJHGI56LLs|title=Guantanamo Judge Rejects Evidence Obtained Through Torture in Jawad Case|website=yubanet.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402160011/http://yubanet.com/usa/Guantanamo-Judge-Rejects-Evidence-Obtained-Through-Torture-In-Jawad-Case.php#.VRJHGI56LLs|archivedate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, on 19 November, the judge again rejected evidence gathered through coercive interrogations in the military commission case against Afghan national Mohammed Jawad, holding that the evidence collected while Jawad was in U.S. custody on 17–18 December 2002, cannot be admitted in his trial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/national-security/guantanamo-judge-throws-out-more-evidence-obtained-through-torture-jawad-case|title=Guantánamo Judge Throws Out More Evidence Obtained Through Torture in Jawad Case|website=American Civil Liberties Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly because the U.S. interrogator had blindfolded and hooded Jawad in order to frighten him.&lt;ref&gt;usatoday13Jan2009&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Torture has been criticized on humanitarian and moral grounds, on the grounds that evidence extracted by torture is unreliable, and because torture corrupts institutions that tolerate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/ethics/torture/ethics/wrong_2.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213004811/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/ethics/torture/ethics/wrong_2.shtml|archivedate=13 December 2007|title=Consequentialist reasons why torture is wrong|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides degrading the victim, torture debases the torturer: American advisors alarmed at torture by their South Vietnamese allies early in the [[Vietnam War]] concluded that &quot;if a commander allowed his officers and men to fall into these vices [they] would pursue them for their own sake, for the perverse pleasure they drew from them.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Bright Shining Lie&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last =Sheehan| first =Neil| title =A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam| publisher =Random House| edition =first| year =1988| pages =[https://archive.org/details/brightshininglie01shee/page/104 104, 105]| isbn =978-0-394-48447-1| url =https://archive.org/details/brightshininglie01shee/page/104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consequent degeneracy destroyed discipline and morale: &quot;[a] soldier had to learn that he existed to uphold law and order, not to undermine it.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Bright Shining Lie&quot;/&gt;

The [[ticking time bomb scenario]], a [[thought experiment]], asks what to do to a captured terrorist who has placed a [[nuclear bomb]] in a populated area. If the terrorist is tortured, he may explain how to defuse the bomb. The scenario asks if it is ethical to torture the terrorist. A 2006 [[BBC]] poll held in 25 nations gauged support for each of the following positions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6063386.stm|title=One third support some torture|work=BBC News|date=19 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Terrorists pose such an extreme threat that governments should be allowed to use some degree of torture if it may gain information that saves innocent lives.
*Clear rules against torture should be maintained because any use of torture is immoral and will weaken international human rights.
An average of 59% of people worldwide rejected torture. However, there was a clear divide between those countries with strong rejection of torture (such as Italy, where only 14% supported torture) and nations where rejection was less strong. Often this lessened rejection is found in countries severely and frequently threatened by terrorist attacks. E.g., Israel, despite its Supreme Court outlawing torture in 1999, showed 43% supporting torture, but 48% opposing, India showed 37% supporting torture and only 23% opposing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6063386.stm ''Ibid'']: &quot;''Israel has the largest percentage of those polled endorsing the use of a degree of torture on prisoners, with 43% saying they agreed that some degree of torture should be allowed.''&quot; On the Israeli Supreme Court decision outlawing torture, see Judgment Concerning the Legality of the General Security Service’s Interrogation Methods, Supreme Court of Israel, 38 I.L.M. 1471 (1999), and other references at [http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/hrj/iss14/nagan.shtml#Heading300 law.harvard.edu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430213030/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6063386.stm |date=30 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within nations, there is a clear divide between the positions of members of different ethnic groups, religions, and political affiliations, sometimes reflecting distinctions between groups considering themselves threatened or victimized by terror acts and those from the alleged perpetrator groups. For example, the study found that among Jews in Israel 53% favored some degree of torture and only 39% wanted strong rules against torture while Muslims in Israel were overwhelmingly against any use of torture, unlike Muslims polled elsewhere. Differences in general political views also can matter.

There are also different attitudes as to what constitutes torture, as revealed in an ABC News/Washington Post poll, where more than half of the Americans polled thought that techniques such as [[sleep deprivation]] were not torture.&lt;ref&gt;David Morris and Gary Langer ''[https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=90051 Poll: Torture Methods Opposed]'' ABCNEWS.com 27 May 2004 &quot;Americans by nearly 2-to-1 oppose torturing terrorism suspects – but half believe the U.S. government, as a matter of policy, is doing it anyway.

In practice, so-called &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot; techniques were employed by the CIA in situations that did not involve the &quot;ticking time bomb&quot; scenario that has been the subject of opinion polls and public debate. In April 2009 a former senior U.S. intelligence official and a former Army psychiatrist stated that the Bush administration applied pressure on interrogators to use the &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot; techniques on detainees to find evidence of cooperation between al Qaida and the late Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's regime.&lt;ref&gt;Landay, Jonathan (21 April 2009).

Pressed by the BBC in 2010 on his personal view of waterboarding, Presidential Advisor [[Karl Rove]] said: &quot;I'm proud that we kept the world safer than it was, by the use of these techniques. They’re appropriate, they're in conformity with our international requirements and with US law.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesonline.co.uk, 13 March 2010, &quot;Karl Rove says water torture is justified – and a source of pride&quot; by Giles Whittell&lt;/ref&gt;

A 15-month investigation by the Guardian and BBC Arabic, published on March 2013, disclosed that &quot;the US sent a veteran of the ''[[dirty war]]s'' in [[Central America]] to oversee Iraqi [[commando]] units involved in acts of torture during the [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|American-led occupation]]. These American citizens could theoretically be tried by the [[International Criminal Court]] even though the US is not a signatory. But it would have to be referred by the [[UN security council]] and, given that the US has a [[veto]] on the council, this hypothesis is very improbable.&quot; [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]] Legal Director Kat Craig said: &quot;This latest exposé of [[human rights abuses]] shows that torture is [[endemic]] to [[US foreign policy]]; these are considered and deliberate acts, not only sanctioned but developed by the highest echelons of [[United States Department of Defense|US security service]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/07/pentagon-investigating-link-military-torture Pentagon investigating link between US military and torture centres in Iraq.

===Effectiveness===
{{main|Effectiveness of torture for interrogation}}
There is a strong [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] argument against torture; namely, that it is ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=On Witches and Terrorists|first=Michael|last=Shermer|journal=Scientific American|volume=316|issue=5|pages=77|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0517-77|pmid=28437416|year=2017|bibcode=2017SciAm.316e..77S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information supporting the ineffectiveness of torture goes back centuries. For example, during [[witch trial]]s torture was routinely used to try to force subjects to admit their guilt and to identify other witches. It was found that subjects would make up stories if it meant the torture would cease.

There is no scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A utilitarian argument against torture interrogation of terrorists|journal=Science and Engineering Ethics |year=2004 |volume=10 |pages=543–72 |number=3 |author=Jean Maria Arrigo |doi=10.1007/s11948-004-0011-y|pmid=15362710 |citeseerx=10.1.1.470.9264|s2cid=39052391 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of scientific basis for the effectiveness of torture as an interrogation techniques is summarized in a 2006 Intelligence Science Board report titled &quot;EDUCING INFORMATION, Interrogation: Science and Art, Foundations for the Future&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Educing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/dni/educing.pdf|title=Educing Information: Interrogation: Science and Art—Foundations for the Future|date=December 2006|publisher=National Defense Intelligence College|accessdate=15 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some have pointed to some specific cases where torture has elicited true information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/torturecardozo.pdf|title=J. Franklin, Evidence gained from torture: wishful thinking, checkability and extreme circumstances|year=2009|journal=Cardozo Journal of International and Comparative Law |volume= 17 |issue=2|accessdate=28 December 2009 |pages= 281–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rejection===
A famous example of rejection of the use of torture was cited by the Argentine [[National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons]] in whose report, Italian general [[Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa]] was reputed to have said in connection with the investigation of the disappearance of prime minister [[Aldo Moro]], &quot;Italy can survive the loss of Aldo Moro. It would not survive the introduction of torture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071012004601/http://nuncamas.org/english/library/nevagain/nevagain_002.htm Report of Conadep (National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons): Prologue] – 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secrecy===
Before the emergence of modern policing, torture was an important aspect of policing and the use of it was openly sanctioned and acknowledged by the authority. The Economist magazine proposed that one of the reasons torture endures is that torture does indeed work in some instances to extract information/confession if those who are being tortured are indeed guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9832909 | work=The Economist | title=Is torture ever justified? | date=20 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Depending on the culture, torture has at times been carried on in silence (official silence),&lt;ref&gt;Bakir, V. Torture, Intelligence and Sousveillance in the War on Terror: Agenda–Building Struggles. Farnham: Ashgate (2013). Available at: http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9781472402554 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904130440/http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9781472402554 |date=4 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; semi-silence (known but not spoken about), or openly acknowledged in public (to instill fear and obedience).

In the 21st century, even when states sanction their interrogation methods, torturers often work outside the law. For this reason, some prefer methods that, while unpleasant, leave victims alive and unmarked. A victim with no visible damage may lack credibility when telling tales of torture, whereas a person missing fingernails or eyes can easily prove claims of torture. Mental torture, however, can leave scars just as deep and long-lasting as physical torture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aliran.com/oldsite/monthly/2004a/5e.html Abu Ghraib and the ISA: What's the difference?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520150425/http://aliran.com/oldsite/monthly/2004a/5e.html |date=20 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional torturers in some countries have used techniques such as electrical shock, asphyxiation, heat, cold, noise, and sleep deprivation, which leave little evidence, although in other contexts torture frequently results in horrific mutilation or death. However, the most common and prevalent form of torture worldwide in both developed and under-developed countries is beating.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act40/016/2000/en/ Amnesty.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|List of methods of torture}}

[[List of torture methods and devices#Psychological torture methods|Psychological torture]] uses non-physical methods that cause psychological [[suffering]]. Its effects are not immediately apparent unless they alter the [[behavior]] of the tortured person. Since there is no international political consensus on what constitutes psychological torture, it is often overlooked, denied, and referred to by different names. &lt;ref&gt;https://insidetime.org/great-well-of-psychiatric-morbidity&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychological torture is less well known than physical torture and tends to be subtle and much easier to conceal. In practice, the distinctions between physical and psychological torture are often blurred. &lt;ref&gt;https://cislacnigeria.net/understanding-nigerian-torture-prohibition-bill&lt;/ref&gt; Physical torture is the inflicting of severe pain or suffering on a person. In contrast, psychological torture is directed at the psyche with calculated violations of psychological needs, along with deep damage to psychological structures and the breakage of beliefs underpinning normal [[sanity]]. Torturers often inflict both types of torture in combination to compound the associated effects.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Psychological torture also includes deliberate use of extreme [[psychological stress|stressors]] and situations such as [[mock execution]], [[shunning]], violation of deep-seated social or [[sexual norm]]s and [[taboo]]s, or extended [[solitary confinement]]. Because psychological torture needs no physical violence to be effective, it is possible to induce severe psychological pain, suffering, and [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] with no externally visible effects.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

[[Rape]] and other forms of [[sexual abuse]] are often used as methods of torture for interrogative or punitive purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Nooria | last=Mehraby | url=http://www.startts.org.au/default.aspx?id=201 | title=Refugee Women: The Authentic Heroines | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830113952/http://www.startts.org.au/default.aspx?id=201 |archivedate=30 August 2007 }} &lt;!-- Must be a more reliable source than this! --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medical torture]], medical practitioners use torture to judge what victims can endure, to apply treatments that enhance torture, or act as torturers in their own right. [[Josef Mengele]] and [[Shirō Ishii]] were infamous during and after [[World War II]] for their involvement in medical torture and murder. In recent years, however, there has been a push to end medical complicity in torture through both international and state-based legal strategies, as well as litigations against individual physicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hoffman | first = S.

[[Pharmacological torture]] is the use of drugs to produce psychological or physical pain or discomfort.

==Effects==
:''See [[Psychology of torture]] for psychological impact, and aftermath, of torture.''
The consequences of torture reach far beyond immediate pain. Many victims suffer from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), which includes symptoms such as flashbacks (or intrusive thoughts), severe anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, depression and memory lapses. Torture victims often feel guilt and shame, triggered by the humiliation they have endured. Many feel that they have betrayed themselves or their friends and family. All such symptoms are normal human responses to abnormal and inhuman treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irct.org/what-is-torture/defining-torture.aspx |title= What is torture? |publisher=IRCT |accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Reuter was born as '''Israel Beer Josaphat''' in [[Kassel]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/luminary/von-reuter-paul-julius-baron|title=Heroes – Trailblazers of the Jewish People|last=|first=|date=|website=Beit Hatfutsot|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Samuel Levi Josaphat, was a [[rabbi]]. His mother was Betty Sanders. In [[Göttingen]], Reuter met [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], who was experimenting with the [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of [[electric]]al signals via wire.{{cn|date=July 2020}}

On 29 October 1845, he moved to [[London]], calling himself Julius Josaphat. On 16 November 1845, he converted to [[Christianity]] in a ceremony at [[St George's German Lutheran Church|St. George's German Lutheran Chapel]] in London,&lt;ref name= &quot;encyclopedia.com&quot; /&gt; and changed his name to Paul Julius Reuter. One week later, in the same chapel, he married Ida Maria Elizabeth Clementine Magnus of [[Berlin]], daughter of a German banker.{{cn|date=July 2020}}

A former bank clerk, in 1847 he became a partner in Reuter and [[Joseph Abraham Stargardt|Stargardt]], a Berlin book-publishing firm. The distribution of radical pamphlets by the firm at the beginning of the [[Revolutions of 1848|1848 Revolution]] may have focused official scrutiny on Reuter. Later that year, he left for Paris&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.britannica.com/biography/Paul-Julius-Freiherr-von-Reuter | title = Paul Julius, baron von Reuter | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | year = 1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and worked in [[Charles-Louis Havas]]' news agency, [[Havas|Agence Havas]], the future [[Agence France Presse]].{{cn|date=July 2020}}

As [[telegraphy]] evolved, Reuter founded his own news agency in [[Aachen]], transferring messages between [[Brussels]] and Aachen using [[carrier pigeon]]s and thus linking [[Berlin]] and [[Paris]]. Speedier than the post train, pigeons gave Reuter faster access to financial news from the Paris stock exchange.  Eventually, pigeons were replaced by a direct telegraph link.&lt;ref&gt;Standage, T. ''The Victorian Internet'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

A telegraph line was under construction between [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Europe]], and so Reuter moved to London, renting an office near the [[London Stock Exchange|Stock Exchange]].  In 1863, he privately erected a telegraph link to [[Crookhaven]], the farthest south-west point of [[Ireland]]. On nearing Crookhaven, ships from [[United States|America]] threw canisters containing news into the sea. These were retrieved by Reuters and telegraphed directly to London, arriving long before the ships reached Cork.{{cn|date=July 2020}}

In 1872, [[Nasir al-Din Shah]], the Shah of [[Qajar dynasty|Iran]], signed an agreement with Reuter, a [[Reuter concession|concession]] selling him all railroads, canals, most of the mines, all the government's forests, and all future industries of Iran. [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|George Curzon]] called it &quot;The most complete and extraordinary surrender of the entire industrial resources of a kingdom into foreign hands that has ever been dreamed of&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Persia and the Persian question'', Vol. I, London, Frank Cass and Co., 1966, p. 480.&lt;/ref&gt; The Reuter concession was immediately denounced by all ranks of businessmen, clergy, and nationalists of Persia, and it was quickly forced into cancellation.{{cn|date=July 2020}}

On 17 March 1857, Reuter was naturalised as a British subject. On 7 September 1871, the [[Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] granted him the noble title of ''[[Freiherr]]'' (Baron).&lt;ref name=LG /&gt; In November 1891, [[Queen Victoria]] granted him (and his subsequent male-line successors) the right to use that German title (listed as &quot;Baron von Reuter&quot;) in Britain.&lt;ref name=LG /&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;reuters.com&quot;&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE50O1GV20090125?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=topNews | title = Baroness Reuter, last link to news dynasty, dies | publisher = Reuters | date = 25 January 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and children==
In 1845, Reuter married Ida Maria Magnus, daughter of Friedrich Martin Magnus, a German banker in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0017_0_16674.html Paul Julius Freiherr von Reuter], Encyclopaedia Judaica, 2008, The Gale Group.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lüders, Carsten, [https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/gnd137908784.html#ndbcontent &quot;Magnus, Friedrich Martin Freiherr von&quot;] in: Neue Deutsche Biographie 15 (1987), S. 672.&lt;/ref&gt; They had three sons: [[Herbert de Reuter|Herbert]], who became the 2nd Baron (succeeded by his son Hubert as 3rd Baron), George and Alfred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jones, Sir Roderick|title=A life in Reuters|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton |year=1951 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=UAIdAQAAMAAJ}} The 2nd Baron (born 1852, died 1915) committed suicide 3 days after the death of his wife. He was succeeded by his son, Hubert.&lt;/ref&gt; Clementine Maria, one of his daughters, married Count {{ill|Otto Stenbock (diplomat)|sv|Otto Stenbock|lt=Otto Stenbock}}, and after Stenbock's death, Sir [[Herbert Chermside]], a [[Governors of Queensland|governor of Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/chermside-sir-herbert-charles-5575|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|first=Paul D.|last=Wilson|chapter=Chermside, Sir Herbert Charles (1850–1929)|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|via=Australian Dictionary of Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2nd Baron's brother George had two sons, Oliver (who became the 4th Baron) and Ronald. The last member of the family, [[Marguerite, Baroness de Reuter]], widow of the 4th Baron and Paul Julius Reuter's granddaughter-in-law, died on 25 January 2009, at the age of 96.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite news|title=Baroness de Reuter, last link to news dynasty, dies |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/01/26/2474298.htm |agency=[[Reuters]]|work=[[ABC News (Australia)]]|date=26 January 2009|accessdate=21 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and commemoration==
Reuter died in 1899 at [[Villa Reuter]] in [[Nice]], [[French Third Republic|France]]. He was buried in [[West Norwood Cemetery]] in south London.{{cn|date=July 2020}}

Reuter was portrayed by [[Edward G. Robinson]] in the [[Warner Bros.]] biographical film ''[[A Dispatch from Reuters]]'' (1941).{{cn|date=July 2020}}

The Reuters News Agency commemorated the 100th anniversary of the death of its founder by launching a university award (the Paul Julius Reuter Innovation Award) in Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia.com&quot;/&gt;

In [[computing]], a '''server''' is a piece of [[computer]] hardware or software ([[computer program]]) that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called &quot;[[Client (computing)|clients]]&quot;. This [[Systems architecture|architecture]] is called the [[client–server model]]. Servers can provide various functionalities, often called &quot;services&quot;, such as sharing data or [[System resource|resources]] among multiple clients, or performing [[computation]] for a client. A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers. A client process may run on the same device or may connect over a network to a server on a different device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Client–server systems are today most frequently implemented by (and often identified with) the [[request–response]] model: a client sends a request to the server, which performs some action and sends a response back to the client, typically with a result or acknowledgment. Designating a computer as &quot;server-class hardware&quot; implies that it is specialized for running servers on it. This often implies that it is more powerful and reliable than standard [[personal computer]]s, but alternatively, large [[computing cluster]]s may be composed of many relatively simple, replaceable server components.

== History ==
The use of the word ''server'' in computing comes from [[queueing theory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Desktop computers: in perspective |authors=Richard A. Henle, Boris W. Kuvshinoff, C. M. Kuvshinoff |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1992 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g4krAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=server+%22queuing+theory%22 |page=417 |isbn=9780195070316 |quote=Server is a fairly recent computer networking term derived from queuing theory.}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it dates to the mid 20th century, being notably used in {{Harvtxt|Kendall|1953}} (along with &quot;service&quot;), the paper that introduced [[Kendall's notation]]. In earlier papers, such as the {{Harvtxt|Erlang|1909}}, more concrete terms such as &quot;[telephone] operators&quot; are used.

In computing, &quot;server&quot; dates at least to RFC 5 (1969),&lt;ref name=&quot;rulifson&quot;&gt;{{cite IETF |title=DEL |rfc=5 |last=Rulifson |first=Jeff |authorlink=Jeff Rulifson |date=June 1969 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the earliest documents describing [[ARPANET]] (the predecessor of [[Internet]]), and is contrasted with &quot;user&quot;, distinguishing two types of [[Host (network)|host]]: &quot;server-host&quot; and &quot;user-host&quot;. The use of &quot;serving&quot; also dates to early documents, such as RFC 4,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |title=Network Timetable |rfc=4 |last=Shapiro |first=Elmer B. |date=March 1969 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; contrasting &quot;serving-host&quot; with &quot;using-host&quot;.

The [[Jargon File]] defines &quot;[http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/S/server.html server]&quot; in the common sense of a process performing service for requests, usually remote, with the 1981 ([http://www.catb.org/jargon/oldversions/jarg110.txt 1.1.0]) version reading:
{{quote |SERVER n. A kind of [[Daemon (computing)|DAEMON]] which performs a service for the requester, which often runs on a computer other than the one on which the server runs.}}

== Operation ==
[[File:Server-based-network.svg|thumb|A network based on the '''[[client–server model]]''' where multiple individual ''clients'' request services and resources from centralized servers]]
Strictly speaking, the term ''server'' refers to a [[computer program]] or [[process (computing)|process]] (running program). Through [[metonymy]], it refers to a device used for (or a device dedicated to) running one or several server programs. On a network, such a device is called a ''[[Host (network)|host]]''. In addition to ''server'', the words ''serve'' and ''service'' (as noun and as verb) are frequently used, though ''servicer'' and ''servant'' are not.{{efn|A [[servant (CORBA)|CORBA servant]] is a server-side [[Object (computer science)|object]] to which [[method call]]s from [[remote method invocation]] are [[Forwarding (object-oriented programming)|forwarded]], but this is an uncommon usage.}} The word ''service'' (noun) may refer to either the abstract form of functionality, e.g. [[Web service]]. Alternatively, it may refer to a computer program that turns a computer into a server, e.g. [[Windows service]]. Originally used as &quot;servers serve users&quot; (and &quot;users use servers&quot;), in the sense of &quot;obey&quot;, today one often says that &quot;servers serve data&quot;, in the same sense as &quot;give&quot;. For instance, [[web server]]s &quot;serve [up] web pages to users&quot; or &quot;service their requests&quot;.

The server is part of the [[client–server model]]; in this model, a server serves data for [[Client (computing)|clients]]. The nature of communication between a client and server is [[Request–response|request and response]]. This is in contrast with [[peer-to-peer]] model in which the relationship is on-demand reciprocation. In principle, any computerized process that can be used or called by another process (particularly remotely, particularly to share a resource) is a server, and the calling process or processes is a client. Thus any general-purpose computer connected to a network can host servers. For example, if files on a device are shared by some process, that process is a [[file server]]. Similarly, [[web server]] software can ''run'' on any capable computer, and so a [[laptop]] or a personal computer can host a web server.

While request–response is the most common client-server design, there are others, such as the [[publish–subscribe pattern]]. In the publish-subscribe pattern, clients register with a pub-sub server, subscribing to specified types of messages; this initial registration may be done by request-response. Thereafter, the pub-sub server forwards matching messages to the clients ''without'' any further requests: the server ''[[Push technology|pushes]]'' messages to the client, rather than the client ''[[Pull technology|pulling]]'' messages from the server as in request-response.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E24329_01/web.1211/e21049/pubsub.htm Using the HTTP Publish-Subscribe Server], Oracle&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
{{main category|Servers (computing)}}
The role of a server is to share data as well as to share [[System resource|resources]] and distribute work. A server computer can serve its own computer programs as well; depending on the scenario, this could be part of a ''[[quid pro quo]]'' transaction, or simply a technical possibility. The following table shows several scenarios in which a server is used.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Server type
!Purpose
!Clients
|-
|[[Application server]]
|Hosts [[web app]]s (computer programs that run inside a [[web browser]]) allowing users in the network to run and use them, without having to install a copy on their own computers. Unlike what the name might imply, these servers need not be part of the [[World Wide Web]]; any [[local network]] would do.
|Computers with a web browser
|-
|[[Catalog server]]
|Maintains an index or table of contents of information that can be found across a large distributed network, such as computers, users, files shared on file servers, and web apps. [[Directory server]]s and [[name server]]s are examples of catalog servers.
|Any computer program that needs to find something on the network, such a [[Windows domain|Domain member]] attempting to log in, an [[email client]] looking for an email address, or a user looking for a file
|-
|[[Communications server]]
|Maintains an environment needed for one communication endpoint (user or devices) to find other endpoints and communicate with them. It may or may not include a directory of communication endpoints and a presence detection service, depending on the openness and security parameters of the network
|Communication endpoints (users or devices)
|-
|[[Supercomputer|Computing server]]
|Shares vast amounts of computing resources, especially [[Central processing unit|CPU]] and [[random-access memory]], over a network.
|Any computer program that needs more CPU power and RAM than a personal computer can probably afford. The client must be a networked computer; otherwise, there would be no client-server model.
|-
|[[Database server]]
|Maintains and shares any form of [[database]] (organized collections of data with predefined properties that may be displayed in a table) over a network.
|[[Spreadsheet]]s, [[accounting software]], [[Digital asset management|asset management software]] or virtually any computer program that consumes well-organized data, especially in large volumes
|-
|[[Fax server]]
|Shares one or more [[fax machine]]s over a network, thus eliminating the hassle of physical access
|Any fax sender or recipient
|-
|[[File server]]
|Shares [[Computer file|files]] and [[Computer folder|folders]], storage space to hold files and folders, or both, over a network
|Networked computers are the intended clients, even though local programs can be clients
|-
|[[Game server]]
|Enables several computers or gaming devices to play [[multiplayer video game]]s
|Personal computers or [[Video game console|gaming consoles]]
|-
|[[Mail server]]
|Makes [[email]] communication possible in the same way that a [[post office]] makes [[snail mail]] communication possible
|Senders and recipients of email
|-
|[[Media server]]
|Shares [[digital video]] or [[digital audio]] over a network through [[Streaming media|media streaming]] (transmitting content in a way that portions received can be watched or listened to as they arrive, as opposed to downloading an entire file and then using it)
|User-attended personal computers equipped with a monitor and a speaker
|-
|[[Print server]]
|Shares one or more [[Printer (computing)|printers]] over a network, thus eliminating the hassle of physical access
|Computers in need of printing something
|-
|[[Sound server]]
|Enables computer programs to play and record sound, individually or cooperatively
|Computer programs of the same computer and network clients.
|-
|[[Proxy server]]
|Acts as an [[intermediary]] between a client and a server, accepting incoming traffic from the client and sending it to the server. Reasons for doing so include content control and filtering, improving traffic performance, preventing unauthorized network access or simply routing the traffic over a large and complex network.
|Any networked computer
|-
|Virtual server
|Shares hardware and software resources with other virtual servers. It exists only as defined within specialized software called [[hypervisor]]. The [[hypervisor]] presents virtual hardware to the server as if it were real physical hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=IT Explained |title=Server - Definition and Details |url=https://www.paessler.com/it-explained/server |website=www.paessler.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Server virtualization allows for a more efficient infrastructure. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=IT Explained |title=DNS Server Not Responding |url=https://dnsservernotresponding.org/ |website=www.dnsservernotresponding.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Hosts [[web page]]s. A web server is what makes the [[World Wide Web]] possible. Each [[website]] has one or more web servers.
|Computers with a web browser
|}
Almost the entire structure of the [[Internet]] is based upon a [[client–server]] model. High-level [[root nameserver]]s, [[Domain Name System|DNS]], and routers direct the traffic on the internet. There are millions of servers connected to the Internet, running continuously throughout the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Web Servers|url=http://www.serverwatch.com/stypes/index.php/V2Vi|publisher=IT Business Edge|accessdate=July 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and virtually every action taken by an ordinary [[Internet]] user requires one or more interactions with one or more servers. There are exceptions that do not use dedicated servers; for example, [[File sharing|peer-to-peer file sharing]] and some implementations of [[telephony]] (e.g. pre-Microsoft [[Skype]]).

== Hardware ==
[[File:Inside and Rear of Webserver.jpg|thumb|A rack-mountable server with the top cover removed to reveal internal components]]

[[Computer hardware|Hardware]] requirement for servers vary widely, depending on the server's purpose and its software. Servers are more often than not, more powerful and expensive than the clients that connect to them. 

Since servers are usually accessed over a network, many run unattended without a [[computer monitor]] or input device, audio hardware and [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] interfaces. Many servers do not have a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI).  They are configured and managed remotely. Remote management can be conducted via various methods including [[Microsoft Management Console]] (MMC), [[PowerShell]], [[Secure Shell|SSH]] and [[web browser|browser-based]] [[out-of-band management]] systems such as Dell's [[Dell DRAC|iDRAC]] or HP's [[HP Integrated Lights-Out|iLo]].

=== Large servers ===
Large traditional single servers would need to be run for long periods without interruption. [[Availability]] would have to be very high, making hardware reliability and durability extremely important. [[Mission-critical]] enterprise servers would be very [[Fault tolerance|fault tolerant]] and use specialized hardware with low [[failure rate]]s in order to maximize [[uptime]]. [[Uninterruptible power supply|Uninterruptible power supplies]] might be incorporated to guard against power failure. Servers typically include hardware [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] such as dual [[power supply|power supplies]], [[RAID]] [[hard disk|disk]] systems, and [[ECC memory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.rochester.edu/~kshen/papers/usenix2010-li.pdf|title=&quot;A Realistic Evaluation of Memory Hardware Errors and Software System Susceptibility&quot;. Usenix Annual Tech Conference 2010|author=Li, Huang, Shen, Chu|year=2010|accessdate=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with extensive [[Preboot Execution Environment|pre-boot]] memory testing and verification. Critical components might be [[hot swappable]], allowing technicians to replace them on the running server without shutting it down, and to guard against overheating, servers might have more powerful fans or use [[water cooling]]. They will often be able to be configured, powered up and down, or rebooted remotely, using [[out-of-band management]], typically based on [[Intelligent Platform Management Interface|IPMI]]. Server casings are usually [[rack unit|flat and wide]], and designed to be rack-mounted, either on [[19-inch rack]]s or on [[Open Rack]]s. 

These types of servers are often housed in dedicated [[data centers]]. These will normally have very stable power and Internet and increased security. Noise is also less of a concern, but power consumption and heat output can be a serious issue. Server rooms are equipped with air conditioning devices.

=== Clusters ===
{{Main|Server farm}}
A ''server farm'' or ''server cluster'' is a collection of computer servers maintained by an organization to supply server functionality far beyond the capability of a single device. Modern [[data center]]s are now often built of very large clusters of much simpler servers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/google-uncloaks-once-secret-server-10209580/|title=Google uncloaks once-secret server|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET|accessdate=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a collaborative effort, [[Open Compute Project]] around this concept.

=== Appliances ===
A class of small specialist servers called [[network appliance]]s are generally at the low end of the scale, often being smaller than common desktop computers.

=== Mobile ===
A mobile server has a portable form factor, e.g. a [[laptop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurocom.com/products/showroom/products_files/mobileserver/mobileserver.cfm|title=Mobile Server, Power to go, EUROCOM Panther 5SE|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317041045/http://www.eurocom.com/products/showroom/products_files/mobileserver/mobileserver.cfm|archivedate=2013-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to large [[data center]]s or rack servers, the mobile server is designed for on-the-road or ''ad hoc'' deployment into emergency, disaster or temporary environments where traditional servers are not feasible due to their power requirements, size, and deployment time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notebookreview.com/default.asp?newsID=6833&amp;news=Getax+X500+rugged+mobile+server+notebook|title=Mobile Server Notebook}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main beneficiaries of so-called &quot;server on the go&quot; technology include network managers, software or database developers, training centers, military personnel, law enforcement, forensics, emergency relief groups, and service organizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;deskeng1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deskeng.com/articles/aaambz.htm|title=Server-caliber Computer Doubles as a Mobile Workstation}}&lt;/ref&gt; To facilitate portability, features such as the [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]], [[display device|display]], [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] ([[uninterruptible power supply]], to provide power redundancy in case of failure), and mouse are all integrated into the chassis.

On the Internet the dominant operating systems among servers are UNIX-like [[open source software|open-source]] [[Software distribution|distributions]], such as those based on [[Linux]] and [[FreeBSD]],&lt;ref name=&quot;linuxusage&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/os-linux/all/all|title=Usage statistics and market share of Linux for websites|accessdate=18 Jan 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Windows Server]] also having a significant share. Proprietary operating systems such as [[z/OS]] and [[macOS Server]] are also deployed, but in much smaller numbers.

Specialist server-oriented operating systems have traditionally had features such as:
* [[GUI]] not available or optional
* Ability to [[Reconfigurable computing|reconfigure]] and update both hardware and software to some extent without restart
* Advanced [[backup]] facilities to permit regular and frequent online backups of critical [[data]],
* [[Network transparency|Transparent]] data transfer between different [[Volume (computing)|volumes]] or devices
* Flexible and advanced networking capabilities
* Automation capabilities such as [[Daemon (computer software)|daemons]] in UNIX and [[Windows service|services]] in Windows
* Tight system security, with advanced user, resource, data, and memory protection.
* Advanced detection and alerting on conditions such as overheating, processor and disk failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Server Oriented Operating System|url=http://www.ingelec.uns.edu.ar/rts/soos/|accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, today many desktop and server operating systems share similar [[code base]]s, differing mostly in configuration.

== Energy consumption ==
In 2010, data centers (servers, cooling, and other electrical infrastructure) were responsible for 1.1-1.5% of electrical energy consumption worldwide and 1.7-2.2% in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/01/technology/data-centers-using-less-power-than-forecast-report-says.html?_r=0 |title=Data Centers Using Less Power Than Forecast, Report Says |date=31 Jul 2011 |newspaper=[[NY Times]] |accessdate=18 Jan 2013 |first=John |last=Markoff}}&lt;/ref&gt; One estimate is that total energy consumption for information and communications technology saves more than 5 times its [[carbon footprint]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smart2020.org/_assets/files/02_Smart2020Report.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122051650/http://www.smart2020.org/_assets/files/02_Smart2020Report.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 November 2010 |title=SMART 2020: Enabling the low carbon economy in the information age |date=6 Oct 2008 |publisher=[[The Climate Group]] |accessdate=18 Jan 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the rest of the economy by increasing efficiency.

Global energy consumption is increasing due to the increasing demand of data and bandwidth. [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] (NRDC) states that data centers used [https://lifelinedatacenters.com/data-center/reduce-data-center-carbon-footprints/ 91 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) electrical energy in 2013 which accounts to 3% of global electricity usage.] 

[[Environmental groups]] have placed focus on the carbon emissions of data centers as it accounts to 200 million metric tons of [[carbon dioxide]] in a year.

Various hosting providers have introduced [[eco-friendly]] servers that reduced [[carbon emissions]] by 80% through off-shelf equipment and energy management.

Prior his coronation, he had been the [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|Regent Plenipotentiary of Ethiopia]] from 1916. He is a defining figure in modern Ethiopian history.&lt;ref&gt;Erlich, Haggai (2002), ''The Cross and the River: Ethiopia, Egypt, and the Nile''.  Lynne Rienner Publishers.  {{ISBN|1-55587970-5}}, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= babylon148&gt;{{Harvnb |Murrell | p = 148}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[Solomonic dynasty]] who traced his lineage to Emperor [[Menelik I]].

Selassie attempted to modernize the country through a series of [[Modernization under Haile Selassie|political and social reforms]], including the introduction of Ethiopia's [[1931 Constitution of Ethiopia|first written constitution]] and the abolition of slavery. He led the failed efforts to defend Ethiopia during the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]] and spent the period of [[Italian East Africa|Italian occupation]] in exile in England. He returned to lead Ethiopia in 1941 after the British Empire defeated the Italian occupiers in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African campaign]]. He dissolved the [[Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea]], which was established by the UN General Assembly in 1950, and integrated Eritrea as a province of Ethiopia while [[Eritrean War of Independence|fighting to prevent their independence]]. 

His internationalist views led to Ethiopia becoming a charter member of the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;Karsh, Efraim (1988), ''Neutrality and Small States''. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-41500507-8}}, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, he presided over the formation of the [[Organisation of African Unity]], the precursor of the [[African Union]], and served as its first chairman. He was overthrown in a 1974 military coup by a [[Soviet Union]]-backed [[Derg|junta]] and was murdered by the junta on 27 August 1975.

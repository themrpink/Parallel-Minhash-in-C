===Combat Colin===
Doctor Doom made an appearance in Marvel UK's ''[[Combat Colin]]'' strip. A superheroes convention is attacked by the robotic Steamroller Man. After Combat Colin and his sidekick Semi-Automatic Steve defeats the robot, its controller is revealed to be Doctor Doom, who explains that after years of being defeated by American superheroes he thought (wrongly) he could stand a chance against some incompetent Brits. The final panel shows Doom back in his lair, surrounded by newspaper cuttings detailing his past defeats and wondering how he would do in a fight with [[Thomas the Tank Engine]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Transformers (Marvel Comics)|Transformers]]'' UK #270-271&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spider-Man: Life Story===
In ''Spider-Man: Life Story'' a reality in which the Marvel superheroes aged in real time and started their careers the same year as their publication, Doctor Doom has taken over [[Earth]] as a result of [[Civil War (comics)|the Civil War between Captain America and Iron Man]] and a resistance being formed to combat him composed of those that didn't die or disappear entirely.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man Life Story #6: All My Enemies''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Doctor Doom is '''Victor van Damme''', a direct descendant of [[Vlad III the Impaler|Vlad Tepes Dracula]]. Victor is introduced as part of the [[Baxter Building]], a government think-tank of young geniuses, which counts among its students Reed Richards and Susan Storm.  He works to help Reed Richards develop a teleporter to the &quot;[[Negative Zone|N-Zone]]&quot;, but reprograms its coordinates without telling anyone. This causes the accident that gave the [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]] their powers, though Victor maintains that the original Richards programming was so bad that even he couldn't fix it, and that it was this that led to the accident. van Damme is caught in the same accident, and his flesh was changed into a [[metal]]lic hide (with a somewhat reduced ability to perceive tactile sensations and [[Pain and nociception|pain]]), clawed hands, his legs transmogrified into demonic [[goat]]-hooved legs, and he re-appeared on Earth in [[Copenhagen]]. Initially, he assumes that he himself was the only one who had been transformed by the accident. Reed speculates this to be the result of Doom's own arrogance causing him to assume that only he was 'worthy' of such a transformation. Doom denounces Reed as a 'freak' during their initial confrontation when he finally learns what Reed's powers are.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

For a time, he is the charismatic leader of a small [[micronation]] called &quot;Free State&quot;, &quot;Freezone&quot;, or &quot;The Keep&quot;, a [[Permanent Autonomous Zone]] located in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], where citizens lived without rent in a [[shanty town]] under [[squatter's rights]], and were given free comforts and necessities in exchange for loyalty to Doom. There, a [[dragon]] [[tattoo]] was given to new settlers, incorporating microfibers that interfaced with the brain and acting as a mind control device. However, the Fantastic Four eventually freed them from Doom's control during their first battle, and all subsequently left, although they were unable to imprison Doom due to his diplomatic immunity as a result of his citizenship.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

During the Namor fiasco, the mother of Sue and Johnny Storm returned to New York. After the adventure, it was revealed that she possesses a similar dragon tattoo.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

After the collapse of the Keep, Doom returned to Latveria, and in six months turned the country around. Latveria went from being a [[Third World]] nation to the ninth-richest country in the world. While seemingly happy, the citizens of Latveria are bearers of Doom's Dragon tattoos. He is revered by the citizens, who refer to him as &quot;the good doctor&quot;.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

In the same story arc, he [[Body switch|switches bodies]] with Reed Richards in order to gain a life he felt was rightfully his, though leaving Reed with the wealth and control of Latveria; in his own form of honor, he felt this made him better than Reed, who he blamed for sullying his reputation with his claims that Doom's calculations were the ones at fault. This turned out to be part of his scheme to gain recognition by doing what Reed couldn't do &amp;mdash; specifically, saving Johnny Storm's life from an alien parasite that he himself had summoned.  Reed, having studied Doom's magical texts, returns to New York to battle the concurrent threat of the zombie Fantastic Four from an alternative universe, and absorbs the parasite, but it attempts to possess his mind. Reed defeats the zombie Fantastic Four and is willing to lose himself in the dimensions to erase the zombie threat, but Doom switches their bodies back and does so himself.  His last request is to be remembered as the one who saved the world. However this was not granted.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Doom seemed reappeared in issue six of ''[[Ultimate Power]]'', a crossover between the &quot;Ultimate Universe&quot; and the universe of the revamped [[Supreme Power|Squadron Supreme]], seemingly intent on taking over the Supremeverse. In issue eight, it is revealed to be simply a Doombot (the first seen in the Ultimate Marvel continuity).  Dr. Doom is seemingly later seen in ''[[Ultimates 3]]'' as the one controlling Ultron.  It is noted however, that, starting in &quot;Frightful&quot; and through his ''[[Ultimate Power]]'' and ''Ultimates 3'' appearances, his 'goat legs' are not present and he resembles his regular 616 counterpart. As to why his former look has been abandoned is yet to be revealed.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

The Thing supposedly killed Victor in his Latverian home as retribution for Doom's causing the events of [[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|''Ultimatum'']]; however' Doom later reveals that while in the zombie universe he had Sue and Johnny Storm's mother, Mary Storm, in disguise ruling in his absence.  This was who The Thing unknowingly killed.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate FF'' #5&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ultimate version of Reed Richards, calling himself the [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Maker]] appears to for all intents and purposes have taken over the role of Doctor Doom – right down to his facial scarring.{{issue|date=February 2013}} This may have been done to show how similar the two really are.

More recently, the Parliament of Doom (an organization constituted by numerous Doctor Dooms of alternative universes led by the Victor von Doom of [[Earth-616]]) fought the Fantastic Four in an alternative past of Earth-616, being one of the Doctor Dooms present very similar to Ultimate Doctor Doom, with features such as goat-hooved legs. It is yet unknown if that Doctor Doom is in fact from the Ultimate Universe or an alternative version of that reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|penciller=Bagley, Mark|inker=|story=Nativity|title=Fantastic Four|issue=9|volume=4|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the events of ''Cataclysm'', [[Phil Coulson]] and [[Danny Ketch]] reveal that the real Victor (who once again has his goat-hooved legs) was being held captive by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] before it disbanded. He is released and forced to join the [[Future Foundation]] alongside Invisible Woman, [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], and [[Tony Stark]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate FF'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[All-New X-Men|time-displaced young X-Men]] are transferred into the Ultimate Marvel universe by accident, Doom captures and brainwashes the younger [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] to serve him, requiring the displaced X-Men to join forces with [[Miles Morales|the new Ultimate Spider-Man]] and the Ultimate Marvel X-Men to rescue him.

Later on, it is revealed that Doom has teamed up with Hydra to &quot;save&quot; the world from corrupt governments. He captures Miles Morales and Jessica Drew, hoping to exploit their DNA to create an army of super soldiers. The All-New Ultimates come to rescue him, but Miles escapes with a power he was not aware he had, defeating Doctor Doom and all of Hydra single-handedly, before [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|the sky turns red and the image of another Earth appears in the sky]].&lt;ref&gt;''Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man'' #12&lt;/ref&gt;

====Powers and abilities====
Ultimate Doom is a scientific genius, though unlike Richards he approaches science as an art rather than as a system. While the Fantastic Four's powers are compared to the four classical [[Classical elements#Classical elements in Greece|Greek elements]], Doom has attained the power of one of the additional [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|Chinese elements]], metal - his body is almost completely solid metal, possessing no discrete internal organs, somewhat similar to [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] (though Doom cannot switch back to a flesh-and-blood form).  In his first post-transformation encounter with the Fantastic Four, he expelled the remains of his internal organs as a [[poison]]ous gas. He can grow and fling [[porcupine]]-like volleys of metal spikes from his forearms, and also possesses a regenerative power, but he cannot heal any wound caused by his own body. Thus, the scar Reed made on Doom's face remains, because it was done with one of his own spikes.  Doom exhibits super strength as well, as he is able to break the arms off the zombie version of Ben Grimm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ultimate Fantastic Four #30-31&quot;&gt;''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #30-31&lt;/ref&gt; The creature Doom summoned selected his body as the most powerful it could find, passing up Thor and Thing.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

The Ultimate Universe's Doom is also an accomplished sorcerer. Richards discovers that Johnny did not get the life form inside him from the Negative Zone. Rather, Victor &quot;summoned&quot; the creature inside Johnny. Later, Doom used sorcery to exchange minds with Richards.  He proved powerful enough to fight with the Zombie Galacti and survive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ultimate Fantastic Four #30-31&quot;/&gt;

Originally, in ''Ultimate Marvel Team-Up'', Doom (visually identical to his normal Marvel self) was presented as President and &quot;his holiness&quot; of a theocratical Latveria. The country was said to be impoverished and starving, and Doom had declared a holy war (though without any open conflict) on the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Marvel Team-Up'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Marvel Team-Up'' #14&lt;/ref&gt; This would be ignored and [[retcon]]ned away in later Ultimate Marvel titles.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Warlock===
On the original [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter Earth]], Victor Von Doom is a genius, but not a villain. He appears in the original ''[[Adam Warlock|Warlock]]'' series. Von Doom's armor is now represented only by the metallic mask and the green hood/cape is gone. He is referred to as &quot;the most famous egghead in the country&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Warlock #5&quot;&gt;''Warlock #5''&lt;/ref&gt; the &quot;like spirit-brother&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Warlock #6''&lt;/ref&gt; of Reed Richards, and &quot;a man as dedicated to counter-Earth's survival as Earth's Von Doom is to its enslavement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Warlock #7''&lt;/ref&gt;

He and [[Brute (Reed Richards)|Reed Richards]] are mentioned in passing in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #2 and ''Warlock'' #2 as scientists without any sort of super-powers.
In ''Warlock'' #6, it is told how Von Doom and Richards had been roommates, friends and lab partners in college.  After Von Doom's disfiguring accident, Richards' emotional support prevented him from becoming a villain.  When Richards and his three companions hijacked a spaceship in order to be the first humans in space, Von Doom unsuccessfully attempted to talk him out of it.  Though all of the counter &quot;fantastic four&quot; were exposed to cosmic radiation, it was only Richards that was affected due to the interference of [[Man-Beast]] though the effects only became apparent ten years later when he became the [[Brute (Reed Richards)|Brute]] due to &quot;latent cosmic radiation - and a mysterious guiding hand&quot;.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

In ''Warlock'' #5-7, Victor Von Doom was employed at the Livermore Valley Lab in California where he worked on &quot;Earth-Corer-1&quot;, a vehicle designed to tunnel into the Earth.  He warned the president of a massive earthquake that would be caused by a nuclear bomb test.  The resulting earthquake accidentally activated &quot;Antipersonnel missiles, nicknamed deathbirds&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Warlock #5&quot;/&gt; which began killing people indiscriminately.  Von Doom was able to destroy them with Adam Warlock's help, using one of his inventions called the &quot;deactivator&quot;.  He died while helping Adam Warlock stop the Brute from absorbing all of Counter-Earth's geothermal energy, turning him back into Reed Richards.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===What If?===

In ''What If Doctor Doom had become a Hero?'', Victor heeds Reed Richards warnings that his machine to contact his mother is dangerous, and with Reed's help corrects the device's faults and learns of his mother's plight in Hell. As in the real world he seeks the hidden sect of monks, but now becomes a force for good known simply as Doom. He frees his mother from Hell, by magic and then liberates Latveria from Count Ruffalo, marrying his beloved Valeria shortly afterwards. However, the evil demon Mephisto, enraged at losing the soul of Doom's mother, traps the monarch's entire nation in a glass ball, saying he will free them if to replace his mother's soul, Doom chooses to give either Valeria's or his own. Doom agonises over this choice, but his ambition and pride are still stronger than his love and he chooses Valeria. Though still a force for good in the years to come, Doom spends each [[Midsummer's Eve]] (as he did for his mother's soul in the regular universe) battling demons in exchange for Valeria's soul.&lt;ref&gt;''What If'' Vol 1 #22&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''What If Doctor Doom Were [[Sorcerer Supreme]]?'' A young Victor Von Doom does not stay with the hidden sect of monks in the Himalayas but continues on to find the [[Ancient One]]. The Ancient One immediately sees Doom's vast potential and hopes that by taking him on as a student he can teach Doom humility and channel his talent away from evil. Doom's fellow student, [[Mordo]], is threatened by Doom's vastly superior talent and plans to kill off the competition. Doom easily turns the table on Mordo and plants a small bomb in his skull as insurance against further treachery. The Ancient One fears that Doom is growing into a dangerous power and so decides to conclude their relationship by taking Doom to the Mephisto's realm to rescue Doom's mother. Later Doom dies and transfers his memories into Doctor Strange (in this universe he is only a surgeon).&lt;ref&gt;''What If'' Vol 2 #52&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''What if Doctor Doom had Become the Thing?'', Recounting his college days, Doom again listens to Reed when he tells him of the flaw in his machine and becomes Reed's friend after this, but in this reality he is simply using Reed to further his own goals. During the construction of Reed's rocket, Doom notices the flaw in the shielding, but tells no-one, instead creating armor to protect himself. However, the armor actually absorbs and amplifies the cosmic rays, turning Doom into the Thing. Donning a cloth covering and the mask of his armor, he tries to kill Reed, believing him to be at fault. During the fight, Doom causes Ben Grimm (who never became Reed's test pilot and joined the army to assist in the Gamma Bomb Project, preventing Rick Jones from entering the test site) to be outside during the gamma bomb malfunctioning. The ensuing radiation exposure turns Ben into a [[Hulk|hulk-like being]] who, calling himself &quot;Grimm&quot;, beats back Doom, forcing him to flee.&lt;ref&gt;''What If Doctor Doom Had Become the Thing?'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''What If: Secret Wars,'' Doom is made aware of the [[Beyonder (comics)|Beyonder's]] survival by the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] and kills him. He returns to Earth and defeats various threats to his power such as the [[Inhumans]], [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]] and the remaining superheroes, with [[Tony Stark]] and [[Doctor Strange|Dr. Strange]] being the last opponents. He establishes a &quot;paradise&quot;  on Earth by eliminating global warming, poverty, war and providing a device for unlimited energy. Next, he deals with cosmic threats and defeats the united forces of the [[Skrull]], [[Kree]], [[Shi'ar]], [[Technarchy]], [[Badoon]] and [[Brood (comics)|Brood]]. While in space, he obtains the [[Infinity Gems]] by defeating the [[Elders of the Universe]]. He uses them to release his mother's soul from Mephisto's captivity. Eventually, he comes in conflict with the [[Celestials (comics)|Celestials]], but defeats them after a 407-year-long battle. Earth has suffered from the conflict and Doom uses his remaining power to restore it. He rejoins humanity to aid and guide them to become a powerful force, introducing himself as simply &quot;Victor&quot; rather than Doom.&lt;ref&gt;''What If: Secret Wars'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''What If: Iron Man: Demon in an Armor'', Tony Stark is Doom's college roommate rather than Reed Richards, inspiring Doom to develop a machine that allows him to transfer his mind into Stark's body while leaving Stark trapped in his body with no memory of his past. While Doom uses Stark's connections and company to establish himself, the amnesic Stark- believing himself to be Doom- works to rebuild his life, creating his own company and forming his own reputation from the ground up. This culminates in a confrontation between the two wearing early versions of their respective armours- Doom having developed a green-and-silver Iron Man armour while Stark has created Doom's costume with gold and a red cloak-, during which Doom reveals the truth about their switch, only for Stark to reject the offer to switch back because Doom has destroyed the name of Tony Stark while Doctor von Doom has developed an honourable reputation.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===Earth-111===
In this reality, visited by Ben Grimm while attempting to recover the coordinates of the Ultimate Nullifer, divided between the subconscious minds of four alternative Johnny Storms, Doom was the leader of the 'Challengers of Doom' consisting of himself, Reed Richard, Sue Storm, and the Hulk-, with Latveria having been destroyed in an unspecified past disaster and Doom relocating to New York to become a hero.&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' vol. 2 #47&lt;/ref&gt; When Galactus came to Earth and landed in Russia, Doom dismissed it as a hoax, prompting Grimm to note that this Doom was more arrogant than the version he knew as the Doom of Earth-616 was at least willing to listen to even his enemies if the situation was serious enough rather than dismiss their views as automatically irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' vol. 2 #48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earth-1191===
Unlike most Dooms this version is portrayed as an old, senile man with delusions of retaining his old authority and physique- seen by Layla Miller as a natural 'evolution' of Doom's inability to accept that ''he'' might be the reason for his failures-, although with periods of lucidity in which, while physically decrepit, he is still as smart and devious (and in turn, dangerous) as ever. Currently he's been taken in by Layla Miller and Madrox who hope that he can aid them in traveling back to their present.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #47&lt;/ref&gt;  After finding and reactivating a time machine provided by the future X-Men, Doom, while in another lucid moment, betrays them, ordering the time travelling &quot;Cortex&quot; to use his abilities to &quot;Destroy all the mutants&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;X-Factor #49&lt;/ref&gt; Doom also is able to take control of the heavily cyberized Cyclops though his cybernetic implants, forcing Cyclops' daughter Ruby to take him down.  After this battle, Doom vanishes.&lt;ref&gt;X-Factor #50&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original Guardians of the Galaxy/Earth-691===

In the alternate 31st century of the original [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], designated as Earth-691, Doom is revealed to have somehow managed to place his brain inside the adamantium skeleton of Wolverine at some unknown point in the past, hiding this fact with a perfect replica of his original armor, cloak, hood, and simulated flesh intended to give the appearance that he has managed to prolong his life to unnatural lengths. He eventually comes face to face with Rancor, a descendant of Wolverine, and offers to become her ally, though he secretly intended to use her as a pawn for his own gain, while she intends to slay him on her quest to determine what happened to Wolverine. During their battle, Doom reveals himself to be in control of Wolverine's skeleton, heavily modified with cybernetics and missing half of one of the claws, which had eventually come into the possession of Rancor. Rancor manages to strike at one of Doom's robotic eyes, forcing him to retreat. Doom is not seen again in this reality.

=== Marvel Two-In-One (2017) / Earth-TRN667 ===
When the Thing and the Human Torch search the multiverse for the missing Richards' family, their first new universe visited is a world where the Thing died in the Fantastic Four's first battle with Galactus. This universe's Doctor Doom saved Earth by transferring his mind into Galactus, with the result that Earth has been spared but Doom's hunger for power has led him to devour every other planet in the universe. With the help of Earth-TRN667 Reed Richards and Emma Frost, they are able to defeat him by transferring his mind into Emma Frost's body, while she becomes the Life Bringer.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Two-In-One'' #5-6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Venomverse ===
In [[Venomverse]], Doom was consumed by the [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics#P|Poisons]] and became their second in command after [[Thanos#Venomverse|Poison Thanos]]. He with the other Poison Heroes started battling the [[Alternative versions of Venom#Characters introduced in VenomVerse|Army of Venoms]] in which he was the only survivor.&lt;ref&gt;''Venomverse''. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Then the Poisons tried to invade Earth-616, he and Thanos along with the other Poisons got killed, after the Poison Queen was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;''Venomized''.

[[Comic Book Resources]] ranks Victor Von Doom as their fourth favorite Marvel character. Journalist Brent Ecenbarger cited him being able to &quot;stand up against entities like [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], the [[Beyonder]], and [[Galactus]] and often comes out on top&quot;, as well as the tragedy of any &quot;other number of circumstances could have led to Doctor Doom being a savior, but as it is, instead he remains Marvel’s greatest villain.&quot;, a fact that later led to the character's redemption.

[[File:Aybabtu.png|thumb|The phrase as it appears in the introduction to ''[[Zero Wing]]''.]]

&quot;'''All your base are belong to us'''&quot; is a popular [[Internet meme]] based on a phrase found in the opening [[cutscene]] of the European release of the 1992 [[Sega Mega Drive|Mega Drive/Genesis]] port of the 1989 arcade video game ''[[Zero Wing]]'', which is subtitled and [[Engrish|poorly translated]]. 

The meme developed from this in the early 2000s, as the result of a [[GIF animation]] depicting the opening text, which was initially popularized on the [[Something Awful]] message forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Julian | last=Dibbell | date=2008-01-18 | title=Mutilated Furries, Flying Phalluses: Put the Blame on Griefers, the Sociopaths of the Virtual World | url=http://archive.wired.com/gaming/virtualworlds/magazine/16-02/mf_goons?currentPage=all | work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competency of the patient===

The ability to give informed consent is governed by a general requirement of competency. In common law jurisdictions, adults are presumed competent to consent. This presumption can be rebutted, for instance, in circumstances of mental illness or other incompetence. This may be prescribed in legislation or based on a common-law standard of inability to understand the nature of the procedure. In cases of incompetent adults, a [[health care proxy]] makes medical decisions. In the absence of a proxy, the medical practitioner is expected to act in the patient's best interests until a proxy can be found.

By contrast, '[[Minor (law)|minors]]' (which may be defined differently in different jurisdictions) are generally presumed incompetent to consent, but depending on their age and other factors may be required to provide [[Informed assent]]. In some jurisdictions (e.g. much of the U.S.), this is a strict standard. In other jurisdictions (e.g. England, Australia, Canada), this presumption may be rebutted through proof that the minor is 'mature' (the '[[Gillick competence|Gillick standard]]'). In cases of incompetent minors, informed consent is usually required from the parent (rather than the 'best interests standard') although a [[parens patriae]] order may apply, allowing the court to dispense with parental consent in cases of refusal.

===Deception===

Research involving deception is controversial given the requirement for informed consent. Deception typically arises in social psychology, when researching a particular psychological process requires that investigators deceive subjects. For example, in the [[Milgram experiment]], researchers wanted to determine the willingness of participants to obey authority figures despite their personal conscientious objections. They had authority figures demand that participants deliver what they thought was an electric shock to another research participant. For the study to succeed, it was necessary to deceive the participants so they believed that the subject was a peer and that their electric shocks caused the peer actual pain.

Nonetheless, research involving deception prevents subjects from exercising their basic right of autonomous informed decision-making and conflicts with the ethical principle of [[respect for persons]].

The [[Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct]] set by the [[American Psychological Association]] says that psychologists may conduct research that includes a deceptive compartment only if they can both justify the act by the value and importance of the study's results and show they could not obtain the results by some other way. Moreover, the research should bear no potential harm to the subject as an outcome of deception, either physical pain or [[emotional distress]]. Finally, the code requires a debriefing session in which the experimenter both tells the subject about the deception and gives subject the option of withdrawing the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=2. American Psychological Association. (2002)|title=2010 Amendments to the American Psychological Association ethical principles of psychologists and code of conduct.|url=http://www.apa.org/ethics/code/index.aspx|access-date=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abortion===

In some U.S. states, informed consent laws (sometimes called &quot;right to know&quot; laws) require that a woman seeking an elective [[abortion]] receive information from the abortion provider about her legal rights, alternatives to abortion (such as [[adoption]]), available public and private assistance, and other information specified in the law, before the abortion is performed. Other countries with such laws (e.g. [[Germany]]) require that the information giver be properly certified to make sure that no abortion is carried out for the financial gain of the abortion provider and to ensure that the decision to have an abortion is not swayed by any form of incentive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Taupitz |first1=Jochen |last2=Weschka |first2=Marion |date=2009 |title=CHIMBRIDS - Chimeras and Hybrids in Comparative European and International Research: Scientific, Ethical, Philosophical and Legal Aspects.

Some informed consent laws have been criticized for allegedly using &quot;loaded language in an apparently deliberate attempt to 'personify' the fetus,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gold, Rachel and Nash, Elizabeth.[http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/gpr/10/4/gpr100406.html State Abortion Counseling Policies and the Fundamental Principles of Informed Consent], Guttmacher Policy Review, Fall 2007, Volume 10, Number 4.&lt;/ref&gt; but those critics acknowledge that &quot;most of the information in the [legally mandated] materials about abortion comports with recent scientific findings and the principles of informed consent&quot;, although &quot;some content is either misleading or altogether incorrect.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Chinue and Nash, Elizabeth. [http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/gpr/09/4/gpr090406.html &quot;Misinformed Consent: The Medical Accuracy of State-Developed Abortion Counseling Materials&quot;], Guttmacher Policy Review
Fall 2006, Volume 9, Number 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children==

As children often lack the decision making ability or legal power (competence) to provide true informed consent for medical decisions, it often falls on parents or legal guardians to provide ''informed permission'' for medical decisions. This &quot;consent by proxy&quot; usually works reasonably well, but can lead to ethical dilemmas when the judgment of the parents or guardians and the medical professional differ with regard to what constitutes appropriate decisions &quot;in the best interest of the child&quot;. Children who are [[Emancipation of minors|legally emancipated]], and certain situations such as decisions regarding sexually transmitted diseases or pregnancy, or for unemancipated minors who are deemed to have medical decision making capacity, may be able to provide consent without the need for parental permission depending on the laws of the jurisdiction the child lives in. The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] encourages medical professionals also to seek the assent of older children and adolescents by providing age appropriate information to these children to help empower them in the decision making process.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAP&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Committee on Bioethics  | year = 1995 | title = Informed consent, parental permission, and assent in pediatric practice | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/95/2/314.full.pdf | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 95 | issue = 2| pages = 314–7 | pmid = 7838658 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on children has benefited society in many ways. The only effective way to establish normal patterns of growth and metabolism is to do research on infants and young children. When addressing the issue of informed consent with children, the primary response is parental consent. This is valid, although only legal guardians are able to consent for a child, not adult siblings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Annas, Glantz, Katz 1977 63–93&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Annas, Glantz, Katz|first=George, Leonard, Barbara|title=Informed Consent to Human Experimentation|year=1977|publisher=Ballinger Publishing Company|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-88410-147-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/informedconsentt0000anna/page/63 63–93]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/informedconsentt0000anna/page/63}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, parents may not order the termination of a treatment that is required to keep a child alive, even if they feel it is in the best interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Annas, Glantz, Katz 1977 63–93&quot;/&gt;  Guardians are typically involved in the consent of children, however a number of doctrines have developed that allow children to receive health treatments without parental consent. For example, emancipated minors may consent to medical treatment, and minors can also consent in an emergency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Annas, Glantz, Katz 1977 63–93&quot;/&gt;

==Research==
Informed consent is part of the ethical [[clinical research]] as well, in which a human subject voluntarily confirms his or her willingness to participate in a particular [[clinical trial]], after having been informed of all aspects of the trial that are relevant to the subject's decision to participate. Informed consent is documented by means of a written, signed, and dated informed consent form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ich.org/fileadmin/Public_Web_Site/ICH_Products/Guidelines/Efficacy/E6/E6_R1_Guideline.pdf |title=Guideline For Good Clinical Practice |access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[medical research]], the [[Nuremberg Code]] set a base international standard in 1947, which continued to develop, for example in response to the ethical violation in the [[Holocaust]]. Nowadays, medical research is overseen by an [[ethics committee]] that also oversees the informed consent process.

As the medical guidelines established in the Nuremberg Code were imported into the ethical guidelines for the [[social science]]s, informed consent became a common part of the research procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Homan |first=R. |year=1991 |title=The Ethics of Social Research |location=London; New York |publisher=Longman |isbn=978-0-582-05879-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while informed consent is the default in medical settings, it is not always required in the social science. Here, research often involves low or no risk for participants, unlike in many medical experiments. Second, the mere knowledge that they participate in a study can cause people to alter their behavior, as in the [[Hawthorne Effect]]: &quot;In the typical lab experiment, subjects enter an environment in which they are keenly aware that their behavior is being monitored, recorded, and subsequently scrutinized.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levitt |first1=S. D. |last2=List |first2=J. A. |year=2007 |title=What Do Laboratory Experiments Measuring Social Preferences Reveal about the Real World? |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=153–174 |doi= 10.1257/jep.21.2.153|jstor=30033722 |url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/fieldexperiments-papers2/papers/00480.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|168}}
In such cases, seeking informed consent directly interferes with the ability to conduct the research, because the very act of revealing that a study is being conducted is likely to alter the behavior studied. List exemplifies the potential dilemma that can result: &quot;if one were interested in exploring whether, and to what extent, race or gender influences the prices that buyers pay for used cars, it would be difficult to measure accurately the degree of discrimination among used car dealers who know that they are taking part in an experiment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=List |first1=J. A. |year=2008 |title=Informed Consent in Social Science |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=322 |issue=5902 |page=672 |doi=10.1126/science.322.5902.672a |pmid=18974330 |last2=List |first2=J. A. |citeseerx=10.1.1.418.1731 |s2cid=153720217 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases where such interference is likely, and after careful consideration, a researcher may forgo the informed consent process. This is commonly done after weighting the risk to study participants versus the benefit to society and whether participants are present in the study out of their own wish and treated fairly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levitt |first1=S. D. |last2=List |first2=J. A. |year=2009 |title=Field experiments in economics: The past, the present, and the future |journal=[[European Economic Review]] |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.1016/j.euroecorev.2008.12.001 |url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/fieldexperiments-papers2/papers/00079.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers often consult with an ethics committee or institutional review board to render a decision.

The birth of new online media, such as social media, has complicated the idea of informed consent. In an online environment people pay little attention to Terms of Use agreements and can subject themselves to research without thorough knowledge. This issue came to the public light following a study conducted by [[Facebook|Facebook Inc.]] in 2014, and published by that company and [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kramer|first1=Adam|last2=Guillory|first2=Jaime|last3=Jeffrey|first3=Hancock|title=Experimental evidence of massive-scale emotional contagion through social networks|journal=PNAS|date=2014|volume=111|issue=24|doi=10.1073/pnas.1320040111|pmid=24889601|pages=8788–90|pmc=4066473}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook conducted a study where they altered the Facebook News Feeds of roughly 700,000 users to reduce either the amount of positive or negative posts they saw for a week. The study then analyzed if the users status updates changed during the different conditions. The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The lack of informed consent led to outrage among many researchers and users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=LANIER|first1=Jaron|title=Should Facebook Manipulate Users?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/01/opinion/jaron-lanier-on-lack-of-transparency-in-facebook-study.html|website=The New York Times|access-date=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many believed that by potentially altering the mood of users by altering what posts they see, Facebook put at-risk individuals at higher dangers for depression and suicide. However, supports of Facebook claim that Facebook details that they have the right to use information for research in their terms of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boyd|first1=Danah|title=What does the Facebook experiment teach us?|url=http://socialmediacollective.org/2014/07/01/facebook-experiment/|website=Social Media Collective Research Blog|access-date=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others say the experiment is just a part of Facebook's current work, which alters News Feeds algorithms continually to keep people interested and coming back to the site. Others pointed out that this specific study is not along but that news organizations constantly try out different headlines using algorithms to elicit emotions and garner clicks or Facebook shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watts|first1=Duncan|title=Stop complaining about the Facebook study. It's a golden age for research|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/07/facebook-study-science-experiment-research|website=The Guardian|access-date=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They say this Facebook study is no different than things people already accept. Still, others say that Facebook broke the law when conducting the experiment on user that didn't give informed consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grimmelmann|first1=James|title=Illegal, Immoral, and Mood-Altering How Facebook and OkCupid Broke the Law When They Experimented on Users|url=https://medium.com/@JamesGrimmelmann/illegal-unethical-and-mood-altering-8b93af772688|website=Medium|access-date=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Facebook study controversy raises numerous questions about informed consent and the differences in the ethical review process between publicly and privately funded research. Some say Facebook was within its limits and others see the need for more informed consent and/or the establishment of in-house private review boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author-link1=Matthew J.

==Conflicts of interest==
Other, long-standing controversies underscore the role for [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]] among medical school faculty and researchers. For example, coverage of University of California (UC) medical school faculty members has included news of ongoing corporate payments to researchers and practitioners from companies that market and produce the very devices and treatments they recommend to patients.&lt;ref name=&quot;Petersen2014&quot;&gt;Petersen, Melody.

[[File:Papilio xuthus Larva 2011-10-15.jpg|thumb|250px|Larva of ''[[Papilio xuthus]]'', [[butterfly]]]]
A '''larva''' {{IPAc-en|'|l|ɑr|v|ə|}} (plural '''larvae''' {{IPAc-en|'|l|ɑr|v|iː|}}) is a distinct juvenile form many  [[animal]]s undergo before [[metamorphosis]] into [[adult]]s. Animals with indirect [[developmental biology|development]] such as [[insect]]s, [[amphibians]], or [[cnidarians]] typically have a larval phase of their [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]].

The larva's appearance is generally very different from the adult form (''e.g.'' [[caterpillar]]s and [[butterfly|butterflies]]) including different unique structures and organs that do not occur in the adult form. Their diet may also be considerably different.

Larvae are frequently adapted to environments separate from adults. For example, some larvae such as [[tadpoles]] live almost exclusively in aquatic environments, but can live outside water as adult [[frogs]]. By living in a distinct environment, larvae may be given shelter from predators and reduce competition for resources with the adult population.

Animals in the larval stage will consume food to fuel their transition into the adult form. In some organisms like [[Polychaete|polychaetes]] and [[barnacles]], adults are immobile but their larvae are mobile, and use their mobile larval form to distribute themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Qian|first=Pei-Yuan|title=Larval settlement of polychaetes|date=1999|work=Reproductive Strategies and Developmental Patterns in Annelids|pages=239–253|place=Dordrecht|publisher=Springer Netherlands|doi=10.1007/978-94-017-2887-4_14|isbn=978-90-481-5340-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Zhang-Fan|last2=Zhang|first2=Huoming|last3=Wang|first3=Hao|last4=Matsumura|first4=Kiyotaka|last5=Wong|first5=Yue Him|last6=Ravasi|first6=Timothy|last7=Qian|first7=Pei-Yuan|date=2014-02-13|title=Quantitative Proteomics Study of Larval Settlement in the Barnacle Balanus amphitrite|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=e88744|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0088744|pmid=24551147|issn=1932-6203|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some larvae are dependent on adults to feed them. In many eusocial [[Hymenoptera]] species, the larvae are fed by female workers. In ''[[Ropalidia marginata]]'' (a paper wasp) the males are also capable of feeding larvae but they are much less efficient, spending more time and getting less food to the larvae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sen|first1=R|last2=Gadagkar|first2=R|title=Males of the social wasp Ropalidia marginata can feed larvae, given an opportunity|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=2006|volume=71|issue=2|pages=345–350|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2005.04.022|s2cid=39848913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The larvae of some organisms (for example, some [[newt]]s) can become [[puberty|pubescent]] and do not develop further into the adult form. This is a type of [[neoteny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wakahara|first=Masami|date=1996|title=Heterochrony and Neotenic Salamanders: Possible Clues for Understanding the Animal Development and Evolution|journal=Zoological Science|volume=13|issue=6|pages=765–776|doi=10.2108/zsj.13.765|pmid=9107136|s2cid=35101681|issn=0289-0003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Eurosta solidaginis larva.jpg|thumb|''[[Eurosta]] solidaginis'' Goldenrod Gall Fly larva]]

It is a misunderstanding that the larval form always [[Recapitulation theory|reflects the group's evolutionary history]]. This could be the case, but often the larval stage has evolved secondarily, as in insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Nagy|first1=Lisa M.|title=Cell Lineages in Larval Development and Evolution of Holometabolous Insects|date=1999|work=The Origin and Evolution of Larval Forms|pages=275–300|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-12-730935-4|last2=Grbić|first2=Miodrag|doi=10.1016/b978-012730935-4/50010-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raff|first=Rudolf A|date=2008-01-11|title=Origins of the other metazoan body plans: the evolution of larval forms|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=363|issue=1496|pages=1473–1479|doi=10.1098/rstb.2007.2237|pmid=18192188|issn=0962-8436|pmc=2614227}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases the larval form may differ more than the adult form from the group's common origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Williamson |first1=Donald I. |author-link=Donald I.

==Insect larvae==
Within [[Insects]], only [[Endopterygota|Endopterygote]]s show complete metamorphosis, including a distinct larval stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Division: Endopterygota - Amateur Entomologists' Society (AES)|url=https://www.amentsoc.org/insects/fact-files/orders/endopterygota.html#:~:text=The%20word%20Endopterygota%20refers%20to,it%20reaches%20the%20last%20instar.|access-date=2020-08-03|website=www.amentsoc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef017 |title=Recognizing Insect Larval Types |publisher=University of Kentucky |access-date=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several classifications have been suggested by many [[Entomology|entomologists]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=JOHNSON, NORMAN. TRIPLEHORN, CHARLES A.|title=BORROR AND DELONG'S INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF INSECTS.|date=2020|publisher=CENGAGE LEARNING CUSTOM P|isbn=978-0-357-67127-6|oclc=1163940863}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Entomology|date=2008|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=978-1-4020-6242-1|editor-last=Capinera|editor-first=John L.|location=Dordrecht|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-6359-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and following classification is based on [[Antonio Berlese]] classification in 1913. There are four main types of endopterygote larvae types:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agriinfo.in/default.aspx?page=topic&amp;superid=6&amp;topicid=1552 |title=Types of Insect Larva |publisher=Agri info |access-date=28 April 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514042749/http://www.agriinfo.in/default.aspx?page=topic&amp;superid=6&amp;topicid=1552 |archive-date=14 May 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Apodous larvae''' – no legs at all and are poorly sclerotized. Based on [[Sclerotin|sclerotization]], three [[apodous]] forms are recognized.
#*Eucephalous – with well sclerotized head capsule. Found in [[Nematocera]], [[Buprestidae]] and [[Cerambycidae]] families.
#*Hemicephalus – with a reduced head capsule, retractable in to the thorax. Found in [[Tipulidae]] and [[Brachycera]] families. 
#*Acephalus – without head capsule. Found in [[Cyclorrhapha]]
#'''Protopod larvae''' – larva have many different forms and often unlike a normal insect form. They hatch from eggs which contains very little [[yolk]]. E.g. first [[instar]] larvae of parasitic hymenoptera.
#'''Polypod larvae''' – also known as '''eruciform larvae''', these larva have abdominal prolegs, in addition to usual thoracic legs. They poorly sclerotized and relatively inactive. They live in close contact with the food. Best example is [[caterpillar]]s of lepidopterans.
#'''Oligopod larvae''' – have well developed head capsule and mouthparts are similar to the adult, but without compound eyes. They have six legs. No abdominal prolegs. Two types can be seen:
#*Campodeiform – well sclerotized, dorso-ventrally flattened body. Usually long legged predators with [[Prognathism|prognathous]] mouthparts. (lacewing, trichopterans, mayflies and some coleopterans).
#*Scarabeiform – poorly sclerotized, flat thorax and abdomen. Usually short legged and inactive burrowing forms. ([[Scarabaeoidea]] and other coleopterans).

=== Colonies ===

In 1961, the Portuguese army was involved in armed action in its colony in Goa against an Indian invasion (see [[Operation Vijay (1961)|Operation Vijay]]). The operations resulted in a Portuguese defeat and the loss of the colonies in [[India]]. Independence movements also became active in [[Portuguese Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Guinea]]; the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] started. Some 122,000 Africans died in the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Clodfelter 2017: 561&lt;/ref&gt; Portugal, during this period, was never an outcast, and was a founding member of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA).

After the death of Salazar in 1970, his replacement by [[Marcelo Caetano]] offered a certain hope that the regime would open up, the ''primavera marcelista'' (Marcelist spring). However the colonial wars in Africa continued, [[political prisoner]]s remained incarcerated, freedom of association was not restored, [[censorship]] was only slightly eased and the [[election]]s remained tightly controlled.

The regime retained its characteristic traits: censorship, corporativeness, with a market economy dominated by a handful of economical groups, continuous surveillance and intimidation of several sectors of society through the use of a political police and techniques instilling fear (such as arbitrary imprisonment, systematic political persecution and even assassination of anti-regime insurgents).

===Politics===
{{Main|Processo Revolucionário Em Curso|Third Portuguese Republic}}
The &quot;[[Carnation Revolution]]&quot; of April 25, 1974, an effectively bloodless left-wing military coup, installed the &quot;Third Republic&quot;. Broad democratic reforms were implemented.

The ''[[Processo Revolucionário Em Curso]]'' (''Ongoing Revolutionary Process'') was the tumultuous period during the [[Portuguese transition to democracy]]. It started after a failed right-wing coup d'état on March 11, 1975, and ended after a [[Coup of 25 November 1975|failed left-wing coup d'état on November 25, 1975]]. This period was marked by political turmoil, violence, and instability, and the nationalization of industries. Portugal was polarized between the conservative north, with its many independent small farmers, and the radical south, where communists helped peasants seize control of large estates. Finally, in the [[1976 Portuguese legislative election|1976 legislative election]], the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]] came in first in elections and its leader [[Mário Soares]] formed Portugal's first democratically elected government in nearly a half century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tony Judt|title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=10oPnprPjcgC&amp;pg=PA515|year=2006|publisher=Penguin Books|pages=513–15|isbn=9780143037750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] and its center-right allies under Prime Minister [[Aníbal Cavaco Silva]] gained control of parliament in 1987 and 1991 while the Socialist Party and its allies succeeded in the 1991 presidential election to retain the presidency for its popular leader Mario Soares.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldey1992&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldey |first1=David B. |title=The Portuguese elections of 1987 and 1991 and the presidential election of 1991 |journal=Electoral Studies |date=June 1992 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=171–176 |doi=10.1016/0261-3794(92)90039-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Violent decolonisation ===
In 1975, Portugal granted independence to its [[Portuguese Empire|Overseas Provinces]] (''Províncias Ultramarinas'' in Portuguese) in Africa ([[Portuguese Mozambique]], [[Portuguese Angola]], [[Portuguese Guinea]], [[Portuguese Cape Verde]] and [[Portuguese São Tomé and Príncipe]]). Nearly 1 million Portuguese or persons of Portuguese descent left these former colonies as refugees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/portugal/48.htm Portugal – Emigration], Eric Solsten, ed. Portugal: A Country Study. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 [[Indonesia]] invaded and annexed the Portuguese province of [[Portuguese Timor]] ([[Timor Leste]]) in Asia before independence could be granted. The massive exodus of the Portuguese military and citizens from Angola and Mozambique, would prompt an era of chaos and severe destruction in those territories after independence from Portugal in 1975. From May 1974 to the end of the 1970s, over a million Portuguese citizens from Portugal's African territories (mostly from Portuguese Angola and Mozambique) left those territories as destitute refugees&amp;nbsp;– the ''retornados''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flight from Angola&quot;&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12079340 Flight from Angola], [[The Economist]] (August 16, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dismantling the Portuguese Empire&quot;&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913229-1,00.html Dismantling the Portuguese Empire], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' (Monday, July 7, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly independent countries were ravaged by brutal civil wars in the following decades—the [[Angolan Civil War]] (1975–2002) and [[Mozambican Civil War]] (1977–1992)—responsible for millions of deaths and refugees. The Asian dependency of [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]], after an agreement in 1986, was returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1999. Portugal applied international pressure to secure East Timor's independence from Indonesia, as East Timor was still legally a Portuguese dependency, and recognized as such by the [[United Nations]]. After a referendum in 1999, [[East Timor]] voted for independence, which Portugal recognized in 2002.

With the 1975–76 independence of its colonies (apart from Macau), the 560-year-old [[Portuguese Empire]] effectively ended. Simultaneously, 15 years of war effort also came to an end; many Portuguese returned from the colonies (the ''retornados'') and came to comprise a [[Demographics of Portugal#Vital statistics since 1900|sizeable proportion of the population]]: approximately 580,000 of Portugal's 9.8 million citizens in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6i_LwP-YW0oC&amp;q=retornados+population+of+portugal&amp;pg=PA86

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This opened new paths for the country's future just as others closed. In 1986, Portugal entered the [[European Economic Community]] and left the [[European Free Trade Association]] which had been founded by Portugal and its partners in 1960. The country joined the euro in 1999. The Portuguese Empire ended ''de facto'' in 1999 when Macau was returned to China, and ''de jure'' in 2002 when [[East Timor]] became independent.

Economic development was one of the major objectives of the Carnation Revolution and it was widely perceived that the new democracy would have the same unfortunate fate of the previous democratic regimes in Portugal ([[History of Portugal (1834–1910)|Constitutional Monarchy]] and [[Portuguese First Republic|First Republic]]) if, like them, it failed to provide economic development and decent standards of living to its citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oliveira&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://expresso.pt/blogues/opiniao_daniel_oliveira_antes_pelo_contrario/25-de-abril-4-d-de-desenvolvimento-onde-tudo-se-joga=f866925 |title=25 de abril (4): &quot;D&quot; de desenvolvimento, onde tudo se joga. |last=Oliveira |first=Daniel |date=25 April 2014 |publisher=Expresso |access-date=27 February 2019 |language=pt |trans-title=April 25 (4): The &quot;D&quot; of development, where all is at stake}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relative to Western Europe, Portugal remained stagnant (and thus poor and underveloped) for most of the ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'' regime (particularly in the first 30 years), but the modernization of the economy and development of the country still started in the last years of the regime, with a period of strong growth from 1961 to 1973. However, the gap between Portugal and most of Western Europe was still abysmal by the mid-1970s.

'''Li Peng''' ({{zh|s=李鹏|p=Lǐ Péng}}; 20 October 1928 – 22 July 2019) was a Chinese politician. Known as the &quot;Butcher of Beijing&quot; for his role in the [[Tiananmen Square protest|Tiananmen Square Massacre]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Hong Kong Free Press&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=HONG KONG POLITICS &amp; PROTEST 'Butcher of Beijing': Ex-Chinese premier Li Peng, who ordered Tiananmen Massacre, dies aged 91 |url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/07/23/breaking-former-chinese-premier-li-peng-dies-aged-91/ |accessdate=23 July 2019 |work=Hong Kong Free Press |agency=AFP |date=23 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Li Peng: former Chinese premier known as 'Butcher of Beijing' dies aged 90 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/23/former-chinese-premier-li-peng-butcher-of-beijing-dies-aged-90 |accessdate=23 July 2019 |work=Guardian |date=23 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Li served as the [[List of Premiers of the People's Republic of China|fourth Premier of the People's Republic of China]] from 1987 to 1998, and as the [[Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]], China's top legislative body, from 1998 to 2003. For much of the 1990s Li was ranked second in the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) hierarchy behind then Party General Secretary [[Jiang Zemin]]. He retained his seat on the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|CPC Politburo Standing Committee]] until his retirement in 2002.

Li was the son of an early Communist revolutionary, Li Shuoxun, who was executed by the [[Kuomintang]]. After meeting [[Zhou Enlai]] in [[Sichuan]], Li was raised by Zhou and his wife, [[Deng Yingchao]]. Li trained to be an engineer in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] and worked at an important national power company after returning to China. He escaped the political turmoil of the 1950s, '60s and '70s due to his political connections and his employment in the company. After [[Deng Xiaoping]] became China's leader in the late 1970s, Li took a number of increasingly important and powerful political positions, eventually becoming premier in 1987.

As Premier, Li was the most visible representative of [[Government of the People's Republic of China|China's government]] who backed the use of force to quell the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. During the protests Li used his authority as premier to declare [[martial law]] and, in cooperation with [[Deng Xiaoping]], who was the [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]], ordered the June 1989 military crackdown against student pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. Li advocated a largely conservative approach to [[Chinese economic reform]], which placed him at odds with General Secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]], who fell out of favour in 1989. After Zhao was removed from office Li promoted a conservative socialist economic agenda, but lost influence to incoming vice-premier [[Zhu Rongji]] and was unable to prevent the increasing free-market liberalization of the Chinese economy. During his time in office he helmed the controversial [[Three Gorges Dam]] project. He and his family managed a large Chinese power monopoly, which the Chinese government broke up after his term as premier expired. Li died at the age of 90 in Beijing.

==Childhood==
Li was born as '''Li Yuanpeng''' ({{zh|t=李遠芃|p=Lǐ Yuǎnpéng|labels=no}}) at Family house in [[Shanghai French Concession]], Now in 545 Yanan Road, Huangpu District in Shanghai, with ancestral roots in [[Chengdu]], [[Sichuan]] province.&lt;ref&gt;''Xinhuanet''&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the son of [[Li Shuoxun]], one of the earliest CPC revolutionaries,&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;&gt;''CNN.com''&lt;/ref&gt; who was the political commissar of the Twentieth Division during the [[Nanchang Uprising]], and Zhao Juntao, also an early Communist operative.&lt;ref name=&quot;BY126&quot;&gt;Barnouin and Yu 126&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, Li's father, then working undercover in [[Hainan]], was captured and executed by the Kuomintang.&lt;ref&gt;Fang and Fang 66&lt;/ref&gt; Li was believed to have met Deng Yingchao, wife of senior Communist leader [[Zhou Enlai]], in [[Chengdu]] in 1939, who then took him to [[Changchun]] to meet Zhou. Zhou was in the Communist base of [[Yan'an]], and they did not meet until late 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Li&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, when Li was twelve, Zhou sent Li to [[Yan'an]], where Li studied until 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;BY126&quot; /&gt; As a seventeen-year-old, in 1945, Li joined the Communist Party of China.&lt;ref name=&quot;MMW&quot;&gt;Mackerras, McMillen, and Watson 136&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Li Peng began studying at the Yan'an Institute of Natural Science (a predecessor of the [[Beijing Institute of Technology]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bartke 235&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1946, Li was sent to work in [[Zhangjiakou]]. According to his own recollection, in 1947, he journeyed through Shandong and North Korea, eventually ending up in Harbin where he began managing some work for a lard processing plant. In 1948, Li Peng was sent to study at the [[Moscow Power Engineering Institute]], majoring in [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] engineering. A year later, in 1949, Zhou Enlai became Premier of the newly declared People's Republic of China.&lt;ref name=&quot;BY126&quot; /&gt; Li graduated in 1954. During his time in the Soviet Union, Li was the head of the Chinese Students Association in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;MMW&quot; /&gt;

When Li returned to China in 1955, the country was firmly under the control of the Communist Party. Li took part in technical then management work in the power industry, beginning his career in Northeast China.  At the outset of the [[Cultural Revolution]], Li was sent to Beijing to head up the municipal power bureau.&lt;ref name=&quot;MMW&quot; /&gt;  He played a leading role in the construction of the Tuhe Powerplant in [[Tangshan]] and the Gaojing Powerplant in Beijing.&lt;ref name=&quot;dw22july&quot;&gt;{{cite news |script-title=zh:六四强硬派李鹏逝世 三大争议亟待盖棺论定 |url=http://news.dwnews.com/china/news/2019-07-23/60142364.html |work=Duowei |date=22 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time at Gaojing, he worked three days and three nights supervising the construction of the site. On 4 October 1974, he was struck by a vehicle while riding his bicycle home from work.&lt;ref name=&quot;dw22july&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot; /&gt; In 1976, Li was dispatched to affected regions of the [[Tangshan earthquake]] as head of the power restoration efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;dw22july&quot;/&gt;

Li advanced politically after the ascent of [[Deng Xiaoping]], and served as the Vice-Minister and Minister of Power between 1979 and 1983. In 1982–1983 Li served as the vice-minister of Water Conservancy and Power.&lt;ref name=&quot;MMW&quot; /&gt; Much of Li's rapid political promotion was due to the support of Party elder [[Chen Yun]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MMW2&quot; /&gt;

Li joined the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] at the Twelfth [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China|National Congress]] in 1982. In 1985 he was named minister of the State Education Commission, and was elected to the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]] and the Party Secretariat. In 1987 Li became a member of the powerful [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Standing Committee]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot; /&gt;

==Premiership==

===Defender of state control===
{{refsection|date=July 2019}}
In November 1987, after Premier [[Zhao Ziyang]] was promoted to [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]], Li became acting Premier. He was formally elected Premier in March 1988.  Within a year of this promotion, Li would play a major role in ending Zhao's career, after Zhao publicly supported demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. At the time of his promotion, Li seemed like an unusual choice for Premier because he did not seem to share Deng's enthusiasm for introducing market reforms.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot; /&gt; Li was raised to the position of Premier thanks partially to the departure of [[Hu Yaobang]], who was forced to resign as General Secretary after the Party blamed him for a series of student-led protests in 1987.

Throughout the 1980s, political dissent and social problems, including inflation, urban migration, and [[school overcrowding]], became great problems in China. Despite these acute challenges, Li shifted his focus away from the day-to-day concerns of energy, communications, and raw materials allocation, and took a more active role in the ongoing intra-party debate on the pace of market reforms. Politically, Li opposed the modern economic reforms pioneered by Zhao Ziyang throughout Zhao's years of public service.  While students and intellectuals urged greater reforms, some party elders increasingly feared that the instability opened up by any significant reforms would threaten to undermine the authority of the Communist Party, which Li had spent his career attempting to strengthen.

After Zhao became [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]], his proposals in May 1988 to expand free enterprise led to popular complaints (which some suggest were politically inspired) about inflation fears. Public fears about the negative effects of market reforms gave conservatives (including Li Peng) the opening to call for greater centralization of economic controls and stricter prohibitions against Western influences, especially opposing further expansion of Zhao's more free enterprise-oriented approach. This precipitated a political debate, which grew more heated through the winter of 1988–1989.

===Tiananmen Square===

{{Main|Tiananmen Square protests of 1989}}
The [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] began with the mass mourning over the death of former General secretary [[Hu Yaobang]], widely perceived to have been purged for his support of political liberalization.&lt;ref&gt;Pan 274&lt;/ref&gt; On the eve of Hu's funeral, 100,000 people gathered at Tiananmen Square.&lt;ref&gt;''Keesing's Record of World Events'' 36,587&lt;/ref&gt; Beijing students began the demonstrations to encourage continued economic reform and liberalization, and these demonstrations soon evolved into a mass movement for political reform.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan&lt;/ref&gt; From Tiananmen Square, the protesters later expanded into the surrounding streets. Non-violent protests also occurred in cities throughout China, including Shanghai and [[Wuhan]]. Rioting occurred in [[Xi'an]] and [[Changsha]].&lt;ref&gt;Becker 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=China's Upheaval: Five Weeks of Student Demonstrations |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/20/world/china-s-upheaval-five-weeks-of-student-demonstrations.html |accessdate=23 July 2019 |work=New York Times |agency=Associated Press |date=20 May 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tiananmen protests were partially protests against the affluence of the children of high-ranking Communist Party officials, and the perception that second-generation officials had received their fortunes through exploiting their parents' influence. Li, whose family has often been at the center of corruption allegations within the Chinese power industry, was vulnerable to these charges.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bezlova1&quot;&gt;Bezlova &quot;The Princeling and the Protesters&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[People's Daily editorial of April 26|editorial]] published in the ''[[People's Daily]]'' on 26 April and bearing the name of Deng Xiaoping, denounced the demonstrations as &quot;premeditated and organized turmoil with anti-Party and anti-socialist motives&quot;. This article had the effect of worsening the demonstrations by angering its leaders, who then made their demands more extreme. Zhao Ziyang later wrote in his autobiography that, although Deng had stated many of these sentiments in a private conversation with Li Peng shortly before the editorial was written, Li had these comments disseminated to Party members and published as the editorial without Deng's knowledge or consent.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao 10–12&lt;/ref&gt;

Li strictly refused to negotiate with the Tiananmen protesters out of principle, and became one of the officials most objected to by protesters.&lt;ref name=&quot;MMW2&quot;&gt;Mackerras, McMillen, and Watson 137&lt;/ref&gt; One of the protest's key leaders, [[Wu'erkaixi]], during a hunger strike, publicly scolded Li on National Television, saying he was ignoring the needs of the people. Some observers say that Wang's statements insulted Li personally, hardening his resolve to end the protest by violent means.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asianews&quot;/&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Among the other senior members of the central government, Li became the one who most strongly favored violence and known as the &quot;Butcher of Beijing&quot; for his role in the crackdown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hong Kong Free Press&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; After winning the support of most of his colleagues, apparently including Deng Xiaoping, Li officially declared martial law in Beijing on 20 May 1989 and the protests were [[People's Liberation Army at Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|crushed by the military]] on 3–4 June.  Most estimates of the dead range from several hundred to several thousand people. Li later described the crackdown as a historic victory for Communism,&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot; /&gt; and wrote that he feared the protests would be as potentially damaging to China as the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966–1976) had been.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asianews&quot;&gt;''Asia News.it''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political longevity===
[[File:Vladimir Putin with Li Peng-2.jpg|thumb|right|Li Peng with Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] in 2000]]
Although the Tiananmen crackdown was an &quot;international public relations disaster for China&quot;, it ensured that Li would have a long and productive career. He remained powerful, even though he had been one of the main targets of protesters, partially because the leadership believed that limiting Li's career would be the same as admitting that they had made mistakes by suppressing the 1989 protests. By keeping Li at the upper levels of the Party, China's leaders communicated to the world that the country remained stable and united.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot; /&gt;

In the immediate aftermath of the Tiananmen protests, Li took a leading role in a national austerity program, intended to slow economic growth and inflation and re-centralize the economy. Li worked to increase taxes on agriculture and export-industries, and increased salaries to less-efficient industries owned by the government.&lt;ref&gt;Pickunas&lt;/ref&gt; Li directed a tight monetary policy, implementing price controls on many commodities, supporting higher interest rates, and cutting off state loans to private and cooperative sectors in attempts to reduce inflation.

Li suffered a heart attack in 1993, and began to lose influence within the Party to vice-premier [[Zhu Rongji]], a strong advocate for economic liberalization. In that year, when Li made his annual work report to the Politburo, he was forced to make over seventy changes in order to make the plans acceptable to Deng.&lt;ref name=&quot;MMW2&quot; /&gt; Perhaps realizing that opposition to the market reforms would be poorly received by Deng and other Party elders, Li publicly supported Deng's economic reforms. Li was reappointed Premier in 1993, despite a large protest vote for Zhu. Zhu Rongji eventually succeeded Li when Li's second term expired, in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot; /&gt;

Li began two [[megaproject]]s when he was the Premier. He initiated the construction of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] on 14 December 1994, and later began preparations for the [[Shenzhou spacecraft|Shenzhou Manned Space Program]]. Both programs were subject to much controversy within China and abroad. The Shenzhou program was especially criticized due to its extraordinary cost (tens of billions of dollars). Many economists and humanitarians suggested that those billions in capital might be better invested in helping the Chinese population deal with economic hardships and improvement in the China's education, health services, and legal system.&lt;ref&gt;Wu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lan&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chairmanship of the National People's Congress==
Li remained premier until 1998, when he was constitutionally limited to two terms. After his second term expired, he became the chairman of the [[National People's Congress]]. Support for Li for the largely ceremonial position was low, as he only received less than 90% of the vote at the 1998 [[National People's Congress]], where he was the only candidate.&lt;ref&gt;''BBC News'' &quot;China's parliament embarrasses Li Peng&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He spent much of his time monitoring what he considered his life's work to have been, the [[Three Gorges Dam]]. Li's interest in the Dam reflected his earlier career as a hydraulic engineer, and he spent much of his career while in office presiding over a vast and growing power industry. At this time Li Peng considered himself to be a builder and a modernizer.

==Legacy and death==
After retiring in 2003, Li retained some influence in the Politburo Standing Committee. [[Luo Gan]], who presided over law enforcement and national security between 2002 and 2007, was considered Li's protégé.&lt;ref&gt;''Europa World Yearbook'' 1109&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China|17th Party Congress]], Li's influence waned considerably. He was subject to frequent speculation over corruption issues that plague him and his family. In addition, perhaps more than any other leader, Li's public image had become inextricably associated with memory of the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown, and as a result he continued to be a widely despised figure among a substantial segment of the Chinese population well into the 21st century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bezlova1&quot; /&gt; He was generally unpopular in China, where he (had) &quot;has long been a figure of scorn and suspicion&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot; /&gt;

Li spent much of the 1990s expanding and managing an energy monopoly, [[State Power Corporation of China]]. Because the company was staffed by Li's relatives, Li was accused of turning China's energy industry into a &quot;family fiefdom&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rosenthal |first1=Elisabeth |title=Li Peng Retires, but His Infamy for Tiananmen Massacre Endures |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/11/world/li-peng-retires-but-his-infamy-for-tiananmen-massacre-endures.html |work=The New York Times |date=11 March 2003 |quote=In recent years, he has also been accused of corruption and nepotism, particularly concerning the involvement of his wife and sons in state-owned power companies.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tale of Chinese Scandal Backfires on Magazine |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-jan-18-mn-23437-story.html |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=18 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its height, Li's power company controlled 72% of all energy-producing assets in China, and was ranked as the sixtieth-largest company in the world by ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine.

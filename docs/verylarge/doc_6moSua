The conversion electronics also present an opportunity to effectively manage the power grid by means of controlling the magnitude and direction of power flow. An additional advantage of the existence of HVDC links, therefore, is potential increased stability in the transmission grid.

A number of studies have highlighted the potential benefits of very wide area [[super grid]]s based on HVDC since they can mitigate the effects of intermittency by averaging and smoothing the outputs of large numbers of geographically dispersed wind farms or solar farms.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Czisch's study concludes that a grid covering the fringes of Europe could bring 100% renewable power (70% wind, 30% biomass) at close to today's prices. There has been debate over the technical feasibility of this proposal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claverton-energy.com/ttechnical-feasibility-of-complex-multi-terminal-hvdc-and-ideological-barriers-to-inter-country-exchanges.html Myth of technical un-feasibility of complex multi-terminal HVDC and ideological barriers to inter-country power exchanges – Czisch | Claverton Group].

The construction of such green power superhighways is advocated in a [[white paper]] that was released by the [[American Wind Energy Association]] and the [[Solar Energy Industries Association]] in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green Power Superhighways&quot;&gt;[http://www.awea.org/files/filedownloads/pdfs/greenpowersuperhighways.pdf Green Power Superhighways: Building a Path to America's Clean Energy Future] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420135613/http://www.awea.org/files/FileDownloads/pdfs/GreenPowerSuperhighways.pdf |date=2017-04-20 }}, February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clean Line Energy Partners]] is developing four HVDC lines in the U.S. for long distance electric power transmission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleanlineenergy.com/ HVDC Transmission Projects | Clean Line Energy Partners&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Note their fifth project is AC --&gt;

In January 2009, the European Commission proposed €300&amp;nbsp;million to subsidize the development of HVDC links between Ireland, Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, and Sweden, as part of a wider €1.2&amp;nbsp;billion package supporting links to offshore wind farms and cross-border interconnectors throughout Europe. Meanwhile, the recently founded [[Union of the Mediterranean]] has embraced a Mediterranean Solar Plan to import large amounts of concentrated solar power into Europe from North Africa and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claverton-energy.com/energy-experts-library/downloads/interconnectors David Strahan &quot;Green Grids&quot; New Scientist 12 March 2009 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advancements in UHVDC ==

UHVDC (ultrahigh-voltage direct-current) is shaping up to be the latest technological front in high voltage DC transmission technology.  UHVDC is defined as DC voltage transmission of above 800&amp;nbsp;kV (HVDC is generally just 100 to 800&amp;nbsp;kV).

One of the problems with current UHVDC supergrids is that – although less than AC transmission or DC transmission at lower voltages – they still suffer from power loss as the length is extended. A typical loss for 800 kV lines is 2.6% over 800&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.siemens.com/press/pool/de/events/2012/energy/2012-07-wismar/factsheet-hvdc-e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing the transmission voltage on such lines reduces the power loss, but until recently, the [[Interconnector|interconnectors]] required to bridge the segments were prohibitively expensive. However, with advances in manufacturing, it is becoming more and more feasible to build UHVDC lines.

In 2010, [[ABB Group]] built the world's first 800&amp;nbsp;kV UHVDC in China. The Zhundong–Wannan UHVDC line with 1100 kV, 3400&amp;nbsp;km length and 12 GW capacity was completed in 2018. As of 2020, at least thirteen [[Ultra-high-voltage electricity transmission in China|UHVDC transmission lines in China]] have been completed. 

While the majority of recent UHVDC technology deployment is in China, it has also been deployed in South America as well as other parts of Asia. In India, a 1830 km, 800 kV, 6 GW line between [[Raigarh]] and [[Pugalur]] is expected to be completed in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tdworld.com/overhead-transmission/article/20967567/india-to-build-longest-800kv-uhvdc-transmission-line&lt;/ref&gt; In Brazil, the [[Xingu-Estreito HVDC transmission line|Xingu-Estreito line]] over 2076 km with 800 kV and 4 GW was completed in 2017. As of 2020, no UHVDC line (≥ 800 kV) exists in Europe or North America.

Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation: according to [[Hans Eysenck]]: &quot;He tried to interest the leading professional mathematicians in his work, but failed for the most part. What he had to show them was too novel, too unfamiliar, and additionally presented in unusual ways; they could not be bothered&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Eysenck]] (1995). ''Genius'', p. 197. Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-48508-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking mathematicians who could better understand his work, in 1913 he began a [[postal service|postal]] partnership with the English mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], [[England]]. Recognizing Ramanujan's work as extraordinary, Hardy arranged for him to travel to Cambridge. In his notes, Hardy commented that Ramanujan had produced groundbreaking new [[theorem]]s, including some that &quot;defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hardy|first1=Godfrey Harold|year=1940|title=Ramanujan: Twelve Lectures on Subjects Suggested by His Life and Work|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=9|isbn=0-8218-2023-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some recently proven but highly advanced results.

During his short life, Ramanujan independently compiled nearly 3,900 results (mostly [[identity (mathematics)|identities]] and [[equation]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Ramanujan's Notebooks | volume = Part 5|last= Berndt|first=Bruce C.|date=12 December 1997 |publisher= Springer Science &amp; Business |isbn=978-0-38794941-3|page = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many were completely novel; his original and highly unconventional results, such as the [[Ramanujan prime]], the [[Ramanujan theta function]], [[partition (number theory)|partition]] formulae and [[mock theta function]]s, have opened entire new areas of work and inspired a vast amount of further research.&lt;ref name=ono&gt;{{cite journal |author-link = Ken Ono | last = Ono | first = Ken |date= June–July 2006 |title= Honoring a Gift from Kumbakonam|journal= [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]] |volume= 53 |issue= 6 |pages= 640–51 [649–50] |url= https://www.ams.org/notices/200606/fea-ono.pdf |accessdate= 23 June 2007 |url-status= live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621074858/https://www.ams.org/notices/200606/fea-ono.pdf |archivedate= 21 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all his claims have now been proven correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date= August 1999 |title= Rediscovering Ramanujan |journal= [[Frontline (magazine) |Frontline]] |volume= 16 |issue= 17 |page= 650 |url= https://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1617/16170810.htm |accessdate= 20 December 2012 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130925201456/http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1617/16170810.htm |archivedate= 25 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Ramanujan Journal]]'', a [[scientific journal]], was established to publish work in all areas of mathematics influenced by Ramanujan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Analytic and Elementary Number Theory: A Tribute to Mathematical Legend Paul Erdos| last1 = Alladi | first1 = Krishnaswami| last2 = Elliott | first2 = P.

As late as 2011 and again in 2012, researchers continued to discover that mere comments in his writings about &quot;simple properties&quot; and &quot;similar outputs&quot; for certain findings were themselves profound and subtle number theory results that remained unsuspected until nearly a century after his death.&lt;ref name= &quot;ono_simpleproperties&quot;&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20039-deep-meaning-in-ramanujans-simple-pattern/ Deep meaning in Ramanujan’s ‘simple’ pattern] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170803140127/https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20039-deep-meaning-in-ramanujans-simple-pattern/|date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ono_mock&quot;&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21628904-200-mathematical-proof-reveals-magic-of-ramanujans-genius/ &quot;Mathematical proof reveals magic of Ramanujan’s genius&quot;] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170709084351/https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21628904-200-mathematical-proof-reveals-magic-of-ramanujans-genius/|date=9 July 2017}}. ''[[New Scientist]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He became one of the youngest [[Fellow of the Royal Society |Fellows of the Royal Society]] and only the second Indian member, and the first Indian to be elected a [[Trinity College, Cambridge#Notable fellows and alumni|Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge]]. Of his original letters, Hardy stated that a single look was enough to show they could have been written only by a mathematician of the highest calibre, comparing Ramanujan to mathematical geniuses such as [[Euler]] and [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi|Jacobi]].

In 1919, ill health—now believed to have been hepatic [[amoebiasis]] (a complication from episodes of [[dysentery]] many years previously)—compelled Ramanujan's return to India, where he died in 1920 at the age of 32. His last letters to Hardy, written in January 1920, show that he was still continuing to produce new mathematical ideas and theorems. His &quot;[[Ramanujan's lost notebook|lost notebook]]&quot;, containing discoveries from the last year of his life, caused great excitement among mathematicians when it was rediscovered in 1976.

A deeply religious [[Hindu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Man Who Knew Infinity: A Life of the Genius Ramanujan| last = Kanigel | first = Robert|year=2016|publisher= Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn= 978-1-47676349-1|pages=30–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramanujan credited his substantial mathematical capacities to [[divinity]], and said the mathematical knowledge he displayed was revealed to him by his family goddess [[Namagiri Thayar]].  He once said, &quot;An equation for me has no meaning unless it expresses a thought of [[God in Hinduism|God]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kanigel | first = Robert | year = 1991 | title = The Man Who Knew Infinity | page = 7 | chapter = Prologue}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Ramanujan was a year and a half old, his mother gave birth to a son, Sadagopan, who died less than three months later. In December 1889 Ramanujan contracted [[smallpox]], but recovered, unlike the 4,000 others who died in a bad year in the Thanjavur district around this time. He moved with his mother to her parents' house in [[Kanchipuram]], near Madras (now [[Chennai]]). His mother gave birth to two more children, in 1891 and 1894, both of whom died before their first birthdays.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|12}}

On 1 October 1892 Ramanujan was enrolled at the local school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|13}} After his maternal grandfather lost his job as a court official in Kanchipuram,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|19}} Ramanujan and his mother moved back to [[Kumbakonam]] and he was enrolled in Kangayan Primary School.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|14}} When his paternal grandfather died, he was sent back to his maternal grandparents, then living in Madras. He did not like school in Madras, and tried to avoid attending. His family enlisted a local constable to make sure he attended school. Within six months, Ramanujan was back in Kumbakonam.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|14}}

Since Ramanujan's father was at work most of the day, his mother took care of the boy, and they had a close relationship. From her he learned about tradition and [[puranas]], to sing religious songs, to attend [[Puja (Hinduism)|pujas]] at the temple, and to maintain particular eating habits—all part of [[Brahmin]] culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|20}} At Kangayan Primary School Ramanujan performed well. Just before turning 10, in November 1897, he passed his primary examinations in English, [[Tamil language|Tamil]], geography and arithmetic with the best scores in the district.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|25}} That year Ramanujan entered [[Town Higher Secondary School]], where he encountered formal mathematics for the first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|25}}

A [[child prodigy]] by age 11, he had exhausted the mathematical knowledge of two college students who were lodgers at his home. He was later lent a book written by [[S. L. Loney]] on advanced trigonometry.&lt;ref name=&quot;berndt9&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Berndt|Rankin|2001|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Hardy | first=G.

H. Hardy]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He mastered this by the age of 13 while discovering sophisticated theorems on his own. By 14 he received merit certificates and academic awards that continued throughout his school career, and he assisted the school in the logistics of assigning its 1,200 students (each with differing needs) to its approximately 35 teachers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|27}} He completed mathematical exams in half the allotted time, and showed a familiarity with [[geometry]] and [[infinite series]]. Ramanujan was shown how to solve cubic equations in 1902; he developed his own method to solve the [[Quartic function|quartic]]. The following year he tried to solve the [[Quintic function|quintic]], not knowing that it [[Abel–Ruffini theorem|could not be solved by radicals.]]

In 1903, when he was 16, Ramanujan obtained from a friend a library copy of ''[[Synopsis of Pure Mathematics|A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics]]'', [[G. S.

When he graduated from Town Higher Secondary School in 1904, Ramanujan was awarded the K. Ranganatha Rao prize for mathematics by the school's headmaster, Krishnaswami Iyer. Iyer introduced Ramanujan as an outstanding student who deserved scores higher than the maximum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt; He received a scholarship to study at [[Government Arts College, Kumbakonam]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|28}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|45}} but was so intent on mathematics that he could not focus on any other subjects and failed most of them, losing his scholarship in the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|47}} In August 1905 Ramanujan ran away from home, heading towards [[Visakhapatnam]], and stayed in [[Rajahmundry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.thehindu.com/arts/history-and-culture/ramanujan-lost-and-found-a-1905-letter-from-the-hindu/article2745164.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Ramanujan lost and found: a 1905 letter from ''The Hindu'' | date=25 December 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; for about a month.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|47–48}} He later enrolled at [[Pachaiyappa's College]] in Madras.

In 1910, after a meeting between the 23-year-old Ramanujan and the founder of the [[Indian Mathematical Society]], [[V. Ramaswamy Aiyer]], Ramanujan began to get recognition in Madras's mathematical circles, leading to his inclusion as a researcher at the [[University of Madras]].&lt;ref name=&quot;krish&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krishnamurthy|first1=V.|title=Srinivasa Ramanujan – His life and his genius|url=https://www.krishnamurthys.com/profvk/VK2/Srinivasa_Ramanujan.html|website=www.krishnamurthys.com|publisher=(Expository address delivered on Sep.16, 1987 at Visvesvarayya Auditorium as part of the celebrations of Ramanujan Centenary by the IISC, Bangalore)|accessdate=7 September 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921182431/https://www.krishnamurthys.com/profvk/VK2/Srinivasa_Ramanujan.html|archivedate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adulthood in India==
On 14 July 1909, Ramanujan married Janaki (Janakiammal; 21 March 1899 – 13 April 1994),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = Live mint |url= https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/6vJOM00P1sGZgCxV7RIasI/The-seamstress-and-the-mathematician.html|title=The seamstress and the mathematician}}&lt;/ref&gt; a girl his mother had selected for him a year earlier and who was ten years old when they married.&lt;ref name= &quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|71}}&lt;ref name= &quot;History in adult human sexual behavior with children and adolescents in Western societies&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bullough|first1= V.L. | chapter = 2.

Janaki was from Rajendram, a village close to Marudur ([[Karur district]]) Railway Station. Ramanujan's father did not participate in the marriage ceremony.&lt;ref name=&quot;Janaki&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title= Ramanujan's wife: Janakiammal (Janaki)|url= https://www.imsc.res.in/~rao/ramanujan/newnow/janaki.pdf|publisher= Institute of Mathematical Sciences|place= Chennai|accessdate= 10 November 2012|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121224003120/https://www.imsc.res.in/~rao/ramanujan/newnow/janaki.pdf|archivedate= 24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As was common at that time, Janaki continued to stay at her maternal home for three years after marriage, till she reached puberty. In 1912, she and Ramanujan's mother joined Ramanujan in Madras.&lt;ref name= &quot;express&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1= Janardhanan |first1=Arun|title=A passage to infinity|url= https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/life-style/a-passage-to-infinity-the-untold-story-of-srinivasa-ramanujan/|accessdate=7 September 2016|newspaper=Indian Express|date=6 December 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905150332/https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/life-style/a-passage-to-infinity-the-untold-story-of-srinivasa-ramanujan/|archivedate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the marriage, Ramanujan developed a [[hydrocele testis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|72}} The condition could be treated with a routine surgical operation that would release the blocked fluid in the scrotal sac, but his family could not afford the operation. In January 1910, a doctor volunteered to do the surgery at no cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ramanujan|first=Srinivasa|editor = P. K. Srinivasan |title= Ramanujan Memorial Number: Letters and Reminiscences |year= 1968|publisher= Muthialpet High School |location=Madras| page=100|volume=1|nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his successful surgery, Ramanujan searched for a job. He stayed at a friend's house while he went from door to door around Madras looking for a clerical position. To make money, he tutored students at Presidency College who were preparing for their F.A. exam.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|73}}

In late 1910, Ramanujan was sick again. He feared for his health, and told his friend R. Radakrishna Iyer to &quot;hand [his notebooks] over to Professor Singaravelu Mudaliar [the mathematics professor at Pachaiyappa's College] or to the British professor Edward B. Ross, of the [[Madras Christian College]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|74–75}} After Ramanujan recovered and retrieved his notebooks from Iyer, he took a train from Kumbakonam to [[Viluppuram (city)|Villupuram]], a city under French control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ranganathan |first=Shiyali Ramamrita |authorlink=Shiyali Ramamrita Ranganathan |title=Ramanujan: The Man and the Mathematician |year=1967 |publisher=Asia Publishing House |location=Bombay |ref=harv |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OuTuAAAAMAAJ |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Srinivasan (1968), Vol. 1, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, Ramanujan moved with his wife and mother to a house in Saiva Muthaiah Mudali street, [[George Town, Chennai|George Town]], [[Madras]], where they lived for a few months.&lt;ref name=&quot;rao&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Rao, K.

===Pursuit of career in mathematics===
In 1910, Ramanujan met deputy collector [[V. Ramaswamy Aiyer]], who founded the Indian Mathematical Society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|77}} Wishing for a job at the revenue department where Aiyer worked, Ramanujan showed him his mathematics notebooks. As Aiyer later recalled:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I was struck by the extraordinary mathematical results contained in [the notebooks]. I had no mind to smother his genius by an appointment in the lowest rungs of the revenue department.&lt;ref&gt;Srinivasan (1968), Vol. 1, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Aiyer sent Ramanujan, with letters of introduction, to his mathematician friends in Madras.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|77}} Some of them looked at his work and gave him letters of introduction to [[R. Ramachandra Rao]], the district collector for [[Nellore]] and the secretary of the Indian Mathematical Society.&lt;ref&gt;Srinivasan (1968), Vol. 1, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neville |first=Eric Harold |date=January 1921 |title=The Late Srinivasa Ramanujan |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=106 |issue=2673 |pages=661–662 |doi=10.1038/106661b0 |bibcode = 1921Natur.106..661N|s2cid=4185656 |ref=harv |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1429646 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranganathan|1967|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rao was impressed by Ramanujan's research but doubted that it was his own work. Ramanujan mentioned a correspondence he had with Professor Saldhana, a notable [[Mumbai|Bombay]] mathematician, in which Saldhana expressed a lack of understanding of his work but concluded that he was not a fraud.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|80}} Ramanujan's friend C. V. Rajagopalachari tried to quell Rao's doubts about Ramanujan's academic integrity. Rao agreed to give him another chance, and listened as Ramanujan discussed [[elliptic integral]]s, [[Gaussian hypergeometric series|hypergeometric series]], and his theory of [[divergent series]], which Rao said ultimately convinced him of Ramanujan's brilliance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|80}} When Rao asked him what he wanted, Ramanujan replied that he needed work and financial support. Rao consented and sent him to Madras. He continued his research with Rao's financial aid. With Aiyer's help, Ramanujan had his work published in the ''Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|86}}

One of the first problems he posed in the journal was to find the value of:

: &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1+2\sqrt{1+3 \sqrt{1+\cdots}}}.&lt;/math&gt;

He waited for a solution to be offered in three issues, over six months, but failed to receive any. At the end, Ramanujan supplied the solution to the problem himself. On page 105 of his first notebook, he formulated an equation that could be used to solve the infinitely [[nested radical]]s problem.

: &lt;math&gt;x+n+a = \sqrt{ax+(n+a)^2 +x\sqrt{a(x+n)+(n+a)^2+(x+n) \sqrt{\cdots}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Using this equation, the answer to the question posed in the ''Journal'' was simply 3, obtained by setting {{math|1=''x'' = 2}}, {{math|1=''n'' = 1}}, and {{math|1=''a'' = 0}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|87}} Ramanujan wrote his first formal paper for the ''Journal'' on the properties of [[Bernoulli number]]s. One property he discovered was that the denominators {{OEIS|id=A027642}} of the fractions of Bernoulli numbers are always divisible by six. He also devised a method of calculating {{mvar|B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} based on previous Bernoulli numbers. One of these methods follows:

It will be observed that if ''n'' is even but not equal to zero,
# {{mvar|B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a fraction and the numerator of {{math|{{sfrac|''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''|''n''}}}} in its lowest terms is a prime number,
# the denominator of {{mvar|B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} contains each of the factors 2 and 3 once and only once,
# {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1){{sfrac|''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''|''n''}}}} is an integer and {{math|2(2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1)''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} consequently is an ''odd'' integer.

In his 17-page paper &quot;Some Properties of Bernoulli's Numbers&quot; (1911), Ramanujan gave three proofs, two corollaries and three conjectures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|91}} His writing initially had many flaws. As ''Journal'' editor M. T. Narayana Iyengar noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mr. Ramanujan's methods were so terse and novel and his presentation so lacking in clearness and precision, that the ordinary [mathematical reader], unaccustomed to such intellectual gymnastics, could hardly follow him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seshu Iyer |first=P. V. |date=June 1920 |title=The Late Mr. S. Ramanujan, B.A., F.R.S.|journal=Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society|volume=12 |issue=3 |page=83|ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ramanujan later wrote another paper and also continued to provide problems in the ''Journal''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neville293&quot;/&gt; In early 1912, he got a temporary job in the Madras [[Accountant General]]'s office, with a monthly salary of 20 rupees. He lasted only a few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Srinivasan (1968), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end of that assignment, he applied for a position under the Chief Accountant of the [[Chennai Port|Madras Port Trust]].

In a letter dated 9 February 1912, Ramanujan wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Sir,&lt;br&gt;
{{pad|2em}}I understand there is a clerkship vacant in your office, and I beg to apply for the same. I have passed the Matriculation Examination and studied up to the F.A. but was prevented from pursuing my studies further owing to several untoward circumstances. I have, however, been devoting all my time to Mathematics and developing the subject. I can say I am quite confident I can do justice to my work if I am appointed to the post. I therefore beg to request that you will be good enough to confer the appointment on me.&lt;ref&gt;Srinivasan (1968), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Attached to his application was a recommendation from [[E. W. Middlemast]], a mathematics professor at the [[Presidency College, Chennai|Presidency College]], who wrote that Ramanujan was &quot;a young man of quite exceptional capacity in Mathematics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Srinivasan (1968), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks after he applied, on 1 March, Ramanujan learned that he had been accepted as a Class III, Grade IV accounting clerk, making 30 rupees per month.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|96}} At his office Ramanujan easily and quickly completed the work he was given and spent his spare time doing mathematical research. Ramanujan's boss, [[Francis Spring|Sir Francis Spring]], and S. Narayana Iyer, a colleague who was also treasurer of the Indian Mathematical Society, encouraged Ramanujan in his mathematical pursuits.

===Contacting British mathematicians===
In the spring of 1913, Narayana Iyer, Ramachandra Rao and [[E. W. Middlemast]] tried to present Ramanujan's work to British mathematicians. [[Micaiah John Muller Hill|M. J. M. Hill]] of [[University College London]] commented that Ramanujan's papers were riddled with holes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|105}} He said that although Ramanujan had &quot;a taste for mathematics, and some ability&quot;, he lacked the necessary educational background and foundation to be accepted by mathematicians.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from M. J. M. Hill to a C. L. T. Griffith (a former student who sent the request to Hill on Ramanujan's behalf), 28 November 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hill did not offer to take Ramanujan on as a student, he gave thorough and serious professional advice on his work. With the help of friends, Ramanujan drafted letters to leading mathematicians at Cambridge University.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|106}}

The first two professors, [[H. F. Baker]] and [[E. W. Hobson]], returned Ramanujan's papers without comment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|170–171}} On 16 January 1913, Ramanujan wrote to [[G. H. Hardy]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFsuRxospbU  The letter that revealed Ramanujan's genius]&lt;/ref&gt; Coming from an unknown mathematician, the nine pages of mathematics made Hardy initially view Ramanujan's manuscripts as a possible fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Snow|first=C. P. |title= Variety of Men |year= 1966|publisher= [[Charles Scribner's Sons]] |location=New York| pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardy recognised some of Ramanujan's formulae but others &quot;seemed scarcely possible to believe&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hardy1920&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hardy |first=G. H.|authorlink=G. H. Hardy|date=June 1920 |title=Obituary, S.

: &lt;math&gt;
\int\limits_0^\infty \frac{1+\dfrac{x^2}{(b+1)^2}}{1+\dfrac{x^2}{a^2}} \times\frac{1+\dfrac{x^2}{(b+2)^2}}{1+\dfrac{x^2}{(a+1)^2}}\times\cdots\,dx
= \frac{\sqrt \pi}{2} \times\frac{\Gamma\left(a+\frac12\right) \Gamma(b+1) \Gamma(b-a+1)}{\Gamma(a)\Gamma\left(b+\frac12\right)\Gamma\left(b-a + \frac12 \right)}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Hardy was also impressed by some of Ramanujan's other work relating to infinite series:

: &lt;math&gt;1 - 5\left(\frac12\right)^3 + 9\left(\frac{1\times3}{2\times4}\right)^3 - 13\left(\frac{1\times3\times5}{2\times4\times6}\right)^3 + \cdots = \frac{2}{\pi}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;1 + 9\left(\frac14\right)^4 + 17\left(\frac{1\times5}{4\times8}\right)^4 + 25\left(\frac{1\times5\times9}{4\times8\times12}\right)^4 + \cdots = \frac{2\sqrt 2}{\sqrt\pi\,\Gamma^2\left(\frac34\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The first result had already been determined by [[Gustav Conrad Bauer|G. Bauer]] in 1859. The second was new to Hardy, and was derived from a class of functions called [[hypergeometric series]], which had first been researched by Euler and Gauss. Hardy found these results &quot;much more intriguing&quot; than Gauss's work on integrals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|167}} After seeing [[Rogers–Ramanujan continued fraction|Ramanujan's theorems on continued fractions]] on the last page of the manuscripts, Hardy said the theorems &quot;defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|168}} and that they &quot;must be true, because, if they were not true, no one would have the imagination to invent them&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|168}} Hardy asked a colleague, [[John Edensor Littlewood|J. E. Littlewood]], to take a look at the papers. Littlewood was amazed by Ramanujan's genius. After discussing the papers with Littlewood, Hardy concluded that the letters were &quot;certainly the most remarkable I have received&quot; and that Ramanujan was &quot;a mathematician of the highest quality, a man of altogether exceptional originality and power&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hardy1920&quot; /&gt;{{rp|494–495}} One colleague, [[Eric Harold Neville|E. H. Neville]], later remarked that &quot;not one [theorem] could have been set in the most advanced mathematical examination in the world&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neville293&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neville |first=Eric Harold |date=March 1942 |title=Srinivasa Ramanujan |journal=Nature|volume=149 |issue=3776 |pages=292–293 |doi=10.1038/149292a0 |bibcode = 1942Natur.149..292N|ref=harv |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 February 1913 Hardy wrote Ramanujan a letter expressing interest in his work, adding that it was &quot;essential that I should see proofs of some of your assertions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Letter, Hardy to Ramanujan, 8 February 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; Before his letter arrived in Madras during the third week of February, Hardy contacted the Indian Office to plan for Ramanujan's trip to Cambridge. Secretary Arthur Davies of the Advisory Committee for Indian Students met with Ramanujan to discuss the overseas trip.&lt;ref&gt;Letter, Ramanujan to Hardy, 22 January 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with his Brahmin upbringing, Ramanujan refused to leave his country to &quot;go to a foreign land&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|185}} Meanwhile, he sent Hardy a letter packed with theorems, writing, &quot;I have found a friend in you who views my labour sympathetically.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter, Ramanujan to Hardy, 27 February 1913, [[Cambridge University Library]].&lt;/ref&gt;

To supplement Hardy's endorsement, [[Gilbert Walker]], a former mathematical lecturer at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], looked at Ramanujan's work and expressed amazement, urging the young man to spend time at Cambridge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|175}} As a result of Walker's endorsement, B. Hanumantha Rao, a mathematics professor at an engineering college, invited Ramanujan's colleague Narayana Iyer to a meeting of the Board of Studies in Mathematics to discuss &quot;what we can do for S. Ramanujan&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ram|first=Suresh |title= Srinivasa Ramanujan |year= 1972|publisher= National Book Trust |location=New Delhi| page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board agreed to grant Ramanujan a monthly research scholarship of 75 rupees for the next two years at the [[University of Madras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranganathan|1967|pp=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was engaged as a research student, Ramanujan continued to submit papers to the ''Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.'' In one instance Iyer submitted some of Ramanujan's theorems on summation of series to the journal, adding, &quot;The following theorem is due to S. Ramanujan, the mathematics student of Madras University.&quot; Later in November, British Professor Edward B. Ross of [[Madras Christian College]], whom Ramanujan had met a few years before, stormed into his class one day with his eyes glowing, asking his students, &quot;Does Ramanujan know Polish?&quot; The reason was that in one paper, Ramanujan had anticipated the work of a Polish mathematician whose paper had just arrived in the day's mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranganathan|1967|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his quarterly papers Ramanujan drew up theorems to make definite integrals more easily solvable. Working off Giuliano Frullani's 1821 integral theorem, Ramanujan formulated generalisations that could be made to evaluate formerly unyielding integrals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|183}}

Hardy's correspondence with Ramanujan soured after Ramanujan refused to come to England. Hardy enlisted a colleague lecturing in Madras, E. H. Neville, to mentor and bring Ramanujan to England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|184}} Neville asked Ramanujan why he would not go to Cambridge. Ramanujan apparently had now accepted the proposal; Neville said, &quot;Ramanujan needed no converting&quot; and &quot;his parents' opposition had been withdrawn&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neville293&quot;/&gt; Apparently Ramanujan's mother had a vivid dream in which the family goddess, [[Namagiri Thayar|the deity of Namagiri]], commanded her &quot;to stand no longer between her son and the fulfilment of his life's purpose&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neville293&quot;/&gt; Ramanujan traveled to England by ship, leaving his wife to stay with his parents in India.

Ramanujan departed from Madras aboard the S.S. ''Nevasa'' on 17 March 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|196}} When he disembarked in London on 14 April, Neville was waiting for him with a car. Four days later, Neville took him to his house on Chesterton Road in Cambridge. Ramanujan immediately began his work with Littlewood and Hardy. After six weeks Ramanujan moved out of Neville's house and took up residence on Whewell's Court, a five-minute walk from Hardy's room.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanigel1991&quot; /&gt;{{rp|202}} [[G. H. Hardy|Hardy]] and [[J. E. Littlewood|Littlewood]] began to look at Ramanujan's notebooks. Hardy had already received 120 theorems from Ramanujan in the first two letters, but there were many more results and theorems in the notebooks. Hardy saw that some were wrong, others had already been discovered, and the rest were new breakthroughs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hardy |first=G. H. |title= Ramanujan|year= 1940 |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge| page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramanujan left a deep impression on Hardy and Littlewood. Littlewood commented, &quot;I can believe that he's at least a [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi|Jacobi]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Letter, Littlewood to Hardy, early March 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; while Hardy said he &quot;can compare him only with [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] or Jacobi.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hardy |first=G.

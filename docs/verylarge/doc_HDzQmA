In the late 1860s, Oakland was selected as the western terminal of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad|Transcontinental Railroad]].&lt;ref name=&quot;baker_city_growth&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Joseph Eugene Baker |title=Past and present of Alameda County, California |volume=1 |date=1914 |publisher=S.J.

It continued to grow in the 20th century with its busy port, [[shipyard]]s, and a thriving [[automotive industry|automobile manufacturing industry]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Oakland, California}}
{{Further|Timeline of Oakland, California}}

===Pre-incorporation===
The earliest known inhabitants were the Huchiun natives, who lived there for thousands of years. The Huchiun belonged to a linguistic grouping later called the [[Ohlone]] (a [[Miwok]] word meaning &quot;western people&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nativecc.com/OhloneTribalMap.html/ |title = Ohlone Tribal Regions Map |access-date=April 15, 2007 |last=Milliken |first=Randall |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070813110544/http://www.nativecc.com/OhloneTribalMap.html/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archive-date = August 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Oakland, they were concentrated around [[Lake Merritt]] and [[Temescal Creek (Northern California)|Temescal Creek]], a stream that enters the San Francisco Bay at [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]].

In 1772, the area that later became Oakland was colonized, along with the rest of California, by Spanish settlers for the King of Spain. In the early 19th century, the Spanish crown granted the East Bay area to [[Luis María Peralta]] for his [[Rancho San Antonio (Peralta)|Rancho San Antonio]]. The grant was confirmed by the successor Mexican republic upon its independence from Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oakland-california.co.tv/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411053608/http://oakland-california.co.tv/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 11, 2011 |title=Oakland-california.co.tv |publisher=Oakland-california.co.tv |access-date=April 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his death in 1842, Peralta divided his land among his four sons. Most of Oakland fell within the shares given to Antonio Maria and Vicente.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oaklandcaliforniarealestate.biz/History.asp |title=Oaklandcaliforniarealestate.biz |publisher=Oaklandcaliforniarealestate.biz |access-date=April 19, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324183040/http://www.oaklandcaliforniarealestate.biz/History.asp |archive-date=March 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The portion of the parcel that is now Oakland was called ''Encinar'' (misrendered at an early date and carried forward as &quot;encinal&quot;) —Spanish for &quot;oak grove&quot;—due to the large oak forest that covered the area, which eventually led to the city's name.&lt;ref name=&quot;ancestry1932&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~npmelton/oakhist.htm |title=Oakland's Early History, Edson F. Adams, 1932 |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com |access-date=November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Stanford University]] historian Albert Camarillo, the Peralta family struggled to keep their land after the incorporation of California into the United States after the [[Mexican–American War]]. Camarillo claims the family was the victim of targeted racial violence. He writes in ''Chicanos in California'', &quot;They lost everything when squatters cut down their fruit trees, killed their cattle, destroyed their buildings, and even fenced off the roads leading to the rancho. Especially insidious were the actions of attorney [[Horace Carpentier]], who tricked Vicente Peralta into signing a 'lease' which turned out to be a mortgage against the 19,000-acre rancho. The lands became Carpentier's when Peralta refused to repay the loan he believed was fraudulently incurred. The Peraltas had no choice but to abandon the homesite they had occupied for two generations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Camarillo |first1=Albert |title=Chicanos in California: A History of Mexican Americans in California |date=1979 |publisher=Boyd &amp; Fraser |isbn=978-0878351282 |page=16 |edition=1 |url=https://archive.org/details/chicanosincalifo00albe |access-date=29 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development of Chinatown ===

In 1851, three men—[[Horace Carpentier]], Edson Adams, and Andrew Moon—began developing what is now downtown Oakland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Port of Oakland: 1850–1934|url=http://www.waterfrontaction.org/learn/wpa_hist_%201-6.pdf|website=waterfrontaction.org|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1852, the Town of Oakland was incorporated by the state legislature.&lt;ref&gt;[https://clerk.assembly.ca.gov/sites/clerk.assembly.ca.gov/files/archive/Statutes/1852/1852.PDF#page=13 ''Statutes of California'', 1852, p.180]&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Oakland had 75-100 inhabitants, two hotels, a wharf, two warehouses, and only cattle trails. Two years later, on March 25, 1854, Oakland re-incorporated as the City of Oakland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://clerk.assembly.ca.gov/sites/clerk.assembly.ca.gov/files/archive/Statutes/1854/1854.PDF#page=17 ''Statutes of California'', 1854, pp.183-187]&lt;/ref&gt; Horace Carpentier was elected the first mayor, though a scandal ended his mayorship in less than a year.

The city and its environs quickly grew with the railroads, becoming a major rail terminal in the late 1860s and 1870s. In 1868, the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]] constructed the [[Oakland Long Wharf]] at Oakland Point, the site of today's [[Port of Oakland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kqed.org/news/11745239/how-have-a-bunch-of-19th-century-victorians-survived-in-downtown-oakland|title=How Old Oakland's Historic Buildings Survived Decay (and Demolition)|last=Levi|first=Ryan|date=2019-05-09|website=KQED|language=en-us|access-date=2019-05-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190510034123/https://www.kqed.org/news/11745239/how-have-a-bunch-of-19th-century-victorians-survived-in-downtown-oakland|archive-date=May 10, 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[horsecar]] and [[Cable car (railway)|cable car]] lines were constructed in Oakland during the latter half of the 19th century. The first electric [[streetcar]] set out from Oakland to [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] in 1891, and other lines were converted and added over the course of the 1890s. The various streetcar companies operating in Oakland were acquired by [[Francis &quot;Borax&quot; Smith]] and consolidated into what eventually became known as the [[Key System]], the predecessor of today's publicly owned [[AC Transit]].

==== Plague epidemic ====
Oakland was one of the worst affected cities in California that was impacted by the plague epidemic. [[Quarantine]] measures were set in place at the Oakland ports requiring the authorities at the port to inspect the arriving vessels for the presence of infected rats.&lt;ref name=&quot;QuarantineNYT&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=QUARANTINE ORDERED AGAINST BUBONIC RATS|date=1925|work=New York Times|id={{ProQuest|103474660}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quarantine authorities at these ports inspected over a thousand vessels per year for plague and yellow fever. By 1908, over 5,000 people were detained in quarantine.&lt;ref name=&quot;howcommercespread&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contagion : how commerce has spread disease|last=1964-|first=Harrison, Mark|date=2012|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300123579|location=New Haven|oclc=785865143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunters were sent to poison the affected areas in Oakland and shoot the squirrels, but the eradication work was limited in its range because the State Board of Health and the [[United States Public Health Service]] were only allotted about $60,000 a year to eradicate the disease. During this period Oakland did not have sufficient health facilities, so some of the infected patients were treated at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A piece of my mind : a new collection of essays from JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association|date=2000|publisher=AMA Press|others=Young, Roxanne K.|isbn=9781579470821|location=Chicago|oclc=48003418|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/pieceofmymindnew0000unse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The State Board of Health along with Oakland also advised physicians to promptly report any cases of infected patients.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Yet, in 1919 it still resulted in a small epidemic of [[Pneumonic plague]] which killed a dozen people in Oakland.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kellogg|first=W.

==== Incorporation ====

At the time of incorporation in 1852, Oakland had consisted of the territory that lay south of today's major intersection of San Pablo Avenue, Broadway, and Fourteenth Street. The city gradually annexed farmlands and settlements to the east and the north. Oakland's rise to industrial prominence, and its subsequent need for a seaport, led to the digging of a shipping and tidal channel in 1902. This resulted in the nearby town of [[Alameda, California|Alameda]] being made an island. In 1906, the city's population doubled with refugees made homeless after the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] and fire.

In 1908 lawyer, former miner and newspaper owner Homer Wood (1880–1976) suggested to his friend Frank Bilger of Blake and Bilger Rock Quarry and Paving Company that he organize a gathering to establish a [[Rotary Club]] east of the bay. On November 27, 1908 Homer took a ferry across the bay in a driving rainstorm and met for lunch with Frank and twenty three other businessmen at the Hotel Metropole at 13th and Jefferson. This gathering became the first meeting of the Tri-City Rotary Club, renamed in 1911 The Rotary Club of Oakland, the third Rotary Club in the world. This group established the tradition of weekly meetings, something most clubs worldwide follow today.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Linda Parker, ''The Rotary Club of Oakland, A Century of Service and Friendship'', Stories to Last. {{ISBN|978-0-615-57936-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, [[General Motors]] opened an automobile factory in [[Elmhurst, Oakland, California|East Oakland]] called [[Oakland Assembly]]. It produced [[Chevrolet]] cars and then [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] trucks until 1963, when it was moved to [[Fremont, California|Fremont]] in southern Alameda County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oaklandhistory.com/files/chev.html |title=Oakland History Room. 1917 promotional photograph of a day's output at the Chevrolet factory |publisher=Oaklandhistory.com |access-date=April 19, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323180032/http://www.oaklandhistory.com/files/chev.html |archive-date=March 23, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1916, the [[Fageol|Fageol Motor Company]] chose East Oakland for their first factory, manufacturing farming tractors from 1918 to 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lincolnhighwayassoc.org/ca/traveler/2001-09/highway_nostalgia.html |work=The Traveler: The Newsletter of the Lincoln Highway Association—California Chapter |issue=Fall 2001 |author=Wes Hammond. |title=Highway Nostalgia.

During World War II, the East Bay Area was home to many war-related industries. Oakland's [[Moore Dry Dock Company]] expanded its shipbuilding capabilities and built over 100 ships. Valued at $100&amp;nbsp;million in 1943, Oakland's canning industry was its second-most-valuable war contribution after shipbuilding. The largest canneries were in the Fruitvale District, and included the Josiah Lusk Canning Company, the Oakland Preserving Company (which started the Del Monte brand), and the California Packing Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.G.

President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] called on defense industries with government contracts to integrate their workforces and provide opportunities for all Americans. Tens of thousands of laborers came from around the country, especially poor whites and blacks from the Deep South: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas, as well as Missouri and Tennessee. [[Henry J. Kaiser]]'s representatives recruited [[sharecroppers]] and [[tenant farmers]] from rural areas to work in his shipyards. African Americans were part of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] by which five million persons left the South, mostly for the West, from 1940 to 1970. White migrants from the [[Jim Crow]] South carried their racial attitudes, causing tensions to rise among black and white workers competing for the better-paying jobs in the Bay Area. The racial harmony Oakland blacks had been accustomed to prior to the war evaporated.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/09/26/MNFUSA80E.DTL&amp;hw=Betty+Reid+Soskin&amp;sn=003&amp;sc=552 | title=WWII meant opportunity for many women, oppression for others | first=Carolyne | last=Zinko | date=September 26, 2007 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also migrating to the area during this time were many [[Mexican Americans]] from southwestern states such as [[New Mexico]], [[Texas]], and [[Colorado]]. Many worked for the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], at its major rail yard in West Oakland. Their young men encountered hostility and discrimination by Armed Forces personnel, and tensions broke out in &quot;[[zoot suit riots]]&quot; in downtown Oakland in 1943 in the wake of a major disturbance in Los Angeles that year.&lt;ref&gt;Ruben Llamas, ''Eye from the Edge: A Memoir of West Oakland, California''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, [[National City Lines]] (NCL), a General Motors [[holding company]], acquired 64% of [[Key System]] stock; during the next several years NCL engaged in the [[General Motors Streetcar Conspiracy|conspiratorial dissolution]] of Oakland's electric [[streetcar]] system.

Despite the major increases in the number and proportion of African Americans in the city, in 1966 only 16 of the city's 661 police officers were black. Tensions between the black community and the largely white police force were high, as expectations during the civil rights era increased to gain social justice and equality before the law. Police abuse of blacks was common.&lt;ref name=&quot;INSIDE THE PANTHER REVOLUTION p. 302&quot;&gt;''Inside the Panther Revolution'', Robyn Cean Spencer, Chapter 13, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;monthlyreview.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Students [[Huey Newton]] and [[Bobby Seale]] founded the [[Black Panther Party]] at [[Merritt College]] (then located at a former high school on Grove Street, now occupied by [[Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute]]), which emphasized black power, advocated armed self-defense against police brutality, and was involved in several incidents that ended in the deaths of police officers and other Black Panther members.

As in many other American cities during the 1980s, [[crack cocaine]] became a serious problem in Oakland. Drug dealing in general, and the dealing of crack cocaine in particular, resulted in elevated rates of violent crime, causing Oakland to consistently be listed as one of America's most crime-ridden cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Craig Reinarman|author2=Harry G.

The 6.9 {{M|w|link=y}} [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta earthquake]] occurred on October 17, 1989. The rupture was related to the San Andreas fault system and affected the entire San Francisco Bay Area with a maximum [[Mercalli intensity scale|Mercalli intensity]] of IX (''Violent''). Many structures in Oakland were badly damaged including the double-decker portion of Interstate 880 that collapsed. The eastern span of the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge]] also sustained damage and was closed to traffic for one month.

On October 20, 1991, a massive [[1991 Oakland firestorm|firestorm]] swept down from the [[Berkeley Hills|Berkeley]]/Oakland hills above the Caldecott Tunnel. Twenty-five people were killed, 150 people were injured, and nearly 4,000 homes destroyed. With the loss of life and an estimated economic loss of {{USD}}1.5&amp;nbsp;billion, this was the worst urban firestorm in American history, until 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated292&quot;&gt;''Catastrophe: The 100 Greatest Disasters of All Time'', Stephen J.

'''AviaBellanca Aircraft Corporation''' is an [[United States|American]] [[aircraft]] design and manufacturing company. Prior to 1983, it was known as the '''Bellanca Aircraft Company'''. The company was founded in 1927 by [[Giuseppe Mario Bellanca]], although it was preceded by previous businesses and partnerships in which aircraft with the Bellanca name were produced, including Wright-Bellanca, in which he was in partnership with [[Wright Aeronautical]].

==History==
After Giuseppe Mario Bellanca, the designer and builder of Italy's first aircraft, came to the United States in 1911, he began to design aircraft for a number of firms, including the [[Maryland Pressed Steel Company]], [[Wright Aeronautical|Wright Aeronautical Corporation]] and the [[Columbia Aircraft Corporation]]. Bellanca founded his own company, Bellanca Aircraft Corporation of America, in 1927, sited first in Richmond Hill, New York and moving in 1928 to New Castle (Wilmington), Delaware. In the 1920s and 1930s, Bellanca's aircraft of his own design were known for their efficiency and low operating cost, gaining fame for world record endurance and distance flights. [[Charles Lindbergh|Lindbergh]]'s first choice for his New York to Paris flight was a [[Bellanca WB-2]]. The company's insistence on selecting the crew drove Lindbergh to [[Ryan Aeronautical Company|Ryan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mondey p. 96&quot;&gt;Mondey 1978, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellanca remained President and Chairman of the Board from the corporation's inception on the last day of 1927 until he sold the company to L. Albert and Sons in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://airandspace.si.edu/research/arch/findaids/bellanca/gmb_sec_1.html |title=The Giuseppe M. Bellanca Collection|date=|publisher=National Air and Space Museum, Archives Division|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that time on, the Bellanca line was part of a succession of companies that maintained the lineage of the original aircraft produced by Bellanca.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer 2001, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:I piedi del quo vadis.jpg|thumb|250px|Footprints in marble, said to be those of Jesus Christ, preserved in the Church of Domine Quo Vadis.]]

'''Santa Maria in Palmis''' ({{lang-it|Chiesa di Santa Maria delle Piante}}, {{lang-la|Sanctae Mariae in Palmis}}), also known as '''Chiesa del Domine Quo Vadis''', is a small [[Church (building)|church]] southeast of [[Rome]], central [[Italy]]. It is located about some 800&amp;nbsp;m from [[Porta San Sebastiano]], where the [[Via Ardeatina]] branches off the [[Appian Way]], on the site where, according to the [[New Testament apocrypha|apocryphal]] ''[[Acts of Peter]]'', [[Saint Peter]] met [[Jesus]] while the former was fleeing persecution in Rome. According to the legend, Peter asked Jesus, &quot;Lord, where are you going?&quot; ({{lang-la|Domine, quo vadis?}}). Jesus answered, &quot;I am going to Rome to be crucified again&quot; ({{lang-la|Eo Romam iterum crucifigi}}).

== History ==
There has been a sanctuary on the spot since the ninth century, but the current church is from 1637. The current façade was added in the 17th century.

It has been supposed that the sanctuary might have been even more ancient, perhaps a Christian adaptation of some already existing [[temple]]: the church is in fact located just in front of the sacred ''campus'' dedicated to [[Rediculus]], the Roman &quot;God of the Return&quot;. This ''campus'' hosted a sanctuary for the cult of the deity that received devotion by travellers before their departure, especially by those who were going to face long and dangerous journeys to far places like [[Egypt]], [[Greece]] or the East. Those travellers who returned also stopped to thank the god for the happy outcome of their journey.

The presence of the Apostle Peter in this area, where he is supposed to have lived, appears to be confirmed in an [[epigraphy|epigraph]] in the [[Catacombs of Rome#Catacombs of San Sebastiano|Catacombs of Saint Sebastian]] that reads ''Domus Petri'' ({{lang-en|House of Peter}}). An [[epigram]] by [[Pope Damasus I]] (366–384) in honor of Peter and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] reads: &quot;You that are looking for the names of Peter and Paul, you must know that the saints have lived here.&quot;

The two footprints on a marble slab at the center of the church — nowadays a copy of the original, which is kept in the nearby [[San Sebastiano fuori le mura|Basilica of San Sebastiano fuori le mura]] — are popularly held to be a miraculous sign left by Jesus. It is to these footprints that the official name of the church alludes: ''palmis'' refers to the soles of Jesus' feet. It is likely that these footprints are actually the draft of an ancient Roman &quot;[[ex voto]]&quot;, a tribute paid to the gods for the good outcome of a journey.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

There was an inscription above the front door on the church's façade which used to say: &quot;Stop your walking, traveller, and enter this sacred temple in which you will find the footprint of our Lord Jesus Christ when He met with St. Peter who escaped from the prison. An alms for the wax and the oil is recommended in order to free some spirits from [[Purgatory]].&quot; [[Pope Gregory XVI]] found the advertising tone of this inscription so inappropriate that he ordered its removal in 1845.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

There is also a modern column with a bust of [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]], the Polish author of the famous historical fiction novel ''[[Quo Vadis (novel)|Quo Vadis: A Narrative of the Time of Nero]]'' (1886). It is said that Sienkiewicz was inspired to write his novel while sitting in this church.

The church is currently administered by priests of the [[Congregation of Saint Michael the Archangel]].

[[Heavy metals]] are found naturally in the earth. They become concentrated as a result of human caused activities and can enter plant, animal, and human tissues via inhalation, diet, and manual handling. Then, they can bind to and interfere with the functioning of vital cellular components. The toxic effects of arsenic, mercury, and lead were known to the ancients, but methodical studies of the toxicity of some heavy metals appear to date from only 1868. In humans, heavy metal poisoning is generally treated by the administration of [[chelation|chelating agents]]. Some elements otherwise regarded as toxic heavy metals are essential, in small quantities, for human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pourret|first=Olivier|date=August 2018|title=On the Necessity of Banning the Term &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; from the Scientific Literature|journal=Sustainability|volume=10|issue=8|pages=2879|doi=10.3390/su10082879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy metals are found naturally in the earth, and become concentrated as a result of human activities, or, in some cases geochemical processes, such as accumulation in peat soils that are then released when drained for agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Qureshi |first1=Shabnam |last2=Richards |first2=Brian K. |last3=McBride |first3=Murray B. |last4=Baveye |first4=Philippe |last5=Steenhuis |first5=Tammo S. |title=Temperature and Microbial Activity Effects on Trace Element Leaching from Metalliferous Peats |journal=Journal of Environmental Quality |date=2003 |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=2067–75 |doi=10.2134/jeq2003.2067|pmid=14674528 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Common sources are mining and industrial wastes; vehicle emissions; [[Lead–acid battery|lead-acid batteries]]; fertilisers; paints; treated woods; aging water supply infrastructure;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harvey|Harvey, Handley &amp; Taylor 2015]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[microplastics]] floating in the world's oceans.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Howell|Howell et al. 2012]]; [[#Cole|Cole et al. 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;2589‒2590]]&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenic, cadmium and lead may be present in children's toys at levels that exceed regulatory standards. Lead can be used in toys as a [[stabilizer (chemistry)|stabilizer]], color enhancer, or anti-corrosive agent. Cadmium is sometimes employed as a stabilizer, or to increase the mass and luster of toy jewelry. Arsenic is thought to be used in connection with coloring dyes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Finch|Finch, Hillyer &amp; Leopold 2015, pp.&amp;nbsp;849–850]]&lt;/ref&gt; Regular imbibers of [[Moonshine|illegally distilled alcohol]] may be exposed to arsenic or lead poisoning the source of which is arsenic-contaminated lead used to [[solder]] the distilling apparatus.

Lead is the most prevalent heavy metal contaminant.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Di Maio|Di Maio 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;527]]&lt;/ref&gt; As a component of [[tetraethyl lead]], {{chem|(CH|3|CH|2|)|4|Pb}}, it was used extensively in [[gasoline]] during the 1930s–1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lovei|Lovei 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;15]]&lt;/ref&gt; Lead levels in the aquatic environments of industrialised societies have been estimated to be two to three times those of pre-industrial levels.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Perry|Perry &amp; Vanderklein 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;336]]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the use of leaded gasoline was largely phased out in North America by 1996, soils next to roads built before this time retain high lead concentrations. Lead (from [[lead(II) azide]] or [[lead styphnate]] used in firearms) gradually accumulates at firearms training grounds, contaminating the local environment and exposing range employees to a risk of [[lead poisoning]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Houlton|Houlton 2014, p.&amp;nbsp;50]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Entry routes ==

Heavy metals enter plant, animal and human tissues via air inhalation, diet, and manual handling. Motor vehicle emissions are a major source of airborne contaminants including arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, nickel, lead, antimony, vanadium, zinc, platinum, palladium and rhodium.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bala|Balasubramanian, He &amp; Wang 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;476]]&lt;/ref&gt; Water sources (groundwater, lakes, streams and rivers) can be polluted by heavy metals leaching from industrial and consumer waste; [[acid rain]] can exacerbate this process by releasing heavy metals trapped in soils.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wors|Worsztynowicz &amp; Mill 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;361]]&lt;/ref&gt; Transport through soil can be facilitated by the presence of preferential flow paths (macropores) and dissolved organic compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Camobreco |first1=Vincent J. |last2=Richards |first2=Brian K. |last3=Steenhuis |first3=Tammo S. |last4=Peverly |first4=John H. |last5=McBride |first5=Murray B. |title=Movement of heavy metals through undisturbed and homogenized soil columns |journal=Soil Science |date=November 1996 |volume=161 |issue=11 |pages=740–750 |doi=10.1097/00010694-199611000-00003|bibcode=1996SoilS.161..740C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants are exposed to heavy metals through the uptake of water; animals eat these plants; ingestion of plant- and animal-based foods are the largest sources of heavy metals in humans.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Radojevic|Radojevic &amp; Bashkin 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;406]]&lt;/ref&gt; Absorption through skin contact, for example from contact with soil, or metal containing toys and jewelry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guney|first1=Mert|last2=Zagury|first2=Gerald J.|title=Bioaccessibility of As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Sb in Toys and Low-Cost Jewelry|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|date=4 January 2014|volume=48|issue=2|pages=1238–1246|doi=10.1021/es4036122|pmid=24345102|bibcode=2014EnST...48.1238G}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; is another potential source of heavy metal contamination.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Qu|Qu et al. 2014, p.&amp;nbsp;144]]&lt;/ref&gt; Toxic heavy metals can [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] in organisms as they are hard to [[Metabolism|metabolize]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pezzarossa|Pezzarossa, Gorini &amp; Petruzelli 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;94]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Detrimental effects ==

Heavy metals &quot;can bind to vital cellular components, such as [[Protein#Structural proteins|structural proteins]], [[enzymes]], and [[nucleic acid]]s, and interfere with their functioning&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Landis|Lanids, Sofield &amp; Yu 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;269]]&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms and effects can vary according to the metal or metal compound, and the dose involved. Broadly, long-term exposure to toxic heavy metals can have carcinogenic, central and peripheral nervous system, and circulatory effects. For humans, typical presentations associated with exposure to any of the &quot;classical&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nielen|Neilen &amp; Marvin 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;10]]&lt;/ref&gt; toxic heavy metals, or chromium (another toxic heavy metal) or arsenic (a metalloid), are shown in the table.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Afal|Afal &amp; Wiener 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The toxic effects of arsenic, mercury and lead were known to the ancients but methodical studies of the overall toxicity of heavy metals appear to date from only 1868. In that year, Wanklyn and Chapman speculated on the adverse effects of the heavy metals &quot;arsenic, lead, copper, zinc, [[iron]] and [[manganese]]&quot; in [[drinking water]]. They noted an &quot;absence of investigation&quot; and were reduced to &quot;the necessity of pleading for the collection of data&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wanklyn|Wanklyn &amp; Chapman 1868, pp.&amp;nbsp;73–8]]; [[#Cameron|Cameron 1871, p.&amp;nbsp;484]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884, Blake described an apparent connection between toxicity and the atomic weight of an element.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Blake|Blake 1884]]&lt;/ref&gt; The following sections provide historical thumbnails for the &quot;classical&quot; toxic heavy metals (arsenic, mercury and lead) and some more recent examples (chromium and cadmium).

=== Arsenic ===

[[Arsenic]], as [[realgar]] ({{chem|As|4|S|4}}) and [[orpiment]] ({{chem|As|2|S|3}}), was known in ancient times. [[Strabo]] (64–50 BCE – c. AD 24?), a Greek geographer and historian,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dueck|Dueck 2000, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–3, 46, 53]]&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that only slaves were employed in realgar and orpiment mines since they would inevitably die from the toxic effects of the fumes given off from the ores. Arsenic-contaminated beer poisoned over 6,000 people in the Manchester area of England in 1900, and is thought to have killed at least 70 victims.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dyer|Dyer 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clare Luce]], American ambassador to Italy from 1953 to 1956, suffered from [[arsenic poisoning]]. Its source was traced to flaking arsenic-laden paint on the ceiling of her bedroom. She may also have eaten food contaminated by arsenic in flaking ceiling paint in the embassy dining room.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whorton|Whorton 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;356]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arsenic contamination of groundwater|Ground water contaminated by arsenic]], as of 2014, &quot;is still poisoning millions of people in Asia&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Notman|Notman 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mercury ===

{{see also|Mercury in fish}}

The first emperor of unified China, [[Qin Shi Huang]], it is reported, died of ingesting [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] pills that were intended to give him eternal life.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Zhao|Zhao, Zhu &amp; Sui 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase &quot;mad as a hatter&quot; is likely a reference to [[mercury poisoning]] among [[milliner]]s (so-called &quot;[[mad hatter disease]]&quot;), as mercury-based compounds were once used in the manufacture of felt hats in the 18th and 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Waldron|Waldron 1983]]&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, gold amalgam (an alloy with mercury) was widely used in [[gilding]], leading to numerous casualties among the workers. It is estimated that during the construction of [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] alone, 60 workers died from the gilding of the main dome.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Emsley|Emsely 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;326]]&lt;/ref&gt; Outbreaks of [[methylmercury]] poisoning occurred in several places in Japan during the 1950s due to industrial discharges of mercury into rivers and coastal waters. The best-known instances were in [[Minamata]] and [[Niigata Prefecture|Niigata]]. In Minamata alone, more than 600 people died due to what became known as [[Minamata disease]]. More than 21,000 people filed claims with the Japanese government, of which almost 3000 became certified as having the disease. In 22 documented cases, pregnant women who consumed contaminated fish showed mild or no symptoms but gave birth to infants with severe developmental disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Davidson|Davidson, Myers &amp; Weiss 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;1025]]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[industrial Revolution]], mercury levels have tripled in many near-surface [[seawater]]s, especially around [[Iceland]] and [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#NS2014|New Scientist August 2014, p. 4]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dutch boy collier white lead.png|thumb|left|upright|Dutch Boy [[white lead]] paint advertisement, 1912.]]

=== Lead ===

The adverse effects of [[lead]] were known to the ancients. In the 2nd century BC the Greek botanist [[Nicander]] described the [[colic]] and [[paralysis]] seen in lead-poisoned people.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pearce|Pearce 2007]]; [[#Needleman|Needleman 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pedanius Dioscorides|Dioscorides]], a Greek [[physician]] who is thought to have lived in the 1st century CE,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rogers|Rogers 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;41]]&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that lead &quot;makes the mind give way&quot;. Lead was used extensively in [[Roman aqueducts]] from about 500 BC to 300 AD.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gilbert|Gilbert &amp; Weiss 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Caesar]]'s engineer, [[Vitruvius]], reported, &quot;water is much more wholesome from earthenware pipes than from lead pipes. For it seems to be made injurious by lead, because [[white lead]] is produced by it, and this is said to be harmful to the human body.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Prioreschi|Prioreschi 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;279]]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Mongol]] period in China (1271−1368 AD), lead pollution due to silver smelting in the [[Yunnan]] region exceeded contamination levels from modern mining activities by nearly four times.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hillman|Hillman et al. 2015, pp.&amp;nbsp;3353–3354]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Up to one-sixth of China's arable land might be affected by heavy metal contamination.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hillman|Hillman et al. 2015, p.&amp;nbsp;3349]]&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} In the 17th and 18th centuries, people in [[Devon]] were afflicted by a condition referred to as [[Devon colic]]; this was discovered to be due to the imbibing of [[lead poisoning|lead-contaminated]] [[cider]]. In 2013, the [[World Health Organization]] estimated that lead poisoning resulted in 143,000 deaths, and &quot;contribute[d] to 600,000 new cases of children with intellectual disabilities&quot;, each year.&lt;ref&gt;[[#WHO|World Health Organization 2013]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. city of [[Flint, Michigan]], lead contamination in drinking water has been [[Flint water crisis|an issue since 2014]]. The source of the contamination has been attributed to &quot;corrosion in the lead and iron [[lead service line|pipes that distribute water]] to city residents&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Torrice|Torrice 2016]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the lead concentration of drinking water in north-eastern [[Tasmania]], Australia, reached a level over 50 times the prescribed national drinking water guidelines. The source of the contamination was attributed to &quot;a combination of dilapidated drinking water infrastructure, including lead jointed pipelines, end-of-life polyvinyl chloride pipes and household plumbing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harvey|Harvey, Handley &amp; Taylor 2015]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chromium ===
[[File:Potassium-chromate-sample.jpg|thumb|right|[[Potassium chromate]], a [[carcinogen]], is used in the dyeing of fabrics, and as a [[Tanning (leather)|tanning agent]] to produce [[leather]].]]

[[Chromium(III)]] compounds and [[chromium]] metal are not considered a health hazard, while the toxicity and carcinogenic properties of [[chromium(VI)]] have been known since at least the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Barcelous|Barceloux &amp; Barceloux 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, Newman described the elevated cancer risk of workers in a [[Chromate ion|chromate]] dye company.&lt;ref&gt;[[#NewmanD|Newman 1890]]&lt;/ref&gt; Chromate-induced dermatitis was reported in aircraft workers during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Haines|Haines &amp; Nieboer 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;504]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, an outbreak of dermatitis, ranging from [[erythema]] to exudative [[eczema]], occurred amongst 60 automobile factory workers in England. The workers had been wet-sanding chromate-based primer paint that had been applied to car bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#National|National Research Council 1974, p.&amp;nbsp;68]]&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, chromium was released from the [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] [[Orica]] explosives plant on August 8, 2011. Up to 20 workers at the plant were exposed as were 70 nearby homes in [[Stockton, New South Wales|Stockton]]. The town was only notified three days after the release and the accident sparked a major public controversy, with Orica criticised for playing down the extent and possible risks of the leak, and the state Government attacked for their slow response to the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tovey|Tovey 2011]]; [[#Jones|Jones 2011]]; [[#OB|O'Brien &amp; Aston]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cadmium-crystal bar.jpg|thumb|left|99.999% purity cadmium bar and 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; cube.]]

=== Cadmium ===

[[Cadmium]] exposure is a phenomenon of the early 20th century, and onwards. In Japan in 1910, the [[Mitsui Mining and Smelting Company]] began discharging cadmium into the Jinzugawa river, as a byproduct of mining operations. Residents in the surrounding area subsequently consumed rice grown in cadmium-contaminated irrigation water. They experienced softening of the bones and kidney failure. The origin of these symptoms was not clear; possibilities raised at the time included &quot;a regional or bacterial disease or lead poisoning&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Vallero|Vallero &amp; Letcher 2013, p.&amp;nbsp;240]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, cadmium was identified as the likely cause and in 1961 the source was directly linked to mining operations in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Vallero|Vallero &amp; Letcher 2013, pp.&amp;nbsp;239–241]]&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, cadmium was found in [[Walmart]] exclusive [[Miley Cyrus]] jewelry. Wal-Mart continued to sell the jewelry until May, when covert testing organised by [[Associated Press]] confirmed the original results.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pritchard|Pritchard 2010]]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010 cadmium was detected in the paint used on promotional drinking glasses for the movie [[Shrek Forever After]], sold by [[McDonald's Restaurants]], triggering a recall of 12 million glasses.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mulvihill|Mulvihill &amp; Pritchard 2010]]&lt;/ref&gt;

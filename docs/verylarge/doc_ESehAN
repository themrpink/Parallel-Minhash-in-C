The Portuguese attempted to legitimate and consolidate their trade and settlement positions through the creation of {{lang|pt|[[prazo]]s}} (land grants) tied to Portuguese settlement and administration. While {{lang|pt|prazos}} were originally developed to be held by Portuguese, through intermarriage they became African Portuguese or African Indian centres defended by large African slave armies known as ''[[Chikunda]]''. Historically, within Mozambique, there was slavery. Human beings were bought and sold by African tribal chiefs, Arab traders, and the Portuguese. Many Mozambican slaves were supplied by tribal chiefs who raided warring tribes and sold their captives to the {{lang|pt|prazeiros}}.

Although Portuguese influence gradually expanded, its power was limited and exercised through individual settlers and officials who were granted extensive autonomy. The Portuguese were able to wrest much of the coastal trade from Arabs between 1500 and 1700, but, with the [[Siege of Fort Jesus|Arab seizure]] of Portugal's key foothold at [[Fort Jesus]] on [[Mombasa Island]] (now in Kenya) in 1698, the pendulum began to swing in the other direction. As a result, investment lagged while [[Lisbon]] devoted itself to the more lucrative trade with India and the [[Far East]] and to the colonisation of [[Brazil]]. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the Mazrui and [[History of Oman|Omani Arabs]] reclaimed much of the Indian Ocean trade, forcing the Portuguese to retreat south. Many {{lang|pt|prazos}} had declined by the mid-19th century, but several of them survived. During the 19th century, other European powers, particularly the British and the French, became increasingly involved in the trade and politics of the region. In the [[Island of Mozambique]], the hospital, a majestic neo-classical building constructed in 1877 by the Portuguese, with a garden decorated with ponds and fountains, was for many years the biggest hospital south of the [[Sahara]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Lages, [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091001094134/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_/ai_19557190 The island of Mozambique], [[UNESCO]] Courier, May 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 20th century the Portuguese had shifted the administration of much of Mozambique to large private companies, like the [[Mozambique Company]], the [[Zambezia Company]] and the [[Niassa Company]], controlled and financed mostly by the British, which established, with the Portuguese, railroad lines to neighbouring countries. The companies, granted a charter by the Portuguese government to foster economic development and maintain Portuguese control in the territory's provinces, would lose their purpose when the territory was transferred to the control of the Portuguese colonial government between 1929 and 1942.

Although slavery had been legally abolished in Mozambique by the Portuguese authorities, at the end of the 19th century the Chartered companies enacted a forced labour policy and supplied cheap – often forced – African labour to the [[mining|mines]] and [[plantation]]s of the nearby British colonies and South Africa. The Zambezia Company, the most profitable chartered company, took over a number of smaller {{lang|pt|prazeiro}} holdings and requested Portuguese military outposts to protect its property. The chartered companies and the Portuguese administration built roads and ports to bring their goods to market including a railway linking [[Southern Rhodesia]] with the Mozambican port of [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]]. However, the development's administration gradually started to pass directly from the trading companies to the Portuguese government itself.

Because of their unsatisfactory performance and because of the shift, under the {{lang|pt|[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]}} regime of [[Oliveira Salazar]], towards a stronger Portuguese control of the [[Portuguese Empire]]'s economy, the companies' concessions were not renewed when they ran out. This was what happened in 1942 with the Mozambique Company, which however continued to operate in the agricultural and commercial sectors as a corporation, and had already happened in 1929 with the termination of the Niassa Company's concession.

In the 1950s, the Portuguese overseas colony was rebranded an [[overseas province]] of Portugal, and by the early 1970s, it was officially upgraded to the status of Portuguese non-sovereign state, by which it would remain a Portuguese territory but with a wider administrative autonomy. The [[Front for the Liberation of Mozambique]] (FRELIMO), initiated a guerrilla campaign against Portuguese rule in September 1964. This conflict, along with the two others already initiated in the other Portuguese colonies of [[Portuguese West Africa|Angola]] and [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea]], became part of the so-called [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961–74). From a military standpoint, the Portuguese regular army held the upper hand during all of the conflicts against the independentist guerrilla forces, which created favourable conditions for social development and economic growth until the end of the conflict in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HegjL_5tD6o|title=CD do Diário de Notícias - Parte 08|date=8 July 2007|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ten years of sporadic warfare and after Portugal's return to democracy through a leftist military coup in [[Lisbon]] which replaced Portugal's {{lang|pt|[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]}} regime in favour of a [[National Salvation Junta|military junta]] (the [[Carnation Revolution]] of April 1974), FRELIMO took control of the territory. The talks that led to an agreement on Mozambique's independence, signed in [[Lusaka]], were started. Within a year, almost the entire ethnic Portuguese population had left, many fleeing in fear (in mainland Portugal they were known as {{lang|pt|[[retornados]]}}); others were expelled by the ruling power of the newly independent territory. Mozambique became independent from Portugal on 25 June 1975.

==Government==
At least since the early 19th century, the legal status of Mozambique always considered it as much a part of Portugal as Lisbon, but as an overseas province enjoyed special derogations to account for its distance from Europe.

From 1837, the highest government official in the province of Mozambique has always been the [[governor-general]], who reported directly to the [[Government of Portugal|Government]] in Lisbon, usually through the [[Ministry of the Overseas (Portugal)|minister of the Overseas]]. During some periods in the late 19th and the early 20th century, the governors-general of Mozambique received the status of royal commissioners or of high commissioners, which gave them extended executive and legislative powers, equivalent to those of a government minister.

In the 20th century, the province was also subject to the authoritarian {{lang|pt|[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]}} regime that ruled Portugal from 1933 to 1974, until the military coup in Lisbon, known as the [[Carnation Revolution]]. Most members of the government of Mozambique were from Portugal, but a few were Africans. Nearly all members of the bureaucracy were from Portugal, as most Africans did not have the necessary qualifications to obtain positions.

The government of Mozambique, as it was in Portugal, was highly centralized. Power was concentrated in the executive branch, and all elections where they occurred were carried out using indirect methods. From the Prime Minister's office in Lisbon, authority extended down to the most remote posts and {{lang|pt|regedorias}} of Mozambique through a rigid chain of command. The authority of the government of Mozambique was residual, primarily limited to implementing policies already decided in Europe. In 1967, Mozambique also sent seven delegates to the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|National Assembly]] in Lisbon.

The highest official in the province was the governor-general, appointed by the Portuguese cabinet on recommendation of the Overseas Minister. The governor-general had both executive and legislative authority. A Government Council advised the governor-general in the running of the province. The functional cabinet consisted of five secretaries appointed by the Overseas Minister on the advice of the governor. A Legislative Council had limited powers and its main activity was approving the provincial budget. Finally, an Economic and Social Council had to be consulted on all draft legislation, and the governor-general had to justify his decision to Lisbon if he ignored its advice.

Mozambique was divided into nine districts, which were further subdivided into 61 municipalities ({{lang|pt|concelhos}}) and 33 circumscriptions ({{lang|pt|circunscrições}}). Each subdivision was then made up of three or four individual posts, 166 in all with an average of 40,000 Africans in each. Each district, except Lourenço Marques which was run by the governor-general, was overseen by a governor. Most Africans only had contact with the Portuguese through the post administrator, who was required to visit each village in his domain at least once a year.

The lowest level of administration was the {{lang|pt|regedoria}}, settlements inhabited by Africans living according to customary law. Each {{lang|pt|regedoria}} was run by a {{lang|pt|regulo}}, an African or Portuguese official chosen on the recommendation of local residents. Under the {{lang|pt|regulos}}, each village had its own African headman.

Each level of government could also have an advisory board or council. They were established in municipalities with more than 500 electors, in smaller municipalities or circumscriptions with more than 300 electors, and in posts with more than 20 electors. Each district also had its own board as well.

Two legal systems were in force — Portuguese civil law and African customary law. Until 1961, Africans were considered to be Natives ({{lang|pt|indígenas}}), rather than citizens. After 1961, the previous native laws were repealed and Africans gained ''de facto'' Portuguese citizenship.

==Geography==
Portuguese East Africa was located in [[east Africa|south-eastern Africa]]. It was a long coastal strip with Portuguese strongholds, from current day [[Tanzania]] and [[Kenya]], to the south of current-day [[Mozambique]].

[[File:Combat de marracuene.jpg|thumb|[[Marracuene]] was the site of a decisive battle between Portuguese and King [[Gungunhana]] of [[Gaza Empire|Gaza]] in 1895.]]
In 1900, the part of modern Mozambique northwest of the Zambezi and Shire Rivers was called {{lang|pt|Moçambique}}; the rest of it was {{lang|pt|Lourenço Marques}}. Various districts existed, and even issued stamps, during the first part of the century, including Inhambane, {{lang|pt|Lourenço Marques}}, Mozambique Colony, [[Mozambique Company]], [[Nyassa Company]], Quelimane, Tete, and {{lang|pt|Zambésia}}. The Nyassa Company territory is now {{lang|pt|Cabo Delgado}} and {{lang|pt|Niassa}}.

In the early- and mid-20th century, a number of changes occurred. Firstly, on 28 June 1919, the [[Treaty of Versailles]] transferred the [[Kionga Triangle]], a {{convert|1000|km2|abbr=on}} territory south of the [[Rovuma River]] from [[German East Africa]] to Mozambique.

During [[World War II]], the Charter of the Mozambique Company expired, on 19 July 1942; its territory, known as Manica and Sofala, became a district of Mozambique. Mozambique was constituted as four districts on 1 January 1943 — Manica and Sofala, {{lang|pt|Niassa}}, {{lang|pt|Sul do Save}} (South of the Save River), and {{lang|pt|Zambézia}}.

On 20 October 1954, administrative reorganization caused {{lang|pt|Cabo Delgado}} and Mozambique districts to be split from {{lang|pt|Niassa}}. At the same time, the {{lang|pt|Sul do Save}} district was divided into Gaza, Inhambane and {{lang|pt|Lourenço Marques}}, while the {{lang|pt|Tete}} district was split from Manica and Sofala.

By the early 1970s, Mozambique was bordering the Mozambique Channel, bordering the countries of [[Malawi]], [[Rhodesia]], [[South Africa]], [[Swaziland]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Zambia]]. Covering a total area of {{convert|801590|km2|sqmi|abbr=in|disp=x| (|, slightly less than twice the size of California)}}. With a tropical to subtropical climate, the [[Zambezi]] flows through the north-central and most fertile part of the country. Its coastline had {{convert|2470|km|abbr=in}}, with {{convert|4571|km|abbr=in}} of land boundaries, its highest point at [[Monte Binga]] ({{convert|2436|m|ft|disp=x|, }}). The [[Gorongosa National Park]], founded in 1920, was the main natural park in the territory.

The districts with its respective capitals were:

==Demographics==
By 1970, the Portuguese Overseas Province of Mozambique had about 8,168,933 inhabitants. Nearly 300,000 were white [[ethnic Portuguese]]. There was a number of [[mulatto]]es, from both European and African ancestry, living across the territory. However, the majority of the population belonged to local tribal groups which included the [[Makua people|Makua]]–[[Lomwe people|Lomwe]], the [[Shona people|Shona]] and the [[Tsonga people|Tsonga]]. Other ethnic minorities included British, Greeks, Chinese and Indians. Most inhabitants were black indigenous Africans with a diversity of ethnic and cultural backgrounds, ranging from [[Shangaan]] and [[Makonde people|Makonde]] to [[Yao people|Yao]] or [[Shona people]]s. The Makua were the largest ethnic group in the north. The [[Sena people|Sena]] and [[Shona people|Shona]] (mostly [[Ndau people|Ndau]]) were prominent in the Zambezi valley, and the [[Shangaan|Shangaan (Tsonga)]] dominated in the south. In addition, several other minority groups lived a tribal lifestyle across the territory.

Mozambique had around 250,000 Europeans in 1974 that made up around 3% of the population. Mozambique was cosmopolitan as it had Indian, Chinese, Greek and Anglophone communities (over 25,000 Indians and 5,000 Chinese by the early 1970s). The white population was more influenced from South Africa. The capital of Portuguese Mozambique, Lourenço Marques ([[Maputo]]), had a population of 355,000 in 1970 with around 100,000 Europeans. [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]] had around 115,000 inhabitants at the time with around 30,000 Europeans. Most of the other cities ranged from 10 to 15% in the number of Europeans, while [[Angola (Portugal)|Portuguese Angola]] cities had European majorities ranging from 50% to 60%.

==Society==
{{main|Cultural assimilation|Civilizing mission|Lusotropicalism}}
Starting in 1926, Portugal's colonial authorities abandoned conceptions of an innate inferiority of Africans, and set as their goal the development of a [[multiethnic]] society in its African colonies. The establishment of a dual, [[racialized]] civil society was formally recognized in {{lang|pt|Estatuto do Indigenato}} (The Statute of Indigenous Populations) adopted in 1929, which was based on the subjective concept of [[civilization]] versus [[tribalism]]. In the administration's view, the goal of [[civilizing mission]] would only be achieved after a period of [[Europeanization]] or [[enculturation]] of African communities.

The {{lang|pt|Estatuto}} established a distinction between the colonial citizens, subject to the [[Portuguese law]]s and entitled to all citizenship rights and duties effective in the [[metropole]], and the {{lang|pt|indígenas}} (natives), subjected to colonial legislation and customary African laws. Between the two groups there was a third small group, the {{lang|pt|assimilados}}, comprising native blacks, mulatos, Asians, and mixed-race people, who had at least some formal education and not subjected to paid forced labor. They were entitled to some citizenship rights, and held a special identification card, used to control the movements of forced labor.&lt;ref&gt;CEA 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The {{lang|pt|indígenas}} were subject to the traditional authorities, who were gradually integrated into the colonial administration and charged with solving disputes, managing the access to land, and guaranteeing the flows of workforce and the payment of taxes. As several authors have pointed out,&lt;ref&gt;Mamdani 1996; Gentili 1999; O'Laughlin 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; the {{lang|pt|Indigenato}} regime was the political system that subordinated the immense majority of Africans to local authorities entrusted with governing, in collaboration with the lowest echelon of the colonial administration, the native communities described as tribes and assumed to have a common ancestry, language, and culture. The colonial use of traditional law and structures of power was thus an integral part of the process of colonial domination.&lt;ref&gt;Young 1994; Penvenne 1995; O'Laughlin 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, the integration of traditional authorities into the colonial administration was deepened. The Portuguese colony was divided into {{lang|pt|[[concelho]]s}} (municipalities), in urban areas, governed by colonial and metropolitan legislation, and {{lang|pt|circunscrições}} (localities), in rural areas. The {{lang|pt|circunscrições}} were led by a colonial administrator and divided into {{lang|pt|regedorias}} (subdivisions of circunscrições), headed by {{lang|pt|régules}} (tribal chieftains), the embodiment of traditional authorities. Provincial Portuguese Decree No. 5.639, of July 29, 1944, attributed to {{lang|pt|régulos}} and their assistants, the {{lang|pt|cabos de terra}}, the status of {{lang|pt|auxiliares da administração}} (administrative assistants). Gradually, these traditional titles lost some of their content, and the {{lang|pt|régulos}} and {{lang|pt|cabos de terra}} came to be viewed as an effective part of the colonial state, remunerated for their participation in the collection of taxes, recruitment of the labor force, and agricultural production in the area under their control. Within the areas of their jurisdiction, the {{lang|pt|régulos}} and the {{lang|pt|cabos de terra}} also controlled the distribution of land and settled conflicts according to customary norms.&lt;ref&gt;Geffray 1990; Alexander 1994; Dinerman 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; To exercise their power, the {{lang|pt|régulos}} and {{lang|pt|cabos de terra}} had their own police force.

The ''indigenato'' regime was abolished in 1960. From then on, all Africans were considered Portuguese citizens, and racial discrimination became a sociological rather than a legal feature of colonial society. In fact, the rule of traditional authorities became even more integrated than before in the colonial administration. Legally speaking, by the 1960s and 1970s segregation in Mozambique was minimal compared to that in neighbouring South Africa.

==Urban centres==
[[File:Narrative of an expedition to the Zambesi and its tributaries; and of the discovery of the lakes Shirwa and Nyassa. 1858-1864 (1893) (14793169003).jpg|thumb|Wedding procession at [[Tete, Mozambique|Tete]], from [[David Livingstone]]'s ''Narrative of an Expedition to the Zambesi and its Tributaries'']]
The largest coastal cities, the first founded or settled by [[Portuguese people]] since the 16th century, like the capital {{lang|pt|[[Lourenço Marques]]}}, [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]], [[Quelimane]], [[Nacala]] and [[Inhambane]] were modern cosmopolitan ports and a melting pot of several cultures, with a strong South African influence.  The [[Southeast Africa]]n and [[Portuguese culture]]s were dominant, but the influence of [[Arab]], [[India]]n, and [[China|Chinese]] cultures were also felt. The cuisine was diverse, owing especially to the [[Portuguese cuisine]] and [[Muslim]] heritage, and [[seafood]] was also quite abundant.

Lourenço Marques had always been a point of interest for artistic and architectural development since the first days of its urban expansion and this strong artistic spirit was responsible for attracting some of the world's most forward architects at the turn of the 20th century. The city was home to masterpieces of building work by, [[Pancho Guedes]], [[Herbert Baker]] and [[Thomas Honney]] amongst others. The earliest architectural efforts around the city focused on classical European designs such as the Central Train Station (CFM) designed by architects [[Alfredo Augusto Lisboa de Lima]], [[Mario Veiga]] and [[Ferreira da Costa (architect)|Ferreira da Costa]] and built between 1913 and 1916 (sometimes mistaken with the work of [[Gustav Eiffel]]),&lt;ref&gt;Morais, João Sousa. {{lang|pt|Maputo, Património da Estrutura e Forma Urbana, Topologia do Lugar}}. Livros Horizonte, 2001, p. 110. (in Portuguese)&lt;/ref&gt; and the Hotel Polana designed by Herbert Baker.

As the 1960s and 1970s approached, {{lang|pt|Lourenço Marques}} was yet again at the center of a new wave of architectural influences made most popular by Pancho Guedes. The designs of the 1960s and 1970s were characterized by [[modernist]] movements of clean, straight and functional structures. However, prominent architects such as Pancho Guedes fused this with local art schemes giving the city's buildings a unique Mozambican theme. As a result, most of the properties erected during the second construction boom take on these styling cues.

==Economy==
Since the 15th century, Portugal founded settlements, trading posts, forts and ports in the [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]'s coast. Cities, towns and villages were founded all over East African territories by the Portuguese, especially since the 19th century, like [[Maputo|Lourenço Marques]], [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]], [[Vila Pery]], [[Vila Junqueiro]], [[Vila Cabral]] and [[Porto Amélia]]. Others were expanded and developed greatly under Portuguese rule, like [[Quelimane]], [[Nampula]] and [[Sofala]]. By this time, Mozambique had become a Portuguese colony, but administration was left to the trading companies (like [[Mozambique Company]] and [[Niassa Company]]) who had received long-term leases from [[Lisbon]]. By the mid-1920s, the Portuguese succeeded in creating a highly exploitative and coercive settler economy, in which African natives were forced to work on the fertile lands taken over by Portuguese settlers. Indigenous African peasants mainly produced [[cash crop]]s designated for sale in the markets of the colonial [[metropole]] (the center, i.e. Portugal). Major cash crops included [[cotton]], [[cashews]], [[tea]] and [[rice]]. This arrangement ended in 1932 after the takeover in Portugal by the new [[António de Oliveira Salazar]]'s government — the {{lang|pt|[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]}}. Thereafter, Mozambique, along with other Portuguese colonies, was put under the direct control of Lisbon. In 1951, it became an overseas province. The economy expanded rapidly during the 1950s and 1960s, attracting thousands of Portuguese settlers to the country. It was around this time that the first nationalist guerrilla groups began to form in [[Tanzania]] and other African countries. The strong industrial and agricultural development that did occur throughout the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s was based on Portuguese development plans, and also included British and South African investment.

In 1959–60, Mozambique's major exports included [[cotton]], [[cashew nut]]s, [[tea]], [[sugar]], [[copra]] and [[sisal]]. Other major agricultural productions included [[rice]] and [[coconut]]. The expanding economy of the Portuguese overseas province was fuelled by [[foreign direct investment]], and public investment which included ambitious state-managed development plans. British capital owned two of the large sugar concessions (the third was Portuguese), including the famous Sena states. The Matola Oil Refinery, Procon, was controlled by Britain and the United States. In 1948 the petroleum concession was given to the Mozambique Gulf Oil Company. At Maotize [[coal]] was mined; the industry was chiefly financed by Belgian capital. 60% of the capital of the {{lang|fr|Compagnie de Charbons de Mozambique}} was held by the {{lang|fr|Société Minière et Géologique Belge}}, 30% by the [[Mozambique Company]], and the remaining 10% by the Government of the territory. Three banks were in operation, the {{lang|pt|[[Banco Nacional Ultramarino]]}}, Portuguese, [[Barclays Bank]], D.C.O., British, and the {{lang|pt|Banco Totta e Standard de Moçambique}} (a partnership between [[Standard Bank]] of South Africa and mainland's {{lang|pt|[[Banco Totta &amp; Açores]]}}). Nine out of the twenty-three insurance companies were Portuguese. 80% of [[life assurance]] was in the hands of foreign companies which testifies to the [[open economy|openness of the economy]].
[[File:STS51B-51-14- Lake Cahora Bassa.jpg|thumb|[[Cahora Bassa Dam]] reservoir — the dam began construction in 1969 and was at the time one of the biggest in all of Africa.]]
The Portuguese overseas province of Mozambique was the first territory of Portugal, including the European [[mainland Portugal|mainland]], to distribute [[Coca-Cola]]. Lately the {{lang|pt|Lourenço Marques}} Oil Refinery was established by the {{lang|pt|Sociedade Nacional de Refinação de Petróleo}} (SONAREP) — a Franco-Portuguese syndicate. In the sisal plantations Swiss capital was invested, and in copra concerns, a combination of Portuguese, Swiss and French capital was invested. The large availability of capital from both Portuguese and international origin, allied to the wide range of natural resources and the growing urban population, lead to an impressive growth and development of the economy.

From the late stages of this notable period of high growth and huge development effort started in the 1950s, was the construction of [[Cahora Bassa]] dam by the Portuguese, which started to fill in December 1974 after construction was commenced in 1969. In 1971 construction work of the [[Massingir Dam]] began. At independence, Mozambique's industrial base was well-developed by Sub-Saharan Africa standards, thanks to a boom in investment in the 1960s and early 1970s. Indeed, in 1973, [[value added]] in manufacturing was the sixth highest in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Economically, Mozambique was a source of agricultural raw materials and an earner of foreign exchange. It also provided a market for Portuguese manufacturers which were protected from local competition. Transportation facilities had been developed to exploit the transit trade of South Africa, [[Swaziland]], [[Rhodesia]], [[Malawi]], and [[Zambia]], agricultural production for export purposes had been encouraged, and profitable arrangements for the export of labour had been made with neighbouring countries. Industrial production had been relatively insignificant but did begin to increase in the 1960s. The economic structure generally favoured the taking of profits to Portugal rather than their reinvestment in Mozambique. The Portuguese interests which dominate in banking, industry, and agriculture, exerted a powerful influence on policy.

==Education==
[[File:TT CMZ-AF-GT E 2-1 10 81 - Oficina de Tipografia da Escola de Artes e Ofícios.jpg|thumb|right|Portuguese language printing and typesetting class, 1930]] 
Mozambique's rural population was largely illiterate. However, some thousands of Africans were educated in religion, Portuguese language, and Portuguese history by Catholic and Protestant [[missionary]] schools established in cities and in the countryside.

In 1930, primary schooling became racially segregated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=O ensino indígena na colónia de Moçambique|last=|first=|publisher=Imprensa Nacional|year=1930|isbn=|location=Lourenço Marques|pages=5–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Africans who did not hold assimilated status had to enroll in &quot;rudimentary schools,&quot; whereas whites and the few thousand assimilated Africans had access to &quot;primary schools&quot; of better quality.

Starting in the early 1940s, access to education was expanded in all levels. Nevertheless, &quot;rudimentary schools&quot; retained their poor quality. In 1956, there were 292,199 African students enrolled in first grade. Of these, only 9,486 had successfully passed third grade in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duffy|first=James|date=1961|title=Portuguese Africa (Angola and Mozambique): Some Crucial Problems and the Role of Education in Their Resolution|journal=The Journal of Negro Education|volume=30|issue=3|pages=301|doi=10.2307/2294318|issn=0022-2984|jstor=2294318}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1970, only 7.7% of Mozambique's population was literate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hbs.edu/businesshistory/courses/resources/historical-data-visualization/Pages/details.aspx?data_id=31|title=Adult Literacy Rates - Historical Data Visualization - Business History - Harvard Business School|website=www.hbs.edu|access-date=2019-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive network of [[secondary school]]s (the {{lang|pt|Liceus}}) and technical or [[vocational education]] schools were implemented across the cities and main towns of the territory. However, access to these institutions was largely limited to whites. In 1960, only 30 out of 1,000 students of the ''Liceu Salazar'' were Africans, in spite of whites making up only 2% of the Mozambican population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Struggle for Mozambique|last=Mondlane|first=Eduardo|publisher=Zed Books|year=1983|isbn=|location=London|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, the first Mozambican [[university]] was founded by the Portuguese authorities: the {{lang|pt|[[Universidade de Lourenço Marques]]}}.

==Sports==
The Portuguese-ruled territory was introduced to several popular European and North American sports disciplines since the early urbanistic and economic booms of the 1920s and 1940s. This period was a time of city and town expansion and modernization that included the construction of several sports facilities for [[association football|football]], [[rink hockey]], [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[team handball|handball]], [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], [[gymnastics]] and [[swimming (sport)|swimming]]. Several [[sports clubs]] were founded across the entire territory, among them were some of the largest and oldest sports organizations of Mozambique like {{lang|pt|[[Sporting Clube de Lourenço Marques]]}} established in 1920. Other major sports clubs were founded in the following years like {{lang|pt|[[Grupo Desportivo de Lourenço Marques]]}} (1921), {{lang|pt|[[Clube Ferroviário de Lourenço Marques]]}} (1924), {{lang|pt|[[Sport Club de Vila Pery]]}} (1928), {{lang|pt|[[Clube Ferroviário da Beira]]}} (1943), {{lang|pt|[[Grupo Desportivo da Companhia Têxtil do Punguè]]}} (1943), and {{lang|pt|[[Sport Lourenço Marques e Benfica]]}} (1955). Several sportsmen, especially football players, that achieved wide notability in Portuguese sports were from Mozambique. [[Eusébio]] and [[Mário Coluna]] were examples of that, and excelled in the [[Portugal national football team]]. Since the 1960s, with the latest developments on [[commercial aviation]], the highest ranked football teams of Mozambique and the other African overseas provinces of Portugal, started to compete in the {{lang|pt|[[Taça de Portugal]]}} (the Portuguese Cup). There were also several facilities and organizations for [[golf]], [[tennis]] and [[wild hunting]].

The [[nautical sports]] were also well developed and popular, especially in {{lang|pt|Lourenço Marques}}, home to the {{lang|pt|[[Clube Naval de Lourenço Marques]]}}. The largest stadium was the {{lang|pt|[[Estádio da Machava|Estádio Salazar]]}}, located near {{lang|pt|Lourenço Marques}}. Opened in 1968, it was at the time the most advanced in Mozambique conforming to standards set by both [[FIFA]] and the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] (UCI). The [[cycling]] track could be adjusted to allow for 20,000 more seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/emoitas/3765484514/|title=Estádio Salazar 1968|work=Flickr - Photo Sharing!}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Beginning in the 1950s, motorsport was introduced to Mozambique. At first race cars would compete in areas around the city, Polana and along the {{lang|pt|marginal}} but as funding and interest increased, a dedicated race track was built in the [[Costa Do Sol]] area along and behind the {{lang|pt|marginal}} with the ocean to the east with a length of {{convert|1.5|km|abbr=off}}. The initial surface of the new track, named {{lang|pt|[[Autódromo de Lourenço Marques]]}} did not provide enough grip and an accident in the late 1960s killed 8 people and injured many more. Therefore, in 1970, the track was renovated and the surface changed to meet the highest international safety requirements that were needed at large events with many spectators. The length then increased to {{convert|3909|km|abbr=off}}. The city became host to several international and local events beginning with the inauguration on 26 November 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autosport.aeiou.pt/gen.pl?p=stories&amp;op=view&amp;fokey=as.stories/64170|title=Autódromo Lourenço Marques|author=Eurotux S.A.|work=Autosport|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005064411/http://autosport.aeiou.pt/gen.pl?p=stories&amp;op=view&amp;fokey=as.stories%2F64170|archivedate=2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carnation Revolution and independence==
{{main|Carnation Revolution|Lusaka Accord|People's Republic of Mozambique}}
As [[communist]] and [[anti-colonial]] ideologies spread out across Africa, many clandestine political movements were established in support of Mozambique's independence. These movements claimed that policies and development plans were primarily designed by the ruling authorities for the benefit of the ethnic Portuguese population, affecting a majority of the indigenous population who suffered both state-sponsored discrimination and enormous social pressure. Many felt they had received too little opportunity or resources to upgrade their skills and improve their economic and social situation to a degree comparable to that of the Europeans. Statistically, Portuguese Mozambique's whites were indeed wealthier and more skilled than the black indigenous majority, in spite of decreasing legal discrimination of Africans starting in the 1960s.

The [[Front for the Liberation of Mozambique]] (FRELIMO), headquartered in [[Tanzania]], initiated a [[guerrilla]] campaign against Portuguese rule in September 1964. This conflict, along with the two others already initiated in the other Portuguese overseas territories of [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] and [[Portuguese Guinea]], became part of the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961–74). Several African territories under European rule had achieved independence in recent decades. [[Oliveira Salazar]] attempted to resist this tide and maintain the integrity of the [[Portuguese empire]]. By 1970, the anti-guerrilla war in Africa was consuming an important part of the Portuguese budget and there was no sign of a final solution in sight. This year was marked by a large-scale military operation in northern Mozambique, the [[Gordian Knot Operation]], which displaced the FRELIMO's bases and destroyed much of the guerrillas' military capacity. At a military level, a part of Guinea-Bissau was de facto independent since 1973, but the capital and the major towns were still under Portuguese control. In Angola and Mozambique, independence movements were only active in a few remote countryside areas from where the Portuguese Army had retreated. However, their impending presence and the fact that they wouldn't go away dominated public anxiety. Throughout the war period Portugal faced increasing dissent, arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions imposed by most of the international community. For the Portuguese society the war was becoming even more unpopular due to its length and financial costs, the worsening of diplomatic relations with other United Nations members, and the role it had always played as a factor of perpetuation of the {{lang|pt|Estado Novo}} regime. It was this escalation that would lead directly to the mutiny of members of the FAP in the [[Carnation Revolution]] in 1974 – an event that would lead to the independence of the former Portuguese colonies in Africa. A leftist [[military coup]] in Lisbon on 24 April 1974 by the {{lang|pt|[[Movimento das Forças Armadas]]}} (MFA), overthrew the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime headed by Prime Minister [[Marcelo Caetano]].

As one of the objectives of the MFA, all the Portuguese overseas territories in Africa were offered independence. FRELIMO took complete control of the Mozambican territory after a transition period, as agreed in the [[Lusaka Accord]] which recognized Mozambique's right to independence and the terms of the transfer of power.

Within a year of the Portuguese military coup at Lisbon, almost all of the Portuguese population had left the African territory as refugees (in mainland Portugal they were known as {{lang|pt|[[retornados]]}}) – some expelled by the new ruling power of Mozambique, some fleeing in fear. A parade and a state banquet completed the independence festivities in the capital, which was expected to be renamed Can Phumo, or &quot;Place of Phumo&quot;, after a [[Tsonga people|Tsonga]] chief who lived in the area before the Portuguese navigator {{lang|pt|[[Lourenço Marques (explorer)|Lourenço Marques]]}} founded the city in 1545 and gave his name to it. Most city streets, named for Portuguese heroes or important dates in [[History of Portugal|Portuguese history]], had their names changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913229-1,00.html |title=Dismantling the Portuguese Empire |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=7 July 1975 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austin was born in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]] and later grew up in [[Fresno, California]], attending [[Fresno High School]]. His mother was a drama teacher which influenced his upbringing as an actor.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; He attended [[Bowdoin College]] in [[Brunswick, Maine]] because it was the most distant point in the continental United States from Fresno. He also attended [[Fresno State College]] and [[UCLA]], but did not graduate from any of them. He was in the UCLA Drama Department at the same time as another dropout, [[Ray Manzarek]]. of [[The Doors]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://mag.chromiumswitch.org/CSMagazine-03.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Career ==

=== Radio ===
In Los Angeles in the late 1960s, he was one of the first apprentices for the [[Center Theatre Group]] and worked on the staff of [[KPFK]] radio in [[Los Angeles]]. At KPFK he worked with other staffers [[David Ossman]] and [[Peter Bergman (comedian)|Peter Bergman]] who hosted Radio Free Oz on that station. Along with Bergman's friend [[Phil Proctor]], they formed [[The Firesign Theatre]].

Starting as live radio actors, the group would go on to record a series of [[Surrealism|surrealistic]] [[comedy]] albums that were a hit amongst an underground audience.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allmusic.com/artist/firesign-theatre-mn0000795481/credits&lt;/ref&gt; Austin played the group's best-known creation, private investigator [[Nick Danger]]. Other prominent roles were as (Happy) Harry Cox, the narrator of ''[[Everything You Know Is Wrong]]'' and Bebop Loco/Lobo on ''[[Give Me Immortality or Give Me Death]]''. He had also served as the troupe's musician and record producer. 

{{quote|&quot;It was those comments, the off-mic things, that made Phil so funny.  He was the most surreal writer of all of us.&quot;|[[David Ossman]]&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;}}

=== Short story writer ===
His collection of short stories, ''Tales of the Old Detective and Other Big Fat Lies'', is published by Audio Editions. Two of his stories appear in the third volume of ''[[Mirth of a Nation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://firesigntheatre.com/media/media.php?member=Austin&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Record albums ===
Austin also wrote a solo work, ''[[Roller Maidens From Outer Space]]'', and directed (and acted in) ''Eat Or Be Eaten''. 

Stage versions of ''[[Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers]]''; ''[[How Can You Be in Two Places at Once When You're Not Anywhere at All|The Further Adventures of Nick Danger, Third Eye]]''; ''[[Waiting for the Electrician or Someone Like Him]]''; and ''Temporarily Humboldt County'' are published by [[Broadway Play Publishing Inc.]]. 

== Death ==
Austin died at his home in [[Fox Island, Washington]] on June 18, 2015 at the age of 74. The cause of death was originally given as [[cardiac arrest]],&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{cite news |last=Colker |first=David |date=June 19, 2015 |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-phil-austin-20150620-story.html |title=Phil Austin, dies at 74; voice of Firesign Theatre's Nick Danger |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this was later changed to an [[aneurysm]].&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/26/arts/phil-austin-who-played-nick-danger-on-firesign-theater-dies-at-74.html |title=Phil Austin (a.k.a.

{{neo-fascism}}
'''Neo-fascism''' is a post-[[World War II]] ideology that includes significant elements of [[fascism]]. Neo-fascism usually includes [[ultranationalism]], [[racial supremacy]], [[populism]], [[authoritarianism]], [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]], [[xenophobia]] and [[anti-immigration]] sentiment as well as opposition to [[liberal democracy]], [[parliamentarianism]], [[liberalism]], [[Marxism]], [[communism]] and [[socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Peter|last1=Fritzsche|title=Terrorism in the Federal Republic of Germany and Italy: Legacy of the '68 Movement or 'Burden of Fascism'?|journal=Terrorism and Political Violence|date=1 October 1989|issn=0954-6553|pages=466–481|volume=1|issue=4|doi=10.1080/09546558908427039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegations that a group is neo-fascist may be hotly contested, especially when the term is used as a [[Fascist (insult)|political epithet]]. Some [[post–World War II]] regimes have been described as neo-fascist due to their authoritarian nature, and sometimes due to their fascination with and sympathy towards fascist [[ideology]] and [[ritual]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Fascism as the Looming Shadow of Democracy: A Critique of the Xenophobic Reason | first = Henk | last = Oosterling | encyclopedia = Philosophy and Democracy in Intercultural Perspective/Philosophie et démocratie en perspective interculturelle | pages = 235–252 | year = 1997 | publisher = Rodopi | location = Amsterdam/Atlanta}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deutsch|first=Sandra McGee|title=Fascism, Neo-Fascism, or Post-Fascism?

== History ==
{{fascism sidebar}}
According to [[Jean-Yves Camus]] and [[Nicolas Lebourg]], the neo-fascist ideology emerged in 1942, after the [[Third Reich]] launched the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the USSR]] and decided to reorient its propaganda on a Europeanist ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;/&gt; Europe then became both the myth and the utopia of the neo-fascists, who abandoned previous theories of racial inequalities within the white race to share a common [[Pan-European nationalism|euro-nationalist]] stance after World War II, embodied in [[Oswald Mosley]]'s [[Europe a Nation]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Laqueur|first=Walter|title=Fascism: Past, Present, Future|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198025276|location=|pages=93–94|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following chronology can therefore be delineated: an ideological gestation before 1919; the historical experience of [[fascism]] between 1919 and 1942, unfolded in several phases; and finally neo-fascism from 1942 onward.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Camus|first1=Jean-Yves|url=|title=Far-Right Politics in Europe|last2=Lebourg|first2=Nicolas|date=2017-03-20|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674971530|location=|pages=9–10, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_j5YDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38 38]|nopp=y|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing inspiration from the [[Italian Social Republic]], institutional neo-fascism took the form of the [[Italian Social Movement]] (MSI). It became one of the chief reference points for the European far-right until the late 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ignazi|first=Piero|title=Extreme Right Parties in Western Europe|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198293255|location=|pages=51|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;the best (and only) example of a Neofascist party&quot;, in the words of political scientist [[Cas Mudde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Casadio|first=Massimiliano Capra|date=2014|title=The New Right and Metapolitics in France and Italy|journal=Journal for the Study of Radicalism|volume=8|issue=1|pages=45–86|doi=10.14321/jstudradi.8.1.0045|issn=1930-1189|jstor=10.14321/jstudradi.8.1.0045|s2cid=144052579}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the initiative of the MSI, the [[European Social Movement]] was established in 1951 as a pan-European organization of like-minded neo-fascist groups and figures such as the [[Francoist]] [[Falange]], [[Maurice Bardèche]], [[Per Engdahl]], and [[Oswald Mosley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c5opW1yV7FcC&amp;pg=PA592|title=The Oxford handbook of fascism|last=Bosworth|first=R.

In 1961, Bardèche redefined the nature of fascism in a book deemed influential in the European far-right at large entitled ''Qu'est-ce que le fascisme?'' (''What Is Fascism?''). He argued that previous fascists had essentially made two mistakes in that they focused their efforts on the methods rather than the original &quot;idea&quot;; and they wrongly believed that fascist society could be achieved via the nation-state as opposed to the construction of Europe. According to him, fascism could survive the 20th century in a new [[metapolitical]] guise if its theorists succeed in building inventive methods adapted to the changes of their times; the aim being the promotion of the core politico-cultural fascist project rather than vain attempts to revive doomed regimes:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bar-On|first=Tamir|url=|title=Where Have All The Fascists Gone?|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781351873130|location=|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=N5KoDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT14 PT14]|nopp=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Bardèche wrote: &quot;The single party, the secret police, the public displays of Caesarism, even the presence of a Führer are not necessarily attributes of fascism. [...] The famous fascist methods are constantly revised and will continue to be revised. More important than the mechanism is the idea which fascism has created for itself of man and freedom. [...] With another name, another face, and with nothing which betrays the projection from the past, with the form of a child we do not recognize and the head of a young Medusa, the Order of Sparta will be reborn: and paradoxically it will, without doubt, be the last bastion of Freedom and the sweetness of living.&lt;ref&gt;Bardèche, Mauriche (1961). ''Qu'est-ce que le fascisme?''. Paris: Les Sept Couleurs. pp. 175–176.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spirit of Bardèche's strategy of disguise through framework change, the MSI had developed a policy of ''inserimento'' (insertion, [[entryism]]), which relied on gaining political acceptance via the cooperation with other parties within the democratic system. In the political context of the Cold War, anti-communism began to replace anti-fascism as the dominant trend in liberal democracies. In Italy, the MSI became a support group in parliament for the Christian Democratic government in the late 1950s–early 1960s, but was forced back into &quot;political ghetto&quot; after anti-fascist protests and violent street clashes occurred between radical groups, which leading to the demise of the short-lived fascist-backed [[Tambroni Cabinet]] in July 1960.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Fella|first1=Stefano|url=|title=Re-inventing the Italian Right: Territorial Politics, Populism and 'post-fascism'|last2=Ruzza|first2=Carlo|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134286348|location=|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=R6CjdfEXpPUC&amp;pg=PA15 13–16]|nopp=y|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes and description ==
A number of historians and political scientists have pointed out that the situations in a number of European countries in the 1980s and 1990s, in particular France, Germany and Italy, were in some significant ways analogous to the conditions in Europe in the period between World War I and World War II that gave rise to fascism in its many national guises. Constant economic crises including high unemployment, a resurgence of nationalism, an increase in ethnic conflicts, and the geo-political weakness of national regimes were all present, and while not an exact one-to-one correspondence, circumstances were similar enough to promote the beginning of neo-fascism as a new fascist movement. Because intense nationalism is almost always a part of neo-fascism, the parties which make up this movement are not pan-European, but are specific to each country they arise in; other than this, the neo-fascist parties and other groups have many ideological traits in common.&lt;ref&gt;Golsan, Richard J. &quot;Introduction&quot; in Golsan (1998), pp.2-6&lt;/ref&gt;

While certainly fascistic in nature, it is claimed by some that there are differences between neo-fascism and what can be called &quot;historical fascism&quot;, or the kind of neo-fascism which came about in the immediate aftermath of World War II. Some historians claim that contemporary neo-fascist parties are not anti-democratic because they operate within their country's political system. Whether that is a significant difference between neo-fascism and historical fascism is doubted by other scholars, who point out that Hitler worked within the existing political system of the [[Weimar Republic]] to obtain power, although it took an anti-democratic but constitutional process in the form of presidential appointment rather than election through the Reichstag. Others point to the current neo-fascists not being totalitarian in nature, but the organization of their parties along the lines of the ''[[Führerprinzip]]'' would seem to indicate otherwise. Historian [[Stanley G. Payne]] claims that the differences in current circumstance to that of the interwar years, and the strengthening of democracy in European countries since the end of the war prevents a general return of historical fascism, and causes true neo-fascist groups to be small and remain on the fringe. For Payne, groups like the [[National Front (France)|National Front]] in France are not neo-fascists in nature, but are merely &quot;right radical parties&quot; that will, in the course of time, moderate their positions in order to achieve electoral victory.&lt;ref&gt;Golsan, Richard J. &quot;Introduction&quot; in Golsan (1998), pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem of immigrants, both legal and illegal or irregular, whether called &quot;foreigners&quot;, &quot;foreign workers&quot;, &quot;economic refugees&quot;, &quot;ethnic minorities&quot;, &quot;asylum seekers&quot;, or &quot;aliens&quot;, is a core neo-fascist issue, intimately tied to their nativism, ultranationalism, and xenophobia, but the specifics differ somewhat from country to country due to prevailing circumstances. In general, the anti-immigrant impetus is strong when the economy is weak or unemployment is high, and people fear that outsiders are taking their jobs. Because of this, neo-Fascist parties have more electoral traction during hard economic times. Again, this mirrors the situation in the interwar years, when, for instance, Germany suffered from incredible [[hyperinflation]] and many people had their life savings swept away. In contemporary Europe, mainstream political parties see the electoral advantage the neo-fascist and far-right parties get from their strong emphasis on the supposed problem of the outsider, and are then tempted to co-opt the issue by moving somewhat to the right on the immigrant issue, hoping to slough off some voters from the hard right. In the absence in post-war Europe of a strong socialist movement, this has the tendency to move the political center to the right overall.&lt;ref&gt;Judt (2005), pp.736-46&lt;/ref&gt;

While both historical fascism and contemporary neo-fascism are xenophobic, nativist and anti-immigrant, neo-fascist leaders are careful not to present these views in so strong a manner as to draw obvious parallels to historical events. Both [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] of France's National Front and [[Jörg Haider]]'s [[Freedom Party of Austria]], in the words of historian [[Tony Judt]], &quot;revealed [their] prejudices only indirectly&quot;. Jews would not be castigated as a group, but a person would be specifically named as danger who just happened to be a Jew.&lt;ref name=judt&gt;Judt (2005), pp. 742–746.&lt;/ref&gt; The public presentation of their leaders is one principle difference between the neo-Fascists and historical Fascists: their programs have been &quot;finely honed and 'modernized'&quot; to appeal to the electorate, a &quot;'far-right ideology with a democratic veneer'&quot;. Modern neo-fascists do not appear in &quot;jackboots and brownshirts&quot;, but in suits and ties. The choice is deliberate, as the leaders of the various groups work to differentiate themselves from the brutish leaders of historical fascism and also to hide whatever bloodlines and connections tie the current leaders to the historical Fascist movements. When these become public, as they did in the case of Haider, it can lead to their decline and fall.&lt;ref&gt;Wolin, Richard. &quot;Designer Fascism&quot; in Golan (1998), p.49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=judt/&gt;

== International networks ==
In 1951, the [[New European Order]] (NEO) neo-fascist European-wide alliance was set up to promote [[pan-European nationalism]]. It was a more radical splinter group of the [[European Social Movement]]. The NEO had its origins in the 1951 [[Malmö]] conference when a group of rebels led by [[René Binet (neo-Fascist)|René Binet]] and [[Maurice Bardèche]] refused to join the [[European Social Movement]] as they felt that it did not go far enough in terms of [[Racism|racialism]] and [[anti-communism]]. As a result, Binet joined with [[Gaston-Armand Amaudruz]] in a second meeting that same year in [[Zurich]] to set up a second group pledged to wage war on communists and non-[[white people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = German Nationalists and European Union|last = Tauber|first = Kurt P.|journal = [[Political Science Quarterly]]|issn = 0032-3195|volume = 74|issue = 4|year = 1959|pages = 564–89|doi = 10.2307/2146424|jstor = 2146424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regimes of [[Francoist Spain]], [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s Chile and [[Alfredo Stroessner]]'s [[Paraguay]] participated together in [[Operation Condor]], which targeted political opponents worldwide.

According to the ''[[Miami Herald]]'', this bombing was decided on at the same meeting during which it was decided to target Chilean former minister [[Orlando Letelier]], who was assassinated on 21 September 1976. Carriles wrote in his autobiography that &quot;we the Cubans didn't oppose ourselves to an isolated tyranny, nor to a particular system of our fatherland, but that we had in front of us a colossal enemy, whose main head was in Moscow, with its tentacles dangerously extended on all the planet.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/book/caminos-guerrero-5.htm Preface] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506135038/http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/book/caminos-guerrero-5.htm |date=6 May 2006}} to ''Los Caminos del Guerrero'', 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|History of the Italian Republic}}
[[File:Giorgio Almirante crop.jpg|thumb|[[Giorgio Almirante]], leader of the [[Italian Social Movement]]]]
[[History of Italy as a Republic|Italy]] was broadly divided into two political blocs following World War II, the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]], who remained in power until the 1990s, and the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI), which was very strong immediately after the war and achieved a large consensus during the [[1970s]].

With the beginning of the [[Cold War]], the British government feared that the requested extradition of [[Italian war criminals]] to [[Yugoslavia]] would benefit the PCI. Preventing anything like the [[Nuremberg trials]] for Italian war crimes, the collective memory of the crimes committed by Italians was excluded from public media, from textbooks in Italian schools, and even from the academic discourse on the Western side of the [[Iron curtain]] throughout the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alessandra Kersevan]] 2008: (Editor) Foibe - Revisionismo di stato e amnesie della repubblica.

In 1946, a group of Fascist soldiers founded the [[Italian Social Movement]] to continue advocating the ideas of [[Benito Mussolini]]. The leader of the MSI was [[Giorgio Almirante]], who remained at the head of the party until his death in 1988.

Despite attempts in the 1970s towards a &quot;[[historic compromise]]&quot; between the PCI and the DC, the PCI did not have a role in executive power until the 1980s. In December 1970, [[Junio Valerio Borghese]] attempted, along with Stefano Delle Chiaie, the ''[[Borghese Coup]]'' which was supposed to install a neo-fascist regime. Neo-fascist groups took part in various [[false flag]] terrorist attacks, starting with the December 1969 [[Piazza Fontana massacre]], for which [[Vincenzo Vinciguerra]] was convicted, and they are usually considered to have stopped with the 1980 [[Bologna railway bombing]]. A 2000 parliamentary report from the center-left [[The Olive Tree (political coalition)|Olive Tree]] coalition concluded that &quot;the [[strategy of tension]] had been supported by the [[United States]] in order to impede the PCI, and, in a lesser measure, the [[Italian Socialist Party|PSI]] from reaching executive power&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Since the 1990s, the [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]], led by [[Gianfranco Fini]], a former member of the [[Italian Social Movement]], has distanced itself from Mussolini and fascism and it has also made efforts to improve its relations with Jewish groups, with most die-hards leaving it; it now seeks to present itself as a respectable right-wing party. Fini joined [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s government. Neo-fascist parties in Italy include the [[Tricolour Flame]] (''Fiamma Tricolore''), the [[New Force (Italy)|New Force]] (''Forza Nuova''), the [[National Social Front]] (''Fronte Sociale Nazionale''), and [[CasaPound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Pietro|last=Castelli Gattinara|title=The appeal of neo-fascism in times of crisis.

=== Greece ===
[[File:Golden Dawn demonstration 1.jpg|thumb|Golden Dawn demonstration in Greece, 2012]]
After the onset of the [[Great Recession]] and economic crisis in Greece, a movement known as the [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]], widely considered a neo-Nazi party, soared in support out of obscurity and won seats in [[Greece]]'s parliament, espousing a staunch hostility towards minorities, illegal immigrants and refugees. In 2013, after the murder of an anti-fascist musician by a person with links to Golden Dawn, the Greek government ordered the arrest of Golden Dawn's leader [[Nikolaos Michaloliakos]] and other Golden Dawn members on charges related to being associated with a criminal organization. In October, 2020, the court declared Golden Dawn to be a criminal organization, convicting 68 members of various crimes including murder. 

=== Portugal ===
After the fall of authoritarianism in [[Portugal]] after the [[Carnation Revolution]] of 1974, several neo-fascist [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Salazarist]] groups arose such as the [[New Order (Portugal)]] which was created in 1978. A report by the European Parliament defined the ideology of the New Order as revolutionary fascist and hyper-nationalist.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://bookshop.europa.eu/en/committee-of-inquiry-into-the-rise-of-fascism-and-racism-in-europe-pbAX4686654/ Committee of Inquiry Into the Rise of Fascism and Racism in Europe: Report on the findings of the inquiry] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202104732/http://bookshop.europa.eu/en/committee-of-inquiry-into-the-rise-of-fascism-and-racism-in-europe-pbAX4686654/ |date=2 February 2017}}'', European Parliament, Dec 1985, p. 58
&lt;/ref&gt; The group also had connections to [[Fuerza Nueva]] in Spain. The New Order was disbanded in 1982, however its activities continued to as late as 1985.

The [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) has been accused by political opponents of holding to elements of fascism e.g. populist nationalist and anti-immigration policies. However, UKIP has denied this, stating that its policies are not anti-immigration but pro-controlled immigration, patriotic not nationalist, in support of British democracy, and for all British citizens without regard to ethnicity or country of birth.&lt;ref&gt;

Groups which are identified as neo-fascist in the [[United States]] generally include neo-Nazi organizations and movements such as the [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]], and the [[American Nazi Party]]. The [[Institute for Historical Review]] publishes [[negationist]] historical papers often of an anti-semitic nature. The [[alt-right]]—which covers a broad range of groups, from [[neoreactionaries]] to [[white nationalist]]s—is also often included under the [[umbrella term]] &quot;neo-fascist&quot;, because they adhere to a radical form of authoritarian [[ultranationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/17/fascism-history-united-states|title=The United States was never immune to fascism.

{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
The [[Bolivian Socialist Falange]] party founded in 1937 played a crucial role in mid-century Bolivian politics. [[Luis García Meza Tejada]]'s regime took power during the 1980 ''[[1980 Bolivian coup d'état|Cocaine Coup]]'' in [[Bolivia]] with the help of Italian neo-fascist [[Stefano Delle Chiaie]], [[Nazi]] [[War crime|war criminal]] [[Klaus Barbie]] and the [[Buenos Aires]] [[military junta|junta]]. That regime has been accused of neo-fascist tendencies and of admiration for Nazi paraphernalia and rituals. [[Hugo Banzer Suárez]], who preceded Tejada, also displayed admiration for [[Nazism]] and fascism.

[[Adolf Hitler]]'s propaganda which advocated the hegemony of &quot;Greater Germany&quot; inspired similar ideas of &quot;Indonesia Mulia&quot; (esteemed [[Indonesia]]) and &quot;Indonesia Raya&quot; (great Indonesia) in the former [[Dutch colony]]. The first fascist party was the [[Partai Fasis Indonesia]] (PFI). [[Sukarno]] admired Hitler's [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] and its vision of happiness for all: &quot;It's in the Third Reich that the Germans will see Germany at the apex above other nations in this world,&quot; he said in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/07/20/fascism-indonesia-no-big-deal.html|title=Fascism in Indonesia, no big deal?|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|author=Aboeprijadi Santoso|date=July 20, 2008|access-date=9 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109235949/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/07/20/fascism-indonesia-no-big-deal.html|archive-date=9 January 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that Hitler was 'extraordinarily clever' in 'depicting his ideals': he spoke about Hitler's rhetorical skills, but denied any association with [[Nazism]] as an ideology, saying that Indonesian nationalism was not as narrow as Nazi nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sydney.edu.au/arts/indonesian/docs/Hons_Thesis_Mirela_Suciu_2008.pdf Signs of Anti-Semitism in Indonesia], Eva Mirela Suciu, Department of Asian Studies, The University of Sydney, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The third section of Treblinka II (Camp 3, also called the upper camp) was the main killing zone, with gas chambers at its centre.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=82}} It was completely screened from the railway tracks by an earth bank built with the help of a mechanical digger. This mound was elongated in shape, similar to a retaining wall, and can be seen in [[Treblinka#Organisation of the camp|a sketch]] produced during the 1967 trial of Treblinka II commandant [[Franz Stangl]]. On the other sides, the zone was camouflaged from new arrivals like the rest of the camp, using tree branches woven into barbed wire fences by the ''Tarnungskommando'' (the work detail led out to collect them).{{sfn|Webb|Lisciotto|2007}}{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=89}} From the undressing barracks, a fenced-off path led through the forested area to the gas chambers.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=82}} The SS cynically called it ''die Himmelstraße'' (&quot;the road to heaven&quot;){{sfn|Smith|2010}} or ''der Schlauch'' (&quot;the tube&quot;).{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=83}} For the first eight months of the camp's operation, the excavator was used to dig burial ditches on both sides of the gas chambers; these ditches were {{convert|50|m}} long, {{convert|25|m}} wide, and {{convert|10|m}} deep.{{sfn|Webb|Lisciotto|2007}} In early 1943, they were replaced with cremation [[pyre]]s up to {{convert|30|m}} long, with rails laid across the pits on concrete blocks.

==Killing process==
Unlike [[Nazi concentration camps]] in which prisoners were used as forced labour, [[extermination camps]] such as Treblinka had only one function: to kill those sent there. To prevent incoming victims from realising its nature, Treblinka II was disguised as a transit camp for deportations further east, complete with made-up train schedules, a fake train-station clock with hands painted on it, names of destinations,&lt;ref name=&quot;ARC - Treblinka History&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.deathcamps.org/treblinka/treblinka.html |title=Treblinka Camp History |publisher=ARC |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of The Holocaust |date=27 August 2006 |access-date=24 August 2013 |author=Webb, Chris }}&lt;/ref&gt; a fake ticket window, and the sign &quot;Ober Majdan&quot;,{{sfn|Grossman|1946|p=379}} a code word for Treblinka commonly used to deceive prisoners arriving from Western Europe.

The [[Grossaktion Warsaw (1942)|mass deportation]] of Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto began on 22 July 1942 with the first shipment of 6,000 people. The gas chambers started operation the following morning.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=94}} For the next two months, deportations from Warsaw continued on a daily basis via two shuttle trains (the second one, from 6 August 1942),{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=92}} each carrying about 4,000 to 7,000 people crying for water. No other trains were allowed to stop at the Treblinka station.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=98}} The first daily trains came in the early morning, often after an overnight wait, and the second, in mid-afternoon.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=94}} All new arrivals were sent immediately to the undressing area by the ''Bahnhofskommando'' squad that managed the arrival platform, and from there to the gas chambers. According to German records, including the [[Stroop Report|official report]] by SS-''[[Brigadeführer]]'' [[Jürgen Stroop]], 265,000 Jews were transported in [[freight train]]s from the Warsaw Ghetto to Treblinka during the period from 22 July to 12 September 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;ushmm-uprising&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005188 |title=Warsaw Ghetto Uprising |publisher=US Holocaust Memorial Museum |date=10 June 2013 |access-date=25 August 2013 |author=Holocaust Encyclopedia |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502213631/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005188 |archive-date=2 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Court of Assizes|1965|loc = excerpts}}

Treblinka received transports of almost 20,000 foreign Jews between October 1942 and March 1943, including 8,000 from the German [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] via [[Theresienstadt]], and over 11,000 from Bulgarian-occupied [[Thrace]], [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], and [[Pirot]] following an agreement with the Nazi-allied Bulgarian government.&lt;ref name=&quot;USHMM&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007257 |title=Treblinka: Chronology |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |date=10 June 2013 |access-date=9 December 2013 |author=Holocaust Encyclopedia |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605123023/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007257 |archive-date=5 June 2012 |format=Internet Archive |quote=Deportations from Theresienstadt and Bulgarian-occupied territory among others. }}&lt;/ref&gt; They had train tickets and arrived predominantly in passenger carriages with considerable luggage, travel foods and drinks, all of which were taken by the SS to the food storage barracks.

Most of those killed at Treblinka were Jews, but about 2,000 [[Romani people]] also died there. Like the Jews, the Romani were first rounded up and sent to the ghettos. At a conference on 30 January 1940 it was decided that all 30,000 Romani living in Germany proper were to be deported to former Polish territory. Most of these were sent to Jewish ghettos in the General Government, such as those in Warsaw and Łódź. As with the Jews, most Romani who went to Treblinka died in the gas chambers, although some were shot. The majority of the Jews living in ghettos were sent to Bełżec, Sobibór, or Treblinka to be executed; most of the Romani living in the ghettos were shot on the spot. There were no known Romani escapees or survivors from Treblinka.&lt;ref name=Romani/&gt;

===Gas chambers===

After undressing, the newly arrived Jews were beaten with whips to drive them towards the gas chambers; hesitant men were treated particularly brutally. [[Rudolf Höss]], the commandant at Auschwitz, contrasted the practice at Treblinka of deceiving the victims about the showers with his own camp's practice of telling them they had to go through a &quot;delousing&quot; process.{{sfn|Shirer|1981|p=969|loc = [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1946Hoess.html Affidavit] (Hoess, Nuremberg)}} According to the postwar testimony of some SS officers, men were always gassed first, while women and children waited outside the gas chambers for their turn. During this time, the women and children could hear the sounds of suffering from inside the chambers, and they became aware of what awaited them, which caused panic, distress, and even involuntary defecation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shoah&quot; /&gt;

Many survivors of the Treblinka camp testified that an officer known as '[[Ivan the Terrible (Treblinka guard)|Ivan the Terrible]]' was responsible for operating the gas chambers in 1942 and 1943. While Jews were awaiting their fate outside the gas chambers, Ivan the Terrible allegedly tortured, beat, and killed many of them. Survivors witnessed Ivan beat victims' heads open with a pipe, cut victims with a sword or a bayonet, cut off noses and ears, and gouge out eyes.&lt;ref&gt;''In the Matter of the Extradition of John DEMJANJUK, A.K.A.

The gas chambers were entirely closed off by a tall wooden fence. Originally, they consisted of three interconnected barracks {{convert|8|m}} long and {{convert|4|m}} wide, disguised as showers. They had double walls insulated by earth packed down in between. The interior walls and ceilings were lined with roofing paper. The floors were covered with tin-plated sheet metal, the same material used for the roof.

According to Stangl, a train transport of about 3,000 people could be &quot;processed&quot; in three hours. In a 14-hour workday, 12,000 to 15,000 people were killed.{{sfn|Arad|1987|p=120|ps=: Stangl trial testimony.}} After the new gas chambers were built, the duration of the killing process was reduced to an hour and a half.&lt;ref name=&quot;ARC - Treblinka History&quot; /&gt; The victims were gassed to death with the exhaust fumes conducted through pipes from an engine of a [[Red Army]] tank.{{efn|Witnesses who had closer experiences to the actual gassing engine share a large agreement that they were run by gasoline/petrol, while those witnesses with only an indirect hearsay knowledge of the engine were more likely to identify it as diesel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Critique&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka.

Between August and September 1942, a large new building with a concrete foundation was built from bricks and mortar under the guidance of Action T4 euthanasia expert [[Erwin Lambert]]. It contained 8–10 gas chambers, each of which was 8 metres by 4 metres (26&amp;nbsp;ft by 13&amp;nbsp;ft), and it had a corridor in the centre. Stangl supervised its construction and brought in building materials from the nearby village of Małkinia by dismantling factory stock.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=82}} During this time victims continued to arrive daily and were led naked past the building site to the original gas chambers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arad-1984/pdf&quot;/&gt; The new gas chambers became operational after five weeks of construction, equipped with two fume-producing engines instead of one.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p = 84}} The metal doors, which had been taken from Soviet military bunkers around Białystok, had portholes through which it was possible to observe the dead before removing them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yeger&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p = 84}} Stangl said that the old death chambers were capable of killing 3,000 people in three hours.{{sfn|Arad|1987|p=120|ps = : Stangl trial testimony.}} The new ones had the highest possible &quot;output&quot; of any gas chambers in the three Reinhard death camps and could kill up to 22,000&lt;ref name=&quot;Sumler&quot; /&gt; or 25,000&lt;ref name=&quot;Ainsztein&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L-1mAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Treblinka+25%2C000%22 |title=Jewish Resistance in Nazi-Occupied Eastern Europe |publisher=University of Michigan (reprint) |orig-year=1974|year=2008 |access-date=21 December 2013 |author=Ainsztein, Reuben |page=917 |isbn=978-0-236-15490-6 |format=Google Books snippet view}}&lt;/ref&gt; people every day, a fact which Globocnik once boasted about to [[Kurt Gerstein]], a fellow SS officer from Disinfection Services.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerstein&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ns-archiv.de/verfolgung/gerstein/gerstein-bericht.php |title=Der Gerstein-Bericht |publisher=NS-Archiv |work=Dokumente zum Nationalsozialismus |year=2013 |access-date=26 December 2013 |author=Langowski, Jürgen |trans-title=Gerstein Report by ''Obersturmführer'' Kurt Gerstein | language=de | quote=Original text of the [[Gerstein Report]] signed at Tübingen (Württemberg), Gartenstraße 24, den 4.

The killing process at Treblinka differed significantly from the method used at Auschwitz and Majdanek, where the poison gas [[Zyklon B]] (hydrogen cyanide) was used. At Treblinka, Sobibór, and Bełżec, the victims died from suffocation and [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] from engine exhaust in stationary gas chambers. At [[Chełmno extermination camp|Chełmno]], they were carried within two specially equipped and engineered trucks, driven at a scientifically calculated speed so as to kill the Jews inside it during the trip, rather than force the drivers and guards to kill at the destination. After visiting Treblinka on a guided tour, Auschwitz commandant [[Rudolf Höss]] concluded that using exhaust gas was inferior to the cyanide used at his extermination camp.{{sfn|Shirer|1981|pp=967–968|ps = : Affidavit 5 April 1946 (Hoess, Nuremberg).}} The chambers became silent after 12 minutes{{sfn|Klee|1988|p = 244}} and were closed for 20 minutes or less.{{sfn|Rajzman|1945|loc = U.S. Congress}} According to [[Jankiel Wiernik]], who survived the 1943 prisoner uprising and escaped, when the doors of the gas chambers had been opened, the bodies of the dead were standing and kneeling rather than lying down, due to the severe overcrowding. Dead mothers embraced the bodies of their children.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=102}} Prisoners who worked in the ''Sonderkommandos'' later testified that the dead frequently let out a last gasp of air when they were extracted from the chambers.{{sfn|Klee|1988|p=246}} Some victims showed signs of life during the disposal of the corpses, but the guards routinely refused to react.{{sfn|Rajzman|1945|loc = U.S. Congress}}

The cremations began shortly after Himmler's visit to the camp in late February or early March 1943.{{sfn|Arad|1987|pp=300–301}}

To incinerate bodies, there were large cremation pits constructed at Camp 3 within Treblinka II.{{efn|According to court judgement of the 1st Treblinka trial in Düsseldorf,&lt;ref name=&quot;nizkor.org&quot;/&gt; in the case main proceedings the number of cremation pyres could not be established exactly.}} The burning pyres were used to cremate the new corpses along with the old ones, which had to be dug up as they had been buried during the first six months of the camp's operation. Built under the instructions of [[Herbert Floss|Herbert Floß]], the camp's cremation expert, the pits consisted of railroad rails laid as grates on blocks of concrete. The bodies were placed on rails over wood, splashed with petrol, and burned. It was a harrowing sight, according to Jankiel Wiernik, with the bellies of pregnant women exploding from boiling [[amniotic fluid]].{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|pp= 104–105}}{{sfn|Wiernik|1945|p=13}} He wrote that &quot;the heat radiating from the pits was maddening.&quot;{{sfn|Wiernik|1945|p=13}} The bodies burned for five hours, without the ashing of bones.

The open air burn pits were located east of the new gas chambers and refuelled from 4&amp;nbsp;a.m.{{sfn|Wiernik|1945|loc = chapt. 13}} (or after 5&amp;nbsp;a.m. depending on work-load) to 6&amp;nbsp;p.m. in roughly 5-hour intervals.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=91}} The current camp memorial includes a flat grave marker resembling one of them.

The camp was operated by 20–25 German and Austrian members of the ''[[SS-Totenkopfverbände]]'' and 80–120 ''[[Glossary of Nazi Germany#W|Wachmänner]]'' (&quot;watchmen&quot;) guards who had been trained at a special SS facility in the [[Trawniki concentration camp]] near [[Lublin]], Poland; all ''Wachmänner'' guards were trained at Trawniki.

The work at Treblinka was carried out under threat of death by Jewish prisoners organised into specialised work details. At the Camp 2 ''Auffanglager'' receiving area each squad had a different coloured triangle.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p = 91}} The triangles made it impossible for new arrivals to try to blend in with members of the work details. The blue unit (''Kommando Blau'') managed the rail ramp and unlocked the freight wagons. They met the new arrivals, carried out people who had died en route, removed bundles, and cleaned the wagon floors. The red unit (''Kommando Rot''), which was the largest squad, unpacked and sorted the belongings of victims after they had been &quot;processed&quot;.{{efn|The term ''durchgeschleust'' or &quot;processed&quot; to describe the annihilation of Jews in the occupied Eastern territories appeared in the [[Korherr Report]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ns-archiv.de/verfolgung/korherr/anweisung-himmler.php |title=Anweisung Himmler an Korherr |publisher=Der Reichsführer-SS, Feld-Kommandostelle |date=10 April 1943 |access-date=2 September 2014 |author-link=Richard Korherr |last=Korherr |first=Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the request of [[Heinrich Himmler]], who had objected to the word ''Sonderbehandlung'' or &quot;special treatment&quot; being used for death since 1939 (following Heydrich's 20 September 1939 telegram to the Gestapo).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/quick-facts/special-treatment.shtml |title=&quot;Special treatment&quot; (Sonderbehandlung) |publisher=Holocaust history.org |year=2014 |access-date=2 September 2014 |quote=September 20th, 1939 telegram to Gestapo regional and subregional headquarters on the &quot;basic principles of internal security during the war&quot;. |author=Himmler, Heinrich |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528142643/http://www.holocaust-history.org/quick-facts/special-treatment.shtml |archive-date=28 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The red unit delivered these belongings to the storage barracks, which were managed by the yellow unit (''Kommando Gelb''), who separated the items by quality, removed the [[Yellow badge|Star of David]] from all outer garments, and extracted any money sewn into the linings.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=103}} The yellow unit was followed by the ''Desinfektionskommando'', who disinfected the belongings, including sacks of hair from women who had been killed there. The ''Goldjuden'' unit (&quot;gold Jews&quot;) collected and counted banknotes and evaluated the gold and jewellery.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=89}}

A different group of about 300 men, called the ''Totenjuden'' (&quot;Jews for the dead&quot;), lived and worked in Camp 3 across from the gas chambers. For the first six months they took the corpses away for burial after gold teeth had been extracted. Once cremation began in early 1943 they took the corpses to the pits, refuelled the pyres, crushed the remaining bones with mallets, and collected the ashes for disposal.{{sfn|United States Department of Justice|1994|ps = : Appendix 3: 144.}} Each trainload of &quot;deportees&quot; brought to Treblinka consisted of an average of sixty heavily guarded wagons. They were divided into three sets of twenty at the layover yard. Each set was processed within the first two hours of backing onto the ramp, and was then made ready by the ''Sonderkommandos'' to be exchanged for the next set of twenty wagons.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=97}}

Members of all work units were continuously beaten by the guards and often shot.{{sfn|Arad|2018|pp=249-250}} Replacements were selected from the new arrivals.{{sfn|Arad|2018|p=149}} There were other work details which had no contact with the transports: the ''Holzfällerkommando'' (&quot;woodcutter unit&quot;) cut and chopped firewood, and the ''Tarnungskommando'' (&quot;disguise unit&quot;) camouflaged the structures of the camp. Another work detail was responsible for cleaning the common areas. The Camp 1 ''Wohnlager'' residential compound contained barracks for about 700 ''Sonderkommandos'' which, when combined with the 300 ''Totenjuden'' living across from the gas chambers, brought their grand total to roughly one thousand at a time.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|pp=89–91}}

Many ''Sonderkommando'' prisoners hanged themselves at night. Suicides in the ''Totenjuden'' barracks occurred at the rate of 15 to 20 per day.{{sfn|Wiernik|1945|p=|loc=Chapter 7}} The work crews were almost entirely replaced every few days; members of the old work detail were sent to their deaths except for the most resilient.{{sfn|Arad|2018|pp=256}}

==Treblinka prisoner uprising==

In early 1943, an underground Jewish resistance organisation was formed at Treblinka with the goal of seizing control of the camp and escaping to freedom.&lt;ref name=&quot;remember-me&quot; /&gt; The planned revolt was preceded by a long period of secret preparations.

===Day of the revolt and survivors===
The uprising was launched on the hot summer day of 2 August 1943 (Monday, a regular day of rest from gassing), when a group of Germans and 40 Ukrainians drove off to the [[Bug River|River Bug]] to swim.{{sfn|Smith|2010}} The conspirators silently unlocked the door to the arsenal near the train tracks, with a key that had been duplicated earlier.{{sfn|Rajzman|1945|loc = U.S. Congress}} They had stolen 20–25 rifles, 20 hand grenades, and several pistols,{{sfn|Rajzman|1945|loc = U.S. Congress}} and delivered them in a cart to the gravel work detail. At 3:45&amp;nbsp;p.m., 700 Jews launched an insurgency that lasted for 30 minutes.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p = 110}} They set buildings ablaze, exploded a tank of petrol, and set fire to the surrounding structures. A group of armed Jews attacked the main gate, and others attempted to climb the fence. Machine-gun fire from about 25 Germans and 60 Ukrainian ''Trawnikis'' resulted in near-total slaughter. Lajcher was killed along with most of the insurgents. About 200 Jews{{sfn|Weinfeld|2013|p=43}}{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=110}} escaped from the camp.{{efn|Two hundred is the number accepted by Polish historians and the Treblinka camp museum; the ''Holocaust Encyclopedia'' lists 300, instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;USHMM&quot; /&gt;}} Half of them were killed after a chase in cars and on horses.{{sfn|Rajzman|1945|loc = U.S. Congress}} The Jews did not cut the phone wires,{{sfn|Smith|2010}} and Stangl called in hundreds of German reinforcements,{{sfn|Evans|2008|p = 292}} who arrived from four different towns and set up roadblocks along the way.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=110}} Partisans of the ''[[Armia Krajowa]]'' (Polish: Home Army) transported some of the surviving escapees across the river&lt;ref name=&quot;Śląski-PAX&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://alija.4me.pl/pdf/Pod_gwiazda_Dawida.pdf |title=VII.

===After the uprising===
After the revolt, Stangl met the head of Operation Reinhard, Odilo Globocnik, and inspector [[Christian Wirth]] in Lublin, and decided not to draft a report, as no native Germans had died putting down the revolt.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=111}} Stangl wanted to rebuild the camp, but Globocnik told him it would be closed down shortly and Stangl would be transferred to [[Trieste]] to help fight the partisans there. The Nazi high command may have felt that Stangl, Globocnik, Wirth, and other Reinhard personnel knew too much and wanted to dispose of them by sending them to the [[Front line|front]].{{sfn|Levy|2002|pp=741–742}} With almost all the Jews from the German ghettos (established in Poland) killed, there would have been little point in rebuilding the facility.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=293}} [[Auschwitz]] had enough capacity to fulfil the Nazis' remaining extermination needs, rendering Treblinka redundant.{{sfn|Arad|1987|p = 640}}

The camp's new commandant [[Kurt Franz]], formerly its deputy commandant, took over in August. After the war he testified that gassings had stopped by then.{{sfn|Arad|1987|p = 247}} In reality, despite the extensive damage to the camp, the gas chambers were intact, and the killing of Polish Jews continued. Speed was reduced, with only ten wagons rolled onto the ramp at a time, while the others had to wait.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=112}} The last two rail transports of Jews were brought to the camp for gassing from the [[Białystok Ghetto]] on 18 and 19 August 1943.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=28}} They consisted of 76 wagons (37 the first day and 39 the second), according to a communiqué published by the Office of Information of the ''Armia Krajowa'', based on observation of Holocaust trains passing through the village of Treblinka.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p = 112}}{{sfn|Sereny|2013|p=249}} The 39 wagons that came to Treblinka on 19 August 1943 were carrying at least 7,600 survivors of the [[Białystok Ghetto Uprising]].{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=111}}

On 19 October 1943, Operation Reinhard was terminated by a letter from Odilo Globocnik. The following day, a large group of Jewish ''Arbeitskommandos'' who had worked on dismantling the camp structures over the previous few weeks were loaded onto the train and transported, via [[Siedlce]] and [[Chełm]], to [[Sobibór]] to be gassed on 20 October 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;ARC - Treblinka History&quot; /&gt; Franz followed Globocnik and Stangl to Trieste in November. Clean-up operations continued over the winter. As part of these operations, Jews from the surviving work detail dismantled the gas chambers brick-by-brick and used them to erect a farmhouse on the site of the camp's former bakery. Globocnik confirmed its purpose as a secret guard post for a Nazi-Ukrainian agent to remain behind the scenes, in a letter he sent to Himmler from Trieste on 5 January 1944.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=112}} A ''Hiwi'' guard called Oswald Strebel, a Ukrainian ''Volksdeutscher'' (ethnic German), was given permission to bring his family from Ukraine for &quot;reasons of surveillance&quot;, wrote Globocnik; Strebel had worked as a guard at Treblinka II.{{sfn|Sereny|2013|p=249}} He was instructed to tell visitors that he had been farming there for decades, but the local Poles were well aware of the existence of the camp.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=294}}

==Operational command of Treblinka II==
===Irmfried Eberl===
[[File:Irmfried Eberl.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Irmfried Eberl]], the first commandant of Treblinka II, removed because of his alleged incompetence in running the camp]]
SS-''Obersturmführer'' [[Irmfried Eberl]] was appointed the camp's first commandant on 11 July 1942. He was a [[psychiatrist]] from [[Bernburg Euthanasia Centre]] and the only physician-in-chief to command an extermination camp during World War II.{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=432}} According to some, his poor organisational skills caused the operation of Treblinka to turn disastrous; others point out that the number of transports that were coming in reflected the Nazi high command's wildly unrealistic expectations of Treblinka's ability to &quot;process&quot; these prisoners.{{sfn |Arad|1987|p=87}} The early gassing machinery frequently broke down due to overuse, forcing the SS to shoot Jews assembled for suffocation. The workers did not have enough time to bury them, and the [[mass grave]]s were overflowing.&lt;ref name=&quot;USHMM&quot; /&gt; According to the testimony of his colleague ''Unterscharführer'' [[Hans Hingst]], Eberl's ego and thirst for power exceeded his ability: &quot;So many transports arrived that the disembarkation and gassing of the people could no longer be handled.&quot;{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=432}}{{sfn|Arad|1987|p=87}} On incoming Holocaust trains to Treblinka, many of the Jews locked inside correctly guessed what was going to happen to them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chrostowski&quot; /&gt; The odour of decaying corpses could be smelled up to {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=off}} away.{{sfn|Rees|2005|loc = BBC}}

Oskar Berger, a Jewish eyewitness, one of about 100 people who escaped during the 1943 uprising, told of the camp's state when he arrived there in August 1942:

{{quote|When we were unloaded, we noticed a paralysing view – all over the place there were hundreds of human bodies. Piles of packages, clothes, suitcases, everything in a mess. German and Ukrainian SS-men stood at the corners of the barracks and were shooting blindly into the crowd.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chrostowski&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last=Chrostowski |first=Witold |year=2004 |title=Extermination Camp Treblinka |publisher=Vallentine Mitchell |location=London |page=37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hzdnAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Berger |id=Google Books search inside |access-date=11 September 2013 |isbn=0-85303-456-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When Globocnik made a surprise visit to Treblinka on 26 August 1942 with Christian Wirth and Wirth's adjutant from Bełżec, [[Josef Oberhauser]], Eberl was dismissed on the spot.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=291}} Among the reasons for dismissal were: incompetently disposing of the tens of thousands of dead bodies, using inefficient methods of killing, and not properly concealing the mass killing. Eberl was transferred to Berlin, closer to operational headquarters in [[Hitler's Chancellery]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Eberl&quot; /&gt; where the main architect of the Holocaust, Heinrich Himmler, had just stepped up the pace of the programme.{{sfn|Rees|2005|loc = BBC}}{{sfn|Sereny|2013|p=98}} Globocnik assigned Wirth to remain in Treblinka temporarily to help clean up the camp.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eberl&quot; /&gt; On 28 August 1942, Globocnik suspended deportations. He chose Franz Stangl, who had previously been the commandant of the Sobibór extermination camp, to assume command of the camp as Eberl's successor. Stangl had a reputation as a competent administrator with a good understanding of the project's objectives, and Globocnik trusted that he would be capable of resuming control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eberl&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/ar/treblinka/camprestructure.html | title=The Removal of Dr Eberl and the Re-Organisation of the Camp – August 1942 |publisher=H.E.A.R.T Holocaust Research Project.org |work=Treblinka Death Camp |year=2009 |access-date=1 November 2013 |author1=Webb, Chris |author2=Smart, Victor |quote=''Source:'' Arad, Donat, Sereny et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Franz Stangl===
Stangl arrived at Treblinka in late August 1942. He replaced Eberl on 1 September. Years later, Stangl described what he first saw when he came on the scene, in a 1971 interview with [[Gitta Sereny]]:{{sfn|Sereny|2013|p=157}}

{{quote|The road ran alongside the railway. When we were about fifteen, twenty minutes' drive from Treblinka, we began to see corpses by the line, first just two or three, then more, and as we drove into Treblinka station, there were what looked like hundreds of them – just lying there – they'd obviously been there for days, in the heat. In the station was a train full of Jews, some dead, some still alive&amp;nbsp;... that too, looked as if it had been there for days.{{sfn|Sereny|2013|p=157}} }}

Stangl reorganised the camp, and the transports of Warsaw and [[Radom Ghetto|Radom Jews]] began to arrive again on 3 September 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;USHMM&quot; /&gt; According to Israeli historian [[Yitzhak Arad]], Stangl wanted the camp to look attractive, so he ordered the paths paved in the ''Wohnlager'' administrative compound. Flowers were planted along ''Seidel Straße'' as well as near the SS living quarters.{{sfn|Arad|1987|p=186}} He ordered that all arriving prisoners should be greeted by the SS with a verbal announcement translated by the working Jews.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eberl&quot; /&gt; The deportees were told that they were at a transit point on the way to Ukraine.{{sfn|Klee|1988|p=246}} Some of their questions were answered by Germans wearing lab coats as tools for deception.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=96}} At times Stangl carried a whip and wore a white uniform, so he was nicknamed the &quot;White Death&quot; by prisoners. Although he was directly responsible for the camp's operations, according to his own testimony Stangl limited his contact with Jewish prisoners as much as possible. He claimed that he rarely interfered with the cruel acts perpetrated by his subordinate officers at the camp.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wistrich&quot;&gt;[[Robert S. Wistrich]]. ''Who's Who in Nazi Germany'', pp.&amp;nbsp;295–296. Macmillan, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; He became desensitised to the killings, and came to perceive prisoners not as humans but merely as &quot;cargo&quot; that had to be destroyed, he said.{{sfn|Arad|1987|p=186}}

====Treblinka song====
According to postwar testimonies, when transports were temporarily halted, then-deputy commandant Kurt Franz wrote lyrics to a song meant to celebrate the Treblinka extermination camp. In reality, prisoner Walter Hirsch wrote them for him. The melody came from something Franz remembered from [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]]. The music was upbeat, in the key of [[D (musical note)|D major]]. The song was taught to Jews assigned to work in the ''Sonderkommando''.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=90|loc = section 2}} They were forced to memorise it by nightfall of their first day at the camp.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Lanzmann (director, ''[[Shoah (film)|Shoah]]'', New Yorker Films, 1985, DVD disc 3, ch. 1&lt;!--check disc 3, ch 1--&gt;; Claude Lanzmann, ''Shoah: An Oral History of the Holocaust'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1985, 95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For more about the song, see Erin McGlothlin, &quot;The Voice of the Perpetrator, the Voices of the Survivors&quot;, in Erin Heather McGlothlin, Jennifer M. Kapczynski (eds.), ''Persistent Legacy: The Holocaust and German Studies'', Rochester: Campden House, 2016, 40–49.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Unterscharführer'' [[Franz Suchomel]] recalled the lyrics as follows: &quot;We know only the word of the Commander. / We know only obedience and duty. / We want to keep working, working, / until a bit of luck beckons us some time. Hurray!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;perp&quot;&gt;Suchomel's lyrics in German: ''&quot;Wir kennen nur das Wort des Kommandanten / und nur Gehorsamkeit und Pflicht / Wir wollen weiter, weiter leisten / bis daß das kleine Glück uns einmal winkt.

A musical ensemble was formed, under duress, by [[Artur Gold]], a popular Jewish [[Polish culture in the Interbellum|prewar composer]] from Warsaw. He arranged the theme to the Treblinka song for the {{nobreak|10-piece}} prisoner orchestra which he conducted. Gold arrived in Treblinka in 1942 and played music in the SS mess hall at the ''Wohnlager'' on German orders. He died during the uprising.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=90}}

===Kurt Franz===
After the Treblinka revolt in August 1943, and termination of Operation Reinhard in October 1943, Stangl went with Globocnik to Trieste in northern Italy where SS reinforcements were needed.{{sfn|Arad|1987|p=371}} The third and last Treblinka II commandant was Kurt Franz, nicknamed &quot;Lalka&quot; by the prisoners ({{lang-pl|the doll}}) because he had &quot;an innocent face&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berliner/Biala&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/revolt/berliner.html |title=Meir Berliner – A Brave act of Resistance at Treblinka – Revolt &amp; Resistance |work=Treblinka |publisher=HolocaustResearchProject.org |access-date=31 October 2013 |author1=Stein, Joel |author2=Webb, Chris}} ''Also in:'' {{harvp|Bryant|2014|p=103}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to survivor testimonies, Franz shot and beat prisoners to death for minor infractions or had his dog Barry tear them to pieces.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRP-HS&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/survivor/sperling.html |title=Hershl Sperling – Personal Testimony of the Treblinka Death Camp |work=Treblinka |publisher=HolocaustResearchProject.org |access-date=23 May 2014 |author1=Stein, Joel |author2=Webb, Chris}} ''Also in:'' {{harvp|Bryant|2014|p=103|loc=testimonies of Jakob Jakubowicz and Leo Lewi in Düsseldorf, 1964}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He managed Treblinka II until November 1943. The subsequent clean-up of the Treblinka II perimeter was completed by prisoners of nearby Treblinka I ''Arbeitslager'' in the following months. Franz's deputy was ''[[Hauptscharführer]]'' [[Fritz Küttner]], who maintained a network of informers among the prisoners and did the hands-on killings.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=86}}

Kurt Franz maintained a photo album against orders never to take photographs inside Treblinka. He named it ''Schöne Zeiten'' (&quot;Good Times&quot;). His album is a rare source of images illustrating the mechanised grave digging, brickworks in Małkinia and the Treblinka zoo, among others. Franz was careful not to photograph the gas chambers.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=86}}

The Treblinka I gravel mine functioned at full capacity under the command of Theodor van Eupen until July 1944, with new forced labourers sent to him by ''Kreishauptmann'' Ernst Gramss from Sokołów.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p = 49}} The mass shootings continued into 1944.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p = 112}} With Soviet troops closing in, the last 300 to 700 prisoners disposing of the incriminating evidence were executed by ''Trawnikis'' in late July 1944, long after the camp's official closure.{{sfn|Arad|1987|pp=373–375}}&lt;ref name=&quot;USHMM-Treblinka&quot; /&gt; Strebel, the ethnic German who had been installed in the farmhouse built in place of the camp's original bakery using bricks from the gas chambers, set fire to the building and fled to avoid capture.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=112}}

==Arrival of the Soviets==
In late July 1944, Soviet forces began to approach from the east. The departing Germans, who had already destroyed most direct evidence of genocidal intent, burned surrounding villages to the ground, including 761 buildings in [[Poniatowo, Ostrów Mazowiecka County|Poniatowo]], [[Prostyń]], and [[Grądy, Gmina Małkinia Górna|Grądy]]. Many families were killed.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=30|loc= graph 1}} The fields of grain that had once fed the SS were burned.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p= 402}} On 19 August 1944, German forces blew up the church in Prostyń and its bell tower, the last defensive strongpoint against the Red Army in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rytel-Andrianik/Prostyń&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parafia-prostyn.drohiczyn.opoka.org.pl/ktrojca2.html |title=Kościoły Św.Trójcy |publisher=Drohiczyn Learned Society |work=Historia parafii Prostyń [History of Prostyń congregation] |year=2010 |access-date=9 December 2013 |first=Paweł |last=Rytel-Andrianik |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Soviets entered Treblinka on 16 August, the extermination zone had been levelled, ploughed over, and planted with [[lupin]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;USHMM-Treblinka&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Arad|1987|p=247}} What remained, wrote visiting Soviet war correspondent [[Vasily Grossman]], were small pieces of bone in the soil, human teeth, scraps of paper and fabric, broken dishes, jars, shaving brushes, rusted pots and pans, cups of all sizes, mangled shoes, and lumps of human hair.{{sfn|Grossman|1946|p=406}} The road leading to the camp was pitch black. Until mid-1944 human ashes (up to 20 carts every day) had been regularly strewn by the remaining prisoners along the road for {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=off}} in the direction of Treblinka&amp;nbsp;I.{{sfn|Grossman|1946|p=402}} When the war ended, destitute and starving locals started walking up the Black Road (as they began to call it) in search of man-made nuggets shaped from melted gold in order to buy bread.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=378}}

===Early attempts at preservation===
[[File:Treblinka death camp 2018i.jpg|thumb|Treblinka memorial in 2018. Plaque states [[never again]] in several languages.]]
The new Soviet-installed government did not preserve evidence of the camp. The scene was not legally protected at the conclusion of World War II. In September 1947, 30 students from the local school, led by their teacher Feliks Szturo and priest Józef Ruciński, collected larger bones and skull fragments into farmers' wicker baskets and buried them in a single mound.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|pp=416, 418}} The same year the first remembrance committee ''Komitet Uczczenia Ofiar Treblinki'' (KUOT; Committee for the Remembrance of the Victims of Treblinka) formed in Warsaw, and launched a design competition for the memorial.{{sfn|Kopówka|Rytel-Andrianik|2011|p=117}}

Stalinist officials allocated no funding for the design competition nor for the memorial, and the committee disbanded in 1948; by then many survivors had left the country. In 1949, the town of Sokołów Podlaski protected the camp with a new fence and gate. A work crew with no archaeological experience was sent in to landscape the grounds. In 1958, after the end of [[Stalinism in Poland]], the Warsaw provincial council declared Treblinka to be a place of martyrology.{{efn|&quot;Place of martyrology&quot; is a [[calque]] borrowed from the popular Polish phrase &quot;Miejsce Martyrologii Żydów&quot;, which was introduced by the Act of Parliament ([[Sejm]]) {{nobreak|on 2 July 1947}} in Warsaw.&lt;ref name=&quot;sztetl.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |editor1=Gideon |editor2-last=Bielawski |editor2-first=Krzysztof |editor3-last=Shalom |editor3-first=Yarek |editor4-last=Ciechomska |editor4-first=Anita |editor5-last=Płoszaj |editor5-first=Margaret |editor6-last=Rusiniak-Karwat |editor6-first=Martyn |author-last=Cywiński |author-first=Piotr M.

===Construction of the memorial===
The construction of a monument {{convert|8|m}} tall designed by sculptor [[Franciszek Duszeńko]] was inaugurated on 21 April 1958 with the laying of the cornerstone at the site of the former gas chambers. The sculpture represents the trend toward large avant-garde forms introduced in the 1960s throughout Europe, with a granite tower cracked down the middle and capped by a mushroom-like block carved with abstract reliefs and Jewish symbols.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marcuse-Genre&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.history.ucsb.edu/projects/histpublications/files/07917-2010marcuseahrforumholocaustmemorialsgenre.pdf |title=Holocaust Memorials: The Emergence of a Genre |journal=American Historical Review |date=February 2010 |access-date=23 October 2013 |author=Marcuse, Harold |pages=35–36 of current PDF document |format=PDF file, direct download 26.3 MB |quote=Beginning with the Buchenwald memorial and numerous designs for the Birkenau competition, and continuing with the ''[[Mémorial des Martyrs de la Déportation|Île de la Cité]]'' in Paris, Treblinka, and Yad Vashem near Jerusalem, such experiential spaces have become a hallmark of major Holocaust memorials.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treblinka was declared a national monument of martyrology on 10 May 1964 during an official ceremony attended by 30,000 people.{{efn|''Translation from Polish:'' The official unveiling of the monument took place on 10 May 1964.

Kater timed the swing of his pendulum using the &quot;''method of coincidences''&quot; and measured the distance between the two pivots with a micrometer. After applying corrections for the finite amplitude of swing, the buoyancy of the bob, the barometric pressure and altitude, and temperature, he obtained a value of 39.13929&amp;nbsp;inches for the seconds pendulum at London, in vacuum, at sea level, at 62&amp;nbsp;°F. The largest variation from the mean of his 12 observations was 0.00028 in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Reversible pendulums (known technically as &quot;convertible&quot; pendulums) employing Kater's principle were used for absolute gravity measurements into the 1930s.

=== Later pendulum gravimeters ===
The increased accuracy made possible by Kater's pendulum helped make [[gravimetry]] a standard part of [[geodesy]]. Since the exact location (latitude and longitude) of the 'station' where the gravity measurement was made was necessary, gravity measurements became part of [[surveying]], and pendulums were taken on the great [[geodetic surveying|geodetic surveys]] of the 18th century, particularly the [[Great Trigonometric Survey]] of India.

[[File:Using Kater pendulum in India.png|thumb|250px|Measuring gravity with an invariable pendulum, Madras, India, 1821]]
* '''Invariable pendulums:'''  Kater introduced the idea of ''relative'' gravity measurements, to supplement the ''absolute'' measurements made by a Kater's pendulum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TL4KAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA23 Poynting &amp; Thomson 1904, p.23]&lt;/ref&gt;  Comparing the gravity at two different points was an easier process than measuring it absolutely by the Kater method. All that was necessary was to time the period of an ordinary (single pivot) pendulum at the first point, then transport the pendulum to the other point and time its period there. Since the pendulum's length was constant, from (1) the ratio of the gravitational accelerations was equal to the inverse of the ratio of the periods squared, and no precision length measurements were necessary. So once the gravity had been measured absolutely at some central station, by the Kater or other accurate method, the gravity at other points could be found by swinging pendulums at the central station and then taking them to the other location and timing their swing there. Kater made up a set of &quot;invariable&quot; pendulums, with only one knife edge pivot, which were taken to many countries after first being swung at a central station at [[Kew Observatory]], UK.
* '''Airy's coal pit experiments''': Starting in 1826, using methods similar to Bouguer, British astronomer [[George Airy]] attempted to determine the density of the Earth by pendulum gravity measurements at the top and bottom of a coal mine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The 1826 experiment was aborted by the flooding of the mine, but in 1854 he conducted an improved experiment at the Harton coal mine, using seconds pendulums swinging on agate plates, timed by precision chronometers synchronized by an electrical circuit. He found the lower pendulum was slower by 2.24 seconds per day. This meant that the gravitational acceleration at the bottom of the mine, 1250&amp;nbsp;ft below the surface, was 1/14,000 less than it should have been from the inverse square law; that is the attraction of the spherical shell was 1/14,000 of the attraction of the Earth. From samples of surface rock he estimated the mass of the spherical shell of crust, and from this estimated that the density of the Earth was 6.565 times that of water. Von Sterneck attempted to repeat the experiment in 1882 but found inconsistent results.

[[File:Repsold pendulum.png|thumb|left|65px|Repsold pendulum, 1864]]
* '''Repsold-Bessel pendulum:''' It was time-consuming and error-prone to repeatedly swing the Kater's pendulum and adjust the weights until the periods were equal.  [[Friedrich Bessel]] showed in 1835 that this was unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=A1IqAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA320 Lenzen &amp; Multauf 1964, p.320]&lt;/ref&gt;  As long as the periods were close together, the gravity could be calculated from the two periods and the center of gravity of the pendulum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TL4KAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA18 Poynting &amp; Thompson 1907, p.18]&lt;/ref&gt;  So the reversible pendulum didn't need to be adjustable, it could just be a bar with two pivots. Bessel also showed that if the pendulum was made symmetrical in form about its center, but was weighted internally at one end, the errors due to air drag would cancel out. Further, another error due to the finite diameter of the knife edges could be made to cancel out if they were interchanged between measurements. Bessel didn't construct such a pendulum, but in 1864 Adolf Repsold, under contract by the Swiss Geodetic Commission made a pendulum along these lines.   The Repsold pendulum was about 56&amp;nbsp;cm long and had a period of about {{frac|3|4}} second. It was used extensively by European geodetic agencies, and with the Kater pendulum in the Survey of India. Similar pendulums of this type were designed by Charles Pierce and C. Defforges.

[[File:Mendenhall gravimeter pendulums.jpg|thumb|250px|Pendulums used in Mendenhall gravimeter, 1890]]
* '''Von Sterneck and Mendenhall gravimeters:''' In 1887 Austro-Hungarian scientist Robert von Sterneck developed a small gravimeter pendulum mounted in a temperature-controlled vacuum tank to eliminate the effects of temperature and air pressure. It used a &quot;half-second pendulum,&quot; having a period close to one second, about 25&amp;nbsp;cm long.  The pendulum was nonreversible, so the instrument was used for relative gravity measurements, but their small size made them small and portable. The period of the pendulum was picked off by reflecting the image of an [[electric spark]] created by a precision chronometer off a mirror mounted at the top of the pendulum rod. The Von Sterneck instrument, and a similar instrument developed by Thomas C. Mendenhall of the [[US Coast and Geodetic Survey]] in 1890,&lt;ref name=&quot;NOAA&quot;&gt;{{cite web

:The Mendenhall pendulum was actually a more accurate timekeeper than the highest precision clocks of the time, and as the 'world's best clock' it was used by [[Albert A. Michelson]] in his 1924 measurements of the [[speed of light]] on Mt. Wilson, California.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOAA&quot; /&gt;
* '''Double pendulum gravimeters:''' Starting in 1875, the increasing accuracy of pendulum measurements revealed another source of error in existing instruments: the swing of the pendulum caused a slight swaying of the tripod stand used to support portable pendulums, introducing error. In 1875 Charles S Peirce calculated that measurements of the length of the seconds pendulum made with the Repsold instrument required a correction of 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm due to this error.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=A1IqAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA324 Lenzen &amp; Multauf 1964, p.324]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1880 C. Defforges used a [[Michelson interferometer]] to measure the sway of the stand dynamically, and interferometers were added to the standard Mendenhall apparatus to calculate sway corrections.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=A1IqAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA329 Lenzen &amp; Multauf 1964, p.329]&lt;/ref&gt;  A method of preventing this error was first suggested in 1877 by Hervé Faye and advocated by Peirce, Cellérier and Furtwangler: mount two identical pendulums on the same support, swinging with the same amplitude, 180° out of phase. The opposite motion of the pendulums would cancel out any sideways forces on the support. The idea was opposed due to its complexity, but by the start of the 20th century the Von Sterneck device and other instruments were modified to swing multiple pendulums simultaneously.

They were mounted in a permanently sealed temperature and humidity controlled vacuum chamber. Stray electrostatic charges on the quartz pendulums had to be discharged by exposing them to a radioactive salt before use. The period was detected by reflecting a light beam from a mirror at the top of the pendulum, recorded by a chart recorder and compared to a precision [[crystal oscillator]] calibrated against the [[WWV (radio station)|WWV]] radio time signal. This instrument was accurate to within (0.3–0.5)×10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; (30–50 [[microgal]]s or 3–5&amp;nbsp;nm/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Woolard&quot; /&gt; It was used into the 1960s.

Relative pendulum gravimeters were superseded by the simpler LaCoste zero-length spring gravimeter, invented in 1934 by Lucien LaCoste.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOAA&quot; /&gt;  Absolute (reversible) pendulum gravimeters were replaced in the 1950s by free fall gravimeters, in which a weight is allowed to fall in a vacuum tank and its acceleration is measured by an optical [[interferometer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Torge&quot; /&gt;

== Standard of length ==
Because the [[Gravity of Earth|acceleration of gravity]] is constant at a given point on Earth, the period of a simple pendulum at a given location depends only on its length. Additionally, gravity varies only slightly at different locations. Almost from the pendulum's discovery until the early 19th century, this property led scientists to suggest using a pendulum of a given [[Frequency|period]] as a [[Unit of length|standard of length]].

Until the 19th century, countries based their systems of length measurement on prototypes, metal bar [[primary standard]]s, such as the standard [[yard]] in Britain kept at the Houses of Parliament, and the standard ''[[toise]]'' in France, kept at Paris. These were vulnerable to damage or destruction over the years, and because of the difficulty of comparing prototypes, the same unit often had different lengths in distant towns, creating opportunities for fraud.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matthews2001&quot;&gt;{{cite conference

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] scientists argued for a length standard that was based on some property of nature that could be determined by measurement, creating an indestructible, universal standard. The period of pendulums could be measured very precisely by timing them with clocks that were set by the stars. A pendulum standard amounted to defining the unit of length by the gravitational force of the Earth, for all intents constant, and the second, which was defined by the [[Rotation of the Earth|rotation rate of the Earth]], also constant. The idea was that anyone, anywhere on Earth, could recreate the standard by constructing a pendulum that swung with the defined period and measuring its length.

Virtually all proposals were based on the [[seconds pendulum]], in which each swing (a half [[Frequency|period]]) takes one second, which is about a meter (39&amp;nbsp;inches) long, because by the late 17th century it had become a standard for measuring gravity (see previous section). By the 18th century its length had been measured with sub-millimeter accuracy at a number of cities in Europe and around the world.

The initial attraction of the pendulum length standard was that it was believed (by early scientists such as Huygens and Wren) that gravity was constant over the Earth's surface, so a given pendulum had the same period at any point on Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matthews2001&quot; /&gt;  So the length of the standard pendulum could be measured at any location, and would not be tied to any given nation or region; it would be a truly democratic, worldwide standard. Although Richer found in 1672 that gravity varies at different points on the globe, the idea of a pendulum length standard remained popular, because it was found that gravity only varies with [[latitude]]. Gravitational acceleration increases smoothly from the [[equator]] to the [[Geographical pole|poles]], due to the [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]] shape of the Earth, so at any given latitude (east–west line), gravity was constant enough that the length of a seconds pendulum was the same within the measurement capability of the 18th century. Thus the unit of length could be defined at a given latitude and measured at any point along that latitude. For example, a pendulum standard defined at 45° north latitude, a popular choice, could be measured in parts of France, Italy, Croatia, Serbia, Romania, Russia, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia, the United States and Canada. In addition, it could be recreated at any location at which the gravitational acceleration had been accurately measured.

By the mid 19th century, increasingly accurate pendulum measurements by [[Edward Sabine]] and [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] revealed that gravity, and thus the length of any pendulum standard, varied measurably with local geologic features such as mountains and dense subsurface rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  So a pendulum length standard had to be defined at a single point on Earth and could only be measured there. This took much of the appeal from the concept, and efforts to adopt pendulum standards were abandoned.

=== Early proposals ===

:Upon the bench I will so handle ‘em
:That the vibration of this pendulum
:Shall make all taylors’ yards of one
:Unanimous opinion
In 1671 [[Jean Picard]] proposed a pendulum-defined 'universal foot' in his influential ''Mesure de la Terre''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_uYCNFkRgXCoC/page/n143 &lt;!-- pg=131 --&gt; Zupko, 1990, p.131]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gabriel Mouton]] around 1670 suggested defining the ''[[toise]]'' either by a seconds pendulum or a minute of terrestrial degree. A plan for a complete system of units based on the pendulum was advanced in 1675 by Italian polymath Tito Livio Burratini. In France in 1747, geographer [[Charles Marie de la Condamine]] proposed defining length by a seconds pendulum at the equator; since at this location a pendulum's swing wouldn't be distorted by the Earth's rotation. [[James Steuart (economist)|James Steuart]] (1780) and [[George Skene Keith]] were also supporters.

By the end of the 18th century, when many nations were reforming their [[Weights and measures|weight and measure systems]], the [[seconds pendulum]] was the leading choice for a new definition of length, advocated by prominent scientists in several major nations. In 1790, then US Secretary of State [[Thomas Jefferson]] proposed to Congress a comprehensive decimalized US 'metric system' based on the seconds pendulum at 38° North latitude, the mean latitude of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_uYCNFkRgXCoC/page/n143 &lt;!-- pg=131 --&gt; Zupko, 1990, p.140-141]&lt;/ref&gt;  No action was taken on this proposal. In Britain the leading advocate of the pendulum was politician [[John Riggs Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_uYCNFkRgXCoC/page/n143 &lt;!-- pg=131 --&gt; Zupko, 1990, p.93]&lt;/ref&gt;  When his efforts to promote a joint British–French–American metric system fell through in 1790, he proposed a British system based on the length of the seconds pendulum at London. This standard was adopted in 1824 (below).

=== The metre ===
In the discussions leading up to the French adoption of the [[metric system]] in 1791, the leading candidate for the definition of the new unit of length, the [[metre]], was the seconds pendulum at 45° North latitude. It was advocated by a group led by French politician [[Talleyrand]] and mathematician [[Marquis de Condorcet|Antoine Nicolas Caritat de Condorcet]]. This was one of the three final options considered by the [[French Academy of Sciences]] committee. However, on March 19, 1791 the committee instead chose to base the metre on the length of the [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] through Paris. A pendulum definition was rejected because of its variability at different locations, and because it defined length by a unit of time. (However, since 1983 the metre has been officially defined in terms of the length of the second and the speed of light.) A possible additional reason is that the radical French Academy didn't want to base their new system on the second, a traditional and nondecimal unit from the ''[[ancien regime]]''.

Although not defined by the pendulum, the final length chosen for the metre, 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; of the pole-to-equator [[meridian arc]], was very close to the length of the seconds pendulum (0.9937 m), within 0.63%. Although no reason for this particular choice was given at the time, it was probably to facilitate the use of the seconds pendulum as a secondary standard, as was proposed in the official document. So the modern world's standard unit of length is certainly closely linked historically with the seconds pendulum.

=== Britain and Denmark ===
Britain and Denmark appear to be the only nations that (for a short time) based their units of length on the pendulum. In 1821 the Danish inch was defined as 1/38 of the length of the mean solar seconds pendulum at 45° latitude at the meridian of [[Skagen]], at sea level, in vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This also became the US standard, since at the time the US used British measures. However, when the prototype yard was lost in the [[Burning of Parliament|1834 Houses of Parliament fire]], it proved impossible to recreate it accurately from the pendulum definition, and in 1855 Britain repealed the pendulum standard and returned to prototype standards.

== Other uses ==

=== Seismometers ===
A pendulum in which the rod is not vertical but almost horizontal was used in early [[seismometers]] for measuring earth tremors. The bob of the pendulum does not move when its mounting does, and the difference in the movements is recorded on a drum chart.

=== Schuler tuning ===
{{Main|Schuler tuning}}
As first explained by [[Max Schuler|Maximilian Schuler]] in a 1923 paper, a pendulum whose period exactly equals the orbital period of a hypothetical satellite orbiting just above the surface of the earth (about 84 minutes) will tend to remain pointing at the center of the earth when its support is suddenly displaced. This principle, called [[Schuler tuning]], is used in [[inertial guidance system]]s in ships and aircraft that operate on the surface of the Earth. No physical pendulum is used, but the [[control system]] that keeps the [[inertial platform]] containing the [[gyroscope]]s stable is modified so the device acts as though it is attached to such a pendulum, keeping the platform always facing down as the vehicle moves on the curved surface of the Earth.

=== Coupled pendulums ===
[[File:Coupled oscillators.gif|frame|Two pendulums with the same period coupled by suspending them from a common support string. The oscillation alternates between the two.]]
[[File:Huygens synchronization of two clocks (Experiment).jpg|thumbnail|left|100px|Repetition of Huygens experiment showing synchronization of two clocks]]
In 1665 Huygens made a curious observation about pendulum clocks. Two clocks had been placed on his [[mantlepiece]], and he noted that they had acquired an opposing motion. That is, their pendulums were beating in unison but in the opposite direction; 180° [[out of phase]]. Regardless of how the two clocks were started, he found that they would eventually return to this state, thus making the first recorded observation of a [[Coupled oscillation|coupled oscillator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The cause of this behavior was that the two pendulums were affecting each other through slight motions of the supporting mantlepiece. This process is called [[entrainment (physics)|entrainment]] or [[mode locking]] in physics and is observed in other coupled oscillators. Synchronized pendulums have been used in clocks and were widely used in [[gravimeter]]s in the early 20th century. Although Huygens only observed out-of-phase synchronization, recent investigations have shown the existence of in-phase synchronization, as well as &quot;death&quot; states wherein one or both clocks stops.&lt;ref&gt;A.L. Fradkov and B. Andrievsky, &quot;Synchronization and phase relations in the motion of two-pendulum system&quot;, International Journal of Non-linear Mechanics, vol. 42 (2007), pp. 895–901.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I.I.

=== Religious practice ===
[[File:Catedral Metropolitana, México D.F., México, 2013-10-16, DD 89.JPG|thumb|Pendulum in the Metropolitan Cathedral, Mexico City.]]
Pendulum motion appears in religious ceremonies as well. The swinging [[incense]] burner called a [[censer]], also known as a [[thurible]], is an example of a pendulum.&lt;ref&gt;An interesting simulation of thurible motion can be found at [http://www.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/physique/perso/gtulloue/Meca/Oscillateurs/botafumeiro.html#manip this site].&lt;/ref&gt;  Pendulums are also seen at many gatherings in eastern Mexico where they mark the turning of the tides on the day which the tides are at their highest point. See also [[pendulums for divination and dowsing]].

=== Education ===

Pendulums are widely used in [[science education]] as an example of a [[harmonic oscillator]], to teach [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] and [[oscillatory motion]].  One use is to demonstrate the law of [[conservation of energy]].&lt;ref name=Hart&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hart|first1=Matthew|title=Physics Risks Death by Wrecking Ball for Science|url=http://nerdist.com/physics-risks-death-by-wrecking-ball-for-science/|website=Nerdist|access-date=14 March 2017|language=en|date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sorenson|first1=Roy|editor1-last=Booth|editor1-first=Anthony Robert|editor2-last=Rowbottom|editor2-first=Darrell P.|title=Intuitions|date=2014|publisher=Oxford Univ Pr|isbn=9780199609192|page=139|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ttX1AwAAQBAJ&amp;q=bowling+ball+pendulum+experiment&amp;pg=PA139|access-date=15 March 2017|chapter=Novice Thought Experiments}}&lt;/ref&gt; A heavy object such as a [[bowling ball]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bowling Ball Pendulum|url=http://wonders.physics.wisc.edu/bowling-ball-pendulum.htm|website=The Wonders of Physics|publisher=University of Wisconsin–Madison|access-date=14 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[wrecking ball]]&lt;ref name=Hart/&gt; is attached to a string.

=== Torture device ===
It is claimed that the pendulum was used as an instrument of [[torture]] and [[execution]] by the [[Spanish Inquisition]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The only evidence of its use is one paragraph in the preface to Llorente's  1826 ''History'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Llorente&quot; /&gt; relating a second-hand account by a single prisoner released from the Inquisition's Madrid dungeon in 1820, who purportedly described the pendulum torture method.   Modern sources point out that due to Jesus' admonition against bloodshed, Inquisitors were only allowed to use torture methods which did not spill blood, and the pendulum method would have violated this stricture.  One theory is that Llorente misunderstood the account he heard; the prisoner was actually referring to another common Inquisition torture, the ''[[strappado]]'' (garrucha), in which the prisoner has his hands tied behind his back and is hoisted off the floor by a rope tied to his hands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pavlac&quot; /&gt; This method was also known as the &quot;pendulum&quot;.  Poe's popular horror tale, and public awareness of the Inquisition's other brutal methods, has kept the myth of this elaborate torture method alive.

== Notes ==
{{Reflist|group=Note}}
The value of g reflected by the period of a pendulum varies from place to place. The gravitational force varies with distance from the center of the Earth, i.e. with altitude - or because the Earth's shape is oblate, g varies  with latitude.
A more important cause of this reduction in g at the equator is because the equator is spinning at one revolution per day, so the acceleration by the gravitational force is partially canceled there by the [[centrifugal force]].

'''Special Olympics''' is the world's largest sports organization for children and adults with [[intellectual disabilities]] and physical disabilities, providing year-round training and activities to 5 million participants and Unified Sports partners in 172 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/press/releases/SpecialOlympicsat50 |title=Smithsonian Highlights Special Olympics History and Athletes |date=July 6, 2018 |website=National Museum of American History |language=en |access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Special Olympics competitions are held every day, all around the world—including local, national and regional competitions, adding up to more than 100,000 events a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reach&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://media.specialolympics.org/resources/reports/reach-reports/2016_ReachReport_Final_4Pager.pdf |title=2016 Reach Report |website=Special Olympics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[International Paralympic Committee]], the Special  Olympics organization is recognized by the [[International Olympic Committee]]; however, unlike the Paralympic Games, Special Olympics World Games are not held in the same year or in conjunction with the Olympic Games.

The [[Special Olympics World Games]] is a major event put on by the Special Olympics. The World Games alternate between summer and winter games, in two-year cycles, recurring every fourth year. The first games were held on July 20, 1968 in [[Chicago]], Illinois, with about 1000 athletes from the U.S. and Canada. At those first games, honorary event chair [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver]] announced the formation of the Special Olympics organization.  International participation expanded in subsequent games.  In 2003, the first summer games held outside the United States were in [[Dublin]], Ireland with 7000 athletes from 150 countries. The most recent World Summer Games were held in [[Abu Dhabi]], United Arab Emirates from March 14 to 21 2019. This was the first Special Olympics World Games to be held in the Middle East. The next World Summer Games will be held in [[Berlin]], Germany between June 16 to 25, 2023. This will be the first time for Germany to host the Special Olympics World Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.specialolympics.org/about/press-releases/berlin-germany-selected-to-host-the-2023-special-olympics-world-games|title=Berlin, Germany selected to host the 2023 Special Olympics World Games|publisher=Special Olympics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first World Winter Games were held in 1977 in [[Steamboat Springs, Colorado|Steamboat Springs]], Colorado, US. [[Austria]] hosted the first Winter Games outside the United States in 1993. The most recent Special Olympics World Winter Games were held in [[Graz]], [[Schladming]] and [[Ramsau am Dachstein|Ramsau]], Austria from March 14, 2017 to March 25, 2017 (see also [[2017 Special Olympics World Winter Games]]).

==History==
In June 1963, [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver]] started a day camp called [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver|Camp Shriver]] for children with intellectual and physical disabilities at her home in [[Potomac, Maryland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;so-history&quot;/&gt; The camp sought to address the concern that children with disabilities had very little opportunity to participate in organised athletic events. With Camp Shriver as an example, Kennedy Shriver, head of the [[Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation]] and a member of President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s Panel on Mental Retardation, promoted the concept of involvement in physical activity and other opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/JFK-Legacy/JFK-and-Disability.aspx|title=JFK and Disabilities – John F. Kennedy Presidential Library &amp; Museum|website=www.jfklibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camp Shriver became an annual event, and the Kennedy Foundation gave grants to universities, recreation departments, and community centers to hold similar camps.

Also in the early 1960s, Kennedy Shriver wrote an article in the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', revealing that her sister [[Rosemary Kennedy|Rosemary]], also President John F. Kennedy's sister, was born with intellectual disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2009/08/13/history/post-perspective/eunice-kennedy-shriver-19212009.html|title=Eunice Kennedy Shriver 1921–2009 – The Saturday Evening Post|first=The Saturday Evening Post|last=Society|website=www.saturdayeveningpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This frank article about the President's family was seen as a &quot;watershed&quot; in changing public attitudes toward people with intellectual disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Rosemary's disability provided Kennedy Shriver with an overall vision that people with intellectual disabilities could compete and at the same time unify in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.goodnet.org/articles/10-facts-about-special-olympics-list-1|title=10 Facts about the Special Olympics [LIST] – Goodnet|work=Goodnet|access-date=2017-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has often been said that Rosemary's disability was Eunice's inspiration to form Special Olympics (as the movement came to be called), but she told ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1995 that that was not exactly the case. &quot;The games should not focus on one individual,&quot; she said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Johnson, Kirk|title=Reaching the Retarded: An Old Kennedy Mission|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/23/nyregion/reaching-the-retarded-an-old-kennedy-mission.html|work=The New York Times|date=June 23, 1995|access-date=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Dr. James N. Oliver of England had conducted pioneering research, including a ground-breaking study showing that physical exercise and activities for children with intellectual disabilities had positive effects that also carried over into the classroom (&quot;The Effects of Physical Conditioning Exercises and Activities on the Mental Characteristics of Educationally Sub-Normal Boys, British Journal of Educational Psychology, XXVIII, June 1958).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychsource.bps.org.uk/details/journalArticle/3584061/THE-EFFECT-OF-PHYSICAL-CONDITIONING-EXERCISES-AND-ACTIVITIES-ON-THE-MENTAL-CHARA.html|title=THE EFFECT OF PHYSICAL CONDITIONING EXERCISES AND ACTIVITIES ON THE MENTAL CHARACTERISTICS OF EDUCATIONALLY SUB‐NORMAL BOYS – PsychSource|website=psychsource.bps.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Oliver in 1964 served as a consultant to Camp Shriver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/Sections/What_We_Do/Out_of_the_Shadows__Events_Leading_to_the_Founding_of_Special_Olympics.aspx|title=Special Olympics: Out of the Shadows: Events Leading to the Founding of Special Olympics|website=www.specialolympics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1964 research of Dr. [[Frank Hayden]], a Canadian physical education professor from London, Ontario, demonstrated that persons with intellectual disabilities can and should participate in physical exercise. He believed that the benefits of such activity would be seen in all areas of the athletes' lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kch.uiuc.edu/Alumni/Hayden.aspx|title=Welcome to Kinesiology &amp; Community Health – Kinesiology &amp; Community Health|website=www.kch.uiuc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of a local school that offered space in its gym, Hayden started one of the first public organised sports programs, [[floor hockey]] for individuals with intellectual disabilities, in the fall of 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ottawa.specialolympicsontario.ca/about-us|title=About Us – Special Olympics Ontario – Greater Ottawa|website=ottawa.specialolympicsontario.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the mid-1960s, Hayden also developed an idea for national games, and his work brought him to the attention of the Kennedy Foundation. He shared his ideas for national games, while taking a teaching sabbatical and working for the foundation.&lt;ref name=Moczulski&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/article-how-the-special-olympics-were-born/ |title=How the Special Olympics were born |last=Moczulski |first=J.P.  |date=July 16, 2018 |work=Globe and Mail |access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Special Olympics games were held on July 20, 1968, at [[Soldier Field]] in Chicago. About 1,000 athletes from the U.S. and Canada took part in the one-day event, which was a joint venture by the Kennedy Foundation and the [[Chicago Park District]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.specialolympics.org/about/history/out-of-the-shadows-events-leading-to-the-founding-of-special-olympics|title=Out of the Shadows: Events Leading to the Founding of |publisher=Special Olympics |access-date=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Anne McGlone Burke]], then a physical education teacher with the Chicago Park District,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.niu.edu/1998/ip980517.html |title=Feature Article |publisher=Lib.niu.edu |date=1968-07-20 |access-date=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; began with the idea for a one-time, city-wide, Olympic-style athletic competition for people with special needs. Burke approached the Kennedy Foundation in 1967 to fund the event.

Where water levels from the irrigation source permit, the levels are controlled by dikes, usually plugged by soil. This is often seen in terraced rice fields (rice paddies), where the method is used to flood or control the level of water in each distinct field. In some cases, the water is pumped, or lifted by human or animal power to the level of the land. The water application efficiency of surface irrigation is typically lower than other forms of irrigation.
[[File:Residential flood irrigation in Phoenix, Arizona, in the United States of America.jpg|thumb|Residential flood irrigation in Phoenix, Arizona]]
Surface irrigation is even used to water landscapes in certain areas, for example, in and around [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. The irrigated area is surrounded by a [[berm]] and the water is delivered according to a schedule set by a local [[irrigation district]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flood Irrigation Service|url=http://www.tempe.gov/home/showdocument?id=3194|publisher=City of Tempe, Arizona|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Micro-irrigation===
{{Main|Micro-irrigation}}
[[File:Dripperwithdrop.png|thumb|Drip irrigation – a dripper in action]]
''Micro-irrigation'', sometimes called '''localized irrigation''', '''low volume irrigation''', or '''trickle irrigation''' is a system where water is distributed under low pressure through a piped network, in a pre-determined pattern, and applied as a small discharge to each plant or adjacent to it. Traditional drip irrigation use individual emitters, subsurface drip irrigation (SDI), micro-spray or micro-sprinklers, and mini-bubbler irrigation all belong to this category of irrigation methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Frenken | first1 = K. | title = Irrigation in Africa in figures&amp;nbsp;– AQUASTAT Survey&amp;nbsp;– 2005 | booktitle = Water Report 29 | publisher = Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations | year = 2005 | url = ftp://ftp.fao.org/agl/aglw/docs/wr29_eng.pdf | isbn = 978-92-5-105414-7 | accessdate = 2007-03-14 }}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Drip irrigation ====
[[File:dripirrigation.gif|thumb|left|Drip irrigation layout and its parts]]
{{Main|Drip irrigation}}
[[File:Sprinkler Irrigation - Sprinkler head.JPG|thumb|Micro-sprinkler]]
Drip (or micro) irrigation, also known as trickle irrigation, functions as its name suggests. In this system water falls drop by drop just at the position of roots. Water is delivered at or near the [[root]] zone of plants, drop by drop. This method can be the most water-efficient method of irrigation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Provenzano | first = Giuseppe | title = Using HYDRUS-2D Simulation Model to Evaluate Wetted Soil Volume in Subsurface Drip Irrigation Systems | journal = Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering| volume = 133 | issue = 4 | pages = 342–350 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9437(2007)133:4(342)}}&lt;/ref&gt; if managed properly, evaporation and runoff are minimized. The field [[water efficiency]] of drip irrigation is typically in the range of 80 to 90 percent when managed correctly.

In modern agriculture, drip irrigation is often combined with [[plastic mulch]], further reducing evaporation, and is also the means of delivery of fertilizer. The process is known as ''[[fertigation]]''.

Deep percolation, where water moves below the root zone, can occur if a drip system is operated for too long or if the delivery rate is too high. Drip irrigation methods range from very high-tech and computerized to low-tech and labor-intensive. Lower water pressures are usually needed than for most other types of systems, with the exception of low energy center pivot systems and surface irrigation systems, and the system can be designed for uniformity throughout a field or for precise water delivery to individual plants in a landscape containing a mix of plant species. Although it is difficult to regulate pressure on steep slopes, pressure compensating [[Drip irrigation#Emitter|emitters]] are available, so the field does not have to be level. High-tech solutions involve precisely calibrated emitters located along lines of tubing that extend from a computerized set of [[valves]].

=== Sprinkler irrigation ===
[[File:Crop sprinklers Rio Vista California 15 Jul 2004-002.jpg|thumb|Crop sprinklers near [[Rio Vista, California]]]]
[[File:TravellingSprinkler.JPG|thumb|A traveling sprinkler at Millets Farm Centre, [[Oxfordshire]], United Kingdom]]
{{Further|Irrigation sprinkler}}
In ''sprinkler'' or overhead irrigation, water is piped to one or more central locations within the field and distributed by overhead high-pressure sprinklers or guns. A system using sprinklers, sprays, or guns mounted overhead on permanently installed risers is often referred to as a ''solid-set'' irrigation system. Higher pressure sprinklers that rotate are called ''rotors'' and are driven by a ball drive, gear drive, or impact mechanism. Rotors can be designed to rotate in a full or partial circle. Guns are similar to rotors, except that they generally operate at very high pressures of 275 to 900 kPa (40 to 130 psi) and flows of 3 to 76 L/s (50 to 1200 US gal/min), usually with nozzle diameters in the range of 10 to 50&amp;nbsp;mm (0.5 to 1.9 in). Guns are used not only for irrigation, but also for industrial applications such as dust suppression and [[logging]].

Sprinklers can also be mounted on moving platforms connected to the water source by a hose. Automatically moving wheeled systems known as ''traveling sprinklers'' may irrigate areas such as small farms, sports fields, parks, pastures, and cemeteries unattended. Most of these use a length of polyethylene tubing wound on a steel drum. As the tubing is wound on the drum powered by the irrigation water or a small gas engine, the sprinkler is pulled across the field. When the sprinkler arrives back at the reel the system shuts off. This type of system is known to most people as a &quot;waterreel&quot; traveling irrigation sprinkler and they are used extensively for dust suppression, irrigation, and land application of waste water.

Other travelers use a flat rubber hose that is dragged along behind while the sprinkler platform is pulled by a cable.

==== Center pivot ====

[[File:Crop Triangle South Africa.jpg|alt=Center pivot irrigation|center|thumb|[[Center pivot irrigation]]]]
Center pivot irrigation is a form of sprinkler irrigation utilising several segments of pipe (usually galvanized steel or aluminium) joined together and supported by [[truss]]es, mounted on wheeled towers with sprinklers positioned along its length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The system moves in a circular pattern and is fed with water from the pivot point at the center of the arc. These systems are found and used in all parts of the world and allow irrigation of all types of terrain. Newer systems have drop sprinkler heads as shown in the image that follows.

{{As of | 2017}} most center pivot systems have drops hanging from a U-shaped pipe attached at the top of the pipe with sprinkler heads that are positioned a few feet (at most) above the crop, thus limiting evaporative losses. Drops can also be used with drag hoses or bubblers that deposit the water directly on the ground between crops. Crops are often planted in a circle to conform to the center pivot. This type of system is known as LEPA ([[Low Energy Precision Application]]). Originally, most center pivots were water-powered. These were replaced by hydraulic systems (''[[T-L Irrigation]]'') and electric-motor-driven systems (Reinke, Valley, Zimmatic). Many modern pivots feature [[GPS]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.agriculture.com/machinery/irrigation-equipment/gps-swing-arms-prove-their-worth|title=GPS SWING ARMS PROVE THEIR WORTH|last=Gaines|first=Tharran|date=January 7, 2017|website=Successful Farming|access-date=February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Irrigation by lateral move (side roll, wheel line, wheelmove)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peters|first1=Troy|title=Managing Wheel ‐ Lines and Hand ‐ Lines for High Profitability|url=http://irrigation.wsu.edu/Content/Fact-Sheets/Set-Move-Management.pdf|accessdate=29 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021014252/http://irrigation.wsu.edu/Content/Fact-Sheets/Set-Move-Management.pdf|archive-date=21 October 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill|first1=Robert|title=Wheelmove Sprinkler Irrigation Operation and Management|url=http://extension.usu.edu/files/publications/publication/ENGR_BIE_WM_08.pdf|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====

A ''series of pipes, each with a wheel'' of about 1.5 m diameter permanently affixed to its midpoint, and sprinklers along its length, are coupled together. Water is supplied at one end using a large hose. After sufficient irrigation has been applied to one strip of the field, the hose is removed, the water drained from the system, and the assembly rolled either by hand or with a purpose-built mechanism, so that the sprinklers are moved to a different position across the field. The hose is reconnected. The process is repeated in a pattern until the whole field has been irrigated.

This system is less expensive to install than a center pivot, but much more labor-intensive to operate – it does not travel automatically across the field: it applies water in a stationary strip, must be drained, and then rolled to a new strip. Most systems use 100 or 130&amp;nbsp;mm (4 or 5 inch) diameter aluminum pipe. The pipe doubles both as water transport and as an axle for rotating all the wheels. A drive system (often found near the centre of the wheel line) rotates the clamped-together pipe sections as a single axle, rolling the whole wheel line. Manual adjustment of individual wheel positions may be necessary if the system becomes misaligned.

Wheel line systems are limited in the amount of water they can carry, and limited in the height of crops that can be irrigated. One useful feature of a lateral move system is that it consists of sections that can be easily disconnected, adapting to field shape as the line is moved. They are most often used for small, rectilinear, or oddly-shaped fields, hilly or mountainous regions, or in regions where labor is inexpensive.

==== Lawn sprinkler systems ====
A lawn sprinkler system is permanently installed, as opposed to a hose-end sprinkler, which is portable. Sprinkler systems are installed in residential lawns, in commercial landscapes, for churches and schools, in public parks and cemeteries, and on [[golf course]]s. Most of the components of these irrigation systems are hidden under ground, since aesthetics are important in a landscape. A typical lawn sprinkler system will consist of one or more zones, limited in size by the capacity of the water source. Each zone will cover a designated portion of the landscape. Sections of the landscape will usually be divided by [[microclimate]], type of plant material, and type of irrigation equipment. A landscape irrigation system may also include zones containing drip irrigation, bubblers, or other types of equipment besides sprinklers.

Although manual systems are still used, most lawn sprinkler systems may be operated automatically using an [[Controller (irrigation)|irrigation controller]], sometimes called a clock or timer. Most automatic systems employ electric [[solenoid valve]]s. Each zone has one or more of these valves that are wired to the controller. When the controller sends power to the valve, the valve opens, allowing water to flow to the sprinklers in that zone.

There are two main types of sprinklers used in lawn irrigation, pop-up spray heads and rotors. Spray heads have a fixed spray pattern, while rotors have one or more streams that rotate. Spray heads are used to cover smaller areas, while rotors are used for larger areas. Golf course rotors are sometimes so large that a single sprinkler is combined with a valve and called a 'valve in head'. When used in a turf area, the sprinklers are installed with the top of the head flush with the ground surface. When the system is pressurized, the head will pop up out of the ground and water the desired area until the valve closes and shuts off that zone. Once there is no more pressure in the lateral line, the sprinkler head will retract back into the ground. In flower beds or shrub areas, sprinklers may be mounted on above ground risers or even taller pop-up sprinklers may be used and installed flush as in a lawn area.
[[File:Irrigational sprinkler.jpg|thumb|An [[impact sprinkler]] watering a lawn, an example of a hose-end sprinkler]]

==== Hose-end sprinklers ====
There are many types of hose-end sprinklers. Many of them are smaller versions of larger agricultural and landscape sprinklers, sized to work with a typical garden hose. Some have a spiked base allowing them to be temporarily stuck in the ground, while others have a sled base designed to be dragged while attached to the hose.

=== Subirrigation ===
[[Subirrigation]] has been used for many years in field crops in areas with high [[water table]]s. It is a method of artificially raising the water table to allow the [[soil]] to be [[wikt:moisten|moistened]] from below the plants' [[root]] zone. Often those systems are located on permanent grasslands in lowlands or river valleys and combined with drainage infrastructure. A system of pumping stations, canals, weirs and gates allows it to increase or decrease the water level in a network of ditches and thereby control the water table.

Subirrigation is also used in the [[commerce|commercial]] [[greenhouse]] production, usually for [[potted plant]]s. Water is delivered from below, absorbed by upwards, and the excess collected for recycling. Typically, a solution of water and [[nutrient]]s floods a container or flows through a trough for a short period of time, 10–20 minutes, and is then pumped back into a holding [[Water tank|tank]] for reuse. Sub-irrigation in greenhouses requires fairly sophisticated, expensive equipment and management. Advantages are water and nutrient conservation, and labor savings through reduced system maintenance and [[automation]]. It is similar in principle and action to subsurface basin irrigation.

Another type of subirrigation is the self-watering container, also known as a [[sub-irrigated planter]]. This consists of a planter suspended over a reservoir with some type of wicking material such as a polyester rope. The water is drawn up the wick through capillary action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entheogen.com/forum/showthread.php?t=13076 |title=Polyester ropes natural irrigation technique |publisher=Entheogen.com |accessdate=2012-06-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412031536/http://www.entheogen.com/forum/showthread.php?t=13076 |archivedate=April 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.instructables.com/id/Self-watering-recycled-plant-pot-for-growing-herbs/ |title=DIY instructions for making self-watering system using ropes |publisher=Instructables.com |date=2008-03-17 |accessdate=2012-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar technique is the [[wicking bed]]; this too uses capillary action.

==== Subsurface textile irrigation ====
{{Main|Subsurface textile irrigation}}
[[File:SSTI Cross-Section.png|thumb|Diagram showing the structure of an example SSTI installation]]
Subsurface Textile Irrigation (SSTI) is a technology designed specifically for subirrigation in all soil textures from desert sands to heavy clays. A typical subsurface textile irrigation system has an impermeable base layer (usually [[polyethylene]] or [[polypropylene]]), a drip line running along that base, a layer of [[geotextile]] on top of the drip line and, finally, a narrow impermeable layer on top of the geotextile (see diagram). Unlike standard drip irrigation, the spacing of emitters in the drip pipe is not critical as the geotextile moves the water along the fabric up to 2&amp;nbsp;m from the dripper. The impermeable layer effectively creates an artificial water table.

== Water sources ==
[[File:Pump-enabled Riverside Irrigation in Comilla, Bangladesh, 25 April 2014.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|right|Irrigation is underway by [[Pump|pump-enabled]] extraction directly from [[Gumti River (Tripura)|the Gumti]], seen in the background, in [[Comilla District|Comilla]], [[Bangladesh]].]]

Irrigation water can come from groundwater (extracted from [[Spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] or by using [[Water well|wells]]), from surface water (withdrawn from [[river]]s, [[lake]]s or [[reservoirs]]) or from non-conventional sources like [[reclaimed water|treated wastewater]], [[desalinated water]], [[drainage water]], or [[fog collection]]. A special form of irrigation using surface water is [[spate irrigation]], also called [[floodwater harvesting]]. In case of a flood (spate), water is diverted to normally dry river beds (wadis) using a network of dams, gates and channels and spread over large areas. The moisture stored in the soil will be used thereafter to grow crops. Spate irrigation areas are in particular located in semi-arid or arid, mountainous regions. While floodwater harvesting belongs to the accepted irrigation methods, [[rainwater harvesting]] is usually not considered as a form of irrigation. Rainwater harvesting is the collection of runoff water from roofs or unused land and the concentration of this.

Around 90% of wastewater produced globally remains untreated, causing widespread water [[pollution]], especially in low-income countries. Increasingly, agriculture uses untreated wastewater as a source of irrigation water. Cities provide lucrative markets for fresh produce, so are attractive to farmers. However, because agriculture has to compete for increasingly scarce water resources with industry and municipal users (see Water scarcity below), there is often no alternative for farmers but to use water polluted with urban waste, including sewage, directly to water their crops. Significant health hazards can result from using water loaded with pathogens in this way, especially if people eat raw vegetables that have been irrigated with the polluted water. The [[International Water Management Institute]] has worked in India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Ghana, Ethiopia, Mexico and other countries on various projects aimed at assessing and reducing risks of wastewater irrigation. They advocate a 'multiple-barrier' approach to wastewater use, where farmers are encouraged to adopt various risk-reducing behaviours. These include ceasing irrigation a few days before harvesting to allow pathogens to die off in the sunlight, applying water carefully so it does not contaminate leaves likely to be eaten raw, cleaning vegetables with disinfectant or allowing fecal sludge used in farming to dry before being used as a human manure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Water_Issue_Briefs/index.aspx Wastewater use in agriculture: ''Not only an issue where water is scarce!''] [[International Water Management Institute]], 2010. Water Issue Brief 4&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] has developed guidelines for safe water use.

In countries where humid air sweeps through at night, water can be obtained by [[condensation]] onto cold surfaces. This is practiced in the vineyards at [[Lanzarote]] using stones to condense water. Fog collectors are also made of canvas or foil sheets. Using condensate from air conditioning units as a water source is also becoming more popular in large urban areas.

{{Asof|2019|November}} a Glasgow-based startup has helped a farmer in Scotland to establish edible saltmarsh crops irrigated with sea water. An acre of previously marginal land has been put under cultivation to grow [[samphire]], [[Suaeda|sea blite]], and [[Tripolium pannonicum|sea aster]]; these plants yield a higher profit than potatoes. The land is flood irrigated twice a day to simulate tidal flooding; the water is pumped from the sea using wind power. Additional benefits are soil remediation and carbon sequestration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters-saltwater&quot;&gt;{{cite web

== Efficiency ==
Modern irrigation methods are efficient enough to supply the entire field uniformly with water, so that each plant has the amount of water it needs, neither too much nor too little.&lt;ref name=&quot;efficiency&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agriwaterpedia.info/wiki/Water_use_efficiency|title=Water use efficiency - agriwaterpedia.info|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water use efficiency in the field can be determined as follows:

* Field Water Efficiency (%) = (Water Transpired by Crop ÷ Water Applied to Field) x 100

Until 1960s, water was not recognised as a scarce resource. At that time, there were fewer than half the current number of people on the planet. People were not as wealthy as today, consumed fewer calories and [[meat consumption|ate less meat]], so less water was needed to produce their food. They required a third of the volume of water we presently take from rivers. Today, the competition for [[water resources]] is much more intense. This is because there are now [[human overpopulation|more than seven billion people]] on the planet, their consumption of water-thirsty meat and vegetables is rising, and there is increasing competition for water from [[Industrial sector|industry]], [[urbanisation]] and [[biofuel crops]]. To avoid a global [[water crisis]], farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing [[food security|demands for food]], while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Chartres, C. and Varma, S. ''Out of water. From Abundance to Scarcity and How to Solve the World's Water Problems'' FT Press (USA), 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Successful agriculture is dependent upon farmers having sufficient access to water. However, water scarcity is already a critical constraint to farming in many parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Condon|first=Madison|last2=Komakech|first2=Hans|last3=Zaag|first3=Pieter van der|date=2012-01-01|title=The Role of Statutory and Local Rules in Allocating Water between Large- and Small-Scale Irrigators in an African River Catchment|url=https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/988|journal=Water SA|volume=38|issue=1|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regards to agriculture, the World Bank targets food production and water management as an increasingly global issue that is fostering a growing debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.worldbank.org/water/publications/reengaging-agricultural-water-management-challenges-and-options |title=Reengaging in Agricultural Water Management: Challenges and Options |publisher=The World Bank | accessdate=2011-10-30|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Physical water scarcity]] is where there is not enough water to meet all demands, including that needed for ecosystems to function effectively. Arid regions frequently suffer from physical water scarcity. It also occurs where water seems abundant but where resources are over-committed. This can happen where there is overdevelopment of hydraulic infrastructure, usually for irrigation. Symptoms of physical water scarcity include environmental degradation and declining [[groundwater]]. Economic scarcity, meanwhile, is caused by a lack of investment in water or insufficient human capacity to satisfy the demand for water. Symptoms of [[economic water scarcity]] include a lack of infrastructure, with people often having to fetch water from rivers for domestic and agricultural uses. Some 2.8 billion people currently live in water-scarce areas.&lt;ref&gt;Molden, D. (Ed). ''Water for food, Water for life: [[A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture]].''

* [[Overdrafting]] (depletion) of underground [[aquifers]]. In the mid-20th century, the advent of diesel and electric motors led to systems that could pump [[groundwater]] out of major [[aquifer]]s faster than [[drainage basin]]s could refill them. This can lead to permanent loss of aquifer capacity, decreased water quality, ground subsidence, and other problems.

* Underirrigation or irrigation giving only just enough water for the plant (e.g. in drip line irrigation) gives poor [[soil salinity control]] which leads to increased [[soil salinity]] with consequent buildup of toxic salts on soil surface in areas with high evaporation. This requires either [[leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] to remove these salts and a method of [[drainage]] to carry the salts away. When using drip lines, the leaching is best done regularly at certain intervals (with only a slight excess of water), so that the salt is flushed back under the plant's roots.&lt;ref&gt;EOS magazine, September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Water Council&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on society ==
A 2016 study found that countries whose agriculture depended on irrigation are more likely to be autocratic than other countries. The authors of the study &quot;argue that the effect has historical origins: irrigation allowed landed elites in arid areas to monopolize water and arable land. This made elites more powerful and better able to oppose democratization.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bentzen|first1=Jeanet Sinding|last2=Kaarsen|first2=Nicolai|last3=Wingender|first3=Asger Moll|date=2016-06-01|title=Irrigation and Autocracy|journal=Journal of the European Economic Association|language=en|pages=n/a|doi=10.1111/jeea.12173|issn=1542-4774|url=https://curis.ku.dk/portal/da/publications/irrigation-and-autocracy(5f8eafe3-3b8b-4175-ae31-a2bf56fd4baf).html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parks ===
[[File:Центральна алея парку восени.jpg|thumb|right|Ivan Franko Park]]
Lviv architectural face is complemented and enriched with numerous parks, and public gardens. There are over 20 basic recreation park zones, 3 botanical gardens and 16 natural monuments. They offer a splendid chance to escape from city life or simply sit for a while among the trees, at a nice fountain or a lake. Each park has its individual character which reflects through various monuments and their individual history.

* [[Ivan Franko Park]], is the oldest park in the city. Traces of that time may be found in three-hundred-year-old oak and maple trees. Upon the abrogation of the Jesuit order in 1773 the territory became the town property. A well-known gardener Bager arranged the territory in the landscape style, and most of the trees were planted within 1885–1890.
* [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky Culture and Recreation Park]], is one of the best organised and modern green zones containing a concert and dance hall, stadium, the town of attractions, central stage, numerous cafes and restaurants. In the park, there is a Ferris wheel.
* [[Stryiskyi Park]], it is considered one of the most picturesque parks in the city. The park numbers over 200 species of trees and plants. It is well known for a vast collection of rare and valuable trees and bushes. At the main entrance gate, you will find a pond with swans.

* [[Lychakivskyi Park]], founded in 1892 and named after the surrounding suburbs. A botanic garden is situated on the park territory, founded in 1911 and occupying the territory of {{convert|18.5|ha|1|abbr=off}}.

=== Sport ===
Lviv was an important centre for sport in Central Europe and is regarded as the birthplace of Polish [[Association football|football]]. Lviv is the Polish birthplace of other sports. In January 1905 the first Polish [[ice hockey|ice-hockey]] match took place there and two years later the first [[ski jumping|ski-jumping]] competition was organised in nearby [[Slavske|Sławsko]]. In the same year, the first Polish basketball games were organised in Lviv's gymnasiums. In autumn 1887 a gymnasium by Lychakiv Street (pol. ''ulica Łyczakowska'') held the first Polish [[track and field]] competition with such sports as the [[long jump]] and [[high jump]]. Lviv's athlete Władysław Ponurski represented Austria in the [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Olympic Games]] in [[Stockholm]]. On 9 July 1922 the first official [[rugby union|rugby]] game in Poland took place at the stadium of Pogoń Lwów in which the rugby team of Orzeł Biały Lwów divided itself into two teams – &quot;The Reds&quot; and &quot;The Blacks&quot;. The referee of this game was a Frenchman by the name of Robineau.

The first known official goal in a Polish football match was scored there on 14 July 1894 during the Lwów-Kraków game. The goal was scored by [[Włodzimierz Chomicki]] who represented the team of Lviv. In 1904 Kazimierz Hemerling from Lviv published the first translation of the rules of football into Polish and another native of Lviv, Stanisław Polakiewicz, became the first officially recognised Polish referee in 1911 the year in which the first [[Polish Football Association|Polish Football Federation]] was founded in Lviv. The first Polish professional football club, [[Czarni Lwów]] opened here in 1903 and the first stadium, which belonged to Pogoń, in 1913. Another club, [[Pogoń Lwów]], was four times football champion of Poland (1922, 1923, 1925 and 1926). In the late 1920s, as many as four teams from the city played in the Polish Football League (Pogoń, Czarni, Hasmonea and Lechia). [[Hasmonea Lwów|Hasmonea]] was the first Jewish football club in Poland. Several notable figures of Polish football came from the city including [[Kazimierz Górski]], [[Ryszard Koncewicz]], [[Michał Matyas]] and [[Wacław Kuchar]].

In the period 1900–1911 opened the most famous football clubs in Lviv.
Professor Ivan Bobersky has based in the Academic grammar school the first [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] sports circle where schoolboys were engaged in track and field, football, boxing, hockey, skiing, tourism and sledge sports in 1906.
He has organised the  &quot;Ukrainian Sports circle&quot; in 1908.
Much its pupils in due course in 1911 have formed a sports society with the loud name &quot;Ukraine&quot; –  first Ukrainian football club of Lviv.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boberskiy.org.ua/indexe.html &quot;Ivan Bobersky – training of the first teachers of physical training is connected to his name.&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;

Lviv now has several major professional [[football team|football clubs]] and some smaller clubs. [[FC Karpaty Lviv]], founded in 1963, plays in the first division of the [[Ukrainian Premier League]]. Sometimes citizens of Lviv assemble on the central street (Freedom Avenue) to watch and cheer during outdoor broadcasts of games.

There are three major stadiums in Lviv. One of them is the [[Ukraina Stadium]] which is leased to FC Karpaty Lviv until 2018.
[[Arena Lviv]] is a brand-new football stadium that was an official venue for [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]] Championship games in Lviv. Construction work began on 20 November 2008 and was completed by October 2011. The opening ceremony took place on 29 October, with a vast theatrical production dedicated to the history of Lviv.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=1706984.html|title=UEFA EURO 2016 - News – UEFA.com|last=uefa.com|date=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arena Lviv is currently playing host to [[Shakhtar Donetsk]] and [[Metalurh Donetsk]] due to the ongoing [[war in Donbass]].

Lviv's chess school enjoys a good reputation; such notable grandmasters as [[Vassily Ivanchuk]], [[Leonid Stein]], [[Alexander Beliavsky]], [[Andrei Volokitin]] used to live in Lviv.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=5548 &quot;Lviv&amp;nbsp;– the chess capital of Ukraine&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; Grandmaster [[Anna Muzychuk]] lives in Lviv.

== Popular culture ==
The native residents of the city are jokingly known as the Lvivian [[batiar]]y (someone who's mischievous). Lvivians are also well known for their way of speaking that was greatly influenced by the [[Lwów dialect|Lvivian gwara]] (talk).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://balzatul.multiply.com/journal/item/1051 |title=Lviv dialect |publisher=Balzatul.multiply.com |accessdate=3 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209084934/http://balzatul.multiply.com/journal/item/1051 |archivedate=9 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public transport ==
{{See also|Trams in Lviv}}
[[File:Electron 1179 (2).jpg|thumb|right|A [[Trams in Lviv|Lviv tram]] in the Old Town.]]
Historically, the first horse-drawn [[tram]]way lines in Lviv were inaugurated on 5 May 1880. An electric tram was introduced on 31 May 1894. The last horse-drawn line was transferred to electric traction in 1908. In 1922 the tramways were switched to driving on the right-hand side. After the annexation of the city by the Soviet Union, several lines were closed but most of the infrastructure was preserved. The tracks are [[narrow gauge railway|narrow-gauge]], unusual for the Soviet Union, but explained by the fact that the system was built while the city was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and needed to run in narrow medieval streets in the centre of town. The Lviv tramway system now runs about 220 cars on {{convert|75|km|0|abbr=off}} of track. Many tracks were reconstructed around 2006. The price in February 2019 of a tram/trolleybus ticket was 5 UAH (reduced fare ticket was 2.5 UAH, e.g. for students). The ticket may be purchased from the driver.

After World War II the city grew rapidly due to evacuees returning from Russia, and the Soviet Government's vigorous development of [[heavy industry]]. This included the transfer of entire factories from the Urals and others to the newly &quot;liberated&quot; territories of the USSR. The city centre tramway lines were replaced with [[trolleybus]]es on 27 November 1952. New lines were opened to the [[Tower block|blocks of flats]] at the city outskirts. The network now runs about 100 trolleybuses – mostly of the 1980s Skoda 14Tr and [[:uk:ЛАЗ 52522|LAZ 52522]]. In 2006–2008 11 modern [[Low floor|low-floor]] trolleybuses (LAZ E183) built by the [[Lviv Bus Factory]] were purchased. The public [[bus network]] is represented by mini-buses (so-called ''marshrutka'') and large buses mainly LAZ and MAN. On 1 January 2013 the city had 52 public bus routes. The price is 7.00 UAH regardless of the distance travelled. The ticket may be purchased from the driver.

=== Railways ===
{{Main|Lviv Railways}}
[[File:Lviv railway station2.png|thumb|Lviv's [[Lviv Rail Terminal|Main Railway Terminal]]]]
Modern Lviv remains a hub on which nine railways converge providing local and international services. Lviv railway is one of the oldest in Ukraine. The first train arrived in Lviv on 4 November 1861. The main [[Lviv Rail Terminal|Lviv Railway Station]], designed by [[Władysław Sadłowski]], was built in 1904 and was considered one of the best in Europe from both the architectural and the technical aspects.

In the inter-war period, Lviv (known then as Lwów) was one of the most important hubs of the [[Polish State Railways]]. The Lwów junction consisted of four stations in mid-1939 – main station ''Lwów Główny'' (now {{lang-uk|Lviv Holovnyi}}), Lwów Kleparów (now ''Lviv Klepariv''), ''Lwów Łyczaków'' (now ''Lviv Lychakiv''), and ''Lwów Podzamcze'' (now ''Lviv Pidzamche''). In August 1939 just before World War II, 73 trains departed daily from the Main Station including 56 local and 17 fast trains. Lwów was directly connected with all major centres of the Second Polish Republic as well as such cities as Berlin, [[Bucharest]], and [[Budapest]].&lt;ref&gt;Urzędowy Rozkład Jazdy i Lotów PKP, Lato 1939 (Polish State Railroads Timetable, Summer 1939)&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, several trains cross the nearby Polish–Ukrainian border (mostly via [[Przemyśl]] in Poland). There are good connections to Slovakia ([[Košice]]) and Hungary ([[Budapest]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Many routes have overnight trains with sleeping compartments. Lviv railway is often called the main gateway from Ukraine to Europe although buses are often a cheaper and more convenient way of entering the &quot;Schengen&quot; countries.

Lviv used to have a [[Railbus]], which has since been replaced with other means of public transport. It was a motor-rail car that ran from the largest district of Lviv to one of the largest industrial zones going through the central railway station. It made seven trips a day and was meant to provide a faster and more comfortable connection between the remote urban districts. The price in February 2010 of a one-way single ride in the railbus was 1.50 UAH. On 15 June 2010, the route was cancelled as unprofitable.

=== Air transport ===
[[File:Ph-mjp1.jpg|thumb|[[Lviv International Airport]]]]
Beginnings of aviation in Lviv reach back to 1884 when the Aeronautic Society was opened there. The society issued its own magazine ''Astronauta'' but soon ceased to exist. In 1909 on the initiative of Edmund Libanski the Awiata Society was founded. Among its members there was a group of professors and students of the [[Lviv Polytechnic]], including [[Stefan Drzewiecki]] and Zygmunt Sochacki. Awiata was the oldest Polish organization of this kind and it concentrated its activities mainly on exhibitions such as the ''First Aviation Exhibition'' which took place in 1910 and featured models of aircraft built by Lviv students.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lwow.home.pl/semper/lotniczy.html |title=Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow |publisher=Lwow.home.pl |accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913–1914 brothers Tadeusz and Władysław Floriańscy built a two-seater aeroplane. When World War I broke out Austrian authorities confiscated it but did not manage to evacuate the plane in time and it was seized by the Russians who used the plane for intelligence purposes. The Floriański brothers' plane was the first Polish-made aircraft. On 5 November 1918, a crew consisting of [[Stefan Bastyr]] and Janusz de Beaurain carried out the first-ever flight under the [[Flag of Poland|Polish flag]] taking off from Lviv's Lewandówka (now {{lang-uk|Levandivka}}) airport.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow&quot; /&gt; In the interbellum period Lwów was a major centre of gliding with a notable ''Gliding School'' in Bezmiechowa which opened in 1932. In the same year the Institute of Gliding Technology was opened in Lwów and was the second such institute in the world. In 1938 the ''First Polish Aircraft Exhibition'' took place in the city.

The interwar Lwów was also a major centre of the [[Polish Air Force]] with the Sixth Air Regiment located there. The Regiment was based at the Lwów airport opened in 1924 in the suburb of Skniłów (today {{lang-uk|Sknyliv}}). The airport is located {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=off}} from the city centre.&lt;ref name=europe-airports&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europe-airports.com/ukraine/show-airport.php?code=LWO |title=Europe Airports – Lviv (LWO) |publisher=Europe-airports.com |accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, after renovation, Lviv Airport got a new official name [[Lviv International Airport|Lviv Danylo Halytskyi International Airport]] (LWO).&lt;ref name=&quot;New terminal of the Lviv Airport&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/en/publish/article?art_id=245126146&amp;cat_id=244314975 |title=New terminal of the Lviv Airport |publisher=kmu.gov.ua |accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new terminal and other improvements worth under a $200 million has been done in preparation for the 2012 UEFA European Football Championship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zik.com.ua/en/news/2008/05/27/137795 Modernization of Lviv airport for Euro-2012 finals to cost $200 million.

=== Bicycle lanes ===
Cycling is a new but growing mode of transport in Lviv. In 2011 the City of Lviv ratified an ambitious 9-year program for the set-up of [[cycling infrastructure]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city-adm.lviv.ua/news/images/stories/program_bicycle_network_lviv.pdf Lviv City Administration – Bicycle Program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717123621/http://www.city-adm.lviv.ua/news/images/stories/program_bicycle_network_lviv.pdf |date=17 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – until the year 2019 an overall length of {{convert|270|km|0|abbr=on}} cycle lanes and tracks shall be realized. A working group formally organised within the City Council, bringing together representatives of the city administration, members of planning and design institutes, local NGOs and other stakeholders. Events like the All-Ukrainian Bikeday&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bikeday.org.ua |title=bikeday.org.ua |publisher=bikeday.org.ua |accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[European Mobility Week]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobilnist.org.ua/en/downloads/doc_download/43-european-mobility-week-2011-in-lvivukraine.html |title=Downloads &amp;#124; Event Reports |publisher=Mobilnist.org.ua |accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; show the popularity of cycling among Lviv's citizens.

By September 2011, {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} of new cycling infrastructure had been built. It can be expected that until the end of the 2011 {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} will be ready for use. The cycling advisor in Lviv – the first such position in Ukraine – is supervising and pushing forward the execution of the cycling plan and coordinates with various people in the city. The development of cycling in Ukraine is currently hampered by outdated planning norms and the fact, that most planners didn't yet plan and experience cycling infrastructure. The update of national legislation and training for planners is therefore necessary.

In 2015, the first stations have been set up for a new [[bike-sharing]] system [[Nextbike]] – the first of its kind in Ukraine. New bike lanes are also under construction, making Lviv the most bike-friendly city in the country. The City Council plans to build an entire cycling infrastructure by 2020, with cycle lanes ({{convert|268|km|mi|abbr=off|disp=or}}) and street bike hire services.

{{Hermeticism}}
'''Rosicrucianism''' is a [[spirituality|spiritual]] and [[cultural movement]] which arose in Europe in the early 17th century after the publication of several texts which purported to announce the existence of a hitherto unknown [[esoteric]] order to the world and made seeking its knowledge attractive to many.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yates, Frances A 1972&quot;&gt;[[Frances Yates|Yates, Frances A.]] (1972), ''The Rosicrucian Enlightenment'', London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Vickers |first=Brian |title=Frances Yates and the Writing of History |date=June 1979 |journal=The Journal of Modern History |volume=51 |issue=2, Technology and War |pages=287–316 |doi=10.1086/241901|s2cid=144766713 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mysterious doctrine of the order is &quot;built on esoteric truths of the ancient past&quot;, which &quot;concealed from the average man, provide insight into nature, the [[physical universe]], and the spiritual realm.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lindgren, Carl Edwin, ''{{Citation |title=The way of the Rose Cross; A Historical Perception, 1614–1620 |url=http://users.panola.com/lindgren/rosecross.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108052032/http://users.panola.com/lindgren/rosecross.html |archive-date=8 November 2012 |url-status=dead}}''. Journal of Religion and Psychical Research, Volume 18, Number 3:141–48. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The manifestos do not elaborate extensively on the matter, but clearly combine references to [[Christian Kabbalah|Kabbalah]], [[Hermeticism]], [[alchemy]], and [[Christian mysticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Pierre. ''Lodges, Orders and the Rosicross: Rosicrucianism in Lodges, Orders and Initiating Societies since the early 16th century''. Edition Oriflamme, 2017. {{ISBN|9783952426258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rosicrucian manifestos heralded a &quot;universal reformation of mankind&quot;, through a science allegedly kept secret for decades until the intellectual climate might receive it. Controversies arose on whether they were a hoax, whether the &quot;Order of the Rosy Cross&quot; existed as described in the manifestos, and whether the whole thing was a [[metaphor]] disguising a movement that really existed, but in a different form. In 1616, [[Johann Valentin Andreae]] famously designated it as a &quot;[[ludibrium]]&quot;. Some scholars of esotericism suggest that this statement was later made by Andreae in order to shield himself from the wrath of the religious and political institutions of the day, which were intolerant of free speech and the idea of a &quot;universal reformation&quot;, which the manifestos called for.

An example of the rosy cross symbol predating the early Rosicrucian manifestos is that shown on the [[:File:Triptych Harbaville Louvre OA3247 n6.jpg|central panel]] of the [[Harbaville Triptych]], which is Byzantine and comes from the 10th or 11th century. The symbol is a Calvary cross with a rose in its centre, which is identical with what the masonic/rosicrucian scholar Manly Palmer Hall claimed to be the original symbol of the rosicrucians.

In his work &quot;Silentium Post Clamores&quot; (1617), the rosicrucian Michel Maier (1568–1622) described rosicrucianism as having arisen from a &quot;[[The Primordial Tradition|Primordial Tradition]]&quot; in the following statement: &quot;Our origins are Egyptian, Brahmanic, derived from the mysteries of Eleusis and Samothrace, the Magi of Persia, the Pythagoreans, and the Arabs.&quot;

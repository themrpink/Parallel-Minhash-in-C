Oaklanders refer to their city's terrain as &quot;the flatlands&quot; and [[Oakland Hills, Oakland, California|&quot;the hills&quot;]]. Until recent waves of gentrification, these terms also symbolized Oakland's deep economic divide, with &quot;the hills&quot; being more affluent communities. About two-thirds of Oakland lies in the flat plain of the East Bay, with one-third rising into the foothills and hills of the East Bay range.

Ruptures along the nearby [[San Andreas Fault]] caused severe earth movement in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1906 and 1989. San Andreas quakes induces creep (movement occurring on earthquake faults) in the Hayward fault, which runs directly through Oakland, Berkeley, San Jose and other Bay Area cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seismo.berkeley.edu/annual_report/ar98_99/node22.html |title=Modeling surface creep on the Hayward fault using rate-and-state friction |first1=David |last1=Schmidt |first2=Roland |last2=Bürgmann |year=1999 |work=The Berkeley Seismological Laboratory |publisher=The Regents of the University of California |access-date=August 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927211802/http://seismo.berkeley.edu/annual_report/ar98_99/node22.html |archive-date=September 27, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oakland has more than 50 distinct neighborhoods. The city's greater divisions include downtown Oakland and its greater [[#Central business district|Central Business District]], [[Lake Merritt]], [[East Oakland, Oakland, California|East Oakland]], [[North Oakland, Oakland, California|North Oakland]], [[West Oakland, Oakland, California|West Oakland]], and the [[Oakland Hills, Oakland, California|Oakland Hills]]. East Oakland, which includes the East Oakland Hills, encompasses more than half of Oakland's land area, stretching from Lakeshore Avenue on the east shore of Lake Merritt southeast to the [[San Leandro, California|San Leandro]] border. North Oakland encompasses the neighborhoods between downtown and [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] and [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]]. West Oakland is the area between downtown and the Bay, partially surrounded by the [[Oakland Point, Oakland, California|Oakland Point]], and encompassing the [[Port of Oakland]]. In 2011, Oakland was ranked the 10th most walkable city in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/07/19/BUUK1KCC67.DTL#ixzz1SfOLM9sW |title=S.F., Oakland in top 10 most walkable U.S. cities |author=Said, Carolyn |date=July 20, 2011 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |access-date=August 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this reduction in habitat, Oakland is home to a number of rare and endangered species, many of which are localized to [[serpentine soil]]s and bedrock. Lake Merritt is surrounded by residential and business districts, including [[downtown Oakland|downtown]] and [[Grand Lake, Oakland, California|Grand Lake]].

The city of [[Piedmont, California|Piedmont]], incorporated in Oakland's central foothills after the 1906 earthquake, is a small independent city surrounded by the city of Oakland.

===Climate and Vegetation===

Oakland has a [[warm-summer Mediterranean climate]] with an average of 260 sunny days per year. In general, the city features warm, dry summers, and mild, wet winters. [[Lake Merritt]], a large [[estuary]] centrally located east of Downtown, was announced as the United States' first official wildlife refuge.

Based on data gathered by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], Oakland is ranked No. 1 in climate among U.S. cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oaklandchamber.com/relocation/facts.asp |title=Relocation information: Oakland Facts |publisher=Chamber of Commerce |access-date=July 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903163216/http://www.oaklandchamber.com/relocation/facts.asp |archive-date=September 3, 2011 }} As published in 1993 by Rand McNally.&lt;/ref&gt; Oakland's climate is typified by the temperate and seasonal Mediterranean climate. Summers are usually dry and warm and winters are mild and damp. It has features found in both nearby coastal cities such as San Francisco and inland cities such as [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], making it warmer than San Francisco and cooler than San Jose. Its position on San Francisco Bay across from the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]] means the northern part of the city can have cooling [[San Francisco fog|maritime fog]]. It is far enough inland that the fog often burns off by midday, allowing it to have typically sunny California days. The hills tend to have more fog than the flatlands, as the fog drifts down from [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]].

The [[U.S. Weather Bureau]] kept weather records in downtown Oakland from October 4, 1894, to July 31, 1958. During that time, the record high temperature was {{convert|104|°F}} on June 24, 1957, and the record low temperature was {{convert|24|°F}} on January 23, 1949. Dry, warm offshore &quot;Diablo&quot; winds (similar to the [[Santa Ana winds]] of Southern California) sometimes occur, especially in fall, and raise the fire danger. In 1991, such an episode allowed the catastrophic Oakland Hills fire to spread and consume many homes. The wettest year was 1940 with {{convert|38.65|in|mm|0}} and the driest year was 1910 with {{convert|12.02|in|mm|0}}. The most rainfall in one month was {{convert|15.35|in|mm|0}} in January 1911. The most rainfall in 24 hours was {{convert|4.27|in|0|}} on February 12, 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?ca6332 |title=Oakland, California&amp;nbsp;– Climate Summary |publisher=Wrcc.dri.edu |access-date=April 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rainfall near the bayfront is only {{Convert|23|in}}, but is higher in the Oakland Hills to the east (up to {{Convert|30|in|disp=sqbr}}).

The higher rainfall in the hills supports woods of oak, madrona, pine, fir and a few redwood groves in the wetter areas. Before being logged in the 19th century, some of the tallest redwood trees in California (used for navigation by ships entering the Golden Gate) may have stood in the Oakland Hills. One old stump {{Convert|30|feet}} in diameter can be seen near Redwood Regional Park. Sunny, drier slopes are grassy or covered in scattered oaks and chaparral brush. [[Eucalyptus globulus|Australian eucalyptus trees]] have been extensively planted in many areas, as they come from a similar climate.

The [[National Weather Service]] today has two official weather stations in Oakland: [[Oakland International Airport]] and the [[Oakland Museum]] (established 1970).

Oakland became a destination for African Americans in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] during and after World War II as they gained high-paying jobs in the defense industry. Blacks have formed a plurality in Oakland for many years, peaking in 1980 at about 47% of the population.

=== Gentrification ===
As of 2020, the San Francisco-Oakland Metro shows indications of having the greatest intensity of gentrification nationally, with over 31% of eligible neighborhoods gentrifying. Gentrifying neighborhoods showed significant increases in median home value, median household income, percentage of college educated residents, but also in economic inequality. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gentrification and Disinvestment 2020 » NCRC|url=https://ncrc.org/gentrification20/|access-date=2020-11-03|website=NCRC|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historically low-income neighborhoods have been rapidly changed by new, higher-income residents as high-wage tech workers and expensive housing have continued to push lower-wage residents out of Oakland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gentrification and Disinvestment 2020 » NCRC|url=https://ncrc.org/gentrification20/|access-date=2020-11-03|website=NCRC|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In West Oakland, for example, median household income rose from $80,700 to $86,300 between 2010 and 2017, while the percent of population with four-year degrees rose from one-third to nearly one-half, according to the National Community Reinvestment Coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-06-18|title=Oakland, S.F. neighborhoods fastest gentrifying in U.S.|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/oakland-s-f-neighborhoods-fastest-gentrifying-in-u-s|access-date=2020-11-03|website=The Mercury News|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Big tech companies have continued to transform the communities and culture of Oakland as modern apartments have appeared, housing prices have spiked, and many prior working-class residents have moved to suburbs further inland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Levin|first=Sam|date=2019-07-02|title='There's no way to stop this': Oakland braces for the arrival of tech firm Square|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jul/02/theres-no-way-to-stop-this-oakland-braces-for-the-arrival-of-tech-firm-square|access-date=2020-11-03|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to 2015 data compiled by the [https://bayareaequityatlas.org/ Bay Area Equity Atlas], 91% of low-income households of color were either in neighborhoods that were gentrifying or were at risk of gentrification at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gentrification risk {{!}} Bay Area Equity Atlas|url=https://bayareaequityatlas.org/indicators/gentrification-risk#/?geo=07000000000653000|access-date=2020-11-03|website=bayareaequityatlas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number was higher for individual low-income communities, with 96% of Native American households in neighborhoods that either experienced gentrification or were at risk of being gentrified, followed by Latino households at 94%, Black households at 92%, and Asian or Pacific Islander households at 88%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gentrification risk {{!}} Bay Area Equity Atlas|url=https://bayareaequityatlas.org/indicators/gentrification-risk#/?geo=07000000000653000|access-date=2020-11-03|website=bayareaequityatlas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

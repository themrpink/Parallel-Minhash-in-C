As it now stands, the U.S. Internal Revenue Code is over several million words long, and contains many loopholes, deductions, and exemptions which, advocates of flat taxes claim, render the collection of taxes and the enforcement of tax law complicated and inefficient.

It is further argued that current tax law slows economic growth by distorting economic incentives, and by allowing, even encouraging, tax avoidance. With a flat tax, there are fewer incentives than in the current system to create tax shelters, and to engage in other forms of tax avoidance.

Flat tax critics contend that a flat tax system could be created with many loopholes, or a progressive tax system without loopholes, and that a progressive tax system could be as simple, or simpler, than a flat tax system. A simple progressive tax would also discourage tax avoidance.

Under a pure flat tax without deductions, every tax period a company would make a single payment to the government covering the taxes on the employees and the taxes on the company profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=3861190 | work=The Economist | title=The flat-tax revolution | date=14 April 2005 | access-date=28 October 2005 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051220030127/http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=3861190 | archive-date=20 December 2005 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, suppose that in a given year, a company called ACME earns a profit of 3 million, spends 2 million in wages, and spends 1 million on other expenses that under the tax law is taxable income to recipients, such as the receipt of stock options, bonuses, and certain executive privileges. Given a flat rate of 15%, ACME would then owe the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) (3M + 2M + 1M) × 0.15 = 900,000. This payment would, in one fell swoop, settle the tax liabilities of ACME's employees as well as the corporate taxes owed by ACME. Most employees throughout the economy would never need to interact with the IRS, as all tax owed on wages, interest, dividends, royalties, etc. would be withheld at the source. The main exceptions would be employees with incomes from personal ventures. The ''Economist'' claims that such a system would reduce the number of entities required to file returns from about 130 million individuals, households, and businesses, as at present, to a mere 8 million businesses and self-employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/node/3860731 | work=The Economist | title=The case for flat taxes | date=14 April 2005 | access-date=17 January 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111105707/http://www.economist.com/node/3860731 | archive-date=11 November 2010 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this simplicity depends on the absence of deductions of any kind being allowed (or at least no variability in the deductions of different people). Furthermore, if income of differing types are segregated (e.g., pass-through, long term cap gains, regular income, etc.) then complications ensue. For example, if realized capital gains were subject to the flat tax, the law would require brokers and mutual funds to calculate the realized capital gain on all sales and redemption. If there were a gain, a tax equal to 15% of the amount of the gain would be withheld and sent to the IRS. If there were a loss, the amount would be reported to the IRS. The loss would offset gains, and then the IRS would settle up with taxpayers at the end of the period. Lacking deductions, this scheme cannot be used to implement economic and social policy indirectly by tax credits and thus, as noted above, the simplifications to the government's revenue collection apparatus might be offset by new government ministries required to administer those policies.

===Revenues===
The Russian Federation is considered a prime case of the success of a flat tax; the real revenues from its Personal Income Tax rose by 25.2% in the first year after the Federation introduced a flat tax, followed by a 24.6% increase in the second year, and a 15.2% increase in the third year.&lt;ref name=&quot;rabushka&quot;&gt;[http://www.hoover.org/research/flat-tax-work-russia-year-three The Flat Tax at Work in Russia: Year Three] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105238/http://www.hoover.org/research/flat-tax-work-russia-year-three |date=2 April 2015 }}, Alvin Rabushka, Hoover Institution Public Policy Inquiry, www.russianeconomy.org, 26 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian example is often used as proof of the validity of this analysis, despite an [[International Monetary Fund]] study in 2006 which found that there was no sign &quot;of Laffer-type behavioral responses generating revenue increases from the tax cut elements of these reforms&quot; in Russia or in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2006/wp06218.pdf |title=The &quot;Flat Tax(es)&quot;: Principles and Evidence |access-date=8 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320070141/http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2006/wp06218.pdf |archive-date=20 March 2007 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overall structure===
Taxes other than the income tax (for example, taxes on sales and payrolls) tend to be regressive. Hence, making the income tax flat could result in a [[Regressive tax|regressive]] overall tax structure. Under such a structure, those with lower incomes tend to pay a ''higher'' proportion of their income in total taxes than the affluent do. The fraction of household income that is a return to capital (dividends, interest, royalties, profits of unincorporated businesses) is positively correlated with total household income.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Hence a flat tax limited to wages would seem to leave the wealthy better off. Modifying the tax base can change the effects.  A flat tax could be targeted at income (rather than wages), which could place the tax burden equally on all earners, including those who earn income primarily from returns on investment.  Tax systems could utilize a flat [[sales tax]] to target all consumption, which can be modified with rebates or exemptions to remove regressive effects (such as the proposed [[Fair Tax]] in the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;fairtaxbook&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Neal | last=Boortz |author2=Linder, John | year=2006 | title=The Fair Tax Book | edition=Paperback | publisher=[[Regan Books]]|isbn=0-06-087549-6 | title-link=The Fair Tax Book }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Border adjustable===
A flat tax system and income taxes overall are not inherently border-adjustable; meaning the tax component embedded into products via taxes imposed on companies (including [[corporate tax]]es and [[payroll tax]]es) are not removed when exported to a foreign country ''(see [[Effect of taxes and subsidies on price]])''. Taxation systems such as a [[sales tax]] or [[value added tax]] can remove the tax component when goods are exported and apply the tax component on imports. The domestic products could be at a disadvantage to foreign products (at home and abroad) that are border-adjustable, which would impact the global competitiveness of a country. However, it's possible that a flat tax system could be combined with tariffs and credits to act as border adjustments (the proposed ''Border Tax Equity Act'' in the U.S. attempts this). Implementing an income tax with a border adjustment tax credit is a violation of the [[World Trade Organization]] agreement. Tax exemptions (allowances) on low income wages, a component of most income tax systems could mitigate this issue for high labour content industries like textiles that compete Globally.

In a subsequent section, various proposals for flat tax-like schemes are discussed, these differ mainly on how they approach with the following issues of deductions,  defining income, and policy implementation.

==Around the world==
{{Main|List of countries by tax rates}}

Most countries tax personal income at the national level using progressive rates, but some use a flat rate. Most countries that have or had a flat tax on personal income at the national level are [[Communist state#Former communist states|former communist countries]] or [[List of island countries|islands]].

In some countries, subdivisions are allowed to tax personal income in addition to the national government. Many of these subdivisions use a flat rate, even if their national government uses progressive rates. Examples are all [[subdivisions of the Nordic countries|counties and municipalities of the Nordic countries]], all [[administrative divisions of Japan|prefectures and municipalities of Japan]], and some [[Italy#Constituent entities|subdivisions of Italy]] and [[Political divisions of the United States|of the United States]].

===Jurisdictions that have a flat tax on personal income===

The table below lists jurisdictions where the personal income tax imposed by all levels of government is a flat rate. It includes independent countries and other autonomous jurisdictions. The tax rate listed is the one that applies to income from work, but does not include mandatory contributions to [[social security]]. In some jurisdictions, different rates (also flat) apply to other types of income, such as from investments.

[[File:Estátua de frade em Almeirim.JPG|thumb|Statue of a monk and stone soup (''sopa da pedra'') in Almeirim, Portugal]]
'''The Stone Soup''' is a European [[Folklore|folk story]] in which hungry strangers convince the people of a town to each share a small amount of their food in order to make a meal that everyone enjoys, and exists as a [[Moral#In moral tales|moral]] regarding the value of sharing. In varying traditions, the stone has been replaced with other common inedible objects, and therefore the fable is also known as '''axe soup''', '''button soup''', '''nail soup''', and '''wood soup'''.

==Story==
Some travelers come to a village, carrying nothing more than an empty cooking pot. Upon their arrival, the villagers are unwilling to share any of their food stores with the very hungry travelers. Then the travelers go to a stream and fill the pot with water, drop a large [[Rock (geology)|stone]] in it, and place it over a fire. One of the villagers becomes curious and asks what they are doing. The travelers answer that they are making &quot;stone [[soup]]&quot;, which tastes wonderful and which they would be delighted to share with the villager, although it still needs a little bit of [[Garnish (food)|garnish]], which they are missing, to improve the flavor.

The villager, who anticipates enjoying a share of the soup, does not mind parting with a few carrots, so these are added to the soup. Another villager walks by, inquiring about the pot, and the travelers again mention their stone soup which has not yet reached its full potential. The villager hands them a little bit of [[seasoning]]. More and more villagers walk by, each adding another ingredient. Finally, the stone (being inedible) is removed from the pot, and a delicious and nourishing pot of soup is enjoyed by travelers and villagers alike. Although the travelers have thus tricked the villagers into sharing their food with them, they have successfully transformed it into a tasty meal which they share with the donors.

== Variations ==
*The [[Eastern Europe]]an variation of the story (which is similar to the Northern European rendition) is called &quot;axe soup&quot;, with an [[axe]] as the catalyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rusartnet.com/russia/literature/folk-tale/the-axe-soup|title=The Axe Soup|last=|first=|date=|website=RusArtNet|language=en-gb|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the [[French folklore|French]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Russians|Russian]] versions of the tale, the travelers are [[soldier]]s returning home.
**In the Hungarian version, a single starving soldier encounters several hardships on his journey back to his homeland.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} At the end of the story, he sells the rock to the villagers after eating the soup.
**In Russian tradition, a soldier prepares &quot;axe [[kasha]]&quot; ({{lang|ru|[[:s:ru:Каша из топора|Каша из топора]]}}).&lt;ref&gt;Claire Burchett, &quot;Spotlight on: Kasha&quot;, Liden &amp; Denz Intercultural Institute of Languages (14 July 2017): https://lidenz.ru/spotlight-on-kasha/&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Johann Peter Hebel]] wrote a [[German language|German]] version, &quot;''Der schlaue Pilgrim''&quot; (&quot;The Cunning Pilgrim&quot;, 1811),&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashliman&quot; /&gt; in which a wily [[pilgrim]], allegedly on his way to [[Jerusalem]], tricks a hostess step-by-step into adding rich soup ingredients to his [[Pebble|pebble stones]], finally leaving the stones uneaten.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
* In Northern European and [[Scandinavia]]n countries, the story is most commonly known as &quot;nail soup&quot;, and the main character is typically a [[tramp]] looking for food and lodgings, who convinces an old woman that he will make a tasty [[Nail (fastener)|nail]] soup for the both of them if she would just add a few ingredients for the garnish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nail Soup - traditional swedish folk-tale |url=http://hem.fyristorg.com/kulturkemi/net/soup.htm |access-date=November 23, 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020316195723/http://hem.fyristorg.com/kulturkemi/net/soup.htm |archive-date=March 16, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the Portuguese tradition, the traveler is a [[monk]], and the story takes place around [[Almeirim]], Portugal. Nowadays {{lang|pt|sopa de pedra}} is considered a regional dish of Almeirim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cm-almeirim.pt/conhecer-almeirim/gastronomia/item/202-sopa-de-pedra-receitas |title=Sopa da Pedra – Receitas |trans-title=Stone soup – Recipes |website=Almeirim Municipal Chamber |language=Portuguese |access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the Chinese version, three monks are the ones who place a stone into a pot and boil the soup. Villagers who are curious pass by and add ingredients such as carrots, rice wine, pepper, salt etc.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

====&quot;Stone soup&quot;-like collaborations====
There are many examples of projects referencing the &quot;Stone Soup&quot; story's theme of making something significant by accumulating many small contributions. Examples include: 
*''[[Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup]]'', a computer game which expanded on an abandoned project using contributions from many different coders
*''[[Stone Soup (magazine)|Stone Soup]]'', a children's literary magazine published by the California-based Children’s Art Foundation since 1973

===Adaptations===

====Film====
The film ''[[Fandango (1985 film)|Fandango]]'' (1985) contains a wedding sequence towards the end which builds on the Stone Soup theme. The protagonists need to hold a wedding ceremony, but they lack the necessary funds. Therefore, they set up a folding [[card table]] by the main street of a sleepy Texas town, dust it off, and invite passersby to come to the wedding. As they concoct stories of delinquent caterers and crashed champagne trucks, the friendly townspeople contribute their time and resources, the result being a magical wedding ceremony.

====Literature====
[[William Butler Yeats]]' play ''The Pot of Broth'' (1904) tells a version of the story in which a clever Irish tramp uses his wits to swindle a shrewish medieval housewife out of her dinner.{{sfn|Yeats|2010|pages=109–119}}

The story is the basis of [[Marcia Brown]]'s 1947 children's book ''Stone Soup'' (1947),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Marcia |author-link=Marcia Brown |title=Stone Soup (1947) |year=2005 |isbn=978-0689878367 |publisher=[[Aladdin Paperbacks]] |location=[[New York City]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which features soldiers tricking miserly villagers into cooking them a feast. The book was a [[Caldecott Honor]] book in 1948&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stone Soup, 1948 Caldecott Honor Book |url=http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/caldecottmedal/caldecotthonors/1948honorstonesoup |publisher=Association for Library Service to Children |access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was read aloud by the Captain (played by [[Bob Keeshan]]) on an early episode of ''[[Captain Kangaroo]]'' in the 1950s, as well as at least once in the 1960s or early 1970s.{{sfn|Spicer; Disbrowe|2007|page=9}}{{sfn|Bradbury|2010|page=66}}

In 1965, [[Gordon R. Dickson]] published a short story called &quot;Soupstone&quot;, where a headstrong pilot is sent to solve a problem on a planet under the guise of a highly educated and competent official. He succeeds by pretending to understand everything, but actually merely making the locals apply their already present knowledge and abilities to the task.

&quot;Stone Soup&quot; (1968),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stone Soup (1968) |date=1986 |publisher=[[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic Inc]] |isbn=978-0590416023 |last=McGovern |first=Ann |author-link=Ann McGovern |edition=Reissue |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/stonesoup00mcgo }}&lt;/ref&gt; written by [[Ann McGovern]] and illustrated by Nola Langner, tells the story of a little old lady and a hungry young man at the door asking for food, and how he tricks her into making stone soup.

In 1975, [[Walt Disney Productions]] published a '''Wonderful World of Reading''' book titled ''Button Soup''. Daisy Duck tricks Scrooge McDuck to share his food to help flavor her Button Soup.

Canadian children's author Aubrey Davis adapted the story to a [[Jewish]] context in his book ''Bone Button Borscht'' (1996). According to Davis, he wrote the story when he was unable to find a story that he liked for a [[Hanukkah]] reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davis |first=Aubrey |title=Bone Button Borscht |year=2002 |publisher=Turtleback Books |location=[[St. Louis]] |isbn=978-0613991032}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Budd]]'s narration of ''Bone Button Borscht'' traditionally airs across Canada on [[CBC Radio One]]'s ''[[As It Happens]]'', on the first day of [[Hanukkah]].

[[Oregon Electric Railway|Oregon Electric]] and [[Red Electric]] interurban lines once served the city in the early 20th century. In the 1940s, [[Blue Bus lines (Oregon)|Tualatin Valley Stages]], a division of Portland Stages, Inc., provided limited [[Public transport bus service|bus transit]] service connecting the city with [[downtown Portland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stage Fares To Increase|date=August 6, 1947|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; operating later as a separate company, Tualatin Valley Buses, Inc., through the 1960s. This was one of four privately owned bus companies serving the [[Portland metropolitan area]] which became collectively known as the [[Blue Bus lines (Oregon)|&quot;Blue Bus&quot; lines]].  All four companies were replaced in 1970 by TriMet, a then-new regional transit authority,&lt;ref name=&quot;tri-met action averts&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Federman|first=Stan|date=September 2, 1970|title=Tri-Met Action Averts Strike Of Bus Drivers; Agency To Assume Operation Of Four Suburban Blue Lines|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which expanded bus service to cover more areas of Beaverton.

The city is the location of a major [[Interchange (road)|freeway interchange]] for [[U.S. Route 26 in Oregon|U.S. Route 26]] (US 26; Sunset Highway) and [[Oregon Route 217]] (OR 217). The Sunset Highway connects Beaverton to Hillsboro and the [[Oregon Coast]] to the west and Portland to the east. OR 217 travels from Beaverton south through Tigard and terminates at an interchange with [[Interstate 5 in Oregon|Interstate 5]] (I-5).

{{Securities}}
{{Financial markets}}
A '''security''' is a tradable [[financial asset]]. The term commonly refers to any form of [[financial instrument]], but its legal definition varies by jurisdiction. In some countries and languages the term &quot;security&quot; is commonly used in day-to-day parlance to mean any form of financial instrument, even though the underlying legal and regulatory regime may not have such a broad definition. In some jurisdictions the term specifically excludes financial instruments other than [[Stock|equities]] and fixed income instruments. In some jurisdictions it includes some instruments that are close to equities and fixed income, e.g., [[Warrant (finance)|equity warrants]].

Securities may be represented by a certificate or, more typically, &quot;non-certificated&quot;, that is in electronic ([[Dematerialization (securities)|dematerialized]]) or &quot;[[book entry]]&quot; only form. Certificates may be ''bearer'', meaning they entitle the holder to rights under the security merely by holding the security, or ''registered'', meaning they entitle the holder to rights only if he or she appears on a security register maintained by the issuer or an intermediary. They include shares of corporate [[stock]] or [[mutual fund]]s, [[bond (finance)|bond]]s issued by corporations or governmental agencies, [[stock option]]s or other options, limited partnership units, and various other formal investment instruments that are negotiable and fungible.

In the United Kingdom, the national [[competent authority]] for financial markets regulation is the [[Financial Conduct Authority]]; the definition in its Handbook of the term &quot;security&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/glossary/G1061.html | title=security | work=FCA Handbook | publisher=[[Financial Conduct Authority]] | access-date=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; applies only to equities, [[debenture]]s, alternative debentures, government and public securities, warrants, certificates representing certain securities, units, stakeholder pension schemes, personal pension schemes, rights to or interests in investments, and anything that may be admitted to the Official List.

In the United States, a '''security''' is a tradable [[financial asset]] of any kind.&lt;ref&gt;The United States [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] defines a security as: &quot;Any [[Note (finance)|note]], [[stock]], [[treasury stock]], [[Bond (finance)|bond]], [[debenture]], certificate of interest or participation in any [[profit-sharing agreement]] or in any oil, gas, or other mineral [[royalties|royalty]] or [[lease]], any [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] [[Trust certificate (finance)|trust certificate]], preorganization certificate or subscription, transferable share, [[investment]] [[contract]], voting-trust certificate, [[certificate of deposit]], for a security, any [[put option|put]], [[call option|call]], [[straddle]], [[option (finance)|option]], or group or index of securities (including any interest therein or based on the value thereof), or any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege entered into on a national [[Exchange (organized market)|securities exchange]] relating to [[Currency|foreign currency]], or in general, any [[Financial instrument|instrument]] commonly known as a &quot;security&quot;; or any certificate of interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing; but shall not include currency or any note, draft, [[bill of exchange]], or banker's acceptance which has a [[Maturity (finance)|maturity]] at the time of issuance of not exceeding nine months, exclusive of days of grace, or any renewal thereof the maturity of which is likewise limited.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Securities are broadly categorized into:
* [[debt securities]] (e.g., [[banknote]]s, [[bond (finance)|bonds]] and [[debenture]]s)
* [[Stock|equity securities]] (e.g., [[common stock]]s)
* [[Derivative (finance)|derivative]]s (e.g., [[Forward contract|forwards]], [[futures contract|futures]], [[option (finance)|options]], and [[swap (finance)|swaps]]).

The company or other entity issuing the security is called the [[issuer]]. A country's regulatory structure determines what qualifies as a security. For example, private investment pools may have some features of securities, but they may not be registered or regulated as such if they meet various restrictions.

Securities are the traditional way that commercial enterprises raise new capital. These may be an attractive alternative to bank loans depending on their pricing and market demand for particular characteristics. Another disadvantage of bank loans as a source of financing is that the bank may seek a measure of protection against default by the borrower via extensive financial covenants. Through securities, capital is provided by investors who purchase the securities upon their initial issuance. In a similar way, a government may issue securities too when it needs to increase [[government debt]].

== Debt and equity ==
Securities are traditionally divided into debt securities and equities (see also [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]]).

=== Debt ===
Debt securities may be called [[debenture]]s, [[bond (finance)|bonds]], [[Deposit (finance)|deposits]], [[Promissory note|notes]] or [[commercial paper]] depending on their maturity, collateral and other characteristics. The holder of a debt security is typically entitled to the payment of principal and interest, together with other contractual rights under the terms of the issue, such as the right to receive certain information. Debt securities are generally issued for a fixed term and redeemable by the issuer at the end of that term. Debt securities may be protected by collateral or may be unsecured, and, if they are unsecured, may be contractually &quot;senior&quot; to other [[unsecured debt]] meaning their holders would have a priority in a bankruptcy of the issuer. Debt that is not senior is &quot;subordinated&quot;.

'''[[Corporate bond]]s''' represent the debt of commercial or industrial entities. Debentures have a long maturity, typically at least ten years, whereas notes have a shorter maturity. Commercial paper is a simple form of debt security that essentially represents a post-dated cheque with a maturity of not more than 270 days.

'''Money market instruments''' are short term debt instruments that may have characteristics of deposit accounts, such as [[Certificate of deposit|certificates of deposit]], [[Accelerated Return Notes (ARN)]], and certain [[bill of exchange|bills of exchange]]. They are highly liquid and are sometimes referred to as &quot;near cash&quot;. Commercial paper is also often highly liquid.

'''Euro debt securities''' are securities issued internationally outside their domestic market in a denomination different from that of the issuer's domicile. They include eurobonds and euronotes. Eurobonds are characteristically underwritten, and not secured, and interest is paid gross. A euronote may take the form of euro-commercial paper (ECP) or euro-certificates of deposit.

'''Government bonds''' are medium or long term debt securities issued by sovereign governments or their agencies. Typically they carry a lower rate of interest than corporate bonds, and serve as a source of finance for governments. U.S. federal government bonds are called ''treasuries.'' Because of their liquidity and perceived low risk, treasuries are used to manage the money supply in the [[open market operation]]s of non-US central banks.

'''Sub-sovereign government bonds''', known in the U.S. as [[municipal bond]]s, represent the debt of state, provincial, territorial, municipal or other governmental units other than sovereign governments.

'''Supranational bonds''' represent the debt of international organizations such as the [[World Bank Group|World Bank]]{{fact|date=April 2017}}, the [[International Monetary Fund]]{{fact|date=April 2017}}, regional [[multilateral development banks]]{{vague|date=April 2017}} and others.

=== Equity ===
An equity security is a share of equity interest in an entity such as the capital stock of a company, trust or partnership. The most common form of equity interest is common stock, although preferred equity is also a form of capital stock. The holder of an equity is a shareholder, owning a share, or fractional part of the issuer. Unlike debt securities, which typically require regular payments (interest) to the holder, equity securities are not entitled to any payment. In bankruptcy, they share only in the residual interest of the issuer after all obligations have been paid out to creditors. However, equity generally entitles the holder to a pro rata portion of control of the company, meaning that a holder of a majority of the equity is usually entitled to control the issuer. Equity also enjoys the right to [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] and [[capital gain]], whereas holders of debt securities receive only interest and repayment of [[Debt|principal]] regardless of how well the issuer performs financially. Furthermore, debt securities do not have voting rights outside of bankruptcy. In other words, equity holders are entitled to the &quot;upside&quot; of the business and to control the business.

=== Hybrid ===
Hybrid securities combine some of the characteristics of both debt and equity securities.

'''Preference shares''' form an intermediate class of security between equities and debt. If the issuer is liquidated, they carry the right to receive interest or a return of capital in priority to ordinary shareholders. However, from a legal perspective, they are capital stock and therefore may entitle holders to some degree of control depending on whether they contain voting rights.

'''Convertibles''' are bonds or [[preferred stock]] that can be converted, at the election of the holder of the convertibles, into the common stock of the issuing company. The convertibility, however, may be forced if the convertible is a [[callable bond]], and the issuer calls the bond. The bondholder has about 1 month to convert it, or the company will call the bond by giving the holder the call price, which may be less than the value of the converted stock. This is referred to as a forced conversion.

'''Equity warrants''' are options issued by the company that allow the holder of the warrant to purchase a specific number of shares at a specified price within a specified time. They are often issued together with bonds or existing equities, and are, sometimes, detachable from them and separately tradeable. When the holder of the warrant exercises it, he pays the money directly to the company, and the company issues new shares to the holder.

Warrants, like other convertible securities, increases the number of shares outstanding, and are always accounted for in financial reports as fully diluted earnings per share, which assumes that all warrants and convertibles will be exercised.

== Classification ==
Securities may be classified according to many categories or classification systems:
* [[Denomination (currency)|Currency of denomination]]
* [[Title (property)|Ownership rights]]
* Terms to maturity
* Degree of liquidity
* [[Income|Income payments]]
* Tax treatment
* [[Credit rating]]
* Industrial sector or &quot;[[Industrial sector|industry]]&quot;. (&quot;Sector&quot; often refers to a higher level or broader category, such as ''Consumer Discretionary'', whereas &quot;industry&quot; often refers to a lower level classification, such as ''Consumer Appliances''. See [[Industry classification|Industry]] for a discussion of some classification systems.)
* Region or country (such as country of incorporation, country of principal sales/market of its products or services, or country in which the principal securities exchange where it trades is located)
* [[Market capitalization]]
* State (typically for municipal or &quot;tax-free&quot; bonds in the US)

== Type of holder ==
Investors in securities may be [[retail]], i.e., members of the public investing other than by way of business. The greatest part of investment, in terms of volume, is [[wholesale]], i.e., by financial institutions acting on their own account, or on behalf of clients. Important [[institutional investor]]s include [[investment bank]]s, [[insurance]] companies, [[pension fund]]s and other managed funds.

== Investment ==
The traditional economic function of the purchase of securities is investment, with the view to receiving [[income]] or achieving [[capital gain]]. Debt securities generally offer a higher rate of interest than bank deposits, and equities may offer the prospect of capital growth. [[Equity (finance)|Equity investment]] may also offer control of the business of the issuer. Debt holdings may also offer some measure of control to the investor if the company is a fledgling start-up or an old giant undergoing 'restructuring'. In these cases, if interest payments are missed, the creditors may take control of the company and liquidate it to recover some of their investment.

== Collateral ==
The last decade has seen an enormous growth in the use of securities as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]]. Purchasing securities with borrowed money secured by other securities or cash itself is called &quot;[[buying on margin]]&quot;. Where A is owed a debt or other obligation by B, A may require B to deliver [[property right]]s in securities to A, either at inception (transfer of title) or only in default (non-transfer-of-title institutional). For institutional loans, property rights are not transferred but nevertheless enable A to satisfy its claims in the event that B fails to make good on its obligations to A or otherwise becomes [[insolvent]]. Collateral arrangements are divided into two broad categories, namely [[security interest]]s and outright collateral transfers. Commonly, commercial banks, investment banks, government agencies and other institutional investors such as [[mutual fund]]s are significant collateral takers as well as providers. In addition, private parties may utilize stocks or other securities as collateral for portfolio loans in [[securities lending]] scenarios.

On the consumer level, loans against securities have grown into three distinct groups over the last decade: '''1)''' ''Standard Institutional Loans,'' generally offering low loan-to-value with very strict call and coverage regimens, akin to standard margin loans; '''2)''' ''Transfer-of-Title (ToT) Loans,'' typically provided by private parties where borrower ownership is completely extinguished save for the rights provided in the loan contract; and '''3)''' Non-Transfer-of-Title Credit Line facilities where shares are not sold and they serve as assets in a standard lien-type line of cash credit. Of the three, transfer-of-title loans have fallen into the very high-risk category as the number of providers has dwindled as regulators have launched an industry-wide crackdown on transfer-of-title structures where the private lender may sell or [[short (finance)|sell short]] the securities to fund the loan. Institutionally managed consumer securities-based loans on the other hand, draw loan funds from the financial resources of the lending institution, not from the sale of the securities.

Collateral and sources of collateral are changing, in 2012 gold became a more acceptable form of collateral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CME Clearing Europe collateral types to include gold bullion {{!}} Securities Lending Times news {{!}} securitieslendingtimes.com|url = http://www.securitieslendingtimes.com/securitieslendingnews/industryarticle.php?article_id=218278#.VnKTfntapFR|website = www.securitieslendingtimes.com|access-date = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However more recently Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) seen by many as the ugly ducklings of the collateral world have started to become more readily available and acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Markit makes its ETF mark with big market players {{!}} Securities Lending Times news {{!}} securitieslendingtimes.com|url = http://www.securitieslendingtimes.com/securitieslendingnews/industryarticle.php?article_id=220267#.VnKTF3tapFQ|website = www.securitieslendingtimes.com|access-date = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in a world where collateral is becoming scarce and efficiency is everything, many of these mallards are proving themselves to be not so ugly after all—many more are veritable swans. The problem, until now, for collateral managers has been deciphering the bad eggs from the good, which proves to be a time-consuming and inefficient task.

== Markets ==

=== Primary and secondary market ===
Public securities markets are either primary or secondary markets. In the primary market, the money for the securities is received by the issuer of the securities from investors, typically in an [[initial public offering]] (IPO). In the secondary market, the securities are simply assets held by one investor selling them to another investor, with the money going from one investor to the other.

An initial public offering is when a company issues public stock newly to investors, called an &quot;IPO&quot; for short. A company can later issue more new shares, or issue shares that have been previously registered in a shelf registration. These later new issues are also sold in the primary market, but they are not considered to be an IPO but are often called a &quot;secondary offering&quot;. Issuers usually retain [[investment bank]]s to assist them in administering the IPO, obtaining SEC (or other regulatory body) approval of the offering filing, and selling the new issue. When the investment bank buys the entire new issue from the issuer at a discount to resell it at a markup, it is called a [[firm commitment underwriting]]. However, if the investment bank considers the risk too great for an underwriting, it may only assent to a [[best effort agreement]], where the investment bank will simply do its best to sell the new issue.

For the primary market to thrive, there must be a [[secondary market]], or aftermarket that provides liquidity for the investment security—where holders of securities can sell them to other investors for cash. Otherwise, few people would purchase primary issues, and, thus, companies and governments would be restricted in raising equity capital (money) for their operations. Organized exchanges constitute the main secondary markets. Many smaller issues and most debt securities trade in the decentralized, dealer-based [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] markets.

In Europe, the [[principal trade]] organization for securities dealers is the International Capital Market Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icma-group.org/ |title=icma-group.org |publisher=icma-group.org |access-date=2012-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., the principal trade organization for securities dealers is the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sifma.org/ |title=sifma.org |publisher=sifma.org |date=2012-05-10 |access-date=2012-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the result of the merger of the Securities Industry Association and the Bond Market Association. The Financial Information Services Division of the Software and Information Industry Association (FISD/SIIA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fisd.net |title=fisd.net |publisher=fisd.net |access-date=2012-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; represents a round-table of market data industry firms, referring to them as Consumers, Exchanges, and Vendors. In India the equivalent organisation is the securities exchange board of India (SEBI).

=== Public offer and private placement ===
In the primary markets, securities may be offered to the public in a [[public offer]]. Alternatively, they may be offered privately to a limited number of qualified persons in a [[private placement]]. Sometimes a combination of the two is used. The distinction between the two is important to securities regulation and [[company law]]. Privately placed securities are not publicly tradable and may only be bought and sold by sophisticated qualified investors. As a result, the secondary market is not nearly as liquid as it is for public (registered) securities.

Another category, [[sovereign bond]]s, is generally sold by auction to a specialized class of dealers.

=== Listing and over-the-counter dealing ===
Securities are often listed in a [[stock exchange]], an organized and officially recognized market on which securities can be bought and sold. Issuers may seek listings for their securities to attract investors, by ensuring there is a liquid and regulated market that investors can buy and sell securities in.

Growth in informal electronic trading systems has challenged the traditional business of stock exchanges. Large volumes of securities are also bought and sold &quot;over the counter&quot; (OTC). OTC dealing involves buyers and sellers dealing with each other by telephone or electronically on the basis of prices that are displayed electronically, usually by [[financial data vendor]]s such as SuperDerivatives, [[Reuters]], [[Investing.com]] and [[Bloomberg Terminal|Bloomberg]].

There are also eurosecurities, which are securities that are issued outside their domestic market into more than one jurisdiction. They are generally listed on the [[Luxembourg Stock Exchange]] or admitted to listing in [[London]]. The reasons for listing eurobonds include regulatory and tax considerations, as well as the investment restrictions.

=== Market ===
London is the centre of the eurosecurities markets. There was a huge rise in the eurosecurities market in London in the early 1980s. Settlement of trades in eurosecurities is currently effected through two European computerized clearing/depositories called [[Euroclear]] (in Belgium) and [[Clearstream]] (formerly Cedelbank) in Luxembourg.

The main market for Eurobonds is the EuroMTS, owned by Borsa Italiana and Euronext. There are ramp up market in Emergent countries, but it is growing slowly.

== Physical nature ==

=== Certificated securities ===
Securities that are represented in paper (physical) form are called certificated securities. They may be ''bearer'' or ''registered''.

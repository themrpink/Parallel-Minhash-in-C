In [[Gerry Anderson]]'s 1967 and 1968 programme ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]'', background material published by, or with the approval of, Anderson identifies Winchester as the birthplace of the main character, [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Captain Scarlet]], real name Paul Metcalfe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Captain Scarlet bio|url=http://www.spectrum-headquarters.com/captain_scarlet.html |publisher=Aardman|accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winchester is the main location of [[Samuel Youd|John Christopher]]'s post-apocalyptic science fiction series, ''[[Sword of the Spirits]]''. Winchester Cathedral is featured in James Herbert's horror novel ''[[The Fog (1975 novel)|The Fog]]''. The Siege of Winchester in 1141, part of [[The Anarchy]] (a civil war) between [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]] and the [[Empress Matilda]], is an important plot element in the detective novel [[An Excellent Mystery (novel)|''An Excellent Mystery'']], part of the [[Brother Cadfael]] chronicles by [[Edith Pargeter]] writing as Ellis Peters. In [[Philip Pullman]]'s novel ''[[The Subtle Knife]]'' (part of the ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' trilogy) the main male protagonist, Will Parry, comes from Winchester. However, little of the book is set there.

In the movie ''[[Merlin (miniseries)|Merlin]]'', King Uther's first conquest of Britain begins with Winchester, which Merlin foresaw would fall.

In the novel ''[[The Pillars of the Earth]]'', by [[Ken Follett]], which traces English historical events from 1123 to 1174 CE, Winchester and its cathedral figure prominently in several chapters. The fictional town of Kingsbridge in the novel is based on Winchester, as Follett explained in the first episode of his [[Channel 4]] 2013 documentary series ''Ken Follett's Journey into the Dark Ages''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/ken-folletts-journey-into-the-dark-ages |title=Ken Follett's Journey into the Dark Ages |publisher=Channel 4 |year=2013 |accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts of wool merchants and their trading with sheep farmers in Winchester are related to the reader. The reign of Stephen is described and his military actions are recounted, including first-person &quot;reporting&quot; of the Battle of Lincoln on 2 February 1141.

'''Aurelian''' ({{lang-la|Lucius Domitius Aurelianus}}; 9 September 214{{spnd}}c. October 275) was [[Roman emperor]] from 270 to 275. His reign featured an unprecedented series of military victories which reunited the [[Roman Empire]] after it had practically disintegrated under the pressure of [[barbarian]] invasions and internal revolts. His successes were instrumental in ending the [[Crisis of the Third Century]], earning him the title {{lang|la|Restitutor Orbis}} – &quot;Restorer of the World&quot;.

Born in humble circumstances, he rose through the military ranks to become emperor. During his reign, he defeated the [[Alamanni]] after a devastating war. He also defeated the [[Goths]], [[Vandals]], [[Juthungi]], [[Sarmatians]], and [[Carpi (people)|Carpi]]. Aurelian restored the Empire's eastern provinces after his conquest of the [[Palmyrene Empire]] in 273. The following year he conquered the [[Gallic Empire]] in the west, reuniting the Empire in its entirety. He was also responsible for the construction of the [[Aurelian Walls]] in [[Rome]], the abandonment of the province of [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]], and monetary reform. Although [[Domitian]], two centuries previous, was the first emperor who had demanded to be officially hailed as ''dominus et deus'' (master and god), these titles never occurred in written form on official documents until the reign of Aurelian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Halsberghe | first=G.H. | title=The Cult of Sol Invictus | publisher=Brill | series=Etudes préliminaires aux religions orientales dans l'Empire romain | year=1972 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8tIUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA152 | ref=harv | access-date=2018-04-13 | page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life==
Aurelian was born on 9 September, most likely in 214 AD,&lt;ref&gt;[[John Malalas]] 12.301: aged 61 at death&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Watson|first=Alaric|title=Aurelian and the Third Century|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=978-041-530-187-9|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although 215 is also possible.{{sfn|Saunders|1992|pp=104-6}} The ancient sources do not agree on his place of birth, although he was generally accepted as being a native of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] but, another common belief was that he was born in Greece. According to the author of the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'', &quot;Aurelian was born of a humble family, at [[Sirmium]] according to most writers, but in [[Dacia Ripensis]] according to some. I remember, moreover, having read one author who declared that he was born in [[Moesia]]...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Historia Augusta]], [[Life of Aurelian]], Part One, 1, 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milošević (2010: pp. 106–7){{Incomplete short citation|date=April 2018}}&lt;!-- See talk page --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The province of [[Dacia Ripensis]] was actually created in [[Moesia]] by Aurelian as emperor when he abandoned the old trans-Danubian territory of [[Dacia]].  The Roman historian [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] also opts for the area that later became Dacia Ripensis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=2p9hCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=Aurelian+Eutropius+Dacia+Ripensis&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZ88zMoY_jAhVEYlAKHclxDNUQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Aurelian%20Eutropius%20Dacia%20Ripensis&amp;f=false Eutropius, Breviarum, 9.13.1]&lt;/ref&gt; The academic consensus is that he was of humble birth and that his father was a peasant-farmer who took his Roman ''[[Roman naming conventions#Nomen|nomen]]'' from his landlord, a senator of the clan Aurelius.{{sfn|Watson|1999|p=1}}  Saunders suggests that his family might in fact have been of Roman settler origin and of much higher social status; however, his suggestion has not been taken up by his more recent academic colleagues such as Southern and Watson.

Using the evidence of the ancient sources, it was at one time suggested that Aurelian's mother was a [[freedwoman]] of a member of the clan Aurelius and that she herself was a priestess of the [[Sol Invictus|sun god]] in her native village. These two propositions, together with the tradition that the clan Aurelius had been entrusted with the maintenance of that deity's cult in Rome, inspired the notion that this could explain the devotion to the sun-god that Aurelian was to manifest as emperor. However, it seems that this pleasant extrapolation of dubious facts is now generally accepted as being no more than just that.{{sfn|Saunders|1992|p=107}}

==Military career==
It is commonly accepted that Aurelian probably joined the army in 235 AD at around age twenty.{{sfn|Watson|1999|p=1}} It is also generally assumed that, as a member of the lowest rank of society{{mdash}}albeit a citizen{{efn|Had Aurelian's family been enfranchised by virtue of the ''[[Constitutio Antoniniana]]'' (212 AD) his ''nomen'' would have been &quot;Aurelius&quot;.}}{{mdash}}he would have enlisted in the ranks of the legions. Saunders suggests that his career is more easily understood if it is assumed that his family was of Roman settler origins with a tradition of military service and that he enlisted as an equestrian.{{sfn|Saunders|1992|p=109}}  This would have opened up for him the ''tres militia''{{mdash}}the three steps of the equestrian military career{{mdash}}one of the routes to higher equestrian office in the Imperial Service.{{efn|The ''tres militia'' were: (i) prefecture of a cohort of auxiliary infantry; (ii) tribunate of a legionary cohort; and (iii) prefecture of an ''ala'' of auxiliary cavalry.}} This could be a more expeditious route to senior military and [[Procurator (Roman)|procurator]]ial offices than that pursued by ex-rankers, although not necessarily less laborious.{{efn|Compare the career of [[Pertinax]] who pursued the ''Tres Militia'' with those of [[Publius Aelius Aelianus]], [[Lucius Aurelius Marcianus]] (both probably) and [[Traianus Mucianus]] (certainly) who rose ''e caliga'', i.e. through the ranks.}} However, Saunders's conjecture as to Aurelian's early career is not supported by any evidence other than his ''nomen'' which could indicate Italian settler ancestry—although even this is contested—and his rise to the highest ranks which is more easily understood if he did not have to start from the bottom. His suggestion has not been taken up by other academic authorities.

Whatever his origins, Aurelian certainly must have built up a very solid reputation for military competence during the tumultuous mid-decades of the century.  To be sure, the exploits detailed in the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'' ''vita Divi Aureliani'', while not always impossible, are not supported by any independent evidence and one at least is demonstrably an invention typical of that author.&lt;ref&gt;  For instance, ''vita Divi Aureliani'' paras 5.5–6, 6.3–5, and 7.1–2. If he ever was a tribune of a legion as suggested in 7.1–2 it could not have been with ''Legio VII Gallicana'' as that unit never existed.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, he was probably associated with [[Gallienus]]'s cavalry army and shone as an officer of that elite unit because, when he finally emerged in a historically reliable context in the early part of the reign of [[Claudius II]], he seems to have been its commander.{{sfn | Saunders| 1992| pp=129–130}}

===Service under Ulpius Crinitus===
{{anchor|Ulpius Crinitus}}
The existence of Ulpius Crinitus has been doubted by many [[historian]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;/&gt;  If he did exist he would have been a [[Dux]] of the [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyrian]] and [[Thracia]]n [[Roman legion|legions]].  Ulpius was reportedly born in the city of [[Italica]], which is currently in [[Hispania|Spain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;  Aurelian was reportedly his deputy for a time.  When a group of [[Goths]] [[Crisis of the Third Century|invaded]] Illyria and Thrace, Ulpius had been taken ill, so he had Aurelian deal with the invaders.  He designated Aurelian the [[Legatus|Legate]] of the Third Legion. Aurelian commanded two thousand five hundred [[Auxilia]]ries, and the tribal forces of four [[Germanic kingship|German Chieftains]].  He defeated the barbarians in battle and used the resources gained from the battles to enrich the [[Roman province|provinces]].  After the battle, Crinitus thanked [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]], the emperor at the time, for providing him with such a talented deputy.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;  Afterward, Crinitus adopted Aurelian as his heir, either voluntarily or possibly through force.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | title=ToposText| url=https://topostext.org/people/11063| access-date=2020-06-07| website=topostext.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following this, Crinitus disappeared from the historical record.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last=White| first=John F.| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=muBnCwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Ulpius+Crinitus&amp;pg=PP48| title=The Roman Emperor Aurelian: Restorer of the World| date=2015-11-30| publisher=Pen and Sword| isbn=978-1-4738-4477-3| language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hengst|first=Daniël den|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nPLbFiJoUWAC&amp;q=Ulpius+Crinitus&amp;pg=PA97|title=Emperors and Historiography: Collected Essays on the Literature of the Roman Empire by Daniël Den Hengst|date=2010|publisher=BRILL|year=|isbn=978-900-417-438-2|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

A painting showing Ulpius Crinitus alongside Aurelian has been found in the [[Temple of Sol Invictus|Temple of Sol]], adding to the veracity of his existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=LacusCurtius: Templum Solis (Platner &amp; Ashby, 1929) | url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Templum_Solis.html|access-date=2020-06-23 | website=penelope.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Service under Gallienus===
Aurelian's successes as a cavalry commander ultimately made him a member of Emperor [[Gallienus]]' entourage. In 268, Aurelian and his cavalry participated in general [[Claudius II|Claudius]]' victory over the [[Goths]] at the [[Battle of Naissus]].{{sfn|Watson|1999|p=41}}  Later that year, Gallienus traveled to Italy and fought [[Aureolus]], his former general and now usurper for the throne. Driving Aureolus back into [[Milan|Mediolanum]], Gallienus promptly besieged his adversary in the city. However, while the siege was ongoing the Emperor was assassinated. One source says Aurelian, who was present at the siege, participated and supported general Claudius for the purple—which is plausible.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aurelius Victor]], xxxiii,21. Other sources do not cite Aurelian among those who conspired against Gallienus, though different sources have claimed that he was the one who called Gallienus out of his tent under a proposed &quot;conspiracy&quot; at the point Gallienus was stabbed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aurelian was married to [[Ulpia Severina]], about whom little is known. She was from [[Dacia]].{{sfn|Watson|1999}} They are known to have had a daughter together.&lt;ref name=re&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url= http://www.roman-emperors.org/aurelian.htm|title= Aurelian (A.D. 270–275)|last1= Körner|first1= Christian|date= 23 December 2008 |encyclopedia= De Imperatoribus Romanis: An Online Encyclopedia of Roman Rulers and Their Families|accessdate=6 January 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101202042214/http://www.roman-emperors.org/aurelian.htm| archivedate= 2 December 2010 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Service under Claudius ===
Claudius was acclaimed emperor by the soldiers outside Mediolanum. The new emperor immediately ordered the senate to deify Gallienus. Next, he began to distance himself from those responsible for his predecessor's assassination, ordering the execution of those directly involved.{{sfn|Watson|1999|p=42}}  [[Aureolus]] was still besieged in Mediolanum and sought reconciliation with the new emperor, but Claudius had no sympathy for a potential rival.  The emperor had Aureolus killed and one source implicates Aurelian in the deed, perhaps even signing the warrant for his death himself.{{sfn|Watson|1999|p=42}}

During the reign of Claudius, Aurelian was promoted rapidly: he was given command of the elite Dalmatian cavalry and soon promoted to overall ''[[Magister equitum]]'', what was effectively the head of the army after the emperor and what had been Emperor Claudius' own position before his acclamation.{{sfn|Watson|1999|p=42}} The war against Aureolus and the concentration of forces in Italy allowed the [[Alamanni]] to break through the [[Limes Germanicus|Rhaetian limes]] along the upper [[Danube]]. Marching through [[Raetia]] and the [[Alps]] unhindered, they entered northern Italy and began pillaging the area. In early 269, emperor Claudius and Aurelian marched north to meet the Alamanni, defeating them at the [[Battle of Lake Benacus]].{{sfn|Watson|1999|p=43}}

While still dealing with the defeated enemy, news came from the [[Balkans]] reporting large-scale attacks from the [[Heruli]], [[Goths]], [[Gepids]], and [[Bastarnae]].{{sfn|Watson|1999|p=43}} Claudius immediately dispatched Aurelian to the Balkans to contain the invasion as best he could until Claudius could arrive with his main army.{{sfn|Watson|1999|p=44}} The Goths were besieging [[Thessalonica]] when they heard of emperor Claudius' approach, causing them to abandon the siege and pillage north-eastern Macedonia. Aurelian intercepted the Goths with his Dalmatian cavalry and defeated them in a series of minor skirmishes, killing as many as three thousand of the enemy. Aurelian continued to harass the enemy, driving them northward into [[Upper Moesia]] where emperor Claudius had assembled his main army. The ensuing battle was indecisive: the northward advance of the Goths was halted but Roman losses were heavy.{{sfn|Watson|1999|p=44}}

Claudius could not afford another pitched battle, so he instead laid a successful ambush, killing thousands. However, the majority of the Goths escaped and began retreating south the way they had come. For the rest of year, Aurelian harassed the enemy with his Dalmatian cavalry.{{sfn|Watson|1999|p=45}}

[[Image:Carska palata Sirmijum1.JPG|thumb|Ruins of Imperial Palace at [[Sirmium]], today in [[Sremska Mitrovica]]]]

Now stranded in Roman territory, the Goths' lack of provisions began to take its toll. Aurelian, sensing his enemies' desperation, attacked them with the full force of his cavalry, killing many and driving the remainder westward into [[Thrace]].{{sfn|Watson|1999|p=45}} As winter set in, the Goths retreated into the [[Haemus Mons|Haemus Mountains]], only to find themselves trapped and surrounded. The harsh conditions now exacerbated their shortage of food. However, the Romans underestimated the Goths and let their guard down, allowing the enemy to break through their lines and escape. Apparently emperor Claudius ignored advice, perhaps from Aurelian, and withheld the cavalry and sent in only the infantry to stop their break-out.

The determined Goths killed many of the oncoming infantry and were only prevented from slaughtering them all when Aurelian finally charged in with his Dalmatian cavalry. The Goths still managed to escape and continued their march through Thrace.{{sfn|Watson|1999|p=45}} The Roman army continued to follow the Goths during the spring and summer of 270. Meanwhile, a devastating plague swept through the Balkans, killing many soldiers in both armies.

Emperor Claudius fell ill on the march to the battle and returned to his regional headquarters in Sirmium, leaving Aurelian in charge of operations against the Goths.{{sfn|Watson|1999|p=45}} Aurelian used his cavalry to great effect, breaking the Goths into smaller groups which were easier to handle. By late summer the Goths were defeated: any survivors were stripped of their animals and booty and were levied into the army or settled as farmers in frontier regions.{{sfn|Watson|1999|p=45}} Aurelian had no time to relish his victories; in late August news arrived from Sirmium that Emperor Claudius was dead.{{sfn|Watson|1999|p=46}}

===Opposition to Quintillus===
When Claudius died, his brother [[Quintillus]] seized power with support of the Senate. With an act typical of the [[Crisis of the Third Century]], the army refused to recognize the new Emperor, preferring to support one of its own commanders: Aurelian was proclaimed emperor about May 270{{sfn|Stein|pp=46, 50}}{{sfn|Groag|loc=col. 1355}} by the [[Roman legion|legion]]s in Sirmium. Aurelian defeated Quintillus' troops, and was recognized as Emperor by the Senate after Quintillus' death. The claim that Aurelian was chosen by Claudius on his death bed{{sfn|Zonaras}} can be dismissed as propaganda; later, probably in 272, Aurelian put his own ''dies imperii'' at the day of Claudius' death, thus implicitly considering Quintillus a [[Roman usurper|usurper]].&lt;ref name=korner&gt;Korner.&lt;/ref&gt;

With his base of power secure, he now turned his attention to Rome's greatest problems—recovering the vast territories lost over the previous two decades, and reforming the ''res publica''.

===The Roman Empire in the 270s===

In 248, Emperor [[Philip the Arab]] had celebrated the millennium of the city of Rome with great and expensive ceremonies and games, and the Empire had given a tremendous proof of self-confidence. In the following years, however, the Empire had to face a huge pressure from external enemies, while, at the same time, dangerous civil wars threatened the empire from within, with usurpers weakening the strength of the state. Also, the economic substrate of the state, agriculture and commerce, suffered from the disruption caused by the instability. On top of this an epidemic swept through the Empire around 250, greatly diminishing manpower&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/11/solving-the-mystery-of-an-ancient-roman-plague/543528/&lt;/ref&gt; both for the army and for agriculture.

The end result was that the Empire could not endure the blow of the capture of Emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] in 260 by the [[Sassanids]]. The eastern provinces found their protectors in the rulers of the city of [[Palmyra]], in [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], whose autonomy grew until the formation of the [[Palmyrene Empire]], which was successful in defending against the Sassanid threat. The western provinces, those facing the ''[[Limes (Roman Empire)|limes]]'' of the [[Rhine]], seceded to form a third, autonomous state within the territories of the Roman Empire, which is now known as the [[Gallic Empire]].

In Rome, the Emperor was occupied with internal menaces to his power and with the defense of [[Italia (Roman province)|Italia]] and the Balkans.

===Reunification of the empire===
The first actions of the new Emperor were aimed at strengthening his own position in his territories. Late in 270, Aurelian campaigned in northern [[Italia (Roman province)|Italia]] against the [[Vandals]], [[Juthungi]], and [[Sarmatians]], expelling them from Roman territory. To celebrate these victories, Aurelian was granted the  title of ''Germanicus Maximus''.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, 1,48f.; Eutropius; [[Dexippus]], FGrH IIA 460 F7; ''Historia Augusta – Aurelianus'' xxi,1–3 and xviii,2.&lt;/ref&gt; The authority of the Emperor was challenged by several [[roman usurper|usurpers]]—[[Septimius (Roman emperor usurper)|Septimius]], [[Urbanus (Roman usurper)|Urbanus]], [[Domitian II|Domitianus]], and the rebellion of [[Felicissimus]]—who tried to exploit the sense of insecurity of the empire and the overwhelming influence of the armies in Roman politics. Aurelian, being an experienced commander, was aware of the importance of the army, and his propaganda, known through his coinage, shows he wanted the support of the legions.&lt;ref name=korner /&gt;

====Defending Italy against the Juthungi====

The burden of the northern barbarians was not yet over, however. In 271, the [[Alamanni]] moved towards Italia, entering the [[Po Valley|Po plain]] and sacking the villages; they passed the [[Po River]], occupied [[Piacenza|Placentia]] and moved towards [[Fano]]. Aurelian, who was in Pannonia to control the [[Vandals]]' withdrawal, quickly entered Italia, but his army was defeated in an [[Battle of Placentia (271)|ambush near Placentia]] (January 271). When the news of the defeat arrived in Rome, it caused great fear for the arrival of the barbarians. But Aurelian attacked the Alamanni camping near the [[Metauro|Metaurus River]], defeating them in the [[Battle of Fano]], and forcing them to re-cross the Po river; Aurelian finally routed them at  [[Battle of Pavia (271)|Pavia]]. For this, he received the title ''Germanicus Maximus''. However, the menace of the Germanic people and a Germanic invasion was still perceived by the Romans as likely, so Aurelian resolved to build a new system of walls around [[Rome]] that became known as the [[Aurelian Walls]].{{sfn|Watson|1999|pp=51–54, 217}}

====Defeat of the Goths and abandonment of Dacia====
The emperor led his legions to the Balkans, where he defeated and routed the Goths beyond the Danube, killing the Gothic leader [[Cannabaudes]], and assuming the title of ''Gothicus Maximus''. However, he decided to abandon the province of [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]], on the exposed north bank of the Danube, as too difficult and expensive to defend. He reorganized a new province of Dacia south of the Danube, inside the former [[Moesia]], called ''[[Dacia Aureliana]]'', with [[Serdica]] as the capital.{{sfn|Watson|1999|pp=54–55}}

====Conquest of the Palmyrene Empire====

[[File:AurelianusPalmyra272.png|thumb|The route of Aurelian's campaign against Palmyra.]]

In 272, Aurelian turned his attention to the lost eastern provinces of the empire, the [[Palmyrene Empire]], ruled by Queen [[Zenobia]] from the city of [[Palmyra]].&lt;ref&gt;The war against the Palmyrene Empire is described in Zosimus, 1,50,1–1,61,1, and ''Historia Augusta'', ''Aurelianus'', 22–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Zenobia had carved out her own empire, encompassing [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Egypt]] and large parts of [[Asia Minor]]. The Syrian queen cut off Rome's shipments of grain, and in a matter of weeks, the Romans started running low on bread. In the beginning, Aurelian had been recognized as Emperor, while [[Vaballathus]], the son of Zenobia, held the title of ''rex'' and ''imperator'' (&quot;king&quot; and &quot;supreme military commander&quot;), but Aurelian decided to invade the eastern provinces as soon as he felt his army to be strong enough.

Asia Minor was recovered easily; every city but [[Byzantium]] and [[Tyana]] surrendered to him with little resistance. The [[Siege of Tyana (272)|fall of Tyana]] lent itself to a legend: Aurelian to that point had destroyed every city that resisted him, but he spared Tyana after having a vision of the great 1st-century philosopher [[Apollonius of Tyana]], whom he respected greatly, in a dream. Apollonius implored: &quot;Aurelian, if you desire to rule, abstain from the blood of the innocent! Aurelian, if you will conquer, be merciful!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stoneman |first1=Richard |title=Palmyra and its Empire: Zenobia's Revolt against Rome |date=1994 |pages=167 |isbn=0472083155 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8kLFfE1qPhIC&amp;pg=PA167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aurelian spared Tyana, and it paid off; many more cities submitted to him upon seeing that the Emperor would not exact revenge upon them. Within six months, his armies stood at the gates of Palmyra, which surrendered when Zenobia tried to flee to the [[Sassanid Empire]].

Eventually Zenobia and her son were captured and made to walk on the streets of Rome in his triumph, the woman in golden chains. With the grain stores once again shipped to Rome, Aurelian's soldiers handed out free bread to the citizens of the city, and the Emperor was hailed a hero by his subjects. After a brief clash with the Persians and another in Egypt against the usurper [[Firmus]], Aurelian was obliged to return to Palmyra in 273 when that city rebelled once more. This time, Aurelian allowed his soldiers to sack the city, and Palmyra never recovered. More honors came his way; he was now known as ''Parthicus Maximus'' and ''Restitutor Orientis'' (&quot;Restorer of the East&quot;).&lt;ref name=korner /&gt;

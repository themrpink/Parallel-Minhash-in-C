Year '''332''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CCCXXXII]]''') was a [[leap year starting on Saturday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Pacatianus and Hilarianus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 1085 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 332 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

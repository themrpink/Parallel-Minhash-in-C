{{See also|Great Salt Lake effect}}

The southern and southeastern sides of the [[Great Salt Lake]] receive significant lake-effect snow. Since the Great Salt Lake never freezes, the lake effect can influence the weather along the [[Wasatch Front]] year-round. The lake effect largely contributes to the {{convert|55|-|80|in|cm|0}} annual snowfall amounts recorded south and east of the lake, and in average snowfall reaching {{convert|500|in|m|0}} in the [[Wasatch Range]]. The snow, which is often very light and dry because of the semi-arid climate, is referred to as &quot;The Greatest Snow on Earth&quot; in the mountains. Lake-effect snow contributes to approximately 6–8 snowfalls per year in [[Salt Lake City]], with approximately 10% of the city's precipitation being contributed by the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deseretnews.com/misc/gsl/105002200.htm &quot;Lake has great impacts on storm, weather&quot;]. ''[[Deseret Morning News]]'', August 5, 1999. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002201320/http://deseretnews.com/misc/gsl/105002200.htm |date=October 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar snowfall can occur near large inland bays, where it is known as bay-effect snow. Bay-effect snows fall downwind of [[Delaware Bay]], [[Chesapeake Bay]], and [[Massachusetts Bay]] when the basic criteria are met, and on rarer occasions along [[Long Island]].

The [[Finger Lakes]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] are long enough for lake-effect precipitation.

The [[Texas]] twin cities of [[Sherman, Texas|Sherman]] and [[Denison, Texas|Denison]] are known, in rare instances, to have experienced lake-effect snow from nearby [[Lake Texoma]] due to the lake's size (it is the third-largest lake in Texas or along its borders).

On one occasion in December 2016, lake effect snow fell in central [[Mississippi]] from a lake band off [[Ross Barnett Reservoir]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtok.com/content/news/Tuesday-December-20-Afternoon-Forecast-Discussion-407646085.html Tuesday December 20 Afternoon Forecast Discussion].wtok.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Oklahoma City even saw a band of lake effect snow off of Lake Hefner in February 2018.

The [[Truckee Meadows]] and other parts of Northern Nevada which are normally in the [[rain shadow]] of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] can, when conditions are right, have severe snowfall as a result of lake effect from [[Lake Tahoe]]. Recent severe examples of this phenomenon have occurred as recently as 2004, dumping several feet of snow in the normally dry region.

The [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] occasionally experiences ocean-effect showers, usually in the form of rain at lower elevations south of about the mouth of the [[Columbia River]]. These occur whenever an Arctic air mass from western Canada is drawn westward out over the Pacific Ocean, typically by way of the [[Fraser Valley]], returning shoreward around a center of low pressure. Cold air flowing southwest from the Fraser Valley can also pick up moisture over the [[Strait of Georgia]] and [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], then rise over the northeastern slopes of the [[Olympic Mountains]], producing heavy, localized snow between [[Port Angeles, Washington|Port Angeles]] and [[Sequim, Washington|Sequim]], as well as areas in [[Kitsap County, Washington|Kitsap County]] and the [[Puget Sound region]].&lt;ref name=mass&gt;{{cite book |last= Mass |first= Cliff |title= The Weather of the Pacific Northwest |year= 2008 |publisher= [[University of Washington Press]] |isbn= 978-0-295-98847-4 |page= 60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While snow of any type is very rare in Florida, the phenomenon of gulf-effect snow has been observed along the northern coast of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] a few times in history. More recently, &quot;ocean effect&quot; snow occurred on January 24, 2003, when wind off the Atlantic, combined with air temperatures in the 30s ºF, brought snow flurries briefly to the Atlantic coast of northern Florida seen in the air as far south as [[Cape Canaveral]].&lt;ref&gt;[[National Weather Service]] Office, Melbourne, Florida.[http://www.weather.gov/media/mlb/surveys/012403.pdf Cold Temperatures and Snow Flurries in] East-Central Florida January 24, 2003. Retrieved on 2006-11-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Elsewhere in Canada ==
[[Lake Winnipeg]], [[Lake Manitoba]] and [[Lake Winnipegosis]] in Manitoba historically have seen lake-effect snow as early as late October, and it is common throughout early to mid November. Towards the end of November the lakes sufficiently cool and begin to freeze ending the lake effect snow. A brief period of lake-effect snow is also common near [[Great Bear Lake]] and [[Great Slave Lake]] in the [[Northwest Territories]] during early winter (usually early to mid October); however the lake-effect season for both lakes is very short. The lakes are frozen roughly eight months of the year and as a result have very little time to warm during the summer months.

Other small lakes such as [[Lake Athabasca]] in northern [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Lake Nipigon]] in northwestern [[Ontario]] produce early season lake-effect snows. [[Smallwood Reservoir]], a man-made lake located in [[Labrador]] has on occasion generated lake-effect snow.

The Canadian [[Maritimes]], specifically [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Prince Edward Island]], are often affected by such snow squalls when an Arctic winter airmass moves over unfrozen waters. In PEI, sea-effect snow is often generated when a cold north wind blows over the unfrozen [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]], dumping heavy snow on the north shore. In Nova Scotia, a cold north-west wind can produce sea-effect snow over the [[Cape Breton Highlands]] from the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and the [[Annapolis Valley]] from the [[Bay of Fundy]]; in the latter case, the sea-effect snow season can continue all winter as the Bay of Fundy remains open owing to its extreme tidal currents.

The east coast of southern [[Vancouver Island]], British Columbia, experiences occasional episodes of sea-effect snow during winter months due to cold easterly outflow winds from the British Columbia interior, typically through the [[Fraser Valley]], crossing the always open waters of the [[Strait of Georgia]].

== Eurasia ==

Lake-effect or sea-effect snow occurs in other countries, near large lakes or large sea areas. In [[Eurasia]], it occurs in the regions of the [[Black Sea]] in Georgia, Romania, Bulgaria and northern Turkey, the [[Caspian sea]] in Iran, the [[Adriatic Sea]] in Italy, the [[North Sea]], as well as the [[Irish Sea]] and the [[Aegean Sea]], the [[Balearic Islands]], the [[Baltic Sea]] as well as areas surrounding the [[Sea of Japan]].

Because the southern Black Sea is relatively warm (around 13&amp;nbsp;°C or 55&amp;nbsp;°F at the beginning of winter, typically 10 to 6&amp;nbsp;°C or 50 to 43&amp;nbsp;°F by the end), sufficiently cold air aloft can create significant snowfalls in a relatively short period of time. Due to its location on a peninsula between the Black Sea and the [[Sea of Marmara]], [[Istanbul]] is very prone to lake-effect snow and this weather phenomenon occurs almost every winter. This type of precipitation is generated by the warmer Black Sea temperature and colder air temperature, over the Istanbul area. In February 2005, a lake-effect snowfall left {{convert|50|cm|in|sp=us}} of snow, and in March 1987, a three-week-long lake-effect snowfall accompanied with strong winds (lake-effect blizzard) left {{convert|80|cm|in|sp=us}} of snow in Istanbul.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://meetings.copernicus.org/www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU06/05142/EGU06-J-05142.pdf|title=The Black Sea impact on the severe snow episode over the city of Istanbul}}&lt;/ref&gt; The snowfall in the eastern regions of the Black Sea is amplified by the orographic effect of the nearby [[Caucasus Mountains]], often resulting in snowfall of several meters, especially at higher elevations.

In the [[Adriatic]] regions of [[Italy]] and in the eastern [[Apennine mountains]], the sea-effect-snow phenomenon with air masses coming from
Northern or Eastern Europe (and Russia) can be incredibly heavy and can last for days. In the hills and mountains it can result in snowfalls of several meters, as it happened in Feb. 2012. Meters of snow can also fall in short amounts of time. 

In Northern Europe, cold, dry air masses from Russia can blow over the [[Baltic Sea]] and cause heavy snow squalls on areas of the southern and eastern coasts of Sweden, as well as on the Danish island of [[Bornholm]] and the east coast of [[Jutland]]. For the northern parts of the Baltic sea this happens mainly in the early winter, since it freezes later. Southeast Norway can also experience heavy sea snow events with ENE winds. Especially coastal areas from Kragero to Kristiansand have seen incredible snow depths in the past with intense persistent snowbands from Norwegian sea (the coastal city of Arendal recorded 293&amp;nbsp;cm in a week in late February 2007)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vegvesen.no/_attachment/59094/binary/5448&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sea of Japan creates snowfall in the mountainous western Japanese prefectures of [[Niigata Prefecture|Niigata]] and [[Nagano Prefecture|Nagano]], parts of which are known collectively as [[Snow country (Japan)|Snow country]] (&quot;Yukiguni&quot;). In addition to the Sea of Japan, other parts of Japan, as well as Korea and Scandinavia, experience these same conditions.

Because the Aegean Sea (Greece), is warm in the winter, when cold air masses from Siberia advance in the area, they pick up much moisture, resulting in heavy snowfalls in eastern [[Central Greece]], eastern [[Thessaly]], eastern [[Peloponnese]], south-eastern [[Chalkidiki]], the [[Cyclades]] and [[Crete]] (more commonly in the mountainous areas). In 2008 a severe snowstorm blanketed [[Athens]] dropping 40&amp;nbsp;cm of snow and causing huge traffic jams.

Moving of polar or Siberian high pressure centers along [[Caspian Sea]] regarding to relatively warmer water of this sea can make heavy snowfalls in the northern coast of Iran. Several blizzards have been reported in this region during the last decades. in Feb 2014 heavy snowfall reached two meters in the coast line in [[Gilan Province|Gilan]] and [[Mazandaran Province|Mazandaran]] provinces of Iran. The heaviest snowfall was reported in [[Abkenar, Gilan|Abkenar village]] near [[Anzali Lagoon]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/view.php?id=83110&amp;eocn=home&amp;eoci=nh|title=Snow Blankets Iran : Natural Hazards|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-26024415|title=BBC News – Iran snow cuts power to nearly 500,000 homes|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/01/photogalleries/snow-pictures/|title=Heavy Snow Kills Dozens in Asia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observers.france24.com/content/20140214-iranians-facebook-save-villagers-snowstorm|title=Iranians use Facebook to save villagers from snowstorm|work=The Observers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Kingdom ==
[[File:Snow-chart.png|thumb|right|Chart showing the sea effect snow event of January 1987 in the UK. A continuous stream of showers deposited over {{convert|2|ft|in}} of snow over SE coastal regions.]]

In the United Kingdom, easterly winds bringing cold continental air across the [[North Sea]] can lead to a similar phenomenon. Locally it is also known as &quot;lake-effect snow&quot; despite the snow coming in from the sea rather than a lake.&lt;ref&gt;USW archives [https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!searchin/uk.sci.weather/%22lake$20effect$20snow%22$20%22north$20sea%22] Retrieved on 2007-08-03.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly during a north-westerly wind, snow showers can form coming in from the [[Liverpool Bay]], coming down the [[Cheshire Plain|Cheshire gap]], causing snowfall in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]]—this formation resulted in the white Christmas of 2004 in the area, and most recently the heavy snowfall of 8 December 2017 and 30 January 2019.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-47054419 Snow closes schools in Greater Manchester plus city airports].''bbc.co.uk''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.shropshirestar.com/news/transport/2017/12/08/snow-hits-shropshire-and-mid-wales---live-updates/ Heavy snow causes chaos in Shropshire – and there's more on the way].''shropshirestar.com''&lt;/ref&gt; A similar phenomenon can affect the city of [[Inverness]] in the [[Scottish Highlands]], where cold north east winds cause heavy snow to form in the [[Moray Firth]]; this was the case with the White Hogmanay of 2009, which caused the street party to be canceled. Northerly and north-westerly winds can cause the effect to occur over the [[Irish Sea]] and [[Bristol Channel]] feeding snow into [[south-west England]] and Eastern Ireland. Western Scotland and the Northern Ireland can also see snow showers from a north or north-westerly wind over the Atlantic.

Since the North Sea is relatively warm (around {{convert|13|C|1|disp=or}} at the beginning of winter, typically {{convert|10|to|6|°C|°F|disp=or}} by the end), sufficiently cold air aloft can create significant snowfalls in a relatively short period of time. The best-known example occurred in [[January 1987 South-East England snowfall|January 1987]], when record-breaking cold air (associated with an upper low) moved across the North Sea towards the UK. The end result was over two foot of snow for coastal areas, leading to communities being cut off for over a week. The latest of these events to affect Britain's east coast occurred on November 30, 2017, February 28, 2018 and 17 March 2018 in connection with the [[2018 Great Britain and Ireland cold wave]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-42181673 Snow falls on England's east coast beaches].''bbc.co.uk''&lt;/ref&gt; The 2nd event of Winter 2017/18 was particularly severe, with up to {{convert|27.5|in|cm}} falling in total over the 27th-28th.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2018/02/28/brutal-storm-is-pummeling-britain-with-heavy-snow-and-wicked-wind-chill/ Brutal storm is pummeling Britain with heavy snow and wicked wind chill].''washingtonpost.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, northern winds blowing across the relatively warm waters of the English Channel during cold spells can bring significant snowfall to the French region of Normandy, where snow drifts exceeding ten feet (3&amp;nbsp;m) were measured in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.76actu.fr/neige-le-mois-de-mars-de-tous-les-records-en-normandie_28850/|title=Rouen.

{{Music education|settings}}
A '''choir''' ({{IPAc-en|'|k|w|aɪər}}; also known as a '''chorale''' or '''chorus''') is a [[musical ensemble]] of singers. '''Choral music''', in turn, is the [[music]] written specifically for such an ensemble to perform. Choirs may perform music from the [[classical music]] repertoire, which spans from the [[Medieval music|medieval era]] to the present, or [[popular music]] repertoire. Most choirs are led by a [[conducting|conductor]], who leads the performances with arm and face gestures.

A body of singers who perform together as a group is called a choir or chorus. The former term is very often applied to groups affiliated with a church (whether or not they actually occupy the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]]) and the second to groups that perform in theatres or concert halls, but this distinction is far from rigid. Choirs may sing without instrumental accompaniment, with the accompaniment of a [[piano]] or [[pipe organ]], with a small ensemble (e.g., [[harpsichord]], [[cello]] and [[double bass]] for a [[Baroque music|Baroque]] piece), or with a full [[orchestra]] of 70 to 100 musicians.

The term ''choir'' has the secondary definition of a subset of an ensemble; thus one speaks of the &quot;woodwind choir&quot; of an orchestra, or different &quot;choirs&quot; of voices or instruments in a [[Venetian polychoral style|polychoral]] composition. In typical 18th- to 21st-century [[oratorio]]s and [[mass (music)|mass]]es, chorus or choir is usually understood to imply more than one singer per part, in contrast to the quartet of soloists also featured in these works.

==Structure==
Choirs are often led by a [[Conducting|conductor]] or choirmaster. Most often choirs consist of four sections intended to sing in four part harmony, but there is no limit to the number of possible parts as long as there is a singer available to sing the part: [[Thomas Tallis]] wrote a 40-part [[motet]] entitled ''[[Spem in alium]]'', for eight choirs of five parts each; [[Krzysztof Penderecki]]'s ''Stabat Mater'' is for three choirs of 16 voices each, a total of 48 parts. Other than four, the most common number of parts are three, five, six, and eight.

Choirs can sing with or without instrumental accompaniment. Singing without accompaniment is called [[a cappella]] singing (although the [[American Choral Directors Association]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://acda.org/page.asp?page=choralreviewinformationcj |title=See &quot;Choral Reviews Format&quot; on ACDA.org |access-date=2012-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403101844/http://acda.org/page.asp?page=choralreviewinformationcj |archive-date=2015-04-03 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; discourages this usage in favor of &quot;unaccompanied&quot;, since a cappella denotes singing &quot;as in the chapel&quot; and much unaccompanied music today is [[secular]]). Accompanying instruments vary widely, from only one instrument (a piano or pipe organ) to a full [[orchestra]] of 70 to 100 musicians; for rehearsals a [[piano]] or [[Organ (music)|organ]] accompaniment is often used, even if a different instrumentation is planned for performance, or if the choir is rehearsing unaccompanied music.

Many choirs perform in one or many locations such as a church, opera house, or school hall. In some cases choirs join up to become one &quot;mass&quot; choir that performs for a special concert. In this case they provide a series of songs or musical works to celebrate and provide entertainment to others.

===Role of conductor===
[[Conducting]] is the art of directing a [[music]]al performance, such as a choral [[concert]], by way of visible gestures with the hands, arms, face and head. The primary duties of the conductor or choirmaster are to unify [[musician|performers]], set the [[tempo]], execute clear preparations and beats ([[meter (music)|meter]]), and to listen critically and shape the sound of the ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=Conducting|title=Oxford Concise Dictionary of Music|author1=Michael Kennedy|author-link1=Michael Kennedy (music critic)|author2=Joyce Bourne Kennedy|edition=Fifth|publisher=Oxford University Press, Oxford|date=2007|isbn=9780199203833|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/conciseoxforddic2007kenn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conductor or choral director typically stands on a raised platform and he or she may or may not use a [[Baton (conducting)|baton]]; using a baton gives the conductor's gestures greater visibility, but many choral conductors prefer conducting with their hands for greater expressiveness, particularly when working with a smaller ensemble. In the 2010s, most conductors do not play an instrument when conducting, although in earlier periods of [[classical music]] history, leading an ensemble while playing an instrument was common. In [[Baroque music]] from the 1600s to the 1750s, conductors performing in the 2010s may lead an ensemble while playing a [[harpsichord]] or the violin (see [[Concertmaster]]). Conducting while playing a [[piano]] may also be done with [[musical theatre]] [[pit orchestra]]s. Communication is typically non-verbal during a performance (this is strictly the case in [[art music]], but in jazz [[big band]]s or large pop ensembles, there may be occasional spoken instructions). However, in [[rehearsal]]s, the conductor will often give verbal instructions to the ensemble, since they generally also serve as an artistic director who crafts the ensemble's interpretation of the music.

Conductors act as guides to the choirs they conduct. They choose the works to be performed and study their [[sheet music|scores]], to which they may make certain adjustments (e.g., regarding tempo, repetitions of sections, assignment of vocal solos and so on), work out their interpretation, and relay their vision to the singers. Choral conductors may also have to conduct instrumental ensembles such as [[orchestra]]s if the choir is singing a piece for choir and orchestra. They may also attend to organizational matters, such as scheduling rehearsals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.liveabout.com/what-is-a-conductor-2456662|title=The Conductor of an Ensemble|author=Espie Estrella|website=about.com|access-date=26 September 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415012250/http://musiced.about.com/od/musiccareer1/p/theconductor.htm |archive-date=April 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; planning a concert season, hearing [[audition]]s, and promoting their ensemble in the media.

== In worship services ==

===Accompaniment===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2020}}
[[File:Egyptian Alexandria Jews. Choir of Rabbin Moshe Cohen in Samuel Menashe synagogue. Alexandria.jpg|thumb|Egyptian Alexandria Jewish choir of Rabbin Moshe Cohen at Samuel Menashe synagogue, [[Alexandria]], Egypt]]
Most [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christian churches, some American Protestant groups, and traditional Jewish [[synagogue]]s do not accompany their songs with musical instruments. In churches of the [[Latin liturgical rites|Western Rite]] the accompanying instrument is usually the organ, although in [[colonial America]], the [[Moravian Church]] used groups of strings and winds. Many churches which use a contemporary worship format use a small amplified band to accompany the singing, and Roman Catholic Churches may use, at their discretion, additional orchestral accompaniment.

===Liturgical function===

In addition to leading of singing in which the [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregation]] participates, such as [[hymn]]s and service music, some church choirs sing full liturgies, including [[proper (liturgy)|propers]] (introit, gradual, communion antiphons appropriate for the different times of the [[liturgical year]]). Chief among these are the [[Anglican church music|Anglican]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] churches; far more common however is the performance of [[anthem]]s or [[motet]]s at designated times in the service.

== Types==

* Mixed choir (with male and female voices). This is perhaps the most common type, usually consisting of [[soprano]], [[alto]], [[tenor]], and [[bass (voice type)|bass]] voices, often abbreviated as [[SATB]]. Often one or more voices is divided into two, e.g., SSAATTBB, where each voice is divided into two parts, and SATBSATB, where the choir is divided into two semi-independent four-part choirs. Occasionally [[baritone]] voice is also used (e.g., SATBarB), often sung by the higher basses. In smaller choirs with fewer men, SAB, or Soprano, Alto, and Baritone arrangements allow the few men to share the role of both the tenor and bass in a single part.
* Male choirs with the same SATB voicing as mixed choirs, but with boys singing the upper part (often called [[Choirboy|trebles]] or [[boy soprano]]s) and men singing alto (in [[falsetto]]), also known as [[countertenor]]s. This format is typical of the British cathedral choir (e.g. [[Choir of King's College, Cambridge|King's College]], [[St_Paul%27s_Cathedral#Choir|St Paul's]], [[Westminster Abbey Choir School|Westminster Abbey]]).
* Women's choir, a choir of adult women, high voices only, usually consisting of soprano and alto voices, two parts in each, often abbreviated as [[SSAA (choir)|SSAA]], or as soprano I, soprano II, and alto, abbreviated SSA.
* [[Men's chorus]] ([[Männerchor]]), a choir of adult men, low voices only, usually consisting of two tenors, baritone, and bass, often abbreviated as TTBB (or ATBB if the upper part sings [[falsetto]] in alto range). ATBB may be seen in some [[barbershop quartet]] music.
* Children's choir, often two-part SA or three-part SSA, sometimes more voices. This includes [[boy choir]]s. Boy choirs typically sing SSA or SSAA, sometimes including a cambiata/tenor part for boys/young men whose voices are changing and a baritone part for boys/young men whose voices have changed.

=== In schools ===
{{expand section|date=April 2020|1=British cathedral choirs are usually also made from pupils enrolled in schools... This section is otherwise very US-centric.}}
In the United States, middle schools and high schools often offer choir as a class or activity for students. Some choirs participate in competitions. One kind of choir popular in high schools is [[show choir]]. Middle school and high school is an important time, as it is when students' voices are changing. Although girls experience [[voice change]], it is much more drastic in boys. A lot of literature in music education has been focused on how male voice change works and how to help adolescent male singers.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Ryan A.|date=2014-10-01|title=The Impacts of the Voice Change, Grade Level, and Experience on the Singing Self-Efficacy of Emerging Adolescent Males|journal=[[Journal of Research in Music Education]]|volume=62|issue=3|pages=277–290|doi=10.1177/0022429414544748|s2cid=143947270|issn=0022-4294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research done by John Cooksey categorizes male voice change into five stages, and most middle school boys are in the early stages of change.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; The vocal range of both male and female students may be limited while their voice is changing, and choir teachers must be able to adapt, which can be a challenge to teaching this age range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Russell L.|date=September 2007|title=Junior High/Middle School Choirs|journal=Choral Journal|volume=48|issue=3|pages=41–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

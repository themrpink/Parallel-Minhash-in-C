In [[2007 United Kingdom floods|July 2007, Gloucestershire suffered the worst flooding]] in recorded British history, with tens of thousands of residents affected. The [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] conducted the largest peacetime domestic operation in its history to rescue over 120 residents from flood affected areas. The damage was estimated at over £2&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6911226.stm |title=Flood crisis grows as rivers rise |work=BBC News |date=23 July 2007 |accessdate=15 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903224122/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6911226.stm |archive-date=3 September 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography and environment==
Gloucestershire has three main landscape areas, a large part of the Cotswolds, the Royal Forest of Dean and the Severn Vale. The Cotswolds take up a large portion of the east and south of the county, The Forest of Dean taking up the west, with the Severn and its valley running between these features. The Daffodil Way in the [[River Leadon|Leadon]] Valley, on the border of Gloucestershire and Herefordshire surrounding the village of [[Dymock]], is known for its many spring flowers, orchards, and woodland, which attracts many walkers.

==Education==
===Secondary schools===
{{see|List of schools in Gloucestershire}}

Gloucestershire has mainly comprehensive schools with seven selective schools; two are in Stroud, [[Stroud High School]] for girls and [[Marling School]] for boys, one in Cheltenham, [[Pate's Grammar School|Pate's Grammar]], and four in Gloucester, [[Sir Thomas Rich's School|Sir Thomas Rich's]] for boys (aged 11–18) and girls (aged 16–18, in the sixth form), and [[Denmark Road High School]] and [[Ribston Hall High School|Ribston Hall]] for girls and [[The Crypt School|The Crypt]] which is mixed. There are 42 state secondary schools, not including [[sixth form college]]s, and 12 independent schools, including [[Cheltenham Ladies' College]], [[Cheltenham College]] and [[Dean Close School]]. All but about two schools in each district have a sixth form, but the Forest of Dean only has two schools with sixth forms. All schools in South Gloucestershire have sixth forms.

===Higher and further education===
[[File:Oxstalls.JPG|thumb|A campus of the [[University of Gloucestershire]]]]
Gloucestershire has two universities, the [[University of Gloucestershire]] and the [[Royal Agricultural University]], and four higher and further education colleges, [[Gloucestershire College]], [[Cirencester College]], [[South Gloucestershire and Stroud College]] and the [[Royal Forest of Dean College]]. Each has campuses at multiple locations throughout the county.

The [[University of the West of England]] also has three locations in Gloucestershire; an associate faculty ([[Hartpury College]]) specialising in animal behaviour and welfare, agricultural and sports-related courses in [[Hartpury, Gloucestershire]]; a regional centre at the [[Gloucester Docks]], Alexandra Warehouse, specialising in Adult and Mental Health Nursing; and [[Frenchay|Frenchay Campus]] in [[South Gloucestershire]].

=== Green belt ===
{{main|Avon Green Belt|Gloucester and Cheltenham Green Belt}}
The county has two green belt areas, the first covers the southern area in the South Gloucestershire district, to protect outlying villages and towns between Thornbury and Chipping Sodbury from the [[urban sprawl]] of the [[Bristol Built-up Area|Bristol conurbation]]. The second belt lies around Gloucester, Cheltenham, and Bishop's Cleeve, to afford those areas and villages in between a protection from urban sprawl and further convergence. Both belts intersect with the boundaries of the Cotswolds [[AONB]].

==Antiquities==
There are a variety of religious buildings across the county, notably the cathedral of [[Gloucester Cathedral|Gloucester]], the [[Tewkesbury Abbey|abbey church]] of [[Tewkesbury]] (which is over 500 years old and has the tallest Norman tower in England), and the church of [[Cirencester]]. Of the abbey of [[Hailes Abbey|Hailes]] near [[Winchcombe]], founded by [[Richard, Earl of Cornwall]], in 1246, little more than the foundations are left, but these have been excavated and fragments have been brought to light.

[[File:October plenty.jpg|thumb|Parish Church of St. Mary, Fairford]]
Most of the old [[market town]]s have [[parish church]]es. At [[Deerhurst]] near Tewkesbury and [[Bishop's Cleeve]] near [[Cheltenham]], there are churches of special interest on account of the pre-Norman work they retain. There is also a [[Perpendicular Period|Perpendicular]] church in [[Lechlade]], and that at [[Fairford]] was built (c. 1500), according to tradition, to contain a series of [[stained-glass windows]] which are said to have been brought from the [[Netherlands]]. These are, however, adjudged to be of English workmanship.

Other notable buildings include [[Calcot Manor|Calcot Barn]] in Calcot, a relic of [[Kingswood Abbey]]. [[Thornbury Castle]] is a [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] country house, the pretensions of which evoked the jealousy of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Thomas Wolsey|Wolsey]] against its builder, [[Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham|Edward Stafford, duke of Buckingham]], who was [[decapitation|beheaded]] in 1521. Near Cheltenham is the 15th-century mansion of [[Southam, Gloucestershire|Southam de la Bere]], of timber and stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.simonthurgoodimages.co.uk/outandabout/gloucestershire.asp|title=Simon Thurgood Images: Out and About in Gloucestershire|website=www.simonthurgoodimages.co.uk|access-date=2019-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memorials of the de la Bere family appear in the church at Cleeve. The mansion contains a tiled floor from [[Hailes Abbey]]. At Great Badminton is the mansion and vast domain of the Beauforts (formerly of the Botelers and others), on the south-eastern boundary of the county. [[Berkeley Castle]] at over 800 years old and the ruins of [[Great Witcombe Roman Villa|Witcombe Roman Villa]] at Great Witcombe are also notable heritage features.

There are several [[royal residence]]s in Gloucestershire, including [[Highgrove House]], [[Gatcombe Park]], and (formerly) [[Nether Lypiatt Manor]].

An annual &quot;[[Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake|cheese-rolling]]&quot; event takes place at Cooper's Hill, near [[Brockworth, Gloucestershire|Brockworth]] and the [[Cotswold Games]] occurred within the county.

'''Domesday Book''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|uː|m|z|d|eɪ}} or {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|d|oʊ|m|z|d|eɪ}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/domesday+book?show=0&amp;t=1318466370 |title=Domesday Book |work=Merriam-Webster Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/domesday+book |title=Domesday Book |dictionary=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latin]]: ''Liber de Wintonia'' &quot;Book of [[Winchester, Hampshire|Winchester]]&quot;) is a manuscript record of the &quot;Great Survey&quot; of much of England and parts of Wales completed in 1086 by order of King [[William the Conqueror]]. The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' states:&lt;ref name=&quot;asc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/657 |translator1-first=J. A. |translator1-last=Giles |translator1-link=John Allen Giles |translator2-first=J. |translator2-last=Ingram |editor2-link=James Ingram (academic) |title=The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle |publisher=Project Gutenberg |year=1996 |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Then, at the midwinter [1085], was the king in [[Gloucester]] with his council ... . After this had the king a large meeting, and very deep consultation with his council, about this land; how it was occupied, and by what sort of men. Then sent he his men over all England into each [[shire]]; commissioning them to find out &quot;How many [[Hundred (county division)|hundreds]] of [[Hide (unit)|hide]]s were in the shire, what land the king himself had, and what stock upon the land; or, what dues he ought to have by the year from the shire.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Written in [[Medieval Latin]], it was [[Scribal abbreviation|highly abbreviated]] and included some vernacular native terms without Latin equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;Note: One common abbreviation was {{smallcaps|TRE}}, short for the Latin ''Tempore Regis Eduardi'', &quot;in the time of King Edward (the Confessor)&quot;, meaning the period immediately before the Norman conquest&lt;/ref&gt; The survey's main purpose was to determine what taxes had been owed during the reign of King [[Edward the Confessor]], thereby allowing William to reassert the rights of the Crown and assess where power lay after a wholesale redistribution of land following the [[Norman conquest]].

The assessors' reckoning of a man's holdings and their values, as recorded in Domesday Book, was [[wikt:dispositive|dispositive]] and without appeal. The name &quot;Domesday Book&quot; ([[Middle English]] for &quot;Doomsday Book&quot;) came into use in the 12th century.&lt;ref name=Harvard&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wZuiVjVgdsgC&amp;pg=PA250 |title=The Collected Works of Ralph Waldo Emerson: English Traits|volume =5|page= 250|number= 65.15|author=Emerson, Ralph Waldo|author2=Burkholder, Robert E.

&lt;blockquote&gt;for as the sentence of that strict and terrible last account cannot be evaded by any skilful subterfuge, so when this book is appealed to ... its sentence cannot be quashed or set aside with impunity. That is why we have called the book &quot;the Book of Judgement&quot;{{nbsp}}... because its decisions, like those of the [[Last Judgement]], are unalterable.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The manuscript is held at [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] at [[Kew]], London. In 2011, the Open Domesday site made the manuscript available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-13395454 |title=Domesday Reloaded project: The 1086 version |work=BBC News |first=Rory |last=Cellan-Jones |date=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

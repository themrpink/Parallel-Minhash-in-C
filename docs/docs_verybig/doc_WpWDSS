&quot;What intellectuals don't like is success,&quot; said Belmondo. &quot;Success in France is always looked down on, not by the public, but by intellectuals. If I'm nude in a film, that's fine for the intellectuals. But if I jump from a helicopter, they think it's terrible.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;theatre&quot;/&gt;

Belmondo kept to commercial films: ''[[Le Marginal]]'' (1983), a cop thriller; ''[[Les Morfalous]]'' (1984), a World War Two French Foreign legion story; ''[[Happy Easter]]'', a comedy; ''[[Hold-Up (1985 film)|Hold-Up]]'' (1985), a comic heist story (remade in Hollywood as ''[[Quick Change]]''); ''[[Le Solitaire (film)|Le Solitaire]]'' (1988), playing another policeman. The last of these was a notable [[box office bomb|box office disappointment]].

===Return to theatre===
In 1987 he returned to the theatre after a 26 year absence in a production of ''Kean'', adapted by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] from the novel by Alexander Dumas. &quot;I did theater for ten years before going into movies and every year I planned to go back,&quot; he recalled. &quot;I returned before I became an old man.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;theatre&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Belmondo Revels in Playing Cyrano in Paris: The archetypal hood plays a poet to sold-out houses.|first=Alan|last=Riding|newspaper=New York Times|date=14 March 1990|page= C13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kean'' was a hit, running for a year. In 1990 he played the title role in [[Cyrano de Bergerac]] on the stage in Paris, another highly successful production.&lt;ref name=&quot;theatre&quot;/&gt;

Belmondo claimed there were &quot;several reasons&quot; why he made fewer films in the 1980s. &quot;I'm now a producer so it takes time to organise things,&quot; he said. &quot;But it's also difficult to find good screenplays in France. We have serious writing problems here. And I'd prefer to do theater for a long time than take on a mediocre film.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;theatre&quot;/&gt;

For [[Claude Lelouch]] he starred in and co produced ''[[Itinerary of a Spoiled Child]]'' (1988). He had a small role in ''[[One Hundred and One Nights]]'' (1995) then the lead in Lelouch's version of ''[[Les Misérables (1995 film)|Les Misérables]]'' (1995). ''[[Désiré (film)|Désiré]]'' (1996) was a comedy; ''[[Une chance sur deux]]'' (1998) reunited him with Alain Delon; ''[[Peut-être]]'' (1999) was a science fiction comedy.

==Honours==
He was made ''Chevalier'' (Knight) of the [[Ordre national du Mérite]], promoted ''Officier'' (Officer) in 1986 and promoted ''Commandeur'' (Commander) in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;

In 2010 the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards]] gave him a Career Achievement award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lafca.net/years/2009.htm ]{{dead link|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belmondo attended the ceremony and made appearances in the Los Angeles area.

==Personal life==
On December 4, 1952, Belmondo married Élodie Constantin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Riggs|title=Contemporary Theatre, Film and Television, Volume 31|year=2000|publisher=Gale / Cengage Learning|isbn=0787646369|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he had three children: Patricia (1953–1993), who was killed in a fire, Florence (born 1958) and [[Paul Belmondo|Paul]] (born 1963). Belmondo and Constantin separated in 1965. She filed for divorce in September 1966, and it was finalized on January 5, 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/newspage/382541800/|title=The Los Angeles Times from Los Angeles, California on January 6, 1968 · 16|website=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had relationships with [[Ursula Andress]] from 1965 to 1972,&lt;ref&gt;Earl Wilson (16 July 1972). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19720716&amp;id=Lj4gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nGYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5184,967490&amp;hl=en It Happened Last Night].

In 1989, Belmondo was in his mid-50s when he met 24-year-old dancer Natty Tardivel. The couple lived together for over a decade before marrying in 2002. On 13 August 2003, Tardivel gave birth to then 70-year-old Belmondo's fourth child, Stella Eva Angelina. Belmondo and Tardivel divorced in 2008.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==In popular culture==
Belmondo is saluted in a 1967 episode of the U.S. television sitcom ''[[Get Smart]]''. In the episode &quot;The Spirit is Willing&quot; a top agent of the sinister spy agency [[KAOS (Get Smart)|KAOS]] is named Paul John Mondebello, an obvious alteration of Belmondo's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/TelevisionCity/3101/3rd.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000312082653/http://www.geocities.com/TelevisionCity/3101/3rd.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=12 March 2000|title=The Complete Get Smart Guide - Episode Guides: Third Season|date=12 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also mentioned in a song about &quot;Masculinity&quot; in the play ''La Cage Aux Folles''. A poster of him as &quot;A bad guy, a good-looking bad guy&quot; is in Rachel's apartment in &quot;The Light of Day&quot; by Graham Swift. In 1968 a Yugoslavian quartet &quot;[[:hr:Kvartet 4M|Kvartet 4M]]&quot; recorded a song &quot;Bebel&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/4m-Hvala/release/2710040 |title=&quot;4m&quot;* - Hvala (Vinyl) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |accessdate=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; about him.

Belmondo's facial features were the inpiration for the character of [[Blueberry_%28comics%29|Blueberry]] in the Franco-Belgian comic book series of the same name by [[Jean-Michel Charlier]] and [[Jean Giraud | Jean &quot;Mœbius&quot; Giraud]].

In the 1966 [[Donovan]] song &quot;Sunny South Kensington&quot;, Belmondo's and [[Mary Quant]]'s drug use is mentioned in the lyric: &quot;Jean-Paul Belmondo and-a Mary Quant got [[wikt:stoned#Adjective|stoned]], to say the least&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mellow Yellow/Sunny South Kensington 45 rpm single, [[Mellow Yellow]] LP album, side 2, track 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The book [[Youth in Revolt]] by author [[C._D._Payne|C.D. Payne]] and its sequels refer to Belmondo several times and at one point feature the main character going to Mexico and getting plastic surgery in order to resemble Belmondo.

The Manga [[Stardust Crusaders]] features a main character named Jean-Pierre Polnareff, whose first name is a reference to Belmondo.

The Horror-Platformer series [[Castlevania]] Prominently features the Belmont family, which could be a reference to Belmondo, given their Japanese last name is also Belmondo.

In the Netflix series, [[The_Spy_(TV_series)|The Spy]], a bartender is convinced to do a Belmondo impersonation, after being bribed by the Israeli undercover spy, [[Eli Cohen]] (episode 3, &quot;Alone in Damascus&quot;).

The main protagonist in the manga [[Cobra_(manga)#Production|Cobra]], is inspired from Belmondo and his &quot;phlegmatic style&quot;, specifically from his characters on ''[[Breathless_(1960_film)|Breathless]]'' (1960) and ''[[That Man from Rio]]'' (1964).

'''Pope Gelasius II''' (c. 1060/1064 – 29 January 1119), born '''Giovanni Caetani''' or '''Giovanni da Gaeta''' (also called ''Coniulo''),&lt;ref&gt;John-Peter Pham, ''Heirs of the Fisherman'', (Oxford University Press, 2004), 12.&lt;/ref&gt; was head of the [[Catholic Church]] and ruler of the [[Papal States]] from 24 January 1118 to his death in 1119. A monk of Monte Cassino and chancellor of [[Pope Paschal II]], Caetani was unanimously elected to succeed him. In doing so he also inherited the [[investiture controversy|conflict]] with [[Emperor Henry V]] over investiture. Gelasius spent a good part of his brief papacy in exile.

==Biography==
===Early life===
He was born between 1060 and 1064 at [[Gaeta]] into the [[Pisa]]n branch of the [[Caetani]] family, and became a monk of [[Monte Cassino]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; [[Pope Urban II]], who wished to improve the style of papal documents, brought him to Rome and made Caetani a papal subdeacon (August 1088) and [[cardinal deacon]] of [[Santa Maria in Cosmedin]] (probably on 23 September 1088). As [[chancellor of the Holy Roman Church]] from 1089 to 1118, he drastically reformed the papal administration, establishing a permanent staff of clerks for the papacy, overcoming the previous custom of relying on Roman notaries to write papal documents, and introducing the minuscule curial script. His tenure also established the precedent of the papal chancellor always being a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] and holding the office for life or until elected pope.

===Pontificate===
Shortly after his [[papal election, 1118|unanimous election]] to succeed [[Pope Paschal II]] in 1118, he was seized by [[Cencio II Frangipane]], a partisan of [[Emperor Henry V]], but was freed by a general uprising of the Romans on his behalf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06407a.htm Loughlin, James. &quot;Pope Gelasius II.&quot; The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 25 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Henry V sought to enforce the privilege of investiture conceded (and later revoked in 1112) by the papacy, under duress, by Paschal II. He drove Gelasius II from Rome in March 1118, pronounced his election null and void, and set up Maurice Bourdin, Archbishop of Braga, as antipope under the name of [[Antipope Gregory VIII|Gregory VIII]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Gelasius II fled to Gaeta, where he was ordained a priest on 9 March 1118 and on the following day received episcopal consecration. He at once [[excommunication|excommunicated]] Henry V and the [[antipope]] and, under [[Italo-Normans|Norman]] protection, was able to return to Rome in July. But the disturbances of the imperialist party, especially those of the [[Frangipani family|Frangipani]], who attacked the Pope while celebrating Mass in the church of [[Santa Prassede|St. Prassede]], compelled Gelasius II to go once more into exile. He set out for France, consecrating the cathedral of [[Pisa]] on the way, and arrived at [[Marseille]] in October. He was received with great enthusiasm at [[Avignon]], [[Montpellier]] and other cities, held a synod at [[Vienne]] in January 1119, and was planning to hold a general council to settle the investiture contest when he died at [[Abbey of Cluny]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Gelasius|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''ecoregion''' ('''ecological region''') or '''ecozone''' ('''ecological zone''') is an [[ecology|ecologically]] and geographically defined area that is smaller than a [[bioregion]], which in turn is smaller than a [[biogeographic realm]]. Ecoregions cover relatively large areas of land or water, and contain characteristic, geographically distinct assemblages of natural [[community (ecology)|communities]] and [[species]]. The [[biodiversity]] of [[flora (plants)|flora]], [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] and [[ecosystems]] that characterise an ecoregion tends to be distinct from that of other ecoregions. In theory, biodiversity or conservation ecoregions are relatively large areas of land or water where the probability of encountering different species and communities at any given point remains relatively constant, within an acceptable range of variation (largely undefined at this point).

Three caveats are appropriate for all bio-geographic mapping approaches. Firstly, no single bio-geographic framework is optimal for all taxa. Ecoregions reflect the best compromise for as many taxa as possible. Secondly, ecoregion boundaries rarely form abrupt edges; rather, [[ecotone]]s and mosaic [[habitat]]s bound them. Thirdly, most ecoregions contain habitats that differ from their assigned [[biome]]. Biogeographic provinces may originate due to various barriers, including physical (plate tectonics, topographic highs), climatic (latitudinal variation, seasonal range) and ocean chemical related (salinity, oxygen levels).

==History==
The history of the term is somewhat vague, and it had been used in many contexts: forest classifications (Loucks, 1962), [[biome]] classifications (Bailey, 1976, 2014), [[biogeography|biogeographic]] classifications ([[World Wildlife Fund|WWF]]/[[Global 200]] scheme of Olson &amp; Dinerstein, 1998), etc.&lt;ref&gt;Loucks, O. L. (1962). A forest classification for the Maritime Provinces. ''Proceedings of the Nova Scotian Institute of Science'', 25(Part 2), 85-167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, R. G. 1976. ''Ecoregions of the United States'' (map). Ogden, Utah: USDA Forest Service, Intermountain Region. 1:7,500,000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, R. G. 2002. ''Ecoregion-based design for sustainability''. New York: Springer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mDrhBwAAQBAJ].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com.br&quot;&gt;Bailey, R. G. 2014. ''Ecoregions: The Ecosystem Geography of the. Oceans and Continents''. 2nd ed., Springer, 180 pp., [https://books.google.com/books?id=fnG8BAAAQBAJ].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, D. M. &amp; E. Dinerstein (1998). The Global 200: A representation approach to conserving the Earth's most biologically valuable ecoregions. ''Conservation Biol.'' 12:502–515.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ecoregion applied by Bailey gives more importance to ecological criteria and climate, while the WWF concept gives more importance to biogeography, that is, the [[Species distribution|distribution]] of distinct species assemblages.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com.br&quot;/&gt;

An ecoregion is a &quot;recurring pattern of ecosystems associated with characteristic combinations of [[soil]] and [[landform]] that characterise that region&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Brunckhorst, D. (2000). ''Bioregional planning: resource management beyond the new millennium.'' Harwood Academic Publishers: Sydney, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; Omernik (2004) elaborates on this by defining ecoregions as: &quot;areas within which there is spatial coincidence in characteristics of [[geographical]] phenomena associated with differences in the quality, health, and integrity of [[ecosystems]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Omernik |first=J. M. |year=2004 |title=Perspectives on the Nature and Definition of Ecological Regions |work=Environmental Management |page=34 – Supplement 1, pp.27–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Characteristics of geographical phenomena&quot; may include [[geology]], [[physiography]], vegetation, climate, [[hydrology]], terrestrial and [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]] [[fauna]], and soils, and may or may not include the impacts of human activity (e.g. land use patterns, vegetation changes). There is significant, but not absolute, spatial correlation among these characteristics, making the delineation of ecoregions an imperfect science. Another complication is that environmental conditions across an ecoregion boundary may change very gradually, e.g. the prairie-forest transition in the midwestern United States, making it difficult to identify an exact dividing boundary. Such transition zones are called [[ecotone]]s.

Ecoregions can be categorized using an [[algorithm]]ic approach or a holistic, &quot;weight-of-evidence&quot; approach where the importance of various factors may vary. An example of the algorithmic approach is [[Robert Bailey (geographer)|Robert Bailey]]'s work for the U.S. Forest Service, which uses a hierarchical classification that first divides land areas into very large regions based on climatic factors, and subdivides these regions, based first on dominant potential vegetation, and then by [[geomorphology]] and soil characteristics. The weight-of-evidence approach is exemplified by James Omernik's work for the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], subsequently adopted (with modification) for [[North America]] by the [[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]].

The intended purpose of ecoregion delineation may affect the method used. For example, the [[World Wildlife Fund|WWF]] ecoregions were developed to aid in biodiversity conservation planning, and place a greater emphasis than the Omernik or Bailey systems on floral and faunal differences between regions. The WWF classification defines an ecoregion as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A large area of land or water that contains a geographically distinct assemblage of natural communities that:
:(a) Share a large majority of their species and ecological dynamics;
:(b) Share similar environmental conditions, and;
:(c) Interact ecologically in ways that are critical for their long-term persistence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In response to the [[Hundred Days|&quot;hundred day&quot; restoration]] of [[Napoleon I of France]] in 1815, Alsace along with other frontier provinces of France was occupied by foreign forces from 1815 to 1818,&lt;ref&gt;Veve, Thomas Dwight (1992). ''The Duke of Wellington and the British army of occupation in France, 1815–1818'', pp. 20–21. Greenwood Press, Westport, Connecticut, United States.&lt;/ref&gt; including over 280,000 soldiers and 90,000 horses in Bas-Rhin alone. This had grave effects on trade and the economy of the region since former overland trade routes were switched to newly opened [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] seaports.

The population grew rapidly, from 800,000 in 1814 to 914,000 in 1830 and 1,067,000 in 1846. The combination of economic and demographic factors led to hunger, housing shortages and a lack of work for young people. Thus, it is not surprising that people left Alsace, not only for Paris – where the Alsatian community grew in numbers, with famous members such as [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann]] – but also for more distant places like Russia and the [[Austrian Empire]], to take advantage of the new opportunities offered there: Austria had conquered lands in Eastern Europe from the [[Ottoman Empire]] and offered generous terms to colonists as a way of consolidating its hold on the new territories. Many Alsatians also began to sail to the United States, settling in many areas from 1820 to 1850.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060504053923/http://members.cox.net/smithgen/sources/ships/ships18201850notes.htm#sully1838match Cox.net]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1843 and 1844, sailing ships bringing immigrant families from Alsace arrived at the port of New York. Some settled in Texas and Illinois, many to farm or to seek success in commercial ventures: for example, the sailing ships ''Sully'' (in May 1843) and ''Iowa'' (in June 1844) brought families who set up homes in northern Illinois and northern Indiana. Some Alsatian immigrants were noted for their roles in 19th-century American economic development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://will.ilgenweb.net/bios/scheidtj.txt Ilgenweb.net] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723154212/http://will.ilgenweb.net/bios/scheidtj.txt |date=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others ventured to Canada to settle in southwestern [[Ontario]], notably [[Waterloo County]].

====Jews====
{{main|History of the Jews in Alsace}}
In contrast to the rest of France the Jews in Alsace had not been expelled during the Middle Ages. By 1790, the [[Jewish]] population of Alsace was approximately 22,500, about 3% of the provincial population. They were highly segregated and subject to long-standing [[antisemitic]] regulations. They maintained their own customs, [[Yiddish]] language, and historic traditions within the tightly knit ghettos; they adhered to Jewish law. Jews were barred from most cities and instead lived in villages. They concentrated in trade, services, and especially in money lending. They financed about a third of the mortgages in Alsace. Official tolerance grew during the French Revolution, with full emancipation in 1791. However, local antisemitism also increased and Napoleon turned hostile in 1806, imposing a one-year moratorium on all debts owed to Jews.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} In the 1830–1870 era, most Jews moved to the cities, where they integrated and acculturated, as antisemitism sharply declined. By 1831, the state began paying salaries to official rabbis, and in 1846 a special legal oath for Jews was discontinued. Antisemitic local riots occasionally occurred, especially during the Revolution of 1848. The merger of Alsace into Germany in 1871–1918 lessened antisemitic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Vicki |last=Caron |chapter=Alsace |editor-first=Richard S. |editor-last=Levy |title=Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution |year=2005 |volume=1 |pages=13–16 |isbn=9781851094394 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tdn6FFZklkcC&amp;pg=PA13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution of the ''Reichsland'' of 1911 reserved one seat in the first chamber of the ''Landtag'' for a representative of the Jewish Consistory of Alsace-Lorraine (besides two seats respectively for the two main Christian denominations).

===Struggle between France and united Germany===

[[File:Alsace4.jpg|thumb|Traditional costumes of Alsace]]
The [[Franco-Prussian War]], which [[Causes of the Franco-Prussian War|started]] in July 1870, saw France defeated in May 1871 by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and other German states. The end of the war led to the [[unification of Germany]]. [[Otto von Bismarck]] annexed Alsace and northern Lorraine to the new [[German Empire]] in 1871. France ceded more than 90% of Alsace and one-fourth of Lorraine, as stipulated in the [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|treaty of Frankfurt]]; [[Belfort]], the largest Alsatian town south of Mulhouse, remained French. Unlike other member states of the German federation, which had governments of their own, the new ''Imperial territory of Alsace-Lorraine'' was under the sole authority of the [[Kaiser]], administered directly by the imperial government in Berlin. Between 100,000 and 130,000 Alsatians (of a total population of about a million and a half) chose to remain French citizens and leave ''Reichsland Elsaß-Lothringen'', many of them resettling in [[French Algeria]] as [[Pieds-Noirs]]. Only in 1911 was Alsace-Lorraine granted some measure of autonomy, which was manifested also in a flag and an anthem ([[Elsässisches Fahnenlied]]). In 1913, however, the [[Saverne Affair]] (French: Incident de Saverne) showed the limits of this new tolerance of the Alsatian identity.
[[File:Adolphe Braun Alsace costume.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An Alsatian woman in traditional costume, photographed by [[Adolphe Braun]]]]

During the First World War, to avoid ground fights between brothers, many Alsatians served as sailors in the [[Kaiserliche Marine]] and took part in the Naval mutinies that led to the abdication of the Kaiser in November 1918, which left Alsace-Lorraine without a nominal head of state. The sailors returned home and tried to found an independent republic. While [[Jacques Peirotes]], at this time deputy at the ''Landrat Elsass-Lothringen'' and just elected [[List of mayors of Strasbourg|mayor of Strasbourg]], proclaimed the forfeiture of the German Empire and the advent of the [[French Republic]], a self-proclaimed government of Alsace-Lorraine declared its independence as the &quot;[[November 1918 in Alsace-Lorraine|Republic of Alsace-Lorraine]]&quot;. French troops entered Alsace less than two weeks later to quash the worker strikes and remove the newly established Soviets and revolutionaries from power. With the arrival of the French soldiers, many Alsatians and local Prussian/German administrators and bureaucrats cheered the re-establishment of order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ina.fr/archivespourtous/popup.php?vue=partenaire&amp;partenariat=1df07ccad656b16c3f7dcd36ce620f11 Archive video]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] had insisted that the ''région'' was self-ruling by legal status, as its constitution had stated it was bound to the sole authority of the Kaiser and not to the German state, France would allow no plebiscite, as granted by the [[League of Nations]] to some eastern German territories at this time, because the French regarded the Alsatians as Frenchmen liberated from German rule. Germany ceded the region to France under the [[Treaty of Versailles]].

Policies forbidding the use of German and requiring French were promptly introduced.&lt;ref&gt;However, propaganda for elections was allowed to go with a German translation from 1919 to 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In order not to antagonize the Alsatians, the region was not subjected to some legal changes that had occurred in the rest of France between 1871 and 1919, such as the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State|1905 French law on the separation of Church and State]].

[[File:Ensemble Timbres Hindenburg surchargés par Elsass.JPG|thumb|upright|German stamps of [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] marked with &quot;Elsaß&quot; (1940)]]

Alsace-Lorraine was occupied by Germany in 1940 during the Second World War. Although it was never formally annexed, Alsace-Lorraine was incorporated into the [[Nazi Germany|Greater German Reich]], which had been restructured into [[Reichsgau]]. Alsace was merged with [[Baden]], and Lorraine with the [[Saarland]], to become part of a planned [[Gau Westmark|Westmark]]. During the war, 130,000 young men from Alsace and Lorraine were conscripted into the German armies against their will ([[malgré-nous]]). There were some volunteers for the [[Waffen SS]].,&lt;ref&gt;Stéphane Courtois, Mark Kramer. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=H1jsgYCoRioC&amp;pg=PA323 Livre noir du Communisme: crimes, terreur, répression]''. [[Harvard University Press]], 1999. p.323. {{ISBN|0-674-07608-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they were outnumbered by conscripts of the 1926-1927 classes. 30 of said Waffen SS were involved in the [[Oradour-sur-Glane]] massacre (29 conscripts, one volunteer). A third of the malgré-nous perished on the Eastern front. In July 1944, 1500 [[malgré-nous]] were released from Soviet captivity and sent to [[Algiers]], where they joined the [[Free French Forces]].

=== After World War II ===
Today, the territory is in certain areas subject to some laws that are significantly different from the rest of France – this is known as the [[Local law in Alsace-Moselle|local law]].

In more recent years, the Alsatian language is again being promoted by local, national, and European authorities as an element of the region's identity. Alsatian is taught in schools (but not mandatory) as one of the regional languages of France. German is also taught as a foreign language in local [[kindergarten]]s and schools. There is a growing network of schools proposing full immersion in Alsatian dialect and in Standard German, called ''[[ABCM-Zweisprachigkeit]]'' (ABCM -&gt; French [[acronym]] for &quot;Association for Bilingualism in the Classroom from Kindergarten onwards&quot;, Zweisprachigkeit -&gt; German for &quot;Bilingualism&quot;). However, the [[Constitution of France]] still requires that French be the only official language of the Republic.

==Geography==

===Climate===
Alsace has a [[humid continental climate|semi-continental climate]] at low altitude and a [[continental climate]] at high altitude. There is fairly low precipitation because the [[Vosges mountains|Vosges]] protect it from the west. The city of [[Colmar]] has a [[sunlight|sunny]] [[microclimate]]; it is the second driest city in France, with an annual precipitation of 600&amp;nbsp;mm, making it ideal for ''[[vin d'Alsace]]'' (''Alsatian wine'').

===Topography===
[[File:Alsaceregionsnaturelles.jpg|thumb|Topographic map of Alsace]]

Alsace has an area of 8,283&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, making it the smallest ''[[Regions of France|région]]'' of [[metropolitan France]]. It is almost four times longer than it is wide, corresponding to a plain between the [[Rhine]] in the east and the [[Vosges mountains]] in the west.

It includes the ''[[departments of France|départements]]'' of [[Haut-Rhin]] and [[Bas-Rhin]] (known previously as [[Sundgau]] and [[Nordgau (Alsace)|Nordgau]]). It borders Germany on the north and the east, Switzerland and [[Franche-Comté]] on the south, and [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] on the west.

Several [[valley]]s are also found in the ''région''. Its highest point is the ''[[Grand Ballon]]'' in [[Haut-Rhin]], which reaches a height of 1426&amp;nbsp;m.

The [[Ried (natural region)|ried]] lies along the [[Rhine]].

===Geology===
[[File:Grandballonsud.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Grand Ballon]], southern face, seen from the valley of the [[Thur (France)|Thur]]]]

Alsace is the part of the plain of the Rhine located at the west of the [[Rhine]], on its left bank. It is a [[rift]] or [[graben]], from the [[Oligocene]] [[geologic time scale|epoch]], associated with its [[horst (geology)|horsts]]: the [[Vosges Mountains|Vosges]] and the [[Black Forest]].

The [[Jura Mountains]], formed by slip (induced by the alpine uplift) of the [[Mesozoic]] cover on the [[Triassic]] formations, goes through the area of [[Belfort]].

* [[Vosges and Jura coal mining basins]]

====Flora====
It contains many forests, primarily in the [[Vosges Mountains|Vosges]] and in [[Bas-Rhin]] (Haguenau Forest).

==Governance==
As of 2015, Alsace is administered through [[Grand Est]].

===Former administrative divisions===
[[File:Alsace Adve2.PNG|350px|thumb|Administrative map of Alsace showing départements, arrondissements and communes]]

Until its abolition in 2015, the [[Alsace Regional Council|Alsace region]] was divided into 2 [[Departments of France|departments]], 13 [[Arrondissements of France|departmental arrondissements]], 75 [[cantons of France|cantons]] (not shown here), and 904 [[communes of France|communes]]:

===Demographics===
Alsace's population increased to 1,872,949 in 2014. It has regularly increased over time, except in wartime, by both natural growth and [[human migration|migration]]. This growth has even accelerated at the end of the 20th century. [[INSEE]] estimates that its population will grow 12.9% to 19.5% between 1999 and 2030.

[[File:St Stephen's Church Mulhouse FRA 001.JPG|thumb|right|''[[Temple Saint-Étienne]]'' (architect [[Jean-Baptiste Schacre]]), the main [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] church of [[Mulhouse]]]]
Alsace is generally seen as the most religious of all the French regions. Most of the Alsatian population is [[Roman Catholic]], but, largely because of the region's [[Culture of Germany|German]] heritage, a significant [[Protestant]] community also exists: today, the [[Protestant Church of Augsburg Confession of Alsace and Lorraine|EPCAAL]] (a Lutheran church) is France's second largest Protestant church, also forming an administrative union ([[Union of Protestant Churches of Alsace and Lorraine|UEPAL]]) with the much smaller Calvinist [[Protestant Reformed Church of Alsace and Lorraine|EPRAL]]. Unlike the rest of France, the [[Local law in Alsace-Moselle]] still provides for the [[Napoleon]]ic [[Concordat of 1801]] and the [[organic articles]], which provides public subsidies to the Roman Catholic, [[Lutheran]], and [[Calvinist]] churches, as well as to Jewish synagogues; religion classes in one of these faiths is compulsory in public schools. This divergence in policy from the French majority is due to the region having been part of [[Imperial Germany]] when the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State|1905 law separating the French church and state was instituted]] (for a more comprehensive history, see: [[Alsace-Lorraine]]). Controversy erupts periodically on the appropriateness of this legal disposition, as well as on the exclusion of other religions from this arrangement.

Following the [[Protestant Reformation]], promoted by local reformer [[Martin Bucer]], the principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'' led to a certain amount of religious diversity in the highlands of northern Alsace. Landowners, who as &quot;local lords&quot; had the right to decide which religion was allowed on their land, were eager to entice populations from the more attractive lowlands to settle and develop their property. Many accepted without discrimination Catholics, Lutherans, Calvinists, Jews and [[Anabaptist]]s. [[wikt:multiconfessional|Multiconfessional]] villages appeared, particularly in the region of [[Alsace bossue]]. Alsace became one of the French regions boasting a thriving Jewish community, and the only region with a noticeable Anabaptist population. [[Philipp Jakob Spener]] who founded [[Pietism]] was born in Alsace. The schism of the [[Amish]] under the lead of [[Jacob Amman]] from the [[Mennonite]]s occurred in 1693 in [[Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines]]. The strongly Catholic [[Louis XIV]] tried in vain to drive them from Alsace. When [[Napoleon]] imposed military conscription without religious exception, most emigrated to the American continent.

In 1707, the [[wikt:simultaneum|simultaneum]] forced many Reformed and Lutheran church buildings to also allow Catholic services. About 50 such &quot;simultaneous churches&quot; still exist in modern Alsace, though with the Catholic church's general lack of priests they tend to hold Catholic services only occasionally.

==Culture==
Alsace historically was part of the Holy Roman Empire and the German realm of culture. Since the 17th century, the region has passed between German and French control numerous times, resulting in a cultural blend. German traits remain in the more traditional, rural parts of the culture, such as the [[cuisine]] and architecture, whereas modern institutions are totally dominated by French culture.

====Strasbourg====

[[Strasbourg]]'s arms are the colours of the shield of the [[Bishop of Strasbourg]] (a band of red on a white field, also considered an inversion of the arms of the diocese) at the end of a revolt of the burghers during the Middle Ages who took their independence from the teachings of the Bishop. It retains its power over the surrounding area.

====Flags====

There is controversy around the recognition of the Alsatian flag. The authentic historical flag is the ''Rot-un-Wiss'' ; Red and White are commonly found on the coat of arms of Alsatian cities (Strasbourg, Mulhouse, Sélestat...)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unserland.org/dossiers/breve-histoire-dun-drapeau-alsacien/|title=Unser LandBrève histoire d'un drapeau alsacien - Unser Land|work=Unser Land}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of many Swiss cities, especially in [[Basel-Landschaft|Basel's region]]. The German region [[Hesse]] uses a flag similar to the Rot-un-Wiss. As it underlines the Germanic roots of the region, it was ''replaced'' in 1949 by a new &quot;Union jack-like&quot; flag representing the union of the two départements. It has, however, no real historical relevance. It has been since replaced again by a slightly different one, also representing the two départements. With the purpose of &quot;Francizing&quot; the region, the Rot-un-Wiss has not been recognized by Paris. Some overzealous statesmen have called it a Nazi invention - while its origins date back to the 11th century and the Red and White banner&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genealogie-bisval.net/Images/Lorraine.gif Genealogie-bisval.net]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Gérard, Duke of Lorraine|Gérard de Lorraine]] (aka. d'Alsace). The Rot-un-Wiss flag is still known as the real historical emblem of the region by most of the population and the départements' parliaments and has been widely used during protests against the creation of a new &quot;super-region&quot; gathering [[Champagne-Ardennes]], [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] and Alsace, namely on Colmar's statue of liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/alsace/2014/11/16/colmar-une-statu-de-la-liberte-en-rot-und-wiss-593102.html|title=Colmar : une statue de la Liberté en &quot;Rot und Wiss&quot; - France 3 Alsace|work=France 3 Alsace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===

Although German dialects were spoken in Alsace for most of its history, the dominant language in Alsace today is French.

The traditional language of the ''région'' is [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]], an [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] dialect of [[Upper German]] spoken on both sides of the Rhine and closely related to [[Swiss German]]. Some [[Frankish language|Frankish]] dialects of [[West Central German]] are also spoken in &quot;Alsace Bossue&quot; and in the extreme north of Alsace. Neither Alsatian nor the Frankish dialects have any form of official status, [[Language policy in France|as is customary]] for [[regional language]]s in France, although both are now recognized as [[languages of France]] and can be chosen as subjects in [[lycées]].

Although Alsace has been part of France multiple times in the past, the region had no direct connection with the French state for several centuries. From the end of the Roman Empire (5th century) to the French annexation (17th century), Alsace was politically part of the German world.

The towns of Alsace were the first to adopt the German language as their official language, instead of [[Latin]], during the [[Protestant Reformation|Lutheran Reform]]. It was in Strasbourg that German was first used for the liturgy. It was also in Strasbourg that the first German Bible was published in 1466.

From the annexation of Alsace by France in the 17th century and the language policy of the French Revolution up to 1870, knowledge of French in Alsace increased considerably. With the education reforms of the 19th century, the middle classes began to speak and write French well. The French language never really managed, however, to win over the masses, the vast majority of whom continued to speak their German dialects and write in German (which we would now call &quot;standard German&quot;).{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=March 2014}}

Between 1870 and 1918, Alsace was annexed by the German Empire in the form of an imperial province or Reichsland, and the mandatory official language, especially in schools, became High German. French lost ground to such an extent that it has been estimated that only 2% of the population spoke French fluently and only 8% had some knowledge of it (Maugue, 1970).

After 1918, French was the only language used in schools, and particularly primary schools. After much argument and discussion and after many temporary measures, a memorandum was issued by Vice-Chancellor Pfister in 1927 and governed education in primary schools until 1939.

The second three-day competition to be held at Olympic level each year was the [[Burghley Horse Trials]], first held in 1961. Burghley is the longest running international event.

The first CCI held outside of Britain on an annual basis is the [[Rolex Kentucky Three Day]], held each year in Lexington since 1978.

===Importance of dressage training===
In the early years, the dressage phase was fairly inconsequential in determining the final standings. It was quite possible for a horse to have a terrible dressage test, then run a clean cross-country and show jumping, and still finish near the top of the standings. Since then, correct dressage training has become increasingly important should a horse and rider wish to be placed (complete all sections and finish in the top 12). This can be traced back to [[Sheila Willcox]], who took a particular interest in dressage, becoming abundantly clear when she won Badminton three years running in the 1950s. She had a strong influence on [[Mary King (equestrian)|Mary King]] and [[Lucinda Green]] amongst others.

After the 2000 Olympic Games, the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]] hired British eventer and dressage rider [[Christopher Bartle]] to write new dressage tests for the upper-level events, which would include a greater deal of collection. This has since raised the standard even further in the dressage phase.

Additionally, the cross-country phase has become more technical, asking the horse to be adjustable and supple through [[Combination (jump)|combinations]]. A horse can no longer just be brave and athletic but must have a good deal of dressage training should his rider wish to successfully negotiate odd distances or bending lines at a gallop.  Also, in show jumping, a horse is asked to move with impulsion and engagement; this makes the jump more fluent, brings the horse to [[Bascule_(horse)]] more correctly, and is less jarring for both horse and rider.

===Safety===
Between 1997 and December 2008, at least 37 eventing riders died as a result of injuries incurred while competing in the cross-country phase of eventing at national or international level or at Pony Club. Of these, 18 riders died in the period 2006–2008. These 37 fatal falls have been at all levels of the sport, from domestic one-day events up to regional championships level, and they have occurred in most of the recognized eventing countries around the world, with concentrations in the United Kingdom (14) and the United States (8). At least 25 of these 37 deaths have resulted from a somersaulting (rotational) fall of the horse, with 11 of the 16 deaths in 2007 and 2008 being reported as having resulted from [[rotational falls]].&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=Horsetalk081219&gt;Horsetalk – [http://www.horsetalk.co.nz/saferide/131-eventingincrisis.shtml Eventing in crisis?] 19 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Information about horse fatalities is difficult to locate, but at least 19 eventing horses, many of them top-level performers, died in 2007 and 2008, most of them in the US.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=Horsetalk081219 /&gt;

Over time, course design has become increasingly more focused on the safety of the horse and rider. Fences are built more solidly than in the earlier days, encouraging a bold jump from the horse, which actually helps prevent falls. The layout of the course and the build of the obstacles encourage the horse to have a successful run. This includes greater use of precision fences, such as [[corner (fence)|corner]]s and &quot;skinny jumps&quot;, that are very good tests of the rider's ability and the horse's training but allow the horse to simply run around the jump if the rider misjudges it. Safety measures such as filling in the area between corner-shaped jumps on cross-country or rails of a fence help prevent the entrapment of the legs of the horse decrease the number of serious falls or injuries.

The newest improvement in cross-country safety is the ''frangible'' fence, which uses a pin and other techniques which allow the fence to &quot;break or fall&quot; in a controlled manner to minimize the risk of injury to horse and rider. This can help to prevent the most dangerous situation on cross-country, when the horse hits a solid fence between the forearm and chest, and somersaults over ([[Rotational falls|rotational fall]]), sometimes falling on the rider. This type of fall has caused the deaths of several riders and horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eventingsafety.wordpress.com/|title=Eventing Safety and Risk Management|author=|date=|website=Eventing Safety and Risk Management|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leg protection for horses has also improved. Very little was used in the early days, even on cross-country. Leg protection is now seen on nearly every horse at all levels. Boots have increased technologically, and include materials that either help absorb shock or are very hard and strong to prevent a serious injury.

Rules protecting riders have improved as well. Riders are now required to wear a safety vest (body protector) during cross-country, as well as an [[ASTM]]/[[Safety Equipment Institute|SEI]] or [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] approved [[equestrian helmet]] equipped with a retention harness,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equisearch.com/horses_riding_training/tack_apparel/english/safety100703/ Barakat, Christine. &quot;Riding Helmet Safety Standards Explained&quot; ''Equisearch''.

Eventing was one of the first sports to require the use of a helmet with harness when jumping. As of 2010, more riders were wearing [[air bag vest]]s, which automatically inflate if a rider falls off the horse.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Katie.

===Weight rule===
From the beginning, event horses had to carry a minimum weight of {{convert|165|lb|abbr=on}} (including rider and saddle) during the endurance test, since military horses were expected to be able to carry such weight. Lead weights were carried on the saddle, and the competitor had to be weighed-in with tack immediately following cross-country. The weight was reduced to {{convert|154|lb|abbr=on}} for the 1996 Olympic Games, after a study demonstrated that both the horse's arc over a fence became shallower and the leading leg took a great deal of extra force on landing when the horse was carrying dead weight than when free from the burden. The rule was eventually abolished January 1, 1998. By removing this rule, the stress on the joints and soft-tissue, as well as the chance of a fall, were decreased.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Jennifer O.

==International competition==
{{noref section|date=May 2019}}
[[Image:Burghley 2004.jpg|thumb|right|Burghley is one of the most prestigious international events.]]
International events have specific categories and levels of competition and are conducted under the rules of the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]]. [[Concours Complet International|CCI]] (Concours Complet International, or International Complete Contest) is one such category and defines a three-day event that is open to competitors from any foreign nation as well as the host nation.

*[[Concours Complet International|CCI]] : International Three-day event (Concours Complet International)
*CIC: International One-day event (Concours International Combiné)
*CCIO: International Team Competitions (Concours Complet International Officiel). Includes the Olympics, the [[Eventing World Championship|World Championships]], the Pan Am Games, and other continental championships

The levels of international events are identified by the number of stars next to the category; there are four levels in total. A CCI* is for horses that are just being introduced to international competition. A CCI** is geared for horses that have some experience of international competition. CCI*** is the advanced level of competition.

The very highest level of competition is the CCI****, and with only six such competitions in the world ([[Badminton Horse Trials|Badminton]], [[Burghley Horse Trials|Burghley]], [[Kentucky Three-Day Event|Kentucky]], [[Australian International Three Day Event|Adelaide]], [[Luhmuhlen Horse Trials]], and the [[Étoiles de Pau|Stars of Pau]]) it is the ultimate aim of many riders. The [[Eventing World Championship|World Championships]] are also considered CCI****. Rolex offer a financial prize for any rider who can win three of the biggest competitions in succession. These are Badminton, Burghley and Kentucky. So far, Pippa Funnell (Great Britain) and Michael Jung (Germany) are the only riders to do this. Andrew Hoy did come close, however, and in 2010 [[Oliver Townend]] was competing for this coveted &quot;Grand Slam&quot; at Rolex Kentucky when he suffered a fall at obstacle #20 which eliminated him from competition.

One, two and three-star competitions are roughly comparable to the Novice, Intermediate and Advanced levels of British domestic competition, respectively, and to the Preliminary, Intermediate, and Advanced levels of American domestic competition, respectively.

==National competition==
Eventing rules and the recognized levels in various nations are similar, but not always identical.  While rules usually follow the FEI to some degree, history and tradition of various nations has also influenced competition rules within a given country.

In addition to recognized events that prepare the best riders for international competition, many nations also offer eventing for beginner, youth, and amateur riders through organizations such as [[Pony Club]], [[4-H]] or other riding clubs, where most riders begin their competitive careers.  At the most elementary levels, fence heights begin at around 18&amp;nbsp;inches to {{convert|2|ft|m|abbr=on}}.

===Australia===

* Advanced: max. fence height 1.20 m XC; 1.30 m SJ

===United States===
In the United States, eventing is broken down into the following levels, all of which are recognized by the United States Eventing Association ([[USEA]]) and are run in accordance to their rules:

* Beginner Novice: X-C fences: {{convert|2|ft|7|in|m|abbr=on}}, 14–18 efforts XC, ditch {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=on}}, drops {{convert|3|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on}}, 300–350 m/min (meters per minute) on cross-country; Stadium fences: {{convert|2|ft|7|in|m|abbr=on}}, 9–11 efforts.
* Novice: X-C fences {{convert|2|ft|11|in|m|abbr=on}}, 16–20 efforts, ditch {{convert|6|ft|7|in|m|abbr=on}}, drops {{convert|3|ft|11|in|m|abbr=on}}, 350 to 400 m/min; Stadium fences {{convert|2|ft|11|in|m|abbr=on}}, 9–11 efforts.
* Training: X-C fences {{convert|3|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on}}, 20–24 efforts, ditch {{convert|7|ft|11|in|m|abbr=on}}, drops {{convert|4|ft|7|in|m|abbr=on}}, 420 to 470 m/min; Stadium fences {{convert|3|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on}}, 10–12 efforts.
* Modified: X-C fences 3&amp;nbsp;ft 5 in (1.04 m), 22-28 efforts, ditch 8&amp;nbsp;ft 6 in (2.59 m), drops 4&amp;nbsp;ft 11 in (1.50 m), 490 m/min; Stadium fences 3&amp;nbsp;ft 5 in (1.04 m), 10-13 efforts.
* Preliminary: X-C fences {{convert|3|ft|7|in|abbr=on|m}}, 22–30 efforts, ditch {{convert|9|ft|2|in|abbr=on|m}}, drops {{convert|5|ft|3|in|abbr=on|m}}, 520 m/min; Stadium fences {{convert|3|ft|7|in|abbr=on|m}}, 11–13 efforts.
* Intermediate: X-C fences {{convert|3|ft|9|in|m|abbr=on}}, 26–34 efforts, ditch {{convert|10|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}, drops {{convert|5|ft|11|in|m|abbr=on}}, 550 m/min; Stadium fences {{convert|3|ft|11|in|m|abbr=on}}, 12–14 efforts.
* Advanced: X-C fences {{convert|3|ft|11|in|m|abbr=on}}, 32–40 efforts, ditch {{convert|11|ft|10|in|m|abbr=on}}, drops {{convert|6|ft|7|in|m|abbr=on}}, 570 m/min; Stadium fences {{convert|4|ft|1|in|m|abbr=on}}, 13–15 efforts.

It is also common to see inter-levels (such as the Intermediate/Preliminary, or IP), which help riders transition between levels by using the dressage and show jumping tests of the higher level and the cross-country course of the lower, and starter levels, which use the dressage test and stadium course standards of the lower CT levels (e.g., Amoeba, Tadpole, Green as Grass) with a very simple cross-country course. However, the starter levels are considered &quot;test&quot; levels and thus do not have a consistent standard (or a national points system and leaderboard).

==Horse==
In the lower levels, it is possible for any [[list of horse breeds|breed of horse]], if it has the talent for it, to do well in eventing.  [[Thoroughbred]]s and part-Thoroughbreds currently dominate the sport at the top levels because of their stamina and athletic ability, although many [[warmblood]]s and warmblood-thoroughbred crosses also do well. In the UK, [[Irish Horse|Irish sport horses]] have been popular for many years.

Because larger horses are favored, animals with some [[draft horse]] breeding are also seen, notably the [[Irish Draught]] and [[Clydesdale horse|Clydesdale]] crossbreds.  However, smaller horses can also excel; for example, the third place competitor in the 2007 [[Rolex Kentucky Three Day]] CCI competition was [[Theodore O'Connor]], a {{hands|14.1}} gelding that was a cross of Thoroughbred, [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] and [[Shetland pony]] breeding.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Karen O'Connor and 'The Pony' Theodore O'Connor Wow The Crowd, Finishing Third&quot;  Accessed June 21, 2007 at http://www.horsesdaily.com/news/eventing/2007/07rolex/04-29-oconnor.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827152504/http://horsesdaily.com/news/eventing/2007/07rolex/04-29-oconnor.html |date=2016-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An event horse must be very responsive to succeed, as a horse that will not listen to a rider on the cross-country phase may end up taking a fall at a jump. The horse should be calm and submissive for the dressage phase, with good training on the flat. For cross-country, the horse must be brave, athletic, and (especially at the higher levels) fast with a good galloping stride and great stamina. The horse does not have to possess perfect jumping form, but should be safe over fences and have good scope. Scope is a broad term used to describe a horse's potential to jump big jumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Worden |first1=Dr. Tim |title=Q&amp;A: How can you tell if a horse has scope? |url=https://horsenetwork.com/2020/02/qa-how-can-you-tell-if-a-horse-has-scope/#:~:text=It%20is%20a%20general%20term,is%20well%20trained%20and%20rideable. |website=horsenetwork.com |accessdate=17 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best event horses are careful over jumps, as those who are not tend to have stadium rails knocked down on the last day. The horse also needs to have sound [[horse conformation|conformation]] and good [[horse hoof|feet]].

==Riding attire==
Riding attire is different in each of the three phases.  Dressage and stadium jumping feature the traditional turnout for each of those disciplines, requiring conservative attire. However, as of 2017 lower level divisions in the United States allow for more flexibility in the rider's attire. Cross-country attire and equipment emphasizes and requires safety protocols be followed, but has less formal appearance, with many riders wearing clothing of personalized, often bright colors. Under FEI rules, civilian riders may opt to wear the uniform of their riding club, and members of the military and national studs are required to wear service dress in the dressage and stadium jumping phases.&lt;ref name=&quot;FEI 2013 Eventing Rules&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=FEI Eventing Rules 24th Edition|year=2013|publisher=International Equestrian Federation|location=Lausanne, Switzerland|page=54|url=http://fei.org/sites/default/files/2013_Eventing_Rules_Final_March_changes_integrated.pdf|access-date=2013-09-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215507/http://fei.org/sites/default/files/2013_Eventing_Rules_Final_March_changes_integrated.pdf|archive-date=2013-10-04|url-status=dead|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dressage===
For the intermediate and advanced levels, riders usually wear dressage attire similar to that of [[Grand Prix Dressage]], including a [[top hat]] and white [[riding breeches]]. However, even at the most senior levels (e.g., the World Equestrian Games, the Olympics, and CCI****) the actual FEI dress requirements are less strict, requiring only &quot;hunting dress&quot;; a white shirt and a tie of any kind; gloves of any colour; white, fawn, or cream breeches; and [[riding boots]] of any colour.&lt;ref name=&quot;FEI 2013 Eventing Rules&quot; /&gt; The wearing of [[shadbelly]] or other tailcoat jackets is not compulsory in the dressage phase.&lt;ref name=&quot;FEI 2013 Eventing Rules&quot; /&gt;

Rules at non-FEI competition vary.  In the  USA, formal attire is not required if all phases run in one day or for the lower levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;2013 USEF Eventing Rules&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.usef.org/forms-pubs/KlV5P9prkmM/ev-eventing-division|title=USEF Rules for Eventing|last=|first=|publisher=United States Equestrian Federation|year=2013|isbn=|location=Lexington, KY, United States|page=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though navy and black coats are the preferred traditional style, riders may wear any conservatively colored dark  or tweed hunting coat with a white shirt and choker or, preferably, a stock tie with pin.  If a rider wishes to stay within traditional requirements for higher-level competition, breeches should be white, fawn, or cream.  A black or navy hunt cap or [[derby]] hat may be worn, although many riders use an [[equestrian helmet]], which are considered safer.&lt;ref name=&quot;2013 USEF Eventing Rules&quot;/&gt;  Helmets are compulsory at lower levels.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Boots may be field or dress style, black or brown in color.&lt;ref name=&quot;2013 USEF Eventing Rules&quot;/&gt;  Gloves and spurs give a polished appearance but are not required at lower levels. Dressage gloves are traditionally white, although other colors are permitted. [[Spur]]s, when worn, are restricted to certain lengths and types. [[Riding boots]] such as field or dress tall boots are usually black.

===Cross-country===
[[Image:R3DE XCountry.JPG|right|thumb|Attire in the cross-country phase is the least formal, and many riders choose &quot;eventing colours&quot;, to which they match some of their horse's tack.]] The rider is required to wear a body protector vest, an approved [[equestrian helmet]] which must be properly fastened at all times when jumping, and a medical armband, containing the rider's medical history, allowing access to the information should the rider fall, be knocked unconscious, and require medical treatment.

FEI rules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Eventing Rules |date=3 December 2018 |publisher=Fédération Equestre Internationale |location=Switzerland |page=56 |edition=25th}}&lt;/ref&gt; allow riders to dress as they please in the cross-country phase. Light-weight rugby or polo shirts are the most commonly worn shirt style, usually without a stock or tie.  Riding coats are generally not worn. Many riders wear a stop-watch to track their time so that they may adjust their speed to come in as close as possible to the optimum time.

===Stadium jumping===
Eventing riders tend to follow the dress practices of showjumpers in the stadium jumping phase.  However,  FEI rules only require &quot;hunting dress&quot;; white shirt and tie of any kind; white, fawn, or cream breeches; and boots of any kind.&lt;ref name=&quot;FEI 2013 Eventing Rules&quot; /&gt;
 
In most nations' nationally sanctioned competitions, and often even at lower levels, a protective [[equestrian helmet]] with harness is required, and a short hunt coat is traditional, except when weather is unreasonably warm, when, at the discretion of the technical delegate, jackets may be considered optional.  If helmet covers are used, they are required to be black or dark blue though some now include national colors where they are entitled to be worn.

==Turnout of the horse and tack==

===Turnout and grooming===
Event horses are turned out similarly to dressage horses, with the legs and face (muzzle, jaw, sides of ears, [[bridle path (horse)|bridle path]]) neatly clipped. The tail is usually &quot;banged&quot; (cut straight across), usually to a length between the fetlock joint and lower hock. Additionally, most event riders clip the sides of their mount's tails, to give them a finer appearance. The braiding of tails is fairly uncommon, probably because the tail can not be braided if the hairs along the sides of the dock are clipped.

The [[mane (horse)|mane]] is pulled to about 3 inches in length and is usually braided for dressage as well as the show jumping phase. However, most riders prefer to leave it loose for cross-country in case they need to grab it for security. Some riders also place [[quarter marks]] (decorative stenciling) on the hindquarters.

===Tack===
[[Image:Rolex XCountry.JPG|right|thumb|A horse on cross-country, showing the &quot;eventer's grease&quot; on his legs to help him slide over obstacles.]]
Most event riders have a jumping saddle as well as a dressage saddle since each places them in a position better-suited for its purpose. At the lower levels, however, a rider can ride all three phases without difficulty in a well-fitted jumping saddle. At the upper levels, riders usually have a saddle specifically designed for cross-country, giving them more freedom for such fences as [[bank (obstacle)|banks and drops]].

Dressage tack is usually black in color, with a [[saddle blanket|white square pad]], giving a formal look. Except for the upper levels, where a [[double bridle]] is permitted, horses may only be ridden in [[snaffle bit]]s. There are strict guidelines as to what type of snaffle may be used, and the more severe types (such as any twisted bit) are prohibited. If a double bridle is used, a plain cavesson or crank [[noseband]] must be worn. With a snaffle bridle, the rider is also free to use the drop, flash, or grackle noseband, with the flash and plain cavesson being the most common. [[Breastplate (tack)|Breastplates]] are also fairly common in dressage at an event, despite the fact that they are not seen at regular dressage shows. Other forms of equipment, such as [[Martingale (tack)|martingale]]s, protective boots, gadgets/training devices, bit guards, [[polo wraps]], or tail wraps, are not allowed during the test.

[[Image:R3DE StadiumJump.jpg|right|thumb|Horse and rider well turned-out for the stadium jumping phase. Note the rider wears a medical armband.]]
In show jumping, the rider uses a jumping saddle, usually with a square or fitted white pad. Rules on tack are less-stringent, and most forms of bridling and bitting are allowed, including the use of [[gag bit]]s, [[hackamore]]s, and any type of noseband. Breastplates and open front boots are usually worn. [[Martingale (tack)|Running martingales]] are also allowed, but must be used with rein stops. Standing and Irish martingales are not allowed.

For the cross-country phase, the rider usually uses similar tack as for the show jumping. However, cross-country boots are used for extra protection, to help prevent injury if they were to hit the solid obstacles. Most horses that wear shoes are also fitted with [[horse shoe studs]], to prevent slipping. At the upper levels, riders may also apply a grease or lard to the front of the horse's legs, to help the horse slide over fences if they hang a leg. Riders also tend to color-coordinate their cross-country tack to their colors. For example, using the same color saddle pad and tape for their boots, to match their shirt and protective vest.

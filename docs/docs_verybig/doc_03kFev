By the Middle Ages, the figure of the Siren had transformed into the enduring [[mermaid]] figure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mittman Dendle 2016 p. 352&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Mittman |first=Asa Simon |last2=Dendle |first2=Peter J |title=The Ashgate research companion to monsters and the monstrous |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=2016 |isbn=9781351894326  |oclc=1021205658 |page=352 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, Sirens were shown to be male or female, but the male Siren disappeared from art around the fifth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.colorado.edu/classics/exhibits/GreekVases/essays/200637tsirens.htm|title=CU Classics – Greek Vase Exhibit – Essays – Sirens|website=www.colorado.edu|access-date=2017-10-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625173807/http://www.colorado.edu/Classics/exhibits/GreekVases/essays/200637tsirens.htm|archive-date=2016-06-25|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first-century Roman historian [[Pliny the Elder]] discounted Sirens as a pure fable, &quot;although Dinon, the father of Clearchus, a celebrated writer, asserts that they exist in [[India]], and that they charm men by their song, and, having first lulled them to sleep, tear them to pieces.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' X, 70.&lt;/ref&gt; In his notebooks, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] wrote, &quot;The siren sings so sweetly that she lulls the mariners to sleep; then she climbs upon the ships and kills the sleeping mariners.&quot;

In [[Euripides]]'s play, ''[[Helen (play)|Helen]]'' (167), Helen in her anguish calls upon &quot;Winged maidens, daughters of the Earth ([[Chthonic|Chthon]]).&quot; Although they lured mariners, the Greeks portrayed the Sirens in their &quot;meadow starred with flowers&quot; and not as sea deities. Roman writers linked them more closely to the sea, as daughters of Phorcys.&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], V.846.&lt;/ref&gt; Sirens are found in many Greek stories, notably in Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]''.

==Mythology==
=== Demeter ===
[[File:Ulysses And The Sirens by Léon Belly.jpg|thumb|upright|''Odysseus and the Sirens'', painting by [[Léon Belly]], 1867]]

According to [[Ovid]] (43 BC–17 AD), the Sirens were the companions of young [[Persephone]].&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' V, 551.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Demeter]] gave them wings to search for Persephone when she was abducted by [[Hades]]. However, the ''Fabulae'' of [[Hyginus]] (64 BC–17 AD) has Demeter cursing the Sirens for failing to intervene in the abduction of Persephone. According to [[Hyginus]], Sirens were fated to live only until the mortals who heard their songs were able to pass by them.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 141 (trans. Grant).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Muses ===
It is said that [[Hera]], queen of the gods, persuaded the Sirens to enter a singing contest with the [[Muses]]. The Muses won the competition and then plucked out all of the Sirens' feathers and made crowns out of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lempriere&quot;&gt;Lemprière 768.&lt;/ref&gt; Out of their anguish from losing the competition, writes [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], the Sirens turned white and fell into the sea at [[Aptera, Greece|Aptera]] (&quot;featherless&quot;), where they formed the islands in the bay that were called ''Leukai'' (&quot;the white ones&quot;, modern [[Souda (island)|Souda]]).&lt;ref&gt;Caroline M. Galt, &quot;A marble fragment at Mount Holyoke College from the Cretan city of Aptera&quot;, ''Art and Archaeology'' '''6''' (1920:150).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Argonautica ===
In the ''[[Argonautica]]'' (third century BC), [[Jason]] had been warned by [[Chiron]] that [[Orpheus]] would be necessary in his journey.&lt;ref&gt;Apollonius Rhodius, ''Argonautica'' IV, 891–919.&lt;/ref&gt; When Orpheus heard their voices, he drew out his [[lyre]] and played his music more beautifully than they, drowning out their voices. One of the crew, however, the sharp-eared hero [[Butes]], heard the song and leapt into the sea, but he was caught up and carried safely away by the goddess [[Aphrodite]].

=== Odyssey ===
[[File:WATERHOUSE - Ulises y las Sirenas (National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, 1891. Óleo sobre lienzo, 100.6 x 202 cm).jpg|thumb|left|''[[Ulysses and the Sirens (Waterhouse)|Ulysses and the Sirens]]'', an 1891 painting by [[John William Waterhouse]]]]

[[Odysseus]] was curious as to what the Sirens sang to him, and so, on the advice of [[Circe]], he had all of his sailors plug their ears with [[beeswax]] and tie him to the mast. He ordered his men to leave him tied tightly to the mast, no matter how much he might beg. When he heard their beautiful song, he ordered the sailors to untie him but they bound him tighter. When they had passed out of earshot, Odysseus demonstrated with his frowns to be released.&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'' XII, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Some post-Homeric authors state that the Sirens were fated to die if someone heard their singing and escaped them, and that after Odysseus passed by they therefore flung themselves into the water and perished.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 141; [[Lycophron]], ''Alexandra'' 712 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sirens and death==
[[File:Siren enchants sailors - Bestiary (1230-1240), f.47v - BL Harley MS 4751.jpg|thumb|upright|Miniature illustration of a Siren enticing sailors who try to resist her, from an English ''[[Bestiary]]'', c.&amp;nbsp;1235]]
[[File:Mosaïque d'Ulysse et les sirènes.jpg|thumb|Odysseus and the Sirens, Roman mosaic, second century AD ([[Bardo National Museum]])|left]]

Statues of Sirens in a funerary context are attested since the classical era, in mainland [[Greece]], as well as [[Asia Minor]] and [[Magna Graecia]]. The so-called &quot;Siren of Canosa&quot;—[[Canosa di Puglia]] is a site in [[Apulia]] that was part of [[Magna Graecia]]—was said to accompany the dead among [[grave goods]] in a burial. She appeared to have some [[psychopomp]] characteristics, guiding the dead on the afterlife journey. The cast [[terracotta]] figure bears traces of its original white pigment. The woman bears the feet, wings and tail of a bird. The sculpture is conserved in the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]], in Madrid.

The Sirens were called the Muses of the lower world. Classical scholar [[Walter Copland Perry]] (1814–1911) observed: &quot;Their song, though irresistibly sweet, was no less sad than sweet, and lapped both body and soul in a fatal lethargy, the forerunner of death and corruption.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, &quot;The sirens in ancient literature and art&quot;, in ''The Nineteenth Century'', reprinted in ''Choice Literature: a monthly magazine'' (New York) '''2''' (September–December 1883:163).&lt;/ref&gt; Their song is continually calling on Persephone.

The term &quot;[[wikt:siren song|siren song]]&quot; refers to an appeal that is hard to resist but that, if heeded, will lead to a bad conclusion. Later writers have implied that the Sirens were [[Cannibalism|cannibals]], based on [[Circe]]'s description of them &quot;lolling there in their meadow, round them heaps of corpses rotting away, rags of skin shriveling on their bones.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'' 12.45–6, Fagles' translation.&lt;/ref&gt; As linguist [[Jane Ellen Harrison]] (1850–1928) notes of &quot;[[Keres (mythology)|The Ker]] as siren&quot;: &quot;It is strange and beautiful that Homer should make the Sirens appeal to the spirit, not to the flesh.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Harrison 198&lt;/ref&gt; The siren song is a promise to Odysseus of mantic truths; with a false promise that he will live to tell them, they sing,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Once he hears to his heart's content, sails on, a wiser man.&lt;br /&gt;We know all the pains that the Greeks and Trojans once endured&lt;br /&gt;on the spreading plain of Troy when the gods willed it so—&lt;br /&gt;all that comes to pass on the fertile earth, we know it all!&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'' 12.188–91, Fagles' translation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&quot;They are mantic creatures like the [[Sphinx]] with whom they have much in common, knowing both the past and the future&quot;, Harrison observed. &quot;Their song takes effect at midday, in a windless calm. The end of that song is [[death]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, 199.&lt;/ref&gt; That the sailors' flesh is rotting away, suggests it has not been eaten. It has been suggested that, with their feathers stolen, their divine nature kept them alive, but unable to provide food for their visitors, who starved to death by refusing to leave.&lt;ref&gt;Liner notes to ''[[Fresh Aire VI]]'' by Jim Shey, Classics Department, University of Wisconsin&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian belief and modern reception==
[[File:The Siren.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[The Siren (Waterhouse painting)|The Siren]]'', by [[John William Waterhouse]], c.&amp;nbsp;1900, depicted as a fish-chimera]]

By the fourth century, when [[paganism|pagan]] beliefs were overtaken by [[Christianity]], the belief in literal sirens was discouraged. Although [[Saint Jerome]], who produced the Latin [[Vulgate]] version of the bible, used the word ''sirens'' to translate Hebrew ''tannīm'' (&quot;jackals&quot;) in Isaiah 13:22, and also to translate a word for &quot;owls&quot; in Jeremiah 50:39, this was explained by [[Ambrose]] to be a mere symbol or allegory for worldly temptations, and not an endorsement of the Greek myth.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, ''Exposition of the Christian Faith'', Book 3, chap. 1, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Armitage Siren.JPG|thumb|''The Siren'', [[Edward Armitage]], 1888]]

The early Christian [[euhemerist]] interpretation of mythologized human beings received a long-lasting boost from [[Isidore of Seville|Isidore's]] ''[[Etymologiae]]'':

{{quote|They [the Greeks] imagine that &quot;there were three Sirens, part virgins, part birds,&quot; with wings and claws. &quot;One of them sang, another played the flute, the third the lyre. They drew sailors, decoyed by song, to shipwreck. According to the truth, however, they were prostitutes who led travelers down to poverty and were said to impose shipwreck on them.&quot; They had wings and claws because Love flies and wounds. They are said to have stayed in the waves because a wave created [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Robert McQueen (1999). ''Early Christians and Animals.'' London: Routledge, 120. Translation of Isidore, ''Etymologiae'' (c. 600–636 AD), Book 11, chap. 3 (&quot;Portents&quot;), 30.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By the time of the [[Renaissance]], female court musicians known as [[courtesan]]s filled the role of an unmarried companion, and musical performances by unmarried women could be seen as immoral. Seen as a creature who could control a man's reason, female singers became associated with the mythological figure of the siren, who usually took a half-human, half-animal form somewhere on the cusp between nature and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dunbar |first1=Julie C. |title=Women, Music, Culture |date=2011 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1351857451 |page=70 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fq5rDQAAQBAJ |accessdate=9 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sirens continued to be used as a symbol for the dangerous temptation embodied by women regularly throughout Christian art of the medieval era; however, in the 17th century, some [[Jesuit]] writers began to assert their actual existence, including [[Cornelius a Lapide]], who said of woman, &quot;her glance is that of the fabled [[basilisk]], her voice a siren's voice—with her voice she enchants, with her beauty she deprives of reason—voice and sight alike deal destruction and death.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Longworth, T. Clifton, and Paul Tice (2003). ''A Survey of Sex &amp; Celibracy in Religion.'' San Diego: The Book Tree, 61. Originally published as ''The Devil a Monk Would Be: A Survey of Sex &amp; Celibacy in Religion'' (1945).&lt;/ref&gt; [[:es:Antonio de Lorea|Antonio de Lorea]] also argued for their existence, and [[Athanasius Kircher]] argued that compartments must have been built for them aboard [[Noah's Ark]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, Patricia Ann (ed.) (1986). ''Literature and Lore of the Sea.'' Amsterdam: Editions Rodopi, 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Draper Herbert James Ulysses and the Sirens.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Ulysses and the Sirens (Draper)|Ulysses and the Sirens]]'', by [[Herbert James Draper]], c.&amp;nbsp;1909]]

[[Charles Burney]] expounded c. 1789, in ''A General History of Music'': &quot;The name, according to [[Samuel Bochart|Bochart]], who derives it from the Phoenician, implies a ''songstress.'' Hence it is probable, that in ancient times there may have been excellent singers, but of corrupt morals, on the coast of Sicily, who by seducing voyagers, gave rise to this fable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Austern, Linda Phyllis, and Inna Naroditskaya (eds.) (2006). ''Music of the Sirens.'' Bloomington, IN: University of Indiana Press, 72.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Lemprière]] in his ''Classical Dictionary'' (1827) wrote, &quot;Some suppose that the Sirens were a number of lascivious women in Sicily, who prostituted themselves to strangers, and made them forget their pursuits while drowned in unlawful pleasures. The etymology of [[Samuel Bochart|Bochart]], who deduces the name from a [[Phoenician language|Phoenician term]] denoting a ''songstress,''&lt;!--italics in original--&gt; favors the explanation given of the fable by [[Christian Tobias Damm|Damm]].&lt;ref&gt;Damm, perhaps ''Mythologie der Griechen und Römer'' (ed. Leveiow). Berlin, 1820.&lt;/ref&gt; This distinguished critic makes the Sirens to have been excellent singers, and divesting the fables respecting them of all their terrific features, he supposes that by the charms of music and song they detained travellers,&lt;!--travellers in the original--&gt; and made them altogether forgetful of their native land.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lemprière 768. Brackets in the original.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other cultures==
The theme of perilous mythical female creatures seeking to seduce men with their beautiful singing is paralleled in the Danish medieval ballad known as &quot;[[Elvehøj]]&quot;, in which the singers are [[Elf|elves]]. The ballad is also conserved in a Swedish version. A modern literary appropriation of the myth is to be seen in [[Clemens Brentano]]'s ''Lore Lay'' ballad, published in his novel ''Godwi oder Das steinerne Bild der Mutter'' (1801).{{fact|date=July 2020}}

In the folklore of some modern cultures, the concept of the siren has been assimilated to that of the [[mermaid]]. For example, the [[French language|French]] word for mermaid is ''sirène'', and similarly in certain other European languages.{{fact|date=July 2020}}

==Honours==
[[Siren Lake]] in [[Antarctica]] is named after the mythological creature.

A '''civil defense siren''' (also known as an '''air-raid siren''' or '''tornado siren''') is a siren used to provide an [[emergency population warning]] to the general population of approaching danger. It is sometimes sounded again to indicate the danger has passed. Some sirens (especially within small towns) are also used to call the volunteer fire department when needed. Initially designed to warn city dwellers of [[airstrike|air raids]] in World War&amp;nbsp;II, they were later used to warn of nuclear attack and natural destructive weather patterns such as [[tornado]]es. The generalized nature of sirens led to many of them being replaced with more specific warnings, such as the broadcast-based [[Emergency Alert System]] and the [[Cell Broadcast]]-based [[Wireless Emergency Alerts]] and [[EU-Alert]] mobile technologies.

A [[Siren (alarm)#Pneumatic|mechanical siren]] generates sound by spinning a slotted chopper wheel to interrupt a stream of air at a regular rate. Modern sirens can develop a sound level of up to 135 [[decibel]]s at {{convert|100|ft|m|0}}. The [[Chrysler air raid siren]], driven by a {{convert|331|cuin|L|1|adj=on|abbr=off|sp=us}} [[Chrysler Hemi]] gasoline engine, generates 138&amp;nbsp;dB at {{convert|100|ft|m|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.airraidsirens.com/database.html | title=Air Raid Sirens – Siren Museum | access-date=7 July 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070719174724/http://www.airraidsirens.com/database.html | archive-date=19 July 2007 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By use of varying tones or binary patterns of sound, different alert conditions can be signaled. Electronic sirens can transmit voice announcements in addition to alert tone signals. Siren systems may be electronically controlled and integrated into other warning systems.

==Sirens in integrated public warning systems==
[[File:Ballston Spa, NY Federal Signal Model 5.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Federal Signal Model 5 in [[Ballston Spa, New York]], U.S.]]

Sirens are sometimes integrated into a warning system that links sirens with other warning media, such as the radio and TV [[Emergency Alert System]], [[NOAA Weather Radio]], telephone alerting systems, [[Reverse 911]], Cable Override, and wireless alerting systems in the United States and the National Public Alerting System, [[Alert Ready]], in Canada. This fluid approach enhances the credibility of warnings and reduces the risk of assumed false alarms by corroborating warning messages through multiple forms of media. The [[Common Alerting Protocol]] is a technical standard for this sort of multi-system integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Common Alerting Protocol {{!}} FEMA.gov|url=https://www.fema.gov/common-alerting-protocol|website=www.fema.gov|access-date=2020-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Siren installations have many ways of being activated. Commonly used methods are [[dual-tone multi-frequency signaling]] (DTMF) or [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) using telephone lines, but activation can also be done via radio broadcast. This method opens up vulnerability for exploitation, but there are protections from false alarms. These sirens can also be tied into other networks such as a fire department's volunteer notification/paging system. The basics of this type of installation would consist of a device (possibly the same pager the firefighters have) connected to the controller/timer system of the siren. When a page is received, the siren is activated.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

===Mechanical sirens===
[[File:ACA Allertor 125 video.ogv|thumb|left|250px|An ACA Allertor 125 in Alert and Attack modes (video)]] [[File:3T22 Sandy, Oregon.jpg|thumb|left|250px|An older and damaged 3T22 in Sandy, Oregon]]

A mechanical siren uses a [[turbine|rotor]] and [[stator]] to chop an air stream, which is forced through the siren by radial [[wikt:vane|vane]]s in the spinning rotor. An example of this type of siren is the Federal Signal 2T22, which was originally developed during the Cold War and produced from the early 1950s to the late 1980s. This particular design employs dual rotors and stators to sound each pitch. Because the sound power output of this type of siren is the same in every direction at all times, it is described as omnidirectional. The Federal 2T22 was also marketed in a 3-signal configuration known as the [[Federal Signal 3T22]], with the capability for a &quot;hi-lo&quot; signal. Some sirens, like the Federal Signal Thunderbolt series, had a blower so that more air could be pumped into the siren.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

While some mechanical sirens produce sound in all directions simultaneously, other designs produce sound in only one direction, while employing a rotator mechanism to turn the siren head through 360 degrees of rotation. One rare type of mechanical siren, the Federal Signal RSH-10 (&quot;Thunderbeam&quot;), does not rotate or produce equal sound output in all directions. It instead uses a slowly rotating angled disc below the siren which directs the siren's output throughout 360 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;https://wiki.thesirenboard.com/RSH-10&lt;/ref&gt; The chopper of this siren is taken from another one of Federal Signal's sirens, the STH-10.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

In the 1770s, [[Utagawa Toyoharu]] produced a number of ''uki-e'' perspective prints{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=68}} that demonstrated a mastery of Western perspective techniques that had eluded his predecessors in the genre.{{sfn|King|2010|p=47}}  Toyoharu's works helped pioneer the landscape as an ukiyo-e subject, rather than merely a background for human figures.{{sfnm|1a1=Stewart|1y=1922|1p=224|2a1=Neuer|2a2=Libertson|2a3=Yoshida|2y=1990|2p=259}}  In the 19th century, Western-style perspective techniques were absorbed into Japanese artistic culture, and deployed in the refined landscapes of such artists as Hokusai and [[Hiroshige]],{{sfn|Thompson|1986|p=44}} the latter a member of the [[Utagawa school]] that Toyoharu founded.  This school was to become one of the most influential,{{sfn|Salter|2006|p=204}} and produced works in a far greater variety of genres than any other school.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=105}}

===Peak period (late 18th century)===

[[File:Kitagawa Utamaro - Two Beauties with Bamboo - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|alt=A colour print of a close-up of the head and upper torso of a finely dressed Japanese woman.  Behind her is a bamboo screen on which is depicted a similar woman's head and upper torso.|''Two Beauties with Bamboo''&lt;br/&gt;[[Utamaro]], {{circa|1795}}]]

While the late 18th century saw hard economic times,{{sfn|Neuer|Libertson|Yoshida|1990|p=145}} ukiyo-e saw a peak in quantity and quality of works, particularly during the [[Kansei]] era (1789–1791).{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=91}}  The ukiyo-e of the period of the [[Kansei Reforms]] brought about a focus on beauty and harmony{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=85}} that collapsed into decadence and disharmony in the next century as the reforms broke down and tensions rose, culminating in the [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1868.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=91}}

Especially in the 1780s, [[Torii Kiyonaga]] (1752–1815){{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=85}} of the Torii school{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=91}} depicted traditional ukiyo-e subjects like beauties and urban scenes, which he printed on large sheets of paper, often as multiprint horizontal [[diptych]]s or [[triptych]]s.  His works dispensed with the poetic dreamscapes made by Harunobu, opting instead for realistic depictions of idealized female forms dressed in the latest fashions and posed in scenic locations.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=85–86}}  He also produced portraits of kabuki actors in a realistic style that included accompanying musicians and chorus.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=87}}

A law went into effect in 1790 requiring prints to bear a censor's seal of approval to be sold.  Censorship increased in strictness over the following decades, and violators could receive harsh punishments.  From 1799 even preliminary drafts required approval.{{sfn|Michener|1954|p=231}}  A group of Utagawa-school offenders including [[Utagawa Toyokuni|Toyokuni]] had their works repressed in 1801, and [[Utamaro]] was imprisoned in 1804 for making prints of 16th-century political and military leader&lt;!-- the source calls him &quot;Shogun&quot;, but Hideyoshi was never appointed shogun --&gt; [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]].{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=224}}

Utamaro ({{circa|1753}}–1806) made his name in the 1790s with his ''bijin ōkubi-e'' (&quot;large-headed pictures of beautiful women&quot;) portraits, focusing on the head and upper torso, a style others had previously employed in portraits of kabuki actors.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=87–88}}  Utamaro experimented with line, colour, and printing techniques to bring out subtle differences in the features, expressions, and backdrops of subjects from a wide variety of class and background.  Utamaro's individuated beauties were in sharp contrast to the stereotyped, idealized images that had been the norm.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=88}}  By the end of the decade, especially following the death of his patron [[Tsutaya Jūzaburō]] in 1797, Utamaro's prodigious output declined in quality,{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=88–89}} and he died in 1806.{{sfn|Neuer|Libertson|Yoshida|1990|p=40}}

Appearing suddenly in 1794 and disappearing just as suddenly ten months later, the prints of the enigmatic [[Sharaku]] are amongst ukiyo-e's best known. Sharaku produced striking portraits of kabuki actors, introducing a greater level of realism into his prints that emphasized the differences between the actor and the portrayed character.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=91–92}}  The expressive, contorted faces he depicted contrasted sharply with the serene, mask-like faces more common to artists such as Harunobu or Utamaro.{{sfn|Munsterberg|1957|p=155}}  Published by Tsutaya,{{sfn|Neuer|Libertson|Yoshida|1990|p=40}} Sharaku's work found resistance, and in 1795 his output ceased as mysteriously as it had appeared, and his real identity is still unknown.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=89–91}}  Utagawa Toyokuni (1769–1825) produced kabuki portraits in a style Edo townsfolk found more accessible, emphasizing dramatic postures and avoiding Sharaku's realism.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=91–92}}

A consistent high level of quality marks ukiyo-e of the late 18th-century, but the works of Utamaro and Sharaku often overshadow those other masters  of the era.{{sfn|Neuer|Libertson|Yoshida|1990|p=40}}  One of Kiyonaga's followers,{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=91}} [[Eishi]] (1756–1829), abandoned his position as painter for ''shōgun'' [[Tokugawa Ieharu]] to take up ukiyo-e design.  He brought a refined sense to his portraits of graceful, slender courtesans, and left behind a number of noted students.{{sfn|Neuer|Libertson|Yoshida|1990|p=40}}  With a fine line, [[Eishōsai Chōki]] (fl. 1786–1808) designed portraits of delicate courtesans.  The Utagawa school came to dominate ukiyo-e output in the late Edo period.{{sfn|Neuer|Libertson|Yoshida|1990|pp=40–41}}

Edo was the primary centre of ukiyo-e production throughout the Edo period.  Another major centre developed in the [[Kamigata]] region of areas in and around [[Kyoto]] and [[Osaka]].  In contrast to the range of subjects in the Edo prints, those of Kamigata tended to be portraits of kabuki actors.  The style of the Kamigata prints was little distinguished from those of Edo until the late 18th century, partly because artists often moved back and forth between the two areas.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=38}}  Colours tend to be softer and pigments thicker in Kamigata prints than in those of Edo.{{sfn|Salter|2001|pp=12–13}}  In the 19th century many of the prints were designed by kabuki fans and other amateurs.{{sfn|Winegrad|2007|pp=18–19}}

===Late flowering: flora, fauna, and landscapes (19th century)===

[[File:The Great Wave off Kanagawa.jpg|thumb|alt=A colour illustration of a violent wave|[[Hokusai]]'s ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'', 1831]]

The [[Tenpō Reforms]] of 1841–1843 sought to suppress outward displays of luxury, including the depiction of courtesans and actors. As a result, many ukiyo-e artists designed travel scenes and pictures of nature, especially birds and flowers.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=132}}  Landscapes had been given limited attention since Moronobu, and they formed an important element in the works of Kiyonaga and [[Katsukawa Shunchō|Shunchō]].  It was not until late in the Edo period that landscape came into its own as a genre, especially via the works of [[Hokusai]] and [[Hiroshige]].  The landscape genre has come to dominate Western perceptions of ukiyo-e, though ukiyo-e had a long history preceding these late-era masters.{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=175}}  The Japanese landscape differed from the Western tradition in that it relied more heavily on imagination, composition, and atmosphere than on strict observance of nature.{{sfn|Michener|1959|pp=176–177}}

The self-proclaimed &quot;mad painter&quot; Hokusai (1760–1849) enjoyed a long, varied career.  His work is marked by a lack of the sentimentality common to ukiyo-e, and a focus on formalism influenced by Western art.  Among his accomplishments are his illustrations of [[Takizawa Bakin]]'s novel ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Crescent Moon (novel)|ja|3=椿説弓張月|lt=Crescent Moon}}'', his series of sketchbooks, the ''[[Hokusai Manga]]'', and his popularization of the landscape genre with ''[[Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji]]'',{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=92–93}} which includes his best-known print, ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'',{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1a2=Lewis|1y=2008|1p=385|2a1=Honour|2a2=Fleming|2y=2005|2p=709|3a1=Benfey|3y=2007|3p=17|4a1=Addiss|4a2=Groemer|4a3=Rimer|4y=2006|4p=146|5a1=Buser|5y=2006|5p=168}} one of the most famous works of Japanese art.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1a2=Lewis|1y=2008|1p=385|2a1=Belloli|2y=1999|2p=98}}  In contrast to the work of the older masters, Hokusai's colours were bold, flat, and abstract, and his subject was not the pleasure districts but the lives and environment of the common people at work.{{sfn|Munsterberg|1957|p=158}}  Established masters [[Keisai Eisen|Eisen]], [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi|Kuniyoshi]], and [[Kunisada]] also followed Hokusai's steps into landscape prints in the 1830s, producing prints with bold compositions and striking effects.{{sfn|King|2010|pp=84–85}}

Though not often given the attention of their better-known forebears, the Utagawa school produced a few masters in this declining period.  The prolific Kunisada (1786–1865) had few rivals in the tradition of making portrait prints of courtesans and actors.{{sfn|Lane|1962|pp=284–285}}  One of those rivals was Eisen (1790–1848), who was also adept at landscapes.{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=290}}  Perhaps the last significant member of this late period, Kuniyoshi (1797–1861) tried his hand at a variety of themes and styles, much as Hokusai had.  His historical scenes of warriors in violent combat were popular,{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=285}} especially his series of heroes from the ''[[Water Margin|Suikoden]]'' (1827–1830) and ''[[Chūshingura]]'' (1847).{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=153–154}} He was adept at landscapes and satirical scenes—the latter an area rarely explored in the dictatorial atmosphere of the Edo period; that Kuniyoshia could dare tackle such subjects was a sign of the weakening of the shogunate at the time.{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=285}}

Hiroshige (1797–1858) is considered Hokusai's greatest rival in stature.  He specialized in pictures of birds and flowers, and serene landscapes, and is best known for his travel series, such as ''[[The Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō]]'' and ''[[The Sixty-nine Stations of the Kiso Kaidō]]'',{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=94–95}} the latter a cooperative effort with Eisen.{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=290}}  His work was more realistic, subtly coloured, and atmospheric than Hokusai's; nature and the seasons were key elements: mist, rain, snow, and moonlight were prominent parts of his compositions.{{sfn|Munsterberg|1957|pp=158–159}}  Hiroshige's followers, including [[Japanese adult adoption|adopted]] son [[Hiroshige II]] and son-in-law [[Hiroshige III]], carried on their master's style of landscapes into the Meiji era.{{sfn|King|2010|p=116}}

===Decline (late 19th century)===

Following the deaths of Hokusai and Hiroshige{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=200}} and the Meiji Restoration of 1868, ukiyo-e suffered a sharp decline in quantity and quality.{{sfnm|1a1=Michener|1y=1959|1p=200|2a1=Kobayashi|2y=1997|2p=95}}  The rapid Westernization of the [[Meiji period]] that followed saw woodblock printing turn its services to journalism, and face competition from photography.  Practitioners of pure ukiyo-e became more rare, and tastes turned away from a genre seen as a remnant of an obsolescent era.{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=200}}  Artists continued to produce occasional notable works, but by the 1890s the tradition was moribund.{{sfnm|1a1=Kobayashi|1y=1997|1p=95|2a1=Faulkner|2a2=Robinson|2y=1999|2pp=22–23|3a1=Kobayashi|3y=1997|3p=95|4a1=Michener|4y=1959|4p=200}}

Synthetic pigments imported from Germany began to replace traditional organic ones in the mid-19th century.  Many prints from this era made extensive use of a bright red, and were called ''[[aka-e]]'' (&quot;red pictures&quot;).{{sfn|Seton|2010|p=71}}  Artists such as [[Yoshitoshi]] (1839–1892) led a trend in the 1860s of gruesome scenes of murders and ghosts,{{sfn|Seton|2010|p=69}} monsters and supernatural beings, and legendary Japanese and Chinese heroes.  His ''One Hundred Aspects of the Moon'' (1885–1892) depicts a variety of fantastic and mundane themes with a moon motif.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=153}}  [[Kobayashi Kiyochika|Kiyochika]] (1847–1915) is known for his prints documenting the rapid modernization of Tokyo, such as the introduction of railways, and his depictions of Japan's wars [[First Sino-Japanese War|with China]] and [[Russo-Japanese War|with Russia]].{{sfn|Seton|2010|p=69}} Earlier a painter of the Kanō school, in the 1870s [[Toyohara Chikanobu|Chikanobu]] (1838–1912) turned to prints, particularly of the [[Imperial House of Japan|imperial family]] and scenes of Western influence on Japanese life in the Meiji period.{{sfn|Meech-Pekarik|1986|pp=125–126}}

===Introduction to the West===

Aside from Dutch traders, who had had [[Japan–Netherlands relations|trading relations]] dating to the beginning of the Edo period,{{sfn|Watanabe|1984|p=667}} Westerners paid little notice to Japanese art before the mid-19th century, and when they did they rarely distinguished it from other art from the East.{{sfn|Watanabe|1984|p=667}}  Swedish naturalist [[Carl Peter Thunberg]] spent a year in the Dutch trading settlement [[Dejima]], near Nagasaki, and was one of the earliest Westerners to collect Japanese prints.  The export of ukiyo-e thereafter slowly grew, and at the beginning of the 19th century Dutch merchant-trader [[Isaac Titsingh]]'s collection drew the attention of connoisseurs of art in Paris.{{sfn|Neuer|Libertson|Yoshida|1990|p=48}}

[[File:Japanese Satsuma pavillion at the French expo 1867.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Black-and-white photo of a traditional-style Japanese building|The Japanese Satsuma pavilion at the [[International Exposition (1867)|International Exhibition of 1867 in Paris]] ]]

The arrival in Edo of American Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Perry]] in 1853 led to the [[Convention of Kanagawa]] in 1854, which opened Japan to the outside world after [[Sakoku|over two centuries of seclusion]].  Ukiyo-e prints were amongst the items he brought back to the United States.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=163}}  Such prints had appeared in Paris from at least the 1830s, and by the 1850s were numerous;{{sfn|Meech-Pekarik|1982|p=93}} reception was mixed, and even when praised ukiyo-e was generally thought inferior to Western works which emphasized mastery of naturalistic perspective and anatomy.{{sfn|Watanabe|1984|pp=680–681}}  Japanese art drew notice at the [[International Exposition (1867)|International Exhibition of 1867 in Paris]],{{sfn|Watanabe|1984|p=667}} and became fashionable in France and England in the 1870s and 1880s.{{sfn|Watanabe|1984|p=667}}  The prints of Hokusai and Hiroshige played a prominent role in shaping Western perceptions of Japanese art.{{sfn|Watanabe|1984|p=675}}  At the time of their introduction to the West, woodblock printing was the most common mass medium in Japan, and the Japanese considered it of little lasting value.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=12}}

Early Europeans promoters and scholars of ukiyo-e and Japanese art included writer [[Edmond de Goncourt]] and art critic [[Philippe Burty]],{{sfn|Weisberg|Rakusin|Rakusin|1986|p=7}} who coined the term &quot;[[Japonism]]&quot;.{{sfn|Weisberg|1975|p=120}}{{efn|Burty coined the term ''{{lang|fr|le Japonisme}}'' in French in 1872.{{sfn|Weisberg|1975|p=120}} }}  Stores selling Japanese goods opened, including those of Édouard Desoye in 1862 and art dealer [[Siegfried Bing]] in 1875.{{sfn|Jobling|Crowley|1996|p=89}}  From 1888 to 1891 Bing published the magazine ''[[Artistic Japan]]''{{sfn|Meech-Pekarik|1982|p=96}} in English, French, and German editions,{{sfn|Weisberg|Rakusin|Rakusin|1986|p=6}} and curated an ukiyo-e exhibition at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in 1890 attended by artists such as [[Mary Cassatt]].{{sfn|Jobling|Crowley|1996|p=90}}

[[File:Debussy - La Mer - The great wave of Kanaga from Hokusai.jpg|thumb|alt=Cover of book of sheet music depicting a stylized wave|Not only the visual arts but also music drew inspiration from ukiyo-e in the West: cover of the orchestral score of [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]'s ''[[La mer (Debussy)|La mer]]'' (1905).]]

American [[Ernest Fenollosa]] was the earliest Western devotee of Japanese culture, and did much to promote Japanese art—Hokusai's works featured prominently at his inaugural exhibition as first curator of Japanese art [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] in Boston, and in Tokyo in 1898 he curated the first ukiyo-e exhibition in Japan.{{sfn|Meech-Pekarik|1982|pp=101–103}} By the end of the 19th century, the popularity of ukiyo-e in the West drove prices beyond the means of most collectors—some, such as [[Edgar Degas|Degas]], traded their own paintings for such prints.  [[Tadamasa Hayashi]] was a prominent Paris-based dealer of respected tastes whose Tokyo office was responsible for evaluating and exporting large quantities of ukiyo-e prints to the West in such quantities that Japanese critics later accused him of siphoning Japan of its national treasure.{{sfn|Meech-Pekarik|1982|pp=96–97}}  The drain first went unnoticed in Japan, as Japanese artists were immersing themselves in the classical painting techniques of the West.{{sfn|Merritt|1990|p=15}}

Japanese art, and particularly ukiyo-e prints, came to influence Western art from the time of the early [[Impressionism|Impressionist]]s.{{sfn|Mansfield|2009|p=134}}  Early painter-collectors incorporated Japanese themes and compositional techniques into their works as early as the 1860s:{{sfn|Meech-Pekarik|1982|p=93}} the patterned wallpapers and rugs in [[Édouard Manet|Manet]]'s paintings were inspired by ukiyo-e's patterned kimonos, and [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] focused his attention on ephemeral elements of nature as in ukiyo-e landscapes.{{sfn|Ives|1974|p=17}}  [[Vincent van Gogh|Van&amp;nbsp;Gogh]] was an avid collector, and painted [[Copies by Vincent van Gogh|copies in oil]] of prints by Hiroshige and [[Keisai Eisen|Eisen]].{{sfn|Sullivan|1989|p=230}}  Degas and Cassatt depicted fleeting, everyday moments in Japanese-influenced compositions and perspectives.{{sfn|Ives|1974|p=37–39, 45}}  Ukiyo-e's flat perspective and unmodulated colours were a particular influence on graphic designers and poster makers.{{sfn|Jobling|Crowley|1996|pp=90–91}}  [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]]'s lithographs displayed his interest not only in ukiyo-e's flat colours and outlined forms, but also in their subject matter: performers and prostitutes.{{sfn|Ives|1974|p=80}}  He signed much of this work with his initials in a circle, imitating the seals on Japanese prints.{{sfn|Ives|1974|p=80}}  Other artists of the time who drew influence from ukiyo-e include [[Claude Monet|Monet]],{{sfn|Mansfield|2009|p=134}} [[John La Farge|La Farge]],{{sfn|Meech-Pekarik|1982|p=99}} [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]],{{sfn|Ives|1974|p=96}} and [[Les Nabis]] members such as [[Pierre Bonnard|Bonnard]]{{sfn|Ives|1974|p=56}} and [[Édouard Vuillard|Vuillard]].{{sfn|Ives|1974|p=67}}  French composer [[Claude Debussy]] drew inspiration for his music from the prints of Hokusai and Hiroshige, most prominently in ''[[La mer (Debussy)|La mer]]'' (1905).{{sfn|Gerstle|Milner|1995|p=70}}  [[Imagism|Imagist]] poets such as [[Amy Lowell]] and [[Ezra Pound]] found inspiration in ukiyo-e prints; Lowell published a book of poetry called ''Pictures of the Floating World'' (1919) on oriental themes or in an oriental style.{{sfn|Hughes|1960|p=213}}

The travel sketchbook became a popular genre beginning about 1905, as the Meiji government promoted travel within Japan to have citizens better know their country.{{sfn|King|2010|pp=119, 121}}  In 1915, publisher [[Shōzaburō Watanabe]] introduced the term ''[[shin-hanga]]'' (&quot;new prints&quot;) to describe a style of prints he published that featured traditional Japanese subject matter and were aimed at foreign and upscale Japanese audiences.{{sfn|Seton|2010|p=81}}  Prominent artists included [[Goyō Hashiguchi]], called the &quot;Utamaro of the [[Taishō period]]&quot; for his manner of depicting women; [[Shinsui Itō]], who brought more modern sensibilities to images of women;{{sfnm|1a1=Brown|1y=2006|1p=22|2a1=Seton|2y=2010|2p=81}} and [[Hasui Kawase]], who made modern landscapes.{{sfnm|1a1=Brown|1y=2006|1p=23|2a1=Seton|2y=2010|2p=81}}  Watanabe also published works by non-Japanese artists, an early success of which was a set of Indian- and Japanese-themed prints in 1916 by the English [[Charles W. Bartlett]] (1860–1940). Other publishers followed Watanabe's success, and some shin-hanga artists such as Goyō and [[Hiroshi Yoshida]] set up studios to publish their own work.{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=21}}

Artists of the ''[[sōsaku-hanga]]'' (&quot;creative prints&quot;) movement took control of every aspect of the printmaking process—design, carving, and printing were by the same pair of hands.{{sfn|Seton|2010|p=81}}  [[Kanae Yamamoto (artist)|Kanae Yamamoto]] (1882–1946), then a student at the [[Tokyo University of the Arts|Tokyo School of Fine Arts]], is credited with the birth of this approach. In 1904, he produced ''Fisherman'' using woodblock printing, a technique until then frowned upon by the Japanese art establishment as old-fashioned and for its association with commercial mass production.{{sfn|Merritt|1990|p=109}}  The foundation of the [[Japanese Woodcut Artists' Association]] in 1918 marks the beginning of this approach as a movement.{{sfn|Munsterberg|1957|p=181}}  The movement favoured individuality in its artists, and as such has no dominant themes or styles.{{sfn|Statler|1959|p=39}}  Works ranged from the entirely abstract ones of [[Kōshirō Onchi]] (1891–1955) to the traditional figurative depictions of Japanese scenes of [[Un'ichi Hiratsuka]] (1895–1997).{{sfn|Munsterberg|1957|p=181}}  These artists produced prints not because they hoped to reach a mass audience, but as a creative end in itself, and did not restrict their print media to the woodblock of traditional ukiyo-e.{{sfn|Statler|1959|pp=35–38}}

&lt;!-- let's avoid using &quot;kindai hanga&quot; -- the term isn't set in stone the way &quot;shin-hanga&quot; and &quot;sōsaku-hanga&quot; are --&gt;Prints from the late-20th and 21st centuries have evolved from the concerns of earlier movements, especially the sōsaku-hanga movement's emphasis on individual expression.  [[Screen printing]], [[etching]], [[mezzotint]], [[mixed media]], and other Western methods have joined traditional woodcutting amongst printmakers' techniques.{{sfn|Fiorillo|1999}}

==Chambers==
[[File:Vista panorámica del Hemiciclo de sesiones del Congreso del Peru.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Congress of the Republic of Peru]], the country's national legislature, meets in the [[Legislative Palace (Peru)|Legislative Palace]] in 2010]]

A legislature may [[debate]] and [[vote]] upon [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]]s as a single unit, or it may be composed of multiple separate [[Deliberative assembly|assemblies]], called by various names including [[Chambers of parliament|''legislative chambers'']], [[Debate chamber|''debate chambers'']], and ''houses'', which debate and vote separately and have distinct powers. A legislature which operates as a single unit is [[Unicameralism|unicameral]], one divided into two chambers is [[Bicameralism|bicameral]], and one divided into three chambers is [[Tricameralism|tricameral]].
[[File:House of Commons Chamber 1.png|thumb|left|The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], its lower house]]
In bicameral legislatures, one chamber is usually considered the [[upper house]], while the other is considered the [[lower house]]. The two types are not rigidly different, but members of upper houses tend to be indirectly elected or appointed rather than directly elected, tend to be allocated by [[administrative division]]s rather than by population, and tend to have longer terms than members of the lower house. In some systems, particularly [[parliamentary system]]s, the upper house has less power and tends to have a more advisory role, but in others, particularly [[Federation|federal]] [[presidential system]]s, the upper house has equal or even greater power. 
[[File:Deutscher Bundestag Plenarsaal Seitenansicht.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Germany|German]] [[Bundestag]], its theoretical lower house]]

In [[federation]]s, the upper house typically represents the federation's component states. This is also the case with the supranational legislature of the [[European Union]]. The upper house may either contain the delegates of state governments{{spaced ndash}}as in the European Union and in [[Germany]] and, [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|before 1913, in the United States]]{{spaced ndash}}or be elected according to a formula that grants equal representation to states with smaller populations, as is the case in [[Australia]] and the United States since 1913.
[[File:Senate panorama.jpg|right|upright=1.8|thumb|The [[Australian Senate]], its upper house]]
[[Tricameral]] legislatures are rare; the [[Massachusetts Governor's Council]] still exists, but the most recent national example existed in the waning years of White-minority rule in [[South Africa]]. [[Tetracameralism|Tetracameral]] legislatures no longer exist, but they were previously used in Scandinavia.

==Size==
Legislatures vary widely in their size. Among [[List of legislatures by number of members|national legislatures]], [[China]]'s [[National People's Congress]] is the largest with 2,980 members,&lt;ref name=&quot;IPU&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=IPU PARLINE database: &quot;General information&quot; module |url=http://archive.ipu.org/parline-e/mod-general.asp |website=IPU Parline Database |publisher=International Parliamentary Union |access-date=30 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Vatican City]]'s [[Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State|Pontifical Commission]] is the smallest with 7.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vatican size&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Vatican City State |url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/content/vaticanstate/en/stato-e-governo/struttura-del-governatorato/organigramma/stato-citta-del-vaticano.html |publisher=Vatican City State |access-date=30 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither legislature is democratically elected: The Pontifical Commission members are appointed by the Pope and the [[National People's Congress]] is [[Indirect election|indirectly elected]] within the context of a [[one-party state]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IPU&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vatican&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author1=Pope John Paul II |author-link1=Pope John Paul II |title=Fundamental Law of Vatican City State |url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2522/FundamentalLaw1.pdf |publisher=Vatican City State |access-date=30 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226203911/http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2522/FundamentalLaw1.pdf |archive-date=26 February 2008 |date=26 November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legislature size is a trade off between efficiency and representation; the smaller the legislature, the more efficiently it can operate, but the larger the legislature, the better it can represent the political diversity of its constituents. Comparative analysis of national legislatures has found that size of a country's [[lower house]] tends to be proportional to the [[cube root]] of its [[population]]; that is, the size of the lower house tends to increase along with population, but much more slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frederick|first=Brian|date=December 2009|title=Not Quite a Full House: The Case for Enlarging the House of Representatives|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1257&amp;context=br_rev|journal=Bridgewater Review|access-date=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adjara''' ({{lang-ka|აჭარა}} ''Ač’ara'' {{IPA-ka|at͡ʃʼara||Adjara.ogg}}) or '''Adjaria''', officially known as the '''Autonomous Republic of Adjara''' ({{lang-ka|აჭარის ავტონომიური რესპუბლიკა}} ''Ač’aris Avt’onomiuri Resp’ublik’a'' {{IPA-ka|at͡ʃʼaris avtʼɔnɔmiuri rɛspʼublikʼa||Autonomous Republic of Adjara (KA).ogg}}), is a historical, geographic and political-administrative region of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Located in the country's southwestern corner, Adjara lies on the coast of the [[Black Sea]] near the foot of the [[Caucasus Mountains|Lesser Caucasus Mountains]], north of [[Turkey]]. It is an important tourist destination and includes Georgia's second-largest city of [[Batumi]] as its capital. About 350,000 people live on its 2,880 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. 

Adjara is home to the [[Adjarians]], a regional subgroup of [[Georgians]]. Adjara's name can be spelled in a number of ways, including ''Ajara'', ''Ajaria'', ''Adjaria'', ''Adzharia'', ''Atchara'' and ''Achara''. Under the [[Soviet Union]], Adjara was part of the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]] as the [[Adjar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Adjarian ASSR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/russian/const/36cons01.html|title=1936 Constitution of the USSR, Part I|work=bucknell.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}
{{main|History of Adjara}}

Adjara has been part of [[Colchis]] and [[Kingdom of Iberia (antiquity)|Caucasian Iberia]] since ancient times. Colonized by [[Greeks]] in the 5th century BC, the region fell under Rome in the 2nd century BC. It became part of the [[Lazica]] before being incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Abkhazia]] in the 8th century AD, the latter led [[Kingdom of Georgia#Unification of the Georgian State|unification of Georgian monarchy]] in the 11th century. 

The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] conquered the area in 1614. The people of Adjara gradually converted to Islam in this period. The Ottomans were forced to cede Adjara to the expanding [[Russian Empire]] in 1878.

After a temporary occupation by [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] troops in 1918&amp;ndash;1920, Adjara became part of the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] in 1920. After a brief military conflict in March 1921,  [[Ankara]]'s government ceded the territory to Georgia under Article VI of [[Treaty of Kars]] on the condition that autonomy be provided for the [[Muslim]] population. The Soviet Union established the [[Adjar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] in 1921 in accord with this clause (until 1937 the name was Ajaristan). Thus, Adjara was still a component part of Georgia, but with considerable local autonomy.{{fact|date=September 2014}}

===Independent Georgia===
After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Adjara became part of a newly independent but politically divided Republic of Georgia. It avoided being dragged into the chaos and [[Georgian Civil War|civil war]] that afflicted the rest of the country between 1991 and 1993 due largely to the authoritarian rule of its leader [[Aslan Abashidze]]. Although he successfully maintained order in Adjara and made it one of the country's most prosperous regions, he was accused of involvement in organised crime&amp;mdash;notably large-scale smuggling to fund his government and enrich himself. The central government in Tbilisi had very little say in what went on in Adjara during the presidency of [[Eduard Shevardnadze]].

This changed following the [[Rose Revolution]] of 2003 when Shevardnadze was deposed in favour of the reformist opposition leader [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], who pledged to crack down on separatism within Georgia. In the spring of 2004, a major [[2004 Adjara crisis|crisis in Adjara]] erupted as the central government sought to reimpose its authority on the region. It threatened to develop into an armed confrontation.{{fact|date=September 2014}} However, Saakashvili's ultimata and mass protests against Abashidze's autocratic rule forced the Adjaran leader to resign in May 2004, following which he went into exile in Russia. After Abashidze's ousting, a new law was introduced to redefine the terms of Adjara's autonomy.{{fact|date=September 2014}} [[Levan Varshalomidze]] succeeded Abashidze as the chairman of the government.{{fact|date=September 2014}}

In July 2007, the seat of the [[Constitutional Court of Georgia|Georgian Constitutional Court]] was moved from Tbilisi to Batumi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constcourt.ge/index.php?lang_id=ENG&amp;sec_id=13 |title=Constitutional Court of Georgia - Brief History |work=constcourt.ge |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721030206/http://www.constcourt.ge/index.php?lang_id=ENG&amp;sec_id=13 |archivedate=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007 Russia ended its two century military presence in Georgia by withdrawing from the [[12th Military Base]] (the former 145th Motor Rifle Division) in [[Batumi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia closes last military base in Georgia|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/11/13/us-georgia-russia-bases-idUSL1387605220071113|agency=Reuters|date=13 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since mid-2000s Turkey has expanded its influence over Adjara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Belyaev|first1=Andrey|title=Friendly Relations between Georgia and Turkey shall be put to the test in Kirnati|url=http://journal-neo.org/2014/06/10/rus-bratskie-otnosheniya-gruzii-i-turtsii-ispy-ty-vayutsya-kirnati/|website=New Eastern Outlook|publisher=10 June 2014|quote=This same period saw a strong influx of Turkish investments, direct entry of Turkish business into the region, and as a consequence, increased Turkish influence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Georgian political analyst [[George Khutsishvili]] Turkey's influence in Adjara is felt stronger than elsewhere in Georgia. {{cite news|last=Otidze|first=Irina|title=Аджария: между сепаратизмом и исламом|url=http://lenta.ru/articles/2013/07/10/adjaria/|work=[[Lenta.ru]]|date=10 July 2013|language=ru|quote=«Турецкое влияние в Аджарии чувствуется сильнее, чем где бы то ни было в Грузии», — говорит эксперт Георгий Хуцишвили.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish influence can be seen in the region's economy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rukhadze|first1=Vasili|title=Defying Georgia, Turkey Gradually Cultivates its Influence in Separatist Abkhazia|journal=Eurasia Daily Monitor|date=1 October 2015|volume=12|issue=177|url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?tx_ttnews%5Bpointer%5D=2&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=44437&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=390&amp;cHash=67e6f32cb6cf137989a9d28d1f34c6ac|publisher=[[The Jamestown Foundation]]|quote=Overall, Turkish businesses flourish across Georgia, with especially heavy concentration in Batumi and the surrounding Adjara region.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the religious life—through the region's Muslim population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Balci|first1=Bayram|title=Strengths and Constraints of Turkish Policy in the South Caucasus|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/2014/06/18/strengths-and-constraints-of-turkish-policy-in-south-caucasus|publisher=[[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]]|date=18 June 2014|quote=Turkish religious influence is notable, not only in Azerbaijan but also in the Muslim regions of Georgia (in the region of Adjara and the border areas of Azerbaijan).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Islam in Georgia |url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/295315/March_14_Islam_in_Georgia_final.doc |format=Word document |website=gov.uk |publisher=[[Government of the United Kingdom]] |quote=Turkey’s influence in the region remains strong, in part through funding provided by Ankara for local mosques}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law and government ==
[[File:Adjara-gov-logo.JPG|thumb|Logo of the Cabinet of Ministers.]]
[[File:Council of Ministers of Adjara.jpg|thumb|Government building in [[Batumi]].]]

The status of the Adjaran Autonomous Republic is defined by Georgia's law on Adjara and the region's new constitution, adopted following the ousting of [[Aslan Abashidze]]. The local legislative body is the [[Parliament of the Autonomous Republic of Adjara|Parliament]]. The head of the region's government&amp;mdash;the Council of Ministers of Adjara&amp;mdash;is nominated by the [[President of Georgia]] who also has powers to dissolve the assembly and government and to overrule local authorities on issues where the constitution of Georgia is contravened. [[Zurab Pataridze]] is the current head of the Adjaran government.

Adjara is subdivided into six administrative units:

|align=&quot;left&quot;| [[Khulo District]]|| 710 || 33,430 || 35,500
|}

== Geography and climate ==

Adjara is located on the south-eastern coast of the Black Sea and extends into the wooded foothills and mountains of the [[Caucasus Mountains|Lesser Caucasus]]. It has borders with the region of [[Guria]] to the north, [[Samtskhe-Javakheti]] to the east and Turkey to the south. Most of Adjara's territory either consists of hills or mountains. The highest mountains rise more than {{convert|3,000|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. Around 60% of Adjara is covered by forests. Many parts of the [[Meskheti Range]] (the west-facing slopes) are covered by [[temperate rain forests]].

Adjara is traversed by the northeasterly line of equal latitude and longitude.

===Climate===
[[File:Ajaria.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lesser Caucasus]] mountains.]]
Adjara is well known for its humid climate (especially along the coastal regions) and prolonged rainy weather, although there is plentiful sunshine during the spring and summer months. Adjara receives the highest amounts of precipitation both in Georgia and in the [[Caucasus]]. It is also one of the wettest temperate regions in the [[northern hemisphere]]. No region along Adjara's coast receives less than {{convert|2200|mm|1|abbr=on}} of precipitation per year. The west-facing ([[windward]]) slopes of the [[Meskheti Range]] receive upwards of {{convert|4500|mm|1|abbr=on}} of precipitation per year. The coastal lowlands receive most of the precipitation in the form of rain (due to the area's subtropical climate). September and October are usually the wettest months. Batumi's average monthly rainfall for the month of September is {{convert|410|mm|2|abbr=on}}. The interior parts of Adjara are considerably drier than the coastal mountains and lowlands. Winter usually brings significant snowfall to the higher regions of Adjara, where snowfall often reaches several meters. Average summer temperatures are between 22&amp;ndash;24 degrees Celsius in the lowland areas and 17&amp;ndash;21 degrees Celsius in the highlands. The highest areas of Adjara have lower temperatures. Average winter temperatures are between 4&amp;ndash;6 degrees Celsius along the coast while the interior areas and mountains average around -3&amp;ndash;2 degrees Celsius. Some of the highest mountains of Adjara have average winter temperatures of -8&amp;ndash;(-7) degrees Celsius.

== Economy ==

Adjara has good land for growing tea, citrus fruits and tobacco. Mountainous and forested, the region has a subtropical climate, and there are many health resorts. Tobacco, tea, citrus fruits, and avocados are leading crops; livestock raising is also important. Industries include tea packing, tobacco processing, fruit and fish canning, oil refining, and shipbuilding.

The regional capital, [[Batumi]], is an important gateway for the shipment of goods heading into Georgia, [[Azerbaijan]] and landlocked [[Armenia]]. The port of Batumi is used for the shipment of oil from [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Turkmenistan]]. Its oil refinery handles [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] oil from [[Azerbaijan]] which arrives by pipeline to [[Supsa]] port and is transported from there to Batumi by rail. The Adjaran capital is a centre for shipbuilding and manufacturing.

Adjara is the main center of Georgia's coastal tourism industry, having displaced the northwestern province of [[Abkhazia]] since that region's ''de facto'' secession from Georgia in 1993.

According to the 2014 census, the population of Adjara is 333,953.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://census.ge/en/results/census|title=census - 2014 General Population Census Results|website=census.ge|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Adjarians]] (Ajars) are an ethnographic group of the [[Georgian people]] who speak a group of local dialects known collectively as [[Adjarian language|Adjarian]]. The written language is [[Georgian alphabet|Georgian]].

The Georgian population of Adjara had been generally known as &quot;Muslim Georgians&quot; until the 1926 Soviet [[census]] which listed them as &quot;Ajars&quot; and counted 71,000 of them. Later, they were simply classified under a broader category of Georgians as no official Soviet census asked about religion. Today, calling them &quot;Muslim Georgians&quot; would be a misnomer in any case as Adjarans are now about 70% Christian (see below).

Ethnic minorities include [[Russians]], [[Armenians]], [[Pontic Greeks]], [[Abkhaz people|Abkhaz]], etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adjarastat&quot;&gt;{{in lang|ka}}[http://adjarastat.com/Docs/EROVNEBA.doc Autonomous Republic of Adjara, Department of Statistics]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===

The collapse of the Soviet Union and the re-establishment of Georgia's independence accelerated the growth of Christianity in the region[[Christianization|,]] especially among the young.&lt;ref&gt;George Sanikidze and Edward W. Walker (2004), ''Islam and Islamic Practices in Georgia.'' Berkeley Program in Soviet and Post-Soviet Studies. [[University of California]], Berkeley Institute of Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are still remaining [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]] communities in Adjara, mainly in the [[Khulo]] district. According to the 2014 Georgian national census, 60% were [[Georgian Orthodox|Orthodox]] Christians, and 39% Muslim.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The remaining were [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Christians]] (0.3%), and others (3%).&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Petra lies around [[Jebel al-Madhbah|Jabal Al-Madbah]] in a [[Depression (geology)|basin]] surrounded by mountains which form the eastern flank of the [[Arabah]] valley that runs from the [[Dead Sea]] to the [[Gulf of Aqaba]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot; /&gt; The area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref name=&quot;PNF&quot;/&gt; and the [[Nabataeans]] might have settled in what would become the capital city of their [[Nabataean Kingdom|kingdom]], as early as the 4th century BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;lost kingdom&quot;/&gt; However, archaeological work has only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence dating back to the second century BC,&lt;ref name=&quot;NGlost&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Petra.

The trading business gained the Nabataeans considerable revenue and Petra became the focus of their wealth. The Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts, unlike their enemies, and were able to repel attacks by taking advantage of the area's mountainous terrain. They were particularly skillful in [[Rainwater harvesting|harvesting rainwater]], [[agriculture]] and [[stone carving]]. Petra flourished in the 1st century AD, when its famous [[Al-Khazneh]] structure ‚Äì believed to be the [[mausoleum]] of Nabataean king [[Aretas IV Philopatris|Aretas IV]] ‚Äì was constructed, and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/archaeology-and-history/magazine/2016/01-02/petra/|title=Petra Lost and Found|work=National Geographic|date=2 January 2016|access-date=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[Nabataean kingdom]] became a client state of the [[Roman Empire]] in the first century BC, it was only in 106 AD that it lost its independence. Petra fell to the Romans, who annexed Nabataea and renamed it as [[Arabia Petraea]]. Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, and after an [[Galilee earthquake of 363|earthquake in 363]] destroyed many structures. In the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine era]] several Christian churches were built, but the city continued to decline, and by the early Islamic era it was abandoned except for a handful of nomads. It remained unknown to the world until it was rediscovered in 1812 by [[Johann Ludwig Burckhardt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/17/arts/art-review-rose-red-city-carved-from-the-rock.html|title=ART REVIEW; Rose-Red City Carved From the Rock|first=Grace|last=Glueck|date=17 October 2003|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to the city is through a {{convert|1.2|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} gorge called the [[Siq]], which leads directly to the Khazneh. Famous for its [[rock-cut architecture]] and water conduit system, Petra is also called the 'Rose City' because of the colour of the stone from which it is carved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jordan Tourism board&quot;&gt;[http://www.visitjordan.com/Default.aspx?Tabid=63 Major Attractions: Petra] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104133425/http://visitjordan.com/Default.aspx?tabid=63 |date=2016-11-04 }}, Jordan tourism board&lt;/ref&gt; It has been a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] since 1985.

Petra is a symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction. Tourist numbers peaked at 918,000 in 2010, but there followed a temporary slump during the political instability generated by the [[Arab Spring]], which affected countries surrounding Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111117043619/http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/01/2011128125157509196.html Thousands protest in Jordan], January 28, 2011.

==Importance in antiquity==
[[File:Karta Petra.PNG|thumb|upright=1.55|Map of Petra]]
[[Pliny the Elder]] and other writers identify Petra as the capital of the [[Nabataean Kingdom]] and the centre of their [[camel train|caravan]] trade. Enclosed by towering rocks and watered by a [[perennial stream]], Petra not only possessed the advantages of a fortress, but controlled the main commercial routes which passed through it to [[Gaza City|Gaza]] in the west, to [[Bosra]] and [[Damascus]] in the north, to [[Aqaba]] and Leuce Come on the [[Red Sea]], and across the desert to the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; 

==Description==

===Water control===
Excavations have demonstrated that it was the ability of the Nabataeans to control the water supply that led to the rise of the desert city, creating an artificial [[oasis]]. The area is visited by [[flash flood]]s, but archaeological evidence shows that the Nabataeans controlled these floods by the use of [[dam]]s, [[cistern]]s and water conduits. These innovations stored water for prolonged periods of [[drought]] and enabled the city to prosper from its sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nabataea.net/waterw.html |title=Petra: Water Works |publisher=Nabataea.net |access-date=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lisa Pinsker |url=http://www.agiweb.org/geotimes/june04/feature_petra.html |title=Geotimes ‚Äì June 2004 ‚Äì Petra: An Eroding Ancient City |publisher=Agiweb.org |date=2001-09-11 |access-date=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Al-Siq 2.jpg|thumb|left|The narrow passage ([[Siq]]) that leads to Petra]]

===Access routes===
In ancient times, Petra might have been approached from the south on a track leading across the plain of Petra, around Jabal Haroun (&quot;Aaron's Mountain&quot;), the location of the [[Tomb of Aaron]], said to be the burial place of [[Aaron]], brother of [[Moses]]. Another approach was possibly from the high plateau to the north. Today, most modern visitors approach the site from the east. The impressive eastern entrance leads steeply down through a dark, narrow gorge, in places only {{convert|3|‚Äì|4|m|0|abbr=on}} wide, called the ''[[Siq]]'' (&quot;shaft&quot;), a natural geological feature formed from a deep split in the [[sandstone]] rocks and serving as a waterway flowing into [[Wadi Musa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fulford97&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.robertfulford.com/petra.html |title= Robert Fulford's column about Petra, Jordan |publisher= Robertfulford.com |date= 1997-06-18 |access-date=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===City centre===
[[File:Petra - 286630893.jpg|thumb|The Theatre]]
At the end of the narrow gorge, the [[Siq]], stands Petra's most elaborate ruin, popularly known as [[Al-Khazneh]] (&quot;the Treasury&quot;), hewn into the sandstone cliff. While remaining in remarkably preserved condition, the face of the structure is marked by hundreds of bullet holes made by the local Bedouin tribes that hoped to dislodge riches that were once rumoured to be hidden within it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fulford97&quot;/&gt; A little further from the Treasury, at the foot of the mountain called ''en-Nejr'', is a massive [[Theater (structure)|theatre]], positioned so as to bring the greatest number of [[tomb]]s within view. At the point where the valley opens out into the plain, the site of the city is revealed with striking effect. The theatre has been cut into the hillside and into several of the tombs during its construction. Rectangular gaps in the seating are still visible. Almost enclosing it on three sides are rose-coloured mountain walls, divided into groups by deep fissures and lined with knobs cut from the rock in the form of towers.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The [[Petra Pool and Garden Complex]] is a series of structures within the city center. Originally said to be a market area,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Petra, vol 3.

Wiegand, T.|publisher=De Gruyter|year=1921|location=Berlin|pages=37‚Äì41}}&lt;/ref&gt; excavations at the site have allowed scholars to identify it as an elaborate Nabataean garden, which included a large swimming pool, an island-pavilion, and an intricate hydraulic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Petra Pool-Complex: a Hellenistic Paradeisos in the Nabataean Capital|last=Bedal, L-A|publisher=Gorgias Press|year=2004|location=Piscataway (NJ)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bedal L-A, Gleason K.

===Huge structure discovered in 2016===
In 2016, archaeologists using [[satellite imagery]] and [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]] discovered a very large, previously unknown monumental structure whose beginnings were tentatively dated to about 150 BCE, the time when the Nabataeans initiated their public building programme. It is located outside the main area of the city, at the foot of Jabal an-Nmayr and about {{cvt|0.5|mi}} south of the city centre, but is facing east, not towards the city, and has no visible relationship to it. The structure consists of a huge, {{cvt|184|by|161|ft}} platform, with a monumental staircase along its eastern side. The large platform enclosed a slightly smaller one, topped with a comparatively small building, {{cvt|28|by|28|ft}}, which was facing east toward the staircase. The structure, second in size only to the [[Ad Deir|Monastery complex]], probably had a ceremonial function of which not even a speculative explanation has yet been offered by the researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Parcak |first1= Sarah |last2= Tuttle |first2= Christopher A. |title= Hiding in Plain Sight: The Discovery of a New Monumental Structure at Petra, Jordan, Using WorldView-1 and WorldView-2 Satellite Imagery |journal= Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research |volume= 375 |date= May 2016 |issue= 375 |pages= 35‚Äì51 |jstor= 10.5615/bullamerschoorie.375.0035 |issn= 0003-097X |doi= 10.5615/bullamerschoorie.375.0035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Archaeologists discover massive Petra monument that could be 2,150 years old |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/09/petra-buried-monument-discovered-jordan |access-date=10 June 2016 |work= The Guardian |date=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Massive New Monument Found in Petra |url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/06/space-archaeology-satellite-petra-ancient-city-discovery-jordan-monument/ |access-date=10 June 2016 |work= National Geographic |date=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism==
[[Image:Petra race-end celebration.JPG|thumb|right|240px|250km race-end celebration]]
Most visitors stay in Petra town's many international-standard hotels with reasonably-short walking access to Petra.

==History==
Though the city was founded relatively late, a sanctuary has existed there since very ancient times{{when|date=December 2019}}.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

===Neolithic===

By 7000 BCE, some of the earliest recorded farmers had settled in [[Beidha (archaeological site)|Beidha]], a [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic]] settlement just north of Petra.&lt;ref name=&quot;PNF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=A Short History |url= http://www.petranationalfoundation.org/history.html |publisher= Petra National Foundation| access-date=13 February 2014| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171204141534/http://www.petranationalfoundation.org/history.html|archive-date=4 December 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bronze Age===
Petra is listed in Egyptian campaign accounts and the [[Amarna letters]] as ''Pel'', ''Sela'' or ''Seir''.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

===Iron Age Edom===
The Edomite site excavated at the top of the Umm el-Biyara mountain at Petra was established not earlier than the seventh century BCE (Iron II).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Bienkowski| first= P. |year= 1992| title= The beginning of the Iron Age in Edom: A reply to Finkelstein| journal= Levant| volume= 24| number= 1| pages= 167‚Äì169|doi= 10.1179/007589192790220919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The emergence of Petra ===
The [[Nabataeans]] were one among several nomadic Bedouin tribes that roamed the [[Arabian Desert]] and moved with their herds to wherever they could find pasture and water.&lt;ref name=&quot;lost kingdom&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FcAoBq4_EnEC|title=Petra and the Lost Kingdom of the Nabataeans |last= Taylor |first= Jane |pages= 14, 17, 30, 31 |year= 2001 |publisher= [[I.B.Tauris]] |location= London |access-date=8 July 2016 |isbn= 9781860645082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Nabataeans were initially embedded in Aramaic culture, theories about them having [[Aramean]] roots are rejected by modern scholars. Instead, archaeological, religious and linguistic evidence confirm that they are a northern [[Tribes of Arabia|Arabian tribe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=A0BdsFRX55cC |title= Arabs in the Shadow of Israel: The Unfolding of God's Prophetic Plan for Ishmael's Line |access-date=8 July 2016 |publisher= Kregel Academic |first= Tony |last= Maalouf |year= 2003 |isbn= 9780825493638}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current evidence suggests that the Nabataean name for Petra was Raqƒìm≈ç, variously spelled in inscriptions as ''rqmw'' or ''rqm''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

====Petra as &quot;Rekem&quot;====
Historian [[Josephus]] (ca. 37‚Äì100) writes that the region as inhabited by the [[Midianites]] during the time of [[Moses]], and that they were ruled by five kings, one of whom was Rekem. Josephus mentions that the city, called Petra by the Greeks, &quot;ranks highest in the land of the Arabs&quot; and was still called '''Rekeme''' by all the Arabs of his time, after its royal founder (Antiquities iv. 7, 1; 4, 7).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url= http://www.loebclassics.com/view/josephus-jewish_antiquities/1930/pb_LCL490.79.xml?mainRsKey=zBRKmE&amp;result=1&amp;rskey=O69i4Z |doi=10.4159/DLCL.josephus-jewish_antiquities.1930 |title=Jewish Antiquities |year=1930 |last1=Josephus |via=[[Loeb Classical Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RekemInscription.jpg|thumb|The Rekem Inscription before it was buried by the bridge abutments]]

The name 'Rekem' (''rqm'') was inscribed in the rock wall of the Wadi Musa opposite the entrance to the Siq.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Iain |last= Browning |title= Petra |publisher= Chatto &amp; Windus |year= 1974 |page= 109}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jordan built a bridge over the wadi and this inscription was buried beneath tons of concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= History of Petra| url= http://www.terhaal.com/history-petra |publisher= Terhaal Adventures |access-date= 2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Petra as &quot;Sela&quot;====
{{see also|Sela (Edom)#Confusion with Petra}}
An old theory held that Petra might be identified with a place called ''sela'' in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. ''Encyclop√¶dia Britannica'' (1911) states that the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] name of the city, if not Sela, would remain unknown. It nevertheless cautioned that ''sela'' simply means &quot;rock&quot; in Hebrew, and thence might not be identified with a city where it occurs in the biblical text.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The passage in [[Diodorus Siculus]] (xix. 94‚Äì97) which describes the expeditions which [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]] sent against the Nabataeans in 312 BCE, was understood by some researchers ‚Äì and not so by others ‚Äì to throw some light upon the history of Petra, but the &quot;petra&quot; (Greek for rock) referred to as a natural fortress and place of refuge cannot be a proper name, and the description implies that there was no town in existence there at the time.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author-link= Diodorus Siculus| author= Diodorus Siculus| title= Account of Antigonus' expedition to Arabia| volume= xix| chapter-url= http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/19E*.html#93 |chapter= Section 95 (note 79)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman period===

In AD 106, when [[Aulus Cornelius Palma Frontonianus|Cornelius Palma]] was governor of [[Roman Syria|Syria]], the part of [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] under the rule of Petra was absorbed into the [[Roman Empire]] as part of ''[[Arabia Petraea]]'', and Petra became its capital.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius, LXVII. 14, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The native dynasty came to an end but the city continued to flourish under Roman rule. It was around this time that the Petra Roman Road was built. A century later, in the time of [[Alexander Severus]], when the city was at the height of its splendor, the issue of coinage came to an end. There was no more building of sumptuous tombs, owing apparently to some sudden catastrophe, such as an invasion by the neo-[[Iran|Persian]] power under the [[Sassanid Empire]].&lt;ref name= EB1911/&gt;

Meanwhile, as [[Palmyra]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 130‚Äì270) grew in importance and attracted the Arabian trade away from Petra, the latter declined. It appears, however, to have lingered on as a religious centre. Another Roman road was constructed at the site. [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] (c.315‚Äì403) writes that in his time a feast was held there on December 25 in honour of the virgin [[Khaabou]] (Chaabou) and her offspring [[Dushara]].&lt;ref name= EB1911/&gt; Dushara and al-Uzza were two of the main deities of the city, which otherwise included many idols from other Nabataean deities such as Allat and Manat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= The Religious Life of Nabataea| chapter= Chapter 2| year= 2013| first= Peter| last= Alpass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 111 and 114, [[Trajan]] built the [[Via Traiana Nova]], running from the Syrian border to the Red Sea through Petra. This road followed the old routes of Nabataean caravans. In the shadow of the [[Pax Romana]], this route revived trade between Arabia, Syria, and Mediterranean harbors. In 125 AD, one of Emperor [[Hadrian]]'s administrators left marks{{dubious|Meaning what?|date=December 2019}} in Petra, pointed out by documents found at the [[Dead Sea]]. In 130 AD, Hadrian visited the former Nabataean capital, giving it the name of ''Hadriane Petra Metropolis'', imprinted on his coins. His visit, however, did not lead to any boom in architectural development and new buildings as it did in [[Jerash]]. The province's governor, Sextius Florentinus, erected a monumental [[mausoleum]] for his son near the end of the al-Hubta (King's Wall) tombs, which had been generally reserved during the Nabataean period for the royal family.

The interest that Roman emperors showed for the city in the 3rd century suggests that Petra and its environs remained highly esteemed for a long time. An inscription to [[Liber Pater]], a god revered by Emperor [[Septimius Severus]], was found in the ''[[temenos]]'' of the temple known as [[Qasr al-Bint]], and Nabataean tombs contained silver coins with the Emperor's portrait, as well as pottery from his reign. Emperor [[Elagabalus]] declared Petra to be a [[Colonia (Roman)|Roman colony]], when he reorganised the Roman Empire towards the end of the 3rd century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| website= jordantourspetra.com| url= http://www.jordantourspetra.com/en/petra-jordan.html |title= Petra Jordan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area from Petra to [[Wadi Mujib]], the [[Negev]], and the [[Sinai Peninsula]] were annexed into the province of [[Palaestina Salutaris]]. Petra may be seen on the [[Madaba Map|Madaba mosaic map]] from the reign of Emperor [[Justinian]].

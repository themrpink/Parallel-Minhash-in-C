[[File:Catania BW 2012-10-06 11-32-08 2 fj.JPG|thumb|[[Giovanni Battista Vaccarini]]'s Duomo façade (1736) is an example of the city's [[Sicilian Baroque]] architecture]]
{{more citations needed section|date=September 2014}}
The symbol of the city is ''u Liotru'', or the ''Fontana dell'Elefante'', assembled in 1736 by [[Giovanni Battista Vaccarini]]. It portrays an ancient lavic stone elephant and is topped by an Egyptian obelisk from [[Aswan|Syene]]. Legend has it that Vaccarini's original elephant was neuter, which the men of Catania took as an insult to their virility. To appease them, Vaccarini appropriately appended elephantine testicles to the original statue.

The [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] name ''u Liotru'' is a phonetic change of Heliodorus, a nobleman who, after trying without success to become bishop of the city, became a sorcerer and was therefore condemned to the stake. Legend has it that [[Heliodorus of Catania|Heliodorus]] himself was the sculptor of the lava elephant and that he used to magically ride it in his fantastic travels from Catania to Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;Amari Michele (1933), ''Storia dei Musulmani di Sicilia'', Catania, Nallino, Vol. I, pp. 344–345&lt;/ref&gt; Another legend has it that Heliodorus was able to transform himself into an elephant.

The presence of an elephant in the millenary history of Catania is surely connected to both zooarcheology and popular creeds. In fact, the prehistoric fauna of Sicily from the Upper [[Paleolithic]], included [[dwarf elephant]]s. Paleontologist [[Othenio Abel]] suggested that the presence of [[dwarf elephant]]s in [[Sicily]] may be the origin of the legend of the [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]]. [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], after finding the skulls of [[dwarf elephant]]s, about twice the size of a [[human skull]], with a large central [[nasal cavity]] (mistaken for a large single eye-socket) supposed that they were skulls of giants with a single eye.

The ''Catanian Museum of [[Mineralogy]], [[Paleontology]] and [[Vulcanology]]'' holds the integral unburied skeleton of an ''[[Elephas falconeri]] ''in an excellent state of conservation. The first inhabitants of Etna molded such lavic artifact to idolize the mythical proboscidian.

===Classical buildings===
The city has been buried by lava a total of seventeen times in [[Recorded History|recorded history]], and in layers under the present day city are the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city that preceded it, and the Greek city before that. Many of the [[ancient monument]]s of the Roman city have been destroyed by the numerous seisms. Currently, different ancient remains can be seen and visited in the city-centre, as part of an archaeological park (Parco Archeologico Greco-Romano di Catania).

Catania is the first economic and industrial hub of Sicily. The city is famous for its mainly [[petrochemical industry]], and the extraction of [[sulphur]]. In the year 2000, according to Census, Catania was the 14th richest city in Italy, with a GDP of US$6.6 billion (€6.304 billion), which was 0.54% of the Italian GDP, a GDP per capita of US$21,000 (€20,100) and an average GDP per employee of US$69,000 (€66,100).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regione.basilicata.it/dipattivitaproduttive/default.cfm?fuseaction=linkdoc&amp;doc=519&amp;link=527 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040318203933/http://www.regione.basilicata.it/dipattivitaproduttive/default.cfm?fuseaction=linkdoc&amp;doc=519&amp;link=527 |archive-date=18 March 2004 |title=La ricchezza del territorio italiano |publisher=webcache.googleusercontent.com |access-date=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late-19th century and early-20th century, Catania began to be heavily industrialised, with its several factories and chimneys, often to the extant that it was referred to as Southern Italy's &quot;Manchester&quot;.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The economy of Catania suffered heavily from the bad effects of [[World War I]], and was marked by an economic crisis and recession that culminated in the 1920s.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Since then, the city lost its industrial and entrepreneurial importance.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} In the 1930s, Catania remained a small fishing town with derelict and disused industries. However, after the destruction of [[World War II]], Catania's economy began to re-grow in the late-1950s and early-1960s.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} As a matter of fact, the city's economic growth was so rapid and dynamic that it was often nicknamed the ''&quot;Milan of the South&quot;'', or in Italian ''&quot;Milano del Sud&quot;''.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} This rapid economic growth prompted a great number of Sicilians living in the more rural areas, or smaller towns such as Enna, Ragusa and Caltanissetta, to move to the city to seek new jobs.

Today, Catania, despite several problems, has one of the most dynamic economies in the whole of Southern Italy. It still has a strong industrial and agricultural sector, and a fast-growing tourist industry, with many international visitors coming to visit the city's main sights and the nearby Etna volcano. It contains the headquarters or important offices of companies such as [[STMicroelectronics]], and also several chemical and [[pharmaceutical]] businesses. There have been several new business developments to further boost Catania's economy, including the construction of Etnapolis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centroetnapolis.it/etnapolis/index.html |title=home |publisher=Centroetnapolis.it |access-date=1 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617005527/http://www.centroetnapolis.it/etnapolis/index.html |archive-date=17 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a big [[shopping mall]] designed by [[Massimiliano Fuksas]], the same architect who designed the [[FieraMilano]] industrial fair in Milan, or the Etna Valley,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etnavalley.com/ |title=Oggi la chiamano Etna Valley: i progetti, le aziende, il lavoro nel territorio di Catania |publisher=Etnavalley.com |date=29 April 2010 |access-date=1 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527005056/http://www.etnavalley.com/ |archive-date=27 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where several high-tech offices are located.

[[Tourism]] is a fast-growing industry in Catania. Lately the administration and private companies have made several investments in the [[hospitality industry]] in order to make tourism a competitive sector in the Metropolitan City. [[Etnaland]], a big [[amusement park|amusement]] and [[water park]] located in [[Belpasso]], in the Metropolitan area of Catania, 12 kilometers (7 miles) from the city center, is the largest in Southern Italy and attracts thousands of tourists, not only from [[Sicily]], but also from the rest of [[Italy]]: according to [[Tripadvisor]] (2018) it is the third water park in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tripadvisor.mediaroom.com/press-releases?item=126033|title=TripAdvisor Announces the Top Amusement Parks and Water Parks Around the Globe in Travellers' Choice Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's [[patron saint]] is [[Agatha of Sicily|Saint Agatha]], who is celebrated with a religious pageantry, the [[Festival of Saint Agatha (Catania)|Festival of Saint Agatha]], on 5 February every year.

The city is base of the newspaper ''[[La Sicilia]]'' and of the TV-channel [[Antenna Sicilia]] also known as [[Sicilia Channel]]. Several others [[Television channel|local television]] channels and free-press magazines have their headquarters in Catania.

The city is home to the [[Catania Jazz Festival]], which typically runs for several winter months with concerts in different locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.traghettiper-sicilia.it/en/tp-magazine/catania-jazz-festival-2017/|ref={{harvid|Catania Jazz Festival – Traghettiper-sicilia}}

In the late 1980s and during the 1990s Catania had a sparkling and unique [[popular music]] scene. [[Indie pop]] and [[indie rock]] bands, local radio station and dynamic [[independent music]] [[record label]]s sprung. As a result, in those years the city experienced a vital and effervescent cultural period. Artists like [[Carmen Consoli]] and [[Mario Venuti]] and internationally known [[indie rock]] bands like [[Uzeda]] came out of this cultural ''milieu''.

The city is the home of [[Amatori Catania]] [[rugby union]] team, [[Calcio Catania]] [[football team]] and [[Orizzonte Catania]], the latter being a women's [[water polo]] club, winning eight European Champions Cup titles from 1994 to 2008. Noted Italian [[basketball]] coach [[Ettore Messina]] is a native of Catania. The city also hosted the first ever qualification tournament for the [[1993 Rugby World Cup Sevens|Rugby World Cup Sevens]] in 1992, and the associated Etna Cup, which was won by the host Sicily team. In addition, the [[Catania Elephants]] are currently members of the [[Italian Football League]]. Catania also hosted the 2011 FIE Fencing World Championships.

==Food and cuisine==
[[Image:Arancini .jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Arancini]]]]
[[Image:Pasta alla Norma (2563876877).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Pasta alla Norma]]]]
Food is an important part of Catania's culture and way of life. Local cuisine emphasizes several traits of [[Sicilian cuisine|Sicilian one]], whilst developing some of its own.

[[Street food]] is one of the best ways to experience traditional dishes. [[Arancini]] are perhaps the city's most iconic one: they are stuffed rice balls coated in bread-crumbs and deep fried; in Catania, they are shaped like a cone to remind of [[Mount Etna]]. Typical specialties from the city include ''{{lang|scn|cipollina}}'' (puff pastry with onion, tomato and prosciutto filling), ''bolognese'' (a small pizza topped with tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto and boiled egg and covered in puff pastry), ''{{lang|scn|crispelle}}'' (deep fried dough balls with [[ricotta]] or anchovies filling.)

During street-fairs and religious festivals, street stalls sell ''{{lang|scn|calia e simenza}}'' (toasted chickpeas and pumpkin seeds). Typical from old street markets are ''{{lang|scn|sangeli}}'' (cooked pork blood), ''{{lang|scn|quarumi}}'' (pork tripe), ''{{lang|scn|zuzzu}}'' (pork jelly), ''{{lang|scn|mauru}}'' (edible seaweed), and raw seafood.

Drink [[kiosks]] are everywhere in town and serve [[soft drink]]s. Traditional soft drinks are made mixing fruit syrups with [[carbonated water|soda]] and other flavors such as [[anisette]]. They are thirst-killer and they are very popular with the locals and the tourists.

Local products include [[blood orange]]s, [[pistachio]]s from [[Bronte, Sicily|Bronte]], extra-virgin [[olive oil]], [[opuntia|cactus fruit]], [[cherry|cherries]], [[grape]]s from [[Mazzarrone]], [[strawberry|strawberries]] from [[Maletto]], [[mushroom]]s, [[honey]] and [[wine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.agricolturafinanziamenti.com/elenco-dei-prodotti-siciliani-di-qualita/|title=Elenco dei prodotti siciliani di qualità|access-date=6 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

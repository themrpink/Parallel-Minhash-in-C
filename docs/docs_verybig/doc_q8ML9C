'''Whitefish''' or '''white fish''' is a [[fisheries]] term for several species of [[demersal fish]] with [[fin]]s, particularly [[Atlantic cod]] (''Gadus morhua''), [[whiting (fish)|whiting]] (''Merluccius bilinearis''), [[haddock]] (''Melanogrammus aeglefinus''), [[hake]] (''Urophycis''), [[pollock]] (''Pollachius''), and others. Whitefish ([[Freshwater whitefish|Coregonidae]]) is also the name of several species of [[Atlantic]] [[freshwater fish]].

Whitefish live on or near the [[seafloor]], and can be contrasted with the [[Oily fish|oily]] or [[pelagic fish]] which live in the [[water column]] away from the seafloor.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}} Whitefish do not have much [[fish oil|oil]] in their tissue, and have flakier white or light-coloured flesh. Most of the oil found in their bodies is concentrated in the organs, e.g. [[cod liver oil]].

Whitefish can be divided into [[benthopelagic fish]] (round fish which live ''near'' the sea bed, such as [[cod]] and [[Coley (fish)|coley]]) and [[benthic fish]] (which live ''on'' the sea bed, such as [[flatfish]] like [[plaice]]).

Whitefish is sometimes eaten straight but is often used reconstituted for [[fishstick]]s, [[gefilte fish]], [[lutefisk]], [[surimi]] (imitation [[crab]]meat), etc.  For centuries it was [[drying (food)|preserved by drying]] as [[stockfish]] and [[clipfish]] and traded as a world commodity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mark |last=Kurlansky |title=Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World |location=New York |publisher=Walker |year=1997 |isbn=0-8027-1326-2 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/codbiographyof00kurl }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is commonly used as the fish in the classic British dish of [[fish and chips]].

'''Clairvaux Abbey''' ({{IPAc-en|k|l|ɛər|ˈ|v|oʊ}}, {{IPA-fr|klɛʁvo|lang}}; {{lang-la|Clara Vallis}}) was a [[Cistercian]] [[monastery]] in [[Ville-sous-la-Ferté]], 15&amp;nbsp;km from [[Bar-sur-Aube]], in the Kingdom of Burgundy.(It was not in France in those days) The original building, founded in 1115 by [[Bernard of Clairvaux|St. Bernard]], is now in ruins; the present structure dates from 1708.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clairvaux&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|first=Jean-François|last=Leroux-Dhuys|title=Clairvaux : de l'abbaye à la prison|language=fr|series=La Marche de l'Histoire|network=[[France Inter]]|date=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clairvaux Abbey was a good example of the general layout of a Cistercian monastery. The Abbey has been listed since 1926 as a [[Monument historique|historical monument]] by the [[French Ministry of Culture]].

The grounds are now occupied and used by [[Clairvaux Prison]], a high-security [[prison]].

==Description==
[[File:Plan.abbaye.Clairvaux.2.png|150px|left|thumb|Plan of the abbey.]]Cistercian monasteries were all arranged according to a set plan unless the circumstances of the locality forbade it. A strong wall, furnished at intervals with watchtowers and other defenses, surrounded the abbey precincts. Beyond it a [[moat]], artificially diverted from tributaries which flow through the precincts, completely or partially encircled the wall. This water furnished the monastery with an abundant supply of water for [[irrigation]], sanitation, and for the use of the offices and workshops.

An additional wall, running from north to south, bisected the monastery into an &quot;inner&quot; and &quot;outer&quot; ward. The inner ward housed the monastic buildings, while the agricultural and other artisan endeavors were carried out in the outer ward.

The precincts were entered by a gateway at the extreme western extremity, giving admission to the lower ward. Here the barns, granaries, stables, shambles (slaughtering yard), workshops, and workmen's lodgings were located. Convenience was the only consideration for design. A single gatehouse afforded communication through the wall separating the outer from the inner ward.

On passing through the gateway, monks and visitors entered the outer court of the inner ward, to face the western facade of the monastic church. Immediately to the right of entrance was the abbot's residence, in close proximity to the guest-house. On the other side of the court were stables for the accommodation of the horses of the guests and their attendants. The church occupied a central position, with the great [[cloister]] to the south, surrounded by the chief monastic buildings. Further to the east, the smaller cloister contained the infirmary, novices' lodgings, and quarters for the aged monks. Beyond the smaller cloister, and separated from the monastic buildings by a wall, lay the vegetable gardens and orchards. Large fish ponds were also located in the area east of the monastic buildings. The ponds were an important feature of monastic life, and much care was given by the monks to their construction and maintenance. They often remain as one of the few visible traces of these vast monasteries.

The church consists of a vast [[nave]] of eleven bays, entered by a [[narthex]], with a [[transept]] and short apsidal choir. To the east of each limb of the transept are two square chapels, divided according to Cistercian rule by solid walls. Nine radiating chapels, similarly divided, surround the apse. The stalls of the monks occupy the four eastern bays of the nave, forming the ritual choir. There was a second range of stalls in the extreme western bays of the nave for the [[lay brother]]s. The cloister was located to the south of the church so that its inhabitants could benefit from ample sunshine.

The [[chapter house]] opened out of the east walk of the cloister in parallel with the south transept.

'''Dudley Stuart John Moore''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (19 April 1935{{spaced ndash}}27 March 2002) was an English actor, comedian, musician, and composer. Moore first came to prominence in the UK as a leading figure in the British [[satire boom]] of the 1960s. He was one of the four writer-performers in the comedy revue ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'' from 1960 that created a boom in satiric comedy, and with one member of that team, [[Peter Cook]], collaborated on the BBC television series ''[[Not Only... But Also]]''. The [[double act]] worked on other projects until the mid-1970s, by which time Moore had settled in Los Angeles to concentrate on his film acting.

His solo career as a comedy film actor was heightened by the success of hit Hollywood films, particularly ''[[Foul Play (1978 film)|Foul Play]]'' (1978), ''[[10 (film)|10]]'' (1979) and ''[[Arthur (1981 film)|Arthur]]'' (1981). For ''Arthur'', Moore was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] and won a [[Golden Globe Award]]. He received a second Golden Globe for his performance in ''[[Micki &amp; Maude]]'' (1984).

==Early life==
Moore was born at the original [[Charing Cross Hospital]] in [[central London]], the son of Ada Francis (née Hughes), a secretary, and John Moore, a railway electrician. His father was Scottish, from [[Glasgow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1389041/Dudley-Moore.html |title=Obituaries: Dudley Moore |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited – Telegraph.Co.UK |date=22 March 2002 |accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Moore was brought up in [[Dagenham]], [[Essex]]. He was notably short at {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m|abbr=on}} and was born with [[club feet]] that required extensive hospital treatment and, coupled with his diminutive stature, made him the butt of jokes from other children. His right foot responded well to corrective treatment and had straightened itself by the time he was six, but his left foot became permanently twisted and consequently his left leg below the knee was withered. This was something of which he remained very self-conscious throughout his life.

Moore became a [[choirboy]] at the age of six. At age eleven he earned a scholarship to the [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama|Guildhall School of Music]], where he took up harpsichord, organ, violin, musical theory and composition.&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dudleymoore.com/about/bio.htm |title=The Official Site of Dudley Moore: Biography |publisher=The Estate of Dudley Moore - DudleyMoore.com |accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rapidly developed into a highly talented pianist and organist and was playing the pipe organ at local church weddings by the age of 14. He attended [[The Sydney Russell School|Dagenham County High School]] where he received musical tuition from a dedicated teacher, [[Peter Cook]], who became a friend and confidant to Moore and continued to correspond with him until 1994.

Moore's musical talent won him an [[organ scholar]]ship to [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], where he was tutored by the composer [[Bernard Rose (musician)|Bernard Rose]].&lt;ref name=official/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rose&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Bernard Rose (Obituary) | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-bernard-rose-1312755.html | work=The Independent | date=3 December 1996 | accessdate=28 May 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822093958/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-bernard-rose-1312755.html |archivedate=22 August 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; While studying music and composition there, he also performed with [[Alan Bennett]] in the [[The Oxford Revue|Oxford Revue]]. During his university years, Moore had developed a love of [[jazz]] music and soon became an accomplished jazz pianist and composer. He began working with musicians such as [[John Dankworth]] and [[Cleo Laine]].

In 1960 he left Dankworth's band to work on ''Beyond the Fringe''.

==Career==

===''Beyond the Fringe''===
[[File:Beyond the Fringe original cast.JPG|thumb|Moore (left) in ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'', c. 1963. Creating a boom in [[satirical comedy]], thousands of shows were played on both sides of the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The day that sparked the satire boom |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3650808/The-day-that-sparked-the-satire-boom.html |accessdate=27 September 2019 |work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Johnny Bassett|John Bassett]], a graduate of [[Wadham College, Oxford]] recommended Moore, his jazz bandmate and a rising cabaret talent, to producer Robert Ponsonby, who was putting together a comedy revue entitled ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]''. Bassett also chose [[Jonathan Miller]]. Moore then recommended [[Alan Bennett]], who in turn suggested [[Peter Cook]].

''Beyond the Fringe'' was at the forefront of the 1960s UK [[satire boom]], although the show's original runs in Edinburgh and the provinces in 1960 had had a lukewarm response. When the revue transferred to the [[Fortune Theatre]] in London, in a revised production by [[Donald Albery]] and [[William Donaldson]], it became a sensation, thanks in some part to a favourable review by [[Kenneth Tynan]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey Carpenter ''That Was Satire That Was'', pp. 122–23; Tynan's review is extensively quoted.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also a number of musical items in the show, using Dudley Moore's music, most famously an arrangement of the [[Colonel Bogey March]] which seemingly resists Moore's repeated attempts to bring it to an end.

In 1962 the show transferred to the [[John Golden Theatre]] in New York, with its original cast. President [[John F. Kennedy]] attended a performance on 10 February 1963. The show continued in New York until 1964.

===Partnership with Peter Cook===
When Moore returned to the UK he was offered his own series on the [[BBC]], ''[[Not Only... But Also]]'' (1965, 1966, 1970). It was commissioned specifically as a vehicle for Moore, but when he invited [[Peter Cook]] on as a guest, their [[double act|comedy partnership]] was so notable that it became a permanent fixture of the series. Cook and Moore are most remembered for their sketches as two working class men, [[Pete and Dud]], in macs and cloth caps, commenting on politics and the arts, but they also fashioned a series of one-off characters, usually with Moore in the role of interviewer to one of Cook's upper-class eccentrics.

The pair developed an unorthodox method for scripting the material, using a tape recorder to tape an ad-libbed routine that they would then have transcribed and edited. This would not leave enough time to fully rehearse the script, so they often had a set of cue cards. Moore was famous for &quot;[[corpsing]]&quot; so, as the programmes often went out live, Cook would deliberately make him laugh in order to get an even bigger reaction from the studio audience. The BBC [[wiped]] much of the series, though some of the soundtracks (which were issued on record) have survived. In 1968 Cook and Moore briefly switched to [[Associated TeleVision|ATV]] for four one-hour programmes entitled ''[[Goodbye Again (TV)|Goodbye Again]]''; however, they were not as critically well-received as the BBC shows.

On film, Moore and Cook appeared in the 1966 British comedy film ''[[The Wrong Box]]'', before co-writing and co-starring in ''[[Bedazzled (1967 film)|Bedazzled]]'' (1967) with [[Eleanor Bron]].&lt;ref name=la&gt;{{cite web |url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/dudley-moore/ |title=Hollywood Star Walk: Dudley Moore |work=Patrick Kevin Day, Los Angeles Times - Projects.LATimes.com |date=23 February 2010 |accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Set in [[Swinging London]] of the 1960s, ''Bedazzled'' was directed by [[Stanley Donen]]. The pair closed the decade with appearances in the ensemble caper film ''[[Monte Carlo or Bust]]'' and [[Richard Lester]]'s ''[[The Bed Sitting Room (film)|The Bed Sitting Room]]'', based on the play by [[Spike Milligan]] and [[John Antrobus]]. In 1968 and 1969 Moore embarked on two solo comedy ventures, firstly in the film ''[[30 is a Dangerous Age, Cynthia]]'' and secondly, on stage, for an Anglicised adaptation of [[Woody Allen]]'s ''Play It Again, Sam'' at the [[Gielgud Theatre|Globe Theatre]] in London's [[West End of London|West End]].

In the 1970s the relationship between Moore and Cook became increasingly strained as the latter's alcoholism began affecting his work. In 1971, however, Cook and Moore took sketches from ''Not Only....But Also'' and ''Goodbye Again'', together with new material, to create the stage revue ''Behind the Fridge''. This show toured Australia in 1972 before transferring to New York City in 1973, re-titled as ''Good Evening''. Cook frequently appeared on and off stage the worse for drink. Nonetheless, the show proved very popular and it won [[Tony Award|Tony]] and [[Grammy Award]]s.

When the Broadway run of ''Good Evening'' ended, Moore stayed on in the U.S. to pursue his film acting ambitions in Hollywood, but the pair reunited to host ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on 24 January 1976 during SNL's first season. They performed a number of their classic stage routines, including &quot;[[One Leg Too Few]]&quot; and &quot;Frog and Peach&quot;, among others, in addition to participating in some skits with the show's ensemble.

It was during the Broadway run of ''Good Evening'' that Cook persuaded Moore to take the humour of Pete and Dud farther on [[gramophone record|long-playing records]] as [[Derek and Clive]]. [[Chris Blackwell]] circulated [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] copies to friends in the music business and the popularity of the recording convinced Cook to release it commercially as ''[[Derek and Clive (Live)]]'' (1976). Two further &quot;Derek and Clive&quot; albums, ''[[Derek and Clive Come Again]]'' (1977) and ''[[Derek and Clive Ad Nauseam]]'' (1978), were later released. The latter was also filmed for a documentary, ''[[Derek and Clive Get the Horn]]''. In the film it is clear tensions between the two men were at a breaking point, with Moore at one point walking out of the recording room singing, 'Breaking up is so easy to do.' In 2009, it came to light that, at the time, three separate British police forces had wanted them to be prosecuted under obscenity laws for their &quot;Derek and Clive&quot; comedy recordings.

The last significant appearance for the partnership was in 1978's ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles (1978 film)|The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'', where Moore played [[Dr. Watson]] to Cook's [[Sherlock Holmes]], as well as three other roles: in drag; as a one-legged man; and at the start and end of the film as a flamboyant and mischievous pianist. He also wrote the film's score. Co-star [[Terry-Thomas]] described it as &quot;the most outrageous film I ever appeared in&amp;nbsp;... there was no magic&amp;nbsp;... it was bad!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas |first1=Terry|last2=Daum|first2=Terry|title=Terry-Thomas Tells Tales: An Autobiography |date=1990|publisher=Robson Books|isbn=9780860516620|page=117|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fjQeAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was not a success critically or financially.

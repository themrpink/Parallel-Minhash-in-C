At the time of publication, the authors of ''The Federalist Papers'' attempted to hide their identities due to Hamilton and Madison having attended the convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Barendt|first=Eric|url={{GBurl|id=D4UyDAAAQBAJ|pg=PT54}}|title=Anonymous Speech: Literature, Law and Politics|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2016|isbn=9781509904075|location=New York|page=38|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astute observers, however, correctly discerned the identities of Hamilton, Madison, and Jay. Establishing authorial authenticity of the essays that comprise ''The Federalist Papers'' has not always been clear. After Alexander Hamilton died in 1804, a list emerged, claiming that he alone had written two-thirds of ''The Federalist'' essays. Some believe that several of these essays were written by James Madison (Nos. 49–58 and 62–63).  The scholarly detective work of [[Douglass Adair]] in 1944 postulated the following assignments of authorship, corroborated in 1964 by a computer analysis of the text:&lt;ref name=&quot;MostellerWallace2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mosteller |first1=Frederick |authorlink1=Frederick Mosteller |last2=Wallace |first2=David L. |title=Applied Bayesian and Classical Inference: The Case of ''The Federalist'' Papers |url={{GBurl|id=LJXaBwAAQBAJ}} |year=2012 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-1-4612-5256-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Alexander Hamilton (51 articles: Nos. 1, 6–9, 11–13, 15–17, 21–36, 59–61, and 65–85)
* James Madison (29 articles: Nos. 10, 14, 18–20,&lt;ref name=&quot;three&quot;/&gt; 37–58 and 62–63)
* John Jay (5 articles: Nos. 2–5 and 64).

In six months, a total of 85 articles were written by the three men. Hamilton, who had been a leading advocate of national constitutional reform throughout the 1780s and was one of the three representatives for [[New York (state)|New York]] at the [[Philadelphia convention|Constitutional Convention]], in 1789 became the first [[Secretary of the Treasury]], a post he held until his resignation in 1795. Madison, who is now acknowledged as the father of the Constitution—despite his repeated rejection of this honor during his lifetime,&lt;ref name=Banning&gt;Banning, Lance. [https://www.loc.gov/loc/madison/banning-paper.html ''James Madison: Federalist''], note 1. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113131332/http://www.loc.gov/loc/madison/banning-paper.html |date=2018-01-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; became a leading member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Virginia (1789–1797), Secretary of State (1801–1809), and ultimately the fourth [[President of the United States]] (1809-1817).&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Ralph Ketcham, ''James Madison''.

Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; John Jay, who had been secretary for foreign affairs under the [[Articles of Confederation]] from 1784 through their expiration in 1789, became the first [[Chief Justice of the United States]] in 1789, stepping down in 1795 to accept election as governor of New York, a post he held for two terms, retiring in 1801.

===Publication===
[[File:An Advertisement of The Federalist - Project Gutenberg eText 16960.jpg|thumb|An advertisement for the book edition of ''The Federalist'']]
''The Federalist'' articles appeared in three New York newspapers: ''[[The Independent Journal]]'', the ''New-York Packet'', and the ''Daily Advertiser'', beginning on October 27, 1787. Although written and published with haste, ''The Federalist'' articles were widely read and greatly influenced the shape of American political institutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica2007&quot;/&gt; Hamilton, Madison and Jay published the essays at a rapid pace. At times, three to four new essays by Publius appeared in the papers in a single week. Garry Wills observes that this fast pace of production &quot;overwhelmed&quot; any possible response: &quot;Who, given ample time could have answered such a battery of arguments? And no time was given.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wills, xii.&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton also encouraged the reprinting of the essays in newspapers outside New York state, and indeed they were published in several other states where the ratification debate was taking place. However, they were only irregularly published outside New York, and in other parts of the country they were often overshadowed by local writers.&lt;ref&gt;Furtwangler, [{{GBurl|id=mfWGAAAAMAAJ|p=20}} p. 20].&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the essays were initially published in New York, most of them begin with the same [[salutation]]: &quot;To the People of the State of New York&quot;.

The high demand for the essays led to their publication in a more permanent form. On January 1, 1788, the New York publishing firm J. &amp; A. McLean announced that they would publish the first 36 essays as a bound volume; that volume was released on March 22, 1788, and was titled ''The Federalist'' Volume 1.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloyd&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Gordon|last=Lloyd|url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/ratification/federalist/|title=Introduction to the Federalist|publisher=teachingamericanhistory.org|accessdate=2018-06-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618102440/http://teachingamericanhistory.org/ratification/federalist/|archive-date=2018-06-18|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; New essays continued to appear in the newspapers; [[Federalist No. 77]] was the last number to appear first in that form, on April 2. A second bound volume was released on May 28, containing Federalist Nos. 37–77 and the previously unpublished Nos. 78–85.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloyd&quot;/&gt; The last eight papers (Nos. 78–85) were republished in the New York newspapers between June 14 and August 16, 1788.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloyd&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Founding Fathers: The Essential Guide to the Men Who Made America |url={{GBurl|id=tcnL-Alo9lsC}} |year=2007 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-470-11792-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1792 French edition ended the collective anonymity of Publius, announcing that the work had been written by &quot;Mm. Hamilton, Maddisson e Gay, citoyens de l'État de New York&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Emerson1977&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Emerson |editor-first=Everett H. |last=Bain |first=Robert |chapter=The Federalist |title=American Literature, 1764-1789: The Revolutionary Years |chapter-url={{GBurl|id=DDvjVgAkqnAC|pg=260}} |year=1977 |publisher=Univ. of Wisconsin Press |isbn=978-0-299-07270-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/americanliteratu00emer/page/260 260] |url=https://archive.org/details/americanliteratu00emer/page/260 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1802, George Hopkins published an American edition that similarly named the authors. Hopkins wished as well that &quot;the name of the writer should be prefixed to each number,&quot; but at this point Hamilton insisted that this was not to be, and the division of the essays among the three authors remained a secret.&lt;ref&gt;Adair, 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first publication to divide the papers in such a way was an 1810 edition that used a list left by Hamilton to associate the authors with their numbers; this edition appeared as two volumes of the compiled &quot;Works of Hamilton&quot;. In 1818, Jacob Gideon published a new edition with a new listing of authors, based on a list provided by Madison. The difference between Hamilton's list and Madison's formed the basis for a dispute over the authorship of a dozen of the essays.&lt;ref&gt;Adair, 44–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Hopkins's and Gideon's editions incorporated significant edits to the text of the papers themselves, generally with the approval of the authors.  In 1863, Henry Dawson published [[:s:The Federalist (Dawson)|an edition]] containing the original text of the papers, arguing that they should be preserved as they were written in that particular historical moment, not as edited by the authors years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Henry Cabot |editor-last=Lodge|title= The Federalist, a Commentary on the Constitution of the United States| publisher=Putnam| year=1902 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=9S-HAAAAMAAJ |accessdate=2009-02-16 |pages= xxxviii–xliii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholars generally use the text prepared by Jacob E. Cooke for his 1961 edition of ''The Federalist''; this edition used the newspaper texts for essay numbers 1–76 and the McLean edition for essay numbers 77–85.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison (Jacob E. Cooke, ed., ''The Federalist'' (Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1961 and later reprintings). {{ISBN|978-0-8195-6077-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disputed essays===
[[File:John Jay (Gilbert Stuart portrait).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[John Jay]], author of five of ''The Federalist Papers'', later became the first Chief Justice of the United States]]
While the authorship of 73 of ''The Federalist'' essays is fairly certain, the identities of those who wrote the twelve remaining essays are disputed by some scholars. The modern consensus is that Madison wrote essays Nos. 49–58, with Nos. 18–20 being products of a collaboration between him and Hamilton; [[Federalist No. 64|No. 64]] was by John Jay. The first open designation of which essay belonged to whom was provided by Hamilton who, in the days before his ultimately fatal gun duel with [[Aaron Burr]], provided his lawyer with a list detailing the author of each number. This list credited Hamilton with a full 63 of the essays (three of those being jointly written with Madison), almost three-quarters of the whole, and was used as the basis for an 1810 printing that was the first to make specific attribution for the essays.&lt;ref&gt;Adair, 46–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Madison did not immediately dispute Hamilton's list, but provided his own list for the 1818 Gideon edition of ''The Federalist''. Madison claimed 29 essays for himself, and he suggested that the difference between the two lists was &quot;owing doubtless to the hurry in which [Hamilton's] memorandum was made out.&quot; A known error in Hamilton's list—Hamilton incorrectly ascribed [[Federalist No. 54|No. 54]] to John Jay, when in fact, Jay wrote No. 64—provided some evidence for Madison's suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;Adair, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stylometry|Statistical analysis]] has been undertaken on several occasions in attempts to accurately identify the author of each individual essay. After examining word choice and writing style, studies generally agree that the disputed essays were written by James Madison. However, there are notable exceptions maintaining that some of the essays which are now widely attributed to Madison were, in fact, collaborative efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;MostellerWallace2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/B:CHUM.0000009291.06947.52 |first1=Jeff |last1=Collins |first2=David |last2=Kaufer |first3=Pantelis |last3=Vlachos |first4=Brian |last4=Butler |first5=Suguru |last5=Ishizaki |title=Detecting Collaborations in Text: Comparing the Authors' Rhetorical Language Choices in The Federalist Papers |journal=Computers and the Humanities |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=15–36 |date=February 2004 |citeseerx=10.1.1.459.8655 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fung&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fung |first=Glenn |url=http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~gfung/federalist.pdf |title=The Disputed Federalist Papers: SVM Feature Selection via Concave Minimization |journal=Journal of the ACM |year=2003 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050417060742/http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~gfung/federalist.pdf |archivedate=2005-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on the ratification debates===
''The Federalist Papers'' were written to support the ratification of the Constitution, specifically in [[New York (state)|New York]]. Whether they succeeded in this mission is questionable. Separate ratification proceedings took place in each state, and the essays were not reliably reprinted outside of New York; furthermore, by the time the series was well underway, a number of important states had already ratified it, for instance Pennsylvania on December 12. New York held out until July 26; certainly ''The Federalist'' was more important there than anywhere else, but Furtwangler argues that it &quot;could hardly rival other major forces in the ratification contests&quot;—specifically, these forces included the personal influence of well-known Federalists, for instance Hamilton and Jay, and Anti-Federalists, including Governor [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Furt21&quot;&gt;Furtwangler, [{{GBurl|id=mfWGAAAAMAAJ|p=21}} p. 21].&lt;/ref&gt; Further, by the time New York came to a vote, ten states had already ratified the Constitution and it had thus already passed—only nine states had to ratify it for the new government to be established among them; the ratification by Virginia, the tenth state, placed pressure on New York to ratify. In light of that, Furtwangler observes, &quot;New York's refusal would make that state an odd outsider.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Furtwangler, [{{GBurl|id=mfWGAAAAMAAJ|p=22}} p. 22].&lt;/ref&gt;

Only 19 Federalists were elected to New York's ratification convention, compared to the Anti-Federalists' 46 delegates. While New York did indeed ratify the Constitution on July 26, the lack of public support for pro-Constitution Federalists has led historian John Kaminski to suggest that the impact of ''The Federalist'' on New York citizens was &quot;negligible&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coenen|first=Dan|title=Fifteen Curious Facts about The Federalist Papers|url=http://digitalcommons.law.uga.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=fac_pm|publisher=Media Commons|accessdate=2012-12-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115083653/http://digitalcommons.law.uga.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=fac_pm|archive-date=2013-01-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for Virginia, which ratified the Constitution only at its [[Virginia Ratifying Convention|convention]] on June 25, Hamilton writes in a letter to Madison that the collected edition of ''The Federalist'' had been sent to Virginia; Furtwangler presumes that it was to act as a &quot;debater's handbook for the convention there&quot;, though he claims that this indirect influence would be a &quot;dubious distinction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Furtwangler, [{{GBurl|id=mfWGAAAAMAAJ|p=23}} p. 23].&lt;/ref&gt; Probably of greater importance to the Virginia debate, in any case, were George Washington's support for the proposed Constitution and the presence of Madison and [[Edmund Randolph]], the governor, at the convention arguing for ratification.

==Structure and content==
In [[Federalist No. 1]], Hamilton listed six topics to be covered in the subsequent articles:
# &quot;The utility of the UNION to your political prosperity&quot; – covered in No. 2 through No. 14
# &quot;The insufficiency of the present Confederation to preserve that Union&quot; – covered in No. 15 through No. 22
# &quot;The necessity of a government at least equally energetic with the one proposed to the attainment of this object&quot; – covered in No. 23 through No. 36
# &quot;The conformity of the proposed constitution to the true principles of republican government&quot; – covered in No. 37 through No. 84
# &quot;Its analogy to your own state constitution&quot; – covered in No. 85
# &quot;The additional security which its adoption will afford to the preservation of that species of government, to liberty and to prosperity&quot; – covered in No. 85.&lt;ref&gt;This scheme of division is adapted from Charles K. Kesler's introduction to ''The Federalist Papers'' (New York: Signet Classic, 1999) pp. 15–17. A similar division is indicated by Furtwangler, [{{GBurl|id=mfWGAAAAMAAJ|p=57}} pp. 57–58].&lt;/ref&gt;

Furtwangler notes that as the series grew, this plan was somewhat changed. The fourth topic expanded into detailed coverage of the individual articles of the Constitution and the institutions it mandated, while the two last topics were merely touched on in the last essay.

The papers can be broken down by author as well as by topic. At the start of the series, all three authors were contributing; the first 20 papers are broken down as 11 by Hamilton, five by Madison and four by Jay. The rest of the series, however, is dominated by three long segments by a single writer: Nos. 21–36 by Hamilton, Nos. 37–58 by Madison, written while Hamilton was in Albany, and No. 65 through the end by Hamilton, published after Madison had left for Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Wills, 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to the Bill of Rights===
''The Federalist Papers'' (specifically [[Federalist No. 84]]) are notable for their opposition to what later became the [[United States Bill of Rights]]. The idea of adding a Bill of Rights to the Constitution was originally controversial because the Constitution, as written, did not specifically enumerate or protect the rights of the people, rather it listed the powers of the government and left all that remained to the states and the people. [[Alexander Hamilton]], the author of Federalist No. 84, feared that such an enumeration, once written down explicitly, would later be interpreted as a list of the ''only'' rights that people had.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

However, Hamilton's opposition to a Bill of Rights was far from universal. [[Robert Yates (politician)|Robert Yates]], writing under the pseudonym &quot;Brutus&quot;, articulated this view point in the so-called [[Anti-Federalist Papers|Anti-Federalist No. 84]], asserting that a government unrestrained by such a bill could easily devolve into tyranny. References in ''The Federalist'' and in the ratification debates warn of demagogues of the variety who through divisive appeals would aim at tyranny. ''The Federalist'' begins and ends with this issue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tulis1987&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Jeffrey |last=Tulis|title=The Rhetorical Presidency|url=https://archive.org/details/rhetoricalpresid0000tuli|url-access=registration |year=1987|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-02295-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/rhetoricalpresid0000tuli/page/30 30]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final paper Hamilton offers &quot;a lesson of moderation to all sincere lovers of the Union, and  ought to put them on their guard against hazarding anarchy, civil war, a perpetual alienation of the States from each other, and perhaps the military despotism of a successful demagogue&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Flaumenhaft, &quot;Hamilton's Administrative Republic and the American Presidency,&quot; in ''The Presidency in the Constitutional Order'', ed. Joseph M. Bessette and Jeffrey K. Tulis (Baton Rouge and London: Louisiana State University Press, 1981), 65–114.&lt;/ref&gt; The matter was further clarified by the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]].

==Judicial use==
Federal judges, when interpreting the Constitution, frequently use ''The Federalist Papers'' as a contemporary account of the intentions of the framers and ratifiers.&lt;ref&gt;Lupu, Ira C.; &quot;The Most-Cited Federalist Papers&quot;. ''Constitutional Commentary'' (1998) pp. 403+; using Supreme Court citations, the five most cited were [[Federalist No. 42]] (Madison) (33 decisions), [[Federalist No. 78]] (Hamilton) (30 decisions), [[Federalist No. 81]] (Hamilton) (27 decisions), [[Federalist No. 51]] (Madison) (26 decisions), [[Federalist No. 32]] (Hamilton) (25 decisions).&lt;/ref&gt; They have been applied on issues ranging from the power of the federal government in [[foreign affairs]] (in ''[[Hines v. Davidowitz]]'') to the validity of [[ex post facto]] laws (in the 1798 decision ''[[Calder v. Bull]]'', apparently the first decision to mention ''The Federalist'').&lt;ref&gt;See, among others, a very early exploration of the judicial use of ''The Federalist'' in Charles W. Pierson, &quot;The Federalist in the Supreme Court&quot;, The Yale Law Journal, Vol. 33, No. 7. (May 1924), pp. 728–35.&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2000|alt=By 2000}}, ''The Federalist'' had been quoted 291 times in Supreme Court decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Chernow, Ron. &quot;Alexander Hamilton&quot;. Penguin Books, 2004. (p. 260)&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of deference that should be given to ''The Federalist Papers'' in constitutional interpretation has always been somewhat controversial. As early as 1819, Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] noted in the famous case ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'', that &quot;the opinions expressed by the authors of that work have been justly supposed to be entitled to great respect in expounding the Constitution. No tribute can be paid to them which exceeds their merit; but in applying their opinions to the cases which may arise in the progress of our government, a right to judge of their correctness must be retained.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WordThatBind&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Arthur|first=John|title=Words That Bind: Judicial Review and the Grounds of Modern Constitutional Theory|publisher=Westview Press|year=1995|pages =[https://archive.org/details/wordsthatbindjud0000arth/page/41 41]|url=https://archive.org/details/wordsthatbindjud0000arth|url-access=registration|isbn =978-0-8133-2349-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to [[Thomas Ritchie (journalist)|Thomas Ritchie]] in 1821, James Madison stated that &quot;the legitimate meaning of the Instrument must be derived from the text itself; or if a key is to be sought elsewhere, it must be not in the opinions or intentions of the Body which planned &amp; proposed the Constitution, but in the sense attached to it by the people in their respective State Conventions where it recd. all the authority which it possesses.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Madison to Thomas Ritchie, September 15, 1821.

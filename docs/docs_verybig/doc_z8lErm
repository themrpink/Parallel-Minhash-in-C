TI entered the [[defense (military)|defense]] electronics market in 1942 with submarine detection equipment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/company/history.html#1940s |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 8, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710173533/http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/company/history.html#1940s |archive-date=July 10, 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the seismic exploration technology previously developed for the oil industry. The division responsible for these products was known at different times as the Laboratory &amp; Manufacturing Division, the Apparatus Division, the Equipment Group, and the Defense Systems &amp; Electronics Group (DSEG).

During the early 1980s, TI instituted a quality program which included [[Joseph M. Juran|Juran]] training, as well as promoting [[statistical process control]], [[Taguchi methods]], and [[Design for Six Sigma]]. In the late '80s, the company, along with [[Eastman Kodak]] and [[Allied Signal]], began involvement with [[Motorola]], institutionalizing Motorola's [[Six Sigma]] methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-32080915.html |title= Implementing Six Sigma at GE |year= 1998 |last1= Hendricks |first1= C.A. |last2= Kelbaugh |first2= R |journal= The Journal of Quality and Participation |volume= 21 |issue= 4 |pages= 48â€“53 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140714221856/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-32080915.html |archive-date= July 14, 2014 |df= mdy-all |access-date= July 2, 2014 }}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motorola, which originally developed the Six Sigma methodology, began this work in 1982.

;Infrared and radar systems

TI developed the AAA-4 [[infra-red search and track]]  in the late '50s and early '60s for the [[F-4B Phantom]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Sweetmanp526&quot;&gt;Sweetman 1987, p. 526.&lt;/ref&gt; for passive scanning of jet-engine emissions, but it possessed limited capabilities and was eliminated on F-4Ds and later models.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sweetmanp552&quot;&gt;Sweetman 1987, p. 552.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, TI began research on [[infrared]] technology that led to several line scanner contracts and with the addition of a second scan mirror the invention of the first [[forward looking infrared]] (FLIR) in 1963 with production beginning in 1966. In 1972, TI invented the common module FLIR&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/company/history/timeline/defense/1970/docs/72-common-module.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 27, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311022517/http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/company/history/timeline/defense/1970/docs/72-common-module.htm |archive-date=March 11, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; concept, greatly reducing cost and allowing reuse of common components.

TI went on to produce side-looking radar systems, the first [[terrain following radar|terrain-following radar]] and surveillance radar systems for both the military and FAA. TI demonstrated the first solid-state radar called Molecular Electronics for Radar Applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/company/history/timeline/defense/1960/docs/66-mera.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 27, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311022236/http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/company/history/timeline/defense/1960/docs/66-mera.htm |archive-date=March 11, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, TI developed a [[microwave landing system]] prototype. In 1984, TI developed the first [[inverse synthetic aperture radar]]. The first single-chip [[gallium arsenide]] radar module was developed. In 1991, the military microwave integrated circuit&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/company/history/timeline/defense/1990/docs/91-raytheon_microwave.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 27, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311022430/http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/company/history/timeline/defense/1990/docs/91-raytheon_microwave.htm |archive-date=March 11, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; program was initiated{{snd}} a joint effort with Raytheon.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

;Missiles and laser-guided bombs

In 1961, TI won the guidance and control system contract for the defense suppression [[AGM-45 Shrike]] [[antiradiation missile]]. This led later to the prime on the [[AGM-88 HARM|high-speed antiradiation missile]] (AGM-88 HARM) development contract in 1974 and production in 1981.

In 1964, TI began development of the first laser guidance system for [[precision-guided munition]]s, leading to the [[Paveway]] series of [[laser-guided bomb]]s (LGBs). The first LGB was the [[BOLT-117]].

In 1969, TI won the Harpoon (missile) Seeker contract. In 1986, TI won the Army [[FGM-148 Javelin]] [[fire-and-forget]] man portable antitank guided missile in a joint venture with [[Martin Marietta]]. In 1991, TI was awarded the contract for the [[AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon]].

;Military computers

Because of TI's research and development of military temperature-range silicon transistors and integrated circuits (ICs), TI won contracts for the first IC-based computer for the U.S. Air Force in 1961 (molecular electronic computer)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102646283|title=Molecular Electronic Computer brochure {{!}} 102646283 {{!}} Computer History Museum|website=www.computerhistory.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-13|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314042854/http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102646283|archive-date=March 14, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for ICs for the Minuteman Missile the following year. In 1968, TI developed the data systems for [[Mariner Program]]. In 1991 TI won the F-22 Radar and Computer development contract.

;Divestiture to Raytheon

As the defense industry consolidated, TI sold its defense business to [[Raytheon]] in 1997 for $2.95 billion. The Department of Justice required that Raytheon divest the TI [[Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit]] (MMIC) operations after closing the transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_July_2/ai_19556280 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710173652/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_July_2/ai_19556280 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 10, 2012 |title=Raytheon announces Justice Department approval of Texas Instruments acquisition |date=July 2, 1997 |work=Business Wire }}&lt;/ref&gt; The TI MMIC business accounted for less than $40 million in 1996 revenues, or roughly 2% of the $1.8 billion in total TI defense revenues, and was sold to [[TriQuint Semiconductor]], Inc. Raytheon retained its own existing [[MMIC]] capabilities and has the right to license TI's MMIC technology for use in future product applications from TriQuint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1998_Jan_9/ai_20124279 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120707231044/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1998_Jan_9/ai_20124279 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 7, 2012 |title=Raytheon Company Announces Sale of MMIC Operations Acquired from Texas Instruments |date=January 9, 1998 |work=Business Wire }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after Raytheon acquired TI DSEG, Raytheon then acquired [[Hughes Aircraft]] from [[General Motors]]. Raytheon then owned TI's [[mercury cadmium telluride]] detector business and [[infrared]] (IR) systems group. In California, it also had Hughes infrared detector and an IR systems business. When again the US government forced Raytheon to divest itself of a duplicate capability, the company kept the TI IR systems business and the Hughes detector business. As a result of these acquisitions, these former arch rivals of TI systems and Hughes detectors work together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laserfocusworld.com/display_article/43028/12/none/none/Dept/Why-the-IR-detectormarket-is-in-flux Why the IR detectormarket is in flux] Retrieved on October 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after acquisition, DSEG was known as Raytheon TI Systems (RTIS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/redirect/raytheon.htm Raytheon TI Systems{{snd}} important information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109194345/http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/redirect/raytheon.htm |date=November 9, 2006 }}. Ti.com. Retrieved on April 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It is now fully integrated into Raytheon and this designation no longer exists.

===Artificial intelligence===
TI was active in the area of [[artificial intelligence]] in the 1980s. In addition to ongoing developments in speech and signal processing and recognition, it developed and sold the [[TI Explorer|Explorer]] computer family of [[Lisp machine]]s. For the Explorer, a special 32-bit Lisp microprocessor was developed, which was used in the Explorer II and the TI MicroExplorer (a Lisp Machine on a [[NuBus]] board for the Apple [[Macintosh]]). AI application software developed by TI for the Explorer included the gate assignment system for United Airlines, [http://articles.latimes.com/1989-11-07/business/fi-1112_1_expert-system described as] &quot;an artificial intelligence program that captures the combined experience and knowledge of a half-dozen United operations experts.&quot;  In software for the PC, they introduced &quot;Personal Consultant&quot;, a rule-based [[expert system]] development tool and runtime engine, followed by &quot;Personal Consultant Plus&quot; written in the Lisp-like language from MIT known as [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], and the natural language menu system NLMenu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ti.com.cn/sc/docs/watson.htm|title=Texas Instruments|website=www.ti.com.cn|access-date=2016-07-26|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817012717/http://www.ti.com.cn/sc/docs/watson.htm|archive-date=August 17, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensors and controls===
TI was a major [[Original equipment manufacturer|original-equipment manufacturer]] of [[sensor]], control, protection, and [[RFID]] products for the automotive, appliance, aircraft, and other industries. The Sensors &amp; Controls division was headquartered in [[Attleboro, Massachusetts]].

By the mid-1980's, industrial computers known as PLC's (programmable logic controllers) were separated from Sensors &amp; Controls as the Industrial Systems Division, which was sold in the late 1980's to Siemens.

In 2006, [[Bain Capital LLC]], a private equity firm, purchased the Sensors &amp; Controls division for $3.0 billion in cash.&lt;ref&gt;

===Software===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Texas Instruments Software]] --&gt;
In 1997, TI sold its software division, along with its main products such as the [[CA Gen]], to [[Sterling Software]], which is now part of [[Computer Associates]]. However, TI still owns small pieces of software, such as the software for calculators such as the  [[TI Interactive!]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://education.ti.com/en/ee/products/accessories-and-computer-software/ti-interactive/features/features-summary|title=TI InterActive!â„¢ - Features Summary Texas Instruments - Eastern Europe|website=education.ti.com|access-date=2016-07-26|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815144639/https://education.ti.com/en/ee/products/accessories-and-computer-software/ti-interactive/features/features-summary|archive-date=August 15, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; TI also creates a significant amount of target software for its digital signal processors, along with host-based tools for creating DSP applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ti.com/lsds/ti/processors/dsp/tools_software.page|title=DSP {{!}} Tools &amp; Software {{!}} Processors {{!}} TI.com|website=www.ti.com|access-date=2016-07-26|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160721025926/http://www.ti.com/lsds/ti/processors/dsp/tools_software.page|archive-date=July 21, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buying products on TI.com (ecommerce)===
In 2000, Texas Instruments first implemented an e-commerce platform on TI.com as a way to sell its Code Composer Studioâ„¢ software tool directly to customers. With TI.com, purchase managers and design engineers have access to TI products that are immediately available for shipping. The platform has grown to include tens of thousands of TI analog and embedded processing products. In 2020, TI added several features, including full and custom quantity reels, multiple payment options, lines of credit, and flat-rate shipping.

===Restatement===
On August 6, 1999, TI announced the restatement of its results for parts of 1998 and the first quarter of 1999 after a review by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] over the timing of charges for a plant closing and writedown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dowjones.com/info/business-news.asp |title=Texas Instruments Restates Statements After SEC Review |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906000656/http://www.dowjones.com/info/business-news.asp |archive-date=September 6, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Finances ==
For the fiscal year 2017, Texas Instruments reported earnings of US$3.682 billion, with an annual revenue of US$14.961 billion, an increase of 11.9% over the previous fiscal cycle. TI shares traded at over $82 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$88.0 billion in October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/investor_relations/annual_reports.html#|title=Annual Reports}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, TI ranked 192nd on the [[Fortune 500]] list of the largest United States corporations by revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://fortune.com/fortune500/list |title=Fortune 500 Companies 2018: Who Made the List |website=Fortune |language=en-US |access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divisions==
Today, TI is made up of four divisions: analog products, embedded processors, digital light processing, and educational technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;ti.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/company/technology_innovation.html|title=About TI â€“ Technology and innovation â€“ TI.com|website=www.ti.com|access-date=2016-07-25|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712074240/http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/company/technology_innovation.html|archive-date=July 12, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other businesses===
TI's remaining businesses consisting of DLP products (primarily used in projectors to create high-definition images), calculators and certain custom semiconductors known as application-specific integrated circuits.

====DLP Products ====
[[File:Texas Instruments, DLP Cinema Prototype System, Mark V, Paris, 2000 - Philippe Binant Archives.jpg|thumb|Texas Instruments, DLP Cinema Prototype Projector, Mark V, 2000]]
DLP is a trademark under which Texas Instruments sells technology regarding TVs, video projectors, and [[digital cinema]].  On February 2, 2000, Philippe Binant, technical manager of Digital Cinema Project at [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]] in France, realized the first digital cinema projection in Europe with the DLP CINEMA technology developed by TI. DLP technology enables a diverse range of display and advanced light control applications spanning industrial, enterprise, automotive, and consumer market segments.

;Custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs)

The ASICs business develops more complex integrated-circuit solutions for clients on a custom basis.

====Educational technology====
TI has produced educational toys for children, including the [[Little Professor]] in 1976 and [[Dataman]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=James Floyd|last1=Kelly|accessdate=2020-02-25|title=Super Bonus GeekDad Retro Gaming: DataMan|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/07/super-bonus-geekdad-retro-gaming-dataman/|newspaper=Wired|date=5 July 2011|issn=1059-1028|via=www.wired.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Benj|last1=Edwards|accessdate=2020-02-25|title=The Golden Age of Texas Instruments Consumer Gadgets|url=https://uk.pcmag.com/electronics/86393/the-golden-age-of-texas-instruments-consumer-gadgets|date=1 December 2016|website=PCMag UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TI produces a range of calculators, with the [[TI-30]] being one of the most popular early [[calculator]]s. TI has also developed a line of [[graphing calculator]]s, the first being the [[TI-81]], and most popular being the [[TI-83 Plus]] (with the [[TI-84 Plus]] being an updated equivalent).

Many TI calculators are still sold without graphing capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.ti.com Education.ti.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020802005902/http://education.ti.com/ |date=August 2, 2002 }}. Education.ti.com. Retrieved on April 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The TI-30 has been replaced by the [[TI-30|TI-30X IIS]]. Also, some financial calculators are for sale on the TI website.

In 2007, TI released the [[TI-Nspire]] family of calculators and computer software that has similar capabilities to the calculators.

Less than 3% of Texas Instrumentsâ€™ overall revenue comes from calculators, part of the $1.43 billion revenue in the &quot;Other&quot; section in the company's 2018 annual report. Nevertheless, the calculators are a lucrative product. For example, estimates have a $15 to $20 cost to produce TI-84 Plus which likely has a profit margin of at least 50%.

Throughout the 1980s, Texas Instruments worked closely with National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) to develop a calculator to become the educational standard. In 1986, Connecticut School Board became the first to require a graphing calculator on state-mandated exams. Chicago Public Schools gave a free calculator to every student, beginning in the fourth grade, in 1988. New York required the calculator in 1992 for its Regents exams after first allowing it the previous year. The College Board  required calculators on the Advanced Placement tests in 1993 and allowed calculators on the SAT a year later. Texas Instruments provides free services to the College Board, which administers AP tests and the SAT, and also has a group called Teachers Teaching for Technology (T3), which educates teachers on how to use its calculators.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIcalcsMedium&quot; /&gt;

=====TI calculator community=====
In the 1990s, with the advent of TI's graphing calculator series, programming became popular among some students. The TI-8x series of calculators (beginning with the TI-81) came with a built-in [[BASIC]] interpreter, through which simple programs could be created. The [[TI-85]] was the first TI calculator to allow [[assembly language|assembly]] programming (via a shell called &quot;ZShell&quot;), and the TI-83 was the first in the series to receive native assembly.

Around the same time that these programs were first being written, personal [[web page]]s were becoming popular (through services such as [[Angelfire]] and [[GeoCities]]), and programmers began creating websites to host their work, along with tutorials and other calculator-relevant information. This led to the formation of TI calculator [[webrings]] and eventually a few large communities, including the now-defunct TI-Files and still-active ticalc.org.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ticalc.org Ticalc.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060611080128/http://www.ticalc.org/ |date=June 11, 2006 }}. Ticalc.org. Retrieved on April 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The TI community reached the height of its popularity in the early 2000s, with new websites and programming groups being started almost daily. In fact, the aforementioned community sites were exploding with activity, with close to 100 programs being uploaded daily by users of the sites. Also, a competition existed between both sites to be the top site in the community, which helped increase interest and activity in the community.

One of the common unifying forces that has united the community over the years has been the rather contentious relationship with TI regarding control over its graphing calculators. TI graphing calculators generally fall into two distinct groupsâ€”those powered by the [[Zilog Z80]] and those running on the [[Motorola 68000]] series. Both lines of calculators are locked by TI with checks in the hardware and through the signing of software to disable use of custom flash applications and operating systems.

However, users employed the [[general number field sieve]] to find the keys and publish them in 2009. TI responded by sending invalid [[DMCA]] [[takedown notice]]s, causing the [[Texas Instruments signing key controversy]]. Enthusiasts had already been creating their own operating systems before the finding of the keys, which could be installed with other methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/420/42048.html Ticalc.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604163757/http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/420/42048.html |date=June 4, 2011 }}.

A  '''parachute''' is a device used to slow the motion of an object through an [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]] by creating [[Drag (physics)|drag]] (or in the case of ram-air parachutes, aerodynamic [[Lift (force)|lift]]). Parachutes are usually made out of light, strong fabric, originally [[silk]], now most commonly [[nylon]].  They are typically dome-shaped, but vary, with rectangles, inverted domes, and others found. A variety of loads are attached to parachutes, including people, food, equipment, [[space capsule]]s, and [[Bomb#Delivery|bombs]].

A '''[[drogue parachute|drogue chute]]''' is used to aid horizontal deceleration of a vehicle including [[fixed-wing aircraft]] and [[drag racing|drag racers]], provide stability, as to assist certain types of [[light aircraft]] in distress,&lt;ref&gt;Ballistic recovery systems {{US patent|4607814 A}}, Boris Popov, August 26, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael |last=Klesius |url=http://www.airspacemag.com/flight-today/How-Things-Work-Whole-Airplane-Parachute.html |title=How Things Work: Whole-Airplane Parachute |work=Air &amp; Space |date=January 2011

=== Middle Ages ===
In 852, in [[Córdoba, Spain]], the Moorish man [[Armen Firman]] attempted unsuccessfully to fly by jumping from a tower while wearing a large cloak. It was recorded that &quot;there was enough air in the folds of his cloak to prevent great injury when he reached the ground.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Moolman|first=Valerie|title=The Road to Kitty Hawk|publisher=[[Time-Life Books]]|year=1980|isbn=9780809432608|location=New York|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early Renaissance ===
[[File:Conical Parachute, 1470s, British Museum Add. MSS 34,113, fol. 200v.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The oldest known depiction of a parachute, by an anonymous author (Italy, 1470s)]]

The earliest evidence for the true parachute dates back to the [[Renaissance]] period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynn White 1968, 466&quot;&gt;{{harnvb|White|1968|p=466}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest parachute design appears in an anonymous manuscript from 1470s [[Renaissance Italy]] (British Library, Add MS 34113, fol. 200v), showing a free-hanging man clutching a crossbar frame attached to a conical canopy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynn White 1968, 462f.&quot;&gt;{{harnvb|White|1968|pp=462f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a safety measure, four straps ran from the ends of the rods to a waist belt. The design is a marked improvement over another folio (189v), which depicts a man trying to break the force of his fall by the means of two long cloth streamers fastened to two bars which he grips with his hands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynn White 1968, 465&quot;&gt;{{harnvb|White|1968|p=465}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the surface area of the parachute design appears to be too small to offer effective air resistance and the wooden base-frame is superfluous and potentially harmful, the basic concept of a working parachute is apparent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynn White 1968, 465&quot;/&gt;

Shortly after, a more sophisticated parachute was sketched by the [[polymath]] [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in his ''[[Codex Atlanticus]]'' (fol. 381v) dated to ca. 1485.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynn White 1968, 462f.&quot;/&gt; Here, the scale of the parachute is in a more favorable proportion to the weight of the jumper. Leonardo's canopy was held open by a square wooden frame, which alters the shape of the parachute from conical to pyramidal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynn White 1968, 465&quot;/&gt; It is not known whether the Italian inventor was influenced by the earlier design, but he may have learned about the idea through the intensive oral communication among [[Renaissance technology|artist-engineers of the time]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynn White 1968, 465f.&quot;&gt;{{harnvb|White|1968|pp=465f.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|surname1=[[Marc van den Broek]]|title=Leonardo da Vinci Spirits of Invention.

The [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] polymath and inventor [[Fausto Veranzio]] (1551–1617) examined da Vinci's parachute sketch and kept the square frame but replaced the canopy with a bulging sail-like piece of cloth that he came to realize decelerates a fall more effectively.&lt;ref name=&quot; Lynn White 1968, 465&quot;/&gt; A now-famous depiction of a parachute that he dubbed ''Homo Volans'' (Flying Man), showing a man parachuting from a tower, presumably [[St Mark's Campanile]] in [[Venice]], appeared in his book on mechanics, ''Machinae Novae'' (&quot;New Machines&quot;, published in 1615 or 1616), alongside a number of other devices and technical concepts.&lt;ref name=&quot;World in Air&quot;&gt;Francis Trevelyan Miller, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MdDNAAAAMAAJ The world in the air: the story of flying in pictures], G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1930, pages 101–106&lt;/ref&gt;

It was once widely believed that in 1617, Veranzio, then aged 65 and seriously ill, implemented his design and tested the parachute by jumping from St Mark's Campanile,&lt;ref name=&quot;Paratroops&quot;&gt;[https://archive.org/details/HesInTheParatroopsNow ''He's in the paratroops now''], Alfred Day Rathbone, R.M.

[[File: First parachute2.jpg|thumb|upright|Schematic depiction of Garnerin's parachute, from an early nineteenth-century illustration.]]
The modern parachute was invented in the late 18th century by [[Louis-Sébastien Lenormand]] in [[France]], who made the first recorded public jump in 1783. Lenormand also sketched his device beforehand.

Two years later, in 1785, Lenormand coined the word &quot;parachute&quot; by hybridizing an Italian prefix ''para'', an imperative form of ''parare'' = to avert, defend, resist, guard, shield or shroud,  from ''paro'' = to parry, and ''chute'', the French word for ''fall'', to describe the aeronautical device's real function.

Also in 1785, [[Jean-Pierre Blanchard]] demonstrated it as a means of safely disembarking from a [[hot-air balloon]]. While Blanchard's first parachute demonstrations were conducted with a dog as the passenger, he later claimed to have had the opportunity to try it himself in 1793 when his hot air balloon ruptured and he used a parachute to descend. (This event was not witnessed by others).

Subsequent development of the parachute focused on it becoming more compact. While the early parachutes were made of [[linen]] stretched over a wooden frame, in the late 1790s, Blanchard began making parachutes from folded [[silk]], taking advantage of silk's strength and light [[weight]]. In 1797, [[André Garnerin]] made the first descent of a &quot;frameless&quot; parachute covered in silk.&lt;ref name=&quot;soden&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Soden| first = Garrett| title = Defying Gravity: Land Divers, Roller Coasters, Gravity Bums, and the Human Obsession with Falling| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=B4K0rfx_E_kC&amp;pg=PA18| year = 2005| publisher = W.

When Broadwick jumped from the balloon, the static line became taut, pulled the parachute from the pack, and then snapped.&lt;ref name=&quot;airspace2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

In 1911 a successful test took place with a [[Crash test dummy|dummy]] at the [[Eiffel tower]] in [[Paris]]. The puppet's weight was {{convert|75|kg|abbr=on}}; the parachute's weight was {{convert|21|kg|abbr=on}}.

Also in 1911, [[Grant Morton]] made the first parachute jump from an [[airplane]], a [[Wright Model B]] piloted by [[Phil Parmalee]], at [[Venice Beach]], [[California]]. Morton's device was of the &quot;throw-out&quot; type where he held the parachute in his arms as he left the aircraft. In the same year&lt;!--1911--&gt;, Russian [[Gleb Kotelnikov]] invented the first knapsack parachute,&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; although [[Hermann Lattemann]] and his wife [[Katharina Paulus|Käthe Paulus]] had been jumping with bagged parachutes in the last decade of the 19th century.

In 1912, on a road near [[Tsarskoye Selo]], years before it became part of [[St. Petersburg]], Kotelnikov successfully demonstrated the braking effects of a parachute by accelerating a [[Russo-Balt]] automobile to its top speed and then opening a parachute attached to the back seat, thus also inventing the [[drogue parachute]].&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;[http://www.bibliotekar.ru/divo/40-22.htm Parachuting] at the site Divo: The Russian Book of records and achievements {{in lang|ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The jump utilized a knapsack style parachute stored or housed in a casing on the jumper's body.

===World War I===
[[File: Photography Q27506.jpg|thumb|Kite balloon observers preparing to descend by parachute.]]
The first military use of the parachute was by [[artillery observer]]s on tethered [[observation balloons]] in [[World War I]]. These were tempting targets for enemy [[fighter aircraft]], though difficult to destroy, due to their heavy [[anti-aircraft]] defenses. Because it was difficult to escape from them, and dangerous when on fire due to their hydrogen inflation, observers would abandon them and descend by parachute as soon as enemy aircraft were seen. The ground crew would then attempt to retrieve and deflate the balloon as quickly as possible. The main part of the parachute was in a bag suspended from the balloon with the pilot wearing only a simple waist harness attached to the main parachute. When the balloon crew jumped the main part of the parachute was pulled from the bag by the crew's waist harness, first the shroud lines, followed by the main canopy. This type of parachute was first adopted on a large scale for their observation balloon crews by the Germans, and then later by the British and French. While this type of unit worked well from balloons, it had mixed results when used on fixed-wing aircraft by the Germans, where the bag was stored in a compartment directly behind the pilot. In many instances where it did not work the shroud lines became entangled with the spinning aircraft. Although a number of famous German fighter pilots were saved by this type of parachute, including [[Hermann Göring]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=n-MDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA809 May 1931, ''Popular Mechanics''] photo of observation balloon gondola with external bag parachutes used by British Royal Navy&lt;/ref&gt; no parachutes were issued to the crews of Allied &quot;[[heavier-than-air]]&quot; aircraft, since it was thought that if a pilot had a parachute he would jump from the plane when hit rather than trying to save the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lee |first=Arthur Gould |title=No parachute |location=London |publisher=Jarrolds |year=1968 |isbn=0-09-086590-1 }} (?); [[Harper &amp; Row]] 1970, {{ISBN|978-0060125486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Airplane cockpits at that time also were not large enough to accommodate a pilot and a parachute, since a seat that would fit a pilot wearing a parachute would be too large for a pilot not wearing one. This is why the German type was stowed in the fuselage, rather than being of the &quot;backpack&quot; type. Weight was – at the very beginning – also a consideration since planes had limited load capacity. Carrying a parachute impeded performance and reduced the useful offensive and fuel load.

In the UK, [[Everard Calthrop]], a railway engineer and breeder of Arab horses, invented and marketed through his Aerial Patents Company a &quot;British Parachute&quot; and the &quot;Guardian Angel&quot; parachute. [[Thomas Orde-Lees]], known as the &quot;Mad Major,&quot; demonstrated that parachutes could be used successfully from a low height (he jumped from Tower Bridge in London)&lt;ref name=&quot;ant2005&quot;&gt;[http://www.antarctic.org.nz/pdf/Antarctic/Antarctic.V23.4.2005.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121220349/http://antarctic.org.nz/pdf/Antarctic/Antarctic.V23.4.2005.pdf |date=January 21, 2016 }}, page 68, &quot;The Journal of the New Zealand Antarctic Society&quot; Vol 23, No. 4, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/documents/Research/RAF-Historical-Society-Journals/Journal-37-Seminar-Flight%20Safety.pdf &quot;ROYAL AIR FORCE HISTORICAL SOCIETY JOURNAL, #37&quot;], 2006, Page 28&lt;/ref&gt; which led to parachutes being used by the balloonists of the [[Royal Flying Corps]], though they were not available for aircraft.

In 1911, [[Solomon Lee Van Meter, Jr.]] of Lexington Kentucky, submitted for and in July 1916 received a patent for a backpack style parachute – the Aviatory Life Buoy.&lt;ref&gt;Aviatory Life Buoy, {{US patent|1192479}}, July 25, 1916, awarded to inventor Solomon Lee Van Meter, Jr.&lt;/ref&gt; His self-contained device featured a revolutionary quick-release mechanism – the ripcord – that allowed a falling aviator to expand the canopy only when safely away from the disabled aircraft.&lt;ref name=ket&gt;[http://www.ket.org/trips/aviation/vanmeter.htm Kentucky Aviation Pioneers – Solomon Lee Van Meter, Jr. (1888–1937)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706200110/http://www.ket.org/trips/aviation/vanmeter.htm |date=July 6, 2010 }}, KET Aviation Museum Of Kentucky&lt;/ref&gt;

Otto Heinecke, a German airship ground crewman, designed a parachute which the German air service introduced in 1918, becoming the world's first air service to introduce a standard parachute. Although many pilots were saved by these, their efficacy was relatively poor. Out of the first 70 German airmen to bail out, around a third died,&lt;ref name=MilHistMagHeinecke&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Guttman|first=Jon|title=Heinecke Parachute: A Leap of Faith for WWI German Airmen|magazine=Military History Magazine|date=May 2012|page=23|url=http://www.historynet.com/heinecke-parachute-a-leap-of-faith-for-wwi-german-airmen.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; including aces such as Oberleutnant [[Erich Löwenhardt]] (who fell from {{convert|3600|m|ft}} after being accidentally rammed by another German aircraft) and Fritz Rumey who tested it in 1918, only to have it fail at a little over {{convert|900|m|ft|abbr=on}}. These fatalities were mostly due to the chute or ripcord becoming entangled in the airframe of their spinning aircraft or because of harness failure, a problem fixed in later versions.&lt;ref name=&quot;MilHistMagHeinecke&quot;/&gt;

The French, British, American and Italian air services later based their first parachute designs on the Heinecke parachute to varying extents.&lt;ref name=SMilHistJournal&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mahncke|first=J O E O|title=Early Parachutes, An evaluation of the use of parachutes, with special emphasis on the Royal Flying Corps and the German Lufstreitkräfte, until 1918|journal=South African Military History Journal|date=December 2000|volume=11|issue=6|url=http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol116jm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK [[Sir Frank Mears]] who was serving as a Major in the [[Royal Flying Corps]] in France (Kite Balloon section) registered a patent in July 1918 for a parachute with a quick release buckle, known as the &quot;Mears parachute&quot; which was in common use from then onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/Details?uri=C2987551|title=The Discovery Service|first=The National|last=Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-World War I===
The experience with parachutes during the war highlighted the need to develop a design that could be reliably used to exit a disabled airplane. For instance, tethered parachutes did not work well when the aircraft was spinning. After the war, Major Edward L. Hoffman of the [[United States Army]] led an effort to develop an improved parachute by bringing together the best elements of multiple parachute designs.  Participants in the effort included [[Leslie Irvin (parachutist)|Leslie Irvin]] and [[James Floyd Smith]]. The team eventually created the Airplane Parachute Type-A. This incorporated three key elements.
* storing the parachute in a soft pack worn on the back, as demonstrated by [[Charles Broadwick]] in 1906;
* a [[Ripcord (skydiving)|ripcord]] for manually deploying the parachute at a safe distance from the airplane, from a design by [[Albert Leo Stevens]]; and 
* a [[pilot chute]] that draws the main canopy from the pack.

In 1919, Irvin successfully tested the parachute by jumping from an airplane. The Type-A parachute was put into production and over time saved a number of lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;airspace2010&quot;/&gt;  The effort was recognized by the awarding of the [[Robert J. Collier Trophy]] to Major Edward L.

Irvin became the first person to make a premeditated free-fall parachute jump from an airplane. An early brochure of the Irvin Air Chute Company credits William O'Connor as having become, on August 24, 1920, at [[McCook Field]] near [[Dayton, Ohio]], the first person to be saved by an Irvin parachute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ralph S. |last=Cooper |url=http://home.earthlink.net/~ralphcooper/pimagz17.htm |title=The Irvin Parachute, 1924 |publisher=Earthlink.net |access-date=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another life-saving jump was made at McCook Field by test pilot Lt. Harold H. Harris on October 20, 1922. Shortly after Harris' jump, two Dayton newspaper reporters suggested the creation of the [[Caterpillar Club]] for successful parachute jumps from disabled aircraft.

On July 4, 1924 (patent No.1607) [[Gleb Kotelnikov]] of Russia became the first parachutist to apply the soft packing of a parachute instead of a hard casing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yazib.org/yb030604.html Russian parachute of Kotelnikov] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201093954/http://yazib.org/yb030604.html |date=December 1, 2010 }} {{in lang|ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with [[Italy]] in 1927, several countries experimented with using parachutes to [[paratroopers|drop soldiers behind enemy lines]]. The regular [[Soviet Airborne Troops]] were established as early as 1931 after a number of experimental military mass jumps starting from August 2, 1930.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; Earlier the same year, the first Soviet mass jumps led to the development of the parachuting sport in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=&quot; history&quot;/&gt; By the time of [[World War II]], large [[airborne forces]] were trained and used in surprise attacks, as in the battles for [[Battle of Fort Eben-Emael|Fort Eben-Emael]] and [[Battle for The Hague|The Hague]], the first large-scale, opposed landings of paratroopers in military history, by the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Dr L. de Jong, 'Het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden in de Tweede Wereldoorlog', (Dutch language) part 3, RIOD, Amsterdam, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed later in the war by airborne assaults on a larger scale, such as the [[Battle of Crete]] and [[Operation Market Garden]], the latter being the largest airborne military operation ever.&lt;ref&gt;Dr L. de Jong, 'Het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden in de Tweede Wereldoorlog', (Dutch language) part 10a-II, RIOD, Amsterdam, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Aircraft crew were routinely equipped with parachutes for emergencies as well.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In 1937, [[drag chute]]s were used in aviation for the first time, by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] airplanes in the [[Arctic]] that were providing support for the polar expeditions of the era, such as the first [[drifting ice station]] [[North Pole-1]]. The drag chute allowed airplanes to land safely on smaller [[drift ice|ice-floes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

== Types ==
Today's modern parachutes are classified into two categories – ascending and descending canopies.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}  All ascending canopies refer to [[paraglider]]s, built specifically to ascend and stay aloft as long as possible.  Other parachutes, including ram-air non-elliptical, are classified as descending canopies by manufacturers.

Some modern parachutes are classified as semi-rigid wings, which are maneuverable and can make a controlled descent to collapse on impact with the ground.

=== Round ===
[[File:USMC Paratrooper.jpg|thumb|upright|An American [[paratrooper]] using an MC1-1C series &quot;round&quot; parachute.]]
Round parachutes are purely a drag device (that is, unlike the ram-air types, they provide no [[lift (force)|lift]]) and are used in military, emergency and cargo applications (e.g. [[airdrop]]s).  Most have large dome-shaped canopies made from a single layer of triangular cloth [[Gore (segment)|gores]].  Some skydivers call them &quot;jellyfish 'chutes&quot; because of the resemblance to the marine organisms. Modern sports parachutists rarely use this type.
The first round parachutes were simple, flat circulars. These early parachutes suffered from instability caused by oscillations.  A hole in the apex helped to vent some air and reduce the oscillations.  Many military applications adopted conical, ''i.e.'', cone-shaped, or parabolic (a flat circular canopy with an extended skirt) shapes, such as the United States Army [[T-10 parachute|T-10]] static-line parachute. A round parachute with no holes in it is more prone to oscillate and is not considered to be steerable. Some parachutes have inverted dome-shaped canopies. These are primarily used for dropping non-human payloads due to their faster rate of descent.

Forward speed (5–13&amp;nbsp; km/h) and steering can be achieved by cuts in various sections (gores) across the back, or by cutting four lines in the back thereby modifying the canopy shape to allow air to escape from the back of the canopy, providing limited forward speed. Other modifications sometimes used are cuts in various sections (gores) to cause some of the skirt to bow out.  Turning is accomplished by forming the edges of the modifications, giving the parachute more speed from one side of the modification than the other. This gives the jumpers the ability to steer the parachute (such as the United States Army MC series parachutes), enabling them to avoid obstacles and to turn into the wind to minimize horizontal speed at [[landing]].

=== Cruciform  ===
The unique design characteristics of cruciform parachutes decrease oscillation (its user swinging back and forth) and violent turns during descent.  This technology will be used by the United States Army as it replaces its older T-10 parachutes with [[T-11 parachute]]s under a program called Advanced Tactical Parachute System (ATPS).  The ATPS canopy is a highly modified version of a cross/ cruciform platform and is square in appearance. The ATPS system will reduce the rate of descent by 30 percent from {{convert|21|ft/s|m/s}} to {{convert|15.75|ft/s|m/s}}. The T-11 is designed to have an average rate of descent 14% slower than the T-10D, thus resulting in lower landing injury rates for jumpers. The decline in the rate of descent will reduce the impact energy by almost 25% to lessen the potential for injury.

=== Pull-down apex ===

A variation on the round parachute is the pull-down apex parachute, invented by a Frenchman named Pierre-Marcel Lemoigne.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Marcel Lemoigne, {{US patent|3228636}} (filed: November 7, 1963; issued: January 11, 1966).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jean-Michel |last=Palau |url=http://jmp-pan.blogspot.com/2008/02/historique-du-parachutisme-ascensionnel_988.html |title=Historique du Parachutisme Ascensionnel Nautique |date=February 20, 2008 |access-date=October 22, 2013 |publisher=Le Parachutisme Ascensionnel Nautique |language=fr}} Includes '''photo''' of Lemoigne.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also:  Theodor W. Knacke, &quot;Technical-historical development of parachutes and their applications since World War I (Technical paper A87-13776 03-03),&quot; 9th Aerodynamic Decelerator and Balloon Technology Conference (Albuquerque, New Mexico; October 7–9, 1986) (New York, N.Y.:  American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 1986), pages 1–10.&lt;/ref&gt; The first widely used canopy of this type was called the ''Para-Commander'' (made by the Pioneer Parachute Co.), although there are many other canopies with a pull-down apex produced in the years thereafter - these had minor differences in attempts to make a higher performance rig, such as different venting configurations. They are all considered 'round' parachutes, but with suspension lines to the canopy apex that apply load there and pull the apex closer to the load, distorting the round shape into a somewhat flattened or lenticular shape when viewed from the side.  And while called ''rounds'', they generally have an elliptical shape when viewed from above or below, with the sides bulging out more than the for'd-and-aft dimension, the chord (see the lower photo to the right and you likely can ascertain the difference).

Due to their lenticular shape and appropriate venting, they have a considerably faster forward speed than, say, a modified military canopy. And due to controllable rear-facing vents in the canopy's sides, they also have much snappier turning capabilities, though they are decidedly low-performance compared to today's ram-air rigs.  From about the mid-1960s to the late-1970s, this was the most popular parachute design type for sport parachuting (prior to this period, modified military 'rounds' were generally used and after, ram-air 'squares' became common). Note that the use of the word ''elliptical'' for these 'round' parachutes is somewhat dated and may cause slight confusion, since some 'squares' (i.e. ram-airs) are elliptical nowadays, too.

=== Annular ===

Some designs with a pull-down apex have the fabric removed from the apex to open a hole through which air can exit (most, if not all, round canopies have at least a small hole to allow easier tie-down for packing - these aren't considered annular), giving the canopy an annular geometry. This hole can be very pronounced in some designs, taking up more 'space' than the parachute. They also have decreased horizontal drag due to their flatter shape and, when combined with rear-facing vents, can have considerable forward speed.  Truly annular designs - with a hole large enough that the canopy can be classified as ''ring-shaped'' - are uncommon.

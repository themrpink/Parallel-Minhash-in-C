It has been speculated that life could exist in the lakes of liquid methane on Titan, just as organisms on Earth live in water.&lt;ref name=mckay/&gt; Such organisms would inhale H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in place of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, metabolize it with [[acetylene]] instead of [[glucose]], and exhale methane instead of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name=&quot;life?&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mckay&quot; /&gt; However, such hypothetical organisms would be required to metabolize at a deep freeze temperature of {{cvt|-179|C|F K}}.&lt;ref name='A Mag Cooper'/&gt;

All life forms on Earth (including [[methanogen]]s) use liquid water as a solvent; it is speculated that life on Titan might instead use a liquid hydrocarbon, such as methane or ethane,&lt;ref name=&quot;methanesolvent&quot;&gt;{{cite web |work=Committee on the Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems, Committee on the Origins and Evolution of Life, National Research Council |url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11919&amp;page=74 |title=The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems |publisher=The National Academies Press |date=2007 |page=74 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although water is a stronger solvent than methane.&lt;ref name=&quot;methlife&quot; /&gt; Water is also more chemically reactive, and can break down large organic molecules through [[hydrolysis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;methanesolvent&quot; /&gt; A life form whose solvent was a hydrocarbon would not face the risk of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way.&lt;ref name=&quot;methanesolvent&quot; /&gt;

In 2005, [[astrobiologist]] [[Christopher McKay (planetary scientist)|Chris McKay]] argued that if methanogenic life did exist on the surface of Titan, it would likely have a measurable effect on the mixing ratio in the Titan troposphere: levels of hydrogen and acetylene would be measurably lower than otherwise expected.&lt;ref name=&quot;mckay&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Icarus |volume=178 |issue=1 |pages=274–276 |date=2005 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2005.05.018 |title=Possibilities for methanogenic life in liquid methane on the surface of Titan |last=McKay |first=C.

In 2010, Darrell Strobel, from [[Johns Hopkins University]], identified a greater abundance of molecular hydrogen in the upper atmospheric layers of Titan compared to the lower layers, arguing for a downward flow at a rate of roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; molecules per second and disappearance of hydrogen near Titan's surface; as Strobel noted, his findings were in line with the effects McKay had predicted if [[methanogenic]] life-forms were present.&lt;ref name=&quot;mckay&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;methlife&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Consuming Hydrogen and Acetylene on Titan? |publisher=NASA/JPL |date=2010 |access-date=June 6, 2010 |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2010-190 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629185640/http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2010-190 |archive-date=June 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Molecular hydrogen in Titan's atmosphere: Implications of the measured tropospheric and thermospheric mole fractions |last=Strobel |first=Darrell F. |journal=Icarus |volume=208 |issue=2 |pages=878–886 |date=2010 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2010.03.003 |url=http://astrobiology.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Icarus-2010-Strobel.pdf |bibcode=2010Icar..208..878S |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824195338/http://astrobiology.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Icarus-2010-Strobel.pdf |archive-date=August 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, another study showed low levels of acetylene on Titan's surface, which were interpreted by McKay as consistent with the hypothesis of organisms consuming hydrocarbons.&lt;ref name=&quot;methlife&quot; /&gt; Although restating the biological hypothesis, he cautioned that other explanations for the hydrogen and acetylene findings are more likely: the possibilities of yet unidentified physical or chemical processes (e.g. a surface [[catalyst]] accepting hydrocarbons or hydrogen), or flaws in the current models of material flow.&lt;ref name=&quot;life?&quot; /&gt; Composition data and transport models need to be substantiated, etc. Even so, despite saying that a non-biological catalytic explanation would be less startling than a biological one, McKay noted that the discovery of a catalyst effective at {{convert|95|K|°C|-1|abbr=on}} would still be significant.&lt;ref name=&quot;life?&quot; /&gt;

As NASA notes in its news article on the June 2010 findings: &quot;To date, methane-based life forms are only hypothetical. Scientists have not yet detected this form of life anywhere.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;methlife&quot; /&gt; As the NASA statement also says: &quot;some scientists believe these chemical signatures bolster the argument for a primitive, exotic form of life or precursor to life on Titan's surface.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;methlife&quot; /&gt;

In February 2015, a hypothetical [[cell membrane]] capable of functioning in liquid [[methane]] at cryogenic temperatures (deep freeze) conditions was modeled. Composed of small molecules containing carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, it would have the same stability and flexibility as cell membranes on Earth, which are composed of [[phospholipid]]s, compounds of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and [[phosphorus]]. This hypothetical cell membrane was termed an &quot;[[azotosome]]&quot;, a combination of &quot;azote&quot;, French for nitrogen, and &quot;[[liposome]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=azotosomemodel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2015-02-life-saturn-moon-titan.html|title=Life 'not as we know it' possible on Saturn's moon Titan|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317002959/http://phys.org/news/2015-02-life-saturn-moon-titan.html|archive-date=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevenson|first1=James|last2=Lunine|first2=Jonathan|last3=Clancy|first3=Paulette|title=Membrane alternatives in worlds without oxygen: Creation of an azotosome|journal=Science Advances|date=February 27, 2015|volume=1|issue=1|pages=e1400067|doi=10.1126/sciadv.1400067|pmid=26601130|bibcode = 2015SciA....1E0067S|pmc=4644080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obstacles===
Despite these biological possibilities, there are formidable obstacles to life on Titan, and any analogy to Earth is inexact. At a vast distance from the [[Sun]], Titan is frigid, and its atmosphere lacks CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. At Titan's surface, water exists only in solid form. Because of these difficulties, scientists such as [[Jonathan Lunine]] have viewed Titan less as a likely habitat for life, than as an experiment for examining hypotheses on the conditions that prevailed prior to the appearance of life on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article1130.html |title=Saturn's Moon Titan: Prebiotic Laboratory -- Interview with Jonathan Lunine |first=Henry |last=Bortman |work=Astrobiology Magazine |date=August 11, 2004 |archive-date=August 28, 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040828233135/http://www.astrobio.net/news/article1130.html |access-date=August 11, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although life itself may not exist, the prebiotic conditions on Titan and the associated organic chemistry remain of great interest in understanding the early history of the terrestrial biosphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raulin2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Space Science Reviews |volume=116 |issue=1–2 |pages=471–487 |date=2005 |doi=10.1007/s11214-005-1967-x |title=Exo-astrobiological aspects of Europa and Titan: From observations to speculations |last=Raulin |first=F. |bibcode=2005SSRv..116..471R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using Titan as a prebiotic experiment involves not only observation through spacecraft, but laboratory experiments, and chemical and photochemical modeling on Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raulin2002&quot; /&gt;

===Panspermia hypothesis===
It is hypothesized that large asteroid and cometary impacts on Earth's surface may have caused fragments of microbe-laden rock to escape Earth's gravity, suggesting the possibility of [[panspermia]]. Calculations indicate that these would encounter many of the bodies in the Solar System, including Titan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4819370.stm |title=Earth could seed Titan with life |work=BBC News |date=March 18, 2006 |access-date=March 10, 2007 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031002211/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4819370.stm |archive-date=October 31, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gladman |first=Brett |last2=Dones |first2=Luke |last3=Levinson |first3=Harold F. |last4=Burns |first4=Joseph A. |title=Impact Seeding and Reseeding in the Inner Solar System |date=2005 |journal=Astrobiology |volume=5 |pages=483–496 |doi=10.1089/ast.2005.5.483 |pmid=16078867 |issue=4 |bibcode=2005AsBio...5..483G }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Jonathan Lunine has argued that any living things in Titan's cryogenic hydrocarbon lakes would need to be so different chemically from Earth life that it would not be possible for one to be the ancestor of the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=0908.0762 |last=Lunine |first=Jonathan |title=Saturn's Titan: A Strict Test for Life's Cosmic Ubiquity |url=http://www.amphilsoc.org/sites/default/files/CCLunine1530402.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512013831/http://www.amphilsoc.org/sites/default/files/CCLunine1530402.pdf |archive-date=May 12, 2013 |volume=153 |issue=4 |page=403 |date=2008 |journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |bibcode=2009arXiv0908.0762L |url-status=dead }} [https://archive.org/details/SaturnsTitan copy at archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future conditions===
Conditions on Titan could become far more [[Planetary habitability|habitable]] in the far future. Five billion years from now, as the Sun becomes a [[red giant]], its surface temperature could rise enough for Titan to support liquid water on its surface, making it habitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Climate Change in the Solar System |author=The National Air and Space Museum |date=2012 |url=http://blog.nasm.si.edu/2012/03/07/climate-change-in-the-solar-system/ |access-date=January 14, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311101403/http://blog.nasm.si.edu/2012/03/07/climate-change-in-the-solar-system/ |archive-date=March 11, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Sun's ultraviolet output decreases, the haze in Titan's upper atmosphere will be depleted, lessening the anti-greenhouse effect on the surface and enabling the greenhouse created by atmospheric methane to play a far greater role. These conditions together could create a habitable environment, and could persist for several hundred million years. This is proposed to have been sufficient time for simple life to spawn on Earth, though the presence of ammonia on Titan would cause chemical reactions to proceed more slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Titan under a red giant sun: A new kind of &quot;habitable&quot; moon |last=Lorenz |first=Ralph D. |last2=Lunine |first2=Jonathan I. |last3=McKay |first3=Christopher P. |work=NASA Ames Research Center, Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, Department of Planetary Sciences, University of Arizona |date=1997 |volume=24 |issue=22 |pages=2905–8 |doi=10.1029/97gl52843 |pmid=11542268 |citeseerx=10.1.1.683.8827 |url=http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/~rlorenz/redgiant.pdf |access-date=March 21, 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724173621/http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/~rlorenz/redgiant.pdf |archive-date=July 24, 2011 |bibcode=1997GeoRL..24.2905L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Instrumentation''' is a collective term for [[measuring instrument]]s that are used for indicating, measuring and recording physical quantities. The term has its origins in the art and science of [[Scientific instrument|scientific instrument-making]].

Instrumentation can refer to devices as simple as direct-reading [[thermometer]]s, or as complex as multi-sensor components of [[industrial control system]]s. Today, instruments can be found in laboratories, refineries, factories and vehicles, as well as in everyday household use (e.g., [[smoke detector]]s and [[thermostat]]s)

== History and development==
[[Image:Steuerstand01.jpg|thumb|A local instrumentation panel on a steam turbine]]
The history of instrumentation can be divided into several phases. 

===Pre-industrial===
Elements of industrial instrumentation have long histories. Scales for comparing weights and simple pointers to indicate position are ancient technologies. Some of the earliest measurements were of time. One of the oldest [[water clock]]s was found in the tomb of the [[ancient Egypt]]ian pharaoh [[Amenhotep I]], buried around 1500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Early Clocks | url = https://www.nist.gov/pml/general/time/early.cfm | accessdate = 1 March 2012| date = 2009-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements were incorporated in the clocks. By 270 BCE they had the rudiments of an automatic control system device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Building automation history page | url = http://www.building-automation-consultants.com/building-automation-history.html | accessdate = 1 March 2012 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708104028/http://www.building-automation-consultants.com/building-automation-history.html | archivedate = 8 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1663 [[Christopher Wren]] presented the Royal Society with a design for a &quot;weather clock&quot;. A drawing shows meteorological sensors moving pens over paper driven by clockwork. Such devices did not become standard in meteorology for two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;

Integrating sensors, displays, recorders and controls was uncommon until the industrial revolution, limited by both need and practicality.

===Early industrial===
[[File:Analogue control loop evolution.png|thumb|The evolution of analogue control loop signalling from the pneumatic era to the electronic era]]
Early systems used direct process connections to local control panels for control and indication, which from the early 1930s saw the introduction of pneumatic transmitters and automatic 3-term (PID) controllers.

The ranges of pneumatic transmitters were defined by the need to control valves and actuators in the field. Typically a signal ranged from 3 to 15 psi (20 to 100kPa or 0.2 to 1.0 kg/cm2) as a standard, was standardized with 6 to 30 psi occasionally being used for larger valves. 
Transistor electronics enabled wiring to replace pipes, initially with a range of 20 to 100mA at up to 90V for loop powered devices, reducing to 4 to 20mA at 12 to 24V in more modern systems. A [[transmitter]] is a device that produces an output signal, often in the form of a 4–20&amp;nbsp;[[Ampere|mA]] electrical [[current (electrical)|current]] signal, although many other options using [[voltage]], [[frequency]], [[pressure]], or [[ethernet]] are possible. The [[Transistor#History|transistor]] was commercialized by the mid-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1109/17.704244| title=The commercialization of the transistor radio in Japan: The functioning of an innovation community| year=1998| last1=Lynn| first1=L.H.| journal=IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management| volume=45| issue=3| pages=220–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instruments attached to a control system provided signals used to operate [[solenoid]]s, [[valve]]s, [[Regulator (automatic control)|regulators]], [[circuit breaker]]s, [[relay]]s and other devices. Such devices could control a desired output variable, and provide either remote or automated control capabilities.

Each instrument company introduced their own standard instrumentation signal, causing confusion until the 4–20&amp;nbsp;mA range was used as the standard electronic instrument signal for transmitters and valves. This signal was eventually standardized as ANSI/ISA S50, “Compatibility of Analog Signals for Electronic Industrial Process Instruments&quot;, in the 1970s. The transformation of instrumentation from mechanical pneumatic transmitters, controllers, and valves to electronic instruments reduced maintenance costs as electronic instruments were more dependable than mechanical instruments. This also increased efficiency and production due to their increase in accuracy. Pneumatics enjoyed some advantages, being favored in corrosive and explosive atmospheres.&lt;ref name=Anderson2&gt;

===Automatic process control===
[[File:Industrial control loop.jpg|thumb|Example of a single industrial control loop, showing continuously modulated control of process flow]]
In the early years of [[process control]], process indicators and control elements such as valves were monitored by an operator that walked around the unit adjusting the valves to obtain the desired temperatures, pressures, and flows. As technology evolved pneumatic controllers were invented and mounted in the field that monitored the process and controlled the valves. This reduced the amount of time process operators were needed to monitor the process. Later years the actual controllers were moved to a central room and signals were sent into the control room to monitor the process and outputs signals were sent to the final control element such as a valve to adjust the process as needed. These controllers and indicators were mounted on a wall called a control board. The operators stood in front of this board walking back and forth monitoring the process indicators. This again reduced the number and amount of time process operators were needed to walk around the units. The most standard pneumatic signal level used during these years was 3–15 psig.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;

===Large integrated computer-based systems===
[[Image:Pneumatische regelaar.jpg|thumb|Pneumatic &quot;three term&quot; pneumatic [[PID controller]], widely used before electronics became reliable and cheaper and safe to use in hazardous areas (Siemens Telepneu Example)]]
[[File:Kontrollrom Tyssedal.jpg|thumb|A pre-DCS/SCADA era central control room. Whilst the controls are centralised in one place, they are still discrete and not integrated into one system.]] 
[[File:Leitstand 2.jpg|thumb|A DCS control room where plant information and controls are displayed on computer graphics screens. The operators are seated and can view and control any part of the process from their screens, whilst retaining a plant overview.]]
Process control of large industrial plants has evolved through many stages. Initially, control would be from panels local to the process plant. However this required a large manpower resource to attend to these dispersed panels, and there was no overall view of the process. The next logical development was the transmission of all plant measurements to a permanently-manned central control room. Effectively this was the centralisation of all the localised panels, with the advantages of lower manning levels and easier overview of the process. Often the controllers were behind the control room panels, and all automatic and manual control outputs were transmitted back to plant. 

However, whilst providing a central control focus, this arrangement was inflexible as each control loop had its own controller hardware, and continual operator movement within the control room was required to view different parts of the process. With coming of electronic processors and graphic displays it became possible to replace these discrete controllers with computer-based algorithms, hosted on a network of input/output racks with their own control processors. These could be distributed around plant, and communicate with the graphic display in the control room or rooms. The distributed control concept was born. 

The introduction of DCSs and [[SCADA]] allowed easy interconnection and re-configuration of plant controls such as cascaded loops and interlocks, and easy interfacing with other production computer systems. It enabled sophisticated alarm handling, introduced automatic event logging, removed the need for physical records such as chart recorders, allowed the control racks to be networked and thereby located locally to plant to reduce cabling runs, and provided high level overviews of plant status and production levels.

== Applications ==
In some cases the sensor is a very minor element of the mechanism. Digital cameras and wristwatches might technically meet the loose definition of instrumentation because they record and/or display sensed information. Under most circumstances neither would be called instrumentation, but when used to measure the elapsed time of a race and to document the winner at the finish line, both would be called instrumentation.

===Household===
A very simple example of an instrumentation system is a mechanical [[thermostat]], used to control a household furnace and thus to control room temperature. A typical unit senses temperature with a [[bi-metallic strip]]. It displays temperature by a needle on the free end of the strip. It activates the furnace by a [[mercury switch]]. As the switch is rotated by the strip, the mercury makes physical (and thus electrical) contact between electrodes.

Another example of an instrumentation system is a [[Burglar alarm|home security system]]. Such a system consists of 
sensors (motion detection, switches to detect door openings), simple algorithms to detect intrusion, local control (arm/disarm) and remote monitoring of the system so that the police can be summoned. Communication is an inherent part of the design.

Kitchen appliances use sensors for control.
*A refrigerator maintains a constant temperature by measuring the internal temperature.
*A microwave oven sometimes cooks via a heat-sense-heat-sense cycle until sensing done.
*An automatic ice machine makes ice until a [[Miniature snap-action switch|limit switch]] is thrown.
*Pop-up bread [[toaster]]s can operate by time or by heat measurements. 
*Some ovens use a temperature probe to cook until a target internal food temperature is reached.
*A common [[toilet]] refills the water tank until a float closes the valve. The float is acting as a water level sensor.

===Automotive===
Modern automobiles have complex instrumentation. In addition to displays of engine rotational speed and vehicle linear speed, there are also displays of battery voltage and current, fluid levels, fluid temperatures, distance traveled and feedbacks of various controls (turn signals, parking brake, headlights, transmission position). Cautions may be displayed for special problems (fuel low, check engine, tire pressure low, door ajar, seat belt unfastened). Problems are recorded so they can be reported to  [[Vehicle bus|diagnostic equipment]]. Navigation systems can provide voice commands to reach a destination. Automotive instrumentation must be cheap and reliable over long periods in harsh environments. There may be independent [[airbag]] systems which contain sensors, logic and actuators. [[Anti-lock braking system|Anti-skid]] braking systems use sensors to control the brakes, while [[cruise control]] affects throttle position. A wide variety of services can be provided via communication links as the [[OnStar]] system. [[Autonomous car]]s (with exotic instrumentation) have been demonstrated.

===Aircraft===
Early aircraft had a few sensors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cap-ny153.org/aircraftinstrumentation.htm Aircraft Instrumentation – Leroy R. Grumman Cadet Squadron&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Steam gauges&quot; converted air pressures into needle deflections that could be interpreted as altitude and airspeed. A magnetic compass provided a sense of direction. The displays to the pilot were as critical as the measurements.

A modern aircraft has a far more sophisticated suite of sensors and displays, which are embedded into [[avionics]] systems. The aircraft may contain [[inertial navigation system]]s, [[global positioning system]]s, [[weather radar]], autopilots, and aircraft stabilization systems. Redundant sensors are used for reliability. A subset of the information may be transferred to a [[Event data recorder|crash recorder]] to aid mishap investigations. Modern pilot displays now include computer displays including [[head-up display]]s.

[[Air traffic control radar beacon system|Air traffic control radar]] is distributed instrumentation system. The ground portion transmits an electromagnetic pulse and receives an echo (at least). Aircraft carry transponders that transmit codes on reception of the pulse. The system displays aircraft map location, an identifier and optionally altitude. The map location is based on sensed antenna direction and sensed time delay. The other information is embedded in the transponder transmission.

===Laboratory instrumentation===
Among the possible uses of the term is a collection of laboratory test equipment controlled by a computer through an IEEE-488 bus (also known as GPIB for General Purpose Instrument Bus or HPIB for Hewlitt Packard Instrument Bus). Laboratory equipment is available to measure many electrical and chemical quantities. Such a collection of equipment might be used to automate the testing of drinking water for pollutants.

== Measurement parameters==
Instrumentation is used to measure many parameters (physical values). These parameters include:

[[Image:Pump with tank pid en.svg|thumb|The instrumentation part of a [[piping and instrumentation diagram]] will be developed by an instrumentation engineer.]] 
'''Instrumentation engineering''' is the engineering specialization focused on the principle and operation of measuring instruments that are used in design and configuration of automated systems in areas such as electrical and pneumatic domains, and the control of quantities being measured.
They typically work for industries with [[automated]] processes, such as [[Chemical plant|chemical]] or [[manufacturing]] plants, with the goal of improving system [[productivity]], reliability, safety, optimization and stability.
To control the parameters in a process or in a particular system, devices such as microprocessors, microcontrollers or PLCs are used, but their ultimate aim is to control the parameters of a system.

Instrumentation engineering is loosely defined because the required tasks are very domain dependent. An expert in the biomedical instrumentation of laboratory rats has very different concerns than the expert in rocket instrumentation. Common concerns of both are the selection of appropriate sensors based on size, weight, cost, reliability, accuracy, longevity, environmental robustness and frequency response. Some sensors are literally fired in artillery shells. Others sense thermonuclear explosions until destroyed. Invariably sensor data must be recorded, transmitted or displayed. Recording rates and capacities vary enormously. Transmission can be trivial or can be clandestine, encrypted and low-power in the presence of jamming. Displays can be trivially simple or can require consultation with [[human factors]] experts. Control system design varies from trivial to a separate specialty.

Instrumentation engineers are responsible for integrating the sensors with the recorders, transmitters, displays or control systems, and producing the [[Piping and instrumentation diagram]] for the process. They may design or specify installation, wiring and signal conditioning. They may be responsible for calibration, testing and maintenance of the system.

In a research environment it is common for subject matter experts to have substantial instrumentation system expertise. An astronomer knows the structure of the universe and a great deal about telescopes – optics, pointing and cameras (or other sensing elements). That often includes the hard-won knowledge of the operational procedures that provide the best results. For example, an astronomer is often knowledgeable of techniques to minimize temperature gradients that cause air turbulence within the telescope.

Instrumentation technologists, technicians and mechanics specialize in troubleshooting, repairing and maintaining instruments and instrumentation systems.

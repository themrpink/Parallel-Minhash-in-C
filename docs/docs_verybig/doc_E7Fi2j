The [[Discalced Carmelite]] Order built the priory of Elijah (1911) at the site of Elijah's epic contest with the prophets of Ba'al ([[1 Kings]] 18:20-40). The monastery is situated about 25 kilometers south of [[Haifa]] on the eastern side of the Carmel, and stands on the foundations of a series of earlier monasteries. The site is held sacred by Christians, Jews and Muslims; the name of the area is ''el-Muhraqa,'' an [[Arabic]] construction meaning &quot;place of burning&quot;, and is a direct reference to the biblical account.

Several Carmelite figures who have received significant attention in the 20th century, including [[Thérèse of Lisieux]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thereseoflisieux.org|title=&quot;Saint Therese of Lisieux: A Gateway&quot; Blog - Saint Therese of Lisieux}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of only four female [[Doctors of the Church]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thereseoflisieux.org/doctor-of-the-universal-church/ |title=Doctor of the Universal Church |author=O’Riordan, Maureen  |work=Saint Therese of Lisieux: A Gateway |access-date=April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; so named because of her famous teaching on the &quot;way of confidence and love&quot; set forth in her best-selling memoir, &quot;Story of a Soul&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thereseoflisieux.org/writings/ |title=Writings |author=O’Riordan, Maureen  |work=Saint Therese of Lisieux: A Gateway |access-date=April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three nuns of Monastery of Guadalajara who were martyred on the 24th July 1936 by Spanish Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://carmelourladysdovecote.wordpress.com/2013/06/02/the-carmelite-martyrs-of-guadalajara/|title=The Carmelite Martyrs of Guadalajara|date=Jun 2, 2013|access-date=May 24, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Titus Brandsma]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] scholar and writer who was killed in [[Dachau concentration camp]] because of his stance against [[Nazism]]; and Teresa Benedicta of the Cross (née [[Edith Stein]]), a Jewish convert to Catholicism who was also imprisoned and died at [[Auschwitz]].

[[Raphael Kalinowski]] (1835–1907) was the first friar to be canonized in the order since co-founder [[John of the Cross]]. The writings and teachings of [[Brother Lawrence|Brother Lawrence of the Resurrection]], a Carmelite friar of the 17th century, continue as a spiritual classic under the title ''[[The Practice of the Presence of God]]''. Other non-religious (''i.e.,'' non-vowed monastic) great figures include [[George Preca]], a Maltese priest and Carmelite Tertiary. The Feast of All Carmelite Saints and Blesseds is celebrated on November 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocarm.org/en/content/liturgy/all-carmelite-saints-feast|title=All Carmelite Saints (Feast) - THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE OF THE CARMELITE ORDER}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaders of the Carmelite Order meet from time to time in General Congregation. The most recent General Congregation took place in [[Fátima, Portugal|Fátima]], Portugal from 18 to 30 September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Order of Carmelites, [https://ocarm.org/en/sites/default/files/ficongen16en.pdf General Congregation Final Statement], accessed 26 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== Habit and scapular ==
{{Scapular}}
In 1287, the original way of life of the order was changed to conform to that of the [[mendicant orders]] on the initiative of St. [[Simon Stock]] and at the command of [[Pope Innocent IV]]. Their former habit of a mantle with black and white or brown and white stripes—the black or brown stripes representing the scorches the mantle of Elijah received from the fiery chariot as it fell from his shoulders—was discarded. They wore the same habit as the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], except that the [[cloak]] was white. They also borrowed much from the Dominican and [[Franciscan]] constitutions. Their distinctive garment was a [[scapular]] of two strips of dark cloth, worn on the breast and back, and fastened at the shoulders. Tradition holds that this was given to St. Simon Stock by the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], who appeared to him and promised that all who wore it with faith and piety and who died clothed in it would be saved.&lt;ref&gt;[[EWTN]] &quot;History of the Scapular&quot; [http://www.ewtn.com/expert/answers/brown_scapular.HTM]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Bunson, 2008, ''The Catholic Almanac'', {{ISBN|978-1-59276-441-9}} page 155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerald M. Costello, 2001, ''Treasury of Catholic Stories'', OSV Press, {{ISBN|978-0-87973-979-9}}, page 128&lt;/ref&gt; There arose a [[Sodality (Catholic Church)|sodality]] of the scapular, which affiliated a large number of laymen with the Carmelites.

A miniature version of the Carmelite scapular is popular among Roman Catholics and is one of the most popular [[Catholic devotions|devotions]] in the Church. Wearers usually believe that if they faithfully wear the Carmelite scapular (also called &quot;the brown scapular&quot; or simply &quot;the scapular&quot;) and die in a state of [[divine grace|grace]], they will be saved from [[hell|eternal damnation]]. Catholics who decide to wear the scapular are usually enrolled by a [[Presbyter|priest]], and some choose to enter the Scapular [[Confraternity]]. The Lay Carmelites of the [[Third Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel]] wear a scapular which is smaller than the shortened scapular worn by some Carmelite religious for sleeping, but still larger than the devotional scapulars.

== Visions and devotions ==
Among the various Catholic orders, Carmelite nuns have had a proportionally high ratio of [[visions of Jesus and Mary]] and have been responsible for key [[Catholic devotions]].

From the time of her clothing in the Carmelite religious habit (1583) until her death (1607), [[Mary Magdalene de' Pazzi]] is said to have had a series of raptures and ecstasies.
*First, these raptures sometimes seized upon her whole being with such force as to compel her to rapid motion (e.g. towards some sacred object).
*Secondly, she was frequently able, whilst in ecstasy, to carry on working e.g., embroidery, painting, with perfect composure and efficiency.
*Thirdly, during these raptures Mary Magdalene de' Pazzi gave utterance to maxims of Divine Love, and to counsels of perfection for souls. These were preserved by her companions, who (unknown to her) wrote them down.

[[File:Carmelo do Sagrado Coracao de Jesus Beja.JPG|thumb|right|The Carmel of [[Beja, Portugal|Beja]], in [[Portugal]], where nuns profess to have had apparitions of the [[Child Jesus]], that never were confirmed ]]
In the Carmelite convent of [[Beja (Portugal)|Beja]], in [[Portugal]], two Carmelite nuns of the Ancient Observance reported several apparitions and mystical revelations throughout their life: [[Mariana of the Purification|Venerable Mother Mariana of the Purification]] received numerous apparitions of the [[Child Jesus]] and her body was found [[Incorruptibility|incorrupt]] after her death;&lt;ref&gt;SERPA, J. J. Gonçalves; ''Venerável Madre Mariana da Purificação: Carmelita Calçada de Beja''. Colecção: Almas heróicas de Beja; 230pp.; Gouveia: 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; Venerable Mother [[Maria Perpétua da Luz]] wrote 60 books with messages from heaven;&lt;ref&gt;SANTA ANNA, Frei Joseph Pereira de; ''Vida da Insigne Mestra de Espírito, a Virtuosa Madre Maria Perpétua da Luz, Religiosa Carmelita Calçada''; Lisboa: Oficina de Antonio Pedrozo, 1742.&lt;/ref&gt; both religious died with the [[odour of sanctity|odor of sanctity]].

In the 19th century, another Carmelite nun, [[Thérèse of Lisieux]], was instrumental in spreading devotion to the Holy Face&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thereseoflisieux.org/the-holy-face-of-jesus/ |title=Therese and the Holy Face of Jesus |author=O’Riordan, Maureen  |work=Saint Therese of Lisieux: A Gateway |access-date=April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; throughout France in the 1890s with her many poems and prayers. Eventually [[Pope Pius XII]] approved the devotion in 1958 and declared the Feast of the [[Holy Face of Jesus]] as [[Shrove Tuesday]] (the day before [[Ash Wednesday]]) for all Catholics. Therese of Lisieux emerged as one of the most popular saints for Catholics in the 20th century, and a statue of her can be found in many European and North American Catholic churches built prior to the [[Second Vatican Council]] (after which the number of statues tended to be reduced when churches were built).

In the 20th century, in the last apparition of the [[Our Lady of Fátima|Blessed Virgin Mary]] in [[Fátima, Portugal]], [[Sister Lúcia]], one of the most famous visionaries of Our Lady, said that the Virgin appeared to her as [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]] (holding the [[Brown Scapular]]). Many years after, Lúcia became a Carmelite nun. When Lúcia was asked in an interview why the Blessed Virgin appeared as Our Lady of Mount Carmel in her last apparition, she replied: &quot;Because Our Lady wants all to wear the Scapular... The reason for this&quot;, she explained, &quot;is that the Scapular is our sign of consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary&quot;. When asked if the Brown Scapular is as necessary to the fulfillment of Our Lady's requests as the rosary, Lúcia answered: &quot;The [[Rosary and scapular|Scapular and the Rosary]] are inseparable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Haffert, James Mathias; ''Mary in Her Scapular Promise''. AMI Press, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Carmelites have been canonized by the Catholic Church as saints. November 14 is the Feast of All Carmelite Saints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ocarm.org/en/content/ocarm/carmelite-ordo|title=The Carmelite Ordo &amp;#124; THE WEBSITE OF THE CARMELITE ORDER &amp;#124; WELCOME|website=ocarm.org|access-date=May 24, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Poland}}
The '''President of the Republic of Poland''' ({{lang-pl|Prezydent Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej}}, shorter form: ''Prezydent RP'') is the [[head of state]] of [[Poland]]. Their rights and obligations are determined in the [[Constitution of Poland]]. The president heads the executive branch. In addition the president has a right to dissolve parliament in certain cases, [[veto]] [[legislation]] and represents Poland in the international arena.

==History==
The first president of Poland, [[Gabriel Narutowicz]], was sworn in as president of the [[Second Polish Republic]] on 11 December 1922. He was elected by the [[National Assembly]] (the [[Sejm]] and the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]]) under the terms of the 1921 [[March Constitution (Poland)|March Constitution]]. Narutowicz [[Assassination of Gabriel Narutowicz|was assassinated]] on 16 December 1922. Previously [[Józef Piłsudski]] had been &quot;Chief of State&quot; (''[[Naczelnik Państwa]]'') under the provisional [[Small Constitution of 1919]]. In 1926 Piłsudski staged the &quot;[[May Coup (Poland)|May Coup]]&quot;, overthrew President [[Stanisław Wojciechowski]] and had the National Assembly elect a new one, [[Ignacy Mościcki]], thus establishing the &quot;[[Sanation]] regime&quot;. Before Piłsudski's death, parliament passed a more [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] 1935 [[April Constitution of Poland]] (not in accord with the amendment procedures of the 1921 March Constitution).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Garlicki, Andrzej |date=2001|title=Majowa, marcowa, kwietniowa: Kto nam pisał konstytucje (The valley between the March and the April: We who wrote the constitutions) |language=pl|publisher=Polityki Cyfrowej|url=http://www.konstytucje.pl/pub/t019.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018023756/http://www.konstytucje.pl/pub/t019.htm |archivedate=18 October 2007 |url-status=dead}}, which first appeared in {{Cite journal|author=Garlicki, Andrzej |year=2001|title=Kto nam pisał konstytucje: majowa, marcowa, kwietniowa |journal=Polityka |volume=2001|issue=11 |pages=78, 80, 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mościcki continued as president until he resigned in 1939 in the aftermath of the [[Germany|German]] [[Invasion of Poland]]. Mościcki and his [[Polish government-in-exile|government went into exile]] into [[Romania]], where Mościcki was interned. In [[Angers]], [[France]] [[Władysław Raczkiewicz]], at the time the speaker of the Senate, assumed the presidency after Mościcki's resignation on 29 September 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rojek&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Rojek, Wojciech |chapter=Chapter 4: The government of the Republic of Poland in exile, 1945–92|editor=Stachura, Peter D.|editor-link=Peter Stachura |year=2004|title=The Poles in Britain 1940–2000: from betrayal to assimilation |url=https://archive.org/details/polesbritainfrom00stac |url-access=limited |location=London |publisher=Frank Cass |page=[https://archive.org/details/polesbritainfrom00stac/page/n46 33] |isbn=978-0-7146-5562-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Battle of France|fall of France]], the president and the [[Polish government-in-exile]] were evacuated to [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]. The transfer from Mościcki to Raczkiewicz was in accordance with Article 24 of the 1935 April Constitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garlinski&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Garliński, Józef |year=1985|title=Poland in the Second World War |location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire, England|publisher=Macmillan |page=48 |isbn=978-0-333-39258-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jedrzejewicz&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Jędrzejewicz, Wacław |authorlink=Wacław Jędrzejewicz|year=1946 |title=Poland in the British Parliament 1939–1945 Volume I: British guarantees to Poland to the Atlantic Charter (March 1939 – August 1941) |location=New York |publisher=Jósef Piłsudski Institute of America for Research in the Modern History of Poland |page=318 |oclc=312889779}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raczkiewicz was followed by a succession of presidents in exile, of whom the last one was [[Ryszard Kaczorowski]].

In 1944–45 Poland became a part of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-controlled [[Eastern Bloc|central-eastern Europe]]. [[Bolesław Bierut]] assumed the reins of government and in July 1945 was internationally recognized as the head of state. The Senate was abolished in 1946 by the [[1946 Polish people's referendum|Polish people's referendum]]. When the Sejm passed the [[Small Constitution of 1947]], based in part on the 1921 March Constitution, Bierut was elected president by that body. He served until the [[Constitution of the Polish People's Republic]] of 1952 eliminated the office of the president.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simons&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Simons, William B. |chapter=Constitution of the Polish People's Republic|editor=Simons, William B. |year=1980 |title=The Constitutions of the Communist World |location=Alphen ann den Rijn, the Netherlands|publisher=Sijthoff &amp; Noordhoff |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SVl4sNPzWlwC&amp;pg=PA288 288–310] |isbn=978-90-286-0070-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 1989 amendments to the constitution which restored the presidency,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ustawa z dnia 29 gruduia 1989 r. o zmianie Konstytucja Polski Rzeczypospolitej Ludowej (An Act of 29 December 1989 to amend the Constitution of the Polish People's Republic) |series=Dz.U. 1989 Nr. 75, pos 444|language=pl|publisher=Sejm, Government of Poland |url=http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/Download?id=WDU19890750444&amp;type=3|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415010203/http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/Download?id=WDU19890750444&amp;type=3 |archivedate=15 April 2012 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], the existing head of state, took office. In Poland's first [[direct election|direct]] [[1990 Polish presidential election|presidential election]], [[Lech Wałęsa]] won and was sworn in on 22 December 1990. The office of the president was preserved in the [[Constitution of Poland]] passed in 1997; the constitution now provides the requirements for, the duties of and the authority of the office.

==Election==
The President of Poland is elected directly by the people to serve for five years and can be reelected only once. Pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution, the President is elected by an absolute majority. If no candidate succeeds in passing this threshold, a second round of voting is held with the participation of the two candidates with the largest and second largest number of votes respectively.

In order to be registered as a candidate in the presidential election, one must be a Polish citizen, be at least 35 years old on the day of the first round of the election and collect at least 100,000 signatures of registered voters.

==Powers==
[[Image:Warszawa Pałac Prezydencki 2011.jpg|thumb|left|[[Presidential Palace, Warsaw|Presidential Palace]] on ''[[Krakowskie Przedmieście]]'' in [[Warsaw]], with equestrian statue of Prince [[Józef Poniatowski]] by [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]]. It serves as the official seat of presidency.]]
The President has a free choice in selecting the [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]], yet in practice he or she usually gives the task of forming a new government to a politician supported by the political party with the majority of seats in the [[Sejm]] (usually, though not always, it is the leader of that political party).

The President has the right to initiate the legislative process. They also have the opportunity to directly influence it by using their veto to stop a bill; however, a veto can be overruled by a three-fifths majority vote in the presence of at least half of the statutory number of members of the Sejm (230). Before signing a bill into law, the President can also ask the [[The Constitutional Tribunal of Poland|Constitutional Tribunal]] to verify its compliance with the Constitution, which in practice bears a decisive influence on the legislative process.

In their role as supreme representative of the Polish state, the President has power to ratify and revoke international agreements, nominates and recalls ambassadors, and formally accepts the accreditations of representatives of other states. The President also makes decisions on award of highest academic titles, as well as state distinctions and orders. In addition, they have the right of clemency, viz. They can dismiss final court verdicts (in practice, the President consults such decisions with the Minister of Justice).

The President is also the Supreme Commander of the [[Polish Armed Forces|Armed Forces]]; They appoint the Chief of the General Staff and the commanders of all of the service branches; in wartime they nominate the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and can order a general mobilization. The President performs their duties with the help of the following offices: the Chancellery of the President, the Office of National Security, and the Body of Advisors to the President.{{clear|left}}

==Presidential residencies and properties==
[[Image:Belweder Warszawa.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Belweder]] Palace, often known simply as 'Belvedere', is the traditional and current official residence of the President.]]

Several properties are owned by the Office of the President and are used by the Head of State as his or her official residence, private residence, residence for visiting foreign officials etc.

* [[Presidential Palace, Warsaw|The Presidential Palace in Warsaw]] is the largest palace in Warsaw and the official seat of the President of the Republic of Poland since 1993. The first presidential tenant was Lech Wałęsa when he moved to the Palace from Belweder in 1994.
* [[Belweder]], in Warsaw, was the official seat of the President until 1993, and is currently owned by the Office of the President as the ''official residence of the President'' and is used by the President and the Government for ceremonial purposes. The palace also serves as an official residence for heads of state on official visits to Poland and other important guests.
* [[Wisła|Presidential Castle in Wisła]] in a château built for the Habsburgs as their hunting cottage, which was rebuilt between 1929-1931 and used as recreational residence by President Ignacy Mościcki. Since 2002 it is again a property of the President, restored and opened in 2005 by the President Aleksander Kwaśniewski.

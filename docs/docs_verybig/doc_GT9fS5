In many versions of the story, Horus and Set divide the realm between them. This division can be equated with any of several fundamental dualities that the Egyptians saw in their world. Horus may receive the fertile lands around the Nile, the core of Egyptian civilization, in which case Set takes the barren desert or the foreign lands that are associated with it; Horus may rule the earth while Set dwells in the sky; and each god may take one of the two traditional halves of the country, Upper and Lower Egypt, in which case either god may be connected with either region. Yet in the [[Memphite Theology]], [[Geb]], as judge, first apportions the realm between the claimants and then reverses himself, awarding sole control to Horus. In this peaceable union, Horus and Set are reconciled, and the dualities that they represent have been resolved into a united whole. Through this resolution, order is restored after the tumultuous conflict.{{sfn|te Velde|1967|pages=59–63}}

Egyptologists have often tried to connect the conflict between the two gods with political events early in Egypt's history or prehistory. The cases in which the combatants divide the kingdom, and the frequent association of the paired Horus and Set with the union of Upper and Lower Egypt, suggest that the two deities represent some kind of division within the country. Egyptian tradition and archaeological evidence indicate that Egypt was united at the beginning of its history when an Upper Egyptian kingdom, in the south, conquered Lower Egypt in the north. The Upper Egyptian rulers called themselves &quot;followers of Horus&quot;, and Horus became the tutelary deity of the unified nation and its kings. Yet Horus and Set cannot be easily equated with the two halves of the country. Both deities had several cult centers in each region, and Horus is often associated with Lower Egypt and Set with Upper Egypt. Other events may have also affected the myth. Before even Upper Egypt had a single ruler, two of its major cities were [[Nekhen]], in the far south, and [[Nagada]], many miles to the north. The rulers of Nekhen, where Horus was the patron deity, are generally believed to have unified Upper Egypt, including Nagada, under their sway. Set was associated with Nagada, so it is possible that the divine conflict dimly reflects an enmity between the cities in the distant past. Much later, at the end of the [[Second Dynasty of Egypt|Second Dynasty]] (c. 2890–2686 BCE), Pharaoh [[Seth-Peribsen]] used the [[Set animal]] to writing his [[serekh]] name in place of the falcon hieroglyph representing Horus. His successor [[Khasekhemwy]] used both Horus and Set in the writing of his serekh. This evidence has prompted conjecture that the Second Dynasty saw a clash between the followers of the Horus king and the worshippers of Set led by Seth-Peribsen. Khasekhemwy's use of the two animal symbols would then represent the reconciliation of the two factions, as does the resolution of the myth.&lt;ref&gt;Meltzer in Redford, pp. 165–166&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Golden Horus Osiris ===
Horus gradually took on the nature as both the son of Osiris and Osiris himself. He was referred to as Golden Horus Osiris.&lt;ref&gt;Yoyotte, Jean, Une notice biographique du roi Osiris, BIFAO 77 (1977), p.145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hymn to Osiris Un-Nefer, Translated by E.A.Wallis Budge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Budge, E.A.

He was sometimes believed to be both the father of himself as well as his own son, and some later accounts have Osiris being brought back to life by Isis.&lt;ref&gt;E.A.

=== Her-ur (Horus the Elder) ===
Heru-ur (or Herwer), (Haroeris to the Ptolemaic Greeks), also known as '''''Horus the Elder''''', was a form of Horus, where he was the son of [[Geb]] and [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]]. He was one of the oldest gods of ancient Egypt. He absorbed a number of local gods including a hawk god Nekheny the nome of [[Nekhen (nome)|Nekhen]] and Wer (a god of light known as “the great one” whose eyes were the sun and moon) to become the patron of [[Nekhen|Nekhen (Hierakonpolis)]], the first national god (&quot;God of the Kingdom&quot;) and later the patron god of the pharaohs. Nekhen was a powerful city in the pre-dynastic period, and the early capital of Upper Egypt. By the Old Kingdom he was simply referred to as Horus had become the first national god and the patron of the Pharaoh.

He was called the son of truth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Erasmus|title=Cleopatra's needle: With brief notes on Egypt and Egyptian obelisks|date=January 1, 1877|publisher=Brain &amp; Company|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/cleopatrasneedle00wils/page/208 208]|url=https://archive.org/details/cleopatrasneedle00wils|accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; – signifying his role as an important upholder of [[Maat]]. His right eye was the Sun and the left one was the Moon. Her-ur was sometimes depicted fully as a falcon, he was sometimes given the title '''Kemwer''', meaning &quot;(the) great black (one)&quot;.

Other variants include ''Hor Merti'' 'Horus of the two eyes' and ''Horkhenti Irti''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Patricia Turner, Charles Russell Coulter, ''Dictionary of ancient deities'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heru-pa-khered (Horus the Younger) ===
Heru-pa-khered ([[Harpocrates]] to the Ptolemaic Greeks), also known as '''''Horus the Younger''''', is represented in the form of a youth wearing a lock of hair (a sign of youth) on the right of his head while sucking his finger. In addition, he usually wears the united crowns of Egypt, the crown of Upper Egypt and the crown of Lower Egypt. He is a form of the rising sun, representing its earliest light.
=== Heru-Behdeti (Horus of [[Behdet]]) ===
The [[winged sun]] of Horus of [[Edfu]] and depicted on the top of pylons in the ancient temples throughout Egypt.
[[File:Edfu17 c.jpg|left|thumb|'''Her-em-akhet''' (Greek: Harmakhis), the wall relief of a hieracosphinx depicted at the Temple of Horus in Edfu]]

=== Her-em-akhet (Horus in the Horizon) ===
Her-em-akhet (or Horemakhet), ('''''Harmakhis''''' in Greek), represented the dawn and the early morning sun. He was often depicted as a sphinx with the head of a man (like the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]]), or as a [[hieracosphinx]], a creature with a lion's body and a falcon's head and wings, sometimes with the head of a [[lion]] or [[Sheep|ram]] (the latter providing a link to the god [[Khepri]], the rising sun). It was believed that he was the inspiration for the [[Sphinx of Giza|Great Sphinx of Giza]], constructed under the order of [[Khafre]], whose head it depicts.  

Other forms of Horus include:

''- '''Hor Merti''''' ('Horus of the Two Eyes');

''- '''Horkhenti Irti''''';&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

- '''''Her-sema-tawy''''' ('Horus Uniter of the Two Lands'), the Greek '''''Harsomptus''','' depicted like the double-crowned Horus

== Celebrations of Horus ==
[[Macrobius]]' ''[[Chronicon]]'' noted the annual [[ancient Egypt]]ian celebration of Horus, specifying the time as the [[winter solstice]]. An analysis of the works of [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] noted the Egyptian winter solstice celebration of Horus in [[Panarion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loebclassics.com/view/macrobius-saturnalia/2011/pb_LCL510.1.xml|title=MACROBIUS, Saturnalia – Loeb Classical Library|website=Loeb Classical Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William R. Cooper's 1877 book and [[Acharya S]]'s self-published 2008 book, among others, have suggested that there are many similarities between the story of Horus and the much posterior story of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iaqe9CG_s6cC&amp;q=jesus+horus&amp;pg=PR6|title=Christ in Egypt: The Horus-Jesus Connection|last1=Murdock|first1=D.

The '''Bayeux Tapestry''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|b|aɪ|ˈ|j|ɜː|,_|b|eɪ|-}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|b|eɪ|j|uː|,_|ˈ|b|aɪ|-}}; {{lang-fr|Tapisserie de Bayeux}} {{IPA-fr|tapisʁi də bajø|}} or {{lang|fr|La telle du conquest}}; {{lang-la|Tapete Baiocense}}) is an [[embroidery|embroidered]] cloth nearly {{convert|70|m|ft}} long and {{convert|50|cm|in}} tall&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reframing Medieval Art: Difference, Margins, Boundaries|last=Caviness|first=Madeline H.|publisher=Tufts University|year=2001|location=Medford, MA|via=http://dca.lib.tufts.edu/caviness/}}; {{Cite journal|last=Koslin|first=Desirée|year=1990|title=Turning Time in the Bayeux Embroidery|journal=Textile &amp; Text|volume=13|pages=28–29}}; {{Cite book|title=La tapisserie de Bayeux|last=Bertrand|first=Simone|publisher=Zodiaque|year=1966|location=La Pierre-qui-Vire|page=23|quote=et combien pauvre alors ce nom de broderie nous apparaît-il!}}&lt;/ref&gt; that depicts the events leading up to the [[Norman conquest of England]] concerning [[William the Conqueror|William, Duke of Normandy]], and [[Harold Godwinson|Harold, Earl of Wessex, later King of England]], and culminating in the [[Battle of Hastings]]. It is thought to date to the 11th century, within a few years after the battle. It tells the story from the point of view of the conquering Normans but is now agreed to have been made in England.

According to Sylvette Lemagnen, conservator of the tapestry, in her 2005 book ''La Tapisserie de Bayeux'':

{{quote|The Bayeux tapestry is one of the supreme achievements of the Norman [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]]&amp;nbsp;.... Its survival almost intact over nine centuries is little short of miraculous&amp;nbsp;... Its exceptional length, the harmony and freshness of its colours, its exquisite workmanship, and the genius of its guiding spirit combine to make it endlessly fascinating.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvette Lemagnen, Preface, p. 9; {{cite book |last1=Musset  |first1=Lucien |last2=Rex |first2=Richard (translator) |title=La Tapisserie de Bayeux: œuvre d'art et document historique |trans-title=The Bayeux Tapestry |type=annotated edition |edition=First |date=1 November 2005 |orig-year=1989 |publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd |location=Woodbridge, United Kingdom |isbn=978-1-84383-163-1 |page=272 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The cloth consists of some seventy scenes, many with Latin ''[[tituli]]'', embroidered on linen with coloured woollen yarns. It is likely that it was commissioned by [[Odo, Earl of Kent|Bishop Odo]], William's half-brother, and made in England—not Bayeux—in the 1070s. In 1729 the hanging was rediscovered by scholars at a time when it was being displayed annually in [[Bayeux Cathedral]]. The tapestry is now exhibited at the Musée de la Tapisserie de Bayeux in [[Bayeux]], [[Normandy]], France {{nowrap|({{coord|49.2744|N|0.7003|W|type:landmark_region:FR_source:wikidata|display=inline}}).}}

The designs on the Bayeux Tapestry are [[embroidery|embroidered]] rather than [[weaving|woven]], so that it is not technically a [[tapestry]].&lt;ref&gt;Saul, Nigel. &quot;Bayeux Tapestry&quot;. ''A Companion to Medieval England''. Stroud, UK: Tempus.  pp. 32–33. {{ISBN|0-7524-2969-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it has always been referred to as a tapestry until recent years when the name &quot;Bayeux Embroidery&quot; has gained ground among certain art historians.  It can be seen as a rare example of secular [[Romanesque art]].  Tapestries adorned both churches and wealthy houses in Medieval Western Europe, though at 0.5 by 68.38 metres (1.6 by 224.3&amp;nbsp;ft, and apparently incomplete) the Bayeux Tapestry is exceptionally large.  Only the figures and decoration are embroidered, on a background left plain, which shows the subject very clearly and was necessary to cover large areas.

== Origins ==
[[File:Odo of Bayeux.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Odo, Earl of Kent|Bishop Odo]] of Bayeux]]

The earliest known written reference to the tapestry is a 1476 inventory of [[Bayeux Cathedral]],&lt;ref&gt;Fowke, Frank Rede. ''The Bayeux Tapestry&amp;nbsp;– A History and Description'', London: G. Bell &amp; Sons, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; but its origins have been the subject of much speculation and controversy.

French legend maintained the tapestry was commissioned and created by [[Matilda of Flanders|Queen Matilda]], [[William I of England|William the Conqueror's]] wife, and her [[lady-in-waiting|ladies-in-waiting]]. Indeed, in France, it is occasionally known as &quot;La Tapisserie de la Reine Mathilde&quot; (Tapestry of Queen Matilda). However, scholarly analysis in the 20th century concluded it was probably commissioned by William's half-brother, [[Odo of Bayeux|Bishop Odo]],&lt;ref&gt;Sir Frank Stenton (ed) et al, ''The Bayeux Tapestry. A comprehensive survey'' London: Phaidon, 1957 revised 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; who, after the Conquest, became [[Earl of Kent]] and, when William was absent in Normandy, [[regent]] of England.

The reasons for the Odo commission theory include:
#three of the bishop's followers mentioned in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' appear on the tapestry;
#it was found in Bayeux Cathedral, built by Odo; and
#it may have been commissioned at the same time as the cathedral's construction in the 1070s, possibly completed by 1077 in time for display on the cathedral's dedication.

Assuming Odo commissioned the tapestry, it was probably designed and constructed in England by [[Anglo-Saxon art]]ists (Odo's main power base being by then in [[Kent]]); the Latin text contains hints of Anglo-Saxon; other embroideries originate from England at this time; and the vegetable dyes can be found in cloth traditionally woven there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120712134414/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22472&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO World Heritage nomination form], in English and French.

Clarke has proposed that the designer of the tapestry was [[Scolland]], the abbot of [[St Augustine's Abbey]] in [[Canterbury]], because of his previous position as head of the scriptorium at [[Mont Saint-Michel]] (famed for its illumination), his travels to [[Trajan's Column]], and his connections to [[Wadard]] and Vital, two individuals identified in the tapestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Howard B.|title=The Identity of the Designer of the Bayeux Tapestry|journal=Anglo-Norman Studies|year=2013|volume=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Designer of the Bayeux Tapestry identified|url=http://www.medievalists.net/2013/10/29/designer-of-the-bayeux-tapestry-identified/|publisher=Medievalists.net|access-date=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The actual physical work of stitching was most likely undertaken by female needleworkers. Anglo-Saxon needlework of the more detailed type known as [[Opus Anglicanum]] was famous across Europe.  It was perhaps commissioned for display in the hall of his palace and then bequeathed to the cathedral he built, following the pattern of the documented but lost hanging of [[Byrhtnoth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=C.

Alternative theories exist. [[Carola Hicks]] has suggested it could possibly have been commissioned by [[Edith of Wessex]], widow of [[Edward the Confessor]] and sister of Harold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/04/2006_21_mon.shtml &quot;New Contender for The Bayeux Tapestry?&quot;], from the BBC, 22 May 2006.

== Construction, design and technique ==
[[File:Bayeux tapestry laid work detail..jpg|thumb|Detail of [[Backstitch|stem stitching]] and laid work.]]

In common with other embroidered hangings of the [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval period]], this piece is conventionally referred to as a &quot;tapestry&quot;, although it is not a true [[tapestry]] in which the design is [[weaving|woven]] into the cloth; it is in fact an [[embroidery]].

The Bayeux tapestry is embroidered in [[crewel]] ([[wool]] [[yarn]]) on a [[plain weave|tabby-woven]] [[linen]] ground 68.38 metres long and 0.5 metres wide ({{convert|68.38|x|0.5|m|ft|disp=output only}}) and using two methods of stitching: [[backstitch|outline or stem stitch]] for lettering and the outlines of figures, and [[couching (embroidery)|couching or laid work]] for filling in figures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Coatsworth&quot; /&gt; Nine linen panels, between fourteen and three metres in length, were sewn together after each was embroidered and the joins were disguised with subsequent embroidery.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; At the first join (start of [[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#14|scene 14]]) the borders do not line up properly but the technique was improved so that the later joins are practically invisible.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; The design involved a broad central zone with narrow decorative borders top and bottom.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; By inspecting the woollen threads behind the linen it is apparent all these aspects were embroidered together at a session and the awkward placing of the ''tituli'' is not due to them being added later.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; Later generations have patched the hanging in numerous places and some of the embroidery (especially in the [[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#58|final scene]]) has been reworked.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; The tapestry may well have maintained much of its original appearance—it now compares closely with a careful drawing made in 1730.&lt;ref name=hicks/&gt;

The [[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#58|end of the tapestry]] has been missing from time immemorial and the final ''titulus'' &quot;Et fuga verterunt Angli&quot; (&quot;and the English left fleeing&quot;) is said to be &quot;entirely spurious&quot;, added shortly before 1814 at a time of anti-English sentiment.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; [[Lucien Musset|Musset]]  speculates the hanging was originally about 1.5 metres longer.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; At the last section still remaining the embroidery has been almost completely restored but this seems to have been done with at least some regard to the original stitching.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; The stylised tree is quite unlike any other tree in the tapestry.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; The [[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#1|start of the tapestry]] has also been restored but to a much lesser extent.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt;

Norton{{refn|group=note|Professor Christopher Norton is emeritus professor of History of Art at the [[University of York]] in the Centre for Medieval Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Christopher Norton - History of Art, The University of York |url=https://www.york.ac.uk/history-of-art/staff/norton/ |website=www.york.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} has reviewed the various measurements of the length of the tapestry itself and of its nine individual linen panels. He has also attempted to estimate the size and architectural design of the 11th-century Bayeux Cathedral. He considers the tapestry would have fitted well if it had been hung along the south, west and north [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]] of the [[nave]] and that the scenes it depicts can be correlated with positions of the arcade [[Bay (architecture)|bay]]s in a way that would have been dramatically satisfying. He agrees with earlier speculation that a final panel is missing—one that shows William's coronation and which he thinks was some three metres long. Norton concludes that the tapestry was definitely designed to be hung in Bayeux Cathedral specifically; that it was designed to appeal to a Norman audience; and that it was probably designed for Bishop Odo so as to be displayed at the dedication of the cathedral in 1077 in the presence of William, Matilda, their sons, and Odo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Norton |first1=Christopher |title=Viewing the Bayeux Tapestry, Now and Then |journal=Journal of the British Archaeological Association |date=23 October 2019 |volume=172 |issue=1 |pages=52–89 |doi=10.1080/00681288.2019.1642012|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main yarn colours are terracotta or russet, blue-green, dull gold, olive green, and blue, with small amounts of dark blue or black and sage green. Later repairs are worked in light yellow, orange, and light greens.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot; /&gt; Laid yarns are couched in place with yarn of the same or contrasting colour.

The tapestry's central zone contains most of the action, which sometimes overflows into the borders either for dramatic effect or because depictions would otherwise be very cramped (for example at Edward's [[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#27|death scene]]). Events take place in a long series of scenes which are generally separated by highly stylised trees. However, the trees are not placed consistently and the greatest scene shift, between Harold's audience with Edward after his return to England and Edward's [[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#26|burial scene]], is not marked in any way at all.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt;

The ''tituli'' are normally in the central zone but occasionally use the top border. The borders are otherwise mostly purely decorative and only sometimes does the decoration complement the action in the central zone. The decoration consists of birds, beasts, fish and scenes from fables, agriculture, and hunting. There are frequent oblique bands separating the vignettes. There are nude figures, some of corpses from battle, others of a ribald nature.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; A [[Harrow (tool)|harrow]], a newly invented implement, is depicted ([[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#10|scene 10]]) and this is the earliest known depiction. The picture of [[Halley's Comet]], which appears in the upper border ([[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#32|scene 32]]), is the first known picture of this comet.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt;

In 1724 a linen backing cloth was sewn on comparatively crudely and, in around the year 1800, large ink numerals were written on the backing which broadly enumerate each scene and which are still commonly used for reference.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt;

== Background to the events depicted ==
In a series of pictures supported by a written commentary the tapestry tells the story of the events of 1064–1066 culminating in the [[Battle of Hastings]]. The two main protagonists are [[Harold Godwinson]], recently crowned King of England, leading the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] English, and [[William I of England|William, Duke of Normandy]], leading a mainly [[Normans|Norman]] army, sometimes called the [[companions of William the Conqueror]].&lt;ref name=musset /&gt;

[[File:Bayeux Tapestry scene1 Edward.jpg|thumb|right|[[Edward the Confessor]] sends Harold to Normandy]]

William was the [[illegitimate]] son of [[Robert the Magnificent]], [[Duke of Normandy]], and [[Herleva]] (or Arlette), a [[tanner (occupation)|tanner]]'s daughter. William became Duke of Normandy at the age of seven and was in control of Normandy by the age of nineteen. His half-brother was Bishop [[Odo of Bayeux]].

King [[Edward the Confessor]], king of England and about sixty years old at the time the tapestry starts its narration, had no children or any clear successor. Edward's mother, [[Emma of Normandy]], was William's great aunt. At that time [[Succession to the British throne#England|succession to the English throne]] was not by [[primogeniture]] but was decided jointly by the king and by an assembly of nobility, the [[Witenagemot]].

[[Harold Godwinson]], [[Earl of Wessex]] and the most powerful noble in England, was Edward's brother-in-law. The Norman chronicler [[William of Poitiers]]&lt;ref&gt;William of Poitiers: ''Gesta Willelmi ducis Normannorum et regis Anglorum'', c.1071.&lt;/ref&gt; reported that Edward had previously determined that William would succeed him on the throne, and Harold had sworn to honour this, and yet later that Harold had claimed Edward, on his deathbed, had made him heir over William. However, other sources, such as [[Eadmer]] dispute this claim.

== Events depicted in the tapestry ==
The tapestry begins with a panel of Edward the Confessor sending Harold to Normandy.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#1|(scene 1)]]&lt;/sup&gt; Later Norman sources say that the mission was for Harold to pledge loyalty to William but the tapestry does not suggest any specific purpose.&lt;ref name=hicks&gt;{{cite book|last=Hicks|first=Carola|author-link=Carola Hicks|title=The Bayeux Tapestry.

On the way, just outside the monastery of [[Mont Saint-Michel]], the army become mired in quicksand and Harold saves two Norman soldiers.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#17|(scene 17)]]&lt;/sup&gt; William's army chases Conan from [[Dol de Bretagne]] to [[Rennes]], and Conan finally surrenders at [[Battle of Dinan|Dinan]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#20|(scene 20)]]&lt;/sup&gt; William gives Harold arms and armour (possibly [[knight]]ing him) and Harold takes an oath on [[saint]]ly [[relic]]s.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#23|(scene 23)]]&lt;/sup&gt; Although the writing on the tapestry explicitly states an oath is taken there is no clue as to what is being promised.&lt;ref name=hicks/&gt;

His works are often considered frank examinations of the modern condition. His early works reflect a mastery and Americanization of the Theatre of the Absurd that found its peak in works by European playwrights such as [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], and [[Jean Genet]].

His middle period comprised plays that explored the psychology of maturing, marriage, and sexual relationships. Younger American playwrights, such as [[Paula Vogel]], credit Albee's mix of theatricality and biting dialogue with helping to reinvent postwar American theatre in the early 1960s. Later in life, Albee continued to experiment in works such as ''[[The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?]]'' (2002).

Edward Albee was born in 1928. He was placed for adoption two weeks later and taken to Larchmont, New York, where he grew up. Albee's adoptive father, [[Reed A. Albee]], the wealthy son of [[vaudeville]] magnate [[Edward Franklin Albee II|Edward Franklin Albee&amp;nbsp;II]], owned several theaters. His adoptive mother, Reed's second wife, Frances (Cotter), was a socialite.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimesObit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weber|first1=Bruce|title=Edward Albee, Trenchant Playwright for a Desperate Era, Dies at 88|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/17/arts/edward-albee-playwright-of-a-desperate-generation-dies-at-88.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardianobit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Edward Albee, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? playwright, dies aged 88|first=Vanessa|last=Thorpe|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/sep/16/edward-albee-dies-playwright-whos-afraid-virginia-woolf|access-date=September 17, 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|date=September 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later based the main character of his 1991 play ''[[Three Tall Women]]'' on his mother, with whom he had a conflicted relationship.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/08/15/specials/albee-larchmont.html|title=Albee Mines His Larchmont Childhood|first=Dan| last=Markowitz|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 28, 1994|access-date=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albee attended the Rye Country Day School, then the [[Lawrenceville School]] in New Jersey, from which he was expelled.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimesObit&quot; /&gt; He then was sent to [[Valley Forge Military Academy]] in Wayne, Pennsylvania, where he was dismissed in less than a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Playbill-obit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author-link1=Robert Simonson|last1=Simonson|first1=Robert|title=Edward Albee, Towering American Playwright, Dies at 88|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/edward-albee-towering-american-playwright-dies-at-88|website=Playbill|date=September 16, 2016|access-date=September 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He enrolled at [[Choate Rosemary Hall|The Choate School]] (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in [[Wallingford, Connecticut]],&lt;ref name=&quot;latimesobit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boehm|first1=Mike|title=Edward Albee, three-time Pulitzer-winning playwright and 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' author, dies at 88|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-edward-albee-obit-20160916-snap-story.html|access-date=September 17, 2016|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=September 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; graduating in 1946.  He had attracted theatre attention by having scripted and published nine poems, eleven short stories, essays, a long act play, ''Schism'', and a 500-page novel, ''The Flesh of Unbelievers'' (Horn, 1) in 1946. His formal education continued at [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]] in Hartford, Connecticut, where he was expelled in 1947 for skipping classes and refusing to attend compulsory chapel.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimesobit&quot;/&gt;

Albee left home for good in his late teens. In a later interview, he said: &quot;I never felt comfortable with the adoptive parents. I don't think they knew how to be parents. I probably didn't know how to be a son, either.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.achievement.org/achiever/edward-albee/#interview |title=Edward Albee Interview |publisher=Academy of Achievement |date=June 2, 2005 |access-date=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1994 interview, he said he left home at 18 because &quot;[he] had to get out of that stultifying, suffocating environment.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; In 2008, he told interviewer [[Charlie Rose]] that he was &quot;thrown out&quot; because his parents wanted him to become a &quot;corporate thug&quot; and did not approve of his aspirations to become a writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Charlie Rose view|1004}}, May 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Albee's most iconic play, ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'', opened on Broadway at the [[Billy Rose Theatre]] on October 13, 1962, and closed on May 16, 1964, after five previews and 664 performances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/2773/Whos-Afraid-of-Virginia-Woolf &quot;Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;], ''Playbill Vault''.

[[Georgia State University]] English professor Matthew Roudane divides Albee's plays into three periods: the Early Plays (1959–1966), characterized by gladiatorial confrontations, bloodied action and fight to the metaphorical death; the Middle Plays (1971–1987), when Albee lost favor of Broadway audience and started premiering in the U.S. regional theaters and in Europe; and the Later plays (1991–2016), received as a remarkable comeback and watched by appreciative audiences and critics the world over.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/edward-albee/overview-the-theater-of-edward-albee/A5804573603B72A5AE74264BD6E6C887/core-reader|title=Overview: The Theater of Edward Albee|last=Roudané|first=Matthew|date=August 2017|website=Edward Albee: A Critical Introduction|language=en|access-date=2020-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The New York Times'', Albee was &quot;widely considered to be the foremost American playwright of his generation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Edward Albee, Trenchant Playwright Who Laid Bare Modern Life, Dies at 88|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/17/arts/edward-albee-playwright-of-a-desperate-generation-dies-at-88.html|access-date=December 16, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The less-than-diligent student later dedicated much of his time to promoting American university theatre. He served as a distinguished professor at the University of Houston, where he taught playwriting. His plays are published by [[Dramatists Play Service]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dramatists.com/index.asp |title=Dramatists Play Service |publisher=Dramatists.com |access-date=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Samuel French, Inc.]]

==Achievements and honors==
[[File:Edward Albee 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Albee in 1997]]
A member of the [[Dramatists Guild]] Council, Albee received three [[Pulitzer Prize]]s for [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama|drama]]—for ''[[A Delicate Balance (play)|A Delicate Balance]]'' (1967), ''[[Seascape (play)|Seascape]]'' (1975), and ''[[Three Tall Women]]'' (1994).

Albee was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1972.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, Albee was inducted into the [[American Theatre Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/05/arts/broadway-s-best.html|title=Broadway's Best|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 5, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Albee received the [[PEN/Laura Pels Theater Award]] as a Master American Dramatist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Winners of the PEN/Laura Pels International Foundation for Theater Awards {{!}} PEN America|url=https://pen.org/winners-penlaura-pels-international-foundation-theater-awards|publisher=PEN|access-date=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a Special [[Tony Award]] for Lifetime Achievement (2005);&lt;ref name=&quot;bncnewsobit&quot;/&gt; the gold medal in Drama from the [[American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters]] (1980); as well as the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] and the [[National Medal of Arts]] (both in 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who We Are|url=http://www.albeefoundation.org/who-we-are.html|publisher=The Edward F.

In 2008, in celebration of Albee's 80th birthday, a number of his plays were mounted in distinguished [[Off-Broadway]] venues, including the historic [[Cherry Lane Theatre]] where the playwright directed two of his early one-acts, ''The American Dream'' and ''The Sandbox''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brantley|first1=Ben|title=A Double Bill of Plays, Both Heavy on the Bile|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/02/theater/reviews/02bran.html |access-date=September 17, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Albee established the [[Edward F. Albee Foundation, Inc.]] in 1967, from royalties from his play ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?''. The foundation funds the [[William Flanagan Memorial Creative Persons Center]] (named after the composer [[William Flanagan (composer)|William Flanagan]], but better known as &quot;The Barn&quot;) in [[Montauk, New York]], as a residence for writers and visual artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grundberg|first1=Andy|title=The Artists of Summer|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/03/arts/the-artists-of-summer.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 3, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The foundation's mission is &quot;to serve writers and visual artists from all walks of life, by providing time and space in which to work without disturbance.&quot;&lt;ref name=found&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission &amp; History|url=http://www.albeefoundation.org/mission--history.html|website=The Edward F.

==Personal life and death==
Albee was openly gay and stated that he first knew he was gay at age 12 and a half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412220903/http://www.metroweekly.com/feature/?ak=6070 |url=http://www.metroweekly.com/feature/?ak=6070 |url-status=unfit |title=Who's Afraid of Edward Albee? |first=Randy |last=Shulman |journal=Metro Weekly |date=March 10, 2011 |archive-date=April 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albee was briefly engaged to Larchmont debutante Delphine Weissinger, and although their relationship ended when she moved to England, he remained a close friend of the Weissinger family. Growing up, he often spent more of his time in the Weissinger household than he did in his own, due to discord with his adoptive parents.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Albee insisted that he did not want to be known as a &quot;gay writer,&quot; saying in his acceptance speech for the 2011 [[Lambda Literary Foundation]]'s Pioneer Award for Lifetime Achievement: &quot;A writer who happens to be gay or lesbian must be able to transcend self. I am not a gay writer. I am a writer who happens to be gay.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/06/06/136923478/playwright-edward-albee-defends-remarks|title=Playwright Edward Albee defends 'gay writer' remarks|publisher=National Public Radio|date=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His longtime partner, Jonathan Richard Thomas, a sculptor, died on May 2, 2005 from bladder cancer. They had been partners from 1971 until Thomas's death.

'''Gallura''' ({{lang-sdn|Gaddùra}} {{IPA-co|ɡaˈɖːura|}}; {{lang-sc|Caddura}} {{IPA-sc|kaˈɖːuɾa|}}) is a region in North-Eastern [[Sardinia]], [[Italy]].

The name ''Gallùra'' is allegedly supposed to mean &quot;stony area&quot;.

== Geography ==
Gallùra has a surface of {{convert|1370|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} and it is situated between 40°55'20&quot;64 latitude north and 09°29'11&quot;76 east longitude. It is 187 kilometers from the Italian [[peninsula]] and 11 kilometers from the French island of [[Corsica]].
The coast of Gallura is very jagged and continues along in a continuous series of small fiords, rock-cliffs and little islands that form the [[archipelago]] of [[La Maddalena]], a natural bridge towards nearby Corsica.
The landscape is characterised by [[granite]] rocks and harsh mountains that, even if not particularly high, have constituted for millennia a barrier between this region and the nearby territories of [[Baronie]] and [[Montalbo]]. [[Monte Limbara]] is the highest mountain (1,362 m/4,469&amp;nbsp;ft). It represents the boundary between Gallura and the nearby region called [[Logudoro]]. Its highest peak is [[Punta Balestrieri]] (1362 m above the sea level). In the past, Monte Limbara used to be the location of an important [[NATO]] long range [[radar]] base and a [[Carabinieri]]’s barrack. Today it is used as a [[telecommunications]] center for the Italian Air Force and a [[heliport]] for the Servizio Antincendi. It is also the location of all the major TV [[Broadcast relay station|relay station]]s of West Sardinia. Another small mountain is Monte Cruzitta (666 m). Even if it is not very high, it offers a very characteristic landscape.
The [[climate]] is typical of the Mediterranean. The weather is clear. During the year approximately 300 days are sunny and the few others are rainy, with a major concentration of [[rainfall]] in the winter and autumn, some heavy showers in the spring, and snowfalls on the highest [[massif]]s and highlands. The [[mistral (wind)|mistral]] is the dominant wind, fresh, strong, and usually dry and cold, blowing from the northwest throughout the year, but most frequently in winter and spring.

== History ==

=== Prehistory===
The first human settlements in Gallura date back to approximately 30.000 years ago, when the first populations crossed the strait between [[Tuscany]] and Sardinia. This historic period is known as the [[Stone Age]].
Foreign populations colonize Gallura due to its numerous natural resources. Many people from the nearby island of Corsica came as well to Gallura during this historic period. The mid-late neolithic [[Arzachena culture]] subsisted almost exclusively in this area, and here is found the remains of perhaps the oldest [[megalith]] on Sardinia, at [[Necropolis of Li Muri|Li Muri]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Sinclair &amp; J. Bradbury; ''Megaliths and their Mysteries''; 1979; MacMillan Publishing; pp. 104-108&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From Nuragic Prehistory to Antiquity ===
[[File:Nuraghe Izzana (circa 1600 a.C.) (8286907194).jpg|thumb|Nuraghe Izzana]]
The historic period that goes from 1700 BC to the Roman Age is also known in Sardinia as the [[Nuragic civilization|Nuragic Age]]. The particular name of this historic period takes after the [[Nuraghe]]s, the biggest megalithic edifices ever found in Europe, which still today represent a symbol for Sardinia.
 
The [[Phoenicia]]ns founded the (hence Punic) city of [[Olbia]] (renamed in Greek, though), which was conquered by the Romans with all of Gallura in 238 BC.

=== The Judicate of Gallura ===
During the [[Middle Ages]], Gallura was one of the four [[Sardinian medieval kingdoms|Judicates]], the four autonomous states into which Sardinia was divided under pope Alexander's assent. 
[[Civita]] (which today is known as Olbia) was the capital of the Giudicato of Gallura and the (first) bishop's see.
The [[Judicate of Gallura]] included today's area of Gallura, the area surrounding the city of [[Nuoro]], and the area called ''Baronias'' (Italian: ''Baronie''). It was occupied by the [[republic of Pisa]] in 1288 after the fall of the last ruling judge [[Nino Visconti]].

=== Late Middle Ages till the eighteenth century===
At the end of the 13th century, the city of Civita (today's Olbia) takes the name of Terranova, a new settlement founded by the pisans near the site of the ancient Roman port of Olbia.
[[Pirate]]s – primarily from [[North Africa]] – [[raid (military)|raided]] the coasts of Gallura and people moved consequently from there to the hinterland. The city of [[Tempio]] became especially populated.
Between 1300 and 1800 there was a big emigration of people from the nearby island of [[Corsica]] to Gallura. [[Corsicans]] deeply influenced the language and the culture of Gallura, which still today is considered quite different from the culture and the dialects of the rest of Sardinia.

By the end of the 1700s people started to move from the hinterland to the coasts.

=== Nineteenth century, Twentieth century and today ===
During the nineteenth century the [[Episcopal see|bishop's see]] was transferred from the city of Olbia to the city of Tempio, which also became a district's capital.

In the second half of the 20th century, [[tourism]] increased greatly, especially in the areas of [[Costa Smeralda]], [[Santa Teresa di Gallura]] and [[San Teodoro, Sardinia|San Teodoro]].
Today, Gallura has the highest capital income in all of Sardinia.

=== Ecclesiastical history ===
The region's original Roman bishopric, the [[Diocese of Fausania]] (P(h)ausania), founded no later than the 5th century (tradition says by the 3rd century saint Simplicius), of disputed location ([[Olbia]], [[Tempio Pausania]] or Posano) perished under Byzantine rule, probably in the 8th century.

It was restored under the name of Gallura in 1070, renamed Civita after its see (the medieval name of Olbia) and from 1506 held in personal union with the [[Diocese of Ampurias]], but no later than the 12th century a second bishopric was established, the [[Diocese of Galtelli]].

== Demographics ==
Gallura has a population of 143,921 people; the [[Sardinians]] from this area are called Galluresi ({{lang-sdn|Gadduresi}}). The [[population density]] has remarkably increased in small centers along the eastern coast and in the cities of [[Arzachena]] and Olbia. The population density of 12 municipalities out of 26 has however decreased (-4%) in centers located in the country -side and on the mountains. This tendency depends on the increase of the seaside tourism.

In general, Sardinia represents the Italian region with the lowest [[fertility rate]] (1.087 births per woman), and the region with the second lowest [[birth rate]]. 

===Main towns===
; Olbia
[[Olbia]] (medieval Civita) is a town of approximately 55,000 inhabitants. It represents the city with the highest population density of the entire Gallura. In 2005 it became an [[administrative capital]] together with Tempio-Pausania. They form the province called Olbia-Tempio.
Founded in 350 BC, it used to be one of the most important trade areas of the Mediterranean Sea.
Today, it represents the economic center of Sardinia due to its [[airport]], its [[seaport]] and also to its closeness to the famous Costa Smeralda tourist area.

; Tempio Pausania
[[Tempio Pausania]] is a town of 13,800 inhabitants. Together with Olbia, it is the administrative capital of the province Olbia-Tempio.
Founded around 250 BC, Tempio Pausania is located 560m above the sea level. It represents  both the geographical and the cultural capital of Gallura. Every year, thousands of tourists come to visit Tempio Pausania to assist to the characteristic carnevale (carnival), which takes place at the end of February.

; Arzachena
[[Arzachena]] is a town of 12,080 inhabitants. 
It represents the administrative capital of the Costa Smeralda tourist area. Founded in 1961 by the prince Karim Aga Khan, Costa Smeralda represents the most exclusive tourist area of Gallura.
Arzachena is also famous for its archeology. Its archeological sites include the LiMuri Tomba dei Giganti (Giants’ Grave).

; La Maddalena
[[La Maddalena]] is part of an archipelago called Arcipelago della Maddalena. It is situated in the [[Straits of Bonifacio]], which divide Sardinia from Corsica. La Maddalena represents the largest town of this archipelago, which includes the islands of Caprera, S. Stefano, Spargi, Budelli, S. Maria and Razzoli. La Maddalena represents an important tourist site in Gallura and the island of Caprera is famous for being the residence of the Italian revolutionary [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]].

== Economy ==
[[File:Santa Teresa di Gallura 2009.jpg|thumb|right|[[Santa Teresa di Gallura]]]]
The economy of Gallura is based mostly on tourism and hospitality due to the presence of Costa Smeralda and other world-famous sea sites.
The primary sector is not as important as in the rest of Sardinia. It is based mostly on [[wine]] production. Also [[sheep]] breeding, dairy production, and [[poultry]] farm are relevant.
The secondary sector is quite important. It is mostly based on cork work and mineral processing of granite. In fact, it is easy to find cork oaks in many parts of the region and the whole area is rich in granite, especially in vicinity of Monte Limbara. Cork production is one of the main economic activity in the interior, while on the coasts are developed fish factories and shipyards.

===Volume 2===
Arriving in [[Athens]], Lionel learns that Raymond had been captured by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], and negotiates his return to Greece. Shortly after this, Lionel and Raymond both return to the Greek army and fight their way to [[Constantinople]]. After a decisive battle near the city's gates, Lionel discovers Evadne, dying of wounds received fighting in the war. Before she dies, Evadne prophesies Raymond's death, a prophecy which confirms Raymond's own suspicions. Raymond's intention to enter the city causes dissension and desertion amongst the army because of reports of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]]. Raymond enters the city alone to find that it has been seemingly deserted, and soon dies in an explosion, the result of a trap laid by the Turks. He is taken to a site near Athens for burial. Perdita refuses to leave Greece, but Lionel drugs her and brings her aboard a steamship, believing it to be in the best interests of Clara. Perdita awakens and, distraught by Raymond's death, drowns herself by throwing herself overboard.

In 2092, while Lionel and Adrian attempt to return their lives to normality, the plague continues to spread across Europe and the Americas, and reports of [[solar eclipse|a black sun]] cause panic throughout the world, and [[storm surge]]s flood coastal towns across Europe. At first, England is thought to be safe, but soon the plague reaches even there. Ryland, recently elected [[Lord Protector]], is unprepared for the plague, and flees northward, later dying alone amidst a stockpile of provisions. Adrian takes command and is largely effective at maintaining order and humanity in England, although the plague rages on summer after summer. Ships arrive in Ireland carrying survivors from America, who lawlessly plunder Ireland and Scotland before invading England. Adrian raises a military force against them and ultimately is able to resolve the situation peacefully.

===Volume 3===
The few remaining survivors decide to abandon England in search of an easier climate. On the eve of their departure to [[Dover]], Lionel receives a letter from Lucy Martin, who was unable to join the exiles because of her mother's illness. Lionel and Idris travel through a snowstorm to assist Lucy, but Idris, weak from years of stress and maternal fears, dies along the way during the fierce weather. Lionel brings her body to Windsor Castle, interring her in [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|St George's Chapel]], and is met by the Countess, who reconciles with Lionel at Idris' tomb. Lionel recovers Lucy (whose mother has died), and the party reaches [[Dover]] en route to France.

In France, Adrian discovers that the earlier emigrants have divided into factions, amongst them a fanatical religious sect led by a false [[messiah]] who claims that his followers will be saved from disease. Adrian unites most of the factions, but this latter group declares violent opposition to Adrian. Lionel sneaks into Paris, where the cult has settled, to try to rescue Juliet. She refuses to leave because the impostor has her baby, but she helps Lionel to escape after the impostor's followers imprison him. Later, when Juliet's baby sickens, Juliet discovers that the impostor has been hiding the effects of the plague from his followers. She is killed warning the other followers, after which the impostor commits suicide, and his followers return to the main body of exiles at [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]].

The exiles travel towards [[Switzerland]], hoping to spend the summer in a colder climate less favourable to the plague. By the time they reach Switzerland, however, all but four (Lionel, Adrian, Clara, and Evelyn) have died. The four spend a few relatively happy seasons at [[Switzerland]], [[Milan]], and [[Como]] before Evelyn dies of [[typhus]]. The survivors attempt to sail across the [[Adriatic Sea]] from [[Venice]] to [[Greece]], but a sudden storm destroys the boat and drowns Clara and Adrian. Lionel swims to shore at [[Ravenna]]. Fearing that is the last human left on Earth, Lionel follows the [[Apennine Mountains]] to [[Rome]], befriending a [[sheepdog]] along the way. A year passes without anyone else entering Rome, and Lionel resolves to leave with his dog and live the rest of his life as a wanderer of the depopulated continents of Africa and Asia in search of other survivors. The story ends in the year 2100.

==Themes==

===Biographical elements===
Many of the central characters are wholly or partially based upon Shelley's acquaintances.&lt;ref&gt;Peck, Walter E. &quot;The Biographical Elements in the Novels of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley.&quot; ''PMLA''. XXXCIII, 1923&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley had been forbidden by her father-in-law, Sir [[Timothy Shelley]], from publishing a biography of her husband, so she memorialised him, amongst others, in ''The Last Man''. The [[utopia]]n Adrian, Earl of Windsor, who leads his followers in search of a natural paradise and dies when his boat sinks in a storm, is a fictional portrait of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], although other minor characters such as Merrival bear traces of Percy as well.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, ''An Introduction'', 74; Lokke, 119; Luke xi–xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;
Lord Raymond, who leaves England to fight for the Greeks and dies in [[Constantinople]], is based on [[Lord Byron]]. The novel expresses Mary Shelley's pain at the loss of her community of the &quot;Elect&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Paley, Introduction to ''The Last Man'', viii. Mary Shelley used this term in a letter of 3 October 1824.&lt;/ref&gt; as she called them,&lt;ref&gt;Paley, Introduction to ''The Last Man'', viii. &quot;The last man!&quot; Mary Shelley wrote in her journal in May 1824. &quot;Yes I may well describe that solitary being's feelings, feeling myself the last relic of a beloved race, my companions extinct before me&quot;. Paley, Introduction to ''The Last Man'', vii–viii.&lt;/ref&gt; and Lionel Verney has been seen as an outlet for her feelings of loss and boredom following their deaths and the deaths of her children.&lt;ref&gt;Luke xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears that Shelley found inspiration for the title of her novel in [[Jean-Baptiste Cousin de Grainville]]'s ''[[Le Dernier Homme]]'' (1805), translated into English in 1806 as ''Omegarus and Syderia''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/14/angenot14art.htm Science Fiction in France before Verne]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Failure of romantic political ideals===
''The Last Man'' not only laments the loss of Shelley's friends, but also questions the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] political ideals for which they stood.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, Introduction to ''The Last Man'', xvi; Lokke, 117.&lt;/ref&gt; In a sense, the plague is metaphorical, since the revolutionary idyll of the élite group is corroded from within by flaws of human nature.&lt;ref&gt;Lokke, 128–29.&lt;/ref&gt; As literary scholar Kari Lokke writes, &quot;in its refusal to place humanity at the center of the universe, its questioning of our privileged position in relation to nature, then, ''The Last Man'' constitutes a profound and prophetic challenge to Western humanism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lokke, 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Mary Shelley, in making references to the failure of the [[French Revolution]] and the [[William Godwin|Godwinian]], [[Mary Wollstonecraft|Wollstonecraftian]], and [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] responses to it, &quot;attacks Enlightenment faith in the inevitability of progress through collective efforts&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lokke, 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isolation===
Hugh Luke argues, &quot;By ending her story with the picture of the Earth's solitary inhabitant, she has brought nearly the whole weight of the novel to bear upon the idea that the condition of the individual being is essentially isolated and therefore ultimately [[tragedy|tragic]]&quot; (xvii). Shelley shares this theme of tragic isolation with the poetry of [[Lord Byron]] and [[William Wordsworth]].&lt;ref&gt;Luke xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science and medicine===
Just as her earlier and better-known novel ''Frankenstein'' (1818) engaged with scientific questions of electromagnetism, chemistry, and materialism, ''The Last Man'' finds Shelley again attempting to understand the scope of scientific inquiry. Unlike the earlier novel's warnings about [[Faust]]ian over-reaching, this novel's devastating apocalypse strongly suggests that medicine had become too timid and ultimately come too late.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, &quot;We Must Live Elsewhere,&quot; 240.&lt;/ref&gt; The ineffectual astronomer Merrival, for example, stands in stark contrast to the frighteningly productive Victor Frankenstein. Shelley's construction of Lionel Verney's immunity remains a subject of significant critical debate, but the novel certainly demonstrates a deep understanding of the history of medicine, specifically the development of the smallpox vaccine and the various nineteenth-century theories about the nature of contagion.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, &quot;Romantic Disease Discourse,&quot; 471–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history and reception==
Two editions of ''The Last Man'' were published by [[Henry Colburn]] in London on 23 January 1826,&lt;ref&gt;Introductory Note of The Novels and Selected Works of Mary Shelley, Vol 4, by Nora Crook, Pamela Clemit and Betty T Bennett&lt;/ref&gt; and one edition in Paris in 1826 by [[Giovanni Antonio Galignani|Galignani]]. A pirated edition was printed in America in 1833.&lt;ref&gt;Luke xxi&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Last Man'' received the worst reviews of all of Mary Shelley's novels: most reviewers derided the very theme of lastness, which had become a common one in the previous two decades. Individual reviewers labelled the book &quot;sickening&quot;, criticised its &quot;stupid cruelties&quot;, and called the author's imagination &quot;diseased&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, Introduction to ''The Last Man'', xxi.&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction startled Mary Shelley, who promised her publisher a more popular book next time. Nonetheless, she later spoke of ''The Last Man'' as one of her favourite works.

The novel was not reprinted until 1965. In the 20th century it received new critical attention, perhaps because the notion of lastness had become more relevant.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, Introduction to ''The Last Man'', xxii–xxiii.&lt;!--which edition? Geez, learn how to cite--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptation==

In 2008, director James Arnett adapted the book into a film of the same name.

==Plot==
Set in the late 1960s and 1970s, the story describes the efforts of [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] Bishop Timothy Archer, who must cope with the [[theology|theological]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] implications of the newly discovered [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] [[Zadokite]] scroll fragments.  The character of Bishop Archer is loosely based on the controversial, iconoclastic Episcopal Bishop [[James Pike]], who in 1969 died of exposure while exploring the [[Judean Desert]] near the [[Dead Sea]] in the [[West Bank]].

As the novel opens, it is 1980. On the day that [[John Lennon]] is shot and killed, Angel Archer visits the [[houseboat]] of Edgar Barefoot, (a [[guru]] based on [[Alan Watts]]), and reflects on the lives of her deceased relatives. During the sixties, she was married to Jeff Archer, son of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] Bishop of California Timothy Archer. She introduced Kirsten Lundborg, a friend, to her father-in law, and the two began an affair. Kirsten has a son, Bill, from a previous relationship, who has [[schizophrenia]], although he is knowledgeable as an [[automobile]] [[mechanic]]. Tim is already being investigated for his allegedly [[heresy|heretical]] views about the [[Holy Ghost]].

Jeff commits [[suicide]] due to his romantic obsession with Kirsten. However, after [[poltergeist]] activity, he manifests to Tim and Kirsten at a [[seance]], also attended by Angel. Angel is skeptical about the efficacy of [[astrology]], and believes that the unfolding [[Existentialism|existential]] situation of Tim and Kirsten is akin to [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s [[Germany|German]] [[Romanticism]] era masterpiece, the [[Wallenstein (play)|Wallenstein trilogy]] (insofar as their credulity reflects the loss of rational belief in contemporary consensual reality).

The three are told that Kirsten and Tim will die. As predicted, Kirsten loses her [[remission (medicine)|remission]] from [[cancer]], and also commits suicide after a [[barbiturate]] overdose. Tim travels to [[Israel]] to investigate whether or not a [[psychotropic]] [[mushroom]] was associated with the [[resurrection]], but his car stalls, he becomes disoriented, falls from a cliff, and  dies in the [[desert]].

On the houseboat, Angel is reunited with Bill, Kirsten's son who has [[schizophrenia]]. He claims to have Tim's reincarnated spirit within him, but is soon institutionalized. Angel agrees to care for Bill, in return for a rare record (''[[Koto Music]]'' by [[Kimio Eto]]) that Edgar offers her.

''The Transmigration of Timothy Archer'' is one of Dick's most overtly philosophical and intellectual works. While Dick's novels usually employ [[multiperspectivity|multiple narrators]] or an omniscient perspective, this story is told in the [[first person narrative|first person]] by a single narrator: Angel Archer, Bishop Archer's daughter-in-law.

==Characters==
*Angel Archer: Narrator, manager of a Berkeley record store, widow of Jeff Archer.
*Timothy Archer: Bishop of California; father of the late Jeff Archer and father-in-law of Angel. Dies in Israel, searching for psychotropic mushroom connected with Zadokite sect. Based on [[James Albert Pike]], Dick's personal friend, who was an American Episcopalian bishop.
*Kirsten Lundborg: Timothy Archer's secretary and lover. Dies from barbiturate overdose after loss of remission from cancer.
*Bill Lundborg: Kirsten's son who has [[schizophrenia]], and who is obsessed with cars.
*Edgar Barefoot: Houseboat guru, radio personality, lecturer. Based on [[Alan Watts]].
*Jeff Archer: Son of Timothy Archer, and deceased husband of Angel. A [[professional student]] who was romantically obsessed with Kirsten.

==Other works==
''The Transmigration of Timothy Archer'' is thematically related to Dick's unfinished [[VALIS trilogy]] of novels:

* ''[[VALIS]]'' (1981)
* ''[[The Divine Invasion]]'' (1981)
* ''[[The Owl in Daylight]]''

The novel has been included in several omnibus editions of the trilogy as a stand-in for the unwritten final volume. ''The Transmigration of Timothy Archer'' was not intended by Dick to be part of the trilogy; however, the book fits with the two finished volumes and Dick himself called the three novels a trilogy, saying &quot;the three do form a trilogy constellating around a basic theme.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philipkdick.com/media_twilightzone.html |title=Philip K.

'''Ukonline''' was a &quot;portal&quot; website of the [[Her Majesty's Government|UK Government]] linking to public sector information, and was originally called me.gov. The site was launched in 2001 and maintained by the [[Office of the e-Envoy]] (later the e-Government Unit, part of the [[Cabinet Office]]). It replaced the earlier single online government website, the Government Information Service (GIS) hosted at open.gov.uk, which had been established in November 1994. The need for an updated single government website had been identified in a 1999 Portal Feasibility Study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ctpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Portal-Feasibility-Study-19991.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006161931/http://ctpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Portal-Feasibility-Study-19991.pdf |archive-date=2014-10-06 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; prepared by PA Consulting for the Central IT Unit (CITU) in the Cabinet Office.

The site featured news, links, and search facilities connecting together much of the government's web presence, though later this pan-government search facility was removed. Visitors to the site were able to search for information on a variety of topics (for example, agriculture, finance and health) and retrieve a list of government departments that were able to provide them with more information. It was also possible to do such things as apply for a [[passport]], buy a [[television licence]], register to vote or complete and send a Tax Self Assessment form, but only if users left the website, as they could not actually perform the transaction on UKonline.

The site was replaced in 2004 by the service [[Directgov]], which was then replaced in 2012 by the service [[Gov.uk]].

There is still a network of community internet access points called the UK Online Centres network, run by the [[Tinder Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ukonlinecentres.com/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-08-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704040546/https://www.ukonlinecentres.com/ |archive-date=2018-07-04 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an English poet.

==Life and career==
Jennings was born in [[Boston, Lincolnshire]].  When she was six, her family moved to [[Oxford]], where she remained for the rest of her life.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Couzyn&quot;&gt;Couzyn, Jeni (1985) ''Contemporary Women Poets''. Bloodaxe, pp. 98-100.&lt;/ref&gt; There she later attended [[St Anne's College, Oxford|St Anne's College]].  After graduation, she became a writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoet.do?poetId=1554|title=Elizabeth Jennings - poetryarchive.org|website=www.poetryarchive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote =&lt;poem&gt;
It was a yellow voice, a high, shrill treble in the nursery
White always and high, I remember it so,
White cupboard, off-white table, mugs, dolls’ faces
And I was four or five. The garden could have been
Miles away. We were taken down to the green
Asparagus beds, the cut lawn, and the smell of it
Comes each summer after rain when white returns. Our bird,
A canary called Peter, sang behind bars. The black and white cat
Curled and snoozed by the fire and danger was far away.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Jennings' early poetry was published in journals such as ''Oxford Poetry'', ''New English Weekly'', ''The Spectator'', ''Outposts'' and ''Poetry Review'', but her first book was not published until she was 27. The lyrical poets she cited as having influenced her were [[Gerard Manley Hopkins|Hopkins]], [[W. H. Auden|Auden]], [[Robert Graves|Graves]] and [[Edwin Muir|Muir]].&lt;ref Name=&quot;Couzyn&quot;/&gt; Her second book, ''A Way of Looking'', won the Somerset Maugham award and marked a turning point, as the prize money allowed her to spend nearly three months in [[Rome]], which was a revelation. It brought a new dimension to her religious belief and inspired her imagination.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Couzyn&quot;/&gt;

Regarded as traditionalist rather than an innovator, Jennings is known for her lyric poetry and mastery of form.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Couzyn&quot;/&gt;  Her work displays a simplicity of metre and rhyme shared with [[Philip Larkin]], [[Kingsley Amis]] and [[Thom Gunn]], all members of the group of English poets known as [[Movement (literature)|The Movement]].&lt;ref Name=&quot;Couzyn&quot;/&gt; She always made it clear that, whilst her life, which included a spell of severe mental illness, contributed to the themes contained within her work, she did not write explicitly autobiographical poetry. Her deeply held [[Roman Catholicism]] coloured much of her work.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Couzyn&quot;/&gt;

She spent the latter years of her life in Unity House (8 St Andrew's Lane) in Old Headington and died in a care home in [[Bampton, Oxfordshire]]. She is buried in [[Wolvercote Cemetery]], Oxford.

The life and career of &quot;the bag lady of the sonnets&quot;, as tabloid newspapers called her when honoured by the Queen in 1992, were reviewed in 2018 by Dana Gioia, concluding: &quot;Despite her worldly failures, her artistic career was a steady course of achievement. Jennings ranks among the finest British poets of the second half of the twentieth century. She is also England’s best Catholic poet since Gerard Manley Hopkins.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/2018/05/clarify-me-please-god-of-the-galaxies|title=Clarify Me, Please, God of the Galaxies - Dana Gioia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

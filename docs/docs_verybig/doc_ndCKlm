== Geography and climate ==

At an elevation of {{convert|856|m|0|abbr=out}}, the city of Burgos lies in the transition zone between a [[Cool-summer mediterranean|Warm-summer Mediterranean climate]] (Köppen ''Csb'') and an [[Oceanic climate]] (Köppen ''Cfb''), with some [[continental climate|continental]] influence resulting from its distance from the sea and higher altitude.  Burgos' climate features chilly and windy winters, due to altitude and an inland location, which always include snow and temperatures below freezing. Temperature ranges can be extreme and Burgos is drier than Spain's coastal regions, although there is year-round precipitation. Average annual precipitation is {{convert|546|mm|1|abbr=on}} and the average annual relative humidity is 72%. In winter, temperatures very often (almost every day) drop below freezing, often reaching temperatures as low as {{convert|-10|°C|0}}, and snowfalls are common, while the summer months see average high temperatures of {{convert|27.5|C|1}}. The lowest recorded temperature in Burgos was {{convert|-21|C|0}} on 20 January 1885. The highest recorded temperature was {{convert|39|C|0}} on 13 August 1987.

== Main sights ==

Burgos is rich in ancient churches and convents. The three most notable are the cathedral, with its chapel of the Condestables de Castilla (Lords Constable of Castile), the monastery of Las Huelgas and the [[Carthusian]] monastery of Miraflores. Minor notable churches are San Esteban, San Gil (Sancti Aegidii), San Pedro, San Cosme y San Damián, Santiago (Sancti Jacobi), San Lorenzo and San Lesmes (Adelelmi). The Convento de la Merced, occupied by the [[Jesuits]], and the Hospital del Rey are also of historic and architectural interest.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;

Among the other interesting architectural structures, in the walls of the city are the [[Arco de Santa María|gateway of Santa María]], erected for the first entrance of the [[Emperor Charles V]], and the arch of Fernán González.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;

=== Gothic Cathedral ===

{{Main|Burgos Cathedral}}
Construction on Burgos' [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] Cathedral began in 1221 and spanned mainly from the 13th to 15th centuries. It has been declared a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. The west front is flanked by towers terminating in octagonal spires covered with open stonework traceries. The middle section, which serves as an entrance, has three alabaster pilasters, the intercolumnar spaces bearing panel-pictures representing the martyrdom of saints. The façade possesses ornate and fantastic surface decoration.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;

The octagonal chapel of the Condestable, in florid, thus highly sculpted, [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] design, has a roof finished with balustraded turrets, needle-pointed pinnacles and statues. In the lower portion, coats of arms, shields and crouching lions have been worked into the ensemble. The exterior of the sacristy is decorated with carved traceries, figures of angels and armoured knights. The elaborate [[tabernacle]] is composed of two octagonal sections in [[Corinthian style]].&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;

=== Monasterio de las Huelgas ===

{{Main|Las Huelgas}}
The ''Monasterio de las Huelgas Reales'' (Monastery of the Royal Retreats) on the outskirts of the city, was founded in 1180 by king [[Alfonso VIII]], and was begun in a pre-Gothic style, although almost every style has been introduced over many additions. The remarkable cloisters have been described as &quot;unrivalled for beauty both of detail and design, and perhaps unsurpassed by anything in its age and style in any part of Europe&quot; (1911 Encyclopædia Britannica). One cloister has semicircular arches with delicate and varied columns; the other has an ogival style of early Gothic. The interior of the church has enormous columns supporting its magnificent vault; the entrance is modern. This convent historically benefited from extraordinary privileges granted to its abbess by kings and popes.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;

=== Miraflores Charterhouse ===

{{Main|Miraflores Charterhouse}}
The [[Carthusian]] monastery, Miraflores Charterhouse (''Cartuja de Miraflores'') is situated about four kilometres from the historic city center. Among the treasures of the Charterhouse are the wooden statue of [[Bruno of Cologne|St. Bruno]], the wooden choir stalls in the church and the tombs of King [[John II of Castile|Juan II]] and of his spouse, Queen [[Isabella of Portugal, Queen of Castile|Isabella of Portugal]], constructed of marble and with their [[recumbent effigy|recumbent effigies]] sculpted in [[alabaster]]. Around the top frieze are statues of angels in miniature. The French soldiers in the [[Spanish War of Independence]] (1814) mutilated this work, cutting off some of the heads and carrying them away to France.&lt;ref name=Catholic&gt;{{Catholic|wstitle=Burgos|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; King Juan II's daughters by his first wife, heiresses Princessses [[Catherine, Princess of Asturias|Catherine]] and [[Eleanor, Princess of Asturias|Eleanor]] of [[Principality of Asturias|Asturias]], are also buried in the monastery.

'''International University Isabel I of Castile'''

Based in Burgos, it is a new-developed private online university which became operational during 2013. It offers distance and some classroom education. This University has been promoted by Education Campus of Castile and Leon.

The photos below are taken from a view point that requires quite a hike up stairs to El Castillo (the castle). There visitors can see all of Burgos. During special events throughout the year, visitors can see a firework display from that same view point.

== Parks and recreation ==

[[File:Parque El Parral.jpg|thumb|right|Parque El Parral]]
[[File:Paseo Isla Lejanía.JPG|thumb|La Isla]]
Most of the parks in the city of Burgos can be found along the river Arlanzón. Indeed, the banks of the river itself constitute a green corridor along the city. In total, there are nearly 3 square miles (1,878 acres) of parks in Burgos and one tree for every 3 inhabitants.

* '''Parque del Castillo''' (or the Castle Park) is one of the lungs of the city. The city grew from the southern foot of the hill of the castle. Gradually, some of the upper neighborhoods began disappearing. After the destruction of the castle, military installations were established there. In the 1950s, the engineer Jaquotot Mariano, who later became mayor of the city, decided to leave the hill completely bare. Besides the ruins of the castle, this park contains the ''Bird Conservation Center''. It also has play areas for children and exercise. Also, there is a terraced area with gardens and an ornamental fountain. The highlight of the park is the viewpoint from which you get a great view of the city, especially the cathedral. A metal plaque on the rail at the vista point helps to identify the most characteristic places of the city. The park contains the unique view of the city of Burgos from the viewpoint of the Castle.
* '''Fuentes Blancas''' is Burgos' most visited large park extending east from the city along the river Arlanzón. It contains a network of walking and biking paths and includes camping and various outdoor recreational activities.
* '''Paseo del Espolón''' is the tree-lined promenade that is the most emblematic of Burgos. It's situated along the banks of the river Arlanzón, and consists of a landscaped walk that goes from the theater square to the Arc de Santa Maria, passing shops and cafes.
[[File:Summer on the &quot;Paseo del Espolón&quot;.jpg|thumb|300px|center|Summer on the &quot;Paseo del Espolón&quot;]]
* '''Paseo de la Isla''' is another one of Burgos' tree-lined garden walks. It passes by the Palacio de la Isla which served as one of Franco's headquarters during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and is currently the Language Institute of Castilian and Leonese.
* '''Parque de El Parral''' is located at the old &quot;Hospital del Rey&quot;, a former hospital for pilgrims of the &quot;[[Way of St. James|Way of Saint James]]&quot;, now part of the [[University of Burgos]] campus

[[File:Wheat fields in Burgos.jpg|thumb|Wheat fields in the outskirts of Burgos]]

=== Agriculture ===

Wheat is a major crop. The city is surrounded by wheat fields.

=== Secondary sector ===

Burgos is a very industrial city, with a secondary sector widely developed. The city has the biggest industrial park of north Spain, called ''[[Villalonquéjar]]''.

The city is the headquarters of [[Grupo Antolin]], designer and manufacturer of interior automotive components.

It is also the headquarters for south [[Europe]] [[Benteler International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tertiary sector ===

It employs the bigger percentage in the city and is represented by the public sector (production, delivery and allocation of goods and services), due to the capital status.

== Culture ==

The city has a complete culture infrastructure, remarked by the [[Auditorio y Palacio de Congresos de Burgos]], which opened in mid-2012.

=== Language ===

[[Spanish language|Spanish]], also called Castilian, originated in [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] and spread throughout the Crown of Castile's possessions following the [[reconquista]]. It was eventually dispersed throughout the Spanish empire following the conquest and colonization of the Americas, and Spain after the union of the [[Catholic Monarchs]]'s kingdoms being co-spoken with other languages. Of the many different variations and dialects found throughout the world, it's argued that the purest Spanish can be found in the region of Burgos due to the fact that the language first developed here in the 10th-century.

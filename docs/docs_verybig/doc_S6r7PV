== To-do lists ==

Add &lt;nowiki&gt;{{todo}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the top of the talk page of articles for which you can establish some goals, priorities or things to do.

== Always leave something undone ==
The following rule was historically used to help challenge people's preconceptions of what an encyclopedia should be. While in practice it's not something we recommend, it makes for an interesting [[Wikipedia talk:Make omissions explicit|debating point]]:
: Whenever you write a page, never finish it. Always leave something obvious to do: an uncompleted sentence, a question in the text (with a not-too-obscure answer someone can supply), wikied links that are of interest, requests for help from specific other Wikipedians, the beginning of a provocative argument that someone simply ''must'' fill in, etc. The purpose of this rule is to encourage ''others'' to keep working on the wiki.
The counter-argument is that people need no encouragement to edit articles.  They should even think more before editing.  Leaving things so that they deliberately seem unfinished just makes the project look amateurish.  Articles should, as much as possible, be usable and coherent as a whole despite the fact that they will later be expanded. New To-do lists should be used to point people in the right direction regarding future edits.

In the early days of Wikipedia's formation, when there were far fewer articles (~&lt;20,000) it was (and to some degree still is) considered beneficial to establish for new editors the ''mindset of incompleteness;'' to think of Wikipedia as continuously-changing entity rather than a static volume that needs to be made perfect. While now, this seems unnecessary, at the time, it was an important guideline at a time when the concept of wiki was new, and the concept of making an encyclopedia collaboratively was still somewhat in doubt, even by its founders. At that time [[Special:Recentchanges|Recent changes]] was quite slow by today's standards; it was more common to use Recent Changes as a window into current activity on the Wikipedia, viewing most of the day's edits on a single page. Today, RC goes by impossibly fast, and hence other ways of monitoring article development (Watchlists, Various meta-pages, Community pages, kind notes to other editors, etc.) have taken its place.  At that time, making deliberate and obvious errors invited (teased or taunted) others monitoring the RC to make corrections, while today such actions are highly discouraged by [[WP:HOAX]].

[[File:Cuisenaire ten.JPG|thumb|The divisors of 10 illustrated with [[Cuisenaire rods]]: 1, 2, 5, and 10]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''divisor of an integer''' &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, also called a '''factor''' of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, is an [[integer]] &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; that may be multiplied by some integer to produce &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, one also says that &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a '''multiple''' of &lt;math&gt;m.&lt;/math&gt; An integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is '''divisible''' by another integer &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is a divisor of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;; this implies dividing &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; leaves no remainder.

==Definition==
If &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are nonzero integers, and more generally, nonzero elements of an [[integral domain]], it is said that &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; '''divides''' &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is a '''divisor''' of &lt;math&gt;n,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a '''multiple''' of &lt;math&gt;m,&lt;/math&gt; and this is written as
:&lt;math&gt;m \mid n,&lt;/math&gt;
if there exists an integer &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, or an element &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; of the integral domain, such that &lt;math&gt;mk = n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;for instance, {{harvnb|Sims|1984|loc=p. 42}} or {{harvnb|Durbin|1992|loc=p. 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This definition is sometimes extended to include zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Herstein|1986|loc=p. 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not add much to the theory, as 0 does not divide any other number, and every number divides 0. On the other hand, excluding zero from the definition simplifies many statements. Also, in [[ring theory]], an element {{mvar|a}} is called a &quot;[[zero divisor]]&quot; only if it is ''nonzero'' and {{math|1=''ab'' = 0}} for a ''nonzero'' element {{mvar|b}}. Thus, there are no zero divisors among the integers (and by definition no zero divisors in an integral domain).

==General==
Divisors can be [[negative number|negative]] as well as positive, although sometimes the term is restricted to positive divisors. For example, there are six divisors of 4; they are 1, 2, 4, −1, −2, and −4, but only the positive ones (1, 2, and 4) would usually be mentioned.

1 and −1 divide (are divisors of) every integer. Every integer (and its negation) is a divisor of itself. Integers divisible by 2 are called [[even and odd numbers|even]], and integers not divisible by 2 are called [[even and odd numbers|odd]].

1, −1, ''n'' and −''n'' are known as the '''trivial divisors''' of ''n''. A divisor of ''n'' that is not a trivial divisor is known as a '''non-trivial divisor''' (or strict divisor&lt;ref&gt;[https://perso.crans.org/cauderlier/org/ITP17_draft.pdf FoCaLiZe and Dedukti to the Rescue for Proof Interoperability by  Raphael Cauderlier and Catherine Dubois]&lt;/ref&gt;). A non-zero integer with at least one non-trivial divisor is known as a [[composite number]], while the [[Unit (ring theory)|units]] −1 and 1 and [[prime number]]s have no non-trivial divisors.

There are [[divisibility rule]]s that allow one to recognize certain divisors of a number from the number's digits.

==Examples==
[[File:Highly composite numbers.svg|thumb|250px|Plot of the number of divisors of integers from 1 to 1000. [[Prime number]]s have exactly 2 divisors, and [[highly composite number]]s are in bold.]]
*7 is a divisor of 42 because &lt;math&gt;7 \times 6 = 42&lt;/math&gt;, so we can say &lt;math&gt;7 \mid 42&lt;/math&gt;. It can also be said that 42 is '''divisible''' by 7, 42 is a [[multiple (mathematics)|multiple]] of 7, 7 '''divides''' 42, or 7 is a '''factor''' of 42.
*The non-trivial divisors of 6 are 2, &amp;minus;2, 3, &amp;minus;3.
*The positive divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42.
*The [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of all positive divisors of 60, &lt;math&gt;A = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60 \}&lt;/math&gt;, [[Partially ordered set|partially ordered]] by divisibility, has the [[Hasse diagram]]:

[[File:Lattice of the divisibility of 60; factors.svg|center|350px]]

==Further notions and facts==
There are some elementary rules:
* If &lt;math&gt;a \mid b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \mid c&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a \mid c&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. divisibility is a [[transitive relation]].
* If &lt;math&gt;a \mid b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \mid a&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;a = -b&lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt;a \mid b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a \mid c&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; a \mid (b + c)&lt;/math&gt; holds, as does &lt;math&gt; a \mid (b - c)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;math&gt;a \mid b,\, a \mid c \Rightarrow b=ja,\, c=ka \Rightarrow b+c=(j+k)a \Rightarrow a \mid (b+c)&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, &lt;math&gt;a \mid b,\, a \mid c \Rightarrow b=ja,\, c=ka \Rightarrow b-c=(j-k)a \Rightarrow a \mid (b-c)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, if &lt;math&gt;a \mid b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c \mid b&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(a + c) \mid b&lt;/math&gt; does ''not'' always hold (e.g. &lt;math&gt;2\mid6&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;3 \mid 6&lt;/math&gt; but 5 does not divide 6).

If &lt;math&gt;a \mid bc&lt;/math&gt;, and [[greatest common divisor|gcd]]&lt;math&gt;(a, b) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a \mid c&lt;/math&gt;. This is called [[Euclid's lemma]].

If &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a prime number and &lt;math&gt;p \mid ab&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;p \mid a&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;p \mid b&lt;/math&gt;.

A positive divisor of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; which is different from &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''proper divisor''' or an '''aliquot part''' of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. A number that does not evenly divide &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; but leaves a remainder is called an '''aliquant part''' of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

An integer &lt;math&gt;n &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt; whose only proper divisor is 1 is called a [[prime number]]. Equivalently, a prime number is a positive integer that has exactly two positive factors: 1 and itself.

Any positive divisor of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a product of [[prime factor|prime divisor]]s of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; raised to some power. This is a consequence of the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]].

A number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is said to be [[perfect number|perfect]] if it equals the sum of its proper divisors, [[deficient number|deficient]] if the sum of its proper divisors is less than &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, and [[abundant number|abundant]] if this sum exceeds &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

The total number of positive divisors of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a [[multiplicative function]] &lt;math&gt;d(n)&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that when two numbers &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are [[relatively prime]], then &lt;math&gt;d(mn)=d(m)\times d(n)&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, &lt;math&gt;d(42) = 8 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = d(2) \times d(3) \times d(7)&lt;/math&gt;; the eight divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21 and 42. However, the number of positive divisors is not a totally multiplicative function: if the two numbers &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; share a common divisor, then it might not be true that &lt;math&gt;d(mn)=d(m)\times d(n)&lt;/math&gt;. The sum of the positive divisors of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is another multiplicative function &lt;math&gt;\sigma (n)&lt;/math&gt; (e.g. &lt;math&gt;\sigma (42) = 96 = 3 \times 4 \times 8 = \sigma (2) \times \sigma (3) \times \sigma (7) = 1+2+3+6+7+14+21+42&lt;/math&gt;). Both of these functions are examples of [[divisor function]]s.

{{anchor|number_of_divisors_formula}}
If the [[prime factorization]] of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt; n = p_1^{\nu_1} \, p_2^{\nu_2} \cdots p_k^{\nu_k} &lt;/math&gt;

then the number of positive divisors of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; d(n) = (\nu_1 + 1) (\nu_2 + 1) \cdots (\nu_k + 1), &lt;/math&gt;
and each of the divisors has the form

:&lt;math&gt; p_1^{\mu_1} \, p_2^{\mu_2} \cdots p_k^{\mu_k} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; 0 \le \mu_i \le \nu_i &lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;1 \le i \le k.&lt;/math&gt;

For every natural &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d(n) &lt; 2 \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;d(1)+d(2)+ \cdots +d(n) = n \ln n + (2 \gamma -1) n + O(\sqrt{n}).&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; is [[Euler–Mascheroni constant]].
One interpretation of this result is that a randomly chosen positive integer ''n'' has an average
number of divisors of about &lt;math&gt;\ln n&lt;/math&gt;. However, this is a result from the contributions of [[highly composite number|numbers with &quot;abnormally many&quot; divisors]].

==In abstract algebra==
In definitions that include 0, the relation of divisibility turns the set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; of [[non-negative]] integers into a [[partially ordered set]]: a [[lattice (order)|complete distributive lattice]]. The largest element of this lattice is 0 and the smallest is 1. The meet operation '''∧''' is given by the [[greatest common divisor]] and the join operation '''∨''' by the [[least common multiple]]. This lattice is isomorphic to the [[duality (order theory)|dual]] of the [[lattice of subgroups]] of the infinite [[cyclic group]] [[integer|&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;]].

In [[mathematics]], '''Pascal's triangle''' is a [[triangular array]] of the [[binomial coefficient]]s. In much of the [[Western world]], it is named after the French mathematician [[Blaise Pascal]], although other [[mathematician]]s studied it centuries before him in [[India]],&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Winternitz, ''History of Indian Literature'', Vol. III&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iran|Persia]] (Iran),&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Coolidge, ''The Story of the Binomial Theorem'', [[American Mathematical Monthly|Amer. Math. Monthly]], Vol. 56, No. 3 (Mar., 1949), pp. 147–157&lt;/ref&gt; [[China]], [[Germany]], and [[Italy]].&lt;ref name=roots&gt;{{cite book |author=Peter Fox |title=Cambridge University Library: the great collections |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xxlgKP5thL8C&amp;pg=PA13 |year=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-62647-7 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rows of Pascal's triangle are conventionally enumerated starting with row ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 at the top (the 0th row). The entries in each row are numbered from the left beginning with ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and are usually staggered relative to the numbers in the adjacent rows. The triangle may be constructed in the following manner: In row 0 (the topmost row), there is a unique nonzero entry 1.  Each entry of each subsequent row is constructed by adding the number above and to the left with the number above and to the right, treating blank entries as 0. For example, the initial number in the first (or any other) row is 1 (the sum of 0 and 1), whereas the numbers 1 and 3 in the third row are added to produce the number 4 in the fourth row.

The entry in the ''n''th row and ''k''th column of Pascal's triangle is denoted &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n}{k}&lt;/math&gt;.  For example, the unique nonzero entry in the topmost row is &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{0}{0} = 1&lt;/math&gt;.  With this notation, the construction of the previous paragraph may be written as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; {n \choose k} = {n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}&lt;/math&gt;,

for any non-negative integer ''n'' and any integer ''k'' between 0 and ''n'', inclusive.&lt;ref&gt;The binomial coefficient &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle {n \choose k}&lt;/math&gt; is conventionally set to zero if ''k'' is either less than zero or greater than ''n''.&lt;/ref&gt;  This recurrence for the binomial coefficients is known as [[Pascal's rule]].

Pascal's triangle has higher [[dimension]]al generalizations. The three-dimensional version is called ''[[Pascal's pyramid]]'' or ''Pascal's tetrahedron'', while the general versions are called ''[[Pascal's simplex|Pascal's simplices]]''.

The pattern of numbers that forms Pascal's triangle was known well before Pascal's time. Pascal innovated many previously unattested uses of the triangle's numbers, uses he described comprehensively in the earliest known mathematical [[treatise]] to be specially devoted to the triangle, his ''Traité du triangle arithmétique'' (1654; published 1665). Centuries before, discussion of the numbers had arisen in the context of [[Ancient India|Indian]] studies of [[combinatorics]] and of binomial numbers and the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]' study of [[figurate numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/research/pascals-triangle-wom/ Pascal's triangle | World of Mathematics Summary]&lt;/ref&gt;

From later commentary, it appears that the binomial coefficients and the additive formula for generating them, &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n}{r}=\tbinom{n-1}{r}+\tbinom{n-1}{r-1}&lt;/math&gt;, were known to [[Pingala]] in or before the 2nd century BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;edwards&quot;&gt;A.

Halayudha also explained obscure references to ''Meru-prastaara'', the '''Staircase of [[Mount Meru]]''', giving the first surviving description of the arrangement of these numbers into a triangle.&lt;ref name=&quot;ed-cam&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ZawairaHitchcock2008p237&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alexander Zawaira|author2=Gavin Hitchcock|title=A Primer for Mathematics Competitions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A21T73sqZ3AC&amp;pg=PA237|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-156170-2|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; In approximately 850, the [[Jain]] mathematician [[Mahāvīra (mathematician)|Mahāvīra]] gave a different formula for the binomial coefficients, using multiplication, equivalent to the modern formula &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n}{r}=\tfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ed-cam&quot;/&gt; In 1068, four columns of the first sixteen rows were given by the mathematician [[Bhattotpala]], who was the first recorded mathematician to equate the additive and multiplicative formulas for these numbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;ed-cam&quot;/&gt;

===Solar sails===
{{main|Solar sail}}
Solar sailing, an experimental method of [[spacecraft propulsion]], uses radiation pressure from the Sun as a motive force. The idea of interplanetary travel by light was mentioned by [[Jules Verne]] in ''From the Earth to the Moon''.

A sail reflects about 90% of the incident radiation.  The 10% that is absorbed is radiated away from both surfaces, with the proportion emitted from the unlit surface depending on the thermal conductivity of the sail.  A sail has curvature, surface irregularities, and other minor factors that affect its performance.

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ([[JAXA]]) has successfully unfurled a solar sail in space which has already succeeded in propelling its payload with the [[IKAROS]] project.

==Cosmic effects of radiation pressure==

Radiation pressure has had a major effect on the development of the cosmos, from the birth of the universe to ongoing formation of stars and shaping of clouds of dust and gasses on a wide range of scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Karel Velan|first=A.|chapter=The Birth of the First Generation of Stars|date=1992|pages=267–278|publisher=Springer US|isbn=9781468460322|doi=10.1007/978-1-4684-6030-8_22|title=The Multi-Universe Cosmos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The early universe===

The [[photon epoch]] is a phase when the energy of the universe was dominated by photons, between 10 seconds and 380,000 years after the [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The early universe|date=1988|publisher=D. Reidel|others=Unruh, W. G., Semenoff, G. W., North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Scientific Affairs Division.|isbn=9027726191|location=Dordrecht|oclc=16684785}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Galaxy formation and evolution===
[[File:Pillars 2014 HST denoise 0.6 12.jpg|thumb|The ''Pillars of Creation'' clouds within the [[Eagle Nebula]] shaped by radiation pressure and stellar winds.]]The process of [[galaxy formation and evolution]] began early in the history of the cosmos. Observations of the early universe strongly suggest that objects grew from bottom-up (i.e., smaller objects merging to form larger ones). As stars are thereby formed and become sources of electromagnetic radiation, radiation pressure from the stars becomes a factor in the dynamics of remaining [[Circumstellar disc|circumstellar]] material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Galaxy formation|last=Longair, Malcolm S., 1941-|date=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783540734772|oclc=212409895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clouds of dust and gases===
The [[gravitational compression]] of clouds of dust and gases is strongly influenced by radiation pressure, especially when the condensations lead to star births.  The larger young stars forming within the compressed clouds emit intense levels of radiation that shift the clouds, causing either dispersion or condensations in nearby regions, which influences birth rates in those nearby regions.

===Clusters of stars===
&lt;!--[[File:M92 arp 750pix.jpg|thumb|250px|Star cluster [[Messier 92]].]]--&gt;
Stars predominantly form in regions of large clouds of dust and gases, giving rise to [[star cluster]]s.  Radiation pressure from the member stars eventually disperses the clouds, which can have a profound effect on the evolution of the cluster.

Many [[open cluster]]s are inherently unstable, with a small enough mass that the [[escape velocity]] of the system is lower than the average [[velocity]] of the constituent stars. These clusters will rapidly disperse within a few million years. In many cases, the stripping away of the gas from which the cluster formed by the radiation pressure of the hot young stars reduces the cluster mass enough to allow rapid dispersal.[[File:David A. Aguilar's Red Dwarf Stars.jpg|thumb|A protoplanetary disk with a cleared central region (artist's conception).]]
===Star formation===

[[Star formation]] is the process by which dense regions within [[molecular cloud]]s in [[interstellar space]] collapse to form [[star]]s. As a branch of [[astronomy]], star formation includes the study of the [[interstellar medium]] and [[giant molecular cloud]]s (GMC) as precursors to the star formation process, and the study of [[protostar]]s and [[young stellar object]]s as its immediate products.  Star formation theory, as well as accounting for the formation of a single star, must also account for the statistics of [[binary star]]s and the [[initial mass function]].

===Stellar planetary systems===
[[Planetary system]]s are generally believed to form as part of the same process that results in [[star formation]]. A [[protoplanetary disk]] forms by gravitational collapse of a [[molecular cloud]], called a [[solar nebula]],  and then evolves into a planetary system by collisions and gravitational capture. Radiation pressure can clear a region in the immediate vicinity of the star. As the formation process continues, radiation pressure continues to play a role in affecting the distribution of matter.  In particular, dust and grains can spiral into the star or escape the stellar system under the action of radiation pressure.[[File:Comet Hale-Bopp 1995O1.jpg|thumb|[[Comet Hale–Bopp]] (C/1995 O1). Radiation pressure and solar wind effects on the dust and gas tails are clearly seen.]]
===Stellar interiors===

In [[star|stellar]] interiors the temperatures are very high. Stellar models predict a temperature of 15&amp;nbsp;MK in the center of the [[Sun]], and at the cores of [[supergiant]] stars the temperature may exceed 1&amp;nbsp;GK. As the radiation pressure scales as the fourth power of the temperature, it becomes important at these high temperatures. In the Sun, radiation pressure is still quite small when compared to the gas pressure. In the heaviest non-degenerate stars, radiation pressure is the dominant pressure component.&lt;ref&gt;Dale A. Ostlie and Bradley W. Carroll, ''An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics'' (2nd edition), page 341, Pearson, San Francisco, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comets===
Solar radiation pressure strongly affects [[comet tail]]s.  Solar heating causes gases to be released from the [[comet nucleus]], which also carry away dust grains.  Radiation pressure and [[solar wind]] then drive the dust and gases away from the Sun's direction.  The gases form a generally straight tail, while slower moving dust particles create a broader, curving tail.

== Laser applications of radiation pressure==

=== Optical tweezers===
{{Main|Optical tweezers}}
[[Laser]]s can be used as a source of monochromatic light with wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. With a set of lenses, one can focus the laser beam to a point that is &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; in diameter (or &lt;math&gt;r = \frac{\lambda}{2}&lt;/math&gt;).

The radiation pressure of a 30&amp;nbsp;mW laser of 1064&amp;nbsp;nm can therefore be computed as follows:

&lt;math&gt;A_{rea} = \pi\left(\frac{\lambda}{2}\right)^2 \approx 10^{-12} \text{ m}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;F_{orce} = \frac{P_{ower}} {c} = \frac{30 \text{ mW}} {299792458 \text{ m/s}} \approx 10^{-10} \text{ N}  &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P_{ressure} = \frac{F_{orce}} {A_{rea}} \approx \frac{10^{-10} \text{ N}} {10^{-12} \text{ m}^2} = 100 \text{ Pascal}&lt;/math&gt;

This is used to trap or levitate particles in [[optical tweezers]].

=== Light-matter interactions===
{{Main|Cavity optomechanics|Laser cooling}}
[[File:Cavity Optomechanics.png|thumb|242x242px|In this optomechanical cavity, light is trapped and enhanced between two mirrors. One of the mirrors is attached to a spring and can move. The radiation pressure force of the light circulating in the cavity can damp or amplify the oscillation of the mirror on the spring.]]
The reflection of a laser pulse from the surface of an elastic solid can give rise to various types of elastic waves that propagate inside the solid or liquid. In other words, the light can excite and/or amplify motion of, and in, materials. This is the subject of study in the field of optomechanics. The weakest waves are generally those that are generated by the radiation pressure acting during the reflection of the light. Such light-pressure-induced elastic waves have for example observed inside an ultrahigh-reflectivity [[dielectric mirror]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Požar |first1=T. |last2=Možina |first2=J. |title=Measurement of Elastic Waves Induced by the Reflection of Light. |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=111 |issue=18 |page=185501 |doi=10.1103/Physrevlett.111.185501|pmid=24237537 |year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These waves are the most basic fingerprint of a light-solid matter interaction on the macroscopic scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Požar |first1=T. |last2=Laloš |first2=J. |last3=Babnik |first3=A. |last4=Petkovšek |first4=R. |last5=Bethune-Waddell |first5=M. |last6=Chau |first6=K.

This serves the purpose of gravely enhancing the [[Intensity (physics)|power]] of the light, and the radiation pressure it can exert on objects and materials.

Opposite to exciting or amplifying motion, light can also damp the motion of objects. [[Laser cooling]] is a method of cooling materials very close to [[absolute zero]] by converting some of material's motional energy into light. [[Kinetic energy|Motional energy]] and [[thermal energy]] of the material are synonyms here, because they represent the energy associated with [[Brownian motion]] of the material. Atoms traveling towards a laser light source perceive a [[doppler effect]] tuned to the absorption frequency of the target element. The radiation pressure on the atom slows movement in a particular direction until the Doppler effect moves out of the frequency range of the element, causing an overall cooling effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Aspelmeyer|first1=Markus|last2=Kippenberg|first2=Tobias J.|last3=Marquardt|first3=Florian|date=2014-12-30|title=Cavity optomechanics|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=86|issue=4|pages=1391–1452|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.86.1391|arxiv=1303.0733|s2cid=119252645}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Cavity-optomechanical-spring-sensing-of-single-molecules-ncomms12311-s2.ogv|thumb|376x376px|In this optomechanical system, the radiation pressure force is leveraged to detect a single [[Protein|protein molecule]].

It is used in structural materials, microelectronics (as an electrical insulator), and as components in the food and pharmaceutical industries.

Inhaling finely divided crystalline silica is toxic  and can lead to severe inflammation of the [[lung]] tissue, [[silicosis]], [[bronchitis]], [[lung cancer]], and [[systemic autoimmune disease]]s, such as [[lupus]] and [[rheumatoid arthritis]].

==Structure==
[[File:SiO2repeat.png|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Structural motif found in α-quartz, but also found in almost all forms of silicon dioxide]]
[[File:Quartzrn.PNG|thumb|Relationship between refractive index and density for some SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; forms&lt;ref name=mel/&gt;]]
In the majority of [[silicate]]s, the silicon atom shows [[tetrahedral coordination geometry|tetrahedral coordination]], with four oxygen atoms surrounding a central Si atom. The most common example is seen in the quartz [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]]s.
It is a 3 dimensional network solid in which each silicon atom is covalently bonded in a tetrahedral manner to 4 oxygen atoms.

For example, in the unit cell of α-quartz, the central tetrahedron shares all four of its corner O atoms, the two face-centered tetrahedra share two of their corner O atoms, and the four edge-centered tetrahedra share just one of their O atoms with other SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra. This leaves a net average of 12 out of 24 total vertices for that portion of the seven SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra that are considered to be a part of the unit cell for silica ([http://www.mindat.org/min-3337.html see 3-D Unit Cell]).

SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a number of distinct crystalline forms ([[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]]s) in addition to amorphous forms. With the exception of [[stishovite]] and fibrous silica, all of the crystalline forms involve tetrahedral SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; units linked together by shared vertices. Silicon–oxygen bond lengths vary between the various crystal forms; for example in α-quartz the bond length is 161 pm, whereas in α-tridymite it is in the range 154–171 pm. The Si-O-Si angle also varies between a low value of 140° in α-tridymite, up to 180° in β-tridymite. In α-quartz, the Si-O-Si angle is 144°.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiberg&amp;Holleman&quot;/&gt;

Fibrous silica has a structure similar to that of [[Silicon sulfide|SiS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] with chains of edge-sharing SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra. Stishovite, the higher-pressure form, in contrast, has a [[rutile]]-like structure where silicon is 6-coordinate. The density of stishovite is 4.287&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which compares to α-quartz, the densest of the low-pressure forms, which has a density of 2.648&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Greenwood&quot;/&gt; The difference in density can be ascribed to the increase in coordination as the six shortest Si-O bond lengths in stishovite (four Si-O bond lengths of 176 pm and two others of 181 pm) are greater than the Si-O bond length (161 pm) in α-quartz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Structural Inorganic Chemistry|vauthors=Wells AF|publisher=Oxford Science Publications|year=1984|isbn=9780198553700}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The change in the coordination increases the ionicity of the Si-O bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|display-authors=3|vauthors=Kirfel A, Krane HG, Blaha P, Schwarz K, Lippmann T|year=2001|title=Electron-density distribution in stishovite, SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: a new high-energy synchrotron-radiation study|journal=[[Acta Crystallographica#Acta Crystallographica Section A: Foundations and Advances|Acta Crystallogr.

The only stable form under normal conditions is [[alpha quartz]], in which crystalline silicon dioxide is usually encountered. In nature, impurities in crystalline α-quartz can give rise to colors (see list).  The high-temperature minerals, [[cristobalite]] and [[tridymite]], have both lower densities and indices of refraction than quartz. Since the composition is identical, the reason for the discrepancies must be in the increased spacing in the high-temperature minerals. As is common with many substances, the higher the temperature, the farther apart the atoms are, due to the increased vibration energy.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The transformation from α-quartz to [[beta-quartz]] takes place abruptly at 573&amp;nbsp;°C. Since the transformation is accompanied by a significant change in volume, it can easily induce fracturing of ceramics or rocks passing through this temperature limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cUwwoR-RuJ0C&amp;pg=PA93|title=Ceramic Technology for Potters and Sculptors|vauthors=Cuff YH|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|year=1996|isbn=9780812213775|location=Philadelphia|pages=93–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high-pressure minerals, [[seifertite]], [[stishovite]], and [[coesite]], though, have higher densities and indices of refraction than quartz. This is probably due to the intense compression of the atoms occurring during their formation, resulting in more condensed structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Silica Stories|vauthors=De La Rocha C, Conley DJ|publisher=Springer|year=2017|isbn=9783319540542|location=Cham|pages=50–55|chapter=Mystical Crystals of Silica|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-54054-2_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Faujasite]] silica is another form of crystalline silica. It is obtained by [[wikt:dealumination|dealumination]] of a low-sodium, ultra-stable Y [[zeolite]] with combined acid and thermal treatment. The resulting product contains over 99% silica, and has high crystallinity and surface area (over 800 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g). Faujasite-silica has very high thermal and acid stability. For example, it maintains a high degree of long-range molecular order or [[crystallinity]] even after boiling in concentrated hydrochloric acid.&lt;ref name=&quot;fau&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Scherzer J|year=1978|title=Dealuminated faujasite-type structures with SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ratios over 100|journal=[[Journal of Catalysis|J.

[[Molten silica]] exhibits several peculiar physical characteristics that are similar to those observed in liquid [[water (properties)|water]]: negative temperature expansion, density maximum at temperatures ~5000&amp;nbsp;°C, and a heat capacity minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Shell SM, Debenedetti PG, Panagiotopoulos AZ|year=2002|title=Molecular structural order and anomalies in liquid silica|url=http://www.engr.ucsb.edu/~shell/papers/2002_PRE_silica.pdf|journal=[[Physical Review E|Phys.

Molecular SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a linear structure is produced when molecular [[silicon monoxide]], SiO, is condensed in an argon matrix cooled with helium along with oxygen atoms generated by [[microwave discharge]]. 
Dimeric silicon dioxide, (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been prepared by reacting O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with matrix isolated dimeric silicon monoxide, (Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). In dimeric silicon dioxide there are two oxygen atoms bridging between the silicon atoms with an Si-O-Si angle of 94° and bond length of 164.6 pm and the terminal Si-O bond length is 150.2 pm. The Si-O bond length is 148.3&amp;nbsp;pm, which compares with the length of 161&amp;nbsp;pm in α-quartz. The bond energy is estimated at 621.7 kJ/mol.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jutzi&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Silicon chemistry: from the atom to extended systems|vauthors=Jutzi P, Schubert U|publisher=Wiley-VCH|year=2003|isbn=9783527306473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural occurrence==
===Geology===
{{expand section|date=July 2017}}
Silica with the [[chemical formula]] {{Silicon}}{{Oxygen|2}} is most commonly found in nature as [[quartz]], which comprises more than 10% by mass of the earth's crust.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ull&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|vauthors=Flörke OW, Graetsch HA, Brunk F, Benda L, Paschen S, Bergna HE, Roberts WO, Welsh WA, Libanati C, Ettlinger M, Kerner D, Maier M, Meon W, Schmoll R, Gies H, Schiffmann D|publisher=Wiley-VCH|year=2008|isbn=9783527306732|location=Weinheim|pages=455|chapter=Silica|doi=10.1002/14356007.a23_583.pub3|display-authors=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quartz is the only polymorph of silica stable at the Earth's surface. Metastable occurrences of the high-pressure forms [[coesite]] and [[stishovite]] have been found around [[impact structure]]s and associated with [[eclogite]]s formed during [[ultra-high-pressure metamorphism]]. The high-temperature forms of [[tridymite]] and [[cristobalite]] are known from silica-rich [[volcanic rock]]s. In many parts of the world, silica is the major constituent of [[sand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Forensic Geoscience|vauthors=Berslien E|publisher=Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2012|isbn=9781405160544|pages=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The various forms of silicon dioxide can be converted from one form to another by heating and changes in pressure.

===Biology===
Even though it is poorly soluble, silica occurs in many plants. Plant materials with high silica [[phytolith]] content appear to be of importance to grazing animals, from chewing insects to [[ungulate]]s. Silica accelerates tooth wear, and high levels of silica in plants frequently eaten by herbivores may have developed as a defense mechanism against predation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Massey FP, Ennos AR, Hartley SE|year=2006|title=Silica in grasses as a defence against insect herbivores: Contrasting effects on folivores and a phloem feeder|journal=[[Journal of Animal Ecology|J.

Silica is also the primary component of [[rice husk ash]], which is used, for example, in filtration and cement manufacturing.

For well over a billion years, [[silicification]] in and by cells has been common in the biological world. In the modern world it occurs in bacteria, single-celled organisms, plants, and animals (invertebrates and vertebrates).
Prominent examples include:
*[[Test (biology)|Tests]] or [[frustule]]s (i.e. shells) of [[diatom]]s, [[Radiolaria]], and [[testate amoebae]].&lt;ref name=Fern/&gt;
*Silica [[phytolith]]s in the cells of many plants, including [[Equisetaceae]], practically all grasses, and a wide range of [[dicotyledon]]s.
*The spicules forming the skeleton of many [[sponge]]s.

Crystalline minerals formed in the physiological environment often show exceptional physical properties (e.g., strength, hardness, fracture toughness) and tend to form hierarchical structures that exhibit microstructural order over a range of scales. The minerals are crystallized from an environment that is undersaturated with respect to silicon, and under conditions of neutral pH and low temperature (0–40&amp;nbsp;°C).

Formation of the mineral may occur either within the cell wall of an organism (such as with phytoliths), or outside the cell wall, as typically happens with [[Test (biology)|tests]]. Specific biochemical reactions exist for mineral deposition. Such reactions include those that involve lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates.

It is unclear in what ways silica is important in the nutrition of [[animal]]s. This field of research is challenging because silica is ubiquitous and in most circumstances dissolves in trace quantities only. All the same it certainly does occur in the living body, creating the challenge of creating silica-free controls for purposes of research. This makes it difficult to be sure when the silica present has had operative beneficial effects, and when its presence is coincidental, or even harmful. The current consensus is that it certainly seems important in the growth, strength, and management of many connective tissues. This is true not only for hard connective tissues such as bone and tooth but possibly in the biochemistry of the subcellular enzyme-containing structures as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Silicon Biochemistry: Ciba Foundation Symposium|vauthors=Carlisle EM|publisher=Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1986|isbn=9780470513323|veditors=Evered D, O'Connor M|series=Novartis Foundation Symposia|volume=121|pages=123–39|chapter=Silicon as an essential trace element in animal nutrition|doi=10.1002/9780470513323.ch8|pmid=3743227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
===Structural use===
About 95% of the commercial use of silicon dioxide (sand) occurs in the construction industry, e.g. for the production of concrete ([[Portland cement concrete]]).&lt;ref name=Ull/&gt;

Certain deposits of silica sand, with desirable particle size and shape and desirable [[clay]] and other mineral content, were important for [[sand casting]] of metallic products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Albany molding sands of the Hudson Valley |first= 	Charles Merrick |last=Nevin|publisher= University of the State of New York at Albany|date= 1925}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The high melting point of silica enables it to be used in such applications such as iron casting; modern sand casting sometimes uses other minerals for other reasons.

Crystalline silica is used in [[hydraulic fracturing]] of formations which contain [[tight oil]] and [[shale gas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT82313&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/24/business/new-rules-would-cut-silica-dust-exposure.html|title=New Rules Would Cut Silica Dust Exposure|last=Greenhouse S|date=23 Aug 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times|NYTimes]]|access-date=24 Aug 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precursor to glass and silicon===
Silica is the primary ingredient in the production of most [[glass]]. As other minerals are melted with silica, the principle of [[Freezing Point Depression]] lowers the melting point of the mixture and increases fluidity. The [[glass transition]] temperature of pure SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is about 1475 K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ojovan MI|year=2004|title=Glass formation in amorphous SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a percolation phase transition in a system of network defects|journal=[[Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics Letters|JETP Lett.]]|volume=79|issue=12|pages=632–634|bibcode=2004JETPL..79..632O|doi=10.1134/1.1790021|s2cid=124299526}}&lt;/ref&gt; When molten silicon dioxide SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is rapidly cooled, it does not crystallize, but solidifies as a glass. Because of this, most [[ceramic glaze]]s have silica as the main ingredient.

The structural geometry of silicon and oxygen in glass is similar to that in quartz and most other crystalline forms of silicon and oxygen with silicon surrounded by regular tetrahedra of oxygen centers. The difference between the glass and crystalline forms arises from the connectivity of the tetrahedral units: Although there is no long range periodicity in the glassy network ordering remains at length scales well beyond the SiO bond length. One example of this ordering is the preference to form rings of 6-tetrahedra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Elliott SR|year=1991|title=Medium-range structural order in covalent amorphous solids|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=354|issue=6353|pages=445–452|bibcode=1991Natur.354..445E|doi=10.1038/354445a0|s2cid=4344891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

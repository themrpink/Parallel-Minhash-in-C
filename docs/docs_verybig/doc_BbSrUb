'''GNU Octave''' is software featuring a [[high-level programming language]], primarily intended for [[numerical analysis|numerical computations]]. Octave helps in solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with [[MATLAB]]. It may also be used as a [[Batch processing|batch-oriented]] language.
Since it is part of the [[GNU Project]], it is [[free software]] under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]].

Other [[free software|free]] alternatives to MATLAB include [[Scilab]] and [[FreeMat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Trappenberg2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Trappenberg|first=Thomas|title=Fundamentals of Computational Neuroscience|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-956841-3|page=361}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MuhammadZalizniak2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Muhammad|first1=A|last2=Zalizniak|first2=V|title=Practical Scientific Computing|url=https://archive.org/details/practicalscienti00muha|url-access=limited|year=2011|publisher=[[Woodhead Publishing]]|isbn=978-0-85709-226-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/practicalscienti00muha/page/n11 3]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MegreyMoksness2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Megrey|first1=Bernard A.|last2=Moksness|first2=Erlend|title=Computers in Fisheries Research|url=https://archive.org/details/computersfisheri00megr|url-access=limited|year=2008|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-8636-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/computersfisheri00megr/page/n351 345]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kapuno2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kapuno|first=Raul Raymond|title=Programming for Chemical Engineers Using C, C++, and MATLAB|year=2008|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=978-1-934015-09-4|page=365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Octave is more compatible with MATLAB than Scilab is&lt;ref name=&quot;Trappenberg2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herman2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Herman|first=Russell L.|title=A Course in Mathematical Methods for Physicists|year=2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4665-8467-9|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WouwerSaucez2014&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wouwer|first1=Alain Vande|last2=Saucez|first2=Philippe|last3=Vilas|first3=Carlos|title=Simulation of ODE/PDE Models with MATLAB, Octave and Scilab: Scientific and Engineering Applications|year=2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-06790-2|pages=114â€“115}}&lt;/ref&gt; and FreeMat has not been updated since June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FreeMat |url=http://freemat.sourceforge.net/#download |website=freemat.sourceforge.net |accessdate=22 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The project was conceived around 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;Octave_about&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=About GNU Octave|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/about.html|website=www.gnu.org|publisher=GNU|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first it was intended to be a companion to a chemical reactor design course. Real development was started by John W. Eaton in 1992. The first alpha release dates back to 4 January 1993 and on 17 February 1994 version 1.0 was released. Version 4.0.0 was released on 29 May 2015.

The program is named after [[Octave Levenspiel]], a former professor of the principal author. Levenspiel was known for his ability to perform quick [[back-of-the-envelope calculation]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Developments==
In addition to use on desktops for personal scientific computing, Octave is used in academia and industry. For example, Octave was used on a massive [[Parallel computing|parallel]] computer at [[Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center]] to find vulnerabilities related to guessing social security numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.hpcwire.com/industry/government/Social-Security-Number-Vulnerability-Findings-Relied-on-Supercomputing-50292227.html
|title=Social Security Number Vulnerability Findings Relied on Supercomputing

|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229220547/http://www.hpcwire.com/hpcwire/2009-07-08/social_security_number_vulnerability_findings_relied_on_supercomputing.html
|archive-date=29 February 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dramatic acceleration with [[OpenCL]] or [[CUDA]] is also possible with use of GPUs.&lt;ref&gt;https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/drop-in-acceleration-gnu-octave/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical details==
* Octave is written in [[C++]] using the [[C++ standard library]].
* Octave uses an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] to execute the Octave scripting language.
* Octave is extensible using dynamically loadable modules.
* Octave interpreter has an [[OpenGL]]-based graphics engine to create plots, graphs and charts and to save or print them. Alternatively, [[gnuplot]] can be used for the same purpose.
* Octave includes a [[Graphical User Interface]] (GUI) in addition to the traditional [[Command Line Interface]] (CLI); see [[#User interfaces]] for details.

==Octave, the language==
The Octave language is an interpreted programming language. It is a [[structured programming]] language (similar to [[C (programming language)|C]]) and supports many common [[C standard library]] functions, and also certain [[POSIX|UNIX]] system calls and functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url        = http://www.network-theory.co.uk/docs/octave3/octave_269.html

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it does not support passing arguments by reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url        = http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/octave/octave_105.html
| title      = GNU Octave
| accessdate = 2009-01-28
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Octave programs consist of a list of function calls or a [[Script (computer programming)|script]]. The syntax is [[Array programming|matrix]]-based and provides various functions for matrix operations. It supports various [[data structure]]s and allows [[object-oriented programming]].&lt;!--Candidate for expansion--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url        = https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/NEWS-3.2.html
| title      = Summary of important user-visible changes for version 3.2
| accessdate = 2012-01-05
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its syntax is very similar to MATLAB, and careful programming of a script will allow it to run on both Octave and MATLAB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url        = http://www.octave.org/wiki/index.php?title=FAQ#Porting_programs_from_Matlab_to_Octave
| title      = FAQ: MATLAB compatibility
| accessdate = 2009-04-04
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Octave is made available under the [[GNU General Public License]], it may be freely changed, copied and used.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot; /&gt; The program runs on [[Microsoft Windows]] and most [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s, including [[Linux]] and [[macOS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://octave.org/doc/interpreter/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable features==

===Command and variable name completion===
Typing a TAB character on the command line causes Octave to attempt to complete variable, function, and file names (similar to [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]]'s [[tab completion]]). Octave uses the text before the cursor as the initial portion of the name to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/interpreter/Commands-For-Completion.html#Commands-For-Completion|title=Letting Readline Type For You|work=GNU Octave Reference Manual|last=Eaton|first=John W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Command history===
When running interactively, Octave saves the commands typed in an internal buffer so that they can be recalled and edited.

===Data structures===
Octave includes a limited amount of support for organizing data in structures. In this example, we see a structure &quot;x&quot; with elements &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot;, (an integer, an array, and a string, respectively):
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;octave&quot;&gt;
octave:1&gt; x.a = 1; x.b = [1, 2; 3, 4]; x.c = &quot;string&quot;;
octave:2&gt; x.a
ans =  1
octave:3&gt; x.b
ans =

   1   2
   3   4

octave:4&gt; x.c
ans = string
octave:5&gt; x
x =
{
  a =  1
  b =

     1   2
     3   4

  c = string
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Short-circuit boolean operators===
Octave's '&lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;' and '&lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt;' logical [[Operator (programming)|operators]] are evaluated in a [[Short-circuit evaluation|short-circuit]] fashion (like the corresponding operators in the [[C (programming language)|C]] language), in contrast to the element-by-element operators '&lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;' and '&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;'.

===Increment and decrement operators===
{{Main|Increment and decrement operators}}
Octave includes the C-like [[increment and decrement operators]] '&lt;code&gt;++&lt;/code&gt;' and '&lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt;' in both their prefix and postfix forms.
Octave also does [[augmented assignment]], e.g.  '&lt;code&gt;x += 5&lt;/code&gt;'.

===Unwind-protect===
Octave supports a limited form of [[exception handling]] modelled after the [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/s_unwind.htm '&lt;code&gt;unwind_protect&lt;/code&gt;'] of [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]. The general form of an unwind_protect block looks like this:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;octave&quot;&gt;
unwind_protect
   body
unwind_protect_cleanup
   cleanup
end_unwind_protect
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

As a general rule, GNU Octave recognizes as termination of a given '&lt;code&gt;''block''&lt;/code&gt;' either the keyword '&lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt;' (which is compatible with the MATLAB language) or a more specific keyword '&lt;code&gt;end_''block''&lt;/code&gt;'. As a consequence, an '&lt;code&gt;unwind_protect&lt;/code&gt;' block can be terminated either with the keyword '&lt;code&gt;end_unwind_protect&lt;/code&gt;' as in the example, or with the more portable keyword '&lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt;'.

The ''cleanup'' part of the block is always executed. In case an exception is raised by the ''body'' part, ''cleanup'' is executed immediately before propagating the exception outside the block '&lt;code&gt;unwind_protect&lt;/code&gt;'.

GNU Octave also supports another form of exception handling (compatible with the MATLAB language):
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
try
   body
catch
   exception_handling
end
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

This latter form differs from an '&lt;code&gt;unwind_protect&lt;/code&gt;' block in two ways. First, ''exception_handling'' is only executed when an exception is raised by ''body''. Second, after the execution of ''exception_handling'' the exception is not propagated outside the block (unless a '&lt;code&gt;rethrow( lasterror )&lt;/code&gt;' statement is explicitly inserted within the ''exception_handling'' code).

===Variable-length argument lists===
Octave has a mechanism for handling functions that take an unspecified number of arguments without explicit upper limit. To specify a list of zero or more arguments, use the special argument &lt;code&gt;varargin&lt;/code&gt; as the last (or only) argument in the list.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;octave&quot;&gt;
function s = plus (varargin)
   if (nargin==0)
      s = 0;
   else
      s = varargin{1} + plus (varargin{2:nargin});
   end
end
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Variable-length return lists===
A function can be set up to return any number of values by using the special return value &lt;code&gt;varargout&lt;/code&gt;. For example:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;octave&quot;&gt;
function varargout = multiassign (data)
   for k=1:nargout
      varargout{k} = data(:,k);
   end
end
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===C++ integration===
It is also possible to execute Octave code directly in a C++ program. For example, here is a code snippet for calling &lt;code&gt;rand([10,1])&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;octave/oct.h&gt;
...
ColumnVector NumRands(2);
NumRands(0) = 10;
NumRands(1) = 1;
octave_value_list f_arg, f_ret;
f_arg(0) = octave_value(NumRands);
f_ret = feval(&quot;rand&quot;, f_arg, 1);
Matrix unis(f_ret(0).matrix_value());
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

C and C++ code can be integrated into GNU Octave by creating oct files, or using the MATLAB compatible [[MEX file]]s.

=={{anchor|MATLAB}} MATLAB compatibility==
Octave has been built with MATLAB compatibility in mind, and shares many features with MATLAB:

# Matrices as fundamental data type.
# Built-in support for complex numbers.
# Powerful built-in math functions and extensive function libraries.
# Extensibility in the form of user-defined functions.

Octave treats incompatibility with MATLAB as a [[Bug (software)|bug]]; therefore, it could be considered a [[software clone]], which does not infringe [[software copyright]] as per ''[[Lotus v. Borland]]'' court case.

MATLAB scripts from the [[MathWorks]]' FileExchange repository in principle are compatible with Octave. However, while they are often provided and uploaded by users under an Octave [[License compatibility|compatible]] and proper [[open-source license|open source]] [[BSD license]], the fileexchange's [[EULA|Terms of use]] prohibit any usage beside MathWorks' [[proprietary software|proprietary]] MATLAB.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.octave.org/FAQ#Why_can.27t_I_use_code_from_File_Exchange_in_Octave.3F_It.27s_released_under_a_BSD_license.21 Why can't I use code from File Exchange in Octave? It's released under a BSD license!] on octave.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/termsofuse.html#content terms of use] on mathworks.com ''&quot;Content that you submit must not directly compete with products offered by MathWorks.

===Syntax compatibility===
There are a few purposeful, albeit minor, [http://octave.org/wiki/index.php?title=FAQ#Porting_programs_from_Matlab_to_Octave syntax additions]:

# [[Comment (computer programming)|Comment]] lines can be prefixed with the # character as well as the % character;
# Various [[C (programming language)|C-based]] operators [[Increment operator|++]], [[Decrement operator|--]], [[Augmented assignment|+=]], *=, /= are supported;
# Elements can be referenced without creating a new variable by cascaded indexing, e.g. [1:10](3);
# [[String (computer science)|String]]s can be defined with the double-quote &quot; character as well as the single-quote ' character;
# When the variable type is [[Single-precision floating-point format|single]] (a single-precision floating-point number), Octave calculates the &quot;[[mean]]&quot; in the single-domain (MATLAB in [[Double-precision floating-point format|double-domain]]) which is faster but gives less accurate results;
# Blocks can also be terminated with more specific [[Control structure]] keywords, i.e., endif, endfor, endwhile, etc.;
# Functions can be defined within scripts and at the Octave prompt;
# Presence of a do-until loop (similar to [[Do while loop|do-while]] in C).

===Function compatibility===
Many, but not all, of the numerous MATLAB functions are available in GNU Octave, some of them accessible through packages in [https://octave.sourceforge.io Octave Forge]. The functions available as part of either core Octave or Forge packages are listed [https://octave.sourceforge.io/list_functions.php?q=&amp;sort=alphabetic online].

A list of unavailable functions is included in the Octave function  [http://hg.savannah.gnu.org/hgweb/octave/file/d63878346099/scripts/help/__unimplemented__.m#l530 __unimplemented.m__]. Unimplemented functions are also listed under many Octave Forge packages in the [https://wiki.octave.org/Category:Octave_Forge Octave Wiki].

When an unimplemented function is called the following error message is shown:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;octave&quot;&gt;
  octave:1&gt; guide
  warning: the 'guide' function is not yet implemented in Octave

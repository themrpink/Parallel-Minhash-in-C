=====Nouns ending in ''-s''=====
Vocalization or lenition is found in addition to any possible [[consonant gradation]], e.g. ''kuningas'' (nominative) ~ ''kuninkaan'' (genitive), or ''mies'' ~ ''miehen''. The illatives are marked thus: ''kuninkaaseen'', ''mieheen''.

=====''-nen'' nouns=====
This is a very large class of words which includes common nouns (for example ''nainen'' 'woman'), many proper names, and many common adjectives. Adding ''-nen'' to a noun is a very productive mechanism for creating adjectives (''muovi'' 'plastic' → ''muovinen'' 'made of plastic'/'plastic-like' ). It can also function as a diminutive ending.

The form behaves like it ended in ''-s'', with the exception of the nominative, where it is ''-nen''. Thus, the stem for these words removes the '-nen' and adds ''-s(e)'' after which the inflectional ending is added:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''muovise'''ssa''' pussi'''ssa''''' || &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''in''' the plastic bag'
|-
| ''kaksi muovista lelua'' || 'two plastic toys'
|-
| ''muovise'''en''' laatikko'''on''''' || &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''into''' the plastic box'
|}

Here are some of the diminutive forms that are in use:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Finnish !! Stemming from !! English
|-
| ''kätönen'' || ''käsi'' || 'a small hand' (affectionate)
|-
| ''lintunen'' || ''lintu'' || 'birdie', 'a small bird'
|-
| ''veikkonen'' || ''veikko'' || 'lad'
|-
| ''kirjanen'' || ''kirja'' || 'booklet'
|-
| ''kukkanen'' || ''kukka'' || 'a little flower'
|-
| ''lapsonen'' || ''lapsi'' || 'a little child'
|}

The diminutive form mostly lives in surnames which are usually ancient words many of whose meaning has been obfuscated. Some of the most common:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Finnish !! From word !! English
|-
| ''Rautiainen'' || ''rautio'' || blacksmith (of a blacksmith's family)
|-
| ''Korhonen'' || ''korho'' || 'deaf' (of a deaf man's family)
|-
| ''Leinonen'' || ''leino'' || 'sorrowful, melancholic'; alternatively male name ''Leino'' as short for Leonard
|-
| ''Virtanen'', ''Jokinen'', ''Järvinen'', ''Nieminen''...
| ''virta'', ''joki'', ''järvi'', ''niemi''
| 'the family from by the stream (''virta''), river (''joki''), lake (''järvi''), peninsula (''niemi'')'
|-
| ''Mikkonen'' || || [A family name assimilated from the name of the farmhouse, after the householder's name 'Mikko']
|-
| ''Martikainen'' || || possible origin ''Martikka'', a South [[Karelian language|Karelian]] surname, identical to Russian surname [[Martika]]
|-
| ''Lyytikäinen'' || || from ''Lyytikkä'', originating to Germanic male name ''Lydecke''
|}

Occasionally such nouns become place-names. For example, there is a peninsula called &quot;Neuvosenniemi&quot; beside a certain lake. &quot;Neuvonen&quot; means &quot;a bit of advice/direction&quot;; at this peninsula people rowing tar barrels across the lake would stop to ask whether the weather conditions would allow to continue to the other side. Most place-names ending with ''-nen'' assume a plural form when inflected. For instance, the illative of ''[[Sörnäinen]]'' is ''Sörnäisiin'' instead of singular ''Sörnäiseen''.

=====''-e'' nouns=====
Older *''-h'' and *''-k''-stems have changed rather drastically. The consonant does not survive in any form of the paradigm, and these nouns make the appearance of ending in an unchanging ''-e''. However, the former existence of a consonant in still seen in that the dictionary form represents weak gradation, and each word has two stems, a weak grade stem in which the former final consonant has assimilated (used for the partitive singular), and strong grade vowel stem to which most case suffixes are applied.  The vowel stem has an additional ''-e-'': {{lang|fi|perhe}} 'family' → {{lang|fi|perhee-}}: {{lang|fi|perheessä}}, {{lang|fi|perheellä}}, etc.; which represents the historical loss of a medial consonant which is sometimes found in dialects as an ''-h-'' (e.g,. {{lang|fi|ruoste}} 'rust' → {{lang|fi|*ruostehena}}).

By analogy, in standard Finnish all words ending in 'e' behave as former ''-h'' stems. In some dialects, the ''-h'' stems have however shifted to ''-s'' instead, e.g. standard ''vene'', in Pohjanmaa ''venes'' ← ''veneh''. The [[illative case]] also changes form with a consonant stem, where the ending ''-hen'' is assibilated to ''-seen'', as ''-hen'' is the genitive.

The weak grade stem, which is found in the 'dictionary' form results from another historic change in which a final consonant has been lost.  This is important to word inflection, because the partitive ending is suffixed directly onto this stem, where the consonant has been assimilated to a ''-t-'' instead of being lost.  Other case endings are suffixed to the strong grade/vowel stem.

|-

| ''huoneeseen'' &lt;br /&gt; 'into the room' || ''laitteeseen'' &lt;br /&gt; 'into the device'
|}

More of this phenomenon is discussed in [[Finnish phonology#Sandhi|Finnish Phonology: Sandhi]].

==Adjectives==
[[Adjective]]s in Finnish are inflected in exactly the same way as nouns, and an adjective must agree in number and case with the noun it is modifying.

For example, here are some adjectives:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''iso'' || 'big'
|-
| ''pieni'' || 'small'
|-
| ''punainen'' || 'red'
|}

And here are some examples of adjectives inflected to agree with nouns:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''iso{{pipe}}n talo{{pipe}}n edessä'' || 'in front of the big house'
|-
| ''kaksi pien{{pipe}}tä talo{{pipe}}a'' || 'two small houses'
|-
| ''punaise{{pipe}}ssa talo{{pipe}}ssa'' || 'in the red house'
|}

Notice that the adjectives undergo the same sorts of stem changes when they are inflected as nouns do.

===Comparative formation===
The comparative of the adjective is formed by adding ''-mpi'' to the inflecting stem. For example:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Finnish !! English !! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''iso'' || 'big' || ''iso{{pipe}}mpi'' || 'bigger'
|-
| ''pieni'' || 'small' || ''piene{{pipe}}mpi'' || 'smaller'
|-
| ''punainen'' || 'red' || ''punaise{{pipe}}mpi'' || 'redder'
|}

Since the comparative adjective is still an adjective, it must be inflected to agree with the noun it modifies. To make the inflecting stem of the comparative, the ''-mpi'' ending loses its final ''i''. If the syllable context calls for a weak consonant, the ''-mp-'' becomes ''-mm-''. Then ''-a-'' is added before the actual case ending (or ''-i-'' in plural). This should become clear with a few examples:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''iso{{pipe}}mma{{pipe}}n talo{{pipe}}n edessä'' || 'in front of the bigger house'
|-
| ''kaksi piene{{pipe}}mpä{{pipe}}ä talo{{pipe}}a'' || 'two smaller houses'
|-
| ''punaise{{pipe}}mma{{pipe}}ssa talo{{pipe}}ssa'' || 'in the redder house'
|-
| ''punaise{{pipe}}mmi{{pipe}}ssa taloi{{pipe}}ssa'' || 'in the redder houses'
|}

===Superlative formation===
The superlative of the adjective is formed by adding ''-in'' to the inflecting stem. For example:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ Superlative formation
|-
! Finnish !! English !! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''iso'' || 'big' ||  ''iso{{pipe}}in'' || 'biggest'
|-
| ''punainen'' || 'red' ||  ''punais{{pipe}}in'' || 'reddest'
|}

Note that because the superlative marker vowel is ''i'', the same kind of changes can occur with vowel stems as happen in verb imperfects, and noun inflecting plurals:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Finnish !! English !! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''pieni'' || 'small' || ''pienin'' (not *''pienein'') || 'smallest'
|}

Since the superlative adjective is still an adjective, it must be inflected to agree with the noun it modifies. The ''-in'' becomes either ''-imma-'' or ''-impa-'' (plural ''-immi-'' or ''-impi-'') depending on whether the syllable context calls for a weak or strong consonant. Here are the examples:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''iso{{pipe}}imma{{pipe}}n talo{{pipe}}n edessä'' || 'in front of the biggest house'
|-
| ''kaksi pien{{pipe}}in{{pipe}}tä talo{{pipe}}a'' || 'the two smallest houses'
|-
| ''punais{{pipe}}imma{{pipe}}ssa talo{{pipe}}ssa'' || 'in the reddest house'
|-
| ''punais{{pipe}}immi{{pipe}}ssa taloi{{pipe}}ssa'' || 'in the reddest houses'
|}

====Irregular forms====
The most important irregular form is:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ Main irregular form
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''hyvä, parempi, paras'' || 'good, better, best'
|}

The form ''paree'' &quot;good&quot; is not found in standard Finnish, but can be found in the Southern Ostrobothnian dialect.

Notice also:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; style=&quot;background:#cfcfcf;&quot; | More irregular forms
|-
! Finnish !! Hypothetic regular !! English
|-
| ''pitkä, pidempi ~ pitempi, pisin'' || ''pitkä, *pitkempi, *pitkin'' || 'long, longer, longest'
|-
| ''lyhyt, lyhyempi ~ lyhempi, lyhin'' || ''lyhyt, lyhyempi, lyhyin'' || 'short, shorter, shortest'&lt;br /&gt;(although the standard forms are also used)
|}

There are a small number of other irregular comparative and superlative forms, such as:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''uusi, uudempi, uusin'' || 'new, newer, newest'
|}

Where the inflecting stem is ''uude-'' but the superlative is ''uusin'' = 'newest'.

==Postpositions and prepositions==
[[Postposition]]s are more common in Finnish than [[preposition]]s. Both postpositions and prepositions can be combined with either a noun or a possessive suffix to form a postpositional phrase.

===Postpositions===
Postpositions indicate place, time, cause, consequence or relation. In postpositional phrases the noun is usually in genitive:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ Postpositions
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''pöydän '''alla''''' || &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''under''' the table'
|-
| ''joulun '''jälkeen''''' || &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''after''' Christmas'
|-
| ''lasten '''tähden''''' || &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''for the sake''' of the children'
|-
| ''jonkun '''puolesta''''' || &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''on behalf''' of somebody'
|}

The noun (or pronoun) can be omitted when there is a possessive suffix:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''olen _ '''vierellä{{pipe}}si''''' || '(I) '''am next to (you)'''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; or&lt;br /&gt;'(I) am '''by (your) side'''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|}

As with verbs, the pronoun cannot be omitted in the third person (singular or plural):
:''Olin _ mukanasi'' &quot;I was with you&quot;
:but ''Olin '''hänen''' mukanaan'' &quot;I was with '''him/her'''&quot;

:''Tulen _ mukaanne'' &quot;I will come with you (plural or polite)&quot;
:but ''Tulen '''heidän''' mukanaan'' &quot;I will come with '''them'''&quot;

===Prepositions===
There are few important prepositions in Finnish. In prepositional phrases the noun is always in the partitive:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ Prepositions
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| '''''ennen''' joulua'' || '''before''' Christmas
|-
| '''''ilman''' sinua'' || '''without''' you
|}

Some postpositions can also be used as prepositions:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ Postpositions as prepositions
|-
! Postposition !! Preposition !! English
|-
| ''kylän '''keskellä''''' || '''''keskellä''' kylää'' || '''in the middle''' of the village
|}

Using postpositions as prepositions is not strictly incorrect and occurs in poetry, as in, for example, the song &quot;''Alla vaahterapuun''&quot; &quot;under a maple tree&quot;, instead the usual ''vaahterapuun alla''.

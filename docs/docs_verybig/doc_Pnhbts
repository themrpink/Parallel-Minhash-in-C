In 2020, NASA physicist Slava Turyshev presented his idea of Direct Multipixel Imaging and Spectroscopy of an Exoplanet with a Solar Gravitational Lens Mission. The lens could reconstruct the exoplanet image with ~25 km-scale surface resolution, enough to see surface features and signs of habitability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hall|first=Loura|date=2020-04-06|title=Direct Multipixel Imaging and Spectroscopy of an Exoplanet|url=http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/niac/2020_Phase_I_Phase_II/Direct_Multipixel_Imaging_and_Spectroscopy_of_an_Exoplanet|access-date=2020-08-05|website=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(1998) prescribed a method to invert the effects of the Point Spread Function (PSF) smearing and shearing, recovering a shear estimator uncontaminated by the systematic distortion of the PSF. This method (KSB+) is the most widely used method in weak lensing shear measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Statistical Challenges in Modern Astronomy IV: Proceedings of a Conference Held at Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, USA, 12–15 June 2006, Volume 371 |edition=illustrated |first1=Gutti Jogesh |last1=Babu |first2=Eric D. |last2=Feigelson |publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-58381-240-2 |page=66 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dHPvAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Pan-Chromatic View of Clusters of Galaxies and the Large-Scale Structure |edition=illustrated |first1=Manolis |last1=Plionis |first2=O. |last2=López-Cruz |first3=D. |last3=Hughes |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4020-6940-6 |page=233 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TnovKp-nJuMC&amp;pg=PA233}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Galaxies have random rotations and inclinations. As a result, the shear effects in weak lensing need to be determined by statistically preferred orientations. The primary source of error in lensing measurement is due to the convolution of the PSF with the lensed image. The KSB method measures the ellipticity of a galaxy image. The shear is proportional to the ellipticity. The objects in lensed images are parameterized according to their weighted quadrupole moments. For a perfect ellipse, the weighted quadrupole moments are related to the weighted ellipticity. KSB calculate how a weighted ellipticity measure is related to the shear and use the same formalism to remove the effects of the PSF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gravitational Lensing: An Astrophysical Tool |edition=illustrated |first1=Frederic Courbin, Dante Minniti |last1=Frederic Courbin, Dante Minniti |publisher=Springer |year=2008 |isbn=978-3-540-45857-9 |page=69 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TsxrCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KSB's primary advantages are its mathematical ease and relatively simple implementation. However, KSB is based on a key assumption that the PSF is circular with an anisotropic distortion. This is a reasonable assumption for cosmic shear surveys, but the next generation of surveys (e.g. [[Large Synoptic Survey Telescope|LSST]]) may need much better accuracy than KSB can provide.

Wittenberg is situated on the [[River Elbe]], {{convert|60|km|sp=us}} north of [[Leipzig]] and {{convert|90|km|sp=us}} south-west of [[Berlin]], and has a population of 46,008 (2018).

Wittenberg is famous for its close connection with [[Martin Luther]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]], for which it received the honorific ''[[Lutherstadt]]''. Several of Wittenberg's buildings associated with the events, including a preserved part of the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] [[monastery]] in which Luther lived, first as a monk and later as owner with his wife [[Katharina von Bora]] and family, considered to be the world's premier [[museum]] dedicated to Luther. Wittenberg was also the seat of the [[Elector of Saxony]], a dignity held by the dukes of [[Duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg|Saxe-Wittenberg]], making it one of the most powerful cities in the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

Today, Wittenberg is an industrial center and popular tourist destination, best known for its intact historic center and various memorial sites dedicated to Martin Luther and [[Philip Melanchthon]]. The Luther Memorial was added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|world heritage]] list in 1996.

[[File:Wittenberg-1536.jpg|thumb|left|Wittenberg, 1536]]

Historical documents first mention the settlement in 1180 as a small village founded by [[Flemish]] colonists under the rule of the [[House of Ascania]]. In 1260 this village became the residence of the dukes of [[Duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg|Saxe-Wittenberg]], and in 1293 the settlement was granted{{by whom |date= May 2016}} its [[German town law|town charter]] as a free-standing town.

Wittenberg developed into an important trade centre during the following several centuries, because of its central location. When the local branch of the Ascanians died out in 1422, control of Saxe-Wittenberg passed to the [[House of Wettin]].  This town became an important regional political and cultural centre at the end of the 15th Century, when [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Frederick III &quot;the Wise&quot;, the Elector of Saxony]] from 1486 to 1525, made his residence in Wittenberg. Several parts of boundaries of the town were extended soon afterward. The second bridge over the [[Elbe River]] was built from 1487 through 1490 and the castle church (the ''Schlosskirche'' in German) was erected from 1496 through 1506. The Elector's palace was rebuilt at the same time.

In 1502 Elector Frederick founded the [[University of Wittenberg]], which attracted some important thinkers, such as [[Martin Luther]]—a professor of theology beginning in 1508—and [[Philipp Melanchthon]]—a professor of Greek starting in 1518.

On 31 October 1517, according to legend, Luther nailed his [[Ninety-five Theses|95 theses]] against the selling of [[indulgence]]s at the door of the [[All Saints' Church, Wittenberg|All Saints', the Castle Church]] – an event taken as marking the beginning of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The [[Anabaptist]] movement had one of its earliest homes in Wittenberg, when the [[Zwickau prophets]] moved there in late 1521, only to be suppressed by Luther when he returned from the [[Wartburg]] in spring 1522. The [[Capitulation of Wittenberg]] (1547) is the name given to the treaty by which [[John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony|John Frederick the Magnanimous]] was compelled to resign the electoral dignity and most of his territory to the Albertine branch of the [[House of Wettin]].

In 1760, during the [[Seven Years' War]], the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrians]] bombarded the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]]-occupied town. The [[First French Empire|French]] took control in 1806, and [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] commanded the refortification of the town in 1813. In 1814 the [[Prussian Army]] under [[Bogislav Friedrich Emanuel von Tauentzien|Tauentzien]] stormed Wittenberg; he received the title of &quot;von Wittenberg&quot; as a reward.  In 1815 Wittenberg became part of [[Prussia]], administered within the [[Province of Saxony]]. Wittenberg continued to be a fortress of the third class until the reorganisation of German defences after the foundation of the new [[German Empire]] led to its dismantling in 1873.

It contained a prisoner of war camp from 1914 to 1918. A camp 10½ acres in area was set up at Klein Wittenberg, 2 miles from the city. Eight compounds held 13,000 men. During the typhus epidemic of 1914-1915, conditions were harsh. The camp medical officer, Dr. Aschenbach, was awarded the Iron Cross for his part in the epidemic. The award was questioned by the Allies.
The use of dogs to attack POW’s was criticised by American Ambassador [[James W. Gerard]] in his book “Four Years in Germany”.

Unlike many other historic German cities during [[World War II]], Wittenberg's town centre was spared destruction during the conflict.  The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] agreed not to bomb Wittenberg, though fighting took place in the town, with bullet pock-marks visible on the statues of Luther and Melanchthon at the market square – or so the popular version of the town's history goes. In actuality, the Luther statue was not even present in the town square during much of the war, but in storage at Luther Brunnen, a roadhouse a few kilometres north of the town.

Wittenberg's reputation as a town protected from Allied bombing is largely accurate. However, just outside Wittenberg the government had built the ''[[Arado Flugzeugwerke]]'' (the Arado Aircraft Factory), which produced components of airplanes for the [[Luftwaffe]]. This war factory was worked by [[Jew]]s, Russians, Poles, [[political prisoner]]s and even a few Americans—all prisoners engaging in [[forced labour]], including POW’s who were supposed to be exempt from this sort of labor. American and British planes bombed the factory near the end of the war, and in destroying it killed over one thousand of the prisoners and POW’s placed by the Germans in this war plant.

attempts to document this tragic bombing outside Wittenberg.

At the end of the war, [[Red Army|Soviet forces]] occupied Wittenberg; it became part of [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]] in 1949. During the East German period, it formed part of [[Halle District]]. By means of the [[peaceful revolution]] in 1989, the communist régime dissolved and the town has been governed democratically since 1990.

Wittenberg is currently characterized by renovation and new construction work, an economic recovery and tourism development as a &quot;place of pilgrimage for the Reformation&quot;. With the Luther Decade, the city has been preparing for the 500th anniversary of the Reformation since 2008, which took place in 2017. Numerous buildings have been restored, the infrastructure has been partially renewed and numerous new attractions have been created in the city (e.g. the new [[Lutherstadt Wittenberg Hauptbahnhof]], Arsenal shopping centre, Luthergarden or the Panometer) .

In 2014 Lutherstadt Wittenberg was awarded the honorary title [[European City of the Reformation]] by the [[Community of Protestant Churches in Europe]].

[[File:Lutherstadt Wittenberg 09-2016 photo01.jpg|thumb|Cranachhof, one of many courtyards in Wittenberg]]
Wittenberg is home to numerous historical sites, as well as portraits and other paintings by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] and [[Lucas Cranach the Younger|Younger]]. On the doors of [[All Saints' Church, Wittenberg|All Saints' Church, the ''Schlosskirche'']] (&quot;castle church&quot;, built in 1496–1506) [[Martin Luther]] is said to have nailed his [[95 theses]] in 1517. It was seriously damaged by fire in 1760 during a bombardment by the French during the [[Seven Years' War]], was practically rebuilt, and was later (1885–1892) restored. The wooden doors, burnt in 1760, were replaced in 1858 by bronze doors, bearing the [[Latin]] text of the theses. Inside the church are the tombs of [[Martin Luther]], [[Philipp Melanchthon]], [[Johannes Bugenhagen]], [[Paul Eber]] and of the electors [[Frederick the Wise]] (by [[Peter Vischer the Younger]], 1527) and [[John the Constant]] (by [[Hans Vischer]]), and portraits of the reformers by Lucas Cranach the Younger, who is also buried in the church.

St. Mary's Church, the parish church in which Luther often preached, was built in the 14th century, but has been much altered since Luther's time. It contains a painting by Lucas Cranach the Elder, representing the [[Last Supper]] (with the faces of Luther and other reformers), Baptism and Confession, also a font by [[Hermann Vischer the Elder]] (1457). In addition, there are numerous historic paintings in the church.

The ancient electoral palace is another of the buildings that suffered severely in 1760; it now contains archives.

Martin Luther's home, the [[Augusteum and Lutherhaus|Lutherhaus]], where he studied and lived both before and after the Reformation, is now a museum containing many artifacts from his life. Melanchthon's house and the house of Lucas Cranach the Elder, mayor of Wittenberg, can also be found here. Statues of Luther (by Schadow), Melanchthon and Bugenhagen embellish the town. The spot outside the Elster Gate where Luther publicly burned the [[papal bull]] in 1520 is marked by an oak tree.

The original [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|Wittenberg University]] quadrangle also lies in the city centre.

==Coat of arms==
[[Image:Alt-Wappen-WB.jpg|thumb|left|Wittenberg's oldest [[coat of arms]]]]
Wittenberg's civic [[coat of arms]] conveys with its various heraldic elements something of the town's history. On 27 June 1293, Wittenberg was granted [[town rights]] by Duke Albert II. There then arose a mediaeval town whose highest governing body was its council. This council, known to have existed as early as 1317, was given the job of administering the town in its care through law and legislation, and of handling the town's revenue. For documentation, the administration used its own seal.
One version of what is believed to be the town's oldest town seal, which the council used, and which dated from the first half of the 14th century, set the pattern with its elements for various civic coats of arms down to the present day.

The coat of arms symbolizes, with its crenelated wall and the towers within and each side, a town that was already strongly fortified by 1409.
The two shields in the centre form the coat of arms of the Electorate of Saxony with the Saxon arms on the right, whose gold and black stripes recall the Ascanian rulers' house colours with the 
''Rautenkranz'' or [[crancelin]] (literally &quot;[[rue]] wreath&quot;; see the [[Saxony]] article for more) across them symbolizing the town's founder Duke Albrecht II since 1262, when it appeared in his arms.
The shield on the left is the Wittenberg district's arms. In 1356, Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] bestowed upon the Duke of Saxony-Wittenberg the honour of Elector. Wittenberg became an Electoral residence. The shield with its crossed swords stands for the office of &quot;Arch-Marshal of the Holy Roman Empire&quot; inextricably joined by the Electorate, brought to Wittenberg by [[Rudolf I, Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg|Rudolf I]]. Both coats of arms continued to be used by the [[Wettin (dynasty)|Wettin]]s after the Ascanians died out.
The flowing water at the foot of the shield symbolizes Wittenberg's location on the River Elbe.
The fish is a [[salmon]], which were once abundant in the Elbe. The [[fishing|fishermen]], like all professions in town, got their own order in 1422, and the fish found its way onto their coat of arms.

==Economy and infrastructure==
The town is an important centre of [[chemical industry]] with the {{Interlanguage link multi|SKW Stickstoffwerke Piesteritz GmbH|de|3=Stickstoffwerke Piesteritz}}. The whole area of the industrial park covers more than 220 hectares with more than 1,500 workers. Wittenberg is also the headquarters of the eco-friendly [[web search engine]] [[Ecosia]]. Tourism plays a major role. Wittenberg is one of the top destinations in Saxony-Anhalt.

[[Lutherstadt Wittenberg station]] is the main railway station. It connects Wittenberg hourly with [[Berlin]] to the north and [[Leipzig]] and [[Halle (Saale)]] to the south. The station was rebuilt to be more environmentally friendly and re-opened in December 2016.

==Theatre, culture and education==
[[File:Wittenberg University, Collegianstrasse, Wittenberg.jpg|thumb|right|Leucorea]]
Wittenberg has a long tradition of cultural events. The Central German State Theatre (''Mitteldeutsches Landestheater'') reached a great importance in [[East Germany|GDR]] times. Since 1996, the town has staged open-air theatre shows based on the Lutheran history still alive in many historical places of the ancient town. As highlights, in 2001 and 2005, [[Fernando Scarpa]] became the [[artistic director]] of the ''&quot;Bühne Wittenberg&quot;'' (Stage Wittenberg), a project for theatre, art and culture in the whole of Germany which attracts many visitors to the town and whose success is known European-wide. On 2002 and 2003 [[Stefano Vagnini]], Italian composer and organist created the music for ''Thesys'' and ''Luther Stories''. [[Prince Hamlet]] is said to have studied in Wittenberg and it was the supposed home of [[Johann Georg Faust|Dr. Faustus]].

Wittenberg is seat of the [http://www.leucorea.de Leucorea] which is part of the [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg]], the largest university in Saxony-Anhalt.

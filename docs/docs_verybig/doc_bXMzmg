Finney's first film appearance was in [[Tony Richardson]]'s ''[[The Entertainer (film)|The Entertainer]]'' (1960), with Laurence Olivier. Finney and [[Alan Bates]] played Olivier's sons. He made his film breakthrough in the same year with his portrayal of a disillusioned [[factory]] worker in [[Karel Reisz]]'s film version of [[Alan Sillitoe]]'s ''[[Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (film)|Saturday Night and Sunday Morning]]'' (1960), produced by Richardson. The film was a box-office success, being the third most popular film in Britain that year. It earned over half a million pounds in profit.&lt;ref name=&quot;tino&quot;&gt;Tino Balio, ''United Artists: The Company That Changed the Film Industry'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1987 p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; Finney then did ''[[Billy Liar]]'' (1960) on stage and for British television.&lt;ref name=&quot;fin&quot;&gt;Finney: A Star Who Hides His Magnitude: Albert Finney, Marks, Sally K. Los Angeles Times 23 Apr 1967: c11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finney had been chosen to play [[T. E. Lawrence]] in [[David Lean]]'s production of ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' after a successful and elaborate screen-test that took four days to shoot. However, Finney baulked at signing a multi-year contract for producer [[Sam Spiegel]] and chose not to accept the role.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;David Lean&quot; by [[Stephen M. Silverman]] (Abrams, New York, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Finney created the title role in ''[[Luther (play)|Luther]]'', the 1961 play by John Osborne depicting the life of [[Martin Luther]], a key early figure of the Protestant Reformation. He performed the role with the English Stage Company in London, Nottingham, Paris and New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;Theater: 'Luther' Stars Albert Finney; John Osborne Drama Is at the St. James&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Taubman |first1=Howard |title=Theater: 'Luther' Stars Albert Finney; John Osborne Drama Is at the St. James |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/09/26/archives/theater-luther-stars-albert-finney-john-osborne-drama-is-at-the-st.html?sq=Luther+AND+Osborne+AND+Finney&amp;scp=1&amp;st=p |website=The New York Times |access-date=9 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original [[West End theatre|West End]] run at the Phoenix ended in March 1962, after 239 performances there, when Finney had to leave the cast to fulfill a contractual obligation with a film company.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Luther to end its run next month&quot;, ''The Times'', 16 February 1962, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Tom Jones''===
Finney starred in the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning 1963 film ''[[Tom Jones (1963 film)|Tom Jones]]'', directed by Richardson and written by Osborne. The success of ''Tom Jones'' saw British exhibitors vote Finney the ninth most popular star at the box office in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Most Popular Films Of 1963.&quot; Times [London, England] 3 January 1964: 4. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 11 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finney followed this with a small part in ensemble war movie ''[[The Victors (1963 film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), which was not a success. He then made his Broadway debut in ''Luther'' in 1963. When that run ended he decided to take a year off and sail around the world. &quot;People told me to cash in on my success while I was hot,&quot; he later said. &quot;I'd been acting for about eight years and had only had one vacation&amp;nbsp;... Captain Cook had been a hero of mine when I was a kid, and I thought it would be exciting to go to some of the places in the Pacific where he'd been.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;new&quot;/&gt;

The success of ''Tom Jones'' enabled Finney to produce his next film, ''[[Night Must Fall (1964 film)|Night Must Fall]]'', in 1964, which he also starred in and which was directed by Reisz.  A remake of [[Night Must Fall (1937 film)|the classic 1937 film of the same title]], the film was a flop and Finney's performance received poor reviews.{{cn|date=June 2020}}
===1963–1974===

[[File:Albert Finney 1966b.jpg|thumb|upright|Finney in 1966]]

He and [[Michael Medwin]] formed a production company, Memorial Productions, which made ''[[Privilege (1967 film)|Privilege]]'' (1967), directed by [[Peter Watkins]]; ''The Burning'' (1968), a short directed by [[Stephen Frears]]; and ''[[If....]]'' (1968), directed by [[Lindsay Anderson]].

By SAM ZOLOTOW. New York Times 12 Dec 1967: 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Memorial also produced some in which Finney did not appear, such as ''Spring and Port Wine'' and ''The Burgular''.

Memorial then made ''[[Charlie Bubbles]]'' (1968), which Finney starred in and also directed. [[Liza Minnelli]] made her feature debut in the movie.&lt;ref&gt;MOVIE CALL SHEET: 'Charlie' Next Film for Liza
Martin, Betty. Los Angeles Times 21 Oct 1966: C16.&lt;/ref&gt; Finney later called it &quot;the most intense sense of creation I've ever had.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;new&quot;/&gt;

As an actor only he made ''[[The Picasso Summer]]'' (1969). Finney played the title role in the musical ''[[Scrooge (1970 film)|Scrooge]]'' in 1970.

Memorial Productions pulled out of producing and Finney focused on acting. &quot;It was OK at first,&quot; he later said, &quot;but in the end it was sitting in an office, pitching ideas to Hollywood and waiting for the phone to ring.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Finney's fondness for the good life Gritten, David.

===''Murder on the Orient Express''===
Finney played [[Agatha Christie]]'s Belgian master detective [[Hercule Poirot]] in the film ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1974). Finney became so well known for the role that he complained that it typecast him for a number of years, &quot;People really do think I am 300 pounds with a French accent&quot;, he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hughes |first1=David |title=Poirot actors: from David Suchet to Kenneth Branagh, the stars who've played Agatha Christie's sleuth |url=https://inews.co.uk/culture/bbc-film-review-programme-cancelled/ |work=The Independent |date=28 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, Dennis and Len Lovallo.

He announced he intended to direct a film, ''The Girl in Melanie Klein'', for Memorial, but it was not made.&lt;ref&gt;News of the Screen: ' Sugarland' Team For 'Clearwater' 5 Adaptations Set In Theater Series Finney to Direct Comedy on Lunacy

Finney decided to take time off from features and focus on stage acting, doing classics at the National Theatre in London. &quot;I felt that it needed commitment,&quot; he later said. &quot;When you're making movies all the time, you stop breathing. You literally don't breathe in the same way that you do when you're playing the classics. When you have to deliver those long, complex speeches on stage, you can't heave your shoulders after every sentence. The set of muscles required for that kind of acting need to be trained. I really wanted to try and do justice to my own potential in the parts. I didn't want to be a movie actor just dropping in, doing Hamlet and taking off again. I wanted to feel part of the company.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Finney comes back to film

Finney was at the National for over three years{{when|date=August 2019}} during which he played in [[Hamlet]], [[Macbeth]], [[Tamburlaine]], and plays by [[Anton Chekhov]].&lt;ref name=&quot;new&quot;/&gt;

Finney made a TV movie ''[[Forget-Me-Not-Lane]]'' in 1975, which was written by [[Peter Nichols (playwright)|Peter Nichols]], and he also performed a cameo role in ''[[The Duellists (film)|The Duellists]]'' (1977), the first feature directed by [[Ridley Scott]]. He also released an album through Motown.&lt;ref&gt;Whither Albert Finney?: From Manchester to Motown Records

===1980s===
Finney had not played a lead role in a feature film in six years, and started to think about returning to cinema. The last two successful films he had made were ''Scrooge'' and ''Orient Express'' in which he was heavily disguised. &quot;Most Americans probably think I weigh 300 pounds, have black hair and talk with a French accent like Hercule Poirot,&quot; said Finney. &quot;So I thought they should have a look at me while I was still almost a juvenile and kind of cute.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;new&quot;/&gt;

Finney decided to make six films in succession &quot;so that I could relax and get back into it again. In order to feel really assured and comfortable in front of a camera, you've got to do it for a while.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;new&quot;/&gt;

The first three were thrillers: ''[[Loophole (1981 film)|Loophole]]'' (1981), with [[Susannah York]]; ''[[Wolfen (film)|Wolfen]]'' (1981), directed by [[Michael Wadleigh]]; and ''[[Looker (film)|Looker]]'' (1981), written and directed by [[Michael Crichton]].&lt;ref&gt;Albert Finney stages a film comeback, Blume, Mary.

He received excellent reviews for his performance in the drama ''[[Shoot the Moon]]'' (1982).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/26/movies/finney-comes-back-to-film.html?pagewanted=all|title=Finney comes back to film|first=Stephen|last=Farber|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 26, 1981|access-date=September 3, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905054528/http://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/26/movies/finney-comes-back-to-film.html?pagewanted=all|archive-date=September 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finney said the role &quot;required personal acting; I had to dig into myself. When you have to expose yourself and use your own vulnerability, you can get a little near the edge.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;new&quot;/&gt;

Less well received was his performance as Daddy Warbucks in the [[Hollywood]] film version of ''[[Annie (1982 film)|Annie]]'' (1982), which was directed by [[John Huston]]. Finney said going into this film  after ''Shoot the Moon'' was &quot;marvelous. I use a completely different side of myself as Warbucks. 'Annie' is show biz; it's open, simple and direct. It needs bold, primary colors. I don't have to reveal the inner workings of the character, and that's a relief.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;new&quot;/&gt;

Finney went into ''[[The Dresser (1983 film)|The Dresser]]'' (1983), directed by Peter Yates, which earned him a Best Actor Oscar Nomination. He then played the title role in the TV movie ''[[Pope John Paul II (film)|Pope John Paul II]]'' (1984), his American TV debut.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

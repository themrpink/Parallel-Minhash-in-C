==Clinical significance==
{{expand section|date=April 2014}}
A break in the first vertebra is referred to as a [[Jefferson fracture]].

Craniocervical junction misalignment is also suspected as a factor in neurodegenerative diseases where altered CSF flow plays a part in the pathological process.

Hyperextension (Whiplash) Injury

A rear-end traffic collision or a poorly performed rugby tackle can both result in the head being whipped back on the shoulders, causing whiplash. In minor cases, the anterior longitudinal ligament of the spine is damaged which is acutely painful for the patient.

In more severe cases, fractures can occur to any of the cervical vertebrae as they are suddenly compressed by rapid deceleration. Again, since the vertebral foramen is large there is less chance of spinal cord involvement.

The worst-case scenario for these injuries is that dislocation or subluxation of the cervical vertebrae occurs. This often happens at the C2 level, where the body of C2 moves anteriorly with respect to C3. Such an injury may well lead to spinal cord involvement, and as a consequence quadriplegia or death may occur. More commonly, subluxation occurs at the C6/C7 level (50% of cases).

The '''Atlas Mountains''' ({{lang-ar|جِبَال ٱلْأَطْلَس|jibāl al-ʾaṭlas}} /ʒibaːl al atˤlas/) are a [[mountain range]] in the [[Maghreb]]. It separates the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coastlines from the [[Sahara]] Desert. It stretches around {{convert|2500|km|mi|abbr=on}} through [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]] and [[Tunisia]]. The range's highest peak is [[Toubkal]], which is in southwestern Morocco, with an elevation of {{convert|4167|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kids.britannica.com/students/article/Atlas-Mountains/273001|title=Atlas Mountains - Students {{!}} Britannica Kids {{!}} Homework Help|website=kids.britannica.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Atlas mountains are primarily inhabited by [[Berbers|Berber]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/atlas-mountains-facts-and-location.html|title=Atlas Mountains: Facts and Location {{!}} Study.com|work=Study.com|access-date=2017-07-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms for 'mountain' are ''adrar'' and ''adras'' in some [[Berber languages]]. These terms are believed to be [[cognate]]s of the [[Toponymy|toponym]] ''Atlas''. The mountains are also home to a number of [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s which are mostly found within Africa but some of which can be found in Europe. Many of these species are [[endangered]] and a few are already [[extinct]].

==Geology==
[[File:Atlas-Mountains-Labeled-2.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.75|Map showing the location of the Atlas Mountains across North Africa]]

The [[basement rock]] of most of Africa was formed during the [[Precambrian]] supereon and is much older than the Atlas Mountains lying on the continent. The Atlas was formed during three subsequent phases of Earth's geology.

The first tectonic deformation phase involves only the [[Anti-Atlas]], which was formed in the [[Paleozoic]] Era (~300&amp;nbsp;million years ago) as the result of continental [[collision]]s. [[North America]], [[Europe]] and [[Africa]] were connected millions of years ago.
[[File:Atlas Mountains tectonic plates.png|thumb|The tectonic boundary]]
The Anti-Atlas Mountains are believed to have originally been formed as part of [[Alleghenian orogeny]]. These mountains were formed when Africa and America collided, and were once a chain rivaling today's [[Himalayas]]. Today, the remains of this chain can be seen in the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line region]] in the [[Eastern United States]]. Some remnants can also be found in the later formed [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] in North America.

A second phase took place during the [[Mesozoic]] Era (before ~66 My). It consisted of a widespread extension of the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]] that [[rift]]ed and separated the continents mentioned above. This extension was responsible for the formation of many thick intracontinental [[sedimentary basin]]s including the present Atlas. Most of the rocks forming the surface of the present High Atlas were deposited under the ocean at that time.

Finally, in the [[Paleogene]] and [[Neogene]] Periods (~66&amp;nbsp;million to ~1.8&amp;nbsp;million years ago), the mountain chains that today constitute the Atlas were uplifted, as the land masses of Europe and Africa collided at the southern end of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Such [[Plate tectonics#Convergent (destructive) boundaries|convergent tectonic boundaries]] occur where two plates slide towards each other forming a [[subduction]] zone (if one plate moves underneath the other), and/or a [[orogeny|continental collision]] (when the two plates contain [[continental crust]]). In the case of the Africa-Europe collision, it is clear that tectonic convergence is partially responsible for the formation of the [[High Atlas]], as well as for the closure of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and the formation of the [[Alps]] and the [[Pyrenees]]. However, there is a lack of evidence for the nature of the subduction in the Atlas region, or for the thickening of the Earth's crust generally associated with continental collisions. In fact, one of the most striking features of the Atlas to geologists is the relative small amount of crustal thickening and tectonic shortening despite the important altitude of the mountain range. Recent studies suggest that deep processes rooted in the Earth's mantle may have contributed to the uplift of the High and Middle Atlas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://einstein.uab.cat/c_geotectonica/WebAtlas/AtlasLitho.htm UAB.es]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Potential field modelling of the Atlas [[lithosphere]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://einstein.uab.cat/c_geotectonica/WebAtlas/MaterialAtlas/Ayarzaetal2005.pdf UAB.es]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Crustal structure under the central High Atlas Mountains (Morocco) from geological and gravity data'', P. Ayarza, et al., 2005, Tectonophysics, 400, 67-84&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Atlas Mountain range.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|View of the mountains]]
===Natural resources===
The Atlas are rich in [[natural resources]]. There are deposits of [[iron ore]], [[lead ore]], [[copper]], [[silver]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[rock salt]], [[phosphate]], [[marble]], [[anthracite coal]] and [[natural gas]] among other resources.

==Subranges==
[[File:Morocco High Atlas Mountains.jpg|thumb|Satellite photograph of the High Atlas and Anti-Atlas Mountains. North is at the bottom; the city of [[Goulmima]] can be seen at center left.|upright=1.59]]
The range can be divided into four general regions:

* [[Anti-Atlas]], [[High Atlas]] and [[Middle Atlas]] (Morocco)
* [[Tell Atlas]] (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia)
* [[Aurès Mountains]] (Algeria, Tunisia)
* [[Saharan Atlas]] (Algeria)

===Anti-Atlas===
{{main|Anti-Atlas}}

The Anti-Atlas extends from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the southwest of Morocco toward the northeast to the heights of [[Ouarzazate]] and further east to the city of [[Tafilalt]] (altogether a distance of approximately {{convert|500|km|mi|disp=or}}). In the south it borders the [[Sahara]]. The easternmost point of the anti-Atlas is the [[Jbel Saghro]] range and its northern boundary is flanked by sections of the [[High Atlas|High Atlas range]]. It includes the Djebel Siroua, a massif of volcanic origin with the highest summit of the range at 3,304 m. The Jebel Bani is a much lower range running along the southern side of the Anti Atlas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vchery.free.fr/mektoub/maroc/maroc.htm Des Montagnes du Sarho aux dunes de Merzouga]&lt;/ref&gt;

===High Atlas===
[[Image:AtlasOasis.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|High Atlas, Morocco]]
{{main|High Atlas}}

The High Atlas in central Morocco rises in the west at the [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic coast]] and stretches in an eastern direction to the Moroccan-Algerian border. It has several peaks over {{convert|4000|m|mile|abbr=on}}, including the highest summit in North Africa, [[Toubkal]] ({{convert|4167|m|ft|abbr=on}}) and further east Ighil [[m'Goun]] ({{convert|4071|m|ft|abbr=on}}) the second major summit of the range. At the Atlantic and to the southwest, the range drops abruptly and makes a transition to the coast and the Anti-Atlas range. To the north, in the direction of [[Marrakesh]], the range descends less abruptly. On the heights of [[Ouarzazate]] the massif is cut through by the [[Draa River|Draa Valley]] which opens southward. It is mainly inhabited by Berber people, who live in small villages and cultivate the high plains of the [[Ourika River|Ourika Valley]]. Near Barrage Cavagnac&lt;ref name=engineer&gt;{{lang-fr|[http://mangin2marrakech.canalblog.com/archives/2017/04/11/35168981.html L'INGÉNIEUR CAVAGNAC, un nom bien connu des Anciens de Marrakech.... ]}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is a [[hydroelectric]] [[dam]] that has created the artificial lake [[Lalla Takerkoust]]. The lake serves also as a source for fish for the local fishermen.

The largest villages and towns of the area are [[Ouarzazate]], [[Tahannaout]], [[Amizmiz]], [[Imlil, Atlas Mountains|Imlil]], [[Tin Mal]] and [[Ijoukak]].

[[Image:Lake of Barrage Couvagnac Panoramic.jpg|thumb|upright=2.72|right|Panoramic picture of the artificial lake of Lalla Takerkoust near Barrage Cavagnac, with the [[hydroelectric]] [[dam]] (far right)]]

===Middle Atlas===
{{main|Middle Atlas}}

The Middle Atlas is completely in Morocco and is the northernmost of its three main Atlas ranges. The range lies north of the High Atlas, separated by the [[Moulouya River|Moulouya]] and [[Oum Er-Rbia River|Oum Er-Rbia]] rivers, and south of the [[Rif]] mountains, separated by the [[Sebou River]]. To the west are the main coastal plains of Morocco with many of the major cities and, to the east, the high barren plateau that lies between the Saharan and Tell Atlas. The high point of the range is the [[jbel Bou Naceur]] (3340m). The Middle Atlas experiences more rain than the ranges to the south, making it an important water catchment for the coastal plains and important for biodiversity. It is home to the majority of the world's population of [[Barbary macaque]].

===Saharan Atlas===
{{main|Saharan Atlas}}

The Saharan Atlas of [[Algeria]] is the eastern portion of the Atlas mountain range. Though not as high as the Grand Atlas, they are far more imposing than the Tell Atlas range that runs to the north of them and closer to the coast. The highest peak in the range is the {{convert|2236|m|ft|abbr=on}} high Djebel Aissa. They mark the northern edge of the [[Sahara Desert]]. The mountains see some rainfall and are better suited to agriculture than the [[plateau]] region to the north. Today, most of the population of the region are Berbers ([[Imazighen]]).{{cn|date=May 2020}}

===Tell Atlas===
{{main|Tell Atlas}}
[[Image:Panoramic view of typical Berber village (Morocco - High Atlas Mountains).jpg|thumb|upright=1.63|right|Panoramic view of typical Berber village in the [[Morocco|Moroccan]] part of the High Atlas]]

The Tell Atlas is a mountain chain over {{convert|1500|km|mi}} in length, belonging to the Atlas mountain ranges and stretching from Morocco, through Algeria to Tunisia. It parallels the [[Mediterranean]] coast and forms the northernmost of two more or less parallel ranges which gradually approach one another towards the east. The southernmost of the two ranges is the Saharan Atlas, and the two merge in eastern Algeria. The western end of the Tell Atlas is near the [[Middle Atlas]] range in Morocco. The area immediately to the south of the Tell Atlas is the high plateau of the [[Hautes Plaines]], with lakes in the wet season and salt flats in the dry.

===Aurès===
{{main|Aurès Mountains}}
[[File:Hammam Essalhine Aquae Flaviane Khenchela Mont View 2.jpg|thumb|right|Aures Mountains]]

The Aurès Mountains are the easternmost portion of the Atlas mountain range. It covers parts of [[Algeria]] and [[Tunisia]]. The [[Aurès]] [[natural region]] is named after the range.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/algeria/51.htm Algeria - Ethnic Groups and Languages]&lt;/ref&gt;

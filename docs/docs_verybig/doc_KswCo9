* {{cite book|last= Boole |first= George|title= An Investigation of the Laws of Thought on Which Are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities|date= 1854|publisher= Macmillan}} Reprinted with corrections, Dover Publications, New York, NY, 1958.

===Seasonal publication dates and differing calendar systems===&lt;!--This heading is linked to from WP:Manual_of_Style#Seasons and may also be from WP:Manual_of_Style#Titles.--&gt;
Publication dates, for both older and recent sources, should be written with the goal of helping the reader find the publication and, once found, confirm that the correct publication has been located. For example, if the publication date bears a date in the Julian calendar, it should not be converted to the Gregorian calendar.

If the publication date was given as a season or holiday, such as &quot;Winter&quot; or &quot;Christmas&quot; of a particular year or two-year span, it should not be converted to a month or date, such as {{!xt|July–August}} or {{!xt|December 25}}. If a publication provided both seasonal and specific dates, prefer the specific one.

===Additional annotation===
{{shortcut|WP:ANNOTATION|WP:FOOTQUOTE|WP:FQ}}
In most cases it is sufficient for a citation footnote simply to identify the source (as described in the sections above); readers can then consult the source to see how it supports the information in the article. Sometimes, however, it is useful to include additional [[annotation]] in the footnote, for example to indicate precisely which information the source is supporting (particularly when a single footnote lists more than one source – {{crossref|see {{section link||Bundling citations}} and {{section link||Text–source integrity}}, below}}).

A footnote may also contain a relevant exact quotation from the source. This is especially helpful when the cited text is long or dense. A quotation allows readers to immediately identify the applicable portion of the reference. Quotes are also useful if the source is not easily accessible.

In the case of non-English sources, it may be helpful to quote from the original text and then give an English translation. If the article itself contains a translation of a quote from such a source (without the original), then the original should be included in the footnote. {{crossref|(See the {{section link|WP:Verifiability|Non-English sources}} policy for more information.)}}

==Inline citations==
{{Shortcut|WP:INCITE|WP:INLINECITE}}
{{See|Wikipedia:Inline citation}}
Inline citations allow the reader to associate a given bit of material in an article with the specific reliable source(s) that support it. Inline citations are added using either [[#Footnotes|footnotes]] (long or [[#Shortened footnotes|short]]) or [[#Parenthetical referencing|parenthetical references]]. This section describes how to add either type, and also describes how to create a list of full bibliography citations to support shortened footnotes.

The first editor to add footnotes to an article must create a [[Help:section|section]] where those citations are to appear.

===Footnotes===
{{see also|Help:Footnotes}}
====How to create the list of citations====
{{Shortcut|WP:REFLIST}}
This section, if needed, is usually titled &quot;Notes&quot; or &quot;References&quot;, and is placed at or near the bottom of the article. For more about the order and titles of sections at the end of an article (which may also include &quot;Further reading&quot; and &quot;External links&quot; sections), see [[Wikipedia:Footers]].

With some exceptions discussed below, citations appear in a single section containing only the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;references /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag or the {{Tlx|Reflist}} template. For example:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;== References ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Reflist}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
The footnotes will then automatically be listed under that section heading. Each numbered footnote marker in the text is a clickable link to the corresponding footnote, and each footnote contains a [[caret]] that links back to the corresponding point in the text.

{{Anchor|Avoid scrolling lists|Scrolling lists|ASL}}{{Shortcut|WP:ASL}}
Scrolling lists, or lists of citations appearing within a [[scroll box]], should never be used. This is because of issues with readability, browser compatibility, [[Wikipedia:Accessibility|accessibility]], printing, and [[Wikipedia:Mirrors and forks|site mirroring]].{{notetag|See [[Wikipedia talk:Citing sources/Archive 18#Scrolling Reference Lists: Formal Policy Discussion|this July 2007 discussion]] for more detail on why scrolling reference lists should not be used.}}

If an article contains a list of [[#General reference|general references]], this is usually placed in a separate section, titled (for example) &quot;References&quot;. This usually comes immediately after the section(s) listing footnotes, if any. (If the general references section is called &quot;References&quot;, then the citations section is usually called &quot;Notes&quot;.)

====&lt;span id=&quot;Adding the citation&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Inline reference&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Footnotes and references&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;How to place an inline citation using ref tags====
{{Shortcut|WP:CITEFOOT}}
{{hatnote|Further information: [[Help:Footnotes#Footnotes: the basics|Footnotes: the basics]]}}
To create a footnote, use the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; syntax at the appropriate place in the article text, for example:
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Justice is a human invention.&lt;ref&gt;Rawls, John. ''A Theory of Justice''. Harvard University Press, 1971, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; It...&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
which will be displayed as something like:
* Justice is a human invention.{{dummy ref|1}} It...
It will also be necessary to generate the list of footnotes (where the citation text is actually displayed); for this, see the previous section.

As in the above example, citation markers are normally placed {{em|after}} adjacent punctuation such as periods (full stops) and commas. For exceptions, see the {{Section link|WP:Manual of Style#Punctuation and footnotes}}. Note also that no space is added before the citation marker. Citations should not be placed within, or on the same line as, section headings.

The citation should be added close to the material it supports, offering [[#Text–source integrity|text–source integrity]]. If a word or phrase is particularly contentious, an inline citation may be added next to that word or phrase within the sentence, but it is usually sufficient to add the citation to the end of the clause, sentence, or paragraph, so long as it's clear which source supports which part of the text.

====Separating citations from explanatory footnotes====
{{see also|Help:Explanatory notes}}
{{shortcut|WP:EXPLNOTESECT}}
If an article contains both footnoted citations and other (explanatory) footnotes, then it is possible (but not necessary) to divide them into two separate lists using [[Help:Footnotes#Footnotes: groups|footnotes groups]]. The explanatory footnotes and the citations are then placed in separate sections, called (for example) &quot;Notes&quot; and &quot;References&quot; respectively.

Another method of separating explanatory footnotes from footnoted references is using {{tl|efn}} for the explanatory footnotes. The advantage of this system is that the content of an explanatory footnote can in this case be referenced with a footnoted citation. When explanatory footnotes and footnoted references are not in separate lists, {{tl|refn}} can be used for explanatory footnotes containing footnoted citations.

====Avoiding clutter====
{{Shortcut|WP:ILCLUTTER|WP:INLINECLUTTER|WP:INLINECITECLUTTER}}
Inline references can significantly bloat the wikitext in the edit window and can become difficult to manage and confusing. There are two main methods to avoid [[clutter]] in the edit window:
* Using [[Help:Footnotes#List-defined_references|list-defined references]] by collecting the full citation code within the [[Template:Reflist#List-defined references|reference list template]] {{tlg|reflist|nolink=yes}}, and then inserting them in the text with a shortened reference tag, for example &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 2001, p99&quot; /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
* Inserting [[#Short citations|short citations]] (see below) that then refer to a full list of source texts

As with other citation formats, articles should not undergo large-scale conversion between formats without consensus to do so.

Note, however, that references defined in the reference list template can no longer be edited with the [[Wikipedia:VisualEditor|VisualEditor]].

====Repeated citations====
{{hatnote|Further information: [[Help:Footnotes#Footnotes: using a source more than once|Footnotes: using a source more than once]]}}

For multiple use of the same inline citation or footnote, you can use the [[WP:NAMEDREFS|named references]] feature, choosing a name to identify the inline citation, and typing {{tag|ref|params=name=&quot;&lt;var&gt;name&lt;/var&gt;&quot;|content=text of the citation}}. Thereafter, the same named reference may be reused any number of times either before or after the defining use by typing the previous reference name, like this: {{tag|ref|params=name=&quot;&lt;var&gt;name&lt;/var&gt;&quot;|s}}. The use of the slash before the &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; means that the tag is self-closing, and the {{tag|ref|c}} used to close other references must not be used in addition.

The text of the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; can be almost anything{{nsmdns}}apart from being completely numeric. If spaces are used in the text of the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;, the text must be placed within double quotes. Placing all named references within double quotes may be helpful to future editors who do not know that rule. To help with page maintenance, it is recommended that the text of the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; have a connection to the inline citation or footnote, for example &quot;author year page&quot;: {{tag|ref|params=name=&quot;&lt;var&gt;Smith 2005 p94&lt;/var&gt;&quot;|content=text of the citation}}.

Use straight quotation marks &lt;code&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; to enclose the reference name. Do not use curly quotation marks &lt;code&gt;“”&lt;/code&gt;. Curly marks are treated as another character, not as delimiters. The page will display an error if one style of quotation marks is used when first naming the reference, and the other style is used in a repeated reference, or if a mix of styles is used in the repeated references.

====&lt;span id=&quot;MultiPages&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Citing multiple pages of the same source====
{{anchor|IBID|op.cit.}}{{shortcut|WP:IBID}}
{{see|Help:References and page numbers}}

When an article cites many different pages from the same source, to avoid the redundancy of many big, nearly identical full citations, most Wikipedia editors use one of these options:
* [[WP:NAMEDREFS|Named references]] in conjunction with a combined list of page numbers using the [[Help:Citation Style 1#Pages|{{para|pages}}]] parameter of the {{tl|cite}} templates (most commonly used, but can become confusing for large number of pages)
* Named references in conjunction with the {{tl2|rp}} or {{tl2|r}} templates to specify the page
* [[WP:CITESHORT|Short citations]]

The use of ''[[ibid.]]'', ''[[id.]]'', or similar abbreviations is discouraged, as they may become broken as new references are added (''[[op. cit.]]'' is less problematic in that it should refer explicitly to a citation contained in the article; however, not all readers are familiar with the meaning of the terms). If the use of ''ibid'' is extensive, tag the article using the {{tl|ibid}} template.

====Duplicate citations====
{{anchor|DupCites|DUPCITES}}{{shortcuts|WP:DUPCITES|WP:DUPREF}}
Combine ''precisely duplicated full citations'', in keeping with the existing citation style (if any). In this context &quot;precisely duplicated&quot; means having the same content, not necessarily identical strings (&quot;The New York Times&quot; is the same as &quot;NY Times&quot;; different access-dates are not significant). Do not discourage editors, particularly [[WP:BITE|inexperienced]] ones, from adding duplicate citations when the use of the source is appropriate, because a duplicate is better than no citation. But any editor should feel free to combine them, and doing so is the best practice on Wikipedia.

''Citations to different pages or parts of the same source'' can also be combined (preserving the distinct parts of the citations), as described in the previous section. Any method that is consistent with the existing citation style (if any) may be used, or consensus can be sought to change the existing style.

Finding duplicate citations by examining reference lists is difficult. There are some tools that can help:
* [[Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser|AutoWikiBrowser]] (AWB) will identify and (usually) correct ''exact duplicates'' between &amp;lt;ref&gt;...&amp;lt;/ref&gt; tags. See [[Wikipedia:HTADC|the documentation]].
* [https://www.convertcsv.com/url-extractor.htm URL Extractor For Web Pages and Text] can help identify Web citations with the ''exact same URL'' but not necessarily exact duplicates.
** Step 1: enter the URL of the Wikipedia article and click &quot;Load&quot;,
** Step 2: tick &quot;Only Display duplicate URL addresses&quot; (which unticks &quot;Remove duplicate addresses&quot;)
** Step 3: Click Extract.
** Then the duplicates (possibly with false positives) must be manually merged.

====Short citations &lt;span id=&quot;Shortened footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;====
{{anchor|CITESHORT|SFN}}{{shortcut|WP:CITESHORT|WP:SFN}}
{{main|Help:Shortened footnotes}}
Some Wikipedia articles use ''short citations'', giving summary information about the source together with a page number, as in {{tag|ref|content=Smith 2010, p. 1.}}. These are used together with ''full citations'', which give full details of the sources, but without page numbers, and are listed in a separate &quot;References&quot; section.

Forms of short citations used include author-date referencing ([[APA style]], [[Harvard style]], or [[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago style]]), and author-title or author-page referencing ([[The MLA Style Manual|MLA style]] or Chicago style). As before, the list of footnotes is automatically generated in a &quot;Notes&quot; or &quot;Footnotes&quot; section, which immediately precedes the &quot;References&quot; section containing the full citations to the source. Short citations can be written manually, or by using the [[Template:Harvard citation documentation#Shortened footnote|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{sfn}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{harvnb}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;]] templates. (Note that templates should not be added without consensus to an article that already uses a consistent referencing style.) The short citations and full citations may be linked so that the reader can click on the short note to find full information about the source. See the [[Template:harvard citation documentation|template documentation]] for details and solutions to common problems. For variations with and without templates, see [[/Further considerations#Wikilinks to full references|wikilinks to full references]]. For a set of realistic examples, see [[Wikipedia:Citing sources/Example edits for different methods#Shortened notes|these]].

This is how short citations look in the edit box:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:black;&quot;&gt;'''Miller, Edward (2005). &lt;nowiki&gt;''The Sun''.&lt;/nowiki&gt; Academic Press'''&lt;/span&gt;.

This is how they look in the article:{{anchor|refnote}}

&lt;li id=&quot;noteFoot03b&quot;

----
* Brown, Rebecca (2006). &quot;Size of the Moon&quot;, ''Scientific American'', 51(78).
* Miller, Edward (2005). ''The Sun''. Academic Press.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shortened notes using titles rather than publication dates would look like this in the article:
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background:white; padding:1em; border:1px solid #999;&quot;&gt;&lt;!--code for display--&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:medium&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;noteFoot02b&quot;
&gt;'''[[#nbFoot02b|^]]''' Brown, &quot;Size of the Moon&quot;, p. 46.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;noteFoot03b&quot;
&gt;'''[[#nbFoot03b|^]]''' Miller, ''The Sun'', p. 34.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When using manual links it is easy to introduce errors such as duplicate anchors and unused references. The script [[User:Ucucha/HarvErrors]] will show many related errors. Duplicate anchors may be found by using the [[W3C Markup Validation Service]].

===Parenthetical referencing===
&lt;!--{{see|Wikipedia:Parenthetical referencing}}--&gt;
{{Update|this section|talk=Querying closer of CITEVAR RfC on recent diff|reason=Parenthetical referencing on Wikipedia was [[Special:PermanentLink/976895063#Deprecate parenthetical citations|deprecated in September 2020]], and this section needs to be revised accordingly|date=September 2020}}
While most articles use footnote citations as described in the above sections, some articles use a [[parenthetical referencing]] style. Here, short citations in parentheses, such as {{xt|(Smith 2010, p. 1)}}, are placed within the article text itself. Full details of each source used are given in a ''full citation'', e.g., {{xt|Smith, John. ''Name of Book''. Cambridge University Press, 2010}}. The full citations are listed in alphabetical order, according to the authors' surnames, at the end of the article in a &quot;References&quot; section.

Short citations that use {{tag|ref|o}} tags are not parenthetical references; see the [[#Short citations|section on short citations]] above for that method. The inline citation and full citation may be linked using a template&lt;!-- (see [[WP:Parenthetical referencing#Linking inline and full citations|linking inline and full citations]])--&gt;; as with other citation templates, these should not be added to articles without consensus.

This is how it looks in the edit box:

 The Sun is pretty big &lt;span style=&quot;color:black;&quot;&gt;'''(Miller 2005, p. 1)'''&lt;/span&gt;, but the Moon is not so big &lt;span style=&quot;color:black;&quot;&gt;'''(Brown 2006, p. 2)'''&lt;/span&gt;. The Sun is also quite hot &lt;span style=&quot;color:black;&quot;&gt;'''(Miller 2005, p. 3)'''&lt;/span&gt;.
 &lt;span style=&quot;color:#666;&quot;&gt;&amp;#61;= References ==&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:black;&quot;&gt;'''Brown, R (2006). &quot;Size of the Moon&quot;, &lt;nowiki&gt;''Scientific American''&lt;/nowiki&gt;, 51(78)'''&lt;/span&gt;.
 &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:black;&quot;&gt;'''Miller, E (2005). &lt;nowiki&gt;''The Sun''&lt;/nowiki&gt;, Academic Press'''&lt;/span&gt;.

This is how it looks in the article:
{{block indent|style=background: white; padding: 1em; border: 1px solid #999;|1=
The Sun is pretty big (Miller 2005, p. 1), but the Moon is not so big (Brown 2006, p. 2). The Sun is also quite hot (Miller 2005, p. 3).
{{fake heading|References}}

Notice that, unlike footnotes, parenthetical references are placed {{em|before}} adjacent punctuation such as commas and periods.

==Citation style &lt;span id=&quot;Citation styles&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;==
{{Under discussion|section|talk=citation style}}
{{shortcut|WP:CITESTYLE}}
While citations should aim to provide the information listed above, Wikipedia does not have a single [[style guide|house style]], though citations within any given article should follow a consistent style. A number of citation styles exist including those described in the Wikipedia articles for [[Citation]], [[APA style]], [[ASA style]], [[MLA style]], ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'', [[Author-date referencing]], the [[Vancouver system]] and ''[[Bluebook]]''.

Although nearly any consistent style may be used, {{em|avoid}} all-numeric date formats other than YYYY-MM-DD, because of the ambiguity concerning which number is the month and which the day. For example, {{xt|2002-06-11}} may be used, but not {{!xt|11/06/2002}}. The YYYY-MM-DD format should in any case be limited to [[Gregorian calendar]] dates where the year is after 1582. Because it could easily be confused with a range of years, the format YYYY-MM is not used.

For more information on the capitalization of cited works, see {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters|All caps and small caps}}.

}}
{{shortcut|WP:CITEVAR|WP:WHENINROME}}
Editors should not attempt to change an article's established citation style merely on the grounds of personal preference, to make it match other articles, or without first seeking [[WP:Consensus|consensus]] for the change. The arbitration committee [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Sortan#Preferred styles|ruled in 2006]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Wikipedia does not mandate styles in many different areas; these include (but are not limited to) American vs. British spelling, date formats, and citation style. Where Wikipedia does not mandate a specific style, editors should not attempt to convert Wikipedia to their own preferred style, nor should they edit articles for the sole purpose of converting them to their preferred style, or removing examples of, or references to, styles which they dislike.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As with [[WP:ENGVAR|spelling differences]], it is normal practice to defer to the style used by the first major contributor or adopted by the consensus of editors already working on the page, unless a change in consensus has been achieved. If the article you are editing is already using a particular citation style, you should follow it; if you believe it is inappropriate for the needs of the article, seek consensus for a change on the talk page. If you are the first contributor to add citations to an article, you may choose whichever style you think best for the article.

If all or most of the citations in an article consist of bare URLs, or otherwise fail to provide needed bibliographic data &amp;ndash; such as the name of the source, the title of the article or web page consulted, the author (if known), the publication date (if known), and the page numbers (where relevant) &amp;ndash; then that would not count as a &quot;consistent citation style&quot; and can be changed freely to insert such data. The data provided should be sufficient to uniquely identify the source, allow readers to find it, and allow readers to initially evaluate it without retrieving it.

====To be avoided====
When an article is already consistent, avoid:
* switching between major citation styles, e.g., [[WP:PAREN|parenthetical]] and [[Help:Footnotes|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags]], or replacing the preferred style of one academic discipline with another's;
* adding citation templates to an article that already uses a consistent system without templates, or removing citation templates from an article that uses them consistently;
* changing where the references are defined, e.g., moving [[WP:LDRHOW|reference definitions in the reflist]] to the prose, or moving reference definitions from the prose into the reflist.

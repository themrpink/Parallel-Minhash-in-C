Furthermore, the Franks were dressed for the cold. The Arabs had very light clothing more suitable for North African winters than European winters.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The battle eventually became a waiting game in which the Muslims did not want to attack an army that could possibly be numerically superior and wanted the Franks to come out into the open. The Franks formed up in a thick defensive formation and waited for them to charge uphill. The battle finally began on the seventh day, as 'Abd-al-Raḥmân did not want to wait any longer, with winter approaching.

===Engagement===
[[File:Young Folks' History of Rome illus442, Battle of Tours.png|thumb|upright|Western knight fighting against an Arabian horseman (illustration from the 19th century)]]

'Abd-al-Raḥmân trusted in the tactical superiority of his cavalry and had them charge repeatedly. The disciplined Frankish soldiers withstood the assaults, though according to Arab sources, the Arab cavalry broke into the Frankish square several times. Despite this, the Franks did not break. The well-trained Frankish soldiers accomplished what was not thought possible at that time: infantry withstanding a heavy cavalry charge. Paul Davis says the core of Charles' army was a professional infantry which was both highly disciplined and well motivated, &quot;having campaigned with him all over Europe&quot;.

===Turning point===
Umayyad troops who had broken into the square had tried to kill Charles, but his [[Feudalism|liege]] men surrounded him and would not be broken. The battle was still in flux when – Frankish histories claim – a rumour went through the Umayyad army that Frankish scouts threatened the booty that they had taken from [[Bordeaux]]. Some of the Umayyad troops at once broke off the battle and returned to camp to secure their loot. According to Muslim accounts, in the midst of the fighting on the second day (Frankish accounts have the battle lasting one day only), scouts from the Franks sent by Charles began to raid the camp and supply train (including slaves and other plunder).{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Charles supposedly had sent scouts to cause chaos in the Umayyad base camp, and free as many of the slaves as possible, hoping to draw off part of his foe. This succeeded, as many of the Umayyad cavalry returned to their camp. To the rest of the Muslim army, this appeared to be a full-scale retreat, and soon it became one.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Both Western and Muslim histories agree that while trying to stop the retreat, 'Abd-al-Raḥmân became surrounded, which led to his death, and the Umayyad troops then withdrew altogether to their camp. &quot;All the host fled before the enemy&quot;, candidly wrote one Arabic source, &quot;and many died in the flight&quot;. The Franks resumed their phalanx, and rested in place through the night, believing the battle would resume at dawn the following morning.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Following day===
The next day, when the Umayyad forces did not renew the battle, the Franks feared an ambush. Charles at first believed that the Umayyad forces were trying to lure him down the hill and into the open. This tactic he knew he had to resist at all costs; he had in fact disciplined his troops for years to under no circumstances break formation and come out in the open.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Only after extensive reconnaissance of the Umayyad camp by Frankish soldiers – which by both historical accounts had been so hastily abandoned that even the tents remained, as the Umayyad forces headed back to [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] with whatever loot they could carry – was it discovered that the Muslims had retreated during the night.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Contemporary accounts===
The [[Mozarabic Chronicle of 754]] &quot;describes the battle in greater detail than any other Latin or Arabic source&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Watson|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; It says of the encounter that,

{{quote|While Abd ar-Rahman was pursuing Odo, he decided to despoil Tours by destroying its palaces and burning its churches. There he confronted the consul of Austrasia by the name of Charles, a man who, having proved himself to be a warrior from his youth and an expert in things military, had been summoned by Odo. After each side had tormented the other with raids for almost seven days, they finally prepared their battle lines and fought fiercely. The northern peoples remained as immobile as a wall, holding together like a glacier in the cold regions. In the blink of an eye, they annihilated the Arabs with the sword. The people of Austrasia, greater in number of soldiers and formidably armed, killed the king, Abd ar-Rahman, when they found him, striking him on the chest. But suddenly, within sight of the countless tents of the Arabs, the Franks despicably sheathed their swords postponing the fight until the next day since night had fallen during the battle. Rising from their own camp at dawn, the Europeans saw the tents and canopies of the Arabs all arranged just as they had appeared the day before. Not knowing that they were empty and thinking that inside them there were Saracen forces ready for battle, they sent officers to reconnoitre and discovered that all the Ishmaelite troops had left. They had indeed fled silently by night in tight formation, returning to their own country.|Wolf (trans.)||''Chronicle of 754'', p. 145}}

Charles Martel's family composed, for the fourth book of the ''[[Chronicle of Fredegar#Continuations|Continuations of Fredegar's Chronicle]]'', a stylised summary of the battle:

{{quote|Prince Charles boldly drew up his battle lines against them [the Arabs] and the warrior rushed in against them. With Christ's help he overturned their tents, and hastened to battle to grind them small in slaughter. The king Abdirama having been killed, he destroyed [them], driving forth the army, he fought and won. Thus did the victor triumph over his enemies.|Fouracre||''Continuations of Fredegar'', p. 149}}

This source details further that &quot;he (Charles Martel) came down upon them like a great man of battle&quot;. It goes on to say Charles &quot;scattered them like the stubble&quot;.

The Latin word used for &quot;warrior&quot;, ''{{lang|la|belligerator}}'', &quot;is from the [[Books of the Maccabees|Book of Maccabees]], chapters 15 and 16&quot;, which describe huge battles.&lt;ref&gt;Fouracre, 2000, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that [[Bede]]'s ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'' (Book V, Chapter XXIV) includes a reference to the Battle of Poitiers: &quot;...{{nbsp}}a dreadful plague of Saracens ravaged France with miserable slaughter, but they not long after in that country received the punishment due to their wickedness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bede, 1847, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategic analysis===
Gibbon makes the point{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} that 'Abd-al-Raḥmân did not move at once against Charles Martel, and was surprised by him at Tours as Charles had marched over the mountains avoiding the roads to surprise the Muslim invaders. Thus, Charles selected the time and place they would collide.

'Abd-al-Raḥmân was a good general, but failed to do two things he should have done before the battle:
* He either assumed that the Franks would not come to the aid of their Aquitanian rivals, or did not care, and he thus failed to assess their strength before invasion.
* He failed to scout the movements of the [[Frankish Empire|Frankish]] army.

These failures disadvantaged the Muslim army in the following ways:
* The invaders were burdened with booty that played a role in the battle.
* They had casualties before they fought the battle.
* Weaker opponents such as Odo were not bypassed, whom they could have picked off at will later, while moving at once to force battle with the real power in Europe and at least partially pick the battlefield.

While some military historians point out that leaving enemies in your rear is not generally wise, the Mongols proved that indirect attack, and bypassing weaker foes to eliminate the strongest first, can be a devastatingly effective mode of invasion. In this case, those enemies were virtually no danger, given the ease with which the Muslims destroyed them. The real danger was Charles, and the failure to scout Gaul adequately was disastrous.

According to [[Edward Shepherd Creasy|Creasy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genealogieonline.nl/en/demmers-harmeijer-extended-family/I12884.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903150853/https://www.genealogieonline.nl/en/demmers-harmeijer-extended-family/I12884.php|url-status=dead|archive-date=2018-09-03|title=Charles &quot;the Hammer&quot; Martel King of the Franks|last=Henny|first=Carlisle|date=|website=genealogieonline|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; both western and Muslim histories agree the battle was hard fought, and that the Umayyad heavy cavalry had broken into the square, but agreed that the Franks were in formation still strongly resisting.

Charles could not afford to stand idly by while Frankish territories were threatened. He would have to face the Umayyad armies sooner or later, and his men were enraged by the utter devastation of the Aquitanians and wanted to fight. But Sir Edward Creasy noted that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;when we remember that Charles had no standing army, and the independent spirit of the Frank warriors who followed his standard, it seems most probable that it was not in his power to adopt the cautious policy of watching the invaders, and wearing out their strength by delay. So dreadful and so widespread were the ravages of the Saracenic light cavalry throughout Gaul, that it must have been impossible to restrain for any length of time the indignant ardor of the Franks. And, even if Charles could have persuaded his men to look tamely on while the Arabs stormed more towns and desolated more districts, he could not have kept an army together when the usual period of a military expedition had expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Creasy|Speed|2001|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both [[Henry Hallam|Hallam]] and [[William E. Watson|Watson]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson&quot; /&gt; argue that had Charles failed, there was no remaining force to protect Western Europe. Hallam perhaps said it best: &quot;It may justly be reckoned among those few battles of which a contrary event would have essentially varied the drama of the world in all its subsequent scenes: with [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]], [[Battle of Gaugamela|Arbela]], the [[Battle of the Metaurus|Metaurus]], [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains|Châlons]] and [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;quoted in {{harvnb|Creasy|Speed|2001|page=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strategically, and tactically, Charles probably made the best decision he could in waiting until his enemies least expected him to intervene, and then marching by stealth to catch them by surprise at a battlefield of his choosing. Probably he and his own men did not realize the seriousness of the battle they had fought, as one historian put it: &quot;few battles are remembered over 1,000 years after they are fought, but the Battle of Poitiers is an exception ... Charles Martel turned back a Muslim raid that had it been allowed to continue, might have conquered Gaul.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bennett|Bradsbury|DeVries|Dickie|2013|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Collins]] disputes interpretations of ever expanding Umayyad forces, reminding their internal cohesion problems and the capture of [[Autun]] in 725, when the Burgundian stronghold was captured and sacked, then just abandoned by [[Anbasa ibn Suhaym al-Kalbi|Anbasa]]'s raiding forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|1989|pages=87-91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Victory for Charles Martel ==
[[File:Charles Martel at Battle of Tours, Great Chronicles of France (27686528435).jpg|thumb|300x300px|Charles Martel at the Battle of Tours, depicted in the ''[[Grandes Chroniques de France]]'']]

===Umayyad retreat and second invasion===
The Umayyad army retreated south over the [[Pyrenees]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott, John C. {{Google books|5CyXBHYGaDIC|Battle of Tours}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles continued to expand south in subsequent years. After the death of Odo (c. 735), who had reluctantly acknowledged Charles' [[suzerainty]] in 719, Charles wished to unite Odo's duchy to himself, and went there to elicit the proper [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] of the Aquitanians. But the nobility proclaimed Hunald, Odo's son, as the Duke, and Charles recognized his legitimacy when the Umayyads entered [[Provence]] as part of an alliance with Duke [[Maurontus]] the next year.&lt;ref&gt;Fouracre, 2000, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunald, who originally resisted acknowledging Charles as overlord, soon had little choice. He acknowledged Charles as his overlord, albeit not for long, and Charles confirmed his Duchy.

====Umayyad invasion (735–39)====
In 735, the new governor of al-Andalus again invaded Gaul. [[Antonio Santosuosso]] and other historians detail how the new governor of Al-Andalus, Uqba ibn Al-Hajjaj, again moved into France to avenge the defeat at Poitiers and to spread Islam. According to Santosuosso, [[Uqba ibn al-Hajjaj]] converted about 2,000 Christians he captured over his career. In the last major attempt at an invasion of Gaul through Iberia, a sizable expedition was assembled at [[Zaragoza|Saragossa]] and entered what is now French territory in 735, crossed the River Rhone and captured and looted [[Arles]]. From there, he struck into the heart of Provence, ending with the capture of [[Avignon]], despite strong resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Santosuosso2004p126&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Santosuosso|2004|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uqba ibn al-Hajjaj's forces remained in Septimania and part of Provence for four years carrying raids to Lyons, Burgundy, and Piedmont. Charles Martel invaded Septimania in two campaigns in 736 and 739, but was forced back again to Frankish territory under his control. Alessandro Santosuosso strongly argues that the second (Umayyad) expedition was probably more dangerous than the first. The second expedition's failure{{Specify|reason=Loose assertion lacking in detail}} put an end to any serious Muslim expedition across the [[Pyrenees]], although raids continued. Plans for further large-scale attempts were hindered by internal turmoil in the Umayyad lands which often made enemies out of their own kind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Santosuosso2004p126&quot; /&gt;

===Advance to Narbonne===
Despite the defeat at Tours, the Umayyads remained in control of Narbonne and [[Septimania]] for another 27 years, though they could not expand further. The treaties reached earlier with the local population stood firm and were further consolidated in 734 when the governor of Narbonne, [[Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri]], concluded agreements with several towns on common defense arrangements against the encroachments of Charles Martel, who had systematically brought the south to heel as he extended his domains. He conquered Umayyad fortresses and destroyed their garrisons at the [[Siege of Avignon (737)|Siege of Avignon]] and the [[Siege of Nîmes]].

The army attempting to relieve Narbonne met Charles in open battle at the [[Battle of the River Berre]] and was destroyed. However, Charles failed in his attempt to take Narbonne at the [[Siege of Narbonne (737)|Siege of Narbonne]] in 737, when the city was jointly defended by its Muslim Arab and Berber, and its Christian [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] citizens.

===Carolingian dynasty===
{{Main|Francia|Carolingian Empire|Pepin the Short|Charlemagne}}

Reluctant to tie down his army for a siege that could last years, and believing he could not afford the losses of an all-out frontal assault such as he had used at [[Arles]], Charles was content to isolate the few remaining invaders in [[Narbonne]] and [[Septimania]]. The threat of invasion was diminished after the Umayyad defeat at Narbonne, and the unified [[Caliphate]] would collapse into [[civil war]] in 750 at the [[Battle of the Zab]].

It was left to Charles' son, [[Pepin the Short]], to force Narbonne's surrender in 759, thus bringing Narbonne into the Frankish domains. The [[Umayyad dynasty]] was expelled, driven back to Al-Andalus where [[Abd al-Rahman I]] established an emirate in Córdoba in opposition to the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] Caliph in [[Baghdad]].

In the northeast of Spain the Frankish emperors established the [[Marca Hispanica]] across the [[Pyrenees]] in part of what today is [[Catalonia]], reconquering [[Girona]] in 785 and [[Barcelona]] in 801. This formed a buffer zone against Muslim lands across the [[Pyrenees]]. Historian J.M. Roberts said in 1993 of the Carolingian Dynasty:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It produced Charles Martel, the soldier who turned the Arabs back at Tours, and the supporter of [[Saint Boniface]] the Evangelizer of Germany. This is a considerable double mark to have left on the history of Europe.&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;Roberts,J.M. ''The New History of the World''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Before the Battle of Tours, stirrups may have been unknown in the west. [[Lynn Townsend White Jr.]] argues that the adoption of the stirrup for cavalry was the direct cause for the development of feudalism in the Frankish realm by Charles Martel and his heirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White|1962|pages=1–38}}. However White denied the importance of Tours in Charles Martel's reforms, both because they began the year before the battle (White accepted 733 as the battle year) and because [[Claudio Sánchez-Albornoz y Menduiña|Claudio Sanchez-Albornoz]] &quot;has shown that even twenty years after Martel's death the Spanish Muslims used cavalry only in small numbers&quot; (p.12).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical and macrohistorical views==
[[File:Charles Martel fighting the Saracens at Tours-Poitiers in 732, Great Chronicles of France (27408010460).jpg|left|thumb|The Battle of Tours depicted in the ''Grandes Chroniques de France'']]
The historical views of this battle fall into three great phases, both in the East and especially in the West. Western historians, beginning with the ''Mozarabic Chronicle of 754'', stressed the macrohistorical impact of the battle, as did the ''Continuations of Fredegar''. This became a claim that Charles had saved Christianity, as Gibbon and his generation of historians agreed that the Battle of Tours was unquestionably decisive in world history.

Modern historians have essentially fallen into two camps on the issue. The first camp essentially agrees with Gibbon, and the other argues that the Battle has been massively overstated – turned from a raid in force to an invasion, and from a mere annoyance to the Caliph to a shattering defeat that helped end the Islamic Expansion Era. It is essential however, to note that within the first group, those who agree the Battle was of macrohistorical importance, there are a number of historians who take a more moderate and nuanced view of the significance of the battle, in contrast to the more dramatic and rhetorical approach of Gibbon. The best example of this school is William E. Watson, who does believe the battle has such importance, as will be discussed below, but analyzes it militarily, culturally and politically, rather than seeing it as a classic &quot;Muslim versus Christian&quot; confrontation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson&quot; /&gt;

In the East, Arab histories followed a similar path. First, the battle was regarded as a disastrous defeat; then, it largely faded from Arab histories, leading to a modern dispute which regards it as either a secondary loss to the great defeat of the [[Siege of Constantinople (717–718)|Second Siege of Constantinople]], where the Bulgarian Emperor [[Tervel of Bulgaria|Tervel]] played a crucial role, or a part of a series of great macrohistorical defeats which together brought about the fall of the first Caliphate. With the Byzantines and Bulgarians together with the Franks both successfully blocking further expansion, internal social troubles came to a head, starting with the Great [[Berber Revolt]] of 740, and ending with the [[Battle of the Zab]], and the destruction of the Umayyad Caliphate.

===In Western history===
The first wave of real &quot;modern&quot; historians, especially scholars on Rome and the medieval period, such as [[Edward Gibbon]], contended that had Charles fallen, the Umayyad Caliphate would have easily conquered a divided Europe. Gibbon famously observed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A victorious line of march had been prolonged above a thousand miles from the rock of Gibraltar to the banks of the Loire; the repetition of an equal space would have carried the Saracens to the confines of Poland and the Highlands of Scotland; the Rhine is not more impassable than the Nile or Euphrates, and the Arabian fleet might have sailed without a naval combat into the mouth of the Thames. Perhaps the interpretation of the Koran would now be taught in the schools of Oxford, and her pulpits might demonstrate to a circumcised people the sanctity and truth of the revelation of Mahomet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/g/gibbon/decline/volume2/chap52.htm ''The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire'' by Edward Gibbon] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222124624/http://www.ccel.org/g/gibbon/decline/volume2/chap52.htm |date=2017-02-22 }}, Chapter LII.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nor was Gibbon alone in lavishing praise on Charles as the savior of [[Christendom]] and [[western civilization]]. [[H. G. Wells]] wrote: &quot;The Moslim{{sic}} when they crossed the [[Pyrenees]] in 720 found this Frankish kingdom under the practical rule of Charles Martel, the Mayor of the Palace of a degenerate descendant of Clovis, and experienced the decisive defeat of Poitiers (732) at his hands. This Charles Martel was practically overlord of Europe north of the Alps from the [[Pyrenees]] to Hungary. He ruled over a multitude of subordinate lords speaking French-Latin, and High and Low German languages.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wells, H.G. ''A Short History of the World'', Chapter XLV, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibbon was echoed a century later by the Belgian historian [[Godefroid Kurth]], who wrote that the Battle of Poitiers &quot;must ever remain one of the great events in the history of the world, as upon its issue depended whether [[Christian Civilization]] should continue or Islam prevail throughout Europe.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gilliard, Frank D., &quot;The Senators of Sixth-Century Gaul,&quot; ''Speculum'', Vol. 54, No. 4 (Oct., 1979), pp. 685–97&lt;/ref&gt;

German historians were especially ardent in their praise of Charles Martel; [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Schlegel]] speaks of this &quot;mighty victory&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Creasy 2001, p. 158&quot;&gt;quoted in {{harvnb|Creasy|Speed|2001|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tells how &quot;the arm of Charles Martel saved and delivered the Christian nations of the West from the deadly grasp of all-destroying Islam.&quot; Creasy quotes [[Leopold von Ranke]]'s opinion that this period was

&lt;blockquote&gt;one of the most important epochs in the history of the world, the commencement of the eighth century, when on the one side Mohammedanism threatened to overspread Italy and Gaul, and on the other the ancient idolatry of [[Saxony]] and [[Friesland]] once more forced its way across the Rhine. In this peril of Christian institutions, a youthful prince of Germanic race, Karl Martell, arose as their champion, maintained them with all the energy which the necessity for self-defence calls forth, and finally extended them into new regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Creasy 2001, p. 158&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The German military historian [[Hans Delbrück]] said of this battle &quot;there was no more important battle in the history of the world.&quot; (''The Barbarian Invasions'', p.&amp;nbsp;441.) Had Charles Martel failed, [[Henry Hallam]] argued, there would have been no [[Charlemagne]], no [[Holy Roman Empire]] or [[Papal States]]; all these depended upon Charles's containment of Islam from expanding into Europe while the Caliphate was unified and able to mount such a conquest. Another great mid era historian, [[Thomas Arnold]], ranked the victory of Charles Martel even higher than the victory of [[Arminius]] in its impact on all of modern history: &quot;Charles Martel's victory at Tours was among those signal deliverances which have affected for centuries the happiness of mankind.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''History of the later Roman Commonwealth'', vol ii. p. 317, quoted in {{harvnb|Creasy|Speed|2001|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louis Gustave and Charles Strauss said &quot;The victory gained was decisive and final, The torrent of Arab conquest was rolled back and Europe was rescued from the threatened yoke of the Saracens.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gustave, Louis and Strauss, Charles ''Moslem and Frank; or, Charles Martel and the rescue of Europe'' p.&amp;nbsp;122&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Oman concluded that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At Poitiers the Franks fought as they had done two hundred years before at [[Battle of the Volturnus (554)|Casilinum]], in one solid mass, without breaking rank or attempting to maneuver. Their victory was won by the purely defensive tactics of the infantry square; the fanatical Arabs, dashing against them time after time, were shattered to pieces, and at last fled under shelter of night. But there was no pursuit, for Charles had determined not to allow his men to stir a step from the line to chase the broken foe.&lt;ref&gt;Oman, Charles ''History of the Art of War in the Middle Ages'' [I, 58]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

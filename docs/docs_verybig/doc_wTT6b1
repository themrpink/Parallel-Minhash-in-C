Several months later, Sebastian rejoins the show. His right arm is paralyzed. A guilt-ridden Holly professes her love for her former rival over the unfeeling Brad. Angel calls Holly a fool &quot;for busting up the swellest guy in the circus&quot; and makes a pass at Brad. They become an item. Klaus cannot accept that Angel does not want him.

At one stand, Special Agent Gregory of the FBI appears on the lot during teardown and asks Brad whether the circus doctor resembles a man he is hunting. Brad has never seen Buttons without makeup and does not recognize the man in the photo. (The audience does.) The detective boards the train to continue his investigation. When Buttons tells Brad that Sebastian has feeling in his injured hand – a sign that his disability is not permanent — Brad makes the connection and casually observes that the police will be taking [[fingerprint]]s at the next stand. He implies to Buttons he should make himself scarce until Gregory leaves the show to search elsewhere.

Harry and Klaus stop the first of the circus's two trains to steal the day's receipts. Klaus sees the second section coming and realizes that Angel is aboard. He drives the automobile head-on toward the train in an attempt to signal the engineer to stop the train. The second section smashes the car off the tracks and crashes into the first section in a spectacular collision that derails train cars, breaks animal cages open, shreds equipment, and injures people by the score. Brad is pinned in the wreckage, bleeding from a cut artery.

Buttons tries to slip away from the wreck site, but Holly pleads with him to save the man she loves. Buttons gives Brad a direct [[blood transfusion|transfusion]] from Sebastian, who has the same rare blood type. Gregory assists him. Later, Special Agent Gregory reluctantly arrests Buttons, shaking his hand before handcuffing him and telling him, &quot;You're all right.&quot; Buttons tells Brad to tell Holly that he will be keeping a date with his girl, suggesting that he may be facing the death penalty.

Holly takes command of the show, mounting a parade that leads the whole nearby town to an open-air performance. Brad now realizes how much he loves Holly, but ironically she now has no time for him because the show must go on. Sebastian proposes to Angel, and she accepts, tying up the last loose end. The movie ends with the &quot;spec&quot; opening the program, the circus making a magnificent recovery from disaster to continue their tour.

The film features about 85 [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]] acts, including clowns [[Emmett Kelly]] and [[Lou Jacobs]], midget Cucciola, bandmaster [[Merle Evans]], foot juggler [[Miss Loni]], and aerialist Antoinette Concello.&lt;ref name=&quot;variety&quot;&gt;[https://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=Variety100&amp;reviewid=VE1117488052&amp;content=jump&amp;jump=review&amp;category=1935&amp;cs=1 The Greatest Show On Earth], a January 2, 1952 review from ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Ringling North]] plays himself as the owner of the circus.

There are a number of unbilled [[cameo appearance]]s (mostly in the circus audiences) including [[Bob Hope]] and [[Bing Crosby]], [[Dorothy Lamour]]'s co-stars in the ''[[Road to …|Road to&amp;nbsp;...]]'' movies.&lt;ref name=&quot;variety&quot;/&gt; [[William Boyd (actor)|William Boyd]] appears in his usual guise of [[Hopalong Cassidy]]. [[Danny Thomas]], [[Van Heflin]], character actor Oliver Blake, and [[Noel Neill]] are seen as circus patrons, among others. [[Leon Ames (actor)|Leon Ames]] is seen and heard in the train wreck sequence.
A [[barker (occupation)|barker]], kept anonymous until the very end, is seen in the closing moments of the film. The voice is finally revealed to be that of [[Edmond O'Brien]].

==Production==
It has been said [[Lucille Ball]] was offered [[Gloria Grahame]]'s Angel role, but dropped out when she discovered she was pregnant with her first child, [[Lucie Arnaz]]. This seems unlikely, as she was developing what became ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' for CBS at the time. 

Art Concello, a famous aerialist in his day, was the General Manager of Ringling Bros. at the time De Mille was traveling with the show. It was he who gaffed The Great Sebastian's fall for the film, a difficult gag that had been the cause of great concern.

Betty Hutton and Cornel Wilde had to learn how to fly on the trapeze for their scenes. It has been said that Wilde had difficulty with this, because he was afraid of heights. However, Hutton took to the trapeze like a duck to water and became quite proficient with the single bar. There is even film footage of De Mille presenting her with an award from ''[[Photoplay]]'' magazine while she was rehearsing, for which he had to ride a camera crane forty feet into the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube | id=G1EoxPAYKbw | title=Newsreel – Betty Hutton Receives Photoplay Award (1951)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The music for the song, &quot;Lovely Luawana Lady&quot;, was written by [[John Ringling North]], who appears briefly as himself during the discussion about whether the show would play the road rather than have a short 10-week season. North was a nephew of the five Ringling Brothers who founded Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus. At the time the movie was filmed, John Ringling North was the owner of The Greatest Show on Earth.

==Reception==

The film played for a record-equalling 11 weeks at [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York, matching the record set by ''[[Random Harvest (film)|Random Harvest]]'' in 1942, a record that lasted until at least the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Million-$ Gross In 5 Weeks; 'Mink' A Radio City Wow|date=July 18, 1962|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On its release, [[Bosley Crowther]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' called ''The Greatest Show on Earth'' a &quot;lusty triumph of circus showmanship and movie skill&quot; and a &quot;piece of entertainment that will delight movie audiences for years&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C06E2DB153BE23BBC4952DFB7668389649EDE De Mille Puts ''Greatest Show on Earth'' on Film for All to See], a January 11, 1952 review from ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
:Sprawling across a mammoth canvas, crammed with the real-life acts and thrills, as well as the vast backstage minutiae, that make the circus the glamorous thing it is and glittering in marvelous Technicolor—truly marvelous color, we repeat—this huge motion picture of the big-top is the dandiest ever put upon the screen.

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called it a &quot;mammoth merger of two masters of malarkey for the masses: [[P. T. Barnum]] and [[Cecil B. de Mille]]&quot; as well as a film that &quot;fills the screen with pageants and parades [and] finds a spot for 60-odd circus acts&quot; with a plot that &quot;does not quite hold all this pageantry together.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,806239,00.html The New Pictures (January 14, 1952)], a review from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that the film &quot;effectively serve[s] the purpose of a framework for all the atmosphere and excitement of the circus on both sides of the big canvas.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;variety&quot;/&gt;

In 1977, Joe Walders wrote in ''[[TV Guide]]'' that a film's box-office success does not necessarily translate to continued popularity on TV, and cites this film as a primary example. It &quot;was not only the top moneymaker of the year, but it also won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. Yet it has rarely done well on television.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris-263&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=Jay S.

Critic [[Leonard Maltin]] opines that &quot;like most of DeMille's movies, this may not be art, but it's hugely enjoyable&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maltin225&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Maltin|first=Leonard|url=https://archive.org/details/leonardmaltinsfa00malt/page/225|title=Leonard Maltin's Family Film Guide|publisher=Signet|year=1999|isbn=0-451-19714-3|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/leonardmaltinsfa00malt/page/225 225]|author-link=Leonard Maltin|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, ''[[The Official Razzie Movie Guide: Enjoying the Best of Hollywood's Worst]]'' includes ''The Greatest Show on Earth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wilson, John|year=2005|title=The Official Razzie Movie Guide: Enjoying the Best of Hollywoods Worst|location=New York|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|isbn=978-0-446-69334-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some reviewers consider ''The Greatest Show on Earth'' among the worst choices the Academy ever made for Best Picture. In 2005, ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' listed it as the third worst Best Picture winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/Mel_Gibsons_Braveheart_Voted_Worst_Oscar_Winner/2435436|title=Mel Gibson's &quot;Braveheart&quot; Voted Worst Oscar Winner|last=WENN|date=February 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, in an article for [[MSNBC]] about the [[78th Academy Awards]] selection of ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' as Best Picture, [[Erik Lundegaard]] called ''Crash'' the &quot;worst Best Picture winner since the 'dull, bloated' film ''The Greatest Show on Earth''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.today.com/popculture/oscar-misfire-crash-burn-wbna11700333 Oscar misfire: ''Crash'' and burn] from a March 2006 [[MSNBC]] article&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the fact that ''The Greatest Show on Earth'' won over ''[[High Noon]]'' was listed by ''Time'' among the 10 Most Controversial Best Picture Races.&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.time.com/2013/02/20/oscar-robbery-10-controversial-best-picture-races/slide/1953-high-noon-vs-the-greatest-show-on-earth/ Oscar Robbery: 10 Controversial Best-Picture Races]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
[[Image:TheGreatestShowonEarthshot.jpg|right|thumb|238px|James Stewart and Charlton Heston help an injured Cornel Wilde leave the center ring with dignity.]]

At the [[25th Academy Awards]], the movie won Oscars for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Story|Best Story]]. It received nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design, Color]]. It was the last Best Picture winner to win fewer than three Academy Awards until ''[[Spotlight (film)|Spotlight]]'' (2015).

Many consider this film among the worst to have ever won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. It also won that award over highly rated films such as ''[[High Noon]]'', ''[[The Quiet Man]]'', ''[[Ivanhoe (film)|Ivanhoe]]'' and the non-nominated ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]''. The American film magazine ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'' placed the movie on its list of the 10 worst Oscar winners&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/news/wenn/2006-03-01/|title=Movie &amp; TV News @ IMDb.com – WENN – 1 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the British film magazine ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' rated it #3 on their list of the 10 worst Oscar winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.rediff.com/movies/2005/mar/01worst.htm|title=The worst Oscar winners!}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has the second lowest spot on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]' list of the 90 films to win Best Picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/guides/best_of_the_best_pictures_2011/|title=Rotten Tomatoes List|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504111026/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/guides/best_of_the_best_pictures_2011/|archive-date=May 4, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanley Kramer]] alleged that the film's Best Picture Oscar was due to the political climate in Hollywood in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/24083/High-Noon/articles.html | title=Why ''High Noon'' Is Essential | first1=Scott | last1=McGee | first2=Jeff | last2=Stafford | publisher=Turner Classic Movies | accessdate=February 12, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] was pursuing [[Communism|Communists]] at the time, and DeMille was a conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] involved with the [[National Committee for a Free Europe]]. Another Best Picture nominee, ''High Noon'', was produced by [[Carl Foreman]], who would soon be on the [[Hollywood blacklist]], and one of the scriptwriters of ''Ivanhoe'', [[Marguerite Roberts]], was also blacklisted.

Another likely reason ''The Greatest Show on Earth'' was voted Best Picture of 1952 was that it was seen as a &quot;last chance&quot; vote for Cecil B. DeMille, to honor him for a lifetime of filmmaking dating back to the [[Silent film|silent movie]] era. DeMille's best work was done before the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS) was created. It may be that the members of the Academy (which included many veterans of the silent era) felt that as an elder statesman of Hollywood and founding member of the Academy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oscars.org/academy/history-organization/history.html | title=History of the Academy | publisher=The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences | accessdate=February 11, 2020 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605133157/http://www.oscars.org/academy/history-organization/history.html | archive-date=June 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; he deserved the honor even if other films that year were better than ''The Greatest Show on Earth''. Many people today would agree that ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'', DeMille's next (and last) film, which he produced and directed, was more deserving of the 1956 Best Picture Oscar than ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' and more deserving of an honor to DeMille's magnificent and legendary career and his contributions to the growth and evolution of cinema than ''The Greatest Show on Earth''.

==Influence==
A television series [[The Greatest Show on Earth (TV series)|with the same title]] was inspired by the film, with [[Jack Palance]] in the role of Charlton Heston's character. The program ran on Tuesday evenings for thirty episodes on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] during the 1963–1964 season.

The self-titled theme song later served as the theme for [[WGN-TV]]'s long running ''[[Bozo's Circus]]''.&lt;ref name=Show&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h3nCJAlg5qUC&amp;q=paddy+the+pelican&amp;pg=PA100|title=Hi there, boys and girls!

''The Greatest Show on Earth'' was the first film that director [[Steven Spielberg]] saw and he credits it as one of the major inspirations that led him into a film career.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Steven Spielberg, Mark Kermode, BBC Culture Show, broadcast 2006-11-04&lt;/ref&gt; He pointed out the film's train crash scene as a major influence, and this influence was later reflected in the science fiction film ''[[Super 8 (2011 film)|Super 8]]'' (2011), which he produced.

In Steven Spielberg's version of ''[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]'' (2005), an early scene shows two kids channel-surfing on their television, and the train-wreck scene from ''The Greatest Show on Earth'' is being broadcast.

A '''garden''' is a planned space, usually outdoors, set aside for the display, cultivation, or enjoyment of [[Plant|plants]] and other forms of [[nature]], as an ideal setting for social or solitary human life. The single feature identifying even the wildest [[wild garden]] is ''control''. The garden can incorporate both natural and man-made materials. 

Gardens may exhibit structural enhancements including statuary, [[Folly|follies]], [[pergola]]s, [[Trellis (architecture)|trellises]], [[Stumpery|stumperies]], dry creek beds and [[water feature]]s such as [[fountain]]s, [[Garden pond|ponds]] (with or without [[Koi pond|fish]]), [[Waterfall|waterfalls]] or creeks. Some gardens are for ornamental purposes only, while others also produce food crops, sometimes in separate areas, or sometimes intermixed with the [[ornamental plant]]s. Food-producing gardens are distinguished from [[farm]]s by their smaller scale, more labor-intensive methods, and their purpose (enjoyment of a hobby or self-sustenance rather than producing for sale, as in a  [[market garden]]). [[Flower garden]]s combine plants of different heights, colors, textures, and fragrances to create interest and delight the senses.

[[Gardening]] is the activity of growing and maintaining the garden. This work is done by an amateur or professional [[gardener]]. A gardener might also work in a non-garden setting, such as a park, a roadside embankment, or other public space.

[[Landscape architecture]] is a related professional activity with landscape architects tending to specialise in design at multiple levels.

The most common form today is a residential or public garden, but the term ''garden'' has traditionally been a more general one. [[Zoo|Zoos]], which display [[wildlife|wild animals]] in simulated natural habitats, were formerly called [[zoological gardens]].&lt;ref&gt;''Garden history : philosophy and design, 2000 BC–2000 AD'', Tom Turner. New York: Spon Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-415-31748-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The earth knows my name : food, culture, and sustainability in the gardens of ethnic Americans'', Patricia Klindienst. Boston: Beacon Press, 2006. {{ISBN|0-8070-8562-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western gardens are almost universally based on plants, with ''garden'', which etymologically implies ''enclosure'', often signifying a shortened form of [[botanical garden]]. Some traditional types of eastern gardens, such as [[Japanese rock garden|Zen gardens]], however, use plants sparsely or not at all. Landscape gardens, on the other hand, such as the [[English landscape garden]]s first developed in the 18th century, may omit flowers altogether.



==Background==
The culture of gardening reaches deep into antiquity, when [[Alexander the Great]] was reportedly awestruck by the magnificence of Babylon's gardens. Homer tells of the Garden of [[Alcinous]], its fertility and symmetry of form. 

The Romans were known for planting their gardens with the riches of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Soyer |first=Alexis |title=Food, Cookery, and Dining in Ancient Times |publisher=Dover Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardening was not recognized as an art form in Europe until the mid 16th century when it entered the political discourse, as a symbol of the concept of the &quot;ideal republic&quot;. Evoking utopian imagery of the [[Garden of Eden]], a time of abundance and plenty where humans didn't know hunger or the conflicts that arose from property disputes. [[John Evelyn]] wrote in the early 17th century, &quot;there is not a more laborious life then is that of a good Gard'ners; but a labour full of tranquility and satisfaction; Natural and Instructive, and such as (if any) contributes to Piety and Contemplation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Samson, Alexander. ''Locus Amoenus: Gardens and Horticulture in the Renaissance'', 2012 :6&lt;/ref&gt; During the era of [[Enclosures]], the agrarian collectivism of the [[feudalism|feudal age]] was idealized in literary &quot;fantasies of liberating regression to garden and wildnerness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Samson, Alexander. ''Locus Amoenus: Gardens and Horticulture in the Renaissance'', 2012 :8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The etymology of the word ''gardening'' refers to [[enclosure]]: it is from Middle English ''gardin'', from Anglo-French ''gardin'', ''jardin'', of Germanic origin; akin to Old High German ''gard'', ''gart'', an enclosure or compound, as in [[Stuttgart]]. See [[Grad (Slavic settlement)]] for more complete etymology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/garden |title=Etymology of the modern word gardin |dictionary=[[Merriam Webster]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The words ''yard'', ''court'', and Latin ''hortus'' (meaning &quot;garden,&quot; hence horticulture and orchard), are cognates—all referring to an enclosed space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/library/garden.html |title=Etymology of words referring to enclosures, probably from a Sanskrit stem. In German, for example, Stutt'''gart'''. The word is generic for compounds and walled cities, as in Stalin'''grad''', and the Russian word for city, ''gorod''. Gird and girdle are also related |publisher=Yourdictionary.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213101107/http://www.yourdictionary.com/library/garden.html |archive-date=2010-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;garden&quot; in [[British English]] refers to a small enclosed area of land, usually adjoining a building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/garden?view=uk|title=Oxford Dictionaries |website=Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be referred to as a [[yard (land)|yard]] in [[American English]].

==Design Elements==
[[File:Garden in NPM.JPG|thumb|Naturalistic design of a [[Chinese garden]] incorporated into the landscape, including a pavilion]]
{{Main|Garden design}}
Garden design is the process of creating plans for the layout and planting of gardens and landscapes. Gardens may be designed by garden owners themselves, or by professionals. Professional garden designers tend to be trained in principles of design and horticulture, and have a knowledge and experience of using plants. Some professional garden designers are also [[landscape architect]]s, a more formal level of training that usually requires an advanced degree and often a state license.

Elements of garden design include the layout of hard landscape, such as paths, rockeries, walls, water features, sitting areas and decking, as well as the plants themselves, with consideration for their [[horticultural]] requirements, their season-to-season appearance, lifespan, [[Habit (biology)|growth habit]], size, speed of growth, and combinations with other plants and landscape features. Most gardens consist of a mix of natural and constructed elements, although even very 'natural' gardens are always an inherently artificial creation. Natural elements present in a garden principally comprise flora (such as trees and [[weed]]s), fauna (such as [[arthropod]]s and birds), soil, water, air and light. Constructed elements include paths, [[patio]]s, decking, sculptures, [[drainage]] systems, lights and buildings (such as [[shed]]s, [[gazebo]]s, [[pergola]]s and [[Folly|follies]]), but also living constructions such as [[Herbaceous border|flower beds]], [[Garden pond|ponds]] and [[lawn]]s.

 Consideration is also given to the maintenance needs of the garden.  Including the time or funds available for regular maintenance,  (this can affect the choices of plants regarding speed of growth) spreading or self-seeding of the plants(annual or perennial), bloom-time, and many other characteristics. Garden design can be roughly divided into two groups, formal and naturalistic gardens. The most important consideration in any garden design is how the garden will be used, followed closely by the desired stylistic genres, and the way the garden space will connect to the home or other structures in the surrounding areas. All of these considerations are subject to the limitations of the budget. Budget limitations can be addressed by a simpler garden style with fewer plants and less costly hard landscape materials, seeds rather than sod for lawns, and plants that grow quickly; alternatively, garden owners may choose to create their garden over time, area by area.

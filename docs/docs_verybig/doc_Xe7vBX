Formally, a metric space is an [[ordered pair]] &lt;math&gt;(M,d)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a set and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., a [[Function (mathematics)|function]]

:&lt;math&gt;d \colon M \times M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

such that for any &lt;math&gt;x, y, z \in M&lt;/math&gt;, the following holds:

# &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = 0&lt;/math&gt; [[if and only if]] &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (''[[identity of indiscernibles]]''),
# &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = d(y,x)&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (''symmetry''), and
# &lt;math&gt;d(x,z) \le d(x,y) + d(y,z)&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (''[[triangle inequality]]'').

By taking the third property and letting &lt;math&gt;z=x&lt;/math&gt;, it can be shown that &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (''non-negative'').

=== Sequences and limits ===
{{Main|Sequence}}
A '''sequence''' is an ordered list. Like a [[Set (mathematics)|set]], it contains [[Element (mathematics)|members]] (also called ''elements'', or ''terms''). Unlike a set, order matters, and exactly the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in the sequence. Most precisely, a sequence can be defined as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] whose domain is a [[countable]] [[totally ordered]] set, such as the [[natural numbers]].

One of the most important properties of a sequence is ''convergence''. Informally, a sequence converges if it has a ''limit''. Continuing informally, a ([[#Finite and infinite|singly-infinite]]) sequence has a limit if it approaches some point ''x'', called the limit, as ''n'' becomes very large. That is, for an abstract sequence (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) (with ''n'' running from 1 to infinity understood) the distance between ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x'' approaches 0 as ''n'' → ∞, denoted
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n = x.&lt;/math&gt;

== Main branches ==
=== Real analysis ===
{{Main|Real analysis}}
'''Real analysis''' (traditionally, the '''theory of functions of a real variable''') is a branch of mathematical analysis dealing with the [[real number]]s and real-valued functions of a real variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rudin |first=Walter |authorlink=Walter Rudin |title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis |url=https://archive.org/details/principlesofmath00rudi |url-access=registration |series=Walter Rudin Student Series in Advanced Mathematics |edition=3rd |publisher=McGraw–Hill |isbn=978-0-07-054235-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbott |first=Stephen |title=Understanding Analysis |series=Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics |isbn=978-0-387-95060-0 |year=2001 |location=New York |publisher=Springer-Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it deals with the analytic properties of real [[function (mathematics)|functions]] and [[sequence]]s, including [[Limit of a sequence|convergence]] and [[limit of a function|limits]] of [[sequence]]s of real numbers, the [[calculus]] of the real numbers, and [[continuous function|continuity]], [[smooth function|smoothness]] and related properties of real-valued functions.

=== Complex analysis ===
{{Main|Complex analysis}}

'''Complex analysis''', traditionally known as the '''theory of functions of a complex variable''', is the branch of mathematical analysis that investigates [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] of [[complex numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ahlfors |first=L. |authorlink=Lars Ahlfors |title=Complex Analysis |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |edition=3rd |year=1979 |isbn=978-0-07-000657-7 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2MRuus-5GGoC }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is useful in many branches of mathematics, including [[algebraic geometry]], [[number theory]], [[applied mathematics]]; as well as in [[physics]], including [[hydrodynamics]], [[thermodynamics]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], and particularly, [[quantum field theory]].

Complex analysis is particularly concerned with the [[analytic function]]s of complex variables (or, more generally, [[meromorphic function]]s). Because the separate [[real number|real]] and [[imaginary number|imaginary]] parts of any analytic function must satisfy [[Laplace's equation]], complex analysis is widely applicable to two-dimensional problems in [[physics]].

=== Functional analysis ===
{{Main|Functional analysis}}
'''Functional analysis''' is a branch of mathematical analysis, the core of which is formed by the study of [[vector space]]s endowed with some kind of limit-related structure (e.g. [[Inner product space#Definition|inner product]], [[Norm (mathematics)#Definition|norm]], [[Topological space#Definition|topology]], etc.) and the [[linear transformation|linear operators]] acting upon these spaces and respecting these structures in a suitable sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rudin |first=Walter |authorlink=Walter Rudin |title=Functional Analysis |location= |publisher = McGraw-Hill Science |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-07-054236-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/functionalanalys0000rudi |url-access=registration }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Conway |first=J. B. |authorlink=John B. Conway |title=A Course in Functional Analysis |edition=2nd |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-387-97245-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ix4P1e6AkeIC }}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical roots of functional analysis lie in the study of [[function space|spaces of functions]] and the formulation of properties of transformations of functions such as the [[Fourier transform]] as transformations defining [[continuous function|continuous]], [[unitary operator|unitary]] etc. operators between function spaces.  This point of view turned out to be particularly useful for the study of [[differential equations|differential]] and [[integral equations]].

=== Differential equations ===
{{Main|Differential equations}}
A '''differential equation''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[equation]] for an unknown [[function (mathematics)|function]] of one or several [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] that relates the values of the function itself and its [[derivative]]s of various [[Derivative#Higher derivatives|orders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Edward L.|last =  Ince|title =Ordinary Differential Equations|publisher =  Dover Publications|year = 1956|isbn=978-0-486-60349-0|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mbyqAAAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Witold Hurewicz]], ''Lectures on Ordinary Differential Equations'', Dover Publications, {{isbn|0-486-49510-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |authorlink=Lawrence C. Evans |first=L.C. |last=Evans |title=Partial Differential Equations |publisher=American Mathematical Society |location=Providence |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-8218-0772-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Differential equations play a prominent role in [[engineering]], [[physics]], [[economics]], [[biology]], and other disciplines.

Differential equations arise in many areas of science and technology, specifically whenever a [[Deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]] relation involving some continuously varying quantities (modeled by functions) and their rates of change in space or time (expressed as derivatives) is known or postulated. This is illustrated in [[classical mechanics]], where the motion of a body is described by its position and velocity as the time value varies. [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's laws]] allow one (given the position, velocity, acceleration and various forces acting on the body) to express these variables dynamically as a differential equation for the unknown position of the body as a function of time. In some cases, this differential equation (called an [[equations of motion|equation of motion]]) may be solved explicitly.

=== Measure theory ===
{{Main|Measure (mathematics)}}

A '''measure''' on a [[set (mathematics)|set]] is a systematic way to assign a number to each suitable [[subset]] of that set, intuitively interpreted as its size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink = Terence Tao|first = Terence|last = Tao|date = 2011|title =An Introduction to Measure Theory|publisher = American Mathematical Society|isbn = 978-0-8218-6919-2|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HoGDAwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, a measure is a generalization of the concepts of length, area, and volume. A particularly important example is the [[Lebesgue measure]] on a [[Euclidean space]], which assigns the conventional [[length]], [[area]], and [[volume]] of [[Euclidean geometry]] to suitable subsets of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional Euclidean space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, the Lebesgue measure of the [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] &lt;math&gt;\left[0, 1\right]&lt;/math&gt; in the [[real line|real numbers]] is its length in the everyday sense of the word – specifically, 1.

Technically, a measure is a function that assigns a non-negative real number or [[Extended real number line|+∞]] to (certain) subsets of a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. It must assign 0 to the [[empty set]] and be ([[countably]]) additive: the measure of a 'large' subset that can be decomposed into a finite (or countable) number of 'smaller' disjoint subsets, is the sum of the measures of the &quot;smaller&quot; subsets. In general, if one wants to associate a ''consistent'' size to ''each'' subset of a given set while satisfying the other axioms of a measure, one only finds trivial examples like the [[counting measure]]. This problem was resolved by defining measure only on a sub-collection of all subsets; the so-called ''measurable'' subsets, which are required to form a [[Sigma-algebra|&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebra]]. This means that countable [[union (set theory)|unions]], countable [[intersection (set theory)|intersections]] and [[complement (set theory)|complements]] of measurable subsets are measurable. [[Non-measurable set]]s in a Euclidean space, on which the Lebesgue measure cannot be defined consistently, are necessarily complicated in the sense of being badly mixed up with their complement. Indeed, their existence is a non-trivial consequence of the [[axiom of choice]].

=== Numerical analysis ===
{{Main|Numerical analysis}}
'''Numerical analysis''' is the study of [[algorithm]]s that use numerical [[approximation]] (as opposed to general [[symbolic computation|symbolic manipulations]]) for the problems of mathematical analysis (as distinguished from [[discrete mathematics]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hildebrand |first=F.B. | authorlink=Francis B. Hildebrand | title=Introduction to Numerical Analysis | edition=2nd |year=1974 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location= |isbn= 978-0-07-028761-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern numerical analysis does not seek exact answers, because exact answers are often impossible to obtain in practice. Instead, much of numerical analysis is concerned with obtaining approximate solutions while maintaining reasonable bounds on errors.

Numerical analysis naturally finds applications in all fields of engineering and the physical sciences, but in the 21st&amp;nbsp;century, the life sciences and even the arts have adopted elements of scientific computations. [[Ordinary differential equation]]s appear in [[celestial mechanics]] (planets, stars and galaxies); [[numerical linear algebra]] is important for data analysis; [[stochastic differential equation]]s and [[Markov chain]]s are essential in simulating living cells for medicine and biology.

== Applications ==
Techniques from analysis are also found in other areas such as:

=== Physical sciences ===
The vast majority of [[classical mechanics]], [[Theory of relativity|relativity]], and [[quantum mechanics]] is based on applied analysis, and [[differential equation]]s in particular. Examples of important differential equations include [[Newton's second law]], the [[Schrödinger equation]], and the [[Einstein field equations]].

[[Functional analysis]] is also a major factor in [[quantum mechanics]].

=== Signal processing ===
When processing signals, such as [[Sound|audio]], [[radio wave]]s, light waves, [[seismic waves]], and even images, Fourier analysis can isolate individual components of a compound waveform, concentrating them for easier detection or removal.  A large family of signal processing techniques consist of Fourier-transforming a signal, manipulating the Fourier-transformed data in a simple way, and reversing the transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory and Application of Digital Signal Processing |last1=Rabiner |first1=L.R. |last2=Gold |first2=B. |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |publisher=Prentice-Hall |year=1975 |isbn=978-0-13-914101-0 |pages= |url=https://archive.org/details/theoryapplicatio00rabi |url-access=registration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Isocyanate group.svg|thumb|The isocyanate functional group]]

'''Isocyanate''' is the [[functional group]] with the formula R−N=C=O. [[Organic compound]]s that contain an isocyanate group are referred to as isocyanates.  An organic compound with two isocyanate groups is known as a diisocyanate. Diisocyanates are manufactured for the production of [[polyurethanes]], a class of [[polymers]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

Isocyanates should not be confused with [[cyanate ester]]s and [[isocyanide]]s, very different families of compounds.  The [[cyanate]] (cyanate ester) functional group (R−O−C≡N) is arranged differently from the isocyanate group (R−N=C=O). [[Isocyanide]]s have the connectivity R−N≡C, lacking the oxygen of the cyanate groups.

==Structure and bonding==
In terms of bonding, isocyanates are closely related to carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[carbodiimide]]s (C(NR)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  The C−N=C=O unit that defines isocyanates is planar, and the N=C=O linkage is nearly linear.  In [[phenyl isocyanate]], the C=N and C=O distances are respectively 1.195 and 1.173&amp;nbsp;[[angstrom|Å]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Porphyrin Sponges: Conservative of Host Structure in over 200 Porphyrin-Based Lattice Clathrates |authors=Marianne P. Byrn, Carol J. Curtis, Yu Hsiou, Saeed I. Khan, Philip A. Sawin, S. Kathleen Tendick, Aris Terzis, Charles E. Strouse |journal=J. Am. Chem. Soc. |year=1993 |volume= 115 |issue=21 |pages=9480–9497 |doi=10.1021/ja00074a013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
Isocyanates are produced from [[amines]] by phosgenation, i.e. treating with [[phosgene]]:
:RNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  COCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →   RNCO  +  2 HCl
These reactions proceed via the intermediacy of a [[carbamoyl chloride]] (RNHC(O)Cl).  Owing to the hazardous nature of phosgene, the production of isocyanates requires special precautions.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

== Reactivity ==
=== With nucleophiles ===
Isocyanates are [[electrophiles]], and as such they are reactive toward a variety of [[nucleophiles]] including [[alcohols]], [[amines]], and even water having a higher reactivity compared to structurally analogous [[isothiocyanates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Zhen|last2=Mayer|first2=Robert J.|last3=Ofial|first3=Armin R.| last4=Mayr|first4=Herbert|date=2020-04-27|title= From Carbodiimides to Carbon Dioxide: Quantification of the Electrophilic Reactivities of Heteroallenes|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|doi=10.1021/jacs.0c01960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon treatment with an alcohol, an isocyanate forms a [[carbamate|urethane]] linkage:
: ROH + R'NCO → ROC(O)N(H)R' (R and R' are [[alkyl]] or [[aryl]] groups)
If a diisocyanate is treated with a compound containing two or more hydroxyl groups, such as a [[diol]] or a [[polyol]], polymer chains are formed, which are known as [[polyurethane]]s.

[[File:Polyurethane synthesis.tif|thumb|center|700px|Synthesis of polyurethane from a diisocyanate and a diol]]

Isocyanates react with water to form [[carbon dioxide]]:
: RNCO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → RNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
This reaction is exploited in tandem with the production of polyurethane to give polyurethane foams.  The carbon dioxide functions as a [[blowing agent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fundamentals to Polymer Science, An Introductory Text |pages= 39 |authors= Paul Painter and Michael Coleman |edition= Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Isocyanates also react with amines to give [[urea]]s:
: R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH + R'NCO → R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NC(O)N(H)R'
The addition of an isocyanate to a urea gives a [[biuret]]:
: R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NC(O)N(H)R' + R&quot;NCO → R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NC(O)NR'C(O)NHR&quot;
Reaction between a di-isocyanate and a compound containing two or more amine groups produces long polymer chains known as [[polyurea]]s.

=== Cyclization ===
Isocyanates also can react with themselves. [[Aliphatic compound|Aliphatic]] diisocyanates can form [[trimer (chemistry)|trimers]], which are structurally related to [[cyanuric acid]].  Isocyanates participate in [[Diels–Alder reaction]]s, functioning as [[dienophile]]s.

=== Rearrangement reactions ===
Isocyanates are common intermediates in the synthesis of primary amines via [[hydrolysis]]:

=== Common applications ===
MDI is commonly used in the manufacture of rigid foams and surface coating.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{cite book |authors=Christian Six, Frank Richter |title=Isocyanates, Organic |journal=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |year=2005 |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |doi=10.1002/14356007.a14_611 |isbn=978-3527306732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polyurethane foam boards are used in construction for insulation. TDI is commonly used in applications where flexible foams are used, such as furniture and bedding. Both MDI and TDI are used in the making of adhesives and sealants due to weather-resistant properties. Isocyanates, both MDI and TDI are widely used in as spraying applications of insulation due to the speed and flexibility of applications. Foams can be sprayed into structures and harden in place or retain some flexibility as required by the application.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/chemicals-and-production-spray-polyurethane-foam-why-it-matters |title=Chemicals and Production of Spray Polyurethane Foam – Why It Matters |last=US EPA |first=OCSPP |date=2015-08-14 |website=US EPA |language=en |access-date=2018-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; HDI is commonly utilized in high-performance surface-coating applications, including automotive paints.

== Health and safety ==
The risks of isocyanates was brought to the world's attention with the [[Bhopal disaster]], which caused the death of nearly 4000 people. The release of [[methyl isocyanate]] (MIC) was the cause of this disaster.

[[LD50]]s for isocyanates are typically several hundred milligrams per kilogram.&lt;ref&gt;Allport D. C., Gilbert, D. S. and Outterside S. M. (eds) (2003).

Chichester, Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this low acute toxicity, an extremely low [[Occupational exposure limit|short-term exposure limit (STEL)]] of 0.07&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is the legal limit for all isocyanates (except methyl isocyanate: 0.02&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hse.gov.uk/pUbns/priced/eh40.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These limits are set to protect workers from chronic health effects such as [[occupational asthma]], [[contact dermatitis]], or irritation of the respiratory tract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/construction/healthrisks/hazardous-substances/isocyanates.htm |title=Isocyanates – Controlling hazardous substances – Managing occupational health risks in construction |website=www.hse.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since they are used in spraying applications, the properties of their aerosols have attracted attention.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/isocyanates/default.html |title=CDC – Isocyanates – NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic |date=2018-11-09 |website=www.cdc.gov |language=en-us |access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.grainger.com/content/qt-233-isocyanate |title=Isocyanate Exposure, Reaction and Protection – Quick Tips #233 – Grainger Industrial Supply |website=www.grainger.com |access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., OSHA conducted a National Emphasis Program on isocyanates starting in 2013 to make employers and workers more aware of the health risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/trade/06252013 |title=OSHA announces new National Emphasis Program for occupational exposure to isocyanates |publisher=Occupational Safety and Health Administration |website=www.osha.gov |language=en |access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Polyurethanes have variable [[curing (chemistry)|curing]] times, and the presence of free isocyanates in foams vary accordingly.&lt;ref name=&quot;CPWR&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.cpwr.com/sites/default/files/publications/Yale%20CPWR%20Small%20Study%20Final%20Report%206-21-2010.pdf |author= Riedlich, C. |title=Risk of isocyanate exposure in the construction industry |journal=CPWR – the Center for Construction Research and Training |pages=1–8 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the US [[National Toxicology Program]] (NTP) and [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) have evaluated TDI as a potential human carcinogen and Group 2B &quot;possibly carcinogenic to humans&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://msds.orica.com/pdf/shess-en-cds-010-000030115101.pdf |title=Safety Data Sheet – TOLUENE DIISOCYANATE (TDI) |author=IXOM |access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://polyurethane.americanchemistry.com/Resources-and-Document-Library/Health-Effects-of-Diisocyanates-Guidance-for-Medical-Personnel.pdf |title=Health Effects of Diisocyanates: Guidance for Medical Personnel |publisher=American Chemistry Council |access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; MDI appears to be relatively safer and is unlikely a human carcinogen.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt; The IARC evaluates MDI as Group 3 &quot;not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity in humans&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://everchem.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Everchem-MDI-CD-Modified-SDS.pdf |title=SAFETY DATA SHEET |publisher=Everchem |access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

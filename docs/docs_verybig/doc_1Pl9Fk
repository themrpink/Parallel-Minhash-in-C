Steinbeck was known to have borrowed from field notes taken during 1938 by [[Farm Security Administration]] worker and author [[Sanora Babb]]. While Babb collected personal stories about the lives of the displaced migrants for a novel she was developing, her supervisor, Tom Collins, shared her reports with Steinbeck, who at the time was working for the ''San Francisco News''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/dustbowl/bios/sanora-babb/ Sanora Babb (Ken Burns)]&lt;/ref&gt; Babb's own novel, ''Whose Names Are Unknown'', was eclipsed in 1939 by the success of ''The Grapes of Wrath'' and was shelved until it was finally published in 2004, a year before Babb's death.

&lt;!-- 2012-01-29: &lt;cordyack/&gt;(not previously cited here) is the source for all of this paragraph but SFNews publication dates --&gt;
''The Grapes of Wrath'' developed from ''[[The Harvest Gypsies]]'', a series of seven articles that ran in the ''San Francisco News'',  from October 5 to 12, 1936. The newspaper commissioned that work on migrant workers from the Midwest in California's agriculture industry. (It was later compiled and published separately.&lt;ref&gt;Published by the Simon S. Lubin Society of California as a pamphlet entitled &quot;Their Blood is Strong.&quot; Republished 1988 by Heyday as &quot;The Harvest Gypsies: On the Road to the Grapes of Wrath.&quot; Source: Cordyack.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cordyack/&gt;)

In mid-January 1939, three months before the publication of &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;The Grapes of Wrath&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;, Steinbeck wrote a long letter to his editor at Viking Press, Pascal Covici. He wanted Covici, in particular, to understand this book, to appreciate what he was up to. And so he concluded with a statement that might serve as preface in and of itself: &quot;Throughout I've tried to make the reader participate in the actuality, what he takes from it will be scaled on his own depth and shallowness. There are five layers in this book, a reader will find as many as he can and he won't find more than he has in himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shillinglaw|first=Susan|title=On Reading the Grapes of Wrath|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Title ===
{{refimprove|section|date=April 2017}}
While writing the novel at his home, 16250 Greenwood Lane, in what is now [[Monte Sereno, California]], Steinbeck had unusual difficulty devising a title. ''The Grapes of Wrath,'' suggested by his wife Carol Steinbeck,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DeMott|first=Robert|title=Robert DeMott's Introduction to The Grapes of Wrath|year=1992|publisher=Viking Penguin, a Division of Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-018640-6|page=xviii|url=https://archive.org/details/grapesofwrath00stei_t28}}&lt;/ref&gt; was deemed more suitable than anything by the author. The title is a reference to lyrics from &quot;[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]&quot;, by [[Julia Ward Howe]] (emphasis added):

{{poemquote|Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord:
He is trampling out the vintage where ''the grapes of wrath'' are stored;
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword:
His truth is marching on.}}

These lyrics refer, in turn, to the biblical passage [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 14:19–20, an apocalyptic appeal to divine justice and deliverance from oppression in the [[final judgment]].  This and other biblical passages had inspired a long tradition of imagery of [[Christ in the winepress]], in various media. The passage reads:

{{quote|And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God. And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.}}

The phrase also appears at the end of chapter 25 in Steinbeck's book, which describes the purposeful destruction of food to keep the price high:

{{quote|[A]nd in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath. In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage.}}

The image invoked by the title serves as a crucial symbol in the development of both the plot and the novel's greater thematic concerns: from the terrible winepress of [[Dust Bowl]] oppression will come terrible wrath but also the deliverance of workers through their cooperation. This is suggested but not realized within the novel.

== Author's note  ==
When preparing to write the novel, Steinbeck wrote: &quot;I want to put a tag of shame on the greedy bastards who are responsible for this [the Great Depression and its effects].&quot; He famously said, &quot;I've done my damnedest to rip a reader's nerves to rags.&quot; His work won a large following among the working class, due to his sympathy for the migrants and workers' movement, and his accessible prose style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/8555 |title = The long retreat of John Steinbeck|date = September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==
Steinbeck scholar John Timmerman sums up the book's influence: &quot;''The Grapes of Wrath'' may well be the most thoroughly discussed novel – in criticism, reviews, and college classrooms – of 20th century American literature.&quot;&lt;ref name=cordyack/&gt; ''The Grapes of Wrath'' is referred to as a [[Great American Novel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Dana | first = Gioia | title = The Grapes of Wrath Radio Show – Transcript | work = The Big Read | publisher = The National Endowment for the Arts | url = http://www.neabigread.org/books/grapesofwrath/audiotranscript.php | access-date = 2010-09-22}} Writer [[Richard Rodriguez]] discussed ''The Grapes of Wrath'' as The Great American Novel: &quot;There hasn't been anything like this novel since it was written. And this is the great American novel that everyone keeps waiting for but it has been written now.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of publication, Steinbeck's novel &quot;was a phenomenon on the scale of a national event. It was publicly banned and burned by citizens, it was debated on national radio; but above all, it was read.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Peter|last=Lisca|title=The Wide World of John Steinbeck|location=Brunswick, NJ|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]],'' it was the best-selling book of 1939 and 430,000 copies had been printed by February 1940.&lt;ref name=nyt1940/&gt; In that same month, it won the [[List of National Book Award winners#1935 to 1941|National Book Award]], favorite fiction book of 1939, voted by members of the [[American Booksellers Association]].&lt;ref name=nyt1940&gt;&quot;1939 Book Awards Given by Critics: Elgin Groseclose's 'Ararat' is Picked as Work Which Failed to Get Due Recognition&quot;, ''The New York Times'', February 14, 1940, page 25. ProQuest Historical Newspapers The New York Times (1851–2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, it won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]], and its [[Armed Services Edition]] went through two printings.&lt;ref name=pulitzer&gt;[http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-category/261 &quot;Novel&quot;] The Pulitzer Prizes. Retrieved 8 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was noted for Steinbeck's passionate depiction of the plight of the poor, and many of his contemporaries attacked his social and political views. Bryan Cordyack wrote: &quot;Steinbeck was attacked as a propagandist and a [[Socialism|socialist]] from both the left and the right of the political spectrum. The most fervent of these attacks came from the Associated Farmers of California; they were displeased with the book's depiction of California farmers' attitudes and conduct toward the migrants. They denounced the book as a 'pack of lies' and labeled it 'communist propaganda'&quot;.&lt;ref name=cordyack&gt;{{cite web| last = Cordyack| first = Brian| title = 20th-Century American Bestsellers: John Steinbeck, The Grapes of Wrath| publisher = Graduate School of Library and Information Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign| url = http://unsworth.unet.brandeis.edu/courses/bestsellers/?title=the+grapes+of+wrath| access-date =February 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some{{who?|date=January 2019}} argued that his novel was filled with inaccuracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 373284|title = The Bible and the Grapes of Wrath|journal = College English|volume = 24|issue = 3|pages = 193–199|last1 = Crockett|first1 = H.

In 1962, the [[Nobel Prize]] committee cited ''The Grapes of Wrath'' as a &quot;great work&quot; and as one of the committee's main reasons for granting Steinbeck the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]].&lt;ref name=nobel&gt;{{cite web| last = Osterling| first = Anders| title = Nobel Prize in Literature 1962 – Presentation Speech| url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1962/press.html| access-date =February 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine included the novel in its &quot;TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/ | work=Time | title=All Time 100 Novels | access-date=May 25, 2010 | date=October 16, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' of the United Kingdom included the novel in its &quot;100 novels everyone should read&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/4248401/100-novels-everyone-should-read.html | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | title=100 novels everyone should read | access-date=June 5, 2012 | date=January 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999, French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' of Paris ranked ''The Grapes of Wrath'' as seventh on its list of the [[Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century|100 best books of the 20th century]].

Retrieved January 12, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Why not put these in chronological order?--&gt;

== Similarities to ''Whose Names Are Unknown'' ==

Following the publication of [[Sanora Babb]]'s ''[[Whose Names Are Unknown]]'' in 2004, some scholars noted strong parallels between that work—the notes for which Steinbeck is widely believed to have examined&lt;ref name=KenBurns&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dust Bowl – Sanora Babb biography|url=https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/dustbowl/bios/sanora-babb/|publisher=PBS|access-date=21 November 2012|quote=Unbeknownst to Babb, Collins was sharing her reports with writer John Steinbeck. Some of this reporting informed Steinbeck's 1936 series of articles [[The Harvest Gypsies]]. By the time she was ready to publish her work, in the winter of 1939, Steinbeck had come out with his own Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, ''The Grapes of Wrath''. Steinbeck's book was dedicated to Tom Collins and was an immediate best-seller—such a hit, New York editors told Babb, that the market could not bear another on the same subject.}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and ''The Grapes of Wrath.'' 

Writing in ''The Steinbeck Review,'' Michael J. Meyer noted numerous &quot;obvious similarities&quot; between the two novels &quot;that even a cursory reading will reveal,&quot; such as Babb's account of two still-born babies, mirrored in Steinbeck's description of Rose of Sharon's baby. Among other scenes and themes repeated in both books: the villainy of banks, corporations, and company stores that charge exorbitant prices; the rejection of religion and the embrace of music as a means of preserving hope; descriptions of the fecundity of nature and agriculture, and the contrast with the impoverishment of the migrants; and the disparity between those willing to extend assistance to the migrants and others who view &quot;Okies&quot; as subhuman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 41582897|title = Reviewed Work: Whose Names Are Unknown by Sanora Babb|journal = The Steinbeck Review|volume = 4|issue = 1|pages = 135–139|last1 = Meyer|first1 = Michael J.|year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer, a Steinbeck bibliographer, stops short of labeling these parallels as plagiarism but concludes that &quot;Steinbeck scholars would do well to read Babb—if only to see for themselves the echoes of ''Grapes'' that abound in her prose.&quot;

Steinbeck scholar David M. Wrobel wrote that &quot;the John Steinbeck-Sanora Babb story sounds like a classic smash-and-grab: celebrated California author steals the material of unknown Oklahoma writer, resulting in his financial success and her failure to get her work published. ... Steinbeck absorbed field information from many sources, primarily Tom Collins and Eric H. Thomsen, regional director of the federal migrant camp program in California, who accompanied Steinbeck on missions of mercy. ... If Steinbeck read Babb’s extensive notes as carefully as he did the reports of Collins, he would certainly have found them useful. His interaction with Collins and Thomsen—and their influence on the writing of ''The Grapes of Wrath''—is documented because Steinbeck acknowledged both. Sanora Babb went unmentioned.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grapes of Wrath Views from the University of Oklahoma: Two Photographers, Two Novels, and Two Migrations|url=https://www.steinbecknow.com/2014/03/21/grapes-of-wrath-university-of-oklahoma/|publisher=Steinbeck Now|access-date=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in Broad Street magazine, Carla Dominguez described Babb as &quot;devastated and bitter&quot; that Random House canceled publication of her own novel after ''The Grapes of Wrath'' was released in 1939. It is clear, she wrote, that &quot;Babb’s retellings, interactions, and reflections were secretly read over and appropriated by Steinbeck. Babb met Steinbeck briefly and by chance at a lunch counter, but she never thought that he had been reading her notes because he did not mention it.&quot; When Babb's novel was finally published in 2004, she declared that she was a better writer than Steinbeck. “His book,” Babb said, “is not as realistic as mine.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Woman Behind &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;|url=http://broadstreetonline.org/2015/02/the-wrath-of-upstaging/|publisher=Broad Street|access-date=19 August 2019|date=February 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==

===In film===
The book was quickly made into a famed 1940 Hollywood [[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|movie of the same name]] directed by [[John Ford]] and starring [[Henry Fonda]] as Tom Joad. The first part of the film version follows the book fairly accurately. However, the second half and the ending, in particular, differ significantly  from the book.&lt;!--In what way--&gt; John Springer, author of ''The Fondas'' (Citadel, 1973), said of [[Henry Fonda]] and his role in ''[[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|The Grapes of Wrath]]'': &quot;The Great American Novel made one of the few enduring Great American Motion Pictures.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Nixon | first = Rob | title = The Grapes of Wrath | work = This Month Spotlight | publisher = Turner Classic Movies | url = http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=182376&amp;mainArticleId=252903 | access-date = 2010-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary ''[[American: The Bill Hicks Story]]'' (2009) revealed that ''The Grapes of Wrath'' was comedian [[Bill Hicks]]' favorite novel. He based his famous [[last words]] on Tom Joad's final speech: &quot;I left in love, in laughter, and in truth, and wherever truth, love and laughter abide, I am there in spirit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, Bill. ''Love All the People (New Edition)''. Hachette UK, 2009, p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese animated series ''[[Bungou Stray Dogs]]'' portrays a character based on Steinbeck whose superpower is named &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;.

===In music===
[[Woody Guthrie]]'s two-part song&amp;mdash;&quot;[[Woody Guthrie discography#1940, RCA Victor Sessions, Dust Bowl Ballads|Tom Joad – Parts 1 &amp; 2]]&quot; – from the album ''[[Dust Bowl Ballads]]'' (1940), explores the protagonist's life after being paroled from prison. It was covered in 1988 by [[Andy Irvine (musician)|Andy Irvine]], who recorded both parts as a single song&amp;mdash;&quot;Tom Joad&quot;&amp;mdash;on [[Patrick Street]]'s second album, ''[[No. 2 Patrick Street]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;PS2SN&quot;&gt;Sleeve notes from ''No. 2 Patrick Street'', Green Linnet SIF 1088, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

The song &quot;Here Comes that Rainbow Again&quot; by [[Kris Kristofferson]] (1981) is based on the scene in the roadside diner where Pa Joad buys a loaf of bread and two candy sticks for Ruthie and Winfield.

The band [[The Mission UK]] included a song titled &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; in their album ''[[Carved in Sand]]'' (1990).

The progressive rock band [[Camel (band)|Camel]] released an album, titled ''[[Dust and Dreams]]'' (1991), inspired by the novel.

American rock singer-songwriter [[Bruce Springsteen]] named his 11th studio album, ''[[The Ghost of Tom Joad]]'' (1995), after the character. The first track on the album is titled &quot;[[The Ghost of Tom Joad (song)|The Ghost of Tom Joad]]&quot;. The song – and to a lesser extent, the other songs on the album – draws comparisons between the [[Dust Bowl]] and modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Symynkywicz, Jeffery B. (2008).

[[Bad Religion]] have a song entitled &quot;Grains of Wrath&quot; on their album ''[[New Maps of Hell (Bad Religion album)|New Maps of Hell]]'' (2007). Bad Religion lead vocalist [[Greg Graffin]] is a fan of Steinbeck's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebrpage.net/theanswer/?article=books Books | The Answer | The Bad Religion Page – Since 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=July 2014}}{{failed verification|date=July 2014}}

The song &quot;Dust Bowl Dance&quot; on [[Mumford &amp; Sons]]' album ''[[Sigh No More (Mumford &amp; Sons album)|Sigh No More]]'' (2009) is based on the novel.

[[Pink Floyd]]'s song &quot;Sorrow&quot;, written by David Gilmour, from the album ''[[A Momentary Lapse of Reason]]'', is thematically derived from/based on the novel.

===In theatre===
The [[Steppenwolf Theatre Company]] produced [[The Grapes of Wrath (play)|a stage version of the book]], adapted by [[Frank Galati]]. [[Gary Sinise]] played Tom Joad for its entire run of 188 performances on Broadway in 1990. One of these performances was filmed and shown on [[PBS]] the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=&quot;American Playhouse&quot; The Grapes of Wrath (TV Episode 1991)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101971/releaseinfo|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the Illegitimate Players theater company in Chicago produced ''Of Grapes and Nuts'', an original, satirical mash-up of ''The Grapes of Wrath'' and Steinbeck's acclaimed novella ''[[Of Mice and Men]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/sending-up-steinbeck/Content?oid=876602 Lawrence Bommer, &quot;Sending Up Steinbeck,&quot; ''Chicago Reader,'' 11/8/1990]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dim lighting helps abstract the Joad family from the reality of Dust Bowl migrants. The film's emotional and aesthetic power comes from its generalized quality attained through this visual style.

The '''United States secretary of agriculture''' is the head of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]. The secretary is former Georgia governor [[Sonny Perdue]]. Perdue took office on April 25, 2017 after being confirmed by the U.S. Senate by an 87–11 vote. The position carries similar responsibilities to those of [[agriculture minister]]s in other governments.

The department includes several organizations.  The 297,000 mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (770,000 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of national forests and grasslands are managed by the [[United States Forest Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=USDA Forest Service - Caring for the land and serving people. |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/ |website=Fs.fed.us|access-date=September 24, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The safety of food produced and sold in the United States is ensured by the [[Food Safety and Inspection Service|United States Food Safety and Inspection Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Home |website=Fs.fed.us |url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/ |access-date=September 24, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Food Stamp Program]] works with the states to provide food to low-income people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FNS Food Stamp Program Home Page |url=http://www.fns.usda.gov/fsp/ |website=Fns.usda.gov|access-date=September 24, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advice for farmers and gardeners is provided by the [[Cooperative extension service|United States Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES) |url=http://www.csrees.usda.gov/  |website=Csrees.usda.gov|access-date=September 24, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

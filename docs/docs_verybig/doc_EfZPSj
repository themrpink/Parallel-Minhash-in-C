'''''{{lang|de|Kapellmeister}}''''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|p|ɛ|l|ˌ|m|aɪ|s|t|ər}}, &lt;small&gt;also&lt;/small&gt; {{IPAc-en|US|k|ɑː|ˈ|-}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite American Heritage Dictionary|Kapellmeister|accessdate=March 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/kapellmeister &quot;kapellmeister&quot;] (US) and {{Cite Oxford Dictionaries|kapellmeister|accessdate=March 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-de|kaˈpɛlˌmaɪstɐ|lang}}) is a [[German language|German]] word designating a person in charge of music-making. The word is a [[compound word|compound]], consisting of the roots ''{{lang|de|Kapelle}}'' (&quot;choir&quot;, &quot;orchestra&quot; or, originally, &quot;chapel&quot;) and ''{{lang|de|Meister}}'' (&quot;master&quot;). Originally used to refer to somebody in charge of music in a chapel, the term has evolved considerably in its meaning in response to changes in the musical profession.

==Historical usage==
In German-speaking countries during the approximate period 1500–1800, the word Kapellmeister often designated the director of music for a monarch or nobleman. For English speakers, it is this sense of the term that is most often encountered, since it appears frequently in biographical writing about composers who worked in German-speaking countries.

A Kapellmeister position was a senior one and involved supervision of other musicians. [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] worked from 1717 to 1723 as Kapellmeister for [[Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen|Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Cöthen]]. [[Joseph Haydn]] worked for many years as Kapellmeister for the [[House of Esterházy|Esterházy]] family, a high-ranking noble family of the Austrian Empire. [[George Frideric Handel]] served as Kapellmeister for George, [[Elector of Hanover]] (who eventually became King [[George I of Great Britain]]).

A Kapellmeister might also be the director of music for a church. Thus, [[Johann Georg Reutter|Georg Reutter]] was the Kapellmeister at [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna]], where his young choristers included both [[Joseph Haydn|Joseph]] and [[Michael Haydn]].

Becoming a Kapellmeister was a mark of success for professional musicians. For instance, Joseph Haydn once remarked that he was glad [[Mathias Haydn|his father]] (a [[wheelwright]]) had lived long enough to see his son become a Kapellmeister.&lt;ref&gt;Griesinger 1810, 16&lt;/ref&gt; The term also implied the possession of considerable musical skill. When the 18th century actor and musician Joachim Daniel Preisler heard the famous soprano [[Aloysia Weber]] ([[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s sister-in-law) perform in her home, he paid her the following compliment in his diary:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The well-known ''Mozardt'' is her brother-in-law, and has taught her so well that she accompanies from a score and plays interludes like a Kapellmeister.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch (1965, 324).  Preisler's assumption that Weber's skills came from Mozart's training is not specifically supported by modern scholarship.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the end of the 18th century, many of the nobility had declined in their economic power relative to the newly prosperous middle class. Eventually, the maintenance of a ''{{lang|de|Kapelle}}'' became too expensive for most nobles, which led to a decline in the number of Kapellmeister positions. A well-known instance occurred in 1790, when Prince [[Anton I, Prince Esterházy|Anton Esterházy]] succeeded his father [[Nikolaus I, Prince Esterházy|Nikolaus]] and dismissed almost all of the latter's extensive musical establishment.&lt;ref&gt;Haydn himself was retained in an essentially honorary role, but was free to pursue independent plans, his journeys to England; for details see [[Anton I, Prince Esterházy]].&lt;/ref&gt; But Prince Anton was hardly alone in doing this; during this same period, &quot;the steady decline in the number of orchestras supported by aristocratic families represented a ... change that affected all composers and their works.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jones (2009:324)&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a difficult time for musicians, who needed to find new ways to support themselves. For instance, [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] (1770–1827) never worked as a Kapellmeister, but was supported by a somewhat unreliable combination of noble patronage, publication, and concert income.

===The case of Mozart===
[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] never was a Kapellmeister in the sense given above. In 1787, he was given a paid position in the court of the Austrian Emperor, as ''{{lang|de|Kammercompositeur}}'' (&quot;chamber composer&quot;), but authority in matters musical at the court was exercised primarily by [[Antonio Salieri]]. In reviews, diaries, and advertising, Mozart was commonly referred to as &quot;{{lang|de|(Herr) Kapellmeister Mozart}}&quot;. It seems that Mozart's prestige, along with the fact that he frequently appeared in public directing other musicians, led to the use of &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; as a term of respect.&lt;ref&gt;For extensive discussion of the use of &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; to describe Mozart, see Deutsch 1965, 306–307.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1791, Mozart applied to become the Kapellmeister at St. Stephen's Cathedral, and was designated by the City Council to take over this job following the death of the then-ailing incumbent, [[Leopold Hofmann]]. This never took place, since Mozart died (December 1791) before Hofmann did (1793).&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch 1965, 393–395&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''{{lang|de|Hofkapellmeister}}'' specified that the Kapellmeister worked at a nobleman's court (''{{lang|de|Hof}}''); a ''{{lang|de|Konzertmeister}}'' held a somewhat less senior position.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Terrell, ed. ''Collins German–English, English–German dictionary.'' 2nd edition, pp.356, 405.&lt;/ref&gt;

Equivalent positions existed in other European countries and were referred to with equivalent names. In Finnish ''kapellimestari'' is still the primary word used of conductors.

==Contemporary usage==
In contemporary German, the term &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; has become less common than ''{{lang|de|Dirigent}}'' (&quot;[[Conductor (music)|conductor]]&quot;). When used today it designates the director or chief conductor of an orchestra or choir. It suggests involvement in orchestra or choir policy (for example, selecting repertoire, concert schedules, and guest conductors) as well as conducting. In military settings it refers to a [[bandmaster]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Terrell, ed. ''Collins German–English, English–German dictionary''. 2nd edition, pp.380.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[music director]] of the [[Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra]] traditionally holds the old-fashioned title ''{{lang|de|Gewandhauskapellmeister}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.gewandhausorchester.de/en/gewandhaus/history/ |title=Gewandhaus — History |accessdate=24 December 2015 |year=2015 |publisher=[[Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.gewandhausorchester.de/en/orchester/history/ |title=Orchester — History |accessdate=24 December 2015 |year=2015 |publisher=[[Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other German opera houses, the term generally refers to a deputy conductor reporting to the ''{{lang|de|Generalmusikdirektor}}'' (&quot;General Music Director&quot;, usually also the chief conductor). An opera company may have several Kapellmeisters, ranked as ''{{lang|de|Erste Kapellmeister}}'' (''First...''), ''{{lang|de|Zweite Kapellmeister}}'' (''Second...''), etc.

The conductor [[Christian Thielemann]] has offered a nuanced account of the &quot;Dirigent&quot;/&quot;Kapellmeister&quot; distinction in contemporary usage. He suggests that &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; has unfairly acquired a sense of routine, or failure to project glamor: &quot;a Kapellmeister now describes a pale, meek figure beating time. A policeman on duty at the podium directing the musical traffic, no more.&quot; In fact, Thielemann, who is fully aware of the historical usage of the term, would himself prefer to be called a &quot;Kapellmeister&quot;:  &quot;it implies such virtues as knowledge of a work, great ability, and dedication to the cause of music&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Thielemann (2016: unpaginated)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;Kapellmeister Tradition&quot; is commonly used to describe these qualities, as exemplified by such historically important conductors as Otto Klemperer, Klemens Krauss, and Erich Kleiber, in the sense that they have &quot;paid their dues&quot; on their way to international fame.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/otmar-suitner-conductor-who-was-the-last-surviving-product-of-germanys-kapellmeister-tradition-1903928.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="11014" xml:space="preserve">In [[probability theory]], the '''Borel–Cantelli [[Lemma_(mathematics)|lemma]]''' is a [[theorem]] about [[sequence]]s of [[event (probability theory)|events]]. In general, it is a result in [[measure theory]].  It is named after [[Émile Borel]] and [[Francesco Paolo Cantelli]], who gave statement to the lemma in the first decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;E. Borel, &quot;Les probabilités dénombrables et leurs applications arithmetiques&quot; ''Rend. Circ. Mat. Palermo'' (2) '''27''' (1909) pp. 247–271.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F.P. Cantelli, &quot;Sulla probabilità come limite della frequenza&quot;, ''Atti Accad. Naz. Lincei'' 26:1 (1917) pp.39–45.&lt;/ref&gt;  A related result, sometimes called the '''second Borel–Cantelli lemma''', is a partial [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the first Borel–Cantelli lemma.  The lemma states that, under certain conditions, an event will have probability of either zero or one. Accordingly, it is the best-known of a class of similar theorems, known as zero-one laws. Other examples include [[Kolmogorov's zero–one law]] and the [[Hewitt–Savage zero–one law]].

==Statement of lemma for probability spaces==

Let ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,... be a sequence of events in some [[probability space]].
The Borel–Cantelli lemma states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Achim |last=Klenke |title=Probability Theory |year=2006 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |isbn=978-1-84800-047-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:If the sum of the probabilities of the event ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is finite

::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \Pr(E_n)&lt;\infty,&lt;/math&gt;

:then the probability that infinitely many of them occur is 0, that is,

::&lt;math&gt;\Pr\left(\limsup_{n\to\infty} E_n\right) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &quot;lim&amp;nbsp;sup&quot; denotes [[set-theoretic limit|limit supremum]] of the sequence of events, and each event is a set of outcomes. That is, lim&amp;nbsp;sup&amp;nbsp;''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the set of outcomes that occur infinitely many times within the infinite sequence of events (''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).  Explicitly,

:&lt;math&gt;\limsup_{n\to\infty} E_n = \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty \bigcup_{k \geq n}^\infty E_k.&lt;/math&gt;

The set lim&amp;nbsp;sup&amp;nbsp;''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is sometimes denoted {''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; i.o. }. The theorem therefore asserts that if the sum of the probabilities of the events ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is finite, then the set of all outcomes that are &quot;repeated&quot; infinitely many times must occur with probability zero. Note that no assumption of [[statistical independence|independence]] is required.

===Example===

Suppose (''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a sequence of [[random variable]]s with Pr(''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0) = 1/''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for each ''n''. The probability that ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 occurs for infinitely many ''n'' is equivalent to the probability of the intersection of infinitely many [''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0] events. The intersection of infinitely many such events is a set of outcomes common to all of them. However, the sum ∑Pr(''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0) converges to {{pi}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/6&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;1.645&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;∞, and so the Borel–Cantelli Lemma states that the set of outcomes that are common to infinitely many such events occurs with probability zero. Hence, the probability of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 occurring for infinitely many ''n'' is&amp;nbsp;0. [[Almost surely]] (i.e., with probability 1), ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is nonzero for all but finitely many&amp;nbsp;''n''.

Let (''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) be a sequence of events in some [[probability space]].

The sequence of events &lt;math display=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;\left\{\bigcup_{n=N}^\infty E_n\right\}^\infty_{N=1}&lt;/math&gt; is non-increasing:

:&lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty E_n \supseteq \bigcup_{n=2}^\infty E_n \supseteq \cdots \supseteq \bigcup_{n=N}^\infty E_n \supseteq \bigcup_{n=N+1}^\infty E_n \supseteq \cdots \supseteq \limsup_{n\to\infty} E_n.&lt;/math&gt;

By continuity from above,

:&lt;math&gt;\Pr(\limsup_{n \to \infty} E_n) = \lim_{N\to\infty}\Pr\left(\bigcup_{n=N}^\infty E_n\right).&lt;/math&gt;

By subadditivity,

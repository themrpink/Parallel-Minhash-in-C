In undertaking these works, Nicholas was moved &quot;to strengthen the weak faith of the populace by the greatness of that which it sees&quot;. The Roman populace, however, appreciated neither his motives nor their results, and in 1452 a formidable conspiracy for the overthrow of the papal government under the leadership of [[Stefano Porcari]] was discovered and crushed. This revelation of disaffection, together with the fall of Constantinople in 1453, darkened the last years of Pope Nicholas. &quot;As Thomas of Sarzana&quot;, he said, &quot;I had more happiness in a day than now in a whole year&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

In late spring of 1452 Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine XI]] wrote to Pope Nicholas for help against the impending siege by Ottoman Sultan [[Mehmed II]]. Nicholas issued the bull ''[[Dum Diversas]]'' (18 June 1452) authorizing King Alfonso V of Portugal to &quot;attack, conquer, and subjugate Saracens, pagans and other enemies of Christ wherever they may be found&quot;. Issued less than a year before the fall of Constantinople, the bull may have been intended to begin another crusade against the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sardar&quot;&gt;Sardar, Ziauddin, and Davies, Merryl Wyn. 2004.

[[File:Portuguese_Morocco.PNG|thumb|Portuguese possessions in Morocco (1415–1769)]] 
Ownership of the [[Canary Islands]] continued to be a source of dispute between Spain and Portugal and Nicholas was asked to settle the matter, ultimately in favor of the Portuguese.{{sfnp|Stogre|1992|p=65}} The geographical area of the concession given in the bull is not explicit, but historian [[Richard Raiswell]] finds that it clearly refers to the recently discovered lands along the coast of West Africa.&lt;ref name=Raiswell&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ATq5_6h2AT0C&amp;pg=PA469|title=The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery|first=Junius P.|last=Rodriguez|date=6 March 1997|publisher=ABC-CLIO|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portuguese ventures were intended to compete with the Muslim trans-Sahara caravans, which played a key role in the highly profitable Muslim slave trade and also held a monopoly on West African gold and ivory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=okDypjibS0wC&amp;pg=PA25|title=Amazing Grace in John Newton: Slave Ship Captain, Hymn Writer, and Abolitionist|first=William E.|last=Phipps|date=6 March 2004|publisher=Mercer University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portuguese claimed territorial rights along the African coast by virtue of having invested time and treasure in discovering it; the Castilian claim was based on their being the heirs of the [[Visigoths]]. In 1454 a fleet of caravels from Seville and Cádiz traded along the African coast and upon their return, were intercepted by a Portuguese squadron. [[Enrique IV of Castile]] threatened war. Afonso V appealed to the Pope for moral support of Portugal's right to a monopoly of trade in lands she discovered.&lt;ref name=Bown&gt;{{cite book|last=Bown|first=Stephen R.|title=1494: How a Family Feud in Medieval Spain Divided the World in Half|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pDkfOAISLJIC&amp;pg=PT84|year=2012|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-61612-0|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The papal bull ''[[Romanus Pontifex]]'', issued on 8 January 1455, endorsed Portuguese possession of Cuerta (which they already held), and the exclusive right to trade, navigation, and fishing in the discovered lands, and reaffirmed the previous ''Dum Diversas''.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-elliott-hughes-2019&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Elliott |first1=Mary |last2=Hughes |first2=Jazmine |title=A Brief History of Slavery That You Didn't Learn in School |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/19/magazine/history-slavery-smithsonian.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=20 August 2019 |date=19 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It granted permission to Afonso and his heirs to &quot;... make purchases and sales of any things and goods, and victuals whatsoever, as it may seem fit, with any Saracens and infidels in said regions; ... provided they be not iron instruments, wood used for construction, cordage, ships, and any kinds of armor.&quot;&lt;ref name=Davenport&gt;See full text pp. 20–26 (English) in [https://books.google.com/books?id=uLILAAAAIAAJ&amp;vid=OCLC00855948&amp;dq=nicholas+v+%22Romanus+Pontifex%22&amp;jtp=9 ''European Treaties Bearing on the History of the United States and Its Dependencies to 1648''], Washington, D.C., [[Frances Gardiner Davenport]], [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]], 1917–37 – [[Google Books]].

The bull conferred exclusive trading rights to the Portuguese between Morocco and the Indies with the rights to conquer and convert the inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;The Historical Encyclopedia of world slavery&quot;, Richard Raiswell, p. 469&lt;/ref&gt; A significant concession given by Nicholas in a brief issued to King Alfonso in 1454 extended the rights granted to existing territories to all those that might be taken in the future.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Slavery and the Catholic Church&quot;'', John Francis Maxwell, p. 55, Barry Rose Publishers, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with these broad aims, it allowed the Portuguese &quot;to invade, search out, capture, vanquish, and subdue all Saracens and pagans whatsoever, and other enemies of Christ wheresoever placed, and the kingdoms, dukedoms, principalities, dominions, possessions, and all movable and immovable goods whatsoever held and possessed by them and to reduce their persons to perpetual slavery&quot;. However, together with a second reference to some who have already been enslaved, this has been used to suggest that Nicholas sanctioned the [[Atlantic slave trade|purchase of black slaves]] from &quot;the infidel&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=T. F. |last=Earle |first2=K. J. P. |last2=Lowe |title=Black Africans in Renaissance Europe |page=281 |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0521815826 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;... many Guineamen and other negroes, taken by force, and some by barter of unprohibited articles, or by other lawful contract of purchase, have been ... converted to the Catholic faith, and it is hoped, by the help of divine mercy, that if such progress be continued with them, either those peoples will be converted to the faith or at least the souls of many of them will be gained for Christ.&quot;&lt;ref name=Davenport/&gt;

It is on this basis that it has been argued that collectively the two bulls issued by Nicholas gave the Portuguese the rights to [[history of slavery|acquire slaves]] along the African coast by force or trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-elliott-hughes-2019&quot;/&gt; By dealing with local African chieftains and Muslim slave traders, the Portuguese sought to become key European players in the lucrative slave trade. The concessions given in them were confirmed by bulls issued by [[Pope Callixtus III]] (''Inter Caetera quae'' in 1456), [[Pope Sixtus IV|Sixtus IV]] (''Aeterni regis'' in 1481), and they became the models for subsequent bulls issued by [[Pope Alexander VI]]: ''[[Eximiae devotionis]]'' (3 May 1493),  ''[[Inter Caetera]]'' (4 May 1493) and ''Dudum Siquidem'' (23 September 1493), in which he conferred similar rights to Spain relating to the newly discovered lands in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Historical Encyclopedia of world slavery&quot;, Richard Raiswell, p. 469, &quot;Black Africans in Renaissance Europe&quot;, P. 281, Luis N. Rivera, 1992, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antipope-Nicholas V.jpg|thumb|Antipope Nicholas V crowns [[Louis IV the Bavarian]]; 12th May 1328]]
'''Nicholas V''', born '''Pietro Rainalducci''' (c. 1258{{snd}}16 October 1333)&lt;ref&gt;Amedeo De Vincentiis, [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/antipapa-niccolo-v_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ &quot;Niccolò V, antipapa,&quot;] ''Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani'' Volume 78 (2013). Treccani editore. {{in lang|it}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[antipope]] in [[Italy]] from 12 May 1328 to 25 July 1330 during the [[pontificate]] of [[Pope John XXII]] (1316–1334) at [[Avignon]]. He was the last antipope set up by a [[Holy Roman Emperor]].

Rainalducci was born at [[Corvaro]], an ancient stronghold near [[Rieti]] in [[Lazio]]. He joined the [[Franciscan]] order after separating from his wife in 1310, and became famous as a [[preacher]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Nicholas (popes)|display=Nicholas s.v. Nicholas V. (Pietro Rainalducci)|volume=19|page=651}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected through the influence of the [[excommunication|excommunicated]] [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis the Bavarian]], by an assembly of priests and laymen, and consecrated at [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]], [[Rome]], on 12 May 1328 by the bishop of [[Venice]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

After spending four months in Rome, he withdrew with Louis IV to [[Viterbo]],&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; but in December 1328 the [[papal legate]] [[Giovanni Gaetano Orsini (cardinal)|Cardinal Orsini]] began a campaign against Viterbo and [[Tarquinia|Corneto]].&lt;ref&gt;Salvador Miranda, ''The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church'', [http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1316.htm#Orsini ORSINI, Giovanni Gaetano (c. 1285–1335)], accessed 5 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas moved on to [[Grosseto]] and then to [[Pisa]], where he was guarded by the imperial [[vicar]]. On 19 February 1329 Nicholas V presided at a ceremony in the [[Piazza dei Miracoli|Duomo of Pisa]], at which a straw puppet representing [[Pope John XXII]] and dressed in pontifical robes was formally condemned, degraded, and handed over to the secular arm (to be &quot;executed&quot;).

Nicholas V was excommunicated by [[Pope John XXII]] in April 1329, and sought refuge with Count [[Boniface of Donoratico]] near [[Piombino]]. Having obtained assurance of pardon, he presented a confession of his sins first to the [[archbishop of Pisa]], and then at [[Avignon]] on 25 August 1330 to John XXII, who absolved him.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

He remained in honourable imprisonment in the [[Palais des Papes|papal palace, Avignon]] until his death in October 1333.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

The [[Merriam-Webster]] dictionary defines '''system analysis''' as &quot;the process of studying a procedure or [[business]] in order to identify its goals and purposes and create [[system]]s and procedures that will achieve them in an efficient way&quot;. Another view sees system analysis as a [[problem-solving]] technique that breaks down a system into its component pieces for the purpose of the studying how well those component parts work and interact to accomplish their purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Systems-Analysis-Design-Global-Enterprise/dp/0071107665 System Analysis and Design for the Global Enterprise] by Lonnie D. Bentley p.160 7th edition&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of system analysis relates closely to [[Requirement analysis|requirements analysis]] or to [[operations research]]. It is also &quot;an explicit formal inquiry carried out to help a [[decision maker]] identify a better course of action and make a better decision than they might otherwise have made.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070822025602/http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/ASC/SYSTEM_ANALY.html SYSTEMS ANALYSIS]&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms [[wiktionary:analysis|analysis]] and [[wiktionary:synthesis|synthesis]] stem from Greek, meaning &quot;to take apart&quot; and &quot;to put together,&quot; respectively. These terms are used in many [[scientific discipline]]s, from mathematics and logic to economics and psychology, to denote similar investigative procedures. Analysis is defined as &quot;the procedure by which we break down an intellectual or substantial whole into parts,&quot; while synthesis means &quot;the procedure by which we combine separate elements or components in order to form a coherent whole.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Tom Ritchey, [http://www.swemorph.com/pdf/anaeng-r.pdf  Analysis and Synthesis.]&lt;/ref&gt; System analysis researchers apply [[methodology]] to the systems involved, forming an overall picture.

System analysis is used in every field where something is developed. Analysis can also be a series of components that perform organic functions together, such as system engineering. [[System engineering]] is an [[interdisciplinary field]] of engineering that focuses on how complex engineering projects should be designed and managed.

==Information technology==
The development of a computer-based information system includes a system analysis phase. This helps produce the [[data model]], a precursor to creating or enhancing a [[database]]. There are a number of different approaches to system analysis. When a computer-based information system is developed, system analysis (according to the [[Waterfall model]]) would constitute the following steps:

* The development of a feasibility study: determining whether a project is economically, socially, technologically and organizationally feasible
* Fact-finding measures, designed to ascertain the requirements of the system's end-users (typically involving interviews, questionnaires, or visual observations of work on the existing system)
* Gauging how the end-users would operate the system (in terms of general experience in using computer hardware or software), what the system would be used for and so on

Another view outlines a phased approach to the process. This  approach breaks system analysis into 5 phases:

* Scope Definition: Clearly defined objectives and requirements necessary to meet a project's requirements as defined by its stakeholders
* Problem analysis: the process of understanding problems and needs and arriving at solutions that meet them
* Requirements analysis: determining the conditions that need to be met
* Logical design: looking at the logical relationship among the objects
* Decision analysis: making a final decision
 
[[Use case]]s are widely used system analysis modeling tools for identifying and expressing the functional requirements of a system. Each use case is a business scenario or event for which the system must provide a defined response. Use cases evolved from object-oriented analysis.

==Policy analysis==
The discipline of what is today known as [[policy analysis]] originated from the application of system analysis when it was first instituted by United States [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond Machiavelli : policy analysis comes of age|last=1936-|first=Radin, Beryl A.|date=2000|publisher=Georgetown University Press|isbn=0878407731|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=41834855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practitioners==
Practitioners of system analysis are often called up to dissect systems that have grown haphazardly to determine the current components of the system. This was shown during the year 2000 re-engineering effort as business and manufacturing processes were examined as part of the [[Y2K]] automation upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;Géza HUSI: Mechatronics Control Systems&lt;/ref&gt; Employment utilizing system analysis include [[system analyst]], [[business analyst]], [[Industrial engineering|manufacturing engineer]], [[system architect]], [[enterprise architect]], [[software architect]], etc.

While practitioners of system analysis can be called upon to create new systems, they often modify, expand or document existing systems ([[Process (engineering)|processes]], procedures and [[Methodology|methods]]). Researchers and practitioners rely on system analysis. Activity system analysis has been already applied to various research and practice studies including business management, educational reform, educational technology, etc.

The earliest evidence of settlement in Amman is in a Neolithic site known as [['Ain Ghazal]], where some of the oldest human statues ever found dating to 7250 BC were uncovered. During the [[Iron Age]], the city was known as ''[[Ammon]]'', home to the Kingdom of the Ammonites. It was named ''Philadelphia'' during its Greek and Roman periods, and was finally called ''Amman'' during the Islamic period. For much of the early and middle Islamic periods (7th–14th centuries), it served as a center for the [[Balqa]] district of Syria. Afterwards, Amman was a largely abandoned site until the late 19th century when [[Circassians|Circassian]] immigrants were settled there by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1878. The first municipal council was established in 1909.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reference12&quot; /&gt;

Amman witnessed rapid growth after its designation as [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]]'s capital in 1921, and after several successive waves of refugees: Palestinians in 1948 and 1967; Iraqis in 1990 and 2003; and Syrians since 2011. It was initially built on [[List of cities claimed to be built on seven hills|seven hills]] but now spans over 19 hills combining 22 areas,&lt;ref name=&quot;Reference12&quot;&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3SapTk5iGDkC&amp;pg=PA35| title=Cities of the Middle East and North Africa: A Historical Encyclopedia|isbn=978-1-57607-919-5|page=35| year=2007| author1=Michael Dumper| author2=Bruce E.

==Etymology==
Amman derives its name from the 13th century BC when the [[Ammon]]ites named it &quot;Rabbath Ammon&quot;, with the term ''Rabbath'' meaning the &quot;Capital&quot; or the &quot;King's Quarters&quot;. Over time, the term &quot;Rabbath&quot; was no longer used and the city became known as &quot;Ammon&quot;. The influence of new civilizations that conquered the city gradually changed its name to &quot;Amman&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ammancity.gov.jo/en/gam/about.asp| title=About GAM =&gt; History| work=Greater Amman Municipality| accessdate=2015-09-22| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002102003/http://ammancity.gov.jo/en/gam/about.asp| archivedate=2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Hebrew Bible]], it is referred to as &quot;Rabbat ʿAmmon&quot; ([[Biblical Hebrew]]: {{Hebrew|רבת עמון}}, [[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian Hebrew]] ''Rabbaṯ ʿAmmôn''). However, [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], the Macedonian ruler of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] who reigned from 283 to 246 BC, renamed the city to &quot;Philadelphia&quot; ({{lang-grc|Φιλαδέλφεια}}; literally: &quot;[[Philia|brotherly love]]&quot;) after occupying it. The name was given as an adulation to his own nickname, Philadelphus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mansaf.org/catholic/misdar.htm|accessdate=2015-09-22|title=MISDAR|work=mansaf.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mercator - Atlas - 1595.png|thumb|upright|Frontispiece of the 1595 atlas of Mercator]]
The concept and genre of atlas, in its modern sense, was the brainchild and one of the pioneering contributions of [[early modern Netherlandish cartography|early modern Netherlandish cartographers, geographers and cosmographers]];&lt;ref&gt;Including notable contributors like [[Gerardus Mercator]], [[Abraham Ortelius]], [[Gerard de Jode]], [[Cornelis de Jode]], [[Lucas Waghenaer]], [[Jodocus Hondius]], [[Henricus Hondius II|Henricus Hondius]], [[Johannes Janssonius]], [[Willem Blaeu]], [[Johannes Blaeu]], [[Claes Visscher]], [[Andreas Cellarius]], [[Frederik de Wit]]. Also, some atlases by Netherlandish cartographers such as ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'' (''Theater of the Whole World''), ''[[Speculum Orbis Terrarum]]'', ''[[Speculum Orbis Terrae]]'' (''Mirror of the World''), ''[[Lucas Janszoon Waghenaer|Spieghel der Zeevaerdt]]'' (''Mariner's Mirror''), ''[[Mercator-Hondius Atlas]]'', ''[[Atlas Blaeu-Van der Hem]]'', ''[[Atlas Maior]]'', ''[[Atlas van Loon]]'', ''[[Klencke Atlas]]'', and ''[[Harmonia Macrocosmica]]'' are considered masterpieces in the [[history of cartography|history of mapmaking]].&lt;/ref&gt; most notably [[Gerardus Mercator]] (who first used the term 'atlas' for a collection of maps)&lt;ref&gt;Van der Krogt, Peter (2015), 'Chapter 6: Gerhard Mercator and his Cosmography: How the 'Atlas' became an Atlas,'; in: Gerhard Holzer, et al. (eds.), ''A World of Innovation: Cartography in the Time of Gerhard Mercator''. (Newcastle upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2015), pp. 112–130&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Abraham Ortelius]] (who often recognized as the creator of [[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum|the  first true atlas in the modern sense]]).&lt;ref&gt;Binding, Paul: ''Imagined Corners: Exploring the [[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum|World's First Atlas]]''. (London: Headline Book Publishing, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the word &quot;atlas&quot; in a geographical context dates from 1595 when the German-Flemish geographer Gerardus Mercator published ''[[Atlas Cosmographicae|Atlas Sive Cosmographicae Meditationes de Fabrica Mundi et Fabricati Figura]]'' (''Atlas or cosmographical meditations upon the creation of the universe, and the universe as created''). This title provides Mercator's definition of the word as a description of the creation and form of the whole universe, not simply as a collection of maps. The volume that was published posthumously one year after his death is a wide-ranging text but, as the editions evolved, it became simply a collection of maps and it is in that sense that the word was used from the middle of the seventeenth century.  The neologism coined by Mercator was a mark of his respect for the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]], [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], the &quot;King of Mauretania&quot;, whom he considered to be the first great geographer.&lt;ref&gt;Mercator's own account of the reasons for choosing King Atlas are given in the preface of the 1595 atlas. A translation by David Sullivan  is available in a digital version of the atlas published by  [https://web.archive.org/web/20050314051106/http://www.octavo.com/editions/mcrats/ Octavo].

==History of atlases==
The first work that contained systematically arranged maps of uniform size representing the first modern atlas was prepared by Italian cartographer [[Pietro Coppo]] in early 16th century, however it wasn't published at the time so is conventionally not considered the first atlas. Rather, this title is awarded to the collection of maps ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'' by the [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabantian]] cartographer [[Abraham Ortelius]] printed in 1570.
There is, however, quite a difference in the way atlases were published in the 16th-19th centuries and nowadays. Unlike now most atlases were not bound and ready for the customer to buy, but their possible components were shelved separately. The client could change the contents to their liking, have the maps coloured/gilded or not and after publisher and customer agreed the atlas was bound. Therefore it is possible that early printed atlases with the same title page can be different in contents.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Smits, Todd Fell (2011). Early printed atlases: shaping Plato's 'Forms' into bibliographic descriptions. In: ''Journal of map &amp; geography libraries : advances in geospatial information, collections &amp; archives'', (ISSN 1542-0353), 7(2011)2, p. 184-210.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of atlases==
A ''travel atlas'' is made for easy use during travel, and often has spiral bindings so it may be folded flat (for example [[Geographers' A-Z Map Company]] famous A–Z atlases). It has maps at a large zoom so the maps can be reviewed easily. A travel atlas may also be referred to as a ''road map''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/road%20map|title=Road map|dictionary= Merriam Webster|accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''desk atlas'' is made similar to a reference book. It may be in hardback or paperback form.

There are atlases of the other planets (and their satellites) in the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The NASA Atlas of the Solar System|ISBN=978-0521561273|author1=Greeley, Ronald|author2=Batson, Raymond}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atlases of [[anatomy]] exist, mapping out organs of the human body or other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schwartz |first=John |date=2008-04-22 |title=The Body in Depth |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/22/science/22bass.html |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=2015-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[anatomy]], the '''atlas''' (C1) is the most superior (first) [[cervical vertebra]] of the [[spine (anatomy)|spine]] and is located in the [[neck]]. It is named for [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] of [[Greek mythology]] because, just as Atlas supported the globe, it supports the entire [[head (anatomy)|head]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Atlas the medical dictionary; the free dictionary].&lt;/ref&gt;

The atlas is the topmost vertebra and, with the [[axis (anatomy)|axis]] (the vertebra below it), forms the joint connecting the [[skull]] and spine. The atlas and axis are specialized to allow a greater [[range of motion]] than normal vertebrae. They are responsible for the nodding and rotation movements of the head.

The [[atlanto-occipital joint]] allows the head to nod up and down on the [[vertebral column]]. The [[Dens (anatomy)|dens]] acts as a pivot that allows the atlas and attached head to rotate on the axis, side to side.

The atlas's chief peculiarity is that it has no body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moulton |first1=Andrew |title=Clinically Relevant Spinal Anatomy |journal=Surgical Management of Spinal Deformities |pages=13–43 |date=2009 |doi=10.1016/B978-141603372-1.50005-6 |isbn=9781416033721 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is ring-like and consists of an anterior and a posterior arch and two lateral masses.

The atlas and axis are important neurologically because the [[brainstem]] extends down to the axis.

==Structure==
[[File:Gray86.png|thumb|Structure of the atlas, the first [[cervical vertebra]] ]]

===Anterior arch===
The anterior arch forms about one-fifth of the ring: its anterior surface is convex, and presents at its center the anterior tubercle for the attachment of the ''[[Longus colli]]'' [[muscle]]s and the [[anterior longitudinal ligament]]; posteriorly it is concave, and marked by a smooth, oval or circular facet (''fovea dentis''), for articulation with the [[odontoid process]] (dens) of the axis.

The upper and lower borders respectively give attachment to the [[anterior atlantooccipital membrane]] and the [[anterior atlantoaxial ligament]]; the former connects it with the [[occipital bone]] above, and the latter with the axis below.&lt;ref&gt;''Gray's Anatomy'', pp. 36–37 (10/27/11)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Posterior arch===
[[File:Gray308.png|thumb|right|220px|Median sagittal section through the occipital bone and first three cervical vertebræ, showing ligamentous attachments]]

The posterior arch forms about two-fifths of the circumference of the ring: it ends behind in the posterior tubercle, which is the [[rudiment (biology)|rudiment]] of a spinous process and gives origin to the ''[[Recti capitis posteriores minores]]'' and the [[ligamentum nuchae]]. The diminutive size of this process prevents any interference with the movements between the atlas and the skull.

The posterior part of the arch presents above and behind a rounded edge for the attachment of the [[posterior atlantooccipital membrane]], while immediately behind each superior articular process is the superior vertebral notch (''[[sulcus arteriae vertebralis]]''). This is a groove that is sometimes converted into a foramen by ossification of the posterior atlantooccipital membrane to create a delicate bony spiculum which arches backward from the posterior end of the superior articular process. This [[anatomic variant|anatomical variant]] is known as an [[arcuate foramen]].

This groove transmits the [[vertebral artery]], which, after ascending through the foramen in the transverse process, winds around the lateral mass in a direction backward and medially to enter the [[Vertebrobasilar system|vertebrobasilar circulation]] through the [[foramen magnum]]; it also transmits the [[suboccipital nerve]] (first spinal nerve)

On the under surface of the posterior arch, behind the inferior articular facets, are two shallow grooves, the inferior vertebral notches. The lower border gives attachment to the [[posterior atlantoaxial ligament]], which connects it with the axis.

===Lateral masses===
The lateral masses are the most bulky and solid parts of the atlas, in order to support the weight of the head.

Each carries two articular facets, a superior and an inferior.

* The ''superior facets'' are of large size, oval, concave, and approach each other in front, but diverge behind: they are directed upward, medially, and a little backward, each forming a cup for the corresponding [[Condyle (anatomy)|condyle]] of the occipital bone, and are admirably adapted to the nodding movements of the head. Not infrequently they are partially subdivided by indentations which encroach upon their margins.
* The ''inferior articular facets'' are circular in form, flattened or slightly convex and directed downward and medially, articulating with the axis, and permitting the rotatory movements of the head.

===Vertebral foramen===
Just below the medial margin of each superior facet is a small tubercle, for the attachment of the [[transverse atlantal ligament]] which stretches across the ring of the atlas and divides the [[vertebral foramen]] into two unequal parts:

* the ''anterior'' or ''smaller'' receiving the [[odontoid process]] of the axis
* the ''posterior'' transmitting the [[spinal cord]] (''medulla spinalis'') and its membranes

This part of the vertebral canal is of considerable size, much greater than is required for the accommodation of the spinal cord.

===Transverse processes===
The transverse processes are large; they project laterally and downward from the lateral masses, and serve for the attachment of [[muscle]]s which assist in rotating the head. They are long, and their anterior and posterior tubercles are fused into one mass; the foramen transversarium is directed from below, upward and backward.

===Development===
[[File:Gray104.png|thumb|right|300px|The atlas ossifies from three centers]]
The atlas is usually [[ossification|ossified]] from three centers.

Of these, one appears in each lateral mass about the seventh week of fetal life, and extends backward; at birth, these portions of bone are separated from one another behind by a narrow interval filled with [[cartilage]].

Between the third and fourth years they unite either directly or through the medium of a separate center developed in the cartilage.

At birth, the anterior arch consists of cartilage; in this a separate center appears about the end of the first year after birth, and joins the lateral masses from the sixth to the eighth year.

The lines of union extend across the anterior portions of the superior articular facets.

Occasionally there is no separate center, the anterior arch being formed by the forward extension and ultimate junction of the two lateral masses; sometimes this arch is ossified from two centers, one on either side of the middle line.

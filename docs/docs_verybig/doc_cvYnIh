It was the Norwegian scientist [[Kristian Birkeland]] who, in the early 1900s, laid the foundation for our current understanding of geomagnetism and polar auroras.

==Non-terrestrial auroras==
{{see also|Magnetosphere of Jupiter#Aurorae}}
[[Image:Jupiter.Aurora.HST.UV.jpg|thumb|[[Jupiter]] aurora; the far left bright spot connects magnetically to [[Io (moon)|Io]]; the spots at the bottom of the image lead to [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and [[Europa (moon)|Europa]].]]

Both [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] have magnetic fields that are stronger than Earth's (Jupiter's equatorial field strength is 4.3 gauss, compared to 0.3 gauss for Earth), and both have extensive radiation belts. Auroras have been observed on both gas planets, most clearly using the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], and the [[Cassini–Huygens|''Cassini'']] and [[Galileo (spacecraft)|''Galileo'']] spacecraft, as well as on [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]].&lt;ref name=&quot;esa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMLQ71DU8E_index_0.html |title=ESA Portal – Mars Express discovers auroras on Mars |publisher=Esa.int |date=11 August 2004 |access-date=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aurorae on Saturn seem, like Earth's, to be powered by the solar wind. However, Jupiter's aurorae are more complex. The Jupiter's main auroral oval is associated with the plasma produced by the volcanic moon, [[Io (moon)|Io]] and the transport of this plasma within the planet's [[Magnetosphere of Jupiter|magnetosphere]]. An uncertain fraction of Jupiter's aurorae are powered by the solar wind. In addition, the moons, especially Io, are also powerful sources of aurora. These arise from electric currents along field lines (&quot;field aligned currents&quot;), generated by a dynamo mechanism due to the relative motion between the rotating planet and the moving moon. Io, which has active [[volcanism]] and an ionosphere, is a particularly strong source, and its currents also generate radio emissions, which have been studied since 1955. Using the Hubble Space Telescope, auroras over Io, Europa and Ganymede have all been observed.

Auroras have also been observed on [[Venus]] and [[Mars]]. Venus has no magnetic field and so Venusian auroras appear as bright and diffuse patches of varying shape and intensity, sometimes distributed over the full disc of the planet. A Venusian aurora originates when electrons from the solar wind collide with the night-side atmosphere.

An aurora was detected on Mars, on 14 August 2004, by the SPICAM instrument aboard [[Mars Express]]. The aurora was located at [[Terra Cimmeria]], in the region of 177° East, 52° South. The total size of the emission region was about 30&amp;nbsp;km across, and possibly about 8&amp;nbsp;km high. By analyzing a map of crustal magnetic anomalies compiled with data from [[Mars Global Surveyor]], scientists observed that the region of the emissions corresponded to an area where the strongest magnetic field is localized. This correlation indicated that the origin of the light emission was a flux of electrons moving along the crust magnetic lines and exciting the upper atmosphere of Mars.&lt;ref name=&quot;esa&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=18 February 2006 |url=http://www.universetoday.com/am/publish/mars_express_aurorae.html?1722006 |title=Mars Express Finds Auroras on Mars |work=Universe Today |access-date=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ever [[Extra-solar object|extra-solar]] auroras were discovered in July 2015 over the [[brown dwarf]] star [[LSR J1835+3259]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/alien-life-exoplanets/monstrous-aurora-detected-beyond-our-solar-system-150729.htm |title=Monstrous Aurora Detected Beyond our Solar System |last1=O'Neill |first1=Ian |date=29 July 2015 |publisher=Discovery |access-date=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mainly red aurora was found to be a million times brighter than the Northern Lights, a result of the charged particles interacting with hydrogen in the atmosphere. It has been speculated that stellar winds may be stripping off material from the surface of the brown dwarf to produce their own electrons. Another possible explanation for the auroras is that an as-yet-undetected body around the dwarf star is throwing off material, as is the case with Jupiter and its moon Io.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/30087-alien-auroras-found-beyond-solar-system.html |title=First Alien Auroras Found, Are 1 Million Times Brighter Than Any on Earth |last1=Q.

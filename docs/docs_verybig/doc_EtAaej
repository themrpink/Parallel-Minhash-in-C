An '''atoll'''  ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˈ|æ|t|ɒ|l|,_|ˈ|æ|t|ɔː|l|,_|ˈ|æ|t|oʊ|l|,_|ə|ˈ|t|ɒ|l|,_|ə|ˈ|t|ɔː|l|,_|ə|ˈ|t|oʊ|l}}),&lt;ref&gt;pronunciation in old video on youtube, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z29H_AX-jTs Bikini Atoll video]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Dictionary.com|atoll}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes known as a '''coral atoll''', is a ring-shaped [[coral reef]], including a coral rim that encircles a [[lagoon]] partially or completely. There may be [[coral island]]s or [[cay]]s on the rim.&lt;ref name=&quot;blakegh1&quot; /&gt; {{rp|page=60}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Migon2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Piotr |editor-last=Migoń|editor-link=Piotr Migoń|title=Geomorphological Landscapes of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-TI55urJYyEC|accessdate=12 February 2013 |year=2010 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-90-481-3055-9 |page=349}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The typical atoll was originally formed as an oceanic volcano. A coral reef grew around the shore of the volcano and then, over several million years, the volcano went extinct and eroded and subsided completely beneath the surface of the ocean. The reef and the small coral islets on top of it are all that is left of the original island, and a lagoon has taken the place of the former volcano. For the atoll to persist, the coral reef must be maintained at the sea surface, with coral growth matching any relative change in sea level (subsidence of the island or rising oceans).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Erickson |first1=Jon |title=Marine Geology: Exploring the New Frontiers of the Ocean |publisher=Facts on File, Inc. |year=2003 |isbn= 978-0-8160-4874-8 |pages=126–128 |ref=none|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CYCiFksxZckC&amp;pg=PA126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
The word ''atoll'' comes from the [[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]] (an [[Indo-Aryan language]] spoken on the [[Maldives|Maldive Islands]]) word ''atholhu'' ([[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]]: {{lang|dv|އަތޮޅު}}, {{IPA-dv|ˈət̪ɔɭu|}}), meaning the palm (of the hand).&lt;sup&gt;''[[OED]]''&lt;/sup&gt; Its first recorded use in English was in 1625 as ''atollon''. [[Charles Darwin]] recognized its indigenous origin and coined, the definition of atolls as &quot;circular groups of coral islets&quot;, which is synonymous with &quot;lagoon-island&quot;, in his ''[[The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;darwincr1&quot; /&gt;{{rp|page=2}}

More modern definitions of ''atoll'' describe them as &quot;annular reefs enclosing a lagoon in which there are no [[Promontory|promontories]] other than reefs and [[islet]]s composed of reef [[detritus (biology)|detritus]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McNeil (1954, p.&amp;nbsp;396).&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;in an exclusively morphological sense, [as] a ring-shaped ribbon reef enclosing a lagoon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbridge (1950, p.&amp;nbsp;341).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are approximately 440 atolls.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watts2019&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=Science, Seamounts and Society | author=Watts, T. | journal=Geoscientist | year=2019 | volume=August 2019 | pages=10–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the world's atolls are in the Pacific Ocean (with concentrations in the [[Tuamotu Islands]], [[Caroline Islands]], [[Marshall Islands]], [[Coral Sea Islands]], and the island groups of [[Kiribati]], [[Tuvalu]] and [[Tokelau]]) and [[Indian Ocean]] (the [[Atolls of the Maldives]], the [[Lakshadweep Islands]], the [[Chagos Archipelago]], and the [[Outer Islands (Seychelles)|Outer Islands]] of the [[Seychelles]]). The Atlantic Ocean has no large groups of atolls, other than eight atolls east of [[Nicaragua]] that belong to the [[Colombia]]n department of [[San Andres and Providencia]] in the Caribbean.

Reef-building corals will thrive only in warm [[Tropics|tropical]] and [[Subtropics|subtropical]] waters of oceans and seas, and therefore atolls are found only in the tropics and subtropics. The northernmost atoll of the world is [[Kure Atoll]] at 28°24′ N, along with other atolls of the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]]. The southernmost atolls of the world are [[Elizabeth Reef]] at 29°58′ S, and nearby [[Middleton Reef]] at 29°29′ S, in the [[Tasman Sea]], both of which are part of the [[Coral Sea Islands]] Territory. The next southerly atoll is [[Ducie Island]] in the [[Pitcairn Islands]] Group, at 24°40′ S. 

[[Bermuda]] is sometimes claimed as the &quot;northernmost atoll&quot; at a [[latitude]] of 32°24′ N. At this latitude, coral reefs would not develop without the warming waters of the [[Gulf Stream]]. However, Bermuda is termed a ''[[pseudo-atoll]]'' because its general form, while resembling that of an atoll, has a very different mode of formation. While there is no atoll directly on the Equator, the closest atoll to the Equator is [[Aranuka]] of Kiribati, with its southern tip just 12&amp;nbsp;km north of the Equator.

In most cases, the land area of an atoll is very small in comparison to the total area. Atoll islands are low lying, with their elevations less than 5 meters (9). Measured by total area, [[Lifou]] (1146&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is the largest [[raised coral atoll]] of the world, followed by [[Rennell Island]] (660&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldislandinfo.com/MISINFORMATION.htm |title=Misinformation about Islands |publisher=worldislandinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More sources, however, list [[Kiritimati]] as the largest atoll in the world in terms of land area. It is also a raised coral atoll (321.37&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; land area; according to other sources even 575&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), 160&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; main lagoon, 168&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; other lagoons (according to other sources 319&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; total lagoon size). 

The remains of an ancient atoll as a hill in a limestone area is called a [[reef knoll]]. The second largest atoll by dry land area is [[Aldabra]], with 155&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The largest atoll in terms of island numbers is [[Huvadhu]] Atoll in the south of the Maldives, with 255 islands.

In 1842, Charles Darwin explained the creation of coral atolls in the southern Pacific Ocean based upon observations made during a five-year voyage aboard {{HMS|Beagle}} from 1831 to 1836. Accepted as basically correct, his explanation suggested that several tropical island types: from high [[volcanic island]], through [[barrier reef]] island, to atoll, represented a sequence of gradual [[subsidence]] of what started as an oceanic [[volcano]]. He reasoned that a [[fringing reef|fringing coral reef]] surrounding a volcanic island in the tropical sea will grow upward as the island subsides (sinks), becoming an &quot;almost atoll&quot;, or barrier reef island, as typified by an island such as [[Aitutaki]] in the Cook Islands, and [[Bora Bora]] and others in the [[Society Islands]]. The fringing reef becomes a barrier reef for the reason that the outer part of the reef maintains itself near [[sea level]] through [[biotic potential|biotic]] growth, while the inner part of the reef falls behind, becoming a lagoon because conditions are less favorable for the coral and calcareous [[algae]] responsible for most reef growth. In time, subsidence carries the old volcano below the ocean surface and the barrier reef remains.  At this point, the island has become an atoll.

Atolls are the product of the growth of tropical marine organisms, and so these islands are found only in warm tropical waters. Volcanic islands located beyond the warm water temperature requirements of [[hermatypic]] (reef-building) organisms become [[seamount]]s as they subside, and are eroded away at the surface. An island that is located where the ocean water temperatures are just sufficiently warm for upward reef growth to keep pace with the rate of subsidence is said to be at the '''Darwin Point'''.  Islands in colder, more polar regions evolve toward seamounts or [[guyot]]s; warmer, more equatorial islands evolve toward atolls, for example [[Kure Atoll]].

&lt;gallery widths=&quot;120&quot; heights=&quot;80&quot;&gt;
Atoll forming-volcano.png|Darwin's theory starts with a [[volcanic island]] which becomes extinct
Atoll forming-Fringing reef.png|As the island and ocean floor subside, coral growth builds a [[fringing reef]], often including a shallow lagoon between the land and the main reef
Atoll forming-Barrier reef.png|As the subsidence continues the fringing reef becomes a larger barrier reef farther from the shore with a bigger and deeper [[lagoon]] inside
Atoll forming-Atoll.png|Ultimately the island sinks below the sea, and the barrier reef becomes an atoll enclosing an open lagoon
&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Reginald Aldworth Daly]] offered a somewhat different explanation for atoll formation: islands worn away by [[erosion]], by ocean waves and streams, during the last [[Quaternary glaciation|glacial stand]] of the sea of some {{convert|900|ft|m}} below present sea level developed as coral islands (atolls), or barrier reefs on a platform surrounding a volcanic island not completely worn away, as sea levels gradually rose from melting of the [[glacier]]s. Discovery of the great depth of the volcanic remnant beneath many atolls, such as at [[Midway Atoll]], favors the Darwin explanation. But fluctuating sea level has also had considerable influence on atolls and other reefs.

Coral atolls are important as places where [[dolomitization]] of [[calcite]] occurs. At certain depths water is undersaturated in [[calcium carbonate]] but saturated in [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]]. Convection created by tides and sea currents enhances this change. Hydrothermal currents created by volcanoes under the atoll may also play an important role.

== Investigation by the Royal Society of London into the formation of coral reefs ==
In 1896, 1897 and 1898, the [[Royal Society of London]] carried out drilling on [[Funafuti]] atoll in [[Tuvalu]] for the purpose of investigating the [[formation of coral reefs]]. They wanted to determine whether traces of shallow water organisms could be found at depth in the [[coral]] of Pacific atolls. This investigation followed the work on [[The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs|the structure and distribution of coral reefs]] conducted by [[Charles Darwin]] in the Pacific.

The first expedition in 1896 was led by Professor [[William Johnson Sollas]] of the [[University of Oxford]]. Geologists included [[Walter George Woolnough]] and [[Edgeworth David]] of the [[University of Sydney]]. Professor Edgeworth David led the expedition in 1897.&lt;ref name=&quot;davidcm1&quot; /&gt; The third expedition in 1898 was led by [[Alfred Edmund Finckh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;finckhae1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cantrellc1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rodgerska1&quot; /&gt;

{{other uses}}
[[File:Azimuth-Altitude schematic.svg|right|thumb|The azimuth is the angle formed between a reference direction (in this example north) and a [[sightline|line]] from the observer to a point of interest projected on the same plane as the reference direction orthogonal to the [[zenith]].]]
{{Astrodynamics}}
An '''azimuth''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-azimuth.ogg|ˈ|æ|z|ɪ|m|ə|θ}}; from Arabic اَلسُّمُوت ''as-sumūt'', 'the directions', the plural form of the Arabic noun السَّمْت ''as-samt'', meaning 'the direction') is an [[Angle#Measuring angles|angular measurement]] in a [[spherical coordinate system]]. The [[vector space|vector]] from an observer ([[origin (mathematics)|origin]]) to a point of interest is [[graphical projection|projected]] [[perpendicular]]ly onto a [[reference plane]]; the angle between the projected vector and a reference vector on the reference plane is called the azimuth.

When used as a [[horizontal coordinate system|celestial coordinate]], the azimuth is the [[horizon]]tal direction of a [[star]] or other [[astronomical object]] in the [[sky]]. The star is the point of interest, the reference plane is the local area (e.g. a circular area 5&amp;nbsp;km in radius at [[sea level]]) around an observer on [[planetary surface|Earth's surface]], and the reference vector points to [[true north]]. The azimuth is the angle between the north vector and the star's vector on the [[horizontal plane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/azimuth |title=Azimuth |work=[[Dictionary.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azimuth is usually measured in [[degree (angle)|degrees]] (°). The concept is used in [[navigation]], [[astrometry|astronomy]], [[engineering]], [[map]]ping, mining, and [[ballistics]].

==Navigation==
[[File:True North Mount Allen.fw.png|thumb|left|Azimuth Marker, Mount Allen ([[Sandstone Peak]]), Southern California, USA.]] In land navigation, azimuth is usually denoted [[alpha]], ''α'', and defined as a horizontal angle measured [[clockwise and counterclockwise|clockwise]] from a north base line or ''[[meridian (geography)|meridian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army, ''Map Reading and Land Navigation'', FM 21–26, Headquarters, Dept. of the Army, Washington, D.C. (7 May 1993), ch. 6, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army, ''Map Reading and Land Navigation'', FM 21–26, Headquarters, Dept. of the Army, Washington, D.C. (28 March 1956), ch. 3, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; ''Azimuth'' has also been more generally defined as a horizontal angle measured clockwise from any fixed reference plane or easily established base direction line.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army, ch. 6 p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army, ''Advanced Map and Aerial Photograph Reading'', Headquarters, War Department, Washington, D.C. (17 September 1941), pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army, ''Advanced Map and Aerial Photograph Reading'', Headquarters, War Department, Washington, D.C. (23 December 1944), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the reference plane for an azimuth is typically [[true north]], measured as a 0° azimuth, though other angular units ([[grad (angle)|grad]], [[Angular mil|mil]]) can be used. Moving clockwise on a 360 degree circle, east has azimuth 90°, south 180°, and west 270°. There are exceptions: some navigation systems use south as the reference vector. Any direction can be the reference vector, as long as it is clearly defined.

Quite commonly, azimuths or compass bearings are stated in a system in which either north or south can be the zero, and the angle may be measured clockwise or anticlockwise from the zero. For example, a bearing might be described as &quot;(from) south, (turn) thirty degrees (toward the) east&quot; (the words in brackets are usually omitted), abbreviated &quot;S30°E&quot;, which is the bearing 30 degrees in the eastward direction from south, i.e. the bearing 150 degrees clockwise from north. The reference direction, stated first, is always north or south, and the turning direction, stated last, is east or west. The directions are chosen so that the angle, stated between them, is positive, between zero and 90 degrees. If the bearing happens to be exactly in the direction of one of the [[cardinal point]]s, a different notation, e.g. &quot;due east&quot;, is used instead.

==Cartographical azimuth==
[[File:Brunton.JPG|thumb|right|A standard Brunton Geo [[compass]], commonly used by geologists and surveyors to measure azimuth]]
The cartographical azimuth (in decimal degrees) can be calculated when the coordinates of 2 points are known in a flat plane ([[Spatial reference system|cartographical coordinates]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{180}{\pi} \operatorname{atan2}(X_2 - X_1, Y_2 - Y_1)&lt;/math&gt;

Remark that the reference axes are swapped relative to the (counterclockwise) mathematical [[polar coordinate system]] and that the azimuth is clockwise relative to the north.
This is the reason why the X and Y axis in the above formula are swapped.
If the azimuth becomes negative, one can always add 360°.

The formula in [[radian]]s would be slightly easier:
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \operatorname{atan2}(X_2 - X_1, Y_2 - Y_1)&lt;/math&gt;

Note the swapped &lt;math&gt;(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; in contrast to the normal &lt;math&gt;(y, x)&lt;/math&gt; [[atan2]] input order.

===Calculating coordinates===
When the coordinates (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) of one point, the distance ''D'', and the azimuth ''α'' to another point (''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are known, one can calculate its coordinates:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  X_2 &amp;= X_1 + D \sin\alpha \\
  Y_2 &amp;= Y_1 + D \cos\alpha
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This is typically used in [[triangulation]] and azimuth identification (AzID), especially in [[radar]] applications.

==Calculating azimuth==
[[File:Bearing and azimuth along the geodesic.png|thumb|The azimuth between [[Cape Town]] and [[Melbourne]] along the [[geodesic]] (the shortest route) changes from 141° to 42°. [[Orthographic projection in cartography|Azimuthal orthographic projection]] and [[Miller cylindrical projection]].]]
We are standing at latitude &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1&lt;/math&gt;, longitude zero; we want to find the azimuth from our viewpoint to Point 2 at latitude &lt;math&gt;\varphi_2&lt;/math&gt;, longitude ''L'' (positive eastward). We can get a fair approximation by assuming the Earth is a sphere, in which case the azimuth ''α'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\tan\alpha = \frac{\sin L}{\cos\varphi_1 \tan\varphi_2 - \sin\varphi_1 \cos L}&lt;/math&gt;

A better approximation assumes the Earth is a slightly-squashed sphere (an ''[[oblate spheroid]]''); ''azimuth'' then has at least two very slightly different meanings. ''Normal-section azimuth'' is the angle measured at our viewpoint by a theodolite whose axis is perpendicular to the surface of the spheroid; ''geodetic azimuth'' is the angle between north and the ''geodesic''; that is, the shortest path on the surface of the spheroid from our viewpoint to Point 2. The difference is usually immeasurably small; if Point 2 is not more than 100&amp;nbsp;km away, the difference will not exceed 0.03 arc second.

Various websites will calculate geodetic azimuth; e.g., [http://www.ga.gov.au/geodesy/datums/vincenty_inverse.jsp GeoScience Australia site]. Formulas for calculating geodetic azimuth are linked in the [[Geographical distance#Ellipsoidal-surface formulae|distance article]].

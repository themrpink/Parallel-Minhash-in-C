The influence of the Mongol invasion on the territories of Kievan Rus' was uneven. [[Colin McEvedy]] (''Atlas of World Population History, 1978'') estimates the population of Kievan Rus' dropped from 7.5&amp;nbsp; million prior to the invasion to 7&amp;nbsp; million afterwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mongol Conquests&quot;/&gt; Centers such as Kiev took centuries to rebuild and recover from the devastation of the initial attack. The [[Novgorod Republic]] continued to prosper, and new entities, the rival cities of Moscow and Tver, began to flourish under the Mongols. Moscow's eventual dominance of northern and eastern Rus' was in large part attributable to the Mongols. After the prince of Tver [[Tver Uprising of 1327|joined a rebellion against the Mongols]] in 1327, his rival prince [[Ivan I of Moscow]] joined the Mongols in crushing Tver and devastating its lands. By doing so he eliminated his rival, allowed the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] to move its headquarters to Moscow, and was granted the title of [[Grand Prince]] by the Mongols. As such, the Muscovite prince became the chief intermediary between the Mongol overlords and the Rus' lands, which paid further dividends for Moscow's rulers. While the Mongols often raided other areas of Rus', they tended to respect the lands controlled by their principal collaborator. This, in turn, attracted nobles and their servants who sought to settle in the relatively secure and peaceful Moscow lands.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Pipes]]. (1995). ''Russia Under the Old Regime.'' New York: Penguin Books. pp. 61-62&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Rus' forces defeated the Golden Horde at the [[Battle of Kulikovo]] in 1380, Mongol domination of parts of Rus' territories, with the requisite demands of tribute, continued until the [[Great stand on the Ugra river]] in 1480.

Historians argued{{by whom|date=July 2014}} that without the Mongol destruction of Kievan Rus', the Rus' would not have unified into the [[Tsardom of Russia]] and, subsequently, the [[Russian Empire]] would not have risen. Trade routes with the East went through Rus' territory, making them a center of trade between east and west. Mongol influence, while destructive to their enemies, had a significant long-term effect on the rise of modern Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://russia.rin.ru/guides_e/6860.html|title=The Consequences of Mongolian Invasion.|website=russia.rin.ru|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
The Mongol conquest of Rus' left a deep mark on Russian historiography. The ability of pagan nomads from inner Asia to subjugate parts of Russia is according to Charles J. Halperin a source of embarrassment among the &quot;educated Russian society&quot;.&lt;ref name=Halperin2011&gt;{{cite journal |last= Halperin |first= Charles J. |year= 2011 |title= False Identity and Multiple Identities in Russian History: The Mongol Empire and Ivan the Terrible |url= http://carlbeckpapers.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cbp/article/view/160 |journal= The Carl Beck Papers |publisher= The Center for Russian and East European Studies|number= 2103 |pages= 1–71|doi= 10.5195/cbp.2011.160|access-date=15 June 2016|doi-access= free }}&lt;/ref&gt; This embarrassment is thought to be a contributing cause to the emergence of [[New Chronology (Fomenko)|New Chronology]] [[pseudohistory]] that claims the conquest is a forgery.&lt;ref name=Halperin2011/&gt;

==Influence on Rus' society==
[[File:Kyivan Rus' 1220-1240.png|thumb|left|Maximum extent and principalities of [[Kievan Rus']], 1220–1240. These principalities included [[Vladimir-Suzdal]], [[Principality of Smolensk|Smolensk]], [[Principality of Chernigov|Chernigov]] and [[Principality of Ryazan|Ryazan]], the last annexed by the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Duchy of Moscow]] in 1521.]]

Historians have debated the long-term influence of Mongol rule on Rus' society. The Mongols have been blamed for the destruction of Kievan Rus', the breakup of the ancient Rus' nationality into three components and the introduction of the concept of &quot;[[oriental despotism]]&quot; into Russia.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} Historians also credit the Mongol regime with an important role in the development of Muscovy as a state. Under Mongol occupation, for example, Muscovy developed its [[mestnichestvo]] hierarchy, [[mail|postal]] road network (based on Mongolian ''[[ortoo]]'' system, known in Russian as &quot;yam&quot;, hence the terms ''yamshchik'', ''Yamskoy Prikaz'', etc.), [[census]], fiscal system and military organization.&lt;ref&gt;See Ostrowski, page 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The period of Mongol rule over the former Rus' polities included significant cultural and interpersonal contacts between the Slavic and Mongolian ruling classes. By 1450, the [[Tatar language]] had become fashionable in the court of the Grand Prince of Moscow, [[Vasily II of Moscow|Vasily II]], who was accused of excessive love of the Tatars and their speech, and many Russian noblemen adopted Tatar surnames (for example, a member of the Veliamanov family adopted the Turkic name &quot;Aksak&quot; and his descendants were the [[Aksakov]]s)&lt;ref&gt;Vernadsky, George. (1970). ''The Mongols and Russia.  A History of Russia, Vol. III.'' New Haven: Yale University Press pp. 382-385.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Russian [[boyar]] (noble) families traced their descent from the Mongols or Tatars, including Veliaminov-Zernov, Godunov, Arseniev, Bakhmetev, [[Bulgakov]] (descendants of Bulgak) and Chaadaev (descendants of Genghis Khan's son [[Chagatai Khan]]). In a survey of Russian noble families of the 17th century, over 15% of the Russian noble families had Tatar or Oriental origins.&lt;ref&gt;Vernadsky, George. (1970). ''The Mongols and Russia.  A History of Russia, Vol. III.'' New Haven: Yale University Press.  The exact origins of the families surveyed were: 229 of Western European (including German) origin, 223 of Polish and Lithuanian origin (this number included [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] nobility), 156 of Tatar and other Oriental origins, 168 families belonged to the [[House of Rurik]] and 42 were of unspecified &quot;Russian&quot; origin.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mongols brought about changes in the economic power of states and overall trade. In the religious sphere, St. Paphnutius of Borovsk was the grandson of a Mongol [[Darughachi|baskak]], or tax collector, while a nephew of [[Khan (title)|Khan]] Bergai of the [[Golden Horde]] converted to Christianity and became known as the monk St. Peter Tsarevich of the Horde.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holytrinityorthodox.com/calendar/los/June/30-02.htm Website of the Orthodox Church calendar, accessed July 6, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; In the judicial sphere, under Mongol influence capital punishment, which during the times of [[Kievan Rus']] had only been applied to slaves, became widespread, and the use of torture became a regular part of criminal procedure. Specific punishments introduced in Moscow included beheading for alleged traitors and branding of thieves (with execution for a third arrest).&lt;ref&gt;Vernadsky, George. (1970). ''The Mongols and Russia.  A History of Russia, Vol. III.'' New Haven: Yale University Press. pp. 354-357&lt;/ref&gt;

The department is located in the [[Regions of France|region]] of [[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]] between the [[Loire Valley]] and the [[Pyrenees]] and is named after the river [[Dordogne (river)|Dordogne]] that runs through it. It corresponds roughly with the ancient county of [[Périgord]]. It had a population of 416,909 in 2013.

It was originally home to four tribes. The name for &quot;four tribes&quot; in the Gaulish language was &quot;Petrocore&quot;. The area eventually became known as the county of Le Périgord and its inhabitants became known as the Périgordins (or Périgourdins). There are four Périgords in the Dordogne.
* The &quot;Périgord Vert&quot; (Green Périgord), with its main town of [[Nontron]], consists of verdant valleys in a region crossed by many rivers and streams;.
* The &quot;Périgord Blanc&quot; (White Périgord), situated around the department's capital of [[Périgueux]], is a region of limestone plateaux, wide valleys, and meadows.
* The &quot;Périgord Pourpre&quot; (Purple Périgord) with its capital of [[Bergerac, Dordogne|Bergerac]], is a wine region.
* The &quot;Périgord Noir&quot; (Black Périgord) surrounding the administrative center of [[Sarlat]], overlooks the valleys of the [[Vézère]] and the Dordogne, where the woods of oak and pine give it its name.

The Petrocores took part in the resistance against Rome. Concentrated in a few major sites are the vestiges of the Gallo-Roman period-–the gigantic ruined tower and arenas in Périgueux (formerly Vesone), the Périgord museum's archaeological collections, villa remains in [[Montcaret]], and the Roman tower of La Rigale Castle in [[Villetoureix]]. The earliest cluzeaux (artificial caves either above or below ground) can be found throughout the Dordogne. These subterranean refuges and lookout huts were large enough to shelter entire local populations. According to [[Julius Caesar]], the [[Gauls]] took refuge in these caves during the resistance.

After [[Guienne]] province was transferred to the English Crown under the [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenets]] following the remarriage of [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] in 1152, Périgord passed by right to English suzerainty. Being situated at the boundaries of influence of the monarchies of France and England, it oscillated between the two dynasties for more than three hundred years of struggle until the end of the [[Hundred Years' War]] in 1453.  The county had been torn apart and, as a consequence, that modeled its physiognomy.

During the calmer periods of the late 15th and early 16th centuries, the Castillon plain on the banks of the Dordogne saw a development in urban architecture. The finest Gothic and Renaissance residences were built in Périgueux, Bergerac, and Sarlat. In the countryside, the nobility erected the majority of the more than 1200 chateaux, manors and country houses. In the second half of the 16th century, however, the terrors of war again visited the area, as the attacks, pillaging, and fires of the Wars of Religion reached a rare degree of violence in Périgord. At the time, [[Bergerac, Dordogne|Bergerac]] was one of the most powerful Huguenot strongholds, along with [[La Rochelle]]. Following these wars, Périgord, fief of Henry of Navarre, was to return to the Crown for good and would continue to suffer from the sudden political changes of the French nation, from the Revolution to the tragic hours of the Resistance.

We also encounter the memory of the region's most important literary figures: [[Arnaut Daniel]], [[Bertran de Born]], [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[Étienne de La Boétie]], [[Pierre de Bourdeille, seigneur de Brantôme|Brantôme]], [[Fenelon]], [[Maine de Biran]], Eugene Le Roy, and [[André Maurois]]; its great captains: [[Talleyrand]], [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry|Saint-Exupery]], [[Armand de Gontaut, baron de Biron|Biron]]; and even entertainer and activist [[Josephine Baker]]. A number of ruins (La Chapelle-Faucher, I'Herm) have retained the memory of the tragedies that took place within their walls. Several of the castles and châteaux are open to visitors; some of them, such as Bourdeilles and Mareuil, house noteworthy collections.

In addition to its castles, chateaux, churches, bastides, and cave fortresses, the Périgord region has preserved since centuries past a number of villages that still have their market halls, dovecotes, bories (stone huts)[https://web.archive.org/web/20160727063109/http://www.arachnis.asso.fr/dordogne/histoire/dordogne/borie0.htm], churches, abbeys, and castles. [[Saint-Léon-sur-Vézère]], [[Connezac]], [[Saint-Jean-de-Côle]], [[La Roque-Gageac]], and many others contain important and visually interesting architectural examples. The old quarters of Périgueux or Bergerac have been restored and developed into pedestrian areas. A number of small towns, such as [[Brantôme, Dordogne|Brantôme]], [[Issigeac]], [[Eymet]] and [[Mareuil, Dordogne|Mareuil]], have withstood the changes of modern times. A special mention should be made in this respect to [[Sarlat]] and its Black Périgord area.

Dordogne is one of the original 83 departments created on 4 March 1790 during the [[French Revolution]]. It was created from the [[Provinces of France|former province]] of [[Périgord]], the [[county of Périgord]]. Its borders continued to change over subsequent decades.

:In 1793 the communes of [[Boisseuilh]], [[Coubjours]], [[Génis]], [[Payzac, Dordogne|Payzac]], [[Saint-Cyr-les-Champagnes]], [[Saint-Mesmin, Dordogne|Saint-Mesmin]], [[Salagnac]], [[Savignac-Lédrier|Savignac]], [[Sainte-Trie|Saint-Trié]] and [[Teillots]] were transferred from [[Corrèze]] to Dordogne.
:In 1794 Dordogne ceded [[Cavarc]] to [[Lot-et-Garonne]]. Later in 1794 (albeit during the subsequent year under the [[French Republican Calendar|Republican Calendar]] in use at the time), Dordogne gained [[Parcoul]] from [[Charente-Maritime|Charente-Inférieure]].
:Following the restoration, in 1819, the commune of Bonrepos was suppressed and merged with the adjacent commune of [[Souillac, Lot|Souillac]] in [[Lot (department)|Lot]].
In 1870, shortly after France fought against [[Prussia]] in [[Franco-Prussian War|a war]] that the enemy was winning, a young aristocrat called Alain de Monéys was savagely tortured and then burned by a crowd of between 300 and 800 people for two hours on 16 August in a public square in the village of [[Hautefaye]] in the north-west of the department. Details of the incident remain unclear: the leading participants appear to have been drunk, and before the introduction of mass education most of the witnesses would have been unable (and possibly unwilling) to write down what they saw. But at some stage the victim died, and following a trial four individuals identified as culpable were in turn condemned to die by guillotine. The sentence was carried out in the same public square on 13 February 1885.

It was suggested that the victim had reported the (bad) news of the war in a way that implied support for the enemy, although subsequently it became clear that his patriotic credentials were beyond reproach. It was also suggested that the mob had been antagonized when he called out, &quot;Vive la République!&quot; (Long live the republic) at a time when the patriotic villagers valued the [[Second French Empire|imperial regime]], which Parisian revolutionaries were in the process of destroying.

The incident was widely reported at the time and has since been extensively researched. This summary relies on the work of Alain Corbin,&lt;ref&gt;Corbin Alain, Le village des &quot;cannibales&quot;, Paris, Aubier, 1990, 204 p.&lt;/ref&gt; a modern historian specializing in the 19th century who analysed the incident and the mass psychology behind it.

==Geography==
The department is part of the [[Regions of France|region]] of [[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]] and is surrounded by the six départements of [[Haute-Vienne]], [[Corrèze]], [[Lot (department)|Lot]], [[Lot-et-Garonne]], [[Gironde]], and [[Charente]]. Dordogne is the third-largest department of metropolitan France.

==Politics==

The President of the General Council is [[Germinal Peiro]] of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]].

==Demographics==
The population peaked at 505,789 in 1851 according to that year's census. After 150 years of steady decline it fell below 400,000 by the year 2000. This reflected the long term population decline observed in many of the rural departments resulting from changes in agriculture and the lure of higher industrial wages available in more urbanized regions. However, during the first decade of the 21st century, the decline has been reversed.

Dordogne has a thriving [[British people|British]] immigrant community. The region counts between 5,000 and 10,000 British residents and 800 British entrepreneurs, drawn by a laid-back lifestyle, warm climate, and lower cost of living. The village of [[Eymet]] is at the heart of the trend, with 200 British families among 2,600 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expatica.com/fr/news/features/From-Dordogneshire-to-Normandy-Brits-race-for-French-office_170691.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The famous caves of [[Lascaux]] have been closed to the public, but a replica of Lascaux II is open to visitors and is a major tourist attraction. Périgueux has important [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ruins, including an arena which is still visible inside a public park located near the town centre.

Dordogne is particularly popular with Britons and other foreigners, as a location for second homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dare Hall |first1=Zoe |title=Why Dordogne property seduces British buyers |url=https://www.ft.com/content/e4626af2-8388-11e9-a7f0-77d3101896ec |work=Financial Times |date=5 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''[[Straw man (dummy)|straw-man]] (or straw-dog) proposal''' is a [[Brainstorming|brainstormed]] simple [[Draft document|draft]] proposal intended to generate discussion of its disadvantages and to provoke the generation of new and better proposals. The term is considered American [[business jargon]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Folsom2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=W. Davis Folsom|title=Understanding American Business Jargon: A Dictionary|url=https://archive.org/details/understandingame00wdav|url-access=registration|year=2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33450-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/understandingame00wdav/page/293 293]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is also encountered in engineering office culture.

Often, a straw man document will be prepared by one or two people prior to kicking off a larger project. In this way, the team can jump start their discussions with a document that is likely to contain many, but not all, of the key aspects to be discussed. As the document is revised, it may be given other edition names such as the more solid-sounding &quot;stone-man&quot;, &quot;iron-man&quot;, and so on.

==Origins==
The expression was already in use in the [[United States Department of Defense]] circa 1975 in their Large Organization Model Building paradigm (LOMB) and was apparently in use with this meaning (initial proposal) in the [[United States Air Force]] before that.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lucas1981&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry C. Lucas|title=Implementation: The Key to Successful Information Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywIsKo4W3DwC&amp;pg=PA94|year=1981|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-04434-9|pages=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The succession of names comes from the requirements document for the programming language [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]]. In the High Order Language Working Group (HOLWG) the process to define Ada generated requirements documents sporting different names, representing the various stages of development of the Ada language,&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.adaic.com/pol-hist/history/holwg-93/8.htm#milestones&lt;/ref&gt; as described in 1993 by Col William Whitaker in an article ''ACM SIGPLAN Notices''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ada - The Project, The DoD High Order Language Working Group&quot;, ''ACM SIGPLAN Notices'' Vol. 28, No. 3, March 1993&lt;/ref&gt; They are:

==Software development==
In software development, a crude plan or document may serve as the strawman or starting point in the evolution of a project. The strawman is not expected to be the last word; it is refined until a final model or document is obtained that resolves all issues concerning the scope and nature of the project. In this context, a strawman can take the form of an outline,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchcrm.techtarget.com/definition/strawman|title=What is straw man? - Definition from WhatIs.com|work=SearchCRM|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a set of charts, a presentation, or a paper.

The ‘Straw Man’ also fits in neatly with the concept of iterative design, repeating and re-drafting to improve an initial concept or design. If anything is built, often, it may not end up in the final product. It might be that the decision is to not continue at all, in which case, the ‘Straw Man’ approach may have saved a lot of wasted work in the long run. Or, the final approach may be very different from the first model. Either way, the ‘Straw Man’ will have proven its worth by having re-directed the approach before any significant work is undertaken.&lt;ref name=&quot;Staw Man Model definition&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Straw Man Model|url=http://www.forloop.com.au/IN%20THE%20LOOP/dictionary.html|website=www.forloop.com.au|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20141022231320/http://www.forloop.com.au/IN%20THE%20LOOP/dictionary.html|archive-date=2014-10-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

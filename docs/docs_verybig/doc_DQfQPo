== Arrangements on stage ==
[[File:Choir-layout.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|One possible layout]]
[[File:Diakonie-kantorei.jpg|thumb|Choir in front of the orchestra]]
There are various schools of thought regarding how the various sections should be arranged on stage. It is the conductor's decision on where the different voice types are placed. In symphonic choirs it is common (though by no means universal) to order the choir behind the orchestra from highest to lowest voices from left to right, corresponding to the typical string layout. In ''a cappella'' or piano-accompanied situations it is not unusual for the men to be in the back and the women in front; some conductors prefer to place the basses behind the sopranos, arguing that the outer voices need to tune to each other.

More experienced choirs may sing with the voices all mixed. Sometimes singers of the same voice are grouped in pairs or threes. Proponents of this method argue that it makes it easier for each individual singer to hear and tune to the other parts, but it requires more independence from each singer. Opponents argue that this method loses the spatial separation of individual voice lines, an otherwise valuable feature for the audience, and that it eliminates sectional resonance, which lessens the effective volume of the chorus. For music with double (or multiple) choirs, usually the members of each choir are together, sometimes significantly separated, especially in performances of 16th-century music (such as works in the [[Venetian polychoral style]]). Some composers actually specify that choirs should be separated, such as in [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''[[War Requiem]]''. Some composers use separated choirs to create &quot;antiphonal&quot; effects, in which one choir seems to &quot;answer&quot; the other choir in a musical dialogue.

Consideration is also given to the spacing of the singers. Studies have found that not only the actual formation, but the amount of space (both laterally and circumambiently) affects the perception of sound by choristers and auditors.&lt;ref&gt;Daugherty, J. &quot;Spacing, Formation, and Choral Sound: Preferences and Perceptions of Auditors and Choristers.&quot; ''[[Journal of Research in Music Education]]''. Vol. 47, Num. 3. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antiquity===

[[File:NAMA Bacchantes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Relief, now in [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens|Athens]], showing [[Dionysus]] with actresses (possibly from ''[[The Bacchae]]'') carrying masks and drums]]

The origins of choral music are found in [[traditional music]], as singing in big groups is extremely widely spread in traditional cultures (both singing in one part, or in [[unison]], like in Ancient Greece, as well as singing in parts, or in [[harmony]], like in contemporary European choral music).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Joseph|last = Jordania|author-link =Joseph Jordania|date= 2011|title =Why do People Sing? Music in Human Evolution|publisher= Logos|isbn = 978-9941401862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest unambiguously choral repertory that survives is that of [[ancient Greece]], of which the 2nd century BC [[Delphic hymns]] and the 2nd century AD. hymns of [[Mesomedes]] are the most complete. The original [[Greek chorus]] sang its part in [[Greek drama]], and fragments of works by [[Euripides]] (''[[Orestes (play)|Orestes]]'') and [[Sophocles]] (''[[Ajax (play)|Ajax]]'') are known from [[papyri]]. The [[Seikilos epitaph]] (2c BC) is a complete song (although possibly for solo voice). One of the latest examples, ''[[Oxyrhynchus hymn]]'' (3c) is also of interest as the earliest [[Christian music]].

Of the [[Music of ancient Rome|Roman]] drama's music [[Flaccus (composer)|a single line]] of [[Terence]] surfaced in the 18c. However, musicologist Thomas J. Mathiesen comments that it is no longer believed to be authentic.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Anderson and Thomas J. Mathiesen. &quot;Terence&quot;, ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', ed. [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (musicologist)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan, 2001), xxv, 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval music===

{{unreferenced section|date=July 2020}}
The earliest notated music of western Europe is [[Gregorian chant]], along with a few other types of chant which were later subsumed (or sometimes suppressed) by the Catholic Church. This tradition of unison choir singing lasted from sometime between the times of [[St. Ambrose]] (4th century) and [[Gregory the Great]] (6th century) up to the present. During the later Middle Ages, a new type of singing involving multiple melodic parts, called [[organum]], became predominant for certain functions, but initially this [[polyphony]] was only sung by soloists. Further developments of this technique included [[Clausula (music)|clausula]]e, [[conductus]] and the [[motet]] (most notably the [[isorhythm]]ic motet), which, unlike the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] motet, describes a composition with different texts sung simultaneously in different voices. The first evidence of polyphony with more than one singer per part comes in the [[Old Hall Manuscript]] (1420, though containing music from the late 14th century), in which there are apparent'' divisi'', one part dividing into two simultaneously sounding notes.

===Renaissance music===
{{Main|Renaissance music}}

[[File:Cantoria luca della robbia22.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Luca della Robbia]]'s ''Cantoria'', ''[[Museo dell'Opera del Duomo (Florence)|Museo dell'Opera del Duomo]]'', Florence]]

During the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]], sacred choral music was the principal type of formally notated music in Western Europe. Throughout the era, hundreds of [[mass (music)|mass]]es and [[motet]]s (as well as various other forms) were composed for [[a cappella]] choir, though there is some dispute over the role of instruments during certain periods and in certain areas. Some of the better-known composers of this time include [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Josquin des Prez]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[John Dunstaple|John Dunstable]], and [[William Byrd]]; the glories of Renaissance [[polyphony]] were choral, sung by choirs of great skill and distinction all over Europe. Choral music from this period continues to be popular with&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/08331 |title=Dunstaple [Dunstable, Dunstapell, Dumstable, Donstaple, etc.], John|last=Bent|first=Margaret |date=1 January 2001|website=Grove Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; many choirs throughout the world today.

The [[madrigal]], a [[partsong]] conceived for amateurs to sing in a [[Chamber choir|chamber]] setting, originated at this period. Although madrigals were initially dramatic settings of unrequited-love poetry or mythological stories in Italy, they were imported into England and merged with the more dancelike [[balletto]], celebrating carefree songs of the seasons, or eating and drinking. To most English speakers, the word ''madrigal'' now refers to the latter, rather than to madrigals proper, which refers to a poetic form of lines consisting of seven and eleven syllables each.

The interaction of sung voices in Renaissance polyphony influenced Western music for centuries. Composers are routinely trained in the &quot;Palestrina style&quot; to this day, especially as codified by the 18c music theorist [[Johann Joseph Fux]]. Composers of the early 20th century also wrote in Renaissance-inspired styles. [[Herbert Howells]] wrote a ''Mass in the Dorian mode'' entirely in strict Renaissance style, and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]'s [[Mass in G minor (Vaughan Williams)|Mass in G minor]] is an extension of this style. [[Anton Webern]] wrote his dissertation on the ''[[Choralis Constantinus]]'' of [[Heinrich Isaac]] and the contrapuntal techniques of his [[serial music]] may be informed by this study.

===Baroque music===
[[File:Soloquartet and strings.jpg|thumb|right|Baroque cantata with one voice per part]]
The [[Baroque music|Baroque period]] in music is associated with the development around 1600 of the ''[[figured bass]]'' and the [[basso continuo]] system. The figured bass part was performed by the basso continuo group, which at minimum included a chord-playing instrument (e.g., [[pipe organ]], [[harpsichord]], [[lute]]) and a bass instrument (e.g., [[violone]]). Baroque vocal music explored dramatic implications in the realm of solo vocal music such as the [[monody|monodies]] of the [[Florentine Camerata]] and the development of early [[opera]]. This innovation was in fact an extension of established practice of accompanying choral music at the organ, either from a skeletal reduced score (from which otherwise lost pieces can sometimes be reconstructed) or from a ''basso seguente'', a part on a single staff containing the lowest sounding part (the bass part).

A new genre was the vocal [[concertato]], combining voices and instruments; its origins may be sought in the [[Venetian polychoral style|polychoral]] music of the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian school]].
[[Claudio Monteverdi]] (1567–1643) brought it to perfection with his [[Vespro della Beata Vergine|Vespers]] and his Eighth Book of Madrigals, which call for great virtuosity on the part of singers and instruments alike. (His Fifth Book includes a ''basso continuo'' &quot;for harpsichord or lute&quot;.) His pupil [[Heinrich Schütz]] (1585–1672) (who had earlier studied with [[Giovanni Gabrieli]]) introduced the new style to Germany. Alongside the new music of the ''[[seconda pratica]]'', contrapuntal motets in the ''[[Prima pratica|stile antico]]'' or old style continued to be written well into the 19th century. Choirs at this time were usually quite small and that singers could be [[vocal weight|classified]] as suited to church or to chamber singing. Monteverdi, himself a singer, is documented as taking part in performances of his Magnificat with one voice per part.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wistreich: [http://em.oxfordjournals.org/content/XXII/1/7.citation &quot;'La voce e grata assai, ma..' Monteverdi on Singing&quot;] in ''[[Early Music (journal)|Early Music]]'', February 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent instrumental accompaniment opened up new possibilities for choral music. [[Anthem|Verse anthem]]s alternated accompanied solos with choral sections; the best-known composers of this genre were [[Orlando Gibbons]] and [[Henry Purcell]]. [[Grands motet]]s (such as those of [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]] and [[Michel-Richard Delalande|Delalande]]) separated these sections into separate movements. [[Oratorio]]s (of which [[Giacomo Carissimi]] was a pioneer) extended this concept into concert-length works, usually based on Biblical or moral stories.

{{listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 44 hallelujah.ogg|title=Hallelujah Chorus|description=The Hallelujah Chorus, from [[George Frideric Handel]]'s [[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]], is one of the most famous choruses of all time}}
A pinnacle of baroque choral music, (particularly oratorio), may be found in [[George Frideric Handel]]'s works, notably ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' and ''[[Israel in Egypt]]''. While the modern chorus of hundreds had to await the growth of Choral Societies and his centennial commemoration concert, we find Handel already using a variety of performing forces, from the soloists of the ''[[Chandos Anthems]]'' to larger groups (whose proportions are still quite different from modern orchestra choruses):

{{quote|Yesterday [Oct. 6] there was a Rehearsal of the [[Coronation Anthems (Handel)|Coronation Anthem]] in [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster-Abby]], set to musick by the famous Mr Hendall: there being 40 voices, and about 160 [[violin family|violins]], [[Trumpet]]s, [[oboe|Hautboys]], [[timpani|Kettle-Drums]] and Bass' proportionable..!|''Norwich Gazette'', October 14, 1727}}

Lutheran composers wrote instrumentally accompanied [[cantata]]s, often based on [[chorale]] [[hymn tune|tunes]]. Substantial late 17th-century sacred choral works in the emerging German tradition exist (the cantatas of [[Dietrich Buxtehude]] being a prime example), though the Lutheran church cantata did not assume its more codified, recognizable form until the early 18th century. [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] (based in Frankfurt) wrote over 1000 cantatas, many of which were engraved and published (e.g. his ''Harmonische Gottesdienst'') and [[Christoph Graupner]] (based in Darmstadt) over 1400. The cantatas of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (1685–1750) are perhaps the most recognizable (and often-performed) contribution to this repertoire: his obituary mentions five complete cycles of [[Bach cantata|his cantata]]s, of which three, comprising some 200 works, are known today, in addition to [[motet]]s. Bach himself rarely used the term cantata. Motet refers to his church music without orchestra accompaniment, but instruments playing [[colla parte]] with the voices. His works with accompaniment consists of his [[Passions (Bach)|Passions]], [[Missa (Bach)|Mass]]es, the [[Magnificat (Bach)|Magnificat]] and the cantatas.

A point of hot controversy today is the so-called &quot;Rifkin hypothesis,&quot; which re-examines the famous &quot;''Entwurff''&quot; Bach's 1730 memo to the [[Leipzig]] City Council (''A Short but Most Necessary Draft for a Well Appointed Church Music'') calling for at least 12 singers. In light of Bach's responsibility to provide music to four churches and be able to perform double choir compositions with a substitute for each voice, [[Joshua Rifkin]] concludes that Bach's music was normally written with [[OVPP|one voice per part]] in mind. A few sets of original performing parts include ''ripieni'' who reinforce rather than slavishly double the vocal quartet.

===Classical and Romantic music===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2020}}
Composers of the late 18th century became fascinated with the new possibilities of the symphony and other instrumental music, and generally neglected choral music. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s mostly sacred choral works stand out as some of his greatest (such as the &quot;Great&quot; Mass in C minor and [[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem]] in D minor, the latter of which is highly regarded). [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] became more interested in choral music near the end of his life following his visits to England in the 1790s, when he heard various Handel oratorios performed by large forces; he wrote a series of masses beginning in 1797 and his two great oratorios ''[[The Creation (Haydn)|The Creation]]'' and ''[[The Seasons (Haydn)|The Seasons]]''. [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] wrote only two masses, both intended for liturgical use, although his ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'' is probably suitable only for the grandest ceremonies due to its length, difficulty and large-scale scoring. He also pioneered the use of chorus as part of symphonic texture with his [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] and [[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasia]].

{{listen|type=music|filename=Johannes Brahms - Op.45 Ein Deutsches Requiem - (04) Wie lieblich sind deine Wohnungen.ogg|title=&quot;Wie lieblich sind deine Wohnungen&quot;|description=(How lovely is thy dwelling place) from ''[[Ein deutsches Requiem]]'' by [[Johannes Brahms]]}}
In the 19th century, sacred music escaped from the church and leaped onto the concert stage, with large sacred works unsuitable for church use, such as [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]'s ''[[Te Deum (Berlioz)|Te Deum]]'' and [[Requiem (Berlioz)|Requiem]], and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]'s ''[[Ein deutsches Requiem]]''. [[Gioacchino Rossini|Rossini]]'s ''Stabat mater'', [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]'s masses, and [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s [[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]] also exploited the grandeur offered by instrumental accompaniment. Oratorios also continued to be written, clearly influenced by Handel's models. Berlioz's ''[[L'enfance du Christ]]'' and [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn's]] ''[[Elijah (oratorio)|Elijah]]'' and ''[[St. Paul (oratorio)|St Paul]]'' are in the category. Schubert, Mendelssohn, and Brahms also wrote secular cantatas, the best known of which are Brahms's ''[[Schicksalslied]]'' and ''[[Nänie]]''.

A few composers developed a cappella music, especially [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]], whose masses and motets startlingly juxtapose Renaissance counterpoint with chromatic harmony. Mendelssohn and Brahms also wrote significant a cappella motets. The amateur chorus (beginning chiefly as a social outlet) began to receive serious consideration as a compositional venue for the part-songs of Schubert, [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], Mendelssohn, Brahms, and others. These 'singing clubs' were often for women or men separately, and the music was typically in four-part (hence the name &quot;[[part-song]]&quot;) and either a cappella or with simple instrumentation. At the same time, the [[Cecilian movement]] attempted a restoration of the pure Renaissance style in Catholic churches.

===20th and 21st centuries===

'''Johanna Schopenhauer''' (née '''Trosiener'''; July 9, 1766 – April 17, 1838) was the first German woman to publish books without a pseudonym, an influential literary salon host, and in the 1820s the most famous female author in Germany. In these days, she is known primarily for being the mother of the philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].

== Biography ==
[[File:Caroline Bardua - Johanna &amp; Adele Schopenhauer (1806).jpg|thumb|right|Johanna Schopenhauer with her daughter Adele in 1806. Painting by [[Caroline Bardua]].]]
Johanna Schopenhauer was born in [[Gdańsk]], the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]], to a family of middle-class merchants of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] extraction; her parents were Christian Heinrich and Elisabeth (b. Lehmann) Trosiener. Her father was also a councilor in the city. She was a precocious girl, sensitive to art and with great talent to learn foreign languages. Before turning 10, she already knew [[Polish language|Polish]], [[French language|French]], and [[English language|English]] apart from her native [[German language|German]].{{sfn|Cartwright|2010|p=7–9}}

The young Johanna had aspirations to become a painter, a desire her parents nipped right at the bud, considering it improper that a girl of her class exercised &quot;a trade.&quot;{{sfn|Diethe|1998|p=48}}

At 18 years of age she married Heinrich Floris Schopenhauer, a much wealthier merchant twenty years her senior. He was to become the father of her two children, Arthur and Adele Schopenhauer, who were born in 1788 and 1797, respectively. In her autobiography, in which Johanna promised to tell the facts of her life &quot;without poetry&quot;,{{sfn|Cartwright|2010|p=458}} Johanna makes clear that she &quot;no more pretended ardent love to him than he demanded it&quot;.{{sfn|Safranski|1990|p=13}} She denies, however, that she came under pressure from her parents to marry Heinrich Floris.{{sfn|Cartwright|2010|p=10}} On the contrary, she subtly admits that what attracted her to a union with him was his social rank and the possibilities that his wealth could open to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl Weissmann|year=1980|page=19|quote=I had not yet turned nineteen and this union waved at me with its formidable promises, better than those to which I would have aspired.|publisher=Itatiaia|language=Portuguese|title=Vida de Schopenhauer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage was stable, but from the beginning Johanna felt that her happiness and that of her husband depended on her resignation to his will.{{sfn|Safranski|1990|p=13–14}}

One year after her husband's death in 1805, Johanna and her daughter moved to [[Weimar]], a town where Johanna had neither relatives nor close friends and which was, moreover, about to be the stage of war between Prussia and the invading troops of [[Napoleon]]. Despite the fact that Johanna did not know of the imminent risk of war, she refused to leave the city when the situation became clear, as transportation was only available to her and her daughter, and her servants would have to be left to their own fate.{{sfn|Cartwright|2010|p=102}}

During the war, Johanna was quite active in providing services to those who were in need, nursing German soldiers and giving asylum to less fortunate citizens, whose houses had been taken over by French soldiers. With that, she quickly became a popular figure in Weimar.

After the war, she gained a high reputation as a [[Salon (gathering)|''salonnière'']] (as she had planned before she left Hamburg),{{sfn|Cartwright|2010|p=98}} and for years to come there attended her semiweekly parties several literary celebrities: [[Christoph Martin Wieland|Wieland]], the Schlegel brothers [[August Schlegel|August]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich]], [[Tieck]], and, above all, [[Goethe]], whose connaissance was probably what attracted Johanna to Weimar in the first place. Goethe's endorsement was a big factor behind Johanna's social success, and it greatly contributed to their friendship the fact that Johanna was the first upper-class woman in Weimar to open the doors of her house to [[Christiane Vulpius]], Goethe's mistress, who had hitherto been excluded from the shining social scene of the city owing not only to her lowly background, but also to the fact that Goethe and Vulpius were no more than lovers, despite living together.{{sfn|Diethe|1998|p=50}}

At first, Arthur Schopenhauer chose to stay in Hamburg. At that moment he had every intention to fulfill a promise made to his father, that of concluding his merchant apprenticeship, however much that pained him and however much he would have preferred to study [[Philosophy]]. Johanna encouraged her son to leave these studies behind and follow his desire to become a scholar.{{sfn|Cartwright|2010|p=33}}

Mother and son, however, did not get along. In letters written to Schopenhauer, Johanna makes it very clear how distressed she was at her son's pessimism, his arrogance, and his imperious ways. (Schopenhauer's own letters to his mother were destroyed by her.) When, in 1809, Schopenhauer finally moved to Weimar, he established himself, not in his mother's house, but in that of his young instructor, [[Franz Passow]], as it was the mother's impression that living under the same roof as her son was a bad idea. In 1813, she finally allowed him to move into her house, renting him a room, but the arrangement was soon broken after frequent arguments; the reason was Johanna's friendship with another lodger, a younger man called Georg von Gerstenbergk.

After 1814, mother and son never met again. All the communication between the two was from then on through letters, but even this was interrupted after Johanna read a correspondence from Schopenhauer to his sister Adele, where he blamed their mother for the death of their father, understood to have been by suicide, accusing her of going to amuse herself at parties while Heinrich Floris was bedridden, sick and abandoned to the care of a loyal employee.{{sfn|Safranski|1990|p=13}} In 1819, however, Schopenhauer made an attempt to approach his family. That year, the Schopenhauer ladies lost most of their fortune in a banking crisis. Schopenhauer volunteered to share with them the inheritance he received from his father, but Johanna refused the offer.

It was only in 1831 that the correspondence between mother and son resumed. It was Schopenhauer who took the first step, motivated, apparently, by his many difficulties: from the failure to sell his books to his bodily ailments. The correspondence continued sporadically until Johanna's death in 1838. Despite the cordial tone of the last communications between Johanna and Arthur, the latter continued to speak ill of her even after her death, making little of Johanna's mother skills and painting her as a thoroughly self-centered woman. For her part, in her will Johanna made Adele her sole heir. But this was probably motivated, not so much to slight the son, but in recognition that the daughter would be in greater difficulties in future years, since Schopenhauer not only managed to conserve his part of the fatherly inheritance but even doubled it, whereas Adele would have few resources at her disposal, something in which the spendthrift Johanna had no small role.

In Weimar Johanna Schopenhauer made a name as an author. She was the first German woman to publish books without a pseudonym, and from the late 1810s to the early 1830s, her works turned her into the most famous female author in Germany. In 1831, her books received a second edition, and the collection filled no less than 24 volumes. Despite all this production, her critical acclaim and commercial success, Johanna was never able to make up for the financial losses of the 1810s. Unable to maintain their lifestyle in Weimar, and also for health reasons, Johanna and Adele moved to [[Bonn]]. In the mid-1830s, Johanna's fame declined and their financial situation worsened. Almost without resources, Johanna wrote to the Duke of Weimar detailing her plight. In 1837 the Duke, in recognition of Johanna's fame and contributions to the city's culture, offered her a small pension and invited her to move to [[Jena]]. There, Johanna died the following year. She left incomplete the manuscript of a last work, her autobiography, which narrates her early life until shortly after Arthur's birth.

Not long after her arrival in Weimar Johanna began to publish her writings, consisting of articles on paintings with special attention on [[Jan van Eyck]]'s work. In 1810, she published her first book: a biography of her friend [[Karl Ludwig Fernow]], who had died two years before. She wrote the book with the generous intention to pay Fernow's heirs' debts with his editor. The work met with critical success, which encouraged Johanna to pursue a career as an author, on which her livelihood and that of Adele would depend after the aforementioned financial crisis. First came the publication of her [[Travel literature|travelogue]]s. Prior to Heinrich Floris' death, the family made trips through [[Western Europe]], mostly in order to help Arthur, then a teenager, develop the skills of a merchant. But the trips were also of great use to Johanna, serving as raw material for her travelogues, which were very successful at the time they were published, decades later. (In 1990, her travelogue to [[England]] and [[Scotland]] was translated into English by [[Chapman &amp; Hall]] — Johanna's only book to be introduced to the Anglophone world since the turn to the 20th century.) Then came her fiction work, which, for a little more than a decade, turned her into the most famous woman author in Germany. The following are her best known novels: ''Gabriele'' (1819), ''Die Tante'' (1823) and ''Sidonia'' (1827).

Friendship books that require entrants to make drawings, use stickers or magazine photographs are known as &quot;deco&quot; friendship books or just simply &quot;decos&quot;.  Typically, each entrant in the &quot;deco&quot; must use one full page to express themselves.  Glitter, sequins, feathers and other scrapbooking supplies are frequently used in &quot;decos.&quot;  Despite the artistic expressions used in these types of friendship books, the basic rules of passing the friendship book to person to person is the same.

When a 'friendship book' is only one page (no staples), it's called a 'friendship sheet.'  If the page is small, like the size of a postcard, or smaller, it's called a 'cram.'  Friendship books that have a musical theme, where you have to add lyrics to your entry, are called &quot;lyrix&quot; or &quot;lyrics sheets&quot;.

==Slams==
Slams are friendship books that include a theme of questions, either &quot;Sign if you did/like the following&quot;, &quot;What is your favorite&quot; or other similar questions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Löbert&quot;/&gt;  These usually include one page as a &quot;sign in&quot;, several pages of questions, and then a &quot;sign out&quot; or &quot;shout out&quot; page at the end. 
Slams can be themed or regular.  Typically they are small like a standard friendship book.  Often they have a &quot;sign-in&quot; page where you put your label or name, then each page will often contain a question which you answer (i.e. When was the last time you said &quot;I love you&quot;) and the signer would write the appropriate response.  At the end there is often a sign-out page as well where it's dated.  Slams have many variations and can be &quot;sign if&quot; slams (you sign only if the statement or question applies to you).  These are handled in a number of ways, but most of them become more clear when you have it in-hand.

==Crams==
Crams are like friendship sheets or book, but no one includes any personal information.  The idea (as the name implies) is to &quot;cram&quot; as many names and addresses into the provided space.&lt;ref name=&quot;Löbert&quot;/&gt;

==Friendship sheet==
As the name implies, friendship sheets are nearly the same as friendship books, but they are made on a single sheet of paper or stationery.

==Deco==
Decos are similar to FBs, but are often larger in size.   The cover is often decorated with interesting materials like magazine pictures, rubber stamps, decorative papers, and other embellishments.  Each person who signs decorates a full page in the book.  Sometimes the book has a theme, for example cats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Löbert&quot;/&gt;  Then, each person decorates their page following the theme.  As with FBs, when these are full, they are sent home to the person for whom the book was made.

==Lyrix==
Lyrix are much like decos except that each page is decorated using lyrics from a song.  Some are more plain with the words simply written in them, others are as artistic as decos with pictures and other ornamental adornments.

==Quotes==
Quotes are like Lyrics, but instead of song lyrics they contain quotes from movies. These can also be themed, such as Brad Pitt movie quotes. Quotes can be plain text or decorative.

{{financial markets}}

In [[finance]], a '''high-yield bond''' ('''non-investment-grade bond''', '''speculative-grade bond''', or '''junk bond''') is a [[Bond (finance)|bond]] that is rated below [[investment grade]]. These bonds have a higher risk of [[default (finance)|default]] or other adverse [[credit event]]s, but offer higher [[Yield (finance)|yield]]s than better quality bonds in order to make them attractive to investors.

==Risk==
The holder of any debt is subject to [[interest rate risk]] and [[credit risk]], inflationary risk, currency risk, duration risk, [[Convexity (finance)|convexity risk]], repayment of principal risk, streaming income risk, [[liquidity risk]], default risk, maturity risk, reinvestment risk, market risk, political risk, and taxation adjustment risk. Interest rate risk refers to the risk of the market value of a bond changing due to changes in the structure or level of interest rates or credit spreads or risk premiums. The credit risk of a high-yield bond refers to the probability and probable loss upon a credit event (i.e., the obligor defaults on scheduled payments or files for bankruptcy, or the bond is restructured), or a credit quality change is issued by a rating agency including [[Fitch ratings|Fitch]], [[Moody's Investors Service|Moody's]], or [[S&amp;P Global Ratings|Standard &amp; Poors]].

A [[credit rating agency]] attempts to describe the risk with a [[credit rating]] such as AAA. In [[North America]], the five major agencies are [[Standard &amp; Poor's]], [[Moody's]], [[Fitch Ratings]], [[Dominion Bond Rating Service]] and [[A.M. Best]]. Bonds in other countries may be rated by US rating agencies or by local credit rating agencies. Rating scales vary; the most popular scale uses (in order of increasing risk) ratings of AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, CCC, CC, C, with the additional rating D for debt already in [[arrears]]. [[Government bond]]s and bonds issued by [[government-sponsored enterprise]]s (GSEs) are often considered to be in a zero-risk category above AAA; and categories like AA and A may sometimes be split into finer subdivisions like &quot;AA−&quot; or &quot;AA+&quot;.

Bonds rated BBB− and higher are called [[investment grade]] bonds. Bonds rated lower than investment grade on their date of issue are called speculative grade bonds, or colloquially as &quot;junk&quot; bonds.

The lower-rated debt typically offers a higher yield, making speculative bonds attractive investment vehicles for certain types of [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolios]] and strategies. Many [[pension fund]]s and other investors (banks, insurance companies), however, are prohibited in their [[by-law]]s from investing in bonds which have ratings below a particular level. As a result, the lower-rated securities have a different investor base than investment-grade bonds.

The value of speculative bonds is affected to a higher degree than [[investment grade bond]]s by the possibility of [[default (finance)|default]]. For example, in a [[recession]] interest rates may drop, and the drop in interest rates tends to increase the value of investment grade bonds; however, a recession tends to increase the possibility of default in speculative-grade bonds.

==Usage==
=== Corporate debt ===
The original speculative grade bonds were bonds that once had been investment grade at time of issue, but where the credit rating of the issuer had slipped and the possibility of default increased significantly. These bonds are called &quot;fallen angels&quot;.

The [[investment banker]] [[Michael Milken]] realized that fallen angels had regularly been valued less than what they were worth. His time with speculative grade bonds started with his investment in these. Only later did he and other investment bankers at [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]], followed by those of competing firms, begin organizing the issue of bonds that were speculative grade from the start. Speculative grade bonds thus became ubiquitous in the 1980s as a financing mechanism in [[mergers and acquisitions]]. In a [[leveraged buyout]] (LBO), an acquirer would issue speculative grade bonds to help pay for an acquisition and then use the target's [[cash flow]] to help pay the debt over time.

In 2005, over 80% of the principal amount of high-yield debt issued by U.S. companies went toward corporate purposes rather than acquisitions or buyouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.jpost.com/Business/Commentary/Need-more-retirement-income-Look-at-high-yield-bonds |title= Need more retirement income? Look at high yield bonds |author=Aaron Katsman|newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date = June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In emerging markets, such as China and Vietnam, bonds have become increasingly important as term financing options, since access to traditional bank credits has always been proved to be limited, especially if borrowers are non-state corporates. The corporate bond market has been developing in line with the general trend of capital market, and equity market in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vietnamica.net/op/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/VuongTran.JEPR_.Vol6_.No1_.2011.pdf |title= Vietnam's corporate bond market, 1990–2010: Some reflections |publisher= The Journal of Economic Policy and Research, 6(1): 1–47 |date=March 15, 2011 |accessdate= November 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Debt repackaging and subprime crisis ===
High-yield bonds can also be repackaged into [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDO), thereby raising the [[credit rating]] of the senior [[tranche]]s above the rating of the original debt. The senior tranches of high-yield CDOs can thus meet the minimum credit rating requirements of pension funds and other institutional investors despite the significant risk in the original high-yield debt.
[[Image:Lehman Brothers Times Square by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|The New York City headquarters of Barclays (formerly Lehman Brothers, as shown in the picture). In background, the [[AXA Center]], headquarters of [[AXA]], first worldwide insurance company.]]
When such CDOs are backed by assets of dubious value, such as [[subprime mortgage]] loans, and lose [[market liquidity]], the bonds and their derivatives become what is referred to as &quot;toxic debt&quot;. Holding such &quot;toxic&quot; assets led to the demise of several [[investment bank]]s such as [[Lehman Brothers]] and other financial institutions during the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] of 2007–09 and led the US Treasury to seek congressional appropriations to buy those assets in September 2008 to prevent a systemic crisis of the banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/6173145/The-collapse-of-Lehman-Brothers.html|title= The collapse of Lehman Brothers|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate= August 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such assets represent a serious problem for purchasers because of their complexity. Having been repackaged perhaps several times, it is difficult and time-consuming for [[auditor]]s and [[accountant]]s to determine their true value. As the [[recession]] of 2008–09 hit, their value decreased further as more debtors defaulted, so they represented a rapidly [[depreciating asset]]. Even those assets that might have gone up in value in the long-term depreciated rapidly, quickly becoming &quot;toxic&quot; for the banks that held them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketplace.publicradio.org/videos/whiteboard/toxic_assets.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120711085336/http://marketplace.publicradio.org/videos/whiteboard/toxic_assets.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-11 |title=Marketplace Whiteboard: Toxic assets |publisher=[[Marketplace]] |accessdate=2009-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toxic asset]]s, by increasing the variance of banks' assets, can turn otherwise healthy institutions into [[Zombie bank|zombies]]. Potentially insolvent banks made too few good loans creating a [[debt overhang]] problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=1336288 |title=Debt Overhang and Bank Bailouts|publisher=SSRN |date=February 2, 2009|last1=Wilson|first1=Linus|doi=10.2139/ssrn.1336288 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, potentially insolvent banks with toxic assets sought out very risky speculative loans to shift risk onto their depositors and other creditors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=Linus |last2=Wu |first2=Yan Wendy |title=Common (stock) sense about risk-shifting and bank bailouts |journal=Financial Markets and Portfolio Management |date=2010 |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=3–29 |doi=10.1007/s11408-009-0125-y|ssrn=1321666 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 23, 2009, U.S. Treasury Secretary [[Timothy Geithner]] announced a [[Public–private partnership|Public-Private Investment Partnership]] (PPIP) to buy toxic assets from banks' balance sheets. The major stock market indices in the United States rallied on the day of the announcement rising by over six percent with the shares of bank stocks leading the way.&lt;ref name='Edmund L. Andrews and Eric Dash'&gt;
{{cite news | title= U.S. Expands Plan to Buy Banks’ Troubled Assets | date= March 24, 2009 | newspaper= New York Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/24/business/economy/24bailout.html | accessdate = February 12, 2009 | first1=Edmund L. | last1=Andrews | first2=Eric | last2=Dash}}&lt;/ref&gt; PPIP has two primary programs. The Legacy Loans Program will attempt to buy residential loans from banks' balance sheets. The [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] will provide non-recourse loan guarantees for up to 85 percent of the purchase price of legacy loans. Private sector asset managers and the U.S. Treasury will provide the remaining assets. The second program is called the legacy securities program which will buy mortgage backed securities (RMBS) that were originally rated AAA and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and asset-backed securities (ABS) which are rated AAA. The funds will come in many instances in equal parts from the U.S. Treasury's [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] monies, private investors, and from loans from the Federal Reserve's [[Term Asset Lending Facility]] (TALF). The initial size of the Public Private Investment Partnership is projected to be $500 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/reports/ppip_fact_sheet.pdf |title=FACT SHEET PUBLIC-PRIVATE INVESTMENT PROGRAM |publisher=U.S. Treasury |date=March 23, 2009 |accessdate=March 26, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324012024/http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/reports/ppip_fact_sheet.pdf |archive-date=March 24, 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel Prize–winning economist [[Paul Krugman]] has been very critical of this program arguing the non-recourse loans lead to a hidden subsidy that will be split by asset managers, banks' shareholders and creditors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Paul Krugman|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/23/geithner-plan-arithmetic/ |title=Geithner plan arithmetic|newspaper=New York Times |date=March 23, 2009 |accessdate=March 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banking analyst [[Meredith Whitney]] argues that banks will not sell bad assets at fair market values because they are reluctant to take asset write downs.&lt;ref name='John Carney'&gt;
{{cite news | title= Meredith Whitney: A Bad Bank Won't Save Banks | date= January 29, 2009 | publisher= businessinsider.com | url = http://www.businessinsider.com/2009/1/meredith-whitney-a-bad-bank-wont-save-us | accessdate = March 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Removing toxic assets would also reduce the volatility of banks' stock prices. Because stock is akin to a [[call option]] on a firm's assets, this lost [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] will hurt the stock price of distressed banks. Therefore, such banks will only sell toxic assets at above market prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=Linus |title=The put problem with buying toxic assets |journal=Applied Financial Economics |date=January 2010 |volume=20 |issue=1–2 |pages=31–35 |doi=10.1080/09603100903262954|ssrn=1343625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==High-yield bond indices==
{{See also|Bond market index}}
High-yield [[bond market index|bond indices]] exist for dedicated investors in the market. Indices for the broad high-yield market include the [[S&amp;P U.S. Issued High Yield Corporate Bond Index]] ([[SPUSCHY]]), [[CSFB High Yield II Index]] (CSHY), Citigroup US High-Yield Market Index, the [[Merrill Lynch High Yield Master II]] (H0A0), the Barclays High Yield Index, and the Bear Stearns High Yield Index (BSIX). Some investors, preferring to dedicate themselves to higher-rated and less-risky investments, use an index that only includes BB-rated and B-rated securities, such as the Merrill Lynch Global High Yield BB-B Rated Index (HW40). Other investors focus on the lowest quality debt rated CCC or [[distressed securities]], commonly defined as those yielding 1500 [[basis point]]s over equivalent government bonds.

==EU member state debt crisis==
{{See also|European sovereign debt crisis}}

On 27 April 2010, the [[Economy of Greece#2010 debt crisis|Greek debt]] rating was decreased to &quot;junk&quot; status by [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] amidst fears of default by the [[Greek Government]].&lt;ref name=nyt04282010&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/business/global/28drachma.html |first1=Jack |last1=Ewing |first2=Jack |last2=Healy|title=Greek Debt Rating cut to Junk Status |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 27, 2010 |access-date= October 15, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also cut [[Portugal]]'s [[credit rating]]s by two notches to A, over concerns about its [[state debt]] and [[public finance]]s on 28 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8648029.stm | work=BBC News | title=Fears grow over Greece shockwaves | date=April 28, 2010 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 5 July 2011, Portugal's rating was decreased to &quot;junk&quot; status by [[Moody's]] (by four notches from Baa1 to Ba2) saying there was a growing risk the country would need a second bail-out before it was ready to borrow money from financial markets again, and private lenders might have to contribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|

On 13 July 2012, Moody's cut Italy's credit rating two notches, to Baa2 (leaving it just above junk). Moody's warned the country it could be cut further.

With the ongoing [[deleveraging]] process within the European banking system, many European CFOs are still issuing high-yield bonds. As a result, by the end of September 2012, the total amount of annual primary bond issuances stood at {{€|50 billion|link=yes}}. It is assumed that high-yield bonds are still attractive for companies with a stable funding base, although the ratings have declined continuously for most of those bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cfo-insight.com/financing-liquidity/loans-and-bonds/fitch-high-yields-to-remain-good-alternative-in-europe/ |title=Fitch: High-Yields to Remain Good Alternative in Europe |work=CFO Insight Fitch|date=December 12, 2012 |access-date=12 December 2012 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|fix-attempted=yes|date=October 2020}}

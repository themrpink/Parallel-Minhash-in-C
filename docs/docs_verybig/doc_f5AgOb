===Acting president pro tempore===
While the president pro tempore does have other official duties, the holders of the office have, like the vice president, over time ceased presiding over the Senate on a daily basis, owing to the mundane and ceremonial nature of the position.&lt;ref name=&quot;gp&quot; /&gt; Furthermore, as the president pro tempore is now usually the most senior senator of the majority party, he most likely also chairs a major Senate committee and has other significant demands on his time. Therefore, the president pro tempore has less time now than in the past to preside daily over the Senate. Instead, junior senators from the majority party are designated acting president pro tempore to preside over the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gold |first1=Martin B. |last2=Gupta |first2=Dimple |title=The Constitutional Option to Change Senate Rules and Procedures: A Majoritarian Means to Over Come the Filibuster* |journal=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy |volume=28 |issue=1 |page=211 |url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlpp/Gold_Gupta_JLPP_article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows junior senators to learn proper parliamentary procedure.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn&quot; /&gt;  The acting president pro tempore is usually reappointed daily by the president pro tempore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=RuleI|title=APPOINTMENT OF A SENATOR TO THE CHAIR - Rules of the Senate - United States Senate Committee on Rules and Administration|publisher=|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202190455/http://www.rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=RuleI|archivedate=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Permanent acting president pro tempore====
In June 1963, because of the illness of president pro tempore [[Carl Hayden]], Senator [[Lee Metcalf]] was designated permanent acting president pro tempore. No term was imposed on this designation, so Metcalf retained it until he died in office in 1978.&lt;ref name=&quot;HAO&quot; /&gt;

===Deputy president pro tempore===
[[File:Hubert Humphrey crop.jpg|thumb|upright=0.80|[[Hubert Humphrey]] (D-[[List of United States senators from Minnesota|Minnesota]]) was the first Deputy President pro tempore in 1977–1978]]

The ceremonial post of deputy president pro tempore was created for [[Hubert Humphrey]], a former vice president, in 1977 following his losing bid to become the [[United States Senate Majority Leader|Senate majority leader]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virtualology.com/hallofusa/usvicepresidents/HUBERTHHUMPHREY.COM/ |title=Hubert H. Humphrey |year=2000 |work=virtualology.com |publisher=Evisum Inc. |accessdate=December 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate resolution creating the position stated that any former president or former vice president serving in the Senate would be entitled to this position. However, since Humphrey, none have served.&lt;ref name=&quot;HAO&quot; /&gt;

[[George J. Mitchell]] was elected deputy president pro tempore in 1987, because of the illness of president pro tempore [[John C. Stennis]], similar to Metcalf's earlier designation as permanent acting president pro tempore. The office has remained vacant since 1989 and no senator other than Humphrey and Mitchell has held it since its creation.&lt;ref name=&quot;HAO&quot; /&gt; Mitchell is the only person to have served as deputy president pro tempore who was neither a former president nor former vice president of the United States.

The post is largely honorary and ceremonial, but comes with a salary increase. By statute, the compensation granted to the position holder equals the rate of annual compensation paid to the president pro tempore, majority leader, and [[Senate Minority Leader|minority leader]]. (See {{UnitedStatesCode|2|6112}}.)&lt;ref name=&quot;HAO&quot; /&gt;

===President pro tempore emeritus===
[[File:Leahy2009.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.80|[[Patrick Leahy]] (D-[[List of United States senators from Vermont|Vermont]]), former president pro tempore, and current president pro tempore emeritus]]

Since 2001, the honorary title of president pro tempore [[emeritus]] has been given to a senator of the minority party who has previously served as president pro tempore. The position has been held by [[Strom Thurmond]] (R-[[List of United States senators from South Carolina|South Carolina]]) (2001–2003), [[Robert Byrd]] (D-[[List of United States senators from West Virginia|West Virginia]]) (2003–2007), [[Ted Stevens]] (R-[[List of United States senators from Alaska|Alaska]]) (2007–2009) and [[Patrick Leahy]] (D-[[List of United States senators from Vermont|Vermont]]) (2015–present).  From 2009 to 2015, no senator met the requirements for the position.

The position was created for Thurmond when the Democratic Party regained a majority in the Senate in June 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|107|SRes|103}}, adopted, June 6, 2001. &quot;Thanking and Electing Strom Thurmond President pro tempore emeritus.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; With the change in party control, Democrat [[Robert Byrd]] of [[List of United States senators from West Virginia|West Virginia]] replaced Thurmond as president pro tempore, reclaiming a position he had previously held from 1989 to 1995 and briefly in January 2001. Thurmond's retirement from the Senate on January 3, 2003, coincided with a change from Democratic to Republican control, making Stevens president pro tempore and Byrd the second president pro tempore emeritus. Byrd returned as president pro tempore, and Stevens became the third president pro tempore emeritus, when the Democrats gained control of the Senate in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;HAO&quot; /&gt; While a president pro tempore emeritus has no official duties, he is entitled to an increase in staff&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|2|6115}}, amended 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and advises party leaders on the functions of the Senate.

The office's accompanying budget increase was removed toward the end of the [[113th Congress]], shortly before Patrick Leahy was to become the first holder of the title in six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lesniewski|first1=Niels|title=Leahy: 'Kind of Petty' Not to Fund Emeritus Office in 'Cromnibus{{'-}}|url=http://blogs.rollcall.com/wgdb/leahy-kind-of-petty-not-to-fund-emeritus-office-cromnibus/|accessdate=January 7, 2015|work=[[CQ Roll Call]]|date=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Salary==
The salary of the president pro tempore for 2012 was $193,400, equal to that of the majority leaders and minority leaders of both houses of Congress. If there is a vacancy in the office of vice president, then the salary would be the same as that of the vice president, $230,700.&lt;ref name=&quot;HAO&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Bayes' Theorem MMB 01.jpg|thumb|A blue neon sign showing the simple statement of Bayes's theorem]]
{{Bayesian statistics}}

In [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], '''Bayes' theorem''' (alternatively '''Bayes' law''' or '''Bayes' rule'''), named after Reverend [[Thomas Bayes]], describes the [[probability]] of an [[event (probability theory)|event]], based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Joyce|first=James|title=Bayes' Theorem|date=2003|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2019/entries/bayes-theorem/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2019|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2020-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if the risk of developing health problems is known to increase with age, Bayes' theorem allows the risk to an individual of a known age to be assessed more accurately (by conditioning it on his age) than simply assuming that the individual is typical of the population as a whole.

One of the many applications of Bayes' theorem is [[Bayesian inference]], a particular approach to [[statistical inference]]. When applied, the probabilities involved in the theorem may have different [[probability interpretation]]s. With [[Bayesian probability]] interpretation, the theorem expresses how a degree of belief, expressed as a probability, should rationally change to account for the availability of related evidence. Bayesian inference is fundamental to [[Bayesian statistics]].

==Statement of theorem==
Bayes' theorem is stated mathematically as the following equation:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1= A. | last1= Stuart | first2= K. | last2= Ord | title= Kendall's Advanced Theory of Statistics: Volume I—Distribution Theory | year= 1994 | publisher= [[Edward Arnold (publisher)|Edward Arnold]] | at= §8.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Equation box 1
|indent =
|title=
|equation = &lt;math&gt;P(A\mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) P(A)}{P(B)}&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are [[Event (probability theory)|events]] and &lt;math&gt;P(B) \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;.

* &lt;math&gt;P(A\mid B)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[conditional probability]]: the likelihood of event &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; occurring given that &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is true.
* &lt;math&gt;P(B\mid A)&lt;/math&gt; is also a conditional probability: the likelihood of event &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; occurring given that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is true.
* &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P(B)&lt;/math&gt; are the probabilities of observing &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; respectively; they are known as the [[marginal probability]].
* A and B must be different events.

==Examples==
===Drug testing===
[[File:Bayes-rule3.png|thumb|right|Figure 1: Using a frequency box to show &lt;math&gt;P(\text{User}\mid \text{Positive}) &lt;/math&gt; visually by comparison of areas ]]
Suppose, a particular test for whether someone has been using cannabis is 90% [[Sensitivity (tests)|sensitive]], meaning the [[true positive rate]] (TPR)=0.90.  Therefore it leads to 90% true positive results (correct identification of drug use) for cannabis users.  

The test is also 80% [[Specificity (tests)|specific]], meaning  [[true negative rate]] (TNR)=0.80.  Therefore the test correctly identifies 80% of non-use for non-users, but also generates 20% false positives, or [[false positive rate]] (FPR)=0.20, for non-users. 

Assuming 0.05 [[prevalence]], meaning 5% of people use cannabis, what is the [[probability]] that a random person who tests positive is really a cannabis user?  

The [[Positive predictive value]] (PPV) of a test is the proportion of persons who are actually positive out of all those testing positive, and can be calculated from a sample as:
:PPV = True positive / Tested positive

If sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence are known, PPV can be calculated using Bayes theorem.  Let &lt;math&gt;P(\text{User}\mid \text{Positive}) &lt;/math&gt; mean &quot;the probability that someone is a cannabis user given that they test positive,&quot; which is what is meant by PPV.  We can write:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P(\text{User}\mid \text{Positive}) &amp;= \frac{P(\text{Positive}\mid \text{User}) P(\text{User})}{P(\text{Positive})} \\
 &amp;= \frac{P(\text{Positive}\mid\text{User}) P(\text{User})}{P(\text{Positive}\mid\text{User}) P(\text{User}) + P(\text{Positive}\mid\text{Non-user}) P(\text{Non-user})} \\[8pt] 
&amp;= \frac{0.90 \times 0.05}{0.90 \times 0.05 + 0.20 \times 0.95}
= \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.19} \approx 19\%
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The fact that &lt;math&gt;
P(\text{Positive}) = P(\text{Positive}\mid\text{User}) P(\text{User}) + P(\text{Positive}\mid\text{Non-user}) P(\text{Non-user})
&lt;/math&gt; 
is a direct application of the [[Law of Total Probability]]. In this case, it says that the probability that someone tests positive is the probability that a user tests positive, times the probability of being a user, plus the probability that a non-user tests positive, times the probability of being a non-user. 

This is true because the classifications user and non-user form a [[partition of a set]], namely the set of people who take the drug test. This combined with the definition of [[conditional probability]] results in the above statement.

Even if someone tests positive, the probability they are a cannabis user is only 19%, because in this group only 5% of people are users, most positives are false positives coming from the remaining 95%.

If 1,000 people were tested:
* 950 are non-users and 190 of them give false positive (0.20 &amp;times; 950) 
* 50 of them are users and 45 of them give true positive (0.90 &amp;times; 50)

The 1,000 people thus yields 235 positive tests, of which only 45 are genuine drug users, about 19%. See Figure 1 for an illustration using a frequency box, and note how small the pink area of true positives is compared to the blue area of false positives. 

====Sensitivity or specificity====
The importance of [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]] can be seen by showing that even if sensitivity is raised to 100% and specificity remains at 80%, the probability of someone testing positive really being a cannabis user only rises from 19% to 21%, but if the sensitivity is held at 90% and the specificity is increased to 95%, the probability rises to 49%.

===Cancer rate===
Even if 100% of patients with pancreatic cancer have a certain symptom, when someone has the same symptom, it does not mean that this person has a 100% chance of getting pancreatic cancer. Assume the incidence rate of pancreatic cancer is 1/100000, while 1/10000 healthy individuals have the same symptoms worldwide, the probability of having pancreatic cancer given the symptoms is only 9.1%, and the other 90.9% could be &quot;false positives&quot; (that is, falsely said to have cancer; &quot;positive&quot; is a confusing term when, as here, the test gives bad news).

Based on incidence rate, the following table presents the corresponding numbers per 100,000 people.
{| class=wikitable
! {{diagonal split header|Symptom &amp;nbsp;|Cancer}}
! style=&quot;width:5ex;&quot;|Yes
! style=&quot;width:5ex;&quot;|No
! rowspan=&quot;5&quot; style=&quot;padding:0;&quot;|
! Total
|-
! Yes
| style=&quot;text-align:right&quot; | 1
| style=&quot;text-align:right&quot; | 10
| style=&quot;text-align:right&quot; | 11
|-
! No
| style=&quot;text-align:right&quot; | 0
| style=&quot;text-align:right&quot; | 99989
| style=&quot;text-align:right&quot; | 99989
|-
| colspan=&quot;5&quot; style=&quot;padding:0;&quot;|
|-
! Total
| style=&quot;text-align:right&quot; | 1
| style=&quot;text-align:right&quot; | 99999
| style=&quot;text-align:right&quot; | 100000
|}
Which can then be used to calculate the probability of having cancer when you have the symptoms: 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P(\text{Cancer}|\text{Symptoms}) &amp;= \frac{P(\text{Symptoms}|\text{Cancer}) P(\text{Cancer})}{P(\text{Symptoms})} \\
 &amp;= \frac{P(\text{Symptoms}|\text{Cancer}) P(\text{Cancer})}{P(\text{Symptoms}|\text{Cancer}) P(\text{Cancer}) + P(\text{Symptoms}|\text{Non-Cancer}) P(\text{Non-Cancer})} \\[8pt]
&amp;= \frac{1 \times 0.00001}{1 \times 0.00001 + (10/99999) \times 0.99999} = \frac1{11} \approx 9.1\%
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

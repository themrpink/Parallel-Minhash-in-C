On May 12, 1894 the workers went on strike.

The American Railway Union was led by [[Eugene V. Debs|Eugene Victor Debs]], a pacifist and socialist who later founded the Socialist Party of America and was its candidate for president in five elections. Under the leadership of Debs, sympathetic railroad workers across the nation tied up rail traffic to the Pacific. The so-called &quot;Debs Rebellion&quot; had begun.

Arcade Building with strikers and soldiers Debs gave Pullman five days to respond to the union demands but Pullman refused even to negotiate (leading another industrialist to yell, &quot;The damned idiot ought to arbitrate, arbitrate and arbitrate! ...A man who won't meet his own men halfway is a God-damn fool!&quot;). Instead, Pullman locked up his home and business and left town.

On June 26, all Pullman cars were cut from trains. When union members were fired, entire rail lines were shut down, and Chicago was besieged. One consequence was a blockade of the federal mail, and Debs agreed to let isolated mail cars into the city. Rail owners mixed mail cars into all their trains however, and then called in the federal government when the mail failed to get through.

Debs could not pacify the pent-up frustrations of the exploited workers, and violence broke out between rioters and the federal troops that were sent to protect the mail. On July 8, soldiers began shooting strikers. That was the beginning of the end of the strike. By the end of the month, 34 people had been killed, the strikers were dispersed, the troops were gone, the courts had sided with the railway owners, and Debs was in jail for contempt of court.

Pullman's reputation was soiled by the strike, and then officially tarnished by the presidential commission that investigated the incident. The national commission report found Pullman's paternalism partly to blame and described Pullman's company town as &quot;un-American.&quot; The report condemned Pullman for refusing to negotiate and for the economic hardships he created for workers in the town of Pullman. &quot;The aesthetic features are admired by visitors, but have little money value to employees, especially when they lack bread.&quot; The State of Illinois filed suit, and in 1898 the [[Supreme Court of Illinois]] forced the Pullman Company to divest ownership in the town, which was annexed to Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/chicago/peopleevents/p_pullman.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Archaeology&gt;{{cite journal|author=Arthur Melville Pearson |date=January–February 2009|title=Utopia Derailed|journal=Archaeology|volume=62|issue=1|pages=46–49|issn=0003-8113 |url=http://www.archaeology.org/0901/abstracts/pullman.html|accessdate=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
On October 19, 1897, Pullman died of a heart attack in Chicago, Illinois. He was 66 years old. Pullman was buried at [[Graceland Cemetery]] in Chicago, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |URL=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/843/george-mortimer-pullman |title=George Mortimer Pullman |publisher=[[Find a Grave]] |accessdate=September 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; George and his wife Hattie had four children: Florence, Harriett, George Jr. and Walter Sanger Pullman.

=== Burial ===
[[File:George Pullman tomb by Gerald Farinas.JPG|thumb|Tomb of George Pullman at [[Graceland Cemetery]] in Chicago.]]
Fearing that some of his former employees or other labor supporters might try to dig up his body, his family arranged for his remains to be placed in a lead-lined mahogany coffin, which was then sealed inside a block of concrete. At the cemetery, a large pit had been dug at the family plot. At its base and walls were 18 inches of reinforced concrete. The coffin was lowered, and covered with asphalt and tarpaper. More concrete was poured on top, followed by a layer of steel rails bolted together at right angles, and another layer of concrete. The entire burial process took two days. His monument, featuring a Corinthian column flanked by curved stone benches, was designed by [[Solon Spencer Beman]], the architect of the company town of Pullman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cemeteryguide.com/pullman.html |title=Chicago Remains to Be Seen - George Pullman |publisher=Cemeteryguide.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scottish Rite ==
Pullman was initiated to the [[Scottish Rite]] Freemasonry in the Renovation Lodge No. 97, Albion, New York&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://pub.acgl.eu/index.php/freemasonry/information | title = Famous men members of Masonic Lodges | website = American Canadian Grand Lodge ACGL | language = en | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181117142833/https://pub.acgl.eu/index.php/freemasonry/information | archive-date = November 17, 2018 | url-status = dead | access-date = November 17, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bavarialodge.org/freemasonry | title = Famous members of Masonic Lodges | language = en | website = Bavaria Lodge No. 935 A.F. &amp; A.

==Public projects==
Pullman was identified with various public enterprises, among them the Metropolitan elevated railway system of New York. It was constructed and opened to the public by a corporation of which he was president.&lt;ref name=appletons/&gt;

The [[Pullman Company]] merged in 1930 with [[Standard Steel Car Company]] to become Pullman-Standard, which built its last car for [[Amtrak]] in 1982. After delivery the Pullman-Standard plant stayed in limbo, and eventually shut down. In 1987, its remaining assets were absorbed by [[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]].

==Legacy==
*In Pullman's will, he bequeathed $1.2 million &lt;ref name=&quot;The Pullman State Historic Site&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=George M. Pullman's Will|url=http://pullman-museum.org/theMan/images/mGMPWill.jpg|accessdate=16 November 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=28 October 1897}}&lt;/ref&gt; to establish the Pullman Free School of Manual Training for the children of employees of the Pullman Palace Car Company and the residents of the neighboring Roseland community.  In 1950, the George M. Pullman Educational Foundation succeeded the Pullman Free School of Manual Training, also known as Pullman Tech, after it closed its doors in 1949.  Located in Chicago, Illinois, the George M. Pullman Educational Foundation supports college-bound high school seniors with merit-based, need-based scholarships to attend the college of their choice.  Since its founding, the Foundation has awarded approximately $30 million to over 13,000 outstanding Cook County students. 
*The city of [[Pullman, Washington]] is named in his honor. The town expected him to build major railroads in Pullman, but the route went into [[Spokane]].
*The Pullman Memorial Universalist Church (1894) in [[Albion (village), New York|Albion, New York]], was funded and built by Pullman in memory of his parents.

'''Charles Tyson Yerkes''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|ɜːr|k|iː|z}} {{respell|YUR|keez}}; June 25, 1837 – December 29, 1905) was an American financier. He played a major part in developing mass-transit systems in [[Chicago]] and [[London]].

==Philadelphia==
Yerkes was born into a [[Quaker]] family{{sfnp|The Economist|2014}} in the Northern Liberties, a district adjacent to [[Philadelphia]], on June 25, 1837. His mother died of [[puerperal fever]] when he was five years old and shortly thereafter his father was expelled from the [[Society of Friends]] for marrying a non-Quaker.  After finishing a two-year course at Philadelphia's [[Central High School (Philadelphia)|Central High School]], Yerkes began his business career at the age of 17 as a clerk in a local grain brokerage. In 1859, aged 22, he opened his own brokerage firm and joined the Philadelphia [[stock exchange]].

By 1865 he had moved into banking and specialized in selling municipal, state, and government bonds.  Relying on his bank president father's connections, his political contacts, and his own acumen, Yerkes gained a name for himself in the local financial and social world. However, while serving as a financial agent for the City of Philadelphia's treasurer, Joseph Marcer, Yerkes risked public money in a large-scale stock speculation. This speculation ended calamitously when the [[Great Chicago Fire]] sparked a financial panic. Left [[insolvent]] and unable to make payment to the City of Philadelphia, Yerkes was convicted of [[larceny]] and sentenced to thirty-three months in [[Eastern State Penitentiary]]. 

In an attempt to remain out of prison, he attempted to [[blackmail]] two influential Pennsylvania politicians. The blackmail plan initially failed, however the damaging information on these politicians was eventually made public and political leaders including then-President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] feared that the revelations might harm their prospects in the upcoming elections. Yerkes was promised a pardon if he would deny the accusations he had made. He agreed to these terms and was released after serving seven months in prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Tyson-Yerkes|title=Charles Tyson Yerkes - American financier|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chicago==

In 1881 Yerkes traveled to [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]] in the [[Dakota Territory]] in order to obtain a divorce from his wife. Later that year, he remarried and moved to [[Chicago]]. There, he opened a stock and grain brokerage but soon became involved with planning the city's public transportation system. In 1886, Yerkes and his business partners used a complex financial deal to take over the [[North Chicago Street Railway]] and then proceeded to follow this with a string of further take-overs until he controlled a majority of Chicago's [[street railway]] systems on the north and west sides. Yerkes was not averse to using [[bribery]] and [[blackmail]] to obtain his ends.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt; 

In an effort to improve his public image, Yerkes decided in 1892 to bankroll the world's largest telescope after being lobbied by the [[astronomer]] [[George Ellery Hale]] and University of Chicago president [[William Rainey Harper]]. He had initially intended to finance only a [[telescope]] but eventually agreed to foot the bill for an entire [[observatory]].  He contributed nearly $300,000 to the [[University of Chicago]] to establish what would become known as the [[Yerkes Observatory]], located in [[Williams Bay]], [[Wisconsin]].

Yerkes embarked upon a campaign for longer streetcar franchises in 1895, however Illinois governor [[John Peter Altgeld]] vetoed the franchise bills.  Yerkes renewed the campaign in 1897, and, after a hard-fought battle, secured from the [[Illinois Legislature]] a bill granting city councils the right to approve extended franchises.  The so-called franchise war then shifted to the [[Chicago City Council]]—an arena in which Yerkes ordinarily thrived.  A partially reformed council under Mayor [[Carter Harrison, Jr.]], however, ultimately defeated Yerkes, with the swing votes coming from aldermen [[Michael Kenna|&quot;Hinky Dink&quot; Kenna]] and [[John Coughlin (alderman)|&quot;Bathhouse&quot; John Coughlin]].

In 1899, Yerkes sold the majority of his Chicago transport stocks and moved to [[New York City|New York]].{{sfnp|The Economist|2014}}

==Art collection==
[[File:Bouguereau 1892 painting &quot;Invading Cupid's Realm&quot;.jpg|thumb|[[William-Adolphe Bouguereau|Bouguereau]]'s 1892 painting &quot;Invading Cupid's Realm&quot;, purchased after the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Columbian Exposition of 1893]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://columbus.gl.iit.edu/dreamcity/00044012.html|title=The Dream City: Invasion of Cupid's Realm (&quot;The Wasp's Nest&quot;)|website=columbus.gl.iit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueofpaint02yerk#page/74/mode/2up Catalog nr. 13] in Yerkes art catalog (Volume II)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
While living in Chicago, Yerkes became an avid art collector, relying on [[Sarah Tyson Hallowell]] (1846–1924) to advise him on his purchases. After the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair in 1893]], she tried to interest him in the works of [[Auguste Rodin]], which were part of the loan exhibitor of French art.  Because the subject matter was controversial, Yerkes initially turned the works down, but he soon changed his mind and acquired two Rodin marbles, ''Orpheus'' and ''Cupid and Psyche'', for his Chicago mansion, the first two of Rodin's works known to have been sold to an American collector.  Yerkes' art collection also included works by the [[Académie Française|French academic]] painters, such as ''[[Pygmalion and Galatea (Gérôme painting)|Pygmalion and Galatea]]'' by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] and works by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]] and members of the [[Barbizon school|Barbizon School]]. In 1904 he published a two volume catalog of his collection, which by that time was in New York:
* ''Catalogue of paintings and sculpture in the collection of Charles T. Yerkes, esq.'', New York, 1904

==London==
In August 1900, Yerkes became involved in the development of the [[London Underground|London underground]] railway system after riding along the route of one proposed line and surveying the city of [[London]] from the summit of [[Hampstead Heath]].  He established the [[Underground Electric Railways Company of London]] to take control of the [[District Railway]] and the partly built [[Baker Street and Waterloo Railway]]; [[Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway]]; and [[Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway]].{{sfnp|The Economist|2014}} Yerkes employed complex financial arrangements similar to those that he had used in America to raise the funds necessary to construct the new lines and electrify the District railway. In one of his last great triumphs, Yerkes managed to thwart an attempt by [[J. P. Morgan]] to enter the London underground railway field.{{sfnp|The Economist|2014}} Yerkes did not live to see his London tube lines in operation. The now Bakerloo and Piccadilly lines opened in 1906, a few months after his death, and the Charing Cross line the following summer.

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Charles Tyson Yerkes by Jan van Beers.jpg|thumb|Charles Tyson Yerkes by [[Jan van Beers (artist)|Jan van Beers]], c. 1893]]
Yerkes died in New York 1905, of [[kidney disease]]. The events of Yerkes' life served as a blueprint for the [[Theodore Dreiser]] novels, ''[[The Financier]]'', ''[[The Titan (novel)|The Titan]]'' and ''[[The Stoic]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt; in which Yerkes was fictionalized as Frank Cowperwood.

The [[Impact crater|crater]] [[Yerkes (crater)|Yerkes]] on the [[Moon]] is named in his honor.

Yerkes and his wife Mary were painted by his favorite artist Jan van Beers (National Portrait Gallery, [[Washington, D.C.]]).  His wife, the daughter of Thomas Moore of Philadelphia, was also painted in 1892 by the Swiss-born American artist [[Adolfo Müller-Ury]] (1862–1947). In 1893 Müller-Ury painted from miniatures portraits of Yerkes' Quaker grandparents, Mr and Mrs Silas Yerkes. A year after Yerkes' death, his widow married playwright and raconteur [[Wilson Mizner]].

The '''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles''' (often shortened to the '''TMNT''' or '''Ninja Turtles''') are four fictional teenaged superhero [[anthropomorphic]] [[mutant]] [[turtle]]s. Named after [[Italian Renaissance]] artists, they were trained by their anthropomorphic [[rat]] ''[[sensei]]'' in the [[Japanese martial art]] of ''[[ninjutsu]]''. From their home in the sewers of [[New York City]], they battle petty criminals, evil overlords, [[mutated]] creatures, and alien invaders while attempting to remain hidden from society. They were created by [[Kevin Eastman]] and [[Peter Laird]]. The characters originated in comic books published by [[Mirage Studios]] and expanded into cartoon series, films, video games, toys, and other merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Just How Powerful Are Those Turtles?|work= The New York Times|date=April 15, 1990|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/15/movies/just-how-powerful-are-those-turtles.html?scp=8&amp;sq=ninja%20turtles&amp;st=cse|accessdate=August 7, 2010 | first1=Harvey R. | last1=Greenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the peak of the franchise's popularity in the late [[1980s]] and early [[1990s]], it gained worldwide success and fame.

== History ==
[[File:Tmnt1cover.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Cover of ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' #1 (May 1984)]]

The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles first appeared in an [[American comic book]] published by Mirage Studios in 1984 in [[Dover, New Hampshire]]. The concept arose from a humorous drawing sketched out by Eastman during a casual evening of [[brainstorming]] and bad television with Laird.&lt;ref name=&quot;ezine.kungfumagazine.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title= TMNT: The {{Typo|Rennaissance}} [''sic&amp;''] Reptiles Return|work= Kung Fu Magazine|url=http://ezine.kungfumagazine.com/ezine/article.php?article=703|accessdate=December 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using money from a [[tax refund]], together with a loan from Eastman's uncle, the young artists [[Self-publishing|self-published]] a single-issue comic intended to [[parody]] four of the most popular comics of the early 1980s: [[Marvel Comics]]’ ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]'' and ''[[New Mutants]]'', [[Dave Sim]]’s ''[[Cerebus the Aardvark|Cerebus]]'', and [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]’s ''[[Ronin (DC Comics)|Ronin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103225131/https://metaltv.com/page.cfm?id=260|archive-date=January 3, 2010 |url=http://www.heavymetal.com/index.php?id=260|title=I Was a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle |date=January 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage Studios)|''TMNT'' comic book series]] has been published in various incarnations by various comic book companies since 1984.

The Turtles started their rise to mainstream success when a licensing agent, Mark Freedman, sought out Eastman and Laird to propose wider merchandising opportunities for the franchise. In 1986, Dark Horse Miniatures produced a set of 15-mm (approximately 0.6 inch) lead figurines. In January 1987, Eastman and Laird visited the offices of [[Playmates Toys]], a small California toy company that wanted to expand into the action-figure market. Development was undertaken by a creative team of companies and individuals: Jerry Sachs, advertising agent of Sachs-Finley Agency, brought together the animators at [[Fred Wolf Films|Murakami-Wolf-Swenson]] headed by Fred Wolf. Wolf and his team combined concepts and ideas with the Playmates marketing crew, headed by Karl Aaronian, vice president (VP) of sales Richard Sallis, and VP of Playmates Bill Carlson.&lt;ref name=treasury&gt;{{cite book|title=The Official Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Treasury|first=Stanley|last=Wiater|publisher=Villard Books|year=1991|isbn=0679734848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aaronian brought on several designers and concepteur and writer [[John C. Schulte]], and worked out the simple backstory that would live on toy packaging for the entire run of the product and show.&lt;ref name=treasury/&gt; Sachs called the [[high concept]] pitch &quot;Green Against Brick&quot;. The sense of humor was honed with the collaboration of the Murakami-Wolf-Swenson animation firm's writers. Playmates and their team essentially served as associate producers and contributing writers to the miniseries that was first launched to sell-in the toy action figures. Phrases like &quot;Heroes in a half shell&quot; and many of the comical catch phrases and battle cries (&quot;Turtle power!&quot;) came from the writing and conceptualization of this creative team. As the series developed, veteran writer [[Jack Mendelsohn]] came on board as both a story editor and scriptwriter. David Wise, Michael Charles Hill, and [[Michael Reaves]] wrote most of the scripts.

The miniseries was repeated three times before it found an audience. Once the product started selling, the show got syndicated and picked up and backed by [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W]], which funded the next round of animation. The show then went network, on [[CBS]]. Accompanied by the popular [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' 1987 TV series]], and the subsequent [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures|action figure line]], ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' became a mainstream success. At the height of the frenzy, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Turtles' likenesses could be found on a wide range of children's merchandise, from [[Pez dispenser]]s to skateboards, breakfast cereal, video games, school supplies, linens, towels, cameras, and toy shaving kits.

While the animated TV series, which lasted for 10 seasons until 1996, was more lighthearted, the comic-book series continued in a much darker and grittier tone. In 1990, a [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990 film)|live-action feature film]] was released, with the Turtles and [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]] being portrayed by actors in partially animatronic suits created by [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]]. The independent film was very successful, spawning [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (film series)|two sequels]], as well as inspiring a three-dimensional animated film set in the same continuity, which was released in 2007 under the title ''[[TMNT (film)|TMNT]]''. After the end of the cartoon series, a live-action series in the vein of the films was created in 1997 in conjunction with [[Saban Entertainment]]. The series was called ''[[Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation]]'' and introduced a fifth, female turtle called [[Venus (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Venus de Milo]]. However, the series was largely unsuccessful and was canceled after one season.

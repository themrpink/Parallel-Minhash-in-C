Although the laboratory did not employ any revolutionary measurement techniques, it was unique because of the simple logistics of constructing such a demonstration within a limited space, and because of the speed and efficiency with which all the necessary data were gathered. The laboratory itself was a see-through (lattice-walled) fenced off gallery measuring 36 feet long by 6 feet long. To collect data efficiently, Galton had to make the process as simple as possible for people to understand. As a result, subjects were taken through the laboratory in pairs so that explanations could be given to two at a time, also in the hope that one of the two would confidently take the initiative to go through all the tests first, encouraging the other. With this design, the total time spent in the exhibit was fourteen minutes for each pair.{{sfn|Galton|1885a|pp=205-221}}

Galton states that the measurements of human characteristics are useful for two reasons. First, he states that measuring physical characteristics is useful in order to ensure, on a more domestic level, that children are developing properly. A useful example he gives for the practicality of these domestic measurements is regularly checking a child's eyesight, in order to correct any deficiencies early on. The second use for the data from his anthropometric laboratory is for statistical studies. He comments on the usefulness of the collected data to compare attributes across occupations, residences, races, etc.{{sfn|Galton|1885a|pp=205-221}} The exhibit at the health exhibition allowed Galton to collect a large amount of raw data from which to conduct further comparative studies. He had 9,337 respondents, each measured in 17 categories, creating a rather comprehensive statistical database.{{sfn|Galton|1884|p=}}

After the conclusion of the International Health Exhibition, Galton used these data to confirm in humans his theory of linear regression, posed after studying sweet peas. The accumulation of this human data allowed him to observe the correlation between forearm length and height, head width and head breadth, and head length and height. With these observations he was able to write ''Co-relations and their Measurements, chiefly from Anthropometric Data''.{{sfn|Gillham|2001c|pp=82-102}} In this publication, Galton defined what co-relation as a phenomenon that occurs when &quot;the variation of the one [variable] is accompanied on the average by more or less variation of the other, and in the same direction.&quot;{{sfn|Galton|1888|pp=273-279}}

==Innovations in statistics and psychological theory==

===Historiometry===
The method used in ''Hereditary Genius'' has been described as the first example of [[historiometry]]. To bolster these results, and to attempt to make a distinction between 'nature' and 'nurture' (he was the first to apply this phrase to the topic), he devised a questionnaire that he sent out to 190 [[Fellows of the Royal Society]]. He tabulated characteristics of their families, such as [[birth order]] and the occupation and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] of their parents. He attempted to discover whether their interest in science was 'innate' or due to the encouragements of others. The studies were published as a book, ''English men of science: their nature and nurture'', in 1874. In the end, it promoted the [[nature versus nurture]] question, though it did not settle it, and provided some fascinating data on the sociology of scientists of the time.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

===The lexical hypothesis===
Sir Francis was the first scientist to recognise what is now known as the [[lexical hypothesis]].{{sfn|Caprara|Cervone|2000|p=68}} This is the idea that the most salient and socially relevant personality differences in people's lives will eventually become encoded into language. The hypothesis further suggests that by sampling language, it is possible to derive a comprehensive taxonomy of human [[personality traits]].

===The questionnaire===
Galton's inquiries into the mind involved detailed recording of people's subjective accounts of whether and how their minds dealt with phenomena such as [[visual memory|mental imagery]]. To better elicit this information, he pioneered the use of the [[questionnaire]]. In one study, he asked his fellow members of the Royal Society of London to describe mental images that they experienced. In another, he collected in-depth surveys from eminent scientists for a work examining the effects of nature and nurture on the propensity toward scientific thinking.{{sfn|Clauser|2007|pp=440-444}}

===Variance and standard deviation===
Core to any statistical analysis is the concept that measurements vary: they have both a [[central tendency]], or mean, and a spread around this central value, or [[variance]]. In the late 1860s, Galton conceived of a measure to quantify normal variation: the [[standard deviation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chad Denby |url=http://www.sciencetimeline.net/1866.htm |title=Science Timeline |publisher=Science Timeline |access-date=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galton was a keen observer. In 1906, visiting a livestock fair, he stumbled upon an intriguing contest. An ox was on display, and the villagers were invited to guess the animal's weight after it was slaughtered and dressed. Nearly 800 participated, and Galton was able to study their individual entries after the event. Galton stated that &quot;the middlemost estimate expresses the ''vox populi'', every other estimate being condemned as too low or too high by a majority of the voters&quot;,{{sfn|Galton|1907|p=450}} and reported this value (the [[median]], in terminology he himself had introduced, but chose not to use on this occasion) as 1,207 pounds. To his surprise, this was within 0.8% of the weight measured by the judges. Soon afterwards, in response to an enquiry, he reported&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://galton.org/cgi-bin/searchImages/galton/search/essays/pages/galton-1907-ballot-box_1.htm The Ballot Box]&quot;, ''Nature'', 28 March 1907&lt;/ref&gt; the mean of the guesses as 1,197 pounds, but did not comment on its improved accuracy.  Recent archival research{{sfn|Wallis|2014|pp=420-424}} has found some slips in transmitting Galton's calculations to the original article in ''Nature'': the median was actually 1,208 pounds, and the dressed weight of the ox 1,197 pounds, so the mean estimate had zero error.  James Surowiecki{{sfn|Surowiecki|2004|p=}} uses this weight-judging competition as his opening example: had he known the true result, his conclusion on the wisdom of the crowd would no doubt have been more strongly expressed.

The same year, Galton suggested in a letter to the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' a better method of cutting a round cake by avoiding making radial incisions.{{sfn|Galton|1906|p=173}}

===Experimental derivation of the normal distribution===
[[File:Quincunx (Galton Box) - Galton 1889 diagram.png|thumb|Galton's 1889 illustration of the quincunx or [[bean machine]].]]
Studying variation, Galton invented the quincunx, a [[pachinko]]-like device also known as the [[bean machine]], as a tool for demonstrating the [[law of error]] and the [[normal distribution]].{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=4}}

===Bivariate normal distribution===
He also discovered the properties of the [[bivariate normal distribution]] and its relationship to [[regression analysis]].

===Correlation and regression===
[[File:Galton's correlation diagram 1875.jpg|thumb|Galton's correlation diagram 1886{{sfn|Galton |1886|p= 248|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JPcRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA248-IA3#v=onepage Plate X]}}]]
In 1846, the French physicist [[Auguste Bravais]] (1811–1863) first developed what would become the correlation coefficient.{{sfn|Bravais|1846|pp=255-332}} After examining forearm and height measurements, Galton independently rediscovered the concept of [[correlation]] in 1888{{sfn|Galton|1888|pp=135-145}}{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|pp=191–196}} and demonstrated its application in the study of heredity, anthropology, and psychology.{{sfn|Clauser|2007|pp=440-444}} Galton's later statistical study of the probability of extinction of surnames led to the concept of [[Galton–Watson process|Galton–Watson stochastic processes]].{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|pp=182–184}} This is now a core of modern statistics and regression.

Galton invented the use of the regression line{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=184}} and for the choice of r (for reversion or regression) to represent the correlation coefficient.{{sfn|Clauser|2007|pp=440-444}}

In the 1870s and 1880s he was a pioneer in the use of [[normal distribution|normal theory]] to fit [[histogram]]s and [[Ogive (statistics)|ogives]] to actual tabulated data, much of which he collected himself: for instance [[big data|large samples]] of sibling and parental height. Consideration of the results from these empirical studies led to his further insights into evolution, natural selection, and regression to the mean.

===Regression toward the mean===
Galton was the first to describe and explain the common phenomenon of [[regression toward the mean]], which he first observed in his experiments on the size of the seeds of successive generations of sweet peas.

The conditions under which regression toward the mean occurs depend on the way the term is mathematically defined. Galton first observed the phenomenon in the context of [[simple linear regression]] of data points. Galton{{sfn|Galton|1889|p=}} developed the following model: pellets fall through a ''[[quincunx]]'' or &quot;[[bean machine]]&quot; forming a normal distribution centered directly under their entrance point. These pellets could then be released down into a second gallery (corresponding to a second measurement occasion). Galton then asked the reverse question &quot;from where did these pellets come?&quot;
{{quote|
The answer was not &quot;on average directly above&quot;. Rather it was &quot;on average, more towards the middle&quot;, for the simple reason that there were more pellets above it towards the middle that could wander left than there were in the left extreme that could wander to the right, inwards.
|source={{harvnb|Stigler|2010|p=477}} }}

===Theories of perception===
Galton went beyond measurement and summary to attempt to explain the phenomena he observed. Among such developments, he proposed an early theory of ranges of sound and [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], and collected large quantities of anthropometric data from the public through his popular and long-running Anthropometric Laboratory, which he established in 1884, and where he studied over 9,000 people.{{sfn|Gillham|2001a|p=}} It was not until 1985 that these data were analysed in their entirety.

He made a beauty map of Britain, based on a secret grading of the local women on a scale from attractive to repulsive. The lowest point was in [[Aberdeen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Francis Galton: The man who drew up the 'ugly map' of Britain |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-13775520 |website=[[BBC]] |access-date=24 June 2020 |date=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differential psychology===
{{Main|Differential psychology}}

Galton's study of human abilities ultimately led to the foundation of [[differential psychology]] and the formulation of the first mental tests. He was interested in measuring humans in every way possible. This included measuring their ability to make sensory discrimination which he assumed was linked to intellectual prowess. Galton suggested that individual differences in general ability are reflected in performance on relatively simple sensory capacities and in speed of reaction to a stimulus, variables that could be objectively measured by tests of sensory discrimination and reaction
time.{{sfn|Jensen|2002|pp=145-172}} He also measured how quickly people reacted which he later linked to internal wiring which ultimately limited intelligence ability. Throughout his research Galton assumed that people who reacted faster were more intelligent than others.

===Composite photography===
Galton also devised a technique called &quot;[[composite portrait]]ure&quot; (produced by superimposing multiple photographic portraits of individuals' faces registered on their eyes) to create an average face (see [[averageness]]). In the 1990s, a hundred years after his discovery, much psychological research has examined the [[attractiveness]] of these faces, an aspect that Galton had remarked on in his original lecture. Others, including [[Sigmund Freud]] in his work on dreams, picked up Galton's suggestion that these composites might represent a useful metaphor for an [[Ideal type]] or a [[concept]] of a &quot;[[natural kind]]&quot; (see [[Eleanor Rosch]])—such as Jewish men, criminals, patients with tuberculosis, etc.—onto the same photographic plate, thereby yielding a blended whole, or &quot;composite&quot;, that he hoped could generalise the facial appearance of his subject into an &quot;average&quot; or &quot;central type&quot;.{{sfn|Galton|1883|p=}}{{sfn|Galton|1878|pp=132–142}} (See also entry ''Modern physiognomy'' under [[Physiognomy]]).

This work began in the 1880s while the Jewish scholar [[Joseph Jacobs]] studied anthropology and statistics with Francis Galton. Jacobs asked Galton to create a composite photograph of a Jewish type.{{sfn|Novak|2008|p=100}} One of Jacobs' first publications that used Galton's composite imagery was &quot;The Jewish Type, and Galton's Composite Photographs,&quot; ''Photographic News'', 29, (24 April 1885): 268–269.

Galton hoped his technique would aid medical diagnosis, and even criminology through the identification of typical criminal faces. However, his technique did not prove useful and fell into disuse, although after much work on it including by photographers [[Lewis Hine]] and [[John L. Lovell]] and [[Arthur Batut]].

==Fingerprints==
In a [[Royal Institution]] paper in 1888 and three books (''[[Finger Prints (book)|Finger Prints]]'', 1892; ''Decipherment of Blurred Finger Prints'', 1893; and ''Fingerprint Directories'', 1895),{{sfn|Conklin|Gardner|Shortelle|2002|p=}} Galton estimated the probability of two persons having the same [[fingerprint]] and studied the heritability and racial differences in fingerprints. He wrote about the technique (inadvertently sparking a controversy between Herschel and Faulds that was to last until 1917), identifying common pattern in fingerprints and devising a classification system that survives to this day.

The method of identifying criminals by their fingerprints had been introduced in the 1860s by Sir [[William James Herschel]] in India, and their potential use in forensic work was first proposed by Dr [[Henry Faulds]] in 1880. Galton was introduced to the field by his half-cousin [[Charles Darwin]], who was a friend of Faulds's, and he went on to create the first scientific footing for the study (which assisted its acceptance by the courts{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=35}}) although Galton did not ever give credit that the original idea was not his.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot; /&gt; Galton pointed out that there were specific types of fingerprint patterns. He described and classified them into eight broad categories: 1: plain arch, 2: tented arch, 3: simple loop, 4: central pocket loop, 5: double loop, 6: lateral pocket loop, 7: plain whorl, and 8: accidental.{{sfn|Innes|2005|pp=32–33}}

==Final years==
[[File:Karl Pearson; Sir Francis Galton.jpg|thumb|Francis Galton (right), aged 87, on the stoep at Fox Holm, Cobham, with the statistician [[Karl Pearson]].]]
In an effort to reach a wider audience, Galton worked on a novel entitled ''Kantsaywhere'' from May until December 1910. The novel described a utopia organised by a eugenic religion, designed to breed [[Fitness (biology)|fitter]] and smarter humans. His unpublished notebooks show that this was an expansion of material he had been composing since at least 1901. He offered it to [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] for publication, but they showed little enthusiasm. Galton wrote to his niece that it should be either &quot;smothered or superseded&quot;. His niece appears to have burnt most of the novel, offended by the love scenes, but large fragments survived,{{sfn|Pearson|1930a|p=413}} and it was published online by University College, London.{{sfn|Galton|Sargent|2001|pp=191-209}}

Galton is buried in the family tomb in the churchyard of St Michael and All Angels, in the village of [[Claverdon]], [[Warwickshire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Challis&quot; /&gt;

==Personal life and character==
In January 1853, Galton met [[Louisa Jane Butler]] (1822–1897) at his neighbour's home and they were married on 1 August 1853. The union of 43 years proved childless.{{sfn|Pearson|1914b|p=281}}&lt;ref name=&quot;auden&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Louisa Jane Galton00.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Louisa Jane Butler]]

It has been written of Galton that &quot;On his own estimation he was a supremely intelligent man.&quot;{{sfn|Winston|2020}} Later in life, Galton proposed a connection between genius and insanity based on his own experience:{{quote|Men who leave their mark on the world are very often those who, being gifted and full of nervous power, are at the same time haunted and driven by a dominant idea, and are therefore within a measurable distance of insanity.|source={{harvnb|Pearson|1914, 1924, 1930}} }}

==Awards and influence==
Over the course of his career Galton received many awards, including the [[Copley Medal]] of the Royal Society (1910). He received in 1853 the Founder's Medal, the highest award of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], for his explorations and map-making of southwest Africa. He was elected a member of the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum Club]] in 1855 and made a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1860. His [[autobiography]] also lists:{{sfn|Galton|1909|p=331}}

* Silver Medal, French Geographical Society (1854)
* Gold Medal of the Royal Society (1886)
* Officier de l'Instruction Publique, France (1891)
* D.C.L. Oxford (1894)
* Sc.D. (Honorary), Cambridge (1895)
* Huxley Medal, Anthropological Institute (1901)
* Elected Hon. Fellow Trinity College, Cambridge (1902)
* Darwin Medal, Royal Society (1902)
* [[Linnean Society of London]]'s [[Darwin–Wallace Medal]] (1908)

Galton was knighted in 1909. His statistical heir [[Karl Pearson]], first holder of the Galton Chair of Eugenics at [[University College, London]] (now Galton Chair of Genetics), wrote a three-volume biography of Galton, in four parts, after his death.{{sfn|Pearson|1914a}}{{sfn|Pearson|1914b}}{{sfn|Pearson|1930a}}{{sfn|Pearson|1930b}}

The flowering plant genus ''[[Galtonia]]'' was named after Galton.

[[University College London]] has in the twenty-first century been involved in a historical inquiry into its role as the institutional birthplace of eugenics. [[Galton Laboratory|Galton established a laboratory at UCL]] in 1904. Some students and staff have called on the university to rename its Galton lecture theatre. &quot;Galton's seductive promise was of a bold new world filled only with beautiful, intelligent, productive people. The scientists in its thrall claimed this could be achieved by controlling reproduction, policing borders to prevent certain types of immigrants, and locking away &quot;undesirables&quot;, including disabled people.&quot;{{sfn|Saini|2019}}

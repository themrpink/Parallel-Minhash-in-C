It was assumed that fractal art could not have developed without computers because of the [[calculation|calculative]] capabilities they provide.&lt;ref name=&quot;dima&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Digital Mantras: The languages of abstract and virtual worlds |last=Steven R. |first=Holtzman |year=1995 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-58143-4 |page=241 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gc5hnRuABy0C |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fractals are generated by applying [[Iteration|iterative]] methods to solving non-linear equations or [[polynomial equation]]s. Fractals are any of various extremely irregular curves or shapes for which any suitably chosen part is similar in shape to a given larger or smaller part when magnified or reduced to the same size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fractal Fractal - Definition].

There are many different kinds of fractal images and can be subdivided into several groups. 
* Fractals derived from standard geometry by using iterative transformations on an initial common figure like a straight line (the Cantor dust or the [[Koch snowflake|von Koch curve]]), a triangle (the [[Sierpinski triangle]]), or a cube (the [[Menger sponge]]). The first fractal figures invented near the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries belong to this group.
* IFS ([[iterated function systems]])
* [[Strange attractors]]
* [[Flame fractals|Fractal flame]]
* [[L-system]] fractals
* Fractals created by the iteration of complex [[polynomial]]s:  perhaps the most famous fractals.
* [[Newton fractal]]s, including [[Nova fractal]]s
* [[Quaternionic]] and (recently) hypernionic{{clarify||date=January 2014}} fractals&lt;ref&gt;[http://paulbourke.net/fractals/quatjulia/ Quaternion Julia Fractals]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fractal terrain]]s generated by random fractal processes&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fractalus.com/fractal-art-faq/faq03.html#3a Fractal Art FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mandelbulb]]s are a kind of three dimensional fractal.

[[Fractal Expressionism]] is a term used to differentiate traditional visual art that incorporates fractal elements such as [[self-similarity]] for example.  Perhaps the best example of fractal expressionism is found in [[Jackson Pollock]]'s dripped patterns.  They have been analysed and found to contain a [[fractal dimension]] which has been attributed to his technique.&lt;ref name=&quot;coex&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Complexity explained |last=Érdi |first=Péter |authorlink=Péter Érdi|year=2008 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-35777-3 |page=214 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JwgpLvknc8wC |accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Fractal-generating software}}
Fractals of all kinds have been used as the basis for digital art and animation. High resolution color graphics became increasingly available at scientific research labs in the mid-1980s.  Scientific forms of art, including fractal art, have developed separately from [[mainstream]] culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;ciem&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Critical issues in electronic media |last=Penny |first=Simon |year=1995 |publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=0-7914-2317-4 |pages=81–82 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzFJnyBjaLMC |accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with 2-dimensional details of fractals, such as the Mandelbrot Set, fractals have found artistic application in fields as varied as texture generation, plant growth simulation and landscape generation.

Fractals are sometimes combined with [[evolutionary algorithms]], either by iteratively choosing good-looking specimens in a set of random variations of a fractal artwork and producing new variations, to avoid dealing with cumbersome or unpredictable parameters, or collectively, as in the [[Electric Sheep]] project, where people use [[fractal flame]]s rendered with [[distributed computing]] as their [[screensaver]] and &quot;rate&quot; the flame they are viewing, influencing the server, which reduces the traits of the undesirables, and increases those of the desirables to produce a computer-generated, community-created piece of art.

Many fractal images are admired because of their perceived [[Principles of art#Harmony|harmony]]. This is typically achieved by the [[pattern]]s which emerge from the [[Principles of art#Balance|balance]] of order and [[Chaos theory|chaos]]. Similar qualities have been described in [[Chinese painting]] and [[Penjing|miniature trees and rockeries]].&lt;ref name=&quot;caftc&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Chaos, complexity, curriculum and culture |editor1-first=William E. |editor1-last=Doll, Jr |editor2-first=Jayne |editor2-last=Fleener |editor3-first=Donna |editor3-last=Trueit |editor4-first=John |display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=St. Julien |last=Wang |first=Hongyu |chapter=Chinese aesthetics, Fractals and the Tao of Curriculum |year=2005 |publisher=Peter Lang Publishing |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8204-6780-1 |page=301 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fROt7Yjz3xgC |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Fractal landscape}}
The first fractal image that was intended to be a work of art was probably the famous one on the cover of ''[[Scientific American]]'', August 1985. This image showed a [[landscape]] formed from the potential function on the domain outside the (usual) [[Mandelbrot set]]. However, as the potential function grows fast near the boundary of the Mandelbrot set, it was necessary for the creator to let the landscape grow downwards, so that it looked as if the Mandelbrot set was a [[plateau]] atop a mountain with steep sides. The same technique was used a year after in some images in ''[[The Beauty of Fractals]]'' by [[Heinz-Otto Peitgen]] and [[Michael M. Richter]]. They provide a formula to estimate the distance from a point outside the Mandelbrot set to the boundary of the Mandelbrot set (and a similar formula for the Julia sets). Landscapes can, for example, be formed from the distance function for a family of iterations of the form &lt;math&gt;z^{2} + az^{4} + c&lt;/math&gt;.

==Artists==
Notable fractal artists include [[Desmond Paul Henry]], [[Hamid Naderi Yeganeh]] and musician [[Bruno Degazio]].  The British artist [[William Latham (computer scientist)|William Latham]], has used fractal geometry and other computer graphics techniques in his works.&lt;ref name=&quot;fpc&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Fractals: The Patterns of Chaos |last=Briggs |first=John |authorlink=John Briggs (author) |year=1992 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |isbn=0-500-27693-5 |page=169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greg Sams]] has used fractal designs in postcards, T-shirts and textiles. American [[Vicky Brago-Mitchell]] has created fractal art which has appeared in exhibitions and on magazine covers. [[Scott Draves]] is credited with inventing flame fractals. [[Carlos Ginzburg]] has explored fractal art and developed a concept called &quot;homo fractalus&quot; which is based around the idea that the human is the ultimate fractal.&lt;ref name=&quot;cagi&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/leonardo/v034/34.1ginzburg.html |title=Carlos Ginzburg |year=2001 |work=[[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]] |publisher=[[Leonardo, The International Society of the Arts, Sciences and Technology|Leonardo/ISAST]], the International Society for the Arts, Sciences and Technology |accessdate=29 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Merrin Parkers from New Zealand specialises in fractal art.&lt;ref name=&quot;hfn&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Heaven's fractal net: retrieving lost visions in the humanities, Volume 1 |last=Jackson |first=William Joseph |year=2004 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0-253-21620-6 |page=116 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U0rJz7FC2z8C |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Kerry Mitchell]] wrote a &quot;Fractal Art Manifesto&quot;, claiming that&lt;ref name=manifesto&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fractalus.com/info/manifesto.htm |title=The Fractal Art Manifesto |author=Mitchell, Kerry |authorlink=Kerry Mitchell |date= |accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Fractal Art is a subclass of two-dimensional visual art, and is in many respects similar to photography—another art form that was greeted by skepticism upon its arrival. Fractal images typically are manifested as [[Printmaking|prints]], bringing fractal artists into the company of painters, photographers, and printmakers. Fractals exist natively as electronic images. This is a format that traditional visual artists are quickly embracing, bringing them into Fractal Art's digital realm. Generating fractals can be an artistic endeavor, a mathematical pursuit, or just a soothing diversion. However, Fractal Art is clearly distinguished from other digital activities by what it is, and by what it is not.&lt;ref name=manifesto/&gt;}}

According to Mitchell, fractal art is not computerized art, lacking in rules, unpredictable, nor something that any person with access to a computer can do well. Instead, fractal art is expressive, creative, and requires input, effort, and intelligence. Most importantly, &quot;fractal art is simply that which is created by Fractal Artists: ART.&quot;&lt;ref name=manifesto/&gt;

More recently, American artist Hal Tenny was hired to design environment in [[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]].

The concept of a '''random sequence''' is essential in [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]]. The concept generally relies on the notion of a [[sequence]] of [[random variable]]s and many statistical discussions begin with the words &quot;let ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' be independent random variables...&quot;. Yet as [[D. H. Lehmer]] stated in 1951: &quot;A random sequence is a vague notion... in which each term is unpredictable to the uninitiated and whose digits pass a certain number of tests traditional with statisticians&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;What is meant by the word Random&quot; in ''Mathematics and common sense'' by Philip J. Davis 2006 {{ISBN|1-56881-270-1}} pages 180-182&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Probability axioms|Axiomatic probability theory]] ''deliberately'' avoids a definition of a random sequence.&lt;ref&gt;''Inevitable Randomness in Discrete Mathematics'' by József Beck 2009 {{ISBN|0-8218-4756-2}} page 44&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional probability theory does not state if a specific sequence is random, but generally proceeds to discuss the properties of random variables and stochastic sequences assuming some definition of randomness. The [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki school]] considered the statement &quot;let us consider a random sequence&quot; an [[abuse of terminology|abuse of language]].&lt;ref&gt;''Algorithms: main ideas and applications'' by Vladimir Andreevich Uspenskiĭ, Alekseĭ, Lʹvovich Semenov 1993 Springer {{ISBN|0-7923-2210-X}} page 166&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early history==
[[Émile Borel]] was one of the first mathematicians to formally address randomness in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;E. Borel, ''Les probabilites denombrables et leurs applications arithmetique'' Rend. Circ. Mat. Palermo 27 (1909) 247–271&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 [[Richard von Mises]] gave the first definition of algorithmic randomness, which was inspired by the law of large numbers, although he used the term ''collective'' rather than random sequence. Using the concept of the [[impossibility of a gambling system]], von Mises defined an infinite sequence of zeros and ones as random if it is not biased by having the ''frequency stability property'' i.e. the frequency of zeros goes to 1/2 and every sub-sequence we can select from it by a &quot;proper&quot; method of selection is also not biased.&lt;ref&gt;Laurant Bienvenu &quot;Kolmogorov Loveland Stochasticity&quot; in STACS 2007: 24th Annual Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science by Wolfgang Thomas {{ISBN|3-540-70917-7}} page 260&lt;/ref&gt;

The sub-sequence selection criterion imposed by von Mises is important, because although 0101010101... is not biased, by selecting the odd positions, we get 000000... which is not random. Von Mises never totally formalized his definition of a proper selection rule for sub-sequences, but in 1940 [[Alonzo Church]] defined it as any [[recursion#Functional recursion|recursive function]] which having read the first N elements of the sequence decides if it wants to select element number&amp;nbsp;''N''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1. Church was a pioneer in the field of computable functions, and the definition he made relied on the [[Church Turing Thesis]] for computability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Church | first1 = Alonzo | authorlink = Alonzo Church | year = 1940 | title = On the Concept of Random Sequence | doi = 10.1090/S0002-9904-1940-07154-X| journal = Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. | volume = 46 | issue = 2| pages = 130–136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is often called ''Mises–Church randomness''.

==Modern approaches==
During the 20th century various technical approaches to defining random sequences were developed and now three distinct paradigms can be identified. In the mid 1960s, [[A. N. Kolmogorov]] and [[D. W. Loveland]] independently proposed a more permissive selection rule.&lt;ref&gt;A. N. Kolmogorov, ''Three approaches to the quantitative definition of information'' Problems of Information and Transmission, 1(1):1–7, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.W. Loveland, ''A new interpretation of von Mises' concept of random sequence'' Z. Math. Logik Grundlagen Math 12 (1966) 279–294&lt;/ref&gt; In their view Church's recursive function definition was too restrictive in that it read the elements in order. Instead they proposed a rule based on a partially computable process which having read ''any'' ''N'' elements of the sequence, decides if it wants to select another element which has not been read yet. This definition is often called ''Kolmogorov–Loveland stochasticity''. But this method was considered too weak by [[Alexander Shen]] who showed that there is a Kolmogorov–Loveland stochastic sequence which does not conform to the general notion of randomness.

In 1966 [[Per Martin-Löf]] introduced a new notion which is now generally considered the most satisfactory notion of [[algorithmic randomness]]. His original definition involved measure theory, but it was later shown that it can be expressed in terms of [[Kolmogorov complexity]]. Kolmogorov's definition of a random string was that it is random if has no description shorter than itself via a [[universal Turing machine]].&lt;ref&gt;''An introduction to Kolmogorov complexity and its applications'' by Ming Li, P. M. B. Vitányi 1997 0387948686 pages 149–151&lt;/ref&gt;

Three basic paradigms for dealing with random sequences have now emerged:&lt;ref&gt;R. Downey, ''Some Recent Progress in Algorithmic Randomness'' in Mathematical foundations of computer science 2004: by Jiří Fiala, Václav Koubek 2004 {{ISBN|3-540-22823-3}} page 44&lt;/ref&gt;

:* The ''frequency / measure-theoretic'' approach. This approach started with the work of Richard von Mises and Alonzo Church. In the 1960s Per Martin-Löf noticed that the sets coding such frequency-based stochastic properties are a special kind of [[measure zero]] sets, and that a more general and smooth definition can be obtained by considering all effectively measure zero sets.

:* The ''complexity / compressibility'' approach. This paradigm was championed by A. N. Kolmogorov along with contributions Levin and [[Gregory Chaitin]]. For finite random sequences, Kolmogorov defined the &quot;randomness&quot; as the entropy, i.e. [[Kolmogorov complexity]], of a string of length K of zeros and ones as the closeness of its entropy to K, i.e. if the complexity of the string is close to K it is very random and if the complexity is far below K, it is not so random.

:* The ''predictability'' approach. This paradigm was due to [[Claus P. Schnorr]] and uses a slightly different definition of constructive [[Martingale (probability theory)|martingales]] than martingales used in traditional probability theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schnorr | first1 = C. P. | year = 1971 | title = A unified approach to the definition of a random sequence | url = | journal = Mathematical Systems Theory | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 246–258 | doi=10.1007/bf01694181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schnorr showed how the existence of a selective betting strategy implied the existence of a selection rule for a biased sub-sequence. If one only requires a recursive martingale to succeed on a sequence instead of constructively succeeds on a sequence, then one gets the recursively randomness concepts. [[Yongge Wang]] showed&lt;ref&gt;Yongge Wang: Randomness and Complexity. PhD Thesis, 1996. http://webpages.uncc.edu/yonwang/papers/IPL97.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Yongge | year = 1999 | title = A separation of two randomness concepts | journal = Information Processing Letters | volume = 69 | issue = 3| pages = 115–118 | doi=10.1016/S0020-0190(98)00202-6| citeseerx = 10.1.1.46.199 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that recursively randomness concept is different from Schnorr's randomness concepts.

In most cases, theorems relating the three paradigms (often equivalence) have been proven.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Merkle, ''Kolmogorov Loveland Stochasticity'' in Automata, languages and programming: 29th international colloquium, ICALP 2002, by Peter Widmayer et al. {{ISBN|3-540-43864-5}} page 391&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to realize that for each of the definitions given above for infinite sequences, if one adds a billion zeros to the front of the random sequence the new sequence will still be considered random. Hence any application of these concepts to practical problems needs to be performed with care.&lt;ref&gt;''Algorithms: main ideas and applications'' by Vladimir Andreevich Uspenskiĭ, Alekseĭ, Lʹvovich Semenov 1993 Springer {{ISBN|0-7923-2210-X}} page 176&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Galaxy 195011.jpg|thumb|Brown's &quot;Honeymoon in Hell&quot; was the cover story in the second issue of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' in 1950]]
'''Fredric Brown''' (October 29, 1906 – March 11, 1972&lt;ref name=ATuttascuola/&gt;) was an American [[science fiction]] and [[mystery fiction|mystery]] writer.&lt;ref name=&quot;djm&quot;&gt;D. J. McReynolds, &quot;The Short Fiction of Fredric Brown&quot; in Frank N. Magill, (ed.) ''Survey of Science Fiction Literature'', Vol. 4. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Salem Press, 1979. (pp. 1954–1957). {{ISBN|9780893561949}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He is  known for his use of humor and for his mastery of the &quot;[[short short story|short short]]&quot; form—stories of 1 to 3 pages, often with ingenious plotting devices and surprise endings. Humor and a somewhat postmodern outlook carried over into his novels as well. One of his stories, &quot;[[Arena (short story)|Arena]]&quot;, is officially credited for an adaptation as an [[Arena (Star Trek: The Original Series)|episode]] of the American [[television series]] [[Star Trek: The Original Series|''Star Trek'']]''.

According to his wife, Fredric Brown hated to write. So he did everything he could to avoid it—he'd play his flute, challenge a friend to a game of chess, or tease Ming Tah, his Siamese cat. If Brown had trouble working out a certain story, he would hop on a long bus trip and just sit and think and plot for days on end.  When Brown finally returned home and sat himself in front of the typewriter, he produced work in a variety of genres: mystery, science fiction, short fantasy, black comedy–and sometimes, all of the above.

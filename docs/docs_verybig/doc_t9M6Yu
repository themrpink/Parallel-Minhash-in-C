On the other hand, legislative bodies at the state or national level have their own well-defined set of rules (such as [[Mason's Manual of Legislative Procedure]]). However, a survey found that four state legislative chambers in the United States still use ''Robert's Rules of Order''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ncsl.org/research/about-state-legislatures/masons-manual-for-legislative-bodies.aspx|title = Mason's Manual for Legislative Bodies|access-date = 2015-09-17|publisher = National Conference of State Legislatures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate world===
{{see|Parliamentary procedure in the corporate world}}
''Robert's Rules of Order'' is based on each member of a group having equal weight as expressed by vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robert|2020|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book has found application in the corporate world, such as in [[shareholder]] meetings and in board of director meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.jimslaughter.com/Corporate-Meetings-and-Parliamentary-Procedure.cfm|title = Corporate Meetings and Parliamentary Procedure|access-date = 2016-01-04|last = Slaughter|first = Jim|quote = Updated from and reprinted with permission from &quot;Better, More Legal Corporate Meetings&quot; in the June/July 1998 N.C. Business Lawyer.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rules have to be modified to account for when some individuals within the group have more power than others.

=== Parliamentarians ===
A [[Parliamentarian (consultant)|parliamentarian]] is an expert on [[parliamentary procedure]]. To be effective consultants for the organizations they work for, parliamentarians are expected to be knowledgeable on ''Robert's Rules of Order''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Parliamentarian of Tomorrow|last = Bierbaum|first = Gene, PhD|publisher = Xlibris Corporation|year = 2010|isbn = 978-1-4535-4792-2|page= 23|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=A66bDt_A1DMC&amp;q=parliamentarian%20of%20tomorrow&amp;pg=PA23}}{{self-published source|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

The [[National Association of Parliamentarians]] (NAP) is the largest non-profit association of parliamentarians in the world. This organization bases its opinions and instruction upon ''Robert’s Rules of Order Newly Revised'' (12th ed.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.parliamentarians.org/about/parliamentary-basics/|title = National Association of Parliamentarians &gt;&gt; Parliamentary Basics|access-date = 2015-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership in this organization requires passing an exam which is based on the first half of the concise guide, ''Robert’s Rules of Order Newly Revised In Brief'' (3rd ed.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.parliamentarians.org/applyjoin/applications/|title = National Association of Parliamentarians &gt;&gt; How to Apply|access-date = 2015-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Institute of Parliamentarians]] is another non-profit association of parliamentarians. This organization stresses proficiency and familiarity with a variety of [[Parliamentary authority|parliamentary authorities]], although it states on its website that &quot;''Robert's Rules of Order'' is the most frequently used parliamentary authority&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://aipparl.org/site/education/become-a-parliamentarian/|title = Become a Parliamentarian - American Institute of Parliamentarians|access-date = 2015-09-18|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160219163445/http://aipparl.org/site/education/become-a-parliamentarian/|archive-date = 2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website also states that it &quot;is the premier manual on parliamentary authority&quot; and &quot;a 'must-have' text for every parliamentarian&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://aipparl.org/site/recommended-reading/|title = Recommended Reading - American Institute of Parliamentarians|access-date = 2015-11-12|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117023303/http://aipparl.org/site/recommended-reading/|archive-date = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Youth organizations ===
Youth organizations, such as [[Business Professionals of America|Business Professionals of America (BPA)]], [[Family, Career and Community Leaders of America|Family, Career and Community Leaders of America (FCCLA)]], [[FBLA-PBL|Future Business Leaders of America-Phi Beta Lambda (FBLA-PBL)]], [[HOSA (organization)|HOSA-Future Health Professionals]], the [[National FFA Organization]], [[SkillsUSA]], and the [[Technology Student Association]] (TSA), sponsor parliamentary procedure competitions (such as [[Parli Pro]]) as part of their programs for their student members. These competitions are based on ''Robert’s Rules of Order Newly Revised''. The [[National Association of Parliamentarians]] have partnered with some of these organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.parliamentarians.org/about/youth-partnerships/|title = National Association of Parliamentarians &gt;&gt; Youth Partnerships|access-date = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Robert's Rules of Order'' are used in [[Congressional Debate]] (also referred to as [[Student congress|Student Congress]]), an event put on by the [[National Speech and Debate Association|National Speech and Debate Association (NSDA)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.speechanddebate.org/wp-content/uploads/High-School-Unified-Manual-2017-2018.pdf|title=NSDA HS Manual|website=National Speech and Debate Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Robert's Rules of Order'' is also used during [[American Legion]] and [[American Legion Auxiliary]] [[Boys/Girls State]] programs and in [[Model United Nations]] conferences. While the chair of each committee in an MUN conference may sometimes deviate from the written rules for educational purposes, the format of the rules in the specific committees is mostly based on ''Robert's Rules of Order''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.unausa.org/global-classrooms-model-un/how-to-participate/model-un-preparation/rules-of-procedure|title = Rules of Procedure (Model UN Preparation)|access-date = 2015-12-02|publisher = United Nations Association of the United States of America}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another program in which ''Robert's Rules of Order'' may be used is [[Model Congress]], although the rules in these programs may more closely resemble those in the legislative assemblies that the programs simulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.actaa.net/Resources/Documents/2015%20Revised%20Student%20Congress%20Bylaws.docx|title = 2015 Revised Student Congress Bylaws|access-date = 2016-01-04|website = www.actaa.net|publisher = Arkansas Communication and Theatre Arts Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.shelburnenews.com/2015/12/22/cvu-goes-to-princeton-model-congress/|title = CVU goes to Princeton Model Congress|date = December 22, 2015|access-date = 2016-01-04|website = www.shelburnenews.com|publisher = Shelburne News|last = Ramirez-Richer|first = Emma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative rules for organizations ==

=== Organization-specific rules ===
Even if an organization has adopted ''Robert's Rules of Order'', it can still adopt its own rules which supersede any rules in this book.&lt;ref name=&quot;:15&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=How to Adopt|url=https://robertsrules.com/how-to-adopt/|access-date=2020-09-07|website=The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only limitations might come from the rules in a parent organization or from national, state, or local law. An example of a rule that organizations sometimes adopt is one that allows the use of [[proxy voting]]. Such a rule is not allowed unless the organization specifically provides for it in its bylaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2020|p=407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other parliamentary authorities ===
Parliamentarians have estimated that about 85 to 95 percent of organizations in the United States use ''Robert's Rules of Order''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:14&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Notes and Comments&quot;/&gt; The remaining percentage of organizations use other books on meeting procedures. Notable examples of such books on [[parliamentary authority]] include ''[[The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure]]'', ''[[Demeter's Manual of Parliamentary Law and Procedure]]'', and ''[[Riddick's Rules of Procedure]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; These books along with ''Robert's Rules of Order'' share the general idea of rule of the majority with respect for the minority. A difference may be a &quot;simplification&quot; of the rules. Henry M. Robert III responded to the simplification by saying the following:&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

{{Quote|text = In an effort to make parliamentary procedure more widely accessible, known, and employed, the approach of “simplification” unfortunately resurrects the very problem that Robert's Rules first emerged to solve. When there are large gaps in the rules, one or more of three major problems occur: much time is spent in debating what the rules are or should be, the chair unilaterally imposes a result, or the majority imposes a result that frequently disregards the rights of the minority.
When virtually everyone agrees, an assembly may be able to get by without resort to elaborate rules. When there is serious division, however, it is in human nature that each side will attempt to construe any ambiguity in the rules in such a way as to foster its substantive objectives. The ideal is that the rules applicable to a contentious subject are so clear that the contending sides cannot plausibly differently interpret them to their own advantage. Only then does parliamentary law fully play its role as the neutral arbiter that channels disputes into productive debate over substance, instead of time-wasting and manipulative maneuvering over procedure.|sign = |source = }}Also in response to the simplification was the publication of a supplemental guide to the official book (see [[#In Brief|''In Brief'']]).

=== Consensus decision-making ===
In modern parliamentary procedure, the usual practice is having a proposal first, then discussion on this proposal with any modifications to it, and finally a vote on it, with majority vote deciding the issue if there are any disagreements. An alternative to this process is [[consensus decision-making]]. In this alternative, discussion of potential proposals is held first, followed by the framing of a proposal, and then modifying it until the group reaches a consensus, when there is no longer any disagreement.

As a response to this alternative, the authors of ''Robert's Rules of Order'' stated their belief in using debate and majority vote as part of the process in making decisions for the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2020|p=xlviii}}: &quot;Robert saw, on the other hand, that the evolution of majority vote in tandem with lucid and clarifying debate—resulting in a decision representing the view of the deliberate majority—far more clearly ferrets out and demonstrates the will of an assembly.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Legislature}}
{{Politics sidebar|Organs}}

A '''legislature''' is a [[deliberative assembly]] with the [[authority]] to make [[law]]s for a [[Polity|political entity]] such as a [[Sovereign state|country]] or [[city]]. Legislatures form important parts of most [[government]]s; in the [[separation of powers]] model, they are often contrasted with the [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[Judiciary|judicial]] branches of government.

Laws enacted by legislatures are usually known as [[primary legislation]]. In addition, legislatures may observe and steer governing actions, with authority to amend the [[budget]] involved.

The members of a legislature are called [[legislator]]s. In a [[democracy]], legislators are most commonly popularly [[Election|elected]], although [[indirect election]] and appointment by the executive are also used, particularly for [[bicameralism|bicameral]] legislatures featuring an [[upper chamber]].

== Terminology ==

[[File:Legislation Terminology Map.png|thumb|upright=1.8|right|Map showing the terminology for each country's national legislature]]

The name used to refer to a legislative body varies by country.

Common names include:

* Assembly (from ''to assemble'')
* Congress (from ''to congregate'')
* Diet (from old German 'people')
* Duma (from Russian ''dúma'' 'thought')
* Estates or States (from old French 'condition' or 'status')
* Parliament (from French ''parler'' 'to speak')
Though the specific roles for each legislature differ by location, they all aim to serve the same purpose of appointing officials to represent their citizens to determine appropriate legislation for the country.

== History ==
Among the earliest recognised legislatures was the [[Athens|Athenian]] ''[[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]].''&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; In the [[Middle Ages]], European monarchs would host assemblies of the nobility, which would later develop into predecessors of modern legislatures.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; These were often named [[The Estates]]. The oldest surviving legislature is the [[Iceland]]ic [[Althing]], founded in 930 CE.

== Functions ==
Democratic legislatures have six major functions: representation, deliberation, legislation, authorizing expenditure, making governments, and oversight.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hague, Rod, author.|title=Political science : a comparative introduction|date=14 October 2017|isbn=978-1-137-60123-0|pages=128–130|oclc=961119208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Representation ===
There exist five ways that representation can be achieved in a legislature:&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

* Formalistically: how the rules of the legislature ensure representation of constituents;
* Symbolically: how the constituents perceive their representatives;
* Descriptively: how well the composition of the legilsature matches the demographics of the wider society;
* Substantively: how well representatives actually respond to the needs of their constituents;
* Collectively: how well the representatives represent the interests of the society as a whole.

=== Deliberation ===
One of the major functions of a legislature is to discuss and debate issues of major importance to society.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; This can take place in two forms. In debating legislatures, like [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], there is lively debate on the floor of the legislature.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Contrastingly, in committee-based legislatures like the [[United States Congress]], the deliberation takes place in closed committees.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

=== Legislation ===
While legislatures have nominally the sole power to create laws, the substantive extent of this power depends on details of the political system. In [[Westminster system|Westminster-style]] legislatures the executive (composed of the cabinet) can essentially pass any laws it wants, as it usually has a majority of legislators behind it, kept in check by the party whip, while committee-based legislatures in [[continental Europe]] and those in [[presidential system]]s of the [[Americas]] have more independence in drafting and amending bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hague, Rod, author.|title=Political science : a comparative introduction|date=14 October 2017|isbn=978-1-137-60123-0|pages=130–131|oclc=961119208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Authorizing expenditure ===
The origins of the [[power of the purse]] which legislatures typically have in passing or denying [[government budget]]s goes back to the European assemblies of nobility which the [[monarch]]s would have to consult before raising taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hague, Rod, author.|title=Political science : a comparative introduction|date=14 October 2017|isbn=978-1-137-60123-0|pages=131–132|oclc=961119208}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this power to be actually effective, the legislature should be able to amend the budget, have an effective committee system, enough time for consideration, as well as access to relevant background information.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

=== Making governments ===
The power of the legislature over the government is stronger

=== Oversight ===
There are several ways in which the legislature can hold the government accountable, including [[Question time|questioning]], [[Interpellation (politics)|interpellations]], and [[Motion of no confidence|votes of confidence]].

=== Function in authoritarian regimes ===
In contrast to [[Democracy|democratic]] systems, legislatures under [[authoritarianism]] are used to ensure the stability of the power structure by co-opting potential competing interests within the elites, which they achieve (cap) by:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hague, Rod, author.|title=Political science : a comparative introduction|date=14 October 2017|isbn=978-1-137-60123-0|oclc=961119208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Providing legitimacy;
* Incorporating opponents into the system;
* Providing some representation of outside interests;
* Offering a way to recruit new members to the ruling clique;
* Being a channel through which limited grievances and concessions can be passed.

== Internal organization ==
Each chamber of the legislature consists of a number of legislators who use some form of [[parliamentary procedure]] to debate political issues and vote on proposed legislation. There must be a certain number of legislators present to carry out these activities; this is called a [[quorum]].

Some of the responsibilities of a legislature, such as giving first consideration to newly proposed legislation, are usually delegated to [[committee]]s made up of a few of the members of the chamber(s).

The members of a legislature usually represent different [[Political party|political parties]]; the members from each party generally meet as a [[caucus]] to organize their internal affairs.

==Relation to other branches of government==
Legislatures vary widely in the amount of [[Politics|political]] [[Power (social and political)|power]] they wield, compared to other political players such as [[Judiciary|judiciaries]], [[Military|militaries]], and [[Executive (government)|executives]]. In 2009, political scientists [[Steven Fish|M. Steven Fish]] and Matthew Kroenig constructed a Parliamentary Powers Index in an attempt to quantify the different degrees of power among national legislatures. The German [[Bundestag]], the [[Italian Parliament]], and the Mongolian [[State Great Khural]] tied for most powerful, while Myanmar's [[House of Representatives (Myanmar)|House of Representatives]] and Somalia's [[Transitional Federal Parliament|Transitional Federal Assembly]] (since replaced by the [[Federal Parliament of Somalia]]) tied for least powerful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The handbook of national legislatures: a global survey|last1=Fish|first1=M. Steven|last2=Kroenig|first2=Matthew|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-521-51466-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some political systems follow the principle of [[legislative supremacy]], which holds that the legislature is the supreme branch of government and cannot be bound by other institutions, such as the judicial branch or a written [[constitution]]. Such a system renders the legislature more powerful.

In [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] and [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] systems of [[government]], the [[Executive branch|executive]] is responsible to the legislature, which may remove it with a [[Motion of no confidence|vote of no confidence]]. On the other hand, according to the [[separation of powers]] doctrine, the legislature in a [[presidential system]] is considered an independent and coequal branch of government along with both the [[Judicial branch|judiciary]] and the executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Governing Systems and Executive-Legislative Relations (Presidential, Parliamentary and Hybrid Systems) |publisher=United Nations Development Programme |url=http://www.undp.org/governance/docs/Parl-Pub-govern.htm |access-date=2008-10-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017164441/http://www.undp.org/governance/docs/Parl-Pub-govern.htm |archive-date=2008-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, many presidential systems provide for the [[impeachment]] of the executive for criminal or unconstitutional behaviour.

Legislatures will sometimes delegate their legislative power to [[Administrative agency|administrative]] or [[Executive agency|executive agencies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schoenbrod&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Schoenbrod |first= David | editor-first=Ronald |editor-last=Hamowy |editor-link=Ronald Hamowy |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism |chapter= Delegation  |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC  |year=2008 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]; [[Cato Institute]] |location= Thousand Oaks, CA |doi=10.4135/9781412965811.n74 |isbn= 978-1-4129-6580-4 |oclc=750831024| lccn = 2008009151 |pages= 117–18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
Legislatures are made up of individual members, known as [[legislator]]s, who [[Voting|vote]] on proposed laws. A legislature usually contains a fixed number of legislators; because legislatures usually meet in a specific room filled with seats for the legislators, this is often described as the number of &quot;seats&quot; it contains. For example, a legislature that has 100 &quot;seats&quot; has 100 members. By extension, an [[electoral district]] that elects a single legislator can also be described as a &quot;seat&quot;, as, for, example, in the phrases &quot;[[safe seat]]&quot; and &quot;[[marginal seat]]&quot;.

After election, the members may be protected by [[parliamentary immunity]] or [[parliamentary privilege]], either for all actions the duration of their entire term, or for just those related to their legislative duties.

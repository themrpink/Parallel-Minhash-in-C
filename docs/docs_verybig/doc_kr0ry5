===Ecotopian fiction===
In ''ecotopian fiction'', the author posits either a utopian or dystopian world revolving around environmental conservation or destruction. Danny Bloom coined the term &quot;cli fi&quot; in 2006, with a Twitter boost from [[Margaret Atwood]] in 2011, to cover [[Climate fiction|climate change-related fiction]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/MargaretAtwood/status/194460287187959808 &quot;Margaret Atwood - Twitter]&lt;/ref&gt; but the theme has existed for decades. Novels dealing with [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], such as [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s ''[[Make Room! Make Room!]]'' (made into movie ''[[Soylent Green]]''), were popular in the 1970s, reflecting the popular concern with the effects of overpopulation on the environment. The novel ''Nature's End'' by [[Whitley Strieber]] and [[James Kunetka]] (1986) posits a future in which overpopulation, pollution, climate change, and resulting superstorms, have led to a popular mass-suicide political movement. Some other examples of ecological dystopias are depictions of Earth in the films ''[[Wall-E]]'' and [[Avatar (2009 film)|''Avatar'']].

While eco-dystopias are more common, a small number of works depicting what might be called eco-utopia, or eco-utopian trends, have also been influential. These include [[Ernest Callenbach]]'s ''[[Ecotopia (novel)|Ecotopia]]'', an important 20th century example of this genre. [[Kim Stanley Robinson]] has written a number of books dealing with environmental themes, including the [[Mars trilogy]]. Most notably, however, his ''[[Three Californias Trilogy]]'' contrasted an eco-dystopia with an eco-utopia, and a sort of middling-future. Robinson has also edited an anthology of short ecotopian fiction, called ''[[Future Primitive: The New Ecotopias]]''.

There are a few dystopias that have an &quot;anti-ecological&quot; theme.  These are often characterized by a government that is overprotective of nature or a society that has lost most modern technology and struggles for survival. A good example of this is the novel ''[[Riddley Walker]]''.

===Feminist utopias===
Another subgenre is ''feminist utopias'' and the overlapping category of [[feminist science fiction]]. According to the author [[Sally Miller Gearhart]], “A feminist utopian novel is one which ''a.'' contrasts the present with an envisioned idealized society (separated from the present by time or space), ''b.'' offers a comprehensive critique of present values/conditions, ''c.'' sees men or [[Patriarchy|male institutions]] as a major cause of present social ills, ''d.'' presents women as not only at least the equals of men but also as [[Reproductive rights|the sole arbiters of their reproductive functions]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/womeninsearchofu0000unse/page/296|title=Women in Search of Utopia: Mavericks and Mythmakers|last=Gearhart|first=Sally Miller|publisher=Shoken Books|year=1984|isbn=0805239006|editor-last=Baruch|editor-first=Elaine Hoffman|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/womeninsearchofu0000unse/page/296 296]|chapter=Future Visions: Today’s Politics: Feminist Utopias in Review|editor-last2=Rohrlich|editor-first2=Ruby}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/feminist-utopia-dystopia-3529060|title=A Look at Feminist Utopia and Dystopia Literature|last=Napikoski|first=Linda|website=ThoughtCo|access-date=2019-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utopias have explored the ramification of gender being either a societal construct or a hard-wired imperative.&lt;ref name=WSEncyc1442&gt;{{cite book|title=Women's studies encyclopedia|last=Tierney|first=Helen|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|page=[https://archive.org/details/womensstudiesenc0001unse/page/1442 1442]|isbn=978-0-313-31073-7|url=https://archive.org/details/womensstudiesenc0001unse/page/1442}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mary Gentle]]'s ''[[Golden Witchbreed]]'', gender is not chosen until maturity, and gender has no bearing on social roles. In contrast, [[Doris Lessing]]'s ''[[The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five]]'' (1980) suggests that men's and women's values are inherent to the sexes and cannot be changed, making a compromise between them essential. In ''My Own Utopia'' (1961) by [[Elisabeth Mann Borgese]], gender exists but is dependent upon age rather than sex &amp;mdash; genderless children mature into women, some of whom eventually become men.&lt;ref name=WSEncyc1442/&gt; [[Marge Piercy]]'s novel ''[[Woman on the Edge of Time]]'' keeps human biology, but removes pregnancy and childbirth from the gender equation by resorting to [[assisted reproductive technology]] while allowing both women and men the nurturing experience of [[breastfeeding]].

Utopic [[single-gender world]]s or single-sex societies have long been one of the primary ways to explore implications of gender and gender-differences.&lt;ref name=DGinSF13/&gt; One solution to [[sociology of gender|gender oppression]] or [[social issue]]s in feminist utopian fiction is to remove men, either showing isolated all-female societies as in [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]]'s ''[[Herland (novel)|Herland]]'', or societies where men have died out or been replaced, as in [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''A Few Things I Know About Whileaway'', where &quot;the poisonous binary gender&quot; has died off.  In speculative fiction, female-only worlds have been imagined to come about by the action of disease that wipes out men, along with the development of technological or mystical method that allow female [[parthenogenesis|parthenogenetic reproduction]]. The resulting society is often shown to be utopian by feminist writers. Many influential feminist utopias of this sort were written in the 1970s;&lt;ref name=DGinSF13&gt;Attebery, p. 13. {{Incomplete short citation|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=erotic1189&gt;[[Gaétan Brulotte]] &amp; John Phillips, ''Encyclopedia of Erotic Literature'', &quot;Science Fiction and Fantasy&quot;, p.1189, CRC Press, 2006, {{ISBN|1-57958-441-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =Utop101/&gt; the most often studied examples include Joanna Russ's ''[[The Female Man]]'', [[Suzy McKee Charnas]]'s ''[[The Holdfast Chronicles]]''.&lt;ref name =Utop101&gt;Martha A. Bartter, ''The Utopian Fantastic'', &quot;Momutes&quot;, Robin Anne Reid, p.101 {{ISBN|0-313-31635-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such worlds have been portrayed most often by lesbian or feminist authors; their use of female-only worlds allows the exploration of female independence and freedom from [[patriarchy]]. The societies may not necessarily be lesbian, or sexual at all &amp;mdash; ''Herland'' (1915) by Charlotte Perkins Gilman is a famous early example of a sexless society.&lt;ref name=erotic1189/&gt; Charlene Ball writes in ''Women's Studies Encyclopedia'' that use of speculative fiction to explore gender roles has been more common in the United States than in Europe and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=WSEncyc1442/&gt;

Utopias imagined by male authors have generally included equality between sexes, rather than separation.&lt;ref name=Utop102&gt;Martha A. Bartter, ''The Utopian Fantastic'', &quot;Momutes&quot;, Robin Anne Reid, p.102 ISBN&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist dystopias have become prevalent in [[young adult fiction]], or YA, in recent years,{{According to whom|date=September 2020}} focusing on the relationship between gender identity and the teenager. For instance, the ''Birthmarked'' trilogy by [[Caragh M. O'Brien]] focuses on a teenage midwife in a future post-apocalyptic world while the second novel in the series places the teenage heroine Gaia in a [[matriarchy]].

==Cultural impact==
[[Étienne Cabet]]'s work ''Travels in Icaria'' caused a group of followers to leave France in 1848 and travel to the United States to start a series of utopian settlements in Texas, Illinois, Iowa, California, and elsewhere. These groups lived in communal settings and lasted until 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tyboomakbook.org/download.php?title=travels%20in%20icaria%20utopianism%20and%20communitarianism%20paperback%20.pdf|title=Travels In Icaria Utopianism And Communitarianism Paperback|website=tyboomakbook.org|language=EN|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[White House]] '''National Security Council''' ('''NSC''') is the principal forum used by the [[President of the United States]] for consideration of [[national security]], military, and [[Foreign relations of the United States|foreign policy]] matters with senior national security advisors and [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]] officials and is part of the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States]]. Since its inception under [[Harry S. Truman]], the function of the Council has been to advise and assist the President on national security and foreign policies. The Council also serves as the President's principal arm for coordinating these policies among various government agencies. The Council has counterparts in the [[national security councils]] of many other nations.

==History==
{{main|History of the United States National Security Council}}

The immediate predecessor to the National Security Council was the [[National Intelligence Authority (United States)|National Intelligence Authority]] (NIA), which was established by President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s Executive Letter of January 22, 1946, to oversee the Central Intelligence Group, the CIA's predecessor. The NIA was composed of the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]], the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]], and the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief]].

The National Security Council was created in 1947 by the [[National Security Act of 1947|National Security Act]]. It was created because policymakers felt that the diplomacy of the State Department was no longer adequate to contain the [[Soviet Union]], in light of the tension between the Soviet Union and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QHDkqb-myscC&amp;pg=PA499 Encyclopedia of American foreign policy], 2nd ed. Vol. 2, New York: Scribner, 2002, National Security Council, 22 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The intent was to ensure coordination and concurrence among the [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] and other instruments of national security policy such as the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), also created in the National Security Act. In 2004, the position of Director of National Intelligence (DNI) was created, taking over the responsibilities previously held by the head of CIA, the Director of Central Intelligence, as a cabinet-level position to oversee and coordinate activities of the [[United States Intelligence Community|Intelligence Community]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/directors-of-central-intelligence-as-leaders-of-the-u-s-intelligence-community/chapter_15.htm Directors of Central Intelligence as Leaders of the US Intelligence Community], Douglas F.

On May 26, 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] merged the White House staff supporting the [[Homeland Security Council]] (HSC) and the National Security Council into one National Security Staff (NSS). The HSC and NSC each continue to exist by statute as bodies supporting the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/27/us/27homeland.html?ref=us |title=In Security Shuffle, White House Merges Staffs |author= Helene Cooper |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date= May 26, 2009 |access-date= March 15, 2017 |author-link=Helene Cooper }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the staff organization was changed back to National Security Council Staff in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2014/02/10/nsc-staff-name-back-so-long-nss|title=NSC Staff, the Name Is Back!

On January 29, 2017, President [[Donald Trump]] restructured the Principals Committee (a subset of the full National Security Council), while at the same time altering the attendance of the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] and [[Director of National Intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/01/29/512295108/with-national-security-council-shakeup-steve-bannon-gets-a-seat-at-the-table|author= Merrit Kennedy| title=With National Security Council Shakeup, Steve Bannon Gets A Seat At The Table| date=January 29, 2017 |publisher=[[NPR]]| access-date= January 29, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''National Security Presidential Memorandum 2'', the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] and [[Director of National Intelligence]] were to sit on the Principals Committee as and when matters pertaining to them arise, but will remain part of the full National Security Council.&lt;ref name=&quot;Presidential Memorandum &quot;&gt;{{cite press release|title=Presidential Memorandum Organization of the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/28/presidential-memorandum-organization-national-security-council-and|publisher = Office of the Press Secretary |access-date= January 31, 2017|language=en |date=  January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DefenseStatement&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=No Change to Chairman's Status as Senior Military Adviser, Officials Say|url=https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/1064325/no-change-to-chairmans-status-as-senior-military-adviser-officials-say| author= Jim Garamone| publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]]|access-date= January 31, 2017|language=en|date= January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chief of Staff [[Reince Priebus]] clarified the next day that they still are invited to attend meetings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trump chief of staff: defense officials not off NSC after Bannon move&quot;&gt;{{cite news| author= Alan Yuhas |title=Trump chief of staff: defense officials not off NSC after Bannon move|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/29/trump-priebus-nsc-steve-bannon|newspaper = [[The Guardian]]|access-date=January 30, 2017|language=en|date= January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With ''National Security Presidential Memorandum 4'' in April 2017, the [[Director of National Intelligence]] and the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] &quot;shall&quot; attend Principals Committee meetings and included the [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency]] as a regular attendee.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;&gt;[https://www.lawfareblog.com/nspm-4-organization-national-security-council-homeland-security-council-and-subcommittees-summary] [[Lawfare Blog]] NSPM-4: &quot;Organization of the National Security Council, the Homeland Security Council, and Subcommittees&quot;: A Summary&lt;/ref&gt; The reorganization also placed the [[Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development]] as a permanent member of the Deputies Committee, winning moderate praise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maybe the Trump Administration Just Elevated Development Policy, or Maybe Not|url=https://www.cgdev.org/blog/maybe-trump-administration-just-elevated-development-policy-or-maybe-not|author= Scott Morris|publisher=[[Center for Global Development]] |date=February 7, 2017| access-date=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the White House Chief Strategist was removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-04-05/bannon-removed-from-national-security-council-role-in-shakeup| author=Jennifer Jacobs | title = Bannon Loses National Security Council Role in Trump Shakeup| access-date=April 5, 2017 | date =April 5, 2017 | publisher=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Steve Bannon loses National Security Council seat|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39508351|author= BBC|work=BBC News|date=April 6, 2017| access-date=April 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authority and powers==
The National Security Council was established by the [[National Security Act of 1947]] (PL 235 – 61 Stat. 496; U.S.C. 402), amended by the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 579; 50 U.S.C. 401 et seq.). Later in 1949, as part of the Reorganization Plan, the Council was placed in the Executive Office of the President.

The [[High-Value Interrogation Group|High Value Detainee Interrogation Group]] also reports to the NSC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/05/12/elite-high-value-interrogation-unit-taking-painful-steps/ |title= Elite High Value Interrogation Unit Is Taking Its First Painful Steps| author=Ed Barnes| publisher= [[Fox News Channel]]|date= May 12, 2010|access-date= March 15, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kill authorizations===
{{main|Disposition Matrix}}
A secret National Security Council panel pursues the killing of an individual, including American citizens, who has been called a suspected terrorist.&lt;ref name=reu1005&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/05/us-cia-killlist-idUSTRE79475C20111005 | work=[[Reuters]] | title=Secret panel can put Americans on &quot;kill list&quot; |author=Mark Hosenball |date=October 5, 2011 |access-date= March 26, 2017| author-link=Mark Hosenball }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, no public record of this decision or any operation to kill the suspect will be made available.&lt;ref name=reu1005 /&gt; The panel's actions are justified by &quot;two principal legal theories&quot;: They &quot;were permitted by Congress when it [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|authorized the use of military forces against militants]] in the wake of [[9/11|the attacks of September 11, 2001]]; and they are permitted under international law if a country is defending itself.&quot;&lt;ref name=reu1005 /&gt;

Homeland Security Advisor [[John O. Brennan]], who has helped codify targeted killing criteria by creating the [[Disposition Matrix]] database, has described the [[Obama Administration]] targeted killing policy by stating that &quot;in order to ensure that our counterterrorism operations involving the use of lethal force are legal, ethical, and wise, President Obama has demanded that we hold ourselves to the highest possible standards and processes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech |url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/the-efficacy-and-ethics-us-counterterrorism-strategy |title=The Efficacy and Ethics of U.S. Counterterrorism Strategy |author= [[John O.

Reuters has reported that [[Anwar al-Awlaki]], an American citizen, was on such a kill list and was killed accordingly.&lt;ref name=&quot;reu1005&quot;/&gt;

On February 4, 2013, NBC published a leaked Department of Justice [[020413 DOJ White Paper|memo]] providing a summary of the rationale used to justify targeted killing of US citizens who are senior operational leaders of Al-Qa'ida or associated forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url= http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/sections/news/020413_DOJ_White_Paper.pdf |title= Lawfulness of a Lethal Operation Directed Against a U.S. Citizen Who Is a Senior Operational Leader of Al-Qa'ida or An Associated Force |publisher= [[United States Department of Justice]] |access-date= 2013-02-05 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140826075931/http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/sections/news/020413_DOJ_White_Paper.pdf |archive-date= 2014-08-26 |url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

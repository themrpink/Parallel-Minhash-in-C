Berlin voted for both Democratic and Republican presidential candidates,&lt;ref name=&quot;Barrett&quot; /&gt; but he supported the presidential candidacy of General [[Dwight Eisenhower]], and his song &quot;I Like Ike&quot; featured prominently in the Eisenhower campaign. In his later years he also became more conservative in his views on music. According to his daughter, &quot;He was consumed by patriotism.&quot; He often said, &quot;I owe all my success to my adopted country&quot; and once rejected his lawyers' advice to invest in [[tax shelters]], insisting, &quot;I ''want'' to pay taxes. I love this country.&quot;&lt;ref name=McCorkle/&gt;{{rp|80}}

Berlin was a [[Freemason]], and was a member of Munn Lodge no. 190, New York City, the Scottish Rite Valley of New York City, and Mecca Shrine Temple.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYmasons&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nymasons.org/about-freemasonry/famous-masons-i.html |website=Grand Lodge of the State of New York |title=Famous Masons I: Dreamers and Doers |access-date=January 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110010123/http://www.nymasons.org/about-freemasonry/famous-masons-i.html |archive-date=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berlin was a staunch advocate of civil rights. Berlin was honored in 1944 by the National Conference of Christians and Jews for &quot;advancing the aims of the conference to eliminate religious and racial conflict.&quot;&lt;ref name=jonon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amuseum.org/jahf/virtour/page21.html |title=Jewish-American Hall of Fame – Virtual Tour |publisher=Amuseum.org |date=January 15, 2007 |access-date=December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1943 production &quot;This Is The Army&quot;, was the first integrated division army unit in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| url=http://www.pbs.org/michael-feinsteins-american-songbook/irving-berlin-this-is-the-army.php| title=Best Band in the Land: Segregation and Musicals During World War II| series=Michael Feinstein's American Songbook| network=[[PBS]]| air-date=October 13, 2010|access-date=June 5, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, the Young Men's Hebrew Association (YMHA) honored him as one the twelve &quot;most outstanding Americans of Jewish faith.&quot;&lt;ref name=jonon /&gt; While he was ethnically and culturally Jewish, he was religiously agnostic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barrett&quot; /&gt; Berlin's Civil Rights Movement support also made him a target of FBI Director [[J.

==Death==
[[File:Irving Berlin Grave 1024.jpg|thumb|The grave of Irving Berlin in [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx)|Woodlawn Cemetery]], [[the Bronx]], New York City]]
Berlin died in his sleep at his 17 Beekman Place town house in [[Manhattan]] on September 22, 1989, of [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and [[Death by natural causes|natural causes]] at the age of 101. He was interred in the [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[The Bronx]], New York City.&lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt;

On the evening following the announcement of his death, the marquee lights of Broadway playhouses were dimmed before curtain time in his memory. President [[George H. W. Bush]] said Berlin was &quot;a legendary man whose words and music will help define the history of our nation.&quot; Just minutes before the President's statement was released, he joined a crowd of thousands to sing Berlin's &quot;God Bless America&quot; at a luncheon in Boston. Former President [[Ronald Reagan]], who costarred in Berlin's 1943 musical ''This Is the Army,'' said, &quot;Nancy and I are deeply saddened by the death of a wonderfully talented man whose musical genius delighted and stirred millions and will live on forever.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYT9-24/&gt;

[[Morton Gould]], the composer and conductor who was president of the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] (ASCAP), of which Berlin was a founder, said, &quot;What to me is fascinating about this unique genius is that he touched so many people in so many age groups over so many years. He sounded our deepest feelings—happiness, sadness, celebration, loneliness.&quot; [[Ginger Rogers]], who danced to Berlin tunes with [[Fred Astaire]], told The Associated Press upon hearing of his death that working with Berlin had been &quot;like heaven.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYT9-24&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/24/nyregion/berlin-s-work-is-recalled-with-words-and-music.html &quot;Berlin's Work Is Recalled With Words and Music&quot;], ''The New York Times'', September 24, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|After his death, Irving Berlin's three daughters donated the songwriter's musical collection of 750,000 items to the music archives of the Library of Congress.}}

''[[The New York Times]]'', after his death in 1989, wrote, &quot;Irving Berlin set the tone and the tempo for the tunes America played and sang and danced to for much of the 20th century.&quot;  An immigrant from Russia, his life became the &quot;classic rags-to-riches story that he never forgot could have happened only in America.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt; During his career he wrote an estimated 1,500 songs and was a legend by the time he turned 30.&lt;ref name=NYT-Dreaming/&gt; He went on to write the scores for 20 original Broadway shows and 15 original Hollywood films,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; with his songs nominated for [[Academy Awards]] on eight occasions. Music historian [[Susannah McCorkle]] writes that &quot;in scope, quantity, and quality his work was amazing.&quot;&lt;ref name=McCorkle/&gt; Others, such as Broadway musician Anne Phillips, says simply that &quot;the man is an American institution.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cabaret.broadwayworld.com/article/SING_SING_SING_Salutes_Irving_Berlin_At_The_Triad_127_20101103 &quot;SING! SING! SING! Salutes Irving Berlin&quot;] Broadwayworld.com, November 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

During his six-decade career, from 1907 to 1966, he produced sheet music, Broadway shows, recordings, and scores played on radio, in films and on television, and his tunes continue to evoke powerful emotions for millions around the world. He wrote songs like &quot;Alexander's Ragtime Band,&quot; &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot;, &quot;There's No Business Like Show Business&quot;, &quot;Blue Skies&quot; and &quot;Puttin' On the Ritz.&quot; Some of his songs have become holiday anthems, such as &quot;[[Easter Parade (song)|Easter Parade]]&quot;, &quot;[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]&quot; and &quot;[[Happy Holiday (song)|Happy Holiday]]&quot;. &quot;White Christmas&quot; alone sold over 50 million records, the top single selling song in recording history, won an [[ASCAP]] and an [[Academy Award]], and is one of the most frequently played songs ever written.&lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt;

In 1938, &quot;[[God Bless America]]&quot; became the unofficial national anthem of the United States, and on September 11, 2001, members of the House of Representatives stood on the steps of the Capitol and solemnly sang &quot;God Bless America&quot; together. The song returned to no. 1 shortly after 9/11, when [[Celine Dion]] recorded it as the title track of a 9/11 benefit album. The following year, the [[United States Postal Service|Postal Service]] issued a commemorative stamp of Berlin. By then, the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of New York had received more than $10 million in royalties from &quot;God Bless America&quot; as a result of Berlin's donation of royalties.&lt;ref name=NYT-Dreaming/&gt; According to music historian [[Gary Giddins]], &quot;No other songwriter has written as many anthems.... No one else has written as many pop songs, period... [H]is gift for economy, directness, and slang, presents Berlin as an obsessive, often despairing commentator on the passing scene.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Giddins| first=Gary| title=Weather Bird: Jazz at the Dawn of its Second Century| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w-oMvvaaYgwC&amp;q=Weather+Bird:+Jazz+at+the+Dawn+of+its+Second+Century| publisher=Oxford Univ. Press| date=November 15, 2004| isbn=978-0195348163}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|405}}

In 1934, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19340528,00.html|title=''TIME'' Magazine Cover: Irving Berlin| date= May 28, 1934| website=Time| access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; put him on its cover and inside hailed &quot;this itinerant son of a Russian cantor&quot; as &quot;an American institution.&quot;&lt;ref name=DVD&gt;''Irving Berlin: An American Song'', film, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; And again, in 1943, the same magazine described his songs as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;They possess a permanence not generally associated with [[Tin Pan Alley]] products and it is more than remotely possible that in days to come Berlin will be looked upon as the [[Stephen Foster]] of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Life&gt;Frazier, George. ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', April 5, 1943, pgs. 79–88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At various times, his songs were also rallying cries for different causes: He produced musical editorials supporting [[Al Smith]] and [[Dwight Eisenhower]] as presidential candidates, he wrote songs opposing [[Prohibition]], defending the [[gold standard]], calming the wounds of the [[Great Depression]], and helping the war against [[Hitler]], and in 1950 he wrote an anthem for the state of Israel.&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt; Biographer David Leopold adds that &quot;We all know his songs... they are all part of who we are.&quot;

At his 100th-birthday celebration in May 1988, violinist [[Isaac Stern]] said, &quot;The career of Irving Berlin and American music were intertwined forever—American music was born at his piano,&quot;&lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt; while songwriter [[Sammy Cahn]] pointed out: &quot;If a man, in a lifetime of 50 years, can point to six songs that are immediately identifiable, he has achieved something. Irving Berlin can sing 60 that are immediately identifiable... [Y]ou couldn't have a holiday without his permission.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt; Composer [[Douglas Moore]] added:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's a rare gift which sets Irving Berlin apart from all other contemporary songwriters. It is a gift which qualifies him, along with [[Stephen Foster]], [[Walt Whitman]], [[Vachel Lindsay]] and [[Carl Sandburg]], as a great American minstrel. He has caught and immortalized in his songs what we say, what we think about, and what we believe.&lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[ASCAP]]'s records show that 25 of Berlin's songs reached the top of the charts and were re-recorded by dozens of famous singers over the years, such as [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]], [[Al Jolson]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Rosemary Clooney]], [[Doris Day]], [[Diana Ross]], [[Nat King Cole]] and [[Ella Fitzgerald]]. In 1924, when Berlin was 36, his biography, ''The Story of Irving Berlin'', was being written by [[Alexander Woollcott]]. In a letter to Woollcott, [[Jerome Kern]] offered what one writer said &quot;may be the last word&quot; on the significance of Irving Berlin:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Irving Berlin has no ''place'' in American music—he ''is'' American music. Emotionally, he honestly absorbs the vibrations emanating from the people, manners and life of his time and, in turn, gives these impressions back to the world—simplified, clarified and glorified.&lt;ref name=NYT-87/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Composer [[George Gershwin]] (1898–1937) also tried to describe the importance of Berlin's compositions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I want to say at once that I frankly believe that Irving Berlin is the greatest songwriter that has ever lived.... His songs are exquisite cameos of perfection, and each one of them is as beautiful as its neighbor. Irving Berlin remains, I think, America's [[Schubert]]. But apart from his genuine talent for song-writing, Irving Berlin has had a greater influence upon American music than any other one man. It was Irving Berlin who was the very first to have created a real, inherent American music.... Irving Berlin was the first to free the American song from the nauseating sentimentality which had previously characterized it, and by introducing and perfecting ragtime he had actually given us the first germ of an American musical idiom; he had sown the first seeds of an American music.&lt;ref name=Gershwin/&gt;{{rp|117}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Le pétomane du Moulin Rouge (1900).webm|thumb|''Le Pétomane du Moulin Rouge'', 1900 ([[silent film]] clip)]]
'''Joseph Pujol''' (June 1, 1857 – August 8, 1945), best known by his [[stage name]] '''Le Pétomane''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|p|ɛ|t|ə|m|eɪ|n}},{{cn|date=November 2020}} {{IPA-fr|ləpetɔman}}), was a French [[flatulist]] (professional farter) and entertainer. He was famous for his remarkable control of the abdominal muscles, which enabled him to seemingly [[flatulence|fart]] at will. His stage name combines the French verb ''péter'', &quot;to fart&quot; with the -''mane'', &quot;-[[mania]]c&quot; suffix, which translates to &quot;fartomaniac&quot;.  The profession is also referred to as &quot;flatulist&quot;, &quot;farteur&quot;, or &quot;fartiste&quot;.&lt;ref name=retro&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ljhelms.com/pet/_pujol/thestory/retro.htm|title=Le Pétomane: The Strange Life of a &quot;Fartiste&quot;|accessdate=2012-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a common misconception that Joseph Pujol passed intestinal gas as part of his stage performance. Rather, Pujol was allegedly able to &quot;inhale&quot; or move air into his rectum and then control the release of that air with his [[external anal sphincter|anal sphincter]] muscles.  Evidence of his ability to control those muscles was seen in the early accounts of demonstrations of his abilities to fellow soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Alison|last=Moore|title=The Spectacular Anus of Joseph Pujol: Recovering the Pétomane's Unique Historic Context|journal=French Cultural Studies|volume=24|issue=1|date=February 2013|pages=27–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==

Joseph Pujol was born in [[Marseilles]], one of five children of stonemason/sculptor François Pujol and his wife Rose, in a family of [[Catalan people|Catalan]] origin. Soon after he left school, he had a strange experience while swimming in the sea. He put his head under the water and held his breath, whereupon he felt an icy cold penetrating his rear. He ran ashore in fright and was amazed to sense water pouring from his anus. 

While serving in the army, he told his fellow soldiers about his special ability, and repeated it for their amusement, sucking up water from a pan into his rectum and then projecting it up to several yards. He found that he could suck in air as well. A [[baker]], Pujol would sometimes entertain his customers by imitating musical instruments and claim to be playing them behind the counter. Pujol decided to try the stage, and debuted in Marseilles in 1887. When his act was well received, he moved to [[Paris]], where he appeared at the [[Moulin Rouge]] in 1892.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Some of the highlights of his stage act involved sound effects of cannon fire and thunderstorms, as well as playing &quot;[['O Sole Mio]]&quot; and &quot;[[La Marseillaise]]&quot; on an [[ocarina]] through a rubber tube in his anus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/363/did-a-french-vaudeville-star-once-specialize-in-trained-flatulence Did a French vaudeville star once specialize in trained flatulence?] Accessed 2008-12-02&lt;/ref&gt; He could also blow out a candle from several yards away.&lt;ref name=retro /&gt; His audience included [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward, Prince of Wales]]; [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]] of the [[Belgium|Belgians]]; and [[Sigmund Freud]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/science/k2/moments/s364725.htm Begone With the Wind] Accessed 2008-09-01&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1894, the managers of the Moulin Rouge sued Pujol for an impromptu exhibition he gave to aid a friend struggling with economic difficulties. Pujol was fined 3,000 francs, and the Moulin Rouge lost their star attraction as the disagreement led him to set up his own travelling show called the Theatre Pompadour.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;  Moore, A. (2013). The spectacular anus of Joseph Pujol: Recovering the Pétomane’s unique historic context. French Cultural Studies, 24(1), 27–43. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1177/0957155812466975&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following decade Pujol tried to 'refine' and make his acts 'gentler'; one of his favourite numbers became a rhyme about a farm which he himself composed, and which he punctuated with anal renditions of the animals' sounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

With the outbreak of [[World War I]], Pujol retired from the stage and returned to his bakery in Marseilles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rivierareporter.com/features/833-le-petomane-the-mad-farter-joseph-pujol|title=Le Pétomane, The Mad Farter: Joseph Pujol - Riviera Reporter|website=www.rivierareporter.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later he opened a biscuit factory in [[Toulon]]. He died in 1945,&lt;ref&gt;One source says his death occurred &quot;shortly after the Allied landing&quot;, presumably a reference to [[D-Day]], 6 June, but that was in 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; aged 88, and was buried in the cemetery of [[La Valette-du-Var]], where his grave can still be seen today.

==Legacy==

Le Pétomane left an enduring legacy and has inspired a number of artistic works. These include several musicals based on his life, such as ''The Fartiste'' (awarded Best Musical at the 2006 [[New York International Fringe Festival]]) and Seth Rozin's ''A Passing Wind'' which was premiered at the [[Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts|Philadelphia International Festival of the Arts]] in 2011. In addition, Le Pétomane was added to David Lee's 2007 reworked revival of the 1953 Broadway play ''[[Can-Can]]'', which had originally been written by Abe Burroughs and [[Cole Porter]]. The updated play, staged at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]], featured musical theatre actor Robert Yacko as the fartiste, with sound effects provided by the band's trombone and piccolo players. More recently, the re-released works of English toilet humour specialist [[Ivor Biggun]] include &quot;Southern Breeze&quot;, a song about a &quot;Famous French Farteur&quot; who describes in rhyme a stroll through a farmyard, accompanied by appropriate farting noises.{{citation needed|date = October 2014}}

Los Angeles-based Sherbourne Press published Jean Nohain and F. Caradec's ''Le Pétomane'' as a small hardcover English language edition in 1967. Due to its ‘sensitive’ nature, the usual national publicity venues shied away, some claiming that an author was needed for interviews (both elderly writers lived in France). However, ‘behind the curtain’ acceptance created a buzz within the national radio/TV promotional circuit and word-of-mouth discussion kept the book in stores for several years. Dorset Press, a division of [[Barnes &amp; Noble]], reissued the book in 1993.{{citation needed|date = October 2014}}

The character has been portrayed several times in film. In 1979 [[Ian MacNaughton]] made a short humorous film, written by [[Galton and Simpson]] called ''[[Le Pétomane (film)|Le Pétomane]]'', based on Joseph Pujol's story and starring veteran comic actor [[Leonard Rossiter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britmovie.co.uk/films/Le-Petomane_1979/|title=Le Petomane (1979)|work=British movies|publisher=Britmovie.co.uk|accessdate=2009-01-05|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203014504/http://www.britmovie.co.uk/films/Le-Petomane_1979|archivedate=2010-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1983 Italian movie ''[[Petomaniac|Il Petomane]]'', directed by [[Pasquale Festa Campanile]] and starring [[Ugo Tognazzi]], gives a poetic rendition of the character, contrasting his deep longing for normality with the condition of 'freak' to which his act relegated him. The 1998 documentary ''Le Pétomane'' by [[Igor Vamos]] examines Joseph Pujol's place in history through archival films (none of which actually include him), historical documents, photographs, recreations and fake or tongue-in-cheek interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impossiblefunky.com/archives/issue_13/13_lepetomaine.asp?IshNum=13&amp;Headline=Le%20Petomane|title=Le Petomane: Fin de Siècle Fartiste (Igor Vamos, 2000)|last=White|first=Mike|publisher=Cahiers du Cinemart|accessdate=2009-10-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716052020/http://www.impossiblefunky.com/archives/issue_13/13_lepetomaine.asp?IshNum=13&amp;Headline=Le%20Petomane|archive-date=2011-07-16|url-status=dead|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Pétomane is also referenced in ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'', a 1974 satirical Western comedy film directed by [[Mel Brooks]].  Brooks appears in multiple supporting roles, including the dim-witted Governor William J. Le Petomane, whose name suggests he is full of hot air.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brain-sharper.com/entertainment/blazing-saddles-tb/34/&lt;/ref&gt;

Lepetomane University is the name of the educational establishment in ''[[Up the Creek (1984 film)|Up the Creek]]'', a 1984 college movie starring [[Tim Matheson]] involving a [[rafting|white water rafting]] race.

Le Pétomane is also a character in the novel ''[[The Great Abraham Lincoln Pocket Watch Conspiracy]]'' by Jacopo della Quercia.

Le Pétomane also appears as a character in the 2001 Australian-American jukebox musical romantic comedy film ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'', played by Keith Robinson.

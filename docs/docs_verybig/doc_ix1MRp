In [[physics]], '''intensity''' of radiant energy is the [[Power (physics)|power]] transferred per unit [[area]], where the area is measured on the plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the energy. In the [[SI]] system, it has units [[watt]]s per [[square metre]] (W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). It is used most frequently with [[wave]]s such as acoustic waves ([[sound]]) or [[electromagnetic wave]]s such as [[light]] or [[radio wave]]s, in which case the [[time averaging|''average'']] power transfer over one [[Period (physics)|period]] of the wave is used. ''Intensity'' can be applied to other circumstances where energy is transferred. For example, one could calculate the intensity of the [[kinetic energy]] carried by drops of water from a [[garden sprinkler]].

The word &quot;intensity&quot; as used here is not synonymous with &quot;[[wikt:strength|strength]]&quot;, &quot;[[wikt:amplitude|amplitude]]&quot;, &quot;[[wikt:magnitude|magnitude]]&quot;, or &quot;[[wikt:level|level]]&quot;, as it sometimes is in colloquial speech. 

Intensity can be found by taking the [[energy density]] (energy per unit volume) at a point in space and multiplying it by the [[velocity]] at which the energy is moving. The resulting [[Vector (geometry)|vector]] has the units of power divided by area (i.e., [[surface power density]]).

==Mathematical description==
If a [[point source]] is radiating energy in all directions (producing a [[spherical wave]]), and no energy is absorbed or scattered by the medium, then the intensity decreases in proportion to the distance from the object squared. This is an example of the [[inverse-square law]]. 

Applying the law of [[conservation of energy]], if the net power emanating is constant,
:&lt;math&gt;P = \int \mathbf I\, \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf A&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''P'' is the net power radiated, '''I''' is the intensity as a function of position, and d'''A''' is a [[differential element]] of a closed surface that contains the source. 

If one integrates over a surface of uniform intensity ''I'', for instance over a sphere centered around the point source, the equation becomes
:&lt;math&gt;P = |I| \cdot A_\mathrm{surf} = |I| \cdot 4\pi r^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;!-- &quot;\,&quot;: other two equations get PNG treatment --&gt;
where ''I'' is the intensity at the surface of the sphere, and ''r'' is the radius of the sphere. (&lt;math&gt;A_\mathrm{surf} = 4\pi r^2 &lt;/math&gt; is the expression for the surface area of a sphere). 

Solving for ''I'' gives
:&lt;math&gt;|I| = \frac{P}{A_\mathrm{surf}} = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the medium is damped, then the intensity drops off more quickly than the above equation suggests. 

Anything that can transmit energy can have an intensity associated with it. For a monochromatic propagating electromagnetic wave, such as a [[plane wave]] or a [[Gaussian beam]], if ''E'' is the [[complex amplitude]] of the [[electric field]], then the time-averaged [[energy density]] of the wave, travelling in a non-magnetic material, is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle U \right \rangle = \frac{n^2 \varepsilon_0}{2} |E|^2&lt;/math&gt;,
and the local intensity is obtained by multiplying this expression by the wave velocity, c/''n'':
:&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{\mathrm{c} n \varepsilon_0}{2} |E|^2&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''n'' is the [[refractive index]], c is the [[speed of light]] in [[vacuum]] and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity]].

For non-monochromatic waves, the intensity contributions of different spectral components can simply be added. The treatment above does not hold for arbitrary electromagnetic fields. For example, an [[evanescent wave]] may have a finite electrical amplitude while not transferring any power. The intensity should then be defined as the magnitude of the [[Poynting vector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology |title=Optical Intensity |url=https://www.rp-photonics.com/optical_intensity.html |publisher=RP Photonics |first=Rüdiger |last=Paschotta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative definitions of &quot;intensity&quot;==
In [[photometry (optics)|photometry]] and [[radiometry]] ''intensity'' has a different meaning: it is the luminous or radiant power ''per unit [[solid angle]]''. This can cause confusion in [[optics]], where ''intensity'' can mean any of [[radiant intensity]], [[luminous intensity]] or [[irradiance]], depending on the background of the person using the term. [[Radiance]] is also sometimes called ''intensity'', especially by astronomers and astrophysicists, and in [[heat transfer]].

      <text bytes="19079" xml:space="preserve">A '''twin prime''' is a [[prime number]] that is either 2 less or 2 more than another prime number—for example, either member of the twin prime pair (41, 43). In other words, a twin prime is a prime that has a [[prime gap]] of two. Sometimes the term ''twin prime'' is used for a pair of twin primes; an alternative name for this is '''prime twin''' or '''prime pair'''.

Twin primes become increasingly rare as one examines larger ranges, in keeping with the general tendency of gaps between adjacent primes to become larger as the numbers themselves get larger.  However, it is unknown whether there are infinitely many twin primes or there is a largest pair. The work of [[Yitang Zhang]] in 2013, as well as work by [[James Maynard (mathematician)|James Maynard]], [[Terence Tao]] and others, has made substantial progress towards proving that there are infinitely many twin primes, but at present this remains unsolved.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Tao, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp06oGD4m00&amp;t=425 Small and Large Gaps Between the Primes]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{unsolved|mathematics|Are there infinitely many twin primes?}}

==History==
The question of whether there exist infinitely many twin primes has been one of the great open questions in [[number theory]] for many years. This is the content of the '''twin prime conjecture''', which states that there are infinitely many primes ''p'' such that ''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 is also prime. In 1849, [[Alphonse de Polignac|de Polignac]] made the more general conjecture that for every [[natural number]] ''k'', there are infinitely many primes ''p'' such that ''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2''k'' is also prime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Polignac |first1=A. |title=Recherches nouvelles sur les nombres premiers |journal=Comptes rendus |date=1849 |volume=29 |pages=397–401 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015035450967&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=411 |trans-title=New research on prime numbers |language=French}} 
 From p. 400:  ''&quot;1&lt;sup&gt;er&lt;/sup&gt; ''Théorème.''  Tout nombre pair est égal à la différence de deux nombres premiers consécutifs d'une infinité de manières … &quot;'' (1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Theorem.  Every even number is equal to the difference of two consecutive prime numbers in an infinite number of ways … )&lt;/ref&gt; The case&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 of [[de Polignac's conjecture]] is the twin prime conjecture.
 
A stronger form of the twin prime conjecture, the Hardy–Littlewood conjecture (see below), postulates a distribution law for twin primes akin to the [[prime number theorem]].

On April 17, 2013, [[Yitang Zhang]] announced a proof that for some integer ''N'' that is less than 70 million, there are infinitely many pairs of primes that differ by&amp;nbsp;''N''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKee|first=Maggie|title=First proof that infinitely many prime numbers come in pairs|journal=Nature|date=14 May 2013|url=http://www.nature.com/news/first-proof-that-infinitely-many-prime-numbers-come-in-pairs-1.12989|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/nature.2013.12989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang's paper was accepted by ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]'' in early May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Bounded gaps between primes | first = Yitang | last = Zhang | journal = [[Annals of Mathematics]] | year=2014 | volume=179 | issue=3 | pages=1121–1174 | doi=10.4007/annals.2014.179.3.7  | mr=3171761 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terence Tao]] subsequently proposed a [[Polymath Project]] collaborative effort to optimize Zhang's bound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tao|first=Terence|authorlink=Terence Tao|url=http://polymathprojects.org/2013/06/04/polymath-proposal-bounded-gaps-between-primes/|title=Polymath proposal: bounded gaps between primes|date=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of April 14, 2014, one year after Zhang's announcement, the bound has been reduced to 246.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michaelnielsen.org/polymath1/index.php?title=Bounded_gaps_between_primes|title=Bounded gaps between primes|publisher=Polymath|accessdate=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, assuming the [[Elliott–Halberstam conjecture]] and its generalized form, the Polymath project wiki states that the bound has been reduced to 12 and 6, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; These improved bounds were discovered using a different approach that was simpler than Zhang's and was discovered independently by James Maynard and Terence Tao. This second approach also gave bounds for the smallest ''f''(''m'') needed to guarantee that infinitely many intervals of width ''f''(''m'') contain at least ''m'' primes.

==Properties==
Usually the pair (2, 3) is not considered to be a pair of twin primes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://primes.utm.edu/lists/small/100ktwins.txt The First 100,000 Twin Primes]&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2 is the only even prime, this pair is the only pair of prime numbers that differ by one; thus twin primes are as closely spaced as possible for any other two primes.

The first few twin prime pairs are:
:(3,  5), (5,  7), (11, 13), (17, 19), (29, 31), (41, 43), (59, 61), (71, 73),  (101, 103), (107, 109), (137, 139), … {{OEIS2C|id=A077800}}.

Five is the only prime that belongs to two pairs.

Every twin prime pair except &lt;math&gt;(3, 5)&lt;/math&gt; is of the form &lt;math&gt;(6n-1, 6n+1)&lt;/math&gt; for some [[natural number]] ''n''; that is, the number between the two primes is a multiple of 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://primes.utm.edu/notes/faq/six.html | title=Are all primes (past 2 and 3) of the forms 6n+1 and 6n-1? | last=Caldwell | first=Chris K. | website=The Prime Pages | publisher=The University of Tennessee at Martin | access-date=2018-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the sum of any pair of twin primes (other than 3 and 5) is divisible by 12.

===Brun's theorem===
{{Main|Brun's theorem}}
In 1915, [[Viggo Brun]] showed that the sum of reciprocals of the twin primes was convergent.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | jfm=45.0330.16 | last=Brun | first=V. | authorlink=Viggo Brun | title=Über das Goldbachsche Gesetz und die Anzahl der Primzahlpaare | language=German | journal=Archiv for Mathematik og Naturvidenskab| volume=34 | number=8 | pages=3–19 | year=1915 | issn=0365-4524 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This famous result, called [[Brun's theorem]], was the first use of the [[Brun sieve]] and helped initiate the development of modern [[sieve theory]].  The modern version of Brun's argument can be used to show that the number of twin primes less than ''N'' does not exceed

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{CN}{(\log N)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

for some absolute constant ''C''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.&lt;ref name=BD313&gt;Bateman &amp; Diamond (2004) p.&amp;nbsp;313&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it is bounded above by :&lt;math&gt;\frac{C'N}{(\log N)^2}\left(1 + O\left(\frac{\log \log N}{\log N}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C' = 8C_2&lt;/math&gt;, where ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the '''twin prime constant''', given [[#First Hardy–Littlewood conjecture|below]].&lt;ref&gt;Heini Halberstam, and Hans-Egon Richert, ''Sieve Methods'', p.&amp;nbsp;117, Dover Publications, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other theorems weaker than the twin prime conjecture==
In 1940, [[Paul Erdős]] showed that there is a [[Mathematical constant|constant]] ''c''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1 and infinitely many primes ''p'' such that {{nowrap|(''p''′&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p'')&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;(''c''&amp;nbsp;ln&amp;nbsp;''p'')}} where ''p''′ denotes the next prime after&amp;nbsp;''p''. What this means is that we can find infinitely many intervals that contain two primes {{nowrap|(''p'',''p''′)}} as long as we let these intervals grow slowly in size as we move to bigger and bigger primes. Here, &quot;grow slowly&quot; means that the length of these intervals can grow logarithmically. This result was successively improved; in 1986 [[Helmut Maier]] showed that a constant ''c''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0.25 can be used.  In 2004 [[Daniel Goldston]] and [[Cem Yıldırım]] showed that the constant could be improved further to ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.085786…  In 2005, Goldston, [[János Pintz]] and Yıldırım established that ''c'' can be chosen to be arbitrarily small,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

:&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{n\to\infty}\frac{p_{n+1}-p_n}{\log p_n}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, this result does not rule out that there may not be infinitely many intervals that contain two primes if we only allow the intervals to grow in size as, for example, {{nowrap|''c''&amp;nbsp;ln&amp;nbsp;ln&amp;nbsp;''p''}}.

By assuming the [[Elliott–Halberstam conjecture]] or a slightly weaker version, they were able to show that there are infinitely many ''n'' such that at least two of ''n'', ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2, ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;6, ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;8, ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;12, ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;18, or ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;20 are prime.  Under a stronger hypothesis they showed that for infinitely many ''n'', at least two of&amp;nbsp;''n'', ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2, ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4, and ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;6 are prime.

The result of [[Yitang Zhang]],

:&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{n\to\infty}(p_{n+1}-p_n)&lt;N\;\text{ with }\;N=7\times10^7,&lt;/math&gt;

is a major improvement on the Goldston–Graham–Pintz–Yıldırım result. The [[Polymath Project]] optimization of Zhang's bound and the work of Maynard has reduced the bound to ''N'' = 246.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Conjectures==

===First Hardy–Littlewood conjecture===

The '''Hardy–Littlewood conjecture''' (named after [[G. H. Hardy]] and [[John Edensor Littlewood|John Littlewood]]) is a generalization of the twin prime conjecture.  It is concerned with the distribution of [[prime constellation]]s, including twin primes, in analogy to the [[prime number theorem]]. Let π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') denote the number of primes ''p'' ≤ ''x'' such that ''p'' + 2 is also prime. Define the '''twin prime constant''' ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OEIS|1=A005597 |2=Decimal expansion of the twin prime constant| accessdate = 2019-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C_2 = \prod_{\textstyle{p\;{\rm prime}\atop p \ge 3}} \left(1 - \frac{1}{(p-1)^2}\right) \approx 0.66016 18158 46869 57392 78121 10014\dots&lt;/math&gt;

(here the product extends over all prime numbers ''p'' ≥ 3). Then a special case of the first Hardy-Littlewood conjecture is that

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_2(x) \sim 2 C_2 \frac{x}{(\ln x)^2} \sim 2 C_2 \int_2^x {dt \over (\ln t)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

in the sense that the quotient of the two expressions [[limit of a function|tends to]] 1 as ''x'' approaches infinity.&lt;ref name=BD3345&gt;Bateman &amp; Diamond (2004) pp.334–335&lt;/ref&gt;  (The second ~ is not part of the conjecture and is proven by [[integration by parts]].)

The conjecture can be justified (but not proven) by assuming that 1 / ln ''t'' describes the [[density function]] of the prime distribution. This assumption, which is suggested by the prime number theorem, implies the twin prime conjecture, as shown in the formula for π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') above.

The fully general first Hardy–Littlewood conjecture on [[prime k-tuple|prime ''k''-tuple]]s (not given here) implies that the [[second Hardy–Littlewood conjecture|''second'' Hardy–Littlewood conjecture]] is false.

This conjecture has been extended by [[Dickson's conjecture]].

===Polignac's conjecture===
{{more citations|section|date=August 2020}}
[[Polignac's conjecture]] from 1849 states that for every positive even natural number ''k'', there are infinitely many consecutive prime pairs ''p'' and ''p′'' such that ''p''′&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k'' (i.e. there are infinitely many [[prime gap]]s of size&amp;nbsp;''k''). The case ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 is the '''twin prime conjecture'''. The conjecture has not yet been proven or disproven for any specific value of&amp;nbsp;''k'', but Zhang's result proves that it is true for at least one (currently unknown) value of ''k''. Indeed, if such a ''k'' did not exist, then for any positive even natural number ''N'' there are at most finitely many ''n'' such that ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m'' for all ''m''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''N'' and so for ''n'' large enough we have ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''N'', which would contradict Zhang's result. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Polignac |first1=A. |title=Recherches nouvelles sur les nombres premiers |journal=Comptes rendus |date=1849 |volume=29 |pages=397-401 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015035450967&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=411 |trans-title=New research on prime numbers |language=French}}

==Large twin primes==
Beginning in 2007, two [[distributed computing]] projects, [[Twin Prime Search]] and [[PrimeGrid]], have produced several record-largest twin primes.  {{As of|2018|9}}, the current largest twin prime pair known is 2996863034895 · 2&lt;sup&gt;1290000&lt;/sup&gt; ± 1,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primes.utm.edu/primes/page.php?id=122213|title=The Prime Database: 2996863034895*2^1290000-1|first=Chris K.|last=Caldwell|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 388,342 decimal digits.

There are 808,675,888,577,436 twin prime pairs below 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OEIS|1=A007508 |2=Number of twin prime pairs below 10^n | accessdate = 2019-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ieeta.pt/~tos/primes.html | title = Tables of values of pi(x) and of pi2(x) | author = Tomás Oliveira e Silva | publisher = [[Aveiro University]] | date = 7 April 2008 | accessdate = 7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An empirical analysis of all prime pairs up to 4.35 · 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; shows that if the number of such pairs less than &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt; is f(&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;)·&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;/(log &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; then f(&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;) is about 1.7 for small &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt; and decreases towards about 1.3 as &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt; tends to infinity. The limiting value of f(&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;) is conjectured to equal twice the twin prime constant ({{OEIS2C|id=A114907}}) (not to be confused with [[Brun's constant]]), according to the Hardy–Littlewood conjecture.

==Other elementary properties==
Every third odd number is divisible by 3, which requires that no three successive odd numbers can be prime unless one of them is 3. Five is therefore the only prime that is part of two twin prime pairs. The lower member of a pair is by definition a [[Chen prime]].

It has been proven that the pair (''m'',&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2) is a twin prime if and only if

:&lt;math&gt;4((m-1)! + 1) \equiv -m \pmod {m(m+2)}.&lt;/math&gt;

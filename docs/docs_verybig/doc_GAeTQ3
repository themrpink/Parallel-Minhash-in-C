[[Image:Schist detail.jpg|thumb|Schist specimen showing the characteristic &quot;scaly&quot; schistose texture, caused by platy micas]]

'''Schist''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ʃ|ɪ|s|t}} {{respell|SHIST|'}}) is a medium-[[Metamorphism#Metamorphic grades|grade]] [[metamorphic rock]] formed from mudstone or [[shale]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GeologyDictionary&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theodora.com/geology/glossarys.html#schist |title=Schist definition |work=Dictionary of Geology |accessdate=2013-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schist has medium to large, flat, sheet-like grains in a preferred orientation (nearby grains are roughly parallel). It is defined by having more than 50% [[Crystal habit#List of crystal habits|platy]] and elongated minerals (such as micas or talc),&lt;ref name=&quot;Glossary&quot;&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfnSesBc-RgC&amp;q=schist+definition+50%25+platy+-study&amp;pg=PA577 | title=Glossary of Geology | publisher=Springer | author=Jackson J.A., Mehl J.P. &amp; Neuendorf K.K.E. | year=2005 | page=577 | isbn=9780922152766}}&lt;/ref&gt; often finely interleaved with quartz and [[feldspar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge Guide&quot;&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SnianWtB5WgC&amp;q=schist+quartz+feldspar+interleaved&amp;pg=PA153 | title=Cambridge Guide to Minerals, Rocks and Fossils | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | author=Bishop A.C., Woolley A.R. &amp; Hamilton W.R. | year=1999 | page=153 | isbn=9780521778817}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lamellar (flat, planar) [[mineral]]s include [[mica]]s, [[Chlorite group|chlorite]], [[talc]], [[hornblende]], [[graphite]], and others. [[Quartz]] often occurs in drawn-out grains to such an extent that a particular form called quartz schist is produced. Schist is often [[garnet]]iferous. Schist forms at a higher temperature and has larger grains than [[phyllite]].&lt;ref name=EG/&gt; Geological [[Foliation (geology)|foliation]] (metamorphic arrangement in layers) with medium to large grained flakes in a preferred sheetlike orientation is called ''schistosity''.&lt;ref name=EG&gt;Essentials of Geology, 3rd Ed, Stephen Marshak&lt;/ref&gt;

The names of various schists are derived from their mineral constituents. For example, schists primarily composed of [[biotite]] and [[muscovite]] are called mica schists.&lt;ref name=&quot;GeologyDictionary&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Earth science|last=J.|first=Tarbuck, Edward|date=2012|publisher=Prentice Hall/Pearson|others=Lutgens, Frederick K.|isbn=978-0321688507|edition=13th|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|oclc=693684089}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most schists are mica schists, but graphite and chlorite schists are also common. Schists are also named for their prominent or perhaps unusual mineral constituents, as in the case of [[garnet]] schist, [[tourmaline]] schist, and [[glaucophane]] schist.

The individual [[mineral]] grains in schist, drawn out into flaky scales by heat and pressure, can be seen with the naked eye. Schist is characteristically ''foliated'', meaning that the individual mineral grains split off easily into flakes or slabs. The word schist is derived ultimately from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''σχίζειν'' (''schízein'') meaning &quot;to split&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;OD&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/schist | title=Schist | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | work=English Dictionary | accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a reference to the ease with which schists can be split along the plane in which the platy minerals lie.

Most schists are derived from [[clay]]s and [[mud]]s that have passed through a series of metamorphic processes involving the production of [[shale]]s, [[slate]]s and [[phyllite]]s as intermediate steps. Certain schists are derived from fine-grained [[igneous rock]]s such as [[basalt]]s and [[tuff]]s.

==Historical mining terminology==
Before the mid-18th century, the terms slate, shale and schist  were not sharply differentiated by those involved with mining.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Raymond, Slate, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FpqFAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA78 A Glossary of Mining and Metallurigical Terms], American Institute of Mining Engineers, 1881, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
During metamorphism, rocks which were originally sedimentary, igneous or metamorphic are converted into schists and [[gneiss]]es. If the composition of the rocks was originally similar, they may be very difficult to distinguish from one another if the metamorphism has been great. A [[quartz-porphyry]], for example, and a fine grained feldspathic sandstone, may both be converted into a grey or pink mica-schist.  Usually, however, it is possible to distinguish between sedimentary and igneous schists and gneisses. If, for example, the whole district occupied by these rocks has traces of bedding, [[clastic]] structure, or [[Unconformity|unconformability]], then it may be a sign that the original rock was sedimentary. In other cases [[Intrusive rock|intrusive]] junctions, chilled edges, contact alteration or porphyritic structure may prove that in its original condition a metamorphic gneiss was an igneous rock. The last appeal is often to the chemistry, for there are certain rock types which occur only as sediments, while others are found only among igneous masses, and however advanced the metamorphism may be, it rarely modifies the chemical composition of the mass very greatly. Such rocks as [[limestone]]s, [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]]s, [[quartzite]]s, and aluminous shales have very definite chemical characteristics that distinguish them even when completely recrystallized.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Petrology |volume=21 |page=333 |inline=1 |first=John Smith |last=Flett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The schists are classified principally according to the minerals they consist of and on their chemical composition. For example, many metamorphic limestones, marbles, and calc-schists, with crystalline dolomites, contain silicate minerals such as mica, [[tremolite]], [[diopside]], [[scapolite]], quartz and [[feldspar]]. They are derived from calcareous sediments of different degrees of purity. Another group is rich in quartz (quartzites, quartz schists and quartzose gneisses), with variable amounts of white and black mica, [[garnet]], feldspar, [[zoisite]] and [[hornblende]]. These were once sandstones and arenaceous rocks. The graphitic schists may readily be believed to represent sediments once containing coal or plant remains; there are also schistose [[ironstone]]s ([[hematite]]-schists), but metamorphic beds of salt or [[gypsum]] are exceedingly uncommon. Among schists of igneous origin there are the silky calc-schists, the foliated [[Serpentine group|serpentine]]s (once [[ultramafic]] masses rich in [[olivine]]), and the white mica-schists, porphyroids and banded [[halleflinta]]s, which have been derived from [[rhyolite]]s, quartz-porphyries and felsic [[tuff]]s. The majority of mica-schists, however, are altered [[claystone]]s and shales, and pass into the normal sedimentary rocks through various types of [[phyllite]] and mica-slates. They are among the most common metamorphic rocks; some of them are [[Graphite|graphitic]] and others calcareous. The diversity in appearance and composition is very great, but they form a well-defined group not difficult to recognize, from the abundance of black and white micas and their thin, foliated, schistose character. A subgroup is the [[andalusite]]-, [[staurolite]]-, [[kyanite]]- and [[sillimanite]]-schists which usually make their appearance in the vicinity of gneissose granites, and have presumably been affected by contact metamorphism.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Engineering considerations==
In [[geotechnical engineering]] a schistosity plane often forms a [[Discontinuity (Geotechnical engineering)|discontinuity]] that may have a large influence on the mechanical behavior (strength, deformation, etc.) of rock masses in, for example, [[tunnel]], [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]], or [[Slope stability analysis|slope]] construction.

'''Uraninite''', formerly '''pitchblende''', is a [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]], [[uranium]]-rich [[mineral]] and [[ore]] with a [[chemical composition]] that is largely [[uranium dioxide|UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], but due to [[oxidation]] the mineral typically contains variable proportions of [[Triuranium octoxide|U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]]. Additionally, due to [[radioactive decay]], the ore also contains [[oxide]]s of [[lead]] and trace amounts of [[helium]]. It may also contain [[thorium]] and [[rare earth elements]].&lt;ref name=Klein/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;

==Overview==
Uraninite used to be known as pitchblende (from ''[[pitch (resin)|pitch]]'', because of its black color, and ''blende'', from ''blenden'' meaning &quot;to deceive&quot;, a term used by German miners to denote minerals whose density suggested metal content, but whose exploitation, at the time they were named, was either unknown or not economically feasible). The mineral has been known at least since the 15th century from silver mines in the [[Ore Mountains]], on the German/Czech border. The [[type locality (geology)|type locality]] is the historic mining and spa town known as Joachimsthal, the modern day [[Jáchymov]], on the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] side of the mountains, where F. E. Brückmann described the mineral in 1772.&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;2003Veselovsky&quot; &gt;{{Cite journal

All uraninite minerals contain a small amount of [[radium]] as a [[radioactive decay]] product of uranium. [[Marie Curie]] used pitchblende, processing tons of it herself, as the source material for her isolation of radium in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://history.aip.org/history/exhibits/curie/|title=Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity|publisher=history.aip.org|access-date=2017-06-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628203314/http://history.aip.org/history/exhibits/curie/|archive-date=2017-06-28|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uraninite also always contains small amounts of the [[Isotopes of lead|lead isotopes]] &lt;sup&gt;206&lt;/sup&gt;Pb and &lt;sup&gt;207&lt;/sup&gt;Pb, the end products of the decay series of the uranium isotopes &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U and &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U respectively. Small amounts of [[helium]] are also present in uraninite as a result of [[alpha decay]]. Helium was first found on Earth in uraninite after having been discovered [[spectroscopy|spectroscopically]] in the [[Sun#Atmosphere|Sun's atmosphere]]. The extremely rare elements [[technetium]] and [[promethium]] can be found in uraninite in very small quantities (about 200&amp;nbsp;[[Kilogram#SI multiples|pg]]/kg and 4&amp;nbsp;[[Femtogram|fg]]/kg respectively), produced by the [[spontaneous fission]] of [[uranium-238]]. Francium can also be found in uraninite at 1 [[francium]] atom for every 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; uranium atoms in the ore as a result from the decay of [[actinium]].

==Occurrence==
[[File:Uraninite-usa32abg.jpg|thumb|left|Uraninite crystals from [[Topsham, Maine]] (size: 2.7&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2.4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;1.4 cm)]]

Uraninite is a major [[ore]] of [[uranium]]. Some of the highest grade uranium ores in the world were found in the [[Shinkolobwe]] mine in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (the initial source for the [[Manhattan Project]]) and in the [[Athabasca Basin]] in northern [[Saskatchewan]], Canada.  Another important source of pitchblende is at [[Great Bear Lake]] in the [[Northwest Territories]] of Canada, where it is found in large quantities associated with [[silver]]. It also occurs in [[Australia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]], [[England]], [[Rwanda]], [[Namibia]] and [[South Africa]]. In the United States, it can be found in the states of [[Arizona]], [[Colorado]], [[Connecticut]], [[Maine]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Mexico]], [[North Carolina]] and [[Wyoming]]. The geologist [[Charles Steen]] made a fortune on the production of uraninite in his Mi Vida mine in [[Moab, Utah]].

Uranium ore is generally processed close to the mine into [[yellowcake]], which is an intermediate step in the processing of uranium.

'''Hornblende''' is a complex [[silicate minerals#Inosilicates|inosilicate]] series of [[mineral]]s (ferrohornblende – magnesiohornblende).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mindat.org/min-8789.html Mindat&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a recognized mineral in its own right, but the name is used as a general or field term, to refer to a dark [[amphibole]].

The general formula is {{chem2|(Ca,Na)_{2–3}(Mg,Fe,Al)5(Al,Si)8O22(OH,F)2}}.

== Compositional variances ==
Some metals vary in their occurrence and magnitude:&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt;
* [[Manganese]] and [[titanium]] are often present.
* [[Sodium]] and [[potassium]] are often present and [[fluorine]] often substitutes for the [[hydroxyl]] in the crystalline structure.

== Physical properties ==
Hornblende has a [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|hardness]] of 5–6, a [[specific gravity]] of 2.9–3.4 and is typically an opaque green, greenish-brown, brown or black color.

Its [[cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]] angles are at 56 and 124 degrees. It is most often confused with various [[pyroxene]] minerals and [[biotite]] mica, which are black and can be found in [[granite]] and in [[charnockite]].

==Occurrence==
Hornblende is a common constituent of many [[igneous rock|igneous]] and [[metamorphic rocks]] such as [[granite]], [[syenite]], [[diorite]], [[gabbro]], [[basalt]], [[andesite]], [[gneiss]], and [[schist]].

It is the principal mineral of [[amphibolite]]s. Very dark brown to black hornblendes that contain titanium are ordinarily called [[basalt]]ic hornblende, from the fact that they are usually a constituent of basalt and related rocks. Hornblende alters easily to [[chlorite group|chlorite]] and [[epidote]].

A rare variety of hornblende contains less than 5% of [[iron oxide]], is gray to white in color, and is named [[edenite]] from its locality in Edenville, [[Orange County, New York]].

Other minerals in the hornblende series include:
* [[pargasite]]
* [[hastingsite]]
* [[tschermakite]]
* [[edenite]]

==Etymology==
The word hornblende is derived from the [[German language|German]] ''horn'' and ''blenden'', to 'deceive' in allusion to its similarity in appearance to metal-bearing ore minerals.&lt;ref name=HBM&gt;[http://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/doclib/hom/ferrohornblende.pdf Handbook of Mineralogy]&lt;/ref&gt;

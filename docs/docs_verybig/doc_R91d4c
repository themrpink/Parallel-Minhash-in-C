===Metric system===
[[File:578metric-micrometer.jpg|thumb|Micrometer thimble with a reading of 5.78{{nbsp}}±{{nbsp}}0.005{{nbsp}}mm.]]

The spindle of an ordinary metric micrometer has 2 threads per millimetre, and thus one complete revolution moves the spindle through a distance of 0.5 millimeter. The longitudinal line on the sleeve is graduated with 1 millimetre divisions and 0.5 millimetre subdivisions. The thimble has 50 graduations, each being 0.01 millimetre (one-hundredth of a millimetre). Thus, the reading is given by the number of millimetre divisions visible on the scale of the sleeve plus the particular division on the thimble which coincides with the axial line on the sleeve.

Suppose that the thimble were screwed out so that graduation 5, and one additional 0.5 subdivision were visible on the sleeve (as shown in the image), and that graduation 28 on the thimble coincided with the axial line on the sleeve. The reading then would be 5.00 + 0.5 + 0.28 = 5.78&amp;nbsp;mm.

===Vernier micrometers===
[[File:5783metric-micrometer.jpg|thumb|Vernier micrometer reading 5.783{{nbsp}}±{{nbsp}}0.001{{nbsp}}mm, comprising 5.5{{nbsp}}mm on main screw lead scale, 0.28{{nbsp}}mm on screw rotation scale, and 0.003{{nbsp}}mm added from vernier.]]
Some micrometers are provided with a [[vernier scale]] on the sleeve in addition to the regular graduations. These permit measurements within 0.001{{nbsp}}millimetre to be made on metric micrometers, or 0.0001&amp;nbsp;inches on inch-system micrometers.

The additional digit of these micrometers is obtained by finding the line on the sleeve vernier scale which exactly coincides with one on the thimble. The number of this coinciding vernier line represents the additional digit.

Thus, the reading for metric micrometers of this type is the number of whole millimeters (if any)  and the number of hundredths of a millimeter, as with an ordinary micrometer, and the number of thousandths of a millimeter given by the coinciding vernier line on the sleeve vernier scale.

For example, a measurement of 5.783{{nbsp}}millimetres would be obtained by reading 5.5{{nbsp}}millimetres on the sleeve, and then adding 0.28{{nbsp}}millimetre as determined by the thimble. The vernier would then be used to read the 0.003 (as shown in the image).

Inch micrometers are read in a similar fashion.

Note: 0.01 millimeter = 0.000393&amp;nbsp;inch, and 0.002{{nbsp}}millimeter = 0.000078&amp;nbsp;inch (78 millionths) or alternatively, 0.0001&amp;nbsp;inch = 0.00254{{nbsp}}millimeters. Therefore, metric micrometers provide smaller measuring increments than comparable inch unit micrometers—the smallest graduation of an ordinary inch reading micrometer is 0.001&amp;nbsp;inch; the vernier type has graduations down to 0.0001&amp;nbsp;inch (0.00254&amp;nbsp;mm). When using either a metric or inch micrometer, without a vernier, smaller readings than those graduated may of course be obtained by visual interpolation between graduations.

==Torque repeatability via torque-limiting ratchets or sleeves==
{{original research|section|date=September 2016}}
A micrometer reading is not accurate if the thimble is over- or under-[[torque]]d. A useful feature of many micrometers is the inclusion of a torque-limiting device on the thimble—either a spring-loaded ratchet or a friction sleeve. Without this device, workers may overtighten the micrometer on the work, causing the mechanical advantage of the screw to tighten the screw threads or squeeze the material, giving an inaccurate measurement. However, with a thimble that will ratchet or friction slip at a certain torque, the micrometer will not continue to advance once sufficient resistance is encountered. This results in greater accuracy and repeatability of measurements—most especially for low-skilled or semi-skilled workers, who may not have developed the light, consistent touch of a skilled user.

{{Anchor|Low but consistent torque}} It might seem that there would be no such thing as too ''little'' torque on the thimble, because if zero tightening of the threads is the goal, then the less torque, the better. However, there is a practical limit on this ideal. Some tiny amount of torque, although very slight, is involved in the normal hand movements of well-practiced micrometer use. It is light but not truly zero, because zero is impractical for a skillful feel of how the contact is being made. And the [[#Calibration: testing and adjusting|calibration]] reflects this amount, as tiny as it is. If one then changes to an &quot;afraid to even touch it&quot; sort of [[wikt:gingerliness#Noun|gingerliness]], one is being inconsistent with the norm that the calibration reflects, resulting in a reading that is 1 to 3 [[thousandth of an inch#Tenths|tenths]] too big (on a typical metal part).

Related to this torque topic is interuser variation in what is normal. It is important to try not to have an [[wikt:idiosyncratic#Adjective|idiosyncratic]] touch, because although it works perfectly well for intrauser consistency, it interferes with interuser consistency. Some people use a rather heavy touch as a matter of habit, and this is fine in that they can get highly accurate readings as long as they calibrate their micrometer accordingly. The problem arises when they use someone else's micrometer, or when someone uses theirs. The heavy-touch user gets false-small readings, and the normal-touch user gets false-big readings. This may not arise in one-person shops, but teams of workers sharing company-owned instruments must be capable of interpersonal consistency to do close-tolerance work successfully. There is a good and easy way to synchronize on this topic: it is simply to get used to the &quot;feel&quot; of how much torque it takes to slip the typical friction sleeve or click the typical ratchet thimble—and then incorporate that same feel into every use of a micrometer, even those that have no sleeve or ratchet. This is proper training for the machining trade, although it is not uncommon to encounter coworkers who were not well trained on this point. In many cases it seems that in drilling the &quot;don't overtorque&quot; idea into trainees' heads, an opposite extreme is mistakenly taught, where the user thinks the goal is to compete with everyone else on who can generate the lightest touch. Individuals naturally differ in their touch, so such a competition is not as effective at generating interuser consistency as is &quot;imagining that every thimble has a sleeve to slip.&quot;

Bench micrometers of the &quot;super-mic&quot; class entirely removes this interuser variation by having the user dial the handwheel until a needle reads zero on a gauge, producing the same pressure on every reading.

==Calibration: testing and adjusting==

===Zeroing===
On most micrometers, a small [[wrench#spanner wrench|pin spanner]] is used to turn the sleeve relative to the barrel, so that its zero line is repositioned relative to the markings on the thimble. There is usually a small hole in the sleeve to accept the spanner's pin. This calibration procedure will cancel a zero error: the problem that the micrometer reads nonzero when its jaws are closed.

===Testing===
A standard one-inch micrometer has readout divisions of 0.001&amp;nbsp;inch and a rated accuracy of ±0.0001&amp;nbsp;inch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starrett.com/download/222_p1_5.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716132738/http://www.starrett.com/download/222_p1_5.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-16 }}
GENERAL MICROMETER INFORMATION&lt;/ref&gt; (&quot;[[thou (length)#In machining|one tenth]]&quot;, in machinist parlance). 
Both the measuring instrument and the object being measured should be at room temperature for an accurate measurement; dirt, abuse, and low operator skill are the main sources of error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mahr.de/index.php?NodeID=13120 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719060139/http://www.mahr.de/index.php?NodeID=13120 |archivedate=2011-07-19 }}
MICROMETER ACCURACY: Drunken Threads and Slip-sticks&lt;/ref&gt;

The accuracy of micrometers is checked by using them to measure [[gauge block]]s,&lt;ref&gt;BS EN ISO 3650: &quot;Geometrical product specifications (GPS). Length standards. Gauge blocks&quot; (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; rods, or similar standards whose lengths are precisely and accurately known. If the gauge block is known to be 0.75000{{nbsp}}±{{nbsp}}0.00005{{nbsp}}inch (&quot;seven-fifty plus or minus fifty millionths&quot;, that is, &quot;seven hundred fifty thou plus or minus half a tenth&quot;), then the micrometer should measure it as 0.7500{{nbsp}}inch. If the micrometer measures 0.7503{{nbsp}}inch, then it is out of calibration. Cleanliness and [[#Low but consistent torque|low (but consistent) torque]] are especially important when calibrating—each tenth (that is, ten-thousandth of an inch), or hundredth of a millimeter, &quot;counts&quot;; each is important. A mere speck of dirt, or a mere bit too much squeeze, obscure the truth of whether the instrument is able to read correctly. The solution is simply [[wikt:conscientious#Adjective|conscientiousness]]—cleaning, patience, due care and attention, and repeated measurements (good repeatability assures the calibrator that his/her technique is working correctly).

Calibration typically checks the error at 3 to 5 points along the range. Only one can be adjusted to zero. If the micrometer is in good condition, then they are all ''so near to zero'' that the instrument seems to read essentially &quot;-on&quot; all along its range; no noticeable error is seen at any locale. In contrast, on a worn-out micrometer (or one that was poorly made to begin with), one can &quot;chase the error up and down the range&quot;, that is, ''move'' it up or down to any of various locales along the range, by adjusting the sleeve, but one cannot ''eliminate'' it from all locales at once.

Calibration can also include the condition of the tips (flat and parallel), any ratchet, and linearity of the scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archived copy|url=http://ittc.sname.org/2006_recomm_proc/7.6-02-04.res.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005092058/http://ittc.sname.org/2006_recomm_proc/7.6-02-04.res.pdf|archivedate=2011-10-05|accessdate=2011-08-04}} ITTC – Recommended Procedures : Sample Work Instructions Calibration of Micrometers.&lt;/ref&gt; Flatness and parallelism are typically measured with a gauge called an optical flat, a disc of glass or plastic ground with extreme accuracy to have flat, parallel faces, which allows light bands to be counted when the micrometer's anvil and spindle are against it, revealing their amount of geometric inaccuracy.

Commercial machine shops, especially those that do certain categories of work (military or commercial aerospace, nuclear power industry, medical, and others), are required by various [[standards organization]]s (such as [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]], [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]],&lt;ref name=&quot;B89.1.13 - Micrometers&quot;&gt;[https://www.asme.org/products/codes-standards/b89113-2013-micrometers ASME B89.1.13 - 2013 Micrometers].&lt;/ref&gt; [[ASTM International|ASTM]], [[SAE International|SAE]], [[Aerospace Industries Association|AIA]], [[United States Military Standard|the U.S. military]], and others) to calibrate micrometers and other gauges on a schedule (often annually), to affix a label to each gauge that gives it an ID number and a calibration expiration date, to keep a record of all the gauges by ID number, and to specify in inspection reports which gauge was used for a particular measurement.

Not all calibration is an affair for metrology labs. A micrometer can be calibrated on-site anytime, at least in the most basic and important way (if not comprehensively), by measuring a high-grade gauge block and adjusting to match. Even gauges that are calibrated annually and within their expiration timeframe should be checked this way every month or two, if they are used daily. They usually will check out OK as needing no adjustment.

The accuracy of the gauge blocks themselves is traceable through a chain of comparisons back to a master standard such as the [[International prototype of the metre|international prototype of the meter]]. This bar of metal, like the [[:File:CGKilogram.jpg|international prototype of the kilogram]], is maintained under controlled conditions at the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] headquarters in France, which is one of the principal [[measurement standards laboratory|measurement standards laboratories]] of the world. These master standards have extreme-accuracy regional copies (kept in the national laboratories of various countries, such as [[NIST]]), and metrological equipment makes the chain of comparisons. Because the definition of the meter is now based on a light wavelength, the international prototype of the meter is not quite as indispensable as it once was. But such master gauges are still important for calibrating and certifying metrological equipment. Equipment described as &quot;NIST traceable&quot; means that its comparison against master gauges, and their comparison against others, can be traced back through a chain of documentation to equipment in the NIST labs. Maintaining this degree of traceability requires some expense, which is why NIST-traceable equipment is more expensive than non-NIST-traceable. But applications needing the highest degree of quality control mandate the cost.

===Adjustment===
A micrometer that has been zeroed and tested and found to be off might be restored to accuracy by further adjustment. If the error originates from the parts of the micrometer being worn out of shape and size, then restoration of accuracy by this means is not possible; rather, repair (grinding, lapping, or replacing of parts) is required. For standard kinds of instruments, in practice it is easier and faster, and often no more expensive, to buy a new one rather than pursue refurbishment

{{Transitivity and Valency}}
In [[grammar]], a '''ditransitive''' (or '''bitransitive''') '''verb''' is a [[verb]] which takes a [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and two [[object (grammar)|object]]s which refer to a [[Thematic relation|theme]] and a recipient. According to certain linguistics considerations, these objects may be called ''direct'' and ''indirect'', or ''primary'' and ''secondary''.  This is in contrast to [[monotransitive verb]]s, which take only one object, a direct or primary object.

In languages which mark [[grammatical case]], it is common to differentiate the objects of a ditransitive verb using, for example, the [[accusative case]] for the direct object, and the [[dative case]] for the indirect object (but this morphological alignment is not unique; see below). In languages without morphological case (such as English for the most part) the objects are distinguished by word order and/or context.

==In English==
English has a number of generally ditransitive verbs, such as ''give'', ''grant'', and ''tell'' and many [[transitive verb]]s that can take an additional argument (commonly a beneficiary or target of the action), such as ''pass'', ''read'', ''bake'', etc.:

:''He gave Mary ten dollars.''
:''He passed Paul the ball.''
:''Jean read him the books.''
:''She is baking him a cake.''
:''I am mailing Sam some lemons.''

Alternatively, English grammar allows for these sentences to be written with a [[preposition]] (''to'' or ''for''): (See also [[Dative shift]])

:''He gave ten dollars to Mary.''
:''He passed the ball to Paul.''
:''Jean read the books to/for him.''
:''She is baking a cake for him.''
:''I am mailing some lemons to Sam.'', etc.

The latter form is grammatically correct in every case, but in some dialects the former (without a preposition) is considered ungrammatical, or at least unnatural-sounding, when the direct object is a pronoun (as in ''He gave me it'' or ''He gave Fred it'').

Sometimes one of the forms is perceived as wrong for idiosyncratic reasons ([[idiom]]s tend to be fixed in form) or the verb simply dictates one of the patterns and excludes the other:

:''*Give a break to me'' (grammatical, but always phrased ''Give me a break'')
:''*He introduced Susan his brother'' (usually phrased ''He introduced his brother to Susan'')

In certain dialects of English, many verbs not normally treated as ditransitive are allowed to take a second object that shows a beneficiary, generally of an action performed for oneself.

:''Let's catch ourselves some fish'' (which might also be phrased ''Let's catch some fish for ourselves''{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}})

This construction could also be an extension of a reflexive construction.

In addition, certain ditransitive verbs can also act as monotransitive verbs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/internet-grammar/function/ditr.htm|title=Ditransitive Verbs @ The Internet Grammar of English|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&quot;David told ''the children'' a story&quot; – Ditransitive
:&quot;David told ''a story'' – Monotransitive

===Passive voice===

Many ditransitive verbs have a [[passive voice]] form which can take a direct object. Contrast the active and two forms of the passive:

Active:
:''Jean gave the books to him.''
:''Jean gave him the books.''

Passive:
:''The books were given to him by Jean.''
:''He was given the books by Jean.''

Not all languages have a passive voice, and some that do have one (e.g. [[Polish language|Polish]]) don't allow the indirect object of a ditransitive verb to be promoted to subject by passivization, as English does. In others like Dutch a passivization is possible but requires a different auxiliary: &quot;krijgen&quot; instead of &quot;worden&quot;.

E.g. ''schenken'' means &quot;to donate, to give&quot;:

:Active: ''Jan schonk hem de boeken'' – John donated the books to him.
:Passive: ''De boeken '''werden''' door Jan aan hem geschonken.''
:Pseudo-passive: ''Hij '''kreeg''' de boeken door Jan geschonken.''

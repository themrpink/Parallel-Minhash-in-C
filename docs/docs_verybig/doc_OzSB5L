Published in the July 1938 issue of ''Astounding Science Fiction'', &quot;Language for Time Travelers&quot; won de Camp the first non-fiction readership monthly honor awarded in the magazine for his exploration of the communication difficulties for time travelers as pronunciation and semantics shift over time.&lt;ref name=Moskowitz /&gt;

De Camp's pioneering [[biography|biographies]] of fantasy writers were many short articles and full-length studies of [[Robert E. Howard]] and [[H. P. Lovecraft]], the first major independent biographies of both writers. Matthew Hartman, in a review of de Camp's ''Lovecraft: A Biography'', stated that de Camp &quot;does not defend his subject; he criticizes where criticism is due, and he explains in historical and sociological context, rather than attempting to excuse.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hartman, M.&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hartman|first1=Matthew|title=De Camp, L.

For instance, [[Mark Finn]], author of ''[[Blood &amp; Thunder: The Life &amp; Art of Robert E. Howard]]'', contends that de Camp deliberately framed his questions in regard to Howard to elicit answers matching his [[Freudian]] theories about him.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Brian.

==Awards and honors==
De Camp and [[Willy Ley]] won the 1953 [[International Fantasy Award]] for nonfiction recognizing their study of geographical myths, ''[[Lands Beyond]]'' (Rinehart, 1952).&lt;ref name=&quot;Power&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=SFAwards/&gt; De Camp was a guest of honor at the 1966 [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]]&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;/&gt; and was named the third [[Gandalf Award|Gandalf Grand Master]] of Fantasy, after [[Tolkien]] and [[Fritz Leiber]], at the 1976 convention.&lt;ref name=SFAwards/&gt; The [[Science Fiction Writers of America]] made him its fourth [[SFWA Grand Master]] in 1979&lt;ref name=SFWA/&gt; and he won the [[World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement]] in 1984,&lt;ref name=SFAwards/&gt; a Special Achievement [[Sidewise Award for Alternate History]] in 1996, citing &quot;seminal works in the field,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SWfAH&quot;/&gt; and the [[Hugo Award]] for Nonfiction in 1997 for his autobiography, ''[[Time and Chance: an Autobiography|Time and Chance]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=SFAwards/&gt;

At a meeting of the executive council of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI)]] in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], in April 2011, De Camp was selected for inclusion in CSI's Pantheon of Skeptics.  The Pantheon of Skeptics was created by CSI to remember the legacy of deceased fellows of CSI and their contributions to the cause of scientific skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pantheon of Skeptics|url=http://www.csicop.org/about/the_pantheon_of_skeptics|website=CSI|publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]|accessdate=30 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131054129/http://www.csicop.org/about/the_pantheon_of_skeptics|archivedate=31 January 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CSI was previously known as the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CSICOP becomes CSI after thirty years|url=http://www.csicop.org/about/csi.html|website=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815024758/http://www.csicop.org/about/csi.html|archivedate=15 August 2009|date=20 November 2006|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{In popular culture|date=February 2018}}
L. Sprague de Camp has been depicted in fictional works by a number of other authors. [[Randall Garrett]] conflated him with [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[Gandalf]] in the character of the magician &quot;Sir Lyon Gandolphus Gray&quot; in his [[Lord Darcy]] series. He was the model for the &quot;Geoffrey Avalon&quot; character in Isaac Asimov's fictional group of mystery solvers the &quot;[[Black Widowers]],&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Asimov1994-120&quot;/&gt; and the unnamed court magician in [[Lawrence Watt-Evans]]' &quot;Return to Xanadu&quot; (''[[The Enchanter Completed: A Tribute Anthology for L. Sprague de Camp]]'', 2005).

He also appears without fictional disguise in the short stories &quot;Green Fire&quot; by [[Eileen Gunn]], [[Andy Duncan (writer)|Andy Duncan]], [[Pat Murphy (writer)|Pat Murphy]], and [[Michael Swanwick]] (''[[Asimov's Science Fiction]]'', April, 2000) and &quot;Father Figures&quot; by [[Susan Shwartz]] (''The Enchanter Completed: A Tribute Anthology for L. Sprague de Camp'', 2005),&lt;ref&gt;Stableford, Brian. ''Science Fact and Science Fiction: an Encyclopedia''. New York: Routledge, c2006, page 125.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the novels ''[[In the Courts of the Crimson Kings]]'' (2008) by [[S. M. Stirling]] and ''[[The Astounding, the Amazing, and the Unknown]]'' (2011) by [[Paul Malmont]].

A semi-fictionalized version of de Camp appears in the third episode of the 2017 TV series ''[[Manhunt: Unabomber]]'', as one of several academics and authors consulted by the FBI on the basis of the citation of their work in the [[Unabomber manifesto]]. In the scene depicting this meeting, de Camp's name appears on a placard as &quot;L. Sprague de Camp, [[Swordsmen and Sorcerers' Guild of America|S.A.G.A.]] Author, ''The Ancient Engineers''.&quot; De Camp's name does not specifically appear in the episode credits, which identify the roles of actors in the scene as composite characters. ''The Ancient Engineers'' is cited in endnote 18 of the manifesto.

'''''Sixth Column''''', also known under the title '''''The Day After Tomorrow''''', is a [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[Robert A. Heinlein]], based on a story by editor [[John W. Campbell]], and set in a United States that has been conquered by the PanAsians, who are asserted to be neither Japanese nor Chinese. Originally published as a serial in ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' (January, February, March 1941, using the [[pen name]] Anson MacDonald) it was published in hardcover in 1949. It is most known for its race-based premise.

==Plot summary==
A top secret research facility hidden in the [[Colorado]] mountains is the last remaining outpost of the [[United States Army]] after its defeat by the [[Pan-Asianism|PanAsians]]. The conquerors had absorbed the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] after being attacked by them and had then gone on to absorb [[India]] as well. The invaders are ruthless and cruel. As an example, they crush an abortive rebellion by killing 150,000 American civilians as punishment. Noting that the invaders have allowed the [[Freedom of religion|free practice of religion]] (the better to pacify their slaves), the Americans set up their own church in order to build a [[resistance movement]]... a &quot;sixth column&quot;, as opposed to a traitorous [[fifth column]].

The laboratory is in turmoil as the novel begins. All but six of the personnel have died suddenly, due to unknown forces released by an experiment operating within the newly discovered [[Magnetogravity wave|magneto-gravitic]] or [[Electrogravitics|electro-gravitic spectra]]. The surviving scientists soon learn that they can selectively kill people by releasing the internal pressure of their cell membranes, among other things. Using this discovery, they construct a race-selective weapon that will stun or kill only Asians.

== Background ==
The idea for the story of ''Sixth Column'' was proposed by [[John W. Campbell]], who had written a similar unpublished story called &quot;All&quot;. Heinlein would later write that he &quot;had to reslant it to remove racist aspects of the original story line&quot; and he would also have to write that he did not &quot;consider it to be an artistic success.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Heinlein, foreword to &quot;Solution Unsatisfactory&quot; in R. A. Heinlein, ''Expanded Universe''. Ace Books, 1981, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heinlein's work on Campbell's &quot;All&quot; was considerably more than just a re-slanting; Campbell's story was felt to be unpublishable as it stood, written in a pseudo-archaic dialect (sometimes inconsistently), and provided no scientific explanations for miraculous powers of the American super-weapons, which the PanAsians have no explanation for other than to conclude that weapons' powers must be divine. Science fiction writer-critic [[George Zebrowski]] believed that Heinlein intended the novel's Calhoun, who, after going insane, believes the false religion created by the Americans, as a parody of Campbell himself.&lt;ref&gt;''The Space Beyond'', Pyramid 1976, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of Heinlein's work on the novel, e.g. the explanations of the weapons’ effectiveness and the strategy for the Americans' rebellion, is not present in &quot;All&quot;.

==Reception==
[[Anthony Boucher|Boucher]] and [[J. Francis McComas|McComas]] found the novel to be &quot;a fine example of serious pulp science fiction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Recommended Reading,&quot; ''[[F&amp;SF]]'', February 1952, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; [[P. Schuyler Miller]] compared ''Sixth Column'' to &quot;the old [[E. Phillips Oppenheim]] or modern [[Eric Ambler]] intrigue, thrust and counterthrust with civilization at stake.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Book Reviews&quot;, [[Astounding Science Fiction|Astounding]], December 1950, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayal of racism==
{{see also|Robert A. Heinlein#Race}}
The book was serialized in early 1941, at a time that the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] was in its fourth year and large parts of China had been occupied in brutal fashion by the Japanese. The book is notable for its frank portrayal of [[racism]] on both sides. The conquerors regard themselves as a chosen people predestined to rule over lesser races, and they refer to white people as slaves. &quot;Three things only do slaves require: work, food, and their religion.&quot; They demand outward signs of respect, such as jumping promptly into the gutter when a member of the chosen race walks by, and the slightest hesitation to show the prescribed courtesies earns a [[swagger stick]] across the face. One character is Frank Mitsui, an [[Asian American]] whose family was murdered by the invaders because they did not fit in the new PanAsiatic racial order. The Americans in the novel respond to their conquerors' racism by often referring to them in unflattering terms, such as &quot;flat face&quot; and &quot;slanty&quot;.

''Sixth Column'' and ''[[Farnham's Freehold]]'', another novel by Heinlein, both center on the issue of race.

He is considered the greatest Italian poet of the nineteenth century and one of the most important figures in the literature of the world, as well as one of the principals of literary [[romanticism]]; his constant reflection on existence and on the [[human condition]]—of [[Sensualism|sensuous]] and [[Materialism|materialist]] inspiration—has also earned him a reputation as a deep philosopher. He is widely seen as one of the most radical and challenging thinkers of the 19th century&lt;ref&gt;[https://newrepublic.com/article/115276/giacomo-leopardis-zibaldone-reviewed-adam-kirsch The Least Known Masterpiece of European Literature], New Republic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/leopardi/projects/index.aspx The Zibaldone project], University of Birmingham&lt;/ref&gt; but routinely compared by Italian critics to his older contemporary [[Alessandro Manzoni]] despite expressing &quot;diametrically opposite positions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sergio Pacifici  |title=Poems and prose |date=1966 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington, Indiana |isbn=0253200946 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he lived in a secluded town in the conservative [[Papal States]], he came into contact with the main ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and through his own literary evolution, created a remarkable and renowned poetic work, related to the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] era.

==Biography==
[[File:Casa natale di Giacomo Leopardi.jpg|thumb|left|The Palazzo Leopardi in [[Recanati]]]]

Leopardi was born into a local noble family in [[Recanati]], in the [[Marche]], at the time ruled by the [[papacy]]. His father, Count [[Monaldo Leopardi]], who was fond of literature and a committed reactionary, remained an advocate of traditional ideals. His mother, Marchioness Adelaide Antici Mattei, was a cold and authoritarian woman, obsessed with rebuilding the family's financial fortunes, which had been destroyed by her husband's gambling addiction. A rigorous discipline of religion and economy reigned in the home. However, Giacomo's happy childhood, which he spent with his younger brother Carlo Orazio and his sister Paolina, left its mark on the poet, who recorded his experiences in the poem ''Le Ricordanze''.

Following a family tradition, Leopardi began his studies under the tutelage of two priests, but his thirst for knowledge was quenched primarily in his father's rich library. Initially guided by Father Sebastiano Sanchini, Leopardi undertook vast and profound reading. These &quot;mad and most desperate&quot; studies included an extraordinary knowledge of classical and philological culture&amp;nbsp;– he could fluently read and write Latin, ancient Greek and Hebrew&amp;nbsp;– but he lacked an open and stimulating formal education.

Between the ages of twelve and nineteen, he studied constantly, driven also by a need to escape spiritually from the rigid environment of the paternal palazzo. His continual studies undermined an already fragile physical constitution, and his illness, probably [[Pott's disease]] or [[ankylosing spondylitis]], denied him youth's simplest pleasures.&lt;ref name=sganzerla&gt;Erik Pietro Sganzerla, ''Malattia e morte di Giacomo Leopardi. Osservazioni critiche e nuova interpretazione diagnostica con documenti inediti'', Booktime, 2016: &quot;Questo libretto rende giustizia a un uomo che soffriva di numerosi problemi fisici, che ebbe una vita non felice e una cartella clinica in cui sono posti in evidenza i sintomi e il loro decorso temporale, l'età d'esordio della progressiva deformità spinale e dei problemi visivi e gastrointestinali, l'influenza delle condizioni psichiche e ambientali nell'accentuazione o remissione dei segnali. […] altamente probabile la diagnosi di Spondilite Anchilopoietica Giovanile&quot; (This booklet does justice to a man who was suffering from numerous physical problems, who had an unhappy life and a medical record in which are highlighted the symptoms and their time course, the age of onset of the progressive spinal deformities and visual and gastrointestinal problems, the influence of psychological and environmental conditions on the accentuation or remission of signals. […] highly likely the diagnosis of Juvenile Ankylosing Spondylitis&quot; (from the Introduction).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1817 the classicist [[Pietro Giordani]] arrived at the Leopardi estate. To Giacomo he became a lifelong friend and derived from this a sense of hope for the future. Meanwhile, his life at Recanati weighed on him increasingly, to the point where he attempted to escape in 1818, but he was caught by his father and brought home. Thereafter relations between father and son continued to deteriorate, and Giacomo was constantly monitored by the rest of the family.

When in 1822 he was briefly able to stay in Rome with his uncle, he was deeply disappointed by its atmosphere of corruption and decadence and by the hypocrisy of the Church. He was impressed by the tomb of [[Torquato Tasso]], to whom he felt bound by a common sense of unhappiness. While [[Ugo Foscolo|Foscolo]] lived tumultuously between adventures, amorous relations, and books, Leopardi was barely able to escape from his domestic oppression. To Leopardi, [[Rome]] seemed squalid and modest when compared to the idealized image that he had created of it.&lt;ref&gt;Giacomo Leopardi, ''A Silvia'', v. 16: le sudate carte.&lt;/ref&gt; He had already suffered disillusionment in love at home, with his cousin Geltrude Cassi. Meanwhile, his physical ailments continued to worsen.

In 1824, a bookstore owner, Stella, called him to Milan, asking him to write several works, including ''Crestomazia della prosa e della poesia italiane''. He moved during this period between [[Milan]], [[Bologna]], [[Florence]] and [[Pisa]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In 1827 in Florence, Leopardi met [[Alessandro Manzoni]], although they did not see things eye to eye. He paid a visit to Giordani and met the historian [[Pietro Colletta]].

In 1828, physically infirm and worn out by work, Leopardi had refused the offer of a professorship in Bonn or Berlin, made by the Ambassador of Prussia in Rome. In the same year, he had to abandon his work with Stella and return to Recanati. In 1830, Colletta offered him a chance to return to Florence, thanks to a financial contribution from the &quot;Friends of Tuscany&quot;. The subsequent printing of the ''Canti'' allowed him to live away from Recanati until 1832. Leopardi found kindred company among the liberals and republicans seeking to liberate Italy from its feudal yoke to Austria. Although his idiosyncratic and pessimistic ideas made him a party of one, he railed against Italy's &quot;state of subjection&quot; and was &quot;in sympathy with the ideals of constitutionalism, republicanism and democracy, and supportive of movements urging Italians to fight for their independence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rosengarten |first1=Frank |title=Giacomo Leopardi's Search for a Common Life Through Poetry |date=2012 |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press |page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later he moved to Naples near his friend [[Antonio Ranieri]], hoping to benefit physically from the climate. He died during the cholera epidemic of 1837, the immediate cause probably being [[pulmonary edema]] or [[heart failure]], due to his fragile physical condition. Thanks to Antonio Ranieri's intervention with the authorities, Leopardi's remains were not buried in a common grave (as the strict hygiene regulations of the time required), but in the atrium of the Church of San Vitale at [[Fuorigrotta]]. In 1898 his tomb was moved to the [[Parco Virgiliano]] and declared a national monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/modernitalianli00collgoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/modernitalianli00collgoog/page/n230 220]|title=Modern Italian Literature|last=Collison-Morley|first=Lacy|date=1 January 1912|publisher=Little, Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WSZHAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=leopardi%27s+tomb+national+monument&amp;pg=PA35|title=Modern Language Notes|date=1 January 1900|publisher=Johns Hopkins Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been speculation in academic circles that Leopardi may have had [[homoromantic]] tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=giM73n_lca4C&amp;q=giacomo+leopardi+homosexual&amp;pg=PA267|title=Who's who in Gay and Lesbian History: From Antiquity to World War II|last1=Aldrich|first1=Robert|last2=Wotherspoon|first2=Garry|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415159821}}&lt;/ref&gt; His intimate friendships with other men, particularly Ranieri, involved expressions of love and desire beyond what was typical even of Romantic poets. In an account of his time in Tuscany, it was written that he &quot;became frenzied about love&quot; whenever in the presence of the handsome younger brother of a woman he and Ranieri both admired (Fanny Targioni-Tozzetti), and that when so frenzied he would direct his sentiments towards Ranieri. In 1830, Leopardi received a letter from [[Pietro Colletta]], nowadays interpreted as a declaration of [[Freemasonry in Italy|masonic]] brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www1.adnkronos.com/Archivio/AdnAgenzia/2005/09/18/Cultura/SCRITTORI-MASSONERIA-E-LETTERATURA-UNO-STRETTO-LEGAME-DA-CARDUCCI-A-CALVINOSCHEDA-2_122004.php | title = Freemasonry and Literature: a close relationship from Carducci to Italo Calvino | date = 18 September 2005 | language = it | website = adnkronos | accessdate = 21 September 2018 | archive-url = https://archive.today/20180922170825/http://www1.adnkronos.com/Archivio/AdnAgenzia/2005/09/18/Cultura/SCRITTORI-MASSONERIA-E-LETTERATURA-UNO-STRETTO-LEGAME-DA-CARDUCCI-A-CALVINOSCHEDA-2_122004.php | archivedate = 22 September 2018 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://storianumismatica.wordpress.com/2017/12/01/massoni-leopardi-e-lasciapassare/ | title = Massoni, Leopardi e lasciapassare | date = 1 December 2017 | language = it | accessdate = 20 September 2018 | archive-url = https://archive.today/20180922165830/https://storianumismatica.wordpress.com/2017/12/01/massoni-leopardi-e-lasciapassare/ | archivedate = 22 September 2018 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leopardi's close friend Antonio Ranieri was a [[Master Mason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.massoneriascozzese.it/personaggi.htm | title = On the bicentenarious of Giacomo Leopardi | language = it | website = massoneriascozzese.it | accessdate = 20 September 2018 | archive-url = https://archive.today/20180921221257/http://www.massoneriascozzese.it/personaggi.htm | archivedate = 21 September 2018 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of his life, Leopardi had more than twenty-five sentimental female friendships, such as the ones with [[Giovanni Luigi Malvezzi de' Medici#Biography|Teresa Carniani Malvezzi]] or [[Charlotte Napoléone Bonaparte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.affaritaliani.it/culturaspettacoli/libri-tutte-donne-di-leopardi190109.html?refresh_ce|archive-url=https://archive.today/20190106203937/http://www.affaritaliani.it/culturaspettacoli/libri-tutte-donne-di-leopardi190109.html?refresh_ce|url-status=dead|archive-date=2019-01-06|title=Giacomo Leopardi.

where ''R'' is the [[Earth radius|radius of the Earth]].

The same equation can also be derived using the [[Pythagorean theorem]].
At the horizon, the line of sight is a tangent to the Earth and is also perpendicular to Earth's radius. 
This sets up a right triangle, with the sum of the radius and the height as the hypotenuse. 
With

* ''d'' = distance to the horizon
* ''h'' = height of the observer above sea level
* ''R'' = radius of the Earth

referring to the second figure at the right leads to the following:

:&lt;math&gt;(R+h)^2 = R^2 + d^2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R^2 + 2Rh + h^2 = R^2 + d^2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;d = \sqrt{h(2R + h)} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The exact formula above can be expanded as:

:&lt;math&gt;d = \sqrt{2Rh + h^2} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' is the radius of the Earth (''R'' and ''h'' must be in the same units). For example,
if a satellite is at a height of 2000&amp;nbsp;km, the distance to the horizon is {{convert|5430|km}};
neglecting the second term in parentheses would give a distance of {{Convert|5048|km}}, a 7% error.

=== Approximation ===
[[File:horizon_distance_graphs.svg|thumb|250px|Graphs of distances to the true horizon on Earth for a given height ''h''. ''s'' is along the surface of the Earth, ''d'' is the straight line distance, and ''~d'' is the approximate straight line distance assuming ''h'' &amp;lt;&amp;lt; the radius of the Earth, 6371 km. In [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Horizon_distance_graphs.svg the SVG image], hover over a graph to highlight it.]]
&lt;!-- [[File:How far away is the horizon.png|thumb|right|300px]] --&gt;
If the observer is close to the surface of the earth, then it is valid to disregard ''h'' in the term {{nowrap|(2''R'' + ''h'')}}, and the formula becomes-

:&lt;math&gt;d = \sqrt{2Rh} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Using kilometres for ''d'' and ''R'', and metres for ''h'', and taking the radius of the Earth as 6371&amp;nbsp;km, the distance to the horizon is

:&lt;math&gt;d \approx \sqrt{2\cdot6371\cdot{h/1000}} \approx 3.570\sqrt{h} \,&lt;/math&gt;.

Using [[imperial units]], with ''d'' and ''R'' in [[statute mile]]s (as commonly used on land), and ''h'' in feet, the distance to the horizon is

:&lt;math&gt;d \approx \sqrt{2\cdot3963\cdot{h/5280}} \approx \sqrt{1.5h} \approx 1.22 \sqrt{h} &lt;/math&gt;.

If ''d'' is in [[nautical mile]]s, and ''h'' in feet, the constant factor is about 1.06, which is close enough to 1 that it is often ignored, giving:

:&lt;math&gt;d \approx \sqrt h &lt;/math&gt;

These formulas may be used when ''h'' is much smaller than the [[Earth radius|radius of the Earth]] (6371&amp;nbsp;km or 3959&amp;nbsp;mi), including all views from any mountaintops, airplanes, or high-altitude balloons. With the constants as given, both the metric and imperial formulas are precise to within 1% (see the next section for how to obtain greater precision).
If ''h'' is significant with respect to ''R'', as with most [[satellites]], then the approximation is no longer valid, and the exact formula is required.

==Other measures==
===Arc distance===
Another relationship involves the [[great-circle distance]] ''s'' along the [[arc (geometry)|arc]] over the [[figure of the Earth|curved surface of the Earth]] to the horizon; with ''γ'' in [[radian]]s,

:&lt;math&gt;s = R \gamma \,;&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;\cos \gamma = \cos\frac{s}{R}=\frac{R}{R+h}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for ''s'' gives

:&lt;math&gt;s=R\cos^{-1}\frac{R}{R+h} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The distance ''s'' can also be expressed in terms of the line-of-sight distance ''d''; from the second figure at the right,

:&lt;math&gt;\tan \gamma = \frac {d} {R} \,;&lt;/math&gt;

substituting for ''γ'' and rearranging gives

:&lt;math&gt;s=R\tan^{-1}\frac{d}{R} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The distances ''d'' and ''s'' are nearly the same when the height of the object is negligible compared to the radius (that is, ''h''&amp;nbsp;≪&amp;nbsp;''R'').

===Zenith angle===
[[File:HomogSphElevObsZmax.png|thumb|250px|right|Maximum zenith angle for elevated observer in homogeneous spherical atmosphere]]
When the observer is elevated, the horizon [[zenith angle]] can be greater than 90°. The maximum visible zenith angle occurs when the ray is tangent to Earth's surface; from triangle OCG in the figure at right,

:&lt;math&gt;\cos \gamma =\frac{R}{R+h}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the observer's height above the surface and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the angular dip of the horizon. It is related to the horizon zenith angle &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; by:

:&lt;math&gt;z = \gamma +90{}^\circ &lt;/math&gt;

For a non-negative height &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, the angle &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is always ≥ 90°.

=== Objects above the horizon ===
[[File:HorizonDistance.png|thumb|right|300px|Geometrical horizon distance]]
To compute the greatest distance at which an observer can see the top of an object above the horizon, compute the distance to the horizon for a hypothetical observer on top of that object, and add it to the real observer's distance to the horizon. For example, for an observer with a height of 1.70&amp;nbsp;m standing on the ground, the horizon is 4.65&amp;nbsp;km away. For a tower with a height of 100&amp;nbsp;m, the horizon distance is 35.7&amp;nbsp;km. Thus an observer on a beach can see the top of the tower as long as it is not more than 40.35&amp;nbsp;km away. Conversely, if an observer on a boat ({{nowrap|1=''h'' = 1.7 m}}) can just see the tops of trees on a nearby shore ({{nowrap|1=''h'' = 10 m}}), the trees are probably about 16&amp;nbsp;km away.

Referring to the figure at the right, the top of the lighthouse will be visible to a lookout in a [[crow's nest]] at the top of a mast of the boat if
:&lt;math&gt;D_\mathrm{BL} &lt; 3.57\,(\sqrt{h_\mathrm{B}} + \sqrt{h_\mathrm{L}}) \,,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''D''&lt;sub&gt;BL&lt;/sub&gt; is in kilometres and ''h''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; and ''h''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; are in metres.

[[File:Horizon, Valencia (Spain).JPG|thumb|A view across a 20-km-wide bay in the coast of [[Spain]]. Note the [[curvature of the Earth]] hiding the base of the buildings on the far shore. ]]
As another example, suppose an observer, whose eyes are two metres above the level ground, uses binoculars to look at a distant building which he knows to consist of thirty [[storey]]s, each 3.5 metres high. He counts the storeys he can see, and finds there are only ten. So twenty storeys or 70 metres of the building are hidden from him by the curvature of the Earth. From this, he can calculate his distance from the building:

:&lt;math&gt;D \approx 3.57(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{70})&lt;/math&gt;

which comes to about 35 kilometres.

It is similarly possible to calculate how much of a distant object is visible above the horizon. Suppose an observer's eye is 10 metres above sea level, and he is watching a ship that is 20&amp;nbsp;km away. His horizon is:

:&lt;math&gt; 3.57 \sqrt{10} &lt;/math&gt;

kilometres from him, which comes to about 11.3 kilometres away. The ship is a further 8.7&amp;nbsp;km away. The height of a point on the ship that is just visible to the observer is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;h\approx\left(\frac{8.7}{3.57}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

which comes to almost exactly six metres. The observer can therefore see that part of the ship that is more than six metres above the level of the water. The part of the ship that is below this height is hidden from him by the curvature of the Earth. In this situation, the ship is said to be [[hull-down]].

== Effect of atmospheric refraction ==
{{further|Atmospheric refraction}}
{{see also|Effective Earth radius}}
&lt;!-- this subsection is linked from the beginning of the parent section --&gt;

Due to atmospheric [[refraction]] the distance to the visible horizon is further than the distance based on a simple geometric calculation. If the ground (or water) surface is colder than the air above it, a cold, dense layer of air forms close to the surface, causing light to be refracted downward as it travels, and therefore, to some extent, to go around the curvature of the Earth. The reverse happens if the ground is hotter than the air above it, as often happens in deserts, producing [[mirage]]s. As an approximate compensation for refraction, surveyors measuring distances longer than 100 meters subtract 14% from the calculated curvature error and ensure lines of sight are at least 1.5 metres from the ground, to reduce random errors created by refraction.
[[File:Pale Horizon.jpg|thumb|right|Typical desert horizon]]

If the Earth were an airless world like the Moon, the above calculations would be accurate. However, Earth has an [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere of air]], whose [[density]] and [[refractive index]] vary considerably depending on the temperature and pressure. This makes the air [[Atmospheric refraction|refract light]] to varying extents, affecting the appearance of the horizon. Usually, the density of the air just above the surface of the Earth is greater than its density at greater altitudes. This makes its [[refractive index]] greater near the surface than at higher altitudes, which causes light that is travelling roughly horizontally to be refracted downward.&lt;ref name=&quot;ProctorRanyard1892&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Proctor|first1=Richard Anthony|last2=Ranyard|first2=Arthur Cowper|title=Old and New Astronomy|url=https://archive.org/details/oldnewastronomy00procuoft|year=1892|publisher=Longmans, Green and Company|pages=[https://archive.org/details/oldnewastronomy00procuoft/page/73 73]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the actual distance to the horizon greater than the distance calculated with geometrical formulas. With standard atmospheric conditions, the difference is about 8%. This changes the factor of 3.57, in the metric formulas used above, to about 3.86.&lt;ref name=&quot;ATYoungDistToHoriz&quot;/&gt; For instance, if an observer is standing on seashore, with eyes 1.70 m above sea level, according to the simple geometrical formulas given above the horizon should be 4.7&amp;nbsp;km away. Actually, atmospheric refraction allows the observer to see 300 metres farther, moving the true horizon 5&amp;nbsp;km away from the observer.

This correction can be, and often is, applied as a fairly good approximation when atmospheric conditions are close to [[Reference atmospheric model|standard]]. When conditions are unusual, this approximation fails. Refraction is strongly affected by temperature gradients, which can vary considerably from day to day, especially over water. In extreme cases, usually in springtime, when warm air overlies cold water, refraction can allow light to follow the Earth's surface for hundreds of kilometres. Opposite conditions occur, for example, in deserts, where the surface is very hot, so hot, low-density air is below cooler air. This causes light to be refracted upward, causing [[mirage]] effects that make the concept of the horizon somewhat meaningless. Calculated values for the effects of refraction under unusual conditions are therefore only approximate.&lt;ref name=&quot;ATYoungDistToHoriz&quot; /&gt; Nevertheless, attempts have been made to calculate them more accurately than the simple approximation described above.

Outside the visual wavelength range, refraction will be different. For [[radar]] (e.g. for wavelengths 300 to 3&amp;nbsp;mm i.e. frequencies between 1 and 100&amp;nbsp;GHz) the radius of the Earth may be multiplied by 4/3 to obtain an effective radius giving a factor of 4.12 in the metric formula i.e. the radar horizon will be 15% beyond the geometrical horizon or 7% beyond the visual. The 4/3 factor is not exact, as in the visual case the refraction depends on atmospheric conditions.

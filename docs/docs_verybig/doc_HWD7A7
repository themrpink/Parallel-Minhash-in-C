[[Image:Walk In Closet - Expandable Closet Rod and Shelf.jpg|thumb|A walk-in closet in a house.]]
[[Image:Schrank2.jpg|thumb|An antique wardrobe.]]

A '''closet''' (especially in [[North American English|North American usage]]) is an enclosed space, with a door, used for storage, particularly that of clothes. &quot;Fitted closet&quot; are built into the walls of the house so that they take up no apparent space in the room. Closets are often built under stairs, thereby using awkward space that would otherwise go unused.

A piece of furniture such as a [[cabinet (furniture)|cabinet]] or [[chest of drawers]] serves the same function of storage, but is not a closet, which is an architectural feature rather than a piece of furniture. A closet always has space for hanging, whereas a [[cupboard]] may consist only of shelves for folded garments. The word &quot;[[wardrobe]]&quot; can refer to a free-standing piece of furniture (also known as an armoire), but according to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', a wardrobe can also be a &quot;large cupboard or cabinet for storing clothes or other linen&quot;, including &quot;built-in wardrobe, fitted wardrobe, walk-in wardrobe, etc.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=OED|publisher=OUP|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/34625?rskey=AMeU9Z&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses of the word==
In [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] and [[Middle English]], ''closet'' referred to a small private room, an inner sanctum within a much larger house, used for prayer, reading, or study. 

The use of &quot;closet&quot; for &quot;[[toilet (room)|toilet]]&quot; dates back to 1662.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=OED|publisher=OUP|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/34625?rskey=AMeU9Z&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Indian English]], this use continues.{{cn|date=February 2018}} Related forms include [[Pail_closet#Earth_closet_system|earth closet]] and water closet (W.C. or [[flush toilet]]). &quot;Privy&quot; meaning an [[outhouse]] derives from &quot;private&quot;, making the connection with the Middle English use of &quot;closet&quot;, above.

[[image:Hoosier Cabinet.JPG|thumb|right|A typical Hoosier cabinet of the 1920s]]
A '''kitchen''' is a [[room (architecture)|room]] or part of a room used for [[cooking]] and [[food preparation]] in a dwelling or in a commercial establishment. A modern middle-class residential kitchen is typically equipped with a [[Kitchen stove|stove]], a [[sink]] with hot and cold running water, a [[refrigerator]], and worktops and kitchen [[cabinet (furniture)|cabinets]] arranged according to a [[Modular Kitchen|modular design]]. Many households have a [[microwave oven]], a [[dishwasher]], and other electric appliances. The main functions of a kitchen are to store, prepare and cook food (and to complete related tasks such as [[dishwashing]]). The room or area may also be used for [[dining]] (or small meals such as breakfast), [[entertaining]] and [[laundry]]. The design and construction of kitchens is a huge market all over the world.&lt;!-- This article is about kitchen as a room.  Details about pans and cookware are not needed in lead. --&gt;

Commercial kitchens are found in [[restaurant]]s, [[cafeteria]]s, [[hotel]]s, [[hospital]]s, educational and workplace facilities, army barracks, and similar establishments. These kitchens are generally larger and equipped with  bigger and more heavy-duty equipment than a residential kitchen. For example, a large restaurant may have a huge walk-in refrigerator and a large commercial dishwasher machine. In some instances commercial kitchen equipment such as commercial sinks are used in household settings as it offers ease of use for food preparation and high durability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.homedecorexpert.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-using-a-commercial-sink-at-home.html|title=The Pros and Cons of Using A Commercial Sink at Home – Home Decor Expert and|date=2018-06-14|work=Home Decor Expert|access-date=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/09/garden/the-commercial-kitchen-at-home-pros-and-cons-by-carol-vogel.html|title=The commercial litchen at home: pros and cons |author=Vogel, Carol|date=1982-12-09|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developed countries, commercial kitchens are generally subject to [[public health]] laws. They are inspected periodically by public-health officials, and forced to close if they do not meet hygienic requirements mandated by law.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==History==

The evolution of the kitchen is linked to the invention of the [[Kitchen stove|cooking range]] or [[stove]] and the development of water infrastructure capable of supplying running water to private homes. Food was cooked over an open [[fire]]. Technical advances in heating food in the 18th and 19th centuries changed the architecture of the kitchen. Before the advent of modern pipes, water was brought from an outdoor source such as [[water well|wells]], pumps or springs.

===Antiquity===
[[File:Villa Rustica Ahrweiler Küche der Mansio.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Kitchen with stove and oven of a Roman inn (''Mansio'') at the Roman villa of Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler (Germany)]]
The houses in [[History of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greece]] were commonly of the [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]]-type: the rooms were arranged around a central courtyard for women. In many such homes, a covered but otherwise open patio served as the kitchen. Homes of the wealthy had the kitchen as a separate room, usually next to a bathroom (so that both rooms could be heated by the kitchen fire), both rooms being accessible from the court.  In such houses, there was often a separate small storage room in the back of the kitchen used for storing food and [[kitchen utensil]]s.

In the [[Roman Empire]], common folk in cities often had no kitchen of their own; they did their [[cooking]] in large public kitchens. Some had small mobile [[bronze]] stoves, on which a fire could be lit for cooking. Wealthy [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] had relatively well-equipped kitchens. In a Roman [[villa]], the kitchen was typically integrated into the main building as a separate room, set apart for practical reasons of [[smoke]] and sociological reasons of the kitchen being operated by [[Slavery|slaves]]. The [[fireplace]] was typically on the floor, placed at a wall—sometimes raised a little bit—such that one had to kneel to cook. There were no [[chimney]]s.

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Medieval kitchen.jpg|thumb|The roasting spit in this [[Europe]]an Renaissance kitchen was driven automatically by a propeller—the black cloverleaf-like structure in the upper left]]

Early medieval European [[longhouse]]s had an open fire under the highest point of the building. The &quot;kitchen area&quot; was between the entrance and the fireplace. In wealthy homes there was typically more than one kitchen. In some homes there were upwards of three kitchens. The kitchens were divided based on the types of food prepared in them.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Theodor (1992) ''Medieval Homes'', Sampson Lowel House&lt;/ref&gt; In place of a chimney, these early buildings had a hole in the roof through which some of the smoke could escape. Besides cooking, the fire also served as a source of heat and light to the single-room building. A similar design can be found in the [[Iroquois]] longhouses of [[North America]].

In the larger homesteads of European nobles, the kitchen was sometimes in a separate sunken floor building to keep the main building, which served social and official purposes, free from [[indoor air quality|indoor smoke]].

The first known stoves in [[Japan]] date from about the same time. The earliest findings are from the [[Kofun period]] (3rd to 6th century). These stoves, called ''kamado'', were typically made of clay and mortar; they were fired with [[wood]] or [[charcoal]] through a hole in the front and had a hole in the top, into which a pot could be hanged by its rim. This type of stove remained in use for centuries to come, with only minor modifications. Like in Europe, the wealthier homes had a separate building which served for cooking. A kind of open fire pit fired with charcoal, called ''irori'', remained in use as the secondary stove in most homes until the [[Edo period]] (17th to 19th century). A ''kamado'' was used to cook the staple food, for instance [[rice]], while ''irori'' served both to cook side dishes and as a heat source.

[[File:Smoke kitchen.jpg|left|thumb|18th century cooks tended a fire and endured smoke in this [[Switzerland|Swiss]] farmhouse smoke kitchen]]

The kitchen remained largely unaffected by architectural advances throughout the Middle Ages; open fire remained the only method of heating food. European medieval kitchens were dark, smoky, and sooty places, whence their name ''&quot;smoke kitchen&quot;''. In European medieval cities around the 10th to 12th centuries, the kitchen still used an open fire [[hearth]] in the middle of the room. In wealthy homes, the ground floor was often used as a stable while the kitchen was located on the floor above, like the bedroom and the hall. In [[castle]]s and [[monastery|monasteries]], the living and working areas were separated; the kitchen was sometimes moved to a separate building, and thus could not serve anymore to heat the living rooms. In some castles the kitchen was retained in the same structure, but servants were strictly separated from nobles, by constructing separate spiral stone staircases for use of servants to bring food to upper levels.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The kitchen might be separate from the great hall due to the smoke from cooking fires and the chance the fires may get out of control.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=Neil |last1=Christie |first2=Oliver |last2=Creighton |first3=Matt |last3=Edgeworth|first4=Helena |last4=Hamerow |authorlink1=Neil Christie |authorlink4=Helena Hamerow |title=Transforming Townscapes: From burgh to borough: the archaeology of Wallingford, AD 800–1400 |series=The Society for Medieval Archaeology Monograph Series |number=35 |isbn=978-1-909662-09-4 |location=Oxford |year=2013 |publisher=Society for Medieval Archaeology|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few medieval kitchens survive as they were &quot;notoriously ephemeral structures&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=Oliver |last1=Creighton |first2=Neil |last2=Christie |contribution=The Archaeology of Wallingford Castle: a summary of the current state of knowledge |title=Wallingford: The Castle and the Town in Context |editor-first1=K.

In Japanese homes, the kitchen started to become a separate room within the main building at that time.

With the advent of the chimney, the hearth moved from the center of the room to one wall, and the first brick-and-mortar hearths were built. The fire was lit on top of the construction; a vault underneath served to store wood. Pots made of [[iron]], [[bronze]], or [[copper]] started to replace the [[pottery]] used earlier. The temperature was controlled by hanging the pot higher or lower over the fire, or placing it on a [[trivet]] or directly on the hot ashes. Using open fire for cooking (and heating) was risky; fires devastating whole cities occurred frequently.

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] invented an automated system for a rotating spit for spit-roasting: a propeller in the chimney made the spit turn all by itself. This kind of system was widely used in wealthier homes. Beginning in the late [[Middle Ages]], kitchens in Europe lost their home-heating function even more and were increasingly moved from the living area into a separate room. The living room was now heated by [[cocklestove]]s, operated from the kitchen, which offered the huge advantage of not filling the room with smoke.

Freed from smoke and dirt, the living room thus began to serve as an area for social functions and increasingly became a showcase for the owner's wealth. In the upper classes, cooking and the kitchen were the domain of the [[servant (domestic)|servants]], and the kitchen was set apart from the living rooms, sometimes even far from the dining room. Poorer homes often did not yet have a separate kitchen; they kept the one-room arrangement where all activities took place, or at the most had the kitchen in the entrance hall.

The medieval smoke kitchen (or [[Farmhouse kitchen]]) remained common, especially in rural [[Farmhouse (building)|farmhouses]] and generally in poorer homes, until much later. In a few European farmhouses, the smoke kitchen was in regular use until the middle of the 20th century. These houses often had no chimney, but only a smoke hood above the fireplace, made of wood and covered with clay, used to smoke meat. The smoke rose more or less freely, warming the upstairs rooms and protecting the woodwork from vermin.

===Colonial America===
[[File:Belgian Farm Summer Kitchen at Heritage Hill State Historical Park.jpg|thumb|left|Summer kitchen]]
In [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]], as in other colonies of [[New England]] during [[Colonial America]], kitchens were often built as separate rooms and were located behind the [[parlor]] and [[hall|keeping room]] or [[dining room]]. One early record of a kitchen is found in the 1648 inventory of the estate of a John Porter of [[Windsor, Connecticut]]. The inventory lists goods in the house &quot;over the kittchin&quot; and &quot;in the kittchin&quot;. The items listed in the kitchen were: [[silver spoon]]s, [[pewter]], [[brass]], iron, arms, ammunition, [[hemp]], [[flax]] and &quot;other implements about the room&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Trumbull, J. Hammond |year=1850|url=https://archive.org/stream/publicrecordsofc001conn#page/476/mode/2up |title=The Public Records of the Colony of Connecticut 1636–1776|volume= Vol. 1|page= 476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separate {{anchor|Summer kitchen}}'''summer kitchens''' were also common on large farms in the north; these were used to prepare meals for harvest workers and tasks such as [[canning]] during the warm summer months, to keep the heat out of the main house.

In the southern states, where the [[climate]] and [[society|sociological]] conditions differed from the north, the kitchen was often relegated to an outbuilding. On [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]], it was separate from the big house or [[mansion]] in much the same way as the feudal kitchen in medieval Europe: the kitchen was operated by [[Slavery|slaves]] in the antebellum years. Their working place was separated from the living area of the masters by the social standards, but more importantly, it was a means to reduce the chance of fire in the main house from kitchen operations.

===Technological advances===
[[File:Kitchen rural 1918.jpg|thumb|A typical rural American kitchen of 1918 at The Sauer-Beckmann Farmstead ([[Texas]], USA)]]
Technological advances during [[industrialisation]] brought major changes to the kitchen. Iron stoves, which enclosed the fire completely and were more efficient, appeared. Early models included the [[Franklin stove]] around 1740, which was a [[furnace]] stove intended for heating, not for cooking. [[Benjamin Thompson]] in England designed his &quot;Rumford stove&quot; around 1800. This stove was much more energy efficient than earlier stoves; it used one fire to heat several pots, which were hung into holes on top of the stove and were thus heated from all sides instead of just from the bottom. However, his stove was designed for large kitchens; it was too big for domestic use. The &quot;Oberlin stove&quot; was a refinement of the technique that resulted in a size reduction; it was patented in the U.S. in 1834 and became a commercial success with some 90,000 units sold over the next 30 years. These stoves were still fired with [[wood]] or [[coal]]. Although the first [[gas lighting|gas street lamps]] were installed in [[Paris]], [[London]], and [[Berlin]] at the beginning of the 1820s and the first U.S. patent on a [[gas stove]] was granted in 1825, it was not until the late 19th century that using gas for lighting and cooking became commonplace in urban areas.
Before and after the beginning of the 20th century, kitchens were frequently not equipped with built-in cabinetry, and the lack of storage space in the kitchen became a real problem. The Hoosier Manufacturing Co. of Indiana adapted an existing furniture piece, the baker's cabinet, which had a similar structure of a table top with some cabinets above it (and frequently flour bins beneath) to solve the storage problem. By rearranging the parts and taking advantage of (then) modern metal working, they were able to produce a well-organized, compact cabinet which answered the home cook's needs for storage and working space.  A distinctive feature of the [[Hoosier cabinet]] is its accessories. As originally supplied, they were equipped with various racks and other hardware to hold and organize spices and various staples. One useful feature was the combination flour-bin/sifter, a tin hopper that could be used without having to remove it from the cabinet. A similar sugar bin was also common.

The [[urbanization]] in the second half of the 19th century induced other significant changes that would ultimately change the kitchen. Out of sheer necessity, cities began planning and building [[Water supply network|water distribution]] pipes into homes, and built [[sanitary sewer|sewers]] to deal with the [[waste water]]. [[Gas pipe]]s were laid; gas was used first for lighting purposes, but once the network had grown sufficiently, it also became available for heating and cooking on gas stoves. At the turn of the 20th century, [[electricity]] had been mastered well enough to become a commercially viable alternative to gas and slowly started replacing the latter. But like the gas stove, the [[electric stove]] had a slow start. The first electrical stove had been presented in 1893 at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]], but it was not until the 1930s that the technology was stable enough and began to take off.
[[File:Mrs. Arthur Beales in the kitchen of the Beales home.jpg|thumb|Mrs. Arthur Beales in the kitchen of the Beales home, [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada, circa 1903–1913. Note the water pipes along the back wall that fed the sink]]

====Industrialization====
Industrialization also caused social changes. The new [[factory]] [[working class]] in the cities was housed under generally poor conditions. Whole families lived in small one or two-room [[apartment]]s in tenement buildings up to six stories high, badly aired and with insufficient lighting. Sometimes, they shared apartments with &quot;night sleepers&quot;, unmarried men who paid for a bed at night. The kitchen in such an apartment was often used as a living and sleeping room, and even as a [[bathroom]]. Water had to be fetched from wells and heated on the stove. Water pipes were laid only towards the end of the 19th century, and then often only with one tap per building or per story. Brick-and-mortar stoves fired with coal remained the norm until well into the second half of the century. Pots and kitchenware were typically stored on open shelves, and parts of the room could be separated from the rest using simple curtains.

In contrast, there were no dramatic changes for the upper classes. The kitchen, located in the [[basement]] or the [[ground floor]], continued to be operated by servants. In some houses, water [[pump]]s were installed, and some even had kitchen sinks and drains (but no water on tap yet, except for some feudal kitchens in castles). The kitchen became a much cleaner space with the advent of &quot;cooking machines&quot;, closed stoves made of iron plates and fired by wood and increasingly charcoal or coal, and that had [[flue pipe]]s connected to the chimney. For the servants the kitchen continued to also serve as a sleeping room; they slept either on the floor, or later in narrow spaces above a lowered ceiling, for the new stoves with their smoke outlet no longer required a high ceiling in the kitchen. The kitchen floors were tiled; kitchenware was neatly stored in [[cupboard]]s to protect them from dust and steam. A large table served as a workbench; there were at least as many chairs as there were servants, for the table in the kitchen also doubled as the eating place for the servants.

====World War II cooking and dining trends====
The urban middle class imitated the luxurious dining styles of the upper class as best as they could. Living in smaller apartments, the kitchen was the main room—here, the family lived. The study or living room was saved for special occasions such as an occasional dinner invitation. Because of this, these middle-class kitchens were often more homely than those of the upper class, where the kitchen was a work-only room occupied only by the servants. Besides a cupboard to store the [[kitchenware]], there were a table and chairs, where the family would dine, and sometimes—if space allowed—even a [[fauteuil]] or a couch.

[[File:&quot;Lena Horne conserves fuel (gas).&quot;, ca. 1941 - ca. 1945 - NARA - 535820.jpg|thumb|left|Gas stove in the 1940s]]
Gas pipes were first laid in the late 19th century, and gas stoves started to replace the older coal-fired stoves. Gas was more expensive than coal, though, and thus the new technology was first installed in the wealthier homes. Where workers' apartments were equipped with a gas stove, gas distribution would go through a coin meter.

In rural areas, the older technology using coal or wood stoves or even brick-and-mortar open fireplaces remained common throughout. Gas and water pipes were first installed in the big cities; small villages were connected only much later.

===Rationalization===
[[File:Frankfurter-kueche-vienna.JPG|thumb|The [[Frankfurt kitchen]] using [[Taylorism|Taylorist]] principles]]
The trend to increasing gasification and [[electrification]] continued at the turn of the 20th century. In industry, it was the phase of work [[process optimization]]. [[Taylorism]] was born, and [[Time and motion study|time-motion studies]] were used to optimize processes. These ideas also spilled over into domestic kitchen architecture because of a growing trend that called for a professionalization of household work, started in the mid-19th century by [[Catharine Beecher]] and amplified by [[Christine Frederick]]'s publications in the 1910s.

A stepstone was the kitchen designed in Frankfurt by Margarethe Schütte-Lihotzky. Working-class women frequently worked in factories to ensure the family's survival, as the men's wages often did not suffice. [[Social housing]] projects led to the next milestone: the [[Frankfurt Kitchen]]. Developed in 1926, this kitchen measured 1.9&amp;nbsp;m by 3.4&amp;nbsp;m (approximately 6&amp;nbsp;ft 2&amp;nbsp;in by 11&amp;nbsp;ft 2&amp;nbsp;in, with a standard layout). It was built for two purposes: to optimize kitchen work to reduce cooking time and lower the cost of building decently equipped kitchens. The design, created by [[Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky]], was the result of detailed time-motion studies and interviews with future tenants to identify what they needed from their kitchens. Schütte-Lihotzky's fitted kitchen was built in some 10,000 apartments in the housing projects erected in [[Frankfurt]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Rawsthorn, Alice (2010-09-27) [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/27/arts/27iht-design27.html Modernist triumph in the kitchen].

The initial reception was critical: it was so small that only one person could work in it; some storage spaces intended for raw loose food ingredients such as [[flour]] were reachable by children. But the Frankfurt kitchen embodied a standard for the rest of the 20th century in rental apartments: the &quot;work kitchen&quot;. It was criticized as &quot;exiling the women in the kitchen&quot;, but post-[[World War II]] economic reasons prevailed. The kitchen once more was seen as a work place that needed to be separated from the living areas. Practical reasons also played a role in this development: just as in the bourgeois homes of the past, one reason for separating the kitchen was to keep the steam and smells of cooking out of the living room.

The idea of standardized was first introduced locally with the [[Frankfurt kitchen]], but later defined new in the &quot;Swedish kitchen&quot; (''Svensk köksstandard'', Swedish kitchen standard). The equipment used remained a standard for years to come: hot and cold water on tap and a kitchen sink and an electrical or gas stove and oven. Not much later, the [[refrigerator]] was added as a standard item. The concept was refined in the &quot;Swedish kitchen&quot; using unit furniture with wooden fronts for the kitchen cabinets. Soon, the concept was amended by the use of smooth synthetic door and drawer fronts, first in white, recalling a sense of cleanliness and alluding to sterile lab or hospital settings, but soon after in more lively colors, too.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Some years after the Frankfurt Kitchen, Poggenpohl presented the &quot;reform kitchen&quot; in 1928 with interconnecting cabinets and functional interiors. The reform kitchen was a forerunner to the later unit kitchen and fitted kitchen.

Unit construction since its introduction has defined the development of the modern kitchen. Pre-manufactured modules, using mass manufacturing techniques developed during [[World War II]], greatly brought down the cost of a kitchen. Units which are kept on the floor are called &quot;floor units&quot;, &quot;floor cabinets&quot;, or &quot;base cabinets&quot; on which a kitchen [[Countertop|worktop]] – originally often [[formica (plastic)|formica]] and often now made of [[granite]], [[marble]], tile or wood – is placed. The units which are held on the wall for storage purposes are termed as &quot;[[wall units]]&quot; or &quot;wall cabinets&quot;. In small areas of kitchen in an apartment, even a &quot;tall storage unit&quot; is available for effective storage. In cheaper brands, all cabinets are kept a uniform color, normally white, with interchangeable doors and accessories chosen by the customer to give a varied look. In more expensive brands, the cabinets are produced matching the doors' colors and finishes, for an older more bespoke look.

===Open kitchens===
Starting in the 1980s, the perfection of the [[extractor hood]] allowed an open kitchen again, integrated more or less with the living room without causing the whole apartment or house to smell. Before that, only a few earlier experiments, typically in newly built upper-middle-class family homes, had open kitchens. Examples are [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]'s ''House Willey'' (1934) and ''House Jacobs'' (1936). Both had open kitchens, with high ceilings (up to the roof) and were aired by [[Skylight (window)|skylight]]s. The extractor hood made it possible to build open kitchens in apartments, too, where both high ceilings and skylights were not possible.

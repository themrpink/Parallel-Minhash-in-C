'''Malabo''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|l|ɑː|b|oʊ}} {{respell|mə|LAH|boh}}, {{IPA-es|maˈlaβo}}; formerly '''Santa Isabel''') is the [[Capital city|capital]] of [[Equatorial Guinea]] and the [[provinces of Equatorial Guinea|province]] of [[Bioko Norte]]. It is located on the north coast of the island of [[Bioko]], ({{lang-bvb|Etulá}}, and as ''Fernando Pó'' by the Europeans). In 2018, the city had a population of approximately 297,000 inhabitants.

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the official language of the city and of the country as well. Spanish is the most-spoken language and practically the only one used, except some French and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

Malabo is the oldest city in Equatorial Guinea. [[Ciudad de la Paz]] is a [[planned city]] under construction in mainland Equatorial Guinea which was designed to replace Malabo as the capital. The institutions of governance of Equatorial Guinea began the process of locating to Ciudad de la Paz in February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-38911573|title=E Guinea government moves into forest HQ|date=8 February 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===Discovery and Portuguese occupation===
[[File:Isla de Fernando Poo – Vista de la playa y ciudad de Santa Isabel.jpg|thumb|left|upright]]
In 1472, in an attempt to find a new route to [[India]], the Portuguese navigator [[Fernão do Pó]],  encountered the island of Bioko, which he called ''Formosa''.&lt;ref&gt; Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the island was named after its discoverer, Fernando Pó. At the beginning of the 16th century, specifically in 1507, the Portuguese Ramos de Esquivel made a first attempt at colonization on the island of Fernando Pó. He established a factory in ''Concepción'' (now [[Riaba]]) and developed plantations of [[sugarcane]].

With the treaties of San Ildefonso in 1777 and [[Treaty of El Pardo (1778)|El Pardo]] in 1778, during the reign of the Spanish King [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]], the Portuguese gave to the Spanish the islands of Fernando Pó, [[Annobón]], and the right to conduct trade in the mainland, an area of influence of approximately 800&amp;nbsp;000 [[Square kilometre|km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] in Africa, in exchange for the [[Colonia del Sacramento]] in [[Río de la Plata]] and the Santa Catalina Island off the Brazilian coast (occupied by the Spaniards). The area stretched from the [[Niger Delta]] to the mouth of [[Ogooué River|Ogüé River]] &amp;mdash; in the current [[Gabon]] &amp;mdash; and included, besides the islands of Fernando Pó and [[Annobon]], the islets of Corisco and Elobeyes. Having failed its attempts to colonize these lands because they already had vast colonies in other parts of the world, Spain lost interest in Spanish Guinea in 1827 and authorized the British use the island as a base for the work of suppression of the slave trade.

===British presence===
In 1821, the British captain Nelly approached the island of [[Fernando Pó (island)|Fernando Pó]]. He found it abandoned and founded the establishments of ''Melville Bay'' (now [[Riaba]]) and ''San Carlos'' (now [[Luba, Equatorial Guinea|Luba]]). Some years later, another British captain, [[William Fitzwilliam Owen]], decided to colonize the island and in the north of it &amp;mdash; on the site of the present capital &amp;mdash; erected a base for British ships hunting [[African slave trade|slave traders]]. Thus, on 25 December 1827, ''Port Clarence'' was founded on the ruins of a previous Portuguese settlement.&lt;ref&gt; Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;The name was chosen in honor of the Duke of Clarence, who later became King [[William IV of Great Britain|William IV]]. The [[Bubi people|Bubis]] indigenous to the island called it ''Ripotó'' (place of the foreigners). The population of the capital was increased by the arrival of slaves freed by the British. These [[freedmen]] were settled in Port Clarence before the establishment of [[Sierra Leone]] as a colony for freed slaves. The descendants of these freed slaves remained on the island. They joined other migrants who arrived as free workers from Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Benin, Nigeria and Cameroon, and became the population group called [[Creole peoples|Creole]] or [[Fernandino peoples|fernandinos]], whose language was [[Pichinglis]], a Bantu-English [[Creole language|Creole]] with some Spanish elements.

During the British period, the British consul automatically became the governor of the colony, including Governor [[John Beecroft]], a British [[mulatto]] sailor who modernized the capital, and whose work was later recognized by Spain with a monument in [[Punta Fernanda]].
[[File:Reymalabo1930.PNG|thumb|160px|right|[[Malabo Lopelo Melaka|Malabo Löpèlo Mëlaka, Malabo I of Bioko]]]]

=== Spanish definitive control and new capital ===
In 1844, when Queen [[Isabel II of Spain]] ruled after the regency of her mother Maria Cristina and [[Baldomero Espartero]], in an attempt to modernize Spain and rescue its heritage, Spain let the UK know its desire to regain control of the colony and thus the island. It took another decade to implement this direct control. The capital already had more dynamic and Protestant religious missions which were very successful. Both factors helped to change the attitude of Spain, in addition to internal reasons already alluded.

Spain again took control of the island in 1855 and the capital, Port Clarence, was renamed ''Santa Isabel'', in honor of Queen [[Isabel II of Spain|Isabel II]].&lt;ref&gt; Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;The capital of the island of [[Bioko|Fernando Pó]] became the capital of Equatorial Guinea.

Its present name was given to the town in 1973 as part of the campaign of President [[Francisco Macías Nguema]] to replace [[place name]]s of European origin with African names, in this case honoring [[Malabo Lopelo Melaka]], the last [[Bubi language|Bubi]] king. Malabo, the son of King [[Moka]], surrendered to the Spaniards. His uncle [[Sas Ebuera]], head of the Bubi warriors, claimed to represent legitimate Bubi rule and continued resisting, confronting the Spanish openly in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|page=58|title=The Human Tradition in Modern Africa|volume= 49|series=Human tradition around the world|author=Dennis D. Cordell|editor=Dennis D. Cordell|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2012|isbn=0742537323|via=Google Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3WqKbRSk7S8C$}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Spanish killed Sas Ebuera, Malabo became the king unopposed, but with no authority. Bubi clans and settlements were slow to accept Spanish sovereignty over the island, and the full conquest and pacification of the island was not achieved until 1912.

===Reign of Terror===
During the so-called ''Reign of Terror'' of Macías Nguema, the dictator suppressed much of the intelligentsia of the country, initiating the process of taking over the positions of the public administration by part of the natives of Mongomo and clan Esangui. Many city residents had to leave. In the last years of his mandate, almost a fifth of the population fled. At that time (1968–1979), Equatorial Guinea received money from the Soviet Union in return for, inter alia, affording port facilities for Soviet naval craft, particularly submarines.

The infamous [[Black Beach Prison]] also known as ''Blay Beach prison'' (or Playa Negra prison) sits at the mouth of the Cónsul River, beside the black beach and behind the Governor's Palace and barracks. Several people have been jailed there in the over the 35 years of dictatorship. Among those imprisoned and tortured are many political leaders such as [[Rafael Upiñalo]] (Movimiento), Fabián Nsue (UP), Felipe Ondo Obiang (FDR), Martín Puye of [[Movement for the Self-Determination of Bioko Island]] (MAIB) or [[Plácido Micó]] of the Social Democratic [[Convergence for Social Democracy]] (CPDS).

A group of mercenaries was also jailed at Black Beach for an attempted coup against President [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema]].

== Geography ==
[[File:Klimadiagramm-Malabo-Aequatorial-Guinea-metrisch-deutsch.png|thumb|250px|right|Climatological diagram of Malabo]]
Malabo is situated north of the island of Bioko, at coordinates 3° 45' 7.43&quot; North and 8° 46' 25.32&quot; East. The south of Malabo is limited by the Cónsul River and just across the river, south-west, is the hospital. West of the city, located about 9&amp;nbsp;km from the center of Malabo, is renewed [[Malabo International Airport]]. In the coastal region north of the city are the [[bay]]s and [[cape (geography)|capes]]. The elder is the punta de la Unidad Africana located just behind the [[Presidential Palace]] of Malabo and which occupies the entire eastern part of the Bay of Malabo. Another cape of importance is punta Europa located in the west of the city near to the airport.

===Climate===
Malabo features a [[tropical monsoon climate]] (Am). Malabo receives on average 1,800&amp;nbsp;mm of rain per year. The city has a pronounced, albeit short, sunnier (but still cloudy) [[dry season]] from December through February. February is normally its driest with 33&amp;nbsp;mm (0.2&amp;nbsp;in) of rain falling on average. It also has a very long cloudy [[wet season]] that covers the remaining nine months (March–November). On average, the months hit hardest by the wet season are from September to October, with receiving {{convert|500|mm|in|0}} of [[rain]] and showers between them.

Daytime temperatures do not vary at all day to day, and only vary a few degrees throughout the entire year. At night, the average low temperature is 20–21°C in every month of the year but January to April have a slightly higher diurnal range because it is clearer. Nonetheless, with only 1,020 hours of sunshine per year, Malabo is one of the cloudiest, wettest and most [[thunderstorm|lightning-prone]] capitals of the world, and experiences much [[fog]] and haze even when it's not raining in the driest months.

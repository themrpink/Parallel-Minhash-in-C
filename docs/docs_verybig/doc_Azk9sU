In 1663–1664, the English scientist [[Robert Hooke]] was writing his book ''Micrographia'' (1666) in which he discussed, among other things, the relation between the height of the atmosphere and the barometric pressure at the surface.  Since the atmosphere surrounds the earth, which itself is a sphere, the volume of atmosphere bearing on any unit area of the earth's surface is a truncated cone (which extends from the earth's center to the vacuum of space; obviously only the section of the cone from the earth's surface to space bears on the earth's surface).  Although the volume of a cone is proportional to the cube of its height, Hooke argued that the air's pressure at the earth's surface is instead proportional to the height of the atmosphere because gravity diminishes with altitude.  Although Hooke did not explicitly state so, the relation that he proposed would be true only if gravity decreases as the inverse square of the distance from the earth's center.&lt;ref&gt;(Gal &amp; Chen-Morris, 2005), pp. 391–392.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hooke, ''Micrographia'' … (London, England:  John Martyn, 1667), [http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=goto&amp;id=HistSciTech.HookeMicro&amp;isize=M&amp;submit=Go+to+page&amp;page=227 page 227:]  &quot;[I say a ''Cylinder'', not a piece of a ''Cone'', because, as I may elsewhere shew in the Explication of Gravity, that ''triplicate'' proportion of the shels of a Sphere, to their respective diameters, I suppose to be removed in this case by the decrease of the power of Gravity.]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[telecommunication]] and [[radio science]], an '''ionospheric sounding''' is a technique that provides real-time [[data]] on [[high-frequency]] ionospheric-dependent [[radio propagation]], using a basic [[system]] consisting of a synchronized transmitter and receiver. 

The time [[Propagation delay|delay]] between [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] and reception is translated into effective [[ionospheric layer]] altitude. Vertical incident sounding uses a collocated transmitter and receiver and involves directing a range of frequencies vertically to the [[ionosphere]] and measuring the values of the reflected returned signals to determine the effective ionosphere layer altitude. This technique is also used to determine the [[critical frequency]]. Oblique sounders use a transmitter at one end of a given propagation path, and a synchronized receiver, usually with an oscilloscope-type display ([[ionogram]]), at the other end. The transmitter emits a stepped- or swept-[[frequency]] [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] which is displayed or measured at the receiver. The measurement converts [[time]] delay to effective altitude of the ionospheric layer. The ionogram display shows the effective altitude of the ionospheric layer as a function of frequency.

&lt;!-- This is an article, not a disambiguation. Please let's keep it an article and edit it as an article. --&gt;

A sequence of events is '''isochronous''' if the events occur regularly, or at equal [[time]] intervals. The term ''isochronous'' is used in several technical contexts, but usually refers to the primary subject maintaining a constant period or interval (the reciprocal of [[frequency]]), despite variations in other measurable factors in the same system. Isochronous timing is a characteristic of a repeating event whereas [[synchronous]] timing refers to the relationship between two or more events.&lt;ref&gt;{{FS1037C MS188|article=isochronous}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In [[dynamical systems theory]], an [[oscillation|oscillator]] is called ''isochronous'' if its [[frequency]] is independent of its [[amplitude]].
*In [[horology]], a mechanical [[clock]] or [[watch]] is ''isochronous'' if it runs at the same rate regardless of changes in its drive force, so that it keeps correct time as its [[mainspring]] unwinds or chain length varies. Isochrony is important in [[timekeeping]] devices.
*In [[electricity generation|electrical power generation]], ''isochronous'' means that the frequency of the electricity generated is constant under varying load; there is zero [[droop speed control|generator droop]]. (See [[Synchronization (alternating current)]].)
*In [[telecommunications]], an [[isochronous signal]] is one where the [[time]] interval separating any two corresponding transitions is equal to the [[Unit interval (data transmission)|unit interval]] or to a multiple of the unit interval; but phase is arbitrary and potentially varying.
**The term is also used in [[data transmission]] to describe cases in which corresponding significant instants of two or more sequential signals have a constant [[phase (waves)|phase]] relationship.
**[[Isochronous burst transmission]] is used when the information-bearer channel rate is higher than the input data signaling rate.
*In the [[Universal Serial Bus]] used in [[computer]]s, ''isochronous'' is one of the four data flow types for USB devices (the others being Control, Interrupt and Bulk). It is commonly used for streaming data types such as video or audio sources. Similarly, the [[IEEE 1394 interface]] standard, commonly called Firewire, includes support for isochronous streams of audio and video at known constant rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= 1394 Isochronous Transfers |author= Bill McKenzie |work= Windows Driver Developer Digest |date= September 15, 2003 |url= http://www.wd-3.com/archive/1394IsochronousTransfersPart1.htm |accessdate= July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[particle accelerator]]s an [[isochronous cyclotron]] is a cyclotron where the field strength increases with radius to compensate for relativistic increase in mass with speed.
*An '''isochrone''' is a [[contour line]] of equal time, for instance, in [[stratum|geological layers]], [[dendrochronology|tree rings]] or [[wave front]]s. An [[isochrone map]] or diagram shows such contours.
*In [[linguistics]], [[isochrony]] is the postulated rhythmic division of time into equal portions by a language.
*In [[neurology]], [[isochronic tones]] are regular beats of a single [[pure tone|tone]] used for [[brainwave entrainment]].

'''Isochronous burst transmission''' is a method of  transmission.  In a [[data]] [[telecommunications network|network]] where the [[information-bearer channel]] rate is higher than the input [[data signaling rate]], [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] is performed by &lt;nowiki&gt;interrupting&lt;/nowiki&gt;, at controlled intervals, the [[data stream]] being transmitted.

''Note 1:'' [[Burst transmission]] in [[isochronous]] form enables communication between [[data terminal equipment]] (DTE) and data networks that operate at dissimilar data signaling rates, such as when the information-bearer channel rate is higher than the DTE output data signaling rate.

''Note 2:''  The [[binary code|binary]] digits are transferred at the information-bearer channel rate. The [[data transfer]] is interrupted at intervals in order to produce the required average data signaling rate.

''Note 3:''  The interruption is always for an integral number of unit intervals.

''Note 4:''  Isochronous burst transmission has particular application where envelopes are being transferred between [[data circuit terminating equipment]] (DCE) and only the bytes contained within the envelopes are being transferred between the DCE and the DTE. ''Synonyms'': '''burst isochronous''' ''(deprecated)'', '''interrupted isochronous transmission.'''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/fs-1037c.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[telecommunication]], an '''isochronous signal''' is a [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] in which the [[time]] interval separating any two significant instants is equal to the [[Unit interval (data transmission)|unit interval]] or a multiple of the unit interval. Variations in the time intervals are constrained within specified limits.

&quot;[[Isochronous]]&quot; is a characteristic of one signal, while &quot;[[Synchronization|synchronous]]&quot; indicates a relationship between two or more signals.

'''Jerkiness''', sometimes called '''strobing''' or '''choppy''', describes the perception of individual still images in a motion picture.

Motion pictures are made from still images shown in rapid sequence. Provided there is sufficient continuity between the images and provided the sequence is shown fast enough, the [[central nervous system]] interprets the sequence as continuous motion. However, some technologies cannot process or carry data fast enough for sufficiently high [[frame rate]]s. For example, viewing motion pictures by [[Internet]] connection generally necessitates a greatly reduced frame rate, making jerkiness clearly apparent.

In conventional [[cinematography]], the images are filmed and displayed at 24 frames per second, at which speed jerkiness is not normally discernible.
[[Television screen]]s [[refresh rate|refresh]] at even higher [[frequency|frequencies]]. [[PAL]] and [[SÉCAM]] television (the standards in [[Europe]]) refresh at 25 or 50 ([[HDTV]]) frames per second. [[NTSC]] television displays (the standard in [[North America]]) refresh at 29.97 frames per second.
[[Animated cartoon]] films are typically made at reduced frame rates (accomplished by shooting several [[film frame]]s of the individual drawings) so as to limit production costs, with the result that jerkiness tends to be apparent, especially on older [[limited animation]] features.

'''Strobing''' can also refer to [[cross colour]] and [[Moiré pattern|Moiré patterning]]. Cross colour refers to when any high frequency luminance content of the picture, close to the TV systems colour sub-carrier frequency, is interpreted by the analogue receiver's decoder as colour information. Moiré patterning is where an interference pattern is produced by fine scene detail beating with the line (or even [[pixel]]) structure of the device used to analyse or display the scene.

In [[electronics]] and [[telecommunications]], '''jitter''' is the deviation from true periodicity of a presumably [[Periodic function|periodic signal]], often in relation to a reference [[clock signal]]. In [[clock recovery]] applications it is called '''timing jitter'''.&lt;ref name=wol91p211&gt;{{cite book |last=Wolaver |first=Dan H. |date=1991 |title=Phase-Locked Loop Circuit Design |url=https://archive.org/details/phaselockedloopc00wola |url-access=limited |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-662743-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/phaselockedloopc00wola/page/n215 211]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jitter is a significant, and usually undesired, factor in the design of almost all communications links.

Jitter can be quantified in the same terms as all time-varying signals, e.g., [[root mean square]] (RMS), or peak-to-peak displacement.  Also like other time-varying signals, jitter can be expressed in terms of [[spectral density]].

'''Jitter period''' is the interval between two times of maximum effect (or minimum effect) of a signal characteristic that varies regularly with time.  '''Jitter frequency''', the more commonly quoted figure, is its inverse. [[ITU-T]] G.810 classifies jitter frequencies below 10&amp;nbsp;Hz as '''wander''' and frequencies at or above 10&amp;nbsp;Hz as jitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FTB-8080 Sync Analyzer: Resolving Synchronization Problems in Telecom Networks |publisher=EXFO |url=http://documents.exfo.com/appnotes/anote119-ang.pdf |id=Application note 119 |accessdate=2012-08-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207103425/http://documents.exfo.com/appnotes/anote119-ang.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jitter may be caused by [[electromagnetic interference]] and [[crosstalk]] with carriers of other signals. Jitter can cause a display monitor to flicker, affect the performance of processors in personal computers, introduce clicks or other undesired effects in audio signals, and cause loss of transmitted data between network devices. The amount of tolerable jitter depends on the affected application.

==Metrics==
For [[clock signal|clock]] jitter, there are three commonly used metrics:

;Absolute jitter 
:The [[absolute difference]] in the position of a clock's edge from where it would ideally be.

;Period jitter (a.k.a. ''cycle jitter'')
:The difference between any one clock period and the ideal or average clock period. Period jitter tends to be important in synchronous circuitry such as digital state machines where the error-free operation of the circuitry is limited by the shortest possible clock period (average period less maximum cycle jitter), and the performance of the circuitry is set by the average clock period. Hence, synchronous circuitry benefits from minimizing period jitter, so that the shortest clock period approaches the average clock period.

;Cycle-to-cycle jitter
:The difference in duration of any two adjacent clock periods.  It can be important for some types of clock generation circuitry used in [[microprocessor]]s and [[RAM]] interfaces.

In [[telecommunications]], the unit used for the above types of jitter is usually the [[Unit interval (data transmission)|unit interval]] (UI) which quantifies the jitter in terms of a fraction of the transmission unit period. This unit is useful because it scales with clock frequency and thus allows relatively slow interconnects such as [[Digital Signal 1|T1]] to be compared to higher-speed internet backbone links such as [[OC-192]].  Absolute units such as ''picoseconds'' are more common in microprocessor applications.  Units of ''degrees'' and ''radians'' are also used.

[[Image:standard deviation diagram.svg|thumb|350px|In the normal distribution one [[standard deviation]] from the [[mean]] (dark blue) accounts for about 68% of the set, while two standard deviations from the mean (medium and dark blue) account for about 95% and three standard deviations (light, medium, and dark blue) account for about 99.7%.]]
If jitter has a [[Gaussian distribution]], it is usually quantified using the [[standard deviation]] of this distribution. This translates to an RMS measurement for a zero-mean distribution.  Often, jitter distribution is significantly non-Gaussian.  This can occur if the jitter is caused by external sources such as power supply noise.  In these cases, ''peak-to-peak'' measurements may be more useful.  Many efforts have been made to meaningfully quantify distributions that are neither Gaussian nor have a meaningful peak level.  All have shortcomings but most tend to be good enough for the purposes of engineering work.  {{citation needed span|Note that typically, the reference point for jitter is defined such that the ''[[Arithmetic mean|mean]]'' jitter is 0.|date=March 2018}}

In [[computer network]]ing, jitter can refer to [[packet delay variation]], the variation ([[statistical dispersion]]) in the delay of the [[Packet (information technology)|packets]].

==Types==
One of the main differences between random and deterministic jitter is that deterministic jitter is bounded and random jitter is unbounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Julian |last1=Hagedorn |first2=Falk |last2=Alicke |first3=Ankur |last3=Verma |title=How to Measure Total Jitter |url=http://www.ti.com/lit/an/scaa120b/scaa120b.pdf |id=SCAA120B |date=August 2017 |publisher=[[Texas Instruments]] |access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding Jitter Calculations |url=http://teledynelecroy.com/doc/understanding-dj-ddj-pj-jitter-calculations |date=July 9, 2014 |publisher=[[Teledyne Technologies]] |access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Random jitter===
Random Jitter, also called Gaussian jitter, is unpredictable electronic timing noise. Random jitter typically follows a [[normal distribution]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Julian |last1=Hagedorn |first2=Falk |last2=Alicke |first3=Ankur |last3=Verma |title=How to Measure Total Jitter |url=http://www.ti.com/lit/an/scaa120b/scaa120b.pdf |id=SCAA120B |date=August 2017 |publisher=[[Texas Instruments]] |access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding Jitter Calculations |url=http://teledynelecroy.com/doc/understanding-dj-ddj-pj-jitter-calculations |date=July 9, 2014 |publisher=[[Teledyne Technologies]] |access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to being caused by [[thermal noise]] in an [[electrical circuit]] or due to the [[central limit theorem]].  The central limit theorem states that composite effect of many uncorrelated noise sources, regardless of the distributions, approaches a normal distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chow |first=Daniel |title=Jitter Visualization, Part 1: Random Jitter |url=http://www.edn.com/design/test-and-measurement/4423552/See-jitter-s-faces--Random--periodic--and-ISI |publisher=UBM Tech |accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deterministic jitter===
'''Deterministic jitter''' is a type of clock or data signal jitter that is predictable and reproducible. The peak-to-peak value of this jitter is bounded, and the bounds can easily be observed and predicted. Deterministic jitter has a known non-normal distribution. Deterministic jitter can either be correlated to the data stream ([[data-dependent jitter]]) or uncorrelated to the data stream (bounded uncorrelated jitter). Examples of data-dependent jitter are duty-cycle dependent jitter (also known as duty-cycle distortion) and [[intersymbol interference]].

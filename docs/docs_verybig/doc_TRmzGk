Saddles, bridles, hobbles, and ropes were needed if the party had a horse or riding mule, and many men did. Extra harnesses and spare wagon parts were often carried. Most carried steel shoes for horses, mules, or livestock. Tar was carried to help repair an ox's injured hoof.

Goods, supplies, and equipment were often shared by fellow travelers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Unruh|1993|pp= 149–155|ps=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Items that were forgotten, broken, or worn out could be bought from a fellow traveler, post, or fort along the way. New iron shoes for horses, mules, and oxen were put on by blacksmiths found along the way. Equipment repairs and other goods could be procured from blacksmith shops established at some forts and some ferries. Emergency supplies, repairs, and livestock were often provided by local residents in California, Oregon, and Utah for late travelers on the trail who were hurrying to beat the snow.

Non-essential items were often abandoned to lighten the load, or in case of emergency. Many travelers would salvage discarded items, picking up essentials or leaving behind their lower quality item when a better one was found abandoned along the road. Some profited by collecting discarded items, hauling them back to jumping off places, and reselling them. In the early years, Mormons sent scavenging parties back along the trail to salvage as much iron and other supplies as possible and haul it to Salt Lake City, where supplies of all kinds were needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Unruh|1993|pp= 149–150|ps=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others would use discarded furniture, wagons, and wheels as firewood. During the 1849 gold rush, [[Fort Laramie]] was known as &quot;Camp Sacrifice&quot; because of the large amounts merchandise discarded nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Unruh|1993|p= 150|ps=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Travelers had pushed along the relatively easy path to Fort Laramie with their luxury items but discarded them before the difficult mountain crossing ahead, and after discovering that many items could be purchased at the forts or located for free along the way. Some travelers carried their excess goods to Salt Lake City to be sold.

Professional tools used by blacksmiths, carpenters, and farmers were carried by nearly all. Axes, crow bars, hammers, hatchets, hoes, mallets, mattocks, picks, planes, saws, scythes, and shovels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = Oregon Trail Center |url = http://www.oregontrailcenter.org/HistoricalTrails/Supplies.htm |title = Supplies }}&lt;/ref&gt; were used to clear or make a road through brush or trees, cut down the banks to cross a wash or steep banked stream, build a raft or bridge, or repair the wagon. In general, as little road work as possible was done. Travel was often along the top of ridges to avoid the brush and washes common in many valleys.

== Statistics ==
Overall, some 268,000 pioneers used the Oregon Trail and its three primary offshoots, the [[Bozeman Trail|Bozeman]], [[California Trail|California]], and [[Mormon Trail|Mormon]] trails, to reach the West Coast, 1840–1860. Another 48,000 headed to Utah. There is no estimate on how many used it to return East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Unruh |title = The Plains Across: The Overland Emigrants and the Trans-Mississippi West, 1840–1860 |date = 1992 |pages = 119–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the trail statistics for the early years were recorded by the U.S. Army at [[Fort Laramie, Wyoming]], from about 1849 to 1855. None of these original statistical records have been found—the Army either lost them or destroyed them. Only some partial written copies of the Army records and notes recorded in several diaries have survived.

Emigration to California spiked considerably with the [[Gold Rush of 1849|1849 gold rush]]. Following the discovery of gold, California remained the destination of choice for most emigrants on the trail up to 1860, with almost 200,000 people traveling there between 1849 and 1860.

Travel diminished after 1860, as the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] caused considerable disruptions on the trail. Many of the people on the trail in 1861–1863 were fleeing the war and its attendant drafts in both the south and the north. Trail historian Merrill J. Mattes&lt;ref&gt;Mattes, Merrill J.; op. cit.; p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; has estimated the number of emigrants for 1861–1867 given in the total column of the above table. But these estimates may well be low since they only amount to an extra 125,000 people, and the 1870 census shows that over 200,000 additional people (ignoring most of the population increase in California, which had excellent sea and rail connections across Panama by then) showed up in all the states served by the Bozeman, California, Mormon, and Oregon Trail(s) and their offshoots.

Mormon emigration records after 1860 are reasonably accurate, as newspaper and other accounts in Salt Lake City give most of the names of emigrants arriving each year from 1847 to 1868.&lt;ref name=&quot;lds.org&quot;/&gt; Gold and silver strikes in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Oregon caused a considerable increase in people using the trails, often in directions different from the original trail users.

Though the numbers are significant in the context of the times, far more people chose to remain at home in the 31 states. Between 1840 and 1860, the population of the United States rose by 14&amp;nbsp;million, yet only about 300,000 decided to make the trip. Many were discouraged by the cost, effort and danger of the trip. Western scout Kit Carson is thought to have said, &quot;The cowards never started and the weak died on the way&quot;, though the general saying was written{{when|reason=Isn't this statement meant to establish primacy of the source, based on an earlier date?|date=March 2015}} by [[Joaquin Miller]], in reference to the [[California gold rush]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Californian: Old Californians&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal = The Californian |title = The Californian |editor = A.

Coffman, 1993, ''Blazing a Wagon Trail to Oregon''&lt;/ref&gt;

Many who went were between the ages 12 and 24. Between 1860 and 1870, the U.S. population increased by seven million; about 350,000 of this increase was in the Western states.

These census numbers show a 363,000 population increase in the western states and territories between 1860 and 1870. Some of this increase is because of a high birth rate in the western states and territories, but most is from emigrants moving from the east to the west and new immigration from Europe. Much of the increase in California and Oregon is from emigration by ship, as there was fast and reasonably low cost transportation via east and west coast steamships and the Panama Railroad after 1855. The census numbers imply at least 200,000 emigrants (or more) used some variation of the California/Oregon/Mormon/Bozeman trails to get to their new homes between 1860 and 1870.

=== Costs ===
The cost of traveling over the Oregon Trail and its extensions varied from nothing to a few hundred dollars per person. Women seldom went alone. The cheapest way was to hire on to help drive the wagons or herds, allowing one to make the trip for nearly nothing or even make a small profit. Those with capital could often buy livestock in the [[Midwest]] and drive the stock to California or Oregon for profit. About 60 to 80&amp;nbsp;percent of the travelers were farmers and as such already owned a wagon, livestock team, and many of the necessary supplies. This lowered the cost of the trip to about $50 per person for food and other items. Families planned the trip months in advance and made much of the extra clothing and many other items needed. Individuals buying most of the needed items would end up spending between $150–$200 per person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Dary |first = David |title = The Oregon Trail an American Saga |publisher = Alfred P.

The route west was arduous and fraught with many dangers, but the number of deaths on the trail is not known with any precision; there are only wildly varying estimates. Estimating is difficult because of the common practice of burying people in unmarked graves that were intentionally disguised to avoid their being dug up by animals or natives. Graves were often put in the middle of a trail and then run over by the livestock to make them difficult to find. Disease was the main killer of trail travelers; [[cholera]] killed up to 3 percent of all travelers in the epidemic years from 1849 to 1855.

Native attacks increased significantly after 1860, when most of the army troops were withdrawn, and miners and ranchers began fanning out all over the country, often encroaching on Native American territory. Increased attacks along the Humboldt led to most travelers' taking the [[Central Nevada Route]]. The Goodall cutoff, developed in Idaho in 1862, kept Oregon bound travelers away from much of the native trouble nearer the [[Snake River]]. Other trails were developed that traveled further along the [[South Platte]] to avoid local Native American hot spots.

Other common causes of death included [[hypothermia]], drowning in river crossings, getting run over by wagons, and accidental gun deaths. Later, more family groups started traveling, and many more bridges and ferries were being put in, so fording a dangerous river became much less common and dangerous. Surprisingly few people were taught to swim in this era. Being run over was a major cause of death, despite the wagons' only averaging 2–3 miles per hour. The wagons could not easily be stopped, and people, particularly children, were often trying to get on and off the wagons while they were moving—not always successfully. Another hazard was a dress getting caught in the wheels and pulling the person under. Accidental shootings declined significantly after Fort Laramie, as people became more familiar with their weapons and often just left them in their wagons. Carrying around a ten-pound rifle all day soon became tedious and usually unnecessary, as the perceived threat of natives faded and hunting opportunities receded.

A significant number of travelers were suffering from [[scurvy]] by the end of their trips. Their typical flour and salted pork/bacon diet had very little [[vitamin C]] in it. The diet in the mining camps was also typically low in fresh vegetables and fruit, which indirectly led to early deaths of many of the inhabitants. Some believe that scurvy deaths may have rivaled cholera as a killer, with most deaths occurring after the victim reached California.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, Volney M.D. ''Bleed, Blister, and Purge: A History of Medicine on the American Frontier''. Mountain Press Publishing Company, 2005. pp 115, 116. {{ISBN|978-0-87842-505-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miscellaneous deaths included deaths by childbirth, falling trees, flash floods, homicides, kicks by animals, lightning strikes, snake bites, and stampedes. According to an evaluation by John Unruh,&lt;ref name=unruh1993-408-410,516 /&gt; a 4 percent death rate or 16,000 out of 400,000 total pioneers on all trails may have died on the trail.

Reaching the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] before the start of the winter storms was critical for a successful completion of a trip. The most famous failure in that regard was that of the [[Donner Party]], whose members struggled to traverse what is today called [[Donner Pass]], in November 1846. When the last survivor was rescued in April 1847, 33 men, women, and children had died at [[Donner Lake]]; with some of the 48 survivors confessing to having resorted to [[cannibalism]] to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Peters|1996|pp=102-109|ps=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disease ===
Disease was the biggest killer on the Oregon Trail. [[Cholera]] was responsible for taking many lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Rosenburg |first = Charles |title = The Cholera Years:The United States in 1832, 1849 and 1866 |location = Chicago |year = 1987 |isbn = 978-0226726779 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a [[fecal-oral]] disease, it commonly resulted from consuming food or water contaminated by the bacterium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Waldor |first1 = Matthew |last2 = Ryan |first2 = Edward |title = Mandell, Douglas and Bennett's Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases |chapter = Vibrio Cholerae |publisher = Saunders |year = 2011 |pages = 2471–2479 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because a dead traveler would often be buried at the site of death, nearby streams could easily be contaminated by the dead body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Reminiscences of Experience on the Oregon Trail in 1844 |journal = The Quarterly of the Oregon Historical Society |volume = 2 |issue = 3 |pages = 209–254 |first = John |last = Minto |year = 1901 |jstor = 20609503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other common diseases along the trail included [[dysentery]], an intestinal infection that causes diarrhea containing blood or mucus,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |volume = 47 |issue = 5 |pages = 333–335 |pmc = 1752697 |year = 1937 |pmid = 18744287 |title = Dysentery |journal = California and Western Medicine }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[typhoid fever]], another fecal-oral disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Barnett |first = Richard |title = Typhoid Fever |journal = The Lancet |volume = 388 |issue = 10059 |pages = 2467 |doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)32178-X |pmid = 28328460 |year = 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Airborne diseases also commonly affected travelers.  One such disease was [[diphtheria]], to which young children were particularly susceptible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = To End an Epidemic Lessons from the History of Diphtheria |first = Lawrence |last = Kleinman |journal = The New England Journal of Medicine |year = 1992 |volume = 326 |issue = 11 |pages = 773–7 |doi = 10.1056/NEJM199203123261118 |pmid = 1738395 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It could spread quickly in close quarters, such as the parties that traveled the trail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=DIPTHERIA|journal=Diptheria.: Its Origin and Cure.|volume=39|pages=32|id={{ProQuest|136627001}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Measles]] was also a difficulty, as it is highly contagious and can have an [[incubation period]] of ten days or longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last = Gershone | first = Anne | title =Mandell, Douglas and Bennett's Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases | chapter = Measles Virus (Rubeola) | publisher = Saunders | year = 2011 | pages = 1967–1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Diseases could spread particularly quickly because settlers had no place to [[quarantine]] the sick and because poor sanitation was typical along the route.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/index.html |title = Influenza (Flu) |website = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date = October 26, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other trails west ==
There were other possible migration paths for early settlers, miners, or travelers to California or Oregon besides the Oregon trail prior to the establishment of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad|transcontinental railroad]]s.

From 1821–1846, the Hudson's Bay Company twice annually used the York Factory Express overland trade route from Fort Vancouver to [[Hudson Bay]] then on to London. James Sinclair led a large party of nearly 200 settlers from the Red River Colony in 1841. These northern routes were largely abandoned after Britain ceded its claim to the southern Columbia River basin by way of the Oregon Treaty of 1846.

The longest trip was the voyage of about {{convert|13600|to|15000|mi|km}} on an uncomfortable sailing ship rounding the treacherous, cold, and dangerous Cape Horn between [[Antarctica]] and South America and then sailing on to California or Oregon. This trip typically took four to seven months (120 to 210 days) and cost about $350 to $500. The cost could be reduced to zero if you signed on as a crewman and worked as a common seaman. The hundreds of abandoned ships, whose crews had deserted in San Francisco Bay in 1849–50, showed many thousands chose to do this.

Other routes involved taking a ship to [[Colón, Panama]] (then called Aspinwall) and a strenuous, disease ridden, five- to seven-day trip by canoe and mule over the Isthmus of Panama before catching a ship from [[Panama City, Panama]] to Oregon or California. This trip could be done from the east coast theoretically in less than two months if all ship connections were made without waits and typically cost about $450/person. Catching a fatal disease was a distinct possibility as [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in 1852 learned when his unit of about 600 soldiers and some of their dependents traversed the Isthmus and lost about 120 men, women, and children.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks D. Simpson; Ulysses S. Grant: Triumph Over Adversity, 1822–1865; 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-395-65994-6}}, pg. 55&lt;/ref&gt; This passage was considerably sped up and made safer in 1855 when the Panama Railroad was completed at terrible cost in money and life across the Isthmus. The once treacherous {{convert|50|mi|km|adj=on}} trip could be done in less than a day. The time and the cost for transit dropped as regular paddle wheel steamships and sailing ships went from ports on the east coast and New Orleans, Louisiana, to Colón, Panama ($80–$100), across the Isthmus of Panama by railroad ($25) and by paddle wheel steamships and sailing ships to ports in California and Oregon ($100–$150).

Another route was established by [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]] across [[Nicaragua]] in 1849. The {{convert|120|mi|km|adj=on}} long [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|San Juan River]] to the Atlantic Ocean helps drain the {{convert|100|mi|km|adj=on}} long [[Lake Nicaragua]]. From the western shore of Lake Nicaragua it is only about {{convert|12|mi|km}} to the Pacific Ocean. Vanderbilt decided to use paddle wheel steam ships from the U.S. to the San Juan River, small paddle wheel steam launches on the San Juan River, boats across Lake Nicaragua, and a stage coach to the Pacific where connections could be made with another ship headed to California, Oregon, etc.. Vanderbilt, by undercutting fares to the Isthmus of Panama and stealing many of the Panama Railroad workers, managed to attract roughly 30% of the California bound steam boat traffic. All his connections in Nicaragua were never completely worked out before the Panama Railroad's completion in 1855. Civil strife in Nicaragua and a payment to Cornelius Vanderbilt of a &quot;non-compete&quot; payment (bribe) of $56,000 per year killed the whole project in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.costarica-net-guide.com/vanderbilt.html |title = Nicaragua Route }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible route consisted of taking a ship to Mexico traversing the country and then catching another ship out of [[Acapulco, Mexico|Acapulco]], Mexico to California etc. This route was used by some adventurous travelers but was not too popular because of the difficulties of making connections and the often hostile population along the way.

The Gila Trail going along the [[Gila River]] in [[Arizona]], across the [[Colorado River]] and then across the [[Sonora Desert]] in California was scouted by [[Stephen Kearny]]'s troops and later by Captain [[Philip St. George Cooke]]'s [[Mormon Battalion]] in 1846 who were the first to take a wagon the whole way. This route was used by many gold hungry miners in 1849 and later but suffered from the disadvantage that you had to find a way across the very wide and very dry Sonora Desert. It was used by many in 1849 and later as a winter crossing to California, despite its many disadvantages.

Running from 1857 to 1861, the Butterfield Stage Line won the $600,000/yr. U.S. mail contract to deliver mail to San Francisco, California. As dictated by southern Congressional members, the {{convert|2800|mi|km|adj=on}} route ran from [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], Missouri through [[Arkansas]], [[Indian Territory|Oklahoma Indian Territory]], Texas, [[New Mexico Territory]], and across the Sonora Desert before ending in San Francisco, California. Employing over 800 at its peak, it used 250 [[Stagecoach#Concord stagecoaches|Concord Stagecoaches]] seating 12 very crowded passengers in three rows. It used 1,800 head of stock, horses and mules and 139 relay stations to ensure the stages ran day and night. A one way fare of $200 delivered a very thrashed and tired passenger into San Francisco in 25 to 28 days. After traveling the route, ''[[New York Herald]]'' reporter Waterman Ormsby said, &quot;I now know what Hell is like. I've just had 24 days of it.&quot;

Other ways to get to Oregon were: using the York Factory Express route across Canada, and down the Columbia River; ships from Hawaii, San Francisco, or other ports that stopped in Oregon; emigrants trailing up from California, etc. All provided a trickle of emigrants, but they were soon overwhelmed in numbers by the emigrants coming over the Oregon Trail.

The ultimate competitor arrived in 1869, the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], which cut travel time to about seven days at a low fare of about $60 (economy)&lt;ref&gt;[http://cprr.org/Museum/FAQs.html#Fare Railroad fares 1869] Retrieved February 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
One of the enduring legacies of the Oregon Trail is the expansion of the United States territory to the West Coast. Without the many thousands of United States settlers in Oregon and California, and thousands more on their way each year, it is highly unlikely that this would have occurred.

===Arts, entertainment, and media===
The western expansion, and the Oregon Trail in particular, inspired numerous creative works about the settlers' experiences.

====Commemorative coin====
The [[Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar]] was coined to commemorate the route. Issued intermittently between 1926 and 1939, 202,928 were sold to the public. With 131,050 minted in 1926, that year's issue remains readily available for collectors.

====Music====
The Oregon Trail has featured in various songs, especially in [[western music (North America)|western music]] genres.

&quot;The Oregon Trail&quot; is a song written by [[Peter DeRose]] and [[Billy Hill (songwriter)|Billy Hill]], recorded by [[singing cowboy]] artist [[Tex Ritter]] in 1935, and by Australian country musician [[Tex Morton]] in 1936.

[[Woody Guthrie]] wrote and recorded a song entitled &quot;Oregon Trail&quot; while travelling in the region in 1941. It was the opening track in his ''[[Columbia River Collection]]'' album.

====Games====
The story of the Oregon Trail inspired the educational video game series ''[[The Oregon Trail (series)|The Oregon Trail]]'', which became widely popular in the 1980s and early 1990s.

In 2014 a musical named ''The Trail to Oregon'', based on ''The Oregon Trail'' game, with music and lyrics by Jeff Blim and a book by Jeff Blim, Nick Lang and Matt Lang was performed in Chicago and later posted to YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='The Trail to Oregon' musical review: A new kind of Starkid show |url=https://www.hypable.com/starkids-trail-to-oregon-musical-review/ |website=Hypable |access-date=May 22, 2020 |date=July 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

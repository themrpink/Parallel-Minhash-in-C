==Production==
===Pre-production===
The lead role of Luc was originally written for [[Gérard Depardieu]], but Kevin Kline accepted the role when Depardieu was not available for the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent&quot;/&gt;

===Filming===
Principal photography took place from September 17 to December 22, 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;tcm-misc&quot;/&gt; ''French Kiss'' was filmed primarily in Paris, the [[Alpes-Maritimes]] [[Departments of France|department]] in the [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]] [[Regions of France|region]] of southeastern France, and [[Cannes]].

In Paris, scenes were shot at the [[Hotel George V]], where Kate has her encounters with the supercilious concierge. The hotel lobby was used for the scene where the petty thief Bob steals Kate's bag after she faints. Several scenes show the [[Eiffel Tower]] in the background—the one site Kate longs to see most but keeps on missing. A phonebooth on [[Champs-Élysées]] near the [[Arc de Triomphe]] was used for the scene where Kate calls Charlie's mother. Scenes were also filmed at the [[Embassy of the United States, Paris|American Embassy]] at 2 Avenue Gabriel, and the [[Embassy of Canada, Paris|Canadian Embassy]] at 35 [[Avenue Montaigne]]. The scene where Luc throws money on the sidewalk was filmed at the corner of rue Paul-Albert and rue Feutrier in [[Montmartre]].

Driving scenes in Paris were filmed in front of the [[Louvre]] near the [[Louvre Pyramid]], along the [[Rive Droite]], and on [[Rue des Rosiers]], where Luc drives down a narrow, winding cobblestoned street. Additional Paris scenes were filmed at the [[Sacré-Cœur, Paris|Sacré-Cœur]] in Montmartre, the Grande Pharmacie de la Place Blanche at 5 [[Place Blanche]], the [[Trocadéro|Palais de Chaillot]], and [[Abbesses (Paris Métro)#Location|Place des Abbesses]], where Kate and Luc discuss his &quot;little problem&quot;. The final scene filmed in Paris was at the [[Gare Saint-Lazare]] train station, where Luc is chased by Inspector Jean-Paul Cardon while trying to board a train south to Cannes.{{efn-ua|In fact the train to Cannes leaves from [[Gare de Lyon]] station, and not from Gare Saint-Lazare station.}}

In the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region, the small village of [[Valbonne]], about fifteen minutes north of Cannes, was used for several scenes, including the scene where Luc fights with his brother in the main village square in front of the Hotel les Armoiries, an old seventeenth century building. Other scenes were filmed at the train station and nearby vineyards around the small hamlet of La Ravelle, which is part of the town of [[Paulhaguet]] in the [[Haute-Loire]] department in the [[Auvergne]] region of south central France. The train station near Meyrargues, [[Bouches-du-Rhône]], was also used in one scene.

In Cannes, several exterior shots of the Carlton Hotel were used to represent where the four main characters stay. There are interior scenes of the lobby and the brasserie used for morning breakfasts. Other scenes filmed here include the beach in front of the hotel along with the adjacent waterfront—in particular the [[Cartier (jeweler)|Cartier]] boutique on the next corner. The grape harvest scenes were filmed at [[Château Val Joanis]] in [[Pertuis]], [[Vaucluse]]. Studio scenes were shot at [[Billancourt Studios|Paris Studios Cinéma]].

===Title===
The film was originally titled ''Paris Match'', a play on the name of the famous [[Paris Match|French newsmagazine]]. However, the title had to be changed after [[Billy Crystal]] challenged it with the [[MPAA]] as being too close to that of his own Paris-set romantic comedy ''[[Forget Paris]]'', released just two weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ew.com/article/1995/07/14/paris-match-became-french-kiss/ &quot;''Paris Match'' became ''French Kiss''] by Cindy Pearlman, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', July 14, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soundtrack===
The ''French Kiss Original Soundtrack'' album was released by [[Mercury Records]] on CD on May 9, 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;/&gt; It peaked at 170 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;/&gt;

==Release==
===Critical response===
''French Kiss'' was released in United States on May 5, 1995,&lt;ref name=&quot;tcm-misc&quot;/&gt; and received mixed reviews. In his review in the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', Mick LaSalle wrote that director Lawrence Kasdan &quot;takes what could have been a fluffy comedy with lots of plot complications and picturesque scenery and instead puts his focus on the important things: on the characters played by Ryan and Kline and how they happen to be feeling.&quot; LaSalle also applauded Kasdan's sense of subtle comedy:

{{quote|With his attention in the right place, Kasdan comes up with ways of using the setting to make emotional points. For example, though the film doesn't go out of its way to make you notice, Ryan keeps missing out on getting to see the Eiffel Tower. It's behind her as she's riding in a car, or she's turning toward it a second after they've turned out the lights. She doesn't know what she's missing—until eventually she does.}}
LaSalle found Kline's performance &quot;extraordinary&quot; and that he not only perfected the accent but the &quot;speech rhythms and the manner as well.&quot; LaSalle also praised Ryan's comic timing, which &quot;continues to delight.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate&quot;/&gt;

In her review in ''The Washington Post'', Rita Kempley, giving it a mixed review, wrote that the film &quot;isn't as passionate as the title suggests—in fact, it's facile—but Ryan and Kevin Kline, as her attractive opposite, are irresistible together.&quot; Kempley applauded the acting performances:

{{quote|Kline's hilariously hammy l'accent puts Inspector Clouseau's to shame; his performance is the zaniest since ''[[A Fish Called Wanda]]''. Ryan's Kate is even pickier than the heroine in ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'' and melts just as endearingly. She and Kline spar convincingly; Doris Day and Rock Hudson had sexier scenes, but none this romantic.&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtonpost&quot;/&gt;}}

In his review in the ''Chicago Sun-Times'', a disappointed Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;The characters in this movie may look like adults, but they think like teenagers.&quot; Although he acknowledged that the film was not without its charms—Paris and Cannes being &quot;two of the most photogenic cities on earth&quot;—Ebert concluded, &quot;Kline's Frenchman is somehow not worldly enough, and Ryan's heroine never convinces us she ever loved her fiancé in the first place.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ebert&quot;/&gt;

In her review in ''The New York Times'', Janet Maslin called the film a &quot;romantic comedy with barely a laugh or a spark, and with a pace that makes it feel longer than Mr. Kasdan's previous work, ''[[Wyatt Earp (film)|Wyatt Earp]]''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes-maslin&quot;/&gt;

Review aggregation website ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'' gives the film a score of 48% based on reviews from 25 critics.&lt;ref name=&quot;rotten&quot;/&gt;

===Box office===
The film earned $38,896,854 in the United States and an additional $63,086,000 in international markets for a total worldwide gross of $101,982,854.&lt;ref name=&quot;mojo&quot;/&gt;

'''Journaled File System''' ('''JFS''') is a [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] [[journaling file system]] created by [[IBM]]. There are versions for [[IBM AIX|AIX]], [[OS/2]], [[eComStation]], [[ArcaOS]] and [[Linux]] [[operating system]]s. The latter is available as free software under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL). [[HP-UX]] has another, different filesystem named JFS that is actually an OEM version of [[Veritas Software]]'s [[VxFS]].

In the AIX operating system, there exist two generations of JFS filesystem that are called ''JFS'' (''JFS1'') and ''JFS2'' respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;faq&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=A Mini-FAQ for JFS |publisher=JFS for Linux project |url=http://jfs.sourceforge.net/project/pub/faq.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JFS1vsJFS2&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Comparison of JFS1 and JFS2 on AIX |publisher=IBM |url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/pseries/v5r3/topic/com.ibm.aix.baseadmn/doc/baseadmndita/fs_jfs_jfs2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other operating systems, such as OS/2 and Linux, only the second generation exists and is called simply ''JFS''.&lt;ref name=&quot;interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview with the People Behind JFS, ReiserFS &amp; XFS |url=http://www.osnews.com/story.php/69/Interview-With-the-People-Behind-JFS-ReiserFS-and-XFS}}&lt;/ref&gt; This should not be confused with JFS in [[AIX operating system|AIX]] that actually refers to JFS1.

== History ==
IBM introduced JFS with the initial release of AIX version 3.1 in February 1990. This file system, now called ''JFS1 on AIX'', was the premier file system for AIX over the following decade and was installed in thousands or millions of customers' AIX systems. Historically, the JFS1 file system is very closely tied to the memory manager of AIX,&lt;ref name=&quot;faq&quot; /&gt; which is a typical design for a file system supporting only one operating system. JFS was one of the first file systems to support [[Journaling file system|Journaling]]

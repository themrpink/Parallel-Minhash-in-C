==History==
Several civilizations settled in Milazzo and left signs of their presence from the Neolithic age. In Homer's ''Odyssey'' Milazzo is presumably the place where Ulysses is shipwrecked and meets [[Polyphemus]].

Historically, the town originated as the ancient ''Mylae'' ({{lang-grc|Μύλαι}}), an outpost of [[Zancle]], occupied before 648 BC, perhaps as early as 716 BC.&lt;ref&gt;E. A. Freeman, ''History of Sicily'', I., pp. 395, 587&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-grc1:3.90 Thucydides, Peloponnesian War, §3.90]&lt;/ref&gt;
It was taken by the Athenians in 426 BC. The people of [[Reggio Calabria|Rhegium]] planted the exiles from [[Naxos]] and [[Catana]] in 395 BC as a counterpoise to [[Dionysius the Elder]]'s foundation of [[Tyndaris]]; but Dionysius soon took it. In the bay [[Gaius Duilius]] won [[battle of Mylae|the first Roman naval victory]] over the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] (260 BC).

In 36 BC the naval [[Battle of Mylae]] was fought offshore.  The fleet of [[Octavian]], commanded by [[Marcus Agrippa]], engaged that of [[Sextus Pompey]].  While the battle was nearly a draw, Sextus could not replace his losses, and was thus weaker at the following [[Battle of Naulochus]] (36 BC), where he was utterly defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Dio 49.1–18&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], under the [[Byzantine]]s, the town became one of the first episcopal seats of Sicily. In the 9th century Milazzo was conquered by the Arabs, who built the first nucleus of the castle here.
[[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II of Hohenstaufen]] further fortified the town and created a personal hunting park. The castle was later mostly rebuilt in the age of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V of Spain]].

Milazzo was also the seat of [[Battle of Milazzo (1718)|a battle in 1718]] between Spain and Austria, and of [[Battle of Milazzo (1860)|another fought]] by [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] against the [[Kingdom of Two Sicilies]] during his [[Expedition of the Thousand]].

==Geography==
Milazzo borders with the municipalities of [[Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto]], [[Merì]] and [[San Filippo del Mela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|r|39568|Milazzo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milazzo is the point of reference of a vast territory, from [[Villafranca Tirrena]] to [[Patti, Sicily|Patti]] (over 200,000 inhabitants). Is also, an important centre of the Strait of Messina Metropolitan Area (who also includes areas of [[Reggio Calabria]]), with the nearby town [[Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto]]. Located at the base of a peninsula that juts into the Tyrrhenian Sea with a small promontory, the town is {{convert|43|km|mi}} from the city of [[Messina]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Main sights==
[[File:Milazzo, chiesa del carmine 01.JPG|left|thumb|The church of the Carmine.]]
*[[Castle of Milazzo]]. Begun by the Arabs, enlarged by the Normans, restored and strengthened by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], it is surrounded by walls with round towers built under [[Alfonso V of Aragon]], with a Gothic portal dating from the 14th century. Near the castle are the ruins of the fourteenth-century palace of the grand jury and the old cathedral (1603) probably built on a design by architect Camillo Camillians.

Other sights include:
*the Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel
*the Baroque Church of the Holy Crucifix (1629), housing a wooden canopy from the 18th century and a wooden crucifix from the early 17th century.
*Rock church of St. Anthony of Padua
*Sanctuary of St. Francis of Paola

==Economy==
Over time, the town is moving forward towards the sea by recording a continuous development of [[agriculture]] and fishing activities, [[Commerce|commercial]] and [[Industry (manufacturing)|industrial]].

==Transportation==
The port of Milazzo is a departure point for ferries to the [[Aeolian Islands]] and [[Naples]].

==History==

===Ancient history===
The site of the town has been populated since prehistoric times, as many archaeological excavations have shown through the years. Its documented history begins in 409 BC after the [[Battle of Himera (409 BC)|second Battle of Himera]] when its more ancient neighbour, [[Himera]] (now completely within the ''comune's'' borders), was completely destroyed by the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] army under [[Hannibal Mago]]. Those who survived the devastation moved to a site then called &quot;Thermae&quot; which is today known as Termini and became the successor to Himera. The new town of Thermae or Therma, called for the sake of distinction Thermae Himerenses, obviously derived its name from the hot springs for which it was celebrated, and the first discovery of which was connected by legends with the wanderings of [[Hercules]].&lt;ref&gt;Diod. iv. 23, v. 3; [[Pindar|Pind.]] ''Ol.'' xii. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears to have quickly become a considerable town, though it continued to be subject to Carthaginian rule.

In the [[First Punic War]] its name is repeatedly mentioned. In 260 BC, a body of [[ancient Rome|Roman]] troops were encamped in the neighbourhood when they were attacked by [[Hamilcar]] and defeated with heavy loss.&lt;ref&gt;Pol. i. 24; Diod. xxiii. 9. Exc. H. p.&amp;nbsp;503.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Roman age====
Before the close of the First Punic War (241 BC), Thermae was besieged and taken by the Romans&lt;ref&gt;Pol. i. 39; Diod. xxiii. 20. Exc. H. p.&amp;nbsp;506.&lt;/ref&gt; but the city seems to have been treated with unusual favour by its conquerors. [[Cicero]] tells us that the Romans allowed the Thermitani to govern their city and territory with their own laws as a reward for their steady fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;Cic. ''Verr.'' ii: 37&lt;/ref&gt; As they were on hostile terms with Rome during the First Punic War, it can only be to the subsequent period that this &quot;fidelity&quot; applies.

In the time of Cicero (80-40 BC), Thermae appears to have been a flourishing place, carrying on a considerable amount of trade, though he speaks of it as ''oppidum non maximum''.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' ii. 46, 75, iii. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; He  attested the magnificence of the ancient city and the taste of its citizens for the encouragement of art,  calling it ''in primis Siciliae clarum et ornatum'' as statues were preserved by the Thermitani to whom they had been restored by Scipio after the conquest of Carthage.&lt;ref&gt;Cic. ''Verr.'' ii. 3. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems to have become a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]] in the time of [[Augustus]] (27 BC - 14 AD), whence we find mention in inscriptions of the ''Ordo et Populus splendidissimae Coloniae Augustae Himeraeorum Thermitanorum''.&lt;ref&gt;Castell. ''Inscr. Sicil.'' p.&amp;nbsp;47; Gruter. ''Inscr.'' p.&amp;nbsp;433, no. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Thermae ''colonia'' is mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and must refer to this town, though he seems to confuse it with Thermae Selinuntiae (modern [[Sciacca]]) on the south coast which was not a ''colony''.&lt;ref&gt;Plin. iii. 8. s. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are few subsequent accounts of Thermae; but, as its name is found in [[Ptolemy]] and the Itineraries, and from the impressive aqueduct and some other remains it appears to have continued in existence throughout the period of the [[Roman Empire]], and probably never ceased to be inhabited, as the modern town of Termini Imerese retains the ancient site as well as name.&lt;ref&gt;Ptol. iii. 4. § 4; [[Antonine Itinerary|Itin. Ant.]] p.&amp;nbsp;92; [[Tabula Peutingeriana]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval and modern eras===
Following the fall of the Roman Empire, the city entered a period of decline. Termini continued to exist as a bishopric until the 12th century, though the list of bishops contains various gaps and uncertainties. Under [[Normans of Sicily|Norman rule]], the city was at first a royal city; it subsequently became one of 42 ''città demaniali'', cities administered directly by the crown rather than local nobility. Above all, from the Middle Ages through the beginning of the 19th century, Termini served as a major center for the collection and shipping of grain and other foodstuffs stored and subjected to duty in a special government warehouse complex (the ''caricatore regio''). The presence of the ''caricatore'' improved the fortunes of the city, turning it into one of the major ports of Sicily and strengthening its commercial relationships with the maritime republics of [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] as well as the major Mediterranean ports (Marseille, Barcelona, etc.) and, during the 16th century, those of the Atlantic. Towards the end of the 18th century, Termini became the site of the Ereina Imerese branch of the Ereina di Palermo academy, followed soon thereafter by the establishment of the Accademia Euracea, later the Accademia Mediterranea Euracea. In the 19th century, however, the closing of the ''caricatore'' precipitated a profound economic crisis that lasted until the end of the 20th century, when artisanal and proto-industrial activity began to replace the traditional agricultural base of the city's economy. A period of population decline, linked primarily to [[Italian American|emigration to the Americas]], was balanced at the beginning of the 20th century by immigration from [[Agrigento]], [[Messina]] and [[Ragusa, Sicily|Ragusa]].

Between 1970 and 2011, Termini was home to a large [[Fiat]] automobile manufacturing facility, where small cars such as the [[Fiat 126|126]], the original [[Fiat Panda|Panda]], and the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] have been manufactured. The plant was the sole assembly site for the second generation [[Lancia Ypsilon]] built between 2005 and 2011. In 2006 the plant celebrated its four millionth car produced.[http://www.samar.pl/__/__la/en/__ac/sec,4/new/9694/__Four-million-cars-manufactured-at-Fiat-Termini-Imerese-plant.html] At the end of 2011, Fiat sold the plant to Chinese car manufacturer Chery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://motoring.asiaone.com/Motoring/News/Story/A1Story20120221-329290.html Asiaone Motoring: Chinese car makers closing gap with Europe brands]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1 January 2015, has been owned by [[Blutec]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leggo.it/NEWS/ECONOMIA/termini_imerese_firmato_accordo_ministero_fiat_addio_arriva_blutec/notizie/1083947.shtml News in Leggo]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a power station operated by Enel with a generation capacity of 454 MW.

==Main sights==
[[File:Termini Imerese aquaduct.jpg|300px|thumb|Roman aqueduct]]

*Roman aqueduct bridge with two tiers of arches and other parts of the '''aqueduct of Cornelius'''
*Roman amphitheatre probably from the Augustan age built into houses between Via Garibaldi and Via San Marco. It has a double ambulatory, a remarkable for such a small building (around 98 x 75 m). The cavea was partly excavated and partly built up: a part of the lower order of the arches remains visible high on the western part (in via Anfiteatro).
*[[Temple of Victory (Himera)|Temple of Victory at Himera]]
*Cathedral of St. Nicholas of Bari (1604). It houses a statue by [[Giorgio da Milano]] (1487) and several works by [[Ignazio Marabitti]].
*Church of St. Catherine of Alexandria (1?th{{when|date=October 2020}}-16th centuries). It is home to a series of frescoes depicting the life of the namesake saint.
*Church of Santa Maria di Gesù (late 15th century). Works inside include a sculpture attributed to Giorgio da Milano and a hig-relief by [[Domenico Gagini]] (c. 1480)

===Aqueduct===

The Roman aqueduct bridge is the largest and best preserved of the island.

The source was located 5&amp;nbsp;km east of the city, at the foot of Monte San Calogero where the remains of the two settling tanks can still be seen in the locality of Brucato.

The aqueduct needed to cross the Barratina stream and the earliest the crossing was made at Fontana Superiore with a siphon about 600 m long, of which the well preserved hexagonal compression tower remains, 16 m high and resting on a square plinth of 6 m sides. On five of the sides were windows and from the east side the conduit started. On this tower was once a large inscription, now disappeared: ''aquae Cornealiae ductus p. XX''. The last letters (&quot;twenty feet&quot;) perhaps corresponds to the sides of the building.

Later it seems that the aqueduct passed further downstream: in Figurella a double-order bridge of arches is still visible (originally nine in the lower, fifteen in the upper: two arches for each order collapsed), 14 m high. The structure with facing blocks is the same as that of the amphitheatre and the curia and shows that it belongs to the same building project of the Augustan colony.

[[Image:Tommaso Buscetta.jpg|thumb|[[Tommaso Buscetta]] (with sunglasses), the first important ''pentito'' of [[Sicilian Mafia]], escorted into a [[court of law]].]]

'''''Pentito''''' ({{IPA-it|penˈtiːto}}; lit. &quot;repentant&quot;; plural: ''pentiti'') is used colloquially to designate people in Italian [[criminal procedure]] terminology who were formerly part of criminal organizations and decided to collaborate with a [[public prosecutor]]. The judicial category of ''pentiti'' was originally created in 1970s to combat violence and [[terrorism]] during [[Years of Lead (Italy)|the period of left- and right-wing terrorism known as the Years of Lead]]. During the 1986–87 [[Maxi Trial]], and after the testimony of [[Tommaso Buscetta]], the term was increasingly applied to former members of [[Organized crime in Italy|organized crime]] who had abandoned their organization and started helping investigators.

== Role and benefits ==
In exchange for the information they deliver, ''pentiti'' receive shorter sentences for their crimes, in some cases even freedom. In the Italian judicial system, ''pentiti'' can obtain personal protection, a new name, and some money to start a new life in another place, possibly abroad.

This practice is common in other countries as well. In the United States, criminals [[Turn state's evidence|testifying against their former associates]] can enter the [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|Witness Protection Program]], and be given new identities with supporting paperwork.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usmarshals.gov/witsec/ U.S. Marshals site], a [[WP:PD|PD]] source&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian Mafia bosses Buscetta and [[Francesco Marino Mannoia]] were allowed to live in the U.S. under new identities in the Witness Protection Program when Italy did not yet have such a program.&lt;ref name=nyt201193&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/20/world/mob-boss-and-stoolie-share-a-day-in-rome-court.html Mob Boss and Stoolie Share a Day in Rome Court], ''The New York Times'', November 20, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stille1&gt;Stille, ''Excellent Cadavers'', p. 302-10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cases==
Among the most famous Mafia ''pentiti'' is [[Tommaso Buscetta]], the first important ''pentito''. He was helpful to judge [[Giovanni Falcone]] in describing the [[Sicilian Mafia Commission]] or ''Cupola'', the [[leadership]] of the Sicilian Mafia in the 1980s, and identifying the main operational channels that the Mafia used for its business.

In Italy, important successes were achieved with the cooperation of ''pentiti'' in the fight against [[terrorism]] (especially against the [[Red Brigades]]), by [[Carabinieri]] general [[Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa]] (who was later killed by the Mafia).

In the period until the 1990s, there were very few, albeit significant, ''pentiti'' such as Tommaso Buscetta, Salvatore Contorno, Antonino Calderone, etc. However, this changed significantly during the early 1990s. From 1992, over a thousand ''mafiosi'' have agreed to collaborate with Italian justice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bull&quot;&gt;Martin J. Bull, James L. Newell, ''Italian Politics'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=l12nA4iQzYcC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=Carmine+Alfieri&amp;ei=aDGoSKymCIGgsgPFmdXiAQ&amp;sig=ACfU3U34tVlFbOcKF5X5dYyuABj9RYx30Q#PPA111,M1, Google Print, p. 111].&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In some cases, ''pentiti'' have invented stories to obtain reductions in jail time. A famous case regarded the popular TV [[anchorman]] [[Enzo Tortora]], who was falsely accused of [[cocaine]] trafficking and [[Camorra]] membership by a ''pentito'' named [[Giovanni Melluso]]. Tortora was detained for years before being cleared; he developed cancer and died soon after the case was finally solved, some say because of the emotional [[stress (medicine)|stress]] of his imprisonment.&lt;ref name=flo301008&gt;[http://www.theflorentine.net/articles/article-view.asp?issuetocId=3705 Enzo Tortora: When justice miscarries] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405003529/http://theflorentine.net/articles/article-view.asp?issuetocId=3705 |date=April 5, 2015 }}, The Florentine, October 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Important ''pentiti'' of the Sicilian Mafia===
:For further information, see [[:Category:Pentiti]]
*[[Leonardo Vitale]] (1941–1984) was the first to become a ''pentito'' in 1973, although originally his confessions were not taken seriously.
*[[Tommaso Buscetta]] (1928–2000) was the first high-profile ''pentito'' against the Sicilian Mafia. He started to collaborate with the anti-Mafia prosecutor [[Giovanni Falcone]] in 1984. His testimony was of crucial importance in the landmark [[Maxi Trial]] of 1986–87.
*[[Salvatore Contorno]] (born 1946) started to collaborate in October 1984, following the example of Buscetta.
* [[Leonardo Messina]] (born 1955), member of the [[San Cataldo, Sicily|San Cataldo]] clan, who became an informant in 1992. He was the greater accuser of [[Giulio Andreotti]].
* [[Antonino Giuffrè]] (born 1945), boss of [[Caccamo]] and member of [[Corleonesi]], turned informant in 2002, after his arrest.
*[[Antonino Calderone]] (1935–2013) started to collaborate in April 1987.
*[[Francesco Marino Mannoia]] (born 1951) started to collaborate in October 1989. He was the first ''pentito'' who used to belong to the winning faction of the [[Second Mafia War]] (1981–83).
*[[Giovanni Brusca]] (born 1957), the murderer of anti-Mafia prosecutor Falcone, began to collaborate in 1996.
* [[Santino Di Matteo]] (born 1954), became an informant in 1993 after his arrest; offered information relating to the [[Capaci bombing]].
*[[Salvatore Cancemi]] (1942–2011), another of Falcone's assassins, turned himself to the [[Carabinieri]] in July 1993 and immediately began collaborating.
*[[Gaspare Mutolo]] (born 1940), started to collaborate in prison in May 1992 and was the first mafioso who spoke about the connections between the [[Cosa Nostra]] and Italian politicians.

[[File:Manang site (54).JPG|thumb|right|250px|The snow-free debris hills around the lagoon are lateral and terminal moraines of a [[valley glacier]] in [[Nepal]].]]

A '''moraine''' is any accumulation of unconsolidated debris ([[regolith]] and [[Rock (geology)|rock]]), sometimes referred to as glacial till, that occurs in both currently and formerly glaciated regions, and that has been previously carried along by a glacier or ice sheet. It may consist of partly rounded particles ranging in size from boulders (in which case it is often referred to as boulder clay) down to gravel and sand, in a groundmass of finely-divided clayey material sometimes called [[glacial flour]]. Lateral moraines are those formed at the side of the ice flow, and [[terminal moraine]]s were formed at the foot, marking the maximum advance of the glacier. Other types of moraine include ground moraines ([[till]]-covered areas forming sheets on flat or irregular [[topography]]) and medial moraines (moraines formed where two glaciers meet).

==Etymology==
The word ''moraine'' is derived from the French root {{lang|fr|moraine}} ({{IPA-fr|mɔ.ʁɛn|}}), which in turn is derived from the Savoyard Italian {{lang|it|morena}}, from Franco-Provençal {{lang|oc|mor, morre}} (&quot;muzzle, snout&quot;), and eventually from Vulgar Latin *{{lang|la|murrum}}.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

== Characteristics ==
Moraines may be composed of debris ranging in size from [[silt]]-sized [[Rock flour|glacial flour]] to large boulders.
The debris is typically sub-angular to rounded in shape. Moraines may be on the glacier's surface or deposited as piles or sheets of debris where the glacier has melted.

=== Formation ===
Moraines may form through a number of processes, depending on the characteristics of sediment, the dynamics on the ice, and the location on the glacier in which the moraine is formed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benn &amp; Evans&quot;&gt;Benn, D. I. and Evans, D. J. A. (1998). Glaciers &amp; Glaciation. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moraine forming processes may be loosely divided into ''passive'' and ''active''.

''Passive'' processes involve the placing of chaotic supraglacial sediments onto the landscape with limited reworking, typically forming [[hummock]]y moraines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kjær|first1=Kurt H.|last2=Krüger|first2=Johannes|date=2001-10-21|title=The final phase of dead-ice moraine development: processes and sediment architecture, Kötlujökull, Iceland|journal=Sedimentology|language=en|volume=48|issue=5|pages=935–952|doi=10.1046/j.1365-3091.2001.00402.x|issn=1365-3091|bibcode=2001Sedim..48..935K}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These moraines are composed of supraglacial sediments from the ice surface.

''Active'' processes form or rework moraine sediment directly by the movement of ice, known as glaciotectonism. These form push moraines and thrust-block moraines, which are often composed of [[till]] and reworked proglacial sediment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bennett|first=Matthew R.|date=2001-04-01|title=The morphology, structural evolution and significance of push moraines|url= |journal=[[Earth-Science Reviews]]|volume=53|issue=3–4|pages=197–236|doi=10.1016/S0012-8252(00)00039-8|bibcode=2001ESRv...53..197B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moraine may also form by the accumulation of sand and gravel deposits from glacial streams emanating from the ice margin. These fan deposits may coalesce to form a long moraine bank marking the ice margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boulton|first=G. S.|date=1986-10-01|title=Push-moraines and glacier-contact fans in marine and terrestrial environments|journal=Sedimentology|language=en|volume=33|issue=5|pages=677–698|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3091.1986.tb01969.x|issn=1365-3091|bibcode=1986Sedim..33..677B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several processes may combine to form and rework a single moraine, and most moraines record a continuum of processes. Reworking of moraines may lead to the formation of [[placer deposit]]s of [[gold]] as is the case of [[Magallanes Region|southernmost Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Potential mineral resources of the Chilean offshore: an overview|journal=[[Andean Geology]]|url=http://www.andeangeology.cl/index.php/revista1/article/view/V47n1-3260/html|last1=García|first1=Marcelo|volume=47|pages=1–13|last2=Correa|first2=Jorge|issue=1|year=2020|last3=Maksaev|first3=Víctor|last4=Townley|first4=Brian|doi=10.5027/andgeoV47n1-3260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of moraines==
{{see also|List of glacial moraines}}
Moraines can be classified either by origin, location with respect to a glacier or former glacier, or by shape. The first approach is suitable for moraines associated with contemporary glaciers—but more difficult to apply to [[old moraine]]s, which are defined by their particular morphology, since their origin is debated. Some moraine types are known only from ancient glaciers, while medial moraines of valley glaciers are poorly preserved and difficult to distinguish after the retreat or melting of the glacier.

===Lateral moraines===
[[File:MorainesLakeLouise.JPG|thumb|Lateral moraines above Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada.]]

Lateral moraines are parallel ridges of debris deposited along the sides of a glacier. The unconsolidated debris can be deposited on top of the glacier by [[frost shattering]] of the valley walls and/or from tributary streams flowing into the valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=May 5, 2011|title=Lateral Moraine|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/moraine/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=June 18, 2020|website=National Geographic Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[till]] is carried along the glacial margin until the glacier melts. Because lateral moraines are deposited on top of the glacier, they do not experience the postglacial erosion of the valley floor and therefore, as the glacier melts, lateral moraines are usually preserved as high ridges.

[[File:Glacier.zermatt.arp.750pix.jpg|left|thumb|Moraines clearly seen on a side glacier of the [[Gorner Glacier]], [[Zermatt]], [[Switzerland]]. The '''lateral moraine''' is the high snow-free bank of debris in the top left hand quarter of the picture. The '''medial moraine''' is the double line of debris running down the centre-line of the glacier.]]

Lateral moraines stand high because they protect the ice under them from the elements, causing it to melt or [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublime]] less than the uncovered parts of the glacier. Multiple lateral moraines may develop as the glacier advances and retreats.

===Ground moraines===
[[File:Ground moraine 9004.jpg|thumb|Ground moraines create irregular, rolling topography.]]
Ground moraines are till-covered areas with irregular topography and no ridges, often forming gently rolling hills or plains. They are accumulated at the base of the ice as [[Till#Types of Till|lodgment till]], but may also be deposited as the glacier retreats.  In [[wikt:alpine|alpine]] glaciers, ground moraines are often found between the two lateral moraines. Ground moraines may be modified into [[drumlins]] by the overriding ice.

====Rogen moraines====
{{main|Rogen moraine}}
Rogen moraines or ribbed moraines are a type of basal moraines that form a series of ribs perpendicular to the ice flow in an [[ice sheet]]. The depressions between the ribs are sometimes filled with water, making the Rogen moraines look like [[tigerstripe]]s on [[aerial photograph]]s. Rogen moraines are named after [[Lake Rogen]]&lt;ref name=Moller&gt;Möller, P., 2006. Rogen moraine: an example of glacial reshaping of preexisting landforms. ''[[Quaternary Science Reviews]]'', '''25''':362–389&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Härjedalen]], [[Sweden]], the landform's type locality.

===End or terminal moraines===
{{main|Terminal moraine}}
[[Image:Erratics-Cascades-PB110028.JPG|thumb|left|Multiple erratics on the terminal moraine of the Okanogan Lobe. Cascade mountains in the background.]]

End moraines, or [[terminal moraine]]s, are ridges of unconsolidated debris deposited at the snout or end of the glacier.  They usually reflect the shape of the [[Glacier terminus|glacier's terminus]].  Glaciers act much like a conveyor belt, carrying debris from the top of the glacier to the bottom where it deposits it in end moraines.  End moraine size and shape are determined by whether the glacier is advancing, receding or at equilibrium. The longer the terminus of the glacier stays in one place, the more debris accumulate in the moraine.  There are two types of end moraines: terminal and recessional.  Terminal moraines mark the maximum advance of the glacier.  Recessional moraines are small ridges left as a glacier pauses during its retreat.  After a glacier retreats, the end moraine may be destroyed by postglacial erosion.

===Recessional moraine===
Recessional moraines are often observed as a series of transverse ridges running across a valley behind a terminal moraine. They form perpendicular to the lateral moraines that they reside between and are composed of unconsolidated debris deposited by the glacier. They are created during temporary halts in a glacier's retreat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benn &amp; Evans&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Moraine&quot;. ''Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia'', 6th Edition (2009): 1. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. 6 Oct. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medial moraine===
[[File:Nuussuaq-peninsula-moraines.jpg|thumb|Medial moraines, [[Nuussuaq Peninsula]], [[Greenland]].]]

A medial moraine is a ridge of moraine that runs down the center of a valley floor. It forms when two glaciers meet and the debris on the edges of the adjacent valley sides join and are carried on top of the enlarged glacier. As the glacier melts or retreats, the debris is deposited and a ridge down the middle of the valley floor is created. The [[Kaskawulsh Glacier]] in the [[Kluane National Park]], [[Yukon]], has a ridge of medial moraine 1&amp;nbsp;km wide.

{{wide image|Bruggen-PioXI FaceCompleteCroppedIMG5642.jpg|600px|align-cap=center|The prominent dark streak at the left quarter is forming a medial moraine.&lt;br&gt;This is seen as a mudflat at the water's surface. ([[Brüggen Glacier]], [[Patagonia]]).}}

===Supraglacial moraines===
Supraglacial moraines are created by debris accumulated on top of glacial ice. This debris can accumulate due to ice flow toward the surface in the [[ablation zone]], melting of surface ice or from debris that falls onto the glacier from valley sidewalls.

===Washboard moraines===
[[Washboard moraine]]s, also known as '''minor''' or '''corrugated moraines''', are low-amplitude geomorphic features caused by glaciers. The name &quot;washboard moraine&quot; refers to the fact that, from the air, it resembles a [[washboard (laundry)|washboard]].

===Veiki moraine===
{{main|Veiki moraine}}
A Veiki moraine is a kind of hummocky moraine that forms irregular landscapes of ponds and plateaus surrounded by banks. It forms from the irregular melting of ice covered with a thick layer of debris. Veiki moraine is common in northern [[Sweden]] and parts of [[Canada]].

==Plot==
[[File:Paris - Café des 2 Moulins - 2004.jpg|thumb|left|Amélie works at the [[Café des 2 Moulins]] in Montmartre.]]
Amélie Poulain is born in June 1974 and brought up by eccentric parents who – incorrectly believing that she has a heart defect – decide to home-school her. To cope with her loneliness, Amélie develops an active imagination and a mischievous personality. When Amélie is six, her mother, Amandine, is killed when a suicidal Canadian tourist jumps from the roof of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] and lands on her. As a result, her father Raphaël withdraws more and more from society. Amélie leaves home at the age of 18 and becomes a waitress at the [[Café des 2 Moulins]] in [[Montmartre]], which is staffed and frequented by a collection of eccentrics. She is single and lets her imagination roam freely, finding contentment in simple pleasures like dipping her hand into grain sacks and cracking [[crème brûlée]] with a spoon.

On 31 August 1997, startled by the news of the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]], Amélie drops a plastic perfume-stopper, which dislodges a wall tile and accidentally reveals an old metal box of childhood memorabilia hidden by a boy who lived in her apartment decades earlier. Amélie resolves to track down the boy and return the box to him. She promises herself that if it makes him happy, she will devote her life to bringing happiness to others.

After asking the apartment's concierge and several old tenants about the boy's identity, Amélie meets her reclusive neighbour, Raymond Dufayel, an artist with [[Osteogenesis imperfecta|brittle bone disease]] who repaints [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]]'''s [[Luncheon of the Boating Party]]'' every year. He recalls the boy's name as &quot;Bretodeau&quot;. Amélie quickly finds the man, Dominique Bretodeau, and surreptitiously gives him the box. Moved to tears by the discovery and the memories it holds, Bretodeau resolves to reconcile with his estranged daughter and the grandson he has never met. Amélie happily embarks on her new mission.

Amélie secretly executes complex schemes that affect the lives of those around her. She escorts a blind man to the Métro station, giving him a rich description of the street scenes he passes. She persuades her father to follow his dream of touring the world by stealing his [[garden gnome]] and having a flight attendant friend [[airmail]] pictures of it [[Travelling gnome prank|posing with landmarks from all over the world]]. She starts a romance between her hypochondriacal co-worker Georgette and Joseph, one of the customers in the bar. She convinces Madeleine Wallace, the concierge of her block of flats, that the husband who abandoned her had sent her a final conciliatory love letter just before his accidental death years before. She [[Gaslighting|gaslights]] Collignon, the nasty greengrocer. Mentally exhausted, Collignon no longer abuses his meek but good-natured assistant Lucien. A delighted Lucien takes charge at the grocery stand.

Mr. Dufayel, having observed Amélie, begins a conversation with her about his painting. Although he has copied the same painting 20 times, he has never quite captured the look of the girl drinking a glass of water. They discuss the meaning of this character, and over several conversations, Amélie begins projecting her loneliness onto the image. Dufayel recognizes this and uses the girl in the painting to push Amélie to examine her attraction to a quirky young man, Nino Quincampoix, who collects the discarded photographs of strangers from passport photo booths. When Amélie bumps into Nino a second time, she realizes she is falling in love with him. He accidentally drops a photo album in the street. Amélie retrieves it.

Amélie plays a cat-and-mouse game with Nino around Paris before returning his treasured album anonymously. After arranging a meeting at the 2 Moulins, Amélie panics and tries to deny her identity. Her co-worker, Gina, concerned for Amélie's well-being, screens Nino for her; Joseph's comment about this misleads Amélie to believe she has lost Nino to Gina. It takes Dufayel's insight to give her the courage to pursue Nino, resulting in a romantic night together and the beginning of a relationship. Amélie finally finds happiness for herself.

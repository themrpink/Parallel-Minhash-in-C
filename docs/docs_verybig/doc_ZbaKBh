General Kusaba's men launched over 9,000 balloons throughout the course of the project. The Japanese expected 10% (around 900) of them to reach America, which is also what is currently believed by researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Mikesh, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; About 300 balloon bombs were found or observed in America. It is likely that more balloon bombs landed in unpopulated areas of the United States.

The last one was launched in April 1945.

The ''fūsen bakudan'' campaign was the most earnest of the attacks. The concept was the brainchild of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]'s Ninth Army's [[Number Nine Research Laboratory]], under Major General [[Sueyoshi Kusaba]], with work performed by Technical Major [[Teiji Takada]] and his colleagues. The balloons were intended to make use of a strong current of winter air that the Japanese had discovered flowing at high altitude and speed over their country, which later became known as the [[jet stream]].&lt;ref name=retaliation&gt;Webber, pp. 99–108&lt;/ref&gt;

The jet stream reported by [[Wasaburo Oishi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; blew at altitudes above {{convert|30000|ft|km|abbr=on}} and could carry a large balloon across the Pacific in three days, over a distance of more than {{convert|5000|mi|km|sp=us|abbr=}}. Such balloons could carry incendiary and high-explosive bombs to the United States and drop them there to kill people, destroy buildings, and start [[forest fire]]s.&lt;ref name=retaliation/&gt;

The preparations were lengthy because the technological problems were acute. A hydrogen balloon expands when warmed by the sunlight, and rises; then it contracts when cooled at night, and descends. The engineers devised a control system driven by an [[altimeter]] to discard [[ballast]]. When the balloon descended below {{convert|30000|ft|km||abbr=on}}, it electrically fired a charge to cut loose sandbags. The sandbags were carried on a cast-aluminium four-spoked wheel and discarded two at a time to keep the wheel balanced.&lt;ref name=retaliation/&gt;

Similarly, when the balloon rose above about {{Convert|38,000|ft|km|abbr=}}, the altimeter activated a valve to vent hydrogen. The hydrogen was also vented if the balloon's pressure reached a critical level.&lt;ref name=retaliation/&gt;

The control system ran the balloon through three days of flight. By that time, it was likely over the U.S., and its ballast was expended. The final flash of gunpowder released the bombs, also carried on the wheel, and lit a {{convert|64|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} long fuse that hung from the balloon's equator. After 84 minutes, the fuse fired a flash bomb that destroyed the balloon.&lt;ref name=retaliation/&gt;

[[File:342-FH-3B23428 (18160060525).jpg|thumb|right|Still from a movie showing ballast release. |alt=Reconstructed balloon ballast control apparatus at the moment an explosive charge is detonated to release sandbags.]]

The balloon had to carry about {{convert|1001|lb|kg|abbr=}} of gear. At first the balloons were made of conventional rubberized [[silk]], but improved envelopes had less leakage. An order went out for ten thousand balloons made of &quot;[[washi]]&quot;, a paper derived from [[mulberry]] bushes that was impermeable and very tough. It was only available in squares about the size of a road map, so it was glued together in three or four laminations using edible ''[[konjac|konnyaku]]'' (devil's tongue) paste – though hungry workers stealing the paste for food created some problems. Many workers were nimble-fingered teenaged school girls.&lt;ref&gt;Webber, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;  They assembled the paper in many parts of Japan. Large indoor spaces, such as [[sumo]] halls, sound stages, and theatres, were required for the envelope assembly.&lt;ref name=retaliation/&gt;

The bombs most commonly carried by the balloons were:&lt;ref&gt;Mikesh, pp. 58–61&lt;/ref&gt;
*Type 92 {{convert|33|lb|kg|adj=on|abbr=}} high-explosive bomb consisting of {{convert|9.5|lb|kg}} [[picric acid]] or [[TNT]] surrounded by 26 steel rings within a steel casing {{convert|4|in|cm}} in diameter and {{convert|14.5|in|cm}} long and welded to a {{convert|11|in|cm|adj=on}} tail fin assembly.
*Type 97 {{convert|26|lb|kg|adj=on|abbr=}} [[thermite]] incendiary bomb using the Type 92 bomb casing and fin assembly containing {{convert|11|oz|g}} of [[gunpowder]] and three {{convert|3.3|lb|kg|adj=on|abbr=}} [[magnesium]] containers of thermite.
*{{convert|11|lb|kg|adj=on|abbr=}} thermite incendiary bomb consisting of a {{convert|3.75|in|cm|adj=on}} steel tube {{convert|15.75|in|cm}} long containing thermite with an ignition charge of magnesium, [[potassium nitrate]] and [[barium peroxide]].

The Japanese Imperial Army's Noborito Institute cultivated [[anthrax]] and ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''; furthermore, it produced enough [[cowpox]] viruses to infect the entire United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.warhistoryonline.com/history/12-warrior-clans-samurai-history-m.html | title=Warrior Clans from the Bloody History of the Japanese Samurai| date=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The deployment of these biological weapon on fire balloons was planned in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Igakusya tachi no sosiki hannzai kannto-gun 731 butai&quot;, Keiichi Tsuneishi&lt;/ref&gt;
The Emperor Hirohito did not permit deployment of biological weapons on the occasion of a report of President Staff Officer Umezu on October 25, 1944. Consequently, biological warfare using Fu-Go balloons was not implemented.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Showa no Shunkan mou hitotsu no seidan&quot;, Kazutoshi Hando, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar, though simpler, balloons were also [[Operation Outward|used by Britain]] to attack Nazi Germany between 1942 and 1944. Extensive use of Operational Analysis in planning these attack made them far more successful.

== Offensive ==
A balloon launch organization of three battalions was formed. The first battalion included headquarters and three squadrons totaling 1,500 men in [[Ibaraki Prefecture]] with nine launch stations at Ōtsu. The second battalion of 700 men in three squadrons operated six launch stations at [[Ichinomiya, Chiba]]; and the third battalion of 600 men in two squadrons operated six launch stations at Nakoso in [[Fukushima Prefecture]]. The Ōtsu site included hydrogen gas generating facilities, but the 2nd and 3rd battalion launch sites used hydrogen manufactured elsewhere. The best time to launch was just after the passing of a high-pressure front, and wind conditions were most suitable for several hours prior to the onshore breezes at sunrise. Suitable launch conditions were expected on only about fifty days through the winter period of maximum jet stream velocity, and the combined launch capacity of all three battalions was about 200 balloons per day.&lt;ref&gt;Mikesh, pp. 16–17, 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Japanese fire balloon shotdown gun.jpg|thumb|Gun cameras show balloons being shot down by American [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning|P-38 Lightning]] fighters in [[Attu Island|Attu]], [[Aleutian Islands]], [[Alaska]] on April 11, 1945]]

Initial tests took place in September 1944 and proved satisfactory; however, before preparations were complete, [[United States Army Air Forces]] [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29 Superfortress]] planes began [[Air raids on Japan|bombing the Japanese home islands]]. The attacks were somewhat ineffectual at first but still fueled the desire for revenge sparked by the [[Doolittle Raid]].

The first balloon was released on November 3, 1944. Major Takada watched as the balloon flew upward and over the sea: &quot;The figure of the balloon was visible only for several minutes following its release until it faded away as a spot in the blue sky like a daytime star.&quot; A few balloons carried [[radiosonde]] equipment rather than bombs. These balloons were tracked by [[direction finding]] stations in Ichinomiya, Chiba, in [[Iwanuma, Miyagi]], in [[Misawa, Aomori]], and on [[Sakhalin]] to estimate progress toward the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Mikesh, pp. 1, 21, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese chose to launch the campaign in November; because the period of maximum jet stream velocity is November through March. This limited the chance of the incendiary bombs causing forest fires, as that time of year produces the maximum North American Pacific coastal precipitation, and forests were generally snow-covered or too damp to catch fire easily. On November 4, 1944, a [[United States Navy]] patrol craft discovered one of the first radiosonde balloons floating off [[San Pedro, Los Angeles]]. National and state agencies were placed on heightened alert status when balloons were found in [[Wyoming]] and [[Montana]] before the end of November.&lt;ref&gt;Mikesh, pp. 7, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Army Air Forces or Navy fighters scrambled to intercept the balloons, but they had little success; the balloons flew very high and surprisingly fast, and fighters destroyed fewer than 20.

American authorities concluded the greatest danger from these balloons would be wildfires in the Pacific coastal forests. The [[Fourth Air Force]], [[Western Defense Command]], and [[Army Service Forces#Service Commands|Ninth Service Command]] organized the ''Firefly Project'' of 2,700 troops, including 200 paratroopers of the [[555th Parachute Infantry Battalion (United States)|555th Parachute Infantry Battalion]] with [[Stinson L-5 Sentinel]] and [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]] aircraft. These men were stationed at critical points for use in fire-fighting missions.&lt;ref&gt;Mikesh, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The 555th suffered one fatality and 22 injuries fighting fires.

Through Firefly, the military used the [[United States Forest Service]] as a proxy agency to combat FuGo. Due to limited wartime fire suppression personnel, Firefly relied upon the 555th as well as [[conscientious objector]]s. The operation also unified fire suppression communications among federal and state agencies. The influx of military personnel, equipment, and tactics shaped how the United States Forest Service approached fire suppression in the post War period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karns|first=Jameson|date=March 2017|title=A Fire Management Assessment of Fugo|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/fire/fmt/|journal=Fire Management Today|volume=57|pages=53–57|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 1945, Americans were becoming aware that something strange was going on. Balloons had been sighted and explosions heard, from California to Alaska. Something that appeared to witnesses to be like a [[parachute]] descended over [[Thermopolis, Wyoming]]. A fragmentation bomb exploded, and shrapnel was found around the crater. A [[P-38 Lightning]] shot a balloon down near [[Santa Rosa, California]]; another was seen over [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]]; and bits of [[washi]] were found in the streets of [[Los Angeles]].

In February and March 1945, [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40]] fighter pilots from [[No. 133 Squadron RCAF|133 Squadron]], [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] [[RCAF Western Air Command|Western Air Command]] operating out of [[Victoria International Airport|RCAF Patricia Bay]] ([[Victoria, British Columbia]]), intercepted and destroyed two fire balloons,&lt;ref name=&quot;Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawks of the RCAF&quot;&gt;[http://www.rcaf.com/Archives/archivesDetail.php?Curtiss-P-40-Kittyhawks-of-the-RCAF-13 rcaf.com, 2010, &quot;Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawks of the RCAF&quot;]. Access date: March 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 21, Pilot Officer E. E. Maxwell While shot down a balloon, which landed on [[Sumas Mountain]], in Washington State. On March 10, Pilot Officer J. Gordon Patten destroyed a balloon near [[Saltspring Island]], British Columbia.

On March 10, 1945, one of the last paper balloons descended in the vicinity of the [[Manhattan Project]]'s production facility at the [[Hanford Site]]. This balloon caused a short circuit in the power lines supplying electricity for the [[nuclear reactor]] cooling pumps, but backup safety devices restored power almost immediately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hanford.gov/doe/history/docs/rl-97-1047/c2_s8.pdf History of the Plutonium Production Facilities at the Hanford Site Historic District, 1943–1990] Retrieved April 27, 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110022016/http://www.hanford.gov/doe/history/docs/rl-97-1047/c2_s8.pdf |date=November 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two paper balloons were recovered in a single day in [[Modoc National Forest]], east of [[Mount Shasta]]. Near [[Medford, Oregon]], a balloon bomb exploded in towering flames. The Navy found balloons in the ocean. Balloons and balloon envelopes and apparatus were found in Montana, Arizona, Texas&lt;ref&gt;Bills, E. R. ''Texas Obscurities: Stories of the Peculiar, Exceptional and Nefarious''. Charleston, SC: The History Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and inside Canada in [[Saskatchewan]], in the [[Northwest Territories]], and in the [[Yukon Territory]]. Eventually, an Army fighter managed to push one of the balloons around in the air and force it to ground intact, where it was examined and filmed.

Japanese propaganda broadcasts announced great fires and an American public in panic, declaring casualties in the thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Allied investigation==
Despite their low success, the authorities were worried about the balloons. There was the chance that they might get unlucky. Much worse, the Americans had some knowledge that the Japanese had been working on [[biological weapon]]s,&lt;ref name=mcphee&gt;John McPhee (1997). ''The Gravel Page''. In ''Irons in the Fire'', Noonday Press: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux. pp. 102–121.{{ISBN?}}&lt;/ref&gt; most specifically at the infamous [[Unit 731]] site at [[Pingfan]] in northeast China, and a balloon carrying biowarfare agents could be a real threat.

Nobody believed the balloons could have come directly from Japan. It was thought that the balloons must be coming from North American beaches, launched by landing parties from [[submarine]]s. Wilder theories speculated that they could have been launched from [[German prisoners of war in the United States|German prisoner of war camps in the U.S.]], or even from [[Japanese American internment|Japanese-American internment centers]].&lt;ref name=mcphee/&gt;

Some of the sandbags dropped by the ''fusen bakudan'' were taken to the [[Military Geology Unit]] of the [[United States Geological Survey]] for investigation. Working with the [[Military Intelligence Service (United States)|Military Intelligence Service]], the researchers of the Military Geological Unit began [[microscope|microscopic]] and chemical examination of the sand from the sandbags to determine types and distribution of [[diatom]]s and other microscopic sea creatures, and its [[mineral]] composition.&lt;ref name=davidrogers&gt;{{cite web

The sand could not be coming from American beaches, nor from the mid-Pacific. It had to be coming from Japan. The geologists ultimately determined that the sand had been taken from the vicinity of Ichinomiya. [[Aerial reconnaissance]] then located two of the [[hydrogen production]] plants nearby, which were soon destroyed by B-29 bombing raids in April 1945.&lt;ref name=davidrogers/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcphee/&gt;

=== Press reporting ===
The bombs caused little damage, but their potential for destruction and fires was large. The bombs also had a potential psychological effect on the American people. The U.S. strategy was to keep the Japanese from knowing of the balloon bombs' effectiveness.

An [[Associated Press]] story dated December 18, 1944, stated that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and the military were investigating a {{Convert|33.5|foot|m|abbr=}} paper balloon with incendiary attachments found by a wood chopper and his father in a mountainous forested region 17 miles southwest of [[Kalispell, Montana]], on December 11, with a very detailed description of the curious find.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Mysterious Balloon Found In Montana Mountain Area – Huge Paper Bag Bearing Jap Characters, Incendiary Device Studied By Military | newspaper = The San Bernardino Daily Sun | location = San Bernardino, CA| date =  19 December 1944 | volume = 51 | page = 1 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/32124988/fugo_balloon_montana/ | accessdate = 31 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945 ''[[Newsweek]]'' ran an article titled &quot;Balloon Mystery&quot; in their January 1 issue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Larry|last=Tanglen| title=Terror: Floated over Montana: Japanese World War II Balloon Bombs, 1944–1945| journal=Montana: The Magazine of Western History|volume=52 |issue=4 |year=2002| page=77|jstor=4520467}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a similar story appeared in a newspaper the next day.

The [[Office of Censorship]] then sent a message to newspapers and radio stations to ask them to make no mention of balloons and balloon-bomb incidents. They did not want the enemy to get the idea that the balloons might be effective weapons or to have the American people start panicking. Cooperating with the desires of the government, the press did not publish any balloon bomb incidents.&lt;ref name=war&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first= Jeffery Alan|title=War &amp; Press Freedom: The Problem of Prerogative Power  |publisher= Language Arts &amp; Disciplines|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps as a result, the Japanese only learned of one bomb's reaching [[Wyoming]], landing and failing to explode.

The press blackout in the U.S. was lifted after the first deaths to ensure that the public was warned, as public knowledge of the threat could have possibly prevented it.&lt;ref name=war/&gt;

==Abandonment==
With no evidence of any effect, General Kusaba was ordered to cease operations in April 1945, believing that the mission had been a total fiasco. The expense was large, and in the meantime the B-29s had destroyed two of the three hydrogen plants needed by the project.

The last fire balloon was launched in April 1945.

On May 5, 1945, a pregnant woman and five children were killed when they discovered a balloon bomb that had landed in the forest of [[Gearhart Mountain Wilderness|Gearhart Mountain]] in [[Southern Oregon]]. [[Archie E. Mitchell|Archie Mitchell]] was the pastor of the Bly [[Christian and Missionary Alliance|Christian and Missionary Alliance Church]]. He and his pregnant wife Elsie drove up to Gearhart Mountain with five of their Sunday school students (aged 11–14) to have a picnic. They had to stop at this spot near [[Bly, Oregon]], due to construction and a road closing. Elsie and the children got out of the car at Bly, while Archie drove on to find a parking spot. As Elsie and the children looked for a good picnic spot, they saw a strange balloon lying on the ground.  There were two explosions; the boys were killed immediately, and Elsie died as Archie used his hands to extinguish the fire on her clothing.  Joan Patzke survived the initial blast, but died later. A bomb disposal expert guessed that the bomb had been kicked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were the only people whose deaths were attributed to the balloon bombs deployed on American soil.

Military personnel arrived on the scene within hours, and saw that the balloon still had snow underneath it, while the surrounding area did not. They concluded that the balloon bomb had drifted to the ground several weeks earlier, and had lain there undisturbed until found by the group.

Elsie Mitchell is buried in the Ocean View Cemetery in [[Port Angeles, Washington]]. A memorial, the Mitchell Monument, is located at the point of the explosion, {{convert|69|mi|km|abbr=off|sp=us}} northeast of [[Klamath Falls, Oregon|Klamath Falls]] in the [[Mitchell Recreation Area]]. It was listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2001. Several Japanese civilians have visited the monument to offer their apologies for the deaths that took place here, and several cherry trees have been planted around the monument as a symbol of peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;onpaperwingsthemovie.com&quot;/&gt;

==Post-World War II==
The remains of balloons continued to be discovered after the war. Eight were found in the 1940s, three in the 1950s, and two in the 1960s. In 1978, a ballast ring, fuses, and barometers were found near [[Agness, Oregon]], and are now part of the collection of the [[Coos County, Oregon|Coos]] Historical &amp; Maritime Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The remains of a balloon bomb were found near McBride, British Columbia in October 2019.  It was found by a hunter looking for mountain goats in the east central BC wilderness. There was evidence of a small fire nearby suggesting that the bomb may have started the fire.

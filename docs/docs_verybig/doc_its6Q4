The town [[Samois-sur-Seine]] is mentioned in ''Story of O'' as  the location of the fictional mansion managed by Anne-Marie, a [[lesbian]] [[dominatrix]]. In 1978, the name [[Samois]] was adopted by a [[lesbian]]-[[feminist]] [[BDSM]] organization based in [[San Francisco]] that existed from 1978 to 1983. It was the first lesbian BDSM group in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeffreys|first=Sheila|author-link=Sheila Jeffreys|title=The Lesbian Heresy|year=1993|publisher=Spinifex|location=North Melbourne, Vic., Australia|isbn=978-1-875559-17-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0FFWxDu9gn0C&amp;q=samois+%22first+lesbian+s%2Fm%22&amp;pg=PA130|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2007, the [[National Leather Association International]] inaugurated awards for excellence in SM/fetish/leather writing. The categories include the Pauline Reage (a pen name of [[Anne Desclos]], author of ''Story of O'') award for fiction novel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bedell&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nla2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=NLA-I Accepting Nominations for Writing Awards|url=http://www.chicagoden.net/2012/12/13/nla-i-accepting-nominations-for-writing-awards/|publisher=Chicago Den - The Midwest's Fetish Newspaper|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2020, [[Anne Desclos]] (author of ''Story of O'') was inducted into the Leather Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://leatherhalloffame.com/index.php/inductees.html |title=&gt; Inductees |publisher=Leatherhalloffame.com |date= |accessdate=2020-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ring of O]] is a specially designed [[Ring (finger)|ring]] which has been worn as a distinctive mark among [[BDSM]] practitioners, mainly in [[continental Europe]] — and especially the [[German language|German-speaking]] countries — since the 1990s{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}. Its use is relatively widespread within this subculture {{citation needed|date=August 2020}}. Its name derives from the name of the central female character in ''Story of O'', who was a [[sexual slavery (BDSM)|sex slave]] and wore an analogous ring. The ring mentioned in the original novel was quite different from what is most commonly known as the &quot;Ring of O&quot; today. The novel describes the ring as shaped similarly to a [[Seal (device)|signet ring]] (with a seal disk on top which was relatively large for a woman's ring), made out of dull-gray polished iron, lined with gold on the inside, and with a golden [[Triskelion]] on its top area. The ring's symbolic meaning in the novel also differs quite a bit from the one commonly used among BDSM practitioners today{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}. In the book, such a ring is worn by a female &quot;slave&quot; after she has finished her training at Roissy. Those wearing the ring are obliged to be obedient to any man who belongs to the secret society of Roissy (whose emblem is the triskelion), and must allow him to do absolutely everything with them that he pleases. This stands in strong contrast to the ring's meaning today. People indicate by wearing such rings that they are interested in BDSM, and sometimes by the hand they wear it on whether they are a [[Top (BDSM)|Top]] or a [[Bottom (BDSM)|Bottom]]; usually left for Bottom, right for Top{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}.

== Adaptations ==
=== Film ===
{{Ref improve section|date=August 2020}}
American experimental director [[Kenneth Anger]] made a 20&amp;nbsp;minute short film version, ''l'Histoire d'O'', in 1961.

French director [[Henri-Georges Clouzot]] wanted to adapt the novel to film for many years, which was eventually done by director [[Just Jaeckin]] in 1975 as ''[[Story of O (film)|Histoire d'O]]'' (''Story of O'') produced by [[Eric Rochat]] and Gérard Lorin, starring [[Corinne Cléry]] and [[Udo Kier]]. The film met with far less acclaim than the book. It was banned in the United Kingdom by the [[British Board of Film Censors]] until February 2000.

In 1975, American director [[Gerard Damiano]], well known for ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Devil in Miss Jones]]'' (1973), created the movie ''[[The Story of Joanna]]'', highly influenced by the ''Story of O'', by combining [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]] from one of the book's chapters and from [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s ''[[No Exit]]''.

In 1979, Danish director [[Lars von Trier]] made the short movie entitled ''[[Menthe – la bienheureuse]]'', as an [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to ''The Story of O''. His 2005 film ''[[Manderlay]]'' was also inspired by the book, particularly Paulhan's introduction.&lt;ref&gt;

Five years later, in 1984, actress [[Sandra Wey]] starred as &quot;O&quot; in ''[[The Story of O: Part 2]]'', written, directed and produced by Eric Rochat.

In 1992, a [[Brazil]]ian [[miniseries]] in 10 episodes entitled ''A História de O'' starring [[Claudia Cepeda]] was written, directed and produced by Eric Rochat, who was the producer of the original 1975 movie.

In 2002, another version of ''O'' was released, called ''The Story of O: Untold Pleasures'', with [[Danielle Ciardi]] playing the title character.

===Comics===
In 1975, it was adapted for comics by the Italian artist [[Guido Crepax]]. Both the original and Crepax's adaptation were parodied for comics in 2007 by [[Charles Alverson]] and John Linton Roberson.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Documentaries ===
''Writer of O'', a 2004 documentary film by [[Pola Rapaport]], mixed interviews with re-enactments of certain scenes from the book. In the documentary, the real author of ''Story of O'', Dominique Aury (actually a [[pen name]] of [[Anne Desclos]]), talks about the book ''A Girl in Love''. This book was written about how ''Story of O'' was written.

A documentary was also made for [[BBC Radio 4]] entitled ''The Story of O: The Vice Francaise'', presented by [[Rowan Pelling]], former editor of the ''[[Erotic Review]]'', which looked at the history of the book and its author [[Anne Desclos]].

''[[Erotica: A Journey Into Female Sexuality]]'', a documentary by filmmaker [[Maya Gallus]], featured the final interview with 90-year-old Dominique Aury (a pen name of ''Story of O'' author [[Anne Desclos]]) before she died. In the film, she recounts the extraordinary love story behind ''Story of O'' and marvels that she has reached such a grand age.

      <text bytes="11033" xml:space="preserve">'''Gábor Szegő''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈɡaːbor ˈsɛɡøː|lang}}) (January 20, 1895 &amp;ndash; August 7, 1985) was a Hungarian-American mathematician. He was one of the foremost [[Mathematical analysis|mathematical analysts]] of his generation and made fundamental contributions to the theory of [[orthogonal polynomials]] and [[Toeplitz matrix|Toeplitz matrices]] building on the work of his contemporary [[Otto Toeplitz]].

==Life==
Szegő was born in [[Kunhegyes]], [[Austria-Hungary]] (today [[Hungary]]), into a [[Jew]]ish family as the son of Adolf Szegő and Hermina Neuman.&lt;ref name=&quot;kunhegy&quot;&gt;[http://www.kunhegyes.hu/kunhegyes/hires/szego.htm Biography on the homepage of Kunhegyes] (in Hungarian)&lt;/ref&gt; He married the chemist Anna Elisabeth Neményi in 1919, with whom he had two children.

In 1912 he started studies in [[mathematical physics]] at the [[University of Budapest]], with summer visits to the [[University of Berlin]] and the [[University of Göttingen]], where he attended lectures by [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius|Frobenius]] and [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], amongst others. In Budapest he was taught mainly by [[Lipót Fejér|Fejér]], [[:hu:Beke Manó|Beke]], [[József Kürschák|Kürschák]] and Bauer&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renyi.hu/~dezso/panorama/kantor.pdf Biographies - Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics (bios of Bauer Mihály and Beke Manó)]&lt;/ref&gt; and made the acquaintance of his future collaborators [[George Pólya]] and [[Michael Fekete]]. His studies were interrupted in 1915 by [[World War I]], in which he served in the infantry, artillery and air corps.
In 1918 while stationed in Vienna, he was awarded a [[doctorate]] by the [[University of Vienna]] for his work on [[Toeplitz matrix|Toeplitz determinants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy |id=8363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://histsoc.stanford.edu/pdfmem/SzegoG.pdf Official memorial citation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325231306/http://histsoc.stanford.edu/pdfmem/SzegoG.pdf |date=2009-03-25 }}, [[Stanford University]].&lt;/ref&gt; He received his [[Privat-Dozent]] from the University of Berlin in 1921, where he stayed until being appointed as successor to [[Konrad Knopp|Knopp]] at the [[University of Königsberg]] in 1926.  Intolerable working conditions during the [[Nazi regime]] resulted in a temporary position at the [[Washington University in Saint Louis]], [[Missouri]] in 1936, before his appointment as chairman of the mathematics department at [[Stanford University]] in 1938, where he helped build up the department until his retirement in 1966.  He died in [[Palo Alto, California]]. His doctoral students include [[Paul C. Rosenbloom|Paul Rosenbloom]] and [[Joseph L. Ullman|Joseph Ullman]].

==Works==
Szegő's most important work was in [[analysis (mathematics)|analysis]]. He was one of the foremost analysts of his generation and made fundamental contributions to the theory of [[Toeplitz matrix|Toeplitz matrices]] and [[orthogonal polynomials]]. He wrote over 130 papers in several languages. Each of his four books, several written in collaboration with others, has become a classic in its field. The monograph ''[[Orthogonal polynomials]]'', published in 1939, contains much of his research and has had a profound influence in many areas of [[applied mathematics]], including [[theoretical physics]], [[stochastic process]]es and [[numerical analysis]].

==Tutoring von Neumann==
At the age of 15, the young [[John von Neumann]], recognised as a mathematical prodigy, was sent to study advanced calculus under Szegő. On their first meeting, Szegő was so astounded by von Neumann's mathematical talent and speed that he was brought to tears.&lt;ref&gt;Impagliazzo, John; [[James Glimm|Glimm, James]]; [[Isadore Singer|Singer, Isadore Manuel]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=XBK-r0gS0YMC&amp;pg=PA15 ''The Legacy of John von Neumann''], American Mathematical Society, 1990, {{ISBN|0-8218-4219-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Szegő subsequently visited the von Neumann house twice a week to tutor the child prodigy. Some of von Neumann's instant solutions to the problems in calculus posed by Szegő, sketched out on his father's stationery, are now on display at the von Neumann archive at Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;''John Von Neumann: The Scientific Genius Who Pioneered the Modern Computer'', by Norman Macrae, American Mathematical Soc., 2000, page 70&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pope Nicholas IV''' ({{lang-la|Nicolaus IV}}; 30 September 1227 – 4 April 1292), born '''Girolamo Masci''', was head of the [[Catholic Church]] and ruler of the [[Papal States]] from 22 February 1288 to his death. He was the first Franciscan to be elected pope.&lt;ref name=McBrien&gt;McBrien, Richard P., ''Live of the Popes'', p.226, Harper Collins, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Jerome Masci (Girolamo Masci) was born on 30 September 1227 at Lisciano, near [[Ascoli Piceno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hourihane|first1=Colum|title=The Grove Encyclopedia of Medieval Art and Architecture, Volume 2|date=2012|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=978-0195395365|page=441|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FtlMAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Pope+Nicholas+IV+lisciano}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kelly|first1=J N D|last2=Walsh|first2=Michael|title=A Dictionary of Popes|date=2010|publisher=OUP Oxford|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0199295814|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a pious, peace-loving man whose goals as a Franciscan friar were to protect the Church, promote the [[crusades]], and root out [[heresy]]. According to [[Heinrich of Rebdorf]], he was a Doctor of Theology.&lt;ref&gt;Marquardi Freheri, ''Rerum Germanicarum Scriptores'' editio tertia (curante Burcardo Gotthelffio Struvio) Tomus Primus (Argentorati: sumptibus Ioannis Reinholdi Dulsseckerii 1717), p. 605.&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Franciscan]] [[friar]], he had been elected the Order's superior (minister) for Dalmatia during the [[Franciscan]] general chapter held at Pisa in 1272.   [[Pope Gregory X]] (1271-1276), was sending a [[papal legate|legate]] to the Greek Emperor, [[Michael VIII Palaiologos|Michael Palaiologos]], in 1272, to invite the participation of Greek prelates in the Second Council of Lyons. The Pope's ambition was to achieve a reunion of Eastern and Western Christendom.  St [[Bonaventure]], then [[Minister General]] of the Order of Friars Minor ([[Franciscan]]s), was asked to select four Franciscans to accompany the Legation as Nuncios. He chose Friar Jerome Masci as one of the four.&lt;ref&gt;Luca Wadding, ''Annales Minorum'' IV  second edition (edited by J. M. Fonseca) (Rome 1732), p. 345. Their instructions, drawn up by Pope Gregory, are printed at pp. 353-355.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Bonaventure]] died suddenly during the fifth session of the Order's General Chapter at Lyons on 15 July 1274, Friar Jerome Masci was elected to succeed him as the [[Franciscan]] [[Minister General]], even though he was absent at the time, only then returning with the Greek delegates from the embassy to Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;Luke Wadding, ''Annales Minorum'' IV  second edition (edited by J.M. Fonseca) (Rome 1732), p. 399 and 411.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerome was the associate of [[John of Vercelli]], [[Master of the Order of Preachers|Master General]] of the [[Dominican Order]], when the latter was sent by [[Pope Nicholas III]] (Giovanni Caetani Orsini) on 15 October 1277, to arrange a peace between [[Philip IV of France]] and [[Alfonso III of Aragon]].  Jerome and [[John of Vercelli]] were again appointed to the same task on 4 April 1278.&lt;ref&gt;August Potthast, ''Regesta Pontificum Romanorum'' II (Berlin 1875), nos. 21165, 21294-21295; 21310; and see A. Theiner, ''Caesaris S.R.E. Card. Baronii Annales Ecclesiastici'' 22 (Bar-le-Duc 1870), under the year 1277, no. 47, p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, Jerome was ordered to continue for the time being as the [[Franciscan]] [[Minister General]].&lt;ref&gt;Potthast, no.  21356.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1278 Jerome was made [[Cardinal Priest]] by Pope Nicholas III, and at some point after 16 May 1279 was assigned the titular church of [[Santa Pudenziana]]. Even after his appointment as a cardinal, he was allowed to remain as [[Minister General]] of the [[Franciscan]]s until the next general chapter. In the event, however, he was unable to attend the chapter for reasons of ill health, as a letter of apology of Pope Nicholas III, written in May 1279, indicates.&lt;ref&gt;Potthast, no.  21582.&lt;/ref&gt;  On 12 April 1281 he was promoted [[Cardinal Bishop]] of [[Palestrina]] by [[Pope Martin IV]].&lt;ref name=Weber&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11057a.htm Weber, Nicholas. &quot;Pope Nicholas IV.&quot; The Catholic Encyclopedia.

===Papal conclave===
{{Main|Papal election, 1287-1288}}
After the death of [[Pope Honorius IV]] on 3 April 1287, the Conclave was held in Rome, at the papal palace next to Santa Sabina on the Aventine Hill, where Pope Honorius had died.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/SV1287.html Sede Vacante and Conclave of 1287-1288 (Dr. J. P. Adams).]&lt;/ref&gt; This was in accordance with the Constitution &quot;[[Ubi Periculum]]&quot; of Pope Gregory X. At the beginning, in April, there were thirteen cardinals in Rome; three Cardinals—Gerardo Bianchi, Giovanni Boccamati, and Jean Cholet—did not attend at all. The Sacred College was for a time hopelessly divided in its selection of a successor. When six of the electors died during the year 1287 (Ancher Pantaleon, Geoffrey de Bar, Hugh of Evesham, Giordano Orsini, Comes de Casanate, and Goffredo of Alatri—some, at least, carried off by fever), the others, with the sole exception of Jerome Masci, left the Conclave and returned to their homes. It was not until the following year that they reassembled. The electors at that time were seven in number: Jerome Masci, along with Latino Malabranca, Bentivenga de Bentivengis, Bernard de Languissel, Matteo Rosso Orsini, Giacomo Colonna, and Benedetto Caetani. On 15 February 1288, the survivors unanimously elected Jerome Masci, to the papacy on the first scrutiny. It is said that the Cardinals were impressed by his steadfastness in remaining at the papal palace, but there is no real documentation as to their motives. As he admitted in his electoral manifesto, Cardinal Masci was extremely reluctant to accept,&lt;ref&gt;''Judicia Dei abyssus''  in  A. Theiner, ''Caesaris S.R.E. Card. Baronii Annales Ecclesiastici'' 23 (Bar-le-Duc 1871), under the year 1288, § 5; p. 25; V. Langlois, ''Registres de Nicolas IV'' I, pp. 1-3 no. 1 (February 23, 1288).&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed he persisted in his refusal for an entire week. Finally, on 22 February, he gave in and agreed.&lt;ref&gt;This is the story told by [[Heinrich of Rebdorf]], in  Marquardi Freheri, ''Rerum Germanicarum Scriptores'' editio tertia (curante Burcardo Gotthelffio Struvio) Tomus Primus (Argentorati: sumptibus Ioannis Reinholdi Dulsseckerii 1717), p. 605.&lt;/ref&gt; He became the first [[Franciscan]] pope and chose the name Nicholas IV in remembrance of Nicholas III, who had made him a Cardinal.&lt;ref name=Weber/&gt;

===New Cardinals===

Given the considerable losses to the numbers of the Sacred College in 1286 and 1287, it is not surprising that Nicholas IV quickly proceeded to fill vacancies. What is surprising is that he did not even reach the number of cardinals who were alive under Honorius IV, let alone exceed it.  On 16 May 1288, he named six new cardinals: Bernardus Calliensis, Bishop of Osimo (who died in 1291), Hugues Aiscelin (Seguin) de Billon, OP, of the diocese of Clermont in the Auvergne;&lt;ref&gt;Hugues Aiscelin was Master of the Sacred Palaces, appointed either by Martin IV or Honorius IV:  J. Catalano, ''De magistro sacri palatii apostolici'' (Rome 1751), pp. 62-63.&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew of Aquasparta in Tuscany, Minister General of the Franciscans since 1287; Pietro Peregrosso of Milan, the Vice-Chancellor of the Holy Roman Church; Napoleone Orsini; and Pietro Colonna.&lt;ref&gt;Conradus Eubel, ''Hierarchia catholica medii aevi'' I, editio altera (Monasterii 1913), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholas IV issued an important constitution on 18 July 1289, which granted to the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]s one-half of all income accruing to the [[Holy See]] and a share in the financial management, thereby paving the way for that independence of the [[College of Cardinals]] which, in the following century, was to be of detriment to the papacy.

In regard to the question of the Sicilian succession, as feudal suzerain of the kingdom, Nicholas annulled the treaty, concluded in 1288 through the mediation of [[Edward I of England]], which confirmed [[James II of Aragon]] in the possession of the island of [[Sicily]].  This treaty had not properly seen to papal interests. In May 1289 he crowned [[Charles II of Naples|King Charles II of Naples and Sicily]] after the latter had expressly recognized papal [[suzerainty]], and in February 1291 concluded a treaty with Kings [[Alfonso III of Aragon]] and [[Philip IV of France]] looking toward the expulsion of James from Sicily.&lt;ref name=Weber/&gt;

In 1288 Nicholas met with the Nestorian Christian [[Rabban Bar Sauma]] from China.

In August 1290 he granted the status of ''[[studium generale]]'' to the [[University of Coimbra|university]] that King [[Denis of Portugal]] has just founded a few months earlier in the city of [[Lisbon]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Papacy and the Rise of the Universities'', Gaines Post, ''Education and Society in the Middle Ages and Renaissance'', Vol. 54, ed. William J. Courtney, Jurgen Miethke, Frank Rexroth and Jacques Verger, (Brill, 2017), 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss of [[Akko|Acre]] in 1291 stirred Nicholas IV to renewed enthusiasm for a [[crusade]].  He sent missionaries, among them the Franciscan [[John of Monte Corvino]],&lt;ref name=McBrien/&gt; to labour among the [[Bulgaria]]ns, [[Ethiopia]]ns, [[Mongols]], [[Tatars]] and [[China|Chinese]].

==Death==
Nicholas IV died in Rome on 4 April 1292, in the palace which he had built next to the Liberian Basilica (S. Maria Maggiore). He was buried in the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]].&lt;ref&gt;A.

His sepulchral inscription is recorded by Vincenzo Forcella, ''Inscrizioni delle chiese di Roma'' XI (Roma 1877), p. 11, no. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; His epitaph reads: &quot;Here lies Nicolas IV son of St. Francis&quot; (''Hic requiescit / Nicolaus PP Quartus / Filius Beati Francisci'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Il Calice di Guccio di Mannaia|last=Marioli|first=Luigi|publisher=Edizioni Musei Vaticani|year=2014|isbn=9788882713300|editor-last=Callori di Vignale|editor-first=Flavia|location=|pages=10|language=Italian|chapter=Premessa|quote=|editor-last2=Santamaria|editor-first2=Ulderico|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Taxatio''{{anchor | ''Taxatio''}}==
The 1291–92 ''[[Taxatio]]'' he initiated, which was a detailed valuation for [[ecclesiastical]] taxation of English and Welsh parish churches and [[Prebendary|prebends]], remains an important source document for the medieval period.

Since Dyson's success in raising public awareness of cyclonic separation, several other companies have introduced cyclone models. Competing manufacturers include Hoover, Bissell, Shark, Eureka, Electrolux, Filter Queen, etc., and the cheapest models are no more expensive than a conventional cleaner.

===Central===
{{main|Central vacuum cleaner}}
[[File:Central vacuum system.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The power unit of a typical [[central vacuum cleaner]] for residential use]]
Central vacuum cleaners, also known as built-in or ducted, are a type of canister/cylinder model which has the motor and dirt filtration unit located in a central location in a building, and connected by pipes to fixed vacuum inlets installed throughout the building. Only the hose and cleaning head need be carried from room to room, and the hose is commonly 8&amp;nbsp;m (25&amp;nbsp;ft) long, allowing a large range of movement without changing vacuum inlets. Plastic or metal piping connects the inlets to the central unit. The vacuum head may be unpowered, or have beaters operated by an electric motor or by an air-driven [[turbine]].

The dirt bag or collection bin in a central vacuum system is usually so large that emptying or changing needs to be done less often, perhaps a few times per year for an ordinary household. The central unit usually stays in stand-by, and is turned on by a switch on the handle of the hose. Alternately, the unit powers up when the hose is plugged into the wall inlet, when the metal hose connector makes contact with two prongs in the wall inlet and control current is transmitted through low voltage wires to the main unit.

A central vacuum typically produces greater suction than common portable vacuum cleaners because a larger fan and more powerful motor can be used when they are not required to be portable. A [[Cyclonic separator|cyclonic separation system]], if used, does not lose suction as the collection container fills up, until the container is nearly full. This is in marked contrast to filter-bag designs, which start losing suction immediately as pores in the filter become clogged by accumulated dirt and dust.

A benefit to allergy sufferers is that unlike a standard vacuum cleaner, which must blow some of the dirt collected back into the room being cleaned (no matter how efficient its filtration), a central vacuum removes all the dirt collected to the central unit. Since this central unit is usually located outside the living area, no dust is recirculated back into the room being cleaned. Also it is possible on most newer models to vent the exhaust entirely outside, even with the unit inside the living quarters.

Another benefit of the central vacuum is, because of the remote location of the motor unit, there is much less noise in the room being cleaned than with a standard vacuum cleaner.

====Constellation====
[[File:Hoover 1960 Vacuum cleaner img 1403.jpg|thumb|Hoover Constellation of 1960]]
[[The Hoover Company]] marketed an unusual vacuum cleaner, called the ''Constellation'', in the 1960s. The cylinder type lacked wheels, and instead the vacuum cleaner floated on its exhaust, operating as a [[hovercraft]], although this is not true of the earliest models. They had a rotating hose with the intention being that the user would place the unit in the center of the room, and work around the cleaner. Introduced in 1954, they are collectible, and are easily identified by their spherical shape. But they remain an interesting machine; restored, they work well in homes with many hardwood floors.

The Constellations were changed and updated over the years until discontinued in 1975. These Constellations route all of the exhaust under the vacuum using a different airfoil. The updated design is quiet even by modern standards, particularly on carpet as it muffles the sound. These models float on carpet or bare floor—although on hard flooring, the exhaust air tends to scatter any fluff or debris around.

Hoover re-released an updated version of this later model Constellation in the US (model # S3341 in Pearl White and # S3345 in stainless steel). Changes include a [[HEPA]] filtration bag, a 12-amp motor, a turbine-powered brush roll, and a redesigned version of the handle. This same model was marketed in the UK under the Maytag brand as the ''Satellite'' because of licensing restrictions. It was sold from 2006 to 2009.

===Vehicles===
See [[vacuum truck]] for very big vacuum cleaners mounted on vehicles.

===Other===
Some other vacuum cleaners include an electric [[mop]] in the same machine: for a dry and a later wet clean.

The [[iRobot]] company developed the [[Scooba (brand)|Scooba]], a robotic wet vacuum cleaner that carries its own cleaning solution, applies it and scrubs the floor, and vacuums the dirty water into a collection tank.

==Technology==
A vacuum's suction is caused by a difference in air pressure. A fan driven by an electric motor (often a [[universal motor]]) reduces the pressure inside the machine. Atmospheric pressure then pushes the air through the carpet and into the nozzle, and so the dust is literally pushed into the bag.

Tests have shown that vacuuming can kill 100% of young [[flea]]s and 96% of adult fleas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/12/071217111010.htm |title=Cat Fleas' Journey into The Vacuum Is A 'One-way Trip' |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=22 December 2007 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exhaust filtration===
[[File:Vacuum cleaner bag.jpg|thumb|upright|A full dustbag. The frame around the opening fastens to the interior end of the cleaner's hose inlet.]]
Vacuums by their nature cause dust to become airborne, by exhausting air that is not completely filtered. This can cause health problems since the operator ends up inhaling [[Particulates#Health effects|respirable dust]], which is also redeposited into the area being cleaned. There are several methods manufacturers use to control this problem, some of which may be combined together in a single appliance. Typically a filter is positioned so that the incoming air passes through it before it reaches the fan, and then the filtered air passes through the motor for cooling purposes. Some other designs use a completely separate air intake for cooling.

It is nearly impossible for a practical air filter to completely remove all ultrafine particles from a dirt-laden airstream. An ultra-efficient air filter will immediately clog up and become ineffective during everyday use, and practical filters are a compromise between filtering effectiveness and [[air resistance|restriction of airflow]]. One way to sidestep this problem is to exhaust partially filtered air to the outdoors, which is a design feature of some [[central vacuum system]]s. Specially engineered portable vacuums may also utilize this design, but are more awkward to set up and use, requiring temporary installation of a separate exhaust hose to an exterior window.

* Bag: The most common method to capture the debris vacuumed up involves a paper or fabric bag that allows air to pass through, but attempts to trap most of the dust and debris.  The bad may become clogged with fine dust before it is full.  The bag may be disposable, or designed to be cleaned and re-used.
* Bagless: In non-cyclonic bagless models, the role of the bag is taken by a removable container and a reusable filter, equivalent to a reusable fabric bag.
* [[Cyclonic separation]]: A vacuum cleaner employing this method is also bagless. It causes intake air to be cycled or spun so fast that most of the dust is forced out of the air and falls into a collection bin. The operation is similar to that of a [[centrifuge]].  Centrifugal separaters eliminate the problem of a bag becoming clogged with fine dust.
* Water filtration: First seen commercially in the 1920s in the form of the Newcombe Separator (later to become the [[Rexair]] Rainbow), a water filtration vacuum cleaner uses a water bath as a filter. It forces the dirt-laden intake air to pass through water before it is exhausted, so that wet dust cannot become airborne. The water trap filtration and low speed may also allow the user to use the machine as a stand-alone [[air purifier]] and [[humidifier]] unit. The dirty water must be dumped out and the appliance must be cleaned after each use, to avoid growth of [[bacteria]] and [[Mold (fungus)|mold]], causing unpleasant odors.
* [[Air filter|Ultra fine air filter]]: Also called [[HEPA#Vacuum cleaners|HEPA]] filtered, this method is used as a secondary filter after the air has passed through the rest of the machine. It is meant to remove any remaining dust that could harm the operator. Some vacuum cleaners also use an [[activated charcoal]] filter to remove odors.

Ordinary vacuum cleaners should never be used to clean up [[asbestos]] fibers, even if fitted with a HEPA filter. Specially-designed machines are required to safely clean up asbestos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/guidance/em4.pdf |title=Asbestos essentials em4 Using a Class H vacuum cleaner for asbestos |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attachments===
Most vacuum cleaners are supplied with numerous specialized attachments, such as tools, brushes and extension wands, which allow them to reach otherwise inaccessible places or to be used for cleaning a variety of surfaces. The most common of these tools are:

* Hard floor brush (for non-upright designs)
* Powered floor nozzle (for canister designs)
* Dusting brush
* Crevice tool
* Upholstery nozzle

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Specifications===
The performance of a vacuum cleaner can be measured by several parameters:

* Airflow, in [[litre]]s per [[second]] [l/s] or [[cubic foot|cubic feet]] per minute (CFM or ft³/min)
* Air speed, in metres per second [m/s] or miles per hour [mph]
* Suction, vacuum, or water lift, in [[pascal (unit)|pascals]] [Pa] or inches of water

Other specifications of a vacuum cleaner are:
* Weight, in kilograms [kg] or pounds [lb]
* Noise, in [[decibel]]s &amp;#91;[[Decibel#Acoustics 2|dB]]&amp;#93;&lt;!-- misnomer dBA !? --&gt;
* Power cord length and hose length (as applicable)

==== Suction ====
The suction is the maximum pressure difference that the pump can create. For example, a typical domestic model has a suction of about negative 20 kPa.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} This means that it can lower the pressure inside the hose from normal atmospheric pressure (about 100 kPa) by 20 kPa. The higher the suction rating, the more powerful the cleaner. One inch of water is equivalent to about 249 Pa; hence, the typical suction is {{convert|80|in|mm}} of water.

====Input power====
The power consumption of a vacuum cleaner, in [[watt]]s, is often the only figure stated.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} Many North American vacuum manufacturers give the current only in [[ampere]]s (e.g. &quot;6 amps&quot;),{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} and the consumer is left to [[Volt-ampere|multiply that by the line voltage of 120 volts]] to get the approximate power ratings in watts. The rated input power does not indicate the effectiveness of the cleaner, only how much electricity it consumes.

After August 2014, due to EU rules, manufacture of vacuum cleaners with a power consumption greater than 1600 watts were banned within the EU, and from 2017 no vacuum cleaner with a wattage greater than 900 watts was permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ten days left to vacuum up a powerful cleaner |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-28878432 |accessdate=8 September 2020 |work=BBC News |date=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Harrabin |first1=Roger |title=Sales of inefficient vacuum cleaners banned |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41119355 |accessdate=8 September 2020 |work=BBC News |date=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Output power====
{{Main|Airwatt}}

The amount of input power that is converted into airflow at the end of the cleaning hose is sometimes stated, and is measured in ''airwatts'': the measurement units are simply watts. The word &quot;air&quot; is used to clarify that this is output power, not input electrical power.

The airwatt is derived from [[English unit]]s. [[ASTM International]] defines the airwatt as 0.117354 × F × S, where F is the rate of air flow in ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/min and S is the [[pressure]] in [[inches of water]]. This makes one airwatt equal to 0.9983 watts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/dictA.html|title= Units: A|accessdate=27 March 2008 |author= Rowlett, Russ |date= 21 March 2001|work= How Many?

'''William James Dixon''' (July 1, 1915{{snd}}January 29, 1992) was an American [[blues]] musician, vocalist, songwriter, arranger and record producer.&lt;ref name=&quot;amg&quot; /&gt; He was proficient in playing both the [[upright bass]] and the guitar, and sang with a distinctive voice, but he is perhaps best known as one of the most prolific songwriters of his time. Next to [[Muddy Waters]], Dixon is recognized as the most influential person in shaping the post–[[World War II]] sound of the [[Chicago blues]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Trager2004&quot;&gt;Trager, Oliver (2004). ''Keys to the Rain: The Definitive Bob Dylan Encyclopedia''. Billboard Books. pp. 298–299. {{ISBN|0-8230-7974-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dixon's songs have been recorded by countless musicians in many genres as well as by various ensembles in which he participated. A short list of his most famous compositions includes &quot;[[Hoochie Coochie Man]]&quot;, &quot;[[I Just Want to Make Love to You]]&quot;, &quot;[[Little Red Rooster]]&quot;, &quot;[[My Babe]]&quot;, &quot;[[Spoonful]]&quot;, and &quot;[[You Can't Judge a Book by the Cover]]&quot;. These songs were written during the peak years of [[Chess Records]], from 1950 to 1965, and were performed by [[Muddy Waters]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Little Walter]], and [[Bo Diddley]]; they influenced a generation of musicians worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Dicaire, David (1999). ''Blues Singers: Biographies of 50 Legendary Artists of the Early 20th Century''. McFarland. p. 87. {{ISBN|0-7864-0606-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dixon was an important link between the blues and [[rock and roll]], working with [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Bo Diddley]] in the late 1950s. In the 1960s, his songs were adapted by numerous rock artists. He received a [[Grammy Award]] and was inducted into the [[Blues Hall of Fame]], the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], and the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]].

==Biography==
[[File:Willie Dixon.jpg|thumb|Dixon at Monterey Jazz Festival, 1981]]

===Early life===
Dixon was born in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], on July 1, 1915.&lt;ref name=&quot;amg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Eder |first=Bruce |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/willie-dixon-mn0000959770 |title=Willie Dixon: Biography, Credits, Discography |publisher=AllMusic.com |access-date=March 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was one of fourteen children.{{sfn|Palmer|1982|p=166}} His mother, Daisy, often rhymed things she said, a habit her son imitated. At the age of seven, young Dixon became an admirer of a band that featured pianist [[Little Brother Montgomery]]. He sang his first song at Springfield Baptist Church at the age of four&lt;ref name=&quot;Willie Dixon pp. 207&quot;&gt;Long, Worth (1995). &quot;The Wisdom of the Blues—Defining Blues as the True Facts of Life: An
Interview with Willie Dixon.&quot; ''African American Review'' 29.2. pp. 207–212. JSTOR. Web. October 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Dixon was first introduced to [[blues]] when he served time on prison farms in Mississippi as a young teenager. Later in his teens, he learned how to sing harmony from a local carpenter, Theo Phelps, who led a [[gospel music|gospel]] quintet, the Union Jubilee Singers, in which Dixon sang bass; the group regularly performed on the Vicksburg radio station WQBC.{{sfn|Dixon|Snowden|1990|pp=25, 34}} He began adapting his poems into songs and even sold some to local music groups.

===Adulthood===
Dixon left Mississippi for Chicago in 1936.{{sfn|Palmer|1982|p=166}} A man of considerable stature, standing 6 feet 6 inches tall and weighing over 250 pounds, he took up boxing, at which he was successful, winning the Illinois State [[Golden Gloves]] [[Championship (professional wrestling)|Heavyweight Championship]] (Novice Division) in 1937.{{sfn|Snowden|1997|loc=Box set booklet}} He became a professional boxer and worked briefly as [[Joe Louis]]'s sparring partner, but after four fights he left boxing in a dispute with his manager over money.

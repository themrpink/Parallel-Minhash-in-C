This is the first of the [[Five Discourses of Matthew]], the other four being [[Matthew 10]], [[Matthew 13]] (1–53), [[Matthew 18]] and the [[Olivet discourse]] in Matthew 24.&lt;ref name= Kellum194 &gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by Andreas J. Köstenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4365-3}} pp.&amp;nbsp;94–96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel of Matthew'' by Craig S. Keener 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8028-6498-7}} pp.&amp;nbsp;37–38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Preaching Matthew's Gospel'' by Richard A. Jensen 1998 {{ISBN|978-0-7880-1221-1}} pp.&amp;nbsp;25,&amp;nbsp;158.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sermon is set early in the [[Ministry of Jesus]] after he has been [[Baptism of Jesus|baptized]] by [[John the Baptist]] in [[Matthew 3|chapter 3]] of Matthew's Gospel, gathered his first disciples in [[Matthew 4|chapter 4]], and had returned from a long fast and contemplation in the [[Judaean Desert]] where he had been [[Temptation of Jesus|tempted by Satan]] to renounce his spiritual mission and gain worldly riches.

Before this episode, Jesus had been &quot;all about [[Galilee]]&quot; preaching, as in [[Matthew 4:23]], and &quot;great crowds followed him&quot; from all around the area. The setting for the sermon is given in [[Matthew 5:1]]-[[Matthew 5:2|2]]. Jesus sees the multitudes, goes up into the mountain, is followed by his disciples, and begins to preach. The Sermon is brought to its close by {{bibleverse||Matthew|8:1|NKJV}}, which reports that Jesus &quot;came down from the mountain followed by great multitudes&quot;.

While the issue of the exact theological structure and composition of the Sermon on the Mount is subject to debate among scholars, specific components within it, each associated with particular teachings, can be identified.&lt;ref name=Talbert21 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WCarter &gt;''What are they saying about Matthew's Sermon on the mount?'', Warren Carter 1994 {{ISBN|0-8091-3473-X}} pp.&amp;nbsp;35–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Meister des Lehrbuchs Kaiser Maximilians I. 001.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Lord's Prayer]], in [[Matthew 6:9]], 1500, Vienna]]
{{bibleref2|Matthew|5:3-12|9|Matthew 5:3–12}} discusses the [[Beatitudes]]. These describe the character of the people of the Kingdom of Heaven, expressed as &quot;blessings&quot;.&lt;ref name= &quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; The Greek word most versions of the Gospel render as &quot;blessed,&quot; can also be translated &quot;happy&quot; ({{bibleref2 |Matthew|5:3-12|YLT|Matthew 5:3–12}} of [[Young's Literal Translation]] for an example). In Matthew, there are eight (or nine) blessings, while in Luke there are four, followed by four woes.&lt;ref name= &quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;&quot;Beatitudes.&quot; Frank Leslie Cross, Elizabeth A. Livingstone, eds. [https://books.google.com/books?id=fUqcAQAAQBAJ The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church]. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19280290-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In almost all cases the phrases used in the Beatitudes are familiar from an [[Old Testament]] context, but in the sermon Jesus gives them new meaning.&lt;ref name=Haste /&gt; Together, the Beatitudes present a new set of ideals that focus on love and humility rather than force and mastery; they echo the highest ideals of Jesus' teachings on spirituality and compassion.&lt;ref name=Haste&gt;''A Dictionary of The Bible'', James Hastings 2004 {{ISBN|1-4102-1730-2}} pages 15–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christian teachings, the [[Works of Mercy]], which have corporal and spiritual components, have resonated with the theme of the Beatitude for mercy.&lt;ref name= Peace&gt;'' Jesus the Peacemaker'', Carol Frances Jegen 1986 {{ISBN |0-934134-36-7}} pages 68–71.&lt;/ref&gt; These teachings emphasize that these acts of mercy provide both temporal and spiritual benefits.&lt;ref name= Synop &gt;''The Synoptics: Matthew, Mark, Luke'', Ján Majerník, Joseph Ponessa, Laurie Watson Manhardt 2005 {{ISBN|1-931018-31-6}}, pages 63–68&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bibleref2 |Matthew|5:13-16|9|Matthew 5:13–16}} presents the metaphors of [[salt and light]]. This completes the profile of God's people presented in the beatitudes and acts as the introduction to the next section.

There are two parts in this section, using the terms &quot;salt of the earth&quot; and [[Light of the World]] to refer to the disciples{{snd}} implying their value. Elsewhere, in {{bibleref |John|8:12|9}}, Jesus applies ''Light of the World'' to himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Charles |last= Spear |title= Names and Titles of the Lord Jesus Christ |year=2003 |isbn= 0-7661-7467-0 |page= 226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus preaches about [[hell]] and what hell is like: &quot;But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother &quot;''[[Language of Jesus#Raca .28.CE.A1.CE.B1.CE.BA.CE.B1.29|Raca]]'' (fool)&quot; shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.&quot; (Matthew 5:22 KJV&lt;ref&gt;Bible Gateway [http://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=hell+fire&amp;qs_version=KJV Quick search: hell fire]&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[File:Papyrus 1 - recto.jpg|thumb|upright|A page from [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], from [[Papyrus 1]], c. 250 AD]]
The longest discourse in the Sermon is {{bibleref2|Matthew|5:17-48|9|Matthew 5:17–48}}, traditionally referred to as ''the [[Matthew 5#Antitheses|Antitheses]]'' or ''Matthew's Antitheses''. In the discourse, Jesus fulfills and reinterprets the [[Old Covenant]] and in particular its [[Ten Commandments#Christianity|Ten Commandments]], contrasting with what &quot;you have heard&quot; from others. For example, he advises [[turning the other cheek]], and [[Matthew 5:44|to love your enemies]], in contrast to taking [[an eye for an eye]]. According to most interpretations of [[Matthew 5:17]], [[Matthew 5:18 |18]], [[Matthew 5:19|19]], and [[Matthew 5:20|20]], and most [[Christian views on the old covenant|Christian views of the Old Covenant]], these new interpretations of the [[Torah|Law]] and [[Neviim |Prophets]] are not [[antinomianism|opposed to the Old Testament]], which was the position of [[Marcion]], but form Jesus' new teachings which bring about [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]], and hence must be adhered to, as emphasized in {{bibleref2|Matthew|7:24-27|9|Matthew 7:24–27}} towards the end of the sermon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Gospel of Matthew |first=R. T. |last=France |year= 2007 |isbn= 978-0-80282501-8 |pages= 1118–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Matthew 6]] Jesus condemns doing what would normally be &quot;[[good works]]&quot; simply for recognition and not from the heart, such as those of [[alms]] (6:1–4), [[prayer]] (6:5–15), and [[fasting]] (6:16–18). The discourse goes on to condemn the superficiality of [[economic materialism|materialism]] and calls the disciples not to worry about material needs, but to &quot;seek&quot; [[Kingdom of God|God's kingdom]] first. Within the discourse on ostentation, Matthew presents an example of correct prayer. Luke places this in a different context. The [[Lord's prayer]] (6:9–13) contains parallels to {{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|29:10–18}}.&lt;ref&gt;Clontz, T.E. &amp; J., ''The Comprehensive New Testament with complete textual variant mapping and references for the Dead Sea Scrolls, Philo, Josephus, Nag Hammadi Library, Pseudepigrapha, Apocrypha, Plato, Egyptian Book of the Dead, Talmud, Old Testament, Patristic Writings, Dhammapada, Tacitus, Epic of Gilgamesh'', Cornerstone, 2008, p. 451, {{ISBN |978-0-9778737-1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson (2004), p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first part of [[Matthew 7]], i.e. {{bibleref2 |Matthew|7:1-6|9|Matthew 7:1–6}} deals with judging. Jesus condemns those who judge others before first judging themselves: &quot;Judge not, that ye be not judged.&quot;

In the last part in {{bibleref2|Matthew|7:17-29|9|Matthew 7:17–29}} Jesus concludes the sermon by warning against [[false prophet]]s.

==Teachings and theology==
[[File:Saint Cajetan Church, Gustavo A. Madero, Federal District, Mexico11.jpg|thumb|upright|Plaque of the 8 ''[[Beatitudes]]'', St. Cajetan Church, [[Lindavista]], Mexico]]

The teachings of the Sermon on the Mount have been a key element of [[Christian ethics]], and for centuries the sermon has acted as a fundamental recipe for the conduct of the followers of Jesus.&lt;ref name=v &gt;'' The sources of Christian ethics'' by Servais Pinckaers 1995 {{ISBN|0-8132-0818-1}} page 134&lt;/ref&gt; Various religious and moral thinkers (e.g. [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]]) have admired its message, and it has been one of the main sources of [[Christian pacifism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Tolstoy, see ''My Religion'', 1885. cf. [[s:My Religion|My Religion]] on Wikisource.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 5th century, [[Saint Augustine]] began his book ''[[Our Lord's Sermon on the Mount (Augustine)|Our Lord's Sermon on the Mount]]'' by stating:
: If anyone will piously and soberly consider the sermon which our Lord Jesus Christ spoke on the mount, as we read it in the Gospel according to Matthew, I think that he will find in it, so far as regards the highest morals, a perfect standard of the Christian life.

The last verse of chapter 5 of Matthew ({{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|5:48|9}}) is a focal point of the sermon that summarizes its teachings by advising the disciples to seek perfection.&quot;&lt;ref name=Vaught7 &gt;{{cite book |last=Vaught |first=Carl G. |authorlink= |title=The Sermon on the Mount: A Theological Interpretation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XB3nwV7JxqkC&amp;q=father+is+perfect&amp;pg=PA10 |accessdate= |year=1986 |publisher=SUNY Press |location= |isbn=9781438422800 |pages=7–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek word ''telios'' used to refer to perfection also implies an end, or destination, advising the disciples to seek the path towards perfection and the [[Kingdom of God]].&lt;ref name=Vaught7 /&gt; It teaches that God's children are those who act like God.&lt;ref name=Talbert78 &gt;{{cite book |last=Talbert |first=Charles H. |authorlink= |chapter=Matthew |title=Paideia: Commentaries on the New Testament |chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tbmoR2j0-sgC&amp;q=act+like+God&amp;pg=PA78 |access-date= |year=2010 |publisher=Baker Academic |location= |isbn=9780801031922 |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teachings of the sermon are often referred to as the ''Ethics of the Kingdom'': they place a high level of emphasis on &quot;purity of the heart&quot; and embody the basic standard of Christian [[righteousness]].&lt;ref&gt;''Christian ethics, issues and insights'' by Eṃ Stephan 2007 {{ISBN|81-8069-363-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theological structure===
The issue of the theological structure and composition of the Sermon on the Mount remains unresolved.&lt;ref name=Talbert21 &gt;''Reading the Sermon on the mount:'' by Charles H. Talbert 2004 {{ISBN|1-57003-553-9}} pp.&amp;nbsp;21–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WCarter /&gt;&lt;ref name=DAllison &gt;{{cite journal |title=The Structure of the Sermon on the Mount |first1=Dale C. |last1=Allison |journal=Journal of Biblical Literature |volume=106 |issue=3 |date=September 1987 |pages=423–45 |doi=10.2307/3261066 |jstor=3261066 |url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/jbl/1987_allison.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; One group of theologians ranging from [[Saint Augustine]] in the 5th century to [[Michael Goulder]] in the 20th century, see the [[Beatitudes]] as the central element of the Sermon.&lt;ref name=Talbert21 /&gt; Others such as [[Günther Bornkamm|Bornkamm]] see the Sermon arranged around the [[Lord's prayer]], while [[Daniel Patte]], closely followed by [[Ulrich Luz]], see a [[chiastic structure]] in the sermon.&lt;ref name=Talbert21 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WCarter /&gt; [[Dale Allison]] and [[Glen Stassen]] have proposed a structure based on triads.&lt;ref name=&quot;WCarter&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DAllison&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stassen, Glen H. &quot;The Fourteen Triads of the Sermon on the Mount.&quot; ''Journal of Biblical Literature'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Kingsbury]] and [[Hans Dieter Betz]] see the sermon as composed of theological themes, e.g. righteousness or way of life.&lt;ref name=Talbert21 /&gt;

===Interpretations===
{{cleanup| section|reason=Does not explain what these interpretations mean in terms of the sermon|date=April 2020}}
The high ethical standards of the Sermon have been interpreted in a wide variety of ways by different Christian groups and [[Craig S. Keener]] states that at least 36 different interpretations regarding the message of the Sermon exist, which he divides into 8 categories of views:&lt;ref name= Keener160 &gt;{{cite book |title=The Gospel of Matthew |first=Craig S. |last=Keener |year= 2009 |isbn= 978-0-8028-6498-7 |pages= 160–2 |chapter=The sermon's message |chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8C2Y_HaL5W0C&amp;pg=PA160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Theology of Martin Luther|Luther's view]] that it represents an impossible demand like the [[Law of Moses]]

# The [[Social Gospel#A Theology for the Social Gospel (1917)|Social Gospel view]]
# The [[Christian existentialism]] view
# [[The Quest of the Historical Jesus|Schweitzer's view of an imminent eschatology]] referring to an interim ethic
# [[Dispensationalism#Eschatology |Dispensational eschatology]] which refers to the future Kingdom of God
# [[Inaugurated eschatology]] in which the Sermon's ethics remain a goal to be approached, yet realized later

===Comparison with the Sermon on the Plain===
While Matthew groups Jesus' teachings into sets of similar material, the same material is scattered when found in Luke.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;/&gt; The Sermon on the Mount may be compared with the similar but more succinct [[Sermon on the Plain]] as recounted by the [[Gospel of Luke]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Luke|6:17-49|KJV}}), which occurs at the same moment in Luke's narrative, and also features Jesus heading up a mountain, but giving the sermon on the way down at a level spot. Some scholars believe that they are the same sermon, while others hold that Jesus frequently preached similar themes in different places.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrman 2004, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern parallels with Buddhist teachings===
Although modern parallels between the teachings of Jesus and [[Buddhist]] philosophy have been drawn (by the [[14th Dalai Lama]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AC2sl9YTfUEC&amp;q=%22Buddhism+and+Christianity%22+parallel&amp;pg=PA58 |title=The Good Heart: A Buddhist Perspective on the Teachings of Jesus |author=Dalai Lama |authorlink=14th Dalai Lama|editor=Robert Kiely |editor2=Thupten Jinpa |publisher=Wisdom Publications Inc |year=1998 |isbn=978-0861711383 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example), these comparisons emerged after missionary contacts in the 19th century, and there is no historically reliable evidence of contacts between Buddhism and Jesus during his life.&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus: The Complete Guide'' 2006 by [[Leslie Houlden]] {{ISBN|082648011X}} page 140&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholarship has almost unanimously agreed that claims of the travels of Jesus to Tibet, Kashmir or India (see [[Unknown years of Jesus]]) and the [[Buddhist influences on Christianity|influence of Buddhism on his teachings]] are without historical basis.&lt;ref&gt;Van Voorst, Robert E (2000). Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence. Eerdmans Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}} page 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Historical Jesus in Recent Research'' edited by James D. G. Dunn and Scot McKnight 2006 {{ISBN|1-57506-100-7}} page 303&lt;/ref&gt;
The similarities between the teachings of Buddha and Jesus have been noted.&lt;ref&gt;Borg, Marcus, ed. ''Jesus and Buddha: The Parallel Sayings''. Jack Kornfield, intro. Ulysses Press. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===According to the Perennial Philosophy===
According to [[Perennial philosophy|perennialist]] author [[Frithjof Schuon]], the message of the Sermon is a perfect synthesis of the whole Christian tradition. The text has the largest number of perennial and universal doctrines and spiritual advice of all Scripture. Much of what Bible readers remember from Scripture derives from the Sermon. Source of spiritual and moral instructions, the Sermon on the Mount is regarded by the Perennial Philosophy &quot;as the quintessence itself of religion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mateus Soares de Azevedo, &quot;Esoterism and exoterism in the Sermon of the Mount&quot;. In: Sophia journal (vol. 15, Number 1, Summer 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Perennialism considers the injunctions of the Sermon on the Mount as belonging to the [[esoteric Christianity|esoteric]] dimension of Christianity.

'''Triton''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|aɪ|t|ə|n}}; {{lang-grc-gre|[[wikt:Τρίτων#Ancient Greek|Τρίτων]]}} ''Tritōn'') is a [[Greek mythology|Greek god]] of the sea, the son of [[Poseidon]] and [[Amphitrite]], god and goddess of the sea respectively. Triton lived with his parents, in a golden palace on the bottom of the sea. Later he was often depicted as having a [[conch shell]] he would blow like a trumpet.

Triton is usually represented as a [[merman]], with the upper body of a human and the tailed lower body of a fish. At some time during the Greek and Roman era, Triton(s) became a generic term for a merman (mermen) in art and literature. In [[English literature]], Triton is portrayed as the messenger or [[herald]] for the god Poseidon.

Triton of [[Lake Tritonis]] of [[Ancient Libya]] is a namesake mythical figure that appeared and aided the [[Argonauts]].

Triton dwelt with his parents in underwater golden palaces.&lt;ref name=&quot;theogony-tr-most&quot; /&gt; It has been pointed out Poseidon's golden palace was located at [[Aegae (Euboea)|Aegae]] on [[Euboea]] in one passage of Homer's ''Iliad'' 12.21.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Iliad|{{URL|1=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Il.+13.21&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134|2=13.21}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;theogony-ed-west&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dgrg&quot; /&gt;{{Refn|group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;|Homer ''Iliad'' {{URL|1=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Il.++8.203&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134|2=8.203}} also mentions &quot;Aegaea&quot; but this refers to [[Aegae (Achaea)]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dgrg&quot; /&gt;}}&lt;!--[[Aegae (Euboea)]] (q.v.) is also mentioned in Odyssey, Book 5. --&gt;

Unlike his father Poseidon who is always fully anthropomorphic in ancient art (this has only changed in modern popular culture), Triton's lower half is that of a fish, while the top half is presented in a human figure.

Triton in later times became associated with  possessing a [[conch]] shell,&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford-classical-dict&quot; /&gt; which he blew like a trumpet to calm or raise the waves.{{Refn|Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' 1.333 ''apud'' [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology|DGRBM]]&lt;ref name=&quot;dgrbm-triton1&quot; /&gt;}} He was &quot;trumpeter and bugler&quot; to [[Oceanus]] and [[Poseidon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;natale-conti&quot; /&gt; Its sound was so cacophonous that when loudly blown, it put the giants to flight, who imagined it to be the roar of a dark wild beast.{{Refn|[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Pseudo-Hyginus]], ''[[Poeticon Astronomicon|Poetical astronomy]]'' ii. 23 ''apud'' [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology|DGRBM]]&lt;ref name=&quot;dgrbm-triton1&quot; /&gt;}}

&lt;!--Like his father, Poseidon, he carried a trident.--&gt;The original Greek Triton only sometimes bore a trident.&lt;ref name=&quot;ashton&quot; /&gt; In literature, Triton carries a trident in [[Lucius Accius|Accius]]'s ''Medea'' fragment.&lt;ref name=&quot;fitch&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;slaney&quot; /&gt;{{Refn|group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;|A triton (see [[#Tritons|§Tritons]] below) and [[merman]] are synonymous in heraldry,&lt;ref name=&quot;moule&quot; /&gt; and the figure may often carry a trident.&lt;ref name=&quot;eve&quot; /&gt;}}

Triton is &quot;sea-hued&quot; according to [[Ovid]] and &quot;his shoulders barnacled with sea-shells&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ovid-met-deucalion-tr-melville&quot; /&gt; Ovid actually here calls Triton &quot;[[cerulean]]&quot; in color, to choose a [[cognate]] rendering to the original language ({{lang-la|caeruleus}});&lt;ref name=&quot;ovid-met-deucalion-tr-lombardo&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, {{url|http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi006.perseus-lat1:1.253-1.347|''Metamorphoses'' 1.332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ovid also includes Triton among other deities ([[Proteus]], [[Aegaeon (mythology)|Aegaeon]], [[Doris (mythology)|Doris]]) of being this blue color, with green (''{{linktext|viridis}}'') hair,&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, {{url|http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi006.perseus-lat1:2.1-2.102|''Metamorphoses'' 2.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ovid-met-phaeton-tr-martin&quot; /&gt; as well describing the steed Triton rides as cerulean.{{Refn|Ovid, ''Heroides'' 7.49–50: &quot;caeruleis Triton per mare curret equis&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;natale-conti&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kleywegt&quot; /&gt;}}

== Libyan lake god ==

There is also Triton, the god of [[Lake Tritonis]] of [[Ancient Libya]] encountered by the [[Argonauts]]. This Triton is treated as a separate deity in some references.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DGRBM|author=|title=Triton (2)|volume=|page=|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104%3Aentry%3Dtriton-bio-2|short=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford-classical-dict&quot; /&gt;&lt;!-- &quot;a triton&quot;--&gt; He had a different parentage, as his father was Poseidon but his mother [[Europa (consort of Zeus)|Europa]] according to the Greek writers of this episode.{{Refn|[[Pindar]], ''Pythian'' 4. 45, Apollonius ''[[Argonautica]]'' I.179181). {{harvp|Jackson|1987||pp=27, 28}}&lt;ref name=&quot;jackson&quot; /&gt;}}

This Triton first appeared in the guise of [[Eurypylus of Cyrene|Eurypylus]] before eventually revealing his divine nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;pindarus&amp;apollonius&quot;&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Pythian'' 4; [[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'', iv. 1552ff; .&lt;/ref&gt; This local deity has thus been [[euhemerism|euhemeristically]] rationalized  as &quot;then ruler over Libya&quot; by [[Diodorus Siculus]].&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus iv.56.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Triton-Eurypylus welcomed the Argonauts with a guest-gift of a clod of earth which was a pledge that the Greeks would be granted the land of [[Cyrene, Libya]] in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford-classical-dict&quot; /&gt; The ''[[Argo]]'' had been driven ashore in the Syrtes ([[Gulf of Gabès|Gulf of Syrtes Minor]] according to some), and Triton guided them through the lake's marshy outlet back to the [[Mediterranean]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pindarus&amp;apollonius&quot; /&gt;{{sfnp|Jackson|1987|p=23}}

One of the works which recounts this adventure is [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]' ''[[Argonautica]]'' (3rd century BC), the first work in written literature that describes a Triton as &quot;fish-tailed&quot;.{{sfnp|Lattimore|1976|p=56}}

== Triton with men and heroes ==

In [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', book 6, it is told that Triton killed [[Misenus]], son of [[Aeolus]], by drowning him after he challenged the gods to play as well as he did.&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''Aeneid'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Verg.+A.+6.164 6.164 ff.].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford-classical-dict&quot; /&gt;

[[Herakles]] wrestling Triton is a common theme in [[Classical Greek art]] particularly [[black-figure pottery]],{{sfnp|Mommsen|2014|pp=55}} but no literature survives that tells the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norris |first=Michael Byron |author-link=&lt;!--Michael Byron Norris--&gt; |title=Greek Art: From Prehistoric to Classical : a Resource for Educators |publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] |year=2000 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7UnxdSXZkuoC&amp;pg=PA172 |page=172 |isbn=0-870-99972-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fewer examples, the [[Greek pottery]] depicting apparently the same [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] are labeled &quot;[[Nereus]]&quot; or &quot;[[Old Man of the Sea]]&quot; instead, and among these, Nereus' struggle with Herakles is attested in literature ([[Pseudo-Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;pedley&quot; /&gt; &quot;Old Man of the Sea&quot; is a generic term applicable to Nereus, who was also frequently depicted as half-fishlike.&lt;ref name=&quot;pedley&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pulliam&quot; /&gt; One explanation is that some vase painters developed the convention of depicting Nereus as a fully human form, so that Triton had to be substituted in the depiction of the sea-monster wrestling Herakles. And Nereus appears as a spectator in some examples of this motif.&lt;ref name=&quot;padgett&quot; /&gt;

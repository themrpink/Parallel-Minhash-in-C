'''Amen'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Hebrew Name|אָמֵן|amen|ʾāmēn}}; {{lang-gr|ἀμήν|amín}}; {{lang-ar|آمینَ|&amp;#702;āmīna}}; Aramaic/[[Syriac language|Syriac]]: ܐܵܡܝܼܢ, romanized: ''ʾāmīn''&lt;/ref&gt; is a declaration of affirmation&lt;ref name=&quot;ety&quot;/&gt; first found in the [[Hebrew Bible]], and subsequently in the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ce&quot;&gt;{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia |wstitle=Amen |volume=1 |first=Herbert |last=Thurston}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in Jewish, Christian and Islamic [[worship]], as a concluding word, or as a response to a [[prayer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ety&quot;/&gt; Common [[English language|English]] translations of the word ''amen'' include &quot;verily&quot;, &quot;truly&quot;, and &quot;so be it&quot;. It is also used colloquially, to express strong agreement.&lt;ref name=&quot;ety&quot;&gt;{{OEtymD|amen|accessdate=2007-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pronunciations==
{{anchor|Pronunciation}}
In English, the word ''amen'' has two primary pronunciations, {{respell|ah|MEN}} ({{IPA|/ɑːˈmɛn/}}) or  {{respell|ay|MEN}} ({{IPA|/eɪˈmɛn/}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/amen|title=amen - definition of amen in English by Oxford Dictionaries|work=oxforddictionaries.com|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with minor additional variation in emphasis (e.g., the two syllables may be equally stressed instead of placing primary stress on the second). With [[Anglophone]] North American usage the ''ah-men'' pronunciation is used in performances of [[European classical music|classical music]] and in churches with more formalized [[ritual]]s and [[liturgy]]. 

The ''ay-men'' pronunciation is a product of the [[Great Vowel Shift]] (i.e., it dates from the 15th century); it is associated with [[Protestantism in Ireland|Irish Protestantism]] and with conservative [[evangelical]] denominations generally.
It also is the  pronunciation typically used in [[gospel music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://bustedhalo.com/podcasts/two-ways-pronouncing-amen | title=Two Ways of Pronouncing 'Amen'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims pronounce “ah-meen” when concluding recitation of [[Al-Fatiha]], the first surah, in [[Salat|prayer]].

== Etymology ==
[[File:Amen in East Syriac Aramaic language.svg|thumb|150px|&quot;Amen&quot; in contemporary (''Madnhāyā'') [[Syriac script]].]]
The usage of ''amen'', meaning &quot;so be it&quot; (as found in the early scriptures of the [[Bible]]), is a word of [[Biblical Hebrew]] origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;GBH&quot;&gt;Paul Joüon, SJ, ''A Grammar of Biblical Hebrew'', trans. and revised by T. Muraoka, vol. I, Rome: Editrice Pontificio Instituto Biblico, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The word originated in the Hebrew Scriptures, as a confirmatory response; it is found in [[Deuteronomy]] as a confirmatory response made by the people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Understanding Your Neighbor's Faith 2004, page 43&quot;&gt;''Understanding Your Neighbor's Faith'', Philip Lazowski, (KTAV), 2004, page 43&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in the [[Books of Chronicles]] (16:36), it is indicated that around 1000 BC, the word was used in its religious sense, with the people responding &quot;Amen&quot; upon hearing the blessing, &quot;Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from now and unto all eternity&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Understanding Your Neighbor's Faith 2004, page 43&quot;/&gt; The basic [[triconsonantal root]] from which the word is derived, is common to a number of languages  in the [[Semitic languages|Semitic branch]] of the [[Afroasiatic languages]], including [[Aramaic language|biblical Aramaic]]. The word was imported into the Greek from the Judaism of the [[early Church]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ce&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;JE&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1383&amp;letter=A&amp;search=Amen|encyclopedia=Jewish Encyclopedia|title=Amen|accessdate=2008-02-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080216101007/http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1383&amp;letter=A&amp;search=Amen| archivedate= 16 February 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Greek, ''amen'' entered the other Western languages. According to a standard dictionary etymology, ''amen'' passed from Greek into [[Late Latin]], and thence into English.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHD&quot;&gt;{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/75/A0247500.html |dictionary=American Heritage Dictionary |title=Amen |accessdate=2008-02-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421120804/http://www.bartleby.com/61/75/A0247500.html |archivedate=21 April 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbinic scholars from medieval France believed the standard Hebrew word for faith ''emuna'' comes from the root ''amen.'' Although in English transliteration they look different, they are both from the root [[aleph]]-mem-nun. That is, the Hebrew word ''amen'' derives from the same ancient [[triliteral]] Hebrew root as does the verb ''ʾāmán''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacrednamebible.com/kjvstrongs/STRHEB5.htm#S543 |title=King James Bible Strong's Hebrew Dictionary |accessdate=2008-02-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080213000626/http://www.sacrednamebible.com/kjvstrongs/STRHEB5.htm| archivedate= 13 February 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grammarians frequently list ''ʾāmán'' under its three [[abjad|consonants]] ([[aleph]]-[[mem]]-[[Nun (letter)|nun]]), which are identical to those of ''ʾāmēn'' (note that the Hebrew letter א ''aleph'' represents a [[glottal stop]] sound, which functions as a consonant in the morphology of Hebrew).&lt;ref name=&quot;AHD&quot;/&gt; This [[triliteral]] root means ''to be firm, confirmed, reliable, faithful, have faith, believe.''

In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the word is derived from {{Citation needed span|text=its triliteral common root word ʾĀmen|date=August 2020|reason=}} ({{lang-ar| آمن}}), which has the same meanings as the Hebrew root word.

Some adherents of Eastern religions believe that ''amen'' shares roots with the Hindu [[Sanskrit]] word ''[[Om|Aum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Yogananda, Paramahansa. Autobiography of a Yoga, 1946, chapter 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sri H.W.L Poonja, 'The Truth is', Published by Samuel Weiser, 2000, {{ISBN|1-57863-175-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mandalayoga.net/content/mantra-om Mandala Yoga] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222171119/http://www.mandalayoga.net/content/mantra-om |date=22 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindubooks.org/sudheer_birodkar/hindu_history/omkar.html|title=Hindu Culture - Omkar and Swastika|work=hindubooks.org|accessdate=2 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906211023/http://www.hindubooks.org/sudheer_birodkar/hindu_history/omkar.html|archive-date=6 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such external etymologies are not included in standard etymological reference works. The Hebrew word, as noted above, starts with aleph, while the Egyptian name begins with a [[yodh]].&lt;ref&gt;Erman, Adolf &amp; Grapow, Hermann: [[Wörterbuch der ägyptischen Sprache]], Im Auftrage der Deutschen Akademien, Berlin: Akademie Verlag (1971), p.85&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Armenian language|Armenian]] word {{wikt-lang|hy|ամեն}} (''amen'') means &quot;every&quot;; however it is also used in the same form at the conclusion of prayers, much as in English.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amen: Behind the word and meaning&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abrahamicstudyhall.org/2018/08/12/amen-behind-the-word-and-meaning/|title=Amen: Behind the word and meaning|date=2018-08-12|website=ASH|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In French, the Hebrew word ''amen'' is sometimes translated as ''Ainsi soit-il'', which means &quot;So be it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amen: Behind the word and meaning&quot;/&gt;

The linguist [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] argues that, as in the case of [[Hallelujah]], the word ''amen'' is usually not replaced by a translation due to the speakers’ belief in [[iconicity]], their perception that there is something intrinsic about the relationship between the sound of the signifier (the word) and what it signifies (its meaning).&lt;ref&gt;[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] (2003), [[Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew]]. [[Palgrave Macmillan]]. {{ISBN|9781403917232}} / {{ISBN|9781403938695}} [http://www.palgrave.com/br/book/9781403917232]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|62}}

===Hebrew Bible===
The word occurs in the [[Hebrew Bible]] 30 times;  in Deuteronomy alone 12 times beginning at 27:15. The fixed phrase 'Amen, Amen' is seen 5 times - Psalm 41:13;72:19; 89:52; Numbers 5:22; Nehemiah 8:6. It is translated as 'of truth' 2 times in Isaiah 65:16. Three distinct Biblical usages of ''amen'' may be noted:&lt;ref name=&quot;ce&quot;/&gt;
# Initial ''amen'', referring back to words of another speaker and introducing an affirmative sentence, e.g. 1 [[Books of Kings|Kings]] 1:36.&lt;ref name=&quot;ce&quot;/&gt;
# Detached ''amen'', again referring to the words of another speaker but without a complementary affirmative sentence, e.g. Nehemiah 5:13.&lt;ref name=&quot;ce&quot;/&gt;
# Final ''amen'', with no change of speaker, as in the subscription to the first three divisions of [[Psalms]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ce&quot;/&gt;

=== New Testament ===
The word occurs 52 times in the [[Synoptic Gospels]]; the [[Gospel of John]] has 25.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Amen&quot;, ''[[Encyclopedia Biblica]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The uses of ''amen'' (&quot;verily&quot; or &quot;I tell you the truth&quot;, depending on the translation) in the [[Gospels]] form a peculiar class; they are initial and often lack any reference to a prior within the book's referent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1383&amp;letter=A&amp;search=Amen|encyclopedia=Jewish Encyclopedia|title=Amen|accessdate=2008-02-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080216101007/http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1383&amp;letter=A&amp;search=Amen| archivedate= 16 February 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the initial amen (whether single or double in form{{vague|reason= in what sense or aspect of &quot;[[form]]&quot;|date=May 2020}}) to introduce solemn statements of [[Jesus]] in the Gospels had no parallel in contemporary Jewish practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amen&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| title = Amen | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica. | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica Online. | year = 2008 | url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9006072/amen | accessdate = 2008-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Raymond Brown says that Jesus peculiar and authentic reminiscent use of amen in the Fourth Gospel is an affirmation that what he is about to say is an echo from the Father.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Brown, The Gospel According to John Vol 1, Anchor Bible Dictionary, page 84&lt;/ref&gt;    

In the [[King James Version of the Bible|King James Bible]], the word ''amen'' is seen in a number of contexts. Notable ones include:
* The [[catechism]] of curses of the [[Torah|Law]] found in [[Deuteronomy]] 27.&lt;ref name=&quot;ce&quot;/&gt;
* A double ''amen'' (&quot;amen and amen&quot;) occurs in [[Psalm]] 89 (Psalm 41:13; 72:19; 89:52), to confirm the words and invoke the fulfillment of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;eastonsbibledictionary.com&quot;/&gt;
* ''Amen'' occurs in several [[doxology]] formulas in [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 1:25, 9:5, 11:36, 15:33, and several times in Chapter 16.&lt;ref name=&quot;ce&quot;/&gt; It also appears in doxologies in the Psalms (41:14; 72:19; 89:53; 106:48). This liturgical form from [[Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. John L. McKenzie, SJ, &quot;Dictionary of the Bible&quot;, New York: MacMillan Publ. Co., Inc., 1965. Entry: &quot;Amen,&quot; (p. 25)&lt;/ref&gt;
* It concludes all of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul's]] general [[epistle]]s.
* In [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 3:14, Jesus is referred to as, &quot;the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of God's creation.&quot;  The whole passage reads as &quot;And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God&quot;.
* ''Amen'' concludes last book of the [[New Testament]], at Rev. 22:21.

Although amen, in Judaism, is commonly used as a response to a blessing, it also is often used as an affirmation of other forms of declaration.

Jewish rabbinical [[halakha|law]] requires an individual to say ''amen'' in a variety of contexts.

&lt;ref&gt;|[[Orach Chaim|O.C.]] 124 (amen in response to [[brachah|blessing]]s recited by the [[Hazzan|prayer reader]])&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt; [[Orach Chaim|O.C.]] 215 (amen in response to [[brachah|blessing]]s made by any individual outside of the liturgy)&lt;/ref&gt;
With the rise of the synagogue during the [[Second Temple]] period, ''amen'' became a common response, especially to benedictions. It is recited communally to affirm a [[brachah|blessing]] made by the [[Hazzan|prayer reader]]. It is also mandated as a response during the [[kaddish]] doxology.
The congregation is sometimes prompted to answer &quot;amen&quot; by the terms ''ve-'imru'' ({{lang-he|ואמרו}}) = &quot;and [now] say (pl.),&quot; or, ''ve-nomar'' (ונאמר) = &quot;and let us say.&quot; Contemporary usage reflects ancient practice: As early as the 4th century BCE, Jews assembled in the [[second temple|Temple]] responded &quot;amen&quot; at the close of a doxology or other prayer uttered by a [[kohen|priest]]. This Jewish [[liturgical]] use of amen was adopted by the Christians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amen&quot;/&gt; But [[halakha|Jewish law]] also requires individuals to answer ''amen'' whenever they hear a [[brachah|blessing]] recited, even in a non-liturgical setting.

The [[Talmud]] teaches [[Homiletics|homiletically]] that the word ''amen'' is an [[acronym]] for '''א'''ל '''מ'''לך '''נ'''אמן (''{{lang|he-Latn|ʾEl melekh neʾeman}}'', &quot;God, trustworthy King&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;Tractate Shabbat 119b&quot;&gt;[[Shabbat (Talmud)|Tractate Shabbat]] 119b and [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Tractate Sanhedrin]] 111a&lt;/ref&gt; the phrase recited silently by an individual before reciting the [[Shma]].

Jews usually approximate the Hebrew pronunciation of the word: {{IPAc-en|ɑː|ˈ|m|ɛ|n}} {{respell|ah|MEN|'}} (Israeli-[[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi]] and [[Sephardi Hebrew language|Sephardi]]) or {{IPAc-en|ɔː|ˈ|m|eɪ|n}} {{respell|aw|MAYN|'}} (non-Israeli Ashkenazi).&lt;ref&gt;''To Pray as a Jew: A Guide to the Prayer Book and the Synagogue Service,'' Hayim Halevy Donin&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christianity ===
The use of &quot;amen&quot; has been generally adopted in Christian worship as a concluding word&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Amen |volume=1 |page=804}}&lt;/ref&gt; for prayers and hymns and an expression of strong agreement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amen&quot;/&gt;  The liturgical use of the word in apostolic times is attested by the passage from 1 Corinthians cited above, and [[Justin Martyr]] (c. 150) describes the congregation as responding &quot;amen&quot; to the benediction after the celebration of the Eucharist.&lt;ref name=&quot;ce&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;  Its introduction into the baptismal formula (in the Eastern Orthodox Church it is pronounced after the name of each person of the Trinity) was probably later.&lt;ref&gt;Among certain [[gnosticism|Gnostic]] sects, ''Amen'' became the name of an angel.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In [[Isaiah]] 65:16, the authorized version has &quot;the God of truth&quot; (&quot;the God of amen&quot; in [[Hebrew]]). Jesus often used amen to put emphasis to his own words (translated: &quot;verily&quot; or &quot;truly&quot;). In John's Gospel, it is repeated, &quot;Verily, verily&quot; (or &quot;Truly, truly&quot;). Amen is also used in oaths (Numbers 5:22; Deuteronomy 27:15–26; Nehemiah 5:13; 8:6; 1 Chronicles 16:36) and is further found at the end of the prayer of primitive churches (1 Corinthians 14:16).&lt;ref name=&quot;eastonsbibledictionary.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eastonsbibledictionary.com/a/amen.htm|title=Bible Dictionary: Amen|work=eastonsbibledictionary.com|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--:''(from an old encyclopedia)''--&gt;
In some Christian [[Church (building)|churches]], the &quot;amen corner&quot; or &quot;amen section&quot; is any subset of the congregation likely to call out &quot;Amen!&quot; in response to points in a preacher's [[sermon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hovda|first1=Robert W.|title=The amen corner|journal=Worship|date=1983|volume=57|issue=2|pages=150–156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphorically, the term can refer to any group of heartfelt traditionalists or supporters of an authority figure.

''Amen'' is also used in standard, international French, but in [[Cajun French]] ''{{lang|fr|Ainsi soit-il}}'' (&quot;so be it&quot;) is used instead.

Amen is used at the end of the [[Lord's Prayer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Matthew 6:9– 15|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206:9-15&amp;version=WYC|work=Wycliffe Bible|author=Wycliffe}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is also called the Our Father or the ''Pater Noster''.

[[File:Ameen.gif|thumb|ʾĀmīn in [[Arabic]].]]
''ʾĀmīn'' ({{lang-ar|آمين}}) is the Arabic form of ''Amen''. In Islam, it is used with the same meaning as in Judaism and Christianity; when concluding a prayer, especially after a [[supplication]] ([[du'a]]) or reciting the first surah [[Al Fatiha]] of the [[Qur'an]] ([[salat]]), and as an assent to the prayers of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hastings | first = James | authorlink=James Hastings| title = A Dictionary of Christ and the Gospels: Volume I | publisher = The Minerva Group, Inc.| origyear=1901| year = 2004 | page = 52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Glassé | first = Cyril | title = The New Encyclopedia of Islam | publisher = Stacey International | year = 2003| page = 48 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=focLrox-frUC&amp;pg=PA48

The number of attacks from January to September 2009 had surpassed the previous year's total due to the increased pirate attacks in the Gulf of Aden and off Somalia. Between January and September the number of attacks rose to 306 from 293. The pirates boarded the vessels in 114 cases and hijacked 34 of them so far in 2009. Gun use in pirate attacks has gone up to 176 cases from 76 last year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hvd4QSDb-PaSYhIQlkyM8gcykpLgD9BFC6880|title=World pirate attacks surge in 2009 due to Somalia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than cargo, modern pirates have targeted the personal belongings of the crew and the contents of the ship's safe, which potentially contains large amounts of cash needed for payroll and port fees. In other cases, the pirates force the crew off the ship and then sail it to a port to be repainted and given a new identity through false papers purchased from corrupt or complicit officials.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anarchy at Sea&quot; Atlantic Monthly. September 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern piracy can also take place in conditions of political unrest. For example, following the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam, Thai piracy was aimed at the many Vietnamese who took to boats to escape. Further, following the disintegration of the government of Somalia, [[warlord]]s in the region have attacked ships delivering UN food aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Pirates Open Fire on Cruise Ship off Somalia | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/05/AR2005110500622.html?nav=hcmodule | access-date=November 14, 2005 | work=The Washington Post | date=November 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack against the German-built cruise ship the ''[[The Seabourn Spirit|Seabourn Spirit]]'' offshore of Somalia in November 2005 is an example of the sophisticated pirates mariners face. The pirates carried out their attack more than {{convert|100|mi|km}} offshore with speedboats launched from a larger mother ship. The attackers were armed with automatic firearms and an [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Piracy is still troubling the shipping industry: report; Industry fears revival of attacks though current situation has improved,&quot; ''The Business Times Singapore''.

Since 2008, Somali pirates centered in the Gulf of Aden made about $120 million annually, reportedly costing the shipping industry between $900 million and $3.3 billion per year.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/03/03/the-economics-of-somali-piracy/ The economics of Somali piracy],&quot; ''The Washington Post,'' March 3, 2013 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; By September 2012, the heyday of piracy in the Indian Ocean was reportedly over.

Many nations forbid ships to enter their territorial waters or ports if the crew of the ships are armed, in an effort to restrict possible piracy.&lt;ref&gt;Maritimesecurity.com article, [http://www.maritimesecurity.com/gunsonboard.htm Guns On Board].&lt;/ref&gt; Shipping companies sometimes hire private armed security guards.

Modern definitions of piracy include the following acts:
* [[Boarding (attack)|Boarding]] without permission.
* [[Extortion]]
* [[Hostage taking]]
* [[Kidnapping]] of people for [[ransom]]
* [[Murder]]
* Cargo theft
* Robbery and seizure of items or the ship
* [[Sabotage]] resulting in the ship subsequently sinking
* [[Shipwreck]]ing done intentionally to a ship

For the United States, piracy is one of the offenses against which Congress is delegated power to enact penal legislation by the [[Constitution of the United States]], along with [[treason]] and offenses against the [[law of nations]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} Treason is generally making war against one's own countrymen, and violations of the law of nations can include [[just war|unjust war]] among other nationals or by governments against their own people.

In modern times, ships and airplanes are [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] for political reasons as well. The perpetrators of these acts could be described as pirates (for instance, the French term for ''plane hijacker'' is ''pirate de l'air'', literally ''air pirate''), but in English are usually termed ''hijackers''. An example is the hijacking of the Italian civilian passenger ship ''[[MS Achille Lauro|Achille Lauro]]'' by the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] in 1985, which is regarded as an act of piracy. A 2009 book entitled ''International Legal Dimension of Terrorism'' called the attackers &quot;terrorists&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sánchez, Pablo Antonio Fernandez ''. International Legal Dimension of Terrorism''. Brill, 2009. p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern pirates also use a great deal of technology. It has been reported that crimes of piracy have involved the use of [[mobile phone]]s, [[satellite phone]]s, [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], [[machete]]s, [[AK74]] rifles, [[Sonar]] systems, modern [[speedboat]]s, [[shotgun]]s, [[pistol]]s, mounted [[machine gun]]s, and even RPGs and [[grenade launcher]]s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

In 2020, the amount of piracy increased by 24% after being at its lowest peak since the beginning of the century in 2019. The Americas and Africa have been identified by the [[International Chamber of Commerce]] as the most vulnerable to piracy as a result of less-wealthy governments in the regions being unable to adequately combat piracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Global sea piracy ticks upward, and the coronavirus may make it worse|url=http://theconversation.com/global-sea-piracy-ticks-upward-and-the-coronavirus-may-make-it-worse-137586|last=Prins|first=Brandon|website=The Conversation|language=en|access-date=2020-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under a principle of international law known as the &quot;universality principle&quot;, a government may &quot;exercise jurisdiction over conduct outside its territory if that conduct is universally dangerous to states and their nationals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Buergenthal &amp; Sean D. Murphy, ''Public International Law in a Nutshell'', p. 211, West Group (3d ed. 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale behind the universality principle is that states will punish certain acts &quot;wherever they may occur as a means of protecting the global community as a whole, even absent a link between the state and the parties or the acts in question.&quot; Under this principle, the concept of &quot;universal jurisdiction&quot; applies to the crime of piracy.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Buergenthal &amp; Sean D. Murphy, ''Public International Law in a Nutshell'', pp. 211–212, West Group (3d ed. 2002), citing generally K. Randall, ''Universal Jurisdiction Under International Law'', 66 Tex. L. Rev. 785 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the United States has a statute (section 1651 of title 18 of the United States Code) imposing a sentence of life in prison for piracy &quot;as defined by the law of nations&quot; committed anywhere on the high seas, regardless of the nationality of the pirates or the victims.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Whoever, on the high seas, commits the crime of piracy as defined by the law of nations, and is afterwards brought into or found in the United States, shall be imprisoned for life.&quot; See {{usc|18|1651}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of maritime security operations is &quot;actively to deter, disrupt and suppress piracy in order to protect global maritime security and secure freedom of navigation for the benefit of all nations&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2010-to-2015-government-policy-piracy-off-the-coast-of-somalia/2010-to-2015-government-policy-piracy-off-the-coast-of-somalia |title=2010 to 2015 government policy: piracy off the coast of Somalia |website=UK Government|date=May 8, 2015 |access-date= June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pirates are often detained, interrogated, disarmed, and released. With millions of dollars at stake, pirates have little incentive to stop. In Finland, one case involved pirates who had been captured and whose boat was sunk. As the pirates attacked a vessel of Singapore, not Finland, and are not themselves EU or Finnish citizens, they were not prosecuted. A further complication in many cases, including this one, is that many countries do not allow extradition of people to jurisdictions where they may be sentenced to death or torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122757123487054681 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Bret | last=Stephens | title=Why Don't We Hang Pirates Anymore? | date=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-defense===
The fourth volume of the handbook: ''Best Management Practices to Deter Piracy off the Coast of Somalia and in the Arabian Sea Area'' (known as BMP4)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocimf.org/media/8189/OCIMF_BMP4_Cover%20and%20Book.pdf|title=''Best Management Practices to Deter Piracy off the Coast of Somalia and in the Arabian Sea Area'', v4, published in August 2011 by OCIMF – Oil Companies International Marine Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the current authoritative guide for merchant ships on self-defense against pirates. The guide is issued and updated by ''Oil Companies International Marine Forum'' (OCIMF), a consortium of interested international shipping and trading organizations including the EU, NATO and the International Maritime Bureau.&lt;ref name=&quot;bmp3&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.mschoa.org/docs/public-documents/bmp4-low-res_sept_5_2011.pdf|title=Best Management Practices for Protection against Somalia Based Piracy|publisher=Witherby Seamanship International, London|access-date=September 10, 2016|date=2011|author=Consortium of International Organizations|isbn=978-1-85609-505-1|location=Livingston|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909191819/http://www.mschoa.org/docs/public-documents/bmp4-low-res_sept_5_2011.pdf|archive-date=September 9, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is distributed primarily by the [[Maritime Security Centre – Horn of Africa]] (MSCHOA), the planning and coordination authority for EU naval forces (EUNAVFOR). BMP4 encourages vessels to register their voyages through the region with MSCHOA as this registration is a key component of the operation of the International Recommended Transit Corridor (IRTC, the navy-patrolled route through the Gulf of Aden). BMP4 contains a chapter entitled &quot;Self-Protective Measures&quot; which lays out a list of steps a merchant vessel can take on its own to make itself less of a target to pirates and make it better able to repel an attack if one occurs. This list includes rigging the deck of the ship with [[razor wire]], rigging fire-hoses to spray sea-water over the side of the ship (to hinder boardings), having a distinctive pirate alarm, hardening the bridge against gunfire and creating a &quot;[[safe room|citadel]]&quot; where the crew can retreat in the event pirates get on board. Other unofficial self-defense measures that can be found on merchant vessels include the setting up of mannequins posing as armed guards or firing flares at the pirates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/world/2011/01/12/verjee.pirate.proof.pre.cnn |title=&quot;CNN's Zain Verjee reports on modern day piracy,&quot; 22 February 2011 |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date=July 16, 2010 |access-date=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it varies by country, generally peacetime law in the 20th and 21st centuries has not allowed merchant vessels to carry weapons. As a response to the rise in modern piracy, however, the U.S. government changed its rules so that it is now possible for [[flag state|U.S.-flagged vessels]] to embark a team of armed private security guards. The [[US Coastguard]] leaves it to ship owners' discretion to determine if those guards will be armed.&lt;ref name=&quot;John W.

First and foremost, the best protection against pirates is simply to avoid encountering them. This can be accomplished by using tools such as [[radar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinebuzz.com/2009/09/09/bae-systems-reveal-anti-sea-piracy-systems/|title=Anti-piracy radar|access-date=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by using specialised systems that use shorter wavelengths (as small boats are not always picked up by radar). An example of a specialised system is WatchStander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22229714.700-pirates-incoming-ship-radar-keeps-watch-and-hits-back.html#.VHJslWelhki|title=Pirates incoming! Ship radar keeps watch and hits back|work=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, while the non-wartime 20th century tradition has been for merchant vessels not to be armed, the U.S. Government has recently changed the rules so that it is now &quot;best practice&quot; for vessels to embark a team of armed private security guards.&lt;ref name=&quot;John W.

Other measures vessels can take to protect themselves against piracy are air-pressurised boat stopping systems which can fire a variety of vessel-disabling projectiles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37257236|title=Do you have an AK-47 and can you swim?|first=Padraig|last=Belton|date=September 9, 2016|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  implementing a high freewall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/05/05/piracy.hearing/index.html|title=High wall providing extra protection|access-date=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and vessel boarding protection systems (e.g., hot water wall, electricity-charged water wall, automated fire monitor, slippery foam).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secure-marine.com/Waters/BROCHURE_Secure-Waters.pdf|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5o95MMMRO?url=http://www.secure-marine.com/Waters/BROCHURE_Secure-Waters.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 11, 2010|title=Hot/electricity charged water wall|access-date=January 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ships can also attempt to protect themselves using their Automatic Identification Systems (AIS).&lt;ref&gt;BBC,[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18889594] Satellite tracking of AIS&lt;/ref&gt; Every ship over 300 tons carries a transponder supplying both information about the ship itself and its movements. Any unexpected change in this information can attract attention. Previously this data could only be picked up if there was a nearby ship, thus rendering single ships vulnerable. However, special satellites have been launched recently that are now able to detect and retransmit this data. Large ships cannot therefore be hijacked without being detected. This can act as a deterrent to attempts to either hijack the entire ship or steal large portions of cargo with another ship since an escort can be sent more quickly than might otherwise have been the case.

===Patrol===
In an emergency warships can be called upon. In some areas such as near Somalia, patrolling naval vessels from different nations are available to intercept vessels attacking merchant vessels. For patrolling dangerous coastal waters, or keeping cost down, [[robotic]] or [[remote-controlled]] [[Unmanned surface vehicle|USV]]s are also sometimes used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/robotics/4229443.html|title=Robotic/remote-controlled USVs|work=Popular Mechanics|access-date=October 23, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130061106/http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/robotics/4229443.html|archive-date=January 30, 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shore- and vessel-launched [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]s are used by the U.S. Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naval-technology.com/features/feature62615/|title=Vessel-launched UAV's|access-date=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=64448|title=Shore-launched UAVs|work=Stars and Stripes|access-date=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A British former [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|British chief of defence staff]] ([[David Richards, Baron Richards of Herstmonceux|David Richards]]), questioned the value of expensive kit procured by successive governments, saying &quot;We have [[£]]1bn destroyers trying to sort out pirates in a little dhow with RPGs [rocket-propelled grenade launchers] costing [[US$]]50, with an outboard motor [costing] $100&quot;.

Section 2 of the [[Piracy Act 1837]] creates a statutory offence of aggravated piracy. See also the [[Piracy Act 1850]].

In 2008 the British [[Foreign Office]] advised the Royal Navy not to detain pirates of certain nationalities as they might be able to claim asylum in Britain under [[Human Rights Act 1998|British human rights legislation]], if their national laws included execution, or mutilation as a judicial punishment for crimes committed as pirates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Marie |last=Woolf |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article3736239.ece |title=Pirates can claim UK asylum |work= [[The Sunday Times]]|date= April 13, 2008|access-date=April 22, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Definition of piracy jure gentium'''

See section 26 of, and Schedule 5 to, the Merchant Shipping and Maritime Security Act 1997. These provisions replace the Schedule to the Tokyo Convention Act 1967. In Cameron v HM Advocate, 1971 SLT 333, the [[High Court of Justiciary]] said that that Schedule supplemented the existing law and did not seek to restrict the scope of the offence of piracy jure gentium.

*Attorney General of Hong Kong v Kwok-a-Sing (1873) LR 5 PC 179

'''Jurisdiction'''

See section 46(2) of the [[Senior Courts Act 1981]] and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/41-42/73/section/6 section 6] of the [[Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act 1878]]. See also R v Kohn (1864) 4 F &amp; F 68.

'''Piracy committed by or against aircraft'''

See section 5 of the [[Aviation Security Act 1982]].

'''Sentence'''

The book &quot;[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice|Archbold]]&quot; said that in a case that does not fall within section 2 of the Piracy Act 1837, the penalty appears to be determined by the [[Offences at Sea Act 1799]], which provides that offences committed at sea are liable to the same penalty as if they had been committed upon the shore.&lt;ref&gt;[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, para. 25–46 at p. 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

'''History'''

William Hawkins said that under [[common law]], piracy by a subject was esteemed to be [[petty treason]]. The [[Treason Act 1351]] provided that this was not petty treason.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vZc0AAAAIAAJ Hawkin's ''Treatise of Pleas of the Crown'' (1824 ed.) vol. 1, chapter XIV] (from [[Google Book Search|Google Books]]). See also 40 Ass. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

In English [[admiralty law]], piracy was classified as petty treason during the medieval period, and offenders were accordingly liable to be [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] on conviction. Piracy was redefined as a [[felony]] during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. In either case, piracy cases were cognizable in the courts of the [[Admiralty|Lord High Admiral]]. English judges in [[admiralty court]]s and [[vice admiralty court]]s emphasized that &quot;neither Faith nor Oath is to be kept&quot; with pirates; i.e. contracts with pirates and oaths sworn to them were not legally binding. Pirates were legally subject to [[summary execution]] by their captors if captured in battle. In practice, instances of summary justice and annulment of oaths and contracts involving pirates do not appear to have been common.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===United States laws===

In the United States, criminal prosecution of piracy is authorized in the [[Article I of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|U.S. Constitution, Art. I Sec. 8 cl. 10]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
... To define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offences against the Law of Nations;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Title 18 U.S.C. § 1651 states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Whoever, on the high seas, commits the crime of piracy as defined by the law of nations, and is afterwards brought into or found in the United States, shall be imprisoned for life.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Citing the United States Supreme Court decision in the 1820 case of ''United States v. Smith'',&lt;ref&gt;18 U.S. 153 (1820).&lt;/ref&gt; a U.S. District Court ruled in 2010 in the case of ''United States v. Said'' that the definition of piracy under section 1651 is confined to &quot;robbery at sea.&quot; The piracy charges (but not other serious federal charges) against the defendants in the ''Said'' case were dismissed by the Court.&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum Opinion and Order, August 17, 2010, docket entry 94, ''United States v. Said'', 2:10-cr-00057-RAJ-FBS, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (Norfolk Div.).&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. District Court for the E.D.Va. has since been overturned: &quot;On May 23, 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit issued an opinion vacating the Court's dismissal of the piracy count. United States v. Said, 680 F.3d 374 (4th Cir.2012. See also United States v. Dire, 680 F.3d 446, 465 (4th Cir.2012) (upholding an instruction to the jury that the crime of piracy includes &quot;any of the three following actions: (A) any illegal acts of violence or detention or any act of depredation committed for private ends on the high seas or a place outside the jurisdiction of any state by the crew or the passengers of a private ship and directed against another ship or against persons or property on board such ship; or (B) any act of voluntary participation in the operation of a ship with knowledge of facts making it a pirate ship; or (C) any act of inciting or of intentionally facilitating an act described in(A)or(B) above&quot;).&quot; The case was remanded to E.D. Va., see US v. Said, 3 F. Supp. 3d 515 – Dist. Court, ED Virginia (2014).

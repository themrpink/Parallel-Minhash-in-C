In Dante's ''Purgatorio'', the penitent walks within flames to purge himself of lustful thoughts and feelings. In Dante's ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', unforgiven souls guilty of lust are eternally blown about in restless hurricane-like winds symbolic of their own lack of self-control of their lustful passions in earthly life.&lt;ref name=sayers101&gt;Dorothy L.

=== Gluttony ===
{{Main|Gluttony}}

[[File:Albert_Anker_-_Stillleben_-_Unmässigkeit.jpg|thumb|''Still life: Excess'' ([[Albert Anker]], 1896)]]

Gluttony (Latin: {{lang|la|gula}}) is the overindulgence and [[overconsumption]] of anything to the point of waste. The word derives from the Latin ''gluttire'', to gulp down or swallow.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

One reason for its condemnation is that gorging by the prosperous may leave the needy hungry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Okholm 2000&quot;&gt;Okholm, Dennis. [http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/2000/september4/3.62.html &quot;Rx for Gluttony&quot;]. ''[[Christianity Today]]'', Vol. 44, No. 10, 11 September 2000, p.62&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval church leaders (e.g., [[Thomas Aquinas]]) took a more expansive view of gluttony,&lt;ref name=&quot;Okholm 2000&quot;/&gt; arguing that it could also include an obsessive anticipation of meals, and over-indulgence in delicacies and costly foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06590a.htm|title=Gluttony|encyclopedia=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquinas listed five forms of gluttony:

* ''Laute'' – eating too expensively
* ''Studiose'' – eating too daintily
* ''Nimis'' – eating too much
* ''Praepropere'' – eating too soon
* ''Ardenter'' – eating too eagerly

Of these, ''ardenter'' is often considered the most serious, since it is a passion for a mere earthly pleasure, which can make the committer eat impulsively, or even reduce the goals of life to mere eating and drinking. This is exemplified by [[Esau]] selling his birthright for a mess of pottage, a &quot;profane person . . . who, for a morsel of meat sold his birthright&quot;, and later &quot;found no place for repentance, though he sought it carefully, with tears&quot;.{{bibleref2c|Gen|25:30|NASB}}

=== Greed ===
{{Main|Greed}}
[[File:The_worship_of_Mammon.jpg|thumb|''The Worship of [[Mammon]]'' (1909) by [[Evelyn De Morgan]].
]]
Greed (Latin: {{lang|la|avaritia}}), also known as ''avarice'', ''cupidity'', or ''covetousness'', is, like lust and gluttony, a sin of desire. However, greed (as seen by the Church) is applied to an artificial, rapacious desire and pursuit of material possessions. Thomas Aquinas wrote, &quot;Greed is a sin against God, just as all mortal sins, in as much as man condemns things eternal for the sake of temporal things.&quot; In Dante's Purgatory, the penitents are bound and laid face down on the ground for having concentrated excessively on earthly thoughts. [[Hoard]]ing of materials or objects, [[theft]] and [[robbery]], especially by means of [[violence]], [[trickery]], or [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] of [[authority]] are all actions that may be inspired by greed. Such misdeeds can include [[simony]], where one attempts to purchase or sell [[sacraments]], including [[Holy Orders]] and, therefore, positions of authority in the Church hierarchy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

In the words of Henry Edward, avarice &quot;plunges a man deep into the mire of this world, so that he makes it to be his god&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;/&gt;

As defined outside Christian writings, greed is an inordinate desire to acquire or possess more than one needs, especially with respect to [[material wealth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/greed|title=greed| work=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|edition=5th|year=2016|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|via=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=4 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like pride, it can lead to not just some, but all evil.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aquinas&quot;/&gt;

=== Sloth ===
{{Main|Sloth (deadly sin)}}
[[File:Abraham Bloemaert - Parable of the Wheat and the Tares - Walters 372505.jpg|thumb|''[[Parable of the Tares|Parable of the Wheat and the Tares]]'' (1624) by [[Abraham Bloemaert]], [[Walters Art Museum]]
]]
Sloth (Latin: ''tristitia'' or ''{{lang|la|[[acedia]]}}'' (&quot;without care&quot;)) refers to a peculiar jumble of notions, dating from antiquity and including mental, spiritual, pathological, and physical states.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Seven Deadly Sins: Society and Evil|last=Lyman|first=Stanford|publisher=|year=1989|isbn=0-930390-81-4|location=|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be defined as absence of interest or habitual disinclination to exertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/sloth?s=t|title=the definition of sloth|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Summa Theologica'', [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]] defined sloth as &quot;sorrow about spiritual good&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aquinas&quot;/&gt;

The scope of sloth is wide.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;/&gt; Spiritually, ''acedia'' first referred to an affliction attending religious persons, especially monks, wherein they became indifferent to their duties and obligations to [[God]]. Mentally, ''acedia'' has a number of distinctive components of which the most important is affectlessness, a lack of any feeling about self or other, a mind-state that gives rise to boredom, rancor, apathy, and a passive inert or sluggish mentation. Physically, ''acedia'' is fundamentally associated with a cessation of motion and an indifference to work; it finds expression in [[laziness]], idleness, and indolence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;/&gt;

Sloth includes ceasing to utilize the seven gifts of grace given by the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] ([[Wisdom]], [[Understanding]], [[Counsel]], [[Knowledge]], [[Piety]], [[Courage|Fortitude]], and [[Fear of the Lord]]);  such disregard may lead to the slowing of one's spiritual progress towards eternal life, to the neglect of manifold duties of [[Charity (practice)|charity]] towards the [[neighbourhood|neighbor]], and to animosity towards those who love God.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;/&gt;

Sloth has also been defined as a failure to do things that one should do.  By this definition, evil exists when &quot;good&quot; people fail to act.

[[Edmund Burke#False quotations|Edmund Burke]] (1729–1797) wrote in ''[[Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents|Present Discontents]]'' (II. 78) &quot;No man, who is not inflamed by vain-glory into enthusiasm, can flatter himself that his single, unsupported, desultory, unsystematic endeavours are of power to defeat the subtle designs and united Cabals of ambitious citizens. When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall, one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.&quot;

Unlike the other capital sins, which are sins of committing immorality, sloth is a sin of omitting responsibilities. It may arise from any of the other capital vices; for example, a son may omit his duty to his father through anger. While the state and habit of sloth is a mortal sin, the habit of the soul tending towards the last mortal state of sloth is not mortal in and of itself except under certain circumstances.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;/&gt;

Emotionally and cognitively, the evil of ''acedia'' finds expression in a lack of any feeling for the world, for the people in it, or for the self. ''Acedia'' takes form as an alienation of the sentient self first from the world and then from itself. Although the most profound versions of this condition are found in a withdrawal from all forms of participation in or care for others or oneself, a lesser but more noisome element was also noted by theologians. From ''tristitia'', asserted Gregory the Great, &quot;there arise malice, rancour, cowardice, [and] despair&quot;. Chaucer, too, dealt with this attribute of ''acedia'', counting the characteristics of the sin to include despair, somnolence, idleness, tardiness, negligence, indolence, and ''wrawnesse'', the last variously translated as &quot;anger&quot; or better as &quot;peevishness&quot;. For Chaucer, human's sin consists of languishing and holding back, refusing to undertake works of goodness because, he/she tells him/her self, the circumstances surrounding the establishment of good are too grievous and too difficult to suffer. ''Acedia''  in Chaucer's view is thus the enemy of every source and motive for work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Seven Deadly Sins: Society and Evil|last=Lyman|first=Stanford|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloth not only subverts the livelihood of the body, taking no care for its day-to-day provisions, but also slows down the mind, halting its attention to matters of great importance. Sloth hinders the man in his righteous undertakings and thus becomes a terrible source of human's undoing.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;/&gt;

In his ''Purgatorio'' Dante portrayed the penance for acedia as running continuously at top speed. Dante describes acedia as the &quot;failure to love God with all one's heart, all one's mind and all one's soul&quot;; to him it was the &quot;middle sin&quot;, the only one characterised by an absence or insufficiency of love.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

=== Wrath ===
{{Main|Wrath}}
[[File:Jacques_de_l'Ange_-_A_young_Man_with_a_Sword_restrained_by_a_young_Woman,_'Anger'.jpg|thumb|''Wrath'', by [[Jacques de l'Ange]]]]
Wrath (Latin: {{lang|la|ira}}) can be defined as uncontrolled feelings of [[anger]], [[rage (emotion)|rage]], and even [[hatred]]. Wrath often reveals itself in the wish to seek vengeance.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Seven deadly Sins: A companion|last=Landau|first=Ronnie|publisher=|isbn=978-1-4457-3227-5|location=|pages=|date=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its purest form, wrath presents with injury, violence, and hate that may provoke [[feuds]] that can go on for centuries. Wrath may persist long after the person who did another a grievous wrong is dead. Feelings of wrath can manifest in different ways, including [[impatience]], [[misanthropy|hateful misanthropy]], [[revenge]], and [[self-destructive behavior]], such as drug abuse or suicide.{{Original research inline|date=June 2016}}

According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, the neutral act of anger becomes the sin of wrath when it is directed against an innocent person, when it is unduly strong or long-lasting, or when it desires excessive punishment. &quot;If anger reaches the point of a deliberate desire to kill or seriously wound a neighbor, it is gravely against charity; it is a mortal sin.&quot; (CCC 2302) Hatred is the sin of desiring that someone else may suffer misfortune or evil, and is a mortal sin when one desires grave harm. (CCC 2302–03)

People feel angry when they sense that they or someone they care about has been offended, when they are certain about the nature and cause of the angering event, when they are certain someone else is responsible, and when they feel they can still influence the situation or [[Coping (psychology)|cope]] with it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anger pg 290&quot;&gt;International Handbook of Anger. p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;

In her introduction to Purgatory, [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] describes wrath as &quot;love of [[justice]] perverted to revenge and [[Spite (sentiment)|spite]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;/&gt;

In accordance with Henry Edward, angry people are &quot;slaves to themselves&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;/&gt;

=== Envy ===
{{Main|Envy}}
[[File:Bartolomeo_Manfredi_-_Cain_Kills_Abel,_c._1600,_Kunsthistorisches_Museum_(Vienna).jpg|thumb|[[Cain and Abel#Motives|''Cain killing Abel'']] (c. 1600) by [[Bartolomeo Manfredi]]]]

Envy (Latin: {{lang|la|invidia}}), like greed and lust, is characterized by an insatiable desire. It can be described as a sad or resentful covetousness towards the traits or possessions of someone else. It arises from [[Vanity|vainglory]],&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7Cf9Bt1DWsC|title=Summa Theologica, Volume 3 (Part II, Second Section)|last=Aquinas|first=St Thomas|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|isbn=9781602065581|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and severs a man from his neighbor.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;/&gt;

Malicious envy is similar to jealousy in that they both feel discontent towards someone's traits, status, abilities, or rewards. A difference is that the envious also desire the entity and covet it. Envy can be directly related to the [[Ten Commandments]], specifically, &quot;Neither shall you covet&amp;nbsp;... anything that belongs to your neighbour&quot;—a statement that may also be related to [[greed]]. Dante defined envy as &quot;a desire to deprive other men of theirs&quot;. In Dante's Purgatory, the punishment for the envious is to have their eyes sewn shut with wire because they gained sinful pleasure from seeing others brought low. According to St. Thomas Aquinas, the struggle aroused by envy has three stages: during the first stage, the envious person attempts to lower another's reputation; in the middle stage, the envious person receives either &quot;joy at another's misfortune&quot; (if he succeeds in defaming the other person) or &quot;grief at another's prosperity&quot; (if he fails); the third stage is hatred because &quot;sorrow causes hatred&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/aquinas/summa/sum291.htm|title=Summa Theologica: Treatise on The Theological Virtues (QQ[1&amp;#93; – 46): Question. 36 – Of Envy (four articles)|publisher=Sacred-texts.com|date=|accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Envy is said to be the motivation behind [[Cain and Abel|Cain]] murdering his brother, [[Cain and Abel|Abel]], as Cain envied Abel because God favored Abel's sacrifice over Cain's.

[[Bertrand Russell]] said that envy was one of the most potent causes of unhappiness,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Conquest of Happiness|url=https://archive.org/details/conquestofhappin0000russ|url-access=registration|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|publisher=[[Horace Liveright|H.

In accordance with the most widely accepted views, only pride weighs down the soul more than envy among the capital sins. Just like pride, envy has been associated directly with the devil, for Wisdom 2:24 states: &quot;the envy of the devil brought death to the world&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt;{{clear}}

=== Pride ===
{{Main|Pride}}
[[File:Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder_-_The_Tower_of_Babel_(Vienna)_-_Google_Art_Project_-_edited.jpg|thumb|Building the [[Tower of Babel]] was, for Dante, an example of ''pride''. Painting by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]]|240x240px]]
[[Pride]] (Latin: {{lang|la|superbia}}) is considered, on almost every list, the original and most serious of the seven deadly sins. Out of the seven, it is the most angelical, or demonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Climacus|first=John|title=The Ladder of Divine Ascent, Translation by Colm Luibheid and Norman Russell|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also thought to be the source of the other capital sins. Also known as ''[[hubris]]'' (from [[ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:ὕβρις|ὕβρις]]}}), or ''futility'', it is identified as dangerously corrupt selfishness, the putting of one's own desires, urges, wants, and whims before the welfare of other people.

In even more destructive cases, it is irrationally believing that one is essentially and necessarily better, superior, or more important than others, failing to acknowledge the accomplishments of others, and excessive admiration of the personal image or self (especially forgetting one's own lack of divinity, and refusing to acknowledge one's own limits, faults, or wrongs as a human being).

{{Quote|text=What the weak head with strongest bias rules, Is pride, the never-failing vice of fools.|sign=[[Alexander Pope]]|source=''[[An Essay on Criticism]]'', line 203.}}

As pride has been labelled the father of all sins, it has been deemed the devil's most prominent trait. [[C.S. Lewis]] writes, in ''[[Mere Christianity]]'', that pride is the &quot;anti-God&quot; state, the position in which the ego and the self are directly opposed to God: &quot;Unchastity, anger, greed, drunkenness, and all that, are mere fleabites in comparison: it was through Pride that the devil became the devil: Pride leads to every other vice: it is the complete anti-God state of mind.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mere Christianity, C.S. Lewis, {{ISBN|978-0-06-065292-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pride is understood to sever the spirit from God, as well as His life-and-grace-giving Presence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;/&gt;

One can be prideful for different reasons. Author [[Ichabod Spencer]] states that &quot;spiritual pride is the worst kind of pride, if not worst snare of the devil. The heart is particularly deceitful on this one thing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Burning Words of Brilliant Writers|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1895|isbn=|location=|pages=485}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] said &quot;remember that pride is the worst viper that is in the heart, the greatest disturber of the soul's peace and sweet communion with Christ; it was the first sin that ever was, and lies lowest in the foundation of Satan's whole building, and is the most difficultly rooted out, and is the most hidden, secret and deceitful of all lusts, and often creeps in, insensibly, into the midst of religion and sometimes under the disguise of humility.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=To Deborah Hatheway, Letters and Personal Writings (Works of Jonathan Edwards Online Vol. 16)|last=Claghorn|first=George|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ancient Athens, hubris was considered one of the greatest crimes and was used to refer to insolent contempt that can cause one to use violence to shame the victim. This sense of hubris could also characterize rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/hubris|title=hubris - Definition &amp; Examples|last=|first=|date=|website=Britannica.com|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] defined hubris as shaming the victim, not because of anything that happened to the committer or might happen to the committer, but merely for the committer's own gratification.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhetoric&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Rhetoric|author=Aristotle|page=1378b|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/rhetoric.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;law&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=David|title=Law, Violence, and Community in Classical Athens|page=145|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SJ9GjorvJGkC&amp;pg=PA145|isbn=0521388376|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eros&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Ludwig|first=Paul W.|title=Eros and Polis: Desire and Community in Greek Political Theory|page=178|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TvqTEy-til8C&amp;pg=PA172|isbn=1139434179|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word's connotation changed somewhat over time, with some additional emphasis towards a gross over-estimation of one's abilities.

The term has been used to analyse and make sense of the actions of contemporary heads of government by Ian Kershaw (1998), Peter Beinart (2010) and in a much more physiological manner by David Owen (2012). In this context the term has been used to describe how certain leaders, when put to positions of immense power, seem to become irrationally self-confident in their own abilities, increasingly reluctant to listen to the advice of others and progressively more impulsive in their actions.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;/&gt;

Dante's definition of pride was &quot;love of self perverted to hatred and contempt for one's neighbour&quot;.

Pride is generally associated with an absence of [[humility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jeremiekubicek.com/humility-vs-pride/|title=Humility vs Pride And Why The Difference Should Matter To You {{!}} Jeremie Kubicek|website=jeremiekubicek.com|language=en-US|access-date=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qAtNAPteVk0C&amp;q=Pride+is+generally+associated+with+an+absence+of+humility&amp;pg=PA31|title=Values, Violence, and Our Future|last=Acquaviva|first=Gary J.|date=2000|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=9042005599|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with the [[Sirach]]'s author's wording, the heart of a proud man is &quot;like a partridge in its cage acting as a decoy; like a spy he watches for your weaknesses. He changes good things into evil, he lays his traps. Just as a spark sets coals on fire, the wicked man prepares his snares in order to draw blood. Beware of the wicked man for he is planning evil. He might dishonor you forever.&quot; In another chapter, he says that &quot;the acquisitive man is not content with what he has, wicked injustice shrivels the heart.&quot;

[[Benjamin Franklin]] said &quot;In reality there is, perhaps no one of our natural passions so hard to subdue as ''pride''. Disguise it, struggle with it, stifle it, mortify it as much as one pleases, it is still alive and will every now and then peep out and show itself; you will see it, perhaps, often in this history. For even if I could conceive that I had completely overcome it, I should probably be proud of my humility.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Autobiography|last=Franklin|first=Benjamin|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Addison]] states that &quot;There is no passion that steals into the heart more imperceptibly and covers itself under more disguises than pride.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Burning Words of Brilliant Writers|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1895|isbn=|location=|pages=484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proverb &quot;pride goeth (goes) before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall&quot; (from the biblical [[Book of Proverbs]], 16:18)(or pride goeth before the fall) is thought to sum up the modern use of pride. Pride is also referred to as &quot;pride that blinds,&quot; as it often causes a committer of pride to act in foolish ways that belie common sense.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/6081830|title=The 1920 Farrow's Bank Failure: A Case of Managerial Hubris|journal=Journal of Management History|volume=20|issue=2|pages=164–178|publisher=Durham University|url-status=live|accessdate=1 October 2014|last1=Hollow|first1=Matthew|doi=10.1108/JMH-11-2012-0071|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the modern definition may be thought of as, &quot;that pride that goes just before the fall.&quot; In his two-volume biography of [[Adolf Hitler]], historian [[Ian Kershaw]] uses both 'hubris' and 'nemesis' as titles. The first volume, ''Hubris'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hitler 1889–1936: Hubris|last=Kershaw|first=Ian|publisher=[[W. W.

Much of the 10th and part of 11th chapter of the [[Sirach|Book of Sirach]] discusses and advises about pride, hubris, and who is rationally worthy of honor. It goes:

{{Quote|text=Do not store up resentment against your neighbor, no matter what his offence; do nothing in a fit of anger. Pride is odious to both God and man; injustice is abhorrent to both of them.... Do not reprehend anyone unless you have been first fully informed, consider the case first and thereafter make your reproach. Do not reply before you have listened; do not meddle in the disputes of sinners. My child, do not undertake too many activities. If you keep adding to them, you will not be without reproach; if you run after them, you will not succeed nor will you ever be free, although you try to escape.|sign=|source=[[Sirach]],10:6–31 and 11:1–10}}

Jacob Bidermann's [[medieval]] [[miracle play]], ''[[Cenodoxus]]'', pride is the deadliest of all the sins and leads directly to the damnation of the titulary famed Parisian doctor. In Dante's ''Divine Comedy'', the penitents are burdened with stone slabs on their necks to keep their heads bowed.

=== Acedia ===
{{Main|Acedia}}
[[File:Acedia_(mosaic,_Basilique_Notre-Dame_de_Fourvière).jpg|thumb|''Acedia'' [[mosaic]], [[Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvière]]]]
Acedia (Latin, {{lang|la|acedia}} &quot;without care&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;/&gt;) (from Greek ἀκηδία) is the neglect to take care of something that one should do. It is translated to [[Apathy|apathetic]] listlessness; depression without joy. It is related to [[Melancholia|melancholy]]: ''acedia'' describes the behaviour and ''melancholy'' suggests the emotion producing it. In early Christian thought, the lack of joy was regarded as a willful refusal to enjoy the goodness of God; by contrast, apathy was considered a refusal to help others in time of need.

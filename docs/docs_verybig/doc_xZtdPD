A '''highway''' is any public or private [[road]] or other public way on land. It is used for major roads, but also includes other public roads and public tracks: It is ''not'' an equivalent term to [[controlled-access highway]], or a translation for ''[[autobahn]]'', ''[[controlled-access highway|autoroute]]'', etc.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

According to [[Merriam-Webster|Merriam Webster]], the use of the term predates the 12th century. According to [[Online Etymology Dictionary|Etymonline]], &quot;high&quot; is in the sense of &quot;main&quot;.

In [[North American English|North American]] and [[Australian English]], major roads such as controlled-access highways or [[arterial (road)|arterial road]]s are often [[state highway]]s (Canada: [[provincial highway]]s). Other roads may be designated &quot;[[county highway]]s&quot; in the US and [[Ontario]]. These classifications refer to the level of government (state, provincial, county) that maintains the roadway.

In [[British English]], &quot;highway&quot; is primarily a legal term. Everyday use normally implies roads, while the legal use covers any route or path with a public right of access, including [[footpath]]s etc.

The term has led to several related derived terms, including [[highway systems by country|highway system]], [[highway code]], [[highway patrol]] and [[highwayman]].

== Overview ==
Major highways are often named and numbered by the governments that typically develop and maintain them. Australia's [[Highway 1 (Australia)|Highway 1]] is the longest national highway in the world at over  {{convert|145,00|km}} and runs almost the entire way around the continent. China has the world's largest network of highways followed closely by the United States of America. Some highways, like the [[Pan-American Highway]] or the [[European route]]s, span multiple countries. Some major highway routes include [[ferry]] services, such as [[U.S. Route 10|US Route&amp;nbsp;10]], which crosses [[Lake Michigan]].

Traditionally highways were used by [[pedestrian|people on foot]] or on [[horse]]s. Later they also accommodated [[carriage]]s, [[bicycles]] and eventually [[motor car]]s, facilitated by advancements in [[road construction]]. In the 1920s and 1930s, many nations began investing heavily in progressively more modern highway systems to spur [[commerce]] and bolster national defence.

Major modern highways that connect cities in populous [[developed countries|developed]] and [[developing countries]] usually incorporate features intended to enhance the road's capacity, efficiency, and safety to various degrees. Such features include a [[limited access road|reduction in the number of locations for user access]], the use of [[dual carriageway]]s with two or more lanes on each carriageway, and [[grade-separated]] junctions with other roads and modes of transport. These features are typically present on highways built as ''[[motorway]]s'' (''[[freeway]]s'').

== Terminology ==

=== England and Wales ===
The general legal definition deals with right of use not the form of construction; this is distinct from e.g. the popular use of the word in the US. A highway is defined in English [[common law]] by a number of similarly-worded definitions such as &quot;a way over which all members of the public have the right to pass and repass without hindrance&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Diplock LJ, Suffolk County Council v. Mason [1979] AC 705&lt;/ref&gt; usually accompanied by &quot;at all times&quot;; ownership of the ground is for most purposes irrelevant thus the term encompasses all such ways from the widest trunk roads in public ownership to the narrowest footpath providing unlimited pedestrian access over private land.

A highway might be open to all forms of lawful land traffic (i.e. vehicular, horse, pedestrian) or limited to specific types of traffic or combinations of types of traffic; usually a highway available to vehicles is available to foot or horse traffic, a highway available to horse traffic is available to pedestrians but exceptions can apply usually in the form of a highway only being available to vehicles or subdivided into dedicated parallel sections for different users.

A highway can share ground with a private right of way for which full use is not available to the general public as often will be the case with farm roads which the owner may use for any purpose but for which the general public only has a right of use on foot or horseback. The status of ''highway'' on most older roads has been gained by established public use while newer roads are typically ''dedicated'' as highways from the time they are adopted (taken into the care and control of a council or other public authority). In England and Wales, a public highway is also known as &quot;''The Queen's Highway''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year = 2013 |url = http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Queen's%2Bhighway |title = Queen's highway |encyclopedia = Oxford Dictionaries |publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The core definition of a highway is modified in various legislation for a number of purposes but only for the specific matters dealt with in each such piece of legislation. This is typically in the case of bridges, tunnels and other structures whose ownership, mode of use or availability would otherwise exclude them from the general definition of a highway, examples in recent years are commonly toll bridges and tunnels which have the definition of ''highway'' imposed upon them (in a legal order applying only to the individual structure) to allow application of most traffic laws to those using them but without causing all of the general obligations or rights of use otherwise applicable to a highway.

What is called highways in the context of automated vehicle, is called motorways in the UK context.&lt;ref&gt;Defining Safe Automated Driving Insurer Requirements for Highway Automation Thatcham Research 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scotland ===
Scots law is similar to English law with regard to highways but with differing terminology and legislation. What is defined in England as a ''highway'' will often in Scotland be what is defined by s.151 [[Roads (Scotland) Act 1984]] (but only &quot;in this act&quot; although other legislation could imitate) simply as a '''road''', that is :-
*&quot;any way (other than a waterway) over which there is a public right of passage (by whatever means [and whether subject to a toll or not]) and includes the road’s verge, and any bridge (whether permanent or temporary) over which, or tunnel through which, the road passes; and any reference to a road includes a part thereof; &quot;

The word ''highway'' is itself no longer a statutory expression in Scots law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1 = Ann |last1 = Faulds |first2 = Trudi |last2 = Craggs |first3 = John |last3 = Saunders |name-list-style = amp |url = http://uk.practicallaw.com/books/9781845927806/chapter04 |title = Chapter&amp;nbsp;4: The Definition of a Road? |work = Scottish Roads Law |edition = 2nd |publisher = Practical Law Company |date = 31 January 2008 |accessdate = 21 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but remains in common law.

=== United States ===
In American law, the word &quot;highway&quot; is sometimes used to denote any public way used for travel, whether a &quot;road, street, and parkway&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;23 U.S. Code § 101 (a)-(11)&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title = 23 US Code § 101 |url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/23/101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in practical and useful meaning, a &quot;highway&quot; is a major and significant, well-constructed road that is capable of carrying reasonably heavy to extremely heavy traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/highway|title=Definition of HIGHWAY|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Highways generally have a route number designated by the state and federal departments of transportation.{{Clarify|date=July 2010}}

California Vehicle Code, Sections 360, 590, define a &quot;highway&quot; as only a way open for use of motor vehicles, but the California Supreme Court has held that &quot;the definition of 'highway' in the Vehicle Code is used for special purposes of that act,&quot; and that canals of the Los Angeles neighborhood of [[Venice, California]], are &quot;highways&quot; that are entitled to be maintained with state highway funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/2d/3/184.html |title = City of Long Beach v. Payne |newspaper = Justia Law |access-date = 14 February 2017 |language = en }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller roads may be termed [[Byway (road)|byways]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/highways+and+byways |title = highways and byways |work = The free dictionary |accessdate = 21 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{see also|Road|History of road transport}}Modern highway systems developed in the 20th century as the [[automobile]] gained popularity. The world's first [[limited access road]] was constructed on Long Island New York in the United States known as the [[Long Island Motor Parkway]] or the Vanderbilt Motor Parkway.  It was completed in 1911.&lt;ref name=&quot;Autobahnhistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://german.about.com/library/blgermyth08_autobt.htm |title = An Autobahn Timeline |publisher = About.com |accessdate = 10 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy the Milano-Varese {{convert|49|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} autostrada was opened in 1924.

Construction of the Bonn–Cologne [[autobahn]] began in 1929 and it was opened in 1932 by the mayor of [[Transport in Cologne|Cologne]], [[Konrad Adenauer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://german.about.com/library/blgermyth08.htm |title = German Myth 8 Hitler and the Autobahn |publisher = About.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 (Phipps Act)]] enacted a fund to create an extensive highway system. In 1922, the first blueprint for a national highway system (the [[Pershing Map]]) was published. The [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]] allocated $25 billion for the construction of the {{convert|41000|mi|km|adj=mid|-long|order=flip}} [[Interstate Highway System]] over a 20-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/interstate/history.htm |title = History of the Interstate Highway System |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |accessdate = 10 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Great Britain]], the [[Special Roads Act 1949]] provided the legislative basis for roads for restricted classes of vehicles and non-standard or no speed limits applied (later mostly termed [[motorway]]s but now with speed limits not exceeding 70&amp;nbsp;mph);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1949/pdf/ukpga_19490032_en.pdf |title = Special Roads Act 1949 |work = Office of Public Sector Information }}&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of general road law this legislation overturned the usual principle that a road available to vehicular traffic was also available to horse or pedestrian traffic as is usually the only practical change when non-motorways are reclassified as ''special roads''. The first section of motorway in the UK opened in 1958 (part of the M6 motorway) and then in 1959 the first section of the [[M1 motorway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ciht.org.uk/motorway/m1m10m45.htm |title = M1 London: Yorkshire Motorway, M10 and M45 |work = Motorway Archives |accessdate = 10 April 2010 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100416080957/http://www.ciht.org.uk/motorway/m1m10m45.htm |archivedate = 16 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social effects ==

Reducing travel times relative to city or town streets, modern highways with limited access and grade separation create increased opportunities for people to travel for business, trade or pleasure and also provide trade routes for goods. Modern highways reduce commute and other travel time but additional road capacity can also release [[induced demand|latent traffic demand]]. If not accurately predicted at the planning stage, this extra traffic may lead to the new road becoming congested sooner than would otherwise be anticipated by considering increases in vehicle ownership. More roads allow drivers to use their cars when otherwise alternatives may have been sought, or the journey may not have been made, which can mean that a new road brings only short-term mitigation of traffic congestion.

Where highways are created through existing communities, there can be reduced [[community cohesion]] and more difficult local access. Consequently, property values have decreased in many cutoff neighborhoods, leading to decreased housing quality over time.

== Economic effects ==
{{main|Transport economics}}

In transport, [[Demand (economics)|demand]] can be measured in numbers of journeys made or in total distance travelled across all journeys (e.g. [[passenger-kilometre]]s for [[public transport]] or vehicle-kilometres of travel (VKT) for [[private transport]]). [[Supply (economics)|Supply]] is considered to be a measure of capacity. The [[price]] of the good (travel) is measured using the [[generalised cost]] of travel, which includes both [[money]] and [[time]] expenditure.
[[File:Leipzig-Halle Airport Condor.jpg|thumb|right|A taxiway crossing the [[Autobahn]], near Leipzig|159x159px]]

The effect of increases in supply (capacity) are of particular interest in transport economics (see [[induced demand]]), as the potential environmental consequences are significant (see ''externalities'' below).

In addition to providing benefits to their users, transport networks impose both [[positive externalities|positive]] and [[negative externalities]] on non-users. The consideration of these externalities—particularly the negative ones—is a part of transport economics. Positive externalities of transport networks may include the ability to provide [[emergency services]], increases in [[land (economics)|land]] value and [[economies of agglomeration|agglomeration benefits]]. Negative externalities are wide-ranging and may include local [[air pollution]], [[noise pollution]], [[light pollution]], [[traffic safety|safety hazards]], [[community severance]] and [[traffic congestion|congestion]]. The contribution of transport systems to potentially hazardous [[climate change]] is a significant negative externality which is difficult to evaluate quantitatively, making it difficult (but not impossible) to include in transport economics-based research and analysis. Congestion is considered a negative [[externality]] by economists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last = Small |first = Kenneth A. |first2 = José A. |last2 = Gomez-Ibañez |name-list-style = amp |year = 1998 |title = Road Pricing for Congestion Management: The Transition from Theory to Policy |publisher = The University of California Transportation Center, University of California at Berkeley |page = 213 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 study finds that for the United States &quot;a 10% increase in a region's stock of highways causes a 1.7% increase in regional patenting over a five-year period.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Roads and Innovation |journal = The Review of Economics and Statistics |volume = 99 |issue = 3 |pages = 417–434 |doi = 10.1162/REST_a_00619 |year = 2017 |last1 = Agrawal |first1 = Ajay |last2 = Galasso |first2 = Alberto |last3 = Oettl |first3 = Alexander }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental effects ==
[[File:Highway 401 by 401-DVP.jpg|thumb|Noise, light and air pollution are negative environmental effects highways can have on their surroundings.]]
{{main|Environmental impacts of roads}}

Highways are extended [[line source|linear sources]] of [[pollution]].

[[Roadway noise]] increases with operating speed so major highways generate more noise than [[arterial road|arterial]] streets. Therefore, considerable [[noise health effects]] are expected from highway systems. [[Noise mitigation]] strategies exist to reduce sound levels at nearby [[sensitive receptors]]. The idea that highway design could be influenced by [[acoustical engineering]] considerations first arose about 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = John |last = Shadely |title = Acoustical analysis of the New Jersey Turnpike widening project between Raritan and East Brunswick |publisher = Bolt Beranek and Newman |year = 1973 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first = Michael |last = Hogan |title = Highway Noise |conference = 3rd Environmental Pollution Symposium, sponsored by AIAA, ACS, ASME, SAE |publisher = [[SRI International]] |location = Menlo Park, CA |date = 17–18 April 1973 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Air quality]] issues: Highways may contribute fewer [[air pollutant|emissions]] than arterials carrying the same vehicle volumes. This is because high, constant-speed operation creates an emissions reduction compared to vehicular flows with stops and starts. However, concentrations of air pollutants near highways may be higher due to increased traffic volumes. Therefore, the risk of exposure to elevated levels of air pollutants from a highway may be considerable, and further magnified when highways have [[traffic congestion]].

New highways can also cause [[habitat fragmentation]], encourage [[urban sprawl]] and allow human intrusion into previously untouched areas, as well as (counterintuitively) increasing congestion, by increasing the number of intersections.

They can also reduce the use of [[public transport]], indirectly leading to greater pollution.

===1960s===
On February 11, 1961, excavation began, and that September 1, Saarinen died. On February 12, 1963, the first stainless steel triangle that formed the first section of the arch was set in place on the south leg.

On October 28, 1965, it was completed, costing approximately $15 million to build. The adjacent park was designed by landscape architect [[Dan Kiley]]. Along with all other historical areas of the National Park Service, the memorial was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on October 15, 1966. [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Hubert Humphrey]] and [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] [[Stewart Udall]] dedicated the arch on May 25, 1968.

===1980s===
In 1984, Congress authorized the enlargement of the Memorial to include up to {{convert|100|acre|ha}} on the east bank of the Mississippi River in [[East St. Louis, Illinois]]. Funds were authorized to begin land acquisition, but Congress placed a moratorium upon NPS land acquisitions in fiscal year 1998. The moratorium continued into the 21st century, with expansion becoming less likely because of the construction of a [[Riverboat casino|riverboat gambling facility]] and related amenities.

===1990s===
During the [[Great Flood of 1993]], Mississippi flood waters reached halfway up the Grand Staircase on the east.

In 1999, the arch tram queue areas were renovated at a cost of about $2.2 million. As well, the [[Ulysses S. Grant National Historic Site]] in [[St. Louis County, Missouri]], was put under the jurisdiction of the Superintendent of the Memorial.

===2000s===
[[Image:Missouri quarter, reverse side, 2003.jpg|thumb|The Missouri state quarter depicting the Gateway Arch and the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]]]]
The arch was featured on the Missouri state quarter in 2003.

In 2007 St. Louis Mayor [[Francis Slay]] and former Missouri Senator [[John Danforth]] asked the National Park Service to create a more &quot;active&quot; use of the grounds of the memorial and model it on [[Millennium Park]] in [[Chicago]] including the possibility of restaurants, fountains, ice skating, swimming, and other activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.semissourian.com/story/1250042.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628124857/http://www.semissourian.com/story/1250042.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 28, 2018 |title=St. Louis hopes to obtain part of Arch grounds | last=Salter |first=Jim |work=[[Southeast Missourian]] |date=August 29, 2007 |access-date=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Park Service was not in favor of the plan noting that the only other overt development pressure on national park property has been at the [[Jackson Hole Airport]] in [[Grand Teton National Park]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/stlouiscitycounty/story/10DA9EE598C17FAD86257345007A63F0?OpenDocument |title= City Leaders Pitch Local Control of Arch Grounds |work= St. Louis Post Dispatch |date= August 29, 2007 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080131214652/http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/stlouiscitycounty/story/10DA9EE598C17FAD86257345007A63F0?OpenDocument |archive-date= January 31, 2008 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
For most of its life, the Memorial was largely separated from the rest of [[Downtown St. Louis]] by a sunken section of [[I-70]] (now I-44 with the rerouting of I-70 over a new bridge), but in 2014, a lid was installed over the highway, creating the foundation for a park connecting downtown with the Memorial grounds. In November 2015, Saarinen's original master plan was brought to fruition. Building of the Gateway Arch Connector linking the Old Courthouse with the grounds of the arch was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Bomar |first= Mary A. |author-link= Mary A.

There are now a total of 4,200.

The $380 million project was funded both privately and publicly. The public funding, provided largely by Proposition P, totaled $159 million. The remaining $221 million were secured via fundraising efforts of Gateway Arch Park foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/planners-hit-fundraising-goal-arch-grounds-renovation#stream/0|title=Planners hit fundraising goal for Arch grounds renovation|last=Moffitt|first=Kelly|access-date=2017-06-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Congress approved the Gateway Arch National Park Designation Act in early 2018 to re-designate Jefferson National Expansion Memorial as Gateway Arch National Park. U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] signed the act into law on February 22, 2018.&lt;ref name=&quot;WhiteHouse&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-signs-s-1438-law/ |title=President Donald J.

[[File:Square of opposition, set diagrams.svg|thumb|Square of opposition&lt;br&gt;In the [[Venn diagram]]s black areas are [[empty set|empty]] and red areas are nonempty.&lt;br&gt;The faded arrows and faded red areas apply in traditional logic.]]
'''[[Boolean logic]]''' is a system of [[syllogism|syllogistic]] [[logic]] invented by 19th-century British mathematician [[George Boole]], which attempts to incorporate the &quot;empty set&quot;, that is, a class of non-existent entities, such as round squares, without resorting to uncertain [[truth value]]s.

In Boolean logic, the universal statements &quot;all S is P&quot; and &quot;no S is P&quot; (contraries in the traditional Aristotelian schema) are compossible provided that the set of &quot;S&quot; is the empty set.  &quot;All S is P&quot; is construed to mean that &quot;there is nothing that is both S and not-P&quot;; &quot;no S is P&quot;, that &quot;there is nothing that is both S and P&quot;.  For example, since there is nothing that is a round square, it is true both that nothing is a round square and purple, and that nothing is a round square and ''not''-purple.  Therefore, both universal statements, that &quot;all round squares are purple&quot; and &quot;no round squares are purple&quot; are true.

Similarly, the [[subcontrary]] relationship is dissolved between the existential statements &quot;some S is P&quot; and &quot;some S is not P&quot;.  The former is interpreted as &quot;there is some S such that S is P&quot; and the latter, &quot;there is some S such that S is not P&quot;, both of which are clearly false where S is nonexistent.

Thus, the subaltern relationship between universal and existential also does not hold, since for a nonexistent S, &quot;All S is P&quot; is true but does not entail &quot;Some S is P&quot;, which is false.  Of the Aristotelian [[square of opposition]], only the contradictory relationships remain intact.

      <text bytes="6201" xml:space="preserve">{{short description|Two regions of Ancient Egypt}} 
In [[History of ancient Egypt|Egyptian history]], the '''Upper and Lower Egypt''' period (also known as '''the Two Lands''') was the final stage of [[prehistoric Egypt]] and directly preceded the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|unification of the realm]]. The conception of Egypt as the Two Lands was an example of the dualism in ancient Egyptian culture and frequently appeared in texts and imagery, including in the titles of Egyptian [[pharaoh]]s.

The O ''[[wikt:zmꜣ#Egyptian|zmꜣ]]-[[wikt:tꜣwj#Egyptian|tꜣwj]]'' ([[Egyptological pronunciation]] ''sema-tawy'') is usually translated as &quot;Uniter of the Two Lands&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald J. Leprohon, The Great Name: Ancient Egyptian Royal Titulary, Society of Biblical Lit, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and was depicted as a human [[trachea]] entwined with the papyrus and lily plant. The trachea stood for unification, while the papyrus and lily plant represent Lower and Upper Egypt.

Standard titles of the [[pharaoh]] included the [[prenomen (Ancient Egypt)|prenomen]], quite literally &quot;Of the [[Cyperaceae|Sedge]] and Bee&quot; ([[wikt:nswt-bjtj|nswt-bjtj]], the symbols of Upper and Lower Egypt)&lt;ref&gt;Abeer El-Shahawy, Farid S. Atiya, The Egyptian Museum in Cairo, American Univ in Cairo Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;lord of the Two Lands&quot; (written ''[[wikt:nb-tꜣwj|nb-tꜣwj]]''). [[Queens regnant]] were addressed as pharaohs and male. [[Queens consort]] might use a feminine versions of the second title, &quot;lady of The Two Lands&quot; (''nbt-tꜣwj''), mistress of the Entire Two Lands (''hnwt-tꜣwy-tm''), and mistress of the Two Lands (''hnwt-tꜣwy'').&lt;ref&gt;Grajetzki, Ancient Egyptian Queens: A Hieroglyphic Dictionary, Golden House Publications, London, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0954721893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
[[Image:Double crown.svg|thumb|upright|''[[Pschent]]'', the double crown of Egypt]]
[[Ancient Egypt]] was divided into two regions, namely [[Upper Egypt]] and [[Lower Egypt]]. To the north was Lower Egypt, where the [[Nile]] stretched out with its several branches to form the [[Nile Delta]]. To the south was Upper Egypt, stretching to [[Aswan]]. The terminology [[wikt:upriver|&quot;Upper&quot;]] and [[wikt:downriver|&quot;Lower&quot;]] derives from the flow of the [[Nile]] from the highlands of [[East Africa]] northwards to the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

The two kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt were united c. 3000 BC, but each maintained its own regalia: the ''[[hedjet]]'' or White Crown for Upper Egypt and the ''[[deshret]]'' or Red Crown for Lower Egypt. Thus, the [[pharaoh]]s were known as the rulers of the Two Lands, and wore the ''[[pschent]]'', a double crown, each half representing sovereignty of one of the kingdoms. Ancient Egyptian tradition credited [[Menes]], now believed to be the same as [[Narmer]], as the king who united Upper and Lower Egypt. On the [[Narmer Palette]] the king is depicted wearing the Red Crown in one scene and the White crown in another, and thereby showing his rule over both Lands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wengrow&quot;/&gt;

==Sema Tawy and symbolism==
[[File:Abu Simbel 0219.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Hapi (Nile god)|Hapi]] tying the papyrus and reed plants in the ''sema tawy'' symbol for the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt]]
The union of Upper and Lower Egypt is depicted by knotted papyrus and reed plants. The binding motif represents both harmony through linkage and domination through containment. The duality is an important part of royal iconography. Sometimes the duality is further extended by having the knotted plants extend and bind foreign foes (both from the North and the South) as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wengrow&quot;&gt;[[Wengrow, David]], The Archaeology of Early Egypt: Social transformations in North-East Africa, 10,000 to 2650 B.C., Cambridge University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first dynasty dualistic royal titles emerge, including the King of Upper and Lower Egypt ( ''[[wikt:nswt#Egyptian|nswt]] [[wikt:bjtj#Egyptian|bjtj]]'') title which combines the plant representing Upper Egypt and a bee representing Lower Egypt. The other dualistic title is the [[ancient Egyptian royal titulary#Nebty (&quot;two ladies&quot;) name|Two Ladies name]] or Nebty name. The two ladies as [[Nekhbet]], the [[vulture]] goddess associated with [[Nekhen]] in Upper Egypt, and [[Wadjet]], the [[cobra]] goddess associated with [[Buto]] in Lower Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wengrow&quot;/&gt;

There are many depictions of the ritual unifications of the Two Lands. It is not known if this was perhaps a rite that would have been enacted at the beginning of a reign, or merely a symbolic representation. Many of the depictions of the unification show two gods binding the plants. Often the gods are [[Horus]] and [[Set (deity)|Set]], or on occasion Horus and [[Thoth]]. There are several examples of Barque stands from the reigns of [[Amenhotep III]] ([[Hermopolis]]), [[Taharqa]] ([[Jebel Barkal]]), and [[Atlanersa]] (Jebel Barkal) that show two river gods performing the rite. This matches a scene from the Temple at [[Abu Simbel]] from the time of [[Ramesses II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Merzeban&quot;&gt;Rania Y. Merzeban, Unusual sm3 t3wy Scenes in Egyptian Temples, Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt, Vol. 44 (2008), pp. 41-71&lt;/ref&gt;

There are only a handful of scenes that show the King himself performing the ritual. All of these are from barque stands and date to the reigns of [[Amenhotep III]], [[Seti I]] and [[Ramesses III]]. The latter two may be copies of the first one.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merzeban&quot;/&gt;

The '''Osiris myth''' is the most elaborate and influential story in [[ancient Egyptian mythology]]. It concerns the murder of the [[ancient Egyptian deities|god]] [[Osiris]], a primeval [[pharaoh|king of Egypt]], and its consequences. Osiris's murderer, his brother [[Set (deity)|Set]], usurps his throne. Meanwhile, Osiris's wife [[Isis]] restores her husband's body, allowing him to posthumously conceive their son, [[Horus]]. The remainder of the story focuses on Horus, the product of the union of Isis and Osiris, who is at first a vulnerable child protected by his mother and then becomes Set's rival for the throne. Their often violent conflict ends with Horus's triumph, which restores [[Maat]] (cosmic and social order) to Egypt after Set's unrighteous reign and completes the process of Osiris's resurrection.

The myth, with its complex symbolism, is integral to ancient Egyptian conceptions of kingship and [[order of succession|succession]], conflict between order and disorder, and especially death and the [[ancient Egyptian afterlife beliefs|afterlife]]. It also expresses the essential character of each of the four deities at its center, and many elements of their worship in [[ancient Egyptian religion]] were derived from the myth.

The Osiris myth reached its basic form in or before the 24th century BCE. Many of its elements originated in religious ideas, but the struggle between Horus and Set may have been partly inspired by a regional conflict in Egypt's [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic]] or [[Prehistoric Egypt]]. Scholars have tried to discern the exact nature of the events that gave rise to the story, but they have reached no definitive conclusions.

Parts of the myth appear in a wide variety of [[Ancient Egyptian literature|Egyptian texts]], from [[Ancient Egyptian funerary texts|funerary texts]] and magical spells to short stories. The story is, therefore, more detailed and more cohesive than any other ancient Egyptian myth. Yet no Egyptian source gives a full account of the myth, and the sources vary widely in their versions of events. [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] writings, particularly ''[[On Isis and Osiris]]'' by [[Plutarch]], provide more information but may not always accurately reflect Egyptian beliefs. Through these writings, the Osiris myth persisted after knowledge of most ancient Egyptian beliefs was lost, and it is still well known today.

==Sources==
The myth of Osiris was deeply influential in [[ancient Egyptian religion]] and was popular among ordinary people.{{sfn|Assmann|2001|p=124}} One reason for this popularity is the myth's primary religious meaning, which implies that any dead person can reach a pleasant afterlife.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=2}} Another reason is that the characters and their emotions are more reminiscent of the lives of real people than those in most Egyptian myths, making the story more appealing to the general populace.{{sfn|O'Connor|2009|pp=37–40}} In particular, the myth conveys a &quot;strong sense of family loyalty and devotion&quot;, as the Egyptologist [[J. Gwyn Griffiths]] put it, in the relationships between Osiris, Isis, and Horus.{{sfn|Griffiths|1970|pp=344–345}}

With this widespread appeal, the myth appears in more ancient texts than any other myth and in an exceptionally broad range of [[Ancient Egyptian literature|Egyptian literary styles]].{{sfn|Assmann|2001|p=124}} These sources also provide an unusual amount of detail.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=2}} Ancient Egyptian myths are fragmentary and vague; the religious metaphors contained within the myths were more important than coherent narration.{{sfn|Tobin|1989|pp=21–25}} Each text that contains a myth, or a fragment of one, may adapt the myth to suit its particular purposes, so different texts can contain contradictory versions of events.{{sfn|Goebs|2002|pp=38–45}} Because the Osiris myth was used in such a variety of ways, versions often conflict with each other. Nevertheless, the fragmentary versions, taken together, give it a greater resemblance to a cohesive story than most Egyptian myths.{{sfn|Tobin|1989|pp=22–23, 104}}

[[File:Pyramid text Teti.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=Wall covered with columns of carved hieroglyphic text|The Pyramid Texts in the [[Pyramid of Teti]]]]
The earliest mentions of the Osiris myth are in the [[Pyramid Texts]], the first [[ancient Egyptian funerary texts|Egyptian funerary texts]], which appeared on the walls of burial chambers in [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]] at the end of the [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Fifth Dynasty]], during the 24th century BCE. These texts, made up of disparate [[Spell (paranormal)|spells]] or &quot;utterances&quot;, contain ideas that are presumed to date from still earlier times.{{sfn|David|2002|pp=92–94}} The texts are concerned with the afterlife of the [[pharaoh|king]] buried in the pyramid, so they frequently refer to the Osiris myth, which is deeply involved with kingship and the afterlife.{{sfn|Griffiths|1980|pp=7–8, 41}} Major elements of the story, such as the death and restoration of [[Osiris]] and the strife between [[Horus]] and [[Set (mythology)|Set]], appear in the utterances of the Pyramid Texts.{{sfn|Griffiths|1960|pp=1, 4–7}} Funerary texts written in later times, such as the [[Coffin Texts]] from the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (c. 2055–1650 BCE) and the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' from the [[New Kingdom]] (c. 1550–1070 BCE), also contain elements of the myth.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|pp=15, 78}}

Other types of religious texts give evidence for the myth, such as two Middle Kingdom texts: the [[Dramatic Ramesseum Papyrus]] and the [[Ikhernofret Stela]]. The papyrus describes the coronation of [[Senusret I]], whereas the stela alludes to events in the annual festival of Khoiak. Rituals in both these festivals reenacted elements of the Osiris myth.{{sfn|Griffiths|1980|pp=107, 233–234}} The most complete ancient Egyptian account of the myth is the Great Hymn to Osiris, an inscription from the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] (c. 1550–1292 BCE) that gives the general outline of the entire story but includes little detail.{{sfn|Lichtheim|2006b|pp=81–85}} Another important source is the [[Memphite Theology]], a religious narrative that includes an account of Osiris's death as well as the resolution of the dispute between Horus and Set. This narrative associates the kingship that Osiris and Horus represent with [[Ptah]], the [[creator deity]] of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]].{{sfn|Lichtheim|2006a|pp=51–57}} The text was long thought to date back to the [[Old Kingdom]] (c. 2686–2181 BCE) and was treated as a source for information about the early stages in the development of the myth. Since the 1970s, however, Egyptologists have concluded that the text dates to the New Kingdom at the earliest.{{sfn|David|2002|p=86}}

Rituals in honor of Osiris are another major source of information. Some of these texts are found on the walls of [[Egyptian temple|temples]] that date from the New Kingdom, the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] era (323–30 BCE), or the Roman era (30 BCE to the fourth century AD).{{sfn|David|2002|p=156}} Some of these late ritual texts, in which Isis and Nephthys lament their brother's death, were adapted into funerary texts. In these texts, the goddesses' pleas were meant to rouse Osiris—and thus the deceased person—to live again.{{sfn|Smith|2009|pp=54–55, 61–62}}

Magical healing spells, which were used by Egyptians of all classes, are the source for an important portion of the myth, in which Horus is poisoned or otherwise sickened, and Isis heals him. The spells identify a sick person with Horus so that he or she can benefit from the goddess's efforts. The spells are known from papyrus copies, which serve as instructions for healing rituals, and from a specialized type of inscribed stone [[stela]] called a ''[[cippus]]''. People seeking healing poured water over these cippi, an act that was believed to imbue the water with the healing power contained in the text, and then drank the water in hope of curing their ailments. The theme of an endangered child protected by magic also appears on inscribed ritual wands from the Middle Kingdom, which were made centuries before the more detailed healing spells that specifically connect this theme with the Osiris myth.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|pp=18, 29, 39}}

Episodes from the myth were also recorded in writings that may have been intended as entertainment. Prominent among these texts is &quot;[[The Contendings of Horus and Set]]&quot;, a humorous retelling of several episodes of the struggle between the two deities, which dates to the [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]] (c. 1190–1070 BCE).{{sfn|Lichtheim|2006b|pp=197, 214}} It vividly characterizes the deities involved; as the Egyptologist [[Donald B. Redford]] says, &quot;Horus appears as a physically weak but clever Puck-like figure, Seth [Set] as a strong-man buffoon of limited intelligence, Re-Horakhty &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Ra]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; as a prejudiced, sulky judge, and Osiris as an articulate curmudgeon with an acid tongue.&quot;{{sfn|Redford|2001|p=294}} Despite its atypical nature, &quot;Contendings&quot; includes many of the oldest episodes in the divine conflict, and many events appear in the same order as in much later accounts, suggesting that a traditional sequence of events was forming at the time that the story was written.{{sfn|Redford|2001|pp=294–295}}

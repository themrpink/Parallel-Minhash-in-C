The 2009 [[Academy Award]] winner for Best Picture, ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'', was shot using [[Aaton]] Super 16&amp;nbsp;mm cameras and [[Fujifilm]] 16&amp;nbsp;mm film stocks. The cost savings over 35&amp;nbsp;mm allowed the production to utilize multiple cameras for many shots, exposing over 1,000,000 feet of film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/4677-cinematographer-barry-ackroyd-talks-the-hurt-locker-by-scott-macaulay/|title=Cinematographer Barry Ackroyd Discusses Oscar Winner The Hurt Locker &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE --&gt;|last=Macaulay|first=Scott|date=November 14, 2011|work=Filmmaker Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Napoleonic era TV drama ''[[Sharpe (TV series)|Sharpe]]'' was shot on Super 16&amp;nbsp;mm right through to the film ''[[Sharpe's Challenge]]'' (2006). For the last film in the series, ''[[Sharpe's Peril]]'' (2008), the producers switched to 35&amp;nbsp;mm.

''[[Moonrise Kingdom]]'' was shot using super 16&amp;nbsp;mm.

[[Spike Lee]] shot the Netflix film ''[[Da 5 Bloods]]''{{'}} flashback scenes on 16&amp;nbsp;mm film. This is part of the reason cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel is an Oscar contender for his work on the film. ''The Insider'' reports that Netflix &quot;was initially concerned about having the movie's flashback scenes shot on grainy 16&amp;nbsp;mm film ... There was pushback because it opened up a lot of challenges.&quot; According to Sigel, the film stock Lee wanted to use was an expensive one as it is rarely used today. It would be even more expensive to shoot on 16mm film while on location in Vietnam and then ship the film back to the United States to be processed at a film lab. Lee was &quot;pretty adamant&quot; about using 16mm for the flashbacks; Sigel said &quot;I would never have been able to do it without such fervent support from him.&quot; Sigel pitched to Lee an idea to shoot the Vietnam sequences using the kind of camera and film stock that would have been available during the Vietnam era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Sharf|first=Zack|date=2020-06-18|title='Da 5 Bloods' Cinematographer Says Netflix Pushed Back Against Spike Lee Using 16mm Film|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2020/06/spike-lee-battled-netflix-da-5-bloods-16mm-film-1202238666/|access-date=2020-06-19|website=IndieWire|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital 16 mm ===

A number of digital cameras approximate the look of the 16&amp;nbsp;mm format by using 16&amp;nbsp;mm-sized sensors and taking 16&amp;nbsp;mm lenses. These cameras include the Ikonoskop A-Cam DII (2008) and the [[Digital Bolex]] (2012).  The [[Blackmagic Design|Blackmagic]] Pocket Cinema Camera (2013) and the [[Blackmagic Micro Cinema Camera]] (2015) has a Super&amp;nbsp;16-sized sensor. The [[Z CAM]] E2G (2019) even offers Digital 16&amp;nbsp;mm in 4K and with a global shutter.

The professional industry tends to use 16&amp;nbsp;mm cameras from [[Aaton]] and [[Arri]], most notably the Aaton Xtera, Aaton XTRprod, [[Arriflex 16SR#Arriflex 16SR3|Arriflex 16SR3]], and Arriflex 416. Aaton also released the A-Minima, which is about the size of a video camcorder and is used for specialized filming requiring smaller, more versatile cameras. [[Photo Sonics]] have special extremely high speed cameras for 16&amp;nbsp;mm that film at up to 1,000 frames per second. [[Panavision]] has produced the Panaflex 16, nicknamed &quot;Elaine&quot;.

=== Amateur cameras ===

For amateur, hobbyist, and student use, it is more economical to use older models from Arri, Aaton, [[Auricon]], [[Beaulieu (company)|Beaulieu]], [[Bell and Howell]], [[Bolex]], [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], [[CP-16|Cinema Products]], [[Eclair (camera)|Eclair]], [[Keystone Camera Company|Keystone]], [[Krasnogorsk (camera)|Krasnogorsk]], [[Mitchell Camera|Mitchell]], and others.

== Film reproduction methods ==
Most original movie production companies that use film shoot on 35&amp;nbsp;mm. The 35&amp;nbsp;mm size must be converted or reduced to 16&amp;nbsp;mm for 16&amp;nbsp;mm systems. There are multiple ways of obtaining a 16&amp;nbsp;mm print from 35&amp;nbsp;mm.  The preferred method is to strike a 16&amp;nbsp;mm negative from the original 35&amp;nbsp;mm negative and then make a print from the new 16&amp;nbsp;mm negative. A 16&amp;nbsp;mm negative struck from the original 35&amp;nbsp;mm negative is called an ''original''. A new 16&amp;nbsp;mm print made from a print with no negative is called a ''reversal''.
16&amp;nbsp;mm prints can be made from many combinations of size and format, each with a distinct, descriptive name:
* A 16&amp;nbsp;mm negative struck from an original 35&amp;nbsp;mm print is a ''print down''.
* A 16&amp;nbsp;mm negative struck from an original 16&amp;nbsp;mm print that was struck from a 35&amp;nbsp;mm original is a ''dupe down''.
* A 16&amp;nbsp;mm print struck directly from a 16&amp;nbsp;mm print is a ''double dupe''.
* A 16&amp;nbsp;mm print struck directly from a 35&amp;nbsp;mm print is a ''double dupe down''.

Film traders often refer to 16&amp;nbsp;mm prints by the print's production method, i.e., an ''original'', ''reversal'', ''dupe down'', ''double dupe'', or ''double dupe down''.

=== Color fading of old film and color recovery ===
Over time, the cyan, magenta and yellow dyes that form the image in color 16&amp;nbsp;mm film inevitably fade. The rate of deterioration depends on storage conditions and the film type. In the case of [[Kodachrome]] amateur and documentary films and [[Technicolor]] IB (imbibition process) color prints, the dyes are so stable and the deterioration so slow that even prints now over 70 years old typically show no obvious problems.

Unfortunately, dyes in the far more common [[Eastmancolor]] print film and similar products from other manufacturers are notoriously unstable. Prior to the introduction of a longer-lasting &quot;low fade&quot; type in 1979, Eastmancolor prints routinely suffered from easily seen color shift and fading within ten years. The dyes degrade at different rates, with magenta being the longest-lasting, eventually resulting in a pale reddish image with little if any other color discernible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in70mm.com/news/2010/technicolor/index.htm |title=A History of Low Fade Color Print Stocks |publisher=In70mm.com |date=1963-07-11 |access-date=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the process of [[digitizing]] old color films, even badly faded source material can sometimes be restored to full color through digital techniques that amplify the faded dye colors.

'''8&amp;nbsp;mm film''' is a [[Cine film|motion picture]] [[film format]] in which the film strip is eight millimeters wide. It exists in two main versions&amp;nbsp;– the original [[standard 8&amp;nbsp;mm film]], also known as regular 8&amp;nbsp;mm, and [[Super 8 film|Super 8]]. Although both standard 8&amp;nbsp;mm and Super 8 are 8&amp;nbsp;mm wide, Super 8 has a larger image area because of its smaller and more widely spaced perforations.

There are also two other varieties of Super 8 – Single 8&amp;nbsp;mm and Straight-8&amp;nbsp;– that require different cameras, but produce a final film with the same dimensions.

==Standard 8==
{{main|Standard 8&amp;nbsp;mm film}}
The standard 8&amp;nbsp;mm (also known as regular 8) [[film formats|film format]] was developed by the [[Eastman Kodak]] company during the [[Great Depression]] and released to the market in 1932 to create a [[home movies|home movie]] format that was less expensive than 16&amp;nbsp;mm.

Double 8 spools actually contain a [[16 mm film]] with twice as many perforations along each edge as normal 16&amp;nbsp;mm film; on its first pass through the camera, the film is exposed only along half of its width. When the first pass is complete, the operator opens the camera and flips and swaps the spools (the design of the spool hole ensures that the operator does this properly) and the same film is subsequently exposed along its other edge, the edge left unexposed on the first pass. After the film is developed, the processor splits it down the middle, resulting in two lengths of 8&amp;nbsp;mm film, each with a single row of perforations along one edge.  Each frame is half the width and half the height of a 16&amp;nbsp;mm frame, so there are four times the number of frames in a given film area, which is what makes it cost less. Because of the two passes of the film, the format was sometimes called ''Double 8''. The frame size of regular 8&amp;nbsp;mm is 4.8&amp;nbsp;mm × 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm and 1 meter of film contains 264 pictures. Normally Double 8 is filmed at 16 or 18 frames per second.

Common length film spools allowed filming of about 3 to {{frac|4|1|2}} minutes at 12, 15, 16 and 18 frames per second.

[[File:Ciné-Kodak Kodachrome 8mm movie film expired May1946.jpg|thumb|right|Ciné-Kodak Kodachrome 8mm movie film (expired: May 1946).]]

[[Kodak]] ceased sales of standard 8&amp;nbsp;mm film under its own brand in the early 1990s, but continued to manufacture the film, which was sold via independent film stores. Black-and-white 8&amp;nbsp;mm film is still manufactured in the Czech Republic, and several companies buy bulk quantities of 16&amp;nbsp;mm film to make regular 8&amp;nbsp;mm by re-perforating the stock, cutting it into 25 foot (7.6 m) lengths, and collecting it into special standard 8&amp;nbsp;mm spools, which they then sell. Re-perforation requires special equipment. Some specialists also produce Super 8&amp;nbsp;mm film from existing 16&amp;nbsp;mm, or even 35&amp;nbsp;mm film stock.

===Sound===

When Eastman Kodak first conceived the 8&amp;nbsp;mm format, no provision was made for the addition of a sound track. Nevertheless, in the 1960s, projectors appeared on the market that were capable of recording and replaying sound from a magnetic stripe applied to the film after it had been processed. The only part of the film wide enough to accept such a magnetic stripe was the area between the edge and the perforations. A much narrower stripe was sometimes added to the opposite edge so that the film piled up evenly on the spool, but was never used for sound.  The sound to picture separation was the same dimensionally as 16&amp;nbsp;mm film and as that format is 28 frames, that meant that the Double-8 system was 56 frames. The proximity of the sound stripe to the perforations caused some problems in keeping the film in close contact with the sound head. There was never an optical system.

A few sound prints appeared for the use in double 8 projectors.

==Super 8==
{{main|Super 8 film}}
[[File:UniversumUNAM54.JPG|thumb|Revere Model 144 8&amp;nbsp;mm film camera from 1955 at [[Universum (UNAM)|Universum]] museum in Mexico City]]
In 1965, [[Super 8 film|Super-8 film]] was released and was quickly adopted by many amateur film-makers. It featured a better quality image, and was easier to use mainly due to a cartridge-loading system that did not require reloading and rethreading halfway through. Super 8 was often erroneously criticized, since the [[film gate|film gates]] in some cheaper Super 8 cameras were plastic, as was the pressure plate built into the cartridge; the standard 8 cameras had a permanent metal film gate that was regarded as more reliable in keeping the film flat and the image in focus.  In reality, this was not the case.  The plastic pressure plate could be moulded to far tighter tolerances than their metal counterparts could be machined.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

To easily differentiate Super 8 film from Standard 8, projector spools for the former had larger spindle holes.  Therefore, it was not possible to mount a Super 8 spool on a Standard 8 projector, and vice versa.

===Sound===

The Super 8 format was designed from the start to accommodate a sound track (one of the surprisingly few film formats to do so). This track would occupy the area between the edge of the film and the image area. As in the double 8 system, a second stripe was sometimes added between the edge and the perforations. The image to sound distance was much shorter for the Super 8 system at just 18 frames.

At first, the magnetic stripe had to be applied after the film was processed and recorded on a suitable projector. In the 1970s, cameras appeared which were able to record live sound directly onto pre-striped film. This film was loaded into oversize cartridges that provided access for the camera's sound recording head. The camera would also accept non sound cartridges, but silent cameras could not accept sound cartridges. One major advantage of the Super 8 system was that as the camera pressure plate was a part of the cartridge, it could be moulded to the profile of the stripe(s)s on the film.

Projectors also appeared on the market which took advantage of the balance stripe next to the perforations by recording and replaying stereo sound.

Projectors appeared in the late 1970s that featured the ability to play films with an optical soundtrack. The image-sound separation for the optical format was 22 frames. These were never popular in the English speaking world and are consequently very rare in those countries. But they did enjoy some popularity in the Far East and Europe mainly because optical prints were cheaper.

Sound prints in Super 8 were plentiful and considering that they were very expensive by modern-day standards, sold in appreciable quantities. A two-reel print (running approximately 17 minutes) cost around $50, with feature films costing at least $150-plus. A few prints were also released with stereo sound. In Europe, optical prints were also popular and were appreciated for their often superior sound quality. In theory, magnetic prints should have been superior, but Super 8 magnetic prints were often poorly recorded after the picture was processed, due to high-speed, mass production techniques. An optical track, on the other hand, could be printed at the same time as the image and in equivalent quality.

==Single 8==
{{main|Single-8}}

Another version of Super-8 film, [[Single-8]], was produced by [[Fujifilm|Fuji]] in [[Japan]]. Introduced in 1965 as an alternative to the [[Kodak]] [[Super 8 film|Super 8]] format, it had the same final film dimensions, but with a different cassette. Unlike the co-axial design of Super 8, the Single 8 cartridge featured one spool above the other.

'''Bethesda''' is an [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]], [[census-designated place]] in southern [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], [[Maryland]], United States, located just northwest of [[Washington, D.C.]] It takes its name from a local church, the [[Bethesda Meeting House]] (1820, rebuilt 1849), which in turn took its name from [[Jerusalem]]'s [[Pool of Bethesda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/brewerphrase/bethesda|title=Where Are You From? - Credo Reference|work=credoreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Institutes of Health]] main campus and the [[Walter Reed National Military Medical Center]] are in Bethesda, as are a number of corporate and government headquarters.

As an unincorporated community, Bethesda has no official boundaries. The [[United States Census Bureau]] defines a [[census-designated place]] named Bethesda whose center is located at {{Coord|38|59|N|77|7|W|display=inline}}. The [[United States Geological Survey]] has defined Bethesda as an area whose center is at {{Coord|38|58|50|N|77|6|2|W|type:city|display=inline}}, slightly different from the Census Bureau's definition. Other definitions are used by the Bethesda Urban Planning District, the [[United States Postal Service]] (which defines Bethesda to comprise the ZIP Codes 20810, 20811, 20813, 20814, 20815, 20816, and 20817), and other organizations. According to estimates released by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2013, the community had a total population of 63,374. Most of Bethesda's residents are in [[Maryland Legislative District 15]].

==History==
Bethesda is located in a region populated by the [[Piscataway people|Piscataway]] and [[Nacotchtank]] tribes at the time of [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]]. Henry Fleet (1602–1661) was an English fur trader and the first European to travel to the area, which he reached by sailing up the [[Potomac River]]. He stayed with the Piscataway tribe from 1623 to 1627 as both a guest and a prisoner, then returned to England. He spoke of potential riches in fur and gold, and won funding for another American expedition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox Hill&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Bethesda|url=http://foxhillresidences.com/our-community/history-of-bethesda-maryland/|work=Fox Hill Residences|accessdate=October 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tribes living on the land that became Bethesda were forced into reservations and greatly reduced by communicable diseases to which they had no [[Piscataway people#History|immunity]].{{citation needed|date = December 2019}}

Most early settlers in Maryland were tenant farmers who paid their rent in tobacco, and colonists continued to push farther north in search of fertile land. [[Henry Darnall]] (1645–1711) surveyed a {{convert|710|acre|ha|adj=on|abbr=off}} area in 1694 which became the first land grant in Bethesda.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox Hill&quot; /&gt; and tobacco farming was the primary way of life in Bethesda throughout the 1700s. The establishment of [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1790 deprived Montgomery County of its economic center at Georgetown, although the event had little effect on the small farmers throughout Bethesda.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox Hill&quot; /&gt;

Between 1805 and 1821, Bethesda became a rural way station after development of the [[Washington and Rockville Turnpike]], which carried tobacco and other products between [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] and [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]], and north to [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]]. A small settlement grew around a store and tollhouse along the turnpike by 1862 known as &quot;Darcy's Store&quot;, named after the store's owner William E. Darcy. The settlement was renamed in 1871 by postmaster Robert Franck after the Bethesda Meeting House, a Presbyterian church built in 1820. The church burned in 1849 and was rebuilt the same year about {{convert|100|yards|m}} south, and its former location became the Cemetery of the Bethesda Meeting House.&lt;ref name=&quot;Offutt&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Offutt|first=William|author2=Sween, Jane | title = Montgomery County: Centuries of Change | publisher = American Historical Press | year = 1999 | pages = 161–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bethesda did not develop beyond a small crossroads village through the 19th century. It consisted then of a blacksmith shop, a church and school, and a few houses and stores. In 1852, the postmaster general established a post office in Bethesda and appointed Rev. A. R. Smith its first postmaster.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Maryland New Post-Office&quot;. ''The Baltimore Sun''. January 7, 1852. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; A streetcar line was established in 1890 and suburbanization increased in the early 1900s, and Bethesda began to grow in population. Communities that were situated near railroad lines had grown the fastest during the 19th century, but mass production of the automobile ended that dependency and Bethesda planners grew the community with the transportation revolution in mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox Hill&quot; /&gt; This included becoming a key stopping point for the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B &amp; O]] railroad on their [[Georgetown Branch]] line completed around 1910 that ran from [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring]] to [[Georgetown, Maryland|Georgetown]], passing through Bethesda on the way.  The branch had a storage yard there and multiple sidings that served the industries in Bethesda in the early 20th century.  B &amp; O successor [[CSX]] ceased train service on the line in 1985, so the county transformed it into a trail in the rails-to-trails movement.  The tracks were removed in 1994 and the first part of the trail was opened in 1998; it has become the most used rail trail in the United States, averaging over one million users per year.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In Bethesda, railroad track remnants show downtown's former industrial side&quot;, ''The Washington Post'', August 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Subdivisions began to appear on old farmland in the late 19th century, becoming the neighborhoods of Drummond, Woodmont, Edgemoor, and Battery Park. Farther north, several wealthy men made Rockville Pike famous for its mansions. These included [[Brainard W. Parker]] (&quot;Cedarcroft&quot;, 1892), [[James Oyster]] ([[Strathmore (Maryland)|&quot;Strathmore&quot;, 1899]]), [[George E. Hamilton]] (&quot;Hamilton House&quot;, 1904; now the [[Stone Ridge School]]), [[Luke I. Wilson]] (&quot;Tree Tops&quot;, 1926), [[Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor]] (&quot;Wild Acres&quot;, 1928–29), and [[George Freeland Peter]] (&quot;Stone House&quot;, 1930). In 1930, Dr [[Armistead Peter]]'s pioneering manor house &quot;Winona&quot; (1873) became the clubhouse of the Woodmont Country Club on land that is now part of the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) campus. [[Merle Thorpe]]'s mansion &quot;Pook's Hill&quot; (1927, razed 1948) became the home-in-exile of the [[Norwegian Royal Family]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=Offutt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Norway Buys Pooks Hill For Crown Prince's Home&quot;, ''The New York Times'', August 2, 1941, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

World War II and the subsequent expansion of government further fed the rapid growth of Bethesda. Both the [[National Naval Medical Center]] (1940–42) and the NIH complex (1948) were built just to the north of the developing downtown, and this drew government contractors, medical professionals, and other businesses to the area. In recent years, Bethesda has consolidated as the major urban core and employment center of southwestern Montgomery County.&lt;ref name=Offutt/&gt;  This recent growth has been vigorous following the expansion of Metrorail with a station in Bethesda in 1984. Alan Kay built the Bethesda Metro Center over the Red line metro rail which opened up further commercial and residential development in the immediate vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Alan, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/18/AR2010061805432.html &quot;Alan I. Kay, Washington area real estate magnate and philanthropist, dies at 75&quot;], ''The Washington Post'', June 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s, the strict height limits on construction in the District of Columbia led to the development of mid- and high-rise office and residential towers around the Bethesda Metro stop, effectively creating a major urban center.

==Geography==
[[File:Bethesda aerial 2019.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Downtown Bethesda at bottom right, with the [[National Institutes of Health campus]] at upper left and [[Walter Reed National Military Medical Center]] campus to the right]]

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the CDP has a total area of {{convert|13.2|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|13.1|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} (0.38%) is water.

The main commercial corridor that passes through Bethesda is [[Wisconsin Avenue|Maryland Route 355]] (known as Wisconsin Avenue in Bethesda and as Rockville Pike and Hungerford Drive in more northern communities), which, to the north, connects Bethesda with the communities of [[North Bethesda, Maryland|North Bethesda]] and [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]], ending, after several name changes, in [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]]. Toward the South, Rockville Pike becomes Wisconsin Avenue near the [[National Institute of Health|NIH]] Campus and continues beyond Bethesda through [[Chevy Chase, Maryland|Chevy Chase]], [[Friendship Heights, Maryland|Friendship Heights]] and into [[Washington, D.C.]], ending in Georgetown.

The area commonly known as &quot;Downtown Bethesda&quot; is centered at the intersection of Wisconsin Avenue, Old Georgetown Road and East-West Highway. This intersection is approximately two and one-half miles from Washington, DC's western boundary, making Bethesda a close-in suburb of Washington.

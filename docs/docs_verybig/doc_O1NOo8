where ''&amp;theta;'' is the Earth Rotation Angle, ''E''&lt;sub&gt;PREC&lt;/sub&gt; is the accumulated precession, and ''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is equation of the origins, which represents accumulated precession and nutation.{{Sfn|Urban|Seidelmann|2013|pages=78–79}} The calculation of precession and nutation was described in Chapter 6 of Urban &amp; Seidelmann.

As an example, the ''Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2017'' gave the ERA at 0 h 1 January 2017 UT1 as 100° 37′ 12.4365″. The GAST was 6 h 43 m 20.7109 s. For GMST the hour and minute were the same but the second was 21.1060.{{Sfn|Astronomical Almanac|2016|page=B21}}

===Relationship between solar time and sidereal time intervals===
[[File:ConantClock.png|thumb|upright|This [[astronomical clock]] uses dials showing both sidereal and [[solar time]].]]
If a certain interval ''I'' is measured in both mean solar time (UT1) and sidereal time, the numerical value will be greater in sidereal time than in UT1, because sidereal days are shorter than UT1 days. The ratio is:
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\frac{I_\mathrm{mean\,sidereal}}{I_\mathrm{UT1}}=r'=1.002\,737\,909\,350\,795 + 5.9006\times10^{-11}t - 5.9\times10^{-15}t^2&lt;/math&gt;}}

where ''t'' represents the number of Julian centuries elapsed since noon 1 January 2000 [[Terrestrial Time]].{{Sfn|Urban|Seidelmann|2013|page=81}}

==Sidereal days compared to solar days on other planets==
Of the eight solar [[planet]]s, all but [[Venus]] and [[Uranus]] have [[retrograde and prograde motion|prograde]] rotation—that is, they rotate more than once per year in the same direction as they orbit the Sun, so the Sun rises in the east.{{Sfn|Bakich|2000}} Venus and Uranus, however, have [[retrograde motion|retrograde]] rotation. For prograde rotation, the formula relating the lengths of the sidereal and solar days is:
{{block indent|1=number of sidereal days per orbital period = 1 + number of solar days per orbital period}}

or, equivalently:
{{block indent|1=length of solar day = {{sfrac|length of sidereal day|1 − {{sfrac|length of sidereal day|orbital period}}}}.}}

On the other hand, the formula in the case of retrograde rotation is:
{{block indent|1=number of sidereal days per orbital period = −1 + number of solar days per orbital period}}

or, equivalently:
{{block indent|1=length of solar day = {{sfrac|length of sidereal day|1 + {{sfrac|length of sidereal day|orbital period}}}}.}}

All the solar planets more distant from the Sun than Earth are similar to Earth in that, since they experience many rotations per revolution around the Sun, there is only a small difference between the length of the sidereal day and that of the solar day – the ratio of the former to the latter never being less than Earth's ratio of 0.997. But the situation is quite different for [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and Venus. Mercury's sidereal day is about two-thirds of its orbital period, so by the prograde formula its solar day lasts for two revolutions around the Sun – three times as long as its sidereal day. Venus rotates retrograde with a sidereal day lasting about 243.0 Earth days, or about 1.08 times its orbital period of 224.7 Earth days; hence by the retrograde formula its solar day is about 116.8 Earth days, and it has about 1.9 solar days per orbital period.

By convention, rotation periods of planets are given in sidereal terms unless otherwise specified.

In [[astronomy]] and [[celestial navigation]], the '''hour angle''' is one of the coordinates used in the [[equatorial coordinate system]] to give the direction of a point on the [[celestial sphere]]. The hour angle of a point is the angle between two planes: one containing [[axial tilt|Earth's axis]] and the [[zenith]] (the [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]] plane), and the other containing Earth's axis and the given point (the [[hour circle]] passing through the point).

[[File:HourAngle_Observer_en.png|thumb|right|300px|The hour angle is indicated by an orange arrow on the [[celestial equator]] plane. The arrow ends at the [[hour circle]] of an orange dot indicating the [[apparent place]] of an [[astronomical object]] on the [[celestial sphere]].]]

The angle may be expressed as negative east of the [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian plane]] and positive west of the meridian plane, or as positive westward from 0° to 360°. The angle may be measured in degrees or in time, with 24&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt; = 360° exactly.

In [[astronomy]], hour angle is defined as the [[angle|angular distance]] on the [[celestial sphere]] measured westward along the [[celestial equator]] from the [[Meridian (astronomy)|meridian]] to the [[hour circle]] passing through a point.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |author=U.S. Naval Observatory Nautical Almanac Office |editor=P. Kenneth Seidelmann |title=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |publisher=University Science Books |location=[[Mill Valley, California|Mill Valley, CA]] |date=1992 |page=729 |isbn=0-935702-68-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be given in degrees, time, or rotations depending on the application.

In [[celestial navigation]], the convention is to measure in degrees westward from the [[prime meridian]] (Greenwich hour angle, GHA), from the [[meridian (astronomy)|local meridian]] (local hour angle, LHA) or from the [[Equinox (celestial coordinates)|first point of Aries]] (sidereal hour angle, SHA).

The hour angle is paired with the [[declination]] to fully specify the location of a point on the [[celestial sphere]] in the [[equatorial coordinate system]].&lt;ref&gt;''Explanatory Supplement'' (1992), p. 724.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation with the right ascension==
[[File:Hour angle still1.png|thumb|right|300px|As seen from above the [[Earth]]'s [[geographic pole|north pole]], a star's local hour angle (LHA) for an observer near New York (red dot). Also depicted are the star's [[right ascension]] and Greenwich hour angle (GHA), the [[Sidereal time|local mean sidereal time]] (LMST) and [[Sidereal time|Greenwich mean sidereal time]] (GMST). The symbol ʏ identifies the [[equinox|vernal equinox]] direction.&lt;br&gt;Assuming in this example the day of the year is the March equinox so the sun lies in the direction of the grey arrow then this star will rise about midnight. Just after the observer reaches the green arrow dawn comes and overwhelms with light the visibility of the star about six hours before it sets on the western horizon. The Right Ascension of the star is about 18&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;]]

The local hour angle (LHA) of an object in the observer's sky is

:&lt;math&gt;\text{LHA}_{\text{object}} = {\text{LST}} - \alpha_{\text{object}}&lt;/math&gt;

:or

:&lt;math&gt;\text{LHA}_{\text{object}} = {\text{GST}} + \lambda_{\text{observer}} - \alpha_{\text{object}}&lt;/math&gt;

where LHA&lt;sub&gt;object&lt;/sub&gt; is the local hour angle of the object, LST is the [[Sidereal time|local sidereal time]], &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{\text{object}}&lt;/math&gt; is the object's [[right ascension]], GST is [[Sidereal time|Greenwich sidereal time]] and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\text{observer}}&lt;/math&gt; is the observer's [[longitude]] (positive east from the [[prime meridian]]).&lt;ref&gt;

 |ISBN=0-943396-35-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These angles can be measured in time (24 hours to a circle) or in degrees (360 degrees to a circle)—one or the other, not both.

Negative hour angles (-180 &lt; LHA&lt;sub&gt;object&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0) indicate the object is approaching the meridian, positive hour angles (0 &lt; LHA&lt;sub&gt;object&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 180) indicate the object is moving away from the meridian; an hour angle of zero means the object is on the meridian.

==Solar hour angle==

Observing the sun from earth, the '''solar hour angle''' is an expression of time, expressed in angular measurement, usually degrees, from [[solar noon]]. At solar noon the hour angle is 0.000 degree, with the time before solar noon expressed as negative degrees, and the local time after solar noon expressed as positive degrees. For example, at 10:30 AM local apparent time the hour angle is −22.5° (15° per hour times 1.5 hours before noon).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Kreider | first1 = J.

The [[cosine]] of the hour angle (cos(''h'')) is used to calculate the [[solar zenith angle]]. At solar noon, ''h''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.000 so cos(''h'')=1, and before and after solar noon the cos(±&amp;nbsp;''h'') term = the same value for morning (negative hour angle) or afternoon (positive hour angle), i.e. the sun is at the same altitude in the sky at 11:00AM and 1:00PM solar time, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Schowengerdt | first1 = R.

==Sidereal hour angle==
The sidereal hour angle (SHA) of a body on the celestial sphere is its angular distance west of the [[Equinox (celestial coordinates)|vernal equinox]] generally measured in degrees. 

An alternate definition is that SHA of a celestial body is the arc of the Equinoctial or the angle at the celestial pole contained between the celestial meridian of the First point of Aries and that through the body, measured westward from Aries.

The SHA of a star changes slowly, and the SHA of a planet doesn't change very quickly, so SHA is a convenient way to list their positions in an almanac. SHA is often used in [[celestial navigation]] and navigational astronomy.

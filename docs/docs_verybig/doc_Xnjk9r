==Terms in syllogism==
{{Multiple issues|{{Original research section|date=July 2020}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2020}}|section=yes}}
With Aristotle, we may distinguish [[singular term]]s, such as ''Socrates'', and general terms, such as ''Greeks''. Aristotle further distinguished types (a) and (b):

{{Ordered list|terms that could be the subject of predication; and|terms that could be predicated of others by the use of the copula (&quot;is a&quot;).|type=lower-alpha}}

Such a predication is known as a [[Distributive (linguistics)|distributive]], as opposed to non-distributive as in ''Greeks are numerous''. It is clear that Aristotle's syllogism works only for distributive predication, since we cannot reason ''All Greeks are animals, animals are numerous, therefore all Greeks are numerous''. In Aristotle's view singular terms were of type (a), and general terms of type (b). Thus, ''Men'' can be predicated of ''Socrates'' but ''Socrates'' cannot be predicated of anything. Therefore, for a term to be interchangeable—to be either in the subject or predicate position of a proposition in a syllogism—the terms must be general terms, or ''categorical terms'' as they came to be called.  Consequently, the propositions of a syllogism should be categorical propositions (both terms general) and syllogisms that employ only categorical terms came to be called ''categorical syllogisms''.

It is clear that nothing would prevent a singular term occurring in a syllogism—so long as it was always in the subject position—however, such a syllogism, even if valid, is not a categorical syllogism. An example is ''Socrates is a man, all men are mortal, therefore Socrates is mortal.'' Intuitively this is as valid as ''All Greeks are men, all men are mortal therefore all Greeks are mortals''. To argue that its validity can be explained by the theory of syllogism would require that we show that ''Socrates is a man'' is the equivalent of a categorical proposition.  It can be argued ''Socrates is a man'' is equivalent to ''All that are identical to Socrates are men'', so our non-categorical syllogism can be justified by use of the equivalence above and then citing BARBARA.

==Existential import==
{{Multiple issues|{{Original research section|date=July 2020}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2020}}|section=yes}}
If a statement includes a term such that the statement is false if the term has no instances, then the statement is said to have existential import with respect to that term. It is ambiguous whether or not a universal statement of the form ''All A is B'' is to be considered as true, false, or even meaningless if there are no As. If it is considered as false in such cases, then the statement ''All A is B'' has existential import with respect to A.

It is claimed Aristotle's logic system does not cover cases where there are no instances.
Aristotle's goal was to develop &quot;a companion-logic for science.
He relegates fictions, such as mermaids and unicorns, to
the realms of poetry and literature. In his mind, they exist outside the
ambit of science. This is why he leaves no room for such non-existent
entities in his logic.  This is a thoughtful choice, not an inadvertent
omission. Technically, Aristotelian science is a search for definitions,
where a definition is 'a phrase signifying a thing's essence.'...
Because non-existent entities cannot be anything, they do not, in
Aristotle's mind, possess an essence...  This is why he leaves
no place for fictional entities like goat-stags (or unicorns).&quot;
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-log/ |title=Groarke, Louis F., &quot;Aristotle: Logic&quot;, section 7. (Existential Assumptions), Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=2017-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204235013/http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-log/ |archive-date=2017-02-04 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, many logic systems developed since ''do'' consider the case where there may be no instances.

However, medieval logicians were aware of the problem of existential import and maintained that negative propositions do not carry existential import, and that positive propositions with subjects that do not [[supposition theory|supposit]] are false.

The following problems arise:

{{Ordered list|(a) In natural language and normal use, which statements of the forms All A is B, No A is B, Some A is B and Some A is not B have existential import and with respect to which terms?|In the four forms of categorical statements used in syllogism, which statements of the form AaB, AeB, AiB and AoB have existential import and with respect to which terms?|What existential imports must the forms AaB, AeB, AiB and AoB have for the square of opposition to be valid?|What existential imports must the forms AaB, AeB, AiB and AoB have to preserve the validity of the traditionally valid forms of syllogisms?|Are the existential imports required to satisfy (d) above such that the normal uses in natural languages of the forms All A is B, No A is B, Some A is B and Some A is not B are intuitively and fairly reflected by the categorical statements of forms AaB, AeB, AiB and AoB?|type=lower-alpha}}

For example, if it is accepted that AiB is false if there are no As and AaB entails AiB, then AiB has existential import with respect to A, and so does AaB.  Further, if it is accepted that AiB entails BiA, then AiB and AaB have existential import with respect to B as well. Similarly, if AoB is false if there are no As, and AeB entails AoB, and AeB entails BeA (which in turn entails BoA) then both AeB and AoB have existential import with respect to both A and B.  It follows immediately that all universal categorical statements have existential import with respect to both terms.  If AaB and AeB is a fair representation of the use of statements in normal natural language of All A is B and No A is B respectively, then the following example consequences arise:

:&quot;All flying horses are mythical&quot; is false if there are no flying horses.

:If &quot;No men are fire-eating rabbits&quot; is true, then &quot;There are fire-eating rabbits&quot; is true; and so on.

If it is ruled that no universal statement has existential import then the square of opposition fails in several respects (e.g. AaB does not entail AiB) and a number of syllogisms are no longer valid (e.g. BaC,AaB-&gt;AiC).

These problems and paradoxes arise in both natural language statements and statements in syllogism form because of ambiguity, in particular ambiguity with respect to All. If &quot;Fred claims all his books were Pulitzer Prize winners&quot;, is Fred claiming that he wrote any books? If not, then is what he claims true? Suppose Jane says none of her friends are poor; is that true if she has no friends?

The first-order predicate calculus avoids such ambiguity by using formulae that carry no existential import with respect to universal statements. Existential claims must be explicitly stated. Thus, natural language statements—of the forms ''All A is B, No A is B'', ''Some A is B'', and ''Some A is not B''—can be represented in first order predicate calculus in which any existential import with respect to terms A and/or B is either explicit or not made at all. Consequently, the four forms ''AaB, AeB, AiB'', and ''AoB'' can be represented in first order predicate in every combination of existential import—so it can establish which construal, if any, preserves the square of opposition and the validity of the traditionally valid syllogism.  Strawson claims such a construal is possible, but the results are such that, in his view, the answer to question (e) above is ''no''.

On the other hand, in modern [[mathematical logic]], however, statements containing words &quot;all&quot;, &quot;some&quot; and &quot;no&quot;, can be stated in terms of [[set theory]]. If the set of all A's is labeled as s(A) and the set of all B's as s(B), then:
* &quot;All A is B&quot; (AaB) is equivalent to &quot;s(A) is a [[subset]] of s(B)&quot;, or s(A) ⊆ s(B)
* &quot;No A is B&quot; (AeB) is equivalent to &quot;The [[intersection]] of s(A) and s(B) is [[empty set|empty]]&quot;, or &lt;math&gt;s(A) \cap s(B) = \empty&lt;/math&gt;
* &quot;Some A is B&quot; (AiB) is equivalent to &quot;the intersection of s(A) and s(B) is not empty&quot;, or &lt;math&gt;s(A) \cap s(B) \neq \empty&lt;/math&gt;
* &quot;Some A is not B&quot; (AoB) is equivalent to &quot;s(A) is not a subset of s(B)&quot; &lt;!--, or &lt;math&gt;s(A) \nonsubset s(B)&lt;/math&gt;--&gt;

By definition, the [[empty set]] is a subset of all sets. From this it follows that, according to this mathematical convention, if there are no A's, then the statements &quot;All A is B&quot; and &quot;No A is B&quot; are always true whereas the statements &quot;Some A is B&quot; and &quot;Some A is not B&quot; are always false.  This, however, implies that AaB does not entail AiB, and some of the syllogisms mentioned above are not valid when there are no A's.

==Syllogistic fallacies==
{{See also|Syllogistic fallacy}}
People often make mistakes when reasoning syllogistically.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Evans, J. St. B. T (1989).  ''Bias in human reasoning''. London: LEA.&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, from the premises some A are B, some B are C, people tend to come to a definitive conclusion that therefore some A are C.&lt;ref&gt;Khemlani, S., and P. N. Johnson-Laird. 2012. &quot;Theories of the syllogism: A meta-analysis.&quot; ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]'' 138:427–57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chater, N., and M. Oaksford. 1999. &quot;The Probability Heuristics Model of Syllogistic Reasoning.&quot; ''[[Cognitive Psychology (journal)|Cognitive Psychology]]'' 38:191–258.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not follow according to the rules of classical logic. For instance, while some cats (A) are black things (B), and some black things (B) are televisions (C), it does not follow from the parameters that some cats (A) are televisions (C). This is because in the structure of the syllogism invoked (i.e. III-1) the middle term is not distributed in either the major premise or in the minor premise, a pattern called the &quot;fallacy of the undistributed middle&quot;.

Determining the validity of a syllogism involves determining the [[distribution of terms|distribution]] of each term in each statement, meaning whether all members of that term are accounted for.

In simple syllogistic patterns, the fallacies of invalid patterns are:

*[[Fallacy of the undistributed middle|Undistributed middle]]: Neither of the premises accounts for all members of the middle term, which consequently fails to link the major and minor term.
*[[Illicit major|Illicit treatment of the major term]]: The conclusion implicates all members of the major term (P&amp;nbsp;– meaning the proposition is negative); however, the major premise does not account for them all (i.e., P is either an affirmative predicate or a particular subject there).
*[[Illicit minor|Illicit treatment of the minor term]]: Same as above, but for the minor term (S&amp;nbsp;– meaning the proposition is universal) and minor premise (where S is either a particular subject or an affirmative predicate).
*[[Fallacy of exclusive premises|Exclusive premises]]: Both premises are negative, meaning no link is established between the major and minor terms.
*[[Affirmative conclusion from a negative premise]]: If either premise is negative, the conclusion must also be.
*[[Negative conclusion from affirmative premises]]: If both premises are affirmative, the conclusion must also be.

'''Engrish''' is a slang term for the misuse or [[Corruption (linguistics)|corruption]] of the [[English language]] by native speakers of [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and other [[Languages of Asia|Asian languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ziemba|first=Christine N.|title=Translate at your own risk|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/dec/05/entertainment/ca-engrish5|accessdate=13 June 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=December 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term itself relates to [[Japanese speakers learning r and l|Japanese speakers' tendency]] to inadvertently substitute the English phonemes &quot;R&quot; and &quot;L&quot; for one another, a process known as [[lallation]], because, unlike English, the [[Japanese language]] has only one [[liquid consonant]] ([[Romanization of Japanese|traditionally romanized]] with &quot;R&quot;). 

The term ''Engrish'' first appears as a mispronunciation of the word ''English'' in the 1940s, but it was not until the 1980s that it began to be used to as a byname for defective [[Asian English]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lambert&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lambert |first=James |year=2018 |title=A multitude of ‘lishes’: The nomenclature of hybridity |journal=English World-wide |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=12 |doi=10.1075/eww.38.3.04lam }}&lt;/ref&gt; The related term &quot;[[wasei-eigo]]&quot; refers to [[pseudo-anglicism]]s that have entered into everyday Japanese.

While the term may refer to spoken English, it can also describe written English. In Japan, it is common to add English text to items for decorative and fashion purposes. Such text is often added to create a cosmopolitan feeling rather than to be read by native English speakers, and so may often be meaningless or grammatically incorrect.

Engrish can be found in many places, including signs, menus, and advertisements. Terms such as ''Japanglish'', ''Japlish'' or ''Janglish'' are more specific terms for Japanese Engrish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lambert&quot; /&gt;

==Roots of the phenomenon==
There are two contributing factors to Japanese Engrish. Firstly, the two languages have significantly different grammar: [[Japanese language#Sentence structure|Japanese word order]], the frequent omission of [[subject (grammar)|subjects]] in Japanese, the absence of [[article (grammar)|articles]], a near-complete absence of consecutive [[consonant]]s, and [[Japanese speakers learning r and l|difficulties in distinguishing /l/ and /r/]], or /θ/ and /s/ sounds, all contribute to substantial problems using Standard English effectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dougill1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dougill|first=John|title=Japan and English as an alien language|journal=[[English Today]]|year=2008|volume=24|issue=1|pages=18–22|url=http://student.pfmb.uni-mb.si/~mhjurisic/John%20Dougill.pdf|doi=10.1017/S0266078408000059|access-date=2013-05-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317014827/http://student.pfmb.uni-mb.si/~mhjurisic/John%20Dougill.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-17|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Japanese people have tended to score comparatively poorly on international tests of English.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kowner1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kowner |first=Rotem |authorlink=Rotem Kowner |title=Japanese Miscommunication with Foreigners: In Search for Valid Accounts and Effective Remedies |journal=Jahrbuch des Deutschen Instituts für Japanstudien |year=2003 |volume=15 |pages=117–151 |url=http://east-asia.haifa.ac.il/staff/kovner/(16)Kowner2003b.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801044152/http://east-asia.haifa.ac.il/staff/kovner/(16)Kowner2003b.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, English is frequently used in Japan (and elsewhere) for aesthetic rather than functional purposes;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ikeshima1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ikeshima|first=Jayne Hildebrand|title=Some perspectives on the phenomenon of &quot;Engrish&quot;|journal=Keio Journal of International Studies|date=July 2005|volume=15|pages=185–198|url=http://www.u-keiai.ac.jp/issn/menu/ronbun/no15/u050708_ikeshima.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., for Japanese consumption, not for English speakers ''per se'', as a way of appearing &quot;smart, sophisticated and modern&quot;, in much the same way as Japanese and similar writing scripts are used in Western fashion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dougill2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dougill|first=John|title=English as a decorative language|journal=English Today|year=1987|volume=3|issue=4|pages=33–35|doi=10.1017/S0266078400003126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it is claimed that in such decorative English &quot;there is often no attempt to try to get it right, nor do the vast majority of the Japanese population ever attempt to read the English design element in question. There is therefore less emphasis on [[spell checker|spelling]] and grammatical accuracy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Melin1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Melin|first=Tracy|author2=Rey, Nina|title=Emphasizing Foreign Language Use to International Marketing Students: A Situational Exercise That Mimics Real-World Challenges|journal=Global Business Languages|year=2005|volume=10|pages=13–25|url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1121&amp;context=gbl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other suggested roots ==

English is taught in Japanese schools with an emphasis on writing and grammar over speaking. The written word is taught using [[romaji]] (Latin script); however, the correct pronunciation of the romaji letters is not taught. The spoken word is taught using [[katakana]] script. Katakana is a [[syllabary]] like [[hiragana]], but among other uses it is used to write foreign words (not just English, but also French, German, Korean, Chinese, Hindi etc.) In some ways it is analogous to italics in Latin script. Katakana script is used in daily life for many foreign words loaned into Japanese (&quot;[[Gairaigo]]&quot;).

Representing English [[Phoneme|phonemes]] in written Japanese can bring about several difficulties. For example, when representing the English phonemes R and L, one column of characters, more specifically the ラ行 (ra-gyō) is used. Since the ラ行 (ra-gyō) represents the same Japanese phoneme, there is made no distinction between R and L if used for representing English phonemes. For example, when teaching English pronunciation to Japanese students.  Furthermore, as katakana is a [[syllabary]] and not an alphabet, it isn't ideal for representing CVC (consonant-vowel-consonant) words or words that contain consonant clusters not present in the Japanese language. For example, the English word &quot;start&quot; used when referring to a race, is written in katakana as スタート (su-tā-to). The restrictions of using katakana to represent English phonemes could contribute to the adoption of &quot;Engrish&quot; like pronunciation when speaking English. The answer to this could be to teach spoken English using the Latin alphabet to teach English phonemes. Many Japanese people know how to write English very well, but are not confident speakers possibly due to this issue. It is common to receive a perfectly well-composed e-mail in English from a Japanese person, only to find that in person they will not attempt to speak English, preferring to apologise that they cannot speak, only write English.

==In popular culture==
[[File:Extra Dope Wear Select Shop Ill Store Kyoto.jpg|thumb|A shop front in Kyoto.]]

Instances of Engrish due to poor translation were frequently found in many early video games produced in Japan, often due to the creators not having enough (or not wanting to spend enough) money for proper translations.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} One well-known example of Engrish in pop culture is the translation of the video game ''[[Zero Wing]]'' which gave birth to the phenomenon [[All your base are belong to us]], which also became an [[Internet meme]]. This phenomenon is parodied in ''[[Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'',{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} in which the character [[Fawful]] extensively uses Engrish in his dialogue. In the Japanese version of ''[[Mario &amp; Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story]]'' (in which Fawful also appears as the main antagonist), in the same subseries, the character Broque Monsieur also speaks Engrish.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Engrish has been featured occasionally in the [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] cartoon ''[[South Park]]'', such as the song &quot;Let's Fighting Love&quot;, used in the episode &quot;[[Good Times with Weapons]]&quot;, which parodies the poorly translated opening theme sequences sometimes shown in [[anime]], and in Parker and Stone's feature length ''[[Team America: World Police]]'' where the North Korean leader [[Kim Jong Il]] is depicted singing the song &quot;I'm so Ronery&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WP South Park&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Stuever|first=Hank|title=Puppet Government 'South Park' Creators' Left Jab at Jingoism May Backfire|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A34313-2004Oct15.html|accessdate=16 September 2011|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=October 15, 2004|quote=The North Korean dictator speaks in the voice of &quot;South Park's&quot; Eric Cartman, ... only with an Engrish accent. &quot;I'm so ronery,&quot; Kim confesses in a pitiful ballad to himself, which explains his evil-doing -- he just needs to be ruvved.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British fashion brand [[Superdry]], which takes inspiration from Japanese clothing styles, has established a style of placing meaningless Japanese text such as 'Sunglasses company' and 'membership certificate' on clothing sold in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superdry|url=http://www.unmissablejapan.com/etcetera/superdry|website=Unmissable Japan|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company explained to a Japanese television news programme that most translations were done using simple automatic translation programs such as [[Yahoo! Babel Fish|Babelfish]], without attempting to make the texts accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superdry: Popular UK Fashion Brand Uses Gibberish Japanese|url=http://www.japanprobe.com/2011/10/16/superdry-popular-uk-fashion-brand-uses-gibberish-japanese/|website=Japan Probe|accessdate=1 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006103018/http://www.japanprobe.com/2011/10/16/superdry-popular-uk-fashion-brand-uses-gibberish-japanese/|archive-date=6 October 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' featured a parody of the drama series ''[[Elizabeth R]]'', where they portrayed the cast riding motor-scooters and speaking Engrish, thus changing the title to &quot;Erizabeth L&quot;.

In the 1983 film ''[[A Christmas Story]]'', the Parker family goes to a Chinese restaurant for their Christmas dinner, and are serenaded by the waitstaff with Engrish Christmas carols, such as &quot;[[Deck the Halls|Deck the harrs]] wis boughs of horry, fa ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra&quot; and &quot;[[Jingle Bells|Jingre berrs]], jingre berrs, jingre arr the way, oh what fun it is to ride in one-horse open sreigh!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;StarWalker13 (April 26, 2009). {{YouTube | xTq20prt0K8 | &quot;A Christmas Story Chinese Restaurant Scene&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Western release of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] video game ''[[Ghostbusters (1984 video game)|Ghostbusters]]'' (1986), players who defeat the end boss are rewarded with this message: ''&quot;Conglaturation!!! You have completed a great game. And prooved [sic] the justice of our culture. Now go and rest our heroes!&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=NES Longplay [324] Ghostbusters|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy4yKNqKVos|language=en|access-date=2019-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The misspelling, conglaturation, is often used as sarcasm toward someone who tries to succeed, but ends up failing miserably. A similar typo is seen at the end of ''[[Ghosts 'n Goblins (video game)|Ghosts 'n Goblins]]'' (1986) on the NES/Famicom, where it reads, ''&quot;Congraturation. This story is happy end. Thank you.&quot;'' In a similar vein, the [[Hudson Soft]] video game ''[[Stop the Express]]'' (1983) reads, ''&quot;Congraturation! You sucsess!&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Five translations in games that will make you smile|url=https://global-lingo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/stop-the-express.jpg|language=en|access-date=2019-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; upon completing each level.

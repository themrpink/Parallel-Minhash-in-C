[[Ivan Mazepa]] was a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[Cossack]] [[hetman]] who fought for Russia but defected to Charles XII in 1708. Mazepa died in 1709 in Ottoman exile.

[[Peter the Great]] became Tsar in 1682 upon the death of his elder brother [[Feodor III of Russia|Feodor]] but did not become the actual ruler until 1689. He commenced reforming the country, turning the [[Tsardom of Russia|Russian tsardom]] into a [[Russian Empire|modernized empire]] relying on trade and on a strong, professional army and navy. He greatly expanded the size of Russia during his reign while providing access to the Baltic, Black, and Caspian seas. Beside Peter, the principal Russian commanders were [[Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov]] and [[Boris Sheremetev]].

[[Augustus II the Strong]], [[Electorate of Saxony|elector of Saxony]] and another cousin of Charles XII,&lt;ref group=nb name=cousins /&gt; gained the Polish crown after the death of King [[John III Sobieski]] in 1696. His ambitions to transform the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] into an absolute monarchy were not realized due to the zealous nature of the Polish nobility and the previously initiated laws that decreased the power of the monarch. His meeting with Peter the Great in [[Rawa Ruska]] in September 1698, where the plans to attack Sweden were made, became legendary for its decadence.

[[Frederick IV of Denmark]]-Norway, another cousin of Charles XII,&lt;ref group=nb name=cousins /&gt; succeeded [[Christian V of Denmark|Christian V]] in 1699 and continued his anti-Swedish policies. After the setbacks of 1700, he focused on transforming his state, an absolute monarchy, in a manner similar to Charles XI of Sweden. He did not achieve his main goal: to regain the former eastern Danish provinces lost to Sweden in the course of the 17th century. He was not able to keep northern Swedish Pomerania, Danish from 1712 to 1715. He did put an end to the Swedish threat south of Denmark. He ended Sweden's exemption from the [[Sound Dues]] (transit taxes/tariffs on cargo moved between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea).

[[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]] entered the war as [[Electorate of Brandenburg|elector of Brandenburg]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|king in Prussia]] – the royal title had been secured in 1701. He was determined to gain the [[Oder]] estuary with its access to the [[Baltic Sea]] for the Brandenburgian core areas, which had been a state goal [[Brandenburg-Pomeranian conflict|for centuries]].

[[George I of Great Britain|George I]] of the [[House of Hanover]], elector of [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanover]] and, since 1714, king of Great Britain and of Ireland, took the opportunity to connect his landlocked German electorate to the [[North Sea]].

=== Army size ===
In 1700, [[Charles XII]] had a standing army of 77,000 men (based on annual training). By 1707 this number had swollen to at least 120,000 despite casualties.

Russia was able to mobilize a larger army but could not put all of it into action simultaneously. The Russian mobilization system was ineffective and the expanding nation needed to be defended in many locations. A grand mobilization covering Russia's vast territories would have been unrealistic. Peter I tried to raise his army's morale to Swedish levels. Denmark contributed 20,000 men in their invasion of Holstein-Gottorp and more on other fronts. Poland and Saxony together could mobilize at least 100,000 men.

[[File:Bombardementet af København 1700.jpg|thumb|left|240px|The bombardment of [[Copenhagen]], 1700]]
[[Frederick IV of Denmark|Frederik IV of Denmark–Norway]] directed his first attack against Sweden's ally [[Holstein-Gottorp]]. In March 1700, a Danish army laid [[Siege of Tönning|siege to Tönning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frost|2000|pp=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, [[Augustus II]]'s forces advanced through [[Swedish Livonia]], captured [[Dünamünde]] and laid siege to [[Riga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frost|2000|pp=228–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles XII of Sweden]] first focused on attacking Denmark. The Swedish navy was able to outmaneuver the Danish [[Öresund|Sound]] blockade and deploy an army near the Danish capital, [[Copenhagen]]. At the same time, a combined Anglo-Dutch fleet had also set course towards Denmark. Together with the Swedish fleet, they carried out a bombardment of Copenhagen from 20 to 26 July. This surprise move and pressure by the Maritime Powers ([[Kingdom of England|England]] and the [[Dutch Republic]]) forced Denmark–Norway to withdraw from the war in August 1700 according to the terms of the [[Peace of Travendal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Frost229&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Frost|2000|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles XII was now able to speedily deploy his army to the eastern coast of the [[Baltic Sea]] and face his remaining enemies: besides the army of Augustus II in Livonia, an army of Russian tsar [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] was already on its way to invade Swedish [[Ingria]],&lt;ref name=Frost229 /&gt; where it laid siege to [[Narva]] in October. In November, the Russian and Swedish armies met at the [[Battle of Narva (1700)|First Battle of Narva]] where the Russians suffered a crushing defeat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frost230&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Frost|2000|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the dissolution of the first coalition through the [[peace of Travendal]] and with the victory at Narva; the Swedish chancellor, [[Benedict Oxenstjerna]], attempted to use the bidding for the favour of Sweden by France and the Maritime Powers (then on the eve of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]])&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Sweden |volume=26 |pages=205–206 |first=Edmund |last=Gosse |authorlink=Edmund Gosse}}&lt;/ref&gt; to end the war and make Charles an arbiter of Europe.

[[File:Charles XII is crossing the Düna, 1701.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Crossing of the Düna|Battle of Riga]], the first major battle of the [[Charles XII's invasion of Poland|Swedish invasion of Poland]], 1701]]

Charles XII then turned south to meet [[Augustus II]], [[Electorate of Saxony|Elector of Saxony]], [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|King of Poland]] and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Grand Duke of Lithuania]]. The [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was formally neutral at this point, as Augustus started the war as an Elector of Saxony. Disregarding Polish negotiation proposals supported by the Swedish parliament, Charles [[Crossing of the Düna|crossed into]] the Commonwealth and decisively defeated the Saxe-Polish forces in the [[Battle of Klissow]] in 1702 and in the [[Battle of Pułtusk (1703)|Battle of Pultusk]] in 1703. This successful invasion enabled Charles XII to dethrone Augustus II and coerce the Polish [[sejm]] to replace him with [[Stanisław I Leszczyński]] in 1704.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tucker|2010|p=694}}&lt;/ref&gt; August II resisted, still possessing control of his native Saxony, but was decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Fraustadt]] in 1706, a battle sometimes compared to the Ancient [[Battle of Cannae]] due to the Swedish forces' use of [[double envelopment]], with a deadly result for the Saxon army. August II was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Altranstädt (1706)|Treaty of Altranstädt]] in 1706 in which he made peace with the Swedish Empire,&lt;ref name=&quot;Tucker 701&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tucker|2010|p=701}}&lt;/ref&gt; renounced his claims to the Polish crown, accepted Stanisław Leszczyński as king, and ended his alliance with Russia. Patkul was also extradited and executed by [[breaking on the wheel]] in 1707, an incident which, given his diplomatic immunity, infuriated opinion against the Swedish king, who was then expected to win the war against the only hostile power remaining, Tsar Peter's Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frost|2000|pp=230, 263ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1702–1710: Russia and the Baltic provinces ==
{{Main|Battle of Erastfer|Charles XII invasion of Russia|Battle of Holowczyn|Battle of Malatitze|Battle of Lesnaya|Pursuit of Krasnokutsk|Battle of Poltava|Capitulation of Estonia and Livonia}}
{{multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=Siege of Nöteborg (1702).PNG|caption1=[[Peter the Great]] assaults the island fortress of Nöteborg, which he renamed [[Shlisselburg]], recognising it as the &quot;key&quot; to taking [[Ingria]].|image2=Battle of Poltava 1709.PNG|caption2=Decisive Russian victory at [[Battle of Poltava|Poltava 1709]]|width=300}}

The [[Battle of Narva (1700)|Battle of Narva]] dealt a severe setback to [[Peter the Great]], but the shift of Charles XII's army to the Polish-Saxon threat soon afterward provided him with an opportunity to regroup and regain territory in the Baltic provinces. Russian victories at [[Battle of Erastfer|Erastfer]] and [[Siege of Nöteborg (1702)|Nöteborg (Shlisselburg)]] provided access to [[Ingria]] in 1703, where Peter captured the Swedish fortress of [[Nyen]], guarding the mouth of the [[Neva River|River Neva]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tucker 691&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tucker|2010|p=691}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to General [[Adam Ludwig Lewenhaupt]], whose outnumbered forces fended the Russians off in the battles of [[Battle of Gemauerthof|Gemäuerthof]] and [[Battle of Jakobstadt|Jakobstadt]], Sweden was able to maintain control of most of her Baltic provinces. Before going to war, Peter had made preparations for a navy and a modern-style army, based primarily on infantry drilled in the use of firearms.

The Nyen fortress was soon abandoned and demolished by Peter, who built nearby a [[Peter and Paul Fortress|superior fortress]] as a beginning to the city of [[Saint Petersburg]]. By 1704, other fortresses were situated on the island of [[Kotlin Island|Kotlin]] and the sand flats to its south. These became known as [[Kronstadt]] and Kronslot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tucker 691&quot;/&gt; The Swedes attempted a raid on the Neva fort on 13 July 1704 with ships and landing armies, but the Russian fortifications held. In 1705, repeated Swedish attacks were made against Russian fortifications in the area, to little effect. A major attack on 15 July 1705 ended in the deaths of more than 500 Swedish men, or a third of its forces{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=10–19}}

In view of continued failure to check Russian consolidation, and with declining manpower, Sweden opted to blockade Saint Petersburg in 1705. In the summer of 1706, Swedish General [[Georg Johan Maidel]] crossed the Neva with 4,000 troops and defeated an opposing Russian force, but made no move on Saint Petersburg. Later in the autumn [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] led an army of 20,000 men in an attempt to take the Swedish town and fortress of [[Vyborg|Viborg]]. However, bad roads proved impassable to his heavy siege guns. The troops, who arrived on 12 October, therefore had to abandon the siege after only a few days. On 12 May 1708, a Russian galley fleet made a lightning raid on [[Porvoo|Borgå]] and managed to return to Kronslot just one day before the Swedish battle fleet returned to the blockade, after being delayed by unfavourable winds.

In August 1708, a Swedish army of 12,000 men under General [[Georg Henrik Lybecker]] attacked [[Ingria]], crossing the Neva from the north. They met stubborn resistance, ran out of supplies and, after reaching the Gulf of Finland west of Kronstadt, had to be evacuated by sea between 10 and 17 October. Over 11,000 men were evacuated but more than 5000 horses were slaughtered, which crippled the mobility and offensive capability of the Swedish army in Finland for several years. [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] took advantage of this by redeploying a large number of men from Ingria to [[Ukraine]].{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=20–27}}

Charles spent the years 1702–06 in a prolonged struggle with [[Augustus II the Strong]]; he had already inflicted defeat on him at [[Crossing of the Daugava|Riga]] in June 1701 and took Warsaw the following year, but trying to force a decisive defeat proved elusive. Russia left Poland in the spring of 1706, abandoning artillery but escaping from the pursuing Swedes, who stopped at [[Pinsk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tucker|2010|p=700}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles wanted not just to defeat the Commonwealth army but to depose Augustus, whom he regarded as especially treasonous, and have him replaced with someone who would be a Swedish ally, though this proved hard to achieve. After years of marches and fighting around Poland he finally had to invade Augustus' hereditary [[Saxony]] to take him out of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tucker 701&quot;/&gt; In the [[treaty of Altranstädt (1706)]], Augustus was finally forced to step down from the Polish throne, but Charles had already lost the valuable advantage of time over his main enemy in the east, Peter I, who then had the time to recover and build up an army that was both new and better.

At this point, in 1707, Peter offered to return everything he had so far occupied (essentially Ingria) except Saint Petersburg and the line of the Neva,&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt; to avoid a full-scale war, but Charles XII refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tucker|2010|p=703}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he initiated a march from Saxony [[Charles XII invasion of Russia|to invade Russia]]. Though his primary goal was Moscow, the strength of his forces was sapped by the cold weather (the [[Great Frost of 1709|winter of 1708/09]] being one of the most severe in modern European history)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tucker|2010|p=707}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Peter's use of [[scorched earth]] tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tucker|2010|p=704}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the main army turned south to recover in [[Ukraine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tucker|2010|p=706}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second army with supplies and reinforcements was intercepted and routed at [[Battle of Lesnaya|Lesnaya]]—and so were the supplies and reinforcements of Swedish ally [[Ivan Mazepa]] in [[Baturyn]]. Charles was crushingly defeated by a larger Russian force under Peter in the [[Battle of Poltava]] and fled to the [[Ottoman Empire]] while the remains of his army [[Surrender at Perevolochna|surrendered at Perevolochna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frost|2000|pp=231, 286ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This shattering defeat in 1709 did not end the war, although it decided it. Denmark and Saxony joined the war again and Augustus the Strong, through the politics of [[Boris Kurakin]], regained the Polish throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tucker|2010|p=710}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter continued his campaigns in the Baltics, and eventually he built up a powerful navy. In 1710 the Russian forces captured [[Riga]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tucker|2010|p=711}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the time the most populated city in the Swedish realm, and [[Tallinn]], evicting the Swedes from the Baltic provinces, now integrated in the Russian Tsardom by the [[capitulation of Estonia and Livonia]].

== Formation of a new anti-Swedish alliance ==
After Poltava, Peter the Great and Augustus the Strong allied again in the [[Treaty of Thorn (1709)]]; Frederick IV of Denmark-Norway with Augustus the Strong in the [[Treaty of Dresden (1709)]]; and Russia with Denmark–Norway in the subsequent [[Treaty of Copenhagen (1709)|Treaty of Copenhagen]]. In the [[Treaty of Hanover (1710)]], Hanover, whose elector was to become [[George I of Great Britain]], allied with Russia. In 1713, [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] allied with Russia in the [[Treaty of Schwedt]]. George I of Great Britain and Hanover concluded three alliances in 1715: the [[Treaty of Berlin (1715)|Treaty of Berlin]] with Denmark–Norway, the [[Treaty of Stettin (1715)|Treaty of Stettin]] with Brandenburg-Prussia, and the [[Treaty of Greifswald]] with Russia.

== 1709–1714: Ottoman Empire ==
{{Main|Pruth Campaign|Skirmish at Bender}}

When his army surrendered, Charles XII of Sweden and a few soldiers escaped to [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman territory]], founding a colony in front of [[Bender, Moldova]]. Peter I demanded Charles's eviction, and when the sultan refused, Peter decided to force it by invading the [[Ottoman Empire]]. However the ensuing [[Pruth River Campaign]] resulted in a disaster for the Russians as Peter's army was trapped by an Ottoman army at the [[Pruth]] river. However, Peter managed to negotiate a retreat, making a few territorial concessions and promising to withdraw his forces from the [[Holy Roman Empire]] as well as allowing Charles's return to Sweden. These terms were laid out in the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1713)]]. Charles showed no interest in returning, established a provisional court in his colony, and sought to persuade the sultan to engage in an Ottoman-Swedish assault on Russia. The sultan put an end to the generous hospitality granted and [[Skirmish at Bender|had the king arrested in what became known as the &quot;kalabalik&quot;]] in 1713. Charles was then confined at [[Timurtash]] and [[Didymoteicho|Demotika]]; later he abandoned his hopes for an Ottoman front and returned to Sweden in a 14-day ride.&lt;ref&gt;Petersen (2007), pp. 268–272, 275; Bengtsson (1960), pp. 393ff, 409ff, 420–445&lt;/ref&gt;

The war between Russia and Sweden continued after the disaster of [[Battle of Poltava|Poltava]] in 1709, though the shattered Swedish continental army could provide very little help. Russia [[Siege of Vyborg (1710)|captured Viborg]] (ru. Vyborg) in 1710 and successfully held it against Swedish attempts to retake the town in 1711.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=27–31}} In 1712 the first Russian campaign to capture Finland began under the command of General Admiral [[Fyodor Apraksin]]. Apraksin gathered an army of 15,000 men at [[Vyborg]] and started the operation in late August. Swedish General [[Georg Henrik Lybecker]] chose not to face the Russians with his 7,500 men in the prepared positions close to Vyborg and instead withdrew west of [[Kymijoki]] river using scorched earth tactics. Apraksin's forces reached the river but chose not to cross it and instead withdrew back to Vyborg, likely due to problems in supply.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=32–33}} Swedish efforts to maintain their defences were greatly hampered by the drain of manpower by the continental army and various garrisons around the Baltic Sea as well as by the [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|plague outbreak]] that struck Finland and Sweden between 1710 and 1713, which devastated the land killing, amongst others, over half of the population of Helsingfors (Helsinki).{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=30}}

[[File:Siege of Vyborg 1710.png|thumb|The final days of the siege of [[Vyborg]], by Alexei Rostovtsev]]

After the failure of 1712, Peter the Great ordered that further campaigns in war-ravaged regions of Finland with poor transportation networks were to be performed along the coastline and the seaways near the coast. Alarmed by the Russian preparations Lybecker requested naval units to be brought in as soon as possible in the spring of 1713. However, like so often, Swedish naval units arrived only after the initial Russian spring campaign had ended.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=33}} Nominally under the command of Apraksin, but accompanied Peter the Great, a fleet of coastal ships together with 12,000 men – infantry and artillery – began the campaign by sailing from [[Kronstadt]] on 2 May 1713; a further 4,000 cavalry were later sent overland to join with the army. The fleet had already arrived at Helsinki on 8 May and were met by 1,800 Swedish infantry under General [[Carl Gustaf Armfeldt]]. Together with rowers from the ships the Russians had 20,000 men at their disposal even without the cavalry. The defenders, however, managed to fend off landing attempts by the attackers until the Russians landed at their flank at [[Hietalahti, Helsinki|Sandviken]], which forced Armfelt to retire towards [[Porvoo]] (Borgå) after setting afire both the town and all the supplies stored there as well as bridges leading north from the town. It was only on 12 May that Swedish squadron under Admiral Erik Johan Lillie made it to Helsinki but there was nothing it could do.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=33–35}}

The bulk of the Russian forces moved along the coast towards Borgå and the forces of Lybecker, whom Armfelt had joined. On 21–22 May 1713 a Russian force of 10,000 men landed at [[Pernå]] (Pernaja) and constructed fortifications there. Large stores of supplies and munitions were transported from Vyborg and [[Saint Petersburg]] to the new base of operations. Russian cavalry managed to link up with the rest of the army there as well. Lybecker's army of 7000 infantry and 3000 cavalry avoided contact with the Russians and instead kept withdrawing further inland without even contesting the control of Borgå region or the important coastal road between Helsinki (Helsingfors) and [[Turku]] (Åbo). This also severed the contact between Swedish fleet and ground forces and prevented Swedish naval units from supplying it. Soldiers in the Swedish army who were mostly Finnish resented being repeatedly ordered to withdraw without even seeing the enemy. Lybecker was soon recalled to [[Stockholm]] for a hearing and Armfelt was ordered to the command of the army. Under his command the Swedish army in Finland stopped to engage the advancing Russians at [[battle of Pälkäne|Pälkäne]] in October 1713, where a Russian flanking manoeuvre forced him to withdraw to avoid getting encircled. The armies met again later at [[Battle of Napue|Napue]] in February 1714, where the Russians won a decisive victory.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=35}}

In 1714 far greater Swedish naval assets were diverted towards Finland, which managed to cut the coastal sea route past [[Hangö]] cape already in early May 1714. This caused severe trouble for Russian supply route to Turku and beyond as supplies had to be carried overland. The Russian galley fleet arrived to the area on 29 June but stayed idle until 26–27 July when, under the leadership of Peter, Russian galleys managed to run the blockade making use of calm weather, which immobilized the Swedish battlefleet while losing only one galley of roughly 100. A small, hastily assembled Swedish coastal squadron met the Russian galley fleet west of Hangö cape in the [[Battle of Gangut]] and was overpowered by the Russians who had nearly ten-fold superiority. Russian breach of the blockade at Hangö forced the Swedish fleet to withdraw to prevent the Russian fleet from reaching Sweden itself. The Russian army occupied Finland mostly in 1713–1714, capturing Åland from where the population had already fled to Sweden on 13 August 1714. Since the Russian galley fleet was not able to raid the Swedish coast, with the exception of [[Umeå]], which was plundered on 18 September, the fleet instead supported the advance of the Russian army, which led to hastily withdrawal by the Swedish army from [[Raahe]] (Brahestad) to [[Tornio]] (Torneå). The occupation period of Finland in 1714–1721 is known as the [[Greater Wrath]].{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=38–46}}

In 1710, the Swedish army in Poland retreated to [[Swedish Pomerania]], pursued by the coalition. In 1711, [[Siege of Stralsund (1711–1715)|siege was laid to Stralsund]]. Yet the town could not be taken due to the arrival of a Swedish relief army, led by general Magnus Stenbock, which secured the Pomeranian pocket before turning west to defeat an allied army in the [[Battle of Gadebusch]]. Pursued by coalition forces, Stenbock and his army was trapped and surrendered during the [[Siege of Tönning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson|1998|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1714, Charles XII returned from the Ottoman Empire, arriving in [[Stralsund]] in November. In nearby [[Greifswald]], already lost to Sweden, Russian tsar [[Peter the Great]] and British king [[George I of the United Kingdom|George I]], in his position as [[Electorate of Hanover|Elector of Hanover]], had just signed an alliance on 17 [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar|(OS)]]/28 [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar|(NS)]] October.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Torke|2005|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously a formally neutral party in the Pomeranian campaigns, [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] openly joined the coalition by declaring war on Sweden in the summer of 1715.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meier|2008|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles was then at war with much of Northern Europe, and Stralsund was doomed. Charles remained there until December 1715, [[Battle of Stralsund (1715)|escaping only days before Stralsund fell]].

After Charles XII had returned from the Ottoman Empire and resumed personal control of the war effort, he initiated two [[Great Northern War and Norway|Norwegian Campaigns]], starting in February 1716, to force Denmark–Norway into a separate peace treaty. Furthermore, he attempted to bar Great Britain access to the Baltic Sea. In search for allies, Charles XII also negotiated with the British [[Jacobitism|Jacobite party]]. This resulted in Great Britain declaring war on Sweden in 1717. The Norwegian campaigns were halted and the [[Carolean Death March|army withdrawn]] when Charles XII was shot dead while besieging Norwegian [[Fredriksten]] on 30 November 1718 ([[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar|OS]]). He was succeeded by his sister, [[Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden|Ulrika Eleonora]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Frost295296&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Frost|2000|pp=295–296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Charles XII, Sweden still refused to make peace with Russia on Peter's terms. Despite a continued Swedish naval presence and strong patrols to protect the coast, small Russian raids took place in 1716 at [[Öregrund]], while in July 1717 a Russian squadron landed troops at [[Gotland]] who raided for supplies. To place pressure on Sweden, Russia sent a large fleet to the Swedish east coast in July 1719. There, under protection of the Russian battlefleet, the Russian galley fleet was split into three groups. One group headed for the coast of [[Uppland]], the second to the vicinity of [[Stockholm]], and the last to coast of [[Södermanland]]. Together they carried a landing force of nearly 30,000 men. Raiding continued for a month and devastated amongst others the towns of [[Norrtälje]], [[Södertälje]], [[Nyköping]] and [[Norrköping]], and almost all the buildings in the archipelago of Stockholm were burned. A smaller Russian force advanced on the Swedish capital but was stopped at the [[battle of Stäket]] on 13 August. Swedish and British fleets, now allied with Sweden, sailing from the west coast of Sweden but failed to catch the raiders.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=47}}

After the [[treaty of Frederiksborg]] in early 1720, Sweden was no longer at war with Denmark, which allowed more forces to be placed against the Russians. This did not prevent Russian galleys from raiding the town of [[Umeå]] once again. Later in July 1720 a squadron from the Swedish battlefleet engaged the Russian galley fleet in the [[battle of Grengam]]. While the result of the battle is contested, it ended Russian galley raids in 1720. As negotiations for peace did not progress, the Russian galleys were once again sent to raid the Swedish coast in 1721, targeting primarily the Swedish coast between [[Gävle]] and [[Piteå]].{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=48-51}}

By the time of Charles XII's death, the anti-Swedish allies became increasingly divided on how to fill the power gap left behind by the defeated and retreating Swedish armies. George I and Frederik IV both coveted hegemony in northern Germany, while Augustus the Strong was concerned about the ambitions of Frederick William I on the southeastern Baltic coast. Peter the Great, whose forces were spread all around the Baltic Sea, envisioned hegemony in East Central Europe and sought to establish naval bases as far west as [[Mecklenburg]]. In January 1719, George I, Augustus and emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] concluded a [[Treaty of Vienna (1719)|treaty in Vienna]] aimed at reducing Russia's frontiers to the pre-war limits.&lt;ref name=Frost295296 /&gt;

Hanover-Great Britain and Brandenburg-Prussia thereupon negotiated separate peace treaties with Sweden, the [[Treaties of Stockholm (Great Northern War)|treaties of Stockholm]] in 1719 and early 1720, which partitioned Sweden's northern German dominions among the parties. The negotiations were mediated by French diplomats, who sought to prevent a complete collapse of Sweden's position on the southern Baltic coast and assured that Sweden was to retain [[Wismar]] and northern [[Swedish Pomerania]]. Hanover gained Swedish [[Bremen-Verden]], while Brandenburg-Prussia [[Province of Pomerania (1653–1815)|incorporated]] southern Swedish Pomerania.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frost296&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Frost|2000|p=296}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Britain would briefly switch sides and supported Sweden before leaving the war.
In addition to the rivalries in the anti-Swedish coalition, there was an inner-Swedish rivalry between [[Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp]], and [[Frederick I of Sweden|Frederick I of Hesse-Cassel]] for the Swedish throne. The Gottorp party succumbed and Ulrike Eleonora, wife of Frederick I, transferred power to her husband in May 1720. When peace was concluded with Denmark, the anti-Swedish coalition had already fallen apart, and Denmark was not in a military position to negotiate a return of her former eastern provinces across the [[Øresund|sound]]. Frederick I was, however, willing to cede Swedish support for his rival in Holstein-Gottorp, which came under Danish control with its northern part annexed, and furthermore cede the Swedish privilege of exemption from the [[Sound Dues]]. A respective treaty was [[Treaty of Frederiksborg|concluded in Frederiksborg]] in June 1720.&lt;ref name=Frost296 /&gt;

When Sweden finally was at peace with Hanover, Great Britain, Brandenburg-Prussia and Denmark–Norway, she hoped that the anti-Russian sentiments of the Vienna parties and France would culminate in an alliance that would restore her Russian-occupied eastern provinces. Yet, primarily due to internal conflicts in Great Britain and France, that did not happen. Therefore, the war was finally concluded by the [[Treaty of Nystad]] between Russia and Sweden in [[Uusikaupunki]] (''Nystad'') on 30 August 1721 ([[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar|OS]]). Finland was returned to Sweden, while the majority of Russia's conquests (Swedish [[Estonia]], [[Swedish Livonia|Livonia]], [[Ingria]], [[Priozersk|Kexholm]] and the bulk of [[Karelia]]) were ceded to the tsardom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rambaud|first=Arthur|title=Recueil des instructions données aux ambassadeurs et ministres de France depuis les traités de Westphalie jusqu'à la Révolution française|publisher=Ancienne Librairie Germer Baillière et Cie.|year=1890|location=Paris|pages=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden's dissatisfaction with the result led to fruitless attempts at recovering the lost territories in the course of the following century, such as the [[Russo-Swedish War (1741–1743)]], and the [[Russo-Swedish War (1788–1790)]].&lt;ref name=Frost296 /&gt;

Saxe-Poland-Lithuania and Sweden did not conclude a formal peace treaty; instead, they renewed the [[Peace of Oliva]] that had ended the [[Second Northern War]] in 1660.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Donnert|1997|p=510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweden had lost almost all of its &quot;overseas&quot; holdings gained in the 17th century and ceased to be a major power. Russia gained its Baltic territories and became one of the greatest powers in Europe.

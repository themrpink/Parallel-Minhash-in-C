Russia was militarily weak, technologically backward and administratively incompetent. Despite its grand ambitions toward the south, it had not built its railway network in that direction, and communications were poor. The bureaucracy was riddled with graft, corruption and inefficiency and was unprepared for war. Its navy was weak and technologically backward; its army, although very large, suffered from colonels who pocketed their men's pay, from poor morale, and from a technological deficit relative to Britain and France. By the war's end, the profound weaknesses of the Russian armed forces were readily apparent, and the Russian leadership was determined to reform it.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Jelavich, ''St. Petersburg and Moscow: Tsarist and Soviet Foreign Policy, 1814–1974'' (1974) p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William C.

He pursued [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] support by asserting France's &quot;sovereign authority&quot; over the Christian population of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Royle2000&quot; /&gt;{{rp|19}} to the detriment of Russia&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|103}} (the sponsor of [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Orthodoxy]]). To achieve this, in May 1851, Napoleon appointed the Marquis [[Charles, marquis de La Valette|Charles de La Valette]] (a zealous leading member of the Catholic &quot;clerical party&quot;) as his ambassador to the [[Sublime Porte]] of the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|7–9}}

Russia disputed this attempted change in authority. Referencing two previous treaties (one from 1757, and the [[Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca]] from 1774), the Ottomans reversed their earlier decision, renouncing the French treaty, and declaring that Russia was the protector of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]] in the Ottoman Empire.

Napoleon&amp;nbsp;III responded with a show of force, sending the [[ship of the line]] ''[[French ship Charlemagne (1852)|Charlemagne]]'' to the Black Sea, thereby violating the [[London Straits Convention]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|104}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Royle2000&quot; /&gt;{{rp|19}} This [[gunboat diplomacy]] show of force, together with money{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}, induced the Ottoman [[Abdülmecid I|Sultan Abdülmecid&amp;nbsp;I]] to accept a new treaty, confirming France and the [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s supreme authority over Catholic holy places, including the [[Church of the Nativity]], previously held by the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem|Greek Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Royle2000&quot; /&gt;{{rp|20}}

Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas&amp;nbsp;I]] then deployed his 4th and 5th army corps along the River [[Danube]] in Wallachia, as a direct threat to the Ottoman lands south of the river. He had Count [[Karl Nesselrode]], his foreign minister, undertake talks with the Ottomans. Nesselrode confided to Sir [[George Hamilton Seymour]], the [[British Ambassador to Russia|British ambassador]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]:

{{quote|''[The dispute over the holy places]'' had assumed a new character—that the acts of injustice towards the Greek church which it had been desired to prevent had been perpetrated and consequently that now the object must be to find a remedy for these wrongs. The success of French negotiations at Constantinople was to be ascribed solely to intrigue and violence—violence which had been supposed to be the [[ultima ratio]] of kings, being, it had been seen, the means which the present ruler of France was in the habit of employing in the first instance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Royle2000&quot; /&gt;{{rp|21}}}}

As conflict emerged over the issue of the holy places, Nicholas I and Nesselrode began a diplomatic offensive, which they hoped would prevent either British or French interference in any conflict between Russia and the Ottomans, as well as to prevent an anti-Russian alliance of the two.

Nicholas began courting Britain by means of conversations with the British ambassador, George Hamilton Seymour, in January and February 1853.&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|105}} Nicholas insisted that he no longer wished to expand Imperial Russia&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|105}} but that he had an obligation to the Christian communities in the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|105}}
{{Anchor|Sened}}
The Tsar next dispatched a highly abrasive diplomat, [[Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov|Prince Menshikov]], on a special mission to the [[Ottoman Porte|Ottoman Sublime Porte]] in February 1853. By previous treaties, the sultan was committed &quot;to protect the (Eastern Orthodox) Christian religion and its churches&quot;. Menshikov demanded a Russian protectorate over all 12&amp;nbsp;million Orthodox Christians in the Empire, with control of the Orthodox Church's hierarchy. A compromise was reached regarding Orthodox access to the Holy Land, but the Sultan, strongly supported by the British ambassador, rejected the more sweeping demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jelavich|first=Barbara|authorlink=Barbara Jelavich|title=Russia's Balkan Entanglements, 1806–1914|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|pages=118–22|isbn=978-0-521-52250-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British and French sent in naval task forces to support the Ottomans, as Russia prepared to seize the [[Danubian Principalities]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|111–15}}

===First hostilities===
[[File:Russo-French skirmish during Crimean War.PNG|thumb|upright|Russo-French skirmish during the Crimean War]]

In February 1853, the British government of [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]], the prime minister, re-appointed [[Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe|Stratford Canning]] as British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|110}} Having resigned the ambassadorship in January, he had been replaced by [[Hugh Rose, 1st Baron Strathnairn|Colonel Rose]] as ''[[chargé d'affaires]]''. Lord Stratford then turned around and sailed back to Constantinople, arriving there on 5 April 1853. There he convinced the Sultan to reject the Russian treaty proposal, as compromising the independence of the Turks. The Leader of the Opposition in the British House of Commons, [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]], blamed Aberdeen and Stratford's actions for making war inevitable, thus starting the process which forced the Aberdeen government to resign in January 1855, over the war.

Shortly after he learned of the failure of Menshikov's diplomacy toward the end of June 1853, the Tsar sent armies under the commands of Field Marshal [[Ivan Paskevich]] and General [[Mikhail Dmitrievich Gorchakov|Mikhail Gorchakov]] across the River Pruth into the Ottoman-controlled [[Danubian Principalities]] of Moldavia and Wallachia. Fewer than half of the 80,000 Russian soldiers who crossed the Pruth in 1853 survived. By far, most of the deaths would result from sickness rather than action,&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|118–19}} for the Russian army still suffered from medical services that ranged from bad to none.

Russia had obtained recognition from the Ottoman Empire of the Tsar's role as special guardian of the Orthodox Christians in Moldavia and Wallachia. Now Russia used the Sultan's failure to resolve the issue of the protection of the Christian sites in the Holy Land as a pretext for Russian occupation of these Danubian provinces. Nicholas believed that the [[Europeans|European]] powers, especially [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], would not object strongly to the annexation of a few neighbouring Ottoman provinces, especially considering that Russia had assisted Austria's efforts in suppressing the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|1848 Hungarian Revolution]] in 1849.

The United Kingdom, hoping to maintain the Ottoman Empire as a bulwark against the expansion of Russian power in [[Asia]], sent a fleet to the [[Dardanelles]], where it joined another [[French Navy|fleet]] sent by France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lawrence Sondhaus|title=Naval Warfare, 1815–1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aYcUQ4XRqOoC&amp;pg=PA1852-IA16|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|pages=1852–55|isbn=9781134609949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Battle of Sinop====
{{main|Battle of Sinop}}
[[File:Battle of Sinop.jpg|thumb|The Russian destruction of the Turkish fleet at the [[Battle of Sinop]] on 30 November 1853 sparked the war (painting by [[Ivan Aivazovsky]]).]]

The European powers continued to pursue diplomatic avenues. The representatives of the four neutral Great Powers (the United Kingdom, France, Austria and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]) met in [[Vienna]], where they drafted a note that they hoped would be acceptable to both the Russians and the Ottomans. The peace terms arrived at by the four powers at the Vienna Conference (1853) were delivered to the Russians by the Austrian Foreign Minister [[Count Karl Ferdinand von Buol|Count Karl von Buol]] on 5 December 1853. The note met with the approval of Nicholas I, but [[Abdülmecid I]] rejected the proposal, feeling that the document's poor phrasing left it open to many different interpretations. The United Kingdom, France and Austria united in proposing amendments to mollify the Sultan, but the court of St. Petersburg ignored their suggestions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|143}} The United Kingdom and France then set aside the idea of continuing negotiations, but Austria and Prussia did not believe that the rejection of the proposed amendments justified the abandonment of the diplomatic process.

On 23 November, the Russian convoy of 3 battle ships discovered the Ottoman fleet harbored in Sinop harbor. Along with the additional 5 battle ships, in the [[Battle of Sinop]] on 30 November 1853, they destroyed a patrol squadron of 11 Ottoman battle ships while they were anchored in port under defense of the onshore artillery garrison. The United Kingdom and French press shaped the public opinion to demand the war. Both used Sinop as the ''[[casus belli]]'' (&quot;act of war&quot;) for declaring war against Russia. On 28 March 1854, after Russia ignored an Anglo-French ultimatum to withdraw from the Danubian Principalities, the UK and France declared war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Lambert|title=The Crimean War: British Grand Strategy Against Russia, 1853–56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GCVyIZEdc6kC&amp;pg=PA94|year=2011|publisher=Ashgate |pages=94, 97|isbn=9781409410119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher John Bartlett|title=Defence and Diplomacy: Britain and the Great Powers, 1815–1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aXi7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA51|year=1993|publisher=Manchester UP|pages=51–52|isbn=9780719035203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dardanelles===
Britain was concerned about Russian activity and Sir [[John Fox Burgoyne|John Burgoyne]], senior advisor to [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]], urged that the [[Dardanelles]] should be occupied and works of sufficient strength built to block any Russian move to capture Constantinople and gain access to the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The [[Corps of Royal Engineers]] sent men to the Dardanelles, while Burgoyne went to Paris, meeting the British Ambassador and the French Emperor. [[Henry Wellesley, 1st Earl Cowley|Lord Cowley]] wrote on 8 February to Burgoyne, &quot;Your visit to Paris has produced a visible change in the Emperor's views, and he is making every preparation for a land expedition in case the last attempt at negotiation should break down.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HCRE&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Porter |first=Maj Gen Whitworth |title=History of the Corps of Royal Engineers Vol I |year=1889|publisher=The Institution of Royal Engineers |location=Chatham}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|411}}

Burgoyne and his team of engineers inspected and surveyed the Dardanelles area in February, and were fired on by Russian riflemen when they went to [[Varna]]. A team of [[sapper]]s arrived in March, and major building works commenced on a seven-mile line of defence designed to block the [[Gallipoli]] peninsula. French sappers were working on one half of the line, which was finished in May.&lt;ref name=HCRE/&gt;{{rp|412}}

===Peace attempts===
[[File:Valley of the shadow of death.jpg|thumb|''[[Valley of the Shadow of Death (Roger Fenton)|Valley of the Shadow of Death]]'', by Roger Fenton, one of the most famous pictures of the Crimean War&lt;ref&gt;Figes 2012, p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Nicholas felt that, because of Russian assistance in suppressing the [[Hungarian revolution of 1848]], Austria would side with him, or at the very least remain neutral. Austria, however, felt threatened by the Russian troops in the Balkans. On 27 February 1854, the United Kingdom and France demanded the withdrawal of Russian forces from the principalities. Austria supported them, and, though it did not declare war on Russia, it refused to guarantee its neutrality. Russia's rejection of the ultimatum proved to be the justification used by Britain and France to enter the war.

Russia soon withdrew its troops from the Danubian principalities, which were then occupied by Austria for the duration of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Guy Arnold|title=Historical Dictionary of the Crimean War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_UreS--MoD0C&amp;pg=PA13|year=2002|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=13|isbn=9780810866133}}&lt;/ref&gt; This removed the original grounds for war, but the UK and France continued with hostilities. Determined to address the Eastern Question by putting an end to the Russian threat to the Ottoman Empire, the allies in August 1854 proposed the &quot;Four Points&quot; for ending the conflict, in addition to the Russian withdrawal:
* Russia was to give up its protectorate over the Danubian Principalities;
* The Danube was to be opened up to foreign commerce;
* The [[London Straits Convention|Straits Convention of 1841]], which allowed only Ottoman and Russian warships in the Black Sea, was to be revised;
* Russia was to abandon any claim granting it the right to interfere in Ottoman affairs on behalf of Orthodox Christians.

These points (particularly the third) would require clarification through negotiation, but Russia refused to negotiate. The allies including Austria therefore agreed that Britain and France should take further military action to prevent further Russian aggression against the Ottoman Empire. Britain and France agreed on the invasion of the Crimean peninsula as the first step.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Crimean War|last = Small|first = Hugh|publisher = Tempus Publishing|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-7524-4388-1|pages = 23, 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Danube campaign===
{{see also|Wallachian Revolution of 1848|1848 Moldavian revolution|Convention of Balta Liman}}

The Danube campaign opened when the Russians occupied the [[Danubian Principalities]] of Moldavia and Wallachia in May 1853, bringing their forces to the north bank of the River [[Danube]]. In response, the Ottoman Empire also moved its forces up to the river, establishing strongholds at [[Vidin]] in the west and [[Silistra]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|172–84}} in the east, near the mouth of the Danube. The Ottoman move up the River Danube was also of concern to the [[Austrian Empire|Austrians]], who moved forces into [[Transylvania]] in response. However, the Austrians had begun to fear the Russians more than the Turks. Indeed, like the British, the Austrians were now coming to see that an intact Ottoman Empire was necessary as a bulwark against the Russians. Accordingly, Austria resisted Russian diplomatic attempts to join the war on the Russian side and remained neutral in the Crimean War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A.J.P. |last=Taylor |title=The Struggle for Mastery in Europe: 1848–1918 |url=https://archive.org/details/dli.bengal.10689.13016 |year=1954 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/dli.bengal.10689.13016/page/n106 64]–81 |publisher=OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS,MUMBAI }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mahmudiye (1829).jpg|thumb|''[[Mahmudiye (ship)|Mahmudiye]]'' (1829) participated in numerous important naval battles, including the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855)|Siege of Sevastopol]]]]

Following the Ottoman ultimatum in September 1853, forces under the Ottoman general [[Omar Pasha]] crossed the Danube at [[Vidin]] and captured [[Calafat]] in October 1853. Simultaneously, in the east, the Ottomans crossed the Danube at Silistra and attacked the Russians at [[Oltenița]]. The resulting [[Battle of Oltenița]] was the first engagement following the declaration of war. The Russians counterattacked, but were beaten back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Candan Badem|title=&quot;The&quot; Ottoman Crimean War: (1853–1856)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DXoYJikZ7ygC&amp;pg=PA102|year=2010|publisher=Brill|pages=101–09|isbn=978-9004182059}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 December 1853, the Ottoman forces at Calafat moved against the Russian force at Chetatea or [[Cetate, Dolj|Cetate]], a small village nine miles north of Calafat, and engaged them on 6 January 1854. The battle began when the Russians made a move to recapture Calafat. Most of the [[Battle of Cetate|heavy fighting]] took place in and around Chetatea until the Russians were driven out of the village. Despite the setback at Chetatea, on 28 January 1854, Russian forces laid [[Siege of Calafat|siege to Calafat]]. The siege would continue until May 1854 when the Russians lifted the siege. The Ottomans would also later beat the Russians in [[Caracal, Romania|battle at Caracal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|130–43}}

In early 1854 the Russians again advanced, crossing the River Danube into the Turkish province of [[Dobruja]]. By April 1854, the Russians had reached the lines of [[Trajan's Wall]] where they were finally halted. In the centre, the Russian forces crossed the Danube and laid [[Siege of Silistra|siege to Silistra]] from 14 April with 60,000 troops, the defenders with 15,000 had supplies for three months.&lt;ref name=HCRE/&gt;{{rp|415}} The siege was lifted on 23 June 1854.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James J.

[[File:Fall of Sevastopol.jpg|thumb|left|French [[zouave]]s and Russian soldiers engaged in hand-to-hand combat at [[Malakhov Kurgan]]]]

In the west, the Russians were dissuaded from attacking Vidin by the presence of the Austrian forces, which had swelled to 280,000 men. On 28 May 1854 a protocol of the Vienna Conference was signed by Austria and Russia. One of the aims of the Russian advance had been to encourage the Orthodox Christian [[Serbs]] and [[Bulgarians]] living under Ottoman rule to rebel. When the Russian troops crossed the River Pruth into Moldavia, the Orthodox Christians showed no interest in rising up against the Ottomans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|131, 137}} Adding to the worries of Nicholas I was the concern that Austria would enter the war against the Russians and attack his armies on the western flank. Indeed, after attempting to mediate a peaceful settlement between Russia and Ottoman Empire, the Austrians entered the war on the side of the Ottomans with an attack against the Russians in the Principalities which threatened to cut off the Russian supply lines. Accordingly, the Russians were forced to raise the siege of Silistra on 23 June 1854, and begin abandoning the Principalities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|185}} The lifting of the siege reduced the threat of a Russian advance into Bulgaria.

In June 1854, the Allied expeditionary force landed at [[Varna]], a city on the Black Sea's western coast. They made little advance from their base there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|175–76}}  [[Karl Marx]] was noted to have quipped, &quot;there they are, the French doing nothing and the British helping them as fast as possible&quot;.{{sfn|Troubetzkoy|2006|p=192}} In July 1854, the Ottomans under Omar Pasha crossed the Danube into Wallachia and on 7 July 1854 engaged the Russians in the city of [[Giurgiu]] and conquered it. The capture of Giurgiu by the Ottomans immediately threatened Bucharest in Wallachia with capture by the same Ottoman army. On 26 July 1854, Tsar Nicholas I, responding to an Austrian ultimatum, ordered the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Principalities. Also, in late July 1854, following up on the Russian retreat, the French staged an expedition against the Russian forces still in Dobruja, but this was a failure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|188–90}}

By then, the Russian withdrawal was complete, except for the fortress towns of northern Dobruja, while their place in the Principalities was taken by the Austrians, as a neutral peacekeeping force.&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|189}} There was little further action on this front after late 1854, and in September the allied force boarded ships at Varna to invade the [[Crimean Peninsula]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|198}}

===Black Sea theatre===
[[File:Turkish troops storming Fort Shefketil (cropped).jpg|thumb|Turkish troops storming [[Shekvetili|Fort Shefketil]]]]

The naval operations of the Crimean War commenced with the dispatch, in mid-1853, of the French and British fleets to the Black Sea region, to support the Ottomans and to dissuade the Russians from encroachment. By June 1853, both fleets were stationed at [[Beşik Bay, Çanakkale|Besikas Bay]], outside the [[Dardanelles]]. With the Russian occupation of the Danube Principalities in October, they moved to the [[Bosphorus]] and in November entered the Black Sea.

During this period, the Russian [[Black Sea Fleet]] was operating against Ottoman coastal traffic between Constantinople and the Caucasus ports, while the Ottoman fleet sought to protect this supply line. The clash came on 30 November 1853 when a Russian fleet attacked an Ottoman force in the harbour at [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinop]], and destroyed it at the [[Battle of Sinop]]. The battle outraged opinion in UK, which called for war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnold|first=Guy|title=Historical Dictionary of the Crimean War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_UreS--MoD0C&amp;pg=PR95|year=2002|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=95|isbn=9780810866133}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was little additional naval action until March 1854 when on the declaration of war the British frigate {{HMS|Furious|1850|6}} was fired on outside [[Odessa]] Harbour. In response an Anglo-French fleet [[Bombardment of Odessa|bombarded the port]], causing much damage to the town. To show support for Turkey after the battle of Sinop, on 22 December 1853, the Anglo-French squadron entered the Black Sea and the steamship HMS ''Retribution'' approached the [[Port of Sevastopol]], the commander of which received an ultimatum not to allow any ships in the Black Sea.

In June, the fleets transported the Allied expeditionary forces to [[Varna]], in support of the Ottoman operations on the Danube; in September they again transported the armies, this time to the Crimea. The Russian fleet during this time declined to engage the allies, preferring to maintain a &quot;[[fleet in being]]&quot;; this strategy failed when Sevastopol, the main port and where most of the Black Sea fleet was based, came under siege. The Russians were reduced to scuttling their warships as [[blockship]]s, after stripping them of their guns and men to reinforce batteries on shore. During the siege, the Russians lost four 110- or 120-gun, three-decker [[ship of the line|ships of the line]], twelve 84-gun two-deckers and four 60-gun [[frigate]]s in the Black Sea, plus a large number of smaller vessels. During the rest of the campaign the allied fleets remained in control of the Black Sea, ensuring the various fronts were kept supplied.

In May 1855, the allies successfully invaded [[Kerch]] and operated against [[Siege of Taganrog|Taganrog]] in the [[Sea of Azov]]. In September they moved against Russian installations in the [[Dnieper]] estuary, [[Battle of Kinburn (1855)|attacking Kinburn]] in the first use of [[ironclad]] ships in naval warfare.

===Crimean campaign===
[[File:Russo-British skirmish during Crimean War.png|thumb|upright|Russo-British skirmish during the Crimean War]]

The Russians evacuated Wallachia and Moldavia in late July 1854. With the evacuation of the Danubian Principalities, the immediate cause of war was withdrawn and the war might have ended at this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|192}} However, war fever among the public in both the UK and France had been whipped up by the press in both countries to the degree that politicians found it untenable to propose ending the war at this point. The coalition government of [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen]] fell on 30 January 1855 on a no-confidence vote as Parliament voted to appoint a committee to investigate mismanagement of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|311}}

French and British officers and engineers were sent on 20 July on HMS ''Fury'', a wooden Bulldog-class paddle sloop, to survey the harbour of Sevastopol and the coast near it, managing to get close to the harbour mouth to inspect the formidable batteries. Returning, they reported that they believed there were 15,000–20,000 troops encamped.&lt;ref name=HCRE/&gt;{{rp|421}} Ships were prepared to transport horses and siege equipment was both manufactured and imported.&lt;ref name=HCRE/&gt;{{rp|422}}

The Crimean campaign opened in September 1854. Three hundred and sixty ships sailed in seven columns, each steamer towing two sailing ships.&lt;ref name=HCRE/&gt;{{rp|422}} Anchoring on 13 September in the bay of [[Yevpatoria|Eupatoria]], the town surrendered and 500 marines landed to occupy it. This town and bay would provide a fall back position in case of disaster.&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|201}} The ships then sailed east to make the landing of the allied expeditionary force on the sandy beaches of [[Kalamita Bay|Calamita Bay]] on the south west coast of the Crimean Peninsula. The landing surprised the Russians, as they had expected a landing at [[Kacha, Sevastopol|Katcha]]; the last-minute change proving that Russia had known the original campaign plan. There was no sign of the enemy and the invading troops all landed on 14 September 1854. It took another four days to land all the stores, equipment, horses and artillery.

The landing took place north of Sevastopol, so the Russians had arrayed their army in expectation of a direct attack. The allies advanced and on the morning of 20 September came up to the River Alma and engaged the Russian army. The position was strong, but after three hours,&lt;ref name=HCRE/&gt;{{rp|424}} the allied frontal attack had driven the Russians out of their dug-in positions with losses of 6,000 men. The [[Battle of the Alma]] resulted in 3,300 Allied losses. Failing to pursue the retreating forces was one of many strategic errors made during the war, and the Russians themselves noted that had the Allies pressed south that day they would have easily captured Sevastopol.

Believing the northern approaches to the city too well defended, especially due to the presence of a large [[star fort]] and because Sevastopol was on the south side of [[Sevastopol Bay|the inlet from the sea that made the harbour]], Sir [[John Fox Burgoyne|John Burgoyne]], the engineer advisor, recommended that the allies attack Sevastopol from the south. The joint commanders, [[FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan|Raglan]] and [[Jacques Leroy de Saint Arnaud|St Arnaud]], agreed.&lt;ref name=HCRE/&gt;{{rp|426}} On 25 September the whole army began to march southeast and encircled the city from the south, after establishing port facilities at [[Balaklava|Balaclava]] for the British and at [[Kamiesch]] ({{lang-ru | Камышовая бухта | translit = Kamyshovaya bukhta}}) for the French. The Russians retreated into the city.&lt;ref&gt;The famous dispatches of a British war correspondent appear in William Howard Russell, ''The Great War with Russia: The Invasion of the Crimea; a Personal Retrospect of the Battles of the Alma, Balaclava and Inkerman, and of the Winter of 1854–55'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Frederick |last= Engels |chapter= The News from the Crimea |title= Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels |volume= 13 |publisher= International Publishers |location= New York |year= 1980 |origyear= 1853–54 |isbn= 978-0-7178-0513-6 |pages= 477–79 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allied army moved without problems to the south and the heavy artillery was brought ashore with batteries and connecting trenches built so that by 10 October some batteries were ready and by 17 October—when the bombardment commenced—126 guns were firing, 53 of them French.&lt;ref name=HCRE/&gt;{{rp|430}} The fleet at the same time engaged the shore batteries. The British bombardment worked better than that of the French, who had smaller-calibre guns. The fleet suffered high casualties during the day. The British wanted to attack that afternoon, but the French wanted to defer the attack. A postponement was agreed, but on the next day the French were still not ready. By 19 October the Russians had transferred some heavy guns to the southern defences and outgunned the allies.&lt;ref name=HCRE/&gt;{{rp|431}}

Reinforcements for the Russians gave them the courage to send out probing attacks. The Allied lines, beginning to suffer from cholera as early as September, were stretched. The French, on the west had less to do than the British on the east with their siege lines and the large nine-mile open wing back to their supply base on the south coast.

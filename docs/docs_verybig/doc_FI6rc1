In September 1962, de Gaulle sought a constitutional amendment to allow the president to be directly elected by the people and issued another [[1962 French presidential election referendum|referendum to this end]]. After a [[motion of censure]] voted by the parliament on 4 October 1962, de Gaulle dissolved the National Assembly and held [[1962 French legislative election|new elections]]. Although the left progressed, the Gaullists won an increased majority—this despite opposition from the Christian democratic [[Popular Republican Movement]] (MRP) and the [[National Centre of Independents and Peasants]] (CNIP) who criticised de Gaulle's [[euroscepticism]] and [[presidentialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=De Gaulle Challenge to Parliament – To Retire if Referendum not Approved – Call to Nation before Debate on Censure Motion|newspaper=The Times|date=5 October 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=De Gaulle against the Politicians – Clear Issue for October Referendum – Assembly Election Likely after Solid Censure Vote|newspaper=The Times|date=6 October 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle's proposal to change the election procedure for the French presidency was approved at the referendum on 28 October 1962 by more than three-fifths of voters despite a broad &quot;coalition of no&quot; formed by most of the parties, opposed to a presidential regime. Thereafter the president was to be elected by direct universal suffrage for the first time since Louis Napoleon in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=&quot;Yes&quot; Reply for Gen.

==1962–1968: Politics of grandeur==
With the Algerian conflict behind him, de Gaulle was able to achieve his two main objectives, the reform and development of the French economy, and the promotion of an independent foreign policy and a strong presence on the international stage. This was named by foreign observers the &quot;politics of grandeur&quot; (''politique de grandeur'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Kolodziej&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kolodziej|first=Edward A|title=French International Policy under de Gaulle and Pompidou: The Politics of Grandeur|year=1974|page=618}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Gaullism]].

===&quot;Thirty glorious years&quot;===
{{more citations needed section|date=June 2016}}
In the immediate post-war years France was in poor shape;&lt;ref name=Macksey/&gt; wages remained at around half prewar levels, the winter of 1946–1947 did extensive damage to crops, leading to a reduction in the bread ration, hunger and disease remained rife and the black market continued to flourish. Germany was in an even worse position, but after 1948 things began to improve dramatically with the introduction of [[Marshall Aid]]—large scale American financial assistance given to help rebuild European economies and infrastructure. This laid the foundations of a meticulously planned program of investments in energy, transport and heavy industry, overseen by the government of Prime Minister [[Georges Pompidou]].

In the context of a population boom unseen in France since the 18th century, the government intervened heavily in the economy, using ''[[dirigisme]]''—a unique combination of free-market and state-directed economy—with indicative five-year plans as its main tool. This was followed by a rapid transformation and expansion of the French economy.

High-profile projects, mostly but not always financially successful, were launched: the extension of [[Marseille]]'s harbour (soon ranking third in Europe and first in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]); the promotion of the [[Sud Aviation Caravelle|Caravelle]] passenger jetliner (a predecessor of [[Airbus]]); the decision to start building the supersonic Franco-British [[Concorde]] airliner in [[Toulouse]]; the expansion of the French auto industry with state-owned [[Renault]] at its centre; and the building of the first motorways between Paris and the provinces.

Aided by these projects, the French economy recorded growth rates unrivalled since the 19th century. In 1964, for the first time in nearly 100 years&lt;ref&gt;France's GDP was slightly higher than the UK's at the beginning of the 19th century, with the UK surpassing France around 1870. See e.g., {{cite book|last=Maddison|first=Angus|title=L'économie mondiale 1820–1992: analyse et statistiques|year=1995|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=978-92-64-24549-5|page=248|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A5BFpqBqQ_gC&amp;lpg=PA248}}&lt;/ref&gt; France's GDP overtook that of the United Kingdom. This period is still remembered in France with some nostalgia as the peak of the ''[[Trente Glorieuses]]'' (&quot;Thirty Glorious Years&quot; of economic growth between 1945 and 1974).&lt;ref name=&quot;Haine&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Haine|first=W.

In 1967, de Gaulle decreed a law that obliged all firms over certain sizes to distribute a small portion of their profits to their employees. By 1974, as a result of this measure, French employees received an average of 700 francs per head, equivalent to 3.2% of their salary.&lt;ref&gt;The New France: A Society in Transition 1945–1977 (Third Edition) by John Ardagh&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourth nuclear power===
[[File:President Kennedy and President De Gaulle at the conclusion of their talks at Elysee Palace, Paris, France.jpg|thumb|President [[John F. Kennedy]] and de Gaulle at the conclusion of their talks at Elysee Palace, 1961]]
During his first tenure as president, de Gaulle became enthusiastic about the possibilities of nuclear power. France had carried out important work in the early development of atomic energy and in October 1945 he established the French Atomic Energy Commission [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique]], (CEA) responsible for all scientific, commercial, and military uses of nuclear energy. However, partly due to communist influences in government opposed to proliferation, research stalled and France was excluded from American, British and Canadian nuclear efforts.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

By October 1952, the United Kingdom had become the third country—after the United States and the Soviet Union—to independently test and develop nuclear weapons. This gave Britain the capability to launch a nuclear strike via its [[Vulcan bomber]] force and they began developing a ballistic missile program known as [[Blue Streak (missile)|Blue Streak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/uk/blue-streak.htm|title=Blue Streak – Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile|publisher=Global Security.org|access-date=19 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as April 1954 while out of power, de Gaulle argued that France must have its own nuclear arsenal; at the time nuclear weapons were seen as a national status symbol and a way of maintaining international prestige with a place at the 'top table' of the United Nations. Full-scale research began again in late 1954 when Prime Minister [[Pierre Mendès France]] authorized a plan to develop the atomic bomb; large deposits of [[uranium]] had been discovered near [[Limoges]] in central France, providing the researchers with an unrestricted supply of nuclear fuel. France's independent [[Force de Frappe]] (strike force) came into being soon after de Gaulle's election with his authorization for the first nuclear test.

With the cancellation of Blue Streak, the US agreed to supply Britain with its [[GAM-87 Skybolt|Skybolt]] and later [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] weapons systems, and in 1958 the two nations signed the [[1958 US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement|Mutual Defence Agreement]] forging close links which have seen the US and UK cooperate on nuclear security matters ever since. Although at the time it was still a full member of NATO, France proceeded to develop its own independent nuclear technologies—this would enable it to become a partner in any reprisals and would give it a voice in matters of atomic control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Marshal Juin Defended – General de Gaulle on Moral Issue|newspaper=The Times|date=8 April 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FS Redoutable.jpg|thumb|The ''[[FS Redoutable|Redoutable]]'', the first French nuclear missile submarine.]]

After six years of effort, on 13 February 1960 France became the [[France and nuclear weapons|world's fourth nuclear power]] when a high-powered [[Gerboise Bleue|nuclear device]] was exploded in the [[Sahara]] some 700 miles south-south-west of Algiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weekend of Rejoicing in France&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Weekend of Rejoicing in France|newspaper=The Times|date=15 February 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1963 France decided against signing the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] designed to slow the arms race because it would have prohibited it from testing nuclear weapons above ground. France continued to carry out tests at the Algerian site until 1966, under an agreement with the newly independent Algeria. France's testing program then moved to the [[Mururoa]] and [[Fangataufa]] Atolls in the South Pacific.

In November 1967, an article by the French Chief of the General Staff (but inspired by de Gaulle) in the ''Revue de la Défense Nationale'' caused international consternation. It was stated that the French nuclear force should be capable of firing &quot;in all directions&quot;—thus including even America as a potential target. This surprising statement was intended as a declaration of French national independence, and was in retaliation to a warning issued long ago by [[Dean Rusk]] that US missiles would be aimed at France if it attempted to employ atomic weapons outside an agreed plan. However, criticism of de Gaulle was growing over his tendency to act alone with little regard for the views of others.&lt;ref&gt;Ledwidge p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; In August, concern over de Gaulle's policies had been voiced by [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] when he queried 'the solitary exercise of power'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Independents Fear for France's Future – Gaullist Policy Queried|newspaper=The Times|date=18 August 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NATO===
[[File:Lyndon B. Johnson, Charles de Gaulle 1963.jpg|thumb|De Gaulle with President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in Washington, D.C., 1963]]
With the onset of the Cold War and the perceived threat of invasion from the [[Soviet Union]] and the countries of the [[eastern bloc]], the United States, Canada and a number of western European countries set up the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) to co-ordinate a military response to any possible attack. France played a key role during the early days of the organisation, providing a large military contingent and agreeing—after much soul-searching—to the participation of West German forces. But after his election in 1958 Charles de Gaulle took the view that the organisation was too dominated by the US and UK, and that America would not fulfill its promise to defend Europe in the event of a Soviet invasion.

De Gaulle demanded political parity with Britain and America in NATO, and for its geographic coverage to be extended to include French territories abroad, including Algeria, then experiencing civil war. This was not forthcoming, and so in March 1959 France, citing the need for it to maintain its own independent military strategy, withdrew its Mediterranean Fleet (ALESCMED) from NATO, and a few months later de Gaulle demanded the removal of all US nuclear weapons from French territory.

[[File:Charles de Gaulle-1963.jpg|thumb|De Gaulle during his presidency]]

De Gaulle hosted a superpower summit on 17 May 1960 for arms limitation talks and détente efforts in the wake of the [[1960 U-2 incident]] between United States President [[Dwight Eisenhower]], Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]], and United Kingdom Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]].&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt; De Gaulle's warm relations with Eisenhower were noticed by United States military observers at that time. De Gaulle told Eisenhower: &quot;Obviously you cannot apologize but you must decide how you wish to handle this. I will do everything I can to be helpful without being openly partisan.&quot; When Khrushchev condemned the United States U-2 flights, de Gaulle expressed to Khrushchev his disapproval of 18 near-simultaneous secret Soviet satellite overflights of French territory; Khrushchev denied knowledge of the satellite overflights. Lieutenant General Vernon A. Walters wrote that after Khrushchev left, &quot;De Gaulle came over to Eisenhower and took him by the arm. He took me also by the elbow and, taking us a little apart, he said to Eisenhower, 'I do not know what Khrushchev is going to do, nor what is going to happen, but whatever he does, I want you to know that I am with you to the end.' I was astounded at this statement, and Eisenhower was clearly moved by his unexpected expression of unconditional support&quot;. General Walters was struck by de Gaulle's &quot;unconditional support&quot; of the United States during that &quot;crucial time&quot;.&lt;ref name=j1&gt;{{cite journal|author=Walter, Vernon A.|year=2007|origyear=1974|title=General De Gaulle in Action: 1960 Summit Conference|journal=Studies in Intelligence|volume=38|issue=5|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/95unclass/Walters.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle then tried to revive the talks by inviting all the delegates to another conference at the [[Élysée Palace]] to discuss the situation, but the summit ultimately dissolved in the wake of the U-2 incident.&lt;ref name=bbc1&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/17/newsid_2512000/2512335.stm 1960: East-West summit in tatters after spy plane row]. BBC.co.uk; accessed 7 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, de Gaulle visited the Soviet Union, where he hoped to establish France as an alternative influence in the Cold War. De Gaulle always viewed Communism as a passing phenomenon, and never used the term 'Soviet Union', always calling it Russia. In his view, Russian national interests rather than Communist ideology determined the decision-making in the Kremlin. Later, he proclaimed a new alliance between the nations, but although Soviet premier [[Alexei Kosygin]] later visited Paris, the Soviets clearly did not consider France a superpower and knew that they would remain dependent on the NATO alliance in the event of a war. In 1965, de Gaulle pulled France out of [[SEATO]], the southeast Asian equivalent of NATO, and refused to participate in any future NATO maneuvers.

In February 1966, France withdrew from the [[NATO Military Command Structure]], but remained within the organisation. De Gaulle, haunted by the memories of 1940, wanted France to remain the master of the decisions affecting it, unlike in the 1930s when it had to follow in step with its British ally. He also ordered all foreign military personnel to leave France within a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crawley-1969&quot; /&gt;{{RP|431}} This latter action was particularly badly received in the US, prompting [[Dean Rusk]], the US Secretary of State, to ask de Gaulle whether the removal of American military personnel was to include exhumation of the 50,000 American war dead buried in French cemeteries.&lt;ref name=&quot;FontanaHistory&quot;&gt;Holland, Robert (1991) ''Fontana History of England – Britain &amp; the World Role''&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Economic Community (EEC)===
{{more citations needed section|date=June 2016}}

France, experiencing the disintegration of its [[French colonial Empire|colonial empire]] and severe problems in Algeria, turned towards Europe after the [[Suez Crisis]], and to West Germany in particular.&lt;ref name=&quot;FontanaHistory&quot; /&gt; In the years after, the economies of both nations integrated and they led the drive towards European unity.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

One of the conditions of Marshall Aid was that the nations' leaders must co-ordinate economic efforts and pool the supply of raw materials. By far the most critical commodities in driving growth were coal and steel. France assumed it would receive large amounts of high-quality German coal from the Ruhr as reparations for the war, but the US refused to allow this, fearing a repetition of the bitterness after the Treaty of Versailles which partly caused World War II.&lt;ref name=Macksey/&gt;

Under the inspiration of the French statesmen [[Jean Monnet]] and [[Robert Schuman]], together with the German leader [[Konrad Adenauer]], the rift between the two nations had begun to heal and in 1951, along with Italy and the [[Benelux]] countries, they formed the [[European Coal and Steel Community]]. Following the [[Treaty of Rome]] of 1957 this became the [[European Economic Community]].

De Gaulle had not been instrumental in setting up the new organization and, from the start, he opposed efforts by fellow EEC member countries to move toward some form of political integration that, in de Gaulle's thinking, would impinge on the sovereignty of France, both internally and externally. To counter those supranational tendencies that he disparaged,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw3U4Tbp7fQ|title=De Gaulle avait compris avant tout le monde que l'UE était une arnaque|date=23 March 2014|accessdate=14 January 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; he put forward in 1961 the so-called [[Fouchet Plan]] that maintained all decision-making powers in the hands of governments, reducing the projected European parliamentary assembly to a mere consultative assembly. As expected, the plan was rejected by France's partners. In July 1965 de Gaulle provoked a major six-month crisis when he ordered the boycott of EEC institutions (see ''Empty chair crisis'' below) until his demands – the withdrawal of a European Commission proposal to reinforce the community institutions to the detriment of national sovereignty, and the acceptance of France's proposal regarding the financing of the newly established Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) – were met with the [[Luxembourg compromise]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

[[File:Charles de Gaulle con Arturo Frondizi.jpg|thumb|Charles de Gaulle and Argentine president [[Arturo Frondizi]]]]

De Gaulle, who in spite of recent history admired Germany and spoke excellent German,&lt;ref name=&quot;Debray&quot;&gt;[[Régis Debray]] (1994) ''Charles de Gaulle: Futurist of the Nation'' translated by John Howe, Verso, New York, {{ISBN|0-86091-622-7}}; a translation of Debray, Régis (1990) ''A demain de Gaulle'' Gallimard, Paris, {{ISBN|2-07-072021-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as English,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ihZkpI3n5hIC&amp;pg=PA38|title=Charles de Gaulle's Legacy of Ideas|work=google.fr|accessdate=14 January 2016|isbn=9780739164549|last1=Rowland|first1=Benjamin M.|date=2011-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; established a good relationship with the aging West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer—culminating in the [[Elysee Treaty]] in 1963—and in the first few years of the Common Market, France's industrial exports to the other five members tripled and its farm export almost quadrupled. The franc became a solid, stable currency for the first time in half a century, and the economy mostly boomed. Adenauer however, all too aware of the importance of American support in Europe, gently distanced himself from the general's more extreme ideas, wanting no suggestion that any new European community would in any sense challenge or set itself at odds with the US. In Adenauer's eyes, the support of the US was more important than any question of European prestige.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIME-8 August 1960&quot;&gt;''Time'', 8 August 1960&lt;/ref&gt; Adenauer was also anxious to reassure Britain that nothing was being done behind its back and was quick to inform British Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] of any new developments.

Great Britain initially declined to join the EEC, preferring to remain with another organisation known as the [[European Free Trade Area]], mostly consisting of the northern European countries and Portugal. By the late 1950s German and French living standards began to exceed those in Britain, and the government of Harold Macmillan, realising that the EEC was a stronger trade bloc than EFTA, began negotiations to join.

De Gaulle vetoed the British application to join the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) in 1963, famously uttering the single word 'non' into the television cameras at the critical moment, a statement used to sum up French opposition towards Britain for many years afterwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;R+Q&quot;&gt;Richards, Denis &amp; Quick, Antony (1974) ''Twentieth Century Britain''&lt;/ref&gt; Macmillan said afterwards that he always believed that de Gaulle would prevent Britain joining, but thought he would do it quietly, behind the scenes. He later complained privately that &quot;all our plans are in tatters&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;FontanaHistory&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Fpdegaulle.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Iranian Empress [[Farah Pahlavi]] meeting with Charles de Gaulle in France, 1961]]

American President [[John F. Kennedy]] urged de Gaulle to accept the United Kingdom in the EEC, stating that a Europe without Great Britain would create a situation in which the United States were bearing the enormous costs of Europe's protection without any voice. Kennedy applied pressure to de Gaulle by threatening to withdraw American troops from European soil, but de Gaulle believed that the United States would lose the [[Cold War]] if they were to leave Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yltz0aCPaM4C&amp;pg=PA106|title=Between Empire and Alliance|work=google.be|accessdate=14 January 2016|isbn=9780742521773|last1=Trachtenberg|first1=Marc|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It encouraged de Gaulle to see Great Britain as America's &quot;[[Trojan Horse]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biographie 1962–1968: la consolidation du régime|url=http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=375|work=Fondation Charles de Gaulle|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522001018/http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=375|archivedate=22 May 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Prime Minister Churchill once said to him that if he had the choice between France and the United States, he would always choose the United States. Churchill's successor, Macmillan, prioritised the rebuilding of the Anglo-American &quot;[[Special Relationship]]&quot;. With the American agreement to supply Britain with the Skybolt nuclear missile, de Gaulle thought that the United Kingdom would not go along with his vision for a West European strategically independent from the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;ECC&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=How the EU was built|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1055729.stm|work=BBC News|date=5 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Antoine Capet|author2=Aïssatou Sy-Wonyu|title=The &quot;special Relationship&quot;|year=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QpHzjq-KqnkC&amp;pg=PA218|publisher=Publication Univ Rouen Havre|isbn=978-2-87775-862-8|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained there were incompatibilities between continental European and British economic interests. In addition, he demanded that the United Kingdom accept all the conditions laid down by the six existing members of the EEC (Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands) and revoke its commitments to countries within its own free trade area (which France had not done with its own). He supported a deepening and an acceleration of Common Market integration rather than an expansion.&lt;ref name=&quot;veto&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=European NAvigator (ENA) – General de Gaulle's first veto|url=http://www.ena.lu/general_gaulle_veto-020100862.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in this latter respect, a detailed study of the formative years of the EEC argues that the defence of French economic interests, especially in agriculture, in fact played a more dominant role in determining de Gaulle's stance towards British entry than the various political and foreign policy considerations that have often been cited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moravscik|first=Andrew|title=The Choice for Europe: Social Purpose and State Power from Messina to Maastricht|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8014-3509-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dean Acheson believed that Britain made a grave error in not signing up to the European idea right from the start, and that they continued to suffer the political consequences for at least two decades afterwards. However he also stated his belief that de Gaulle used the 'Common Market' (as it was then termed) as an &quot;exclusionary device to direct European trade towards the interest of France and against that of the United States, Britain and other countries.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Presentat&quot;&gt;''Present at the Creation: My Years in the State Department'' – Dean Acheson 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

Claiming continental European solidarity, de Gaulle again rejected British entry when they next applied to join the community in December 1967 under the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] leadership of [[Harold Wilson]]. During negotiations, de Gaulle chided Britain for relying too much on the Americans, saying that sooner or later they would always do what was in their best interests. Wilson said he then gently raised the spectre of the threat of a newly powerful Germany as a result of the EEC, which de Gaulle agreed was a risk.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Wilson Autobiography&lt;/ref&gt; After de Gaulle left office the United Kingdom applied again and finally became a member of the EEC in January 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Just a Normal Winter's Day in Dover|newspaper=The Times|date=2 January 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition of the People's Republic of China===

In January 1964, France was, after the UK, among the first of the major Western powers to open diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC), which was established in 1949 and which was isolated on the international scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;atimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/KA08Ad01.html|title=Asia Times Online :: China News, China Business News, Taiwan and Hong KongNews and Business.|work=Asia Times|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By recognizing [[Mao Zedong]]'s government, de Gaulle signaled to both Washington and Moscow that France intended to deploy an independent foreign policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;atimes.com&quot;/&gt; The move was criticized in the United States as it seemed to seriously damage US policy of [[containment]] in Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;atimes.com&quot;/&gt; De Gaulle justified this action by &quot;the weight of evidence and reason&quot;, considering that China's demographic weight and geographic extent put it in a position to have a global leading role.&lt;ref name=&quot;atimes.com&quot;/&gt; De Gaulle also used this opportunity to arouse rivalry between the USSR and China, a policy that was followed several years later by [[Henry Kissinger]]'s &quot;triangular diplomacy&quot; which also aimed to create a Sino-Soviet split.&lt;ref name=&quot;atimes.com&quot;/&gt;

France established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China – the first step towards formal recognition without first severing links with the Republic of China (Taiwan), led by [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Hitherto the PRC had insisted that all nations abide by a &quot;one China&quot; condition, and at first it was unclear how the matter would be settled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Recognition of Peking by France – Relations with two regimes – Chiang protest but no break|newspaper=The Times|date=28 January 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the agreement to exchange ambassadors was subject to a delay of three months, and in February, Chiang Kai-shek resolved the problem by cutting off diplomatic relations with France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chiang Breaks with France|newspaper=The Times|date=11 February 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight years later, US President [[Richard Nixon]] [[Nixon visit to China 1972|visited the PRC]] and began normalising relations—a policy which was confirmed in the [[Shanghai Communiqué]] of 28 February 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nixon's China's Visit and &quot;Sino-U.S. Joint Communiqué|url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/ziliao/3602/3604/t18006.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visit to Latin America===
[[File:Illiadegaulle.jpg|thumb|De Gaulle and Argentine president [[Arturo Illia]] in 1964]]

During the autumn of 1964, de Gaulle embarked on a grueling 20,000-mile trek across Latin America despite being a month away from his 75th birthday, a recent operation for [[prostate cancer]], and concerns over security. He had visited Mexico the previous year and spoke, in Spanish, to the Mexican people on the eve of their celebrations of their independence at the [[National Palace (Mexico)|Palacio Nacional]] in Mexico City. During his new 26-day visit, he was again keen to gain both cultural and economic influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gen. De Gaulle Takes His Legend To S.

===US dollar crisis===

In the [[Bretton Woods system]] put in place in 1944, US dollars were convertible to gold. In France, it was called &quot;[[Exorbitant privilege|America's exorbitant privilege]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.fr&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Barry Eichengreen|title=Exorbitant Privilege: The Rise and Fall of the Dollar and the Future of the International Monetary System|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TIlpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-978148-5|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it resulted in an &quot;asymmetric financial system&quot; where foreigners &quot;see themselves supporting American living standards and subsidizing American multinationals&quot;. As American economist [[Barry Eichengreen]] summarized: &quot;It costs only a few cents for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to produce a $100 bill, but other countries had to pony up $100 of actual goods in order to obtain one&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.fr&quot;/&gt; In February 1965 President Charles de Gaulle announced his intention to exchange its US dollar reserves for gold at the official exchange rate. He sent the French Navy across the Atlantic to pick up the French reserve of gold, which had been moved there during World War II, and was followed by several countries. As it resulted in considerably reducing US gold stock and US economic influence, it led US President [[Richard Nixon]] to unilaterally end the convertibility of the dollar to gold on 15 August 1971 (the &quot;[[Nixon Shock]]&quot;). This was meant to be a temporary measure but the dollar became permanently a floating [[fiat money]] and in October 1976, the US government officially changed the definition of the dollar; references to gold were removed from statutes.&lt;ref&gt;Eugène White, Dominique Simard, Michael Bordo, ''La France et le système monétaire de Bretton Woods '' [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/ecofi_0987-3368_1993_num_26_3_2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Margaret Garritsen De Vries|title=The International Monetary Fund, 1966–1971|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5oUS9M1kzOEC&amp;pg=PA61|year=1976|publisher=International Monetary Fund|isbn=978-0-939934-09-6|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second term==
In December 1965, de Gaulle [[1965 French presidential election|returned as president for a second seven-year term]]. In the first round he did not win the expected majority, receiving 45% of the vote. Both of his main rivals did better than expected; the leftist [[François Mitterrand]] received 32% and [[Jean Lecanuet]], who advocated for what ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' described as &quot;Gaullism without de Gaulle&quot;, received 16%.&lt;ref name=&quot;life19651217&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HUwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA4|title=De Gaulle Has an Opposition|work=Life|date=17 December 1965|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle won a majority in the second round, with Mitterrand receiving 44.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=France Again Elects Gen.

In September 1966, in a famous speech in [[Phnom Penh]] in Cambodia, he expressed France's disapproval of the US involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], calling for a US withdrawal from Vietnam as the only way to ensure peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Allocution prononcée à la réunion populaire de Phnom-Penh, 1er septembre 1966|trans-title=Address by the President of the French Republic (General de Gaulle), Phnom Penh, Cambodia, 1 September 1966|publisher=Fondation Charles de Gaulle|year=2008|url=http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=530|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118225154/http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=530|archivedate=18 November 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle considered the war to be the &quot;greatest absurdity of the twentieth century&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gowland, David; Turner, Arthur: [https://books.google.com/books?id=q0WgBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA166 Reluctant Europeans: Britain and European Integration, 1945–1998], Routledge, p. 166.

Ball later sent a 76-page memorandum to Johnson critiquing Johnson's current Vietnam policy in October 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Karnow p. 405&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle later visited [[Guadeloupe]] for two days, in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Inez]], bringing aid which totaled billions of [[francs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legendshub.com/politics/gaulle/second.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316025030/http://www.legendshub.com/politics/gaulle/second.html |archivedate=16 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Empty Chair Crisis===

During the establishment of the [[European Community]], de Gaulle helped precipitate the Empty Chair Crisis, one of the greatest crises in the history of the EEC. It involved the financing of the [[Common Agricultural Policy]], but almost more importantly the use of [[qualified majority voting]] in the EC (as opposed to unanimity). In June 1965, after France and the other five members could not agree, de Gaulle withdrew France's representatives from the EC. Their absence left the organisation essentially unable to run its affairs until the [[Luxembourg compromise]] was reached in January 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=France Ends Boycott of Common Market – No Winners or Losers after Midnight Agreement|newspaper=The Times|date=31 January 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle succeeded in influencing the decision-making mechanism written into the Treaty of Rome by insisting on solidarity founded on mutual understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=De Gaulle and Europe|work=Fondation Charles de Gaulle|url=http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=178|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061118185240/http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=178|archivedate=18 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He vetoed Britain's entry into the EEC a second time, in June 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European NAvigator (ENA) – General de Gaulle's second veto|url=http://www.ena.lu/general_gaulles_second_veto-020102622.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the War of 1812, and the concurrent [[Red Stick War]], the U.S. government persuaded several groups of Cherokee to a voluntary removal to the Arkansaw Territory.  These were the 
&quot;[[Old Settlers]]&quot;, the first of the Cherokee to make their way to what would eventually become [[Indian Territory]] (modern day [[Oklahoma]]).  This effort was headed by Indian Agent [[Return J. Meigs Sr.|Return J. Meigs]], and was finalized with the signing of the [[Jackson and McMinn Treaty]], giving the Old Settlers undisputed title to the lands designated for their use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tenn&quot;&gt;[https://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entries/treaties/ ''Treaties'']; Tennessee Encyclopedia, online; accessed October 2019&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, Georgia focused on removing the Cherokee's neighbors, the [[Muscogee (Creek)|Lower Creek]].  Georgia Governor [[George Troup]] and his cousin [[William McIntosh]], chief of the Lower Creek, signed the [[Treaty of Indian Springs (1825)|Treaty of Indian Springs]] in 1825, ceding the last [[Muscogee (Creek)]] lands claimed by Georgia.  The state's northwestern border reached the [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]], the border of the Cherokee Nation.  In 1829, gold was discovered at [[Dahlonega, Georgia|Dahlonega]], on Cherokee land claimed by Georgia.  The [[Georgia Gold Rush]] was the first in U.S. history, and state officials demanded that the federal government expel the Cherokee.  When [[Andrew Jackson]] was inaugurated as President in 1829, Georgia gained a strong ally in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].  In 1830 Congress passed the [[Indian Removal Act]], authorizing the forcible relocation of American Indians east of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] to a new Indian Territory.

Jackson claimed the removal policy was an effort to prevent the Cherokee from facing extinction as a people, which he considered the fate that &quot;...the [[Mohegan]], the [[Narragansett tribe|Narragansett]], and the [[Lenape|Delaware]]&quot; had suffered.&lt;ref&gt;Wishart, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;  There is, however, ample evidence that the Cherokee were adapting to modern farming techniques.  A modern analysis shows that the area was in general in a state of economic surplus and could have accommodated both the Cherokee and new settlers.&lt;ref&gt;Wishart 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cherokee brought their grievances to a US judicial review that set a precedent in [[Indian country]].  John Ross traveled to Washington, D.C., and won support from [[National Republican Party]] leaders [[Henry Clay]] and [[Daniel Webster]]. [[Samuel Worcester]] campaigned on behalf of the Cherokee in New England, where their cause was taken up by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (see [[Emerson's letter to Martin Van Buren|Emerson's 1838 letter to Martin Van Buren]]). In June 1830, a delegation led by Chief Ross defended Cherokee rights before the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]]''.

In 1831 Georgia militia arrested [[Samuel Worcester]] for residing on Indian lands without a state permit, imprisoning him in [[Milledgeville, Georgia|Milledgeville]].  In ''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]'' (1832), the US [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[Chief Justice]] [[John Marshall]] ruled that American Indian nations were &quot;distinct, independent political communities retaining their original natural rights,&quot; and entitled to federal protection from the actions of state governments that infringed on their [[sovereignty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2720 |title=New Georgia Encyclopedia: &quot;Worcester v. Georgia (1832)&quot; |publisher=Georgiaencyclopedia.org |date=April 27, 2004 |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Worcester v. Georgia'' is considered one of the most important dicta in law dealing with Native Americans.

Jackson ignored the Supreme Court's ruling, as he needed to conciliate Southern sectionalism during the era of the [[Nullification Crisis]]. His landslide reelection in 1832 emboldened calls for Cherokee removal. Georgia sold Cherokee lands to its citizens in a [[Georgia Land Lottery|Land Lottery]], and the state militia occupied [[New Echota]].  The Cherokee National Council, led by John Ross, fled to [[Red Clay State Park|Red Clay]], a remote valley north of Georgia's land claim. Ross had the support of Cherokee traditionalists, who could not imagine removal from their ancestral lands.

A small group known as the &quot;Ridge Party&quot; or the &quot;Treaty Party&quot; saw relocation as inevitable and believed the Cherokee Nation needed to make the best deal to preserve their rights in Indian Territory. Led by [[Major Ridge]], [[John Ridge]] and [[Elias Boudinot (Cherokee)|Elias Boudinot]], they represented the Cherokee elite, whose homes, plantations and businesses were confiscated, or under threat of being taken by white squatters with Georgia land-titles. With capital to acquire new lands, they were more inclined to accept relocation. On December 29, 1835, the &quot;Ridge Party&quot; signed the [[Treaty of New Echota]], stipulating terms and conditions for the removal of the Cherokee Nation. In return for their lands, the Cherokee were promised a large tract in the [[Indian Territory]], $5 million, and $300,000 for improvements on their new lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ourgeorgiahistory.com/documents/treaty_of_new_echota.html |title=Treaty of New Echota, Dec. 29, 1835 (Cherokee – United States) |publisher=Ourgeorgiahistory.com |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Ross gathered over 15,000 signatures for a petition to the U.S. Senate, insisting that the treaty was invalid because it did not have the support of the majority of the Cherokee people.  The Senate passed the Treaty of New Echota by a one-vote margin.  It was enacted into law in May 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngeorgia.com/history/cherokeehistory7.html |title=Cherokee in Georgia: Treaty of New Echota |publisher=Ngeorgia.com |date=June 5, 2007 |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later President [[Martin Van Buren]] ordered 7,000 Federal troops and state militia under General [[Winfield Scott]] into Cherokee lands to evict the tribe. Over 16,000 Cherokee were forcibly relocated westward to [[Indian Territory]] in 1838–1839, a migration known as the [[Trail of Tears]] or in Cherokee {{lang|chr|ᏅᎾ ᏓᎤᎳ ᏨᏱ}} or {{lang|chr|Nvna Daula Tsvyi}} (''The Trail Where They Cried''), although it is described by another word {{lang|chr|Tlo-va-sa}} (''The Removal''). Marched over {{convert|800|mi|km}} across [[Tennessee]], [[Kentucky]], [[Illinois]], [[Missouri]] and [[Arkansas]], the people suffered from disease, exposure and starvation, and as many as 4,000 died.&lt;ref&gt;Georgia Historic Marker, New Echota, 1958&lt;/ref&gt; As some Cherokees were slaveholders, they took [[slavery|enslaved]] African Americans with them west of the Mississippi. Intermarried European Americans and [[missionaries]] also walked the Trail of Tears. Ross preserved a vestige of independence by negotiating permission for the Cherokee to conduct their own removal under U.S. supervision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/225917.Alex_W_Bealer|title=Books by Alex W. Bealer|publisher=goodreads.com, 1972 and 1996|accessdate=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In keeping with the tribe's &quot;blood law&quot; that prescribed the death penalty for Cherokee who sold lands, Ross's son arranged the murder of the leaders of the &quot;Treaty Party&quot;. On June 22, 1839, a party of twenty-five Ross supporters assassinated Major Ridge, John Ridge and Elias Boudinot.  The party included Daniel Colston, John Vann, Archibald, James and Joseph Spear. Boudinot's brother [[Stand Watie]] fought and survived that day, escaping to [[Arkansas]].

In 1827, [[Sequoyah]] had led a delegation of Old Settlers to Washington, D.C. to negotiate for the exchange of Arkansas land for land in Indian Territory. After the Trail of Tears, he helped mediate divisions between the Old Settlers and the rival factions of the more recent arrivals. In 1839, as President of the Western Cherokee, Sequoyah signed an Act of Union with John Ross that reunited the two groups of the Cherokee Nation.

=====Eastern Band=====
[[File:Cól-lee, a Band Chief.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cól-lee, a Band Chief, painted by [[George Catlin]], 1834]]

The Cherokee living along the [[Oconaluftee River]] in the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] were the most conservative and isolated from European–American settlements. They rejected the reforms of the Cherokee Nation.  When the Cherokee government ceded all territory east of the [[Little Tennessee River]] to [[North Carolina]] in 1819, they withdrew from the Nation.&lt;ref&gt;Theda Purdue, ''Native Carolinians: The Indians of North Carolina'', pg. 40&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Holland Thomas]], a white store owner and state legislator from [[Jackson County, North Carolina]], helped over 600 Cherokee from [[Cherokee, North Carolina|Qualla Town]] obtain North Carolina citizenship, which exempted them from forced removal. Over 400 Cherokee either hid from Federal troops in the remote Snowbird Mountains, under the leadership of [[Tsali]] ({{lang|chr|ᏣᎵ}}),&lt;ref name=Tsali&gt;[http://www.cherokee-nc.com/history.php?Name=Tsali &quot;Tsali.&quot;] ''History and culture of the Cherokee (North Carolina Indians).'' (March 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; or belonged to the former Valley Towns area around the [[Cheoah River]] who negotiated with the state government to stay in North Carolina. An additional 400 Cherokee stayed on reserves in Southeast Tennessee, North Georgia, and Northeast Alabama, as citizens of their respective states.  They were mostly mixed-race and Cherokee women married to white men. Together, these groups were the ancestors of the federally recognized [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]], and some of the state-recognized tribes in surrounding states.

====Civil War====
[[File:Cherokee Confederates Reunion.gif|right|325px|thumb|Cherokee confederates reunion in [[New Orleans]], 1902.]]

{{Further|Cherokee in the American Civil War|Native Americans in the Civil War}}
The [[American Civil War]] was devastating for both East and Western Cherokee. The Eastern Band, aided by [[William Holland Thomas|William Thomas]], became the Thomas Legion of Cherokee Indians and Highlanders, fighting for the Confederacy in the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name=Will_Thomas&gt;[http://www.cherokee-nc.com/history.php?Name=Will%20Thomas &quot;Will Thomas.&quot;] ''History and culture of the Cherokee (North Carolina Indians).'' (March 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Cherokee in Indian Territory divided into Union and Confederate factions.

[[Stand Watie]], the leader of the Ridge Party, raised a regiment for [[Confederate Army|Confederate]] service in 1861. [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]], who had reluctantly agreed to ally with the Confederacy, was captured by Federal troops in 1862. He lived in a self-imposed exile in [[Philadelphia]], supporting the Union. In the Indian Territory, the national council of those who supported the Union voted to abolish slavery in the Cherokee Nation in 1863, but they were not the majority slaveholders and the vote had little effect on those supporting the Confederacy.

Watie was elected Principal Chief of the pro-Confederacy majority. A master of hit-and-run cavalry tactics, Watie fought those Cherokee loyal to John Ross and Federal troops in [[Indian Territory]] and [[Arkansas]], capturing Union supply trains and [[steamboats]], and saving a Confederate army by covering their retreat after the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]] in March 1862. He became a Brigadier General of the [[Confederate States]]; the only other American Indian to hold the rank in the American Civil War was [[Ely S. Parker]] with the Union Army.  On June 25, 1865, two months after [[Robert E. Lee]] surrendered at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox]], Stand Watie became the last Confederate General to stand down.

====Reconstruction and late 19th century====
[[File:Group of Cherokee, Yankton, and Sisseton 1909.jpg|thumb|left|William Penn (Cherokee), His Shield (Yanktonai), Levi Big Eagle (Yanktonai), Bear Ghost (Yanktonai) and Black Moustache (Sisseton).]]
After the Civil War, the U.S. government required the Cherokee Nation to sign a new treaty, because of its alliance with the Confederacy. The U.S. required the 1866 Treaty to provide for the [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]] of all Cherokee slaves, and full citizenship to all Cherokee [[freedmen]] and all African Americans who chose to continue to reside within tribal lands, so that they &quot;shall have all the rights of native Cherokees.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/VOL2/treaties/che0942.htm &quot;Treaty with the Cherokee, 1866.&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630013134/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/VOL2/treaties/che0942.htm |date=June 30, 2010 }} ''Oklahoma Historical Society: Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties. Vol. 2, Treaties.'' (retrieved January 10, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Both before and after the Civil War, some Cherokee intermarried or had relationships with African Americans, just as they had with whites. Many Cherokee Freedmen have been active politically within the tribe.

The US government also acquired [[easement]] rights to the western part of the territory, which became the [[Oklahoma Territory]], for the construction of railroads. Development and settlers followed the railroads. By the late 19th century, the government believed that Native Americans would be better off if each family owned its own land. The [[Dawes Act]] of 1887 provided for the breakup of commonly held tribal land into individual household allotments. Native Americans were registered on the Dawes Rolls and allotted land from the common reserve. The U.S. government counted the remainder of tribal land as &quot;surplus&quot; and sold it to non-Cherokee individuals.

The [[Curtis Act of 1898]] dismantled tribal governments, courts, schools, and other civic institutions. For Indian Territory, this meant abolition of the Cherokee courts and governmental systems. This was seen as necessary before the Oklahoma and Indian territories could be admitted as a combined state. In 1905, the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] of the [[Indian Territory]] proposed the creation of the [[State of Sequoyah]] as one to be exclusively Native American, but failed to gain support in Washington, D.C.. In 1907, the [[Oklahoma Territory|Oklahoma]] and [[Indian Territory|Indian Territories]] entered the union as the state of [[Oklahoma]].

By the late 19th century, the Eastern Band of Cherokee were laboring under the constraints of a [[Racial segregation|segregated]] society. In the aftermath of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], conservative white Democrats regained power in North Carolina and other southern states. They proceeded to effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)|disenfranchise]] all blacks and many poor whites by new constitutions and laws related to voter registration and elections. They passed [[Jim Crow laws]] that divided society into &quot;white&quot; and &quot;colored&quot;, mostly to control freedmen. Cherokee and other Native Americans were classified on the colored side and suffered the same racial segregation and disenfranchisement as former slaves. They also often lost their historical documentation for identification as Indians, when the Southern states classified them as colored.  Blacks and Native Americans would not have their constitutional rights as U.S. citizens enforced until after the [[Civil Rights Movement]] secured passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s, and the federal government began to monitor voter registration and elections, as well as other programs.

====Tribal land jurisdiction status====
On July 9, 2020, the [[United States Supreme Court]] decided half of the land of the state of Oklahoma made up of tribal nations like the Cherokee are officially Native American tribal land jurisdictions. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/2020/07/09/889562040/supreme-court-rules-that-about-half-of-oklahoma-is-indian-land&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==

===Cultural institutions===
The [[Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual]], Inc., of [[Cherokee, North Carolina]] is the oldest continuing Native American art co-operative. They were founded in 1946 to provide a venue for traditional Eastern Band Cherokee artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quallaartsandcrafts.org/history.php Qualla History.] . Retrieved September 15, 09.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Museum of the Cherokee Indian]], also in Cherokee, displays permanent and changing exhibits, houses archives and collections important to Cherokee history, and sponsors cultural groups, such as the Warriors of the AniKituhwa dance group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cherokeemuseum.org/ The Museum of the Cherokee Indian.] . Retrieved September 15, 09.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]] entered into a partnership with [[Southwestern Community College (North Carolina)|Southwestern Community College]] and [[Western Carolina University]] to create the [[Oconaluftee Institute for Cultural Arts]] (OICA), to emphasize native art and culture in traditional fine arts education. This is intended both to preserve traditional art forms and encourage exploration of contemporary ideas. Located in Cherokee, OICA offered an associate's degree program.&lt;ref name=&quot;SCC&quot;&gt;[http://www.southwesterncc.edu/news/06-jul-dec/EBCI-cultural-arts-inst.htm &quot;Announcement of the founding of the Oconaluftee Institute for Cultural Arts in Cherokee&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527225133/http://www.southwesterncc.edu/news/06-jul-dec/EBCI-cultural-arts-inst.htm |date=May 27, 2010 }}, Southwestern Community College (retrieved November 24, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, OICA acquired a letterpress and had the [[Cherokee syllabary]] recast to begin printing one-of-a-kind fine art books and prints in the [[Cherokee language]].&lt;ref name=&quot;letterpress&quot;&gt;[http://www.nc-cherokee.com/theonefeather/2010/08/13/new-letterpress-arrives-at-oica/ &quot;New Letterpress Arrives at OICA&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714161021/http://www.nc-cherokee.com/theonefeather/2010/08/13/new-letterpress-arrives-at-oica/ |date=July 14, 2011 }}, ''The One Feather'' (retrieved November 24, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the Fine Art degree program at OICA was incorporated into [[Southwestern Community College (North Carolina)|Southwestern Community College]] and moved to the SCC Swain Center, where it continues to operate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moved&quot;&gt;[http://theonefeather.com/2012/11/oica-is-gone-but-not-really/ &quot;OICA is gone, but not really&quot;], ''The One Feather'' (retrieved March 18, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cherokee Heritage Center]], of [[Park Hill, Oklahoma]] is the site of a reproduction of an ancient Cherokee village, Adams Rural Village (including 19th-century buildings), Nofire Farms, and the Cherokee Family Research Center for genealogy.&lt;ref name=CHC&gt;{{cite web| title = Cherokee Heritage Center | url = http://www.cherokeeheritage.org | accessdate =March 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cherokee Heritage Center also houses the Cherokee National Archives. Both the [[Cherokee Nation]] (of Oklahoma) and the [[United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee]], as well as other tribes, contribute funding to the CHC.

===Marriage===
Before the 19th century, [[polygamy]] was common among the Cherokee, especially by elite men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perdue 1999, p. 176&quot;&gt;Perdue (1999), p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; The [[matrilineal]] culture meant that women controlled property, such as their dwellings, and their children were considered born into their mother's [[clan]], where they gained hereditary status.  Advancement to leadership positions was generally subject to approval by the women elders.  In addition, the society was [[matrifocal]]; customarily, a married couple lived with or near the woman's family, so she could be aided by her female relatives.  Her oldest brother was a more important mentor to her sons than was their father, who belonged to another clan. Traditionally, couples, particularly women, can divorce freely.&lt;ref&gt;Perdue (1999), pp. 44, 57–8&lt;/ref&gt;

It was unusual for a Cherokee man to marry a European-American woman.  The children of such a union were disadvantaged, as they would not belong to the nation.  They would be born outside the clans and traditionally were not considered Cherokee citizens. This is because of the matrilineal aspect of Cherokee culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perdue 1999, p. 176&quot;/&gt; As the Cherokee began to adopt some elements of European-American culture in the early 19th century, they sent elite young men, such as [[John Ridge]] and [[Elias Boudinot (Cherokee)|Elias Boudinot]] to American schools for education. After Ridge had married a European-American woman from Connecticut and Boudinot was engaged to another, the Cherokee Council in 1825 passed a law making children of such unions full citizens of the tribe, as if their mothers were Cherokee. This was a way to protect the families of men expected to be leaders of the tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yarbough |first=Fay |s2cid=144646968 |title=Legislating Women's Sexuality: Cherokee Marriage Laws |journal=Journal of Social History |volume=38 |year=2004 |issue=2 |pages=385–406 [p. 388] |doi=10.1353/jsh.2004.0144 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late nineteenth century, the U.S. government put new restrictions on marriage between a Cherokee and non-Cherokee, although it was still relatively common. A European-American man could legally marry a Cherokee woman by petitioning the federal court, after gaining approval of ten of her blood relatives.  Once married, the man had status as an &quot;Intermarried White,&quot; a member of the Cherokee tribe with restricted rights; for instance, he could not hold any tribal office. He remained a citizen of and under the laws of the United States. [[Common law marriage]]s were more popular. Such &quot;Intermarried Whites&quot; were listed in a separate category on the registers of the [[Dawes Rolls]], prepared for allotment of plots of land to individual households of members of the tribe, in the early twentieth-century federal policy for [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of the Native Americans.

===Ethnobotany===

=== Gender roles ===
Men and women have historically played important yet, at times, different roles in Cherokee society. Historically, these roles have tended to support the idea of a balanced [[gender binary]], with gender determining social and ceremonial roles. Historically, women have primarily been the heads of households, owning the home and the land, farmers of the family's land, and &quot;mothers&quot; of the [[clan]]s. As in many [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] cultures, Cherokee women are honored as life-givers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1954047274/|title=Sons of Selu: Masculinity and Gendered Power in Cherokee Society, 1775-1846 - ProQuest|website=search.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=2019-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As givers and nurturers of life via childbirth and the growing of plants, and community leaders as clan mothers, women are traditionally community leaders in Cherokee communities. Some have served as warriors, both historically and in contemporary culture in military service. Cherokee women are regarded as tradition-keepers and responsible for cultural preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Connell-Szasz|first=Margaret|date=1999|title=Review of Cherokee Women: Gender and Culture Change, 1700-1835|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=104|issue=5|pages=1659–1660|doi=10.2307/2649389|issn=0002-8762|jstor=2649389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is a record of a non-Native traveler in 1825 noticing what he considered to be &quot;men who assumed the dress and performed the duties of women,&quot;&lt;ref name=Smithers&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SMITHERS|first=GREGORY D.|date=2014|title=Cherokee &quot;Two Spirits&quot;: Gender, Ritual, and Spirituality in the Native South|journal=Early American Studies|volume=12|issue=3|pages=626–651|issn=1543-4273|jstor=24474873}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is a lack of evidence of what would be considered &quot;[[two-spirit]]&quot; individuals in Cherokee society,&lt;ref name=Smithers/&gt; as is generally the case in matriarchal and matrilineal cultures.

The redefining of gender roles in [[Cherokee Nation|Cherokee]] society first occurred in time period between 1776-1835.&lt;ref name=Paulk-Kribel&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paulk-Kriebel|first=Virginia Beth|date=1999|title=Review of Cherokee Women: Gender and Culture Change, 1700-1835|journal=The North Carolina Historical Review|volume=76|issue=1|pages=118–119|issn=0029-2494|jstor=23522191}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period is demarcated by [[The De Soto Explorer|De Soto]] exploration and subsequent invasion, was followed by the American Revolution in 1776, and culminated with the signing of [[Treaty of New Echota]] in 1835. The purpose of this redefinition was to push European social standards and norms on the [[Cherokee Nation|Cherokee]] people.&lt;ref name=Paulk-Kribel/&gt; The long—lasting effect of these practices reorganized Cherokee forms of government towards a male dominated society which has affected the nation for generations.&lt;ref name=Miles&gt;{{Cite book|title=The house on Diamond Hill : a Cherokee plantation story|last=Miles, Tiya, 1970-|date=2010|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|isbn=9780807834183|location=Chapel Hill|oclc=495475390|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/houseondiamondhi00mile}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miles argues white agents were mainly responsible for the shifting of [[Cherokee Nation|Cherokee]] attitudes toward women’s role in politics and domestic spaces.&lt;ref name=Miles/&gt; These &quot;white agents&quot; could be identified as [[Missionary|white missionaries]] and white [[settler]]s seeking out &quot;[[manifest destiny]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Miles/&gt;  By the time of removal in the mid-1830s, Cherokee men and women had begun to fulfill different roles and expectations as defined by the &quot;civilization&quot; program promoted by US presidents [[George Washington|Washington]] and [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]].&lt;ref name=Paulk-Kribel/&gt; 

=== Slavery ===
{{see also|Cherokee Freedmen Controversy#Slavery among the Cherokee}}

Prior to contact with Europeans, slavery was a component of Cherokee society as they took war or raiding captives as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;for a full discussion, see Perdue (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; By their oral tradition, the Cherokee viewed slavery as the result of an individual's failure in warfare and as a temporary status, pending release or the slave's adoption by a tribal family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russell 2002 p70&quot;&gt;Russell (2002) p70&lt;/ref&gt; In colonial times in the early 18th century, the [[English colonial empire|English]] and later the [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] purchased or impressed Cherokee as slaves during the period of the [[Indian Slavery#European enslavement of indigenous people|Indian Slave Trade]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell (2002) p. 70. Ray (2007) p. 423, says that the peak of enslavement of Native Americans was between 1715 and 1717; it ended after the [[American Revolution]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cherokee were among the Native American peoples who sold [[Slavery among Native Americans in the United States|Indian slaves]] to traders for use as laborers in Virginia and further north. They took them as captives in raids on enemy tribes.&lt;ref name=&quot;gallay&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last= Gallay |first= Alan |title= The Indian Slave Trade: The Rise of the English Empire in the American South 1670–1717 |url= https://archive.org/details/indianslavetrade00gall |url-access= registration |year= 2002 |publisher= Yale University Press |isbn= 0-300-10193-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Cherokee began to adopt some Anglo-European customs, they began to purchase [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved African Americans]] to serve as workers on their farms or plantations, which some of the elite families had in the antebellum years. When the Cherokee were forcibly removed on the [[Trail of Tears]], they took slaves with them, and acquired others in [[Indian Territory]].

However, since the fairly recent addition of the Cherokee syllables to [[Unicode]], the Cherokee language is experiencing a renaissance in its use on the Internet.

Because of the polysynthetic nature of the Cherokee language, new and descriptive words in Cherokee are easily constructed to reflect or express modern concepts. Examples include ''ditiyohihi'' ({{lang|chr|ᏗᏘᏲᎯᎯ}}), which means &quot;he argues repeatedly and on purpose with a purpose,&quot; meaning &quot;attorney.&quot; Another example is ''didaniyisgi'' ({{lang|chr|ᏗᏓᏂᏱᏍᎩ}}) which means &quot;the final catcher&quot; or &quot;he catches them finally and conclusively,&quot; meaning &quot;policeman.&quot;

Many words, however, have been borrowed from the English language, such as ''gasoline'', which in Cherokee is {{lang|chr|ga-so-li-ne}} ({{lang|chr|ᎦᏐᎵᏁ}}). Many other words were borrowed from the languages of tribes who settled in Oklahoma in the early 20th century. One example relates to a town in Oklahoma named &quot;Nowata&quot;. The word {{lang|chr|nowata}} is a [[Delaware languages|Delaware Indian]] word for &quot;welcome&quot; (more precisely the Delaware word is {{lang|del|nu-wi-ta}} which can mean &quot;welcome&quot; or &quot;friend&quot; in the Delaware Language). The white settlers of the area used the name &quot;nowata&quot; for the township, and local Cherokees, being unaware the word had its origins in the Delaware Language, called the town ''Amadikanigvnagvna'' ({{lang|chr|ᎠᎹᏗᎧᏂᎬᎾᎬᎾ}})  which means &quot;the water is all gone from here&quot;, i.e. &quot;no water&quot;.

Other examples of borrowed words are {{lang|chr|kawi}} ({{lang|chr|ᎧᏫ}}) for ''coffee'' and {{lang|chr|watsi}} ({{lang|chr|ᏩᏥ}}) for ''watch'' (which led to {{lang|chr|utana watsi}} ({{lang|chr|ᎤᏔᎾ ᏩᏥ}}) or &quot;big watch&quot; for ''clock'').

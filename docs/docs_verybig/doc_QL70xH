[[File:French kings - House of Bourbon (FR) by shakko.jpg|thumb|French kings from House of Bourbon. Family tree]]

===Rise of Henry IV===
{{Main| Henry IV of France's succession}}
The first Bourbon [[king of France]] was [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]].&lt;ref name=&quot;anselme&quot;/&gt; He was born on 13 December 1553 in the [[Kingdom of Navarre]]. [[Antoine de Bourbon]], his father, was a ninth-generation descendant of King [[Louis IX of France]].&lt;ref name=&quot;anselme&quot;/&gt; [[Jeanne d'Albret]], his mother was the Queen of Navarre and niece of King [[Francis I of France]]. He was baptized [[Catholicism|Catholic]], but raised [[Calvinism|Calvinist]]. After his father was killed in 1562, he became [[Duke of Vendôme]] at the age of 10, with Admiral [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Gaspard de Coligny]] (1519–1572) as his regent. Seven years later, the young duke became the nominal leader of the [[Huguenots]] after the death of his uncle the [[Louis I, Prince of Condé|Prince de Condé]] in 1569.

Henry succeeded to Navarre as Henry III when his mother died in 1572. That same year [[Catherine de' Medici]], mother of King [[Charles IX of France]], arranged for the marriage of her daughter, [[Margaret of Valois]], to Henry, ostensibly to advance peace between Catholics and Huguenots. Many Huguenots gathered in Paris for the wedding on 24 August, but were ambushed and slaughtered by Catholics in the [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]]. Henry saved his own life by converting to Catholicism. He repudiated his conversion in 1576 and resumed his leadership of the Huguenots.

The period from 1576 to 1584 was relatively calm in France, with the Huguenots consolidating control of much of the south with only occasional interference from the royal government. Extended civil war erupted again in 1584, when [[François, Duke of Anjou]], younger brother of King [[Henry III of France]], died, leaving Navarre next in line for the throne. Thus began the [[War of the Three Henrys]], as Henry of Navarre, Henry III, and the ultra-Catholic leader, [[Henry I, Duke of Guise|Henry of Guise]], fought a confusing three-cornered struggle for dominance. After Henry III was assassinated on 31 July 1589, Navarre claimed the throne as the first Bourbon king of France, Henry IV.

Much of Catholic France, organized into the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]], refused to recognize a Protestant monarch and instead recognized Henry IV's uncle, [[Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon]], as rightful king, and the civil war continued. Henry won a crucial victory at [[Battle of Ivry|Ivry]] on 14 March 1590 and, following the death of the Cardinal the same year, the forces of the League lacked an obvious Catholic candidate for the throne and divided into various factions. Nevertheless, as a Protestant, Henry IV was unable to take Paris, a Catholic stronghold, or to decisively defeat his enemies, now supported by the Spanish. He reconverted to Catholicism in 1593—he is said to have remarked, &quot;Paris is well worth a mass&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, Leonie, ''Catherine de Medici''&lt;/ref&gt;—and was crowned king retroactively to 1589 at the [[Cathedral of Chartres]] on 27 February 1594.

===Early Bourbons in France===

Henry granted the [[Edict of Nantes]] on 13 April 1598, establishing Catholicism as an official state religion but also granting the Huguenots a measure of religious tolerance and political freedom short of full equality with the practice of Catholicism. This compromise ended the religious wars in France. That same year the [[Treaty of Vervins]] ended the war with Spain, adjusted the Spanish-French border, and resulted in a belated recognition by Spain of Henry as king of France.

Ably assisted by [[Maximilien de Béthune, duc de Sully]], Henry reduced the land tax known as the ''[[taille]]''; promoted agriculture, public works, construction of highways, and the first French canal; started such important industries as the tapestry works of the [[Gobelins manufactory|Gobelins]]; and intervened in favor of Protestants in the duchies and earldoms along the German frontier. This last was to be the cause of his assassination.

[[File:Augustins - Henri IV, roi de France et de Navarre - Jacques Boulbène.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Henry IV of France, the first Bourbon King of France]]
Henry's marriage to Margaret, which had produced no heir, was annulled in 1599 and he married [[Marie de Medici]], niece of the grand duke of Tuscany. A son, Louis, was born to them in 1601. Henry IV was assassinated on 14 May 1610 in Paris. [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] was only nine years old when he succeeded his father.&lt;ref name=&quot;anselme&quot;/&gt; He was to prove a weak ruler; his reign was effectively a series of distinct regimes, depending who held the effective reins of power. At first, Marie de Medici, his mother, served as regent and advanced a pro-Spanish policy. To deal with the financial troubles of France, Louis summoned the [[Estates General (France)|Estates General]] in 1614; this would be the last time that body met until the eve of the [[French Revolution]]. Marie arranged the 1615 marriage of Louis to [[Anne of Austria]], the daughter of King [[Philip III of Spain]].

In 1617, however, Louis conspired with [[Charles de Luynes|Charles d'Albert, duc de Luynes]] to dispense with her influence, having her favorite [[Concino Concini]] assassinated on 26 April of that year. After some years of weak government by Louis's favorites, the King made [[Armand Jean du Plessis, Cardinal Richelieu]], a former protégé of his mother, the chief minister of France in 1624.

Richelieu advanced an anti-[[Habsburg]] policy. He arranged for Louis' sister, [[Henrietta Maria]], to marry King [[Charles I of England]], on 11 May 1625. Her pro-Catholic propaganda in England was one of the contributing factors to the [[English Civil War]]. Richelieu, as ambitious for France and the French monarchy as for himself, laid the ground for the [[absolute monarchy]] that would last in France until the Revolution. He wanted to establish a dominating position for France in Europe, and he wanted to unify France under the monarchy. He established the role of ''[[intendant]]s'', non-noble men whose arbitrary powers of administration were granted (and revocable) by the monarch, superseding many of the traditional duties and privileges of the noble governors.

Although it required a succession of internal military campaigns, he disarmed the fortified Huguenot towns that Henry had allowed. He involved France in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648) against the Habsburgs by [[Treaty of Bärwalde|concluding an alliance with Sweden]] in 1631 and, actively, in 1635. He died in 1642 before the conclusion of that conflict, having groomed Cardinal [[Jules Mazarin]] as a successor. Louis XIII outlived him but by one year, dying in 1643 at the age of forty-two. After a childless marriage for twenty-three years his queen, Anne, delivered a son on 5 September 1638, whom he named Louis after himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;anselme&quot;/&gt; In the mid eighteenth century, the Bourbon monarchy had a faulty system for finance and taxation.  Their lacking a national bank lead to them taking short-term loans, and ordering financial agents to make payments in advance or in excess of tax revenues collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haine|first1=Scott|title=The History of France|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=0-313-30328-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyoffrance00hain/page/65 65]|edition=1st|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/historyoffrance00hain/page/65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Louis XIV and Louis XV===
[[File:Grand Royal Coat of Arms of France &amp; Navarre.svg|right|thumb|upright=0.9 |Royal [[Emblem of France|Coat of arms of the Kingdom of France and Navarre]].]]
{{Main|Louis XIV of France}}
{{Main|Louis XV of France}}
[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] succeeded his father at four years of age;&lt;ref name=&quot;anselme&quot;/&gt; he would go on to become the most powerful king in French history. His mother Anne served as his regent with her favorite Jules, Cardinal Mazarin, as chief minister. At age 7 [[Nicolas de Neufville de Villeroy|Nicolas V de Villeroy]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/merimee_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&amp;FIELD_1=REF&amp;VALUE_1=PA00085842  Hotel de Villeroy listed as a historic monument]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://villeroy-bourbon.com/louisxiv/  The childhood of Louis XIV et the Hôtel de Villeroy]&lt;/ref&gt; became the teacher of the young king. The main childhood places of Louis XIV were the [[Palais-Royal]] and the nearby [[Hôtel de Villeroy]]. Mazarin continued the policies of Richelieu, bringing the Thirty Years' War to a successful conclusion in 1648 and defeating the nobility's challenge to royal absolutism in a series of civil wars known as the [[Fronde]]s. He continued to war with Spain until 1659.

In that year the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] was signed signifying a major shift in power, France had replaced Spain as the dominant state in Europe. The treaty called for an [[arranged marriage]] between Louis and his cousin [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]], a daughter of King [[Philip IV of Spain]] by his first wife Elisabeth, the sister of Louis XIII. They were married in 1660 and had a son, Louis, in 1661.&lt;ref name=&quot;anselme&quot;/&gt; Mazarin died on 9 March 1661 and it was expected that Louis would appoint another chief minister, as had become the tradition, but instead he shocked the country by announcing he would rule alone.

For six years Louis reformed the finances of his state and built formidable armed forces. France fought a series of wars from 1667 onward and gained some territory on its northern and eastern borders. Maria Theresa died in 1683 and the next year he secretly married the devoutly Catholic [[Françoise d'Aubigné, Marquise de Maintenon]]. Louis XIV began to persecute Protestants, undoing the religious tolerance established by his grandfather Henry IV, culminating in his revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685.

The last war waged by Louis XIV proved to be one of the most important to dynastic Europe. In 1700, King [[Charles II of Spain]], a Habsburg, died without a son. Louis's son the ''Grand Dauphin'', as the late king's nephew, was the closest heir, and Charles willed the kingdom to the Dauphin's second son, the Duke of Anjou. Other powers, particularly the Austrian Habsburgs, who had the next closest claims, objected to such a vast increase in French power.

Initially, most of the other powers were willing to accept Anjou's reign as [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], but Louis's mishandling of their concerns soon drove the English, Dutch and other powers to join the Austrians in a coalition against France. The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began in 1701 and raged for 12 years. In the end Louis's grandson was recognized as king of Spain, but he was obliged to agree to the forfeiture of succession rights in France, the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Habsburgs]]' other European territories were largely ceded to Austria, and France was nearly bankrupted by the cost of the struggle. Louis died on 1 September 1715 ending his seventy-two-year reign, the longest in European history.

The reign of Louis XIV was so long that he outlived both his son and eldest grandson. He was succeeded by his great-grandson [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]].&lt;ref name=&quot;anselme&quot;/&gt; Louis XV was born on 15 February 1710 and was thus aged only five at his ascension, the third Louis in a row to become king of France before the age of thirteen (Louis XIII became king at 9, Louis XIV at almost 5 and himself at 5). Initially, the regency was held by [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe, Duke of Orléans]], Louis XIV's nephew, as nearest adult male to the throne.&lt;ref name=&quot;anselme&quot;/&gt; This ''[[Régence]]'' was seen as a period of greater individual expression, manifested in secular, artistic, literary and colonial activity, in contrast to the austere latter years of Louis XIV's reign.

Following Orléans' death in 1723, the [[Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon|Duke of Bourbon]], representative of the Bourbon-Condé cadet line, became prime minister. It was expected that Louis would marry his cousin, the daughter of King Philip V of Spain, but this engagement was broken by the duke in 1725 so that Louis could marry [[Maria Leszczynska]], the daughter of Stanislas, former king of Poland. Bourbon's motive appears to have been a desire to produce an heir as soon as possible so as to reduce the chances of a succession dispute between Philip V and the Duke of Orléans in the event of the sickly king's death. Maria was already an adult woman at the time of the marriage, while the [[infanta]] was still a young girl.

[[File:Louis14-Family.jpg|left|thumb| upright=1.65 |A posthumous painting commissioned around 1670 by [[Philippe I, Duke of Orléans|Philippe de France]]. It shows the French Bourbon family around that time. It includes: [[Henrietta Maria of France]] (died 1669), exiled Queen of England; [[Philippe I, Duke of Orléans]], founder of the [[House of Orléans]]; his first wife [[Henrietta of England|Princess Henriette]] (died 1670); the couple's first daughter [[Marie Louise d'Orléans]] (later Queen of Spain); [[Anne of Austria]] (died 1666); the Orléans daughters of [[Gaston, Duke of Orléans|Gaston de France]]; [[Louis XIV]]; the Dauphin of France with his wife [[Maria Theresa of Spain]] with her third daughter [[Marie Thérèse of France (1667–1672)|Marie-Thérèse]], called [[Madame Royale]] (died 1672) and her second son ''Philippe-Charles de France, duc d'Anjou'' (d1671). The first daughter of Gaston stands on the far right: [[Anne Marie Louise d'Orléans, Duchess of Montpensier|Anne Marie Louise d'Orléans]]. The picture frame with the two children are the other two daughters of Louis and Maria Theresa who died in 1662 and 1664.]]
Nevertheless, Bourbon's action brought a very negative response from Spain, and for his incompetence Bourbon was soon replaced by Cardinal [[André-Hercule de Fleury]], the young king's tutor, in 1726. Fleury was a peace-loving man who intended to keep France out of war, but circumstances presented themselves that made this impossible.

The first cause of these wars came in 1733 when [[Augustus II of Poland|Augustus II]], the elector of Saxony and king of Poland died. With French support, Stanislas was again elected king. This brought France into conflict with Russia and Austria who supported [[Augustus III]], Elector of Saxony and son of Augustus II.

Stanislas lost the Polish crown, but he was given the Duchy of Lorraine as compensation, which would pass to France after his death. Next came the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] in 1740 in which France supported King [[Frederick II of Prussia]] against [[Maria Theresa]], Archduchess of Austria and Queen of Hungary. Fleury died in 1743 before the conclusion of the war.

Shortly after Fleury's death in 1745 Louis was influenced by his mistress the [[Marquise de Pompadour]] to reverse the policy of France in 1756 by creating an alliance with Austria against Prussia in the [[Seven Years' War]]. The war was a disaster for France, which lost most of her overseas possessions to the British in the Treaty of Paris in 1763. Maria, his wife, died in 1768 and Louis himself died on 10 May 1774.

===French Revolution===
{{Main| French Revolution}}
[[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] had become the [[Dauphin of France]] upon the death of his father [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1729–1765)|Louis]], the son of Louis XV, in 1765. He married [[Marie Antoinette of Austria]], a daughter of Holy Roman Empress Maria Theresa, in 1770. Louis intervened in the [[American Revolution]] against Britain in 1778, but he is most remembered for his role in the [[French Revolution]]. France was in financial turmoil and Louis was forced to convene the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]] on 5 May 1789.

They formed the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] and forced Louis to accept a constitution that limited his powers on 14 July 1789. He [[Flight to Varennes|tried to flee France]] in June 1791, but was captured. The French monarchy was abolished on 21 September 1792 and [[French First Republic|a republic]] was proclaimed. The chain of Bourbon monarchs begun in 1589 was broken. Louis XVI was executed on 21 January 1793.

Marie Antoinette and her son, Louis, were held as prisoners. Many French royalists proclaimed him [[Louis XVII of France|Louis XVII]], but he never reigned. She was executed on 16 October 1793. He died of [[tuberculosis]] on 8 June 1795 at the age of ten while in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The heart of Louis XVII, the son of Marie-Antoinette and Louis XVI who died in prison in 1795, has been laid to test in the crypt of Saint-Denis Basilica.(News)(Brief Article).&quot; History Today. History Today Ltd. 2004. HighBeam Research. 18 September 2012;&quot;''Louis XVII officially died of TB at the age of ten in the Temple prison.''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]] spread nationalism and anti-absolutism throughout Europe, and the other Bourbon monarchs were threatened. [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand]] was forced to flee from Naples in 1806 when [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] deposed him and installed his brother, [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]], as king. Ferdinand continued to rule from Sicily until 1815.

Napoleon conquered Parma in 1800 and compensated the Bourbon duke with [[Kingdom of Etruria|Etruria]], a new kingdom he created from the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. It was short-lived, counting only two monarchs, [[Louis I of Etruria|Louis]] and [[Charles II, Duke of Parma|Charles]], as Napoleon annexed Etruria in 1807.

King [[Charles IV of Spain]] had been an ally of France. He succeeded his father, [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]], in 1788. At first he declared war on France on 7 March 1793, but he made peace on 22 June 1795. This peace became an alliance on 19 August 1796. His chief minister, [[Manuel de Godoy]] convinced Charles that his son, Ferdinand, was plotting to overthrow him. Napoleon exploited the situation and invaded Spain in March 1808. This led to an uprising that forced Charles to abdicate on 19 March in favor of his son, [[Ferdinand VII]]. Napoleon forced Ferdinand to return the crown to Charles on 30 April and then convinced Charles to relinquish it to him on 10 May. In turn, he gave it to his brother, Joseph, king of Naples on 6 June. Joseph abandoned Naples to [[Joachim Murat]], the husband of Napoleon's sister. This was very unpopular in Spain and resulted in the [[Peninsular War]], a struggle that would contribute to the downfall of Napoleon.

===Bourbon Restoration===
[[File:Pavillon royal de France.svg|left|upright=1.15|thumb|The standard of the French royal family under the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' and the [[Bourbon Restoration|restoration period]].]]
{{Main|Bourbon Restoration}}
With the abdication of Napoleon on 11 April 1814 the Bourbon dynasty was restored to the kingdom of France in the person of [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], brother of Louis XVI. Napoleon escaped from exile and Louis fled in March 1815. Louis was again restored after the [[Battle of Waterloo]] on 7 July.

The conservative elements of Europe dominated the post-Napoleonic age, but the values of the French Revolution could not be easily swept aside. Louis granted a constitution on 14 June 1814 to appease the liberals, but the ultra-royalist party, led by his brother, Charles, continued to influence his reign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Durant&quot;&gt;[[Will Durant|Durant, Will]] and [[Ariel Durant|Durant, Ariel]]. ''The Story of Civilization'', Part XI, The Age of Napoleon&quot;. Simon &amp; Schuster, New York, 1975. pp. 730–731, 774.&lt;/ref&gt; When he died in 1824 his brother became king as [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] much to the dismay of French liberals. In a saying ascribed to [[Talleyrand]], &quot;they had learned nothing and forgotten nothing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;In French: ''Ils n'ont rien appris, ni rien oublié.'' There is no historic evidence linking the saying to Talleyrand. It may derive from a similar lamentation about the royalists, found in a letter by Charles Louis Etienne, chevalier de Panat, a French naval officer, dated January 1796 and sent from London to [[Jacques Mallet du Pan|Mallet du Pan]]: ''personne n'a su ni rien oublier, ni rien apprendre'' (&quot;nobody has been able to forget anything, nor to learn anything&quot;), included in: {{cite book |editor=A. Sayou |title=Mémoires et correspondance de Mallet du Pan |volume=II |year=1852 |page=197 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LZpCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aftermath====
Charles passed several laws that appealed to the upper class, but angered the middle class. The situation came to a head when he appointed a new minister on 8 August 1829 who did not have the confidence of the chamber. The chamber censured the king on 18 March 1830 and in response Charles proclaimed five ordinances on 26 July intended to silence criticism against him.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} This almost resulted in another revolution as dramatic as the one in 1789, but moderates were able to control the situation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

[[File:Coat of Arms of the July Monarchy (1830-31).svg|thumb|Coat of arms of [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]] of the [[Orléanist]] cadet branch, French king during the [[July Monarchy]] 1830–48 (with the revolutionary [[Flag of France|Tricolour flag]] and the Napoleonic Order of the [[Legion of Honour]])]]

As a compromise the crown was offered to [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]], duke of Orléans, a descendant of [[Philippe I, Duke of Orléans|the brother of Louis XIV]], and the head of the Orléanist cadet branch of the Bourbons. Agreeing to reign constitutionally and under the [[Tricolour (flag)|tricolour]], he was proclaimed King of the French on 7 August. The resulting regime, known as the [[July Monarchy]], lasted until the [[French Revolution of 1848|Revolution of 1848]]. The Bourbon monarchy in France ended on 24 February 1848, when Louis Philippe was forced to abdicate and the short-lived [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] was established.

Some [[Legitimists]] refused to recognize the Orléanist monarchy. After the death of Charles in 1836 his son was proclaimed [[Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoulême|Louis XIX]], though this title was never formally recognized. Charles' grandson [[Henri, Count of Chambord]], the last Bourbon claimant of the French crown, was proclaimed by some Henry V, but the French monarchy was never restored.

Following the 1870 collapse of the empire of Emperor [[Napoleon III]], Henri was offered a restored throne. However Chambord refused to accept the throne unless France abandoned the revolution-inspired [[Flag of France|tricolour]] and accepted what he regarded as the true Bourbon flag of France, featuring the [[fleur-de-lis]]. The tricolour, originally associated with the French Revolution and the [[French First Republic|First Republic]], had been used by the July Monarchy, the Second Republic and both Empires; the [[French National Assembly]] could not possibly agree.

A ''temporary'' [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] was established, while monarchists waited for the comte de Chambord to die and for the succession to pass to [[Prince Philippe, Count of Paris]], who was willing to accept the tricolour. Henri lived until 1883, by which time public opinion had come to accept the republic as the &quot;form of government that divides us least.&quot; His death without issue marked the extinction of the French Bourbons. Thus the head of the House of Bourbon became [[Juan, Count of Montizón]] of the Spanish line of the house who was also [[Carlist]] claimant to the throne of Spain, and had become the senior male of the dynasty by primogeniture. His heir as eldest Bourbon and head of the house is today [[Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou]].

By an ordinance of [[Louis Philippe I]] of 13 August 1830, it was decided that the king's children (and his sister) would continue to bear the arms of Orléans, that Louis-Philippe's eldest son, as Prince Royal, would bear the title of Duke of Orléans, that the younger sons would continue to have their existing titles, and that the sister and daughters of the king would be styled ''Royal Highness'' and &quot;d'Orléans&quot;, but the Orléans dynasts did not take the name &quot;of France&quot;.

===Philip V===

The Spanish branch of the House of Bourbon was founded by Philip V. He was born in 1683 in Versailles, the second son of the Grand Dauphin, son of Louis XIV. He was Duke of [[Anjou]] and probably never expected to be raised to a rank higher than that. However King [[Charles II of Spain]], dying without issue, willed the throne to his grand-nephew the Duke of Anjou, younger grandson of his eldest sister [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Marie-Thérèse]], daughter of King [[Philip IV of Spain]] who had married Louis XIV of France.

The prospect of Bourbons on both the French and Spanish thrones was resisted as creating an [[European balance of power|imbalance of power]] in Europe by its [[historical powers|dominant regimes]] and, upon Charles II's death on 1 November 1700, a [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]] of European nations united against Philip. This was known as the [[War of Spanish Succession]]. In the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], signed on 11 April 1713, Philip was recognized as king of Spain but his renunciation of succession rights to France was affirmed and, of the [[Spanish Empire]]'s other European territories, Sicily was ceded to Savoy, and the [[Spanish Netherlands]], Milan and Naples were allotted to the [[House of Habsburg|Austrian Habsburgs]].

Philip had two sons by his first wife. After her death he married [[Elisabeth Farnese]], niece of [[Francesco Farnese, Duke of Parma]], in 1714. She presented Philip with three sons, for whom she had ambitions of securing Italian crowns. Thus she induced Philip to occupy Sardinia and Sicily in 1717.

A [[Quadruple Alliance (1718)|Quadruple Alliance]] of Britain, France, Austria and the Netherlands was organized on 2 August 1718 to stop him. In the [[Treaty of The Hague (1720)|Treaty of The Hague]], signed on 17 February 1720, Philip renounced his conquests of Sardinia and Sicily, but assured the ascension of his eldest son by Elisabeth to the Duchy of Parma upon the reigning duke's death. Philip abdicated in January 1724 in favor of [[Louis of Spain|Louis I]], his eldest son with his first wife, but Louis died in August and Philip resumed the crown.

When the [[War of the Polish Succession]] began in 1733, Philip and Elisabeth saw another opportunity to advance the claims of their sons and recover at least part of the former possessions of the Spanish crown on the Italian peninsula. Philip signed the [[Pacte de Famille|Family Compact]] with Louis XV, his nephew and king of France. Charles, Duke of Parma since 1731, invaded Naples. At the conclusion of peace on 13 November 1738, control of Parma and Piacenza was ceded to Austria, which had occupied the duchies but was now forced to recognise Charles as King of Naples and Sicily. Philip also used the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] to win more territory in Italy. He did not live to see it to its conclusion, however, dying in 1746.

===Ferdinand VI and Charles III===
[[Ferdinand VI]], second son of Philip V and his first wife, succeeded his father. He was a peace-loving monarch who kept Spain out of the [[Seven Years' War]]. He died in 1759 in the midst of that conflict and was succeeded by his half-brother [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]]. Charles was the eldest son of Philip and Elisabeth Farnese. He was born in 1716 and had become Duke of Parma when the last Farnese duke died in 1731.

Following Spain's victory over the Austrians at the [[battle of Bitonto]], it proved inexpedient to reunite Naples and Sicily to Spain, so as a compromise Charles became King of Naples, as Charles IV and VII of Sicily. Following Charles' accession to the Spanish throne in 1759 he was required, by the Treaty of Naples of 3 October 1759, to abdicate Naples and Sicily to his third son, [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand]], thus initiating the branch known as the Neapolitan Bourbons.

Charles revived the Family Compact with France on 15 August 1761 and joined in the Seven Years' War against Britain in 1762; the reformist policies he had espoused in Naples were pursued with similar energy in Spain, where he completely overhauled the cumbersome bureaucracy of the state. As a French ally he opposed Britain during the American Revolution in June 1779, supplying large quantities of weapons and munitions to the rebels and keeping one third of all the British forces in the Americas occupied defending Florida and what is now [[Alabama]], which were ultimately recaptured by Spain. Charles died in 1788.

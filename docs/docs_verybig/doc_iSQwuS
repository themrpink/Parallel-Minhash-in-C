Human habitation of [[Cyprus]] dates back to the [[Paleolithic]] era. Cyprus's geographic position has caused Cyprus to be influenced by differing Eastern Mediterranean civilisations over the millennia. Cyprus is a small country.

Periods of Cyprus's history from 1050 BC have been named according to styles of [[Pottery of ancient Cyprus|pottery]] found as follows:
* Cypro-Geometric I: 1050-950 BC
* Cypro-Geometric II: 950-850 BC
* Cypro-Geometric III: 850-700 BC
* Cypro-Archaic I: 700-600 BC
* Cypro-Archaic II: 600-475 BC
* Cypro-Classical I: 475-400 BC
* Cypro-Classical II: 400-323 BC

Cyprus was [[human settlement|settled]] by humans in the [[Paleolithic]] period (known as the stone age) who coexisted with various dwarf animal species, such as [[Cyprus Dwarf Elephant|dwarf elephants]] (''Elephas cypriotes'') and [[Cyprus Dwarf Hippopotamus|pygmy hippos]] (''Hippopotamus minor'') well into the [[Holocene]]. There are claims of an association of this [[fauna]] with [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] of [[Epipaleolithic (Levant)|Epipalaeolithic]] foragers at [[Aetokremnos]] near Limassol on the southern coast of Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schule|first=William|date=July 1993|title=Mammals, Vegetation and the Initial Human Settlement of the Mediterranean Islands: A Palaeoecological Approach|jstor=2845588|journal=Journal of Biogeography|volume=2|issue=4|pages=407|doi=10.2307/2845588}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first undisputed settlement occurred in the 9th (or perhaps 10th) millennium BC from the [[Levant]]. The first [[settler]]s were agriculturalists of the so-called PPNB ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B|pre-pottery Neolithic B]]) era, but did not yet produce [[pottery]] ([[aceramic]] [[Neolithic]]).

The dog, sheep, goats and possibly [[cattle]] and pigs were introduced, as well as numerous wild animals such as [[fox]]es (''Vulpes vulpes'') and [[Persian fallow deer]] (''Dama mesopotamica'') that were previously unknown on the island. The PPNB settlers built round houses with floors made of [[terrazzo]] of burned lime (e.g. [[Kastros]], [[Shillourokambos]]) and cultivated [[einkorn]] and [[emmer]]. Pigs, sheep, goats and cattle were kept but remained, for the most part, behaviourally wild. Evidence of cattle such as that attested at Shillourokambos is rare, and when they apparently died out in the course of the 8th millennium they were not re-introduced until the ceramic Neolithic.

In the 6th millennium BC, the aceramic [[Khirokitia]] culture was characterised by [[roundhouse (dwelling)|roundhouses]], stone vessels and an economy based on sheep, goats and pigs. Cattle were unknown, and Persian [[fallow deer]] were hunted. This was followed by the ceramic [[Sotira, Limassol|Sotira]] phase. The [[Eneolithic]] era is characterised by stone [[figurine]]s with spread arms.

Water wells discovered by archaeologists in western Cyprus are believed to be among the oldest in the world, dated at 9,000 to 10,500 years old, putting them in the [[Stone Age]]. They are said to show the sophistication of early settlers, and their heightened appreciation for the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8118318.stm |title=Stone Age wells found in Cyprus |work=BBC News |date=2009-06-25 |access-date=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bronze Age ==
[[File:1900-1725 v. Chr. C.jpg|thumb|Red Polished Ceramics from Enkomi, 1900-1725 BC. St. Barnabas Archaeological Museum, [[Salamis, Cyprus]]]]

In the [[Bronze Age]] the first cities, such as [[Enkomi]], were built. Systematic copper mining began, and this resource was widely traded. [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greeks]] were undoubtedly inhabiting Cyprus from the late stage of the Bronze Age, while the island's Greek name is already attested from the 15th century BC in the [[Linear B]] script.&lt;ref&gt;Through the [[Mycenaean Greek]] Linear B {{lang|gmy|êÄìêÄ†êÄ™êÄç}}, ''ku-pi-ri-jo'', meaning &quot;Cypriot&quot; and corresponding to the later Greek form {{lang|grc|ŒöœçœÄœÅŒπŒøœÇ}}, ''Kyprios''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strange|first=John|title=Caphtor : Keftiu : a new investigation|year=1980|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=978-90-04-06256-6|page=167|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c9QUAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=cyprus+mycenaeans&amp;pg=PA154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cypriot syllabary|Cypriot syllabic script]] was first used in early phases of the late Bronze Age (LCIB) and continued in use for ca. 500 years into the LC IIIB, maybe up to the second half of the eleventh century BC. Most scholars believe it was used for a native Cypriot language ([[Eteocypriot]]) that survived until the 4th century BC, but the actual proofs for this are scant, as the tablets still have not been completely deciphered.

The LCIIC (1300‚Äì1200&amp;nbsp;BC) was a time of local prosperity. Cities such as Enkomi were rebuilt on a rectangular grid plan, where the town gates correspond to the grid axes and numerous grand buildings front the street system or newly founded.
Great official buildings constructed from [[ashlar]] masonry point to increased social hierarchisation and control. Some of these buildings contain facilities for processing and storing [[olive oil]], such as [[Maroni]]-Vournes and Building X at [[Kalavassos]]-Ayios Dhimitrios. A Sanctuary with a horned altar constructed from [[ashlar]] masonry has been found at Myrtou-Pigadhes, other temples have been located at Enkomi, [[Kition]] and [[Kouklia]] (Palaepaphos). Both the regular layout of the cities and the new masonry techniques find their closest parallels in Syria, especially in [[Ugarit]] (modern Ras Shamra).
Rectangular corbelled tombs point to close contacts with Syria and Palestine as well.

The practice of writing spread and tablets in the [[Cypriot syllabary|Cypriot syllabic script]] have been found at [[Ras Shamra]] which was the Phoenician city of Ugarit. Ugaritic texts from Ras Shamra and Enkomi mention Ya, the Assyrian name of Cyprus, that thus seems to have been in use already in the late Bronze Age.

Copper ingots shaped like oxhides have been recovered from shipwrecks such as at [[Ulu Burun]], Iria and [[Cape Gelidonya]] which attest to the widespread metal trade. Weights in the shape of animals found in Enkomi and Kalavassos follow the Syro-Palestinian, Mesopotamian, Hittite and Aegean standards and thus attest to the wide-ranging trade as well.

Late Bronze Age Cyprus was a part of the [[Hittite Empire|Hittite empire]] but was a client state and as such was not invaded but rather merely part of the empire by association and governed by the ruling kings of Ugarit.&lt;ref name=&quot;TTW1&quot;&gt;Thomas, Carol G. &amp; Conant, C.: ''The Trojan War'', pages 121-122. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005. {{ISBN|0-313-32526-X}}, 9780313325267.&lt;/ref&gt; As such Cyprus was essentially &quot;left alone with little intervention in Cypriot affairs&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;TTW1&quot; /&gt; However, during the reign of [[Tudhaliya I|Tudhaliya]], the island was briefly invaded by the Hittites for either reasons of securing the copper resource or as a way of preventing piracy. Shortly afterwards the island was reconquered by his son around 1200&amp;nbsp;BC.

Although [[Achaeans (tribe)|Achaean]] Greeks were living in Cyprus from the 14th century,&lt;ref&gt;[[Andreas G. Orphanides]], &quot;Late Bronze Age Socio-Economic and Political Organization, and the Hellenization of Cyprus&quot;, Athens Journal of History, volume 3, number 1, 2017, pp.&amp;nbsp;7‚Äì20&lt;/ref&gt;
most of them inhabited the island after the Trojan war. Achaeans were colonizing Cyprus from 1210 to 1000&amp;nbsp;BC.
[[Dorians|Dorian]] Greeks arrived around 1100&amp;nbsp;BC and, unlike the pattern on the Greek mainland, the evidence suggests that they settled on Cyprus peacefully.

Another wave of Greek settlement is believed to have taken place in the following century (LCIIIB, 1100‚Äì1050), indicated, among other things, by a new type of graves (long dromoi) and Mycenaean influences in pottery decoration.

===Pottery===
{{See also|Pottery of ancient Cyprus}}
[[File:Base ring vessel.jpg|thumb|Base ring vessel of Late Bronze Age]]

In the later phase of the [[late Bronze Age]] (LCIIIA, 1200‚Äì1100&amp;nbsp;BC) great amounts of 'Mycenaean' IIIC:1b pottery were produced locally. New architectural features include [[cyclopean walls]], found on the Greek mainland, as well and a certain type of rectangular stepped capitals, endemic on Cyprus. Chamber tombs are given up in favour of shaft graves. Large amounts of IIIC:1b pottery are found in Palestine during this period as well. While this was formerly interpreted as evidence of an invasion ('[[Sea Peoples]]'), this is seen more and more as an indigenous development, triggered by increasing trade relations with Cyprus and [[Crete]]. Evidence of early trade with Crete is found in archaeological recovery on Cyprus of pottery from [[Kydonia|Cydonia]], a powerful urban center of ancient Crete.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan, [http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10881/cydonia.html#fieldnotes C. Michael Hogan, ''Cydonia'', The Modern Antiquarian, Jan. 23, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cypriot city kingdoms===
Most authors claim that the Cypriot city kingdoms, first described in written sources in the 8th century BC were already founded in the 11th century BC. Other scholars see a slow process of increasing social complexity between the 12th and the 8th centuries, based on a network of chiefdoms. In the 8th century (geometric period) the number of settlements increases sharply and monumental tombs, like the 'Royal' tombs of [[Salamis, Cyprus|Salamis]] appear for the first time. This could be a better indication for the appearance of the Cypriot kingdoms.

== Early Iron Age ==
The early [[Iron Age]] on Cyprus follows the Submycenaean period (1125‚Äì1050&amp;nbsp;BC) of the [[Late Bronze Age]]. It is divided into the Geometric (1050‚Äì700) and Archaic (700‚Äì525) periods.

Foundations myths documented by classical authors connect the foundation of numerous Cypriot towns with immigrant Greek heroes in the wake of the [[Trojan war]]. For example, [[Teucer]], brother of [[Aias]] was supposed to have founded [[Salamis, Cyprus|Salamis]], and the Arcadian [[Agapenor]] of Tegea to have replaced the native ruler Kinyras and to have founded [[Paphos]]. Some scholars see this a memory of a Greek colonisation already in the 11th&amp;nbsp;century. In the 11th century tomb 49 from Palaepaphos-Skales three bronze [[obelisk|obeloi]] with inscriptions in Cypriot syllabic script have been found, one of which bears the name of Opheltas. This is first indication of the use of Greek language on the island.

Cremation as a burial rite is seen as a Greek introduction as well. The first cremation burial in Bronze vessels has been found at Kourion-Kaloriziki, tomb 40, dated to the first half of the 11th century (LCIIIB). The shaft grave contained two bronze rod tripod stands, the remains of a shield and a golden sceptre as well. Formerly seen as the Royal grave of first Argive founders of Kourion, it is now interpreted as the tomb of a native Cypriote or a Phoenician prince. The cloisonn√© enamelling of the sceptre head with the two falcons surmounting it has no parallels in the Aegean, but shows a strong Egyptian influence.

===Phoenicians===
Literary evidence suggests an early Phoenician presence at [[Kition]] which was under [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyrian]] rule at the beginning of the 10th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hadjisavvas|first=Sophocles|title=The Phoenician Period Necropolis of Kition, Volume I|year=2013|publisher=Shelby White and Leon Levy Program for Archaeological Publications|url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~semitic/wl/publications/2012/hadjisavvas.html|page=1|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304111945/http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~semitic/wl/publications/2012/hadjisavvas.html|archive-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Phoenicia]]n [[merchants]] who were believed to come from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] [[colony|colonized]] the area and expanded the political influence of Kition. After c. 850 BC the sanctuaries [at the Kathari site] were rebuilt and reused by the Phoenicians.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt;[[File:Kition, Zeus Keraunios.jpg|thumb|Zeus Keraunios, 500-480 BC, Nicosia museum]]The oldest cemetery of Salamis has produced children's burials in Canaanite jars, indication of Phoenician presence already in the LCIIIB 11th&amp;nbsp;century. Similar jar burials have been found in cemeteries in Kourion-Kaloriziki and Palaepaphos-Skales near Kouklia. In Skales, many Levantine imports and Cypriote imitations of Levantine forms have been found and point to a Phoenician expansion even before the end of the 11th century.

==Ancient Cyprus==
{{Main|Ancient history of Cyprus|Roman Cyprus}}
[[Image:Episkopi 01-2017 img03 Kourion.jpg|thumb|250px|An ancient Greek theater in [[Kourion]].]]
The first written source shows Cyprus under [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyria]]n rule. A [[stela]] found 1845 in [[Kition (ancient state)|Kition]] commemorates the victory of king [[Sargon II]] (721‚Äì705&amp;nbsp;BC) in 709 over the seven kings in the land of Ia', in the district of Iadnana or Atnana. The former is supposedly the Assyrian name of the island, while some authors take the latter to mean Greece (the Islands of the Danaoi). There are other inscriptions referring to Ia' in Sargon's palace at [[Khorsabad]]. The ten kingdoms listed by an inscription of [[Esarhaddon]] in 673/2&amp;nbsp;BC have been identified as [[Salamis, Cyprus|Salamis]], [[Kition]], [[Amathus]], [[Kourion]], [[Paphos]] and [[Soli, Cyprus|Soli]] on the coast and [[Tamassos]], [[Ledra]], [[Idalium]] and [[Chytri]] in the interior.

Cyprus gained independence for some time around 669 but was conquered by Egypt under [[Amasis II|Amasis]] (570‚Äì526/525). The island was conquered by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] around 545&amp;nbsp;BC. A Persian palace has been excavated in the territory of [[Marion, Cyprus|Marion]] on the North coast near Soli. The inhabitants took part in the Ionian rising. At the beginning of the 4th century BC, Euagoras I, King of Salamis, took control of the whole island and tried to gain independence from Persia. Another uprising took place in 350 but was crushed by [[Artaxerxes III of Persia|Artaxerxes]] in 344.

During the siege of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], the Cypriot Kings went over to [[Alexander the Great]]. In 321 four Cypriot kings sided with [[Ptolemy I]] and defended the island against [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonos]]. Ptolemy [[Battle of Salamis (306 BC)|lost Cyprus]] to [[Demetrios Poliorketes]] in 306 and 294&amp;nbsp;BC, but after that it remained under [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] rule till 58&amp;nbsp;BC. It was ruled by a governor from Egypt and sometimes formed a minor Ptolemaic kingdom during the power-struggles of the 2nd and 1st centuries. Strong commercial relationships with [[Athens]] and [[Alexandria]], two of the most important commercial centres of antiquity, developed.

Full [[Hellenisation]] only took place under [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] rule. Phoenician and native Cypriot traits disappeared, together with the old [[Cypriot syllabic script]]. A number of cities were founded during this time, e.g. [[Arsinoe (Southwest Cyprus)|Arsinoe]] that was founded between old and new [[Paphos]] by [[Ptolemy II]].

Cyprus became a Roman province in 58&amp;nbsp;BC, according to [[Strabo]] because the Roman politician, [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]], held a grudge against the king of Cyprus, [[Ptolemy of Cyprus|Ptolemy]], and sent [[Cato the Younger|Marcus Cato]] to conquer the island after he had become [[tribune]]. [[Mark Antony]] gave the island to [[Cleopatra VII]] of Egypt and her sister [[Arsinoe IV of Egypt|Arsinoe IV]], but it became a Roman province again after his defeat at the [[Battle of Actium]] (31&amp;nbsp;BC) in 30&amp;nbsp;BC. From 22&amp;nbsp;BC it was a [[senatorial province]].  The island suffered great losses during the Jewish uprising of 115/116&amp;nbsp;AD.

After the reforms of [[Diocletian]] it was placed under the control of the Consularis Oriens and governed by a [[proconsul]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Guidebook18&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=A Guide to the [[Larnaca District Archaeological Museum|Larnaca District Museum]]|last=Flourentzos|first=P.|publisher=Ministry of Communications and Works - Department of Antiquities|year=1996|isbn=9789963364251|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several earthquakes led to the destruction of Salamis at the beginning of the 4th century, at the same time drought and famine hit the island.

==Medieval Cyprus==
{{main|Cyprus in the Middle Ages|Theme of Cyprus}}

[[File:Yeroskipou 2010-05-04.jpg|thumb|250px|Ayia Paraskevi Byzantine church in [[Yeroskipou]].]]
After the division of the Roman Empire into an eastern half and a western half, Cyprus came under the rule of [[Byzantine Empire|Constantinople]]. At that time, its [[bishop]], while still subject to the [[One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church|Church]], was made [[autocephalous]] by the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]].

The [[Arabs]] and [[Muslim]]s invaded Cyprus in force in the 650s, but in 688, the emperor [[Justinian II]] and the [[caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] reached an unprecedented agreement. For the next 300 years, Cyprus was ruled jointly by both the Arabs and the Byzantines as a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]], despite the nearly constant warfare between the two parties on the mainland. The Byzantines recovered control over the island for short periods thereafter, but the ''status quo'' was always restored.

This period lasted until the year 965, when [[Niketas Chalkoutzes]] conquered the island for a resurgent Byzantium. In 1185, the last Byzantine governor of Cyprus, [[Isaac Comnenus of Cyprus]] from a minor line of the Imperial house, rose in rebellion and attempted to seize the throne. His attempted coup was unsuccessful, but Comnenus was able to retain control of the island.

Byzantine actions against Comnenus failed because he enjoyed the support of [[William II of Sicily]]. The Emperor had an agreement with the [[sultan]] of Egypt to close Cypriot harbours to the Crusaders.

===The Third Crusades===
In the 12th century AD the island became a target of the [[crusades|crusaders]]. [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] landed in [[Limassol]] on 1 June 1191 in search of his sister and his bride [[Berengaria of Navarre|Berengaria]], whose ship had become separated from the fleet in a storm. Richard's army landed when Isaac refused to return the hostages (Richard's sister, his bride, and several shipwrecked soldiers), and forced Isaac to flee from Limassol. He eventually surrendered, conceding control of the island to the King of England. Richard married Berengaria in Limassol on 12 May 1192. She was crowned as Queen of England by [[John Fitzluke]], [[Bishop of √âvreux]]. The crusader fleet continued to St. Jean d'Acre (Syria) on 5 June.

The army of [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] continued to occupy Cyprus and raised taxes. He sold the island to the [[Knights Templar]]. Soon after that, the [[French people|French]] (Lusignans) occupied the island, establishing the [[Kingdom of Cyprus]]. They declared Latin the official language, later replacing it with French; much later, Greek was recognized as a second official language. In 1196, the Latin Church was established, and the Orthodox Cypriot Church experienced a series of religious persecutions. [[Maronites]] settled on Cyprus during the Crusades and still maintain some villages in the North.

[[File:Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios Mansion in Nicosia Republic of Cyprus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios Mansion]].]]
[[Amalric I of Cyprus]] received the royal crown and title from [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor]]. A small minority Roman Catholic population of the island was mainly confined to some coastal cities, such as Famagusta, as well as inland Nicosia, the traditional capital. Roman Catholics kept the reins of power and control, while the Greek inhabitants lived in the countryside; this was much the same as the arrangement in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The independent Eastern Orthodox Church of Cyprus, with its own archbishop and subject to no patriarch, was allowed to remain on the island, but the Latin Church largely displaced it in stature and holding property.

After the death of Amalric of Lusignan, the Kingdom continually passed to a series of young boys who grew up as king. The Ibelin family, which had held much power in Jerusalem prior its downfall, acted as regents during these early years. In 1229 one of the Ibelin regents was forced out of power by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, who brought the struggle between the Guelphs and Ghibellines to the island.

Frederick's supporters were defeated in this struggle by 1233, although it lasted longer in the Kingdom of Jerusalem and in the Holy Roman Empire. Frederick's Hohenstaufen descendants continued to rule as kings of Jerusalem until 1268 when Hugh III of Cyprus claimed the title and its territory of Acre for himself upon the death of Conrad III of Jerusalem, thus uniting the two kingdoms. The territory in Palestine was finally lost while Henry II was king in 1291, but the kings of Cyprus continued to claim the title.

Like Jerusalem, Cyprus had a Haute Cour (High Court), although it was less powerful than it had been in Jerusalem. The island was richer and more feudal than Jerusalem, so the king had more personal wealth and could afford to ignore the Haute Cour. The most important vassal family was the multi-branch House of Ibelin. However, the king was often in conflict with the Italian merchants, especially because Cyprus had become the centre of European trade with Africa and Asia after the fall of Acre in 1291.

The kingdom eventually came to be dominated more and more in the 14th century by the Genoese merchants. Cyprus therefore sided with the Avignon Papacy in the [[Western Schism]], in the hope that the French would be able to drive out the Italians. The Mameluks then made the kingdom a tributary state in 1426; the remaining monarchs gradually lost almost all independence, until 1489 when the last Queen, Catherine Cornaro, was forced to sell the island to Venice. [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s started raiding Cyprus immediately afterwards, and [[Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War (1570‚Äì1573)|captured it in 1571]].

This is the historical setting to [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]'', the play's title character being the commander of the Venetian garrison defending Cyprus against the Ottomans.
{{wide image|Nicosia Venetian walls the Venetians ruled Cyprus from 1489 to 1571.JPG|600px|[[Venetian walls of Nicosia]].}}

==Ottoman Cyprus==
{{main|Ottoman Cyprus}}

The [[Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì78)|Russo-Turkish War]] ended the Ottoman control of Cyprus in 1878. Cyprus then came under the control of the British Empire with its conditions set out in the [[Cyprus Convention]]. However, sovereignty of the island continued to be maintained by the [[Ottoman Empire]] until Great Britain annexed the island unilaterally in 1914, after it declared war against the Ottomans during the First World War. Following World War I, under the provisions of the [[Treaty_of_Lausanne|Lausanne Treaty]], Turkey relinquished all claims and rights on Cyprus.

Under British rule the island began to enjoy a period of increased free speech, something which allowed further development of the Greek Cypriots' ideas of ''[[enosis]]'' (unification with Greece).

==Modern Cyprus==

[[File:Nicosia 01-2017 img03 Liberty Monument.jpg|thumb|250px|Statue of Liberty symbolising the independence of Cyprus.]]
In 1878, as the result of the [[Cyprus Convention]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] took over the government of Cyprus as a protectorate from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1914, at the beginning of [[World War I]], Cyprus was annexed by the United Kingdom. In 1925, following the [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]], Cyprus was made a [[Crown Colony]]. Between 1955 and 1959 [[EOKA]] was created by [[Greek Cypriots]] and led by [[George Grivas]] to perform [[enosis]] (union of the island with Greece). However the EOKA campaign did not result in union with Greece but rather an independent republic, The [[Cyprus|Republic of Cyprus]], in 1960.

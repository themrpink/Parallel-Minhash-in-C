The community of Allegro users have contributed several library extensions to handle things like scrolling tile maps and import and export of various file formats (e.g. [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[GIF]], [[JPEG]] images, [[MPEG]] video, [[Ogg]], [[MP3]], [[Impulse Tracker|IT]], [[S3M (file format)|S3M]], [[XM (mod format)|XM music]], [[TrueType|TTF]] [[typeface|fonts]], and more).

Allegro 4.x and below can be used in conjunction with [[OpenGL]] by using the library ''AllegroGL'' which extends Allegro's functionality into OpenGL and therefore the hardware. Allegro 5 natively supports [[OpenGL]].

They settled within the region in the first century B.C. According to [[Tacitus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Tacitus/histories.4.iv.html|title=The Internet Classics Archive &amp;#124; The Histories by Tacitus|website=classics.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Batavians]] and [[Cananefates]] of his time, tribes living within the [[Roman Empire]], were descended from part of the Chatti, who left their homeland after an internal quarrel drove them out, to take up new lands at the mouth of the [[Rhine river|Rhine]].

==Proto-history==
The extremely large timescale of [[Prehistoric Europe]] left stone tools and weapons dating from the [[Paleolithic]] to the [[Iron Age]] that were chronologically ordered and dated in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Tribes such as the Chatti, [[Cimbri]], and [[Langobardi]] have not been well distinguished until relatively recently.&lt;ref name=&quot;Todd2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Malcolm Todd|title=The Early Germans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p5QdmV3zNpIC&amp;pg=PA243|accessdate=17 November 2012|date=4 February 2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-3756-0|pages=243–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
While [[Julius Caesar]] (100–44 &lt;small&gt;BC&lt;/small&gt;) was well informed about the regions and tribes on the eastern banks of the Rhine, he never mentioned the Chatti by name. He did make note of the [[Suebi]] though, and suggested that they had previously driven out the [[Celt]]s to the south of the region corresponding to modern north Hesse in the prior centuries &lt;small&gt;BC&lt;/small&gt; (''cfr.'' the early medieval [[Hessengau]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Prichard1841&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=James Cowles Prichard|title=Researches Into the Physical History of Mankind: Researches into the ethnography of Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qL86AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA352|accessdate=17 November 2012|year=1841|publisher=Sherwood, Gilbert, and Piper|pages=352–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]], in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (written 77–79 &lt;small&gt;AD&lt;/small&gt;) grouped the Chatti and Suebi together with the [[Hermunduri]] and the [[Cherusci]], calling this group the [[Hermiones]], which is a nation of Germanic tribes mentioned by Tacitus as living in inland Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137:book=4:chapter=28&amp;highlight=chatti Plin. Nat. 4.28]&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators believe that Caesar's Suebi were possibly the later Chatti, a branch of the Suebian movement of people who had become more clearly identifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0062:entry=catti-harpers&amp;highlight=chatti| last= Peck| title=Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities |year=1898 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If not, then the Chatti may represent a successful resistance to the Suevi, as opposed to the [[Tencteri]], [[Usipetes]], and [[Ubii]] who all were forced from homelands in the same region by the Suebic incursions.

The first ancient writer to mention the Chatti is [[Strabo]], some time after 16 &lt;small&gt;AD&lt;/small&gt;, who includes the Chatti in a listing of conquered Germanic tribes who were more settled and agricultural, but also poorer, than the nomadic tribes in central and eastern Germania such as the Suebi. They were poor because they had fought the Romans, and had been defeated and plundered.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, 7.1.3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; In his second book of ''[[Epigrams]]'', [[Martial]] credited the emperor [[Domitian]] (51–96 &lt;small&gt;AD&lt;/small&gt;) as having overcome the Chatti:

{{Quote|text=
&lt;poem&gt;
  &quot;Creta dedit magnum, maius dedit Africa nomen,
    Scipio quod uictor quodque Metellus habet;
  nobilius domito tribuit Germania Rheno,
    et puer hoc dignus nomine, Caesar, eras.
  frater Idumaeos meruit cum patre triumphos,
    quae datur ex Chattis laurea, tota tua est.
&lt;/poem&gt;
}}
{{Quote|text=
&lt;poem&gt;
  &quot;Crete gave a great name, Africa a greater one:
    Scipio the victor has one, and Metellus has the other.
  Germany granted a nobler name when the Rhine had been subdued,
    and even as a boy, Caesar, you were worthy of this name.
  Your brother earned Idumaean triumphs together with your father,
    but the laurel given for the Chatti is totally yours.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;
[https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Epigrammaton_liber_II#IIǀ Martial: ''Epigrams.'' Book ll, No. 2]
}}

For the first century &lt;small&gt;AD&lt;/small&gt;, [[Tacitus]] provides important information about the Chatti's part in the Germanic wars and certain elements of their culture. He says that:&lt;blockquote&gt;[The Chatti's] settlements begin at the [[Hercynian forest]], where the country is not so open and marshy as in the other cantons into which Germany stretches. They are found where there are hills, and with them grow less frequent, for the Hercynian forest keeps close till it has seen the last of its native Chatti. Hardy frames, close-knit limbs, fierce countenances, and a peculiarly vigorous courage, mark the tribe. For Germans, they have much intelligence and sagacity; they promote their picked men to power, and obey those whom they promote; they keep their ranks, note their opportunities, check their impulses, portion out the day, intrench themselves by night, regard fortune as a doubtful, valour as an unfailing, resource; and what is most unusual, and only given to systematic discipline, they rely more on the general than on the army. Their whole strength is in their infantry, which, in addition to its arms, is laden with iron tools and provisions. Other tribes you see going to battle, the Chatti to a campaign. Seldom do they engage in mere raids and casual encounters. It is indeed the peculiarity of a cavalry force quickly to win and as quickly to yield a victory. Fleetness and timidity go together; deliberateness is more akin to steady courage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0083:chapter=30|title=Cornelius Tacitus, Germany and its Tribes, chapter 30|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tacitus also notes that like other Germanic tribes, the Chatti took an interest in traditions concerning haircuts and beards.&lt;blockquote&gt;A practice, rare among the other German tribes, and simply characteristic of individual prowess, has become general among the Chatti, of letting the hair and beard grow as soon as they have attained manhood, and not till they have slain a foe laying aside that peculiar aspect which devotes and pledges them to valour. Over the spoiled and bleeding enemy they show their faces once more; then, and not till then, proclaiming that they have discharged the obligations of their birth, and proved themselves worthy of their country and of their parents. The coward and the unwarlike remain unshorn. The bravest of them also wear an iron ring (which otherwise is a mark of disgrace among the people) until they have released themselves by the slaughter of a foe. Most of the Chatti delight in these fashions. Even hoary-headed men are distinguished by them, and are thus conspicuous alike to enemies and to fellow-countrymen. To begin the battle always rests with them; they form the first line, an unusual spectacle. Nor even in peace do they assume a more civilised aspect. They have no home or land or occupation; they are supported by whomsoever they visit, as lavish of the property of others as they are regardless of their own, till at length the feebleness of age makes them unequal to so stern a valour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0083:chapter=31|title=Cornelius Tacitus, Germany and its Tribes, chapter 31|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Between the Rhine and the Chatti, Tacitus places the [[Tencteres]] and [[Usipetes]], who apparently had been moved since the time of Caesar into the old homeland of the [[Ubii]], who had in turn settled in [[Cologne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0083:chapter=32|title=Cornelius Tacitus, Germany and its Tribes, chapter 32|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Caesar had described these three tribes as under pressure from Suebi to their east, and attempting to move across the Rhine.) To the south, Tacitus also says that the Chatti's land is beyond the questionable lands, the so-called [[tithe]] lands, or [[agri decumates]], that adventurers from the Roman sides of the Rhine and Danube had been trying to settle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0083:chapter=29|title=Cornelius Tacitus, Germany and its Tribes, chapter 29|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that at first the Chatti moved into place on the Rhine, in the old territory of the Ubii. [[Cassius Dio]] describes [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]] establishing a fort in Chatti territory on the Rhine in 11 &lt;small&gt;BC&lt;/small&gt;, and that in 10 &lt;small&gt;BC&lt;/small&gt; they moved out of an area where the Romans had permitted them.&lt;ref name=palaeo&gt;{{citation|journal=Palaeohistoria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6HCeJU_7SFwC |volume=51/52| year=2010| title=De &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C-chronologie van de Nederlandse Pre- en Protohistorie VI: Romeinse tijd en Merovingische periode, deel A: historische bronnen en chronologische schema's|last1=Lanting |last2=van der Plicht| page=52|isbn = 9789077922736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the north of the Chatti, Tacitus places the large area of the [[Chauci]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0083:chapter=35|title=Cornelius Tacitus, Germany and its Tribes, chapter 35|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the east, the neighbours of the Chatti and Chauci were the [[Cherusci]], who Tacitus describes as excessively peace-loving in his time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0083:chapter=36|title=Cornelius Tacitus, Germany and its Tribes, chapter 36|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Caesar had described the Suevi, not the Chatti, as living between the Ubii on the Rhine and a forest called the Bacenis, which separated them from the Cherusci. This is why Caesar's Suevi are sometimes thought to be Chatti.)

The Chatti successfully resisted incorporation into the [[Roman Empire]], joining the [[Cherusci|Cheruscan]] war leader [[Arminius]]' coalition of tribes that annihilated [[Publius Quinctilius Varus|Varus]]' legions in 9 AD in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]. [[Germanicus]] later, in 15,&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, The Annals [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#55|1.55]]&lt;/ref&gt; raided their lands in revenge, but Rome eventually responded to the Chatti's belligerent defense of their independence by building the [[Limes (Roman Empire)|limes]] border fortifications along the southern boundary of their lands in central Hesse during the early years of the first century. A major raid by the Chatti into [[Germania Superior]] was defeated decisively by the legions in 50 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, The Annals [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 12#27|12.27]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 58 AD the Chatti were [[Battle between the Hermunduri and the Chatti|defeated]] by the Hermunduri in a border dispute over a religiously significant river.

Roman sources identify the fabled [[Mattium]], beyond the Eder, as the capital of the Chatti.  Destroyed by Germanicus, its location is not known today, but generally is assumed to be in the wider neighbourhood of [[Fritzlar]] north of the river [[Eder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rga&quot;&gt;Armin Becker: ''Mattium''. In: ''Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde'' (RGA). 2. edition, volume 19, Walter de Gruyter, Berlin – New York 2001, p. 443–444. ({{Google books|d1URMz8B36oC|restricted online copy|page=443}}) (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chatti were opponents of the emperor [[Domitian]] in 84 CE, and were allies of [[Lucius Antonius Saturninus]] in his revolt of 89 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jones | first = Brian W. | title = The Emperor Domitian | publisher = Routledge | year = 1992 | location = London | isbn = 978-0-415-10195-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LxeIAgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

They appear again during the build up to the [[Marcomannic wars]], first attacking southwards towards [[Germania superior]] and [[Raitia]] in what is now southern Germany, in 162, and then while the bigger battles were being fought they were repulsed together with the [[Hermunduri]] from the Rhine by [[Didius Julianus]] in 175.

After the early third century &lt;small&gt;AD&lt;/small&gt;, however, the Chatti virtually disappear from the sources and are only called upon as a topical element or when writing about events of the first century. [[Cassius Dio]] is most likely not only the first author to mention the [[Alamanni]] but also the last one to record a historical appearance of the Chatti. Writing about the Germanic war of [[Caracalla]] in 213 &lt;small&gt;AD&lt;/small&gt;, he has the emperor fight &quot;''Κέννους, Kελτικòν ἔθνος''&quot; (&quot;the Kenni, a Celtic people&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/78*.html Cassius Dio, 78.14.1f]; [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0385.tlg001.perseus-grc1:78.14.1 Greek].&lt;/ref&gt; This is taken from an excerpt of Dio in the writings of [[Joannes Xiphilinus]], however, whereas the [[Fragmenta Valesiana]] refer to the same people as &quot;Chattoi&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fragmenta Valesiana 377.&lt;/ref&gt; The usage of &quot;Kελτικός&quot; for Germanic peoples was an archaic tradition among Greek writers.

After Cassius Dio, the name &quot;Chattus&quot; appears among others in a [[panegyric]] by [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] in the late fifth century, now as a poetic synonym for &quot;Germanus&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sidonius, Carmina 7.388ff. In this poem honouring [[Avitus]], the &quot;Chatt&quot;&lt;!--&quot;Chatti&quot; ?--&gt; is restricted by the swampy water of the river [[Elbe]]. Cf. [[Ludwig Rübekeil]], ''Diachrone Studien zur Kontaktzone zwischen Kelten und Germanen'', ÖAW, Vienna 2002, pp. 45f.&lt;/ref&gt; The last ancient source to mention the Chatti, if only in a quotation of [[Sulpicius Alexander]] describing events of the late fourth century, was [[Gregory of Tours]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregorius Turonenesis, [[Historia Francorum]], 2.9.55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegedly the Chatti were associated with the legendary &quot;First King of the Franks&quot;. The story is told of the election of the first Frankish king.&lt;ref&gt;''Liber Historiæ Francorum'' 4-5, MGH Scriptores rerum Merovingicarum II, ed. B. Krusch, Hanover, 1888, pp. 245-246&lt;/ref&gt; The much later ''Liber Historiæ Francorum'' says that after the death of [[Sunno]], his brother [[Marcomer]], leader of the [[Ampsivarii]] and [[Chatti]], proposed to the Franks that they should have one single king, contrary to their tradition. The ''Liber'' adds that [[Pharamond]], named as Marcomer's son, was chosen as this first king (thus beginning the tradition of long-haired kings of the Franks), and then states that when he died, his son [[Chlodio]] [428 AD] was raised up as the next king. The work says no more of him.

The Chatti eventually may in any case have become a branch of the much larger neighboring [[Franks]] and their region was incorporated in the kingdom of [[Clovis I]], probably with the [[Ripuarian Franks|Ripuarians]], at the beginning of the sixth century.

The Chatti name is apparently preserved in the medieval and modern name of [[Hesse]] in Germany, which is a name that already appears early. In 723 for example, the Anglo-Saxon missionary [[Winfrid]]—subsequently called [[St. Boniface]], Apostle of the Germans—proselytizing among the Hessians (Hessorum), felled their sacred tree, [[Thor's Oak]], near [[Fritzlar]], as part of his efforts to convert them and other Germanic tribes to Christianity.

==Chasuarii and Chattuarii==
Two tribes in northern Germany have names that are sometimes compared to the Chatti. The [[Chattuarii]], whose name appears to mean that they are dwellers upon the Chatti lands, or else Chatti people, lived near the Rhine, probably between [[IJssel]] and [[Lippe]]. They came to be seen as [[Franks]] and apparently moved over the Rhine as a Frankish people, to settle into the corner of land between the Rhine and Maas rivers.&lt;ref name=palaeo/&gt;

The name of the Chattuarii is in turn, sometimes compared to another people called the [[Chasuarii]] mentioned by several classical authors. The Chasuarii were a Germanic tribe mentioned by [[Tacitus]] in the ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]''. According to him, they dwelt to the north of the [[Chamavi]] and [[Angrivarii]], who dwelt in turn to the north of the Bructeri, between Ems and Weser, however the name of the Chasuarii most often is interpreted to mean &quot;dwellers on the [[Hase]] [river]&quot;, a tributary to the [[Ems (river)|Ems]]. The second century geographer [[Claudius Ptolemy]] mentions that the Kasouarioi lived to the east of the Abnoba mountains, in the vicinity of [[Hesse]], but this account of northern Europe is thought to contain confusions derived from using different sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Schütte|title=Ptolemy's Maps of Northern Europe| page=119|url=https://archive.org/stream/ptolemysmapsofno00schrich#page/118/mode/2up/search/angles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Places named after the Chatti ==

'''Warren Sturgis McCulloch''' (November 16, 1898 – September 24, 1969) was an American neurophysiologist and [[cybernetics|cybernetician]], known for his work on the foundation for certain brain theories and his contribution to the cybernetics movement.&lt;ref name = &quot;KA04&quot;&gt;Ken Aizawa (2004), &quot;[http://philosophy.uwaterloo.ca/MindDict/mcculloch.html McCulloch, Warren Sturgis]&quot;. In: Dictionary of the Philosophy of Mind. Retrieved May 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Walter Pitts]], McCulloch created computational models based on [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[algorithms]] called [[Artificial neuron#History|threshold logic]] which split the inquiry into two distinct approaches, one approach focused on biological processes in the brain and the other focused on the application of [[neural networks]] to [[artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCulloch|first=Warren|author2=Walter Pitts|title=A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity|journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics|year=1943|volume=5|pages=115–133|doi=10.1007/BF02478259|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Warren Sturgis McCulloch was born in [[Orange, New Jersey]], in 1898. His brother was a [[chemical engineer]] and Warren was originally planning to join the [[Christian ministry]]. As a teenager he was associated with the theologians [[Henry Sloane Coffin]], [[Harry Emerson Fosdick]], [[Herman Karl Wilhelm Kumm]] and [[Julian F. Hecker]]. He was also mentored by the [[Quaker]], [[Rufus Jones (writer)|Rufus Jones]].&lt;ref name=&quot;number&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCulloch |first1=Warren |title=What is a number, that a man may know it, and a man, that he may know a Number |journal=General Semantics Bulletin |date=1961 |issue=26 &amp; 27 |pages=7–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Haverford College]] and studied philosophy and psychology at [[Yale University]], where he received an A.B. degree in 1921.  He continued to study psychology at [[Columbia University|Columbia]] and received a M.A. degree in 1923. Receiving his MD in 1927 from the [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]] in New York, he undertook an internship at [[Bellevue Hospital]], New York, before returning to academia in 1934.  He worked at the Laboratory for Neurophysiology at Yale University from 1934 to 1941.

In 1941 he moved to Chicago and joined the Department of Psychiatry at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], where he was a professor of psychiatry, as well as the director of the Illinois Neuropsychiatric Institute until 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smalheiser|first1=Neil |title=Walter Pitts |journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|date=2000 |issue=43,2 |pages= 217–226}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1952 he worked at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] with [[Norbert Wiener]]. He was a founding member of the [[American Society for Cybernetics]] and its second president during 1967–1968.  He was a mentor to the British [[operations research]] pioneer [[Stafford Beer]].

McCulloch had a range of interests and talents. In addition to his scientific contributions he wrote poetry ([[sonnet]]s), and he designed and engineered buildings and a dam at his farm in [[Old Lyme]], Connecticut.

McCulloch married Ruth Metzger, known as 'Rook', in 1924 and they had three children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rebel genius : Warren S. McCulloch's transdisciplinary life in science|last=H.|first=Abraham, Tara|isbn=9780262035095|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=946160418|date = 2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] in 1969.

== Work ==
He is remembered for his work with Joannes Gregorius Dusser de Barenne from Yale&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2602446 | volume=12 | issue=6 | journal=Yale J Biol Med | title=Joannes Gregorius Dusser de Barenne| pages=742.2–746 | year=1940 | pmid=21433922 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later with [[Walter Pitts]] from the [[University of Chicago]]. He provided the foundation for certain brain theories in a number of classic papers, including &quot;A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity&quot; (1943) and &quot;How We Know Universals:  The Perception of Auditory and Visual Forms&quot; (1947), both published in the ''Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics''. The former is &quot;widely credited with being a seminal contribution to neural network theory, the theory of automata, the theory of computation, and cybernetics&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;KA04&quot;/&gt;

=== Neural network modelling ===
In the 1943 paper McCulloch and Pitts attempted to demonstrate that a [[Turing machine]] program could be implemented in a finite network of ''formal'' [[neuron]]s (in the event, the Turing Machine contains their model of the brain, but the converse is not true&lt;ref&gt;see: S.C. Kleene, &quot;Representations of Events in Nerve Nets and Finite Automata&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;), that the neuron was the base logic unit of the brain. In the 1947 paper they offered approaches to designing &quot;nervous nets&quot; to recognize visual inputs despite changes in orientation or size.

From 1952 McCulloch worked at the [[Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT]], working primarily on [[neural network]] modelling. His team examined the visual system of the [[frog]] in consideration of McCulloch's 1947 paper, discovering that the eye provides the brain with information that is already, to a degree, organized and interpreted, instead of simply transmitting an image.

=== Reticular formation ===
McCulloch also posited the concept of &quot;poker chip&quot; [[reticular formation]]s as to how the brain deals with contradictory information in a democratic, somatotopical neural network. His principle of  &quot;Redundancy of Potential Command&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&amp;verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0651207 Some Mechanisms For A Theory of the Reticular Formation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; was developed by [[Heinz von Foerster|von Foerster]] and [[Gordon Pask|Pask]] in their study of [[self-organization]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Predictive Model for Self-Organizing Systems&quot;, Part I: Cybernetica 3, pp. 258–300; Part II: Cybernetica 4, pp. 20–55, 1961 [[Heinz von Foerster]] and [[Gordon Pask]]&lt;/ref&gt; and by Pask in his [[Conversation Theory]] and [[Gordon Pask#Interactions of Actors Theory|Interactions of Actors Theory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pask 1996&quot;&gt;Gordon Pask (1996). ''Heinz von Foerster's Self-Organisation, the Progenitor of Conversation and Interaction Theories''&lt;/ref&gt;

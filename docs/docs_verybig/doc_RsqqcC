Scarlatti befriended the [[castrato]] singer [[Farinelli]], a fellow Neapolitan also enjoying royal patronage in Madrid. The musicologist and harpsichordist [[Ralph Kirkpatrick]] commented that [[Farinelli]]'s correspondence provides &quot;most of the direct information about Scarlatti that has transmitted itself to our day&quot;. Domenico Scarlatti died in [[Madrid]], at the age of 71. His residence on Calle Leganitos is designated with a historical plaque, and his descendants still live in Madrid. He was buried at a convent there, in Madrid, but his grave no longer exists.

Minor planet [[6480 Scarlatti]] is named in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;|{{cite book|title=(6479) Leoconnolly In: Dictionary of Minor Planet Names |publisher=Springer |date=2003 |isbn=978-3-540-29925-7 |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-29925-7_5896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a fraction of Scarlatti's compositions were published during his lifetime; Scarlatti himself seems to have overseen the publication in 1738 of the most famous collection, his 30 ''Essercizi'' (&quot;Exercises&quot;). These were well received throughout Europe, and were championed by the foremost English writer on music of the eighteenth century, [[Charles Burney]].

The many sonatas that were unpublished during Scarlatti's lifetime have appeared in print irregularly in the two and a half centuries since. Scarlatti has attracted notable admirers, including [[Béla Bartók]], [[Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli]], [[Pieter-Jan Belder]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Muzio Clementi]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Carl Czerny]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Frédéric Chopin]], [[Claude Debussy]], [[Emil Gilels]], [[Francis Poulenc]], [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[Enrique Granados]], [[Marc-André Hamelin]], [[Vladimir Horowitz]], [[Ivo Pogorelić]], [[Scott Ross (harpsichordist)|Scott Ross]] (the first performer to record all 555 sonatas), [[Heinrich Schenker]], [[András Schiff]] and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2020|reason=while many of these are definitely correct, I can't immediately find sources to support some of the others}}

Scarlatti's 555 keyboard sonatas are single movements, mostly in [[binary form]], and some in early [[sonata form]], and mostly written for the [[harpsichord]] or the earliest [[pianoforte]]s. (There are four for organ, and a few for small instrumental group). Some of them display harmonic audacity in their use of discords, and also unconventional [[Modulation (music)|modulations]] to remote [[key (music)|keys]].

Other distinctive attributes of Scarlatti's style are the following:
*The influence of Iberian (Portuguese and Spanish) folk music. An example is Scarlatti's use of the [[Phrygian mode]] and other tonal inflections more or less alien to European art music. Many of Scarlatti's figurations and dissonances are suggestive of the guitar.
*Scarlatti's compositions were influenced by the Spanish guitar as can be seen in notes being played repetitively in a rapid manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Barkley |editor1-first=Lisa |editor2-last=Bryan |editor2-first=Clark |title=Conservatory Canada New Millennium Piano Series |date=1999 |publisher=Waterloo Music Company Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A formal device in which each half of a sonata leads to a pivotal point, which Kirkpatrick termed &quot;the crux&quot;, and which is sometimes underlined by a pause or fermata. Before the crux, Scarlatti sonatas often contain their main thematic variety, and after the crux the music makes more use of repetitive figurations as it modulates away from the home key (in the first half) or back to the home key (in the second half).
*Scarlatti played in the [[Galant music|''galant'' style]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Barkley |editor1-first=Lisa |editor2-last=Bryan |editor2-first=Clark |title=Conservatory Canada New Millennium Piano Series |date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirkpatrick produced an edition of the sonatas in 1953, and the numbering from this edition is now nearly always used – the Kk. or K. number. Previously, the numbering commonly used was from the 1906 edition compiled by the Neapolitan pianist [[Alessandro Longo]] (L. numbers). Kirkpatrick's numbering is chronological, while Longo's ordering is a result of his arbitrarily grouping the sonatas into &quot;suites&quot;. In 1967 the Italian musicologist [[Giorgio Pestelli]] published a revised catalog (using P. numbers), which corrected what he considered to be some [[anachronism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See [[List of solo keyboard sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti]] for a list converting Longo, Kirkpatrick, Pestelli and Czerny numbers of Scarlatti's sonatas.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the exact dates of composition for these surviving sonatas are not known, Kirkpatrick concludes that they may all have been composed late in Scarlatti's career (after 1735), with the majority perhaps dating from after the composer's sixty-seventh birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Domenico Scarlatti: Revised Edition|last=Kirkpatrick|first=Ralph|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-691-09101-3|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Classical Music|last=Downs|first=Philip G.|publisher=Norton|year=1992|isbn=0-393-95191-X|location=New York|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from his many sonatas, Scarlatti composed a number of operas and cantatas, symphonias, and liturgical pieces. Well-known works include the ''Stabat Mater'' of 1715 and the ''Salve Regina'' of 1757, which is thought to be his last composition.

{{Greek myth (titan-concept)}}
'''Metis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|iː|t|ɪ|s}}; {{lang-grc|Μῆτις|Mêtis|wisdom', 'skill', or 'craft}}), in [[ancient Greek religion]], was a mythical Titaness belonging to the second generation of [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]].

By the era of [[Greek philosophy]] in the 5th century BC, Metis had become the mother of wisdom and deep thought, but her name originally connoted &quot;magical cunning&quot; and was as easily equated with the [[trickster]] powers of [[Prometheus]] as with the &quot;royal ''metis''&quot; of [[Zeus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&quot;/&gt; The [[Stoicism|Stoic]] commentators [[allegory|allegorised]] Metis as the embodiment of &quot;[[prudence]]&quot;, &quot;wisdom&quot; or &quot;wise counsel&quot;, in which form she was inherited by the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;A.B. Cook, ''Zeus'' (1914) 1940, noted in Brown 1952:133 note.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek word ''metis'' meant a quality that combined wisdom and cunning. This quality was considered to be highly admirable, the hero [[Odysseus]] being the embodiment of it. In the Classical era, ''metis'' was regarded by Athenians as one of the notable characteristics of the Athenian character.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

== Family ==
Metis was an [[Oceanid]], the daughters of [[Oceanus]] and his sister [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]], who were three thousand in number. She was a sister of the [[Potamoi]] (river-gods), sons of Oceanus and Tethys, who also numbered three thousand. Metis was the first great spouse of Zeus,&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcel Detienne|M. Detienne]] and [[Jean-Pierre Vernant|J.-P. Vernant]], ''Les Ruses de l'intelligence: la Mètis des Grecs'' (Paris, 1974). {{ISBN|2-08-081036-7}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; and also his cousin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&quot;&gt;Norman O. Brown, &quot;The Birth of [[Athena]]&quot; ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'' '''83''' (1952), pp. 130–143.&lt;/ref&gt; Zeus is himself titled ''Mêtieta'' (&quot;the wise counsellor&quot;), in the Homeric poems.

== Mythology ==
Metis was  the one who gave Zeus a potion to cause [[Cronus]] to vomit out Zeus' siblings.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' (Apollod. 1.2.1; Hesiod. ''[[Theogony]]'' 471.&lt;/ref&gt;

Metis was both a threat to Zeus and an indispensable aid:&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1952:133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''Zeus lay with Metis but immediately feared the consequences. It had been prophesied that Metis would bear extremely powerful children: the first, [[Athena]] and the second, a son more powerful than Zeus himself, who would eventually overthrow Zeus.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod's ''Theogony'', 886–900 [[wikisource:Theogony|Available at wikisource]]&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;In order to forestall these dire consequences, Zeus tricked her into turning herself into a [[fly]] and promptly swallowed her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lang 1901 pp. 194, 262-263&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Lang |first=Andrew |author-link=Andrew Lang |title=Myth, Ritual and Religion |publisher=Longmans, Green |volume=2 |year=1901 |url={{Google books|GEYA38U040QC|page=263|keywords=metis fly|plainurl=yes}} |access-date=2018-04-10 |pages=194, 262–263 |oclc=13809803}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was too late: Metis had already conceived a child. In time she began making a helmet and robe for her fetal daughter. The hammering as she made the helmet caused Zeus great pain, and [[Hephaestus]] either clove Zeus's head with an axe,&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Seventh Olympian Ode'' the first written appearance of this iconic image, which A.B. Cook showed first appears in 6th-century BC vase-painting; previously the [[Eilithyia]]a attend Zeus at the birthing.&lt;/ref&gt; or hit it with a hammer at the river [[Triton (god)|Triton]], giving rise to Athena's birth. Athena leaped from Zeus's head, fully grown, armed, and armoured. Zeus was none the worse for this experience.

The similarities between Zeus swallowing Metis and Cronus swallowing his children have been noted by several scholars. This also caused some controversy in regard to reproduction myths.&lt;ref name=&quot;King 2020&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |authorlink=Helen King (classicist) |first=Helen |last=King |title=Reproduction Myths |website=Encyclopedia.com |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/medicine/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/reproduction-myths |access-date=2020-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;King 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |authorlink=Helen King (classicist) |first=Helen |last=King |title=Metis |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to World Mythology |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |orig-year=2005 |url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195156690.001.0001/acref-9780195156690-e-1037?rskey=BxyWJR |url-access=subscription |access-date=2020-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hesiod's account is followed by [[Acusilaus]] and the [[Orphic]] tradition, which enthroned Metis side by side with [[Eros]] as primal [[cosmogeny|cosmogenic forces]]. [[Plato]] makes ''[[Porus (mythology)|Poros]]'', or &quot;creative ingenuity&quot;, the child of Metis.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sea serpent''' or '''sea dragon''' is a type of [[dragon]] described in various mythologies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/sea-serpent|title=Sea serpent {{!}} mythology|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=March 31, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably Mesopotamian ([[Tiamat]]), Hebrew ([[Leviathan]]), Greek ([[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]], [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]], [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]], [[Scylla]]), and Norse ([[Jörmungandr]]).

==Mythology==
{{Chaoskampf sidebar}}
The {{lang|de|[[Chaoskampf|Drachenkampf]]}} mytheme, the chief god in the role of the hero slaying a sea serpent, is widespread both in the [[Religions of the Ancient Near East|Ancient Near East]] and in [[Indo-European mythology]], 
e.g. [[Lotan]] and [[Hadad]], [[Leviathan]] and [[Yahweh]], [[Tiamat]] and [[Marduk]] (see also [[Labbu]], [[Bašmu]], [[Mušḫuššu]]), [[Illuyanka]] and [[Tarhunt]], [[Yammu]] and [[Baal]] in the [[Baal Cycle]] etc. The [[Hebrew Bible]] also has less mythological descriptions of large sea creatures as part of creation under God's command, such as the [[Tannin (monster)|Tanninim]] mentioned in [[Book of Genesis]] 1:21 and the &quot;great serpent&quot; of Amos 9:3. In the [[Aeneid]], a pair of sea serpents killed [[Laocoön]] and his sons when Laocoön argued against bringing the [[Trojan Horse]] into Troy.

In antiquity and in the Bible, dragons were envisioned as huge serpentine monsters, which means that the image of a dragon with two or four legs and wings came much later during the [[Late Middle Ages]]. Stories depicting sea-dwelling serpents may include the Babylonian myths of Tiamat, the myths of the Hydra, Scylla, Cetus and Echidna in the Greek mythology, and even the Leviathan.

In [[Norse mythology]], ''[[Jörmungandr]]'' (or ''[[Midgarðsormr]]'') was a sea serpent so long that it encircled the entire world, [[Midgard]]. Some stories report of sailors mistaking its back for a chain of islands. Sea serpents also appear frequently in later [[Scandinavian folklore]], particularly in that of Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sea Serpent?|url=http://www.ask.com/question/sea-serpent|publisher=[[Ask.com]]|accessdate=August 21, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025051421/http://www.ask.com/question/sea-serpent|archivedate=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Unexplained Mystery of the Sea Serpent|url=http://cryptidchronicles.tumblr.com/post/19539619204/mystery-of-the-sea-serpent|publisher=Crypted Chronicles|date=March 18, 2012|accessdate=August 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1028 AD, [[St. Olaf|Saint Olaf]] is said to have killed a sea serpent in Valldal, Norway, throwing its body onto the mountain Syltefjellet. Marks on the mountain are associated with the legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://loype.kulturminneaaret2009.no/kulturminneloyper/heilag-olav-i-valldal/ormen-i-syltefjellet/image/image_view_fullscreen|title=Ormen i Syltefjellet|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724181621/http://loype.kulturminneaaret2009.no/kulturminneloyper/heilag-olav-i-valldal/ormen-i-syltefjellet/image/image_view_fullscreen|archivedate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nb.no/cgi-bin/galnor/gn_sok.sh?id=147257&amp;skjema=2&amp;fm=4 |title=Galleri NOR |publisher=Nb.no |date=July 11, 1934 |accessdate=July 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Swedish [[ecclesiastic]] and writer [[Olaus Magnus]]'s ''[[Carta marina]]'', many marine monsters of varied form, including an immense sea serpent, appear. In his 1555 work ''History of the Northern Peoples'', Magnus gives the following description of a Norwegian sea serpent:

{{cquote|Those who sail up along the coast of Norway to trade or to fish, all tell the remarkable story of how a serpent of fearsome size, {{convert|200|ft|m|-1|disp=sqbr}} , or even {{convert|400|ft|m|-1|disp=sqbr}} long, and {{convert|20|ft|m|0|disp=sqbr}} wide, resides in rifts and caves outside [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]]. On bright summer nights this serpent leaves the caves to eat calves, lambs and pigs, or it fares out to the sea and feeds on sea nettles, crabs and similar marine animals. It has [[ell]]-long hair hanging from its neck, sharp black scales and flaming red eyes. It attacks vessels, grabs and swallows people, as it lifts itself up like a column from the water.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Norse Mythology – Jormungandr|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/08aug/01219/Nrsmyth.html?tql-iframe|publisher=[[Oracle Thinkquest]]|accessdate=August 21, 2013|archive-url=http://archive.is/uOoIE|archive-date=August 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Stewart|first=Gail Barbara|title=Water Monsters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AV1ICOJbq4EC&amp;pg=PA13|year=2011|publisher=ReferencePoint Press|location=San Diego, California|isbn=978-1-60152-345-7|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Possible sightings==
An apparent eye-witness account is found in [[Aristotle]]'s ''Historia Animalium''.
[[Strabo]] makes reference to an eyewitness account of a dead sea creature sighted by [[Poseidonius]] on the coast of the northern Levant. He reports the following: &quot;As for the plains, the first, beginning at the sea, is called Macras, or Macra-Plain. Here, as reported by Poseidonius, was seen the fallen dragon, the corpse of which was about a plethrum [{{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=in|disp=or|order=flip}}] in length, and so bulky that horsemen standing by it on either side could not see one another; and its jaws were large enough to admit a man on horseback, and each flake of its horny scales exceeded an oblong shield in length.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Strabo|author-link=Strabo|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0239|title=Geography|at=Book 16, chapter 2, paragraph 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creature was seen by Poseidonius, a Philosopher, sometime between 130 and 51 BC.

[[Hans Egede]], the national [[saint]] of Greenland, gives an 18th-century description of a sea serpent. On July 6, 1734 his ship sailed past the coast of Greenland when suddenly those on board &quot;saw a most terrible creature, resembling nothing they saw before. The monster lifted its head so high that it seemed to be higher than the [[crow's nest]] on the [[mainmast]]. The head was small and the body short and wrinkled. The unknown creature was using giant fins which propelled it through the water. Later the sailors saw its tail as well. The monster was longer than our whole ship&quot;, wrote Egede.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mareš|first=Jaroslav|author-link=Jaroslav Mareš|year=1997|title=Svět tajemných zvířat|trans-title=The World of Mysterious Animals|publisher=Littera Bohemica|location=Prague|language=Czech|isbn=80-85916-16-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HMS Plumper sea serpent 1848.jpg|thumb|&quot;Supposed Appearance of the Great Sea-Serpent, From H.M.S. Plumper, Sketched by an Officer on Board&quot;, ''[[Illustrated London News]]'', 14 April 1849]]
On 6 August 1848, Captain McQuhae of {{HMS|Daedalus|1826|6}} and several of his officers and crew  (en route to [[St Helena]]) saw a sea serpent which was subsequently reported (and debated) in ''[[The Times]]''. The vessel sighted what they named as an enormous serpent between the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and St Helena. The serpent was witnessed to have been swimming with {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=in|order=flip}} of its head above the water and they believed that there was another {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=in|order=flip}} of the creature in the sea. Captain McQuahoe also said that &quot;[The creature] passed rapidly, but so close under our lee quarter, that had it been a man of my acquaintance I should have easily have recognised his features with the naked eye.&quot; According to seven members of the crew it remained in view for around twenty minutes. Another officer wrote that the creature was more of a lizard than a serpent. Evolutionary biologist Gary J. Galbreath contends that what the crew of ''Daedalus'' saw was a [[Sei whale|sei baleen whale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://centerforinquiry.org/news/mystery_of_the_daedalus_sea_serpent_solved_in_skeptical_inquirer/|title=The Daedalus Sea Serpent Solved|magazine=Skeptical Inquirer|date=September–October 2015|access-date=June 21, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report was published in the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' on 14 April 1849 of a sighting of a sea serpent off the Portuguese coast by {{HMS|Plumper|1848|6}}.

{{quote|On the morning of the 31st December, 1848, in lat. 41° 13'N., and long. 12° 31'W., being nearly due west of Oporto, I saw a long black creature with a sharp head, moving slowly, I should think about {{convert|2|kn|km/h mph|spell=in|disp=sqbr}} ... its back was about {{convert|20|ft|m|0|spell=in|disp=sqbr}} if not more above water; and its head, as near as I could judge, from {{convert|6|to|8|ft|m|spell=in|disp=x|&amp;nbsp;[|abbr=values}}&amp;nbsp;m] ...There was something on its back that appeared like a mane, and, as it moved through the water, kept washing about; but before I could examine it more closely, it was too far astern |20px|20px|&quot;A Naval Officer&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/search/results/1849-04-14?NewspaperTitle=Illustrated%2BLondon%2BNews&amp;IssueId=BL%2F0001578%2F18490414%2F&amp;County=London%2C%20England|title=Supposed Appearance of the Great Sea Serpent From HMS Plumper Sketched by an Officer On Board|newspaper=[[Illustrated London News]]|date=April 14, 1849|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

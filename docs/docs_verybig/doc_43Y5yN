[[File:Phase locked loop.svg|thumb|Simplest analog phase locked loop]]

A '''phase-locked loop''' or '''phase lock loop''' ('''PLL''') is a [[control system]] that generates an output [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] whose [[phase (waves)|phase]] is related to the phase of an input signal.  There are several different types; the simplest is an [[electronic circuit]] consisting of a [[variable frequency oscillator]] and a [[phase detector]] in a [[feedback loop]].  The oscillator generates a periodic signal, and the phase detector compares the phase of that signal with the phase of the input periodic signal, adjusting the oscillator to keep the phases matched.

Keeping the input and output phase in lock step also implies keeping the input and output frequencies the same. Consequently, in addition to synchronizing signals, a phase-locked loop can track an input frequency, or it can generate a frequency that is a multiple of the input frequency.  These properties are used for computer clock synchronization, [[demodulation]], and [[frequency synthesis]].

Phase-locked loops are widely employed in [[radio]], [[telecommunications]], [[computer]]s and other electronic applications. They can be used to [[demodulation|demodulate]] a signal, recover a signal from a noisy communication channel, generate a stable frequency at multiples of an input frequency ([[frequency synthesis]]), or distribute precisely timed clock pulses in digital logic circuits such as [[microprocessor]]s. Since a single [[integrated circuit]] can provide a complete phase-locked-loop building block, the technique is widely used in modern electronic devices, with output frequencies from a fraction of a hertz up to many gigahertz.

==Practical analogies==

===Automobile race analogy===
As an analogy of a PLL, consider a race between two cars.  One represents the input frequency, the other the PLL's output [[voltage-controlled oscillator]] (VCO) frequency.  Each lap corresponds to a complete cycle. The number of laps per hour (a speed) corresponds to the frequency. The separation of the cars (a distance) corresponds to the phase difference between the two oscillating signals.

During most of the race, each car is on its own and free to pass the other and lap the other. This is analogous to the PLL in an unlocked state.

However, if there is an accident, a [[Racing flags#Yellow flag|yellow caution flag]] is raised.  This means neither of the race cars is permitted to overtake and pass the other car.  The two race cars represent the input and output frequency of the PLL in a locked state.  Each driver will measure the phase difference (a fraction of the distance around the lap) between themselves and the other race car.  If the hind driver is too far away, they will increase their speed to close the gap. If they are too close to the other car, the driver will slow down. The result is that both race cars will circle the track in lockstep with a fixed phase difference (or constant distance) between them.  Since neither car is allowed to lap the other, the cars make the same number of laps in a given time period.  Therefore the frequency of the two signals is the same.

===Clock analogy===
Phase can be proportional to time,{{Efn|If the frequency is constant and the initial phase is zero, then the phase of a sinusoid is proportional to time.}} so a phase difference can be a time difference. Clocks are, with varying degrees of accuracy, phase-locked (time-locked) to a leader clock.

Left on its own, each clock will mark time at slightly different rates. A wall clock, for example, might be fast by a few seconds per hour compared to the reference clock at [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]. Over time, that time difference would become substantial.

To keep the wall clock in sync with the reference clock, each week the owner compares the time on their wall clock to a more accurate clock (a phase comparison), and resets their clock. Left alone, the wall clock will continue to diverge from the reference clock at the same few seconds per hour rate.

Some clocks have a timing adjustment (a fast-slow control). When the owner compared their wall clock's time to the reference time, they noticed that their clock was too fast. Consequently, the owner could turn the timing adjust a small amount to make the clock run a little slower (frequency). If things work out right, their clock will be more accurate than before. Over a series of weekly adjustments, the wall clock's notion of a second would agree with the reference time (locked both in frequency and phase within the wall clock's stability).

An early [[electromechanical]] version of a  phase-locked loop was used in 1921 in the [[Shortt-Synchronome clock]].

==History==
Spontaneous synchronization of weakly coupled [[pendulum clock]]s was noted by the Dutch physicist [[Christiaan Huygens]] as early as 1673.&lt;ref&gt;Christiaan Huygens, ''Horologium Oscillatorium'' … (Paris, France:  F. Muguet, 1673),  [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_SOjZR1P1eE8C/page/n37 pages 18–19.]  From page 18:  ''&quot; … illudque accidit memoratu dignum, … brevi tempore reduceret.&quot;'' ( … and it is worth mentioning, since with two clocks constructed in this form and which we suspend in like manner, truly the cross beam is assigned two fulcrums [i.e., two pendulum clocks were suspended from the same wooden beam]; the motions of the pendulums thus share the opposite swings between the two [clocks], since the two clocks at no time move even a small distance, and the sound of both can be heard clearly together always: for if the innermost part [of one of the clocks] is disturbed with a little help, it will have been restored in a short time by the clocks themselves.)  English translation provided by Ian Bruce's translation of [http://www.17centurymaths.com/contents/huygens/horologiumpart1.pdf ''Horologium Oscillatorium'' … ], pages 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Around the turn of the 19th century, [[John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]] observed synchronization of weakly coupled organ pipes and tuning forks.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*  Lord Rayleigh, ''The Theory of Sound'' (London, England:  Macmillan, 1896), vol. 2.  The synchronization of organ pipes in opposed phase is mentioned in §322c, [https://archive.org/details/theorysound05raylgoog/page/n239 pages 221–222.]

H. Eccles]] and J. H. Vincent found that two electronic oscillators that had been tuned to oscillate at slightly different frequencies but that were coupled to a resonant circuit would soon oscillate at the same frequency.&lt;ref&gt;See:

Vincent, ''British Patent Specifications'', '''163''' :  462 (17 Feb. 1920).&lt;/ref&gt;  Automatic synchronization of electronic oscillators was described in 1923 by [[Edward Victor Appleton]].&lt;ref&gt;E. V. Appleton (1923) &quot;The automatic synchronization of triode oscillators,&quot; ''Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society'', '''21''' (Part III): 231–248.

In 1925 Professor David Robertson, first professor of electrical engineering at the [[University of Bristol]], introduced phase locking in his clock design to control the striking of the bell Great George in the new Wills Memorial  Building.  Robertson’s clock incorporated an electro-mechanical device that could vary the rate of oscillation of the pendulum, and derived correction signals from a circuit that compared the pendulum phase with that of an incoming telegraph pulse from Greenwich Observatory every morning at 10.00 GMT.  Apart from including equivalents of every element of a modern electronic PLL, Robertson’s system was notable in that its phase detector was a relay logic implementation of the phase/frequency detector not seen in electronic circuits until the 1970s.  Robertson’s work predated research towards what was later named the phase-lock loop in 1932, when British researchers developed an alternative to [[Edwin Armstrong]]'s [[superheterodyne receiver]], the [[Homodyne detection|Homodyne]] or [[direct-conversion receiver]]. In the homodyne or synchrodyne system, a [[local oscillator]] was tuned to the desired input frequency and multiplied with the input signal. The resulting output signal included the original modulation information.  The intent was to develop an alternative receiver circuit that required fewer tuned circuits than the superheterodyne receiver.  Since the local oscillator would rapidly drift in frequency, an automatic correction signal was applied to the oscillator, maintaining it in the same phase and frequency of the desired signal. The technique was described in 1932, in a paper by Henri de Bellescize, in the French journal ''L'Onde Électrique''.&lt;ref&gt;Henri de Bellescize, &quot;La réception synchrone,&quot; ''L'Onde Électrique'' (later: ''Revue de l'Electricité et de l'Electronique''), vol. 11, pages 230–240 (June 1932).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also:  French patent no. 635,451 (filed: 6 October 1931; issued: 29 September 1932); and U.S. patent [http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=01990428&amp;homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO2%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsearch-bool.html%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526co1%3DAND%2526d%3DPALL%2526s1%3D1,990,428.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F1,990,428%2526RS%3DPN%2F1,990,428&amp;PageNum=&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;Input=View+first+page &quot;Synchronizing system,&quot;] no. 1,990,428 (filed: 29 September 1932; issued: 5 February 1935).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uoguelph.ca/~antoon/gadgets/pll/pll.html Notes for a University of Guelph course describing the PLL and early history, including an IC PLL tutorial] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224002345/http://www.uoguelph.ca/~antoon/gadgets/pll/pll.html |date=2009-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In analog television receivers since at least the late 1930s, phase-locked-loop horizontal and vertical sweep circuits are locked to synchronization pulses in the broadcast signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sxlist.com/techref/io/video/ntsc.htm |title=National Television Systems Committee Video Display Signal IO |publisher=Sxlist.com |access-date=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Signetics]] introduced a line of monolithic [[integrated circuits]] like the NE565 that were complete phase-locked loop systems on a chip in 1969,&lt;ref&gt;A. B. Grebene, H. R. Camenzind, &quot;Phase Locking As A New Approach For Tuned Integrated Circuits&quot;, ISSCC Digest of Technical Papers, pp. 100–101, Feb. 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; applications for the technique multiplied. A few years later RCA introduced the &quot;[[List of 4000 series integrated circuits|CD4046]]&quot; [[CMOS]] Micropower Phase-Locked Loop, which became a popular integrated circuit.

==Structure and function==
Phase-locked loop mechanisms may be implemented as either analog or digital circuits. Both implementations use the same basic structure.
&lt;!--Incomplete block diagram is misleading. Removing until it can be fixed. See [[Talk:Phase-locked loop#Figure_needs_work.2C_I_think]]. [[File:SimplePLL.svg|right|thumb|Block diagram of a PLL (without filter or phase detector, both essential to the operation)]]--&gt;
Analog PLL circuits include four basic elements:
* [[Phase detector]],
* [[Low-pass filter]],
* [[Voltage controlled oscillator]], and
* [[feedback]] path (which may include a [[frequency divider]]).

===Variations===
There are several variations of PLLs.  Some terms that are used are analog phase-locked loop (APLL) also referred to as a linear phase-locked loop (LPLL), digital phase-locked loop (DPLL), all digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL), and software phase-locked loop (SPLL).&lt;ref name=&quot;Best 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Roland E. Best |title=Phase-Locked Loops: Design, Simulation and Applications |edition=6th |publisher=McGraw Hill |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-07-149375-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Analog or linear PLL (APLL):Phase detector is an analog multiplier. Loop filter is active or passive. Uses a [[voltage-controlled oscillator]] (VCO). APLL is said to be a ''type II'' if its loop filter has transfer function with exactly one pole at the origin (see also [[William_F._Egan|Egan's conjecture on the pull-in range of type II APLL]]).
; Digital PLL (DPLL): An analog PLL with a digital phase detector (such as XOR, edge-trigger JK, phase frequency detector). May have digital divider in the loop.
; All digital PLL (ADPLL): Phase detector, filter and oscillator are digital. Uses a [[numerically controlled oscillator]] (NCO).
; Software PLL (SPLL): Functional blocks are implemented by software rather than specialized hardware.
; Neuronal PLL (NPLL): Phase detector, filter and oscillator are neurons or small neuronal pools. Uses a [[rate controlled oscillator]] (RCO). Used for tracking and decoding low frequency modulations (&lt;{{nbsp}}1&amp;nbsp;kHz), such as those occurring during mammalian-like active sensing.
; [[Charge-pump_phase-locked_loop|Charge-pump PLL (CP-PLL)]]:CP-PLL is a modification of phase-locked loops with phase-frequency detector and square waveform signals. See also [[Floyd_M._Gardner#Garner's_conjecture_on_charge-pump_phase-lock_loops|Gardner's conjecture on CP-PLL]].

*Loop bandwidth: Defining the speed of the control loop.
*Transient response: Like overshoot and settling time to a certain accuracy (like 50 ppm).
*Steady-state errors: Like remaining phase or timing error.
*Output spectrum purity: Like sidebands generated from a certain VCO tuning voltage ripple.
*Phase-noise: Defined by noise energy in a certain frequency band (like 10&amp;nbsp;kHz offset from carrier). Highly dependent on VCO phase-noise, PLL bandwidth, etc.
*General parameters: Such as power consumption, supply voltage range, output amplitude, etc.

==Applications==
Phase-locked loops are widely used for [[synchronization]] purposes; in space [[telecommunication|communications]] for [[coherent demodulation]] and [[Noise gate#Audio noise reduction|threshold extension]], [[bit synchronization]], and symbol synchronization. Phase-locked loops can also be used to [[demodulate]] [[frequency modulation|frequency-modulated]] signals.  In radio transmitters, a PLL is used to synthesize new frequencies which are a multiple of a reference frequency, with the same stability as the reference frequency.

Other applications include
* [[Demodulation]] of [[frequency modulation]] (FM): If PLL is locked to a FM signal, the VCO tracks the instantaneous frequency of the input signal. The filtered error voltage which controls the VCO and maintains lock with the input signal is demodulated FM output. The VCO transfer characteristics determine the linearity of the demodulated out. Since the VCO used in an integrated-circuit PLL is highly linear, it is possible to realize highly linear FM demodulators. 
* Demodulation of [[frequency-shift keying]] (FSK): In digital data communication and computer peripherals, binary data is transmitted by means of a carrier frequency which is shifted between two preset frequencies.
* Recovery of small signals that otherwise would be lost in noise ([[lock-in amplifier]] to track the reference frequency)
* Recovery of clock timing information from a data stream such as from a [[disk drive]]
* [[CPU multiplier|Clock multipliers]] in [[microprocessors]] that allow internal processor elements to run faster than external connections, while maintaining precise timing relationships
* Demodulation of [[modem]]s and other tone signals for [[telecommunications]] and [[remote control]].
* [[Digital signal processing|DSP]] of [[video]] signals; Phase-locked loops are also used to synchronize phase and frequency to the input [[analog video]] signal so it can be [[sample (signal)|sampled]] and digitally processed
* [[Atomic force microscopy]] in [[Non-contact atomic force microscopy#Frequency modulation|frequency modulation]] mode, to detect changes of the cantilever resonance frequency due to tip–surface interactions
* [[DC motor]] [[motor controller|drive]]

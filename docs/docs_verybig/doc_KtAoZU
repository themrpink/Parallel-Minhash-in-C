and the h-parameters are given by:
* ''h''&lt;sub&gt;ix&lt;/sub&gt; = ''h''&lt;sub&gt;ie&lt;/sub&gt; for the common-emitter configuration, the '''i'''nput impedance of the transistor (corresponding to the base resistance ''r''&lt;sub&gt;pi&lt;/sub&gt;).
* ''h''&lt;sub&gt;rx&lt;/sub&gt; = ''h''&lt;sub&gt;re&lt;/sub&gt;, a '''r'''everse transfer relationship, it represents the dependence of the transistor's (input) ''I''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;ndash;''V''&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt; curve on the value of (output) ''V''&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt;. It is usually very small and is often neglected (assumed to be zero) at DC.
* ''h''&lt;sub&gt;fx&lt;/sub&gt; = ''h''&lt;sub&gt;fe&lt;/sub&gt;, the &quot;forward&quot; current-gain of the transistor, sometimes written ''h&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;''. This parameter, with lower case &quot;fe&quot; to imply small signal (AC) gain, or more often with capital letters for &quot;FE&quot; (specified as ''h''&lt;sub&gt;FE&lt;/sub&gt;) to mean the &quot;large signal&quot; or DC current-gain (''β''&lt;sub&gt;DC&lt;/sub&gt; or often simply ''β''), is one of the main parameters in datasheets, and may be given for a typical collector current and voltage or plotted as a function of collector current. See below.
* ''h''&lt;sub&gt;ox&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/''h''&lt;sub&gt;oe&lt;/sub&gt;, the output impedance of transistor. The parameter ''h''&lt;sub&gt;oe&lt;/sub&gt; usually corresponds to the output admittance of the bipolar transistor and has to be inverted to convert it to an impedance.

As shown, the h-parameters have lower-case subscripts and hence signify AC conditions or analyses. For DC conditions they are specified in upper-case. For the CE topology, an approximate h-parameter model is commonly used which further simplifies the circuit analysis. For this the ''h''&lt;sub&gt;oe&lt;/sub&gt; and ''h''&lt;sub&gt;re&lt;/sub&gt; parameters are neglected (that is, they are set to infinity and zero, respectively). The h-parameter model as shown is suited to low-frequency, small-signal analysis. For high-frequency analyses the inter-electrode capacitances that are important at high frequencies must be added.

=====Etymology of h&lt;sub&gt;FE&lt;/sub&gt;=====
The ''h'' refers to its being an h-parameter, a set of parameters named for their origin in a '''''h'''ybrid equivalent circuit'' model (see above). As with all h parameters, the choice of lower case or capitals for the letters that follow the &quot;h&quot; is significant; lower-case signify &quot;small signal&quot; parameters, that is, the slope the particular relationship; upper-case letters imply &quot;large signal&quot; or [[Direct Current|DC]] values, the ratio of the voltages or currents. In the case of the very often used ''h&lt;sub&gt;FE&lt;/sub&gt;'':
* ''F'' is from '''''F'''orward current amplification'' also called the current gain. 
* ''E'' refers to the transistor operating in a ''common '''E'''mitter'' (CE) configuration. 
So h&lt;sub&gt;FE&lt;/sub&gt; (or hFE) refers to the (total; DC) collector current divided by the base current, and is dimensionless. It is a parameter that varies somewhat with collector current, but is often approximated as a constant; it is normally specified at a typical collector current and voltage, or graphed as a function of collector current.

Had capital letters not been used for used in the subscript, i.e. if it were written ''h&lt;sub&gt;fe&lt;/sub&gt;'' the parameter indicate small signal ([[Alternating Current|AC]]) current gain, i.e. the slope of the Collector current versus Base current graph at a given point, which is often close to the hFE value unless the test frequency is high.

==Applications==
The BJT remains a device that excels in some applications, such as discrete circuit design, due to the very wide selection of BJT types available, and because of its high [[transconductance]] and output resistance compared to [[MOSFET]]s.

The BJT is also the choice for demanding analog circuits, especially for [[very-high-frequency]] applications, such as [[radio-frequency]] circuits for wireless systems.

===High-speed digital logic===
[[Emitter-coupled logic]] (ECL) use BJTs.

Bipolar transistors can be combined with MOSFETs in an integrated circuit by using a [[BiCMOS]] process of wafer fabrication to create circuits that take advantage of the application strengths of both types of transistor.

===Amplifiers===
{{Main article|Electronic amplifier}}
The [[#Transistor parameters: alpha (α) and beta (β)|transistor parameters]] α and β characterizes the [[gain (electronics)|current gain]] of the BJT. It is this gain that allows BJTs to be used as the building blocks of electronic amplifiers. The three main BJT amplifier topologies are:
* [[Common emitter]]
* [[Common base]]
* [[Common collector]]

===Temperature sensors===
{{Main article|Silicon bandgap temperature sensor}}
Because of the known temperature and current dependence of the forward-biased base–emitter junction voltage, the BJT can be used to measure temperature by subtracting two voltages at two different bias currents in a known ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/appnote_number/689 | title=IC Temperature Sensors Find the Hot Spots - Application Note - Maxim | date=February 21, 2002 | website=maxim-ic.com | access-date=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logarithmic converters===
Because base–emitter voltage varies as the logarithm of the base–emitter and collector–emitter currents, a BJT can also be used to compute [[logarithm]]s and anti-logarithms. A diode can also perform these nonlinear functions but the transistor provides more circuit flexibility.

==Vulnerabilities==
Exposure of the transistor to [[ionizing radiation]] causes [[radiation hardening|radiation damage]]. Radiation causes a buildup of 'defects' in the base region that act as [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombination centers]]. The resulting reduction in minority carrier lifetime causes gradual loss of gain of the transistor.

Transistors have &quot;maximum ratings&quot;, including [[power rating]]s (essentially limited by self-heating), maximum collector and base currents (both continuous/DC ratings and peak), and [[breakdown voltage]] ratings, beyond which the device may fail or at least perform badly.

In addition to normal breakdown ratings of the device, power BJTs are subject to a failure mode called [[secondary breakdown]], in which excessive current and normal imperfections in the silicon die cause portions of the silicon inside the device to become disproportionately hotter than the others. The electrical resistivity of doped silicon, like other semiconductors, has a negative [[temperature coefficient]], meaning that it conducts more current at higher temperatures. Thus, the hottest part of the die conducts the most current, causing its conductivity to increase, which then causes it to become progressively hotter again, until the device fails internally. The [[thermal runaway]] process associated with secondary breakdown, once triggered, occurs almost instantly and may catastrophically damage the transistor package.

If the emitter-base junction is reverse biased into [[avalanche breakdown|avalanche]] or [[Zener breakdown|Zener]] mode and charge flows for a short period of time, the current gain of the BJT will be permanently degraded.

{{For|the Ylvis song|Trucker's Hitch}}

The '''trucker's hitch''' is a compound [[knot]] commonly used for securing loads on [[truck]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;nzroadcode&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=Heavy Vehicle Road Code|location=New Zealand|year=2016|url=https://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/roadcode/heavy-vehicle-road-code/tlc-general-requirements/load-securing-equipment/=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailers]].   This general arrangement, using [[loop (knot)|loops]] and [[Turn (knot)|turn]]s in the [[rope]] itself to form a crude [[block and tackle]], has long been used to tension lines and is known by multiple names.&lt;ref name=&quot;pawpock&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aksday&quot;/&gt;  Knot author Geoffrey Budworth claims the knot can be traced back to the days when [[wikt:carter|carter]]s and [[Hawker (trade)|hawker]]s used horse-drawn conveyances to move their wares from place to place.&lt;ref name=&quot;budult&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Knots|author=Geoffrey Budworth|location=London|publisher=Hermes House|year=1999|pages=224–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
The portion of the trucker's hitch which differs in the following variations is the method used to form the loop which the [[working end]] slides through to produce the [[mechanical advantage]].  The different methods of forming the loop affect the ease and speed of tying and releasing and the stability of the final product.

The variations are presented in order of increasing stability.

===Sheepshank style loop===
This version of the knot uses a [[sheepshank]]-like construction, in this kind of application also known as a ''bell ringer's knot'', to form the loop.  It is quicker to make than a fixed loop, but is less dependable.&lt;ref name=&quot;pawpock&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ashley344&quot;&gt;{{citation |last=Ashley |first=Clifford W. |title=The Ashley Book of Knots |year= 1944 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |page=344 |quote=A quicker but less dependable lashing is based on the Bell Ringer's Knot #1148.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is avoided in critical applications (such as securing a load on a truck) as it can fall apart under too little load or too much load, and can [[knot#Capsizing|capsize]] if not dressed properly.&lt;ref name=&quot;perryknots&quot;/&gt;   However, this knot may be made secure by adding a Half Hitch by using the top bight of the Sheepshank.  This form of the trucker's hitch is least likely to [[Knot#Releasability|jam]], coming apart easily once tension is released.   Different sources show slight variations in the way the sheepshank portion is formed and dressed.

Versions popular in East Asia use variations of sheep shank using either a simple half hitch &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTiGUYhW1A8 Truckers' hitch using a simple turn half hitch sheep shank eye&lt;/ref&gt; or a double turn self crossing half hitch &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Y4xcd-e6rA   Truckers' hitch using a double and crossing turn sheep shank eye&lt;/ref&gt; or a triple  turn self crossing half hitch.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9_yT8HJF64  Trucker's hitch using a double and crossing turn sheep shank upper eye, and twisted lower eye&lt;/ref&gt; A sheep shank with two consecutive half hitches i.e. a [[clove hitch]] to secure the upper eye and to form the lower eye is more popular in the west.

===Slipped overhand loop===
The loop formed in one version is a simple [[Overhand knot with draw-loop|Slipped Overhand Loop]]. This version is good for light to moderate loads

===Simple friction loop===
Another version uses a multiply twisted bight to pass a  bight of the working end to form the eye of the loop. This version tolerates higher load.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvgFyqFZK54 The Truckers' Hitch - tied 3 different ways&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Fixed loop===
The most reliable common variation uses a fixed loop, such as an [[alpine butterfly loop]], [[artillery loop]], [[figure-eight loop]], or another of many suitable loop knots.&lt;ref name=&quot;perryknots&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ashley271&quot;&gt;Ashley, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;  If a fixed loop is used repeatedly for tying the trucker's hitch in the same portion of rope, excessive wear or other damage may be suffered by the portion of the loop which working end slides against.&lt;ref name=&quot;pawpock&quot;/&gt;

If extra loops are used to form the eye it tends to ease untying.  In order to prevent the closing of the loop  under load, the loop must be formed by the working end of the rope (which will later pass through the loop). If the standing end goes through the loop, it will close under load.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Finishing the hitch==

In tightening the trucker's hitch, tension can be effectively increased by repeatedly pulling sideways while preventing the tail end from slipping through the loop, and then cinching the knot tighter as the sideways force is released.  This is called &quot;sweating a line&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;troublesafloat&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=Handling Troubles Afloat|author=John Mellor|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|year=1996|publisher=Sheridan House|pages=195–196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once tight, the trucker's hitch is often secured with a [[half hitch]], usually [[slipped loop|slipped]] for easy releasing and to avoid the necessity of access to the end of the rope, though a more secure finish, such as [[two half-hitches]], may be called for. Under large loads, the finishing half hitch can jam, especially if it is not slipped; the difficulty of releasing it can be compounded by the fact that the knot is typically still under tension when it is untied.

Finishing with a [[taut-line hitch]] or a [[Farrimond friction hitch]] to the standing part allows the finishing knot to be tied and untied with no tension.  This eliminates any jamming problems and also allows the line to be re-tensioned if necessary.

==Mechanical advantage and friction==
[[Image:PolispastoN.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Conceptually similar arrangement of pulleys]]
All common variations of the trucker's hitch use a loop in the standing part of the rope and the anchor point as makeshift [[pulley]]s in order to ''theoretically'' obtain a 3 to 1 mechanical advantage while pulling on the working end.

There is sometimes confusion about how much theoretical mechanical advantage is provided by the trucker's hitch.  If the trucker's hitch were to be used as in the pulley diagram at right, to lift a weight off the floor, the theoretical mechanical advantage would be only 2:1.  However in the common use of the trucker's hitch, a static hook, ring, or rail, serves as the lower pulley, and the rope across the top of the load is the portion being tensioned.   Thus, the standing part of the rope is represented by the top anchor point in the diagram, and the theoretical ratio is indeed 3:1 when the working end is tensioned.  That is, in a frictionless system, every unit of force exerted on the working end would produce 3 units in the standing part of the rope over the load.  In the typical use of the trucker's hitch, where it is used to tighten a rope over a load, when the end is secured to the loop of the Truckers hitch and let go, the tension in the two segments of rope around the ring will rise 50%, unless the rope slackens when it is being tied off, in which case the tension may drop to any value or even zero if enough slack is allowed. But when the trucker's hitch is used as in the diagram, after tying off, the load on the attachment point above the top pulley will drop to 100&amp;nbsp;N and the tension in the two lines going to the lower pulley will not change.

Theoretical considerations aside, in real world use the mechanical advantage of the trucker's hitch is significantly less than the ideal case due to the effects of [[friction]]. Friction has been reported to reduce the mechanical advantage from 3 to 1, to well less than 2 to 1 in many cases. One advantage of the friction within the trucker's hitch, compared to a hypothetical pulley-based system, is that it allows the hitch to be held taut with less force while the working end is secured.

== Cultural references ==

The trucker's hitch knot is portrayed by comedy duo [[Ylvis]] in their 2014 [[Trucker's Hitch|song with the same name]]. The lyrics and the video pretend (in a humorous way) to demonstrate how to tie the knot.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|TUHgGK-tImY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

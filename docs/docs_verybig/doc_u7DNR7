==== Whole Word ====

Whole word, also known as &quot;Sight Word&quot; and &quot;Look and Say&quot;, teaches reading skills and strategies in the context of authentic literature. Word recognition accuracy is considered less important than meaning accuracy; therefore, there is an emphasis on comprehension as the ultimate goal.

Students that use this method memorize the appearance of words or learn to recognize words by looking at the first and last letter from rigidly selected vocabularies in progressive texts (such as ''[[The Cat in the Hat]]''). Preliminary results often show that children taught with this method have higher reading levels than children learning phonics, because they learn to automatically recognize a small selection of words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Marilyn|title=Beginning to Read: Thinking and Learning About Print|url=https://archive.org/details/beginningtoreadt00adam_845|url-access=limited|year=1995|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=[https://archive.org/details/beginningtoreadt00adam_845/page/n48 38]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later tests demonstrate that literacy development becomes stunted when they are exposed to longer and more complex words later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams, MJ 23,24&quot;/&gt;

==== Phonics ====
{{Main|Phonics}}
Phonics refers to an instructional method for teaching children to read. The method associates sounds with letters and combinations of letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Nila B.|date=September 1957|title=What Research Says about Phonics Instruction|jstor=27530006|journal=The Journal of Educational Research|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd.|volume=51|issue=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.1080/00220671.1957.10882430}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=27530006|title=What Research Says about Phonics Instruction|first=Nila B.|last=Smith|date=1 January 1957|journal=The Journal of Educational Research|volume=51|issue=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.1080/00220671.1957.10882430}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moats, Louisa |title=Spelling: development, disabilities, and instruction |publisher=York Press |location=Baltimore, Md |year=1995 |pages= |isbn=0-912752-40-8 |oclc=33404834 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[Phonics]]&quot; is distinct from the [[linguistics]] terms &quot;[[phoneme]]&quot; and &quot;[[phonetics]]&quot;, which refer to sounds and the study of sounds respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pnas.org/content/109/8/E505|title=Phoneme and word recognition in the auditory ventral stream, PNAS.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://linguistics.ucla.edu/undergraduate/what-is-linguistics/|title=What is linguistics, UCLA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Varieties of phonics include:

* [[Whole language|Embedded phonics]] – an instructional approach where letter sounds are taught as the need arises and in meaningful contexts, such as the reading of a storybook. Embedded phonics is often associated with a whole language approach to teaching reading.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}
* [[Synthetic phonics]] and analytic phonics – instructional approaches that generally involve explicit, carefully sequenced instructions that teach a large body of phonics patterns.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
**Synthetic phonics emphasizes the one-to-one correspondences between [[phonemes]] and [[graphemes]]. In synthetic phonics programs, students say the sounds for the graphemes they see and orally blend them to produce a spoken word. In the context of phonics, the word &quot;[[wikt:blend|blend]]&quot; takes on a different meaning from its use in [[linguistics]].
** In analytic phonics, students often learn phonograms, the [[syllable rime|rime]] parts of words including the vowel and what follows it. Students are taught to generalize the [[Phonogram (linguistics)|phonogram]] to multiple words. The phonogram ''-ail'' can be used to read ''fail, trail, mail, wail, sail'', and other words.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The [[Samuel Orton|Orton phonography]], originally developed to teach brain-damaged adults to read, is a form of phonics instruction that blends synthetic and analytic components. Orton described 73 &quot;phonograms&quot;, or letter combinations, and 23 rules for spelling and pronunciation which Orton claimed would allow the reader to correctly pronounce and spell all but 123 of the 13,000 most common English words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eslhq.com/forums/esl-articles/teaching-reading-121/|title=Teaching of Reading - ESL Articles - eslHQ|website=www.eslhq.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pronunciation guides ====
In contrast to phonics which teaches the pronunciation rules of English, a [[Google Chrome]] extension—[[Phonetically Intuitive English]]—directly shows English words' pronunciation by adding diacritical marks on them to disambiguate pronunciation rules (for example, &quot;ea&quot; has a wide range of diverse pronunciations in &quot;speak&quot;, &quot;steak&quot;, &quot;bread&quot;, &quot;Korea&quot;, &quot;reality&quot;, &quot;create&quot; and &quot;ocean&quot;).

The pronunciation-guide approach has proven to be very successful in reading education for languages with very complex orthography such as Chinese.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}} [[Pinyin]] and [[Zhuyin]] are systems of phonetic transcription for Mandarin Chinese used in [[China]] and [[Taiwan]] respectively, and are printed above or next to Chinese characters in children's books, textbooks, and newspapers as a pronunciation guide. They have enabled Chinese-speaking countries to achieve high literacy rates for one of the most difficult languages in the world.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}}

=== Other instructional methods ===

====Guided reading====
During guided reading teachers work with small groups of students with similar reading levels. Students read with teachers in books at their reading level; the teachers work with the students to practice decoding, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension skills.

====Native reading====
Native reading differs from phonics and whole word learning by teaching students to read at an early age to take advantage of the human brain's high receptivity to learning a language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nativereading.com/introduction.html Native Reading Chapter 1] by Timothy Kailing&lt;/ref&gt; Native readers learn to read as toddlers roughly around the same time that they learn to speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kailing | first = Timothy D. | title = Native Reading | publisher = Elliptical Research Books |year=2008 | ISBN = 978-1-4348-4881-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reading Workshop ====
Reading Workshop is based on the premise that readers need time to read and discuss their reading.  Readers need access to a wide variety of reading materials of their choice; as such, classrooms must acquire a wide variety of reading materials to accommodate this need. Readers need to respond to the text and demonstrate quality literate behaviors. Instead of a script, a framework is provided to guide instruction. Students are exposed to a variety of learning experiences and are given time for student collaboration and engaged reading.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serafini&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Serafini|first=Frank |url=http://www.frankserafini.com/MainPages/WorkshopHandouts.html |title=Workshop Handouts Serafini, F. (2008) |website= |accessdate=March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Reading Workshop, the teacher models a whole-group strategy lesson and gives students large blocks of time to read and practice the strategy. This practice can occur independently, with partners, or in small groups with a book or text chosen by the student. The teacher talks with the students about their reading.  The teacher can meet with small, flexible groups to provide additional needs-based instruction. At the end of the workshop, the whole group comes together to share their learning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goudvis&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Anne Goudvis |author2=Stephanie Harvey |title=Strategies that work: teaching comprehension for understanding and engagement |publisher=Stenhouse Publishers |location=York, Me |year=2007 |pages=37–38 |isbn=978-1-57110-481-6 |oclc=232347335 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of improving reading===
An adult or peer reads with the student by modeling fluent reading and then asking the student to read the same passage aloud with encouragement and feedback by the adult or peer. A student listens to a tape of a fluent reader reading text at the student's independent level at about 80–100 words a minute. The student listens to the tape the first time and then practices reading along with the tape until the student can read fluently. The student reads with a peer partner, and they both take turns reading to the other. A more fluent reader can be paired with a less fluent reader to model fluent reading, provide feedback, and encourage the less fluent reader. Students with similar reading skills can also be paired, particularly if the teacher has modeled fluent reading and the partner reading involves practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Guided Oral Reading?|url=http://www.readingrockets.org/article/what-guided-oral-reading|website=Reading Rockets|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reading comprehension ====
{{Main|Reading comprehension}}

Reading comprehension requires making sense of text, which allows a reader to gain knowledge, enjoy a story, and make connections with the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cain 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cain|first=Kate|title=Making Sense of Text: Skills That Support Text Comprehension and Its Development|journal=Expert Perspectives on Interventions for Reading: A Collection of Best Practice Articles from the International Dyslexia Association|year=2009|pages= |url=http://www.eprints.lancs.ac.uk/26618/1/Cain2009IDAPerspectives.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several skills support reading comprehension, such as making predictions and inferences, monitoring understanding, using text structures, and using prior knowledge effectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cain 2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Duffy 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Duffy|first=Gerald|title=Explaining Reading: A Resource for Teaching Concepts, Skills, and Strategies|url=https://archive.org/details/explainingreadin0000duff|url-access=limited|year=2009|publisher=The Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60623-075-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/explainingreadin0000duff/page/19 19]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the most important aspects of successful comprehension are activation of prior knowledge and metacognition, which are identified in the National Research Council's report.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Donovan&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Donovan|first=M.

Many studies have identified the importance of activating prior knowledge in reading comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2307/1511053|title=The Effects of Prior Knowledge and Schema Activation Strategies on the Inferential Reading Comprehension of Children with and without Learning Disabilities, Sonya C.

Metacognition greatly influences reading comprehension. The metacognitive approach to instruction can help students learn to master their learning by defining learning goals and monitoring their progress in achieving them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donovan&quot;/&gt; Research indicates that accomplished readers &quot;monitor their comprehension as they read by engag[ing] in strategic processing, such as rereading the previous text, to resolve comprehension failure&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cain 2009&quot;/&gt; Students who are unable to track their understanding gain neither information nor enjoyment from reading as they do not know how to obtain meaning from the text.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Many strategies have been applied.&lt;ref name=&quot; McNamara 2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot; McKeown 2009&quot;/&gt;  Many studies recommend strategy instruction particularly for students who have poor comprehension skills.&lt;ref name=&quot;McNamara 2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot; McKeown 2009&quot;/&gt; Some helpful strategies are summarization, question generation, making predictions and inferences, image formation, knowledge and use of text structure, rereading, self-regulation, activation of prior knowledge, questioning the author, and using graphic organizers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cain 2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McNamara 2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McKeown 2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tolman|first=Carol|title=Working Smarter, Not Harder: What Teachers of Reading Need to Know and Be Able to Teach|journal=Expert Perspectives on Interventions for Reading: A Collection of Best-Practice Articles from the International Dyslexia Association|year=2012|pages= |url=http://www.winsorlearning.com/site/resources/articles/working-smarter-not-harder/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The variety of strategies allows the teacher to choose a strategy or strategies to suit the text and the needs of the student.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Success rate==
{{Main|Literacy in the United States}}

National literacy rates range from about 10 percent to over 99 percent.

There are several approaches used to teach reading, which the U.S. Office of Education Cooperative Research Program has compiled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How to Teach Balanced Reading and Writing|last=Burns|first=Bonnie|publisher=Corwin Press|year=2006|isbn=1412937418|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there is a list based on 29 individual studies that identify effective approaches to teach reading to beginners. Most of the studies revealed that successful instructional strategies include [[Phonics#Systematic_phonics|systematic phonics]] and approaches that focus on connected reading and meaning. These strategies were proven to be more effective than basal approaches alone. Specific studies showing instructional models that achieve high success rates in reading education include the Actual Community Empowerment (ACE) program—a small-group tutoring framework that focuses on fluency, [[word recognition]], decoding, and comprehension that is based on the appropriate pace of learning according to individual learning profiles.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Community Action Research: Benefits to Community Members and Service Providers|last=Reeb|first=Roger|publisher=Haworth Press|year=2006|isbn=9780789030467|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ACE was implemented in 40 locations in [[Philadelphia]], learners exhibited a 95 percent success rate for significant reading improvement.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Traditional reading instruction approaches that are considered effective include those under a [[Cognitive model|cognitive-based model]], which considers reading acquisition and reading comprehension to be dependent on [[cognitive development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cognitive Revolution on Educational Psychology|last=Royer|first=James|publisher=Information Age Publishing|year=2006|isbn=1593111630|location=Greenwich, CT|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Print exposure ==
Print exposure is the amount of time a person spends being visually aware of the written word (reading) through media like newspapers, magazines, books, journals, and scientific papers. Research has shown that the amount of print material that a child accesses has deep cognitive consequences.

Children who are exposed to large amounts of print often have more success in reading and have a larger vocabulary to draw from than children who see less print. The average conversations among college graduates, spouses, or adult friends contain less rare (advanced) words than the average preschool reading book. Other print sources have increasingly higher amounts of rare words, from children's books to adult books, popular magazines, newspapers, and scientific articles. Television, even adult news shows, do not have the same level of rare words that children's books do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Massaro |first1=Dominic W. |title=Two Different Communication Genres and Implications for Vocabulary Development and Learning to Read |journal=Journal of Literacy Research |date=17 February 2016 |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=505–527 |doi=10.1177/1086296X15627528 |accessdate=11 July 2020|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An issue with spoken language is repetition. A child needs to have a large vocabulary in order to learn to read efficiently; without one, they have trouble following a sentence's idea when they encounter words that they do not know, which can lead to frustration and a dislike of reading. When a child is faced with this difficulty they are less likely to read, which further inhibits their vocabulary's growth.

Children who enjoy reading do it more frequently and improve their vocabulary. A study of out-of-school reading of fifth graders found that a student in the 50th percentile read books about 5 minutes a day, while a student in the 20th percentile read books for less than a minute a day. It also found that the amount of time a child in the 10th percentile spent reading in two days was the amount of time a child in the 90th percentile spent reading all year.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Print exposure can also be a big factor in learning English as a second language. The [[Extensive reading|book flood]] program brought books in English to the classroom. Through focusing their English language learning on reading books instead of endless worksheets the teachers were able to improve the rate at which their students learned English.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

== Alphabetic principle and English orthography ==
{{Main|Alphabetic principle}}

{{Further|History of the English language}}

Beginning readers must understand the concept of the &quot;alphabetic principle&quot; to master basic reading skills. A [[writing system]] is said to be alphabetic if it uses symbols to represent individual language sounds. In comparison, [[Logogram#Logographic systems|logographic writing systems]] such as [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]] [[kanji]] and [[Written Chinese|Chinese]] [[Chinese characters|hanzi]] use a symbol to represent a word.

English is one of several languages that use [[Latin script]]. The [[orthographic depth]] of such languages varies: The [[Italian orthography|Italian]] and [[Finnish language]]s have the purest or shallowest orthographies, while [[English orthography]] is the deepest or most complex. In the shallow [[Spanish language|Spanish]] orthography, most words are spelled the way they sound; that is, word spellings are almost always regular. English orthography, on the other hand, is far more complex in that it does not have a one-to-one correspondence between symbols and sounds. English has individual sounds that can be represented by more than one symbol or symbol combination. For example, the /{{IPA|eɪ}}/ diphthong can be represented by a-[[consonant]]-e as in &quot;ate&quot;, -ay as in &quot;hay&quot;, -ea as in &quot;steak&quot;, -ey as in &quot;they&quot;, -ai as in &quot;pain&quot;, and -ei as in &quot;vein&quot;. There are also many words with irregular spelling and [[homophones]]. Pollack Pickeraz (1963) asserted that there are 45 phonemes in the [[English language]] and that the 26 letters of the English alphabet can represent them in about 350 ways.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}}

The irregularity of English spelling is largely an artifact of how the language developed. English is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] language with substantial influences and additional vocabulary from other languages like [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[French language|French]]. Imported words usually follow the spelling patterns of their language of origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;King 2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Diana Hanbury King |title=English isn't crazy!: the elements of our language and how to teach them |publisher=York Press |location=Baltimore, Md |year=2000 |pages=xii, 15|isbn=0-912752-59-9 |oclc=45166702 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced English phonics instruction includes studying words according to their origin, and how to determine the correct spelling of a word using its language of origin.

The complexity of [[English orthography]] makes it harder for children to learn decoding and encoding rules, and harder for teachers to teach them.&lt;ref name=&quot;King 2000&quot; /&gt; However, effective [[word recognition]] relies on the basic understanding that letters represent the sounds of spoken language; that is, word recognition relies on the reader's understanding of the [[alphabetic principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Marilyn|title=Beginning to Read: Thinking and Learning About Print|url=https://archive.org/details/beginningtoreadt00adam_845|url-access=limited|year=1995|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=[https://archive.org/details/beginningtoreadt00adam_845/page/n39 29]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spelling reform ===
{{Main|Spelling reform}}

Attempts to make English spelling behave phonetically have given rise to various [[spelling reform]] campaigns; none have been generally accepted. Opponents of simplified spellings point to the impossibility of phonetic spelling for a language with many diverse accents and dialects. Several distinguished scholars, however, have thoroughly disproven all reasonable objections to spelling reform, including this objection; for example, the ''Dictionary of Simplified American Spelling'' was published''.''&lt;ref&gt;Rondthaler, Edward and Edward J. Lias, ''Dictionary of Simplified American Spelling'' (New York: The American Language Academy, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Lounsbury presented a rebuttal to all reasonable objections to spelling reform in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lounsbury, Thomas Raynesford |title=English spelling and spelling reform |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn |year=1970 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/englishspellings00lounuoft/page/331 331]–341 |isbn=0-8371-4264-4 |oclc=134359 |url=https://archive.org/details/englishspellings00lounuoft|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A shorter rebuttal of all the reasonable objections to spelling reform was made by Bob C Cleckler in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bob C.

Linguists who document speech sounds use various special symbols, of which the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] is the most widely known. Linguistics makes a distinction between a [[Phone (phonetics)|phone]] and phoneme, and between [[phonology]] and [[phonetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://esl.fis.edu/grammar/langdiff/phono.htm|title=Language differences - Phonetics and phonology|last=Shoebottom|first=Paul|website=esl.fis.edu|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of words and their structure is [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and the smallest units of meaning are [[morpheme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntid.rit.edu/sea/processes/wordknowledge/grammatical/whatare|title=What are Morphemes? {{!}} SEA - Supporting English Acquisition|website=www.ntid.rit.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of the relationship between words present in the language at one time is [[etymology|synchronic etymology]], part of [[descriptive linguistics]], and the study of word origins and evolution is [[etymology|diachronic etymology]], part of [[historical linguistics]].

[[English orthography]] prioritizes morphology, etymology, and phonetics in descending order. Thus the spelling of a word is dependent principally upon its structure, its relationship to other words, and its language and origin. It is usually necessary to know the meaning of a word to spell it correctly, and its meaning will be indicated by the similarity to words of the same meaning and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.myenglishlanguage.com/linguistics-language-guide/english-orthography/|title=English Orthography - The English Writing System - English Spelling|work=My English Language|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[English language|English]] uses a 26-letter [[Latin alphabet]], but the number of [[grapheme]]s is expanded by several [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], [[Trigraph (orthography)|trigraphs]], and [[tetragraph]]s. The letter &quot;q&quot; does not exist as a grapheme by itself; it is only used in the digraph &quot;qu&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theschoolrun.com/what-is-a-grapheme|title=What is a grapheme?|work=TheSchoolRun|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each grapheme may represent a limited number of phonemes depending on [[etymology]] and location in the world. Likewise, each phoneme may be represented by a limited number of graphemes. Some letters are not part of any grapheme, but function as etymological markers. Graphemes do not cross [[morpheme]] boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prowritingaid.com/art/317/What-are-Phonemes,-Graphemes,-and-Digraphs.aspx|title=What is the Difference Between a Phoneme, a Grapheme and a Digraph?|website=prowritingaid.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morphemes are spelled consistently, following rules inflection and word-formation, and allow readers and writers to understand and produce words they have not previously encountered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tesol-direct.com/tesol-resources/english-grammar-guide/morphemes/|title=Morphemes in English grammar {{!}} TESOL Direct|work=TESOL Direct|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Initial teaching alphabet ====
{{Main|Initial teaching alphabet}}
This method was designed to overcome the fact that English orthography has a many-to-many relationship between graphemes and phonemes. The method fell into disuse because children still had to learn the [[Latin alphabet]] and the conventional English spellings to integrate with society outside of school. It also recreated the problem of dialect dependent spelling, which the standardization of spelling had been created to eliminate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://itafoundation.org/about-us/what-is-i-t-a/|title=Initial Teaching Alphabet Foundation {{!}} What is i.t.a.?|website=itafoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Augmenting spelling with pronunciation information ===

Unlike spelling reforms, a word's original spelling can be kept intact but add pronunciation information to it, e.g. using [[Diacritic|diacritics]].

== Practical application ==

In practice, many children are exposed to both &quot;phonics&quot; and &quot;whole language&quot; methods which are coupled with reading programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allaboutlearningpress.com/whole-language-or-phonics-which-approach-is-best|title=Whole Language or Phonics: Which Approach Is Best?|website=www.allaboutlearningpress.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the book ''Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons'', by Siegfried Engelman, et al. ({{ISBN|0-671-63198-5}}), teaches pronunciation and simple phonics, and is supplemented with progressive texts and practice in directed reading. The result of a mixed-method is a casually phonetic student and a better first-time pronouncer and speller, who also has look-say acquisition, quick fluency, and comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.observerbd.com/2015/02/13/72233.php|title=Eclectic approach to teaching language|website=www.observerbd.com|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

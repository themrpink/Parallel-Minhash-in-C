'''Soapstone''' (also known as '''steatite''' or '''soaprock''') is a [[talc]]-[[schist]], which is a type of [[metamorphic rock]].  It is composed largely of the [[magnesium]] rich mineral [[talc]].  It is produced by dynamothermal [[metamorphism]] and [[metasomatism]], which occur in the zones where [[tectonic plates]] are [[subduction|subducted]], changing rocks by heat and pressure, with influx of fluids, but without melting. It has been a medium for carving for thousands of years.

==Petrology==
[[Image:Talc block.jpg|thumb|right|A block of talc]]

[[Petrology|Petrologically]], soapstone is composed dominantly of talc, with varying amounts of [[chlorite group|chlorite]] and [[amphibole]]s (typically [[tremolite]], [[anthophyllite]], and [[cummingtonite]], hence its obsolete name, magnesiocummingtonite), and trace to minor iron-chromium [[oxide]]s.  It may be [[schist]]ose or [[Crystal habit|massive]].  Soapstone is formed by the metamorphism of [[Ultramafic rock|ultramafic]] [[protolith]]s (e.g. [[dunite]] or [[serpentinite]]) and the [[metasomatism]] of siliceous [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]]s.

By mass, &quot;pure&quot; steatite is roughly 63.37% [[silica]], 31.88% [[Magnesium oxide|magnesia]], and 4.74% water.&lt;ref name=Handbook&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Anthony, John W. |editor2=Bideaux, Richard A. |editor3=Bladh, Kenneth W. |editor4=Nichols, Monte C. |title= Handbook of Mineralogy|publisher= Mineralogical Society of America |place=Chantilly, VA |chapter-url=http://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/doclib/hom/talc.pdf|chapter=Talc|isbn=0962209716 |volume=II (Silica, Silicates)|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; It commonly contains minor quantities of other oxides such as CaO or Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Pyrophyllite]], a mineral very similar to talc, is sometimes called soapstone in the generic sense, since its physical characteristics and industrial uses are similar,&lt;ref name=&quot;Virta&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Virta |first1=Robert L. |title=Minerals Yearbook Metals and Minerals 2010 |publisher=Government Printing Office |page=75.1 |isbn=9788290273908 |url=http://bora.uib.no/handle/1956/16580 |access-date=26 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because it is also commonly used as a carving material. However, this mineral typically does not have such a soapy feel as soapstone.

==Physical characteristics==

Soapstone is relatively soft because of its high talc content, talc having a definitional value of 1 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness scale]]. Softer grades may feel similar to [[soap]] when touched, hence the name. No fixed hardness is given for soapstone because the amount of talc it contains varies widely, from as little as 30% for architectural grades such as those used on countertops, to as much as 80% for carving grades. 

Soapstone is easy to carve, it is also durable, heat-resistant and has a high heat storage capacity. It has therefore been used for cooking and heating equipment for thousands of years.&lt;ref name=hansen&gt;{{cite book| last1=Hansen|first1=Gitte|last2=Storemyr|first2=Per|title=A Versatile Resource – The Procurement and Use of Soapstone in Norway and The North Atlantic Region. In: Soapstone in the North Quarries, Products and People 7000 BC – AD 1700. UBAS – University of Bergen Archaeological Series 9. |year=2017 |place=Bergen, Norway |url=http://bora.uib.no/handle/1956/16580 |isbn=978-82-90273-90-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soapstone is often used as an [[Electrical insulation|insulator]] for housing and electrical components, due to its durability and electrical characteristics and because it can be pressed into complex shapes before firing. Soapstone undergoes transformations when heated to temperatures of {{convert|1000|–|1200|°C|°F}} into [[enstatite]] and [[cristobalite]]; on the Mohs scale, this corresponds to an increase in hardness to 5.5–6.5.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Some Important Aspects of the Harappan Technological Tradition,&quot; Bhan KK, Vidale M and Kenoyer JM, in ''Indian Archaeology in Retrospect''/edited by S. Settar and Ravi Korisettar, Manohar Press, New Delhi, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Historical uses (Only in Europe before beginning of the 14th Century) ===
[[File:Idi-ilum Louvre AO 19486 n01.jpg|thumb|upright|The 21st-century BC [[statue of Iddi-Ilum]] of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] is made of soapstone.]]

The [[Qulliq]], a type of oil lamp made by the arctic peoples, are also known as soapstone lamps. This kind of lamp was the single most important article of furniture for the Inuit peoples in their dwellings.

Ancient Egyptian [[Scarab (artifact)|Scarab]] signet/amulets were most commonly made from glazed steatite.&lt;ref name=aldred&gt;{{cite book |last=Aldred |first=Cyril |date=1971 |title=Jewels of the Pharaohs Egyptian Jewellery of the Dynastic Period |publisher=Thames and Hudson |pages=160–161 |isbn=0500231389}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Soapstone is used for inlaid designs, sculpture, [[beermat|coasters]], and kitchen [[countertop]]s and sinks.  The [[Inuit]] often used soapstone for traditional carvings. Some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes and bands make bowls, cooking slabs, and other objects from soapstone; historically, this was particularly common during the Late [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic archaeological period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Kenneth E. Sassaman| title = Early Pottery in the Southeast: Tradition and Innovation in Cooking Technology| date = 1993-03-30| publisher = University Alabama Press| isbn = 978-0-8173-0670-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Locally quarried soapstone was used for gravemarkers in 19th century northeast [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], US, around [[Dahlonega, Georgia|Dahlonega]], and [[Cleveland, Georgia|Cleveland]], as simple field stone and &quot;slot and tab&quot; tombs.

Small blocks of soapstone (8&quot; x 10&quot; x 1&quot;) were heated on the cookstove or near the fire and used to warm cold bedclothes or to keep hands and feet cozy while sleighing.

Soapstone is relatively abundant in northern Europe. Vikings hewed soapstone directly from the stone face, shaped it into cooking pots, and sold these at home and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Else Rosendahl, ''The Vikings'', The Penguin Press, 1987, page 105&lt;/ref&gt; In Shetland, there is evidence these vessels were used for processing marine and dairy fats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.shetlandamenity.org/assets/files/Viking%20Unst/Belmont%20Steatite%20Vessel%20Residues%20Report.pdf|title=Report on the analysis of residues from steatite and ceramic vessels from the site of Belmont, Shetland|last=Steele|first=Val|website=Shetland Amenity}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several medieval buildings have survived here which are constructed with soapstone, amongst them [[Nidaros Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=hansen /&gt; 

Soapstone is sometimes used for construction of fireplace surrounds, cladding on [[wood-burning stoves]],&lt;ref name=sfnm&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.santafenewmexican.com/life/home/there-s-a-stove-for-every-taste/article_6ad9bf86-cbbb-5d31-88f0-34c1a6c1238b.html |title=There's a stove for every taste |date=2017-11-05 |access-date=2017-12-14 |work=[[The Santa Fe New Mexican]] |author= Weideman, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wapo&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/the-enduring-appeal-of-wood-stoves/2017/01/17/b08c2698-d690-11e6-9f9f-5cdb4b7f8dd7_story.html |title=The enduring appeal of wood stoves |date=2017-01-19 |access-date=2017-12-14 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |author=Damrosch, Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as the preferred material for woodburning masonry heaters because it can absorb, store, and evenly radiate heat due to its high density and magnesite (MgCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) content.  It is also used for countertops and bathroom tiling because of the ease of working the material and its property as the &quot;quiet stone&quot;.  A weathered or aged appearance occurs naturally over time as the patina is enhanced.

The ancient trading city of [[Tepe Yahya]] in southeastern Iran was a center for the production and distribution of soapstone in the fifth to third millennia BC.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Tepe Yahya,&quot; ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 2004. Britannica Concise Encyclopedia. 3 January 2004, [http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9380473/Tepe-Yahya Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used in [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Crete]].  At the Palace of [[Knossos]], [[archaeological]] recovery has included a magnificent [[libation]] table made of steatite.&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan (2007) [http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10854/knossos.html#fieldnotes &quot;Knossos Fieldnotes&quot;], ''The Modern Antiquarian''&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Yoruba people]] of West Nigeria used soapstone for several statues, most notably at [[Esie]], where archaeologists have uncovered hundreds of male and female statues about half of life size. The Yoruba of [[Ife]] also produced a miniature soapstone obelisk with metal studs called &quot;the staff of [[Oranmiyan]]&quot;.
[[File:Redentor.jpg|thumb|The outer layers of the ''[[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]]'' sculpture in [[Rio de Janeiro]] are made of soapstone. ]]

===Uses since 14th Century Europeans and the uses by Non-European cultures===
Soapstone has been used in India for centuries as a medium for carving.  Mining to meet worldwide demand for soapstone is threatening the habitat of India's tigers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,982537,00.html |title=West's love of talc threatens India's tigers|access-date=2007-01-09| work=The Guardian| location=London| first=Antony| last=Barnett| date=2003-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazil, especially in [[Minas Gerais]], due to the abundance of soapstone mines in that Brazilian state, local artisans still craft objects from that material, including pots and pans, wine glasses, statues, jewel boxes, coasters, and vases. These handicrafts are commonly sold in street markets found in cities across the state. Some of the oldest towns, notably [[Congonhas]], [[Tiradentes, Minas Gerais|Tiradentes]], and [[Ouro Preto]], still have some of their streets paved with soapstone from colonial times.

Some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] use soapstone for [[Smoking pipe (tobacco)|smoking pipe]]s; numerous examples have been found among artifacts of different cultures and are still in use today.  Its low heat conduction allows for prolonged smoking without the pipe heating up uncomfortably.&lt;ref&gt;Witthoft, J.G., 1949, &quot;Stone Pipes of the Historic Cherokees&quot;, ''Southern Indian Studies'' 1(2):43–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pipes and decorative carvings of local animals were made out of soapstone by [[Australian Aboriginal]] artist [[Erlikilyika]]  (c.1865–c.1930) in [[Central Australia]].&lt;ref name=Megg&gt;{{cite document|url=http://www.territorystories.nt.gov.au/jspui/bitstream/10070/230199/1/Aputula_Heritage_Final_Report_Megg_Kelham.pdf|first=Megg|last=Kelham|title=A Museum in Finke: An Aputula Heritage Project|pages=1–97|date= November 2010|access-date=11 May 2019|others=See [http://hdl.handle.net/10070/230199 Territory Stories] for details of document}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some wood-burning stoves make use of soapstone to take advantage of its useful thermal and fire-resistant properties.&lt;ref name=sfnm/&gt;&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt;

Soapstone is also used to carve [[Seal (East Asia)|Chinese seals]].

Currently, soapstone is most commonly used for architectural applications, such as counter tops, floor tiles, showerbases, and interior surfacing.

The active North American soapstone mines include one south of Quebec City with products marketed by Canadian Soapstone, the Treasure and Regal mines in Beaverhead County, Montana mined by the Barretts Minerals Company,  and another in Central Virginia operated by the Alberene Soapstone Company. Architectural soapstone is mined in Canada,  Brazil, India, and Finland and imported into the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soapstone gives countertops, tiles a look that's both new and old|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/realestate/soapstone-gives-countertops-tiles-a-look-thats-both-new-and-old/2013/05/30/48f500c2-bc1d-11e2-89c9-3be8095fe767_story.html|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2014-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Welding|Welders]] and [[Fabrication (metal)|fabricators]] use soapstone as a marker due to its resistance to heat; it remains visible when heat is applied. It has also been used for many years by seamstresses, carpenters, and other craftsmen as a marking tool because its marks are visible and not permanent.

Soapstone can be used to create molds for [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]] objects from soft metals, such as [[pewter]] or [[silver]].  The soft stone is easily carved and is not degraded by heating.  The slick surface of soapstone allows the finished object to be easily removed.

Soapstones can be put in a freezer and later used in place of ice cubes to chill alcoholic beverages without diluting. Sometimes called whiskey stones, these were first introduced around 2007.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}  Most whiskey stones feature a semipolished finish, retaining the soft look of natural soapstone, while others are highly polished.

Steatite [[ceramic]]s are low-cost biaxial [[porcelain]]s of nominal composition (MgO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Royalty Minerals |url=http://www.royaltyminerals.in |website=royaltyminerals.in |access-date=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steatite is used primarily for its [[dielectric]] and thermal insulating properties in applications such as tile, substrates, washers, bushings, beads, and pigments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Superior Technical Ceramics |url=http://www.ceramics.net |access-date=26 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used for high-voltage insulators, which have to stand large mechanical loads, e.g. insulators of [[mast radiator]]s.

== Safety ==
People can be exposed to soapstone in the workplace by breathing it in, skin contact, or eye contact.

===United States===
The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]  has set the legal limit ([[permissible exposure limit]]) for soapstone exposure in the workplace as 20 million particles per cubic foot over an 8-hour workday. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] of 6&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; total exposure and 3&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 3000&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, soapstone is [[IDLH|immediately dangerous to life and health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards - Soapstone (containing less than 1% quartz)|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0558.html|website = www.cdc.gov|access-date = 2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''judge''' is a person who [[wiktionary:preside|presides]] over [[court]] proceedings, either alone or as a part of a [[Judicial panel|panel of judges]]. The powers, functions, method of appointment, discipline, and training of judges vary widely across different [[jurisdiction]]s. The judge is supposed to conduct the trial [[wiktionary:impartial|impartially]] and, typically, in an [[in open court|open court]]. The judge hears all the [[witness]]es and any other [[Evidence (law)|evidence]] presented by the barristers or solicitors of the case, assesses the credibility and [[arguments]] of the parties, and then issues a ruling on the matter at hand based on their interpretation of the law and their own personal judgment. In some jurisdictions, the judge's powers may be shared with a [[jury]]. In [[inquisitorial system]]s of [[criminal investigation]], a judge might also be an [[examining magistrate]]. The presiding judge ensures that all court proceedings are lawful and orderly.

==Functions==
The ultimate task of a judge is to settle a legal dispute in a final and public manner, and thus affirm the [[rule of law]]. Judges exercise significant governmental power. They can order police, military or judicial officials to execute searches, arrests, imprisonments, garnishments, distrainments, seizures, deportations and similar actions. However, judges also supervise that trial procedures are followed, in order to ensure consistency and impartiality and avoid arbitrariness. The powers of a judge are checked by higher courts such as appeals courts and supreme courts.

Before the trial, a pre-trial investigation collecting the facts has been conducted by police officials, such as [[police officer]]s and [[coroner]]s, [[prosecutor]]s or [[public procurator]]s. The court usually has three main legally trained court officials: the judge, the prosecutor and the defence attorney. The role of a judge varies between legal systems. In an [[adversarial system]] (common law), as in effect in the U.S. and England, the judge functions as an impartial referee, mainly ensuring correct procedure, while the prosecution and the defense present their case to a [[jury]], often selected from common citizens. The main factfinder is the jury, and the judge will then finalize sentencing. Nevertheless, in smaller cases judges can issue [[summary judgment]]s without proceeding to a jury trial. In an [[inquisitorial system]] (civil law), as in effect in continental Europe, there is no jury and the main factfinder is the judge, who will do the presiding, judging and sentencing on his own. As such, the judge is expected to apply the law directly, as in the French expression ''Le juge est la bouche de la loi'' (&quot;The judge is the mouth of the law&quot;). Furthermore, in some system even investigation may be conducted by the judge, functioning as an [[examining magistrate]].

Judges may work alone in smaller cases, but in criminal, family and other significant cases, they work in a panel. In some civil law systems, this panel may include [[lay judge]]s. Unlike professional judges, lay judges are not legally trained, but unlike jurors, lay judges are usually volunteers and may be politically appointed. Judges are often assisted by [[law clerk]]s, [[Referendary|referendaries]] and notaries in legal cases and by [[bailiff]]s or similar with security.

===Requirements and appointment===
There are both volunteer and professional judges. A volunteer judge, such as an English [[Magistrate (England and Wales)|magistrate]], is not required to have legal training and is unpaid. Whereas, a professional judge is required to be [[Legal education|legally educated]]; in the U.S., this generally requires a degree of [[Juris Doctor]]. Furthermore, significant professional experience is often required; for example, in the U.S., judges are often appointed from experienced [[Attorney at law|attorney]]s. Judges are often appointed by the [[head of state]]. In some U.S. jurisdictions, however, judges are elected in a political election.

Impartiality is often considered important for [[rule of law]]. Thus, in many jurisdictions judges may be appointed for life, so that they cannot be removed by the executive. However, in non-democratic systems, the appointment of judges may be highly politicized and they often receive instructions on how to judge, and may be removed if their conduct does not please the political leadership.

===Judge as an occupation=== 
Judges must be able to research and process extensive lengths of documents, witness testimonies, and other case material, understand complex cases and possess a thorough understanding of the law and legal procedure, which requires excellent skills in logical reasoning, analysis and decision-making.

A variety of traditions have become associated with the rank or occupation. [[Gavel]]s (a ceremonial hammer) are used by judges in many countries, to the point that the gavel has become a symbol of a judge. In many parts of the world, judges wear long [[robe]]s (often in black or red) and sit on an elevated platform during trials (known as the bench).

American judges frequently wear black robes. American judges have ceremonial [[gavel]]s, although American judges have court deputies or bailiffs and ''[[contempt of court]]'' power as their main devices to maintain decorum in the courtroom. However, in some of the [[Western United States]], like California, judges did not always wear robes and instead wore everyday clothing. Today, some members of [[state supreme court]]s, such as the [[Maryland Court of Appeals]] wear distinct dress. In Italy and [[Portugal]], both judges and lawyers wear particular black robes.

Danish physicist [[Henrik Svensmark]] has controversially argued that because [[solar variation]] modulates the cosmic ray flux on Earth, they would consequently affect the rate of cloud formation and hence be an indirect cause of [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Long | first = Marion | title = Sun's Shifts May Cause Global Warming | publisher = [[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] | date = 25 June 2007 | url = http://discovermagazine.com/2007/jul/the-discover-interview-henrik-svensmark/ | accessdate = 7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Henrik Svensmark| title = Influence of Cosmic Rays on Earth's Climate| journal = [[Physical Review Letters]]| year = 1998| volume = 81| pages = 5027–5030| doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.5027| issue = 22| bibcode=1998PhRvL..81.5027S| url = http://ruby.fgcu.edu/courses/twimberley/EnviroPol/EnviroPhilo/Svensmark.pdf| citeseerx = 10.1.1.522.585}}&lt;/ref&gt; Svensmark is one of several scientists outspokenly opposed to the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming, leading to concerns that the proposition that cosmic rays are connected to global warming could be ideologically biased rather than scientifically based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Plait|first1=Phil|title=No, a new study does not show cosmic-rays are connected to global warming|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/08/31/no-a-new-study-does-not-show-cosmic-rays-are-connected-to-global-warming/|accessdate=11 January 2018|work=Discover|publisher=Kalmbach Publishing|date=31 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scientists have vigorously criticized Svensmark for sloppy and inconsistent work: one example is adjustment of cloud data that understates error in lower cloud data, but not in high cloud data;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Benestad | first = Rasmus E. | title = 'Cosmoclimatology' – tired old arguments in new clothes | url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/03/cosmoclimatology-tired-old-arguments-in-new-clothes/ | accessdate = 13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; another example is &quot;incorrect handling of the physical data&quot; resulting in graphs that do not show the correlations they claim to show.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Laut, [http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Publications/PDF_Papers/Laut2003.pdf &quot;Solar activity and terrestrial climate: an analysis of some purported correlations&quot;], Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics 65 (2003) 801- 812&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Svensmark's assertions, galactic cosmic rays have shown no statistically significant influence on changes in cloud cover,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lockwood|first1=Mike|title=Solar Influence on Global and Regional Climates|journal=Surveys in Geophysics|date=16 May 2012|volume=33|issue=3–4|pages=503–534|doi=10.1007/s10712-012-9181-3|bibcode=2012SGeo...33..503L|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been demonstrated in studies to have no causal relationship to changes in global temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sloan|first1=T.|last2=Wolfendale|first2=A.W.|authorlink2=Arnold Wolfendale|title=Cosmic rays, solar activity and the climate|journal=Environmental Research Letters|date=7 November 2013|volume=8|issue=4|pages=045022|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/8/4/045022|bibcode=2013ERL.....8d5022S|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

In [[chess]], a '''fork''' is a [[Chess tactic|tactic]] whereby a single piece makes two or more direct [[attack (chess)|attacks]] simultaneously. Most commonly two pieces are threatened, which is also sometimes called a ''{{chessgloss|double attack}}''. The attacker usually aims to gain {{chessgloss|material}} by {{chessgloss|capturing}} one of the opponent's pieces. The defender often finds it difficult to counter two or more threats in a single move. The attacking piece is called the ''forking'' piece; the pieces attacked are said to be ''forked''. A piece that is defended can still be said to be forked if the forking piece has a lower [[chess piece relative value|value]].

Besides attacking pieces, a target of a fork can be a direct [[Checkmate|mating]] threat (for example, attacking an unprotected [[Knight (chess)|knight]] while simultaneously setting up a battery of [[Queen (chess)|queen]] and [[Bishop (chess)|bishop]] to threaten mate). Or a target can be an implied threat (for example, a knight may attack an unprotected piece while simultaneously threatening to fork queen and rook).

Forks are often used as part of a [[Combination (chess)|combination]] which may involve other types of chess tactics as well.
{{AN chess|pos=toc}}

==Forking piece==
The type of fork is named after the type of forking piece. For example, a ''knight fork'' is a knight move that attacks two or more enemy pieces simultaneously. Any type of piece can perform a fork—including the [[King (chess)|king]]—and any type of piece can be forked. A fork is most effective when it is {{chessgloss|forcing move|forcing}}, such as when the king is put in [[Check (chess)|check]].

The knight is the quintessential forking piece; in fact, some sources only use the term &quot;fork&quot; when a knight is the attacker, while if another piece is the attacker the tactic is called a ''{{chessgloss|double attack}}'' or similar. A knight fork is powerful in several ways. The piece's unique L-shaped move allows it to attack any other type of piece without being threatened back by its targets, in seven different directions (eight minus the space it moved from). Another advantage of the knight in forking is the ability to jump over any piece freely. 

The queen is also often used to fork, but since the queen is usually more valuable than the pieces it attacks, this typically gains material only when the pieces attacked are undefended or if one of them is the king and the other is undefended. The possibility of a queen fork is a very real threat when the queen is in the open, as is often the case in [[Chess endgame|endgames]]. If a player wants to force an [[Exchange (chess)|exchange]] of queens, forking the enemy queen and king (or an undefended piece) with a protected queen can be useful.

[[Pawn (chess)|Pawns]] other than rook pawns (those on the a- and h-{{chessgloss|files}}) can also be used to fork by attacking two enemy pieces diagonally—one to the left, the other to the right.

Forks made by the king are an important consideration in endgame, where the king's ability to attack multiple pieces at once affects where (for example) a pawn's defenders can be safely placed.

==Escaping forks==
Forks can possibly be escaped. A forked piece such as the queen might check the enemy king, giving time to move the second forked piece to safety on the next move.

==Other terms {{anchor|Royal Fork}}==
A fork of the king and queen, the highest material-gaining fork possible, is sometimes called a ''royal fork''. A fork of the enemy king, queen, and one (or both) rooks is sometimes called a ''grand fork''. A knight fork of the enemy king, queen, and possibly other pieces is sometimes called a ''family fork'' or ''family check''.

'''''Backyard Blitz''''' was a [[Logie Award]] winning Australian [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] and [[Do it yourself|DIY]] [[television program]] that aired on the [[Nine Network]] between 2000 through to 2007 before its cancellation. It was hosted by [[Jamie Durie]] and was created by [[Don Burke]] and produced by his CTC Productions team.

The show featured a very similar premise to the show ''[[Ground Force]]'', in which a team of gardeners employed by the show descend on a supposedly worthy individual's place and improve the garden for the cameras within a specified time limit. This similarity in fact led to legal action being taken by the rival [[Seven Network]] who at the time was set to debut an Australian version of ''Ground Force''.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUScopy&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/ground-force-may-sue-australian-copy-721608.html | title=''Ground Force'' may sue Australian 'copy' | last=Robins | first=Jane | date=27 April 2000 | newspaper=[[The Independent]] | accessdate=2009-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven lost its claim as Don Burke's CTC was able to show that Burke's Backyard in fact had featured backyard garden renovations which they claimed naturally morphed into Backyard Blitz.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/rights-and-wrongs-20020418-gdf7fm.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The show like many other lifestyle series was immensely popular across all demographics and for seven years. It consistently won its time-slot and consistently was in the top 20 national shows at year's end  &lt;ref&gt;https://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/fact-finders/television/industry-trends/in-the-archive/top-programs/top-20-programs-1998-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 November 2006 ''Backyard Blitz'' was axed by the Nine Network after seven years on air. Don Burke, whose own show ''[[Burke's Backyard]]'' was broadcast by Nine for nearly 18 years before it was axed in 2004, said his production company was &quot;quite shocked by this decision&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20753608-2702,00.html |title=''The Australian'' |access-date=14 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015074908/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20753608-2702,00.html |archive-date=15 October 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-2007 Nine aired the six remaining unaired episodes that were filmed before the show was cancelled. In 2008, it aired a spin-off show [[Domestic Blitz]] hosted by [[Shelley Craft]] and [[Scott Cam]]

==Presenters==
The four regular presenters on the show were landscaper [[Jamie Durie]] (the main host and the shows lead landscaper), [[Scott Cam]] (builder/carpenter), Nigel Ruck (landscaper) and [[Jody Rigby]] (horticulturist).

==Awards==
During the shows run, it has won (and been nominated) for several [[Logie Awards]]. The show won six consecutive 'Most Popular Lifestyle Program' awards (2002–2006). It was nominated in the same category in 2007 but lost. Jamie Durie won the 'Most Popular New Male Talent' in 2001 and was nominated for 'Most Popular TV Presenter' in 2005 and 2006 for his role on the show.

Following the end of ''The Outdoor Room'' on the Seven Network in 2010, Durie relocated the concept of the series to broadcast on the American [[HGTV]] network as ''The Outdoor Room with Jamie Durie''. Unable to bring his own Australian design team along, Durie put together a new team of top-notch designers, horticulturists and contractors.&lt;ref name=&quot;hgtv.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hgtv.com/shows/the-outdoor-room-with-jamie-durie|title=The Outdoor Room With Jamie Durie}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his HGTV series, Durie rescues forlorn yards in [[Southern California]] with design schemes inspired by gardens and landscapes from around the world.

==Early life==
Durie was born in Manly, northern [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], and spent his formative years living in the mining town [[Tom Price, Western Australia|Tom Price]] in the [[Pilbara]] region of [[Western Australia]], with his mother and maternal grandmother both [[Sri Lanka]]n. His grandmother, Daphne De Silva, was born in Sri Lanka and met his English grandfather in the air force during the war. They moved to Australia in the 1950s. Durie recalls that he and his grandmother baked and gardened together. She taught him how to make his first curry. He has inherited a love of the Sri Lankan culture and lifestyle.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs.org&quot;/&gt; His parents separated when Durie was age 10, and he relocated with his mother and brother Chris, to the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], in [[Queensland]]. His paternal grandmother, called Nanna, was a volunteer surf-lifesaver on the NSW Central Coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/jamie-durie-i-owe-a-lot-to-women-for-my-career-20180822-p4zz3d.html|title=Jamie Durie: I owe a lot to women for my career|first=Jane|last=Rocca|date=25 August 2018|website=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having left high-school in Brisbane at age 15, he tried his hand at cabinetmaking, and modeled beachwear part-time. Durie got his showbiz start in his teens as an exotic dancer in the Australian all-male revue troupe called ''Manpower Australia''. Durie's agent introduced him to ''Manpower Australia'' - a touring [[dance troupe]] best known for its male dance performances and for its dancers' distinctive [[physical attractiveness]] and [[sex appeal]] - and as he describes it... &quot;and the rest is history&quot;. For seven years, Durie toured internationally with ''Manpower Australia'', acting as manager, and also as principal dancer, performing acrobatics and trapeze acts to large audience venues in [[Las Vegas, NV]]. &quot;I was the lead performer and designed the sets and costumes&quot; he says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elledecor.com/celebrity-style/interviews/a3731/shortlist-jamie-durie-a-73175/|title=Shortlist: Jamie Durie|date=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durie notes that while ''Manpower Australia'' was perceived as putting the risqué into risky, the shows were highly professional acts that even his grandmother was comfortable with. The timing was ideal, as &quot;The 1960s, 1970s and 1980s in Australia were very chauvinistic and the female body was overexploited&quot;, as he explains, &quot;There needed to be social change.&quot; Retiring from ''Manpower Australia'' at age 26, Durie made up for his early exit from schooling by completing a four-year horticultural and landscape design course.&lt;ref name=&quot;theaustralian.com.au1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/companies/a-rare-species/news-story/e4376d43cf828bcad6c23190e00a2849 |title=Nocookies |newspaper=The Australian |accessdate=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Landscape design and television hosting==
Durie founded the landscape design company ''Patio Landscape Architecture and Design'' in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;theaustralian.com.au1&quot;/&gt; In 2002, Durie registered the Australian business company, ''JPD Media &amp; Design''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abr.business.gov.au/ABN/View/830988947|title=ABN Lookup|date=1 November 2014|website=www.abr.business.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

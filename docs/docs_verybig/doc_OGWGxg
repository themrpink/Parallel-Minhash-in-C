Possible indications of an incipient wheel war:
* An administrator getting too distressed to discuss calmly.
* Deliberately ignoring an existing discussion in favor of a unilateral preferred action.
* Abruptly undoing administrator actions without consultation.
* Reversal of a Wikimedia Foundation [[Wikipedia:Office actions|office action]].

Wikipedia works on the spirit of [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]]; disputes should be settled through civil discussion rather than power struggles. There are few issues so critical that fighting is better than discussion, or worth losing your own good standing for. If you feel the ''urge'' to wheel war, try these alternatives:
* Seek constructive discussion, and aim to cool the situation and bring it back to normal processes, if able. Adopting a deliberately calming manner and approach as you explain may help. In some cases [[WP:EMAIL|email]] may allow heartfelt personal advice to be given that could not easily be posted on-wiki.
* If concerned by improper conduct, follow [[Wikipedia:Resolving disputes|dispute resolution]] processes, as with any other conduct matter. For example: move the issue to [[WP:AN]] or [[WP:ANI]] and wait for input. For '''serious and egregious misuse of tools''' consider [[WP:RFAR|RFAR]]. 
* If you are concerned that not acting (or the delay needed for dialog) could quickly cause the situation to get much worse or would be grossly inappropriate, it can sometimes be sensible to [[WP:AC|email the Arbitration Committee]] and let them know about the situation or request intervention or speedy advice. (This might be the case where non-public information or harm could result).
* And remember you have hundreds of colleagues: you are not alone and most issues are made worse by poor judgment. If you are seen to conduct yourself well, usually the matter will blow over soon, however bad it may seem. Sometimes it's best simply to [[Wikipedia:A nice cup of tea and a sit down|take a break and calm down]].

The term &quot;wheel&quot; comes from the description of highest privileged accounts on the [[PDP-10]] and [[TOPS-20]] mainframe computers, where &quot;wheel&quot; was used the way &quot;root&quot; is used on Linux/Unix systems.

=== Exceptional circumstances ===

There are a few exceptional circumstances to this general principle. (Note: these are one-way exceptions.)
* '''[[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons|Biographies of living persons]]''' – Material deleted because it contravenes BLP may be re-deleted if reinstated, if it continues to be non-BLP-compliant.
* '''Privacy''' – Personal information deleted under the Foundation's privacy policy may be re-deleted if reinstated.
* '''Emergency''' – In certain situations there may arise an emergency that cannot be adjourned for discussion. An administrator should not claim emergency unless there is a ''reasonable belief of a present and very serious emergency'' (i.e., reasonable possibility of actual, imminent, serious harm to the project or a person if not acted upon with administrative tools), and should immediately seek to describe and address the matter, but in such a case the action should not usually be reverted (and may be reinstated) until appropriate discussion has taken place.
* '''Page protection in edit warring''' – Reasonable actions undertaken by uninvolved administrators to quell a visible and heated edit war by protecting a contended page should be respected by '''all''' users, and protection may be reinstated if needed, until it is clear the edit war will not resume or consensus agrees it is appropriate to unprotect.

== Review and removal of adminship ==
{{anchor|Removal of adminship (desysopping)}}

If an administrator abuses administrative rights, these rights may be removed by a ruling of the [[Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee|Arbitration Committee]]. At their discretion, lesser penalties may also be assessed against problematic administrators, including the restriction of their use of certain functions or placement on administrative probation. The technical ability to remove the administrator user right from an account is granted to the [[Wikipedia:Bureaucrats|bureaucrat]], [[meta:Stewards|steward]], and [[WP:Founder|founder]]&lt;ref&gt;This user right is only held by [[User:Jimbo Wales]], who has not performed a technical desysopping since 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; user groups (see [[Special:ListGroupRights]]). In emergency situations where local users are unable or unavailable to act, stewards are permitted by the [[Wikipedia:Global rights policy#Stewards|global rights policy]] to protect the best interests of Wikipedia by removing administrative permissions or [[Meta:Global locks|globally locking]] accounts and advising the Arbitration Committee after the fact.

There have been several procedures suggested for a community-based desysop process, but none of them has achieved [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]]. Some administrators will voluntarily stand for reconfirmation under certain circumstances; see [[#Administrator recall]]. Users may use [[WP:DR|dispute resolution]] to request comment on an administrator's suitability.

{{tracked|T6055}}{{green|'''Technical note'''}} – Removal of rights performed by stewards does &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; show up in the usual user logs. Use {{tlx|Userrights|''username''}} for full links to user rights information and full logs, including the stewards' global logs on [[meta:|meta]] as well, or '''[[Special:ListUsers]]''' to verify a user's current rights.

=== Procedural removal for inactive administrators ===
{{see|Wikipedia:Inactive administrators}}
{{policy shortcut|WP:INACTIVITY}}

Administrators who have made neither edits nor administrative actions for at least 12 months may be desysopped.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)/suspend sysop rights of inactive admins]], June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This desysopping is reversible in some cases (see [[#Restoration of adminship]]) and never considered a reflection on the user's use of, or rights to, the admin tools. The admin must be contacted on their user talk page and via email (if possible) one month before the request for desysopping and again several days before the desysopping goes into effect. Desysopping on inactivity grounds should be handled by English Wikipedia [[Wikipedia:Bureaucrats|bureaucrats]]. The summary in the user rights log should make it clear that the desysopping is purely procedural.

If necessary, the user's userpage should be edited to clarify the status&amp;nbsp;— particularly if any categorization is involved. For example, the userbox &lt;tt&gt;{{tl|User wikipedia/Administrator}}&lt;/tt&gt; should be replaced with &lt;tt&gt;{{tlx|1=User wikipedia/Former administrator|2=inactive=yes}}&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== Voluntary removal ===
Administrators may request that their access to administrative tools be removed at [[Wikipedia:Bureaucrats' noticeboard]].

=== Disputes or complaints ===
{{see|Wikipedia:Dispute resolution}}

In most cases, disputes with administrators should be resolved with the normal dispute resolution process. If the dispute reflects seriously on a user's administrative capacity (blatant misuse of administrative tools, gross or persistent misjudgment or conduct issues), or dialog fails, then the following steps are available:

==== Administrator recall ====
{{main article|Wikipedia:Administrators open to recall}}

Some administrators place themselves &quot;open to recall&quot;, whereby they pledge to [[#Voluntary removal|voluntarily step down]] if specified criteria are met. The specific criteria are set by each administrator for themselves, and usually detailed in their userspace. The process is entirely voluntary and administrators may change their criteria at any time, or decline to adhere to previously made recall pledges.

==== Arbitration Committee review ====
This is an involuntary process. Generally, the Arbitration Committee requires that other steps of dispute resolution are tried before it intervenes in a dispute, such as raising the issue at [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents]]. However, if the matter is serious enough, the Arbitration Committee may intervene early on. Remedies that may be imposed, at the discretion of the Committee, include warnings, admonishments, restrictions, and removal of administrator privileges.

== Restoration of adminship ==
{{anchor|Resysop}}
Regardless of how adminship is removed, any editor is free to re-request adminship through the typical [[WP:RFA|requests for adminship]] process.&lt;ref&gt;Excepting those with a specific arbitration or community sanction barring the request.&lt;/ref&gt;

Former administrators may re-request adminship subsequent to voluntary removal or removal due to inactivity. Adminship is granted unless one of these situations applies:

* '''Adminship was resigned while &quot;under a cloud.&quot;''' If there were serious questions about the appropriateness of the former admin's status as an administrator at the time of resignation, the request will be referred to [[WP:RFA]]. In doubtful cases, re-granting will be deferred until a broader community discussion takes place and is closed.
* {{anchor|Lengthy inactivity}}'''Lengthy inactivity'''
**'''Over two years with no edits.''' If an editor has had at least two years of uninterrupted inactivity (no edits) between the removal of the admin tools and the re-request, regardless of the reason for removal, the editor will need to instead request through the [[WP:RFA]] process. In the case of an administrator desysopped due to a year of inactivity, only one year of continued uninterrupted inactivity (no edits) from the removal due to inactivity is required before a new [[WP:RFA]] is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Revised [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/2019_Resysop_Criteria_(2)#Statement_7_by_Amorymeltzer|November 2019]]; originally formulated in [[Wikipedia_talk:Administrators/Archive_13#Restoration_of_the_tools_(proposal)|November 2012]]&lt;/ref&gt;
** '''Over five years since administrative tools were last used.''' In the case of removal due to inactivity, for any administrator who does not have a logged administrator action in five years, bureaucrats should not restore administrator access upon request.&lt;ref&gt;[[Special:Permalink/828580847#RFC: Slight tweak to lengthy inactivity policy|RFC: Slight tweak to lengthy inactivity policy]] March 2018 &lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Security of account cannot be established.''' At their discretion, [[WP:BUREAUCRAT|bureaucrats]] may decline to restore adminship if they are not satisfied that the account is controlled by the same person who used it previously.

=== Procedure ===

Former administrators may request restoration of administrator status by placing a request at [[Wikipedia:Bureaucrats' noticeboard]]. There is a standard 24-hour review period before the request may be actioned by a bureaucrat according to  [[WP:RESYSOP|resysop procedures]]. The change is recorded at the [[WP:RESYSOPS|list of resysopped users]].

Before restoring the administrator flag, a bureaucrat should be reasonably convinced that the user has returned to activity or intends to return to activity as an editor. Should there be doubt concerning the suitability for restoration of the administrator permission, the restoration shall be delayed until sufficient discussion has occurred and a consensus established through a discussion among bureaucrats.

== History ==
In the very early days of [[Wikipedia]], only [[Bomis]] employees were administrators, as the server password was required to make any administrative changes.&lt;ref&gt;[[:nostalgia:Wikipedia_utilities/Old_Page_titles_to_be_deleted_talk]]&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of an administrator role was proposed in late 2001 during the development of the first version of [[MediaWiki]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:nostalgia:Wiki Administrators]]&lt;/ref&gt; Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] directly appointed the first administrators in February 2002. 

Under the [[role-based access control]] currently used, individual accounts are marked with the special roles they may play; these roles in turn determine any special tools they may access. Administrators were not intended to develop into a special subgroup. Rather, administrators should be a part of the community like other editors. Anyone can perform most [[WP:Maintenance|maintenance]] and [[WP:Administration|administration]] tasks on Wikipedia without the specific technical functions granted to administrators. An often paraphrased comment about the title and process of adminship was made by Wales in February 2003—referred to as &quot;sysops&quot; here:

{{anchor|No big deal}}{{policy shortcut|WP:DEAL|WP:NOBIGDEAL}}
{{quote|I just wanted to say that becoming a sysop is *not a big deal*.
I think perhaps I'll go through semi-willy-nilly and make a bunch of people who have been around for awhile sysops. I want to dispel the aura of &quot;authority&quot; around the position. It's merely a technical matter that the powers given to sysops are not given out to everyone.
I don't like that there's the apparent feeling here that being granted sysop status is a really special thing.|Jimmy Wales|2003&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2003-February/001149.html wikimedia.org archive entry]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stated simply, while the correct use of the tools and appropriate conduct should be considered important, merely &quot;being an administrator&quot; should not be.

As Wikipedia's worldwide cultural impact and visibility grew, and as the community grew with it, the role of administrators evolved and standards for adminship rose. Given the lengthy procedures required to remove administrative access, which often include attempts to resolve the dispute prior to [[WP:ARB|arbitration]], the community carefully scrutinizes [[WP:RfA|requests for adminship]].

'''''Das Rheingold''''' ({{Pronunciation|De-Das Rheingold.ogg|pronunciation}}; '''''The Rhinegold'''''), [[Wagner-Werk-Verzeichnis|WWV]] 86A, is the first of the four [[music drama]]s that constitute [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]],'' (English: ''The Ring of the Nibelung''). It was performed, as a single opera,  at the [[National Theatre Munich]] on 22 September 1869, and received its first performance as part of the ''Ring'' cycle at the [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus]], on 13 August 1876.

Wagner wrote the ''Ring'' librettos in reverse order, so that ''Das Rheingold'' was the last of the texts to be written; it was, however, the first to be set to music. The score was completed in 1854, but Wagner was unwilling to sanction its performance until the whole cycle was complete; he worked intermittently on this music until 1874. The 1869 Munich premiere of ''Das Rheingold'' was staged, much against Wagner's wishes, on the orders of his patron, King [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]]. Following its 1876 Bayreuth premiere, the ''Ring'' cycle was introduced into the worldwide repertory, with performances in all the main opera houses, in which it has remained a regular and popular fixture.

In his 1851 essay ''[[Opera and Drama]]'', Wagner had set out new principles as to how music dramas should be constructed, under which the conventional forms of opera (arias, ensembles, choruses) were rejected. Rather than  providing word-settings, the music would interpret the text emotionally, reflecting the feelings and moods behind the work, by  using a system of recurring [[leitmotif]]s to represent people, ideas and situations. ''Das Rheingold'' was Wagner's first work that adopted these principles, and his most rigid adherence to them, despite a few deviations – the [[Rhinemaidens]] frequently sing in ensemble.

As the &quot;preliminary evening&quot; within the cycle, ''Das Rheingold'' gives the background to the events that drive the main dramas of the cycle. It recounts [[Alberich]]'s theft of the Rhine gold after his renunciation of love; his fashioning of the all-powerful ring from the gold and his enslavement of the [[Nibelung]]s; [[Odin|Wotan]]'s seizure of the gold and the ring, to pay his debt to the giants who have built his fortress [[Valhalla]]; Alberich's curse on the ring and its possessors; [[Jörð|Erda]]'s warning to Wotan to forsake the ring; the early manifestation of the curse's power after Wotan yields the ring to the giants; and the gods' uneasy entry into Valhalla, under the shadow of their impending doom.

Having completed his opera ''[[Lohengrin]]'' in April 1848, [[Richard Wagner]] chose as his next subject [[Sigurd|Siegfried]], the legendary hero of [[Germanic mythology|Germanic myth]].{{sfn|Gutman|1971|p=175}} In October of that year he prepared a prose outline for ''Siegfried's Death'', which during the following months he developed into a full libretto.{{sfn|Holman|2001|p=33}} After his flight from [[Dresden]] and relocation in Switzerland, he continued to develop and expand his Siegfried project, having decided meantime that a single work would not suffice for his purposes; in his enlarged concept, ''Siegfried's Death'' would be the culmination of a series of musical dramas incorporating a network of myths from his sources and imagination, each telling a stage of the story. In 1851 he outlined his purpose in his essay &quot;A Communication to My Friends&quot;: &quot;I propose to produce my myth in three complete dramas, preceded by a lengthy Prelude (Vorspiel)&quot;.{{sfn|Wagner, tr. Ellis 1895|p=63}} Each of these dramas would, he said, constitute an independent whole, but would not be performed separately. &quot;At a specially-appointed Festival, I propose, some future time, to produce those three Dramas with their Prelude, in the course of three days and a fore-evening&quot;.{{sfn|Wagner, tr. Ellis 1895|p=63}}

In accordance with this  scheme ''Siegfried's Death'', much revised from its original form, eventually became ''[[Götterdämmerung]]'' (''The Twilight of the Gods''). It was preceded by the story of Siegfried's youth, ''Young Siegfried'', later renamed ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]'', itself preceded by ''[[Die Walküre]]'' (''The Valkyrie''). Finally, to these three works Wagner added a prologue  which he named ''Das Rheingold''.{{sfn|Jacobs|1980|p=63}}

==Synopsis==
===Scene 1===
At the bottom of the Rhine, the three [[Rhinemaidens]], Woglinde, Wellgunde, and Floßhilde, play together.   [[Alberich]],  a [[Nibelung]] [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]], appears from a deep chasm and tries to woo them. The maidens mock his advances and he grows angry – he chases them, but they elude, tease and humiliate him. A sudden ray of sunshine pierces the depths, to reveal the Rhinegold. The maidens rejoice in the gold's gleam. Alberich asks what it is. They explain that the gold, which their father has ordered them to guard, can be made into a magic ring which gives power to rule the world, if its bearer first renounces love. The maidens think they have nothing to fear from the lustful dwarf, but Alberich, embittered by their mockery, curses love, seizes the gold and returns to his chasm, leaving them screaming in dismay.

===Scene 2===
[[File:Walhalla (1896) by Max Brückner.jpg|thumb|left|Wotan's fortress of Valhalla]]

[[Odin| Wotan]], ruler of the gods, is asleep on a mountaintop, with a magnificent castle behind him. His wife, [[Frigg| Fricka]], wakes Wotan, who salutes their new home. Fricka reminds him of his promise to the giants Fasolt and [[Fafnir|Fafner]], who  built the castle, that he would give them Fricka's sister [[Freya|Freia]], the goddess of youth and beauty, as payment. Fricka is worried for her sister, but Wotan trusts that [[Loki|Loge]], the demigod of fire, will find an alternative payment.

Freia enters in a panic, followed by Fasolt and Fafner. Fasolt demands that Freia be given up. He points out that Wotan's authority is sustained by the treaties carved into his spear, including his contract with the giants, which Wotan therefore cannot violate. [[Thor| Donner]], god of thunder, and [[Freyr |Froh]], god of sunshine, arrive to defend Freia, but Wotan cannot permit the use of force to break the agreement. Hoping that Loge will arrive with the alternative payment he has promised, Wotan tries to stall.

When Loge arrives, his initial report is discouraging: nothing is more valuable to men than love, so there is apparently no possible alternative payment besides Freia.  Loge was able to find only one instance where someone willingly gave up love for something else: Alberich the Nibelung has renounced love, stolen the Rhine gold and made a powerful magic ring out of it. A  discussion of the ring and its powers ensues, and everyone finds good reasons for wanting to own it. Fafner makes a counter-offer: the giants will accept the Nibelung's treasure in payment, instead of Freia. When Wotan tries to haggle, the giants depart, taking Freia with them as hostage and threatening to keep her forever unless the gods ransom her by obtaining, and giving them the Nibelung's gold by the end of the day.

Freia's [[golden apple]]s had kept the gods eternally young, but in her absence they begin to age and weaken. In order to redeem Freia, Wotan resolves to travel with Loge to Alberich's subterranean kingdom to obtain the gold.
[[File:Ring11.jpg|thumb|upright| Alberich and the subjugated [[Nibelung]] [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarfs]] – illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]]]]

===Scene 3===
In Nibelheim, Alberich has enslaved the rest of the Nibelung dwarves with the power of the ring. He has forced his brother Mime, a skillful smith, to create a magic helmet, the [[Tarnhelm]]. Alberich demonstrates the Tarnhelm's power by making himself invisible, the better to torment his subjects.

Wotan and Loge arrive and happen upon Mime, who tells them of the dwarves' misery under Alberich's rule. Alberich returns, driving his slaves to pile up a huge mound of gold.   He boasts to the visitors about his plans to  conquer the world using the power of the ring. Loge asks how he can protect himself against a thief while he sleeps. Alberich replies the Tarnhelm will hide him, by allowing him to turn invisible or change his form. Loge expresses doubt and requests a demonstration. Alberich complies by transforming himself into a giant snake; Loge acts suitably impressed, and then asks whether Alberich can also reduce his size, which would be very useful for hiding. Alberich transforms himself into a toad. Wotan and Loge seize him, tie his hands, and drag him up to the surface.

===Scene 4===
Back on the mountaintop, Wotan and Loge force Alberich to exchange his wealth for his freedom.  He summons the Nibelungen, who bring up the hoard of gold. He then asks for the return of the Tarnhelm, but Loge says that it is part of his ransom. Alberich still hopes he can keep the ring, but Wotan demands it, and when Alberich refuses, Wotan tears it from Alberich's hand and puts it on his own finger. Crushed by his loss, Alberich lays a curse on the ring: until it should return to him,  whoever possesses it will live in anxiety and will eventually be robbed of it and killed.

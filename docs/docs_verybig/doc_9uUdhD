In corporations that derive much of their profits from the [[information economy]], such as banks, publishing houses, telecommunications companies and defence contractors, IT costs are a significant source of uncontrollable spending, which in size is often the greatest corporate cost after total compensation costs and property related costs. A function of management accounting in such organizations is to work closely with the IT department to provide [[IT cost transparency]].&lt;ref&gt;* &quot;Taking Control of IT Costs&quot;. Nokes, Sebastian. London (Financial Times / Prentice Hall): March 20, 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-273-64943-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the above, one view of the progression of the accounting and finance career path is that financial accounting is a stepping stone to management accounting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cima P1 Exam Questions|url=http://www.cimapastpapers.com/how-to-pass-cima-p1-exam|accessdate=14 Nov 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114235651/http://www.cimapastpapers.com/how-to-pass-cima-p1-exam|archivedate=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with the notion of value creation, management accountants help drive the success of the business while strict financial accounting is more of a compliance and historical endeavor.

==Specific methodologies==

===Activity-based costing (ABC)===
Activity-based costing was first clearly defined in 1987 by Robert S. Kaplan and W. Bruns as a chapter in their book Accounting and Management: A Field Study Perspective. They initially focused on the manufacturing industry, where increasing technology and productivity improvements have reduced the relative proportion of the direct costs of labor and materials, but have increased relative proportion of indirect costs. For example, increased automation has reduced labor, which is a direct cost, but has increased depreciation, which is an indirect cost.

===Grenzplankostenrechnung===
{{Undue weight section|date=August 2018}}
{{main|Grenzplankostenrechnung}}
Grenzplankostenrechnung (GPK) is a German costing methodology, developed in the late 1940s and 1960s, designed to provide a consistent and accurate application of how managerial costs are calculated and assigned to a product or service. The term Grenzplankostenrechnung, often referred to as GPK, has best been translated as either ''marginal planned cost accounting''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedl|first=Gunther|author2=Hans-Ulrich Kupper |author3= Burkhard Pedell|title=Relevance Added: Combining ABC with German Cost Accounting|journal=Strategic Finance|issue=June|pages=56–61|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''flexible analytic cost planning and accounting''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sharman|first=Paul A.|title=Bring On German Cost Accounting|journal=Strategic Finance|issue=December|pages=2–9|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of GPK are credited to Hans Georg Plaut, an automotive engineer, and Wolfgang Kilger, an academic, working towards the mutual goal of identifying and delivering a sustained methodology designed to correct and enhance cost accounting information. GPK is published in cost accounting textbooks, notably ''Flexible Plankostenrechnung und Deckungsbeitragsrechnung''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kilger|first=Wolfgang|others=Updated by Kurt Vikas and Jochen Pampel|title=Flexible Plankostenrechnung and Deckungsbeitragsrechnung|edition=12th|publisher=Gabler GmbH|location=Wiesbaden, Germany|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and taught at German-speaking universities.

===Lean accounting (accounting for lean enterprise)===
{{main|Lean accounting}}
In the mid- to late-1990s several books were written about accounting in the lean enterprise (companies implementing elements of the [[Toyota Production System]]). The term ''lean accounting'' was coined during that period. These books contest that traditional accounting methods are better suited for mass production and do not support or measure good business practices in just-in-time manufacturing and services. The movement reached a tipping point during the 2005 Lean Accounting Summit in [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]], [[Michigan]], United States. 320 individuals attended and discussed the advantages of a new approach to accounting in the lean enterprise. 520 individuals attended the 2nd annual conference in 2006 and it has varied between 250 and 600 attendees since that time.

===Resource consumption accounting (RCA)===
{{main|Resource Consumption Accounting}}
Resource consumption accounting (RCA) is formally defined as a dynamic, fully integrated, principle-based, and comprehensive management accounting approach that provides managers with decision support information for enterprise optimization. RCA emerged as a management accounting approach around 2000 and was subsequently developed at CAM-I,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.CAM-I.org|title=Consortium for Advanced Management International CAM-I|website=www.cam-i.org|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007163858/http://www.cam-i.org/|archivedate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Consortium for Advanced Manufacturing–International, in a Cost Management Section ''RCA interest group''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cam-i.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=30 Cost Management Section ''RCA interest group''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207190442/http://www.cam-i.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=30 |date=2008-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in December 2001.

===Throughput accounting===
{{main|Throughput accounting}}
The most significant recent direction in managerial accounting is throughput accounting; which recognizes the interdependencies of modern production processes. For any given product, customer or supplier, it is a tool to measure the contribution per unit of constrained resource.

===Transfer pricing===
{{main|Transfer pricing}}
Management accounting is an applied discipline used in various industries. The specific functions and principles followed can vary based on the industry. Management accounting principles in banking are specialized but do have some common fundamental concepts used whether the industry is manufacturing-based or service-oriented. For example, transfer pricing is a concept used in manufacturing but is also applied in banking. It is a fundamental principle used in assigning value and revenue attribution to the various business units. Essentially, transfer pricing in banking is the method of assigning the interest rate risk of the bank to the various funding sources and uses of the enterprise. Thus, the bank's corporate treasury department will assign funding charges to the business units for their use of the bank's resources when they make loans to clients. The treasury department will also assign funding credit to business units who bring in deposits (resources) to the bank. Although the [[funds transfer pricing]] process is primarily applicable to the loans and deposits of the various banking units, this proactive is applied to all assets and liabilities of the business segment. Once transfer pricing is applied and any other management accounting entries or adjustments are posted to the ledger (which are usually memo accounts and are not included in the legal entity results), the business units are able to produce segment financial results which are used by both internal and external users to evaluate performance.

==Resources and continuous learning==
There are a variety of ways to keep current and continue to build one's knowledge base in the field of management accounting. [[Certified Management Accountants]] (CMAs) are required to achieve continuing education hours every year, similar to a [[Certified Public Accountant]]. A company may also have research and training materials available for use in a corporate owned library. This is more common in [[Fortune 500]] companies who have the resources to fund this type of training medium.

There are also journals, online articles and blogs available.  The journal ''Cost Management'' ({{ISSN|1092-8057}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ria.thomsonreuters.com/estore/printdetail.aspx?ID=ZMCMP |title=Cost Management |publisher=Thomson Reuters |year=2011 |accessdate=November 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Institute of Management Accounting (IMA)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lbtc.co.uk/accounting-finance-banking-blog/role-accounting-finance-department/ Institute of Management Accounting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207160120/http://www.imanet.org/publications_maq.asp |date=2007-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; site are sources which include ''[[Management Accounting Quarterly]]'' and ''Strategic Finance'' publications.

A '''fence''' is a structure that encloses an area, typically outdoors, and is usually constructed from posts that are connected by boards, wire, rails or netting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Collins Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=William Collins Sons &amp; Co. Ltd |editor=Patrick Hanks |year=1985 |page=534 |isbn=0-00-433078-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fence differs from a [[wall]] in not having a solid foundation along its whole length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Garden DIY Expert |author=Dr D G Hessayon |publisher=pbi publications |year=1992 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780903505376/page/5 5] |isbn=0-903505-37-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780903505376/page/5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatives to fencing include a [[ditch (fortification)|ditch]] (sometimes filled with [[water]], forming a [[moat]]).

==Legal issues==
[[Image:DFRFence.jpg|thumb|A typical urban fence]]

In most developed areas the use of fencing is regulated, variously in commercial, residential, and agricultural areas.  Height, material, [[setback (land use)|setback]], and aesthetic issues are among the considerations subject to regulation.

===Required use===

The following types of areas or facilities often are required by law to be fenced in, for safety and security reasons:

* Facilities with open high-voltage equipment (transformer stations, [[mast radiator]]s). Transformer stations are usually surrounded with barbed-wire fences. Around mast radiators, wooden fences are used to avoid the problem of [[eddy current]]s.
* Railway lines (in the United Kingdom)
*fixed machinery with dangerous mobile parts (for example at merry go rounds on entertainment parks)
* Explosive factories and quarry stores
* Most industrial plants
* Airfields and airports

=== History ===
[[File:Concretefence.JPG|thumb|Mass concrete fence in [[Russia]]]]
{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}
Servitudes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/servitude| title= =\Servitude| dictionary= Merriam-Webster| accessdate= 2012-06-15| url-status= live| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120524145033/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/servitude| archivedate= 2012-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; are legal arrangements of land use arising out of private agreements. Under the [[feudal]] system, most land in England was cultivated in common fields, where [[peasants]] were allocated strips of [[arable land]] that were used to support the needs of the local village or [[manoralism|manor]]. By the sixteenth century the growth of population and prosperity provided incentives for landowners to use their land in more profitable ways, dispossessing the peasantry. Common fields were aggregated and enclosed by large and enterprising farmers—either through negotiation among one another or by lease from the landlord—to maximize the productivity of the available land and contain livestock. Fences redefined the means by which land is used, resulting in the modern law of servitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Jesse Dukeminer et al., Property, pp. 668-70 (6th ed. 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Zagroda z Rożnowic (Rozenberg, 1858).JPG|thumb|A [[Wattle (construction)|wattle]] fence at [[Muzeum Budownictwa Ludowego w Sanoku|Sanok-Skansen]] outdoor museum in [[Poland]]]]
In the United States, the earliest settlers claimed land by simply fencing it in. Later, as the American government formed, unsettled land became technically owned by the government and programs to register land ownership developed, usually making raw land available for low prices or for free, if the owner improved the property, including the construction of fences.  However, the remaining vast tracts of unsettled land were often used as a commons, or, in the [[American West]], &quot;[[open range]]&quot;  as degradation of [[habitat]] developed due to overgrazing and a [[tragedy of the commons]] situation arose, common areas began to either be allocated to individual landowners via mechanisms such as the [[Homestead Act]] and [[Desert Land Act]] and fenced in, or, if kept in public hands, leased to individual users for limited purposes, with fences built to separate tracts of public and private land.

===United Kingdom===
;Generally
Ownership of a fence on a boundary varies. The last relevant original title [[deed]](s)&lt;ref&gt;In registered land scanned in and stored at the Land Registry&lt;/ref&gt; and a completed seller's property information form may document which side has to put up and has installed any fence respectively; the first using &quot;T&quot; marks/symbols (the side with the &quot;T&quot; denotes the owner); the latter by a ticked box to the best of the last owner's belief with no duty, as the conventionally agreed conveyancing process stresses, to make any detailed, protracted enquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gardenlaw.co.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=12279|title=Garden Law Discussion • View topic - URGENT!

Otherwise it tends to be on non-owner's side so the fence owner might access the posts when repairs are needed but this is not a legal requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/land-registry-plans-boundaries/land-registry-plans-boundaries-practice-guide-40-supplement-3|title=Land Registry plans: boundaries (practice guide 40, supplement 3) - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-02-17|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218063737/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/land-registry-plans-boundaries/land-registry-plans-boundaries-practice-guide-40-supplement-3|archivedate=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where estate planners wish to entrench privacy a close-boarded fence or equivalent well-maintained hedge of a minimum height may be stipulated by deed. Beyond a standard height planning permission is necessary.

;The hedge and ditch ownership presumption
Where a rural fence or hedge has (or in some cases had) an adjacent ditch, the ditch is normally in the same ownership as the hedge or fence, with the ownership boundary being the edge of the ditch furthest from the fence or hedge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199899/ldjudgmt/jd990429/alan.htm Lawrence J. in ''Vowles v. Miller'' (1810) 3 Taunt. 137, 138, quoted in ''Alan Wibberley Building Limited v. Insley'', House of Lords Judgement (1999)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708225623/https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199899/ldjudgmt/jd990429/alan.htm |date=2017-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The principle of this rule is that an owner digging a boundary ditch will normally dig it up to the very edge of their land, and must then pile the spoil on their own side of the ditch to avoid [[trespass]]ing on their neighbour.  They may then erect a fence or hedge on the spoil, leaving the ditch on its far side.  Exceptions exist in law, for example where a plot of land derives from subdivision of a larger one along the centre line of a previously-existing ditch or other feature, particularly where reinforced by historic parcel numbers with acreages beneath which were used to tally up a total for administrative units not to confirm the actual size of holdings, a rare instance where Ordnance Survey maps often provide more than circumstantial evidence namely as to which feature is to be considered the boundary.

;Fencing of livestock
On private land in the [[United Kingdom]], it is the landowner's responsibility to fence their [[livestock]] in.  Conversely, for [[common land]], it is the surrounding landowners' duty to fence the common's livestock out such as in large parts of the [[New Forest]]. Large commons with livestock roaming have been greatly reduced by 18th and 19th century Acts for enclosure of commons covering most local units, with most remaining such land in the UK's National Parks.

===United States===
{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}
Distinctly different land ownership and fencing patterns arose in the eastern and western United States.  Original fence laws on the east coast were based on the British [[common law]] system, and rapidly increasing population quickly resulted in laws requiring livestock to be fenced in.  In the west, land ownership patterns and policies reflected a strong influence of [[Spain|Spanish]] law and tradition, plus the vast land area involved made extensive fencing impractical until mandated by a growing population and conflicts between landowners.  The &quot;open range&quot; tradition of requiring landowners to fence out unwanted livestock was dominant in most of the rural west until very late in the 20th century, and even today, a few isolated regions of the west still have open range statutes on the books.  More recently, fences are generally constructed on the surveyed property line as precisely as possible. Today, across the nation, each state is free to develop its own laws regarding fences.  In many cases for both rural and urban property owners, the laws were designed to require adjacent landowners to share the responsibility for maintaining a common boundary fenceline. Today, however, only 22 states have retained that provision.

==Cultural value of fences==
[[File:Thavakkara6.jpg|thumbnail|A fence in [[Thavakkara]], India]]
The value of fences and the metaphorical significance of a fence, both positive and negative, has been extensively utilized throughout western culture.  A few examples include:
*&quot;Good fences make good neighbors.&quot; – a proverb quoted by [[Robert Frost]] in the poem &quot;[[Mending Wall]]&quot;
*&quot;A good neighbour is a fellow who smiles at you over the back fence, but doesn't climb over it.&quot; – [[Arthur Baer]]
*&quot;There is something about jumping a horse over a fence, something that makes you feel good. Perhaps it's the risk, the gamble. In any event it's a thing I need.&quot; – [[William Faulkner]]
*&quot;Fear is the highest fence.&quot; – [[Dudley Nichols]]
*&quot;To be fenced in is to be withheld.&quot; – [[Kurt Tippett]]
*&quot;What have they done to the earth?&amp;nbsp;/ What have they done to our fair sister?&amp;nbsp;/ Ravaged and plundered&amp;nbsp;/ and ripped her&amp;nbsp;/ and bit her&amp;nbsp;/ stuck her with knives&amp;nbsp;/ in the side of the dawn&amp;nbsp;/ and tied her with fences&amp;nbsp;/ and dragged her down.&quot; – [[Jim Morrison]], of [[The Doors]]
*&quot;[[Don't Fence Me In (song)|Don't Fence Me In]]&quot; – [[Cole Porter]]
*&quot;You shall build a turtle fence.&quot; – [[Peter Hoekstra]]
*&quot;A woman's dress should be like a barbed-wire fence: serving its purpose without obstructing the view.&quot; – [[Marilyn Monroe]]

'''Barbed wire''', also known as '''barb wire''', occasionally corrupted as '''bobbed wire'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.murraycountymuseum.com/barbed_wire.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714133236/http://www.murraycountymuseum.com/barbed_wire.html | archivedate=2011-07-14 | title=A Collection of Barbed Wire | publisher=The [[Murray County, Georgia|Murray County]] Museum | accessdate=2006-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''bob wire''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/06/books/the-rape-of-the-west.html | title=The Rape of the West | author=Timothy Foote | newspaper=The New York Times | accessdate=2006-11-28 |  date=September 6, 1999|  quote = ...a pioneer is a man who turned all the grass upside down, strung bob-wire over the dust that was left... }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of [[steel]] fencing [[wire]] constructed with sharp edges or points arranged at intervals along the strands. It is used to construct inexpensive [[fence]]s and is used atop [[wall]]s surrounding secured property. It is also a major feature of the fortifications in [[trench warfare]] (as a [[wire obstacle]]).

A person or animal trying to pass through or over barbed wire will suffer discomfort and possibly injury (this is especially true if the fence is also [[electric fence|electric]]). Barbed wire fencing requires only fence posts, wire, and fixing devices such as [[staple (fastener)|staple]]s. It is simple to construct and quick to erect, even by an unskilled person.

The first patent in the United States for barbed wire&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|RE7136E|first patent in the United States for barbed wire}}&lt;/ref&gt; was issued in 1867 to Lucien B. Smith of [[Kent, Ohio]], who is regarded as the inventor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/telephone/timeline/timeline_text.html | title= The American Experience Technology Timeline: 1752 - 1990 | accessdate=2009-01-28 | work= The American Experience | publisher= Public Broadcasting Systems | year= 2000 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090207005119/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/telephone/timeline/timeline_text.html | archivedate= 7 February 2009  | url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2672 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071003100907/http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2672 | archivedate= 2007-10-03 | title= Lucien B.

Glidden]] of [[DeKalb, Illinois]], received a patent for the modern invention&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|157124A|patent for the modern invention}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1874 after he made his own modifications to previous versions.

Barbed wire was the first wire technology capable of restraining [[cattle]]. Wire fences were cheaper and easier to erect than their alternatives. (One such alternative was [[Osage orange]], a thorny bush that was time-consuming to transplant and grow.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlisle|first=Rodney|date=2004|title=Scientific American Inventions and Discoveries|page=[https://archive.org/details/scientificameric0000carl/page/241 241]|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Songs, Inc.|location=New Jersey|isbn=978-0-471-24410-3|url=https://archive.org/details/scientificameric0000carl/page/241}}&lt;/ref&gt; When wire fences became widely available in the United States in the late 19th century, it became more affordable to fence much larger areas than before, and intensive [[animal husbandry]] was made practical on a much larger scale.

An example of the costs of fencing with lumber immediately prior to the invention of barbed wire can be found with the first farmers in the [[Fresno]], California, area, who spent nearly $4,000 ({{inflation|US|4000|1872|fmt=eq|cursign=$|r=-3}}) to have wood for fencing delivered and erected to protect {{convert|2,500|acre|ha}} of wheat crop from [[open range|free-ranging]] livestock in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Winchell |first=Lilbourne |title=History of Fresno County and the San Joaquin Valley |page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

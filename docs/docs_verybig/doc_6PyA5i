For example, these forms, as such, are represented by the imperatives:
:''Mene tai tule, mutta pane se ovi kiinni ja ole hiljaa'' (standard)
:''Mee tai tuu, mut paa se ovi kii ja oo hiljaa.'' (word-by-word) &quot;Go or come, but put the door closed and be quiet.&quot;
To demonstrate the use of the personal form, the reply is:
:''Meen tai tuun, paan oven kii ja oon hiljaa'' (&quot;I go or come, (I) put the door closed and (I) am quiet&quot;).
The infinitives are unchanged, as in:
:''Mennä tai tulla, panna ovi kii ja olla hiljaa'' (&quot;To go or to come, to put the door closed and to be quiet&quot;).
As are participles, despite them using the oblique stem:
:''menevä tai tuleva, oven kii paneva ja hiljaa oleva'' (&quot;Going or coming, door closed-putting and quiet-being&quot;).

The 't' at the end of participles ending ''-nut, -rut, -lut, -sut'' (or ''-nyt'' etc.)  is often dropped when no consonant follows, or replaced by [[gemination]] of the following consonant.

:''minä en puhunut'' (formal)
::''mä en puhunu'' (colloquial)
:::I didn't speak
but

::''mä en puhunu kenellekään'' (colloquial)
:::I didn't speak to anyone
is actually pronounced as if it were

::''mä en puhunuk kenellekkään'' (with examples of gemination)

In the formal language some pronouns are considered optional, but in spoken language the pronoun is usually enunciated but may be optional when answering questions (which puts the person in the proper context).

:''Menemme Ouluun'' or ''Me menemme Ouluun''  (&quot;We are going to Oulu&quot;) (formal language)
:''Me mennään Ouluun'' (&quot;We are off to Oulu&quot;) (informal language)

In the latter example, dropping ''me'' would change the meaning from a statement to a suggestion

:''Mennään Ouluun'' (&quot;Let's go to Oulu&quot;) (informal or spoken language suggestion)

Compare the conjugation of OLLA in the formal language (Table 1) and in the spoken or colloquial language (Table 2). Table 2 shows in highlights the areas where there are differences in the structures between formal and informal. Optional pronouns are in brackets. English equivalent is in Table 3.

== Questions ==
In everyday speech, the ''-ko/kö'' suffix has the ''-s'' clitic added, becoming ''-kos/kös'', which in turn reduces to ''-ks'':

:''olenko minä hengissä?'' → ''oo(n)ks mä hengis?'' &quot;am I alive?&quot;
:''puhutko sinä englantia?'' → ''puhut sä enkkuu?'' or ''puhuks(ä) enkkuu?'' &quot;do you (sg.) speak English?&quot;
:''tuliko hän jo?'' → ''tulikse jo?'' (via ''tuliko se jo?'') &quot;did he/she come yet?&quot;

The choice of morphemes ''-kos/kös'' or ''-ks'' is not always purely dialectal or accidental. Many Finns regularly use more than one variation in their speech. The choice might depend among others on the rhythm of the sentence or the (wished) tempo of the discussion. Sometimes it has other clearly communicational purposes e.g. the longer variation might be used to soften an intruding question.

The clitic ''-s'' is also found in imperatives, e.g. ''me(n)es'' &quot;(I expect you to) go!&quot; It can also be, that the ''-tkö'' elides not to ''-ks'', but ''-t'' before a 's', e.g. ''menetkö sä'' ? ''me(n)et sä''. Because this is identical to ''sä menet'' except for the word order, questions are indicated by word order.

== Possessive suffix ==
Spoken language has a different grammar for the [[possessive suffix]]. For direct addresses, save for one form it is not used, so that the pronoun cannot be omitted. Even in the second-person singular, the pronoun is virtually never omitted. In contrast, in the literary language, the pronoun is optional and typically omitted. Compare English in which, e.g., &quot;The house to which this door belongs&quot; would be the correct written form even though &quot;the house whose door this is&quot; would be the more common spoken version.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Formal !! Spoken !! English
|-
| (minun) talo'''ni''' || mun talo || my house
|-
| (sinun) talo'''si''' || sun talo(s)/talos || your (sg) house
|-
| (hänen) talo'''nsa''' || sen talo || his/her house
|-
| (meidän) talo'''mme''' || meiän talo || our house
|-
| (teidän) talo'''nne''' || teiän talo || your (pl) house
|-
| (heidän) talo'''nsa''' || niitten/niien talo || their house
|}

Here, the pronoun of the literary form is also shown.

Notice one fact: Finnish has no [[possessive adjective]]s. The pronouns are regularly inflected, like if &quot;I's house&quot;, &quot;you's house&quot;, &quot;we's house&quot;.

However, the suffixes ''-s'', ''-nsa'' and ''-nne'' are used to avoid repeating a pronoun, e.g. &quot;He took &lt;u&gt;his&lt;/u&gt; hat and left&quot; is ''Se otti lakki&lt;u&gt;nsa&lt;/u&gt; ja lähti.'' (The translation from English *''Se otti &lt;u&gt;sen&lt;/u&gt; lakin ja lähti'' would mean &quot;He took &lt;u&gt;his/her&lt;/u&gt; hat and left&quot; or &quot;He took the (specific) hat and left&quot;.)

== Omission of the negative verb ==
When a negative sentence is formed, the main verb goes into the [[imperative mood]] and gives all of its inflections to the negative verb ''ei'', e.g. ''tuemme'' → ''emme tue''. Usually the word ''mitään'' (&quot;anything&quot;) and an [[Syntactic expletive|expletive]] is added to the sentence. This means that even if the negative verb ''ei'' is left out, the meaning is indicated by this context. For example:

:&lt;u&gt;Ei&lt;/u&gt; se mitään osaa. &quot;He &lt;u&gt;doesn't&lt;/u&gt; know anything.&quot;
:Se mitään osaa. &quot;He know anything.&quot; (&quot;doesn't&quot; omitted)

This omission of the negative verb ''ei'' is considered one of the most recent changes in Finnish. Usually this construction indicates mistrust or frustration. (There is a less than serious text{{which|date=January 2014}} calling this ''aggressiivi'', see [[aggressive mood]].) However, it can be a neutral negative statement: ''Tästä artikkelista &lt;u&gt;mitään opi&lt;/u&gt;'' (From this article, &lt;s&gt;you don't&lt;/s&gt; &lt;u&gt;learn anything&lt;/u&gt;).

== Regional variation ==
Linguists such as Mielikäinen argue that the dialects of Finnish have been considerably homogenized by 20th century developments of urbanization and other internal population movements to the point that &quot;pure&quot; dialects have disappeared. &quot;Local spoken languages&quot; have developed from standard Finnish to give variety with essentially standard Finnish structure but with some local features. Considerable stigma has been associated with dialects (accurately or not) perceived as rural in the 20th century. People who have moved to the city have adopted a variety resembling standard Finnish, which has been imposed upon dialect speakers by the school, the military and the employers.

Breaking up some consonant clusters on syllable boundaries with an [[epenthetic vowel]] is a feature of several dialects, such as those of [[Ostrobothnia (region)|Ostrobothnia]] and [[Savonian dialects|Savonia]]:  The neutral vowel is the same as the preceding vowel. For example, ''juhla'' → ''juhula'' &quot;celebration&quot;, ''salmi'' → ''salami'' &quot;strait&quot;, ''palvelu'' → ''palavelu'' &quot;service&quot;, ''halpa'' → ''halapa'' &quot;cheap&quot;, ''äffä'' → ''ähävä'' (via ''ähvä'') &quot;letter F&quot;. Pairs of dissimilar consonants with /l/ or /h/ (in Savo, also /n/) as the first consonant are subject to epenthesis; other clusters or geminates are not. However, a strong epenthetic vowel is seen as dialectal, and in Helsinki and urbanized areas, indicates origins &quot;in the countryside&quot; (since for Helsinki people, everything but Helsinki is rural).

=== Tavastian dialects ===
Tavastian dialects are diverse because other, surrounding dialects have influenced them. The following features are all found in Finnish spoken in Helsinki, and many of them occur also in some other Tavastian dialects.
* Word ''sillai'' &quot;in that way&quot;, which is usually something else like ''silleen'' elsewhere.
* [[Partitive]] plurals ending ''-ja/-jä'' in generic Finnish become ''-i'', and likewise the partitive plural ''-ia/-iä'' simplifies to ''-ii'': ''märkiä takkeja'' → ''märkii takkei'' &quot;wet jackets&quot;. (also in Nurmijärvi, Kotka)
* The first infinitive, e.g. ''juosta'' &quot;to run&quot;, is replaced by the third-person form ''juoksee'' &quot;runs&quot; by some speakers. For example, standard ''Voisitko sinä &lt;u&gt;juosta&lt;/u&gt; hakemaan sen'' becomes ''Voisitsä &lt;u&gt;juoksee&lt;/u&gt; hakeen sen'' &quot;Could you run to get it&quot;. This form is probably historically speaking not the third-person form, but the colloquial, shortened form ''juokseen'' of the third infinitive form ''juoksemaan'', which exhibites a tendency to oust the first infinitive even in the formal language, cf. the old dispute, whether ''alkaa juoksemaan'' (&quot;to start running&quot;) should be allowed in the formal language or not (the current norm is still ''alkaa juosta'' with the first infinitive). (also in Tuusula and Nurmijärvi)
* Abbreviations are common in Finnish spoken in the Southern coast of Finland. Final syllables in frequently used words may erode, like ''sitten'' → ''sit'', ''mutta'' → ''mut''. Case endings might be abbreviated, usually by the loss of the final vowel, e.g. ''siltä'' → ''silt''. (If a [[geminate]] would be &quot;left dangling&quot; at the end of the word, it becomes a single consonant, e.g. ''talossa'' → *''taloss'' → ''talos''.)
* Helsinki also has a local [[Helsinki slang|slang]], containing foreign loanwords which may be unintelligible to people from other parts of Finland. Some slang words have spread to the spoken language of youngsters elsewhere in Finland.
* Tampere is also in the area of Tavastian dialects.
** Occasional flapping or deletion of intervocalic &quot;L&quot;; the resulting sound is orthographically nil: ''kyllä siellä olisi'' → ''kyä siä ois''. This is seen even in the accentless form ''oisko'' ← standard ''olisiko''.

=== [[North Karelia|North and]] [[South Karelia]] === 
* personal pronouns: ''minä'' → ''mie'', ''sinä'' → ''sie'', ''hän'' → ''hää'', ''me'' → ''myö'', ''te'' → ''työ'', ''he'' → ''hyö''
** notice: ''se'' and ''ne'' don't change to ''syö'' or ''nyö'' respectively and ''hää'' and ''hyö'' are more commonly used than ''se'' and ''ne'' unlike in the standard colloquial language where ''hän'' and ''he'' are replaced with the non-personal equivalents
** the declined forms also vary, for example ''minua'' can be ''minnuu'', ''minuu'' or ''miuta'' depending on the regional dialect
* vowel epenthesis: ''kolme'' → ''kolome'', ''selvä'' → ''selevä''
* in some Karelian dialects the end of participles ending -nut or -nyt and -lut drop the vowel instead of 't': ''puhunut'' → ''puhunt'', ''käynyt'' → ''käynt'', ''katsonut'' → ''katsont''/''kattont'', ''mennyt'' → ''ment''/''mänt'', ''ollut'' → ''olt'', ''tullut'' → ''tult''
* some Karelian (and Savonian) dialects also use [[exessive case|the exessive case]]: ''kotoa'' → ''kotont(a)'', ''ulkoa'' → ''ulkont(a)'', ''siitä'' → ''siint(ä)''

=== Southwestern dialects ===
* Abbreviation occurs very often.
* In Turku: minä → mää, sinä → sää
* A unique characteristic of Turku dialect is the &quot;S&quot; imperfect tense, which has the ending ''-si'' instead of ''-i'', e.g., ''sattusi'' for ''sattui''.

=== Savonia ===
* Some difference in pronouns, ''myö, työ'' for ''me, te''. Notice that the [[Savo dialect]] has complicated differences in grammar, vowels and consonants compared to the standard language, e.g. ''öylen'' for ''eilen'', ''mänj'' for ''meni'', ''omaa rataansa'' → ''ommoo rattoosa''. The Savo dialect is the largest single dialect, and as such, has variants that differ significantly.

=== Ostrobothnia === 
* Consonant clusters with ''-j-'' are not allowed, so that a ''-i-'' is pronounced instead, e.g. ''kirja'' → ''kiria''. Minor vowel changes, for example, ''taloa'' → ''talua''. Particularly, the half-long vowels (found in word-final [[syllable coda|coda]]less single-vowel syllables) are lengthened into full-blown long vowels, as in ''iso'' → ''isoo''. The sound /d/ is completely replaced with a rhotic consonant ''r'', either a [[Trill consonant|trill]] /r/, or a [[Flap consonant|flap]] {{IPA|/ɾ/}}, which produces problems such as that there is no or almost no contrast between ''veden'' (of water) and ''veren'' (of blood). For speakers with the flap, there remains a small difference, not generally audible for outsiders. Usually context can be relied on to distinguish the word.
*Vaasa, Ostrobothnia, to an extent generic Finnish, too: Many frequently used expressions become clitics - this is optional, though. E.g. pronouns become [[clitic]]s for the negative verb ''ei'' and for the verb &quot;to be&quot;. In this table, the apostrophe (') is something between a full J and no sound at all.

* Additionally, in the Southwest, the interrogative pronoun ''kuka'' (&quot;who&quot;) is replaced by its partitive form, ''ketä'' (&quot;whom&quot;), e.g. ''Ketä siellä oli?'' (&quot;Who was there?&quot;) Other differences in case for interrogative words are ''mihinä'' (std. ''missä'', &quot;where&quot;) and ''mihkä'' (std. ''mihin'', &quot;into where&quot;).

* The close vowels {{IPA|/i, y, u/}} are similar to the corresponding [[cardinal vowel]]s {{IPA|[{{IPAplink|i}}, {{IPAplink|y}}, {{IPAplink|u}}]}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;suomi21&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Suomi|Toivanen|Ylitalo|2008|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The open front unrounded vowel {{IPA|/æ/}} is phonetically near-open {{IPAblink|æ}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;suomi21&quot;/&gt;
* The unrounded open vowel transcribed in IPA with {{IPA|/ɑ/}} has been variously described as near-open back {{IPAblink|ɑ|ɑ̝}}&lt;ref name=&quot;suomi21&quot;/&gt; and open central {{IPAblink|ɑ̈}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Maddieson|1984}}, cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Suomi|Toivanen|Ylitalo|2008|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finnish has a phonological contrast between single ({{IPA|/æ e i ø y ɑ o u/}}) and doubled ({{IPA|/ææ ee ii øø yy ɑɑ oo uu/}}) vowels.&lt;ref name=&quot;suomi19&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Suomi|Toivanen|Ylitalo|2008|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phonetically the doubled vowels are single continuous sounds ({{IPA|[æː eː iː øː yː ɑː oː uː]}}) where the extra duration of the hold phase of the vowel signals that they count as two successive vowel phonemes rather than one. The doubled mid vowels are more common in unstressed syllables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Iivonen|Harnud|2005|pp=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diphthongs===
The table below lists the conventionally recognized [[diphthong]]s in Finnish. In speech (i.e. phonetically speaking) a diphthong does not sound like a sequence of two different vowels; instead, the sound of the first vowel gradually glides into the sound of the second one with full vocalization lasting through the whole sound. That is to say, the two portions of the diphthong are not broken by a pause or stress pattern. In Finnish, diphthongs are considered phonemic units, contrasting with both doubled vowels and with single vowels. Phonologically, however, Finnish diphthongs usually ''are'' analyzed as sequences (this in contrast to languages like [[English language|English]], where the diphthongs are best analyzed as independent phonemes).

Diphthongs ending in ''i'' can occur in any syllable, but those ending in rounded vowels usually occur only in initial syllables, and rising diphthongs are confined to that syllable. It is usually taught that diphthongization occurs only with the combinations listed. However, there are recognized situations in which other vowel pairs diphthongize. For example, in rapid speech the word ''yläosa'' ('upper part', from ''ylä-'', 'upper' + ''osa'', 'part') can be pronounced {{IPA|[ˈylæo̯sɑ]}} (with the diphthong {{IPA|/æo̯/}}). The usual pronunciation is {{IPA|[ˈylæ.ˌosɑ]}} (with those vowels belonging to separate syllables).

The diphthongs {{IPA|[ey̯]}} and {{IPA|[iy̯]}} are quite rare and mostly found in [[Morphological derivation|derivative words]], where a derivational affix starting with {{IPA|/y/}} (or properly the vowel harmonic [[archiphoneme]] {{IPA|/U/}}) fuses with the preceding vowel, e.g. ''pimeys'' 'darkness' from ''pimeä'' 'dark' + {{IPA|/-(U)US/}} '-ness' and ''siistiytyä'' 'to tidy up oneself' from ''siisti'' 'tidy' + {{IPA|/-UTU/}} (a kind of [[Grammatical voice|middle voice]]) + {{IPA|/-(d)A/}} (infinitive suffix). Older {{IPA|/*ey̯/}} and {{IPA|/*iy̯/}} in initial syllables have been shifted to {{IPA|[øy̯]}} and {{IPA|[yː]}}.

Opening diphthongs are in standard Finnish only found in root-initial syllables like in words ''tietää'' 'to know', ''takapyörä'' 'rear wheel' (from ''taka-'' 'back, rear' + ''pyörä'' 'wheel'; the latter part is secondarily stressed) or ''luo'' 'towards'. This might make them easier to pronounce as true opening diphthongs {{IPA|[uo̯, ie̯, yø̯]}} (in some accents even wider opening {{IPA|[uɑ̯, iɑ̯~iæ̯, yæ̯]}}{{efn|In these dialects, ''ie'' may be reflected as either {{IPA|[iɑ̯]}} or {{IPA|[iæ̯]}} depending on [[#Vowel harmony|vowel harmony]].}}) and not as centering diphthongs {{IPA|[uə̯, iə̯, yə̯]}}, which are more common in the world's languages. The opening diphthongs come from earlier doubled mid vowels: {{IPA|/*oo/ &gt; [uo̯], /*ee/ &gt; [ie̯], /*øø/ &gt; [yø̯]}}. Since that time new doubled mid vowels have come to the language from various sources.

Among the phonological processes operating in Finnish dialects are diphthongization and diphthong reduction. For example, [[Savo Finnish]] has the phonemic contrast of {{IPA|/ɑ/}} vs. {{IPA|/uɑ̯/}} vs. {{IPA|/ɑɑ/}} instead of standard language contrast of {{IPA|/ɑ/}} vs. {{IPA|/ɑɑ/}} vs. {{IPA|/ɑu̯/}}.

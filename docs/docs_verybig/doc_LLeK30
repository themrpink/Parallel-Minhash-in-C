Deforestation for agricultural purposes removes forests, which hold large amounts of carbon, and replaces them, generally with agricultural or urban areas. Both of these replacement land cover types store comparatively small amounts of carbon so that the net result of the transition is that more carbon stays in the atmosphere.  However, the effects on the atmosphere and overall carbon cycle can be intentionally and/or naturally reversed with [[reforestation]].  

===Fossil carbon extraction===
{{See also|Coal mining|Petroleum extraction}}
[[File:Global Carbon Emissions.svg|thumb|350px|Annual global emissions of fossil carbon (in gigatons).]]
The largest and one of the fastest growing human impacts on the carbon cycle and biosphere is the extraction and burning of [[fossil fuels]], which directly transfer carbon from the geosphere into the atmosphere.  Carbon dioxide is also produced and released during the [[calcination]] of [[limestone]] for [[clinker (cement)|clinker]] production.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC (2007) [https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg3/en/ch7s7-4-5.html 7.4.5 Minerals] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160525042327/http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg3/en/ch7s7-4-5.html |date=25 May 2016 }} in ''Climate Change 2007'': Working Group III: Mitigation of Climate Change,&lt;/ref&gt; Clinker is an industrial [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] of [[cement]].

===Man-made chemicals===
Smaller amounts of man-made [[petrochemical]]s, containing fossil carbon, can have unexpected and outsized effects on the biological carbon cycle.  This occurs in part because they have been purposely created by humans to [[decompose]] slowly, which enables their unnatural persistence and buildup throughout the biosphere.  In many cases their pathways through the broader carbon cycle are also not yet well-characterized or understood. 

====Plastics====
{{See also|Plastic pollution|Microplastics}}
[[File:Pathway-of-plastic-to-ocean.png|thumb|380px|The pathway by which plastics enter the world's oceans.]]
Close to 400&amp;nbsp;million tons of plastic were manufactured globally during year 2018 with annual growth rates approaching 10%, and over 6 gigatons produced in total since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;plaspol&quot;/&gt;   Plastics eventually undergo fragmentation as a typical first step in their decay, and this enables their widespread distribution by air and water currents.  Animals easily internalize microplastics and nanoplastics through ingestion and inhalation, accompanied by risks of [[bioaccumulation]].  [[Biodegradable plastic]]s placed into landfills generate methane and carbon dioxide which cycles through the atmosphere unless captured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/lmop/basic-information-about-landfill-gas|title=Basic Information about Landfill Gas - US EPA |first=US |last=EPA,OAR,OAP,CCD |website=US EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A major review of the scientific evidence as of year 2019 did not identify major consequences for human society at current levels, but does foresee substantial risks emerging within the next century.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAPEA Scientific Advice for Policy by European Academies 2019&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=A scientific perspective on microplastics in nature and society|last=SAPEA (Scientific Advice for Policy by European Academies)|publisher=SAPEA (Scientific Advice for Policy by European Academies)|year=2019|isbn=978-3-9820301-0-4|location=https://www.sapea.info/topics/microplastics/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2019 study indicated that degradation of plastics through sun exposure, releases both carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ward|first1=Collin P.|last2=Armstrong|first2=Cassia J.|last3=Walsh|first3=Anna N.|last4=Jackson|first4=Julia H.|last5=Reddy|first5=Christopher M.|date=2019-11-12|title=Sunlight Converts Polystyrene to Carbon Dioxide and Dissolved Organic Carbon|url=https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.estlett.9b00532|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology Letters|volume=6|issue=11|pages=669–674|doi=10.1021/acs.estlett.9b00532}}&lt;/ref&gt;    [[Bioplastics]] with a more natural and rapid carbon cycle have been developed as an alternative to other petroleum-based [[single-use plastic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/05/researchers-race-to-make-bioplastics-from-straw-and-food-waste | title=Researchers race to make bioplastics from straw and food waste | date=5 July 2018 | last=Carrington | first=Damian | website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Halocarbons====
{{See also|Halocarbons|Fluorinated gases}}
Halocarbons are less prolific compounds developed for diverse uses throughout industry; for example as [[solvent]]s and [[refrigerant]]s.  Nevertheless, the buildup of relatively small concentrations (parts per trillion) of [[chlorofluorocarbon]], [[hydrofluorocarbon]], and [[perfluorocarbon]] gases in the atmosphere is responsible for about 10% of the total direct [[radiative forcing]] from all long-lived greenhouse gases (year 2019); which includes forcing from the much larger concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aggi/aggi.html |title=The NOAA Annual Greenhouse Gas Index (AGGI) |publisher=[[NOAA]] Global Monitoring Laboratory/Earth System Research Laboratories |author=Butler J. and Montzka S. |year=2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chlorofluorocarbons also cause stratospheric [[ozone depletion]]. International efforts are ongoing under the [[Montreal Protocol]] and [[Kyoto Protocol]] to control rapid growth in the industrial manufacturing and use of these environmentally potent gases.   For some applications more benign alternatives such as [[hydrofluoroolefin]]s have been developed and are being gradually introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sciance |first1=Fred |title=The Transition from HFC- 134a to a Low -GWP Refrigerant in Mobile Air Conditioners HFO -1234yf |url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-09/documents/sciance.pdf |access-date=1 August 2018 |work=General Motors Public Policy Center |date=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate change feedbacks===
{{Main|Climate change feedback}}
Current trends in climate change lead to higher ocean temperatures and [[acidity]], thus modifying marine ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0967-0645(02)00003-6 |title=Global sea–air CO2 flux based on climatological surface ocean pCO2, and seasonal biological and temperature effects |journal=Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography |volume=49 |issue=9–10 |pages=1601–1622 |year=2002 |last1=Takahashi |first1=Taro |last2=Sutherland |first2=Stewart C. |last3=Sweeney |first3=Colm |last4=Poisson |first4=Alain |last5=Metzl |first5=Nicolas |last6=Tilbrook |first6=Bronte |last7=Bates |first7=Nicolas |last8=Wanninkhof |first8=Rik |last9=Feely |first9=Richard A. |last10=Sabine |first10=Christopher |last11=Olafsson |first11=Jon |last12=Nojiri |first12=Yukihiro |bibcode=2002DSRII..49.1601T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, acid rain and polluted runoff from agriculture and industry change the ocean's chemical composition. Such changes can have dramatic effects on highly sensitive ecosystems such as [[coral reef]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature04095 |pmid=16193043 |title=Anthropogenic ocean acidification over the twenty-first century and its impact on calcifying organisms |journal=Nature |volume=437 |issue=7059 |pages=681–686 |year=2005 |last1=Orr |first1=James C. |last2=Fabry |first2=Victoria J. |last3=Aumont |first3=Olivier |last4=Bopp |first4=Laurent |last5=Doney |first5=Scott C. |last6=Feely |first6=Richard A. |last7=Gnanadesikan |first7=Anand |last8=Gruber |first8=Nicolas |last9=Ishida |first9=Akio |last10=Joos |first10=Fortunat |last11=Key |first11=Robert M. |last12=Lindsay |first12=Keith |last13=Maier-Reimer |first13=Ernst |last14=Matear |first14=Richard |last15=Monfray |first15=Patrick |last16=Mouchet |first16=Anne |last17=Najjar |first17=Raymond G. |last18=Plattner |first18=Gian-Kasper |last19=Rodgers |first19=Keith B. |last20=Sabine |first20=Christopher L. |last21=Sarmiento |first21=Jorge L. |last22=Schlitzer |first22=Reiner |last23=Slater |first23=Richard D. |last24=Totterdell |first24=Ian J. |last25=Weirig |first25=Marie-France |last26=Yamanaka |first26=Yasuhiro |last27=Yool |first27=Andrew |bibcode=2005Natur.437..681O |s2cid=4306199 |url=https://epic.awi.de/id/eprint/13479/1/Orr2005a.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus limiting the ocean's ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere on a regional scale and reducing oceanic biodiversity globally.

[[Arctic methane emissions]] indirectly caused by anthropogenic global warming also affect the carbon cycle and contribute to further warming.

Higher temperatures and {{CO2}} levels in the atmosphere increase decomposition rates in soil, thus returning {{CO2}} stored in plant material more quickly to the atmosphere.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}  It can also lead to higher gross primary production. It increases photosynthesis rates by allowing plants to more efficiently use water, because they no longer need to leave their [[stomata]] open for such long periods of time in order to absorb the same amount of carbon dioxide. This type of carbon dioxide fertilization affects mainly [[C3 plants]], because [[C4 plants]] can already concentrate {{CO2}} effectively.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}  Other human-caused changes, like [[air pollution]] for example, damages plants and soils  ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere.  Many agricultural and land use practices lead to higher [[erosion]] rates, washing carbon out of soils and decreasing plant productivity.

The '''queen''' (♕, ♛) is the most powerful [[chess piece|piece]] in the game of [[chess]], able to move any number of squares vertically, horizontally or [[diagonal]]ly. Each player starts the game with one queen, placed in the middle of the first {{chessgloss|rank}} next to the [[King (chess)|king]]. Because the queen is the strongest piece, a [[pawn (chess)|pawn]] is [[promotion (chess)|promoted]] to a queen in the vast majority of cases.

In the game ''[[shatranj]]'', the ancestor of chess that included only male figures, the closest thing to the queen was the ''ferz'', a weak piece only able to move or capture one step diagonally and not at all in any other direction. The modern chess queen gained power in the 15th&amp;nbsp;century.
{{AN chess|pos=toc}}

==Nomenclature==
In most languages the piece is known as &quot;queen&quot; or &quot;lady&quot; (e.g. Italian ''regina''). Asian and Eastern European languages tend to refer to it as ''[[vizier]]'', minister or advisor (e.g. Arabic/Persian وزیر ''wazir'', Russian ферзь ''ferz''). In Polish it is known as the ''[[hetman]]''&amp;nbsp;– the name of a major historical military-political office, while in [[Estonian language|Estonian]] it is called ''lipp'' (&quot;flag&quot;, &quot;[[Military colours, standards and guidons|standard]]&quot;).

==Placement and movement==
The white queen starts on d1, while the black queen starts on d8. With the [[chessboard]] oriented correctly, the white queen starts on a white square and the black queen starts on a black square—thus the [[mnemonic]]s &quot;queen gets her color&quot;, &quot;queen on [her] [own] color&quot;, or &quot;the dress [queen piece] matches the shoes [square]&quot; (Latin: ''servat rēgīna colōrem'').

The queen can be moved any number of unoccupied squares in a straight line vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, thus combining the moves of the [[Rook (chess)|rook]] and [[Bishop (chess)|bishop]]. The queen captures by occupying the square on which an enemy piece sits.

{{clear left}}

Although both players start with one queen each, a [[Pawn (chess)|pawn]] can be [[promotion (chess)|promoted]] to any of several types of pieces, including a queen, when the pawn is moved to the player's furthest rank (the opponent's first rank). Such a queen created by promotion can be an additional queen, or if the player's queen has been captured, a replacement queen. Pawn promotion to a queen is colloquially called ''queening'', which is by far the most common type of piece a pawn is promoted to due to the relative power of a queen.

==Piece value==
{{Further|Chess piece relative value}}
Ordinarily, the queen is slightly stronger than a rook and a bishop together, while slightly less strong than two rooks, though there are exceptions. It is almost always disadvantageous to [[Exchange (chess)|exchange]] the queen for a single piece other than the enemy's queen.

The reason that the queen is stronger than a combination of a rook and bishop, even though they control the same number of squares, is twofold. First, the queen is more mobile than the rook and the bishop, as the entire power of the queen can be transferred to another location in one move, while transferring the entire firepower of a rook and bishop requires two moves, the bishop always being restricted to squares of one color. Second, the queen is not hampered by the bishop's inability to control squares of the opposite color to the square on which it stands. A factor in favor of the rook and bishop is that they can attack (or defend) a square twice, while a queen can only do so once. However, experience has shown that this factor is usually less significant than the points favoring the queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Larsen |first=Bent |title=Lærebok i sjakk |year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The queen is strongest when the board is open, when the enemy king is poorly defended, or when there are ''loose'' (i.e. undefended) pieces in the enemy camp. Because of her long range and ability to move in multiple directions, the queen is well equipped to execute [[Fork (chess)|forks]]. Compared to other long range pieces (i.e. rooks and bishops), the queen is less restricted and stronger in closed positions.

==Strategy==
Beginners often {{chessgloss|develop}} the queen early in the game, hoping to plunder the enemy position and deliver an early [[checkmate]] such as [[Scholar's mate]]. This can expose the easily harassed queen to attacks by weaker pieces causing the player to lose time. Experienced players generally prefer to delay developing the queen, and instead develop minor pieces in the [[chess opening|opening]].

Early queen attacks are rare in high level chess, but there are some openings with early queen development that are used by high level players. For example, the [[Scandinavian Defense]] (1.e4 d5), which often features queen moves by Black on the second and third moves is considered sound, and has been played at the world championship level. Some less common examples have also been observed in high-level games. The [[Danvers Opening]] (1.e4 e5 2.Qh5), which is widely characterized as a beginner's opening, has occasionally been played by the strong American [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] [[Hikaru Nakamura]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chessninja.com/dailydirt/2005/04/nakamuras-2qh5.htm |title=Nakamura's 2.Qh5 |date=2005-04-22 |publisher=ChessNinja.com |accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A queen exchange often marks the beginning of the [[chess endgame|endgame]], but there are [[Chess endgame#Queen and pawn endings|queen endgames]], and sometimes queens are exchanged in the opening, long before the endgame. A common goal in the endgame is to [[promotion (chess)|promote]] a pawn to a queen. As the queen has the largest range and mobility, queen and king vs. lone king is an easy win when compared to some other [[checkmate#Basic checkmates|basic mates]].

==Queen sacrifice==
{{main|Queen sacrifice}}
A ''queen [[Sacrifice (chess)|sacrifice]]'' is the deliberate sacrifice of a queen in order to gain a more favorable tactical position. One of the most widely known examples of this was in the game [[Immortal Game|Anderssen–Kieseritzky, 1851]], where [[Adolf Anderssen|Anderssen]] sacrificed a queen (along with three other pieces) to reach checkmate.

==History==
[[File:Cabinet des médailles, Paris - Ivory Chess Vizier, 12th Century.jpg|thumb|Vizier piece from a Southern Italian chess set, 12th century]]
The queen was originally the [[advisor|counsellor]] or [[prime minister]] or [[vizier]] ([[Sanskrit]] ''mantri'', Persian ''farzīn'', Arabic ''firzān'', ''firz'' or ''wazīr''). Initially its only move was one square diagonally. Around 1300 its move was enhanced to allow it to jump two squares diagonally (onto a same-colored square) for its first move.

The [[Ferz (chess)|''fers'']] changed into the queen over time. The first surviving mention of this piece as a queen or similar was &quot;regina&quot; in the Einsiedeln Poem, written in Latin around 997 and preserved in a monastery at [[Einsiedeln]] in Switzerland. Some surviving early medieval pieces depict the piece as a queen, and the word ''fers'' became grammatically feminized in several languages, for example ''alferza'' in Spanish and ''fierce'' or ''fierge'' in French,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcol|Yalom|2004|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; before it was replaced with names such as ''reine'' or ''dame'' (lady). The ''[[Carmina Burana]]'' also refer to the queen as ''femina'' (woman) and ''coniunx'' (spouse),&lt;ref name=&quot;Yalom2004&quot;&gt;{{harvcol|Yalom|2004|pp=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the name ''[[Amazons|Amazon]]'' has sometimes been seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcol|Yalom|2004|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russian it keeps its [[Persian language|Persian]] name of ''ferz''; ''koroleva'' (queen) is colloquial and is never used by professional chess players. However, the names ''korolevna'' (king's daughter), ''tsaritsa'' ([[tsar]]'s wife), and ''baba'' (old woman) are attested as early as 1694.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcol|Yalom|2004|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Arabic countries the queen remains termed, and in some cases depicted as a [[vizier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcol|Yalom|2004|p=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Marilyn Yalom]] proposes that the prominence of medieval queens such as [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] and [[Blanche of Castile]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]], the cult of the [[Virgin Mary]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Yalom2004&quot;/&gt; and the power ascribed to women in the [[troubadour]] tradition of [[courtly love]], might have been partly responsible for influencing the piece towards its identity as a queen and later its modern great power on the board, as might the medieval popularity of chess as a game particularly suitable for women to play on equal terms with men.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcol|Yalom|2004|pp=''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt; She points to medieval poetry depicting the Virgin as the chess-queen of God or ''Fierce Dieu''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcol|Yalom|2004|pp=112–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, the earliest surviving treatise to describe the modern movement of the queen (as well as the bishop and pawn), ''Repetición de amores e arte de axedres con CL iuegos de partido'' (''Discourses on Love and the Art of Chess with 150 Problems'') by [[Luis Ramírez de Lucena]], was published during the reign of [[Isabella I of Castile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcol|Yalom|2004|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even before that, the [[Valencian]] poem [[Scachs d'amor]] (&quot;Chess of Love&quot;) depicted a chess game between [[Francesc de Castellví]] and [[Narcís de Vinyoles]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1259987 |title=Francesco di Castellvi vs. Narciso Vinyoles, Valencia 1475 |website=[[Chessgames.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and commented on by [[Bernat Fenollar]], which clearly had the modern moves of the queen and the [[bishop (chess)|bishop]]. Well before the queen's powers expanded, it was already being romantically described as essential to the king's survival, so that when the queen was lost, there was nothing more of value on the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcol|Yalom|2004|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marilyn Yalom wrote that:
*The chess queen, rather than ferz or similar, is known of in what is now Spain and Portugal only from the 12th&amp;nbsp;century, but started sooner elsewhere.
*The modern move of the Queen started in Spain during Isabella I's reign, perhaps inspired by her great political power, and spread from there, perhaps being spread by the [[Printing#In Europe|invention of printing]] and the 1492 [[Expulsion of the Jews|Expulsion from Spain of the Jews]] who carried the new chess rule with them as they fled.

During the 15th century the queen's move took its modern form as a combination of the move of the [[rook (chess)|rook]] and the current move of the bishop.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcol|Davidson|1981|pp=13–14, 28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from Spain, this new version&amp;nbsp;– called &quot;queen's chess&quot; (in Italian, ''scacchi della donna''), or pejoratively &quot;madwoman's chess&quot; (''scacchi alla rabiosa'')&amp;nbsp;– spread throughout Europe rapidly, partly due to the advent of the printing press and the popularity of new books on chess.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcol|Yalom|2004|pp=214–216}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new rules faced a backlash in some quarters, ranging from anxiety over a powerful female warrior figure to frank abuse against women in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcol|Yalom|2004|pp=214–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At various times, the ability of pawns to be queened was restricted while the original queen was still on the board, so as not to cause scandal by providing the king with more than one queen. An early 12th-century Latin poem refers to a queened pawn as a ''ferzia'', as opposed to the original queen or ''regina'', to account for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcol|Yalom|2004|pp=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the queen was attacked, it was customary to warn the opponent by announcing &quot;''gardez la reine''&quot; or simply &quot;''gardez''&quot;, similar to the announcement of &quot;check&quot;. Some published rules even required this announcement before the queen could be legally captured. This custom was largely abandoned in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper &amp; Whyld (1996), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia for a long time the queen could also move like a knight; some players disapproved of this ability to &quot;gallop like the horse&quot; (knight).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vidahl.agava.ru/P240.HTM#41651 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=7 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111095017/http://vidahl.agava.ru/P240.HTM |archivedate=11 January 2012}} (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classes.ru/all-russian/russian-dictionary-Dal-term-41516.htm] (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''[[A History of Chess]]'' by  H.J.R. Murray, p. 384, says that [[William Coxe (historian)|William Coxe]] who was in Russia in 1772 saw chess played with the queen also moving like a knight. Such an augmented queen piece is now known as the [[fairy chess piece]] ''[[Amazon (chess)|amazon]]''.

Around 1230 the queen was also independently invented as a piece in Japan where it formed part of the game of [[dai shogi]], and was retained in its later form, the smaller [[chu shogi]].

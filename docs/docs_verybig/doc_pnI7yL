In Russian criminal slang, by contrast, a bitch (''suka'', pl. ''suki'' in Russian) is a person from the criminal world who has cooperated with [[law enforcement]] or the government. ''Suki'' were placed on the bottom of the prisoner hierarchy. As the definition of &quot;cooperation&quot; was not confined to snitching, but included any form of collaboration, [[World War II]] veterans returning to prison were declared ''suki'', leading to the post-WWII [[Bitch Wars]].

===Son of a bitch===
The first appearance of &quot;son-of-a-bitch&quot; in a work of fiction is ''Seventy-Six'' (1823), a [[historical fiction]] novel set during the [[American Revolutionary War]] by eccentric writer and critic [[John Neal (writer)|John Neal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sears | first = Donald A. | title = John Neal | publisher = Twayne Publishers | location = Boston, Massachusetts | year = 1978 | isbn = 080-5-7723-08 | page = 46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Barnes | first = Albert F. | title = Greater Portland Celebration 350 | publisher = Guy Gannett Publishing Co. | location = Portland, Maine | year = 1984 | isbn = 0-930096-58-4 | page = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protagonist, Jonathan Oadley, recounts a battle scene in which he is mounted on a horse: &quot;I wheeled, made a dead set at the son-of-a-bitch in my rear, unhorsed him, and actually broke through the line.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Neal | first = John | author-link=John Neal (writer) |title = Seventy-Six; or, Love and Battle | publisher = J.

The term's use as an insult is as old as that of ''bitch''. [[euphemism|Euphemistic]] terms are often substituted, such as ''gun'' in the phrase &quot;[[son of a gun]]&quot; as opposed to &quot;son of a bitch&quot;, or &quot;s.o.b.&quot; for the same phrase.  Like ''bitch'', the severity of the insult has diminished. [[Roy Blount, Jr.]] in 2008 extolled the virtues of &quot;son of a bitch&quot; (particularly in comparison to &quot;asshole&quot;) in common speech and deed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/son-of-a-bitch/sob-0708 |title=The Word Son of a Bitch - Epithets |magazine=Esquire |date=2008-06-18 |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Son of a bitch'' can also be used as a &quot;how about that&quot; reaction, or as a reaction to excruciating pain.

In politics the phrase &quot;Yes, he is a son of a bitch, but he is ''our'' son of a bitch&quot; has been attributed, probably apocryphally, to various U.S. presidents from [[Franklin Roosevelt]] to [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Son of a Bitch|url=https://arnulfo.wordpress.com/2013/08/28/our-son-of-a-bitch/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the detonation of the [[first atomic bomb]] in Alamogordo, [[New Mexico]], in July 1945 (the device codenamed Gadget), the [[Manhattan Project]] scientist who served as the director of the test, [[Kenneth Tompkins Bainbridge]], exclaimed to [[Robert Oppenheimer]] &quot;Now we're all sons-of-bitches.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Quotes by Kenneth Bainbridge|url=http://todayinsci.com/B/Bainbridge_Kenneth/BainbridgeKenneth-Quotations.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th-century British racehorse [[Filho da Puta]] took its name from 'Son of a bitch' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

The [[Curtiss SB2C]], a World War 2 U.S. Navy dive bomber, was called &quot;Son-of-a-Bitch 2nd Class&quot; by some of its pilots and crewmen.

===Bitch slap===
{{redirect|Bitch slap|the film|Bitch Slap}}
The term ''bitch slap'' is derived from American slang. In the original sense, a bitch slap is a powerful, full-swing slap in the face with the front of the hand, evoking the way an angry [[pimp]] might slap a defiant [[prostitution|prostitute]] (not to be confused with a [[pimp slap]] which uses the back of the hand). However, the term is now frequently used figuratively to describe a humiliating defeat or punishment.

===In cards===
To have the &quot;bitch end&quot; of a hand in poker is to have the weaker version of the same hand as another player. This situation occurs especially in poker games with [[community card]]s. For example, to have a lower straight than one's opponent is to have the bitch end.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

''The bitch'' is slang for the queen of spades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=New Jersey Free Poker |url=http://www.worldfreepoker.com/poker-glossary.html#B |title=Poker Glossary Poker Terms and Poker Definitions and Poker Meanings |publisher=Worldfreepoker.com |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other forms==
When used as a [[verb]], to bitch means to [[complain]]. Usage in this context is almost always [[pejorative]] in intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bitch Definition, www.dictionary.com | url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bitch | accessdate = 2008-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an adjective, the term sometimes has a meaning opposite its usual connotations. Something that is bitching (''the'' bitch) is really great. For example, an admired motorcycle may be praised as a &quot;bitchin' bike&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2009/01/northrop-unveil/ | work=Wired | first=Noah | last=Shachtman | title=Northrop Unveils Bitchin' Bomber-Cycle | date=2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equivalent words in other languages ==
A number of other languages, such as [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], and [[Slavic languages]] like [[Russian language|Russian]] use their word for ''female dog'' in the same vulgar manner ({{lang-sv|hynda|links=no}}, {{lang-ru|сука|links=no}} (romanized: {{lang|ru-Latn|súka}}), {{lang-hu|szuka|links=no}}), although they are not used as often as other words generally referring to [[prostitutes]].

'''Visby''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈvǐːsbʏ}}) is a [[urban areas in Sweden|locality]] and the seat of [[Gotland Municipality]] in [[Gotland County]], on the island of [[Gotland]], Sweden with 24,330 inhabitants, {{As of|2017|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name=Siffror /&gt; Visby is also the episcopal see for the [[Diocese of Visby]]. The [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] city of Visby is arguably the best-preserved [[Middle Ages|medieval]] city in [[Scandinavia]] and since 1995, it has been on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]] list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=21 World Heritage Sites you have probably never heard of|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/10999939/21-World-Heritage-Sites-you-have-probably-never-heard-of.html|newspaper=Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most notable historical remains are the {{convert|3.4|km|abbr=on|sing=on}} long [[Visby City Wall|town wall]] that encircles the town center, and a [[List of church ruins on Gotland|number of church ruins]].

Visby is a popular vacation destination for [[Scandinavia]]ns during the summer and receives thousands of tourists every year. It is by far the most populated locality outside the Swedish mainland. The [[Campus Gotland|Gotland University]] is in Visby, and since 1{{nbsp}}July 2013, it is a department of [[Uppsala University]] under the name Uppsala University–Campus Gotland. Visby is also the sole county seat in Sweden accessible from the mainland only by boat and air.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Visby&quot; comes from the [[Old Norse]] ''Vis'', ([[genitive case|genitive]] singular of ''Vi'') meaning &quot;(pagan) place of sacrifices&quot;, and ''by'', meaning &quot;village&quot;. In the [[Gutasaga]]n (mid 14th century) the place is referred to as just ''Wi'' meaning &quot;holy place, place of worship&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nationalencyklopedin]], article &quot;Visby&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Visby is sometimes called &quot;The City of Roses&quot; or &quot;The City of Ruins&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Visby innerstad&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Visby innerstad|url=http://www.gotland.net/start/visby-innerstad|website=www.gotland.net|publisher=Visit Gotland|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cercurius AB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Smeknamn och öknamn på svenska städer|url=http://www.cercurius.se/ordlistor/smeknamnsvenskastader.htm|website=www.cercurius.se|publisher=Cercurius AB|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Expressen&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.expressen.se/debatt/rosornas-stads-mest-urvattnade-tradition/ |newspaper=[[Expressen]] |title=Rosornas stads mest urvattnade tradition |last1=Blom |first1=Ewdward |date=2 July 2013 |accessdate=15 June 2014 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The earliest history of Visby is uncertain, but it is known to have been a centre of merchandise around 900&amp;nbsp;AD. It was inhabited as early as the [[Stone Age]], probably because of the access to fresh water and a [[Harbor|natural harbour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Westholm |first=Gun |title=Visby och Gotland – Medeltida byggnadsutveckling. |date=2000 |journal=Gotländskt Arkiv |volume=2000 |issue=72 |location=Visby |publisher=Gotlands fornsal |page=85 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 12th century, [[Visby Cathedral]], dedicated to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Saint Mary]], was constructed. It was reshaped in the 13th century to its current appearance, and was officially opened in 1225, by the bishop of the Swedish city of [[Linköping]] (''in regional map''). Several other churches were also constructed in the ensuing centuries. The city flourished, thanks to the German [[Hanseatic League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yrwing |first1=Hugo |title= Visby – hansestad på Gotland |date=1986 |publisher= Gidlund |location=Stockholm |language=Swedish |isbn=91-7844-055-6 |url= http://libris.kb.se/bib/7668452 |accessdate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work on the [[Visby City Wall|ring wall]] was likely begun in the 12th century. Around 1300, it was rebuilt to reach its current height, acquiring the characteristic towers, although some towers were not constructed until the 15th century. The ringwall is still largely intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Andrén |first1=Anders |title=Det medeltida Gotland: en arkeologisk guidebok |date=2011 |publisher=Historiska media |location=Lund |isbn=978-91-85873-83-8 |url=http://libris.kb.se/bib/12028545 |accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the fourteenth century (1300–1350) Visby was at the height of its wealth and influence, and it was during this time that [[Laws of Wisbuy]], a set of maritime laws that had broad influence in the Baltic and beyond, were probably promulgated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stone |first=Arthur J. |date=October 1842 |title=Canada's Admiralty Court in the Twentieth Century |url=http://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/userfiles/other/2324371-47.3.Stone.pdf |journal=McGill Law Journal |volume=47 |pages=511–558 |doi= |access-date=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1361, Gotland was [[Battle of Visby|conquered]] by [[Valdemar IV of Denmark]]. 1,800 Gotlanders were killed in battle in front of the city. Valdemar tore down part of the wall, set up three huge beer barrels and threatened to turn his men loose to pillage the town unless they were filled with silver and gold. The Visby city fathers fulfilled the demand, with churches stripped of their valuables. Valdemar added &quot;King of Gotland&quot; to his title list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Westholm |first1=Gun |title=Visby 1361: Invasionen |date=2007 |publisher=Prisma |language=Swedish |location=Stockholm |isbn=978-91-518-4568-5 |url=http://libris.kb.se/bib/10415688 |accessdate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His treatment of Visby, a member of the Hanseatic League, precipitated that League into war with Denmark; however, though Valdemar was forced into various concessions, he retained Visby as a Danish city.&lt;ref name=Tacitus&gt;{{cite web |last1=Martinsson |first1=Örjan |title=Gotland |url=http://www.tacitus.nu/svenskhistoria/land/gotland.htm |website=www.tacitus.nu |publisher=TACITUS.NU |accessdate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1391, 1394 and 1398, it was taken and plundered by the [[Victual Brothers]], pirates who sailed the [[Baltic Sea]]. An invading army of [[Teutonic Knights]] conquered Gotland in 1398, destroyed Visby and expelled the Victual Brothers.&lt;ref name=Tacitus /&gt; In 1409, Grand Master [[Ulrich von Jungingen]] of the Teutonic Knights guaranteed peace with the [[Kalmar Union]] of [[Scandinavia]] by selling the island of Gotland to Queen [[Margaret I of Denmark|Margaret of Denmark, Norway and Sweden]].&lt;ref name=Tacitus /&gt;

In 1411, the Norwegian, Danish and Swedish King [[Eric of Pomerania]] had the castle of [[Visborg]] constructed, and settled himself there for twelve years, during which the city virtually became a pirates' nest, and the commerce halted. As of 1470, the Hanseatic League rescinded Visby's status as a Hanseatic town.&lt;ref name=Tacitus /&gt;

In 1525, the final blow came. In the Danish throne quarrel, [[Free City of Lübeck|Lübeck]], a [[Free imperial city|Free City]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and a leading member of the Hanseatic League, supported [[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederick I]], while [[Søren Norby]] the Danish governor of Gotland fought for [[Christian II of Denmark|Christian II]], even after Christian's official resignation in 1523. While Norby fought a military action in Sweden, the Lübeckers successfully attacked Visby and set the city on fire from four sites. But unlike widespread belief, several churches survived at first. The churches of St. James (which already had been closed before), St. Nicholas and St. Gertrude were sacked by Lübeck's army. With the reformation, all churches except St. John, which became the city parish, were closed. In 1528, the citizens of Visby sacked the church of the Holy Trinity, or the church of Our Lord ({{lang-sv|Drottens kyrka}}) in revenge for the plundering of their town. In 1533–34, the new Danish governor, {{Interlanguage link multi|Henrik Nielsen Rosenkrantz|da}}, demolished St. John's and St. Peter's churches to improve the defence of his castle Visborgs slott. [[Visby Cathedral|St. Mary's Cathedral]] remained the last functional church and became the new city parish.&lt;ref name=Tacitus /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slottsguiden.info/slottdetalj.asp?id=165 Slottsguiden, ''S:ta Karin, Sverige'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slottsguiden.info/slottdetalj.asp?id=169 Slottsguiden, ''S:t Per och S:t Hans, Sverige'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Gotland was again taken into Sweden's possession in 1645, by the [[Second Treaty of Brömsebro (1645)|Treaty of Brömsebro]], after 300&amp;nbsp;years of Danish rule.&lt;ref name=Tacitus /&gt; The city developed slowly as things were left as they were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Englund |first=Peter |title=Ofredsår |publisher=Atlantis |location=Stockholm |year=2003 |pages=368 and 394 |isbn=91-7486-349-5 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid 18th century, [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|after a plague had reduced]] Visby's population, some attempts were made by Swedish government officials to improve living standards, but little was accomplished. Not until the early 19th century did Visby once again attract commerce and a harbour industry. At the same time – 1808 – Gotland was conquered by Russia, but was peacefully taken back by the Swedes after only a couple of months.&lt;ref name=Tacitus /&gt;

Visby is the name of the locality, or town, as well as the name of the larger area surrounding it, Visby [[socken]]. In 1936, the socken was incorporated within the newly formed Visby stad (Visby city), the only locality with historical [[Stad (Sweden)|city status]] on Gotland. Visby socken comprises the same area as the [[Registration districts in Sweden|administrative]] Visby District, established on 1{{nbsp}}January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Förordning om district|trans-title=Regulation of districts|url=http://rkrattsdb.gov.se/SFSdoc/15/150493.PDF|date=17 June 2015|publisher=[[Ministry of Finance (Sweden)|Ministry of Finance]]|accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The exact extent of the old socken, now district, can be obtained by clicking on ''Kartinställningar'' and check the ''Socken'' box in the menu of [http://www.fmis.raa.se/cocoon/fornsok/search.html?parish=976&amp;tab=2&amp;page=1 this map] from the [[Swedish National Heritage Board]] database.&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2019}}, [[Visby Cathedral]], [[List of churches on Gotland#V-Ö|Visborg Church]] and [[List of churches on Gotland#S-T|Terra Nova Church]] in Visby belong to Visby Cathedral [[Parishes of the Church of Sweden|parish]] (''Visby Domkyrkoförsamling'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Församlingar på Gotland |url=https://www.svenskakyrkan.se/visbystift/f |website=www.svenskakyrkan.se |publisher=[[Church of Sweden]] |accessdate=13 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Visby stifts indelning 2018 |url=https://www.svenskakyrkan.se/default.aspx?id=1714164 |website=www.svenskakyrkan.se |publisher=[[Church of Sweden]] |accessdate=13 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visby is also the only municipality seat of Sweden that is accessible from the mainland only by boat and air traffic.

Visby is situated on the central west coast of Gotland, on the rather steep slopes of [[limestone]] cliffs surrounding the first natural harbor. The town has evolved around the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] harbor that now constitutes the [[Almedalen]] park. Long streets run parallel with the old shoreline with shorter alleys at a straight angle from these, lead from the harbor and up the slope up to the eastern higher part of town known as ''Klinten''.&lt;ref name=ne&gt;{{cite web|title=Visby|url=http://www.ne.se/uppslagsverk/encyklopedi/lång/visby|website=www.ne.se|publisher=[[Nationalencyklopedin]]|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The old, original part of Visby is more or less enclosed by the city wall to the north, east and south, with the old harbor and the Baltic Sea in the west. The more modern parts of the town expand mostly east and inland from the wall. Along the shore south of the wall is the modern harbor with its ferry terminals and further south is a green recreational area called Södra Hällarna. Just inside the north part of the wall as well as along the north coast outside the wall, are several beaches: Kallbadhuset, Norderstrand, Snäckgärdsbaden (or simply Snäck) and [[Gustavsvik, Gotland|Gustavsvik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Välkomna till Visby!|trans-title=Welcome to Visby!|url=http://www.gotland.net/se-och-gora/arkiv/valkomna-till-visby|website=www.gotland.net|publisher=Gotlands Media AB|date=23 April 2014|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visby and [[Tallinn]] are the only two North-European towns in which the city's medieval [[grid plan]] has been fully preserved into present day.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

One of the [[asteroid]]s in the [[asteroid belt]], [[6102 Visby]], is [[List of Gotland related asteroids|named]] after this place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=6102|title=6102 Visby (1993 FQ25)|accessdate=24 June 2016|publisher=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate ==
According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], Visby has an [[oceanic climate]]. This renders the summers cooler and the winters milder than in most of mainland Sweden. However, in spite of its maritime location the city's climate is very much influenced by continental airflows. Precipitation amounts are quite moderate, especially for an oceanic climate, and relatively consistent throughout the year.

Visby is linked to the mainland of Sweden by ferry and by plane. Ferries arrive from both [[Oskarshamn]] in [[Småland]] and [[Nynäshamn]], near [[Stockholm]], each taking about three hours. The ferries are run by [[Destination Gotland]] and subsidized by the Swedish government.&lt;ref name=&quot;travel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Resa till och på Gotland|trans-title=Travel to and on Gotland|url=http://gotland.com/besoka/bra-att-veta/resa-till-och-pa-gotland/|website=www.gotland.com|publisher=Inspiration Gotland|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Destination Gotland is the only ferry operator – in summer 2016, independent shipping company Gotlandsbåten ran ferries to [[Västervik]] and Nynäshamn,&lt;ref name=&quot;ferry&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Widegren|first1=Patrik|title=Efter motgångar: Ny färja till Gotland i sommar|trans-title=After setbacks: New ferry to Gotland this summer|url=http://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/ost/nytt-forsok-for-gotlandsbaten|website=www.svt.se|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|accessdate=6 July 2016|date=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this service was unprofitable and was not repeated in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=86&amp;artikel=6925377 |title=Gotlandsbåten avregistreras – inga nya planer |date=6 April 2018 |work=P4 Kalmar |access-date=17 August 2018 |publisher=[[Sveriges Radio]] |language=Swedish |trans-title=Gotlandsbåten deregistered – no new plans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also city buses in Visby as well as buses to other parts of Gotland.&lt;ref name=&quot;bus&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wesley|first1=Stefan|title=Kollektivtrafik|trans-title=Public transport|date=1 July 2016|url=http://www.gotland.se/kollektivtrafiken|website=www.gotland.se|publisher=[[Gotland Municipality]]|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visby gave its name to the 1968 Visby Amendments, which were an amendment of the Hague Rules of [[Admiralty law|shipping law]], leading to the [[Hague–Visby Rules]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wanigasekera|first1=Anomi|title=Comparison of Hauge-Visby and Hamburg rules|url=http://www.juliusandcreasy.com/inpages/publications/pdf/comparison_of_hague_and_hamburg-AW.pdf|website=www.juliusandcreasy.com|publisher=Julius &amp; Creasy|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visby was previously served by two railway lines, the {{ill|Gotland Railway|lt=Gotland Railway|sv|Gotlands Järnväg}} which ran from Lärbro in the north, to Burgsvik in the south, via Visby harbour and the {{ill|Visby – Visborgsslätt – Bjärs Railway |lt=Visby–Visborgsslätt–Bjärs Railway|sv|Visby–Visborgsslätt–Bjärs Järnväg}}, south to Visborgsslätt and Västerhejde. The first line, from Visby to Hemse was started in 1878, under the auspices of the Gotland Railway. Passenger transport was discontinued in September 1960. Freight traffic on the Slakteriet – Visby port route ran until May 1962. The last sections of the port track in Visby were removed in March 1964. Visby railway station, just south of the Söderport on Söderväg, was completed in 1878 and is one of the few remaining vestiges of the railway in Visby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ragnar|first=Martin|url=http://www.gotlandstaget.se/historia/gj.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822075643/http://www.gotlandstaget.se/historia/gj.htm|title=Gotlands Järnväg – GJ 1878–1960|language=Swedish|website=www.Gotlandstaget.se|archive-date=22 August 2011|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

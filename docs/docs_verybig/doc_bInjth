It was thought that after Kenna stepped down the 1st Ward would be moved south and the Loop would be divided across multiple wards.{{sfn|Wendt|Kogan|p=358|ps=none}} Upon redistricting in 1948, the 1st Ward was combined with the erstwhile &quot;Bloody 20th&quot; Ward across the [[Chicago River]]'s south branch.&lt;ref name=&quot;1st ward redistrict&quot;/&gt; The 1st Ward committeemen of both parties resigned in favor of their counterparts of the old 20th Ward, largely due to the fact that the old 20th could have outvoted the old 1st.&lt;ref name=&quot;1st ward redistrict&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gentry |first1=Guy |title=Hot contests expected for jobs in wards |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/195810398/ |url-access=subscription |accessdate=June 4, 2019 |work=Chicago Tribune |issue=Part 3 |page=2 |date=January 18, 1948 |via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the 1st Ward's reputation would last long after Kenna's death; by the 1980s it was well associated with organized crime.{{sfn|Fremon|p=25|ps=none}} In 1991 allies of Mayor [[Richard M. Daley]] proposed, and the City Council approved, a redistricting that renumbered much of the 1st Ward as the 42nd Ward at the request of businesses in the area, who felt that the 1st Ward had gained too much of a negative connotation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Remap&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kass |first1=John |title=Remap imperils City Council vets |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/389641764/ |url-access=subscription |accessdate=13 April 2020 |work=Chicago Tribune |volume=145 |issue=302 |p=1 |date=October 29, 1991 |via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2019}} the 42nd Ward alderman is [[Brendan Reilly (politician)|Brendan Reilly]] and the 1st Ward alderman is [[Daniel La Spata]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward list&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Wards |url=https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/about/wards.html |publisher=City of Chicago |accessdate=21 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last surviving link to Kenna and Coughlin was Anthony C. Laurino, who served as an assistant precinct captain under their tutelage{{sfn|Fremon|p=254|ps=none}} and would later serve as alderman of the 39th Ward from 1965 to 1994, dying in 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laurino Obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Struzzi |first1=Diane |last2=Washburn |first2=Gary |title=Anthony C.

David K. Fremon argues in his book ''Chicago Politics Ward by Ward'' that while Coughlin and Kenna &quot;are generally viewed as living cartoon characters[,]... both were astute men in their time. Were they to appear today [in 1988], they would probably have made their fortunes through law, insurance, or real estate[.]&quot;{{sfn|Fremon|p=25|ps=none}} Reflecting on their tenure, reformer [[Paul Douglas]] noted:
{{Quote|Here were two men of the people who rose to power not merely by brawn and self-assertiveness but also by acting as the very human friends of people in poverty and trouble. They fed the hungry and got jobs for the unemployed. They protected those in trouble with the law. In return, like the ''[[condottieri]]'' of the medieval cities, they demanded and obtained loyalty and obedience. ... Can [reformers] meet the human needs which the blundering Bath and the Shrewd Hink served, and do so without the corruption that they practiced?{{sfn|Wendt|Kogan|pp=vii &amp; xiv|ps=none}}}}

A 2012 retrospective by NBC News Chicago ranked Kenna and Coughlin as the 3rd and 4th most corrupt public officials in Illinois history, behind Thompson and Illinois Secretary of State [[Paul Powell (politician)|Paul Powell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NBC Chicago&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=McClelland |first1=Edward |title=The 12 Most Corrupt Public Officials in Illinois History: The Complete List |url=https://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/ward-room/The-12-Most-Corrupt-Public-Officials-In-Illinois-History-Michael-Hinky-Dink-Kenna-and-Bathhouse-John-Coughlin-137683963.html |website=NBC Chicago |accessdate=March 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luise Adelgunde Victorie Gottsched''' (born '''Kulmus''', 11 April 1713 – 26 June 1762) was a [[Germany|German]] [[poet]], [[playwright]], [[essayist]], and [[Translation|translator]],&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Brown, ''Luise Gottsched the Translator'' (Camden House, 2012, {{ISBN|9781571135100}})&lt;/ref&gt; and is often considered one of the founders of modern German [[theatrical comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tb5bT5WrT6EC&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;ots=gutNu47dN1&amp;dq=Luise%20Gottsched%20comedy&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q=Luise%20Gottsched%20comedy&amp;f=false|title=German Literature of the Eighteenth Century: The Enlightenment and Sensibility|last=Becker-Cantarino|first=Barbara|date=2005-01-01|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn=9781571132468|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
She was born in Danzig ([[Gdańsk]]), [[Royal Prussia]] ([[Crown of Poland]]). During her lifetime, she was considered one of [[Europe]]'s leading intellects and one of the most intelligent women of the time. 

She became acquainted with her husband, the poet and author [[Johann Christoph Gottsched]], when she sent him some of her own works. He apparently was impressed, and a long correspondence eventually led to marriage. After marriage, Luise continued to write and publish&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Luise K.

'''Robert Bernard Altman''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔː|l|t|m|ə|n}}; February 20, 1925 – November 20, 2006) was an American film director, screenwriter, and producer. Altman is known as five-time nominee of the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] and an enduring figure from the [[New Hollywood]] era, comparable to such directors as [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Woody Allen]], [[Sidney Lumet]] and [[David Lynch]]. Altman was considered a &quot;maverick&quot; in making [[Cinema of the United States|films]] with a highly naturalistic but stylized and satirical aesthetic, unlike most Hollywood films. He is consistently ranked as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in American cinema.

His style of filmmaking covered many genres, but usually with a &quot;[[subversion|subversive]]&quot; twist which typically relied on satire and humor to express his personal views. Altman developed a reputation for being &quot;anti-Hollywood&quot; and non-conformist in both his themes and directing style. However, actors especially enjoyed working under his direction because he encouraged them to improvise, thereby inspiring their own creativity.

He preferred large [[ensemble cast]]s for his films, and developed a multitrack recording technique which produced overlapping dialogue from multiple actors. This produced a more natural, more dynamic, and more complex experience for the viewer. He also used highly mobile camera work and zoom lenses to enhance the activity taking place on the screen. Critic [[Pauline Kael]], writing about his directing style, said that Altman could &quot;make film fireworks out of next to nothing.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wakeman /&gt; Altman's most famous directorial achievements include ''[[M*A*S*H (film)|M*A*S*H]]'' (1970), ''[[McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975), ''[[3 Women]]'' (1977), ''[[Secret Honor]]'' (1984), ''[[The Player (1992 film)|The Player]]'' (1992), ''[[Short Cuts]]'' (1993), and ''[[Gosford Park]]'' (2001).

In 2006, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] recognized Altman's body of work with an [[Academy Honorary Award]]. He never won a competitive Oscar despite seven nominations. His films ''[[M*A*S*H (film)|M*A*S*H]]'' (1970), ''[[McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), and ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975) have been selected for the United States [[National Film Registry]]. Altman is one of three filmmakers whose films have won the [[Golden Bear]] at [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin]], the [[Golden Lion]] at [[Venice Film Festival|Venice]], and the [[Palme d'Or|Golden Palm]] at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] (the other two being [[Henri-Georges Clouzot]], and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]).

== Early life and career ==
Altman was born on February 20, 1925, in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], the son of Helen (née Matthews), a ''[[Mayflower]]'' descendant from [[Nebraska]], and Bernard Clement Altman, a wealthy insurance salesman and amateur gambler, who came from an upper-class family. Altman's ancestry was German, English and Irish;&lt;ref name=&quot;altman3&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Lemons |first=Stephen |title=Robert Altman |page=2 |work=Salon.com |url=http://archive.salon.com/people/bc/2000/08/15/altman/index.html |accessdate=November 22, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208024334/http://archive.salon.com/people/bc/2000/08/15/altman/index.html |archivedate=December 8, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;altman1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=The Daily Telegraph |title=Robert Altman, 81, Mercurial Director of Masterworks and Flops |newspaper=The New York Sun |date=November 22, 2006 |url=http://www.nysun.com/article/44018 |accessdate=November 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; his paternal grandfather, Frank Altman, Sr., anglicized the spelling of the family name from &quot;Altmann&quot; to &quot;Altman&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;altman1&quot; /&gt; Altman had a Catholic upbringing,&lt;ref name=&quot;altman2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The Religious Affiliation of Robert Altman |publisher=Adherents.com |date=July 28, 2005 |url =http://www.adherents.com/people/pa/Robert_Altman.html |accessdate=November 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but he did not continue to follow or practice the religion as an adult,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/may/01/features.weekend &quot;Interview: Robert Altman&quot;], ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt; although he has been referred to as &quot;a sort of Catholic&quot; and a Catholic director.&lt;ref name=&quot;altman2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholichistory.net/Spotlights/SpotlightMovies.htm |title=Spotlight: Catholics at the Movies |publisher=Catholichistory.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Jesuit]] schools, including [[Rockhurst High School]], in Kansas City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Butler, Robert W. |date=March 5, 2006 |title=Finally, An Attitude Adjustment: Hollywood's Establishment Now Embraces Rebel Director Altman |newspaper=[[The Kansas City Star]] |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Wentworth Military Academy]] in [[Lexington, Missouri]] in 1943.

In 1943, Altman joined the [[United States Army Air Forces]] at the age of 18. During [[World War II]], Altman flew more than 50 bombing missions as a crewman on a [[B-24 Liberator]] with the 307th Bomb Group in [[Borneo]] and the [[Dutch East Indies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;altm&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2011 |url=http://www.b24bestweb.com/b24bestweb-Famous.htm|title = Famous B-24/PB4Y Crew Members |publisher=B-24 Best Web |accessdate=July 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his discharge in 1946, Altman moved to California. He worked in publicity for a company that had invented a [[tattoo]]ing machine to identify dogs. He entered filmmaking on a whim, selling a script to [[RKO]] for the 1948 picture ''[[Bodyguard (1948 film)|Bodyguard]]'', which he co-wrote with George W. George. Altman's immediate success encouraged him to move to [[New York City]], where he attempted to forge a career as a writer. Having enjoyed little success, in 1949 he returned to Kansas City, where he accepted a job as a director and writer of industrial films for the [[Calvin Company]]. In February 2012, an early Calvin film directed by Altman, ''Modern Football'' (1951), was found by filmmaker Gary Huggins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/popcandy/post/2012/03/fan-uncovers-robert-altmans-first-film/1 |title=Fan uncovers Robert Altman's first film |publisher=Content.usatoday.com |date=2012-03-14 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobcook/2012/03/13/robert-altmans-lost-classic-modern-football/ |title=Robert Altman's Lost Classic: 'Modern Football' |magazine=Forbes |date=2012-03-13 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altman directed some 65 industrial films and documentaries before being hired by a local businessman in 1956 to write and direct a feature film in Kansas City on [[juvenile delinquency]]. The film, titled ''[[The Delinquents (1957 film)|The Delinquents]]'', made for $60,000, was purchased by [[United Artists]] for $150,000, and released in 1957. While primitive, this teen [[exploitation film]] contained the foundations of Altman's later work in its use of casual, naturalistic dialogue. With its success, Altman moved from Kansas City to California for the last time. He co-directed ''[[The James Dean Story]]'' (1957), a documentary rushed into theaters to capitalize on the actor's recent death and marketed to his emerging cult following.

== 1950s ==
Altman's first forays into TV directing were on the [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] drama series ''[[Pulse of the City]]'' (1953–1954), and an episode of the 1956 western series ''[[The Sheriff of Cochise]]''. After [[Alfred Hitchcock]] saw Altman's early features ''The Delinquents'' and ''The James Dean Story'', he hired him as a director for his [[CBS]] anthology series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''. After just two episodes, Altman resigned due to differences with a producer, but this exposure enabled him to forge a successful TV career. Over the next decade Altman worked prolifically in television (and almost exclusively in series dramas) directing multiple episodes of ''[[Whirlybirds]]'', ''[[The Millionaire (TV series)|The Millionaire]]'', ''[[U.S. Marshal (TV series)|U.S. Marshal]]'', ''[[The Troubleshooters (1959 TV series)|The Troubleshooters]]'', ''[[The Roaring 20s (TV series)|The Roaring 20s]]'', ''[[Bonanza]]'', ''[[Bus Stop (TV series)|Bus Stop]]'', ''[[Kraft Mystery Theater]]'',  ''[[Combat!]]'', as well as single episodes of several other notable series including ''[[Hawaiian Eye]]'', ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (the fourth season episode [[List of Maverick episodes|&quot;Bolt From the Blue&quot;]] also written by Altman and starring [[Roger Moore]]), ''[[Lawman (TV series)|Lawman]]'', ''[[Surfside 6]]'', ''[[Peter Gunn]]'', and ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]''.

===1960s===
Through this early work on industrial films and TV series, Altman experimented with narrative technique and developed his characteristic use of overlapping dialogue. He also learned to work quickly and efficiently on a limited budget. Though he was frequently fired from TV projects for refusing to conform to network mandates, as well as insisting on expressing political subtexts and antiwar sentiments during the Vietnam years, Altman always was able to land new assignments. In 1964, the producers decided to expand &quot;Once Upon a Savage Night&quot;, one of his episodes of ''[[Kraft Suspense Theatre]]'', for release as a TV movie under the title ''[[Nightmare in Chicago]]''.

Two years later, Altman was hired to direct the low-budget space travel feature ''[[Countdown (1968 film)|Countdown]]'', but was fired within days of the project's conclusion because he had refused to edit the film to a manageable length. He did not direct another film until ''[[That Cold Day in the Park]]'' (1969), which was a critical and box-office disaster.

===1970s===

In 1969, Altman was offered the script for ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'', an adaptation of a little-known [[Korean War]]-era novel satirizing life in the armed services; more than a dozen other filmmakers had passed on it. Altman had been hesitant to take the production, and the shoot was so tumultuous that [[Elliott Gould]] and [[Donald Sutherland]] tried to have Altman fired over his unorthodox filming methods. Nevertheless, ''MASH'' was widely hailed as an immediate classic upon its 1970 release. It won the ''[[Palme d'Or]]'' at the 1970 [[Cannes Film Festival]] and netted five [[Academy Award]] nominations. It was Altman's highest-grossing film, released during a time of increasing anti-war sentiment in the United States. The [[Academy Film Archive]] preserved ''MASH'' in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preserved Projects|url=http://www.oscars.org/academy-film-archive/preserved-projects?title=M*A*S*H&amp;filmmaker=&amp;category=All&amp;collection=All|website=Academy Film Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now recognized as a major talent, Altman notched critical successes with ''[[McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), a [[Revisionist Western]] in which the mordant songs of [[Leonard Cohen]] underscore a gritty vision of the American frontier; ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), a controversial adaptation of the [[Raymond Chandler]] novel (scripted by [[Leigh Brackett]]) now ranked as a seminal influence on the [[neo-noir]] subgenre; ''[[Thieves Like Us (film)|Thieves Like Us]]'' (1974), an adaptation of the Edward Anderson novel previously filmed by [[Nicholas Ray]] as ''[[They Live by Night]]'' (1949); ''[[California Split]]'' (1974), a gambling comedy-drama shot partially on location in [[Reno, Nevada]]; and ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975), which had a strong political theme set against the world of [[country music]]. The stars of the film wrote their own songs; [[Keith Carradine]] won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for the song &quot;[[I'm Easy (Keith Carradine song)|I'm Easy]]&quot;. Although his films were often met with divisive notices, many of the prominent film critics of the era (including [[Pauline Kael]], [[Vincent Canby]] and [[Roger Ebert]]) remained steadfastly loyal to his oeuvre throughout the decade.

Audiences took some time to appreciate his films, and he did not want to have to satisfy studio officials. In 1970, following the release of ''MASH,'' he founded Lion's Gate Films to have independent production freedom. Altman's company is not to be confused with the current [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]], a Canada/U.S. entertainment company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cook |first=David A. |date=2000 |title=Lost Illusions: American Cinema in the Shadow of Watergate and Vietnam, 1970–1979 |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-23265-8 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; The films he made through his company included ''[[Brewster McCloud]]'', ''[[A Wedding (1978 film)|A Wedding]]'', ''[[3 Women]]'', and ''[[Quintet (film)|Quintet]]''.

===1980s ===

In 1980, he directed the musical film ''[[Popeye (film)|Popeye]]''. Produced by [[Robert Evans (film producer)|Robert Evans]] and written by [[Jules Feiffer]], the film was based on the comic strip / cartoon [[Popeye|of the same name]] and starred the comedian [[Robin Williams]] in his film debut. Designed as a vehicle to increase Altman's commercial clout following a series of critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful low-budget films in the late 1970s (including ''3&amp;nbsp;Women'', ''A&amp;nbsp;Wedding'' and ''Quintet''), the production was filmed on location in [[Malta]]. It was soon beleaguered by heavy drug and alcohol use among most of the cast and crew, including the director; Altman reportedly clashed with Evans, Williams (who threatened to leave the film), and songwriter [[Harry Nilsson]] (who departed midway through the shoot, leaving [[Van Dyke Parks]] to finish the orchestrations). Although the film grossed $60&amp;nbsp;million worldwide on a $20&amp;nbsp;million budget and was the second highest-grossing film Altman had directed to that point, it failed to meet studio expectations and was considered a box office disappointment.

In 1981, the director sold Lion's Gate to producer [[Jonathan Taplin]] after his political satire ''[[Health (film)|Health]]'' (shot in early 1979 for a Christmas release) was shelved by longtime distributor [[20th Century Fox]] following tepid test and festival screenings throughout 1980. The departure of longtime Altman partisan [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]] from Fox also played a decisive role in forestalling the release of the film.

Unable to secure major financing in the post-New Hollywood [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] era because of his mercurial reputation and the particularly tumultuous events surrounding the production of ''Popeye'', Altman began to &quot;direct literate dramatic properties on shoestring budgets for stage, home video, television, and limited theatrical release,&quot; including the acclaimed ''[[Secret Honor]]'' and ''[[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (film)|Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean]]'', a critically antipodean adaptation of a play that Altman had directed on Broadway.&lt;ref name=McGilligan&gt;{{cite book |author=McGilligan, Patrick |title=Robert Altman: Jumping off the cliff |publisher=Macmillan |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=115}}

In 1982, Altman staged a production of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'' at the [[University of Michigan]], where he concurrently taught a course on his films. Shortly thereafter, he returned to film ''Secret Honor'' with students. In 2008, the University of Michigan Library acquired Altman's archive.&lt;ref name=ManyHatsUMich&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lib.umich.edu/online-exhibits/exhibits/show/altman/opera-and-the-university-of-mi |title=Altman at the University of Michigan |publisher=[[University of Michigan]] |series=The many hats of Robert Altman: A life in cinema |type=online exhibit}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also co-wrote [[John Anderson (musician)|John Anderson]]'s 1983 hit single &quot;[[Black Sheep (John Anderson song)|Black Sheep]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1546370/nashville-director-robert-altman-dies.jhtml |title=Nashville director Robert Altman dies |date=21 November 2006 |work=[[Country Music Television]] |accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[teen comedy]] ''[[O.C. and Stiggs]]'' (1985), an abortive return to Hollywood filmmaking retrospectively characterized by the [[British Film Institute]] as &quot;probably Altman's least successful film&quot;, received a belated limited commercial release in 1987 after being shelved by [[MGM]].

Adapted by Altman and [[Sam Shepard]] for [[The Cannon Group]] from the latter's [[Pulitzer Prize]]-nominated play, ''[[Fool for Love (film)|Fool for Love]]'' (1985) featured the playwright-actor alongside [[Kim Basinger]], [[Harry Dean Stanton]], and [[Randy Quaid]]; it fared better than most of his films from the era, earning $900,000 domestically on a $2&amp;nbsp;million budget and positive reviews from [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Vincent Canby]]. Still, widespread popularity with audiences continued to elude him.

He continued to regain a modicum of critical favor for his television [[mockumentary]] ''[[Tanner '88]]'' (1988), a collaboration with [[Garry Trudeau]] set in the milieu of a United States presidential campaign, for which he earned a [[Primetime Emmy Award]].

===1990s===
In 1990, Altman directed ''[[Vincent &amp; Theo]]'', a [[biopic]] about [[Vincent van Gogh]] that was intended as a television miniseries for broadcast in the United Kingdom. A theatrical version of the film was a modest success in the United States, marking a significant turning point in the director's critical resurgence.{{efn|Powerfully realized study of [[Vincent van Gogh]] and his brother Theo marks a return to the mainstream arena for director Robert Altman.

But Altman actually reclaimed his &quot;critics' darling&quot; status two years earlier with ''[[Vincent &amp; Theo]]'', a luminous biopic about painter Vincent Van Gogh (played by Tim Roth) and his art-dealer brother (Paul Rhys).&lt;ref name=Murray&gt;{{cite web |last=Murray |first=Noel |title=Vincent &amp; Theo |date=March 30, 2015 |work=[[The Dissolve]] |url=http://thedissolve.com/reviews/1475-vincent-theo/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407084439/http://thedissolve.com/reviews/1475-vincent-theo/ |archivedate=2016-04-07 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Robert Altman Cannes.jpg|thumb|upright|Altman at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival]]
He revitalized his career in earnest with ''[[The Player (1992 film)|The Player]]'' (1992), a satire of Hollywood. Co-produced by the influential [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]] (''[[The Sting]]'', ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', ''[[Cocoon (film)|Cocoon]]''), the film was nominated for three Academy Awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. While he did not win the Oscar, he was awarded Best Director by the [[Cannes Film Festival]], [[BAFTA]], and the [[New York Film Critics Circle]].

Altman then directed ''[[Short Cuts (film)|Short Cuts]]'' (1993), an ambitious adaptation of several short stories by [[Raymond Carver]], which portrayed the lives of various citizens of Los Angeles over the course of several days. The film's large cast and intertwining of many different storylines were similar to his large-cast films of the 1970s; he won the [[Golden Lion]] at the 1993 [[Venice International Film Festival]] and another Oscar nomination for Best Director. In 1996, Altman directed ''[[Kansas City (1996 film)|Kansas City]]'', expressing his love of 1930s jazz through a complicated kidnapping story. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1999.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web |title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter&amp;nbsp;A |url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf |publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences |accessdate=April 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
''[[Gosford Park]]'' (2001), a large-cast, British country house [[murder mystery]], was included on many critics' lists of the ten best films of that year. It won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay ([[Julian Fellowes]]) plus six more nominations, including two for Altman, as Best Director and Best Picture.

Working with independent studios such as the now-shuttered Fine Line, Artisan (which was absorbed into today's [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]]), and USA Films (now [[Focus Features]]), gave Altman the edge in making the kinds of films he always wanted to make without studio interference. A [[A Prairie Home Companion (film)|film version]] of [[Garrison Keillor]]'s public radio series ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' was released in June&amp;nbsp;2006. Altman was still developing new projects up until his death, including a film based on ''[[Hands on a Hard Body: The Documentary]]'' (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.empireonline.com/News/story.asp?nid=19678 |title=Robert Altman has a hard body |magazine=Empire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] awarded Altman an [[Academy Honorary Award]] for Lifetime Achievement. During his acceptance speech, he revealed that he had received a heart transplant approximately ten or eleven years earlier. The director then quipped that perhaps the Academy had acted prematurely in recognizing the body of his work, as he felt like he might have four more decades of life ahead of him.

Following his successful career in television, Altman began his new career in the movie industry when he was in middle-age. He understood the creative limits imposed by the television genre, and now set out to direct and write films which would express his personal visions about American society and Hollywood. His films would later be described as &quot;[[auteur]]istic attacks&quot; and &quot;idiosyncratic variations&quot; of traditional films, typically using subtle comedy or satire as a way of expressing his observations.&lt;ref name=Wakeman&gt;John Wakeman, ed. ''World Film Directors – Vol. 2'', H. W. Wilson Co., N.Y. (1988) pp. 29–39&lt;/ref&gt;

His films were typically related to political, ideological, and personal subjects, and Altman was known for &quot;refusing to compromise his own artistic vision.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hillstrom /&gt; He has been described as &quot;anti-Hollywood,&quot; often ignoring the social pressures that affected others in the industry, which made it more difficult for him to get many of his films seen. However, he still felt that his independence as a filmmaker did him little harm overall:

{{quote|I don't think there's a filmmaker alive, or who ever lived, who's had a better shake than I've had. I've never been without a project and it's always been a project of my own choosing. So I don't know how much better it could be. I have not become a mogul, I don't build castles and I don't have a vast personal fortune, but I have been able to do what I've wanted to do and I've done it a lot.&lt;ref name=Stevens /&gt;}}

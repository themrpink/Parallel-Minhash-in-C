It rises in the [[Krkonoše Mountains]] of the northern [[Czech Republic]] before traversing much of [[Bohemia]] (western half of the Czech Republic), then [[Germany]] and flowing into the [[North Sea]] at [[Cuxhaven]], {{convert|110|km|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Hamburg]].

The Elbe's major [[Tributary|tributaries]] include the rivers [[Vltava]], [[Saale]], [[Havel]], [[Mulde]], [[Schwarze Elster]], and [[Ohře]].&lt;ref name=erb /&gt;

The Elbe river basin, comprising the Elbe and its tributaries, has a catchment area of {{convert|148268|km2}}, the twelfth largest in Europe. The basin spans four countries, however it lies almost entirely just in two of them, Germany (65.5%) and the Czech Republic (33.7%, covering about two thirds of the state's territory). Marginally, the basin stretches also to [[Austria]] (0.6%) and [[Poland]] (0.2%). The Elbe catchment area is inhabited by 24.4 million people, the biggest cities within are [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]], [[Prague]], [[Dresden]] and [[Leipzig]].&lt;ref name=erb /&gt;

==Course==
===In the Czech Republic===
The Elbe rises at an elevation of about {{convert|1400|m|ft|0}} in the [[Karkonosze|Krkonoše]] (also known as ''Giant Mountains'' or in German as ''Riesengebirge'') on the northwest borders of the Czech Republic near Labská bouda. Of the numerous small streams whose waters compose the infant river, the most important is the [[Bílé Labe]], or White Elbe. After plunging down the {{convert|60|m|ft|0}} of the [[Labský vodopád]], or Elbe Falls, the latter stream unites with the steeply torrential [[Malé Labe]], and thereafter the united stream of the Elbe pursues a southerly course, emerging from the mountain glens at [[Jaroměř]], where it receives [[Úpa]] and [[Metuje]].

Here the Elbe enters the vast vale named [[Polabí]] (meaning &quot;land along the Elbe&quot;), and continues on southwards through [[Hradec Králové]] (where [[Orlice|the River Orlice]] flows in) and then to [[Pardubice]], where it turns sharply to the west. At [[Kolín]] some {{convert|43|km|mi|0}} further on, it bends gradually towards the north-west. At the village of [[Káraný]], a little above [[Brandýs nad Labem]], it picks up the [[Jizera (river)|Jizera]].

At [[Mělník]] its stream is more than doubled in volume by the [[Vltava]], or [[Vltava|Moldau]], a major river which winds northwards through [[Bohemia]]. Upstream from the [[confluence]] the Vltava is in fact much longer ({{convert|434|km}} against {{convert|294|km}} of the Elbe so far), and has a greater discharge and a larger [[drainage basin]]. Nonetheless, for historical reasons the river retains the name Elbe, also because at the confluence point it is the Elbe that flows through the main, wider valley while the Vltava flows into the valley to meet the Elbe at almost a right angle, and thus appears to be the tributary river.

Some distance lower down, at [[Litoměřice]], the waters of the Elbe are tinted by the reddish [[Ohře]] (Eger). Thus augmented, and swollen into a stream {{convert|140|m|ft|0}} wide, the Elbe carves a path through the basaltic mass of the [[České Středohoří]], churning its way through a picturesque, deep, narrow and curved rocky gorge.

===In Germany===
Shortly after crossing the Czech-German frontier, and passing through the sandstone defiles of the [[Elbe Sandstone Mountains]], the stream assumes a north-westerly direction, which on the whole it preserves right to the North Sea.

The river rolls through [[Dresden]] and finally, beyond [[Meißen]], enters on its long journey across the [[North German Plain]] passing along the former western border of [[East Germany]], touching [[Torgau]], [[Wittenberg]], [[Dessau]], [[Magdeburg]], [[Wittenberge]], and [[Hamburg]] on the way, and taking on the waters of the [[Mulde]] and [[Saale]] from the west, and those of the [[Schwarze Elster]], [[Havel]] and [[Elde]] from the east. In its northern section both banks of the Elbe are characterised by flat, very fertile [[marshland]]s ([[Elbe Marshes]]), former flood plains of the Elbe now diked.

At Magdeburg  there is a  viaduct, the [[Magdeburg Water Bridge]], that carries a canal and its shipping traffic over the Elbe and its banks, allowing shipping traffic to pass under it unhindered.

{{wide image|ElbeInAutumn.jpg|800px|The Middle Elbe in the [[North German Plain]] near the village of [[Gorleben]]. In this section, the river had been part of the [[Iron Curtain]] between West and East Germany during the [[Cold War]]. For that reason, the river banks even today look relatively natural and undeveloped.|left}}

From the [[sluice]] of [[Geesthacht]] (at kilometre 586) on downstream the Elbe is subject to the [[tide]]s, the tidal Elbe section is called the [[Unterelbe|Low Elbe]] (Unterelbe). Soon the Elbe reaches Hamburg. Within the city-state the Unterelbe has a number of branch streams, such as [[Dove Elbe]], [[Gose Elbe]], [[Köhlbrand]], [[Norderelbe|Northern Elbe]] (Norderelbe), [[Reiherstieg]], [[Süderelbe|Southern Elbe]] (Süderelbe). Some of which have been disconnected for vessels from the main stream by dikes. In 1390 the Gose Elbe (literally in {{lang-en|shallow Elbe}}) was separated from the main stream by a dike connecting the two then-islands of [[Kirchwerder]] and [[Neuengamme, Hamburg|Neuengamme]]. The Dove Elbe (literally in {{lang-en|deaf Elbe}}) was diked off in 1437/38 at Gammer Ort. These [[hydraulic engineering]] works were carried out to protect marshlands from inundation, and to improve the water supply of the [[Port of Hamburg]]. After the heavy inundation by the [[North Sea flood of 1962]] the western section of the Southern Elbe was separated, becoming the Old Southern Elbe, while the waters of the eastern Southern Elbe now merge into the Köhlbrand, which is bridged by the [[Köhlbrandbrücke]], the last bridge over the Elbe before the North Sea.

The Northern Elbe passes the [[Elbe Philharmonic Hall]] and is then crossed under by the [[Elbe Tunnel (1911)|old Elbe Tunnel (Alter Elbtunnel)]], both in Hamburg's city centre. A bit more downstream the Low Elbe's two main [[anabranch]]es Northern Elbe and the Köhlbrand reunite south of [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]]-Altstadt, a locality of Hamburg. Right after both anabranches reunited the Low Elbe is passed under by the [[Elbe Tunnel (1975)|New Elbe Tunnel (Neuer Elbtunnel)]], the last structural road link crossing the river before the North Sea. At the bay [[Mühlenberger Loch]] in Hamburg at kilometre 634, the Northern Elbe and the Southern Elbe (here now the cut-off meander Old Southern Elbe) used to reunite, which is why the bay is seen as the starting point of the [[Niederelbe|Lower Elbe]] (Niederelbe). Leaving the city-state the Lower Elbe then passes between [[Holstein]] and the [[Elbe-Weser Triangle]] with [[Stade]] until it flows into the North Sea at [[Cuxhaven]]. Near its mouth it passes the entrance to the [[Kiel Canal]] at [[Brunsbüttel]] before it debouches into the North Sea.

==Navigation==
The Elbe has always been navigable by commercial vessels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ellmers |first1=Detlev |editor1-last=Brachmann |editor1-first=Hansjürgen |title=Die Rolle der Binnenschiffahrt für die Entwicklung der mittelalterlichen Städte |journal=Monum. Ger. Hist. |date=1991 |volume=4 |issue=425 |pages=137–147 |url=http://www.mgh.de/index.php?recnums=26061&amp;db=opac&amp;printapr=CLASSIC&amp;id=297&amp;wa72ci_url=%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmgh%2Fregsrch.pl |series=Frühgeschichte der europäischen Stadt |trans-title=The role of inland shipping in the development of mediaeval cities |publisher=Akademie Verlag |location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provides important trade links as far inland as [[Prague]]. The river is linked by [[canal]]s ([[Elbe Lateral Canal]], [[Elbe-Havel Canal]], [[Mittellandkanal]]) to the industrial areas of Germany and to [[Berlin]]. The [[Elbe-Lübeck Canal]] links the Elbe to the [[Baltic Sea]], as does the [[Kiel Canal]], whose western entrance is near the mouth of the Elbe. The [[Elbe-Weser Shipping Channel]] connects the Elbe with the [[Weser]].

By the [[Treaty of Versailles#International organizations|Treaty of Versailles]] the navigation on the Elbe became subject to the International Commission of the Elbe, seated in Dresden.&lt;ref&gt;The commission was staffed with two representatives of Czechoslovakia and one representative of [[Free State of Anhalt|Anhalt]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], Hamburg, [[Italy]], [[Free State of Prussia|Prussia]], [[Free State of Saxony|Saxony]], and the United Kingdom each, with Czecholosvakia and the German states being those, whose territory was crossed by the Elbe and thus competent for maintaining navigation installations. Cf. ''Der Große Brockhaus: Handbuch des Wissens in zwanzig Bänden'': 21 vols., completely revised ed., Leipzig: F. A. Brockhaus, &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;1928–1935, vol. 5 (1930): Fünfter Band Doc–Ez, article: 'Elbe', pp. 400seqq., here p. 402. No ISBN.&lt;/ref&gt; The statute of the Commission was signed in Dresden on February 22, 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Text in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 26, 220–247.&lt;/ref&gt; Following articles 363 and 364 of the Treaty of Versailles, [[Czechoslovakia]] was entitled to lease its own harbour bassin, [[Moldauhafen]] in Hamburg. The contract of lease with Germany, and supervised by the [[United Kingdom]], was signed on February 14, 1929 ending in 2028. Since 1993 the Czech Republic holds the former Czechoslovak legal position.

Before Germany was reunited, waterway transport in Western Germany was hindered by the fact that [[inland navigation]] to Hamburg had to pass through the German Democratic Republic. The Elbe-Seitenkanal (Elbe Lateral Canal) was built between the West German section of the Mittellandkanal and the Lower Elbe to restore this connection. When the two nations were reunited, works were begun to improve and restore the original links: the [[Magdeburg Water Bridge]] now allows large barges to cross the Elbe without having to enter the river. The often low water levels of the Elbe no longer hinder navigation to Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noorderSoft.com/indexen.html NoorderSoft Waterways Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

First attested in Latin as ''{{lang|la|Albis}}'', the name ''{{lang|de|Elbe}}'' means &quot;river&quot; or &quot;river-bed&quot; and is nothing more than the [[High German]] version of a word (''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/albī|*albī]]'') found elsewhere in Germanic; cf. [[Old Norse]] river name ''{{lang|non|Elfr}}'', [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''{{lang|sv|älv}}'' &quot;river&quot;, [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''{{lang|no|elv}}'' &quot;river&quot;, [[Old English]] river name ''{{lang|ang|elf}}'', and [[Middle Low German]] ''{{lang|gml|elve}}'' &quot;river-bed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Orel, Vladimir. ''A Handbook of Germanic Etymology''. Leiden, Netherlands: Brill, 2003: 13&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prehistory ==
{{Expand German|German article title = Elbe|date= November 2019}}
Humans first lived in the northern Elbe region before about 200,000 years ago, during the [[Middle Paleolithic]].

==History==
[[Ptolemy]] recorded the Elbe as ''{{lang|gem|Albis}}'' ([[Germanic languages|Germanic]] for &quot;river&quot;) in [[Germania]] Magna, with its source in the ''{{lang|de|Asciburgis}}'' mountains ({{lang|cs|[[Karkonosze|Krkonoše]]}}, {{lang|de|Riesengebirge}} or Giant Mountains), where the Germanic ''{{lang|de|[[Vandalii]]}}'' then lived.

The Elbe has long served as an important delineator of European geography. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] knew the river as the ''{{lang|la|Albis}}''; however, they made only one serious [[Early Imperial campaigns in Germania|attempt to move the border of their empire]] forward from the [[Rhine]] to the Elbe, and this attempt failed with the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] in 9&amp;nbsp;AD, after which they never seriously tried again. In the [[Middle Ages]] the Elbe formed the eastern limit of the [[Carolingian Empire|Empire]] of [[Charlemagne]] (King of the Franks from 769 to 814). The river's navigable sections were essential to the success of the [[Hanseatic League]] in the [[Late Middle Ages]], and much trade was carried on its waters.

From the early 6th century [[Slavic tribes]] (known as the [[Polabian Slavs]]) settled in the areas east of the rivers Elbe and Saale (which had been depopulated since the 4th century). In the 10th century the [[Ottonian Dynasty]] (dominant from 919 to 1024) began conquering these lands; a slow process of [[Germanization]] ensued, including the [[Wendish Crusade]] of 1147.

The Elbe delineated the western parts of Germany from the eastern so-called [[East Elbia]], where [[soccage]] and [[serfdom]] were more strict and prevailed longer than westwards of the river, and where feudal lords held bigger estates than in the west. Thus incumbents of huge land-holdings became characterised{{when|date=November 2019}} as East Elbian [[Junker]]s. The [[Northern Germany|Northern German]] area north of the Lower Elbe used to be called [[Nordalbingia|North Albingia]] in the Middle Ages. When the four [[Lutheran]] [[Landeskirche|church bodies]] there united in 1977 they chose the name [[North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church]]. Other, administrative units were named after the river Elbe, such as the [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalian]] ''Elbe [[département]]'' (1807–1813) and ''Lower Elbe département'' (1810), and the French département [[Bouches-de-l'Elbe]] (1811–1814).

In 1945, as [[World War II]] drew to a close, [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] territory came under attack from the armies of the [[western Allies]] advancing from the west and those of the [[Soviet Union]] advancing from the east. On 25 April 1945 these two forces linked up near [[Torgau]], on the Elbe. The victorious countries marked the event unofficially as [[Elbe Day]]. From 1949 to 1990 the Elbe formed part of the [[Inner German border]] between [[East Germany]] and [[West Germany]].

During the 1970s the Soviet Union stated that [[Adolf Hitler]]'s ashes had been scattered in the Elbe following disinterment from their original burial-site.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Meissner, ''Magda Goebbels, First Lady of the Third Reich'', 260–277&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

A '''privateer''' is a private person or ship that engages in maritime warfare under a commission of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mercenaries, pirates and sovereigns|url=https://archive.org/details/mercenariespirat0000thom|url-access=registration|last=Thomson|first=Janice E|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1994|location=New Jersey, United States|pages=310/3153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since robbery under arms was a common aspect of seaborne trade, until the early 19th century all merchant ships carried arms. A sovereign or delegated authority issued commissions, also referred to as a [[letter of marque]], during wartime. The commission empowered the holder to carry on all forms of hostility permissible at sea by the usages of war. This included attacking foreign vessels and taking them as prizes, and taking prize crews as prisoners for exchange. Captured ships were subject to condemnation and sale under [[prize (law)|prize law]], with the proceeds divided by percentage between the privateer's sponsors, shipowners, captains and crew. A percentage share usually went to the issuer of the commission (i.e. the sovereign).

Privateering allowed sovereigns to raise revenue for war by mobilizing privately owned armed ships and sailors to supplement state power. For participants, privateering provided the potential for a greater income and profit than obtainable as a merchant seafarer or fisher. However, this incentive increased the risk of privateers turning to piracy when war ended.

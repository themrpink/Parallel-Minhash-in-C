The [[Corsica]]n Murad Curso&lt;ref&gt;His second name &quot;Curso&quot; indicates his Corsican origin. A Spanish intelligence report of 1568 estimated there were 10,000 [[renegade (betrayer)|renegades]] in Algiers, of whom 6,000 were Corsicans. Fernand Braudel, ''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World'' (1949, 1966, 1973) pp. I: 159–160.&lt;/ref&gt; (d. 1631) had since his youth been sponsored by Ramdan Bey (d. 1613). Murad then followed his benefactor into the office of the [[Bey]], which he exercised effectively; later he was also named Pasha, although his position remained inferior to the Dey. His son Hamuda (1631–1666) inherited both titles, with the support of the local notables of Tunis. By virtue of his title as Pasha, the Bey came to enjoy the prestige of connection with the [[Sultan]]-[[Caliph]] in Constantinople. In 1640, upon the death of the Dey, Hamuda Bey maneuvered to establish his control over appointments to at office.

[[Altaic languages#The controversy over Altaic|Altaic language family]]. [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]] inclusion remains controversial.]]

Under Murad II Bey (1666–1675), son of Hamuda, the ''Diwan'' again functioned as a council of notables. Yet in 1673 the janissary deys, seeing their power ebbing, rose in revolt. During the consequent fighting, the urban forces of the [[janissary]] deys fought against the Muradid Beys with their largely rural forces under the tribal [[shaykhs]], and with popular support from city notables. As the Beys secured victory, so did the rural [[Bedouins]] and the Tunisian notables, who also emerged triumphant. The [[Arabic language]] returned to local official use, although the Muradids continued to use [[Turkish language|Turkish]] in the central government, accentuating their elite status and Ottoman connection.

At Murad II Bey's death, internal discord with the Muradid family led to armed struggle. The Turkish rulers of [[Algeria]] later intervened on behalf of one side in a subsequent domestic conflict; the Algerian forces did not withdraw and proved unpopular. This unfortunate condition of civil discord and Algerian interference persisted. The last Muradid Bey was assassinated in 1702 by Ibrahim Sharif, who then ruled for several years with Algerian backing.&lt;ref&gt;Laroui, ''The History of the Maghrib'' (1977) pp. 255–256.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, ''Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds'' (1986) pp. 56–58, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abun-Nasr, ''A History of the Maghrib'' (1971) pp. 178–180.&lt;/ref&gt;

A gradual economic shift occurred during the Muradid era, as corsair raiding decreased due to pressure from [[Early modern Europe|Europe]], and commercial trading based on agricultural products (chiefly grains) increased due to an integration of the rural population into regional networks. Mediterranean trade, however, continued to be carried by European [[merchant marine|shipping concerns]]. The Beys, in order to derive the maximum advantage from the [[export]] trade, in addition to taxation instituted government [[monopoly|monopolies]] which mediated between the local producers and foreign merchants. As a result, the rulers and their business partners (drawn from foreign-dominated [[elites]] connected to the Ottomans) took a disproportionate share of Tunisia's trading [[profit (accounting)|profits]].&lt;ref&gt;Government control of the economic wealth was evidently common in the region during the 16th century. Cf., Fernand Braudel, ''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World'' (1949, 1966, 1973) pp. I: 449–451. From such systematic policy in practice would later emerge the [[Mercantilist]] economic theory.&lt;/ref&gt; This precluded the development of local interests, whether rural [[landowners]] or a wealthy [[merchant]] strata. A social divide persisted, with the important families in Tunisia identified as a &quot;Turkish&quot; ruling [[caste]].&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, ''Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds'' (1986) pp. 58–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Husaynid Beys===
The [[Husainid Dynasty|Husaynid Beys]] ruled from 1705 to 1881, and reigned until 1957. In theory, Tunisia continued as a vassal of the Ottoman empire (the Friday prayer was pronounced in the name of the Ottoman Sultan, money was coined in his honor, and an annual ambassador brought gifts to Istanbul) but the Ottomans never were able to depend on, or exact, obedience.

[[Al-Husayn I ibn Ali at-Turki|Husayn ibn Ali]] (1669–1740), a cavalry officer of Greek [[Crete|Cretan]] origin, came into power in 1705, remaining in control until 1735. He had won backing from the Tunisian ulama and notables, as well as from the tribes, for his opposition to Algerian influence which was removed. Yet in a succession dispute, his nephew Ali and his son Muhammad fought a divisive civil war, which ended in 1740 with Ali's uncertain victory. This result was reversed in 1756 after ten more years of fighting, but not without meddling by Algeria.

[[Image:BainbridgeTribute.jpg|thumb|100px|Captain [[William Bainbridge]] (U.S.A.) with tribute for the Dey of [[Algiers]] in 1800; the Pasha of [[Tripoli, Libya|Tripoli]] declared war in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Stevens, Alden, Krafft, ''A Short History of the United States Navy'' (Philadelphia 1910, revised by Alden in 1927) p. 43 (1793), 61–92 (1800–1805), 204–206 (1807, 1812–1815).&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Early Husaynid policy required a careful balance among several divergent parties: the Ottomans, the Turkish speaking elite in Tunisia, and local Tunisians, both urban and rural, notables and clerics, landowners and the more remote tribes. Entanglement with the Ottoman Empire was avoided due to its potential ability to take over the Bey's prerogatives; however, religious ties to the [[Caliph]] were fostered, adding prestige to the Beys and winning approval of the local [[ulama]] and deference from the notables. [[Janissaries]] were still recruited, but increasing reliance was placed on tribal forces. Turkish was spoken at the apex, but use of Arabic increased in government use. ''Kouloughlis'' (children of mixed Turkish and Tunisian parentage) and native Tunisians notables were given increased admittance into higher positions and deliberations. Yet the Husaynid Beys did not themselves intermarry with Tunisians; instead they often turned to the institution of [[mamluks]].&lt;ref&gt;In Tunisian practice, non-Muslim slave youths were purchased in Ottoman markets, educated with royal scions in high government service and in Islam, converted, given high echelon positions, and often married to royal daughters. Mamluks would number about 100. Perkins, ''Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds'' (1986) p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The dynasty never ceased to identify as Ottoman, and therefore privileged. Nonetheless, the local ulama were courted, with funding for religious education and the clerics. [[Maliki]] jurist entered government service. Rural [[marabouts]] were mollified. Tribal shaykhs were recognized and invited to conferences. Especially favored were a handful of prominent families, Turkish speaking, who were given business and land opportunities, as well as important posts in the government, depending on their loyalty.

The French Revolution and reactions to it caused disruptions in European economic activity which provided opportunities for Tunisia to profit handsomely. Hammouda Pasha (1781–1813) was Bey during this period of prosperity; he also turned back an Algerian invasion in 1807, and quelled a janissary revolt in 1811.

After the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, Britain and France secured the Bey's agreement to cease sponsoring or permitting corsair raids, which had resumed during the Napoleonic conflict. Then in the 1820s economic activity in Tunisia took a steep downturn. The Tunisian government was particularly affected due to its monopoly positions regarding many exports. Credit was obtained to weather the deficits, but eventually the debt would grow to unmanageable levels. Foreign business interests increasingly exercised control over domestic commerce. Foreign trade proved to be a [[Trojan Horse]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucette Valensi]], ''Le Magheb avang la prise d'Alger'' (Paris 1969), translated as ''On the Eve of Colonialism: North Africa before the French conquest'' (New York: Africana 1977); cited by Perkins (1986) {{p.|67}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[French Protectorate of Tunisia|French Protectorate]] (1881–1956) the Husaynid Beys continued in a largely ceremonial rôle. Following independence, a republic was declared in 1957; the Beylical office was terminated and the Husaynid dynasty came to an end.

===Era of Reform===
In the 19th century under the Husaynid Beyds, commerce with the Europeans increased, with permanent residences established by many foreign merchants. In 1819 the Bey agreed to quit corsair raids. In 1830 the Bey also agreed to enforce in Tunisia the capitulation treaties between the Ottomans and various European powers, under which European consuls would act as judges in legal cases involving their nationals. During 1830 the [[Military history of France|French royal army]] occupied neighboring [[Algeria]].

[[Ahmad I ibn Mustafa|Ahmad Bey]] (1837–1855) assumed the throne during this complex situation. Following the examples of the Ottoman Empire under sultan [[Mahmud II]], and of Egypt under [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], he moved to intensify a program to update and upgrade the Tunisian armed forces. In pursuit of this policy, he instituted a military school and started industries in order to supply its more modern army and navy. In a major step, he initiated the recruitment and conscription of native Tunisians to serve in the army and navy, a step which would reduce the long division between the state and its citizens. Yet the resulting tax increases were not popular.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, ''Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds'' (1986) pp. 69-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although desiring Ottoman support, repeatedly Ahmad Bey refused to apply in Tunisia the Ottoman legal reforms regarding citizen rights, i.e., the [[Tanzimat]] of 1839. Instead, he instituted progressive laws of his own, showing native Tunisian authority in the modernizing project and hence the redundancy of importing any Ottoman reforms. The Slave trade was abolished in 1841, slavery in 1846. Yet these legal reforms had limited application to many Tunisians. Ahmad Bey continued the general Beylical policy, i.e., to decline or reject political attachment to the Ottoman state, but welcome religious ties to the [[Ottoman Caliphate]].&lt;ref&gt;Abun-Nasr, ''A History of the Maghrib'' (1971) pp. 259–275.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, ''Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds'' (1986) p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of his maneuvering to maintain Tunisia's sovereignty, Ahmad Bey sent 4,000 Tunisian troops against the [[Russian Empire]] during the [[Crimean War]] (1854–1856). In doing so he allied Tunisia with Turkey, France, and Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Rinehart, &quot;Historical Setting&quot; 1–70, p. 27, in ''Tunisia. A country study'' (3rd ed., 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernity and the French Protectorate==
{{Main|History of French-era Tunisia|French protectorate of Tunisia}}

As the 19th century commenced, the country remained quasi-autonomous, although officially still an Ottoman province. Trade with Europe increased dramatically with western merchants arriving to establish businesses in the country. In 1861, Tunisia enacted the first constitution in the Arab world, but a move toward a modernizing [[republic]] was hampered by the poor economy and by political unrest. Loans made by foreigners to the government were becoming difficult to manage. In 1869, Tunisia declared itself bankrupt; an international financial commission, with representatives from [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Italy]], took control over the economy.

Initially, Italy was the country that demonstrated the most desire to have Tunisia as a colony having investment, citizens and geographic proximity as motivation. However this was rebuffed when Britain and France co-operated to prevent this during the years 1871 – 1878 ending in Britain supporting French influence in Tunisia in exchange for dominion over Cyprus. France still had the issue of Italian influence (related to the huge colony of [[Tunisian Italians]] emigrated to Tunisia&lt;ref&gt;[https://bjuniornewblog.blogspot.com/2019/06/italians-in-colonial-french-maghreb.html Italians in Tunisia (and Maghreb)]&lt;/ref&gt;) and thus decided to find an excuse for a pre-emptive strike. In the spring of 1881, the [[French occupation of Tunisia|French army occupied Tunisia]], claiming that Tunisian troops had crossed the border to [[Algeria]], France's primary [[colony]] in [[Northern Africa]]. Italy, also interested in Tunisia, protested, but did not risk a war with France. On May 12 of that year, Tunisia was officially made a French [[protectorate]] with the signature of the [[treaty of Bardo]] (Al Qasr as Sa'id)by [[Muhammad III as-Sadiq]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooley, ''Baal, Christ, and Mohammed. Religion and Revolution in North Africa'' (New York 1965) pp. 193–196; Richard M. Brace, ''Morocco Algeria Tunisia'' (Prentice-Hall 1964) pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; This gave France control of Tunisian governance and making it a de facto French protectorate.

[[Image:Empire colonial français (1920).png|thumb|left|France's colonial empire at the time of French rule in Tunisia.]]



The French progressively assumed more of the important administrative positions, and by 1884 they supervised all Tunisian government bureaus dealing with finance, post, education, telegraph, public works and agriculture. They decided to guarantee the Tunisian debt, and then abolished the international finance commission. French settlements in the country were actively encouraged; the number of French colonists grew from 34,000 in 1906 to 144,000 in 1945, occupying approximately one-fifth of the cultivated land. Roads, ports, railroads, and mines were developed. In rural areas the French administration strengthened the local officials (''qa'ids'') and weakened the independent tribes. An additional judicial system was established for Europeans but available generally, set up without interfering with the existing [[Sharia]] courts, available as always for the legal matters of Tunisians.

[[Image:Carte tunisie 1902.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Map of Tunisia in 1902 with numerous railroads]]

Many welcomed the progressive changes, but preferred to manage their own affairs. Kayr al-Din in the 1860s and 1870s had introduced modernizing reforms before the French occupation. Some of his companions later founded the weekly magazine ''al-Hadira'' in 1888. A more radical one ''al-Zahra'' ran from 1890 until suppressed in 1896; as was the ''Sabil al-Rashad'' of 'Abd al-'Aziz al-Tha'alibi, who was inspired by [[Muhammad 'Abduh]] of Cairo, among others. Bashir Sfar initiated the discussion group ''Khalduniya'' in 1896. [[Ali Bach Hamba|'Ali Bash Hamba]] founded the French language journal ''Tunisien'' to inform the French public of the Tunisian complaints, but only increased unrest. Tha'alibi founded the Arabic language ''Tunisien'' in 1909, to challenge Hamba from a Tunisian view point. In 1911 there were civil disturbances started within the universities. Hamba and Tha'alibi came together. A political party was begun, ''al-Ittihad al-Islami'' [Islamic Unity], which had pro-Ottoman leanings. Issues concerning a Muslim cemetery, the Jallaz, sparked large demonstrations which ended with martial law and the killing of many Tunisians in late 1911. Further demonstrations in 1912 led to the closing of the nationalist newspapers and the exiling of nationalist leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Laroui, ''History of Maghrib'' pp. 314–315, 353, 357–361.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organized nationalist sentiment among Tunisians, driven underground in 1912, resurfaced after the great War. Encouragement came from many directions, e.g., the formation of the [[League of Nations]] in 1919. Nationalists established the Destour [Constitution] Party in 1920. [[Habib Bourguiba]] established and led its successor, the Neo-Destour Party, in 1934. French authorities later banned this new party, while the fascist organizations of the [[Tunisian Italians]] supported it ([[Mussolini]] obtained the liberation of Bourghiba from a [[Vichy France|Vichy]] jail in 1942).

During [[World War II]], the French authorities in Tunisia supported the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] government which ruled France after its capitulation to [[Germany]] in 1940. After initial victories to the east the German General [[Erwin Rommel]],&lt;ref&gt;Rommel later joined the German military's plot to kill Hitler; Rommel's preference was to arrest him and try him for war crimes. Wm. L. Shirer, ''Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'' (New York 1960) pp. 1030–1032.&lt;/ref&gt; lacking supplies and reinforcements, in 1942 lost the decisive battle of [[Second Battle of El Alamein|al-Alamein]] (near Alexandria in Egypt) to the British General [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]]. After learning of Allied landings in the west ([[Operation Torch]]), the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] army retreated westward to Tunisia and set up defensive positions. The British following on his heels eventually broke these lines, although Rommel did have some early success against the &quot;green&quot; [[United States|American]] troops advancing from the west, until the arrival of General [[George Patton]] who stopped Rommel in battle. The fighting ended in May 1943. The German Afrika Corps surrendered on May 11. Two days later, on May 13, after the collapse of the [[5th Panzer Army|5th German Tank Army]], the fall of Tunis and the surrounding of the [[First Army (Italy)|1st Italian Army]], still holding the line at Enfidaville, the Italian general [[Giovanni Messe|Messe]] formally surrendered to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].

General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] (who earned trust by talking straight if not always clearly) stated at &quot;far from governing a conquered country, we were attempting only to force a gradual widening of the base of government, with the final objective of turning all internal affairs over to popular control.&quot; Tunisia became a staging area for operations in the invasion of [[Sicily]] later at year.&lt;ref&gt;Dwight D. Eisenhower, ''Crusade in Europe'' (New York 1948) p. 137; Wm. L. Shirer, ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'' pp. 912–913.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Tunisia sm03.png|200px|thumb|Map of modern Tunisia.]]

After World War II, the struggle for national independence continued and intensified. The Neo-Destour Party reemerged under Habib Bourguiba. Yet with a lack of progress, violent resistance to French rule began in the mountains during 1954.  The Tunisians coordinated with independence movements in Algeria and Morocco, although it was Tunisia that first became independent. Ultimately, the Neo-Destour Party managed to gain sovereignty for its people by maneuver and finesse.&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Brace, ''Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia'' (Prentice-Hall 1964) pp. 39–52, 95–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tunisian Republic==
{{Main|History of modern Tunisia}}

Independence from [[France]] was achieved on March 20, 1956. The State was established as a [[constitutional monarchy]] with the [[Bey of Tunis]], [[Muhammad VIII al-Amin]] Bey, as the king of [[Tunisia]].

===The Era of Habib Bourguiba===

In 1957, the Prime Minister [[Habib Bourguiba]] (Habib Abu Ruqaiba) abolished the monarchy and firmly established his [[Neo Destour]] (New Constitution) party. The regime sought to run a strictly structured regime with efficient and equitable state operations, but not democratic-style politics. Also terminated was the ''[[Beylik of Tunis|bey]]'', a quasi-monarchist institution dating back to [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule. Then Bourguiba commenced to dominate the country for the next 31 years, governing with thoughtful programs yielding stability and economic progress, repressing [[Islamic fundamentalism]], and establishing rights for women unmatched by any other Arab nation.&lt;ref&gt;Brace, ''Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia'' (1964) p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; The vision at Bourguiba offered was of a Tunisian republic. The political culture would be secular, populist, and imbued with a kind of French rationalist vision of the state at was buoyant, touched with élan, ''Napoleonic'' in spirit. Bourguiba then saw an idiosyncratic, eclectic future combining tradition and innovation, Islam with a liberal prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;Habib Bourguiba has been compared to [[Atatürk]] (Mustafa Kemal) of Turkey, as a unique national modernizing leader. Yet, what may be called an inclination to arbitrary methods when making government decisions, and to a specie of personality cult, detracted from Bourguiba's insight and substantial achievements. Perkins, ''A History of Modern Tunisia'' (2004), e.g., pp. 130, 204–209.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Bourguibism&quot; was also resolutely nonmilitarist, arguing that Tunisia could never be a credible military power and that the building of a large military establishment would only consume scarce investment resources and perhaps thrust Tunisia into the cycles of military intervention in politics at had plagued the rest of the Middle East. In the name of economic development, Bourguiba nationalized various religious land holdings and dismantled several religious institutions.&lt;ref&gt;On the other hand, Bourguiba also negotiated with the Catholic Church; as a result Tunisia received scores of churches and land parcels to be used for libraries or museums, and the right to be consulted in the naming of future Church leaders. John K. Cooley, ''Baal, Christ, and Mohammad. Religion and Revolution in North Africa'' (Holt Rinehart Winston 1965) pp. 3–5, 297–298.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourguiba's great asset was at &quot;Tunisia possessed a mature nationalist organization, the Neo Destour Party, which on independence day held the nation's confidence in hand.&quot; It had made its case to the city workers in the modern economy and to country folk in the traditional economy; it had excellent leaders who commanded respect and who generally developed reasonable government programs.&lt;ref&gt;Brace, ''Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia'' (1964) p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1961, when Tunisia imposed a blockade on the French naval base at [[Bizerte]], hoping to force its evacuation, [[Bizerte crisis|the crisis]] culminated in a three-day battle between French and Tunisian forces that left some 630 Tunisians and 24 French dead and eventually led to France ceding the city and naval base to Tunisia in 1963.

One a serious rival to [[Habib Bourguiba]] was Salah Ben Yusuf. Exiled in [[Cairo]] during the early 1950s he had absorbed the pan-Arab nationalism associated with the Egyptian leader [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]]. Yet as a result of his strong opposition to the Neo Destour leadership during their negotiations with France for autonomy prior to independence, Ben Youssef was removed from his position as secretary-general and expelled from the party. Nonetheless he rallied disaffected union members, students, and others, enough to put 20,000 ''yusufists'' into the street during the next congress of the Neo Destour party. Eventually he left Tunisia for Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, ''A History of Modern Tunisia'' (Cambridge Univ. 2004) pp. 117–118, 128–129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ben Yusuf was assassinated in Egypt in 1961. Brace, ''Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia'' (1964) pp. 115–116, 142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;After 1987, Ben Yusuf was gradually &quot;rehabilitated&quot; and his body returned to Tunisia for burial. Perkins, ''A History of Modern Tunisia'' (Cambridge Univ. 2004) pp. 199–201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Socialism was not initially a major part of the [[Neo Destour]] project, but the government had always held and implemented redistributive policies. A large public works program was launched in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Brace, ''Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia'' (1964) pp. 146–147.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless in 1964, Tunisia entered a short lived socialist era. The Neo Destour party became the Socialist Destour (''Parti Socialiste Dusturien'' or PSD), and the new minister of planning, Ahmed Ben Salah, formulated a state-led plan for agricultural cooperatives and public-sector industrialization. The socialist experiment raised considerable opposition within Bourguiba's old coalition. Ahmed Ben Salah was eventually dismissed in 1970, and many socialized operations (e.g., the farm cooperatives) were returned to private ownership in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name = &quot;Khaddar, 849&quot;&gt;Moncef M. Khaddar, &quot;Tunisia&quot; pp. 848–850, 849, in Joel Krieger (ed.), ''Oxford Companion to Politics of the World'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, a general strike was repressed by the government with its forces killing dozens; union leaders were jailed.

After independence, Tunsian economic policy had been primarily to promote light industry and tourism, and develop its phosphate deposits. The major sector remained agriculture with small farms prevailing, but these did not produce well. In the early 1960s the economy slowed down, but the socialist program did not prove to be the cure.

In the 1970s the economy of Tunisia expanded at a very healthy rate. Oil was discovered, and tourism continued. City and countryside populations drew roughly equal in number. Yet agricultural problems and urban unemployment led to increased migration to Europe.

===The Era of Ben Ali===

In the 1980s the economy performed poorly. In 1983 the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) forced the government to raise the price of bread and [[semolina]], causing severe hardship and protest riots. In this situation, the Islamic Tendency Movement (MTI) under Cheikh Rached el-Ghannouchi provided popular leadership. Civil disturbances, including those by the Islamists, were repressed by government security forces under General [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]]. The government persisted in following its program; Ben Ali was named prime minister.

The 84-year-old President Bourguiba was overthrown and replaced by Ben Ali his Prime Minister on November 7, 1987.&lt;ref&gt;John P. Entelis, &quot;Tunisia&quot; pp. 532–533 in ''The Americana Annual 1988'' (New York: Grolier). Ben Ali's background was said to be pro-Western, trained in military affairs by France and the U.S.A.; he had previously clamped down on both left and right opponents, especially Islamic fundamentalists. Ninety fundamentalist had been found guilty of bombing hotels earlier in 1987. Entelis (1987) pp. 532–533.&lt;/ref&gt; The new president changed very little in the Bourguibist political support system, except to rename the party the Constitutional Democratic Rally ([[Constitutional Democratic Rally|RCD]] by its French acronym).

In 1988, [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali|Ben Ali]] tried a new tack with reference to the government and Islam, by attempting to reaffirm the country's Islamic identity; several Islamist activists were released from prison. He also forged a national pact with the Tunisian party Harakat al-Ittijah al-Islami (Islamic Tendency Movement), which had been founded in 1981; later it changed its name to [[Ennahda Movement|an-Nahda]] (the Renaissance Party). But Ben Ali's innovative tack did not work out. Subsequently, An-Nahda claimed to have run strongly in the 1989 elections, which gave the appearance of being unfair; reports often described pro-government votes at over 90%. Ben Ali subsequently banned Islamist political parties and jailed as many as 8,000 activists.&lt;ref name = &quot;Khaddar, 849&quot;/&gt;

{{Main|2000s in Tunisia}}

In 2004, Ben Ali was re-elected President for a five-year term, with a reported 94.5% of the vote. Also elected were 189 members of the ''Majlis al-Nuwaab'' or Chamber of Deputies, with a five-year term. In addition, there was a Chamber of Advisors composed of 126 members with six-year terms, of whom 85 were elected by government subdivisions (e.g., municipalities), by professional associations, and by trade unions (14 union members boycotted the process); the remaining 41 members were appointed by the President. The court system remained a combination of French [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil Law]] and Islamic [[Sharia]] Law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ts.html ''The World Factbook'' on &quot;Tunisia&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816174911/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ts.html |date=2013-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely supported human rights movement emerged, which included not only Islamists but also trade unionists, lawyers and journalists. Tunisia's political institutions, however, remained fixed in the authoritarian past. As of 2001, the government's response to calls for reform Included house arrests and prison.&lt;ref name = &quot;Khaddar, 849&quot;/&gt; The government continued its refusal to recognize Muslim opposition parties, and governed the country in a political climate considered rigid, from time to time using objectionable military and police measures to repress dissent.

In foreign affairs, Tunisia continued to enjoy close ties to the West while broadly following a moderate, non-aligned stance. The [[Arab League]] was headquartered in Tunis from 1979 to 1991.

===2000s in Tunisia===
{{update|date=December 2016}}
Tunis, the capital, has a population of about 700,000, and the second city of [[Sfax]] approximately 250,000. The population growth rate measured as births per female has fallen from 7 (1960s) to 2 (2007). Life expectancy is female 75, male 72. The religion is [[Islam|Muslim]] (98%), with 1% Christian, and 1% Jewish and other. Required education is eight years. The official language is [[Arabic language|Arabic]], with [[French language|French]] also spoken particularly in commercial dealings, and with less than 2% [[Berber languages|Berber]]. Literacy by definition includes all over 15 years, and is overall 74%, male 83% and female 65%. In 2006, 7.3 million mobile phones were in use and 1.3 million were on the internet; there were 26 television stations and 29 radio stations.&lt;ref name = &quot;CIA World Fact Book Tunisia&quot;/&gt;  Over half the population is considered urban, with agricultural workers being about 30% of the total. Unemployment in 2000 was about 15.6%, and in 2006 about 13.9%. Over 300,000 Tunisians were reported to be residing in France during 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Hermida, &quot;Tunisia&quot; pp. 544–545 in ''The Americana Annual 1994'' (New York: Grolier); Rose Ryan, &quot;Tunisia&quot; p. 548 in ''The Americana Annual 2000'' (NY: Grolier).&lt;/ref&gt; Left out of the recent prosperity were many rural and urban poor, including small businesses facing the world market.

The monetary unit is the ''dinar'', at about 1.33 per dollar U.S.A. (recently a fairly constant rate), with inflation estimated pp.&amp;nbsp;4.5% for 2006. Tunisia's per capita annual income was approximately 8,900 dollars (U.S.A.) in 2006.&lt;ref name = &quot;CIA World Fact Book Tunisia&quot;/&gt; Between 1988 and 1998 the economy more than doubled. The economy grew at 5% per year during the 1990s (the best in Northwest Africa), but hit a 15-year low of 1.9% in 2002 (due to drought and a decline in tourism), but it regained a 5% rate for 2003–2005; it was said to be 4%–5% for 2006.  Tunisia's economy is diverse. Its products are primarily from light industry (food processing, textiles, footwear, agribusiness, mining commodities, construction materials) and from agriculture (olives, olive oil, grains (wheat and barley), tomatoes, citrus, sugar beets, dates, almonds, figs, vegetables, grapes, beef dairy), as well as livestock (sheep, goats) and fishing. Other production comes from petroleum and mining (phosphates, iron, oil, lead, zinc, salt). Tunisia is self-sufficient in oil, but not in natural gas. A very significant portion of the economy derives from the tourist industry.&lt;ref&gt;Rose Ryan, &quot;Tunisia&quot; p. 548 in ''The Americana Annual 2000'' (NY: Grolier); by 2000 four million tourists were visiting each year, generating 4.7% of Tunisia's Gross Domestic Product (G.D.P.).&lt;/ref&gt; Gross Domestic Product (G.D.P.) was composed of approximately 12.5% agriculture, 33.1% industry, and 54.4% services. Exports went to France 29%, Italy 20%, Germany 9%, Spain 6%, Libya 5%, U.S.A. 4%. Imports came from France 25%, Italy 22%, Germany 10%, Spain 5%.&lt;ref name = &quot;CIA World Fact Book Tunisia&quot;/&gt; An association agreement with the [[European Union]] will move Tunisia toward full free trade with the EU by 2008.

Frederick's location as a crossroads has been a factor in its development as a minor distribution center both for the movement of people in Western Maryland, as well as goods. This intersection has created an efficient distribution network for commercial traffic in and out, as well as through the city.

Major roads and streets in Frederick are intersected by: 
*'''[[Interstate 70|I-70]]''': A major eastâ€“west interstate highway connecting Frederick to [[Baltimore]] and [[Hagerstown, Maryland|Hagerstown]]

The Mayor's Ad-hoc Bicycle Committee was formed in 2010 and given the mission to achieve designation for the City as a Bicycle Friendly Community (BFC) by the [[League of American Bicyclists]]. The first application resulted in an Honorable Mention. Upon reapplication In 2012, Frederick achieved the bronze level BFC designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fredericknewspost.com/blogs/blogs_collection/bicycling_in_and_around_frederick/frederick-a-bicycle-friendly-community/article_aa79e5a6-e891-11e2-84e1-001a4bcf6878.html|title=Frederick: A Bicycle-Friendly Community|date=July 9, 2013|work=Frederick News Post|access-date=July 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City's third application resulted in re-certification as a Bronze Bicycle Friendly Community. Work is ongoing to achieve an even stronger designation (Silver) at the time of the next application.

In 2013 the Mayor's Ad-hoc Bicycle Committee was expanded in scope to include pedestrian issues and was formally adopted by  [http://cityoffrederick.com/DocumentCenter/View/2965/13-08-Creating-a-Bicycle-and-Pedestrian-Advisory-Committee?bidId= Resolution 13-08] as a permanent standing committee called the Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Committee (BPAC).

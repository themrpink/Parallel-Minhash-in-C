===Attributive ditransitive verbs===

Another category of ditransitive verb is the attributive ditransitive verb in which the two objects are semantically an entity and a quality, a source and a result, etc. These verbs attribute one object to the other. In English, ''make'', ''name'', ''appoint'', ''consider'', ''turn into'' and others are examples:

*''The state of New York made Hillary Clinton a Senator.''
*''I will name him Galahad.''

The first object is a [[direct object]]. The second object is an [[Complement (linguistics)|object complement]].&lt;ref&gt;Hopper, Paul J. 1999. A short course in grammar. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huddleston, Rodney. 1984. Introduction to the grammar of English. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attributive ditransitive verbs are also referred to as [[resultative]] verbs.&lt;ref&gt;Fordyce-Ruff, Tenielle. 2015.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphosyntactic alignment==
The [[morphosyntactic alignment]] between arguments of monotransitive and ditransitive verbs is explained below. If the three arguments of a typical ditransitive verb are labeled '''D''' (for Donor; the subject of a verb like &quot;to give&quot; in English), '''T''' (for Theme; normally the direct object of ditransitive verb in English) and '''R''' (for Recipient, normally the indirect object in English), these can be aligned with the '''A'''gent and '''P'''atient of monotransitive verbs and the '''S'''ubject of intransitive verbs in several ways, which are not predicted by whether the language is [[Nominative–accusative language|nominative–accusative]], [[Ergative–absolutive language|ergative–absolutive]], or [[Active–stative language|active–stative]].  '''D'''onor is always or nearly always in the same [[Grammatical case|case]] as '''A'''gent, but different languages equate the other arguments in different ways:{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

* '''Indirective languages''': D&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;A, T&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;P, with a third case for R
* '''[[Secundative language|Secundative]]''' or '''dechticaetiative language''' languages: D&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;A, R&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;P, with a third case for T
* '''Split-P languages''': D&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;A, some monotransitive clauses have P&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;T, others have P&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;R

'''Parasitism''' is a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] [[biological interactions|relationship]] between [[species]], where one organism, the '''parasite''', lives on or inside another organism, the [[Host (biology)|host]], causing it some harm, and is [[adaptation (biology)|adapted]] structurally to this way of life.{{sfn|Poulin|2007|pages=4–5}} The [[entomologist]] [[E. O. Wilson]] has characterised parasites as &quot;predators that eat prey in units of less than one&quot;.&lt;ref name=Wilson2014/&gt; Parasites include [[protozoa]]ns such as the agents of [[malaria]], [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], and [[amoebiasis|amoebic dysentery]]; animals such as [[hookworm]]s, [[lice]], [[mosquito]]es, and [[vampire bat]]s; [[fungi]] such as [[Armillaria mellea|honey fungus]] and the agents of [[ringworm]]; and plants such as [[mistletoe]], [[dodder]], and the [[Orobanchaceae|broomrapes]]. There are six major parasitic [[Behavioral ecology#Evolutionarily stable strategy|strategies]] of exploitation of animal hosts, namely [[parasitic castration]], directly transmitted parasitism (by contact), [[wikt:trophic|trophically]] transmitted parasitism (by being eaten), [[vector (epidemiology)|vector]]-transmitted parasitism, [[parasitoid]]ism, and micropredation.

Like predation, parasitism is a type of [[Consumer-Resource Systems|consumer-resource interaction]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21199247&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Getz |first=W. M. | title=Biomass transformation webs provide a unified approach to consumer-resource modelling | journal=Ecology Letters | volume=14 | issue=2 | pages=113–124 | year=2011 | pmid=21199247 | pmc=3032891 | doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01566.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; but unlike [[Predation|predators]], parasites, with the exception of parasitoids, are typically much smaller than their hosts, do not kill them, and often live in or on their hosts for an extended period. Parasites of animals are highly [[Generalist and specialist species|specialised]], and [[reproduction|reproduce]] at a faster rate than their hosts. Classic examples include interactions between [[vertebrate]] hosts and [[Cestoda|tapeworms]], [[Trematoda|flukes]], the malaria-causing ''[[Plasmodium]]'' species, and [[Siphonaptera|fleas]].

Parasites reduce host [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] by general or specialised [[pathology]], from parasitic castration to modification of host behaviour. Parasites increase their own fitness by exploiting hosts for resources necessary for their survival, in particular by feeding on them and by using intermediate (secondary) hosts to assist in their [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]] from one definitive (primary) host to another. Although parasitism is often unambiguous, it is part of a spectrum of interactions between [[species]], grading via parasitoidism into predation, through evolution into [[mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], and in some fungi, shading into being [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprophytic]].

People have known about parasites such as [[nematode|roundworms]] and tapeworms since [[ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. In [[Early Modern]] times, [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] observed ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'' in his microscope in 1681, while [[Francesco Redi]] described internal and external parasites including [[sheep liver fluke]] and [[tick]]s. Modern [[parasitology]] developed in the 19th century. In human culture, parasitism has negative connotations. These were exploited to [[satire|satirical]] effect in [[Jonathan Swift]]'s 1733 poem &quot;On Poetry: A Rhapsody&quot;, comparing poets to [[hyperparasitical]] &quot;vermin&quot;. In fiction, [[Bram Stoker]]'s 1897 [[Gothic fiction|Gothic horror]] novel ''[[Dracula]]'' and its many later adaptations featured a [[hematophagy|blood-drinking]] parasite. [[Ridley Scott]]'s 1979 film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' was one of many works of [[science fiction]] to feature a parasitic alien species.&lt;ref name=Guardian2009/&gt;

== Etymology ==

First used in English in 1539, the word ''parasite'' comes from the [[Old French|Medieval French]] ''parasite'', from the [[Latin]] ''parasitus'', the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''παράσιτος'' (''parasitos''), &quot;one who eats at the table of another&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpara%2Fsitos παράσιτος], Liddell, Henry George; Scott, Robert, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; and that from ''παρά'' (''para''), &quot;beside, by&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpara%2F παρά], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; + ''σῖτος'' (''sitos''), &quot;wheat&quot;, hence &quot;food&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsi%3Dtos σῖτος], Liddell, Henry George; Scott, Robert, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; The related term ''parasitism'' appears in English from 1611.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsitismo%2Fs σιτισμός], Liddell, Henry George; Scott, Robert, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;

Parasitism is a kind of [[symbiosis]], a close and persistent long-term biological interaction between a parasite and its host. Unlike [[saprotroph]]s, parasites feed on living hosts, though some parasitic fungi, for instance, may continue to feed on hosts they have killed. Unlike [[commensalism]] and [[mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], the parasitic relationship harms the host, either feeding on it or, as in the case of intestinal parasites, consuming some of its food. Because parasites interact with other species, they can readily act as [[vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] of pathogens, causing [[parasitic disease|disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Overview of Parasitology |url=http://parasite.org.au/para-site/introduction/introduction-essay.html |publisher=Australian Society of Parasitology and Australian Research Council/National Health and Medical Research Council) Research Network for Parasitology |date=July 2010 |isbn=978-1-8649999-1-4 | quote=Parasitism is a form of symbiosis, an intimate relationship between two different species. There is a biochemical interaction between host and parasite; i.e. they recognize each other, ultimately at the molecular level, and host tissues are stimulated to react in some way.

O. Wilson]] has characterised parasites as &quot;predators that eat prey in units of less than one&quot;.&lt;ref name=Wilson2014&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Edward O. |authorlink=E. O.

Tolerable parasites are those that have evolved to ensure their own survival and reproduction but at the same time with minimum pain and cost to the host.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within that scope are many possible strategies. [[Taxonomist]]s classify parasites in a variety of overlapping schemes, based on their interactions with their hosts and on their [[parasitic life cycle|life-cycles]], which are sometimes very complex. An [[obligate parasite]] depends completely on the host to complete its life cycle, while a [[facultative parasite]] does not. Parasite life-cycles involving only one host are called &quot;direct&quot;; those with a definitive host (where the parasite reproduces sexually) and at least one intermediate host are called &quot;indirect&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plpnemweb.ucdavis.edu/nemaplex/General/animpara.htm |title=A Classification of Animal-Parasitic Nematodes |work=plpnemweb.ucdavis.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Garcia, L.

These each had a [[mathematical model]] assigned in order to analyse the population movements of the host–parasite groupings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rollinson&quot;/&gt; The microorganisms and viruses that can reproduce and complete their life cycle within the host are known as microparasites. Macroparasites are the multicellular organisms that reproduce and complete their life cycle outside of the host or on the host's body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rollinson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/bkeeem/parasitism/0 |title=Parasitism {{!}} The Encyclopedia of Ecology and Environmental Management |publisher=Blackwell Science |accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the thinking on types of parasitism has focussed on terrestrial animal parasites of animals, such as helminths. Those in other environments and with other hosts often have analogous strategies. For example, the [[snubnosed eel]] is probably a facultative endoparasite (i.e., it is '''semiparasitic''') that opportunistically burrows into and eats sick and dying fish.&lt;ref name=Caira1997&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Environmental Biology of Fishes |volume=49 |pages=139–144 |year=1997 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226076003 |title=Pugnose eels, ''Simenchelys parasiticus'' (Synaphobranchidae) from the heart of a shortfin mako, ''Isurus oxyrinchus'' (Lamnidae) |last1=Caira |first1=J.

As female scale-insects cannot move, they are obligate parasites, permanently attached to their hosts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rollinson&quot;/&gt;

The sensory inputs that a parasite employs to identify and approach a potential host are known as &quot;host cues&quot;. Such cues can include, for example, vibration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lawrence |first=P.

===Major strategies===

Parasites exhibit six major parasitic [[Behavioral ecology#Evolutionarily stable strategy|strategies]], namely:
* [[parasitic castrator|parasitic castration]]
* directly transmitted parasitism
* [[wikt:trophic|trophically]]-transmitted parasitism
* [[vector (epidemiology)|vector]]-transmitted parasitism
* [[parasitoid]]ism
* micropredation

These apply to parasites whose hosts are plants as well as animals.&lt;ref name=PoulinRandhawa2015&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Poulin |first1= Robert |author1link= Robert Poulin (zoologist) |last2= Randhawa |first2= Haseeb S. |title= Evolution of parasitism along convergent lines: from ecology to genomics |journal= Parasitology |date= February 2015 |volume= 142 |issue= Suppl 1 |pages= S6–S15 |doi= 10.1017/S0031182013001674 |pmc= 4413784 |pmid= 24229807}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rollinson&gt;{{cite book |author= Poulin, Robert |authorlink= Robert Poulin (zoologist) |editor1= Rollinson, D. |editor2= Hay, S.

A perspective on the evolutionary options can be gained by considering four questions:

* the effect on the [[Fitness (biology) |fitness]] of a parasite's hosts
* the number of hosts they have per life stage
* whether the host is prevented from reproducing
* whether the effect depends on intensity (number of parasites per host)

From this analysis, the major evolutionary strategies of parasitism emerge, alongside predation.&lt;ref name=LaffertyKuris2002&gt;{{cite journal |author1= Lafferty, K. D. |author2= Kuris, A.

====Parasitic castrators====
{{main|Parasitic castration}}

[[Parasitic castrator]]s partly or completely destroy their host's ability to reproduce, diverting the energy that would have gone into reproduction into host and parasite growth, sometimes causing gigantism in the host. The host's other systems remain intact, allowing it to survive and to sustain the parasite.&lt;ref name=PoulinRandhawa2015/&gt;{{sfn|Poulin|2007|p=111}} Parasitic crustaceans such as those in the specialised [[barnacle]] genus ''[[Sacculina]]'' specifically cause damage to the gonads of their many species&lt;ref name=&quot;Elumalai Viswanathan Pravinkumar Raffi&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Elumalai | first1= V. | last2= Viswanathan | first2= C. | last3= Pravinkumar | first3= M. | last4= Raffi | first4= S.

In the case of ''Sacculina'', the testes of over two-thirds of their crab hosts degenerate sufficiently for these male crabs to develop female [[secondary sex characteristics]] such as broader abdomens, smaller [[chela (organ) |claws]] and egg-grasping appendages. Various species of helminth castrate their hosts (such as insects and snails). This may happen directly, whether mechanically by feeding on their gonads, or by secreting a chemical that destroys reproductive cells; or indirectly, whether by secreting a hormone or by diverting nutrients. For example, the trematode ''[[Zoogonus lasius]]'', whose [[Trematode life cycle stages| sporocysts]] lack mouths, castrates the intertidal marine snail ''[[Tritia obsoleta]]&lt;!--formerly Ilyanassa--&gt;'' chemically, developing in its gonad and killing its reproductive cells.{{sfn|Poulin|2007|p= 111}}&lt;ref name=Cheng13&gt;{{cite book |last= Cheng |first= Thomas C. |title= General Parasitology |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=d4GQlYzode8C&amp;pg=PA13 |year= 2012 |publisher= Elsevier Science |isbn= 978-0-323-14010-2 |pages= 13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Directly transmitted====
&lt;!--[[File:Schistosoma mansoni2.jpg|thumb|''[[Schistosoma mansoni]]'' an obligate directly-transmitted [[endoparasite]], causes [[schistosomiasis]] (snail fever)]]--&gt;

Directly transmitted parasites, not requiring a vector to reach their hosts, include such parasites of terrestrial vertebrates as lice and mites; marine parasites such as [[copepod]]s and [[Cyamidae|cyamid]] [[amphipod]]s; [[monogenea]]ns; and many species of nematodes, fungi, protozoans, bacteria, and viruses. Whether endoparasites or ectoparasites, each has a single host-species. Within that species, most individuals are free or almost free of parasites, while a minority carry a large number of parasites; this highly uneven distribution is described{{by whom?|date=October 2020}} as [[Aggregated distribution |aggregated]].&lt;ref name=PoulinRandhawa2015/&gt;

====Trophically transmitted====
[[File:Clonorchis sinensis 2.png|thumb|''[[Clonorchis sinensis]]'', the Chinese liver fluke, is trophically transmitted]]

[[Trophic (disambiguation) | Trophic]]ally-transmitted parasites are transmitted by being eaten by a host. They include [[trematoda| trematodes]] (all except [[schistosoma| schistosomes]]), [[cestoda| cestodes]], [[acanthocephala]]ns, [[pentastomida| pentastomids]], many [[nematode |round worm]]s, and many protozoa such as ''[[Toxoplasma]]''.&lt;ref name=PoulinRandhawa2015/&gt; They have complex life-cycles involving hosts of two or more species. In their juvenile stages they infect and often [[encyst]] in the intermediate host. When the intermediate-host animal is eaten by a predator, the definitive host, the parasite survives the digestion process and matures into an adult; some live as [[intestinal parasite]]s. Many trophically-transmitted parasites [[Parasite increased trophic transmission |modify the behaviour]] of their intermediate hosts, increasing their chances of being eaten by a predator. As with directly transmitted parasites, the distribution of trophically transmitted parasites among host individuals is aggregated.&lt;ref name=PoulinRandhawa2015/&gt; [[Coinfection]] by multiple parasites is common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Cox |first1= F.

{{further|Vector (epidemiology)}}

[[Vector (epidemiology)|Vector-transmitted]] parasites rely on a third party, an intermediate host, where the parasite does not reproduce sexually&lt;ref name=Para-Site/&gt; to carry them from one definitive host to another.&lt;ref name=PoulinRandhawa2015/&gt; These parasites are microorganisms, namely [[protozoa]], [[bacteria]], or [[virus]]es, often intracellular [[pathogen]]s (disease-causers).&lt;ref name=PoulinRandhawa2015/&gt; Their vectors are mostly [[hematophagy| hematophagic]] [[arthropod]]s such as fleas, lice, ticks, and mosquitoes.&lt;ref name=PoulinRandhawa2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.peoi.org/Courses/Coursesen/phfoundation/contents/frame3a.html |title= Pathogenic Parasitic Infections |publisher= PEOI | accessdate= 18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the deer tick ''[[Ixodes scapularis]]'' acts as a vector for diseases including [[Lyme disease]], [[babesiosis]], and [[Human granulocytic anaplasmosis| anaplasmosis]].&lt;ref name=pmid11450660&gt;{{cite journal |author= Steere AC |title= Lyme disease |journal= [[New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume= 345 |issue= 2 |pages= 115–125 |date= July 2001 |pmid= 11450660 |doi=10.1056/NEJM200107123450207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Protozoan endoparasites, such as the [[malaria]]l parasites in the genus ''[[Plasmodium]]'' and sleeping-sickness parasites in the genus ''[[Trypanosoma]]'', have infective stages in the host's blood which are transported to new hosts by biting insects.&lt;ref name=&quot;PollittMacGregor2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Pollitt |first1= Laura C. |last2= MacGregor |first2= Paula |last3= Matthews |first3= Keith |last4= Reece |first4= Sarah E. |title= Malaria and trypanosome transmission: different parasites, same rules? |journal= Trends in Parasitology |volume= 27 |issue= 5 |year= 2011 |pages= 197–203 |doi= 10.1016/j.pt.2011.01.004|pmid= 21345732 |pmc= 3087881 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parasitoids====
{{main|Parasitoid|Parasitoid wasp}}

[[Parasitoid]]s are insects which sooner or later kill their hosts, placing their relationship close to predation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Stevens |first1= Alison N. P. |title= Predation, Herbivory, and Parasitism |journal= Nature Education Knowledge |date= 2010 |volume= 3 |issue= 10 |page= 36 |url= https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/predation-herbivory-and-parasitism-13261134 |accessdate= 12 February 2018 |quote= Predation, herbivory, and parasitism exist along a continuum of severity in terms of the extent to which they negatively affect an organism's fitness. ... In most situations, parasites do not kill their hosts. An exception, however, occurs with parasitoids, which blur the line between parasitism and predation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most parasitoids are [[parasitoid wasp]]s or other [[hymenoptera]]ns; others include [[fly| dipterans]] such as [[phoridae |phorid flies]]. They can be divided{{by whom?|date=October 2020}} into two groups, idiobionts and koinobionts, differing in their treatment of their hosts.&lt;ref name=GullanCranston2010&gt;{{cite book |last1= Gullan |first1= P. J. |last2= Cranston |first2= P. S. |date= 2010 |title= The Insects: An Outline of Entomology |url= https://archive.org/details/insectsoutlineen00pjgu |url-access= limited |publisher= Wiley |edition= 4th |isbn= 978-1-118-84615-5 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/insectsoutlineen00pjgu/page/n332 308], 365–367, 375, 440–441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Idiobiont]] parasitoids sting their often large prey on capture, either killing them outright or paralysing them immediately. The immobilised prey is then carried to a nest, sometimes alongside other prey if it is not large enough to support a parasitoid throughout its development. An [[oviposition |egg is laid]] on top of the prey and the nest is then sealed. The parasitoid develops rapidly through its larval and pupal stages, [[mass provisioning |feeding on the provisions]] left for it.&lt;ref name=GullanCranston2010/&gt;

[[Koinobiont]] parasitoids, which include [[Diptera |flies]] as well as wasps, lay their eggs inside young hosts, usually larvae. These are allowed to go on growing, so the host and parasitoid develop together for an extended period, ending when the parasitoids emerge as adults, leaving the prey dead, eaten from inside. Some koinobionts regulate their host's development, for example preventing it from [[pupa]]ting or making it [[ecdysis |moult]] whenever the parasitoid is ready to moult. They may do this by producing hormones that mimic the host's moulting hormones ([[ecdysteroid]]s), or by regulating the host's endocrine system.&lt;ref name=GullanCranston2010/&gt;

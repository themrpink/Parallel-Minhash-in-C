The Mind Sports Olympiad main event continued to happen but without sponsorship the tournaments were held at a number of different universities. The event was still going strong for the years 2001 - 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;ward&quot;&gt;David Ward, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/aug/22/davidward  ''Cerebral Athletes Play Mind Games''], ''[The Guardian]'', 22 August 2005, Retrieved 2 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The main 2004 event featured a separate event for schools, featuring competitions and activities in chess, Go, quizzes and intelligence puzzles. But in 2007 the Mind Sports Olympiad was reduced to a much smaller venue in Potters Bar due to no sponsorship and no advertising.&lt;ref name=&quot;potters&quot;&gt;Stephen Moss, [https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,2156846,00.html  ''This time it's Personal''], [[The Guardian]], 27 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the MSO saw a revival returning to a central London venue, the [[Royal Horticultural Halls]], [[Westminster]] and again on 21–31 August 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;venue09&quot;&gt;Information about venue for MSO XIII, http://www.boardability.com/mso/venue.html, 2 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 event was held at the Soho Theatre in London.&lt;ref name=&quot;venue10&quot;&gt;Account of MSO XIV, http://www.boardability.com/result.php?id=mso14 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226015813/http://www.boardability.com/result.php?id=mso14 |date=26 February 2012 }}, 15 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the Mind Sports Olympiad moved to a bigger venue, the University of London Union. The 16th MSO will take place once again at the University of London Union in 18–27 August 2012.

Over the last few years, MSO has been flourishing both at its satellite events and at the main event in London, which attracted almost 800 entries in 2011. MSO London is a truly global event, and the 2010 Pentamind World Champion Paco Garcia De La Banda hails from Spain, while the 2011 Pentamind World Champion Andres Kuusk is from Estonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://boardability.com/result.php?id=mso15 |title=Archived copy |access-date=21 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311042608/http://www.boardability.com/result.php?id=mso15 |archive-date=11 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most widely read chess magazine in the world, Chess Life, featured an article in February 2012 about in the inauguration of Diving Chess into the 2011 Mind Sports Olympiad.&lt;ref&gt;http://content.yudu.com/A1vdb5/ChessLifeFeb2012/resources/12.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Games at the MSO ==
The MSO consists mainly of single event competitions most of which are for the nominal title of Olympiad champion, though some trademarked games are authorised by the game designer and publishers as the [[World championship|official world championships]]. All games, whether an Olympiad or the official World championship, can count towards the Pentamind. Medals, and more recently trophies, are awarded for gold, silver and bronze positions in each competition as well as ranks, with similar awards for the top juniors in each event. In early Olympiads sponsorship allowed for generous financial prizes to go with many of the events. In recent years such prizes have been limited to a small number of events, usually as a result of specific outside sponsorship for that discipline.

Notable games include (most other refs mention some of these):&lt;ref&gt;List of games, http://www.boardability.com/games_az.html, Retrieved 2 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
The well-known: Chess, Bridge, Draughts, [[Shogi]], [[Backgammon]], [[Chinese Chess| Chinese Chess (Xiang-Qi)]], [[Reversi|Othello]], [[Poker]], [[Cribbage]], [[Mastermind (board game)|Mastermind]]

At MSO tournaments, the '''Decamentathlon''' is a composite event in which players compete in ten separate [[mind sport]]s. The following mental skills have always been part of the Decamentathlon: [[memory skills]], [[mental calculation]], [[IQ]], [[chess]], [[Go (board game)|Go]], [[Reversi|othello]], 8 by 8 [[draughts]], and [[creative thinking]]. MSO also organizes Mental Calculation World Championship separately. The remaining two mental skills have changed over the years and come from this list: [[contract bridge]], [[Backgammon]], [[Mastermind (board game)|Mastermind]], and most recently [[Sudoku]].

The MSO introduced the [[Abstract strategy game|Abstract Games]] world championship in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;abstract_games&quot;&gt;Article on abstract games world championships, http://www.boardability.com/game.php?abstract_games{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 15 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pentamind ==
This was one of the Mind Sports Olympiad's original events.&lt;ref name=&quot;times_mso1&quot;/&gt; It was an attempt along with the [[decamentathlon]] to produce an event for all-rounders to parallel the Olympic Games with its events the decamentathlon and pentathlon. Unlike the decamentathlon's fixed format (see separate article) the pentamind has very little fixed format. It disallows using games that are considered too similar and normally requires a long event, but otherwise any five
events from the schedule could be used.

The Pentamind champion is the player with the highest numerical score in &quot;pentamind points&quot; from 5 valid events. 
This is calculated using the formula 100 x (n - p) / (n - 1), where n is the number of players and p is the player's position in an event.&lt;ref name=&quot;ward&quot; /&gt; The position is the position before tie-breaks and any split positions are shared amongst all of the tied players. When there are fewer than 10 players in a tournament, the score is multiplied by a secondary factor [p / (p + 1)].

=== Pentamind World Champions ===
This event has been won five times by [[Demis Hassabis]].&lt;ref&gt;MSO pentamind results, http://www.boardability.com/result.php?id=pentamind {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708075057/http://www.boardability.com/result.php?id=pentamind |date=8 July 2011 }} Retrieved 6 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure of the Organisation==
When the MSO was initially formed in 1997, the board running it included [[David Levy (chess player)|David Levy]], [[Tony Buzan]], and [[Raymond Keene]], David Levy being the original founder of the MSO concept. The current (2012) board consists of David Levy, Tony Corfe and [[Etan Ilfeld]]. The Mind Sports Olympiad is run by MSO Limited, which is registered in the UK with company number 04712990, and was incorporated in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/2f881e1264ce3e0f00e3c4b110e247b5/compdetails&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''respiratory therapist''' is a specialized [[healthcare professional|healthcare practitioner]] trained in critical care and cardio-pulmonary medicine in order to work therapeutically with people suffering from acute critical conditions, cardiac and pulmonary disease.  Respiratory therapists graduate from a college or university with a degree in respiratory therapy and have passed a national board certifying examination.  The NBRC (National Board for Respiratory Care) is the not-for-profit organization responsible for credentialing the seven areas of Respiratory Therapy in the United States.

Those seven areas of Respiratory Therapy include, as of December 2017: CRT (Certified Respiratory Therapist), RRT (Registered Respiratory Therapist), CPFT and RPFT (Certified or Registered Pulmonary Function Technologist), ACCS (Adult Critical Care Specialist), NPS (Neonatal/Pediatric Specialist), and SDS (Sleep Disorder Specialist).

Respiratory therapists work in hospitals in the intensive care units (Adult, Pediatric, and Neonatal), on hospital floors, in Emergency Departments, in Pulmonary Functioning laboratories (PFTs), are able to intubate patients, work in sleep labs (polysomnograpy) (PSG) labs, and in home care specifically DME (Durable Medical Equipment) and home oxygen.

Respiratory therapists are specialists and educators in many areas including [[cardiology]], [[pulmonology]], and sleep therapy.  Respiratory therapists are clinicians trained in advanced [[airway management]]; establishing and maintaining the airway during management of trauma, and intensive care.

Respiratory therapists initiate and manage [[life support]] for people in intensive care units and emergency departments, stabilizing, treating and managing pre-hospital and hospital-to-hospital patient transport by air or ground ambulance.

In the outpatient setting respiratory therapists work as educators in asthma clinics, ancillary clinical staff in pediatric clinics, and sleep-disorder diagnosticians in sleep-clinics, they also serve as clinical providers in cardiology clinics and cath-labs, as well as working in pulmonary rehabilitation.

== Clinical practice ==
[[File:Respiratory therapist.jpg|thumb|Respiratory Therapist in an intensive care unit]]
;Intensive care and operating room
Respiratory therapists educate, assist in diagnosis, and treat people who are suffering from heart and lung problems.  Specialized in both cardiac and pulmonary care, Respiratory Therapists often collaborate with specialists in [[pulmonology]] and [[anaesthesia]] in various aspects of clinical care of patients. Respiratory therapists provide a vital role in both [[medicine]] and [[nursing]]. A vital role in ICU is the initiation and maintenance of mechanical ventilation and the care of artificial airways.

;Outpatient clinical practice
Respiratory therapists are also primary clinicians in conducting tests to measure lung function and teaching people to manage [[asthma]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder]] among other cardiac and lung functions.

Internationally, Respiratory Therapists that provide lung function testing are termed respiratory scientists, but in North America, they may be a Respiratory Therapist.

;Home-health care
Outside of clinics and hospitals, Respiratory Therapists often manage home oxygen needs of patients and their families, providing around the clock support for home ventilators and other equipment for conditions like [[sleep apnea]].

In the clinic or outpatient setting Respiratory Therapists assist with diagnosis and serve as an educator for patients suffering from cardiac and respiratory illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=PCC Notes: Respiratory students train |url=http://www.reflector.com/news/pcc-notes-respiratory-students-train-759223 |newspaper=The Reflector |accessdate=6 November 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805102852/http://www.reflector.com/news/pcc-notes-respiratory-students-train-759223 |archivedate=5 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   In the [[United States]], Respiratory Therapists with certification as [[Registered Respiratory Therapist]]s evaluate and treat patients with a great deal of autonomy under the direction of a [[pulmonologist]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19558737&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Harbrecht BG, Delgado E, Tuttle RP, Cohen-Melamed MH, Saul MI, Valenta CA | title=Improved outcomes with routine Respiratory Therapist evaluation of non-intensive-care-unit surgery patients.  | journal=[[Respiratory Care (journal)|Respiratory Care]] | year= 2009 | volume= 54 | issue= 7 | pages= 861–7 | pmid=19558737 | doi= 10.4187/002013209793800457| pmc= | url= https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3068929a838136428e20baa0105bfb7d14584b69}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In facilities that maintain critical care transport teams Respiratory Therapists are a preferred addition to all types of [[Ambulance|surface]] or [[Air medical services|air transport]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10130326&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=O'Malley RJ, Rhee KJ | title=Contribution of air medical personnel to the airway management of injured patients.  | journal=Air Med J | year= 1993 | volume= 12 | issue= 11–12 | pages= 425–8 | pmid=10130326 | doi=10.1016/S1067-991X(05)80138-5 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=10130326  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Public education 
In other settings Respiratory Therapists are found in schools as asthma educators, working with teachers and coaches about childhood symptoms of asthma and how to spot an emergency. In the United States, legislation has been introduced several times to allow Respiratory Therapists certified as asthma specialists with registered Respiratory Therapist certification to prescribe and manage previously diagnosed respiratory patients in physician clinics.&lt;ref name=&quot;112th Congress 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-941&amp;tab=summary |title=H.R. 941 |accessdate=August 28, 2011 |author=112th Congress (2011) |date=Mar 8, 2011 |work=Legislation |publisher=GovTrack.us |quote=Medicare Respiratory Therapy Initiative Act of 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122451/http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-941&amp;tab=summary |archivedate=November 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;110th Congress 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-3968 |title=H.R. 3968 |accessdate=August 28, 2011 |author=110th Congress (2007) |date=Oct 25, 2007 |work=Legislation |publisher=GovTrack.us |quote=Medicare Respiratory Therapy Initiative Act of 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122145/http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-3968 |archivedate=November 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In sleep clinics, Respiratory Therapists work with physicians in the diagnosis of sleep-related illnesses.   Respiratory Therapists in the United States are migrating toward a role with autonomy similar to the [[nurse practitioner]], or as an extension of the physician like the [[physician assistant]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16168918&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Shelledy DC, Wiezalis CP | title=Education and credentialing in respiratory care: where are we and where should we be headed? | journal=[[Respiratory Care Clinics of North America (journal)|Respiratory Care Clinics of North America]] | year= 2005 | volume= 11 | issue= 3 | pages= 517–30 | pmid=16168918 | doi=10.1016/j.rcc.2005.04.003 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=16168918  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Respiratory Therapists are frequently utilized as complete cardiovascular specialists being utilized to place and manage arterial accesses along with peripherally-inserted central catheters.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10813223&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rowley DD, Mayo DF, Durbin CG |title=Initial experience with a Respiratory Therapist arterial line placement service |journal=[[Respiratory Care (journal)|Respiratory Care]] |volume=45 |issue=5 |pages=482–5 |date=May 2000 |pmid=10813223 |doi= |url= |issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Pulmonary rehabilitation
[[Pulmonary rehabilitation]] may be initiated as a treatment as a source for continuity of improvement after a hospital stay or as a therapeutic way to increase quality of life.   Pulmonary rehabilitation is intended to educate the patient, the family, and improve the overall quality of life and [[prognosis]] for the patient.   Pulmonary Rehabilitation involves therapies and evaluations by Respiratory Therapists, [[Occupational Therapist]]s and [[Physical Therapist]]s.

== Credentialing and licensure ==

=== United States and Canada ===
In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], Respiratory Therapists are healthcare practitioners who, after receiving at least an Associate of Science in Respiratory Care, complete a credentialing process.

After satisfactorily completing the required examinations and being added to a registry, the practitioner is then eligible to apply for a license to practice in the region governed by their respective licensing body.

In the [[United States]], specialist Respiratory Therapists are clinicians who hold National Board for Respiratory Care specialty credentials, which may include neonatal/pediatric specialist (CRT-NPS or RRT-NPS), adult critical care specialist (RRT-ACCS), sleep disorder specialist (CRT-SDS or RRT-SDS), and pulmonary function technologist (CPFT or RPFT). The NBRC's RRT-ACCS examination is the newest NBRC examination: it was introduced in 2012.

Professional credentials denoted as a Certified Asthma Educator (AE-C) may also be earned by passing the National Asthma Educator Certification Board (NAECB).

In some parts of Canada, one may practice as a Provisional Respiratory Therapist after graduating, until writing and passing the CBRC exam. In Canada, similar credentialing and advanced training exists.

== International respiratory care ==
Except for the United States and Canada, very few countries have a dedicated professional role for respiratory health. In these countries, respiratory care is provided by physiotherapists, nurses and physicians that have chosen to specialize in this field.  In many countries this recognition is in a transition stage; as an example, in 2011, hospitals in [[Beijing, China]] began a recruitment drive to acquire Respiratory Therapists for their intensive care units where previously nurses were the only clinician.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid22005194&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li J, Zhan QY, Liang ZA, Tu ML, Sun B, Yao XL, etal | title=Respiratory Care Practices and Requirement for Respiratory Therapists in Beijing ICUs.  | journal=[[Respiratory Care (journal)|Respiratory Care]] | year= 2011 | volume=  57| issue=  3| pages=  370–6| pmid=22005194 | doi=10.4187/respcare.01093 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=22005194  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
Upon graduation from an accredited school of respiratory therapy, the graduate is then eligible to write the national exam administered by the [[Canadian Board for Respiratory Care]].

Success on this examination will then allow the Respiratory Therapist to register with any licensing body in Canada.  Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec and Saskatchewan are the Canadian provinces with provincial licensing bodies; in these provinces, it is illegal to practice the profession of Respiratory Care without first being licensed as a full or provisional member with the provincial licensing body.

These provinces are so-called regulated provinces.  In some provinces, one may work provisionally upon graduating, until writing and passing the exam. In all other jurisdictions, the licensing body for the profession of Respiratory Care is the [[Canadian Society for Respiratory Therapy]].

Registration as a full member is optional for Respiratory Therapists living in regulated provinces, however, for Respiratory Therapists living in non-regulated provinces, registration as a full member with the CSRT is compulsory.  Registration with the provincial regulatory body or the CSRT (in non-regulated provinces) confers upon the Respiratory Therapist the title of Registered Respiratory Therapist (RRT). Canada and the United States recognize each their cardio-pulmonary education structure as equal, however, a qualifying exam must be written in order to practice in either nation.

There is pressure for the program to become a degree, like other therapies ([[Physical Therapy]], [[Occupational Therapy]]) now require a master's degree or greater.  However, in some places such as [[Alberta]], Canada the cardio-pulmonary course work is only offered at technical schools that are unable to grant a formal degree.

=== France ===
Respiratory therapy is a sub-specialty of [[physical therapy]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;World Confederation for Physical Therapy. Federation Francaise des Masseurs Kinesitherapeutes Reeducateurs&lt;/ref&gt;   Respiratory care as a specialty is regulated by the Fédération Française des Masseurs Kinésithérapeutes Rééducateurs.

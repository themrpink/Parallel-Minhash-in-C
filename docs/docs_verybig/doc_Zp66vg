{{optical disc authoring}}
'''Video CD''' (abbreviated as '''VCD''', and also known as '''Compact Disc Digital Video''') is a [[home video]] format and the first format for distributing films on standard {{convert|120|mm|abbr=on}} optical discs.  The format was widely adopted in [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Middle East]], superseding the [[VHS]] and [[Betamax]] systems in the regions until [[DVD-Video]] finally became affordable in the late 2000s.

The format is a standard [[digital data]] format for storing [[video]] on a [[compact disc]]. VCDs are playable in dedicated VCD players and widely playable in most [[DVD player]]s, [[personal computer]]s and some [[video game console]]s. However, they are less playable in some [[Blu-ray Disc]] players, [[vehicle audio]] with DVD/Blu-ray support and video game consoles such as the Sony [[PlayStation]] and [[Xbox]] due to lack of support [[backward compatibility]] for the older [[MPEG-1]] format or inability to read MPEG-1 in [[.dat]] files alongside MPEG-1 in standard MPEG-1 files.

The Video CD standard was created in 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Hardware and Software Get an Early Start |url=http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-21/h5.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625232554/http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-21/h5.html |publisher=[[Sony]] |access-date=2008-02-13 |archive-date=June 25, 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Super Video Compact Disc, A Technical Explanation (PDF) |url=http://www.ip.philips.com/view_attachment/2450/sl00812.pdf |pages=2 |year=1998 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080528131354/http://www.ip.philips.com/view_attachment/2450/sl00812.pdf |publisher=[[Philips]] System Standards and Licensing |access-date=2008-02-13 |archive-date=2008-05-28 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
by [[Sony]], [[Philips]], [[Panasonic|Matsushita]] and [[JVC]], it is referred to as the [[White Book (CD standard)|White Book]] standard.

Although they have been superseded by other media, {{asof|lc=true|2020}} VCDs continue to be retailed as a low-cost video format.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

==Brief history==
{{accuracy-section|date=January 2020}}
[[LaserDisc]] was first available on the market, in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], on December 15, 1978.&lt;ref name=&quot;CED magic&quot;&gt;{{Citation |title=1979: The VideoDisc Is Here! |url=http://www.cedmagic.com/history/discovision-marketed.html |work=History of Media Technology |publisher=CED magic |access-date=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This {{convert|30|cm|abbr=on}} disc could hold an hour of analog audio and video (digital audio was added a few years later) on each side. The LaserDisc provided picture quality nearly double that of VHS tape and analog audio quality far superior to VHS.

Philips later teamed up with [[Sony]] to develop a new type of disc, the [[compact disc]] or CD. Introduced in 1982 in Japan (1983 in the U.S. and Europe), the CD is about {{convert|120|mm|abbr=on}} in diameter, and is single-sided. The format was initially designed to store digitized sound and proved to be a success in the music industry.

A few years later, Philips decided to give CDs the ability to produce video, utilizing the same technology as its LaserDisc counterpart. This led to the creation of [[CD Video]] (CD-V) in 1987. However, the disc's small size significantly impeded the ability to store analog video; thus only 5 minutes of picture information could fit on the disc's surface (despite the fact that the audio was digital). Therefore, CD-V distribution was limited to featuring music videos, and it was soon discontinued by 1991.

By the early 1990s engineers were able to digitize and compress video signals, greatly improving storage efficiency.  Because this new format could hold 74/80 minutes of audio and video on a 650/700MB disc, releasing movies on compact discs finally became a reality. Extra capacity was obtained by sacrificing the [[error correction]] &lt;!-- Mode 2 Form 2 recording ---&gt; (it was believed that minor errors in the datastream would go unnoticed by the viewer). This format was named Video CD or VCD.

[[File:Copy Protected VCD.jpg|thumb|“Copy Protected” logo on a VCD package produced in [[Hong Kong]].]]
VCD enjoyed a brief period of success, with a few major feature films being released in the format (usually as a 2 disc set). However the introduction of the CD-R disc and associated recorders stopped the release of feature films in their tracks because the VCD format had no means of preventing unauthorized (and perfect) copies from being made.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} However, {{asof|lc=true|2013}} VCDs are still being released in several countries in Asia, but now with copy-protection.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

The development of more sophisticated, higher capacity optical disc formats yielded the [[DVD]] format, released only a few years later with a copy protection mechanism. DVD players use lasers that are of shorter wavelength than those used on CDs, allowing the recorded pits to be smaller, so that more information can be stored. The DVD was so successful that it eventually pushed VHS out of the video market once suitable recorders became widely available. Nevertheless, VCDs made considerable inroads into developing nations, where they are still in use today due to their cheaper manufacturing and retail costs.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

== Technical specifications ==

===Structure===
Video CDs comply with the [[CD-i Bridge]] format, and are [[Optical disc authoring|authored]] using tracks in [[CD-ROM XA]] mode. The first track of a VCD is in CD-ROM XA Mode 2 Form 1, and stores metadata and menu information inside an [[ISO 9660]] [[filesystem]]. This track may also contain other non-essential files, and is shown by operating systems when loading the disc. This track can be absent from a VCD, which would still work but would not allow it to be properly displayed in computers.&lt;ref name=&quot;mplayer&quot; /&gt;

The rest of the tracks are usually in CD-ROM XA Mode 2 Form 2 and contain video and audio [[Multiplexing#Video processing|multiplexed]] in an [[MPEG program stream]] (MPEG-PS) container, but [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD audio]] tracks are also allowed.&lt;ref name=&quot;mplayer&quot; /&gt; Using Mode 2 Form 2 allows roughly 800 megabytes of VCD data to be stored on one 80 minute CD (versus 700 megabytes when using CD-ROM Mode 1).  This is achieved by sacrificing the error correction redundancy present in Mode 1.  It was considered that small errors in the video and audio stream pass largely unnoticed.  This, combined with the net bitrate of VCD video and audio, means that almost exactly 80 minutes of VCD content can be stored on an 80-minute CD, 74 minutes of VCD content on a 74-minute CD, and so on. This was done in part to ensure compatibility with existing CD drive technology, specifically the earliest &quot;1x&quot; speed CD drives.

===Video===

Video specifications&lt;ref name=&quot;icdia.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.icdia.co.uk/cdprosupport/encoding/pink/mpeg1_specs.htm|title=MPEG1 Specifications|work=icdia.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Compression: [[MPEG-1]]
* [[Aspect Ratio]]: 4:3
* Resolution:
** [[NTSC]]: 352×240
** [[PAL]]/[[SECAM]]: 352×288
* Framerate:
** [[NTSC]]: 29.97 ''or'' 23.976 frames per second
** [[PAL]]/[[SECAM]]: 25 frames per second
* Bitrate: 1,150 [[kilobit]]s per second
** Rate Control: [[constant bitrate]]

Although many DVD video players support playback of VCDs, VCD video is only compatible with the [[DVD-Video]] standard if encoded at 29.97 frames per second or 25 frames per second. &lt;!-- This statement refers to the video ONLY.  Incompatibilities caused by the 44,100 Hz audio are discussed in the audio section --&gt;

The 352×240 and 352×288 (or [[Source Input Format|SIF]]) resolutions were chosen because it is half the horizontal and vertical resolution of NTSC video, and half the horizontal resolution of PAL (the vertical resolution of PAL already being half of the 576 active lines). This is approximately half the resolution of an analog VHS tape which is ~330 horizontal and 480 vertical (NTSC) or 330×576 (PAL).

===Audio===

Audio specifications&lt;ref name=&quot;icdia.co.uk&quot; /&gt;
* Compression: [[MPEG-1 Audio Layer II]]
* Sample Frequency: 44,100 [[hertz]] (44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz)
* Output: Dual channel, [[stereo]], or Dolby Surround
* Bitrate: 224 [[kilobit]]s per second
** Rate Control: [[Constant bitrate]]

As with most CD-based formats, VCD audio is incompatible with the [[DVD-Video]] standard due to a difference in sampling frequency; DVDs require 48&amp;nbsp;kHz, whereas VCDs use 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz.

===Advantages of compression===
By compressing both the video and audio streams, a VCD is able to hold 74 minutes of picture and sound information, nearly the same duration as a standard 74 minute audio CD. The MPEG-1 compression used records mostly the differences between successive video frames, rather than write out each frame individually. Similarly, the audio frequency range is limited to those sounds most clearly heard by the human ear.

===Other features===
[[File:Return button on vcd player.JPG|thumb|PlayBack Control (PBC) added in VCD 2.0 requires a special 'Return' button]]
The VCD standard also features the option of DVD-quality still images/slide shows with audio, at resolutions of 704×480 (NTSC) or 704×576 (PAL/SECAM). Version 2.0 also adds the playback control (PBC), featuring a simple menu like DVD-Video.

== Similar formats ==

=== CD-i Digital Video ===
Shortly before the advent of White Book VCD, Philips started releasing movies in the [[Green Book (CD-interactive standard)|Green Book]] [[CD-i]] format, calling the subformat CD-i Digital Video (CD-i DV). While these used a similar format (MPEG-1), due to minor differences between the standards these discs are not compatible with VCD players. Philips' CD-i players with the Full Motion Video MPEG-1 decoder cartridge would play both formats. Approximately 30 CD-i DV titles were released before the company switched to the current VCD format for publishing movies in 1994.

=== XVCD ===
'''XVCD''' (eXtended Video CD) is the name generally given to any format that stores MPEG-1 video on a compact disc in CD-ROM XA Mode 2 Form 2, but does not strictly follow the VCD standard in terms of the encoding of the video or audio.

A normal VCD is encoded to MPEG-1 at a constant bit rate (CBR), so all scenes are required to use exactly the same data rate, regardless of complexity. However, video on an XVCD is typically encoded at a variable bit rate (VBR), so complex scenes can use a much higher data rate for a short time, while simpler scenes will use lower data rates. Some XVCDs use lower bitrates in order to fit longer videos onto the disc, while others use higher bitrates to improve quality. MPEG-2 may be used instead of MPEG-1.

To further reduce the data rate without significantly reducing quality, the size of the [[Group of pictures|GOP]] can be increased, a different MPEG-1 [[quantization (image processing)#Quantization matrices|quantization matrix]] can be used, the maximum data rate can be exceeded, and the bit rate of the MP2 audio can be reduced or even be swapped out completely for MP3 audio. These changes can be advantageous for those who want to either maximize video quality, or use fewer discs.

=== KVCD ===
'''KVCD''' (K Video Compression Dynamics) is an XVCD variant that requires the use of a [[software patent|proprietary]] [[quantization matrix]], available for non-commercial use. KVCD is notable because the specification recommends a non-standard resolution of 528×480 or 528×576. KVCDs encoded at this resolution are only playable by computers with CD-ROM drives, and a small number of DVD players.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = DVD Compatibility Chart | date= February 25, 2007 | url = http://www.kvcd.net/portal/articles.php?lng=en&amp;pg=19 | access-date = 2008-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DVCD ===
'''DVCD''' or Double VCD is a method to accommodate longer videos on a CD. A non-standard CD is [[overburn]]ed to include up to 100 minutes of video. However, some CD-ROM drives and players have problems reading these CDs, mostly because the groove spacing is outside specifications and the player's laser servo is unable to track it.

=== DVI ===
'''DVI''' ([[Digital Video Interactive]]) is a compression technique that stored 72 minutes of video on a [[CD-ROM]]. In 1998, [[Intel]] acquired the technology from [[RCA]]'s Sarnoff Research Labs. DVI never caught on.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Definition of: DVI| url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,1237,t=DVI&amp;i=42144,00.asp | work=PC Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SVCD===
[[Super Video CD]] is a format intended to be the successor of VCD, offering better quality of image and sound.

== Adoption ==

===In North America===
Video CDs were unable to gain acceptance as a mainstream format in North America, chiefly because the established VHS format was less expensive, offered comparable video quality, and could be recorded over.&lt;ref name=&quot;NGen3&quot;/&gt; The advent of [[CD-R|recordable CDs]], inexpensive recorders, and compatible DVD players spurred VCD acceptance in the US in the late 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;ref name=nytfoothold&gt;{{citation| first = Scot | last = Meyer | title =  Versatile Video CD's Get a Foothold in U.S. | date=April 26, 2001 |work= [[New York Times]] | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/26/technology/versatile-video-cd-s-get-a-foothold-in-us.html| access-date = 2008-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, DVD burners and DVD-Video recorders were available by that time, and equipment and media costs for making DVD-Video fell rapidly. DVD-Video, with its longer run time and much higher quality, quickly overshadowed VCD in areas that could afford it. In addition many early DVD players could not read recordable (CD-R) media,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Hugh |last=Bennett |title=DVD-ROM and CD-R: the compatibility question answered - includes related article on reading mixed media |date=March 1998 |publisher=Emedia Professional |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FXG/is_n3_v11/ai_20324077 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712150805/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FXG/is_n3_v11/ai_20324077 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-12 |access-date=2008-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and this limited the compatibility of home-made VCDs. Almost every modern stand-alone DVD-Video player can play VCDs burned on recordable media.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}

===In Asia===
[[File:VCD and DVD Stock.jpg|thumb|250px|right|As of 2014, VCDs and DVDs are the norm for home media in the [[Philippines]]. Blu-ray discs are also available but are only displayed at small separate shelves at the counter.]]
The VCD format was very popular throughout [[Asia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Junko | last = Yoshida | title = Video CD: China one, West zero | date = December 1999 | work = [[EE Times]] | url = http://www.eetimes.com/special/special_issues/millennium/milestones/baichuan.html | access-date = 2008-02-12 | archive-url = https://archive.today/20050409025119/http://www.eetimes.com/special/special_issues/millennium/milestones/baichuan.html | archive-date = 2005-04-09 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
(except Japan and South Korea) in the late 1990s through the 2000s, with 8 million VCD players sold in China in 1997 alone,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = George | last = Leopold | first2 = Junko | last2 =Yoshida | title = Chinese supplier preps low-cost digital TVs for U.S. market | date=January 13, 1999 | publisher = [[EE Times]] | url = http://www.eetimes.com/story/OEG19990113S0009 | access-date = 2008-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and more than half of all Chinese households owning at least one VCD player by 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Chinese families double their incomes in 10 years | date=January 12, 2005 | publisher = [[China Daily]] | url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-01/12/content_408150.htm | access-date = 2008-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, popularity has declined over the years, as the number of [[Hong Kong]] factories that produced VCDs dropped from 98 in 1999 to 26 in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1082521/customs-criticised-pursuit-outdated-cd-and-vcd-piracy |title=Customs criticised for pursuit of outdated CD and VCD piracy |work=South China Morning Post |date= 15 November 2012 |author=Amy Nip and Phila Siu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This popularity was due, in part, to most households not already owning VHS players when VCDs were introduced, the low price of the players, their tolerance of high humidity (a notable problem for VCRs), easy storage and maintenance, and the lower-cost media.&lt;ref name=nytfoothold/&gt; Western sources have cited unauthorized content as a principal incentive for VCD player ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Elisabeth  | last = Rosenthal | title = Counterfeiters Turn Magic Into Cash | date=November 25, 2001 | work = [[New York Times]] | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06EED7133AF936A15752C1A9679C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 | access-date = 2008-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytgrinch&gt;{{Citation | first = Craig S.  | last = Smith | title = A Tale of Piracy: How the Chinese Stole the Grinch | date=December 12, 2000 | work = [[New York Times]] | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E0DD123FF931A25751C1A9669C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all  | access-date = 2008-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Seth | last = Faison | title = China Turns Blind Eye to Pirated Disks | date=March 28, 1998 | work = [[New York Times]] | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E1D7143BF93BA15750C0A96E958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all  | access-date = 2008-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

VCDs are often produced and sold in Asian countries and regions, such as Mainland [[China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]],
[[Brunei Darussalam]], [[Myanmar]], [[Indonesia]], [[Philippines]], [[Vietnam]], [[India]], [[Turkey]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]]. In many Asian countries, major Hollywood studios (and Asian home video distributors) have licensed companies to officially produce and distribute the VCDs, such as [[Music Corporation of America|MCA Home Video]] in [[Pakistan]], Intercontinental Video Ltd. of Hong Kong, Sunny Video in Malaysia, Vision Interprima Pictures in Indonesia, CVD International and Pacific Marketing and Entertainment Group in Thailand, Excel Home Video in India, Berjaya-HVN and InnoForm Media in both Malaysia and Singapore, Scorpio East Entertainment in Singapore, as well as VIVA Video, Magnavision Home Video, and C-Interactive Digital Entertainment in the Philippines. Legal Video CDs can often be found in established video stores and major book outlets in most Asian countries.  They are typically packaged in jewel cases like commercial CDs, though higher-profile films may be released in [[keep case]]s, differentiated by the VCD logo.

In Asia, the use of VCDs as carriers for [[karaoke]] music is very common.  One channel would feature a mono track with music and singing, another channel a pure instrumental version for karaoke singing.  Prior to this, karaoke music was carried on [[laserdisc]]s.

===Worldwide trends===
VCD's growth has slowed in areas that can afford [[DVD-Video]], which offers most of the same advantages, as well as better picture quality&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Low DVD Prices to Drive up Sales | date=September 5, 2001 | publisher = [[People's Daily]] | url = http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/english/200109/05/eng20010905_79358.html | access-date = 2008-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
(higher resolution with fewer digital compression artifacts) due to its larger storage capacity. However, VCD has simultaneously seen significant new growth in emerging economies like [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[South America]] and [[Africa]] as a low-cost alternative to DVD. As of 2004, the worldwide popularity of VCD was increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = ESS Technology, Inc. 2003 Annual Report (PDF) | year = 2004 | publisher = [[ESS Technology]] | url = http://www.esstech.com/IR/Archive_PDF/03bus.pdf | pages = 3 | access-date = 2008-02-17 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060314054929/http://www.esstech.com/IR/Archive_PDF/03bus.pdf | archive-date = 2006-03-14 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = ESS product to vie with VCD players | date=August 10, 2004 | publisher = [[People's Daily]] | url = http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200408/10/eng20040810_152444.html | access-date = 2008-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall picture quality is intended to be comparable to [[VHS]] video.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Leonardo |last=Chiariglione |title=MPEG Press Release, London, 6 November 1992 |date=November 6, 1992 |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]] |url=http://www.chiariglione.org/mpeg/meetings/london/london_press.htm |access-date=2008-03-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108160634/http://www.chiariglione.org//mpeg/meetings/london/london_press.htm |archive-date=November 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Poorly [[Video compression|compressed]] VCD video can sometimes be of lower quality than VHS video, for example exhibiting VCD block artifacts&lt;ref name=&quot;NGen4&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=Correction |journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=4|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=April 1995|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; (rather than the analog noise seen in VHS sources), but does not deteriorate further with each use. Producing video CDs involves stripping out high- and low-frequency sounds from the video, resulting in lower audio quality than VHS.&lt;ref name=&quot;NGen4&quot;/&gt; While both formats need fast-forwarding to find certain scenes, rewinding to the beginning upon reaching the end is not required in VCD. The resolution is just half below that of common VHS resolution.

Video CDs do not come with [[closed caption]]ing (on-screen text to aid viewers with hearing problems). When watching a film that exceeds 74 minutes (nearly 1¼ hours), which is the maximum video capacity of one disc, a viewer has to change the disc upon reaching halfway (unless the discs are played on a VCD changer that can hold multiple discs and play them automatically in succession), whereas a single VHS tape can hold 3½ hours of continuous video (though as of 2014, 10-hour VHS tapes are available).

==Compared with DVD==
[[File:Three-disc VCD Title.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Films released on VCD can come on as many as 3 discs, depending on the length of the film. Cases of VCDs are shaped like those of audio CDs. DVD and Blu-ray cases, however, favor height over width.]]
When playing a DVD, the viewer is brought to a main menu which gives them options (watch the feature film, view &quot;deleted scenes&quot;, play some special applications, etc.). VCDs are usually straightforward, playing them often goes directly to the video with extras (mostly trailers and commercials) taking place before or after it, like on a VHS cassette.

Subtitles are found on many Asian VCDs but cannot be removed, unlike DVDs. The subtitles are embedded on the video during the encoding process (&quot;[[hardsub]]bed&quot;).  It is not uncommon to find a VCD with subtitles for two languages.

Though the VCD technology can support it, most films carried on VCDs do not contain chapters, requiring the viewer to fast-forward to resume the program after playback has been stopped. This is mostly because VCD technology is able to start playback at a chapter point but there is nothing to signal the player that the chapter has changed during a program. This can be confusing for the user as the player will indicate that it is still playing chapter 1 when it has played through to chapter 2 or later. Pressing the Next button would cause playback from the beginning of chapter 2. However, preview material is sometimes stored in a separate chapter, followed by a single chapter for the film.

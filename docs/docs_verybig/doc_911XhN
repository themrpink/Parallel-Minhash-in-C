===Production systems===
Production systems are made mainly through [[Comau|Comau S.p.A.]] (now Comau Systems), which bought the American Pico, Renault Automation and Sciaky and produces industrial automation systems. In the 1970s and 1980s, the company became a pioneer in the use of industrial robotics for the assembly of motor vehicles. Fiat assembly plants are among the best automated and advanced in the world.

===Services===
An insurance company, Toro Assicurazioni, allowed Fiat to control a relevant part of this market (also with minor companies like [[Lloyd Italico]]) and to interact with some associated banks. Toro Assicurazioni was acquired by the giant insurance company [[Assicurazioni Generali]] and is no longer part of the Fiat Group.

====Construction====
Ingest Facility and Fiat Engineering work in various fields of construction, while IPI is a mediation company that also deals with the management of real estate properties.

====Aviation and motorcycles====
[[File:Italian G-91T.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat G91T training aircraft]]
{{Main|Fiat Aviazione|Avio|Piaggio Aero}}

Fiat, as Fiat Aviazione, was an important aircraft manufacturer, focused mainly on military aviation. After World War I, Fiat consolidated several Italian small aircraft manufacturers, like [[Fabbrica Aeroplani Ing. O. Pomilio|Pomilio]] and [[Gio. Ansaldo &amp; C.|Ansaldo]]. Most famous were Fiat biplane [[fighter aircraft]] of the 1930s, [[Fiat CR.32]] and [[Fiat CR.42]]. Other notable designs were fighters [[Fiat CR.20|CR.20]], [[Fiat G.50|G.50]], [[Fiat G.55|G.55]] and a bomber, the [[Fiat BR.20]]. In the 1950s, the company designed the [[Aeritalia G.91|G.91]] light ground attack plane. In 1969, Fiat Aviazione merged with [[Aerfer]] to create [[Aeritalia]].

In 1959, [[Piaggio]] came under the control of the Agnelli family. In 1964, the aeronautical and motorcycle divisions split to become independent companies. The aeronautical division was named IAM Rinaldo Piaggio. Today the aeronautical company [[Piaggio Aero]] is controlled by the family of [[Piero Ferrari]], which also holds 10% of the carmaker [[Ferrari]].

{{main|Vespa}}
The motorcycle division, Vespa, thrived until 1992, when Giovanni Alberto Agnelli became CEO—but Agnelli was already suffering from cancer, and died in 1997. In 1999, [[Morgan Grenfell|Morgan Grenfell Private Equity]] acquired Piaggio.

[[File:Fiat artillery tractor in Horseless Age v43 n4 1918-02-15 p50.png|thumb|Fiat [[artillery tractor]] in the journal ''Horseless Age'', 1918.]]

====Weapons====
Fiat built [[artillery tractor]]s for the French and Italian armies in [[World War I]].

''Società Anonima Fabbrica Armi Torino'' (SAFAT) was a wholly owned subsidiary of FIAT in the 1930s, designing and manufacturing weapons for the Italian armed forces. After losing a competition to produce a series of new machine-guns for the [[Regia Aeronautica]], SAFAT was sold to the winning competitor – [[Società Italiana Ernesto Breda]], forming [[Breda-SAFAT]].

====Rail transport====
[[Fiat Ferroviaria]]'s history goes back to before World War II, when Fiat provided motive power used for both Diesel and electric locomotives and [[railcar]]s (''littorine'') not only in Italy, but other parts of Europe, and in South America. Fiat produced, among the rest, the successful [[Pendolino]] [[tilting train]]s, the first working prototype four-car set being run in the mid-1970s.

Fiat Ferroviaria was later sold to [[Alstom]] in 2000.

====Recreation====
The Fiat Group owned the [[Sestriere]] skiing facilities; the village in the [[Alps]] is a creation of the Agnelli family. The Sestriere skiing facilities were sold by the group in 2006.

==Enterprises outside Italy==
''See [[list of Fiat Group assembly sites]]''

Fiat was a key player in developing motor industries for a number of countries from the 1950s, particularly in Eastern Europe, Spain, Egypt, Ethiopia and Turkey. The [[AutoVAZ]] state works [[Lada]] products in Tolyatti (Togliatti), Russia, were Fiat based, as were SEAT products of Spain. Lada is now controlled by [[Renault]], and SEAT by [[Volkswagen]]. A small number of Fiats were built in Bulgaria. Among Fiat's earliest foreign assembly plants was one in [[Poughkeepsie, New York]], between 1910 and 1917.&lt;ref name=HAG1&gt;{{ cite web | url = https://www.hagerty.com/articles-videos/articles/2018/05/22/when-fiat-built-cars-in-america | title = For a brief spell, Fiat built cars in America | first = Larry | last = Printz | date = 2018-05-22 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190624003640/https://www.hagerty.com/articles-videos/articles/2018/05/22/when-fiat-built-cars-in-america | archive-date = 2019-06-24 | publisher = The Hagerty Group }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:1912 Fiat Type 55 Fleetwood Roadster.jpg|thumb|American-made Fiat Type 55 Fleetwood Roadster]]
The '''American F.I.A.T. Automobile Company''' was founded by American licensees in 1909 as a response to 45 percent tariffs on imported automobiles.&lt;ref name=HAG1/&gt; The plant was finished in the spring of 1910 and the first car rolled off the production line in September 1910; all Poughkeepsie Fiats were built with parts shipped from Italy although they usually received locally made bodywork by companies like Holbrook, Quinby, or [[Fleetwood Metal Body|Fleetwood]].&lt;ref name=Dragone&gt;{{cite web | url = https://dragoneclassic.com/the-9-liter-fiat-type-55-fleetwood-roadster/ | title = The 9 Liter 1912 FIAT Type 55 Fleetwood Roadster | publisher = Dragone Classic Motorcars | first = Alex | last = Dragone | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190624015418/https://dragoneclassic.com/the-9-liter-fiat-type-55-fleetwood-roadster/ | archive-date = 2019-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; American F.I.A.T. focused on the larger and more luxurious end of the range, with the smaller Types 51 and 52 (''Tipo'' 1 and 2) only available to order as fully built-up imports.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | ref = IFBB | title = Isotta-Fraschini: the noble pride of Italy | last = Nicholson | first = Tim | isbn = 0-345-02289-0 | publisher = Ballantine Books Inc. | page = 14 | date = May 1971 | location = New York, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first model offered was the '''Type 54''', corresponding to the European ''Tipo 4.'' This has a {{convert|5699|cc|cuin|0|abbr=on}} four-cylinder engine (itself called &quot;Tipo 54A&quot;&lt;ref name=pl05&gt;{{citation | title = Modèles Fiat: Planche 05 | url = http://fiat.modeles.free.fr/modeles/gammes_annees/planches_1899-1973/pl05 | work = fiat.modeles.free.fr | language = fr }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and rode on a {{convert|124|in|m|2|abbr=on}} wheelbase; it was manufactured until 1914 or 1915. This was joined by the large and expensive '''Type 56''' in 1912, a seven-passenger touring car reserved for the American market.&lt;ref&gt;[[#IFBB|Nicholson]], p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; This model has a six-cylinder version of the Type 54 engine, displacing {{convert|8549|cc|cuin|0|abbr=on}} and mounted in a chassis with a {{convert|135|in|m|2|abbr=on}} wheelbase. In 1913 the '''Type 55''' arrived (although some Type 55s appear to have been sold in 1912), slightly shorter than the Type 56 with a {{convert|128|in|m|2|abbr=on}} wheelbase but with a massive {{convert|9017|cc|cuin|0|abbr=on}} four-cylinder engine. This car was largely identical to the European ''Tipo 5'' and was also manufactured for export. In 1914 the fourth and final American Fiat was introduced, the smaller '''Type 53''' - the equivalent of the Italian ''Tipo 3 Ter.'' This has a {{convert|4396|cc|cuin|0|abbr=on}} four-cylinder engine and a {{convert|116|in|m|2|abbr=on}} wheelbase. The Tipo 53 was built until 1916, while the 55 and 56 were manufactured until 1917, although late 55s seem to have been sold as &quot;1918s&quot; and they did appear in new-car catalogues that year. Fiat Italy took over the American operation in 1917 and reduced the lineup to the Type 55, now sitting on a {{convert|140|in|m|2|abbr=on}} wheelbase.&lt;ref name=HAG1/&gt;&lt;ref name=CCZ&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.conceptcarz.com/z29592/fiat-type-55.aspx | title = 1912 Fiat Type 55 News and Information | last = Vaughan | first = Daniel | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190410191419/https://www.conceptcarz.com/z29592/fiat-type-55.aspx | archive-date = 2019-04-10 | work = Conceptcarz.com | date = April 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tax horsepower#United States|NACC tax horsepower]] figures were 30 hp for the Type 54, 45 for the Type 56, 42 for the Type 55, and 25 hp for the Type 53.

Output was never very large, Fiats being very expensive cars at the time, with annual production averaging around 350 cars.&lt;ref name=HAG1/&gt; Once the United States entered the war, no more car parts were arriving from Italy and production was halted. There were plans for restarting production after the war but they came to naught and the plant was sold to [[Duesenberg]] in February 1918.&lt;ref name=CCZ/&gt; Duesenberg proceeded to transfer the machinery to their plant in Elizabeth, NJ, to build aircraft engines. At the beginning of 1928 the facilities changed hands again, now belonging to truck manufacturers Larrabee Motor Truck Co. who transferred their activities there from [[Binghamton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ObM3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA16 | journal = Power Wagon | volume = XL | number = 277 | date = January 1928 | page = 16 | editor-first = Austin W. | editor-last = Stromberg | title = Larrabee Co.

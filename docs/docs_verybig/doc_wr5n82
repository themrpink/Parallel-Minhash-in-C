'''Mercedes Ritchie Lackey''' (born June 24, 1950) is an American writer of [[Fantasy literature|fantasy novels]]. Many of her novels and trilogies are interlinked and set in the world of [[Velgarth]], mostly in and around the country of [[Valdemar (fictional country)|Valdemar]].  Her Valdemar novels include interaction between human and non-human protagonists with many different cultures and social [[mores]].

Her other main world is one much like our own, but it includes clandestine populations of elves, mages, vampires, and other mythical beings. The ''Bedlam's Bard'' books describe a young man with the power to work magic through music; the ''SERRAted Edge'' books are about racecar driving elves; and the ''Diana Tregarde'' thrillers center on a [[Wiccan]] who combats evil.

She has also published several novels re-working well-known fairy tales set in a mid-19th to early 20th century setting in which magic is real, although hidden from the mundane world.  These novels explore issues of ecology, social class, and gender roles.

Lackey has published over 140 books and writes novels at a rate of 5.5 per year on average. She has been called one of the &quot;most prolific science fiction and fantasy writers of all time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://io9.com/11-most-prolific-science-fiction-and-fantasy-authors-of-1443957263 iO9]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Lackey was born in [[Chicago]].  Her birth prevented her father from being called to serve in the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercedeslackey.com/biography.html |title=Biography |publisher=Mercedes Lackey |date=1950-06-24 |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She places her meeting with [[science fiction]] at age 10 or 11, when she picked up her father's copy of [[James H. Schmitz]]'s ''[[Agent of Vega]]''. She then read [[Andre Norton]]'s ''Beast Master'' and ''Lord of Thunder'' and continued to read all of Norton's works. Lackey had difficulties obtaining enough interesting books from the public library to sate her passion for reading.  She wrote for herself but without real direction or purpose until she attended [[Purdue University]].  Lackey graduated from Purdue in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fictiondb.com/author/mercedes-lackey~21146.htm Fictiondb.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Purdue, she took a one-on-one class of English Literature Independent Studies with a professor who was a fellow [[science fiction fandom|science fiction fan]]. He helped her analyze books she enjoyed and then use that knowledge. Lackey then encountered [[fan fiction]], which further encouraged her writing. She began publishing work in [[science fiction fanzines]] and then discovered [[filk]] and had some filk lyrics published by Off Centaur Publications.

==Professional sales==
[[File:Mercedes Lackey 1a.jpg|right|thumb|Lackey signing autographs at [[CONvergence]]]]
Lackey submitted a story to ''[[Sword and Sorceress series|Sword and Sorceress]]'', then sold the rewritten story to ''Fantasy Book Magazine''. Her first sale was to ''Friends of Darkover''.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

She met [[C. J. Cherryh]] through filk, and she mentored her during the writing of her 'Arrows' series. During this time, [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]] included her short stories in an anthology; and Cherryh helped Lackey through 17 rewrites of 'Arrows'. During this time, she claims to have been writing so much that she had no social life at all. She divorced Tony Lackey, and eventually married Larry Dixon.&lt;ref name=FantasticFiction&gt;[http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/l/mercedes-r-lackey &quot;Mercedes Lackey&quot;] Retrieved 11 Dec. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stance on fanfiction===
Despite getting her own start as a fan fiction author, she and her agent forbade fanfiction based on her own books for many years, whether distributed offline or online. Lackey stated on her website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercedeslackey.com/am_conventions.html |title=Mercedes Lackey Official Website, Ask Misty |publisher=Mercedeslackey.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; that this was due to the 1992 Marion Zimmer Bradley fan fiction affair, when a fan accused Bradley of copying the fan's work, and demanded writing credit and remuneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joseph C. McKenzie |url=http://www.fanworks.org/writersresource/?tool=fanpolicy&amp;action=define&amp;authorid=53 |title=Fanworks, Marion Zimmer Bradley |publisher=Fanworks.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several years, Lackey's policy permitted offline fanfic, but only if the author got a release form from Mercedes Lackey that said the author acknowledged that they were using characters that belong to Mercedes Lackey and that the author's work essentially became Mercedes Lackey's property to prevent &quot;infringing on my right to make a living from my own imagination&quot;. As of 2009 this policy changed, permitting fanfiction to be licensed as derivative fiction under the [[Creative Commons]] umbrella.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercedeslackey.com/news.html |title=&quot;News&quot; at author's website |publisher=Mercedeslackey.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Lackey lives with her husband [[Larry Dixon (fantasy artist)|Larry Dixon]] outside of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. She describes it as a &quot;2½-story concrete dome with an octagonal wooden shell over it to make it look more like a normal house ... it's round with curved outer walls, which makes placement of furniture kind of awkward.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Valdemar Companion'', 68&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other interests===
Lackey and Dixon have in the past worked in [[raptor rehabilitation]]. She refers to her various [[parrot]]s as her &quot;feathered children&quot;.  The afterwords to some of her books refer to rehabilitation and [[falconry]], and this interest has influenced and informed her writing. She also enjoys beadwork, costuming, and needlework. She claims, however, to be a &quot;wretched housekeeper, and by and large an indifferent cook&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Valdemar Companion'', 64&lt;/ref&gt; Besides this, she does radar-reading during tornado season. She helps support the [[Alex Foundation]].

Lackey is active in the [[ball-jointed doll]] community.  She owns several dolls, many of which she has customized in the likenesses of her characters.

Historically, Lackey was active in the [[filk]]ing community.  She was a major contributor to an early album of space filk, ''[[Minus Ten and Counting]]''.  She has won five [[Pegasus Award]]s, mostly for her songwriting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ovff.org/pegasus/people/mercedes-lackey.html Ovff.org]&lt;/ref&gt; She was also active in the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]], and belongs to the [[Great Dark Horde]].

She participates in [[The Stellar Guild]] series published by [[Phoenix Pick]]. The series pairs bestselling authors like Lackey with lesser known authors in science fiction and fantasy to help provide additional visibility to them.

Lackey revealed herself to be a player of the [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] ''[[City of Heroes]]'' along with her husband and father-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/MercedesLackey/posts/10151140370339802 |title=Mercedes Lackey facebook post |publisher=[[Facebook.com]] |date= |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; She revealed her identity on a player-owned forum to join the efforts to save the servers from closing down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cohtitan.com/forum/index.php/topic,4886.msg46374.html#msg46374 Titan Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lackey is active in the online question and answer forum of [[Quora]], answering questions about writing, birds, pets, current events, and politics and has her own [https://www.quora.com/profile/Mercedes-R-Lackey profile page].

==Related writers==
Mercedes Lackey was a protegée of [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]], and got her start writing short stories in Bradley's story collections. Other mentors include writers C. J. Cherryh and Andre Norton, along with her editor, Elizabeth (Betsy) Wollheim of [[DAW Books]].

Her earlier Velgarth novels are all solo projects, but later volumes in the Valdemar saga are illustrated by her husband Larry Dixon, and in many of her latest works he is also credited as co-author. Many of her other novels are collaborations. She has worked with fantasy authors Andre Norton (such as the Halfblood Chronicles), Marion Zimmer Bradley (such as ''Rediscovery'' and ''Tigers Burning Bright''), [[Anne McCaffrey]] (such as ''[[The Ship Who Searched]]''), and [[Piers Anthony]] (''If I Pay Thee Not in Gold''). She has most recently written ''The Obsidian Trilogy'' with historian [[James Mallory (author)|James Mallory]]; a [[historical fantasy]] series about an &quot;alternative&quot; [[Elizabeth I]] with romance writer [[Roberta Gellis]]; and the ''[[Heirs of Alexandria series]]'' with [[Dave Freer]] and [[Eric Flint]].&lt;ref name=FantasticFiction /&gt;

It debuted on April 16, 2002, adopting the name, motto, and [[Nameplate (publishing)|masthead]] of the earlier New York paper, ''[[The Sun (New York City)|The Sun]]'' (1833–1950). It became the first general-interest [[broadsheet]] newspaper to be started in New York City in several decades. Its [[op-ed]] page became a prominent platform in the country for [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] viewpoints. Since 2009 ''The Sun'' has operated as an (occasional and erratic) online-only publisher of political and economic opinion pieces, as well as occasional arts content.

==History==
''The Sun'' was founded by a group of investors including publishing magnate [[Conrad Black]]. The goal was to provide an alternative to ''[[The New York Times]]'', featuring front page news about local and state events, in contrast to the emphasis on national and international news by the ''Times''. The Sun began business operations, prior to first publication, in October 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;ap-end&quot;/&gt;

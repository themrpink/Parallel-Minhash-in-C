'''Gnathostomulids''', or '''jaw worms''', are a small [[phylum]] of nearly microscopic marine [[animal]]s. They inhabit sand and mud beneath shallow coastal waters and can survive in relatively [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] environments. They were first recognised and described in 1956.&lt;ref name=Ax&gt;{{Cite journal|last1= Ax |first1=P.  |year= 1956 |title=Die Gnathostomulida, eine rätselhafte Wurmgruppe aus dem Meeressand |journal=Abhandl. Akad. Wiss. U. Lit. Mainz, Math. - Naturwiss. |volume=8 |pages=1–32 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anatomy==
Most gnathostomulids measure {{convert|0.5|to|1|mm|2}} in length. They are often slender to thread-like worms, with a generally transparent body. In many [[Bursovaginoidea]], one of the major group of gnathostomulids, the neck region is slightly narrower than the rest of the body, giving them a distinct head.&lt;ref name=IZ&gt;{{Cite book|author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 311–312|isbn= 0-03-056747-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like flatworms they have a [[cilia]]ted [[Epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]], but in contrast to flatworms, they have one cilium per cell.&lt;ref&gt;Ruppert, Edward E., Fox, Richard S., Barnes, Robert D.  (2004) ''Invertebrate Zoology'' (7th edition). Brooks/Cole-Thomson Learning, Belmont, US&lt;/ref&gt; The cilia allow the worms to glide along in the water between sand grains, although they also use muscles, allowing the body to twist or contract, for movement.

They have no [[coelom|body cavity]], and no circulatory or respiratory system. The nervous system is simple, and restricted to the outer layers of the body wall. The only sense organs are modified cilia, which are especially common in the head region.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

The mouth is located just behind the head, after a rostrum, on the underside of the body. It has a pair of cuticular jaws, supplied by strong muscles, and often bearing minute teeth. A &quot;basal plate&quot; on the lower surface that bears a comb-like structure is also present. The basal plate is used to scrape smaller organisms off of the grains of sand that make up their anoxic seabed mud habitat.&lt;ref name= Barnes&gt;Barnes, R.F.K. et al. (2001). ''The Invertebrates: A Synthesis''. Oxford: Blackwell Science.&lt;/ref&gt; This bilaterally symmetrical [[pharynx]] with its complex cuticular mouth parts make them appear closely related to [[rotifer]]s and their allies, together making up the [[Gnathifera (phylum)|Gnathifera]]. The ultrastructure of the jaws made of rods with electron dense core in [[transmission electron microscopy]] sections also support their close relation with [[Rotifera]] and [[Micrognathozoa]]. The mouth opens into a blind-ending tube in which digestion takes place; there is no true [[anus]].&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt; However, there is tissue connecting the intestine to the epidermis which may serve as an anal pore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knauss|first=Elizabeth|date=December 1979|title=Indication of an Anal Pore in Gnathostomulida|url=|journal=Zoologica Scripta|volume=8|issue=1–4|pages=181–6|doi=10.1111/j.1463-6409.1979.tb00630.x}}&lt;!--|access-date=15 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproduction==
Gnathostomulids are [[Hermaphrodite#Simultaneous hermaphrodites|simultaneous hermaphrodites]]. Each individual possesses a single [[ovary]] and one or two [[testis|testes]]. After fertilization, the single egg ruptures through the body wall and adheres to nearby sand particles; the parent is able to rapidly heal the resulting wound. The egg hatches into a miniature version of the adult, without a larval stage.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

==Taxonomy==
{{See also|List of bilaterial animal orders}}
There are approximately 100 described species&lt;ref name=Zhang2011&gt;{{cite journal| author=Zhang, Z.-Q.| title=Animal biodiversity: An introduction to higher-level classification and taxonomic richness | journal=Zootaxa| volume=3148| year=2011| pages=7–12| url=http://mapress.com/zootaxa/2011/f/zt03148p012.pdf| doi=10.11646/zootaxa.3148.1.3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and certainly many more as yet undescribed. The known species are grouped in two orders. The [[Filospermoidea|filospermoids]] are very long and are characterized by an elongate rostrum. The [[Bursovaginoidea|bursovaginoids]] have paired sensory organs and are characterized by the presence of a penis and a sperm-storage organ called a bursa.&lt;ref name= Barnes/&gt;

Gnathostomulids have no known fossil record, though there are (debatable) similarities between the jaws of modern gnathostomulids and certain conodont elements.

They appear to be a sister clade to the [[Syndermata]].&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Tobergte|first2=S.|last3=Struck|first3=T.H.|date=May 2015|title=Elucidating the phylogenetic position of Gnathostomulida and first mitochondrial genomes of Gnathostomulida, Gastrotricha and Polycladida (Platyhelminthes)|journal=Mol Phylogenet Evol|volume=86|issue=|pages=49–63|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2015.02.013|pmid=25796325|last1=Golombek|first1=A.}}&lt;!--|access-date=30 May 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stanley Jordan''' (born July 31, 1959) is an American jazz guitarist whose technique involves tapping his fingers on the fretboard of the guitar with both hands.

== Music career ==
Jordan was born in Chicago, Illinois. When he was six, he started on piano, then at eleven switched to guitar.&lt;ref name=&quot;am&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title =Stanley Jordan: Biography |first=Scott|last=Yanow |website=Allmusic| url ={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=stanley-jordan-p6862/biography|pure_url=yes}} |accessdate =November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later began playing in rock and soul bands. In 1976, he won an award at the Reno Jazz Festival. At [[Princeton University]], he studied [[music theory]] and composition with [[Milton Babbitt]] and [[computer music]] with [[Paul Lansky]].&lt;ref name=&quot;W. Craig 1983&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;C. Deffaa 1986&quot; /&gt; While at Princeton he played with [[Benny Carter]] and [[Dizzy Gillespie]].&lt;ref name=&quot;am&quot; /&gt;

In 1985, Bruce Lundvall became president of [[Blue Note Records]] and Stanley Jordan was the first person he signed. Blue Note released his album ''Magic Touch'', which sat at No.1 on ''Billboard'' 's jazz chart for 51 weeks, setting a record.

=== The touch technique ===
Normally, a guitarist uses two hands to play each note. One hand presses down a guitar string behind a chosen [[fret]] to prepare the note, and the other hand either plucks or strums the string to play that note. Jordan's touch technique is an advanced form of two-handed [[tapping]]. The guitarist produces a note using only one finger by quickly tapping (or [[Hammer-on|hammering]]) his finger down behind the appropriate fret. The impact causes the string to vibrate enough to sound the note, and the volume can be controlled by varying the force of impact. Jordan taps with both hands, and more [[legato]] than is normally associated with guitar tapping. His technique allows the guitarist to play [[melody]] and [[Chord (music)|chords]] simultaneously. It is also possible, as he has demonstrated, to play simultaneously on two different guitars, as well as guitar and piano.

He plays guitar in [[all-fourths tuning]], from bass to treble EADGCF (all in [[perfect fourth]]s as on the bass guitar) rather than the standard EADGBE. He has stated that all-fourths tuning &quot;simplifies the fingerboard, making it logical&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ferguson|1986|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3idLAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Stanley+Jordan%22,+%22all+fourth%22+OR+%22perfect+fourth%22,+guitar+tuning&amp;dq=%22Stanley+Jordan%22,+%22all+fourth%22+OR+%22perfect+fourth%22,+guitar+tuning&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BfzgT_XgKILetAaampnyDg&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA 76]}}: {{cite book|chapter=Stanley Jordan|first=Jim|last=Ferguson|pages=68–76?|title=New directions in modern guitar|series=''[[Guitar&amp;nbsp;Player]]'' basic library|editor1-first=Helen|editor1-last=Casabona|editor2-first=Adrian|editor2-last=Belew|editor-link2=Adrian Belew|publisher=Hal&amp;nbsp;Leonard Publishing Corporation|year=1986|isbn=978-0-88188-423-4|ref=harv|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3idLAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Stanley+Jordan%22,+%22all+fourth%22+OR+%22perfect+fourth%22,+guitar+tuning&amp;dq=%22Stanley+Jordan%22,+%22all+fourth%22+OR+%22perfect+fourth%22,+guitar+tuning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan's main guitar was built by [[Vigier Guitars]] in 1984: it is an Arpege model on which Vigier made a flat fingerboard, allowing it to have a very low action (0.5/0.7mm). The low action facilitates the tapping technique.

=== Recording ===
[[File:19890600-33-StanleyJordan.jpg|thumb|Stanley Jordan, 1989.|alt=]]Among the artists Jordan has worked with are [[Quincy Jones]], [[Onaje Allan Gumbs]], [[Michal Urbaniak]], [[Richie Cole (musician)|Richie Cole]], [[The Dave Matthews Band]], [[The String Cheese Incident]], [[Phil Lesh]], [[Moe (band)|Moe]], and [[Umphrey's McGee]].

He has performed at many jazz festivals, including [[Kool Jazz Festival]] (1984), [[Concord Jazz Festival]] (1985), and the [[Montreux International Jazz Festival]] (1985).

In 2004, he released the album ''Dreams of Peace''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/dreams-of-peace-mw0000709372 |title=Dreams of Peace – Stanley Jordan &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |website=[[AllMusic]] | date=2003-06-24 |accessdate=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Italian band [[Novecento (group)|Novecento]]. The album was produced by Lino Nicolosi and Pino Nicolosi at [[Nicolosi Productions]] and was released in the U.S. on [[Favored Nations]]. He signed with [[Mack Avenue Records]] and released ''State of Nature'' in 2008 and ''Friends'' in 2011. The latter was nominated for an [[NAACP Image Award]]. He has four Grammy nominations.
Jordan made the startup sound for the [[Macintosh]] computer models the [[Power Macintosh 6100]], [[Power Macintosh 7100]], and [[Power Macintosh 8100]].

=== Film and television ===
Jordan made a cameo appearance in the movie ''[[Blind Date (1987 film)|Blind Date]]'' (1987). In 1995 he wrote the score for the short film ''One Red Rose''. In 1996 he wrote the score for the ABC TV afternoon special, ''Daddy's Girl''.

Since the mid 1980s he has performed on numerous television shows, including ''The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson'', ''The David Letterman Show'' and ''the Grammy Awards''.

== Personal life ==
Stanley Jordan was briefly married and has one daughter, Julia Jordan, who is a singer and songwriter.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.stanleyjordan.com/en-us/biography|website=The Official Stanley Jordan Site|accessdate=November 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hyoliths''' are [[animal]]s with small [[conical surface|conical]] [[animal shell|shell]]s, known as fossils from the [[Palaeozoic]] Era. They are [[lophophorate]]s, a group which includes the [[brachiopod]]s.

==Morphology==
The shell is typically one to four centimeters in length, triangular or elliptical in cross section. Some species have rings or stripes. It comprises two parts: the main conical shell (previously referred to as a ‘conch’) and a cap-like [[Operculum (animal)|operculum]]. Some also had two curved supports known as ''helens''&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; They are [[calcium carbonate|calcareous]] &amp;ndash; probably aragonitic&lt;ref name=&quot;Mus2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|pages= 1231–1243|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4983.2007.00700.x|title=Skeletal Microstructure of Helens, Lateral Spines of Hyolithids|journal=Palaeontology|volume=50|issue=5|date=September 2007|last1=Mus|first1=M. Martí|last2=Bergström|first2=J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these structures grew by marginal accretion.

=== Shell microstructure===
The orthothecid shell has an internal layer with a microstructure of transverse bundles, and an external layer comprising longitudinal bundles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mus2007&quot; /&gt;

=== Helens ===
Some hyoliths had helens, long structures that taper as they coil gently in a [[logarithmic spiral]] in a ventral direction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mus2007&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; The helens had an organic-rich central core surrounded by concentric laminae of calcite.  They grew by the addition of new material at their base, on the cavity side, leaving growth lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mus2007&quot; /&gt;

They were originally described by Walcott as separate fossils under the genus name ''Helenia'', (Walcott's wife was named Helena and his daughter Helen); [[Bruce Runnegar]] adopted the name helen when they were recognized as part of the hyolith organism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mus2007&quot; /&gt; Encrusting organisms have been found on helens, and also on both sides of the main shell, all of which are therefore supposed to have been raised above the sea bed. The helens have been interpreted as props that supported the feeding organ, the [[lophophore]], above the sea bed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moysiuk|first1=Joseph|last2=Smith|first2=Martin R.|last3=Caron|first3=Jean-Bernard|title=Hyoliths are Palaeozoic lophophorates|journal=Nature|date=11 January 2017|volume=541|issue=7637|pages=394–397|doi=10.1038/nature20804|pmid=28077871|url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/20195/1/20195.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operculum ===
The operculum closes over the aperture of the shell, leaving (in hyolithids) two gaps through which the helens can protrude.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mus2007&quot; /&gt;  It comprises two parts: the cardinal shield, a flat region at the top of the shell; and the conical shield, the bottom part, which is more conical.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mus2007&quot; /&gt;  The inside of the shell bears a number of protrusions, notably the dorsal cardinal processes and the radially-arranged clavicles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mus2007&quot; /&gt;

===Soft tissues===
The soft tissues of the mid-Cambrian hyolith ''Haplophrentis'', from the [[Burgess Shale]] and [[Spence Shale]] [[Lagerstätten]] include a gullwing-shaped band below the operculum. This band is interpreted as a lophophore, a feeding organ with a central mouth; it bears 12 to 16 tentacles. From the mouth a muscular pharynx leads to a gut, which loops back and exits beyond the crown of tentacles. Next to the gut are a pair of large kidney-shaped organs of uncertain nature. Under the operculum are muscles. The thin body wall circumscribes the interior of the shell, except the apex.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

== Taxonomy ==
{{See also|List of bilaterial animal orders}}
[[Image:Hyoliths02.JPG|thumb|250px|Hyoliths from the Middle [[Ordovician]] of northern [[Estonia]]; these are internal molds.]]
The hyoliths are divided into two orders, the [[Hyolithida]] and the [[Orthothecida]].

Hyolitha have dorso-ventrally differentiated opercula, with the ventral surface of the shell extending forwards to form a shelf termed the ligula.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mus2007&quot; /&gt;

The Orthothecida are somewhat more problematic, and probably contain a number of non-hyoliths simply because they are so difficult to identify with confidence, especially if their operculum is absent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mus2007&quot; /&gt;  They have a straight (planar) opening, sometimes with a notch on the bottom side, and sealed with an operculum that has no ligula, clavicles, furrow or rooflets.&lt;ref name=Malinky2004/&gt;

''[[Hyptiotheca]]'' is an unusual hyolithid, in that it lacks clavicles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malinky2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | author1=Malinky, J.M. | author2=Skovsted, C.B. | title = Hyoliths and small shelly fossils from the Lower Cambrian of North−East Greenland | journal =  Acta Palaeontologica Polonica |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=551–578 | year=2004|url=http://app.pan.pl/article/item/app49-551.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthothecids fall into two groups: one, the orthothecida ''sensu stricto'',&lt;ref name=&quot;ref_a&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Malinky | first1 = J. M.| title = First Occurrence of ''Orthotheca'' Novák, 1886 (Hyolitha, Early Devonian) in North America| journal = Journal of Paleontology| volume = 83| issue = 4| pages = 588–596| year = 2009| doi = 10.1666/08-164R.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; is kidney or heart shaped in cross-section due to a longitudinal groove on its ventral surface, and its opercula bear cardinal processes; the other has a rounded cross-section and often lacks cardinal processes, making them difficult to distinguish from other cornet-shaped calcareous organisms.&lt;ref name=Malinky2004/&gt;  All were sessile and benthic; some may have been filter feeders.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref_a&quot; /&gt;

Because hyoliths are extinct and do not obviously resemble any [[Extant taxon|extant]] group, it has long been unclear which living group they are most closely related to.  They have been supposed to be molluscs; or to belong to their own phylum in an unspecified part of the tree of life.&lt;ref name=Sumrall2009&gt;{{cite journal |pages=147–152 |doi=10.1666/08-094R.1 |jstor=29739075 |title=Permian Hyolithida from Australia: The Last of the Hyoliths? |journal=Journal of Paleontology |volume=83 |issue=1 |year=2009 |last1=Malinky |first1=John M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their grade of organization was historically considered to be of the 'mollusc-annelid-sipunculid' level,&lt;ref name=&quot;Runnegar1980&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Runnegar |first1=B. |doi=10.1111/j.1502-3931.1980.tb01025.x |title=Hyolitha: Status of the phylum |journal=Lethaia |volume=13 |pages=21–25 |date=January 1980 |pmid= |pmc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; consistent with a Lophotrochozoan affinity, and comparison was primarily drawn with the molluscs or [[sipunculid]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Runnegar1980&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kouchinsky2000&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kouchinsky |first1=A. V. |title=Skeletal microstructures of hyoliths from the Early Cambrian of Siberia |doi=10.1080/03115510008619525 |journal=Alcheringa: An Australasian Journal of Palaeontology |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=65–81 |year=2000 |pmid= |pmc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older studies (predating the Lophotrochozoan concept) consider hyoliths to represent a stem lineage of the clade containing (Mollusca + Annelida + Arthropoda).&lt;ref name=&quot;Runnegar1975&quot; /&gt;

A secure classification at last became possible in 2017, on the basis of [[Burgess Shale]] specimens that preserve lophophores.  This diagnostic characteristic demonstrates an affinity with the [[Lophophorata]], a group that contains [[Brachiopoda]], [[Bryozoa]] (perhaps), and [[Phoronida]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

== Ecology ==
Hyolithids were benthic (bottom-dwellers), using their helens as stilts to hold the opening of their shells above the sea floor.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Orthothecids did not have helens, but are presumed to have been sessile and benthic.

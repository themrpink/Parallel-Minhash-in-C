'''Wilhelm II''' (Friedrich Wilhelm Viktor Albert; 27 January 1859{{spaced ndash}}4 June 1941), anglicised as '''William II''', was the last [[German Emperor]] (''Kaiser'') and [[King of Prussia]]. His reign lasted from 15 June 1888 to 9 November 1918. Despite strengthening Germany’s position as a [[great power]] by building a [[blue-water navy]] and promoting scientific innovation, his tactless public statements and reckless foreign policy greatly antagonized the international community and ultimately plunged his country into [[World War I]]. When the German war effort collapsed after a series of crushing defeats on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in 1918, he was [[Abdication of Wilhelm II|forced to abdicate]], thereby bringing an end to the [[Hohenzollern]] dynasty’s three hundred year rule.

As the eldest grandchild of [[Queen Victoria]], Wilhelm's [[Grandchildren of Victoria and Albert|first cousins]] included [[King George V of the United Kingdom|George V of the United Kingdom]] and many princesses who, along with Wilhelm's sister [[Sophia of Prussia|Sophia]], became European [[Queen consort|consorts]]. For most of his life before becoming emperor, he was second in line to succeed his grandfather [[Wilhelm I]] on the German and Prussian thrones after his father, [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick]]. His grandfather and father both died in 1888, the [[Year of Three Emperors]], making Wilhelm emperor and king. On 20 March 1890, he dismissed the [[German Empire|German Empire’s]] powerful longtime [[Chancellor of Germany|chancellor]], [[Otto von Bismarck]].

After Bismarck's departure, Wilhelm II assumed direct control over his nation’s policies and embarked on a bellicose &quot;New Course&quot; to cement its status as a respected world power. Subsequently, over the course of his reign, Germany acquired territories in the [[Far East]] and became Europe’s largest manufacturer. However, he frequently undermined such progress by making threatening statements towards other countries and voicing [[xenophobic]] views without consulting his ministers. Likewise, his regime did much to alienate itself from the world's other [[Great Powers]] by initiating a [[Imperial German Navy#1888 to 1897, Kaiser Wilhelm II|massive naval build-up]], [[Agadir Crisis|challenging French control of Morocco]], and [[Berlin–Baghdad railway|building a railway through Baghdad]] that threatened Britain's dominion in the [[Persian Gulf]].{{sfn|Jastrow|1917|page=97}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Mustafa Sıtkı Bi̇lgi̇n |title= The Construction of the Baghdad Railway and its Impact on Anglo-Turkish Relations, 1902–1913 |url= http://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/19/1273/14662.pdf |access-date=6 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://oilpro.com/post/4759/following-the-tracks-to-war-britain-germany--the-berlin-baghdad-railway |title= Following The Tracks To War – Britain, Germany &amp; The Berlin–Baghdad Railway |author= Jeff Reed |work= Oilpro |access-date=6 December 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170318135451/http://oilpro.com/post/4759/following-the-tracks-to-war-britain-germany--the-berlin-baghdad-railway |archive-date= 18 March 2017 |url-status= dead |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, by the second decade of the [[20th century]], Germany could rely only on significantly weaker nations such as [[Austria-Hungary]] and the declining [[Ottoman Empire]] as its allies.

Wilhelm II’s turbulent reign ultimately culminated in Germany's guarantee of military support to Austria-Hungary during the [[July Crisis|crisis of July 1914]], one of the direct underlying causes for the [[World War I|First World War]]. A lax wartime leader, he left virtually all decision-making regarding strategy and organisation of the war effort to the [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial German Army's]] [[German General Staff|Great General Staff]]. By 29 August 1916, this broad delegation of power resulted in a ''de facto'' [[military dictatorship]] that dominated national policy for the rest of the conflict. Despite emerging victorious over Russia and achieving significant gains in [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Europe]], Germany was forced to relinquish all its conquests after its forces' decisive defeat in November 1918. Upon losing the support of the military and his subjects, Wilhelm abdicated his throne and fled to exile in the [[Netherlands]]. He remained there during [[Reichskommissariat Niederlande|the German occupation]] in [[World War II]], and died in 1941.

==Biography==
Wilhelm was born on 27 January 1859 at the [[Kronprinzenpalais|Crown Prince's Palace]], [[Berlin]], to [[Victoria, Princess Royal]], the wife of [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Prince Frederick William of Prussia]] (the future Frederick III). His mother was the eldest daughter of Britain's [[Queen Victoria]]. At the time of his birth, his great-uncle [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]] was king of Prussia, and his grandfather and namesake [[William I, German Emperor|Wilhelm]] was acting as regent. He was the first grandchild of Queen Victoria and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] and one of the two grandchildren born in Albert's lifetime, but more importantly, the first son of the crown prince of Prussia. From 1861, Wilhelm was second in the line of [[Order of succession|succession]] to [[Prussia]], and also, after 1871, to the newly created [[German Empire]], which, according to the [[constitution of the German Empire]], was ruled by the Prussian king. At the time of his birth, he was also sixth in the [[line of succession to the British throne]], after his maternal uncles and his mother.

[[File:The Crown Prince of Prussia and Prince Wilhelm II. at Balmoral Castle. - Oct. 1863.jpg|thumb|Wilhelm with his father, in Highland dress, in 1862]]

A traumatic [[breech birth]] resulted in [[Erb's palsy]], which left him with a withered left arm about six inches (15 centimetres) shorter than his right. He tried with some success to conceal this; many photographs show him holding a pair of white gloves in his left hand to make the arm seem longer. In others, he holds his left hand with his right, has his crippled arm on the hilt of a sword, or holds a cane to give the illusion of a useful limb posed at a dignified angle. Historians have suggested that this disability affected his emotional development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William L.|last=Putnam|title=The Kaiser's Merchant Ships in World War I|publisher=Light Technology Publishing|location=Flagstaff, Arizona|date=2001|isbn=978-1622336999|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHNorbVvyLg|title=Queen Victoria and the Crippled Kaiser - Ντοκιμαντερ|last=Cosmos Greek Documentaries|date=9 October 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early years===
In 1863, Wilhelm was taken to England to be present at the wedding of his Uncle Bertie (later King [[Edward VII]]), and Princess [[Alexandra of Denmark]]. Wilhelm attended the ceremony in a [[Highland dress|Highland costume]], complete with a small toy [[dirk]]. During the ceremony, the four-year-old became restless. His eighteen-year-old uncle [[Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Alfred]], charged with keeping an eye on him, told him to be quiet, but Wilhelm drew his dirk and threatened Alfred. When Alfred attempted to subdue him by force, Wilhelm bit him on the leg. His grandmother, Queen Victoria, missed seeing the fracas; to her Wilhelm remained &quot;a clever, dear, good little child, the great favourite of my beloved Vicky&quot;.{{Sfn | Massie | 1991 | p = 27}}

His mother, Vicky, was obsessed with his damaged arm, blaming herself for the child's handicap and insisted that he become a good rider. The thought that he, as heir to the throne, should not be able to ride was intolerable to her. Riding lessons began when Wilhelm was eight and were a matter of endurance for Wilhelm. Over and over, the weeping prince was set on his horse and compelled to go through the paces. He fell off time after time but despite his tears, was set on its back again. After weeks of this he finally got it right and was able to maintain his balance.{{Sfn | Massie | 1991 | p = 28}}

Wilhelm, from six years of age, was tutored and heavily influenced by the 39-year-old teacher [[Georg Ernst Hinzpeter]].{{Sfn | Clay | 2006 | p = 14}} &quot;Hinzpeter&quot;, he later wrote, &quot;was really a good fellow. Whether he was the right tutor for me, I dare not decide. The torments inflicted on me, in this pony riding, must be attributed to my mother.&quot;{{Sfn | Massie | 1991 | p = 28}}

[[File:Kaiser Wilhelm II Gymnasiast.png|thumb|left|[[Crown Prince|Prince]] Wilhelm as a student at the age of 18 in Kassel. As usual, he is hiding his damaged left hand behind his back.]]
As a teenager he was educated at [[Kassel]] at the [[Friedrichsgymnasium Kassel|Friedrichsgymnasium]]. In January 1877, Wilhelm finished high school and on his eighteenth birthday received as a present from his grandmother, Queen Victoria, the [[Order of the Garter]]. After Kassel he spent four terms at the [[University of Bonn]], studying law and politics. He became a member of the exclusive ''[[Corps Borussia Bonn]]''.{{Sfn | Massie | 1991 | p = 29}} Wilhelm possessed a quick intelligence, but this was often overshadowed by a cantankerous temper.

{{House of Hohenzollern (Prussia)|william2}}

As a scion of the [[House of Hohenzollern|royal house of Hohenzollern]], Wilhelm was exposed from an early age to the military society of the [[Prussian aristocracy]]. This had a major impact on him and, in maturity, Wilhelm was seldom seen out of uniform. The hyper-masculine [[Prussian virtues|military culture of Prussia]] in this period did much to frame his political ideals and personal relationships.

Crown Prince Frederick was viewed by his son with a deeply felt love and respect. His father's status as a hero of the wars of unification was largely responsible for the young Wilhelm's attitude, as were the circumstances in which he was raised; close emotional contact between father and son was not encouraged. Later, as he came into contact with the Crown Prince's political opponents, Wilhelm came to adopt more ambivalent feelings toward his father, perceiving the influence of Wilhelm's mother over a figure who should have been possessed of masculine independence and strength. Wilhelm also idolised his grandfather, [[Wilhelm I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]], and he was instrumental in later attempts to foster a cult of the first German Emperor as &quot;Wilhelm the Great&quot;.{{Sfn | Hull | 2004 | p = 31}} However, he had a distant relationship with his mother.

[[File:Wilhelm II of Germany.jpg|thumb|left|Prince Wilhelm posing for a photo taken around 1887. His right hand is holding his left hand, which was affected by [[Erb's palsy]].]]

Wilhelm resisted attempts by his parents, especially his mother, to educate him in a spirit of British liberalism. Instead, he agreed with his tutors' support of autocratic rule, and gradually became thoroughly 'Prussianized' under their influence. He thus became alienated from his parents, suspecting them of putting Britain's interests first. The German Emperor, Wilhelm I, watched as his grandson, guided principally by the Crown Princess Victoria, grew to manhood. When Wilhelm was nearing twenty-one the Emperor decided it was time his grandson should begin the military phase of his preparation for the throne. He was assigned as a lieutenant to the [[Guards Corps (German Empire)|First Regiment of Foot Guards]], stationed at [[Potsdam]]. &quot;In the Guards,&quot; Wilhelm said, &quot;I really found my family, my friends, my interests – everything of which I had up to that time had to do without.&quot; As a boy and a student, his manner had been polite and agreeable; as an officer, he began to strut and speak brusquely in the tone he deemed appropriate for a Prussian officer.{{Sfn | Massie | 1991 | p = 33}}

In many ways, Wilhelm was a victim of his inheritance and of Otto von Bismarck's machinations. When Wilhelm was in his early twenties, Bismarck tried to separate him from his parents (who opposed Bismarck and his policies) with some success. Bismarck planned to use the young prince as a weapon against his parents in order to retain his own political dominance. Wilhelm thus developed a dysfunctional relationship with his parents, but especially with his English mother. In an outburst in April 1889, Wilhelm angrily implied that &quot;an [[Morell Mackenzie|English doctor]] killed my father, and an English doctor crippled my arm – which is the fault of my mother&quot;, who allowed no German physicians to attend to herself or her immediate family.{{Sfn | Röhl | 1998 | p = 12}}

As a young man, Wilhelm fell in love with one of his maternal first cousins, [[Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine (1864–1918)|Princess Elisabeth of Hesse-Darmstadt]]. She turned him down, and would, in time, marry into the Russian imperial family. In 1880 Wilhelm became engaged to [[Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein]], known as &quot;Dona&quot;. The couple married on 27 February 1881, and remained married for forty years, until her death in 1921. In a period of ten years, between 1882 and 1892, Augusta Victoria would bear Wilhelm seven children, six sons and a daughter.{{Sfn | Massie | 1991 | p = 34}}
Beginning in 1884, Bismarck began advocating that Kaiser Wilhelm send his grandson on diplomatic missions, a privilege denied to the Crown Prince. That year, Prince Wilhelm was sent to the court of Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia]] in St. Petersburg to attend the coming of age ceremony of the sixteen-year-old [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsarevich Nicholas]]. Wilhelm's behaviour did little to ingratiate himself to the tsar. Two years later, Kaiser Wilhelm I took Prince Wilhelm on a trip to meet with Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] of [[Austria-Hungary]]. In 1886, also, thanks to [[Herbert von Bismarck]], the son of the Chancellor, Prince Wilhelm began to be trained twice a week at the Foreign Ministry. One privilege was denied to Prince Wilhelm: to represent Germany at his maternal grandmother, Queen Victoria's, [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria|Golden Jubilee]] Celebrations in London in 1887.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Accession==

Kaiser [[Wilhelm I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]] died in Berlin on 9 March 1888, and Prince Wilhelm's father ascended the throne as Frederick III. He was already suffering from an incurable [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]] and spent all 99 days of his reign fighting the disease before dying. On 15 June of [[Year of Three Emperors|that same year]], his 29-year-old son succeeded him as German Emperor and King of Prussia.{{sfn|Cecil|1989|pp=110–23}}

[[File:Wilhelm II. 1905.jpeg|thumb|Wilhelm in 1905]]
Although in his youth he had been a great admirer of Otto von Bismarck, Wilhelm's characteristic impatience soon brought him into conflict with the &quot;Iron Chancellor&quot;, the dominant figure in the foundation of his empire. The new Emperor opposed Bismarck's careful foreign policy, preferring vigorous and rapid expansion to protect Germany's &quot;place in the sun&quot;. Furthermore, the young Emperor had come to the throne determined to rule as well as reign, unlike his grandfather.  While the letter of the imperial constitution vested executive power in the emperor, Wilhelm I had been content to leave day-to-day administration to Bismarck. Early conflicts between Wilhelm II and his chancellor soon poisoned the relationship between the two men. Bismarck believed that Wilhelm was a lightweight who could be dominated, and he showed scant respect for Wilhelm's policies in the late 1880s. The final split between monarch and statesman occurred soon after an attempt by Bismarck to implement a far-reaching anti-Socialist law in early 1890.{{sfn|Cecil|1989|pp=124–46}}

==Break with Bismarck==
The impetuous young Kaiser rejected Bismarck's &quot;peaceful foreign policy&quot; and instead plotted with senior generals to work &quot;in favour of a war of aggression&quot;. Bismarck told an aide, &quot;That young man wants war with Russia, and would like to draw his sword straight away if he could. I shall not be a party to it.&quot;{{sfn|Röhl|2014|p=44}}
Bismarck, after gaining an absolute majority in favour of his policies in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]], decided to make the anti-Socialist laws permanent. His ''Kartell'', the majority of the amalgamated Conservative Party and the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberal Party]], favoured making the laws permanent, with one exception: the police power to expel Socialist agitators from their homes. The ''Kartell'' split over this issue and nothing was passed.

As the debate continued, Wilhelm became more and more interested in social problems, especially the treatment of mine workers who went on strike in 1889. He routinely interrupted Bismarck in Council to make clear where he stood on social policy; Bismarck, in turn, sharply disagreed with Wilhelm's policy and worked to circumvent it. Bismarck, feeling pressured and unappreciated by the young Emperor and undermined by his ambitious advisors, refused to sign a proclamation regarding the protection of workers along with Wilhelm, as was required by the [[German Constitution]].

The final break came as Bismarck searched for a new parliamentary majority, with his ''Kartell'' voted from power due to the anti-Socialist bill fiasco. The remaining powers in the Reichstag were the [[Catholic Centre Party]] and the Conservative Party. Bismarck wished to form a new bloc with the Centre Party, and invited [[Ludwig Windthorst]], the party's parliamentary leader, to discuss a coalition; Wilhelm was furious to hear about Windthorst's visit.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, pp. 445–47.&lt;/ref&gt; In a parliamentary state, the head of government depends on the confidence of the parliamentary majority and has the right to form coalitions to ensure his policies a majority, but in Germany, the [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]] had to depend on the confidence of the Emperor, and Wilhelm believed that the Emperor had the right to be informed before his ministers' meeting. After a heated argument at Bismarck's estate over Imperial authority, Wilhelm stormed out. Bismarck, forced for the first time into a situation he could not use to his advantage, wrote a blistering letter of resignation, decrying Wilhelm's interference in foreign and domestic policy, which was published only after Bismarck's death.{{sfn|Cecil|1989|pp=147-70}}

Bismarck had sponsored landmark social security legislation, but by 1889–90, he had become disillusioned with the attitude of workers. In particular, he was opposed to wage increases, improving working conditions, and regulating labour relations. Moreover, the ''Kartell'', the shifting political coalition that Bismarck had been able to forge since 1867, had lost a working majority in the Reichstag. At the opening of the Reichstag on 6 May 1890, the Kaiser stated that the most pressing issue was ''the further enlargement of the bill concerning the protection of the labourer.''{{Sfn | Gauss | 1915 | p = 55}} In 1891, the Reichstag passed the Workers Protection Acts, which improved working conditions, protected women and children and regulated labour relations.

===Dismissal of Bismarck===

[[File:1890 Bismarcks Ruecktritt.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;[[Dropping the Pilot]]&quot;, a cartoon by Sir [[John Tenniel]] (1820–1914), published in the British magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', 29 March 1890, two weeks after Bismarck's dismissal]]

Bismarck resigned at Wilhelm II's insistence in 1890, at the age of 75, to be succeeded as Chancellor of Germany and Minister-President of Prussia by [[Leo von Caprivi]], who in turn was replaced by [[Chlodwig, Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst]], in 1894. Following the dismissal of Hohenlohe in 1900, Wilhelm appointed the man whom he regarded as &quot;his own Bismarck&quot;, [[Bernhard von Bülow]].{{citation needed|date= February 2019}}

In foreign policy Bismarck had achieved a fragile balance of interests between Germany, France and Russia—peace was at hand and Bismarck tried to keep it that way despite growing popular sentiment against Britain (regarding colonies) and especially against Russia. With Bismarck's dismissal the Russians now expected a reversal of policy in Berlin, so they quickly came to terms with France, beginning the process that by 1914 largely isolated Germany.{{Sfn | Taylor | 1967 | pp = 238–39}}

[[File:WilhelmIISilverCoin.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|Silver 5-mark coin of Wilhelm II]]
In appointing Caprivi and then Hohenlohe, Wilhelm was embarking upon what is known to history as &quot;the New Course&quot;, in which he hoped to exert decisive influence in the government of the empire. {{citation needed|date= February 2019}} There is debate amongst historians{{according to whom|date=February 2019}} as to the precise degree to which Wilhelm succeeded in implementing &quot;personal rule&quot; in this era, but what is clear is the very different dynamic which existed between the Crown and its chief political servant (the Chancellor) in the &quot;Wilhelmine Era&quot;. {{Original research inline|date=February 2019}} These chancellors were senior civil servants and not seasoned politician-statesmen like Bismarck.{{POV statement|date=February 2019}} Wilhelm wanted to preclude the emergence of another Iron Chancellor, whom he ultimately detested as being &quot;a boorish old killjoy&quot; who had not permitted any minister to see the Emperor except in his presence, keeping a stranglehold on effective political power. {{citation needed|date=February 2019}} Upon his enforced retirement and until his dying day, Bismarck became a bitter critic of Wilhelm's policies, but without the support of the supreme arbiter of all political appointments (the Emperor) there was little chance of Bismarck exerting a decisive influence on policy.

Bismarck did manage to create the &quot;Bismarck myth&quot;, the view (which some would argue was confirmed by subsequent events) that Wilhelm II's dismissal of the Iron Chancellor effectively destroyed any chance Germany had of stable and effective government. In this view, Wilhelm's &quot;New Course&quot; was characterised far more as the German ship of state going out of control, eventually leading through a series of crises to the carnage of the First and Second World Wars.

[[File:Philip Alexius de Laszlo - Wilhelm II, Deutscher Kaiser, 1908.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait by [[Philip de László]], 1908]]
In the early twentieth century Wilhelm began to concentrate upon his real agenda; the creation of a [[German Imperial Navy|German navy]] that would rival that of Britain and enable Germany to declare itself a world power. He ordered his military leaders to read Admiral [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]]'s book, ''[[The Influence of Sea Power upon History]]'', and spent hours drawing sketches of the ships that he wanted built. Bülow and Bethmann Hollweg, his loyal chancellors, looked after domestic affairs, while Wilhelm began to spread alarm in the chancellories of Europe with his increasingly eccentric views on foreign affairs.

===Promoter of arts and sciences===
Wilhelm enthusiastically promoted the arts and sciences, as well as public education and social welfare.  He sponsored the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society]] for the promotion of scientific research; it was funded by wealthy private donors and by the state and comprised a number of research institutes in both pure and applied sciences.  The [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] was unable to avoid the Kaiser's pressure and lost some of its autonomy when it was forced to incorporate new programs in engineering, and award new fellowships in engineering sciences as a result of a gift from the Kaiser in 1900.{{Sfn | König | 2004 | pp = 359–377}}

Wilhelm supported the modernisers as they tried to reform the Prussian system of secondary education, which was rigidly traditional, elitist, politically authoritarian, and unchanged by the progress in the natural sciences. As hereditary Protector of the [[Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg)|Order of Saint John]], he offered encouragement to the Christian order's attempts to place German medicine at the forefront of modern medical practice through its system of hospitals, nursing sisterhood and nursing schools, and nursing homes throughout the German Empire.  Wilhelm continued as Protector of the Order even after 1918, as the position was in essence attached to the head of the House of Hohenzollern.{{Sfn | Clark | 2003 | pp = 38–40, 44}}{{Sfn | Sainty | 1991 | p = 91}}

==Personality==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R52035, Hamburg, Kaiser Wilhelm II. im Tierpark Hagenbeck.jpg|thumb|Wilhelm talking with [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]] at the [[Tierpark Hagenbeck]] in [[Hamburg]] in 1909]]
Historians have frequently stressed the role of Wilhelm's personality in shaping his reign. Thus, [[Thomas Nipperdey]] concludes he was:
{{quote|gifted, with a quick understanding, sometimes brilliant, with a taste for the modern,—technology, industry, science—but at the same time superficial, hasty, restless, unable to relax, without any deeper level of seriousness, without any desire for hard work or drive to see things through to the end, without any sense of sobriety, for balance and boundaries, or even for reality and real problems, uncontrollable and scarcely capable of learning from experience, desperate for applause and success,—as Bismarck said early on in his life, he wanted every day to be his birthday—romantic, sentimental and theatrical, unsure and arrogant, with an immeasurably exaggerated self-confidence and desire to show off, a juvenile cadet, who never took the tone of the officers' mess out of his voice, and brashly wanted to play the part of the supreme warlord, full of panicky fear of a monotonous life without any diversions, and yet aimless, pathological in his hatred against his English mother.{{Sfn | Nipperdey | 1992 | p = 421}} }}

Historian [[David Fromkin]] states that Wilhelm had a [[love–hate relationship]] with Britain.{{Sfn | Fromkin | 2008 | p = 110}} According to Fromkin
&quot;From the outset, the half-German side of him was at war with the half-English side. He was wildly jealous of the British, wanting to be British, wanting to be better at being British than the British were, while at the same time hating them and resenting them because he never could be fully accepted by them&quot;.{{Sfn | Fromkin | 2008 | p = 87}}

Langer et al. (1968) emphasise the negative international consequences of Wilhelm's erratic personality:
&quot;He believed in force, and the 'survival of the fittest' in domestic as well as foreign politics&amp;nbsp;... William was not lacking in intelligence, but he did lack stability, disguising his deep insecurities by swagger and tough talk. He frequently fell into depressions and hysterics&amp;nbsp;... William's personal instability was reflected in vacillations of policy. His actions, at home as well as abroad, lacked guidance, and therefore often bewildered or infuriated public opinion. He was not so much concerned with gaining specific objectives, as had been the case with Bismarck, as with asserting his will. This trait in the ruler of the leading Continental power was one of the main causes of the uneasiness prevailing in Europe at the turn-of-the-century&quot;.{{Sfn | Langer |MacKendrick|1968 | p = 528}}

===Relationships with foreign relatives===
As a grandchild of Queen Victoria, Wilhelm was a first cousin of the future [[King George V]], as well as of Queens [[Marie of Romania]], [[Maud of Wales|Maud of Norway]], [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg|Victoria Eugenie of Spain]], and the [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Empress Alexandra of Russia]]. In 1889, Wilhelm's younger sister, [[Sophia of Prussia|Sophia]], married the future [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I of Greece]]. Wilhelm was infuriated by his sister's conversion to [[Greek Orthodoxy]]; upon her marriage, he attempted to ban her from entering Germany.

Wilhelm's most contentious relationships were with his British relations. He craved the acceptance of his grandmother, Queen Victoria, and of the rest of her family.&lt;ref&gt;King, Greg, ''Twilight of Splendor: The Court of Queen Victoria During Her Diamond Jubilee Year'' (Wiley &amp; Sons, 2007), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that his grandmother treated him with courtesy and tact, his other relatives found him arrogant and obnoxious, and they largely denied him acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;King (2007), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; He had an especially bad relationship with his [[Edward VII|Uncle Bertie]], the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII). Between 1888 and 1901 Wilhelm resented his uncle, himself a mere heir to the British throne, treating Wilhelm not as Emperor of Germany, but merely as another nephew.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, Philip, ''King Edward the Seventh'' (E. P. Dutton &amp; Co, Inc., 1964), p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, Wilhelm often snubbed his uncle, whom he referred to as &quot;the old peacock&quot; and lorded his position as emperor over him.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1890s, Wilhelm made visits to England for [[Cowes Week]] on the [[Isle of Wight]] and often competed against his uncle in the yacht races. Edward's wife, the Danish-born [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra]], first as Princess of Wales and later as Queen, also disliked Wilhelm, never forgetting the Prussian seizure of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] from Denmark in the 1860s, as well as being annoyed over Wilhelm's treatment of his mother.&lt;ref&gt;Battiscombe, Georgiana, ''Queen Alexandra'' (Constable, 1960), p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his poor relations with his English relatives, when he received news that Queen Victoria was dying at [[Osborne House]] in January 1901, Wilhelm travelled to England and was at her bedside when she died, and he remained for the funeral. He also was present at the funeral of King Edward VII in 1910.

In 1913, Wilhelm hosted a lavish wedding in Berlin for his only daughter, [[Princess Victoria Louise of Prussia|Victoria Louise]]. Among the guests at the wedding were his cousins Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]] and King George V, and George's wife, [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]].

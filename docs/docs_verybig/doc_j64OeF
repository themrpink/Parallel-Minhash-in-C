The [[national park]]s of [[New Zealand]] are protected areas administered by the [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]] (DOC). Although the national parks contain some of New Zealand's most beautiful scenery, the first few established were all focused on mountain scenery. Since the 1980s the focus has been on developing a more diverse representation of New Zealand landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tongariro National Park]] is one of the [[World Heritage Sites]] that are of both cultural and natural significance, while four of the [[South Island]] national parks form [[Te Wahipounamu]], another World Heritage Site. There are currently 13 national parks; a 14th, [[Te Urewera National Park]], was disestablished in 2014.

The national parks are administered by the Department of Conservation &quot;for the benefit, use, and enjoyment of the public&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== National Parks Act ==
The [[National Parks Act 1980 (New Zealand)|National Parks Act of 1980]] was established in order to codify the purpose, governance and selection of national parks. It begins by establishing the definition of a national park:
{{quotation|It is hereby declared that the provisions of this Act shall have effect for the purpose of preserving in perpetuity as national parks, for their intrinsic worth and for the benefit, use, and
enjoyment of the public, areas of New Zealand that contain scenery of such distinctive quality, ecological systems, or natural features so beautiful, unique, or scientifically important that their preservation is in the national interest.|[[National Parks Act 1980 (New Zealand)|National Parks Act 1980]], Part 1, section 4, subsection 1&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved from http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1980/0066/10.0/096be8ed802f3e20.pdf on 21 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The National Parks Act goes on to state that the public will have freedom of entry and access to the parks, though this is subject to restrictions to ensure the preservation of native plants and animals and the welfare of the parks in general. Access to specially protected areas (550&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) constituted under the act is by permit only.
Under the Act, national parks are to be maintained in their natural state as far as possible to retain their value as soil, water and forest conservation areas. Native plants and animals are to be preserved and introduced plants and animals removed if their presence interferes with the natural wildlife. Development in wilderness areas established under the act is restricted to foot tracks and huts used for wild animal control or scientific research.

===Services available for public use===
The Act allows the Department of Conservation to provide hostels, huts, camping grounds, ski tows and similar facilities, parking areas, roading and tracks within the parks. In addition to these, the department also provides some accommodation, transport and other services at entry points to the parks, but these are also offered by other government agencies, voluntary organisations and private firms. More comprehensive services within the parks, such as guided walks and skiing tutorials, are privately provided with concessions from the department.

==Proposed national parks==
The area centred on [[Waipoua Forest]], north of Dargaville, has been proposed as a possible Kauri National Park. The area contains most of New Zealand's remaining [[kauri]], including the largest known kauri, [[Tāne Mahuta]]. These stands of kauri are also valuable as havens for endangered species including the [[North Island brown kiwi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/new+kauri+national+park+northland |title=Beehive&amp;nbsp;— New Kauri National Park for Northland |work=beehive.govt.nz |accessdate=21 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal is currently being investigated by the Department of Conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/minister+welcomes+progress+kauri+national+park|title=Minister welcomes progress on Kauri National Park|date=11 February 2010|publisher=New Zealand Government|accessdate=12 February 2010|location=Wellington, NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to a DoC proposal to upgrade the protection of [[Great Barrier Island]] (Aotea), [[Forest and Bird]] launched a campaign in 2014 to designate it as a National Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forestandbird.org.nz/files/file/Aotea%20National%20Park%20submission%20attachment.pdf Forest &amp; Bird case for Great Barrier Island national park]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2020, the New Zealand National Party announced that they would create two new national parks if elected at the general election, namely Coromandel National Park and Catlins National Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12355547|title=Election 2020: National promises two more National Parks, great walks and to be predator-free by 2050|date=11 August 2020|newspaper=The New Zealand Herald|first=Amelia|last=Wade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mining concerns==
In 2010 the New Zealand Government proposed removing some national park and conservation areas from Schedule 4 protection of the [[Crown Minerals Act]] which prohibits mining in those areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;GREENZONE&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/pollution/news/article.cfm?c_id=281&amp;objectid=10630166&amp;pnum=0|title=Miners press to enter the green zone|date=6 March 2010|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=26 March 2010|first=Geoff|last=Cumming}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July the government abandoned the proposal after receiving a large number of submissions, most of which opposed mining.

'''Lazurite''' is a [[Silicate minerals|tectosilicate]] mineral with [[sulfate]], [[sulfur]] and [[chloride]] with formula (Na,Ca)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;[(S,Cl,SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;,OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;(Al&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;)]. It is a [[feldspathoid]] and a member of the [[sodalite]] group. Lazurite crystallizes in the [[Cubic (crystal system)|isometric]] system although well‐formed crystals are rare. It is usually massive and forms the bulk of the gemstone [[lapis lazuli]].

Lazurite is a deep‐blue to greenish‐blue. The colour is due to the presence of [[Trisulfur#Radical anion|{{chem|S|3|-}}]] anions.&lt;ref name=Sapozhnikov&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Tauson VL, Sapozhnikov AN |year=2003 |title=On the nature of lazurite coloring |journal=Zapiski Vserossijskogo Mineralogicheskogo Obshchestva |volume=132 |issue=5 |pages=102–107 |url=http://rruff.info/rruff_1.0/uploads/ZVMO132N5_102.pdf |language=russian }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a [[Mohs hardness]] of 5.0 to 5.5 and a [[specific gravity]] of 2.4. It is translucent with a [[refractive index]] of 1.50. It is fusible at 3.5 on [[Wolfgang Franz von Kobell]]'s [[fusibility]] scale, and soluble in [[Hydrochloric acid|HCl]]. It commonly contains or is associated with grains of [[pyrite]].

Lazurite is a product of [[contact metamorphism]] of [[limestone]] and is typically associated with [[calcite]], pyrite, [[diopside]], [[humite]], [[forsterite]], [[hauyne]] and [[muscovite]].&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt;

Other blue minerals, such as the [[carbonate]] [[azurite]] and the [[phosphate]] [[lazulite]], may be confused with lazurite, but are easily distinguished with careful examination. At one time, lazurite was a synonym for [[azurite]].&lt;ref name=Klein/&gt;

Lazurite was first described in 1890 for an occurrence in the [[Sar-e-Sang]] District, [[Koksha]] Valley, [[Badakhshan]] Province, [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt; It has been mined for more than 6,000 years in the [[lapis lazuli]] district of Badakhshan. It has been used as a pigment in painting and cloth [[dyeing]] since at least the 6th or 7th century.&lt;ref name=Eastlaugh&gt;&lt;cite id=refEastaugh2004&gt;Eastaugh, Nicholas et al., 2004, ''The Pigment Compendium: Optical Microscopy of Historical Pigments'' Oxford: Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann, p. 219, {{ISBN|0-7506-4553-9}}&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is also mined at [[Lake Baikal]] in Siberia; [[Vesuvius|Mount Vesuvius]]; Burma; Canada; and the United States.&lt;ref name=Eastlaugh/&gt; The name is from the [[Persian language|Persian]] ''lajvard'' for blue.&lt;ref name=&quot;VandA&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O256542/tile-fragment/ | title=Tile fragment | publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum | accessdate=11 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
Lazurite and [[hauyne]] seem to have the same structure and both are sulfate-dominant minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |authors=Moore, T.P., Woodside, R. W. M. |year=2014 |title=The Sar-e-Sang Lapis Mines |journal=Mineralogical Record |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=281–336}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lazurite is a [[pigment]] (opalescent) and has a bright blue streak (especially as a component of the semiprecious stone [[lapis lazuli]]). Many hauynes have a white or pale blue streak and are translucent. The difference might be a consequence of the [[Redox potential|redox state]] (sulfate to sulfide ratio).&lt;ref name=Sapozhnikov/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |authors=Hettmann K, Wenzel T, Marks M, Markl G |year=2012 |title=The sulfur speciation in S-bearing minerals: New constraints by a combination of electron microprobe analysis and DFT calculations with special reference to sodalite-group minerals |journal=American Mineralogist |volume=97 |issue=10 |pages=1653–1661|doi=10.2138/am.2012.4031 |s2cid=54921328 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lapis lazuli''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|æ|p|ɪ|s|_|ˈ|l|æ|zj|ʊ|l|i|,_|-|l|aɪ}}), or '''lapis''' for short, is a deep-blue [[metamorphic rock]] used as a [[Gemstone|semi-precious stone]] that has been prized since [[ancient history|antiquity]] for its intense color.

As early as the [[7th millennium BCE]], lapis lazuli was mined in the [[Sar-i Sang]] mines,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashok Roy 2009&quot;&gt;David Bomford and Ashok Roy, ''A Closer Look- Colour'' (2009), National Gallery Company, London, ({{ISBN|978-1-85709-442-8}})&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Shortugai]], and in other mines in [[Badakhshan]] province in northeast [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moorey|first=Peter Roger|title=Ancient Mesopotamian Materials and Industries: the Archaeological Evidence|year=1999|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=978-1-57506-042-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_Ixuott4doC&amp;q=Lapis+lazuli+++mines+in+the+Badakhshan&amp;pg=PA86|pages=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lapis lazuli artifacts, dated to 7570 BCE, have been found at [[Bhirrana]], which is the oldest site of [[Indus Valley Civilisation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Excavation Bhirrana {{!}} ASI Nagpur|url=http://excnagasi.in/excavation_bhirrana.html|access-date=2020-08-21|website=excnagasi.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lapis was highly valued by the Indus Valley Civilisation (7570–1900 BCE).&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Sarkar|first1=Anindya|last2=Mukherjee|first2=Arati Deshpande|last3=Bera|first3=M.

By the end of the [[Middle Ages]], lapis lazuli began to be exported to Europe, where it was ground into powder and made into [[ultramarine]], the finest and most expensive of all blue [[pigment]]s. Ultramarine was used by some of the most important artists of the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]], including [[Masaccio]], [[Perugino]], [[Titian]] and [[Vermeer]], and was often reserved for the clothing of the central figures of their paintings, especially the [[Virgin Mary]]. Ultramarine has also been found in [[dental tartar]] of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[nuns]] and [[scribes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why a Medieval Woman Had Lapis Lazuli Hidden in Her Teeth |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/01/the-woman-with-lapis-lazuli-in-her-teeth/579760/ |first=Sarah |last=Zhang |publisher=[[The Atlantic]] |date=January 9, 2019 |accessdate=May 9, 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major sources==
Mines in northeast Afghanistan continue to be a major source of lapis lazuli. Important amounts are also produced from mines west of [[Lake Baikal]] in Russia,  and in the [[Andes]] mountains in Chile which is the source that the [[Inca]] used to carve artifacts and jewelry from. Smaller quantities are mined in Pakistan, Italy, Mongolia, the United States, and Canada.&lt;ref name=CGA&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gemstone.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=117:sapphire&amp;catid=1:gem-by-gem&amp;Itemid=14|title=ICA - ICA|website=www.gemstone.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{lang|la|Lapis}} is the [[Latin]] word for &quot;stone&quot; and {{lang|la|lazulī}} is the [[genitive]] form of the [[Medieval Latin]] {{lang|la|lazulum}}, which is taken from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] {{lang|ar| لازورد}} {{transl|ar|lāzaward}}, itself from the [[Persian language|Persian]] {{lang|fa|لاجورد}} {{transl|fa|lājevard}}, which is the name of the stone in Persian,&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt;  and also of a place where lapis lazuli was mined. {{lang|la|Lazulum}} is etymologically related to the color blue and used as a root for the word for blue in several languages, including Spanish and Portuguese {{lang|es|azul}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=lapis lazuli (lazurite) |title=Elsevier's Dictionary of Chemoetymology |url=https://archive.org/details/elseviersdiction00senn |url-access=limited |last=Senning |first=Alexander |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-0-444-52239-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/elseviersdiction00senn/page/n232 224] |chapter-url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=azure |title=An Etymological Dictionary of Modern English |url=https://archive.org/details/etymologicaldict00week |url-access=registration |last=Weekley |first=Ernest |authorlink= |year=1967 |publisher=Dover Publications |location=New York |isbn= |page=[https://archive.org/details/etymologicaldict00week/page/n50 97] |chapter-url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science and uses==
===Composition===
The most important mineral component of lapis lazuli is [[lazurite]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mindat.org/min-2330.html|title=Lapis lazuli: Mineral information, data and localities.|website=www.mindat.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (25% to 40%), a blue [[feldspathoid]] [[silicate mineral]] with the formula (Na,Ca)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;(AlSiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(S,SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;,Cl)&lt;sub&gt;1-2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mindat.org/min-2357.html|title=Lazurite: Mineral information, data and localities.|website=www.mindat.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most lapis lazuli also contains [[calcite]] (white), [[sodalite]] (blue), and [[pyrite]] (metallic yellow). Some samples of lapis lazuli contain [[augite]], [[diopside]], [[enstatite]], [[mica]], [[hauynite]], [[hornblende]], [[nosean]], and sulfur-rich [[löllingite]] ''geyerite''.

Lapis lazuli usually occurs in crystalline [[marble]] as a result of [[contact metamorphism]].

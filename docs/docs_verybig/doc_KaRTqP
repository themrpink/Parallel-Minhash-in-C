UCI Anteater's golf team won the NCAA Division II national team championship in 1975 with team member Jerry Wisz winning the individual title. At the NCAA national championships in 1973, 1974 and 1976, those teams finished second twice and fourth the other year. These teams included seven All-Americans. 

[[2015 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|In 2015]], for the first time, the [[UC Irvine Anteaters men's basketball]] team appeared in the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Division I tournament]]. It was narrowly defeated in a first-round tournament game by [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]]. The Anteaters made their second NCAA appearance [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|in 2019]], beating fourth-seed [[Kansas State University]] for their first March Madness win ever.

=== Anteater as mascot ===
The [[anteater]] was chosen in 1965 when students were allowed to submit mascot candidates, which would be voted on in a campus election. Three undergraduates named Pat Glasgow, Bob Ernst, and Schuyler Hadley Basset III were credited with choosing the anteater and designing a cartoon representation, having been disappointed with other candidates such as a roadrunner, unicorn, seahawk and golden bison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter, the Anteater: History of the Mascot (Zot) |year=2006 |publisher=University of California, Irvine |url=http://www.admissions.uci.edu/mascot.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20060904043145/http://www.admissions.uci.edu/mascot.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2006-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While often attributed to the [[Johnny Hart]] comic strip ''[[B.C. (comic strip)|B.C.]]'', the original anteater design was based on the ''Playboy'' bunny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='B.C.' comic strip artist coming to Celebrate UCI|url=http://news.uci.edu/features/b-c-comic-strip-artist-coming-to-celebrate-uci/|work=UC Irvine News, 11 April 2011|publisher=University of California, Irvine|access-date=30 April 2013|date=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1965, the UCI students officially voted on the anteater. In a special follow-up election, students opted for a mascot based on the ''B.C.'' anteater over the ''Playboy'' version.

A hand signal called &quot;Rip'em 'Eaters&quot; was created by Blake Sasaki and Dennis Wisco in 2001. When attacked, an anteater sits in a tripodal position with its hind feet and tail and tears and &quot;rips&quot; at its predator. The hand signal is done by touching the tips of the two middle fingers with the thumb, and sliding the thumb back, making the pinky and index finger the ears and the fingers in the middle the snout of the anteater.

In August 2007, a small stuffed anteater accompanied astronaut [[Tracy Caldwell]] on [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'']] mission [[STS-118]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Beaumont Grad To Celebrate Birthday In Space | url=http://www.knbc.com/news/13847193/detail.html | publisher=KNBC (NBC4 Los Angeles) | date=August 8, 2007 | access-date=August 10, 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927015233/http://www.knbc.com/news/13847193/detail.html | archive-date=September 27, 2007 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Goldbach's conjecture''' is one of the oldest and best-known [[list of unsolved problems in mathematics|unsolved problem]]s in [[number theory]] and all of [[mathematics]]. It states:

:Every [[even and odd numbers|even]] [[integer]] greater than 2 is the sum of two [[prime number|primes]].&lt;ref name=MathWorldConj&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Goldbach Conjecture|urlname=GoldbachConjecture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conjecture has been shown to hold for all integers less than 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieeta.pt/~tos/goldbach.html|title=Goldbach conjecture verification|first=Tomás Oliveira e|last=Silva|date=|website=www.ieeta.pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; but remains unproven despite considerable effort.

A Goldbach number is a positive even integer that can be expressed as the sum of two odd primes.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Goldbach Number|urlname=GoldbachNumber}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 4 is the only even number greater than 2 that requires the even prime 2 in order to be written as the sum of two primes, another form of the statement of Goldbach's conjecture is that all even integers greater than 4 are Goldbach numbers.

The expression of a given even number as a sum of two primes is called a Goldbach [[Partition (number theory)|partition]] of that number. The following are examples of Goldbach partitions for some even numbers:
: 6 = 3 + 3
: 8 = 3 + 5
: 10 = 3 + 7 = 5 + 5
: 12 = 7 + 5 
: ...
: 100 = 3 + 97 = 11 + 89 = 17 + 83 = 29 + 71 = 41 + 59 = 47 + 53
: ...

The number of ways in which 2''n'' can be written as the sum of two primes (for ''n'' starting at 1) is:
: 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 4, 4, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 5, 3, 4, 6, 3, 5, 6, 2, 5, 6, 5, 5, 7, 4, 5, 8, 5, 4, 9, 4, 5, 7, 3, 6, 8, 5, 6, 8, 6, 7, 10, 6, 6, 12, 4, 5, 10, 3, ... {{OEIS|id=A045917}}.

==Origins==
On 7 June 1742, the German mathematician [[Christian Goldbach]] wrote a letter to [[Leonhard Euler]] (letter XLIII),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/correspondence/letters/OO0765.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in which he proposed the following conjecture:
: Every integer that can be written as the sum of two primes can also be written as the sum of as many primes as one wishes, until all terms are units.
Goldbach was following the now-abandoned convention of considering 1 to be a [[prime number]],&lt;ref name=MathWorldConj /&gt; so that a sum of units would indeed be a sum of primes.
He then proposed a second conjecture in the margin of his letter, which is easily seen to imply the first:
: Every integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of three primes.&lt;ref&gt;In the printed version published by P.H. Fuss [http://eulerarchive.maa.org//correspondence/letters/OO0765.pdf] 2 is misprinted as 1 in the marginal conjecture.&lt;/ref&gt;
Euler replied in a letter dated 30 June 1742&lt;ref&gt;http://eulerarchive.maa.org//correspondence/letters/OO0766.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and reminded Goldbach of an earlier conversation they had had ({{lang|de|&quot;…so Ew vormals mit mir communicirt haben…&quot;}}), in which Goldbach had remarked that the first of those two conjectures would follow from the statement
: Every positive even integer can be written as the sum of two primes.
This is in fact equivalent to his second, marginal conjecture.
In the letter dated 30 June 1742, Euler stated:&lt;ref name=&quot;theorema&quot;&gt;{{cite web

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{lang|de|&quot;Dass … ein jeder numerus par eine summa duorum primorum sey, halte ich für ein ganz gewisses theorema, ungeachtet ich dasselbe nicht demonstriren kann.&quot;}} (&quot;That … every even integer is a sum of two primes, I regard as a completely certain theorem, although I cannot prove it.&quot;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Each of the three conjectures above has a natural analog in terms of the modern definition of a prime, under which 1 is excluded.
A modern version of the first conjecture is:
: Every integer that can be written as the sum of two primes can also be written as the sum of as many primes as one wishes, until either all terms are two (if the integer is even) or one term is three and all other terms are two (if the integer is odd).
A modern version of the marginal conjecture is:
: '''Every integer greater than 5 can be written as the sum of three primes'''.
And a modern version of Goldbach's older conjecture of which Euler reminded him is:
: '''Every even integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two primes'''.

These modern versions might not be entirely equivalent to the corresponding original statements. For example, if there were an even integer &lt;math&gt; N=p+1 &lt;/math&gt; larger than 4, for &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; a prime, that could not be expressed as the sum of two primes in the modern sense, then it would  be a counterexample to the modern version (without of course being a counterexample to the original version) of the third conjecture. The modern version is thus probably stronger (but in order to confirm that, one would have to prove that the first version, freely applied to any positive even integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, could not possibly rule out the existence of such a specific counterexample &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;). In any case, the modern statements have the same relationships with each other as the older statements did. That is, the second and third modern statements are equivalent, and either implies the first modern statement.

The third modern statement (equivalent to the second) is the form in which the conjecture is usually expressed today. It is also known as the &quot;[[Mathematical jargon#strong|strong]]&quot;, &quot;even&quot;, or &quot;binary&quot; Goldbach conjecture. A weaker form of the second modern statement, known as &quot;[[Goldbach's weak conjecture]]&quot;, the &quot;odd Goldbach conjecture&quot;, or the &quot;ternary Goldbach conjecture,&quot; asserts that 
: ''Every odd integer greater than 7 can be written as the sum of three odd primes'',
A proof for the weak conjecture was proposed in 2013; it has however not yet appeared in a peer-reviewed publication.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helfgott 2013&quot;&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1305.2897 |title = Major arcs for Goldbach's theorem |last = Helfgott |first = H. A. |class=math.NT |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Helfgott 2012&quot;&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1205.5252 |title = Minor arcs for Goldbach's problem |last = Helfgott |first = H. A. |class=math.NT |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the weak conjecture would be a corollary of the strong conjecture: if {{math|''n'' – 3}} is a sum of two primes, then {{math|''n''}} is a sum of three primes. But the converse implication and thus the strong Goldbach conjecture remain unproven.

==Verified results==
For small values of ''n'', the strong Goldbach conjecture (and hence the weak Goldbach conjecture) can be verified directly.  For instance, Nils Pipping in 1938 laboriously verified the conjecture up to ''n''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Pipping, Nils (1890–1982), &quot;Die Goldbachsche Vermutung und der Goldbach-Vinogradowsche Satz&quot;. Acta Acad. Aboensis, Math. Phys. 11, 4–25, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;  With the advent of computers, many more values of ''n'' have been checked; T. Oliveira e Silva ran a distributed computer search that has verified the conjecture for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; (and double-checked up to 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;) as of 2013. One record from this search is that {{val|3,325,581,707,333,960,528}} is the smallest number that has no Goldbach partition with a prime below 9781.&lt;ref&gt;Tomás Oliveira e Silva, [http://www.ieeta.pt/~tos/goldbach.html Goldbach conjecture verification]. Retrieved 20 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heuristic justification==
Statistical considerations that focus on the [[prime number theorem|probabilistic distribution of prime numbers]] present informal evidence in favour of the conjecture (in both the weak and strong forms) for [[sufficiently large]] integers: the greater the integer, the more ways there are available for that number to be represented as the sum of two or three other numbers, and the more &quot;likely&quot; it becomes that at least one of these representations consists entirely of primes.

[[Image:Goldbach-1000.svg|thumbnail|right|288px|Number of ways to write an even number ''n'' as the sum of two primes (4&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1,000), {{OEIS|A002375}}]]
[[Image:Goldbach-1000000.png|thumbnail|right|288px|Number of ways to write an even number ''n'' as the sum of two primes (4&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;{{val|1,000,000}})]]

A very crude version of the [[heuristic]] probabilistic argument (for the strong form of the Goldbach conjecture) is as follows.  The [[prime number theorem]] asserts that an integer ''m'' selected at random has roughly a &lt;math&gt;1/\ln m&lt;/math&gt; chance of being prime.  Thus if ''n'' is a large even integer and ''m'' is a number between 3 and ''n''/2, then one might expect the probability of ''m'' and ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''m'' simultaneously being prime to be &lt;math&gt;1 \big/ \big[\ln m \, \ln(n - m)\big]&lt;/math&gt;.  If one pursues this heuristic, one might expect the total number of ways to write a large even integer ''n'' as the sum of two odd primes to be roughly

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=3}^{n/2} \frac{1}{\ln m} \frac{1}{\ln(n - m)} \approx \frac{n}{2 (\ln n)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since this quantity goes to infinity as ''n'' increases, we expect that every large even integer has not just one representation as the sum of two primes, but in fact has very many such representations.

This heuristic argument is actually somewhat inaccurate, because it assumes that the events of ''m'' and ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''m'' being prime are [[statistical independence|statistically independent]] of each other.  For instance, if ''m'' is odd, then ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''m'' is also odd, and if ''m'' is even, then ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''m'' is even, a non-trivial relation because, besides the number 2, only odd numbers can be prime.  Similarly, if ''n'' is divisible by 3, and ''m'' was already a prime distinct from 3, then ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''m'' would also be [[coprime]] to 3 and thus be slightly more likely to be prime than a general number.  Pursuing this type of analysis more carefully, [[G. H. Hardy|Hardy]] and [[John Edensor Littlewood|Littlewood]] in 1923 conjectured (as part of their famous ''Hardy–Littlewood prime tuple conjecture'') that for any fixed ''c''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2, the number of representations of a large integer ''n'' as the sum of ''c'' primes &lt;math&gt;n = p_1 + \cdots + p_c&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;p_1 \leq \cdots \leq p_c&lt;/math&gt; should be [[asymptotic analysis|asymptotically]] equal to

: &lt;math&gt;\left(\prod_p \frac{p \gamma_{c,p}(n)}{(p - 1)^c}\right)
 \int_{2 \leq x_1 \leq \cdots \leq x_c: x_1 + \cdots + x_c = n} \frac{dx_1 \cdots dx_{c-1}}{\ln x_1 \cdots \ln x_c},&lt;/math&gt;

where the product is over all primes ''p'', and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{c,p}(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of solutions to the equation
&lt;math&gt;n = q_1 + \cdots + q_c \mod p&lt;/math&gt; in [[modular arithmetic]], subject to the [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraints]] &lt;math&gt;q_1, \ldots, q_c \neq 0 \mod p&lt;/math&gt;.  This formula has been rigorously proven to be asymptotically valid for ''c''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;3 from the work of [[Ivan Matveevich Vinogradov|Vinogradov]], but is still only a conjecture when &lt;math&gt;c = 2&lt;/math&gt;.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} In the latter case, the above formula simplifies to 0 when ''n'' is odd, and to

: &lt;math&gt;
 2 \Pi_2 \left(\prod_{p \mid n; p \geq 3} \frac{p - 1}{p - 2}\right) \int_2^n \frac{dx}{(\ln x)^2}
 \approx 2 \Pi_2 \left(\prod_{p \mid n; p \geq 3} \frac{p - 1}{p - 2}\right) \frac{n}{(\ln n)^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

when ''n'' is even, where &lt;math&gt;\Pi_2&lt;/math&gt; is [[Twin prime#First Hardy–Littlewood conjecture|Hardy–Littlewood's twin prime constant]]

: &lt;math&gt;\Pi_2 := \prod_{p \geq 3} \left(1 - \frac{1}{(p - 1)^2}\right) = 0.6601618158\ldots.&lt;/math&gt;

This is sometimes known as the ''extended Goldbach conjecture''.  The strong Goldbach conjecture is in fact very similar to the [[twin prime conjecture]], and the two conjectures are believed to be of roughly comparable difficulty.

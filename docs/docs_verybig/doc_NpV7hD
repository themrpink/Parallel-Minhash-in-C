The '''College of Sorbonne''' ({{lang-fr|Collège de Sorbonne}}) was a [[theological college]] of the [[University of Paris]], founded in 1253 (confirmed in 1257) by [[Robert de Sorbon]] (1201–1274), after whom it was named.&lt;ref&gt;De Ridder-Symoens, Hilde. [https://books.google.com/books?id=5Z1VBEbF0HAC&amp;pg=PA214] ''[[A History of the University in Europe|A History of the University in Europe: Volume 1, Universities in the Middle Ages]]''. Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 2003: 80. {{ISBN|0-521-54113-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rest of the Paris colleges, the Sorbonne itself disestablished by decree of 5 April 1792, after the [[French Revolution]]. It was restored in 1808 but finally closed in 1882. 

In recent times it came to refer to the group of [[liberal arts]] faculties of the [[University of Paris]], as opposed to the [[vocational]] faculties of law and medicine.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionniare historique de Paris'', Le Livre de Poche, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Sorbonne&quot; is also used to refer to the [[Sorbonne|main building]]  of the [[University of Paris]] in the [[5th arrondissement of Paris]], which houses several faculties created when the University was divided up into thirteen autonomous universities in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionnaire historique de Paris'', Le Livre de Poche. (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Robert de Sorbon]] was the son of peasants from the village of [[Sorbon]] in the [[Ardennes (department)|Ardennes]], who had become a master of theology, a canon of the Cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]], and the confessor and chaplain of King [[Louis IX]] (Saint Louis). At the time that he founded his college, the [[University of Paris]] had already been in existence for half a century, and already had thousands of students.  Obtaining a higher degree in theology could take as long as twenty years, and therefore required considerable financial support.  Students who belonged to the religious orders of the Franciscans and Dominicans, or from the large monasteries of Cluny or Citeaux, received housing and board from their religious orders, but independent students did not.  Sorbon founded his college to provide housing and board for poorer students of theology who did not have such support.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionniare historique de Paris'', Le Livre de Poche, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Sorbon purchased several houses on Rue Coupe-Gueule (now Rue de la Sorbonne) and made them into lodging for students. The college was founded in 1253. [[Louis IX of France]] confirmed the foundation in 1257.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sorbonne.fr/la-sorbonne/histoire-de-la-sorbonne/la-fondation-de-la-sorbonne-au-moyen-age-par-le-theologien-robert-de-sorbon/ « Fondation Sorbonne au Moyen Age - Robert de Sorbon »]&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the college has about twenty students, called ''socii''.  As the college grew, Sorbon provided a library containing over a thousand volumes by 1292, the largest in the university, and a chapel.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionniare historique de Paris'', Le Livre de Poche, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
The Sorbonne became the most distinguished theological institution in France, and its doctors were frequently called upon to render opinions on important ecclesiastical and theological issues. In 1470, the Sorbonne had one of the first printing presses in France.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionnaire historique de Paris'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;  It was particularly active in the effort to suppress heresy and the spread of [[Protestant]] doctrines.  Its students included [[Cardinal Richelieu]], who studied there from 1606 to 1607.   Richelieu became Proviseur, or administrator of the college on 29 August 1622.  Between 1635 and 1642, Richelieu renovated the Sorbonne;  he consolidated the Sorbonne with two smaller colleges, and built a complex of new buildings, including a domed chapel, around a large courtyard.  Richelieu left a large part of his fortune and his library to the Sorbonne, and he was buried in the chapel.  Only the chapel remains of the Richelieu era buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Sarmant, Thierry, ''Histoire de Paris'' (2012), Editions Jean-Paul Gisserot, Paris. ({{ISBN|978-2-755-8033-03}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sorbonne was closed to students in 1791 during the [[French Revolution]]. For a brief time, under [[Robespierre]], the chapel became a Temple of Reason.  [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] turned the college buildings into studios for artists.  In 1822, it became the home of the faculties of letters, sciences and theology of the University of Paris.
In 1885,  as part of the Third Republic policy of separation of church and state, the theology faculty was officially closed.  The old buildings of the Sorbonne, with the exception of the chapel, were demolished and the new Sorbonne building, designed by [[Henri Paul Nénot]],  opened in 1889, the centenary of the French Revolution.  It contained a large amphitheater, reception halls and meeting rooms, the offices of the rector of the University of Paris, and the faculties of arts and sciences.  The chapel was no longer used for religious services, but only for official ceremonies and exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionnaire historique de Paris'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, as a result of the riots of demonstrations of May 1968, the University of Paris was broken up into thirteen independent faculties.  The New Sorbonne building became the home of the Universities of Paris I, II, III, IV, V, the [[École Nationale des Chartes]], and the [[École pratique des hautes études]].

==Foundation==
[[Robert de Sorbon]], a native of [[Le Réthelois]], was a distinguished professor and famous preacher who lived from 1201 till 1274. Sorbon found that there was a defect in the primitive organization of the University of Paris. The two principal [[mendicant]] orders—the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and the [[Franciscans]]—each had [[college]]s at Paris where they delivered lectures which extern students could attend without fee.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;

Robert de Sorbon decided that the university should also provide free instruction, so that it could compete with the religious orders. Further, he believed the society of professors should follow the practices of the [[cenobitic]] life, except in vows.  His important work was made possible by the high esteem in which de Sorbon was held at Paris, together with his intellectual brilliance, great generosity, and the assistance of his friends.  The foundation dates from 1257 or the beginning of 1258. [[Guillaume de Saint-Amour]], [[Gérard d'Abbeville]], [[Henry of Ghent]], [[Guillaume des Grez]], [[Odo or Eudes of Douai]], [[Chrétien de Beauvais]], [[Gérard de Reims]], [[Nicolas de Bar]] were among the most illustrious scholars connected either with the first chairs in the Sorbonne, or with the first association that constituted it.  These [[Expert|savants]] were already attached to the university staff.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;

==Organization==
The constitution of the society as conceived by De Sorbon was simple: an administrator (''provisor''), associates (''socii''), and guests (''hospites''). The provisor was the head; nothing could be done without consulting him; he installed the members selected by the society, and confirmed the statutes drawn up by it; he had to provide for everything.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;

The associates formed the body of the society. To be admitted to it, the candidate was required to have taught a course of [[philosophy]]. There were two kinds of associates, the {{lang|fr|bursaires}} and the {{lang|fr|pensionnaires}}. The latter paid forty (Paris) pounds a year; the former were provided for by the house. The [[bursary|burse]] could be granted only to persons not having an income of forty (Paris) pounds. There was a ''[[primus inter pares]]'', the [[prior]], who presided over all internal affairs of the house.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;

[[Doctorate|Doctor]]s and [[bachelor's degree|bachelor]]s were alike eligible, but, owing to the number of the latter, the custom rapidly grew up of selecting only bachelors.  Other persons were candidates for admission to the society rather than members of it. From the material and intellectual point of view, they enjoyed the same privileges as the members: board, lodging, books, spiritual and scholastic exercises but they had no votes. When they had fulfilled the condition of teaching philosophy, they were admissible as members. The course of studies lasted ten years, during which time their burses continued; but if, at the end of ten years, they had not given proof of their ability, either as teachers or as preachers, they had to give up their burse.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;

==History==
The ordinary lectures were public, and consequently were attended by students who belonged to neither of the divisions of the society. The doctors and bachelors were authorized to give shelter to other poor pupils. Besides the work of the classroom, there was the duty of preaching or labouring in the parishes. In preparation for this, the associates, on certain days, had to deliver sermons or conferences (''collationes'') to the community. The purely spiritual side was not forgotten.  Conferences, usually delivered by the prior, on this important part of the Christian and priestly life were given especially to the interns.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;

For twenty years the ability of the administrator, or provisor, corresponded to the foreseeing devotedness of the founder. This stretch of time showed the effectiveness of the administrative measures which De Sorbon had adopted.  He had written down the rules in thirty-eight articles.  This rule was directed towards the maintenance of common life, from silence in the refectory, to simplicity of authorized dress. As circumstances permitted, about 1271 De Sorbon added a literary college: this was the [[Collège de Calvi]] or the &quot;little Sorbonne&quot;.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;

The constitution which Robert de Sorbon gave to his college lasted for centuries. If Claude Héméré (1574–1650, librarian of the Sorbonne) saw in the project the conception of a powerful intellect, &quot;Hoc primus in lycaeo Parisiensi vidit Robertus&quot;, its realization became a model college for others.  The expression ''Pauvres maîtres et étudiants en théologie'' seems to emphasize the two primary characteristics of the society: equality in poverty, an equality so perfect between masters and pupils that it designated them by a common name; the poverty of the pupils, since most of them were bursaires; the poverty of the masters, since, content with what was strictly necessary, they renounced all other professional remuneration. This equality was always maintained with scrupulous care; the Sorbon repeated as an axiom, ''Omnes nos sumus socii et aequales'', and referred to the college as ''pauperem nostram Sorbonem''.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;

From the outset the college enjoyed the favour of the Holy See. [[Pope Alexander IV]] (1259) urged the French [[bishop]]s to support it, [[Urban IV]] (1262) recommended it to the goodwill of the whole Christian world, and [[Clement IV]] (1268) granted it papal approbation.  Wealthy benefactors provided it with ample endowment. A high standard of scholarship was maintained and the severity of the ''actus Sorbonnicus'', or examination for degrees, including the defence of the &quot;thesis Robertina&quot;, became proverbial. The professorial corps was highly respected.  From all parts of Europe, theological and political questions were sent to it for solution.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;

In 1470 the Sorbonne introduced the art of printing into France by calling to Paris three of [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]'s associates, [[Gering (printer)|Gering]], [[Friburger]], and [[Crantz (printer)|Crantz]].  Among its principal patrons and benefactors was [[Cardinal Richelieu]], who held for a time the office of provisor and who, in 1635, laid the cornerstone of an edifice to be built at his expense for the use of the college. He was buried in the [[church of the Sorbonne]], where his tomb is still preserved.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;

The doctors of the college were loyal defenders of the Catholic faith against the inroads of [[Protestantism]] and [[the Enlightenment]].  As other teachers of theology in the university became members of the Sorbonne, by the beginning of the sixteenth century, its staff was practically identical with the university faculty.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt; De Sorbon had created a library. It expanded rapidly, due to numerous gifts.

On the other hand, the professors gave their support to [[Gallicanism]] and obliged their members to subscribe to the &quot;four articles&quot;.  This attitude naturally weakened the prestige of the Sorbonne as a theological school.  Ecclesiastical students had to seek their education in the seminaries. The Sorbonne itself was disestablished by decree of 5 April 1792, after the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;

Napoleon restored it in 1808 as the theological faculty of the newly organized university. It did not, however, regain its former standing or influence, though it continued in existence until 1882, when it was finally suppressed. In 1884 the construction of the present building was begun and it was completed in 1889. At the beginning of the 20th century, it was occupied by the various departments of [[literature|letters]] and [[science]] which formed the [[École des Hautes Etudes]].&lt;ref name=Catholic&gt;{{Catholic|wstitle=Sorbonne|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leonardo Bruni''' (or '''Leonardo Aretino'''; c. 1370 – March 9, 1444) was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[humanism|humanist]], historian and statesman, often recognized as the most important humanist historian of the early [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Writing History in Renaissance Italy: Leonardo Bruni and the Uses of the Past|author= Gary Ianziti |year=2012|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn= 978-0674061521|page=432}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been called the first modern historian.&lt;ref name=hankins-2001&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/results-list.php?collection=1389 |title=History of the Florentine People | volume=1 | author1=Leonardo Bruni|author2=James Hankins|date=October 9, 2010 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Boston }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the earliest person to write using the three-period view of history: [[Ancient history|Antiquity]], [[Middle Ages]], and [[Modern history|Modern]]. The dates Bruni used to define the periods are not exactly what modern historians use today, but he laid the conceptual groundwork for a tripartite division of history.

==Biography==
Leonardo Bruni was born in [[Arezzo]], [[Tuscany]] circa 1370. Bruni was the pupil of political and cultural leader [[Coluccio Salutati]], whom he succeeded as [[Chancellor of Florence]], and under whose tutelage he developed his ideation of [[civic humanism]]. He also served as apostolic secretary to four popes (1405–1414).&lt;ref name=&quot;hankins-2001&quot;/&gt; Bruni's years as chancellor, 1410 to 1411 and again from 1427 to his death in 1444, were plagued by warfare. Though he occupied one of the highest political offices, Bruni was relatively powerless, compared to the [[Albizzi]] and [[Medici]] families. Historian Arthur Field has identified Bruni as an apparent plotter against [[Cosimo de' Medici]] in 1437 (see below). Bruni died in 1444 in Florence and was succeeded in office by [[Carlo Marsuppini]].

==Significance==
[[File:Bruni - De primo bello punico, circa 1471 - 2365945.jpg|thumb|''De primo bello punico'', 1471]]
Bruni's most notable work is ''Historiarum Florentini populi libri XII'' (History of the Florentine People, 12 Books), which has been called the first modern history book.&lt;ref name=hankins-2001/&gt; While it probably was not Bruni's intention to [[Secularism|secularize]] history, the three period view of history is unquestionably secular and so Bruni has been called the first modern historian.&lt;ref name=hankins-2001/&gt; The foundation of Bruni's conception can be found with [[Petrarch]], who distinguished the classical period from later cultural decline, or ''tenebrae'' (literally &quot;darkness&quot;). Bruni argued that Italy had revived in recent centuries and could therefore be described as entering a new age.

One of Bruni's most famous works is ''New Cicero'', a biography of the Roman statesman Cicero. He was also the author of biographies in Italian of Dante and Petrarch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03011b.htm &quot;Leonardo Bruni&quot;] ''Catholic Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; It was Bruni who used the phrase ''[[studia humanitatis]]'', meaning the study of human endeavors, as distinct from those of theology and metaphysics, the source of the term [[humanists]].

As a humanist Bruni was essential in translating into Latin many works of Greek philosophy and history, such as [[Aristotle]] and [[Procopius]]. Bruni's translations of Aristotle's ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' and ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', as well as the pseudo-Aristotelean ''Economics'', were widely distributed in manuscript and in print. His use of [[Aelius Aristides]]' ''[[Panathenicus (Panegyric to Athens)]]'' to buttress his republican theses in the ''[[Laudatio florentinae urbis|Panegyric to the City of Florence]]'' (c. 1401) was instrumental in bringing the Greek historian to the attention of Renaissance political philosophers (see [[Hans Baron]]'s ''The Crisis of the Early Italian Renaissance'' for details). He also wrote a short treatise in Greek on the Florentine constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart M. McManus, 'Byzantines in the Florentine polis: Ideology, Statecraft and ritual during the Council of Florence', ''The Journal of the Oxford University History Society'', 6 (Michaelmas 2008/Hilary 2009), pp. 8-10&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruni was one of the first Humanists to confront Plato's discussion of same-sex relationships. (Reeser)

Bruni died in Florence in 1444, and is buried in a wall tomb by [[Bernardo Rossellino]] in the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Levey|Levey, Michael]]; ''Early Renaissance'',p. 57-9, 1967, Penguin&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Portland Institute for Contemporary Art''' (PICA) is a [[Performance art|contemporary performance]] and [[visual art]]s organization in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] in the U.S. state of [[Oregon]]. PICA was founded in 1995 by Kristy Edmunds.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Since 2003, it has presented the annual [[Time-Based Art Festival]] (TBA) every September in Portland, featuring contemporary and experimental visual art, dance, theatre, film/video, music, and educational and public programs from local, national, and international artists. As of November 2017, it is led by Executive Director Victoria Frey and Artistic Directors Roya Amirsoleymani, Erin Boberg Doughton, and Kristan Kennedy.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pdxmonthly.com/articles/2017/11/28/pica-announces-new-leadership-team|title=PICA Announces New Leadership Team|last=McCann|first=Fiona|date=2017-11-28|work=Portland Monthly|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
PICA was founded in 1995 by Kristy Edmunds, at the time the Director of the [[Portland Art Museum]]'s &quot;Art on the Edge&quot; program. The organization's exhibition and performance program was built largely around an itinerant model, utilizing vacant space or rented venues throughout the city of Portland rather than programming a single gallery or theatre year-round.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission and History|url=http://pica.org/about/mission-and-values/|website=Portland Institute for Contemporary Art|access-date=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of PICA's performance programming was grouped into its annual performance seasons, which it produced for seven years before the organization began presenting the Time-Based Art Festival in 2003. The organization's signature event during this time was an annual [[costume party]] fundraiser known as the Dada Ball, which it held from 1996 until 2001 in a variety of vacant spaces throughout the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-316-bye-bye-dada.html|title=BYE BYE DADA|last=Dye|first=Elizabeth|date=2001-09-11|work=Willamette Week|access-date=2017-12-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PICA's offices were housed at [[Boora Architects]] from its founding until about 2001, and then moved to the headquarters of [[Wieden+Kennedy]] in Northwest Portland.&lt;ref name=&quot;dk row 2012&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/art/index.ssf/2012/04/portland_institute_for_contemp_3.html|title=Portland Institute for Contemporary Art's risky move to stay nimble and on the edge|last=Row|first=D.K.|date=April 7, 2012|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|access-date=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; PICA housed its offices within those of Wieden &amp; Kennedy until 2012, and operated an additional {{convert|2200|ft2}} exhibition space in the building until 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-2700-picas-problems.html|title=PICA's Problems: The 8-year-old arts agency cuts staff and exhibits due to financial shortfall|last1=Speer|first1=Richard|date=November 23, 2003|work=Willamette Week|access-date=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2003, PICA began presenting its annual [[Time-Based Art Festival]], a ten-day international festival of [[performance art|contemporary performance]] and [[contemporary art|visual art]] modeled after those in [[Edinburgh Festival|Edinburgh]] and [[Adelaide]] ([[Adelaide Fringe|Fringe]] or [[Adelaide Festival of Arts|main Festival]]?).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shepherd|first1=Julianne|last2=Bowie|first2=Chas|title=It's About Time: Some of the World's Greatest Visionaries of Performance Art Converge in Portland for the First-Ever Time-Based Art Festival|url=http://www.portlandmercury.com/visualart/its-about-time/Content?oid=29767|access-date=4 November 2016|work=Portland Mercury|publisher=Index Newspapers|date=11 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TBA Festival built upon PICA's itinerant model of utilizing multiple venues around the city, including sites such as the former [[Washington High School (Portland, Oregon)|Washington High School]] building in Southeast Portland, which would later become [[Revolution Hall]].

In 2012, PICA moved to a leased third floor space on Southwest 10th Avenue, allowing the organization's offices and resource library to also be used a gallery and performance space when programs required it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/art/index.ssf/2012/04/portland_institute_for_contemp_3.html|title=Portland Institute for Contemporary Art's risky move to stay nimble and on the edge|newspaper=OregonLive.com|access-date=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 19, 2016, PICA announced that the organization was gifted a 20-year no-rent lease on a {{convert|16000|ft2}} building along the [[North Williams Avenue]] corridor by donor Allie Furlotti and the Calligram Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pdxmonthly.com/articles/2016/4/21/pica-lands-new-permanent-home-northeast-portland|title=PICA Lands a New Home in Northeast Portland|last1=McCann|first1=Fiona|date=April 21, 2016|work=Portland Monthly|access-date=November 4, 2016|publisher=SagaCity Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, PICA began utilizing this space as a box office, performance venue, and gallery for their 2016 TBA Festival while maintaining offices in downtown Portland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pica.org/programs/tba-festival/tba16/|title=TBA:16|website=Portland Institute for Contemporary Art|access-date=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2017, PICA's offices were relocated to the renovated Northeast Portland space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pica.org/about/visit-pica/|title=Visit PICA|website=Portland Institute for Contemporary Art|access-date=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leadership ===
Founder Kristy Edmunds left PICA in 2005 to become artistic director for the [[Melbourne International Arts Festival]]. She is now Artistic &amp; Executive Director of the Center for the Art of Performance (CAP) at [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). Mark Russell (producer of [[The Public Theater]]'s [[Under the Radar Festival]] and former director of [[Performance Space 122|P.S.122]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pica.org/event/mark-russell-2/|title=Mark Russell: Next|website=Portland Institute for Contemporary Art|access-date=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CathyEdwardsHire&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/visualarts/2008/07/cathy_edwards_picas_new_guest.html|title=Cathy Edwards: PICA's new guest artistic director|last1=Row|first1=D.K.|date=28 July 2008|work=The Oregonian|access-date=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cathy Edwards (former director of programming for the [[International Festival of Arts and Ideas]]) &lt;ref name=&quot;CathyEdwardsHire&quot; /&gt; operated as the organization's two guest artistic directors from 2006 until 2011. Angela Mattox, the former Performing Arts Curator at [[Yerba Buena Center for the Arts]], was hired as the organization's permanent artistic director in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;AngelaMattoxHire&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orartswatch.org/angela-mattox-new-full-time-pica-artistic-director/|title=Angela Mattox New Full-time PICA Artistic Director|last1=Radon|first1=Lisa|website=Oregon Artswatch|access-date=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mattox left PICA in 2017 following the end of that year's Time-Based Art Festival, her sixth as artistic director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.opb.org/radio/programs/state-of-wonder/article/2017-pica-tba-art-festival-portland-shows-to-see-preview/|title=4 Must-See Shows At PICA's Time-Based Art Festival|last1=Scott|first1=Aaron|date=8 September 2017|work=Oregon Public Broadcasting|access-date=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PICA announced on November 28, 2017, that long-time programming staff members Roya Amirsoleymani (previously Director of Community Engagement), Erin Boberg Doughton (previously Performing Arts Program Director), and Kristan Kennedy (previously Visual Art Curator) had been selected as the organization's Artistic Directors.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

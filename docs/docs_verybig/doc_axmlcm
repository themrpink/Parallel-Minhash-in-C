An '''independent city''' or '''independent town''' is a [[city]] or [[town]] that does not form part of another general-purpose local government entity (such as a [[province]]).

==Historical precursors==
In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and to a degree in its [[successor state]]s the [[German Confederation]] and the [[German Empire]], so-called &quot;[[Free imperial city|free imperial cities]]&quot; (nominative singular ''freie Reichsstadt'', nominative plural ''freie Reichsstädte'') held the legal status of [[imperial immediacy]], according to which they were not [[Subinfeudation|subinfeudated]] to any [[vassal]] ruler and were instead subject to the authority of the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] alone. Examples included [[Hamburg]], [[Bremen]], and [[Lübeck]], along with others that gained and/or lost the privileges of immediacy over the course of the Empire's history.

==National capitals==
A number of countries have made their national capitals into separate entities.

===Federal capitals===
{{main|Federal city}}
In countries with a [[federation|federal]] structure, the federal capital is often separate from other jurisdictions in the country, and frequently has a unique system of government.

== Africa ==

=== Ethiopia ===
[[Addis Ababa]], capital of [[Ethiopia]], has held the designation of [[chartered city]] since 1991, when it was separated from the former province of [[Shewa]]. It shares this status with one other city, [[Dire Dawa]].

=== Mali ===
[[Bamako]], the capital of [[Mali]], is contained within the Bamako Capital District.

=== Niger ===
[[Niger|Niger's]] capital, [[Niamey]], comprises a capital district of Niger. It is surrounded by the [[Tillabéri Department]].

=== Nigeria ===
[[Nigeria]]'s capital [[Abuja]] is located in the [[Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria|Federal Capital Territory]]. The Territory was established in 1976, and the capital was formally moved from [[Lagos]] (the historic capital) in 1991.

==Asia==
{{unsourced section|date=March 2018}}
=== Republic of China (Taiwan) ===
In [[Free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan Area]] under the [[Administrative divisions of the Republic of China|administrative division system]] of the Republic of China, some cities are [[Special municipality (Republic of China)|directly administered]] by the [[Executive Yuan]], some are [[Provincial city (Republic of China)|administered by provinces]] (the province of Taiwan is nominal), and some are [[county-administered city|subordinate to counties]]. The centrally-administered ([[Taipei City]], [[Kaohsiung City]], [[New Taipei City]], [[Taichung City]], [[Tainan City]], and [[Taoyuan City]]) and province-administered ones are like independent cities under this definition.

===South Korea===
In addition to its nine provinces, South Korea has seven province-level &quot;metropolitan cities.&quot; By far the largest among these in terms of population is the capital, [[Seoul]], called a ''teukbyeol-si'' (특별시; literally, special city), which is home to more than 20% of the entire population of the country. The remaining six independent cities are called ''gwangyeok-si'' (광역시; literally, large city) whose names are: [[Busan]], [[Daegu]], [[Daejeon]], [[Incheon]], [[Gwangju]], and [[Ulsan]].

Historically, these independent cities have been carved from the province that surrounds them. Consequently, they typically share a strong regional and cultural identity with the adjoining province(s). For instance, Gwangju, located at the center of [[Jeolla]] region, is heavily associated with the region. Seoul and Incheon are said to make up the [[Seoul National Capital Area|National Capital Area]] along with the densely populated [[Gyeonggi]] that almost completely encompasses them.

One interesting relic of the newer independent cities is that, in some cases, the government administrative buildings (''docheong'') of the provinces they were once a part of are still located within city boundaries, meaning that these provinces have capitals that are not within their borders.

On July 1, 2012, Yeongi-gun, Chungcheongnam-do absorbed parts of Cheonan, Gongju and Cheongju, and became independent from Chungcheongnam-do as Sejong Special Self-governing City under the Special Act on the Installation of Sejong City. Currently, the population of Sejong Special Self-governing City is lower than that of the aforementioned metropolitan cities, but the population is increasing with the construction of a mixed-use administrative city. In 2006, the ruling party floated a proposal to completely eliminate all current province and independent-city borders. This plan would divide the entire republic into fifty or sixty city- or county-level administrations, similar to the system in Japan. The plan was intended to help reduce regional discrimination and animosity by eliminating provincial identity.

===Philippines===
{{main article|Cities of the Philippines#Independent cities}}
Many major cities in the Philippines are independent cities, classified as either &quot;highly urbanized&quot; or &quot;independent component&quot; cities. These cities are administratively and legally not subject to a [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]], and thus do not share their tax revenues with any province. In practise, most cities are often still grouped with provinces that they were [[partition (politics)|partitioned]] from for the sake of convenience and simplicity. The national government and its agencies serve these cities through sub-offices for each [[Regions of the Philippines|region]], to which the cities are indirectly subject. There are 38 such cities, with 16 being located in [[Metro Manila]] (including the [[City of Manila]], the national capital); eight in the rest of [[Luzon]] and its surrounding islands; seven in the [[Visayas]] island group; and seven in [[Mindanao]] and its surrounding islands.
===Vietnam===
Vietnam has five [[Municipalities of Vietnam|municipalities]] that are not part of any of the [[Provinces of Vietnam|Vietnam's provinces]]. This includes [[Hanoi]], the capital of Vietnam; and [[Ho Chi Minh City]] (Saigon), the most populous city of Vietnam.

=== China ===
In [[China]], both [[Beijing]] and [[Tianjin]] are independent of the surrounding province of [[Hebei]], of which they were formerly a part. Similarly, [[Shanghai]] is now independent from [[Jiangsu]] and [[Chongqing]] from [[Sichuan]]. [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macao]] have the status of [[Special administrative regions of China|special administrative regions]], separated from their original province [[Guangdong]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mogens, Hansen 2000. Pg. 19&quot;&gt;Mogens, Hansen. 2000. &quot;Introduction: The Concepts of City-States and City-State Culture.&quot; In ''A Comparative Study of Thirty City-State Cultures,'' Copenhagen: Copenhagen Polis Centre. Pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Korea ===
In both [[South Korea]] and [[North Korea]], [[Special cities of Korea (disambiguation)|special cities]] are independent from their surrounding provinces and city-states under direct governance from the central government. Examples are [[Seoul]], [[Busan]], [[Daegu]], [[Incheon]], [[Gwangju]], [[Daejeon]] and [[Ulsan]] in South Korea and [[Pyongyang]] and [[Rason]] in North Korea. In South Korea, the main criterion for granting secession from the province is a population reaching one million.

=== Thailand ===
In [[Thailand]], the capital [[Bangkok]] operates independently of any province and is considered a special administrative area. It is a [[primate city]] in terms of its large population, having nearly 8% of Thailand's total population.

=== Indonesia ===
In [[Indonesia]], the national capital [[Jakarta]] is within the ''Daerah Khusus Ibukota Jakarta'' (Jakarta Capital Special Region). Jakarta is considered as one of [[Province of Indonesia|Indonesia's provinces]], therefore Jakarta is headed by a [[Governor of Jakarta|governor]] and not a mayor. However, Jakarta is divided into 5 smaller &quot;administration-cities&quot; (''kota administrasi'') and one &quot;administration-regency&quot; (''kabupaten administrasi''). The administration-cities are [[Central Jakarta|Central]], [[North Jakarta|North]], [[East Jakarta|East]], [[West Jakarta|West]], and [[South Jakarta]]. The Kepulauan Seribu ([[Thousand Islands (Indonesia)|Thousand Islands]]) administration-regency is also included in the formal definition of Jakarta. All of these sub-units have their own degree of autonomy. Mayors of the five administration-cities and the regent of Kepulauan Seribu administration-regency are not elected, but directly appointed by the Governor and members of the [[Jakarta Regional People's Representative Council|Provincial Parliament of Jakarta]]. Furthermore, these sub-units do not have local parliament as opposed to other cities or regencies in Indonesia.

=== India ===
[[New Delhi]] and the old city of [[Delhi]] together form the [[Delhi|National Capital Territory of Delhi]].

=== Iraq ===
The capital of [[Iraq]], [[Baghdad]], is contained within a special capital district

=== Japan ===
In [[Japan]], [[Tokyo]], as well as being a city, forms a prefecture, falling into a special category of &quot;metropolitan prefecture&quot; having some of the attributes of a city and some of a prefecture. Within Tokyo, there are smaller units, &quot;wards&quot;, &quot;cities&quot;, &quot;towns&quot;, etc., but some of the responsibilities normally assigned to cities and towns in other Japanese prefectures are handled by the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Government|Tokyo metropolitan government]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan’s Local Government System - Tokyo Metropolitan Government|url=http://www.metro.tokyo.jp/ENGLISH/ABOUT/STRUCTURE/structure01.htm|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TMG and the 23 Special Wards - Tokyo Metropolitan Government|url=http://www.metro.tokyo.jp/ENGLISH/ABOUT/STRUCTURE/structure02.htm|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geography of Tokyo - Tokyo Metropolitan Government|url=http://www.metro.tokyo.jp/ENGLISH/ABOUT/HISTORY/history02.htm|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pakistan ===
The capital of [[Pakistan]], [[Islamabad]], is a [[planned city]] within the [[Islamabad Capital Territory]], which was created in 1960 out of the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] Province. The Territory elects representatives to both houses of the legislature. Before Islamabad was made the capital, [[Karachi]] was located in the [[Federal Capital Territory (Pakistan)|Federal Capital Territory]], which later reverted to the [[Sindh]] Province.

=== UAE ===
In [[United Arab Emirates]], the [[Emirates of the United Arab Emirates|seven emirates]] are themselves city-states, or were historically, in particular [[Emirate of Abu Dhabi|Abu Dhabi]], [[Emirate of Dubai|Dubai]] and [[Emirate of Sharjah|Sharjah]].

==Europe==

===Austria===
The city of [[Vienna]] is a [[States of Austria|federal state]] within the Republic of [[Austria]]. A similar concept is the ''[[statutory city (Austria)|statutory city]]''.

=== Belgium ===
The [[Brussels capital region]], a densely built-up area consisting of 19 communes including the capital city [[Brussels]], became one of [[Belgium]]'s three [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|regions]] after the country was turned into a federation in 1970. (In Belgium there are special circumstances due to the country's language communities.)

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
The [[Brčko District]] is independent of both Entities that constitute Bosnia and Herzegovina (Republika Srpska and Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina). All other cities and municipalities are under the jurisdiction of the Entity (in Republika Srpska) or under the jurisdiction of cantons (Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina). The [[Dayton Peace Agreement]] afforded the special designation as a district, while also creating the [[Office of the High Representative]] that currently oversees the district of Brčko .

===Bulgaria===
The capital city of [[Sofia]] has the status of [[oblast]] (region).

===Croatia===
The capital city of [[Zagreb]] has the status equal to [[županija]] (county), whereas all other cities and municipalities are under a county jurisdiction.

Historically, Croatian cities became independent by being named a &quot;[[royal free city]]&quot;.

===France===
{{See also|Administrative divisions of France}}
The city of Paris is both a ''[[Departments of France|département]]'' and a ''[[Communes of France|commune]]''; it is the only French city with this status. The Council of Paris (''Conseil de Paris'') exercises functions similar to those of a departmental council (''[[Departmental council (France)|conseil départemental]]'') and a city council (''conseil municipal''). However, Paris and the ''départements'' closest to it are part of the [[Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France]] [[région]].

===Germany===
{{See also|Districts of Germany|List of German urban districts}}
In Germany most of the [[States of Germany|federal states]] are subdivided into administrative districts called [[Districts of Germany|Kreis]]e, each of which normally includes several towns or cities. However, a number of the more important cities are not part of a ''Kreis'', but are instead themselves each equivalent in status and functions to a ''Kreis''. Such cities are known as ''Kreisfreie Städte'' (literally, &quot;district-free cities&quot;) – or, in the case of [[Baden-Württemberg]], ''Stadtkreise'' (&quot;urban districts&quot;).

There are currently 110 ''Kreisfreie Städte'' (or equivalents). Of these, the 22 largest are:

*[[Berlin]] [a]
*[[Hamburg]] [a]
*[[Munich]] (München)
*[[Cologne]] (Köln)
*[[Frankfurt]] (Frankfurt am Main)
*[[Stuttgart]]
*[[Düsseldorf]]
*[[Dortmund]]
*[[Essen]]
*[[Leipzig]]
*[[Bremen]] [a]
*[[Dresden]]
*[[Hanover]] (Hannover) [b]
*[[Nuremberg]] (Nürnberg)
*[[Duisburg]]
*[[Bochum]]
*[[Wuppertal]]
*[[Bielefeld]]
*[[Bonn]]
*[[Münster]]
*[[Karlsruhe]]
*[[Mannheim]]

[a]: Berlin, Hamburg, and Bremen are also federal states in their own right.&lt;br&gt;
[b]: Effectively a ''Kreisfreie Stadt'', although the city is ''de jure'' a part of the special-status [[Hanover Region]].

==== ''Stadtstaaten'' of Germany ====
Two cities in [[Germany]], namely [[Berlin]] and [[Hamburg]], are considered city-states ([[German language|German]]: ''Stadtstaaten''). Additionally, the state of [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]] is often called a city-state although it consists of the two cities of [[Bremen]] and [[Bremerhaven]], which are separated by the state of [[Lower Saxony]]. Together with thirteen area states ([[German language|German]]: ''Flächenländer'') they form the sixteen federal [[states of Germany]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mogens, Hansen 2000. Pg. 19&quot; /&gt; Hamburg and Bremen are &quot;[[Free Imperial City|Free]] and [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] Cities&quot;.

Generally, the city-states have no other rights or duties than the other states. Through the financial redistribution system of [[Equalization Payments in Germany]] (German: ''Länderfinanzausgleich''), they do receive more money because of their demographic characteristics. The city-states are most distinctive due to the names of their state organs: their governments are called Senate, the prime ministers 'mayor' (Governing Mayor in [[Berlin]] and First Mayor in Hamburg) or President of the Senate (in Bremen) and also the expressions for their state parliaments differ from the other states.

In the 18th century many German cities were [[free imperial cities]] (German: ''Reichsstädte''), without a principality [[Imperial immediacy|between them and the imperial level]]. After the Napoleonic era, in 1815, four were still city-states: Hamburg, Bremen and Lübeck in Northern Germany, and Frankfurt where the [[Federal Convention (German Confederation)|Federal Convention]] was located. Frankfurt was incorporated by Prussia in 1866, and Lübeck became a part of Prussia during the national socialist regime in 1937 (Greater Hamburg Law). After 1945, Berlin was a divided city, and the Western part became a German quasi-state under (Western) Allied supervision. Since 1990/1991, the reunited Berlin is an ordinary German state among others.

===Hungary===
{{See also|Town with county rights}}{{See also|List of towns in Hungary}}
In Hungary, 23 of the cities are &quot;cities with county rights&quot;. These cities have equal rights with the 19 counties of Hungary.

===Ireland===
{{See also|Local government in the Republic of Ireland|l1=local government in Ireland}}

Cork, Dublin and Galway are governed by independent city councils.

===Norway===
In Norway, Oslo is both a municipality (kommune) and a county (fylke) within itself.

===Poland===
{{See also|Powiat}}
In Poland, many of the biggest cities comprise their own ''city counties'' (formally &quot;cities with county rights&quot;). They are suitably marked on the [[list of counties in Poland]].

=== Romania ===
[[Bucharest]], the capital of Romania, is outside the country's system of [[County|counties]].

===Russian Federation===
In the Russian Federation, Moscow and [[Saint Petersburg]] are both [[Federal subjects of Russia|subjects of the federation]] and cities themselves. Russia also considers the [[Crimean]] city of [[Sevastopol]] to be a [[Federal cities of Russia|federal city of Russia]], but this is not recognized by the majority of states who see the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]] as unlawful.

===Spain===
{{See also|Plazas de soberanía}}
In Spain, there exist two so-called ''autonomous cities'', [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]], which are located on the North African coast surrounded by Morocco and have been under Spanish jurisdiction since the 15th century. Spain is a highly decentralized state organized in [[Autonomous Community|autonomous communities]]. These two cities hold their special status because they are not large enough to be considered regions on their own. Nonetheless, they function as autonomous communities with a high degree of self-administration and law-making powers.

=== Sweden ===
Historically, until 1967, [[Stockholm]] did not belong to any [[Counties of Sweden|county]] of [[Sweden]]. Instead, there was an [[Governor of Stockholm|Governor]] that had the normal responsibilities of the [[County Administrative Boards of Sweden|County Administrative Boards]] and its managers, the governors. There was no [[County councils of Sweden|County Council]] (which is elected by the people and is responsible for example for health care); instead, the Stockholm city handled such tasks.

=== Switzerland ===
One of the [[cantons of Switzerland]], [[Basel-Stadt]], is considered to be a city-state. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bs.ch/dam/jcr:485ef4e3-3642-4d84-aa7d-290908e4aea1/Brochure_Welcome_BaselStadt.pdf Canton of Basel-Stadt] Welcome&lt;/ref&gt;

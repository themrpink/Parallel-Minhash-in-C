===College rivalry===
St John's remains a great rival of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], which is its main competitor in sports and academia. The rivalry can be traced to Henry VIII founding Trinity after having ordered the execution of Saint John Fisher, the man whose efforts had ensured the foundation of St John's. Over the years, numerous anecdotes and myths have arisen, involving students and fellows of both colleges alike. The rivalry is often cited as the reason why the older courts of Trinity have no &quot;J&quot; staircases, despite including other letters in alphabetical order (it should be mentioned that a far more likely reason is the absence of the letter &quot;J&quot; in the Latin alphabet). There are also two small muzzle-loading cannons on Trinity's bowling green pointing in the direction of John's, though this orientation may be coincidental. In similar fashion, the eagle on top of the entrance to St John's New Court is said to have been sculptured so that it shuns even the sight of its neighbouring rival. Generally, however, the colleges maintain a cordial relationship with one other; compatriotism led famously to the splitting of the atomic nucleus in 1932 by [[Ernest Walton]] (Trinity) and [[John Cockcroft]] (St John's).

===Shield and arms===
St John's College and [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] both bear the arms of the Lady Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby, mother of Henry VII. These arms are recorded in the College of Arms as being borne by right, and are described as: ''Quarterly: 1 and 4 azure three fleurs-de-lis gold (France, Modern); 2 and 3 gules three lions passant gardant or (England); all within a border compony silver and azure''. In addition, both foundations use the Beaufort crest, ''an eagle displayed arising out of a coronet of roses and fleurs-de-lis all gold'', but their title to this is more doubtful. When displayed in their full achievement, the arms are flanked by mythical [[yale (mythical creature)|yales]].

===Motto===
The college motto is ''souvent me souvient'', supplied by Lady Margaret Beaufort, and written in Mediaeval French. It is inscribed over gates, lintels and within [[tympanum (architecture)|tympana]] throughout the college, functioning as a triple pun. It means 'often I remember', 'think of me often' and, when spoken (exploiting the homonym ''souvent me sous vient''), 'I often pass beneath it' (referring to the inscriptions). The college shares its motto with [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] and [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford]].

=== Prayer ===
The College Prayer is spoken at the end of chapel services. It alludes to the gospel of John in which it is presumed the author mentions himself anonymously as the disciple Jesus loved:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bible Gateway passage: John 20:2 - New International Version|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+20%3A2&amp;version=NIV|access-date=2020-07-13|website=Bible Gateway|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;Bless, O Lord, the work of this College, which is called by the name of thy beloved disciple; and grant that love of the brethren and all sound learning may ever grow and prosper here, to thy honour and glory, and to the good of thy people, who, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, livest and reignest, one God, world without end. Amen.&quot;

===Grace===
The college grace is customarily said before and after dinner in hall. The reading of grace before dinner (''ante prandium'') is usually the duty of a scholar of the college; grace after dinner (''post prandium'') is said by the president or the senior fellow dining. The graces used in St John's have been in continuous use for some centuries and it is known that the ''ante prandium'' is based upon mediaeval monastic models. The grace is said shortly after the fellows enter the hall, signalled by the sounding of a gong, and accompanied by the ringing of the college's Grace Bell. The ''ante prandium'' is read after the fellows have entered, the ''post prandium'' after they have finished dining:

|Pour forth, we beseech thee, Lord God, thy grace into our minds, that we may use these gifts, given by Margaret our Foundress and other Benefactors, to thy glory, and together with all who have died in the faith of Christ rise again to life in heaven, through Jesus Christ our Lord. May God, of his infinite mercy, grant his Church unity and peace, preserve our most august queen, Queen Elizabeth, and grant peace to the whole Realm and to all Christians.

==Student life==
The buildings of St John's College include the Chapel, the Hall, the old library, a more contemporary &quot;new&quot; library, a bar, and common rooms for fellows, graduates and undergraduates. There are also extensive gardens, lawns, a neighbouring sportsground, College School and boat-house. On-site accommodation is provided for all undergraduate and most graduate students. This is generally spacious, and many undergraduate rooms comprise 'sets' of living and sleeping rooms, where two students share a suite of two bedrooms, a kitchen and a bathroom. Members of the college can choose to dine either in the Hall, where silver service three-course meals are served six evenings per week, or in the buttery, where food can be purchased from a cafeteria-style buffet. College catering is organised by Bill Brogan, overseer of the intercollegiate Stewards' Cup.

The college maintains an extensive library, which supplements the university libraries. Most undergraduate supervisions are carried out in the college, though for some specialist subjects undergraduates may be sent to tutors in other colleges.

The college has two official combination rooms for junior members, which represent the interests of students in college and are responsible for social aspects of college life. Undergraduates are members of the Junior Combination Room (JCR). Graduate students have membership to the JCR, but also belong to the [[Samuel Butler Room Society|Samuel Butler Room]], which is the [[Middle Combination Room]] (MCR) of St John's College.

The fleet of [[punt (boat)|punts]] is kept in a purpose-built punt pool behind the Cripps Building. Punt boats are available for use by all members of the college as well as alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=St John's College Punt Society |url=https://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/punt-society |accessdate=18 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

St John's tends to be ranked near the middle of the [[Tompkins Table]] of undergraduate degree results, with an average position of 12.8 since 1997.

===Samuel Butler Room Society===
[[File:Sbr outside 2010.JPG|thumb|right| Entrance to the SBR, I1 First Court]]
The Samuel Butler Room Society (SBR) is the Middle Combination Room (MCR) of St John's College. The Society traces its foundation to 1960, when graduate student members submitted an application to College Council for official separation from the [[Junior Combination Room]] (JCR). The name of the Society refers to the physical rooms which are used by members of the Society. The rooms were named after the noted Johnian author and polymath [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]. The membership of the Society comprises all members of the College who are registered graduate students of the College and affiliated students of the College.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Constitution of St John's College Samuel Butler Room Society&quot;, Section 3(i), in Appendix II of the Standing Orders of College, St John's College, Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
[[File:Cambridge boathouses - St John's (Lady Margaret).jpg|thumb|right|[[Lady Margaret Boat Club]]]]
[[File:Path across the playing field - geograph.org.uk - 1254786.jpg|thumb|right|St John's Playing Fields]]

The college has a sporting history, enjoying success in most of the major sports on offer in Cambridge. The college has a cardio gym and a weights gym on site, and has pristine pitches right behind college.

The Red Boys, St John's College Rugby Club, won the Division One League title for nine years in a row, before finally losing to Jesus in 2010–11, and the [[cuppers]] trophy for 6 years in a row from 2006 to 2011, making it one of the most successful collegiate sports teams in Cambridge's history. The Redboys occupy eighteen out of the twenty-four plates on the current Division One League Shield, and thirteen out of the seventeen names on the Cuppers trophy. Since 2014, the club has taken home two Cuppers trophies, three Division One League Shields, and the inaugural Sevens Shield in 2016/17. In the 2016/17 season, the Redboys went undefeated.

St John's regularly produces a strong contingent of university players, but also ensures new players develop and get game time swiftly. The rugby club has produced several notable alumni including former RFU executive [[Francis Baron]], former Newcastle, England and Lions fly-half and former RFU Director of Elite Rugby [[Rob Andrew]], and Battlestar Galactica actor [[Jamie Bamber]].

The college rowing club, the [[Lady Margaret Boat Club]] (LMBC), is the oldest in the university, and was founded in 1825. Despite many gruesome rumours concerning the name of the club, it was merely the most successful of the many boat clubs established in the college in the 19th century. In a similar fashion the traditional rival of the LMBC, the Boat Club of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], is known as '[[First and Third]]' in a reference to its formation from two original clubs.

===Scholarships and prizes===
Every year the college awards scholarships to a handful of graduate students under the Benefactors' and Scholarships Scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/admissions/graduate_admissions/finances/scholarships/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927004437/http://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/admissions/graduate_admissions/finances/scholarships/ |date=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most generous of all the early benefactors of St John's College was [[Roger Lupton|Dr Roger Lupton]] (died 1540), [[Provost (education)|Provost]] of [[Eton College|Eton]] and chaplain to [[Henry VIII]]. Lupton had amassed immense wealth through a lifetime of royal service and ecclesiastical [[Pluralities|pluralism]] and his scholarships exist today as the Lupton and Hebblethwaite Exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cambridge Statutes|first1=University of|title=Statutes for the College of St John the Evangelist in the University of Cambridge-as at October 2006|url=https://camtools.cam.ac.uk/access/content/group/a5f9a101-adbc-44d9-000f-380e839657a6/Documentation/statutes-06.pdf|publisher=St John's College, 2006|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholarships include the Craik Scholarship, the J.C. Hall Scholarship, the Luisa Aldobrandini Studentship Competition, the Paskin Scholarship and the Pelling Scholarship. Competition for these scholarships is very fierce as students from any country reading for any graduate degree—not only members of the college—can apply.
[[File:cmglee_Cambridge_St_Johns_May_Ball_Second_Court.jpg|thumb|Second Court during the 2019 May Ball]]

There is also the famous [[Adams Prize]] in mathematics, named after the mathematician (and alumnus of St John's) [[John Couch Adams]] for his discovery of Neptune – it is an annual competition and can be awarded to any mathematician resident in the UK, with an age limit of under 40. The college is also associated with the [[Dr Manmohan Singh Scholarship]], first awarded in 2008.

Students at the college wishing to practice law can apply for a McMahon Law Studentship to cover the expense of further study or obtaining professional qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mc Mahon Law Studentships |url=https://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/mcmahon-law-studentships-0 |website=St John's College Website |accessdate=18 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===May Ball===
St John's hosts a large and typically spectacular [[May Ball]], which is traditionally held on the Tuesday of [[May Week]]. In recent years, tickets have only been available to Johnians and their guests. Highlights include an extravagant fireworks display and a variety of musical acts which in recent years have included [[Rudimental]], [[Gorgon City]] and [[Katy B]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=St John's College May Ball 2015 |url=https://hawthorn.biz/st-john%E2%80%99s-may-ball-2015 |website=Hawthorn |accessdate=18 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===St John's and the abolition of the British slave trade===
[[File:The Anti-Slavery Society Convention, 1840 by Benjamin Robert Haydon.jpg|thumb|St John's alumnus [[Thomas Clarkson]] addresses delegates at the 1840 convention of the [[British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society]]]]

Several of St John's graduates were involved in the efforts to abolish the British Slave Trade that culminated in the [[Slave Trade Act 1807|Act of 1807]]. In particular, [[Thomas Clarkson]], [[William Wilberforce]], [[Thomas Gisborne]] and [[Thomas Babington]] were active in the [[Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] and other abolitionist efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/chapel_and_choir/bicentenary_2007/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927004718/http://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/chapel_and_choir/bicentenary_2007/ |date=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the commemoration of the bicentenary of the 1807 Act, and as a representative of one of the [[Ivy League]] universities offering American historical perspective on the [[Triangular Trade]], President [[Ruth Simmons|Ruth J. Simmons]] of [[Brown University]] (herself a descendant of American slaves) gave a public lecture at St John's College entitled &quot;Hidden in Plain Sight: Slavery and Justice in Rhode Island&quot; on 16 February 2007. St John's College hosted some of the events relating to the commemoration,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/press/dpp/2007021501] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606210533/http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/press/dpp/2007021501 |date=6 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including an academic conference and a Gospel Mass in the College Chapel with the London Adventist Chorale.

The '''Pulitzer Prize for Drama''' is one of the seven American [[Pulitzer Prizes]] that are annually awarded for Letters, [[Drama]], and [[Music]]. It is one of the original Pulitzers, for the program was inaugurated in 1917 with seven prizes, four of which were awarded that year.&lt;ref name=prize1917&gt;[http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1917 &quot;1917 Winners&quot;]. The Pulitzer Prizes. Retrieved 2013-12-20.&lt;/ref&gt; (No Drama prize was given, however, so that one was inaugurated in 1918, in a sense.)&lt;ref name=prize/&gt; It recognizes a theatrical work staged in the U.S. during the preceding calendar year.&lt;!--any restriction on personnel such as US playwright or director?--&gt;

Until 2007, eligibility for the Drama Prize ran from March 1 to March 2 to reflect the Broadway &quot;season&quot; rather than the calendar year that governed most other Pulitzer Prizes. 

The drama jury, which consists of one academic and four critics, attends plays in [[New York City|New York]] and in regional theaters. The Pulitzer board can overrule the jury's choice; in [[1986 in literature#Awards|1986]], the board's opposition to the jury's choice of ''[[The Civil Wars: A Tree Is Best Measured When It Is Down|the CIVIL warS]]'' resulted in no award being given.&lt;ref&gt;[http://broadwayscene.com/tag/pulitzer-prize/ Pulitzer Prize|Broadway Scene]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 [[Joseph Pulitzer, Jr.]] pressured the prize jury into presenting the Prize to ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'', which the jury considered the weakest of the five shortlisted nominees (&quot;amateurishly constructed... from the stylistic points of view annoyingly pretentious&quot;), instead of [[Clifford Odets]]' ''[[The Flowering Peach]]'' (their preferred choice) or [[The Bad Seed (play)|''The Bad Seed'']], their second choice.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Heinz-Dietrich &amp; Erika J. Fischer. ''The Pulitzer Prize Archive: A History and Anthology of Award-Winning Materials in Journalism, Letters, and Arts'' München: K.G. Saur, 2008. {{ISBN|3-598-30170-7}} {{ISBN|9783598301704}} p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Albee]]'s  ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' was selected for the 1963 Pulitzer Prize for Drama by that award's committee.  However, the committee's selection was overruled by the award's advisory board, the trustees of [[Columbia University]], because of the play's then-controversial use of [[profanity]] and sexual themes.  Had Albee been awarded, he would be tied with [[Eugene O'Neill]] for the most Pulitzer Prizes for Drama (four).

==Awards and nominations==
In its first 98 years to 2013, the Drama Pulitzer was awarded 82 times; none were given in 15 years and it was never split.

The most recipients of the prize in one year was five, when [[Michael Bennett (theater)|Michael Bennett]], [[James Kirkwood, Jr.]], [[Nicholas Dante]], [[Marvin Hamlisch]], and [[Edward Kleban]] shared the [[1976 Pulitzer Prize|1976 prize]] for the musical ''[[A Chorus Line]]''.&lt;ref name=prize/&gt;

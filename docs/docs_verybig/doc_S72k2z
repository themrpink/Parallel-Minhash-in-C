=== Gender ambiguity and sexuality ===

In her ''Autobiography'' (1681) Christina is flirting with her [[androgynous]] personality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zimmermann&quot;/&gt; The question of her sexuality has been debated, even as a number of modern biographers generally consider her to have been a [[lesbian]], and her relationships with women were noted during her lifetime;&lt;ref name=&quot;crompton&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TfBYd9xVaXcC&amp;pg=PA357 |first=Louis |last=Crompton |title=Homosexuality and Civilization |year=2009 |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=357–60|isbn=9780674030060 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christina seems to have written passionate letters to [[Ebba Sparre]], and Guilliet suggested a relationship between Christina and [[Gabrielle de Rochechouart de Mortemart]], Rachel, a niece of Diego Teixeira,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JNZ9B1JWaT4C&amp;lpg=PT52|title=Christine de Suède|first=Bernard|last=Quilliet|date=4 June 2003|publisher=Fayard|access-date=10 July 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9782213649474}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the singer Angelina Giorgino.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; Some historians assert she maintained [[heterosexual]],&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt; non-sexual,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TO1a4F_EDBsC&amp;pg=PT70|title=Alle Wege führen nach Rom: Die ewige Stadt und ihre Besucher|first=Roberto|last=Zapperi|date=12 February 2013|publisher=C.H.Beck|access-date=10 July 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9783406644528}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[lesbian]],&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Waters (1994) ''A Girton Girl on a Throne: Queen Christina and Versions of Lesbianism, 1906-1933''

Bargrave recounted that Christina's relationship with Azzolino was both &quot;familiar&quot; ([[Intimate relationship#Intimacy|intimate]]) and &quot;amorous&quot; and that Azzolino had been sent (by the Pope) to Romania as punishment for maintaining it.&lt;ref name=bargrave/&gt; Buckley, on the other hand, believed there was &quot;in Christina a curious squeamishness with regard to sex&quot; and that &quot;a sexual relationship between herself and Azzolino, or any other man, seems unlikely&quot;.&lt;ref name=Buckley/&gt; Based on historical accounts of Christina's physicality, some scholars believe that she may have been an [[intersex]] individual.&lt;ref name=Buckley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Queen Christina of Sweden: documents and studies |publisher=Nationalmuseum |year=1966 |first=Magnus von|last=Platen |page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;

In 1965 these conflicting accounts led to an investigation of Christina's remains. [[Physical anthropologist]] Carl-Herman Hjortsjö, who undertook the investigation, explained: &quot;Our imperfect knowledge concerning the effect of intersex on the skeletal formation [...] makes it impossible to decide which positive skeletal findings should be demanded upon which to base the diagnosis&quot; of an [[intersex]] condition. Nevertheless, Hjortsjö speculated that Christina had reasonably typical female genitalia because it is recorded by her physicians Bourdelot and Macchiati that she menstruated.&lt;ref&gt;Hjortsjö, Carl-Herman (1966/7) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ibs_QwAACAAJ&amp;dq &quot;Queen Christina of Sweden: A Medical/Anthropological Investigation of Her Remains in Rome&quot;] pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; Hjortsjö's [[osteology|osteological]] analysis of Christina's [[skeleton]] led him to state that they were of a &quot;typically female&quot; structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;González 2006 page 211&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Cuba And the Tempest: Literature &amp; Cinema in the Time of Diaspora |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A8YfMoPifnMC&amp;lpg=PP1 |page=211 |last=González |first=Eduardo |publisher=The University of North Carolina Press |year=2006 |access-date=3 August 2012|isbn = 9780807856833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the symptoms could be due to [[polycystic ovary syndrome]], a complex multi-[[endocrine disorder]] including [[hirsutism]] (male pattern/type hair growth) due to increased androgen hormone levels, and abdominal obesity due to the hormone insulin receptor defects. Buckley suggested that her low comprehension of the need for most social norms,  little desire to act, dress, or do other social norms and her preference to wear, act, and do only that which she deemed logically practical, point to her having a [[pervasive developmental disorder]], such as [[Asperger syndrome]].&lt;ref name=Buckley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/23839975|title=Garbo, Christina and Asperger|first=Federico Del|last=Monte|access-date=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
The complex character of Christina has inspired numerous plays, books, and operatic works:
* [[Jacopo Foroni]]'s 1849 opera ''[[Cristina, regina di Svezia]]'' is based on the events surrounding her abdication. Other operas based on her life, include [[Alessandro Nini]]'s ''Cristina di Svezia'' (1840), [[Giuseppe Lillo]]'s ''Cristina di Svezia'' (1841), and [[Sigismond Thalberg]]'s ''Cristina di Svezia'' (1855)
* [[August Strindberg]]'s published ''[[Kristina (play)|Kristina]]'' (1901) &lt;!--depicts her as a protean, impulsive creature. --&gt;
* [[Zacharias Topelius]]  wrote a historical allegory ''Stjärnornas Kungabarn'' (1899–1900) &lt;!--and  portrays her, like her father, as having a mercurial temperament, quick to anger, quicker to forgive.--&gt;
* Christina's life was famously fictionalised in the classic feature film ''[[Queen Christina (film)|Queen Christina]]'' (1933).  This film, starring [[Greta Garbo]], depicted a heroine whose life diverged considerably from that of the real Christina. &lt;!--Nonetheless, for some Christina became a symbolic icon of [[cross-dressing]], [[transsexuality]] and possible bisexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Waters (1994) ''A Girton Girl on a Throne: Queen Christina and Versions of Lesbianism, 1906-1933''
In: Feminist Review. No. 46, Sexualities: Challenge &amp; Change (Spring, 1994), pp. 41–60 [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1395418?uid=3738736&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=56119066103]&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;
* In the Italian film ''[[Love and Poison (film)|Love and Poison]]'' (1950/52) Christina is played by actress [[Lois Maxwell]].
* [[Kaari Utrio]] published ''Kartanonherra ja kaunis Kristin'' (1969).
* In ''[[The Abdication]]'' (1974), starring [[Liv Ullmann]], Christina arrives in the Vatican and falls in love with cardinal Azzelino. The [[screenplay|script]] was based on a play by Ruth Wolff.
* Herta J. Enevoldsen wrote two novels in Danish on her life, ''Heltekongens Datter'' (1975) and ''En Dronning Værdig'' (1976).
* [[Laura Ruohonen]] wrote  &quot;Queen C&quot; (2003), which presents a woman centuries ahead of her time who lives by her own rules.
* In [[Eric Flint]] 's alternative history [[1632 series]], part of his [[Assiti Shards]] universe, she is a major character. 
* Comedian [[Jade Esteban Estrada]] portrayed her (2004) in the solo musical ''ICONS: The Lesbian and Gay History of the World'' Vol. 2.
*[[Michel Marc Bouchard]]'s play ''Christina, The Girl King'', is a biographical depiction of Queen Christina's short rule premiered in 2012.
* [[Mika Kaurismäki]]'s film, ''[[The Girl King]]'', based on the play, premièred December 11, 2015.
* She is featured as the leader of the Swedish civilization in the video game expansion pack [[Civilization VI: Gathering Storm]], although her name is spelt Kristina. Her unique ability grants her buildings and wonders with Great Works slots (Must be 3 slots for buildings and 2 slots for wonders) automatic theming (granting Tourism and Culture bonuses) once they are filled with Great Works without regard to normal theming rules. In addition, she has a unique Government Plaza building that grants her multiple Great Works slots and extra points towards Great People that can create said Great Works.

{{nihongo foot|'''''Kuru Kuru Kururin'''''|くるくるくるりん|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[puzzle video game]] developed by [[Eighting]] and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Game Boy Advance]] [[video game console|handheld video game console]]. It was released in Japan on March 21, 2001 and in Europe and Australia on June 22, 2001 as a launch title. North America saw the title for the first time on February 11, 2016 via the Wii U's Virtual Console service. ''Kuru Kuru Kururin'' is the first title in the ''Kururin'' series and was followed by two Japan-only sequels, ''[[Kururin Paradise]]'' and ''[[Kururin Squash!]]''

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Kurukurukururin screenshot.PNG|left|thumb|Screenshot of ''Kuru Kuru Kururin''.]]
The player controls a slowly spinning stick called the Helirin, or the Helicopter in the European localization, and must maneuver it through a series of [[maze]]s without touching the walls. The player controls the direction and speed of movement (there are 3 levels of speed), but the task is made difficult as the stick rotates continuously. The Helirin can move faster by holding down any of the two face buttons, and even faster by holding down both. There are bonuses to collect, record times to beat, and a gold star for completing the level without any accidents. The game also features multiplayer support, which enables four players to participate in the action using a single cartridge.

''Kuru Kuru Kururin'' was released in Japan and Europe, but not (until early 2016) in North America. However, as the Game Boy Advance has no regional lockout, a North American Game Boy Advance can be used to play either the Japanese or European version of the game. The menus in the Japanese version are simple enough that they are easily navigable by a player who knows no Japanese.

The game starts with simple training levels, in which players are told how to play and how to get around the first corners. After that, there are three levels in each stage, which get progressively harder and longer. The obstacles and the look of the levels (ice, cave, machine, etc.) vary between stages. Beginners can play the levels on Easy mode, where the stick is only half of its usual size.

There is a mode called Challenge mode, which is a collection of smaller levels, usually involving only one or two corners or objects to dodge.

==Plot==
The story begins when Kururin's brothers and sisters go missing, and it is up to him to find them. Kururin is initially unsure that he is up to the task because he has never left his home world before. Being the adventurous and helpful fellow he is, Kururin agrees to rescue his lost family. Teacher Hare trains Kururin in the art of controlling the Helirin, a stick-shaped helicopter that has a slow-spinning propeller. Piloting the Helirin through the different worlds will be a difficult task, but using Teacher Hare's valuable lessons, Kururin bravely sets out on his adventure to rescue his lost family.

==Development==
''Kuru Kuru Kururin'' was developed by the Japanese company [[Eighting]] and first announced at the [[Nintendo Space World]] 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/083/083313p1.html|title=More Game Boy Advance Shots|website=[[IGN]]|date=2000-08-09|accessdate=2010-03-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613191724/http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/083/083313p1.html|archive-date=2011-06-13|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reviewer lauded the game's learning curve and stated that there would be no other puzzle game on the Game Boy Advance at the time that can &quot;rival ''Kuru Kuru Kururin'' for its sheer addictiveness and fun-value.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_kurukuru_gba|title=KuruKuru Kururin Review|author=Martin Taylor|website=[[Eurogamer]]|date=2001-07-07|accessdate=2010-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nintendo World Report, then known as Planet GameCube, gave ''Kuru Kuru Kururin'' the same score as Eurogamer and declared that it is &quot;simple enough that anyone can pick this game up and play.&quot; The reviewer praised the game's multiplayer mode, which he described as &quot;an absolute blast,&quot; as well as its lasting appeal, but also commented that the &quot;cutesy&quot; characters and music would be a turn-off for &quot;a lot of people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/reviewArt.cfm?artid=3795|title=GBA Review: Kuru Kuru Kururin|author=Billy Berghammer|publisher=Nintendo World Report|date=2001-08-08|accessdate=2010-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeff Gerstmann]] of [[GameSpot]] rated ''Kuru Kuru Kururin'' 7.1 out of 10 and described its graphics as &quot;simple but effective.&quot; He stated that the game is &quot;excellent at filling up small periods of free time with its short, level-based nature.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gba/puzzle/kurukurukururin/review.html|title=Kuru Kuru Kururin Review for Game Boy Advance|author=Jeff Gerstmann|website=[[GameSpot]]|date=2001-04-23|accessdate=2010-03-09|authorlink=Jeff Gerstmann}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' was less impressed by the game, rating it 5 out of 10. The reviewer declared the game to be &quot;extremely frustrating&quot; and stated that it lacks &quot;the perfect simplicity&quot; of other puzzle games such as ''[[Mr. Driller]]'' and ''[[Tetris]]''. Nonetheless, he also commented that the novel gameplay of ''Kuru Kuru Kururin'' &quot;will find many fans&quot; and that the multiplayer mode is &quot;unexpectedly brilliant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=8603|title=Kuru Kuru Kururin Review|author=Stephen Fulljames|magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]]|date=2001-08-15|accessdate=2010-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
The first sequel entitled ''[[Kururin Paradise]]'' came out in 2002 for the Game Boy Advance. It was released in Japan only, even though ''Kururin Paradise'' was previously showcased at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] [[History of E3#2002|2002]], the first time a ''Kururin'' game had been announced for the American market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/360/360753p1.html|title=E3 2002: Hands-on: Kururin Paradise|website=[[IGN]]|date=2002-05-24|accessdate=2010-03-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613191803/http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/360/360753p1.html|archive-date=2011-06-13|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another sequel was also released only in Japan for the [[Nintendo GameCube]] in 2004, entitled ''[[Kururin Squash!]]'', which became the only title of the series to feature [[3D computer graphics]], as well as to appear on a home console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/557/557111p1.html|title=Kururin Squash Playtest|author=Anoop Gantayat|website=[[IGN]]|date=2004-10-14|accessdate=2010-03-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403025803/http://cube.ign.com/articles/557/557111p1.html|archive-date=2012-04-03|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several references to the ''Kururin'' series are made in the [[Super Smash Bros. (series)|''Super Smash Bros.'' series]]. The Helirin makes a cameo appearance as a trophy in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', but is incorrectly referred to as &quot;Heririn&quot; in the American version. The Helirin later appears in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' as an Assist Trophy. Unlike most Assist Trophies, it doesn't attack, but it becomes part of the stage, and can be used as a platform or a wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/wii/en_us/items/assist/assist15.html|title=Assist Trophies|author=Masahiro Sakurai|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=2008-02-06|accessdate=2010-03-08|authorlink=Masahiro Sakurai}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other things in the Kururin series appear as Trophies and Stickers in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/wii/en_us/gamemode/various/various36_list.html|title=Trophy List|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=2008-04-08|accessdate=2010-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/wii/en_us/gamemode/various/various37_list.html|title=Sticker List|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=2008-04-09|accessdate=2010-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

24 - no one does this.  Look at [[ontology]], the worst example I know.  People just say &quot;this is that&quot; and then proceed... some of the first paragraphs bother to set up context, but not many.  So I don't like this as a rule, although I do it wherever I can.

==Establish Context==
''Originally at [[Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style--Archive1]]''

Some things that might need to be in here:
* Create context: many articles assume that the reader already knows the field in which the term is used; this is especially true for articles regarding computer science and mathematics. These should included some reference in their introduction sentence to the field, such as &quot;In [[mathematics]] ...&quot; or &quot;In the field of [[computer science]], ...&quot;
* Links can be used to explain a term, but not for acronyms or abbreviations the reader cannot be expected to know. So &quot;[[Central Processing Unit]] (CPU)&quot; on first occurrence.
[[User:Jheijmans|Jeronimo]]

I agree with both.
Especially the first, which I broke too often in my youth.
On that subject, note that we can say something more specific than &quot;In [[mathematics]]&quot; (if the subject is truly thus restricted), such as &quot;In [[topology]]&quot;.
We can even say &quot;In [[homotopy theory]]&quot;, even though most people have no idea what the heck homotopy theory is, because they can click on the link to find out.
But we still need &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; context.
&amp;mdash; [[User:Toby Bartels|Toby]] 13:04 Sep 24, 2002 (UTC)

: In that case, I'd prefer something along the lines of &quot;In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[topology]],...&quot;. In that case, both mathematicians (but not topologists) and complete layman can get an idea what the topic is about.

::Well, I do have a lot of articles that say &quot;In [[topology]] and related branches of [[mathematics]]&quot;, since the basic ideas of topology are widely used in other branches. But how does it work for homotopy theory? &quot;In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[topology]]'s subdiscipline of [[homotopy theory]]&quot;? We could say &quot;In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[homotopy theory]]&quot;, since mathematicians know that homotopy theory is topology and nonmathematicians only ''want'' to know that it's math.

::OTOH, consider &quot;In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] theory of [[building (mathematics)|building]]s&quot;. Had I read that last year, I'd have had no ideas what buildings are in math; they're not so well known. I ''would'' have understood &quot;In the [[group theory|group theoretic]] theory of [[building (mathematics)|building]]s&quot;, but then the nonmathematicians would be lost. So we would only have complete context given for everybody by saying the loquacious &quot;In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] theory of [[building (mathematics)|building]]s, used in [[group theory]]&quot;.

::Anyway, the point of this note is to say that giving complete context will sometimes be quite wordy. But I do agree that we should give as much context as concise sentence structure allows. So basically I agree with you. &amp;mdash; [[User:Toby Bartels|Toby]] 13:40 Sep 24, 2002 (UTC)

: BTW, I thought topology had something to do with geography? [[User:Jheijmans|Jeronimo]]

::I thought that this was the same as [[topography]], but the OED disagrees. Now who wants to go through 93 links to [[Topology]] and disambiguate them? &amp;mdash; [[User:Toby Bartels|Toby]] 13:40 Sep 24, 2002 (UTC)

:::At first sight, they're all right (just did a checking of the page titles, and looked at those I was least sure of) [[User:Andre Engels|Andre Engels]] 13:46 Sep 24, 2002 (UTC)

:: Just stepping in to point the way to the policy page [[Wikipedia:Establish context]] -- maybe add all these ideas there &amp; move this talk to its talk page? -- [[User:Tarquin|Tarquin]]

: I'd say do it the other way round. This page collects all kind of style guidelines, so we should include it here. That way it is easier to get an overview for new - and old (I still find new Wikipedia guideline pages) - users. [[User:Jheijmans|Jeronimo]]

:: My idea was that this page will need splitting at some point anyway. If guidelines on this page already have pages elsewhere, we might as well use the other pages &amp; link to it from here. -- [[User:Tarquin|Tarquin]]

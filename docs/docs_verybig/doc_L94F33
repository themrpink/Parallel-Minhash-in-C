In [[sociology]], '''anomie''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|n|ə|ˌ|m|i}}) is a [[Society|societal]] condition defined by an uprooting or breakdown of any [[Morality|moral]] values, standards, or guidance for individuals to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gerber |first= John J.

Alienation in a person that can progress into a dysfunctional inability to integrate within normative situations of their social world like to find a job, find success in relationships, etc.

The term, commonly understood to mean ''normlessness'', is believed to have been popularized by French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] in his influential book [[Suicide (Durkheim book)|''Suicide'']] (1897). However, Durkheim first introduced the concept of anomie in his 1893 work ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]''. Durkheim never used the term ''normlessness'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Meštrović | first1 = Stjepan Gabriel | author-link1 = Stjepan Gabriel Meštrović | year = 1988 | title = Emile Durkheim and the Reformation of Sociology | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lqGUxDs3K_UC | series = G - Reference, Information and Interdisciplinary Subjects Series | location = Lanham, Maryland | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield | publication-date = 1993 | page = 60 | isbn = 9780847678679 | access-date = 27 October 2019 | quote = The contemporary understanding of Durkheim's concept of ''anomie'' as 'normlesness' was begun by Parsons (1937) and Merton (1957).

For Durkheim, anomie arises more generally from a mismatch between personal or group standards and wider social standards; or from the lack of a [[Social ethics|social ethic]], which produces moral deregulation and an absence of legitimate [[Motivation|aspiration]]s. This is a [[Nature versus nurture|nurtured]] condition:
{{quote |Most sociologists associate the term with Durkheim, who used the concept to speak of the ways in which an individual's actions are matched, or integrated, with a system of social norms and practices…anomie is a mismatch, not simply the absence of norms.

== History ==
In 1893, Durkheim introduced the concept of ''anomie'' to describe the mismatch of collective [[guild]] labour to evolving societal needs when the guild was [[homogeneous]] in its constituency. He equated homogeneous (redundant) skills to ''[[mechanical solidarity]]'' whose inertia hindered adaptation. He contrasted this with the [[Self-regulation theory|self-regulating behaviour]] of a [[division of labour]] based on differences in constituency, equated to ''[[organic solidarity]]'', whose lack of inertia made it sensitive to needed changes.

Durkheim observed that the conflict between the evolved organic division of labour and the homogeneous mechanical type was such that one could not exist in the presence of the other.&lt;ref name=&quot;quot1&quot;&gt;[[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim, Émile]]. [1893] 1964. ''The Division of Labor in Society''. [[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|182-3}} When solidarity is organic, anomie is impossible, as sensitivity to mutual needs promotes evolution in the division of labour:&lt;ref name=&quot;quot1&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|368-9}}&lt;blockquote&gt;Producers, being near consumers, can easily reckon the extent of the needs to be satisfied. [[Social equilibrium|Equilibrium]] is established without any trouble and production regulates itself. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Durkheim contrasted the condition of anomie as being the result of a malfunction of organic solidarity after the transition to mechanical solidarity:&lt;ref name=&quot;quot1&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|368-9}}

{{quote|But on the contrary, if some opaque environment is interposed…relations [are] rare, are not repeated enough…are too intermittent. Contact is no longer sufficient. The producer can no longer embrace the market at a glance, nor even in thought. He can no longer see its limits, since it is, so to speak limitless. Accordingly, production becomes unbridled and unregulated.|author=|title=|source=}}

Durkheim's use of ''anomie'' was in regards to the phenomenon of [[Industrialisation|industrialization]]—mass-[[Regimen|regimentation]] that could not adapt due to its own inertia. More specifically, its resistance to change causes disruptive cycles of [[collective behavior]] (e.g. economics) due to the necessity of a prolonged buildup of sufficient force or momentum to overcome the inertia.

Later in 1897, in his studies of suicide, Durkheim associated ''anomie'' to the influence of a lack of [[Social norm|norms]] or norms that were too rigid. However, such normlessness or norm-rigidity was a ''symptom'' of anomie, caused by the lack of differential adaptation that would enable norms to evolve naturally due to [[Self-regulation theory|self-regulation]], either to develop norms where none existed or to change norms that had become rigid and obsolete.

In 1938, [[Robert K. Merton]] linked ''anomie'' with [[Robert K. Merton#Theory of deviance|''deviance'']], arguing that the discontinuity between [[culture]] and [[Social structure|structure]] have the dysfunctional consequence of leading to deviance within society. He described 5 types of deviance in terms of the acceptance or rejection of [[Goal|social goals]] and the [[Institutionalisation|institutionalized]] means of achieving them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merton|first=Robert K.|author-link=Robert K. Merton|date=1938|title=Social Structure and Anomie|url=|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=3|issue=5|pages=672–82|doi=10.2307/2084686|jstor=2084686}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
{{See also|Antinomianism}}
The term ''anomie—''&quot;a [[reborrowing]] with French spelling of ''anomy''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|anomie}}&lt;/ref&gt;—comes from {{Lang-grc-gre|anomía|italic=yes}} ({{Lang-grc|ἀνομία|label=none|lit=lawlessness}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|anomy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry George Liddel|Liddell, Henry George]], and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]]. 1940. &quot;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=a)nomi/a ἀνομία].&quot; ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]'', edited by [[Henry Stuart Jones|H. S. Jones]] and R. McKenzie. [[Perseus Project]].&lt;/ref&gt; namely the [[privative alpha]] [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] (''a-'', 'without'), and ''nomos'' ({{Lang-grc|νόμος|label=none|lit=law}}). The Greeks distinguished between ''nomos'', and ''arché'' ({{Lang-grc|ἀρχή|label=none|lit=starting rule, axiom, principle}}). For example, a [[monarch]] is a single ruler but he may still be subject to, and not exempt from, the prevailing laws, i.e. ''nomos''. In the original [[city state]] [[democracy]], the [[majority rule]] was an aspect of ''arché'' because it was a rule-based, [[customary]] system, which may or may not make laws, i.e. ''nomos''. Thus, the original meaning of ''anomie'' defined anything or anyone against or outside the law, or a condition where the current laws were not applied resulting in a state of illegitimacy or lawlessness.

The contemporary English understanding of the word ''anomie'' can accept greater flexibility in the word &quot;[[norm (sociology)|norm]]&quot;, and some have used the idea of normlessness to reflect a similar situation to the idea of [[Anarchism|anarchy]]. However, as used by [[Émile Durkheim]] and later theorists, ''anomie'' is a reaction against or a retreat from the regulatory [[social control]]s of [[society]], and is a completely separate concept from anarchy, which consists of the absence of the roles of rulers and submitted.

== Social disorder ==

Nineteenth-century [[France|French]] pioneer [[sociologist]] [[Émile Durkheim]] borrowed the term ''anomie'' from French philosopher [[Jean-Marie Guyau]]. Durkheim used it in his influential book ''[[Suicide (Durkheim book)|Suicide]]'' (1897) in order to outline the social (and not individual) causes of [[suicide]], characterized by a rapid change of the standards or values of societies (often erroneously referred to as ''normlessness''), and an associated feeling of [[Social alienation|alienation]] and purposelessness. He believed that ''anomie'' is common when the surrounding society has undergone significant changes in its economic fortunes, whether for better or for worse and, more generally, when there is a significant discrepancy between the ideological theories and values commonly professed and what was actually achievable in everyday life. This was contrary to previous theories on suicide which generally maintained that suicide was precipitated by negative events in a person's life and their subsequent [[clinical depression|depression]].

In Durkheim's view, traditional [[religion]]s often provided the basis for the shared values which the anomic individual lacks. Furthermore, he argued that the [[division of labor]] that had been prevalent in economic life since the [[Industrial Revolution]] led individuals to pursue [[egotism|egoistic]] ends rather than seeking the good of a larger community. [[Robert King Merton]] also adopted the idea of anomie to develop [[Strain theory (sociology)|strain theory]], defining it as the discrepancy between common social goals and the legitimate means to attain those goals. In other words, an individual suffering from anomie would strive to attain the common goals of a specific society yet would not be able to reach these goals legitimately because of the [[structuralism|structural]] limitations in society. As a result, the individual would exhibit [[deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]]. [[Friedrich Hayek]] notably uses the word ''anomie'' with this meaning.

According to one academic survey, [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] testing confirmed a link between anomie and [[academic dishonesty]] among university students, suggesting that universities needed to foster codes of ethics among students in order to curb it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/09513540010310378 |title=The effect of anomie on academic dishonesty among university students |year=2000 |last1=Caruana |first1=Albert |last2=Ramaseshan |first2=B. |last3=Ewing |first3=Michael T. |journal=International Journal of Educational Management |volume=14 |pages=23–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, anomie was seen as a &quot;push factor&quot; in tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Anomie, ego-enhancement and tourism |author=Graham M. S. Dann |journal=Annals of Tourism Research |volume=4 |issue=4 |date=March–April 1977 |pages=184–194 |quote= travel has the advantage of permitting the traveller to behave in a manner normally circumvented by the dictates of convention. When on holiday the tourist can overstep the bounds of fashion, tell a few stories normally deemed improper or inappropriate, wear flashy clothes, eat exotic food, get drunk, become more sexually permissive, alter his timetable, stay up half the night, listen to loud local music, etc., in short, indulge in those kinds of behavior generally frowned upon in his home environment. |url=https://www.academia.edu/1534649 |doi=10.1016/0160-7383(77)90037-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an older variant, the 1913 ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' reports use of the word ''anomie'' as meaning &quot;disregard or violation of the law.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, A. H., and M. Rokeach. 1956. &quot;Anomie, authoritarianism, and prejudice: A replication.&quot; ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''anomie'' as a social disorder is not to be confused with [[anarchy]]: proponents of [[anarchism]] claim that anarchy does not necessarily lead to anomie and that [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] command actually increases lawlessness. Some [[anarcho-primitivism|anarcho-primitivists]] argue that complex societies, particularly industrial and post-industrial societies, directly cause conditions such as anomie by depriving the individual of self-determination and a relatively small reference group to relate to, such as the band, clan, or tribe.

==Synnomie==
[[Freda Adler]] coined '''''synnomie''''' as the opposite of anomie.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nivette2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nivette|first1=Amy E.|title=Old theories and new approaches: Evaluating Freda Adler's theory of low crime and its implications for criminology|journal=Theoretical Criminology|volume=15|issue=1|year=2011|pages=83–99|issn=1362-4806|doi=10.1177/1362480610380103|s2cid=145111901}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adler1983&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frank Adler|author2=Freda Adler|title=Nations Not Obsessed with Crime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tD5mQgAACAAJ|year=1983|publisher=F.B. Rothman|isbn=978-0-8377-0216-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[Émile Durkheim]]'s concept of [[social solidarity]] and [[collective consciousness]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Nivette2011&quot; /&gt; Adler defined ''synnomie'' as &quot;a congruence of [[Social norm|norms]] to the point of harmonious accommodation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adler1983&quot; /&gt;

Adler described societies in a synnomie state as &quot;characterized by norm conformity, cohesion, intact social controls and norm integration.&quot; [[Social institutions]] such as the family, religion, and communities, largely serve as sources of norms and [[social control]] to maintain a '''synnomic society'''.

== In culture ==

In [[Albert Camus]]'s [[existentialist novel]] ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'', Meursault—the [[Boredom|bored]], alienated protagonist—struggles to construct an individual system of values as he responds to the disappearance of the old. He exists largely in a state of anomie,&lt;ref name=&quot;wilson1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Study of Lives: Essays on Personality in Honor of Henry A. Murray|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/studyoflivesessa00whit|chapter-url-access=registration|year=1963|publisher=Atherton Prentice-Hall|pages=352–359|author=Robert N. Wilson|edition=First|editor=Robert W. White|chapter=15, Albert Camus: Personality as Creative Struggle}}&lt;/ref&gt; as seen from the [[apathy]] evinced in the opening lines: &quot;''{{Lang-fr|Aujourd’hui, maman est morte. Ou peut-être hier, je ne sais pas|label=none}}''&quot; (&quot;Today mum died. Or maybe yesterday, I don't know&quot;).

[[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] expresses a similar concern about anomie in his novel ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]''. [[The Grand Inquisitor]] remarks that in the absence of God and immortal life, everything would be lawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Can Civilization Survive Without God? A Conversation with Christopher and Peter Hitchens|url=http://www.pewforum.org/Belief-in-God/Can-Civilization-Survive-Without-God-.aspx|work=Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=7 July 2013|author=Michael Cromartie|author2=Christopher Hitchens|author3=Peter Hitchens|format=transcript|date=12 October 2010|quote=The Brothers Karamazov... says, if there’s no God, then surely everything is possible — thinkable...  Unfortunately, these are problems of human society and the human psyche — you might say, soul — whatever attitude we take to the humanness or the transcendent.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, that any act becomes thinkable, that there is no moral compass, which leads to apathy and detachment.

This is in contrast to [[unconventional superconductor]]s, which do not. Conventional superconductors can be either [[Type-I superconductor|type-I]] or [[Type-II superconductor|type-II]].

Most [[chemical element|elemental]] superconductors are conventional. Niobium and vanadium are type-II, while most other elemental superconductors are type-I. Critical temperatures of some elemental superconductors:

Most compound and alloy superconductors are type-II materials. The most commonly used conventional superconductor in applications is a [[niobium-titanium]] alloy - this is a type-II superconductor with a superconducting critical temperature of 11 K. The highest critical temperature so far achieved in a conventional superconductor was 39 K (-234 °C) in [[magnesium diboride]].

      <text bytes="55850" xml:space="preserve">In [[logic]] and [[proof theory]], '''natural deduction''' is a kind of [[proof calculus]] in which [[logical reasoning]] is expressed by [[inference rules]] closely related to the &quot;natural&quot; way of reasoning. This contrasts with [[Hilbert-style system]]s, which instead use [[axiom]]s as much as possible to express the logical laws of [[deductive reasoning]].

== Motivation ==
Natural deduction grew out of a context of dissatisfaction with the axiomatizations of deductive reasoning common to the systems of [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], and [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] (see, e.g., [[Hilbert system]]). Such axiomatizations were most famously used by [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] in their mathematical treatise ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''. Spurred on by a series of seminars in Poland in 1926 by [[Jan Lukasiewicz|Łukasiewicz]] that advocated a more natural treatment of logic, [[Stanisław Jaśkowski|Jaśkowski]] made the earliest attempts at defining a more natural deduction, first in 1929 using a diagrammatic notation, and later updating his proposal in a sequence of papers in 1934 and 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaśkowski|1934}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His proposals led to different notations
such as [[Fitch-style calculus]] (or Fitch's diagrams) or [[Patrick Suppes|Suppes]]' method for which [[John Lemmon|Lemmon]] gave a variant called [[system L]].

Natural deduction in its modern form was independently proposed by the German mathematician [[Gerhard Gentzen]] in 1934, in a dissertation delivered to the faculty of mathematical sciences of the University of Göttingen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gentzen|1934}}, {{harvnb|Gentzen|1935}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''natural deduction'' (or rather, its German equivalent ''natürliches Schließen'') was coined in that paper:

{{quote|Ich wollte nun zunächst einmal einen Formalismus aufstellen, der dem wirklichen Schließen möglichst nahe kommt. So ergab sich ein &quot;Kalkül des natürlichen Schließens&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gentzen|1934|p=176}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
(First I wished to construct a formalism that comes as close as possible to actual reasoning. Thus arose a &quot;calculus of natural deduction&quot;.)}}

Gentzen was motivated by a desire to establish the consistency of [[number theory]]. He was unable to prove the main result required for the consistency result, the [[cut elimination theorem]]—the Hauptsatz—directly for natural deduction. For this reason he introduced his alternative system, the [[sequent calculus]], for which he proved the Hauptsatz both for [[Classical logic|classical]] and [[intuitionistic logic]]. In a series of seminars in 1961 and 1962 [[Dag Prawitz|Prawitz]] gave a comprehensive summary of natural deduction calculi, and transported much of Gentzen's work with sequent calculi into the natural deduction framework. His 1965 monograph ''Natural deduction: a proof-theoretical study''&lt;ref name=prawitz1965&gt;{{harvnb|Prawitz|1965}}, {{harvnb|Prawitz|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was to become a reference work on natural deduction, and included applications for [[modal logic|modal]] and [[second-order logic]].

In natural deduction, a [[proposition]] is deduced from a collection of premises by applying inference rules repeatedly. The system presented in this article is a minor variation of Gentzen's or Prawitz's formulation, but with a closer adherence to [[Per Martin-Löf|Martin-Löf]]'s description of logical judgments and connectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin-Löf|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgments and propositions==
A ''[[Judgment (mathematical logic)|judgment]]'' is something that is knowable, that is, an object of knowledge. It is ''evident'' if one in fact knows it.&lt;ref&gt;This is due to Bolzano, as cited by {{harvnb|Martin-Löf|1996|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus &quot;''it is raining''&quot; is a judgment, which is evident for the one who knows that it is actually raining; in this case one may readily find evidence for the judgment by looking outside the window or stepping out of the house. In mathematical logic however, evidence is often not as directly observable, but rather deduced from more basic evident judgments. The process of deduction is what constitutes a ''proof''; in other words, a judgment is evident if one has a proof for it.

The most important judgments in logic are of the form &quot;''A is true''&quot;. The letter ''A'' stands for any expression representing a ''proposition''; the truth judgments thus require a more primitive judgment: &quot;''A is a proposition''&quot;. Many other judgments have been studied; for example, &quot;''A is false''&quot; (see [[classical logic]]), &quot;''A is true at time t''&quot; (see [[temporal logic]]), &quot;''A is necessarily true''&quot; or &quot;''A is possibly true''&quot; (see [[modal logic]]), &quot;''the program M has type τ''&quot; (see [[programming language]]s and [[type theory]]), &quot;''A is achievable from the available resources''&quot; (see [[linear logic]]), and many others. To start with, we shall concern ourselves with the simplest two judgments &quot;''A is a proposition''&quot; and &quot;''A is true''&quot;, abbreviated as &quot;''A'' prop&quot; and &quot;''A'' true&quot; respectively.

The judgment &quot;''A'' prop&quot; defines the structure of valid proofs of ''A'', which in turn defines the structure of propositions. For this reason, the [[inference rule]]s for this judgment are sometimes known as ''formation rules''. To illustrate, if we have two propositions ''A'' and ''B'' (that is, the judgments &quot;''A'' prop&quot; and &quot;''B'' prop&quot; are evident), then we form the compound proposition ''A and B'', written symbolically as &quot;&lt;math&gt;A \wedge B&lt;/math&gt;&quot;. We can write this in the form of an inference rule:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{A\hbox{ prop} \qquad B\hbox{ prop}}{(A \wedge B)\hbox{ prop}}\ \wedge_F&lt;/math&gt;

where the parentheses are omitted to make the inference rule more succinct:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{A\hbox{ prop} \qquad B\hbox{ prop}}{A \wedge B\hbox{ prop}}\ \wedge_F&lt;/math&gt;

RF signal generators are available as benchtop instruments, rackmount instruments, embeddable modules and in card-level formats. Mobile, field-testing and airborne applications benefit from lighter, battery-operated platforms.  In automated and production testing, web-browser access, which allows multi-source control, and faster frequency switching speeds improve test times and throughput.

RF signal generators are required for servicing and setting up [[radio receiver]]s, and are used for professional RF applications.

Audio-frequency signal generators generate signals in the audio-frequency range and above. An early example was the [[HP200A]] Audio Oscillator, the first product sold by the [[Hewlett-Packard|Hewlett-Packard Company]] in 1939. Applications include checking frequency response of audio equipment, and many uses in the electronic laboratory.

Equipment [[distortion]] can be measured using a very-low-distortion audio generator as the signal source, with appropriate equipment to measure output distortion harmonic-by-harmonic with a [[Spectrum analyser|wave analyser]], or simply [[total harmonic distortion]]. A distortion of 0.0001% can be achieved by an audio signal generator with a relatively simple circuit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waynekirkwood.com/Images/pdf/Cyril_Bateman/Bateman_Notes_Cap_Sound_1.pdf Capacitor Sounds 1 - Low Distortion (sub 1PPM ) 1 kHz Test Oscillator, C Bateman, Electronics World July 2002, expanded March 2003].

==== Vector signal generator ====
[[File:E4438C ESG Vector Signal Generator.jpg|right|400px|thumb|A vector signal generator]]
With the advent of digital communications systems, it is no longer possible to adequately test these systems with traditional analog signal generators. This has led to the development of the vector signal generator, which is also known as a digital signal generator. These signal generators are capable of generating digitally-modulated radio signals that may use any of a large number of [[digital modulation]] formats such as [[QAM]], [[QPSK]], [[Frequency-shift keying|FSK]], [[BPSK]], and [[OFDM]]. In addition, since modern commercial digital communication systems are almost all based on well-defined industry standards, many vector signal generators can generate signals based on these standards. Examples include [[GSM]], [[WCDMA|W-CDMA (UMTS)]], [[CDMA2000]], [[Long Term Evolution|LTE]], [[WiFi|Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11)]], and [[WiMAX|WiMAX (IEEE 802.16)]]. In contrast, military communication systems such as [[JTRS]], which place a great deal of importance on robustness and information security, typically use very proprietary methods. To test these types of communication systems, users will often create their own custom waveforms and download them into the vector signal generator to create the desired test signal.

==== Digital pattern generator ====
{{Main article|Digital pattern generator}}
A logic signal generator or data pattern generator or [[digital pattern generator]] produces logic signals - that is logical 1s and 0s in the form of conventional voltage levels. The usual voltage standards are: [[LVTTL]], [[LVCMOS]].
It is different from a &quot;pulse/pattern generator&quot;, which refers to signal generators able to generate logic pulses with different analog characteristics (such as pulse rise/fall time, high level length, ...).

A digital pattern generator is used as stimulus source for digital integrated circuits and embedded systems - for functional validation and testing.

== Special purpose signal generators ==
[[File:Tone-generator-and-wire-tracker-0a.jpg|thumb|right|A pitch generator and a probe for locating a specific pair of wires amongst many, for example in a [[punch block]].]]

In addition to the above general-purpose devices, there are several classes of signal generators designed for specific applications.

=== Pitch generators and audio generators ===

A pitch generator is a type of signal generator optimized for use in [[sound reproduction|audio]] and [[acoustics]] applications. Pitch generators typically include sine waves over the [[audio frequency]] range (20 [[Hertz|Hz]]&amp;ndash;20&amp;nbsp;kHz). Sophisticated pitch generators will also include sweep generators (a function which varies the output frequency over a range, in order to make frequency-domain measurements), multipitch generators (which output several pitches simultaneously, and are used to check for [[intermodulation distortion]] and other non-linear effects), and tone bursts (used to measure response to transients). Pitch generators are typically used in conjunction with [[sound level meter]]s, when measuring the acoustics of a room or a sound reproduction system, and/or with oscilloscopes or specialized audio analyzers.

Many pitch generators operate in the [[Digital data|digital]] domain, producing output in various digital audio formats such as [[AES3]], or [[SPDIF]]. Such generators may include special signals to stimulate various digital effects and problems, such as [[Clipping (signal processing)|clipping]], [[jitter]], [[bit error]]s; they also often provide ways to manipulate the [[metadata]] associated with digital audio formats.

The term [[synthesizer]] is used for a device that generates audio signals for music, or that uses slightly more intricate methods.

==== Computer programs ====
[[Computer program]]s can be used to generate arbitrary waveforms on a general-purpose computer and output the waveform via an output interface. Such programs may be provided commercially or be freeware. Simple systems use a standard computer [[sound card]] as output device, limiting the accuracy of the output waveform and limiting frequency to lie within the [[audio-frequency]] band.

=== Video signal generator ===
{{main|Video signal generator}}
A video signal generator is a device which outputs predetermined [[video]] and/or [[television]] waveforms, and other signals used to stimulate faults in, or aid in parametric measurements of, television and video systems. There are several different types of video signal generators in widespread use. Regardless of the specific type, the output of a video generator will generally contain [[synchronization]] signals appropriate for television, including horizontal and vertical sync pulses (in analog) or sync words (in digital). Generators of ''composite'' video signals (such as [[NTSC]] and [[PAL]]) will also include a [[colorburst]] signal as part of the output. Video signal generators are available for a wide variety of applications, and for a wide variety of digital formats; many of these also include audio generation capability (as the audio track is an important part of any video or television program or motion picture).

In [[mathematics]], the '''Klein four-group''' is a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] with four elements, in which each element is [[Involution (mathematics)|self-inverse]] (composing it with itself produces the identity)
and in which composing any two of the three non-identity elements produces the third one.
It can be described as the [[symmetry group]] of a non-square [[rectangle]] (with the three non-identity elements being horizontal and vertical reflection and 180-degree rotation),
as the group of [[bitwise operation|bitwise]] [[exclusive or]] operations on two-bit binary values,
or more [[abstract algebra|abstractly]] as {{nowrap|Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the [[Direct product of groups|direct product]] of two copies of the [[cyclic group]] of [[Order (group theory)|order]] 2.
It was named '''''Vierergruppe''''' (meaning four-group) by [[Felix Klein]] in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;''Vorlesungen über das Ikosaeder und die Auflösung der Gleichungen vom fünften Grade'' (Lectures on the icosahedron and the solution of equations of the fifth degree)&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also called the '''Klein group''', and is often symbolized by the letter V or as K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

The Klein four-group, with four elements, is the smallest group that is not a [[cyclic group]]. There is only one other group of order four, up to [[group isomorphism|isomorphism]], the cyclic group of order 4. Both are [[abelian group]]s. The smallest non-abelian group is the [[symmetric group of degree 3]], which has order 6.

== Presentations ==
The Klein group's [[Cayley table]] is given by:
{| class=wikitable width=120
!*
!e
!''a''
!''b''
!''c''
|- align=center
!e
|e || ''a'' || ''b'' || ''c''
|- align=center

| ''a'' || e || ''c'' || ''b''
|- align=center
!''b''
|''b'' || ''c'' || e || ''a''
|- align=center
!''c''
| ''c'' || ''b'' || ''a'' || e
|}

The Klein four-group is also defined by the [[presentation of a group|group presentation]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{V} = \langle a,b \mid a^2 = b^2 = (ab)^2 = e \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

All non-[[identity element|identity]] elements of the Klein group have order 2, thus any two non-identity elements can serve as generators in the above presentation. The Klein four-group is the smallest non-[[cyclic group]]. It is however an [[abelian group]], and isomorphic to the [[dihedral group]] of order (cardinality) 4, i.e. D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (or D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, using the geometric convention); other than the group of order 2, it is the only dihedral group that is abelian.

The Klein four-group is also isomorphic to the [[direct sum]] {{nowrap|Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⊕ Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, so that it can be represented as the pairs {{nowrap|{(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)} }} under component-wise addition [[Modular arithmetic|modulo 2]] (or equivalently the [[Bit array|bit strings]] {{nowrap|{00, 01, 10, 11} }}under [[bitwise XOR]]); with (0,0) being the group's identity element. The Klein four-group is thus an example of an [[elementary abelian group|elementary abelian 2-group]], which is also called a [[Boolean group]]. The Klein four-group is thus also the group generated by the [[symmetric difference]] as the binary operation on the [[subset]]s of a [[powerset]] of a set with two elements, i.e. over a [[field of sets]] with four elements, e.g. &lt;math&gt;\{\emptyset, \{\alpha\}, \{\beta\}, \{\alpha, \beta\}\}&lt;/math&gt;; the [[empty set]] is the group's identity element in this case.

Another numerical construction of the Klein four-group is the set {{nowrap|{ 1, 3, 5, 7 },}} with the operation being [[Multiplicative group of integers modulo n|multiplication modulo 8]]. Here ''a'' is 3, ''b'' is 5, and {{nowrap|1=''c'' = ''ab''}} is {{nowrap|1=3 × 5 = 15 ≡ 7 (mod 8)}}.

The Klein four-group has a representation as 2x2 real matrices with the operation being matrix multiplication:

:&lt;math&gt;
  e =\begin{pmatrix}
     1&amp;0\\
     0&amp;1
     \end{pmatrix}\,\,
  a =\begin{pmatrix}
     1&amp;0\\
     0&amp;-1
     \end{pmatrix}\,\,
  b =\begin{pmatrix}
     -1&amp;0\\
     0&amp;1
     \end{pmatrix}\,\,
  c =\begin{pmatrix}
     -1&amp;0\\
     0&amp;-1
     \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Geometry ==
[[File:GreenRectangularCross.png|thumb|right|The symmetry group of this cross is the Klein four-group.  It can be flipped horizontally (''a'') or vertically (''b'') or both (''ab'') and remain unchanged.  Unlike a square, though, a quarter-turn rotation will change the figure.]]
Geometrically, in two dimensions the Klein four-group is the [[symmetry group]] of a [[rhombus]] and of [[rectangle]]s that are not [[square (geometry)|squares]], the four elements being the identity, the vertical reflection, the horizontal reflection, and a 180 degree rotation.

In three dimensions there are three different symmetry groups that are algebraically the Klein four-group V:
*one with three perpendicular 2-fold rotation axes: D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
*one with a 2-fold rotation axis, and a perpendicular plane of reflection: {{nowrap|1=C&lt;sub&gt;2''h''&lt;/sub&gt; = D&lt;sub&gt;1''d''&lt;/sub&gt;}}
*one with a 2-fold rotation axis in a plane of reflection (and hence also in a perpendicular plane of reflection): {{nowrap|1=C&lt;sub&gt;2''v''&lt;/sub&gt; = D&lt;sub&gt;1''h''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
{{Clear}}

== Permutation representation ==
[[File:Klein four-group; Cayley table; subgroup of S4 (elements 0,7,16,23).svg|thumb|Identity and double-[[transposition (mathematics)|transpositions]] of four objects form V]]
[[File:Klein four-group; Cayley table; subgroup of S4 (elements 0,1,6,7).svg|thumb|Other permutations of four objects, forming V as well&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See: [[Subgroup#4 elements|4 element subsets of S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]]]
The three elements of order two in the Klein four-group are interchangeable: the [[automorphism group]] of V is the group of permutations of these three elements.

The Klein four-group's permutations of its own elements can be thought of abstractly as its [[permutation representation]] on four points:
:V = { (), (1,2)(3,4), (1,3)(2,4), (1,4)(2,3) }

In this representation, V is a [[normal subgroup]] of the [[alternating group]] A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
(and also the [[symmetric group]] S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) on four letters. In fact, it is the [[Kernel (algebra)#Group homomorphisms|kernel]] of a surjective [[group homomorphism]] from S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

Other representations within S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are:

{ (), (1,2), (3,4), (1,2)(3,4)}

{ (), (1,3), (2,4), (1,3)(2,4)}

{ (), (1,4), (2,3), (1,4)(2,3)}

They are not normal subgroups of S&lt;sub&gt;4.&lt;/sub&gt;
{{Clear}}

== Algebra ==
According to [[Galois theory]], the existence of the Klein four-group (and in particular, the permutation representation of it) explains the existence of the formula for calculating the roots of [[quartic equation]]s in terms of [[Radical of an algebraic group|radical]]s, as established by [[Lodovico Ferrari]]:
the map {{nowrap|S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} corresponds to the resolvent cubic, in terms of [[Lagrange resolvents]].

In the construction of [[finite ring]]s, eight of the eleven rings with four elements have the Klein four-group as their additive substructure.

If '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the multiplicative group of non-zero reals and '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; the multiplicative group of [[positive reals]], '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[group of units]] of the ring {{nowrap|'''R''' &amp;times; '''R'''}}, and {{nowrap|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}} is a subgroup of {{nowrap|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/sup&gt;}} (in fact it is the [[identity component|component of the identity]] of {{nowrap|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/sup&gt;}}). The [[quotient group]] {{nowrap|('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/sup&gt;) / ('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)}} is isomorphic to the Klein four-group. In a similar fashion, the group of units of the [[split-complex number|split-complex number ring]], when divided by its identity component, also results in the Klein four-group.

== Graph theory ==
The simplest [[simple graph|simple]] [[connected graph]] that admits the Klein four-group as its [[graph automorphism|automorphism group]] is the [[diamond graph]] shown below.  It is also the automorphism group of some other graphs that are simpler in the sense of having fewer entities.  These include the graph with four vertices and one edge, which remains simple but loses connectivity, and the graph with two vertices connected to each other by two edges, which remains connected but loses simplicity.

}}

== Music ==
In [[music composition]] the four-group is the basic group of permutations in the [[twelve-tone technique]]. In that instance the Cayley table is written;&lt;ref&gt;[[Milton Babbitt|Babbitt, Milton]].

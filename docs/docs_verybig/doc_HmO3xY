The high plains found on Triton's eastern hemisphere, such as Cipango Planum, cover over and blot out older features, and are therefore almost certainly the result of icy lava washing over the previous landscape. The plains are dotted with pits, such as [[Leviathan Patera]], which are probably the vents from which this lava emerged. The composition of the lava is unknown, although a mixture of ammonia and water is suspected.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncycSolSys-Triton&quot;/&gt;

Four roughly circular &quot;walled plains&quot; have been identified on Triton. They are the flattest regions so far discovered, with a variance in altitude of less than 200&amp;nbsp;m. They are thought to have formed from eruption of icy lava.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncycSolSys-Triton&quot;/&gt; The plains near Triton's eastern limb are dotted with black spots, the ''[[Macula (planetary geology)|maculae]]''. Some maculae are simple dark spots with diffuse boundaries, and others comprise a dark central patch surrounded by a white halo with sharp boundaries. &lt;!-- Typical diameter of maculae is about 100&amp;nbsp;km and width of halo is between 20 and 30&amp;nbsp;km. Some speculate the maculae are outliers of the south polar cap, which retreats in summer. --&gt; The maculae typically have diameters of about 100&amp;nbsp;km and widths of the halos of between 20 and 30&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncycSolSys-Triton&quot;/&gt;

There are extensive ridges and valleys in complex patterns across Triton's surface, probably the result of freeze–thaw cycles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elliot1998-warming&quot;/&gt; Many also appear to be tectonic in nature and may result from extension or [[strike-slip fault]]ing.&lt;ref name=&quot;linea&quot;/&gt; There are long double ridges of ice with central troughs bearing a strong resemblance to [[Europa (moon)#Lineae|Europan lineae]] (although they have a larger scale&lt;ref name=&quot;Prockter&quot;/&gt;), and which may have a similar origin,&lt;ref name=&quot;EncycSolSys-Triton&quot;/&gt; possibly shear heating from strike-slip motion along faults caused by diurnal tidal stresses experienced before Triton's orbit was fully circularized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prockter&quot;/&gt; These faults with parallel ridges expelled from the interior cross complex terrain with valleys in the equatorial region. The ridges and furrows, or ''[[Sulcus (geology)|sulci]],'' such as [[Yasu Sulci]], [[Ho Sulci]], and [[Lo Sulci]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Aksnes1990-Nomenclature&quot;/&gt; are thought to be of intermediate age in Triton's geological history, and in many cases to have formed concurrently. They tend to be clustered in groups or &quot;packets&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;linea&quot;/&gt;

=== Cantaloupe terrain ===
[[File:PIA01537 Triton Faults.jpg|thumb|200px|Cantaloupe terrain viewed from 130,000&amp;nbsp;km by ''[[Voyager 2]]'', with crosscutting [[Europa (moon)|Europa]]-like double ridges. Slidr Sulci (vertical) and Tano Sulci form the prominent &quot;X&quot;.]]
Triton's western hemisphere consists of a strange series of fissures and depressions known as &quot;cantaloupe terrain&quot; because of its resemblance to the skin of a [[cantaloupe]] melon. Although it has few craters, it is thought that this is the oldest terrain on Triton.&lt;ref name=&quot;cantaloupe&quot;/&gt; It probably covers much of Triton's western half.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncycSolSys-Triton&quot;/&gt;

Cantaloupe terrain, which is mostly dirty water ice, is only known to exist on Triton. It contains depressions {{nowrap|30–40&amp;nbsp;km}} in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;cantaloupe&quot;/&gt; The depressions (''cavi'') are probably not impact craters because they are all of similar size and have smooth curves. The leading hypothesis for their formation is [[diapir]]ism, the rising of &quot;lumps&quot; of less dense material through a stratum of denser material.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncycSolSys-Triton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Diapirism&quot;/&gt; Alternative hypotheses include formation by collapses, or by flooding caused by [[cryovolcanism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cantaloupe&quot;/&gt;

=== Impact craters ===
[[File:PIA01538 Complex Geologic History of Triton.jpg|thumb|200x200px|Tuonela Planitia (left) and Ruach Planitia (center) are two of Triton's [[cryovolcanic]] &quot;walled plains&quot;. The paucity of craters is evidence of extensive, relatively recent, geologic activity.]]
Due to constant erasure and modification by ongoing geological activity, [[impact crater]]s on Triton's surface are relatively rare. A census of Triton's craters imaged by ''Voyager 2'' found only 179 that were incontestably of impact origin, compared with 835 observed for [[Uranus]]'s moon [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]], which has only three percent of Triton's [[surface area]].&lt;ref name=&quot;impact&quot;/&gt; The largest crater observed on Triton thought to have been created by an impact is a {{convert|27|km|mi|adj=mid|-diameter}} feature called [[Mazomba (crater)|Mazomba]].&lt;ref name=&quot;impact&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ingersoll1990-plumes&quot;/&gt; Although larger craters have been observed, they are generally thought to be volcanic in nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;impact&quot;/&gt;

The few impact craters on Triton are almost all concentrated in the leading hemisphere—that facing the direction of the orbital motion—with the majority concentrated around the equator between 30° and 70° longitude,&lt;ref name=&quot;impact&quot;/&gt; resulting from material swept up from orbit around Neptune.&lt;ref name=&quot;surface age&quot;/&gt; Because it orbits with one side permanently facing the planet, astronomers expect that Triton should have fewer impacts on its trailing hemisphere, due to impacts on the leading hemisphere being more frequent and more violent.&lt;ref name=&quot;impact&quot;/&gt; ''Voyager 2'' imaged only 40% of Triton's surface, so this remains uncertain. However, the observed cratering asymmetry exceeds what can be explained on the basis of the impactor populations, and implies a younger surface age for the crater-free regions (≤ 6&amp;nbsp;million years old) than for the cratered regions (≤ 50&amp;nbsp;million years old).&lt;ref name = &quot;Mah2019&quot;/&gt;

== Observation and exploration ==
[[File:PIA23874-NeptuneMoonTriton-TridentMission-20200616.jpg|thumb|left|400px|NASA illustration detailing the studies of the proposed Trident mission]]
[[File:Voyager 2 Neptune and Triton.jpg|thumb|200px|Neptune (top) and Triton (bottom) three days after flyby of ''Voyager 2'']]
The orbital properties of Triton were already determined with high accuracy in the 19th century. It was found to have a retrograde orbit, at a very high angle of inclination to the plane of Neptune's orbit. The first detailed observations of Triton were not made until 1930. Little was known about the satellite until ''[[Voyager 2]]'' flew by in 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncycSolSys-Triton&quot;/&gt;

Before the [[Planetary flyby|flyby]] of ''Voyager 2'', astronomers suspected that Triton might have [[liquid nitrogen]] seas and a nitrogen/methane atmosphere with a density as much as 30% that of Earth. Like the famous overestimates of the [[Atmosphere of Mars|atmospheric density of Mars]], this proved incorrect. As with [[Mars]], a denser atmosphere is postulated for its early history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lunine1992-massive&quot;/&gt;

The first attempt to measure the diameter of Triton was made by [[Gerard Kuiper]] in 1954. He obtained a value of 3,800&amp;nbsp;km. Subsequent measurement attempts arrived at values ranging from 2,500 to 6,000&amp;nbsp;km, or from slightly smaller than the Moon (3,474.2&amp;nbsp;km) to nearly half the diameter of Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cruikshank1979-diameterreflectance&quot;/&gt; Data from the approach of ''Voyager 2'' to Neptune on August 25, 1989, led to a more accurate estimate of Triton's diameter (2,706&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone1989-Voyager 2-Neptune&quot;/&gt;

In the 1990s, various observations from Earth were made of the limb of Triton using the [[occultation]] of nearby stars, which indicated the presence of an atmosphere and an exotic surface. Observations in late 1997 suggest that Triton is heating up and the atmosphere has become significantly denser than when ''Voyager 2'' flew past in 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hubblesite&quot;/&gt;

[[Neptune Orbiter|New concepts for missions to the Neptune system]] to be conducted in the 2010s were proposed by [[NASA]] scientists on numerous occasions over the last decades. All of them identified Triton as being a prime target and a separate Triton lander comparable to the [[Huygens (spacecraft)|''Huygens'' probe]] for [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] was frequently included in those plans. No efforts aimed at Neptune and Triton went beyond the proposal phase and NASA's funding on missions to the outer Solar System is currently focused on the Jupiter and Saturn systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASAgov-428154&quot;/&gt; A proposed lander mission to Triton, called ''[[Triton Hopper]]'', would mine nitrogen ice from the surface of Triton and process it to be used as propellant for a small rocket, enabling it to fly or 'hop' across the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Ferreira |first=Becky |date=August 28, 2015 |title=Why We Should Use This Jumping Robot to Explore Neptune |url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/neptune-or-bust |magazine=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice Motherboard]] |accessdate=March 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Oleson 2015'&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/triton-hopper-exploring-neptunes-captured-kuiper-belt-object/ |title=Triton Hopper: Exploring Neptune's Captured Kuiper Belt Object |date=7 May 2015 |first=Steven |last=Oleson |publisher=NASA Glenn Research Center |accessdate=11 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another concept, involving a flyby, was formally proposed in 2019 as part of NASA's [[Discovery Program]] under the name ''[[Trident (spacecraft)|Trident]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-Trident&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Brown |first=David W. |date=19 March 2019 |title=Neptune's Moon Triton Is Destination of Proposed NASA Mission |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/science/triton-neptune-nasa-trident.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=20 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yhprum's law]], where the name is spelled backwards, is &quot;anything that can go right, will go right&quot; – the optimistic application of Murphy's law in reverse.

[[Peter Drucker]], the management consultant, with a nod to Murphy, formulated &quot;Drucker's Law&quot; in dealing with complexity of management: &quot;If one thing goes wrong, everything else will, and at the same time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Peter F. ''Management, Tasks, Responsibilities, and Practices'', p. 681&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mrs. Murphy's Law'' is a [[corollary]] of Murphy's Law.  It states that things will go wrong when Mr. Murphy is away, as in this formulation:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Murphy's Law 2000 |page=4 |author=Arthur Bloch |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Mysteries of life and the universe |page=171 |author=William H.

'''International Sign''' ('''IS''') is a [[pidgin]] [[sign language]]&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; which is used in a variety of different contexts, particularly at international meetings such as the [[World Federation of the Deaf]] (WFD) congress, events such as the [[Deaflympics]] and the [[Miss &amp; Mister Deaf World]], and informally when travelling and socialising.

Linguists do not agree on what the term &quot;International Sign&quot; means precisely, and empirically derived dictionaries are lacking.

== Naming ==
While the more commonly used term is International Sign, it is sometimes referred to as '''Gestuno''',&lt;ref&gt;Rubino, F., Hayhurst, A., and Guejlman, J. (1975). ''Gestuno. International sign language of the deaf.'' Carlisle: British Deaf Association.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''International Sign Pidgin'''&lt;ref&gt;McKee R., Napier J. (2002) &quot;Interpreting in International Sign Pidgin: an analysis.&quot; ''Journal of Sign Language Linguistics'' 5(1).&lt;/ref&gt; and '''International Gesture''' (IG).&lt;ref&gt;Bar-Tzur, David (2002). ''International gesture: Principles and gestures'' [http://www.theinterpretersfriend.com/indj/ig.html website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111191723/http://www.theinterpretersfriend.com/indj/ig.html |date=2017-11-11 }}&lt;br&gt;Moody, W. (1987).''International gesture.'' In J. V. Van Cleve (ed.), &quot;Gallaudet encyclopedia of deaf people and deafness&quot;, Vol 3 S-Z, Index. New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; International Sign is a term used by the [[World Federation of the Deaf]] and other international organisations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

==History==
Deaf people in the Western and Middle Eastern world have gathered together using sign language for 2,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;Woll, Bencie and Ladd, Paddy (2003). Deaf communities. In M. Marschark and P. Spencer (eds.), The Handbook of Deaf Studies, Language and Education (pp. 151-163). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; When Deaf people from different sign language backgrounds get together, a contact variety of sign language arises from this contact, whether it is in an informal personal context or in a formal international context. Deaf people have therefore used a kind of auxiliary gestural system for international communication at sporting or cultural events since the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;McKee R., Napier J. (2002), citing:&lt;br&gt;*Moody, B. (n.d.). International communication among deaf people. Unpublished, undated manuscript.&lt;br&gt;*Scott Gibson, L. &amp; R. Ojala (1994). “International Sign Interpreting.” Paper presented to the Fourth East and South African Sign Language Seminar, Uganda, August 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The need to standardise an international sign system was discussed at the first [[World Deaf Congress]] in 1951, when the WFD was formed. In the following years, a [[pidgin]] developed as the delegates from different language backgrounds communicated with each other, and in 1973, a WFD committee (&quot;the Commission of Unification of Signs&quot;) published a standardized vocabulary.  They selected &quot;naturally spontaneous and easy signs in common use by deaf people of different countries&quot;&lt;ref&gt;British Deaf Association. (1975). ''Gestuno: International sign language of the deaf.'' Carlisle, England: BDA.&lt;/ref&gt; to make the language easy to learn. A book published by the commission in the early 1970s, ''Gestuno: International Sign Language of the Deaf'', contains a vocabulary list of about 1,500 signs. The name &quot;Gestuno&quot; was chosen, referencing ''gesture'' and ''oneness''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

However, when Gestuno was first used at the WFD congress in Bulgaria in 1976, it was incomprehensible to deaf participants.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenstock, Rachel. ''International Sign: Negotiating Understanding'', Research at Gallaudet, Fall 2005 - Winter 2006. This article was derived from the author's 2004 PhD dissertation:&lt;br&gt;* Rosenstock, Rachel. (2004). ''An Investigation of International Sign: Analyzing Structure and Comprehension.'' Gallaudet University.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, it was developed informally by deaf and hearing interpreters, and came to include more grammar, especially linguistic features that are thought to be universal among sign languages, such as role shifting and the use of classifiers. Additionally, the vocabulary was gradually replaced by more [[iconicity|iconic]] signs and [[loanword|loan signs]] from various sign languages.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The first training course in Gestuno was conducted in Copenhagen in 1977 to prepare interpreters for the 5th World Conference on Deafness. Sponsored by the Danish Association of the Deaf and the University of Copenhagen, the course was designed by Robert M. Ingram and taught by Betty L. Ingram, two American interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;Moody, Bill (2002). &quot;International Sign: A Practitioner's Perspective.&quot; Journal of Interpretation, 1-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name &quot;Gestuno&quot; has fallen out of use, and the phrase &quot;International Sign&quot; is now more commonly used in English to identify this variety of sign. This may be because current IS has little in common with the signs published under the name 'Gestuno'.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

== Description ==
International Sign has been described as a highly variable type of signed communication used between two signers who lack a common sign language.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=E. Mara|date=2014|title=Building the tower of Babel: International Sign, linguistic commensuration, and moral orientation|url=|journal=Language in Society|language=|volume=43|issue=4|pages=445–465|doi=10.1017/S0047404514000396|issn=0047-4045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hiddinga|first=Anja|last2=Crasborn|first2=Onno|date=2011|title=Signed languages and globalization|url=https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/1155047/104594_Hiddinga_Crasborn2011.pdf|journal=Language in Society|language=|volume=40|issue=4|pages=483–505|doi=10.1017/S0047404511000480|issn=0047-4045|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most experts do not technically consider IS to be a full language,&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; but rather a form of communication that arises on the spot.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; It is characterized by a focus on [[Iconicity|iconic]] or [[pantomimic]] structures; IS signers may also point to nearby objects.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; While some degree of standardization takes place in event such WFD and the [[European Union of the Deaf]], it is limited to vocabulary, not grammar.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

There is no consensus on what International Sign is exactly. It may either refer to the way strangers sign with each other when they lack a common sign language, or it can refer to a conventionalized form used by a group of people with regular contact.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=|title=International sign : linguistic, usage, and status issues|last=Whynot|first=Lori|date=2015|publisher=Gallaudet Univ Press|isbn=9781563686573|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=|chapter=Telling, Showing, and Representing: Conventions of the Lexicon in International Sign Expository Text|oclc=936854431}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term &quot;International Sign&quot; might also lead to the misconception that it is a [[Standard language|standardized]] form of communication.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

Deaf people typically know only one sign language.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Signers from differing countries may use IS spontaneously with each other, with relative success.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; This communicative success is linked to various factors. First, people who sign in IS have a certain amount of shared contextual knowledge. Secondly, signers may take advantage of shared knowledge of a spoken language, such as English. Thirdly, communication is made easier by the use of iconic signs and pantomime.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

==Vocabulary==
The lexicon of International Sign is made by negotiation between signers. IS Signers reportedly use a set of signs from their own national sign language mixed with highly iconic signs that can be understood by a large audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=|title=International sign : linguistic, usage, and status issues|last=Stone|first=Christopher|last2=Russell|first2=Debra|publisher=Gallaudet Univ Press|year=2015|isbn=9781563686573|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=|chapter=Comparative Analysis of Depicting Signs in International Sign and Natural Sign Language Interpreting|oclc=936854431}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=European Union of the Deaf|url=https://www.eud.eu/about-us/eud-position-paper/international-sign-guidelines/|title=International Sign|website=EUD|access-date=2018-11-19|quote=Experienced IS signers try to be as independent from one specific national sign language as possible, to ensure a large audience of varied backgrounds can understand the message to the fullest extent possible.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most signs are taken from [[American Sign Language]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The linguistics of sign languages : an introduction|last=Anne|first=Baker|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2016|isbn=9789027212306|location=Amsterdam|pages=319|oclc=932169688}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, a committee created and standardized a system of international signs. They tried to choose the most understandable signs from diverse sign languages to make the language easy to learn for not only the Deaf but for both interim management and an everyday observer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Signs For Humanity|url=https://www.facebook.com/signsforhumanity/posts/1896871037002347|title=Deaf people from different countries can communicate with each other using something called International Sign!|website=[[Facebook]]|publisher=Length 1:34 minutes|date=2018-07-24|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; IS interpreter Bill Moody noted in a 1994 paper that the vocabulary used in conference settings is largely derived from the sign languages of the [[Western world]] and is less comprehensible to those from African or Asian sign language backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Moody, B. (1994). ''International Sign: Language, pidgin or charades?'' Paper presented at the &quot;Issues in Interpreting 2&quot; conference, University of Durham, Durham, April 1994. Cited in McKee R., Napier J. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; A 1999 study by [[Bencie Woll]] suggested that IS signers often use a large amount of vocabulary from their native language,&lt;ref&gt;Sutton-Spence, Rachel and Woll, Bencie. (1999) ''The Linguistics of British Sign Language: An Introduction.'' p. 32. {{ISBN|0-521-63718-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; choosing sign variants that would be more easily understood by a foreigner.&lt;ref&gt;Day, Linda, (2000) ''British Sign Language in its Social Context'', [http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/DeafStudiesTeaching/bslsoc/Sessions/s10.htm Session 10: Language Planning and Standardisation] - notes for students&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Rachel Rosenstock notes that the vocabulary exhibited in her study of International Sign was largely made up of highly iconic signs common to many sign languages:&lt;blockquote&gt;Over 60% of the signs occurred in the same form in more than eight SLs as well as in IS. This suggests that the majority of IS signs are not signs borrowed from a specific SL, as other studies found, but rather are common to many natural SLs. Only 2% of IS signs were found to be unique to IS. The remaining 38% were borrowed (or &quot;loan&quot;) signs that could be traced back to one SL or a group of related SLs.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenstock, [[Op cit]].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;International Sign has a simplified lexicon. In IS for example, the English “who”, “what”, and “how” are all translated simply to “what”. Another example of this simplified lexicon is the location of the sign itself. IS will use movements from the chest to indicate feeling signs, and signs near the head will indicate knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenstock|first=Rachel|date=2008|title=The Role of Iconicity in International Sign|journal=Sign Language Studies|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=131–159|doi=10.1353/sls.2008.0003|issn=1533-6263}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been several attempt at making dictionaries for IS. However, these lack detailed information on data collection, nor do they describe the exact meaning or how the signs should be used. This causes difficulty for training and teaching people in IS, as there is no empirical evidence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

==Grammar==
Very little is known about the grammar of IS.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; It tends to use fewer [[Mouthing|mouthings]] and often has a larger signing space. The use of mouth gestures for adverbials is emphasized.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;

People communicating in IS tend to make heavy use of role play, as well as a feature common to most sign languages researched to date: an extensive [[formal system]] of [[classifier handshape|classifier]]s. Classifiers are used to describe things, and they transfer well across linguistic barriers. It has been noted that signers are generally better at interlingual communication than non-signers, even without a [[lingua franca]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

A paper presented in 1994 suggested that IS signers &quot;combine a relatively rich and structured grammar with a severely impoverished lexicon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Allsop, Lorna; Woll, Bencie; Brauti, John Martin (1995). ''International sign: The creation of an international deaf community and sign language.'' In: Bos, Heleen F. and Schermer, Gertrude M. (eds): &quot;Sign Language Research 1994: Proceedings of the Fourth European Congress on Sign Language Research, Munich, September 1–3, 1994.&quot; (International Studies on Sign Language and Communication of the Deaf; 29) Hamburg : Signum (1995) - p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; Supalla and Webb (1995) describe IS as a kind of a pidgin, but conclude that it is &quot;more complex than a typical pidgin and indeed is more like that of a full sign language&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Supalla, T. and Webb, R. (1995). &quot;The grammar of international sign: A new look at pidgin languages.&quot; In: Emmorey, Karen / Reilly, Judy S. (eds): ''Language, gesture, and space.'' (International Conference on Theoretical Issues in Sign Language Research) Hillsdale, N.J. : Erlbaum (p. 347).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key issues with International Sign==
Simplification of signs in IS can vary between interpreters (one can choose a simplification over a much longer explanation), and because of this, certain information can be lost in translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenstock|first=Rachel|date=2008|title=The Role of Iconicity in International Sign|journal=Sign Language Studies|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=144–146|doi=10.1353/sls.2008.0003|issn=1533-6263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because sign language relies heavily on local influences, many Deaf people don’t understand each other's signs. Furthermore, cultural differences in signs can vary even within borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Battison|first=Robbin|last2=Jordan|first2=I. King|date=1976|title=Cross-Cultural Communication with Foreign Signers: Fact and Fancy|journal=Sign Language Studies|volume=1010|issue=1|pages=57–59|doi=10.1353/sls.1976.0018|issn=1533-6263}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, many Deaf people revert to fingerspelling and gestures or mime, which has its own variations based on similar sign language properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Battison|first=Robbin|last2=Jordan|first2=I. King|date=1976|title=Cross-Cultural Communication with Foreign Signers: Fact and Fancy|journal=Sign Language Studies|volume=1010|issue=1|pages=60|doi=10.1353/sls.1976.0018|issn=1533-6263}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The World Federation of the Deaf (WFD) has voiced concern about the issues with simplification and standardization, and that it limits a sign to a single meaning or word, thus losing all natural forms of the initial meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adam|first=Robert|date=2015-07-08|title=Standardization of Sign Languages|journal=Sign Language Studies|language=en|volume=15|issue=4|pages=432–445|doi=10.1353/sls.2015.0015|issn=1533-6263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a study commissioned by the WFD in 2007 showed that IS is primarily used only in Europe and the United States, further alienating other nations from the process of building a united language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=E.

'''Kerch''' ({{lang-uk|Керч}}; {{lang-ru|Керчь}}, {{IPA-ru|ˈkʲertɕ|pron}}; [[Old East Slavic]]: Кърчевъ, [[Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Παντικάπαιον}}, ''Pantikápaion'', [[Medieval Greek]]: {{lang|grc-x-medieval|Βόσπορος}} ''Bosporos''; {{lang-crh|{{lang|crh-Latn|Keriç}}, {{lang|crh-Cyrl|Керич}}}}; {{lang-tr|Kerç}}) is a city of regional significance on the [[Kerch Peninsula]] in the east of the [[Crimea]].
Population: {{Crimea-census2014|147,033|punct=.}}

Founded 2,600 years ago as an [[Colonies in antiquity#Greek colonies|ancient Greek colony]], Kerch is considered to be one of the most ancient cities in Crimea. The city experienced rapid growth starting in the 1920s and was the site of a [[Battle of the Kerch Peninsula|major battle]] during [[World War II]].

Today, it is one of the largest cities in Crimea and is among the republic's most important industrial, transport and tourist centres.

==History==

===Ancient times===
Archeological digs at Mayak village near the city ascertained that the area had already been inhabited in 17th–15th centuries BC. While many finds from Kerch can be found in the [[Hermitage Museum]] in St Petersburg and the local museum, a large number of antique sculptures, reliefs, bronze and glassware, ceramics and jewellery were excavated in 1855-1856 during the [[Crimean War]] by [[Doctor Duncan MacPherson]], a surgeon from the British Army, and later donated to the [[British Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/term/BIOG61062 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/term/BIOG59348?id=BIOG59348&amp;page=1#page-top British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://opacplus.bsb-muenchen.de/Vta2/bsb10221604/bsb:BV020307300?page=7 Antiquities of Kertch, and Researches in the Cimmerian Bosphorus, with Remarks on the ethnological and physical History of the Crimea by Duncan MacPherson ( 1857 ) ]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kerch Pantikapaeum.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ruins of [[Panticapaeum]]. 6th century BC]]
Kerch as a city starts its history in 7th century BC, when [[Greeks|Greek colonists]] from [[Miletus]] founded a city-state named [[Panticapaeum]]&lt;ref&gt;See [[Talk:Kerch#Meaning of Greek name?]] for discussion about the Greek name Panticapaeum.&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Mount Mithridat]] near the mouth of the [[Melek-Chesme|Melek-Chesme river]]. Panticapaeum subdued nearby cities and by 480 BC became a capital of the [[Kingdom of Bosporus]]. Later, during the rule of [[Mithradates VI Eupator]], Panticapaeum for a short period of time became the capital of the much more powerful and extensive [[Kingdom of Pontus]].
The city was located at the intersection of trade routes between the [[steppe]] and [[Europe]]. This caused it to grow rapidly. The city's main exports were grain and salted fish; wine-making was also common. Panticapaeum minted its own coins. According to extant documents the Melek-Chesme river (small and shallow nowadays) was navigable in Bosporan times, and sea [[galley]]s were able to enter the river. A large portion of the city's population was ethnically [[Scythian]], later [[Sarmatian]], as the large royal barrow ([[Kurgan]]) at [[Kul-Oba]] testifies.

In the 1st century AD Panticapaeum and the Kingdom of Bosporus suffered from [[Ostrogoth]] raids; then the city was devastated by the [[Huns]] in AD 375.

[[Myrmekion]] was founded in the eastern part of the Kerch, 4&amp;nbsp;km NE of ancient [[Panticapaeum]]. The settlement was founded by [[Ionians]] in the first half of the 6th c. BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Butyagin |first=Alexander|url= http://blacksea.ehw.gr/forms/filePage.aspx?lemmaId=10725 |title=Myrmekion|publisher=Foundation of the Hellenic World|date=29 July 2008|access-date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:Yenikale fortress in Kerch.jpg|thumb|300px|Yenikale fortress in Kerch]]
From the 6th century the city was under the control of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. By order of Emperor [[Justinian I]], a citadel named Bospor was built there. Bospor was the centre of a [[bishopric]], the [[diocese of Bosporus]] and developed under the influence of Greek [[Christianity]]. In 576, it withstood a siege by the [[Göktürks]] under Bokhan, aided by Anagai, the last [[khan (title)|khan]] (ruler) of the [[Uturgurs]] (tribe of [[Huns]]).
[[File:Kerch ChurchOfStJohn.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Church of St John the Baptist, 8th century]]

In the 7th century, the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Khazars]] took control of Bospor, and the city was named '''Karcha''' from Turkic &quot;karşı&quot; meaning 'opposite, facing.' The main local government official during Khazar times was the [[tudun]]. Christianity was a major religion in Kerch during the period of Khazar rule. Kerch's Church of [[John the Baptist|St. John the Baptist]] was founded in 717; thus, it is the oldest church in Ukraine.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}  The &quot;Church of the Apostles&quot; existed during the late 8th and early 9th centuries, according to the &quot;Life of the Apostle Andrew&quot; by [[Epiphanius of Salamis]].

Following the fall of Khazaria to [[Kievan Rus']] in the late 10th century, Kerch became the centre of a Khazar [[successor-state]]. Its ruler, [[Georgius Tzul]], was deposed by a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]-[[Kievan Rus'|Rus]] expedition in 1016.

From the 10th century, the city was a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] settlement named Korchev, which belonged to the [[Tmutarakan]] principality. Kerch was a center of trade between Russia', [[Crimea]], [[Caucasus]] and the [[Orient]].

In the 13th century, the Crimea including Korchev was invaded by [[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongols]]. After Mongols, the city became the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] colony of Cerco (Cherkio) in 1318 and served as a sea harbour, where townspeople worked at salt-works and fishery.

In 1475, city was passed to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. During the Turkish rule Kerch fell into decay and served as a [[slave trade|slave-market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Inalcik |first=Halil|chapter=Servile Labor in the Ottoman Empire |chapter-url= http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu:80/~fisher/hst373/readings/inalcik6.html |editor1-last=Ascher |editor-first1=Abraham |editor2-last=Király |editor-first2=Béla K. |editor2-link=Béla Király|editor3-last= Halasi-Kun |editor-first3=  Tibor|title=The Mutual Effects of the Islamic and Judeo-Christian Worlds: The East European Pattern|place=Brooklyn, N.Y.|publisher=Brooklyn College Press|year=1979|pages=25–43|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504102244/http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu:80/~fisher/hst373/readings/inalcik6.html|archive-date=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It repeatedly suffered from raids of [[Zaporizhian Sich|Zaporizhian Cossacks]].

===18th – 20th centuries===
In response to strengthening of [[Russian Empire|Russia]]n military forces in [[Sea of Azov|Azov]] area, the Turks built a fortress, named [[Yenikale]], near Kerch on the shore of [[Kerch Strait]]. The fortress was completed by 1706. In 1771 the [[Imperial Russian Army]] invaded [[Crimea]] and approached Yenikale. The Turks decided to abandon the fortress, though reinforcements from the Ottoman Empire had arrived a few days earlier. By the Peace [[Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji]] in 1774, Kerch and Yenikale were ceded to Russia. As a result, the Turkish heritage has been almost completely wiped out.
[[File:Kerch aivazovsky.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Kerch'' by [[Ivan Aivazovsky]], 1839]]
In 1790 Russian naval forces under the command of admiral [[Fyodor Fyodorovich Ushakov|Fyodor Ushakov]] defeated the Turkish fleet at the [[Battle of Kerch Strait (1790)|Battle of Kerch Strait]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/mf-black.htm| title= Black Sea Fleet (BSF) Morskoyo Flota ( Naval Force)|website=GlobalSecurity.org|access-date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its location, from 1821 Kerch developed into an important trade and fishing port. The state museum of ancient times and a number of educational institutions were opened in the city. The ironwork factory was built in 1846 based on a huge [[iron ore]] deposit found on Kerch Peninsula.

During the [[Crimean War]] the city was devastated by [[British Empire|British]] forces in 1855.

In the late 19th century, mechanical and [[cement]] factories were built, and tinned food and [[tobacco]] factories were established.
By 1900, Kerch was connected to a [[railroad]] system, and the fairway of Kerch Strait was deepened and widened. At this time, the population had reached 33,000.

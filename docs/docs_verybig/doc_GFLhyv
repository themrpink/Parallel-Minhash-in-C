==Early life==
{{one source|section|date=February 2015}}
Al-Shehhi was born in [[Ras al-Khaimah]], on 9 May 1978, in the [[United Arab Emirates]], to a Muslim cleric who died in 1997 and an [[Egypt]]ian mother. Described as a quiet and devout Muslim, details about al-Shehhi's life in the UAE, however, are difficult to acquire. According to an October 2001 article in the New York Times, &quot;If residents of Mr. Shehhi's hometown had heard of him before now, they were certainly not telling strangers. Four hours spent in the community yielded no address and no one -- policemen, firemen, pedestrians or local officials -- who did anything more than shrug at the mention of his name.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Manasseh, &quot;Who Did More Evil than All . . . Who Were Before Him&quot;|work=Portrait of the Kings|pages=187–224|publisher=Augsburg Fortress Publishers|isbn=9781451469585|doi=10.2307/j.ctt9m0txn.10|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from high school in 1995, al-Shehhi enlisted in the [[Emirati military]] and received a half a year of basic training before he was admitted into a military scholarship program that allowed him to continue his education in Germany. Upon arriving in Germany in April 1996, al-Shehhi moved into an apartment, which he shared with three other scholarship students for two months before boarding with a local German family. Several months later, he moved into his own apartment. Those who knew him described al-Shehhi as a very religious and friendly individual who wore western clothes and sometimes rented cars for trips to Berlin, France, and the Netherlands. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

His teacher in Germany, Gabriele Bock, recalls him as someone who seemed to be struggling to have plans to the future while studying there.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/vita-des-attentaeters-marwan-al-shehhi-auffaellig-war-nur-seine-unauffaelligkeit-a-161098.html&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Germany, al-Shehhi enrolled in the [[University of Bonn]] after completing a German course. He left Germany in June 1997 to attend to problems at home although the university forbade him. In early 1998, al-Shehhi transferred to the [[Technical University of Hamburg]]. A poor student, al-Shehhi was directed by the Scholarship program administrators to repeat a semester of his studies back in Bonn beginning in August 1998. Al-Shehhi did not enroll back at Bonn until January 1999 and continued to struggle with his studies. By July 1999, Marwan returned to Hamburg to study shipbuilding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf The 9/11 Commission Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019203222/https://9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf |date=2016-10-19 }} p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been reported al-Shehhi also married in 1999, holding a belated celebration in January 2000, in an arranged marriage by his half-brother with a young woman named Fawzeya. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Trump’s false claim that the 9/11 hijackers’ wives ‘knew exactly what was going to happen’|quote=The Washington Post, 2015,}} https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/12/06/trumps-dubious-claim-that-the-911-hijackers-wives-knew-exactly-what-was-going-to-happen/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-2001-09-23-0109230108-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radicalization==
{{one source|section|date=February 2015}}
After moving to [[Hamburg]] in 1998, al-Shehhi helped form the [[Hamburg cell]] with Mohamed Atta and Ramzi bin al-Shibh. There, his views became more and more radical. They met three or four times a week to discuss anti-American feelings and plot possible attacks. When someone asked why he and Atta never laughed, al-Shehhi retorted, &quot;How can you laugh when people are dying in Palestine?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faqs.org/docs/911/911Report-179.html ''The 9/11 Commission Report''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041026091051/http://www.faqs.org/docs/911/911Report-179.html |date=2004-10-26 }}, page 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 October 1999, Marwan al-Shehhi was filmed at [[Said Bahaji]]'s wedding in Germany with other 9/11 hijackers including [[Ziad Jarrah]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-05-07-hijackers_x.htm &quot;Wedding video shows Sept. 11 hijackers, plotters&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913201359/http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-05-07-hijackers_x.htm |date=2009-09-13 }}, usatoday.com, 5 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.refworld.org/docid/4e65d8432.html|title=Refworld &amp;#124; Still at Large Ten Years After 9/11: Said Bahaji, Mohammed Atta's Right Hand Man|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|last=Refugees|website=Refworld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1999, al-Shehhi, Atta, Ziad Jarrah, Said Bahaji, and Ramzi bin al-Shibh decided to travel to [[Chechnya]] to fight against the [[Russia]]ns, but were convinced by [[Khalid al-Masri]] and [[Mohamedou Ould Slahi]] at the last minute to change their plans. They instead traveled to [[Afghanistan]] to meet with Osama bin Laden and trained for terrorist attacks. Immediately afterwards, Atta, al-Shehhi, and Jarrah reported their [[passport]]s stolen, possibly to erase travel visas to Afghanistan. After their training, the hijackers began to attempt to hide their radicalism. al-Shehhi shaved his beard and seemed to his old friends like he had become less religious. After the attacks, a librarian in Hamburg reported that al-Shehhi boasted to her &quot;There will be thousands of dead. You will think of me ... You will see, in America something is going to happen. There will be many people killed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline.jsp?timeline=complete_911_timeline&amp;startpos=500#a0400boasts |others=April–May 2000: Hijacker Tells Librarian About Major Attack in US. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001222905/http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline.jsp?timeline=complete_911_timeline&amp;startpos=500 |archive-date=October 1, 2006 |title=The Complete 9/11 Timeline: Cooperative Research |access-date=February 14, 2015 |work=Cooperative Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Desmond.

Al-Shehhi returned to Germany in March 2000, and began to learn to fly airplanes. [[Ammar al-Baluchi]], one of the most important 9/11 financial organizers, bought a [[Boeing 747]] [[flight simulator]] program using al-Shehhi's credit card. Eventually they decided that German flight schools would not work for them, and they decided to train in the United States. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==In the United States==

===Flight education and preparation===
[[Image:Marwansflightrecord.jpg|left|thumb|80px|Shehhi's flight record from [[Huffman Aviation|Huffman]]]]
Al-Shehhi was the first of the Hamburg group to leave for the United States. He arrived in [[Newark, New Jersey]] on 29 May 2000. Atta and Jarrah joined him the next month, and the three men began to search for flight schools. Al-Shehhi and Jarrah posed as body guards of Atta, who were also posing as a &quot;[[Saudi Arabia]]n royal family member&quot; while the three of them took flying lessons in [[Venice, Florida]]. They logged hundreds of hours on a [[Boeing 727]] flight simulator. They received their licenses by December 2000. Their expenses were paid for by [[Ali Abdul Aziz Ali]]. On either 26 or 27 December, Atta, Jarrah, and Marwan abandoned a [[Piper Cherokee]] that had stalled on the runway of [[Miami International Airport]]. On 29 December, Atta, Jarrah and Marwan went to the Opa-Locka Airport and practiced on a [[Boeing 727]] simulator. Al-Shehhi began to take &quot;surveillance flights&quot; in the summer of 2001, watching the operations of flight crews and making final preparations.  {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Travels in early 2001===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
[[Ziad Jarrah]], Atta, and al-Shehhi, having progressed in their training, all took foreign trips during the holiday period of 2000-2001. When Atta returned to Florida, al-Shehhi left for [[Morocco]], traveling to [[Casablanca]] in mid-January 2001. al-Shehhi's family, concerned about not having heard from him, reported him missing to the UAE government. The UAE embassy in turn contacted the Hamburg police and a UAE representative tried to find him in Germany, visiting mosques and al-Shehhi's last address in Hamburg. After learning that his family was looking for him, al-Shehhi telephoned them on 20 January and said he was living and studying in Hamburg. The UAE government then told the Hamburg police they could call off the search.

Atta and al-Shehhi both encountered some difficulty reentering the United States, on 10 January and 19 January, respectively. As neither had presented a student visa, both of them had to persuade [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]] inspectors that they should be admitted so that they could continue their flight training. Neither operative had any problem clearing customs. After returning to Florida from their trips, Atta and al-Shehhi visited Georgia, staying briefly in Norcross and Decatur, and renting a single-engine plane to fly with an instructor in Lawrenceville. By 19 February, Atta and al-Shehhi were in Virginia. They had rented a mailbox in Virginia Beach, cashed a check, and then promptly returned to Georgia, staying in Stone Mountain. In mid-March, [[Ziad Jarrah]] was in Georgia as well, staying in Decatur. At the end of the month, Jarrah left the United States again and visited Sengün in Germany for two weeks. In early April, Atta and al-Shehhi returned to Virginia Beach and closed the mailbox they had opened in February.

Atta and al-Shehhi returned to Virginia Beach from their travels in Georgia, making their way to a large [[Dar Al-Hijrah]] mosque, sometime in early April. They were joined there by 9/11 hijackers [[Nawaf al-Hazmi]] and [[Hani Hanjour]] who had moved out of San Diego and Arizona after living in or visiting [[Abdussattar Shaikh]]'s house, where [[Khalid al-Mihdhar]] also stayed. In January, the mosque had recently hired the same [[imam]] [[Anwar al-Awlaki]] with whom Hazmi had spent time at the Rabat mosque in San Diego. He remembered Hazmi from San Diego but denied having contact with Hazmi or Hanjour in Virginia. Atta and al-Shehhi returned to Florida and moved into an apartment in Coral Springs. Atta stayed in Florida, awaiting the arrival of the first hijackers. Al-Shehhi, on the other hand, bought a ticket to Cairo and flew there from Miami on 18 April. Al-Shehhi met with Atta's father, who stated in a post-9/11 interview that al-Shehhi wanted to pick up Atta's international driver's license and some money.

Al-Shehhi returned to Miami on 2 May. That day, Atta and Jarrah were together, about 30 miles to the north, visiting a [[Department of Motor Vehicles]] office in [[Lauderdale Lakes, Florida]], to get Florida driver's licenses. In mid-July 2001, some of the hijackers and members of the Hamburg cell gathered near [[Salou, Spain]], for a period of a few days up to a couple of weeks. Since hotel records are sparse during some of that time, it is thought that they may have spent considerable time in and around safe houses related to the al-Qaeda leader in Spain, [[Imad Yarkas]]. After 9/11, Spanish investigators followed the trails backwards, and the events they uncovered were chronicled in the Spanish nationwide newspaper ''[[El País]]''. Witnesses told Spanish investigators they saw a man who resembled al-Shehhi on 17 July 2001 at the [[PortAventura Park|Universal Studios Port Aventura]] theme park next to Salou, Spain. The visitor, who was accompanied by two men, inquired about rides at the customer service counter. Witnesses indicated these companions resembled Ziad Jarrah, the later pilot on [[United Airlines Flight 93]], and Said Bahaji, a then 26-year-old German-Moroccan member of the al-Qaeda cell in Hamburg. Back in Germany, it had been Bahaji's 1999 wedding during which al-Shehhi was filmed. Other witnesses elsewhere had pointed out Bahaji from photos, as one of the men they saw in Spain. But Bahaji bore a resemblance in appearance to Atta, who was traced to the same areas in Spain via hotel and travel records.

===August 2001===
On August 23, the [[Israel]]i [[Mossad]] reportedly gave al-Shehhi's name to the [[CIA]] as part of a list of 19 names they said were planning an attack in the near future. Only four of the names are known for certain, including al-Shehhi; Nawaf al-Hazmi, Mohamed Atta, and Khalid al-Mihdhar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/context.jsp?item=a082301mossad |others=August 23, 2001: Mossad Reportedly Gives CIA List of Terrorist Living in US; at Least Four 9/11 Hijackers Named |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930031428/http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/context.jsp?item=a082301mossad |archive-date=September 30, 2007 |title=Context of 'August 23, 2001: Mossad Reportedly Gives CIA List of Terrorist Living in US; at Least Four 9/11 Hijackers Named' |work=History Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/europe/2294487.stm &quot;Report details US 'intelligence failures'&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303161138/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/europe/2294487.stm |date=2009-03-03 }}, bbc.co.uk, 2 October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Marwan Al-Shehhi full card.jpg|thumb|130px|Shehhi's motel registration]]
On August 26, Marwan signed into the Panther [[Motel]] in [[Deerfield Beach, Florida]], paying US$500, saying he wanted to stay until 2 September, and listing a [[Mailboxes Etc.]] as his permanent address. His register entry indicated that he was driving a blue [[Chevrolet Malibu]], assumed to be the one rented by Atta two weeks prior, and manager Richard Surma said that he bent rules to allow Marwan to have another man as an overnight guest. On 28 August, Marwan went to the [[Miami International Airport]], accompanied by an unknown man, where he purchased his ticket for [[United Airlines Flight 175|Flight 175]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/2002_hr/092602mueller.html &quot;Statement for the Record, FBI Director Robert S.

Another employee later reported finding  a [[box cutter]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

According to librarian Kathleen Hensmen, [[Wail al-Shehri]] and [[Waleed al-Shehri]] used Internet access at Delray Beach Public Library in August 2001, where they may have been looking at information on [[crop dusting]]. They reportedly left the library with a third middle-eastern man, thought to be Marwan al-Shehhi, whom Hensmen claimed asked her for the name of a local restaurant. Staff at [[Shuckum's Oyster Bar|Shuckum's Oyster Pub and Seafood Grill]] in [[Hollywood, Florida]] claimed they recognized both Atta and Marwan as two of the people who had been at the restaurant on either 7 or 8 September. While there are varying stories about Atta's activities, all sources indicate that al-Shehhi drank [[rum and coke]] while talking to the others. On 9 September, they flew to Boston. The next day, al-Shehhi and three of the other hijackers, [[Fayez Banihammad]], [[Mohand al-Shehri]], and [[Satam al-Suqami]], shared a room at the Milner Hotel in [[Boston]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Attacks==
{{Main|United Airlines Flight 175}}
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
[[File:UA Flight 175 hits WTC south tower 9-11 edit.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|Flight 175 crashes into the South Tower, 9:03 a.m.]]
According to the [[9/11 Commission Report]], al-Shehhi made a 3-minute call to Mohamed Atta (6:52-6:55&amp;nbsp;a.m.) on 11 September from within [[Logan International Airport]] as both American 11 and United 175 were to fly from Boston Logan to [[Los Angeles International Airport]]. 
al-Shehhi boarded United 175 at 7:27&amp;nbsp;a.m. Around 30 minutes into the flight, between 8:42 and 8:46&amp;nbsp;a.m., the plane was hijacked. During the flight, the plane narrowly avoided a [[mid-air collision]] with another aircraft, Delta Airlines Flight 2315. Several calls were made from the plane to relatives, the passengers learning of the fate of American 11.

The plane was flown into the South Tower of the World Trade Center at 9:03:02&amp;nbsp;a.m. The plane crashed with a speed of approximately 590&amp;nbsp;mph (950&amp;nbsp;km/h) while carrying about 10,000 gallons (37,850 litres) of jet fuel. It was seen live on television around the world as it crashed into the South Tower, being filmed from multiple vantage points. al-Shehhi flew the plane faster and lower into the tower than Atta did, into the eastern half of the South Tower's southern facade close to the southeast corner, leading to the South Tower collapsing before the North Tower, which was the first to be hit.

[[File:Minuet (PSF).png|thumb|Minuet in the [[classical period (music)|Classical period]]]]

A '''minuet''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|ɪ|nj|u|ˈ|ɛ|t}}; also spelled ''menuet'') is a [[social dance]] of French origin for two people, usually in [[Triple metre|{{music|time|3|4}} time]]. The word was adapted from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''minuetto'' and [[French language|French]] ''menuet'', possibly from the French ''menu'' meaning slender, small, referring to the very small steps, or from the early 17th-century popular group dances called ''branle à mener'' or ''amener''.

The term also describes the musical form that accompanies the dance, which subsequently developed more fully, often with a longer [[musical form]] called the '''minuet and trio''', and was much used as a [[Movement (music)|movement]] in the early classical [[symphony]].

== Dance ==
{{Main|Minuet step}}
The name may refer to the short steps, ''pas menus'', taken in the dance {{harv|Chisholm|1911}}, or else be derived from the ''branle à mener'' or ''amener'', popular group dances in early 17th-century France {{harv|Little|2001}}. The minuet was traditionally said to have descended from the ''bransle de Poitou'', though there is no evidence making a clear connection between these two dances. The earliest treatise to mention the possible connection of the name to the expression ''pas menus'' is Gottfried Taubert's ''Rechtschaffener Tantzmeister'', published in Leipzig in 1717, but this source does not describe the steps as being particularly small or dainty {{harv|Russell|2006|loc=140–41}}. At the period when it was most fashionable it was controlled, ceremonious and graceful {{harv|Chisholm|1911}}.

== Music ==

=== Rhythm and form ===
[[File:Minuet dance pattern.png|thumb|right|250px|Minuet [[rhythm]] {{harv|Blatter|2007|loc=28}}]]
The name of this dance is also given to a musical composition written in the same time and [[rhythm]], though when not accompanying an actual dance the pace was quicker {{harv|Chisholm|1911}}. Stylistically refined minuets, apart from the social dance context, were introduced—to [[opera]] at first—by [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], who included no fewer than 92 of them in his theatrical works {{harv|Little|2001}} and in the late 17th century the minuet was adopted into the [[suite (music)|suite]], such as some of the suites of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Händel]]. Among Italian and some French composers the minuet was often considerably quicker and livelier and was sometimes written in {{music|time|3|8}} or {{music|time|6|8}} time.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=Russell verifies only the last sentence in this paragraph}} Because the tempo of a minuet was not standard, the tempo direction ''tempo di minuetto'' was ambiguous unless qualified by another direction, as it sometimes was {{harv|Russell|2001}}.

Initially, before its adoption in contexts other than social dance, the minuet was usually in [[binary form]], with two repeated sections of usually eight [[bar (music)|bars]] each. But the second section eventually expanded, resulting in a kind of [[ternary form]]. The second (or middle) minuet provided form of contrast by means of different key and orchestration. On a larger scale, two such minuets might be further combined, so that the first minuet was followed by a second one and then by a repetition of the first. The whole form might in any case be repeated as long as the dance lasted.

==== Minuet and trio ====
Around Lully's time it became a common practice to score this middle section for a [[trio (music)|trio]] (such as two [[oboe]]s and a [[bassoon]], as is common in Lully). As a result, this middle section came to be called the minuet's ''trio'', even when no trace of such an orchestration remains.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The overall structure is called rounded binary or [[Binary form#Simple vs. rounded|minuet form]] {{harv|Rosen|1988|loc=29}}:
:{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| A || B || A or A′
|-
| I (→ V) || V &lt;small&gt;(or other [[closely related key|closely related]])&lt;/small&gt; || I
|}
After these developments by Lully, composers occasionally inserted a modified repetition of the first (A) section or a section that contrasted with both the A section and what was thereby rendered the third or C section, yielding the form A–A′–B–A or A–B–C–A, respectively; an example of the latter is the third movement of Mozart's Serenade No. 13 in G major, [[Köchel catalogue|K.]] 525, popularly known under the title ''[[Eine kleine Nachtmusik]]''.

A livelier form of the minuet simultaneously developed into the [[scherzo]] (which was generally also coupled with a trio). This term came into existence approximately from [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] onwards, but the form itself can be traced back to [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]].

The '''minuet and trio''' eventually became the standard third movement in the four-movement [[classical music era|classical]] [[symphony]], [[Johann Stamitz]] being the first to employ it thus with regularity {{harv|Langford|2019|loc={{Page needed|date=April 2020}}}}.

An example of the true form of the minuet is to be found in ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' {{harv|Chisholm|1911}}.

A famous example of a more recent instrumental work in minuet form is [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]]'s [[Minuet in G (Paderewski)|Minuet in G]].

'''John Dalton''' {{postnominals|FRS}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɔː|l|t|ən}}; 6 September 1766 – 27 July 1844) was an English [[chemist]], [[physicist]], and [[meteorologist]]. He is best known for introducing the [[atomic theory]] into chemistry, and for his research into [[Color blindness|colour blindness]], sometimes referred to as Daltonism in his honour.

==Early life==

John Dalton was born into a [[Quaker]] family from [[Eaglesfield, Cumbria|Eaglesfield]], near [[Cockermouth]], in [[Cumberland]], England.&lt;ref name=&quot;CHF&quot;/&gt; His father was a weaver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.biography.com/people/john-dalton-9265201 |title = John Dalton}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his early education from his father and from [[Quaker]] John Fletcher, who ran a private school in the nearby village of [[Pardshaw Young Friends' Centre|Pardshaw Hall]]. Dalton's family was too poor to support him for long and he began to earn his living, from the age of ten, in the service of wealthy local Quaker Elihu Robinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cockermouth.org.uk/dms-showpage.php?tid=606|title=Pardshaw – Quaker Meeting House|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
When he was 15, Dalton joined his elder brother Jonathan in running a Quaker school in [[Kendal]], [[Westmorland]], about {{convert|45|mi}} from his home. Around the age of 23 Dalton may have considered studying law or medicine, but his relatives did not encourage him, perhaps because being a [[English Dissenters|Dissenter]], he was barred from attending English universities. He acquired much scientific knowledge from informal instruction by [[John Gough (natural philosopher)|John Gough]], a blind philosopher who was gifted in the sciences and arts. At the age of 27 he was appointed teacher of mathematics and [[natural philosophy]] at the &quot;New College&quot; in [[Manchester]], a [[dissenting academy]] (the lineal predecessor, following a number of changes of location, of [[Harris Manchester College, Oxford]]). He remained there until the age of 34, when the college's worsening financial situation led him to resign his post and begin a new career as a private tutor in mathematics and natural philosophy.

==Scientific work==

===Meteorology===
Dalton's early life was influenced by a prominent Quaker, [[Elihu Robinson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=53552|title=Robinson, Elihu|first=Peter|last=Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt; a competent [[meteorology|meteorologist]] and instrument maker, from [[Eaglesfield, Cumbria]], who interested him in problems of mathematics and meteorology. During his years in Kendal, Dalton contributed solutions to problems and answered questions on various subjects in ''[[The Ladies' Diary]]'' and the ''[[Gentleman's Diary]]''. In 1787 at age 21 he began his meteorological diary in which, during the succeeding 57 years, he entered more than 200,000 observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Smith | first = R. Angus | title = Memoir of John Dalton and History of the Atomic Theory | publisher=H. Bailliere | location = London | year = 1856 | page = 279 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOsAAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=angus+smith+john+dalton&amp;pg=PP17 | accessdate =24 December 2007 | isbn = 978-1-4021-6437-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rediscovered [[George Hadley]]'s theory of atmospheric circulation (now known as the [[Hadley cell]]) around this time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/251166/George-Hadley George Hadley] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. Accessed 30 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1793 Dalton's first publication, ''Meteorological Observations and Essays'', contained the seeds of several of his later discoveries but despite the originality of his treatment, little attention was paid to them by other scholars. A second work by Dalton, ''Elements of English Grammar'' (or ''A new system of grammatical instruction: for the use of schools and academies''), was published in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/print/pageturn.html?id=PRINT_992146153503681&lt;/ref&gt;

====Measuring mountains====
After leaving the [[Lake District]], Dalton returned annually to spend his holidays studying meteorology, something which involved a lot of hill-walking. Until the advent of aeroplanes and weather balloons, the only way to make measurements of temperature and humidity at altitude was to climb a mountain. Dalton estimated the height using a [[barometer]]. The [[Ordnance Survey]] did not publish maps for the Lake District until the 1860s. Before then, Dalton was one of the few authorities on the heights of the region's mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geog.port.ac.uk/webmap/thelakes/html/West/WS21P190.htm |title=Thomas West's Guide to the Lakes, 1778/1821 |accessdate=18 January 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125161603/http://www.geog.port.ac.uk/webmap/thelakes/html/West/WS21P190.htm |archivedate=25 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was often accompanied by Jonathan Otley, who also made a study of the heights of the local peaks, using Dalton's figures as a comparison to check his work. Otley published his information in his map of 1818. Otley became both an assistant and a friend to Dalton.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Fletcher Smith ''Jonathan Otley, Man of Lakeland'', publ.

Some advocate a [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] approach to the grandfather paradox. When the time traveller kills their grandfather, the traveller is actually killing a parallel universe version of the grandfather, and the time traveller's original universe is unaltered; it has been argued that since the traveller arrives in a different universe's history and not their own history, this is not &quot;genuine&quot; time travel.&lt;ref name=&quot;stanford time travel&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=Time Travel and Modern Physics|date=December 23, 2009|author1=Frank Arntzenius|author2=Tim Maudlin|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time-travel-phys/|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=May 25, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other variants, the actions of time travellers have no effects outside of their own personal experience, as depicted in [[Alfred Bester]]'s short story ''[[The Men Who Murdered Mohammed]]''.{{non-primary source needed|date=August 2020}}

==Philosophical analysis==
Even without knowing whether time travel to the past is physically possible, it is possible to show using [[modal logic]] that changing the past results in a logical contradiction. If it is necessarily true that the past happened in a certain way, then it is false and impossible for the past to have occurred in any other way. A time traveller would not be able to change the past from the way it ''is;'' they would only act in a way that is already consistent with what ''necessarily'' happened.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|title=The Seas of Language|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198236212|pages=368–369|edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consideration of the grandfather paradox has led some to the idea that time travel is by its very nature paradoxical and therefore logically impossible. For example, the philosopher [[Bradley Dowden]] made this sort of argument in the textbook ''Logical Reasoning'', arguing that the possibility of creating a contradiction rules out time travel to the past entirely. However, some philosophers and scientists believe that time travel into the past need not be logically impossible provided that there is no possibility of changing the past,&lt;ref name=&quot;NicholasSmith&quot;/&gt; as suggested, for example, by the [[Novikov self-consistency principle]]. Dowden revised his view after being convinced of this in an exchange with the philosopher [[Norman Swartz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Swartz&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/~swartz/time_travel1.htm |title=Time Travel - Visiting the Past|author=Norman Swartz|year=1993|publisher=SFU.ca |accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General relativity==
Consideration of the possibility of backward time travel in a hypothetical universe described by a [[Gödel metric]] led famed logician [[Kurt Gödel]] to assert that time might itself be a sort of illusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yourgrau&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yourgrau|first1=Palle|title=A World Without Time: The Forgotten Legacy of Godel and Einstein|date=4 March 2009|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=9780786737000|page=134|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GtY907BlhxYC&amp;q=2005+A+World+Without+Time:+The+Forgotten+Legacy+of+G%C3%B6del+and+Einstein&amp;pg=PA134|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;holt&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Holt|first=Jim|title=Time Bandits|date=2005-02-21|magazine=The New Yorker|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/02/28/time-bandits-2|accessdate=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests something along the lines of the [[eternalism (philosophy of time)|block time]] view, in which time is just another dimension like space, with all events at all times being fixed within this four-dimensional &quot;block&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Causal loops===
{{main|Causal loop}}
Backward time travel that does not create a grandfather paradox creates a causal loop. The [[Novikov self-consistency principle]] expresses one view as to how backward [[time travel]] would be possible without the generation of paradoxes. According to this hypothesis, physics in or near [[closed timelike curves]] (time machines) can only be consistent with the universal laws of physics, and thus only self-consistent events can occur. Anything a time traveller does in the past must have been part of history all along, and the time traveller can never do anything to prevent the trip back in time from happening, since this would represent an inconsistency. Novikov et al. used the example given by physicist [[Joseph Polchinski]] for the grandfather paradox, that of a billiard ball heading toward a time machine. The ball's older self emerges from the time machine and strikes its younger self so that its younger self never enters the time machine. Novikov et al. showed how this system can be solved in a self-consistent way that avoids the grandfather paradox, though it creates a causal loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lossev|first1=Andrei|last2=Novikov|first2=Igor|date=15 May 1992|title=The Jinn of the time machine: non-trivial self-consistent solutions|journal=Class.

[[Seth Lloyd]] and other researchers at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] have proposed an expanded version of the Novikov principle by which probability bends to prevent paradoxes from occurring. Outcomes would become stranger as one approaches a forbidden act, as the universe must favor improbable events to prevent impossible ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sanders|first1=Laura|title=Physicists Tame Time Travel by Forbidding You to Kill Your Grandfather|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/07/time-travel-2/|website=WIRED|accessdate=2017-01-02|date=2010-07-20|quote=But this dictum against paradoxical events causes possible unlikely events to happen more frequently. 'If you make a slight change in the initial conditions, the paradoxical situation won’t happen.

==Quantum physics==
Some physicists, such as [[Daniel Greenberger]],&lt;ref name=&quot;greenberger&quot;&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1007/3-540-26669-0_4|title=Quo Vadis Quantum Mechanics?|year=2005|arxiv=quant-ph/0506027|bibcode=2005qvqm.book...63G|chapter=Quantum Theory Looks at Time Travel|series=The Frontiers Collection|last1=Greenberger|first1=Daniel M.|last2=Svozil|first2=Karl|isbn=3-540-22188-3|page=63|s2cid=119468684}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kettlewell|first=Julianna|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4097258.stm|title=New model 'permits time travel'|work=BBC News|date=June 17, 2005|accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Deutsch]], have proposed that [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] allows for time travel where the past must be self-consistent. Deutsch argues that quantum computation with a negative delay&amp;mdash;backward time travel&amp;mdash;produces only self-consistent solutions, and the chronology-violating region imposes constraints that are not apparent through classical reasoning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deutsch&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deutsch|first1=David|authorlink=David Deutsch|title=Quantum mechanics near closed timelike lines|journal=Physical Review D|date=15 November 1991|volume=44|issue=10|pages=3197–3217|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.44.3197|pmid=10013776|bibcode=1991PhRvD..44.3197D}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, researchers published a simulation validating Deutsch's model with photons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ringbauer&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ringbauer|first1=Martin|last2=Broome|first2=Matthew A.|last3=Myers|first3=Casey R.|last4=White|first4=Andrew G.|last5=Ralph|first5=Timothy C.|title=Experimental simulation of closed timelike curves|journal=Nature Communications|date=19 June 2014|volume=5|page=4145|doi=10.1038/ncomms5145|pmid=24942489|bibcode=2014NatCo...5.4145R|arxiv=1501.05014|s2cid=12779043}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deutsch uses the terminology of &quot;multiple universes&quot; in his paper in an effort to express the quantum phenomena, but notes that this terminology is unsatisfactory. Others have taken this to mean that &quot;Deutschian&quot; time travel involves the time traveller emerging in a different universe, which avoids the grandfather paradox.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billings&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author1=Lee Billings|title=Time Travel Simulation Resolves 'Grandfather Paradox'|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/time-travel-simulation-resolves-grandfather-paradox/|accessdate=24 September 2014|agency=Scientific American|date=2 Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interacting-multiple-universes approach is a variation of [[Hugh Everett|Everett's]] [[many-worlds interpretation]] (MWI) of quantum mechanics. It involves time travellers arriving in a different universe than the one from which they came; it has been argued that, since travellers arrive in a different universe's history and not their own history, this is not &quot;genuine&quot; time travel.&lt;ref name=&quot;stanford time travel&quot; /&gt; Stephen Hawking has argued that even if the MWI is correct, we should expect each time traveller to experience a single self-consistent history, so that time travellers remain within their own world rather than travelling to a different one.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawking warp&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawking.org.uk/space-and-time-warps.html|title=Space and Time Warps|year=1999|accessdate=February 25, 2012|last1=Hawking|first1=Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen Everett argued that Deutsch's approach &quot;involves modifying fundamental principles of quantum mechanics; it certainly goes beyond simply adopting the MWI&quot;, and that even if Deutsch's approach is correct, it would imply that any macroscopic object composed of multiple particles would be split apart when traveling back in time, with different particles emerging in different worlds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Everett MWI&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Everett|first=Allen|title=Time travel paradoxes, path integrals, and the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics|journal=Physical Review D|volume=69|issue=124023|pages=124023|year=2004|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.69.124023|arxiv=gr-qc/0410035|bibcode=2004PhRvD..69l4023E|s2cid=18597824}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it was shown in an article by Tolksdorf and Verch that Deutsch's CTC  self-consistency condition can be fulfilled to arbitrary precision in any quantum system described according to relativistic [[quantum field theory]] on spacetimes where CTCs are excluded, casting doubts on whether Deutsch's condition is really characteristic of quantum processes mimicking CTCs in the sense of [[general relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A '''building,''' or '''edifice,''' is a [[structure]] with a [[roof]] and&lt;ref name=&quot;Egenhofer&quot; /&gt; [[wall]]s standing more or less permanently in one place, such as a [[house]] or [[factory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Egenhofer&quot;/&gt; Buildings come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and functions, and have been adapted throughout history for a wide number of factors, from [[building material]]s available, to weather conditions, land prices, ground conditions, specific uses, and aesthetic reasons. To better understand the term ''building'' compare the list of [[nonbuilding structure]]s.

Buildings serve several societal needs – primarily as shelter from weather, security, living space, privacy, to store belongings, and to comfortably live and work. A building as a shelter represents a physical division of the [[:Category:Human habitats|human habitat]] (a place of comfort and safety) and the ''outside'' (a place that at times may be harsh and harmful).

Ever since the first [[cave painting]]s, buildings have also become objects or canvasses of much artistic expression. In recent years, interest in [[sustainable]] planning and building practices has also become an intentional part of the design process of many new buildings.

== Definitions ==
The word ''building'' is both a noun and a verb: the structure itself and the act of making it. As a noun, a building is 'a structure that has a roof and walls and stands more or less permanently in one place';&lt;ref name=&quot;Egenhofer&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Max J. Egenhofer|title=Geographic Information Science: Second International Conference, GIScience 2002, Boulder, CO, USA, September 25–28, 2002.

In the broadest interpretation a [[fence]] or wall is a building.&lt;ref&gt;Building def. 2. Whitney, William Dwight, and Benjamin E. Smith. ''The Century dictionary and cyclopedia''. vol. 1. New York: Century Co., 1901. 712. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the word ''structure'' is used more broadly than ''building'' including natural and man-made formations&lt;ref&gt;Structure. def. 2. ''Merriam-Webster's dictionary of synonyms: a dictionary of discriminated synonyms with antonyms and analogous and contrasted words''.. Springfield, Mass: Merriam-Webster, 1984. 787. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and does not necessarily have walls. Structure is more likely to be used for a fence. [[Russell Sturgis|Sturgis' Dictionary]] included that &quot;[building] differs from [[architecture]] in excluding all idea of artistic treatment; and it differs from [[construction]] in the idea of excluding scientific or highly skilful treatment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Building. def 1. Sturgis, Russell. ''A dictionary of architecture and building: biographical, historical, and descriptive''. vol. 1. New York: The Macmillan Co. ;, 1901. 2236. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; As a verb, building is the act of construction.

''Structural height'' in technical usage is the height to the highest architectural detail on building from street-level. Depending on how they are classified, spires and masts may or may not be included in this height. Spires and masts used as antennas are not generally included. The definition of a ''low-rise vs. a high-rise'' building is a matter of debate, but generally three storeys or less is considered low-rise.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Francis Wendt and Alan Robert Cerf (1979), ''Real estate investment analysis and taxation'', McGraw-Hill, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Residential ===
{{main|List of human habitation forms}}

Single-family residential buildings are most often called [[house]]s or [[home]]s. Multi-family residential buildings containing more than one dwelling unit are called a [[Duplex (building)|duplex]] or an [[apartment]] building. A [[condominium]] is an apartment that the occupant owns rather than rents. Houses may also be built in pairs ([[semi-detached]]), in terraces where all but two of the houses have others either side; apartments may be built round courtyards or as rectangular blocks surrounded by a piece of ground of varying sizes. Houses which were built as a single dwelling may later be divided into apartments or [[bedsitter]]s; they may also be converted to another use e.g. an office or a shop.

Building types may range from [[Hut (dwelling)|hut]]s to multimillion-dollar high-rise [[apartment block]]s able to house thousands of people. Increasing settlement density in buildings (and smaller distances between buildings) is usually a response to high ground prices resulting from many people wanting to live close to work or similar attractors. Other common [[building material]]s are brick, concrete or combinations of either of these with stone.

Residential buildings have different names for their use depending if they are seasonal include [[holiday cottage]] (vacation home) or [[timeshare]]; size such as a [[cottage]] or [[great house]]; value such as a [[shack]] or [[mansion]]; manner of construction such as a [[log home]] or [[mobile home]]; proximity to the ground such as [[Earth sheltering|earth sheltered]] house, [[stilt house]], or [[tree house]]. Also if the residents are in need of special care such as a [[nursing home]], [[orphanage]] or [[prison]]; or in group housing like [[barracks]] or [[dormitory|dormitories]].

Historically many people lived in communal buildings called [[longhouse]]s, smaller dwellings called [[pit-house]]s and houses combined with barns sometimes called [[housebarn]]s.

Buildings are defined to be substantial, permanent structures so other dwelling forms such as [[houseboat]]s, [[yurt]]s, and [[motorhome]]s are [[dwelling]]s but not buildings.

=== Complex ===
[[File:Competitiveness - Korea.jpg|thumb|[[Aluminium|Aluminum]] panel framed [[Steel building|steal building]], in Korea.]]
Sometimes a group of inter-related (and possibly inter-connected) builds are referred to as a complex – for example a [[housing complex]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lincolnshirelive.co.uk/plans-to-convert-former-housing-complex-into-flats/story-30042482-detail/story.html|title=plans to convert housing complex|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110125715/http://www.lincolnshirelive.co.uk/plans-to-convert-former-housing-complex-into-flats/story-30042482-detail/story.html#|archivedate=2017-01-10|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  educational complex,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.isye.gatech.edu/about/maps-directions/isye-building-complex|title=isye building complex|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103001851/https://www.isye.gatech.edu/about/maps-directions/isye-building-complex|archivedate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; hospital complex, etc.

== Creation ==
The practice of designing, constructing, and operating buildings is most usually a collective effort of different groups of [[professional]]s and [[Tradesperson|trades]]. Depending on the size, complexity, and purpose of a particular building project, the project team may include:

* A [[real estate developer]] who secures [[funding]] for the project;
* One or more financial institutions or other investors that provide the funding
* Local planning and code authorities
* A [[Quantity surveyor|Surveyor]] who performs an ALTA/ACSM and construction surveys throughout the project;
* [[construction management|Construction manager]]s who coordinate the effort of different groups of project participants;
* Licensed [[architect]]s and [[Architectural engineering|engineers]] who provide [[building design]] and prepare construction [[document]]s;
* The principal design Engineering disciplines which would normally include the following professionals: Civil, Structural, Mechanical building services or HVAC (heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning) Electrical Building Services, Plumbing and drainage. Also other possible design Engineer specialists may be involved such as Fire (prevention), Acoustic, facade engineers, building physics, Telecomms,     AV (Audio Visual), BMS (Building Management Systems) Automatic controls etc. These design Engineers also prepare construction documents which are issued to specialist contractors to obtain a price for the works and to follow for the installations.
* [[Landscape architect]]s;
* [[Interior design]]ers;
* Other consultants;
* [[General contractor|Contractor]]s who provide [[construction]] services and install building systems such as [[HVAC|climate control]], [[Electrician|electrical]], [[plumbing]], [[Painter and decorator|decoration]], [[fire protection]], [[security]] and [[telecommunications]];
* Marketing or [[leasing]] agents;

Regardless of their size or intended use, all buildings in the US must comply with [[zoning ordinance]]s, [[building code]]s and other regulations such as [[fire code]]s, [[life safety code]]s and related standards.

Vehicles—such as [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailers]], [[Travel trailer|caravans]], [[ship]]s and passenger [[aircraft]]—are treated as &quot;buildings&quot; for life safety purposes.

Any building requires a certain general amount of internal infrastructure to function, which includes such elements like heating / cooling, power and telecommunications, water and wastewater etc. Especially in [[commercial building]]s (such as offices or factories), these can be extremely intricate systems taking up large amounts of space (sometimes located in separate areas or double floors / false ceilings) and constitute a big part of the regular maintenance required.

=== Conveying systems ===

Systems for [[transport]] of people within buildings:

* [[Elevator]]
* [[Escalator]]
* [[Moving sidewalk]] (horizontal and inclined)

Systems for transport of people between interconnected buildings:

* [[Skyway]]
* [[Underground city]]

The '''McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet''' is a [[twinjet|twin-engine]], [[supersonic aircraft|supersonic]], all-weather, [[carrier-based aircraft|carrier]]-capable, [[Multirole combat aircraft|multirole combat]] jet, designed as both a [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] and [[attack aircraft]] (hence the F/A [[1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system|designation]]). Designed by [[McDonnell Douglas]] (now part of [[Boeing]]) and [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]] (now part of [[Northrop Grumman]]), the F/A-18 was derived from the latter's [[YF-17]] in the 1970s for use by the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]]. The Hornet is also used by the air forces of several other nations, and since 1986, by the U.S. Navy's Flight Demonstration Squadron, the [[Blue Angels]].

The F/A-18 was designed to be a highly versatile aircraft due to its avionics, cockpit displays, and excellent aerodynamic characteristics, with the ability to carry a wide variety of weapons. The aircraft can perform [[escort fighter|fighter escort]], fleet [[air defense]], [[suppression of enemy air defenses]], [[air interdiction]], [[close air support]], and [[aerial reconnaissance]]. Its versatility and reliability have proven it to be a valuable carrier asset, though it has been criticized for its lack of range and payload compared to its earlier contemporaries, such as the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]] in the fighter and [[strike fighter]] role, and the [[Grumman A-6 Intruder]] and [[LTV A-7 Corsair II]] in the attack role.

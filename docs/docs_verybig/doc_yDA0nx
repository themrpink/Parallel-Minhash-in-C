==Overview==

===Distribution===
The natural distribution of these species within the Americas is geographically distinct. ''S. mahagoni'' grows on the West Indian islands as far north as the Bahamas, the Florida Keys and parts of Florida; ''S. humilis'' grows in the dry regions of the Pacific coast of Central America from south-western Mexico to Costa Rica; ''S. macrophylla'' grows in Central America from Yucatan southwards and into South America, extending as far as Peru, Bolivia and extreme western Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Lydia White &amp; Peter Gasson, ''Mahogany'' (2008), pp. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century various botanists attempted to further define ''S. macrophylla'' in South America as a new species, such as ''S. candollei'' Pittier and ''S. tessmannii'' Harms., but many authorities consider these spurious. According to Record and Hess, all of the mahogany of continental North and South America can be considered as one botanical species, ''Swietenia macrophylla'' King.&lt;ref&gt;Record &amp; Hess, Timbers of the New World (1972), p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The name ''mahogany'' was initially associated only with those islands in the West Indies under British control (French colonists used the term ''acajou'', while in the Spanish territories it was called ''caoba''). The origin of the name is uncertain, but it could be a corruption of 'm'oganwo', the name used by the Yoruba and Ibo people of West Africa to describe trees of the genus ''[[Khaya]]'', which is closely related to ''Swietenia''. When transported to [[Jamaica]] as slaves, they gave the same name to the similar trees they saw there.&lt;ref&gt;F. Bruce Lamb, 'On Further defining Mahogany', ''Economic Botany'', 17 (1963), pp. 217-239.&lt;/ref&gt; Though this interpretation has been disputed, no one has suggested a more plausible origin.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp Malone, 'Notes on the Word Mahogany', ''Economic Botany'', 19 (1965), pp. 286-292.&lt;/ref&gt; The indigenous [[Arawak]] name for the tree is not known. In 1671 the word mahogany appeared in print for the first time, in [[John Ogilby]]'s ''America''.&lt;ref&gt;John Ogilby, ''America, Being the Latest and Most Accurate Description of the New World'', London (1971).&lt;/ref&gt; Among botanists and naturalists, however, the tree was considered a type of cedar, and in 1759 was classified by [[Carl Linnaeus]] (1707–1778) as ''Cedrela mahagoni''. The following year it was assigned to a new genus by Nicholas Joseph Jacquin (1727–1817), and named ''Swietenia mahagoni''.

Until the 19th century all of the mahogany was regarded as one species, although varying in quality and character according to soil and climate. In 1836 the German botanist [[Joseph Gerhard Zuccarini]] (1797–1848) identified a second species while working on specimens collected on the Pacific coast of Mexico, and named it ''Swietenia humilis''. In 1886 a third species, ''Swietenia macrophylla'', was named by [[Sir George King]] (1840–1909) after studying specimens of Honduras mahogany planted in the Botanic Gardens in Calcutta, India. Today, all species of ''[[Swietenia]]'' grown in their native locations are listed by [[CITES]], and are therefore protected. Both ''Swietenia mahagoni'', and ''Swietenia macrophylla'' were introduced into several Asian countries at the time of the restrictions imposed on American mahogany in the late 1990s and both are now successfully grown and harvested in plantations in those countries. A small percentage of global supply of genuine mahogany comes from these Asian plantations, notably from [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Indonesia]] and from [[Fiji]], in Oceania. For ''Swietenia macrophylla'', the trees in these plantations are still relatively young compared to the trees being harvested from old growth forests in South America. Thus, the illegal trade of bigleaf mahogany continues apace.&lt;ref name=&quot;rfrelief&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rainforestrelief.org/What_to_Avoid_and_Alternatives/Rainforest_Wood/What_to_Avoid_What_to_Choose/By_Tree_Species/Tropical_Woods/M/Mahogany.html |title=What to Avoid/What to Choose - Mahogany (Sweitenia sp., Khaya sp.) |access-date=2018-11-22 |website=Rainforest Relief}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Species===
Species of ''Swietenia'' cross-breed readily when they grow in proximity; the hybrid between ''S. mahagoni'' and ''S. macrophylla'' is widely planted for its timber.

In addition, the U.S. timber trade also markets various other [[Federal Trade Commission]]-defined species as ''mahoganies'' under a variety of different commercial names, most notably ''[[Shorea|Philippine mahogany]]'', which is actually from the genus ''[[Shorea]]'', a [[dipterocarp]]. This wood is also called ''[[Shorea|Lauan]]'' or ''[[Shorea|Meranti]]''.

==History of American mahogany trade==
[[File:Squaring mahogany.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Mahogany loggers in Belize, around 1930]]

In the 17th century, the buccaneer [[John Esquemeling]] recorded the use of mahogany or cedrela on [[Hispaniola]] for making canoes: &quot;The Indians make these canoes without the use of any iron instruments, by only burning the trees at the bottom near the root, and afterwards governing the fire with such industry that nothing is burnt more than what they would have...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Esquemeling, ''The Buccanneers of America'', translated from the Dutch 1684, reprinted London (1893), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The wood first came to the notice of Europeans with the beginning of Spanish colonisation in the Americas. A cross in the Cathedral at [[Santo Domingo]], bearing the date 1514, is said to be mahogany, and Phillip II of Spain apparently used the wood for the interior joinery of the Escorial Palace, begun in 1584.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Latham, ''Timber, Its Development and Distribution'', London (1957), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''caoba'', as the Spanish called the wood, was principally reserved for ship building, and it was declared a royal monopoly at Havana in 1622. Hence very little of the mahogany growing in Spanish controlled territory found its way to Europe.

After the French established a colony in [[Saint Domingue]] (now [[Haiti]]), some mahogany from that island probably found its way to France, where joiners in the port cities of Saint-Malo, Nantes, La Rochelle and Bordeaux used the wood to a limited extent from about 1700.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Viaux-Locquin, ''Les bois d'ebenisterie dans le mobilier francais'', Paris (1997), pp. 2-10.&lt;/ref&gt; On the English-controlled islands, especially [[Jamaica]] and the [[Bahamas]], mahogany was abundant but not exported in any quantity before 1700.

===18th century===
While the trade in mahogany from the Spanish and French territories in America remained moribund for most of the 18th century, this was not true for those islands under British control. In 1721 the British Parliament removed all import duties from timber imported into Britain from British possessions in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;This was the Act of 8 George I cap. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; This immediately stimulated the trade in West Indian timbers including, most importantly,  mahogany. Importations of mahogany into England (and excluding those to Scotland, which were recorded separately) reached 525 tons per annum by 1740, 3,688 tons by 1750, and more than 30,000 tons in 1788, the peak year of the 18th century trade.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Bowett, 'The 1721 Naval Stores Act and the Commercial Introduction of Mahogany', ''Furniture History'', XXX (1994), pp. 42-56; Adam Bowett, ''The English Mahogany Trade 1700-1793'', unpublished PhD thesis, Brunel University (1997); The National Archives (United Kingdom), Cust. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the 1721 Act had the effect of substantially increasing exports of mahogany from the West Indies to the British colonies in North America. Although initially regarded as a joinery wood, mahogany rapidly became the timber of choice for makers of high quality furniture in both the British Isles and the 13 colonies of North America.
[[File:Mahagoni Tree.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mahogany tree at Kannavam Forest, [[Kerala]], India]]

Until the 1760s over 90 per cent of the mahogany imported into Britain came from Jamaica.&lt;ref&gt;The National Archives (United Kingdom), Cust. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this was re-exported to continental Europe, but most was used by British furniture makers. Quantities of Jamaican mahogany also went to the North American colonies, but most of the wood used in American furniture came from the [[Bahamas]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowett (1997); The National Archives (United Kingdom), Shipping Returns, CO 142 (Jamaica); CO 27 (Bahamas).&lt;/ref&gt; This was sometimes called Providence wood, after the main port of the islands, but more often ''madera'' or ''maderah'', which was the Bahamian name for mahogany.&lt;ref&gt;Brad Rauschenberg, 'Timber Available in Charleston, 1660-1820', ''Journal of the Museum of Early Southern Decorative Arts'', XX, No. 2; Bowett (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Jamaica and Bahamas, all the British controlled islands exported some mahogany at various times, but the quantities were not large. The most significant third source was Black River and adjacent areas on the [[Mosquito Coast]] (now [[Republic of Honduras]]), from where quantities of mahogany were shipped from the 1740s onwards. This mahogany was known as 'Rattan mahogany', after the island of [[Ruatan]], which was the main offshore [[entrepot]] for the British settlers in the area.

At the end of the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–63), the mahogany trade began to change significantly. During the occupation of [[Havana]] by British forces between August 1762 and July 1763, quantities of Cuban or Havanna mahogany were sent to Britain, and after the city was restored to Spain in 1763, Cuba continued to export small quantities, mostly to ports on the north coast of Jamaica, from where it went to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;The National Archives (United Kingdom), Cust 3; Shipping returns, CO 142 (Jamaica).&lt;/ref&gt; However, this mahogany was regarded as inferior to the Jamaican variety, and the trade remained sporadic until the 19th century.

Another variety new to the market was Hispaniola mahogany, also called 'Spanish' and 'St Domingo' mahogany. This was the result of the 1766 Free Ports Act, which opened Kingston and other designated Jamaican ports to foreign vessels for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;This was the Act of 6 George III cap. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The object was primarily to encourage importations of cotton from French plantations in [[Saint Domingue]], but quantities of high quality mahogany were also shipped. These were then forwarded to Britain, where they entered the market in the late 1760s.

[[File:Toona calantas (Philippine mahogany) seeds - 7.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.3|Mahogany fruit and seeds]]

In terms of quantity, the most significant new addition to the mahogany trade was Honduras mahogany, also called 'baywood', after the Bay of Honduras. British settlers had been active in southern [[Yucatan]] since the beginning of the 18th century, despite the opposition of the Spanish, who claimed sovereignty over all of Central America.

Their main occupation was cutting [[logwood]], a dyewood in high demand in Europe. The center of their activity and the primary point of export was [[Belize]]. Under Article XVII of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]], British cutters were for the first time given the right to cut logwood in Yucatan unmolested, within agreed limits. Such was the enthusiasm of the cutters that within a few years the European market was glutted, and the price of logwood collapsed.

However, the price of mahogany was still high after the war, and so the cutters turned to cutting mahogany. The first Honduras mahogany arrived in Kingston, Jamaica, in November 1763, and the first shipments arrived in Britain the following year.&lt;ref&gt;The National Archives (United Kingdom), Shipping register, CO 142 (Jamaica); Cust 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1790s most of the viable stocks of mahogany in Jamaica had been cut, and the market was divided between two principal sources or types of mahogany. Honduras mahogany was relatively cheap, plentiful, but rarely of the best quality. Hispaniola (also called Spanish or Santo Domingo) mahogany was the wood of choice for high quality work.

Data are lacking, but it is likely that the newly independent United States now received a good proportion of its mahogany from Cuba. In the last quarter of the 18th century France began to use mahogany more widely;&lt;ref&gt;Viaux-Locquin (1997), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; they had ample supplies of high quality wood from Saint Domingue. The rest of Europe, where the wood was increasingly fashionable, obtained most of their wood from Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;The National Archives (United Kingdom), Cust 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent history===
The [[French Revolution]] of 1789 and the wars that followed radically changed the mahogany trade, primarily due to the progressive collapse of the French and Spanish colonial empires, which allowed British traders into areas previously closed to them. [[Saint Domingue]] became the independent republic of Haiti, and from 1808, Spanish controlled Santo Domingo and Cuba were both open to British vessels for the first time.

From the 1820s mahogany from all these areas was imported into Europe and North America, with the lion's share going to Britain. In Central America British loggers moved northwest towards Mexico and south into Guatemala. Other areas of Central America as far south as Panama also began to be exploited.

The most important new development was the beginning of large scale logging in Mexico from the 1860s. Most mahogany was cut in the province of [[Tabasco]] and exported from a number of ports on the [[Gulf of Campeche]], from Vera Cruz eastwards to Campeche and Sisal.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Laslett, Timber and Timber Trees, London (1875), p.178&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 19th century there was scarcely any part of Central America within reach of the coast untouched by logging, and activity also extended into Colombia, Venezuela, Peru and Brazil.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

Trade in American mahogany probably reached a peak in the last quarter of the 19th century. Figures are not available for all countries, but Britain alone imported more than 80,000 tons in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;The National Archives (United Kingdom), Cust. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This figure was not matched again. From the 1880s, African mahogany (''[[Khaya]]'' spp.), a related genus, began to be exported in increasing quantities from West Africa, and by the early 20th century it dominated the market.

In 1907 the total of mahogany from all sources imported into Europe was 159,830 tons, of which 121,743 tons were from West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Baterden, ''Timber'', London (1908), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; By this time mahogany from Cuba, Haiti and other West Indian sources had become increasingly difficult to obtain in commercial sizes, and by the late 20th century Central American and even South American mahogany was heading in a similar direction. In 1975 ''S. humilis'' was placed on [[CITES Appendix II]] followed by ''S. mahagoni'' in 1992. The most abundant species, ''S. macrophylla'', was placed on Appendix III in 1995 and moved to Appendix II in 2003.

==Uses==
Mahogany has a straight, fine, and even grain, and is relatively free of voids and pockets. Its reddish-brown color darkens over time, and displays a reddish sheen when polished. It has excellent workability, and is very durable.  Historically, the tree's girth allowed for wide boards from traditional mahogany species.  These properties make it a favorable wood for crafting cabinets and furniture.

Much of the first-quality furniture made in the American colonies from the mid 18th century was made of mahogany, when the wood first became available to American craftsmen. Mahogany is still widely used for fine furniture; however, the rarity of [[Cuba]]n mahogany, the over-harvesting of [[Honduras]] and [[Brazil]]ian mahogany, and the protests by indigenous peoples and environmental organizations from the 1980s into the 2000s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mahogany is Murder: Mahogany Extraction from Indian Reserves in Brazil |author=George Monbiot |year=1992 |publisher=Friends of the Earth |isbn=978-1-8575-0160-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/greenpeace-curbs-mahogany-logging-brazil-1999-2004 |title=Greenpeace Curbs Mahogany Logging in Brazil, 1999-2004 |access-date=2018-11-22 |website=Global Nonviolent Action Database |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181122164606/https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/greenpeace-curbs-mahogany-logging-brazil-1999-2004 |archive-date=2018-11-22 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rfrelief&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/wp-content/uploads/legacy/Global/usa/report/2010/2/partners-in-mahogany-crime.pdf |title=Partners in mahogany crime |work=Greenpeace }}&lt;/ref&gt; have diminished their use. Recent mahogany production from Mexico and Fiji has a lighter color and density than South American production from the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.commercialforestproducts.com/what-happened-to-the-good-mahogany/&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahogany also resists wood rot, making it attractive in boat construction and outdoor decking. It is a [[tonewood]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guitarnation.com/articles/koa.htm |title=Koa: Beautiful Looking, Beautiful Sounding Tonewood |first=Norman L. |last=Beberman |publisher=GuitarNation.com |accessdate=2009-02-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207020423/http://www.guitarnation.com/articles/koa.htm |archivedate=2009-02-07 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; often used for musical instruments, particularly the backs, sides and necks of acoustic guitars, electric guitar bodies,&lt;ref&gt;http://gaskellguitars.com/tonewoods-used-to-make-guitars/{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and drum shells because of its ability to produce a very deep, warm tone compared to other commonly used woods, such as [[maple]] or [[birch]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruck2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Matt Bruck|title=Guitar World Presents Guitar Gear 411|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EcerNc4EC_UC&amp;pg=PA6|year=2005|publisher=Alfred Music Publishing|isbn=978-0-7579-4061-3|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hirst2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Hirst|title=Electric Guitar Construction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fV1hFdkEHVkC&amp;pg=PA11|year=2003|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=978-1-57424-125-9|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guitars featuring mahogany in their construction include select [[C.

Martin &amp; Company|Martin Guitars]] such as the D-18, select [[Taylor Guitars]], select [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson Guitars]] such as the Les Paul, SG and J45 and select [[Hagström]] guitars. In the 1930s Gibson used the wood to make banjo necks as well, the RB, TB and PB style 3s and RB, TB and PB style 75s were most commonly fitted with mahogany necks.

==Mahogany as an invasive species==
In the Philippines, environmentalists are calling for an end to the planting of mahogany because of its negative impact on the environment and wildlife, including possibly causing soil acidification and no net benefit to wildlife.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pinol2016&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author1=Agustin A.

'''Danielle Jane Minogue''' (born 20 October 1971) is an Australian singer, songwriter, actress, and television personality. She rose to prominence for her roles on the Australian television talent show ''[[Young Talent Time]]'' (1982-1988) and on the soap opera ''[[Home and Away]]'' (1989-1990), before beginning her career as a pop singer in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;officialbio&quot;&gt;[http://www.danniimusic.com/success.html &quot;Success: Biography&quot;]. DanniiMusic.com. Retrieved 16 November 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413123152/http://www.danniimusic.com/success.html |date=13 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Minogue achieved early success with her debut studio album, [[Love and Kisses (album)|''Love and Kisses'']] (1991), which respectively produced the hits &quot;[[Love and Kisses (song)|Love and Kisses]]&quot;, &quot;[[This Is It (Melba Moore song)|This Is It]]&quot;, &quot;[[Jump to the Beat]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Success (song)|Success]]&quot;. Following the release of her second studio album, ''[[Get into You]]'' (1993), Minogue’s popularity as a singer had declined, leading her to make a name for herself with award-winning performances in the musicals [[Grease (musical)|''Grease'']] (1997) and [[Notre-Dame de Paris (musical)|''Notre-Dame de Paris'']] (1999), and other acting credits ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'' and ''[[Lady Macbeth]]'' (both 2000).

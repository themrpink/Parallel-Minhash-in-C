The '''Uffizi Gallery''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|juː|ˈ|f|ɪ|t|s|i|,_|ʊ|ˈ|f|iː|t|s|i}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/uffizi|title=Uffizi|work=[[Collins English Dictionary]]|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|access-date=10 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Oxford Dictionaries|Uffizi|accessdate=10 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-it|'''Galleria degli Uffizi'''|italic=no}}, {{IPA-it|ɡalleˈriːa deʎʎ ufˈfittsi|pron}}) is a prominent [[art museum]] located adjacent to the [[Piazza della Signoria]] in the [[Historic Centre of Florence]] in the region of [[Tuscany]], Italy. One of the most important Italian museums and the most visited, it is also one of the largest and best known in the world and holds a collection of priceless works, particularly from the period of the [[Italian Renaissance painting|Italian Renaissance.]]

After the ruling [[house of Medici]] died out, their art collections were gifted to the city of Florence under the famous ''Patto di famiglia'' negotiated by [[Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici|Anna Maria Luisa]], the last Medici heiress.  The Uffizi is one of the first modern museums. The gallery had been open to visitors by request since the sixteenth century, and in 1765 it was officially opened to the public, formally becoming a museum in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.florence-museum.com/uffizi-gallery-tickets.php|title=Uffizi Gallery Tickets – Museums Tickets Florence Uffizi Gallery|website=www.florence-museum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the Uffizi is one of the most popular [[tourist attraction]]s of Florence and one of the most visited art museums in the world, with 4,391,861 visitors in 2019.&lt;ref name=&quot;beniculturali.it&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=MUSEI, TOP 30: COLOSSEO, UFFIZI E POMPEI SUPERSTAR NEL 2019 Franceschini: autonomia funziona, andiamo avanti su percorso innovazione |url=https://www.beniculturali.it/mibac/export/MiBAC/sito-MiBAC/Contenuti/visualizza_asset.html_1000300163.html |website=www.beniculturali.it |access-date=3 July 2020 |language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beniculturali.it/mibac/export/MiBAC/sito-MiBAC/Contenuti/visualizza_asset.html_2128864006.html|title=L'Esperienza dei primi diretorri dei musei autonom|date=13 November 2017|website=www.beniculturali.it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Uffizi Gallery - Michelangelo painting &quot;Tondo Doni&quot;.JPG|thumbnail|Visitors observing [[Michelangelo]] painting ''[[Doni Tondo]]''. Uffizi is ranked as the 25th on the [[list of most visited art museums in the world|most visited art museums in the world]], with around 2 million visitors annually.]]
The building of the Uffizi complex was begun by [[Giorgio Vasari]] in 1560 for [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de' Medici]] so as to accommodate the offices of the Florentine magistrates, hence the name {{lang|it|uffizi}}, &quot;offices&quot;. The construction was later continued by [[Alfonso Parigi the Elder|Alfonso Parigi]] and [[Bernardo Buontalenti]]; it was completed in 1581. The top floor was made into a gallery for the family and their guests and included their collection of Roman sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uffizi.com/history-uffizi-gallery.asp| title=History of Uffizi Gallery| website=www.uffizi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''cortile'' (internal courtyard) is so long, narrow and open to the [[Arno]] at its far end through a [[Doric order|Doric screen]] that articulates the space without blocking it, that architectural historians&lt;ref&gt;[[Sigfried Giedion]], ''Space, Time and Architecture'' (1941) 1962 fig.17.&lt;/ref&gt; treat it as the first regularized streetscape of Europe. Vasari, a painter and architect as well, emphasised its [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] length by adorning it with the matching facades' continuous roof cornices, and unbroken cornices between storeys, as well as the three continuous steps on which the palace-fronts stand. The niches in the piers that alternate with columns of the [[Loggiato degli Uffizi|Loggiato]]  filled with sculptures of famous artists in the 19th century.

[[File:Statues in Niches Outside the Uffizi Gallery, Florence.jpg|thumb|[[Cosimo de' Medici]] by Luigi Magi and ''Andrea Di Cione'' ([[Orcagna]]) by Niccolò Bazzanti]]

The Uffizi brought together under one roof the administrative offices and the Archivio di Stato, the state archive. The project was intended to display prime art works of the Medici collections on the [[piano nobile]]; the plan was carried out by his son, Grand Duke [[Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Francesco I]]. He commissioned the architect Buontalenti to design the [[Tribuna of the Uffizi|Tribuna degli Uffizi]] that would display a series of masterpieces in one room, including jewels; it became a highly influential attraction of a [[Grand Tour]]. The octagonal room was completed in 1584.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.virtualuffizi.com/tribune.html|title=Tribuna :: Hall n. 18 ► Virtual Uffizi|website=Virtual Uffizi Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, more sections of the palace were recruited to exhibit paintings and sculpture collected or commissioned by the [[House of Medici|Medici]]. 
For many years, 45 to 50 rooms were used to display paintings from the 13th to 18th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;florence-museum.com&quot;/&gt;

==Modern times==
Because of its huge collection, some of the Uffizi's works have in the past been transferred to other museums in Florence—for example, some famous [[statue]]s to the [[Bargello]]. A project was finished in 2006 to expand the museum's exhibition space some 6,000 metres&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (64,000&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) to almost 13,000 metres&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (139,000&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), allowing public viewing of many [[Work of art|artwork]]s that had usually been in storage.  

The Nuovi Uffizi (New Uffizi) renovation project which started in 1989 was progressing well in 2015 to 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.virtualuffizi.com/new-halls.html|title=Discover the New Halls at Uffizi| website=Virtual Uffizi Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended to modernize all of the halls and more than double the display space. As well, a new exit was planned and the lighting, air conditioning and security systems were updated. During construction, the museum remained open, although rooms were closed as necessary with the artwork temporarily moved to another location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uffizi.org/museum/history/|title=History| website=Uffizi Gallery| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704205233/http://www.uffizi.org/museum/history/|archive-date=2015-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Botticelli rooms and two others with early Renaissance paintings were closed for 15 months but reopened in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uffizi.org/2383-the-botticelli-rooms-reopen/| title=New Uffizi: The Botticelli &amp; Early Renaissance Rooms Reopen| date=19 October 2016| publisher=Uffizi Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major modernization project, New Uffizi, had increased viewing capacity to 101 rooms by late 2016 by expanding into areas previously used by the Florence State Archive.&lt;ref name=&quot;uffizi.org&quot;/&gt;

The Uffizi hosted over two million visitors in 2016, making it the most visited art gallery in Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;beniculturali.it&quot;/&gt; In high season (particularly in July), waiting times can be up to five hours. Tickets are available on-line in advance, however, to significantly reduce the waiting time.&lt;ref name=&quot;florence-museum.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.florence-museum.com/uffizi-gallery-tickets.php?gclid=Cj0KEQjwkN3KBRCu2fWmy9LLqN4BEiQANP9-WiEJRersqPn3481j_HwsmJ4uOR1qBGGtITSC0uYlxJYaAlsT8P8HAQ|title=Uffizi Gallery Tickets – Museums Tickets Florence Uffizi Gallery|website=www.florence-museum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new ticketing system is currently being tested to reduce queuing times from hours to just minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;traveller.com.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traveller.com.au/uffizi-gallery-florence-queuing-times-cut-from-hours-to-minutes-with-new-system-h16fkx|title=Uffizi gallery, Florence: Queuing times cut from hours to minutes with new system|first=Nick|last=Squires|date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is being renovated to more than double the number of rooms used to display artwork.&lt;ref name=&quot;uffizi.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uffizi.org/2383-the-botticelli-rooms-reopen/|title=New Uffizi: The Botticelli &amp; Early Renaissance Rooms Reopen|date=19 October 2016|publisher=Uffizi Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents==
On 27 May 1993, the [[Sicilian Mafia]] carried out a [[car bomb]] explosion in [[Massacre of via dei Georgofili|Via dei Georgofili]] and damaged parts of the palace, killing five people. The blast destroyed five pieces of art and damaged another 30. Some of the paintings were fully protected by bulletproof glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/28/world/bomb-outside-uffizi-in-florence-kills-6-and-damages-many-works.html| title=Bomb Outside Uffizi in Florence Kills 6 and Damages Many Works| first=Alan| last=Cowell| date=28 May 1993| newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most severe damage was to the [[Niobe]] room and classical sculptures and [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] interior (which have since been restored), although its [[fresco]]es were damaged beyond repair.

In early August 2007, Florence experienced a heavy rainstorm. The Gallery was partially flooded, with water leaking through the ceiling, and the visitors had to be evacuated. There was a much more significant [[1966 Flood of the Arno River|flood in 1966]] which damaged most of the art collections in Florence severely, including some of the works in the Uffizi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/why-florence-still-lives-in-fear-of-the-flood-1350491.html| title=Why Florence still lives in fear of the flood| date=3 November 1996| work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vista aerea del Monasterio de El Escorial.jpg|thumb|300px|Royal Monastery of San Lorenzo de [[El Escorial]], [[Spain]]. Built in 1563–1584.]]
[[File:160211 Higashi Honganji Kyoto Japan06s3.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Higashi Hongan-ji|Hongan monastery]] in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]].]]

A '''monastery''' is 
a building or complex of buildings comprising the domestic quarters and workplaces of [[Monasticism|monastics]], [[monk]]s or [[nun]]s, whether living in [[Cenobitic monasticism|communities]] or alone ([[hermits]]). A monastery generally includes a place reserved for prayer which may be a chapel, [[Church (building)|church]], or temple, and may also serve as an [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]], or in the case of [[Cenobium|communities]] anything from a single building housing only one senior and two or three junior monks or nuns, to vast complexes and estates housing tens or hundreds. A monastery complex typically comprises a number of buildings which include a church, [[dormitory]], [[cloister]], [[refectory]], [[library]], [[Wiktionary:balneary|balneary]] and [[Hospital|infirmary]]. Depending on the location, the monastic order and the occupation of its inhabitants, the complex may also include a wide range of buildings that facilitate self-sufficiency and service to the community. These may include a [[hospice]], a [[school]], and a range of agricultural and manufacturing buildings such as a [[barn]], a [[forge]], or a [[brewery]].

In English usage, the term ''monastery'' is generally used to denote the buildings of a community of monks. In modern usage, ''[[convent]]'' tends to be applied only to institutions of female monastics (nuns), particularly communities of teaching or nursing [[Nun|religious sisters]]. Historically, a convent denoted a house of [[friar]]s (reflecting the Latin), now more commonly called a ''friary''. Various religions may apply these terms in more specific ways.

== Etymology ==
[[File:St gall plan.jpg|thumb|The [[Plan of Saint Gall]], the [[ground plan]] of an unbuilt abbey, providing for all of the needs of the monks within the confines of the monastery walls]]
The word ''monastery'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''μοναστήριον'', neut. of ''μοναστήριος'' – ''monasterios'' from ''μονάζειν'' – ''monazein'' &quot;to live alone&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=monastery&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; from the root ''μόνος'' – ''monos'' &quot;alone&quot; (originally all Christian monks were hermits); the suffix &quot;-terion&quot; denotes a &quot;place for doing something&quot;. The earliest extant use of the term ''monastērion'' is by the 1st century AD [[Jew]]ish philosopher [[Philo]] in ''On The Contemplative Life,'' ch. III.

In England, the word ''monastery'' was also applied to the habitation of a [[bishop]] and the [[cathedral]] [[clergy]] who lived apart from the lay community. Most cathedrals were not monasteries, and were served by [[Canon (priest)|canons secular]], which were communal but not monastic. However, some were run by monasteries orders, such as [[York Minster]]. [[Westminster Abbey]] was for a short time a cathedral, and was a [[Benedictine]] monastery until the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], and its [[Chapter (religion)|Chapter]] preserves elements of the Benedictine tradition. See the entry [[cathedral]]. They are also to be distinguished from collegiate churches, such as [[St George's Chapel, Windsor]].

===Terms===
The term ''monastery'' is used generically to refer to any of a number of types of religious community. In the [[Roman Catholic]] religion and to some extent in certain branches of [[Buddhism]], there is a somewhat more specific definition of the term and many related terms.

[[Buddhist]] monasteries are generally called '''[[vihara]]''' ([[Pali]] language). Viharas may be occupied by men or women, and in keeping with common English usage, a vihara populated by females may often be called a nunnery or a convent. However, vihara can also refer to a [[temple]]. In Tibetan Buddhism, monasteries are often called '''[[gompa]]'''. In [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]] and [[Thailand]], a monastery is called a ''[[wat]]''. In [[Burma]], a monastery is called a ''[[kyaung]]''.

A Christian monastery may be an '''[[abbey]]''' (i.e., under the rule of an [[abbot]]), or a '''[[priory]]''' (under the rule of a [[prior]]), or conceivably a '''[[Hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]]''' (the dwelling of a [[hermit]]). It may be a community of men ([[monk]]s) or of women ([[nun]]s). A [[Charterhouse (monastery)|charterhouse]] is any monastery belonging to the [[Carthusian]] order. In [[Eastern Christianity]], a very small monastic community can be called a '''[[skete]]''', and a very large or important monastery can be given the dignity of a '''[[lavra]]'''.

The great communal life of a Christian monastery is called [[cenobitic]], as opposed to the [[anchorite|anchoretic]] (or anchoritic) life of an [[anchorite]] and the [[eremitical|eremitic]] life of a [[hermit]]. There has also been, mostly under the [[Osmanli]] occupation of Greece and Cyprus, an &quot;idiorrhythmic&quot; lifestyle where monks come together but being able to own things individually and not being obliged to work for the common good.

In [[Hinduism]] monasteries are called [[matha]], [[mandir]], [[koil]], or most commonly an [[ashram]].

[[Jainism|Jains]] use the Buddhist term [[vihara]].

==Monastic life==
In most religions, the life inside monasteries is governed by community rules that stipulate the gender of the inhabitants and require them to remain [[Celibacy|celibate]] and own little or no personal property. The degree to which life inside a particular monastery is socially separate from the surrounding populace can also vary widely; some religious traditions mandate isolation for purposes of contemplation removed from the everyday world, in which case members of the monastic community may spend most of their time isolated even from each other. Others focus on interacting with the local communities to provide services, such as teaching, medical care, or [[evangelism]]. Some monastic communities are only occupied seasonally, depending both on the traditions involved and the local weather, and people may be part of a monastic community for periods ranging from a few days at a time to almost an entire lifetime.

The life within the walls of a monastery may be supported in several ways: by manufacturing and selling goods, often [[agricultural]] products, by donations or [[alms]], by rental or investment incomes, and by funds from other organizations within the religion, which in the past formed the traditional support of monasteries. There has been a long tradition of Christian monasteries providing hospitable, charitable and hospital services. Monasteries have often been associated with the provision of education and the encouragement of scholarship and research, which has led to the establishment of schools and colleges and the association with universities. Christian monastic life has adapted to modern society by offering computer services, [[accounting]] services and management as well as modern hospital and educational administration.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Buddhist monasteries, known as '''[[vihara|vihāra]]''' in [[Pali]] and in [[Sanskrit]], emerged sometime around the fourth century BCE from the practice of [[vassa]], a retreat undertaken by Buddhist monastics during the South Asian [[wet season]]. To prevent wandering [[bhikkhu|monks]] and [[bhikkhuni|nuns]] from disturbing new plant-growth or becoming stranded in inclement weather, they were instructed to remain in a fixed location for the roughly three-month period typically beginning in mid-July.

These early fixed ''vassa'' retreats took place in pavilions and parks that wealthy supporters had donated to the [[sangha]]. Over the years, the custom of staying on property held in common by the ''sangha'' as a whole during the ''vassa'' retreat evolved into [[cenobitic monasticism]], in which monks and nuns resided year-round in monasteries.

In [[Buddhism in India| India]], Buddhist monasteries gradually developed into centres of learning where philosophical principles were developed and debated; this tradition continues in the monastic universities of [[Vajrayana| Vajrayana Buddhists]], as well as in religious schools and universities founded by religious orders across the Buddhist world. In modern times, living a settled life in a monastery setting has become{{when?|date=September 2020}} the most common lifestyle for Buddhist monks and nuns across the globe.

Whereas early monasteries are considered{{by whom?|date=September 2020}} to have been held in common by the entire sangha, in later years this tradition diverged in a number of countries. Despite ''[[vinaya]]'' prohibitions on possessing wealth, many monasteries became large landowners, much like monasteries in medieval Christian Europe. In [[Chinese Buddhism]], peasant families worked monastic-owned land in exchange for paying a portion of their yearly crop to the resident monks in the monastery, just as they would to a [[feudal]] landlord. In [[Buddhism in Sri Lanka| Sri&amp;nbsp;Lanka]] and in [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the ownership of a monastery often became vested in a single monk, who would often keep the property within the family by passing it on to a nephew ordained as a monk. In [[Buddhism in Japan| Japan]], where civil authorities permitted Buddhist monks to marry, the position of head of a temple or monastery sometimes became hereditary, passed from father to son over many generations.

Forest monasteries – most commonly found in the [[Theravada]] traditions of Southeast Asia and Sri&amp;nbsp;Lanka – are monasteries dedicated primarily to the study of Buddhist [[meditation]], rather than to scholarship or ceremonial duties. Forest monasteries often function like early Christian monasteries, with small groups of monks living an essentially hermit-like life gathered loosely around a respected elder teacher. While the wandering lifestyle practised by [[Gautama Buddha | the Buddha]] and by his disciples continues to be the ideal model for forest-tradition monks in [[Thailand]] and elsewhere, practical concerns - including shrinking wilderness areas, lack of access to lay supporters, dangerous wildlife, and dangerous border conflicts - dictate that increasing numbers of &quot;meditation&quot; monks live in monasteries, rather than wandering.

Tibetan Buddhist monasteries or [[gompa]]s are sometimes known as '''lamaseries''', with their monks sometimes (mistakenly) known as [[lama]]s. [[Helena Blavatsky]]'s [[Theosophical Society]] named its initial New York City meeting-place &quot;the Lamasery&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Crowley, John|title= Madame and the Masters: Blavatsky's cosmic soap opera |work= Harper's |date= February 2013 |page= 84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to tradition, [[Christian monasticism]] began in [[Egypt]] with [[Anthony the Great]]. Originally, all Christian monks were [[hermit]]s seldom encountering other people.

A transitional form of monasticism was later created by [[Saint Amun]] in which &quot;solitary&quot; monks lived close enough to one another to offer mutual support as well as gathering together on Sundays for common services.

It was [[Pachomius the Great]] who developed the idea of [[cenobitic monasticism]]: having renunciates live together and worship together under the same roof. Some attribute his mode of communal living to the [[barracks]] of the [[Roman Army]] in which Pachomios served as a young man.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, Marilyn. The Emergence of Monasticism: From the Desert Fathers to the Early Middle Ages. Malden, Mass.: Blackwell Publishers, 2000. p29.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the Egyptian desert blossomed with monasteries, especially around Nitria ([[Wadi El Natrun]]), which was called the &quot;Holy City&quot;. Estimates are that upwards of 50,000 monks lived in this area at any one time. Hermitism never died out though, but was reserved only for those advanced monks who had worked out their problems within a cenobitic monastery.

The idea caught on, and other places followed:
* Upon his return from the [[Council of Serdica]], [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] established [[Monastery of Saint Athanasius|the first Christian monastery in Europe]] circa 344 near modern-day [[Chirpan]] in [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liternet.bg/publish10/eshopova/manastiryt.htm|title=Манастирът в с. Златна Ливада – най-старият в Европа|publisher=LiterNet|language=Bulgarian|date=30 April 2004|accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mar Awgin]] founded a monastery on [[Mount Izla]] above [[Nusaybin]] in [[Mesopotamia]] (~350), and from this monastery the cenobitic tradition spread in Mesopotamia, [[Persia]], [[Armenia]], Georgia and even India and China.
* [[Mar Saba]] organized the monks of the [[Judaean Desert]] in a monastery close to [[Bethlehem]] (483), and this is considered the mother of all monasteries of [[Eastern Orthodoxy]].
* [[Benedict of Nursia]] founded the monastery of [[Monte Cassino]] in Italy (529), which was the seed of [[Roman Catholic]] monasticism in general, and of the [[Order of Saint Benedict]] in particular.
* The [[Carthusians]] were founded by [[Bruno of Cologne]] at the [[Grande Chartreuse]], from which the religious Order takes its name, in the eleventh century as an eremitical community, and remains the [[motherhouse]] of the Order.
* [[Jerome]] and [[Paula of Rome]] decided to go live a hermit's life in [[Bethlehem]] and founded several monasteries in the Holy Land. This way of life inspired the foundation of the [[Hieronymites]] in [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]. The [[Monastery of Santa María del Parral]] in [[Segovia]] is the [[motherhouse]] of the Order.

The life of prayer and communal living was one of rigorous schedules and self-sacrifice. Prayer was their work, and the Office prayers took up much of a monk's waking hours – [[Matins]], [[Lauds]], [[Prime (liturgy)|Prime]], [[Terce]], daily Mass, [[Sext]], [[None (liturgy)|None]], [[Vespers]], and [[Compline]]. In between prayers, monks were allowed to sit in the cloister and work on their projects of writing, copying, or decorating books. These would have been assigned based on a monk's abilities and interests. The non-scholastic types were assigned to physical labour of varying degrees.

The main meal of the day took place around noon, often taken at a [[refectory table]], and consisted of the most simple and bland foods i.e.,&amp;nbsp;poached fish, boiled oats. While they ate, scripture would be read from a pulpit above them. Since no other words were allowed to be spoken, monks developed communicative gestures. Abbots and notable guests were honoured with a seat at the high table, while everyone else sat perpendicular to that in the order of seniority. This practice remained when some monasteries became universities after the first millennium, and can still be seen at [[Oxford University]] and [[Cambridge University]].

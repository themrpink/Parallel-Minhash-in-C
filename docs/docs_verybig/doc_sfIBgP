{{Quotation| ''I write for two reasons; partly to make money and partly to win the respect of people whom I respect.''&lt;br /&gt;[[E. M.

====Teach====
[[Aristotle]], who was tutor to [[Alexander the Great]], wrote to support his [[education|teaching]]. He wrote two [[treatise]]s for the young prince: &quot;On Monarchy&quot;, and &quot;On Colonies&quot;&lt;ref name=MacLeod&gt;{{cite book|title=The Library of Alexandria|year=2000|publisher=The American University in Cairo Press|location=Cairo, Egypt|isbn=977-424-710-8|pages=79–91|author=R.G. Tanner|chapter=Aristotle's Works: The Possible Origins of the Alexandria Collection|editor=Roy MacLeod}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his [[dialogue]]s also appear to have been written either &quot;as lecture notes or discussion papers for use in his philosophy school at the Athens [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]] between 334 and 323 BC.&quot;&lt;ref name= MacLeod /&gt; They encompass both his 'scientific' writings ([[metaphysics]], [[physics]], [[biology]], [[meteorology]], and [[astronomy]], as well as [[logic]] and [[argument]]) the 'non-scientific' works (poetry, [[Public speaking|oratory]], ethics, and politics), and &quot;major elements in traditional [[Classical Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] education&quot;.&lt;ref name= MacLeod /&gt;

Writers of [[textbook]]s also use writing to teach and there are numerous instructional guides to writing itself. For example, many people will find it necessary to make a speech &quot;in the service of your company, church, civic club, political party, or other organization&quot; and so, instructional writers have produced texts and guides for speechmaking.&lt;ref name=Dowis&gt;{{cite book|last=Dowis|first=Richard|title=The Lost Art of the Great Speech: How to Write One : How to Deliver It|year=2000|publisher=AMA publications|location=New York|isbn=0-8144-7054-8|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tell a story====
Many writers use their skill to tell the story of their people, community or cultural tradition, especially one with a personal significance. Examples include [[Shmuel Yosef Agnon]]; [[Miguel Ángel Asturias]]; [[Doris Lessing]]; [[Toni Morrison]]; [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]]; and [[Patrick White]].
Writers such as [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], [[Herta Müller]], and [[Erich Maria Remarque]] write about the effect of conflict, dispossession and war.

====Seek a lover====
Writers use prose, poetry, and letters as part of courtship rituals.  [[Edmond Rostand]]'s play ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'', written in verse, is about both the power of love and the power of the self-doubting writer/hero's writing talent.

==Authorship==
[[File:Autographe de Marianne Alcoforado (Maria Anna Alcoforada), comme écrivain du couvent de Béja.jpg|thumb|Signature of [[Mariana Alcoforado]] (Maria Anna Alcoforada), once thought to be the writer of the [[Epistolary novel|epistolary fiction]], ''[[Letters of a Portuguese Nun]]''. ]]

===Pen names===
Writers sometimes use a pseudonym, otherwise known as a pen name or &quot;nom de plume&quot;. The reasons they do this include to separate their writing from other work (or other types of writing) for which they are known; to enhance the possibility of publication by reducing prejudice (such as against women writers or writers of a particular race); to reduce personal risk (such as political risks from individuals, groups or states that disagree with them); or to make their name better suit another language.

Examples of well-known writers who used a pen name include: [[George Eliot]] (1819–1880), whose real name was Mary Anne (or Marian) Evans; [[George Orwell]] (1903–1950), whose real name was Eric Blair; [[George Sand]] (1804–1876), whose real name was Lucile Aurore Dupin; [[Dr. Seuss]] (1904–1991), whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel; Stendhal (1783–1842), whose real name was Marie-Henri Beyle and [[Mark Twain]] (1835–1910), whose real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens.

Apart from the large numbers of works attributable only to &quot;Anonymous&quot;, there are a large number of writers who were once known and are now unknown. Efforts are made to find and re-publish these writers' works. One example is the publication of books like ''Japan As Seen and Described by Famous Writers'' (a 2010 reproduction of a pre-1923 publication) by &quot;Anonymous&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anonymous|title=Japan As Seen and Described by Famous Writers (published pre-1923)|year=2010 |publisher=BiblioLife|isbn=9781142479084}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the founding of a Library and Study Centre for the Study of Early English Women's Writing in Chawton, England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chawton.org/ Chawton House Library | Home to early English women's writing]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CumaeanSibylByMichelangelo.jpg|thumb|Cumaean Sibyl by [[Michelangelo]]]]

===Fictional writers===
Some fictional writers are very well known because of the strength of their characterization by the real writer or the significance of their role as writer in the plot of a work. Examples of this type of fictional writer include Edward Casaubon, a fictional scholar in George Eliot's ''[[Middlemarch]]'', and Edwin Reardon, a fictional writer in [[George Gissing]]'s ''[[New Grub Street]]''. Casaubon's efforts to complete an authoritative study affect the decisions taken by the protagonists in Eliot's novel and inspire significant parts of the plot. In Gissing's work, Reardon's efforts to produce high quality writing put him in conflict with another character, who takes a more commercial approach. [[Robinson Crusoe]] is a fictional writer who was originally credited by the real writer ([[Daniel Defoe]]) as being the author of the confessional letters in the work of the same name. [[Bridget Jones]] is a comparable fictional diarist created by writer [[Helen Fielding]]. Both works became well-known and popular; their protagonists and story were developed further through many adaptations, including film versions. [[Cyrano de Bergerac]] was a real writer who created a fictional character with his own name. The ''[[Sibylline Books]]'', a collection of prophecies were supposed to have been purchased from the [[Cumaean Sibyl]] by the last king of Rome. Since they were consulted during periods of crisis, it could be said that they are a case of real works created by a fictional writer.

===Writers of sacred texts===
[[File:Ethiopian - John the Evangelist - Walters W850153V - Open Reverse.jpg|thumb| [[John the Evangelist]] Ethiopian c. 1540]]
[[Religious text]]s or scriptures are the texts which different religious traditions consider to be [[sacred]], or of central importance to their religious tradition. Some religions and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] movements believe that their sacred texts are [[divinity|divinely]] or [[supernatural]]ly [[revelation|revealed or inspired]], while others have individual authors.

==Controversial writing==
[[File:Old Man with Water Studies.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Leonardo da Vinci]] c. 1513 ''Old Man with water studies''. In the [[Royal Librarian (United Kingdom)|Royal Library, Windsor]]. Thought to be a self-portrait, showing Leonardo's writing and drawing.]]
Skilled writers influence ideas and society, so there are many instances where a writer's work or opinion has been unwelcome and controversial. In some cases, they have been persecuted or punished. Aware that their writing will cause controversy or put themselves and others into danger, some writers self-censor; or withhold their work from publication; or hide their manuscripts; or use some other technique to preserve and protect their work. Two of the most famous examples are [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Charles Darwin]]. Leonardo &quot;had the habit of conversing with himself in his writings and of putting his thoughts into the clearest and most simple form&quot;. He used &quot;left-handed or mirror writing&quot; (a technique described as &quot;so characteristic of him&quot;) to protect his scientific research from other readers.&lt;ref name=Leonardo&gt;{{cite book|title=&quot;Leonardo's Manuscripts&quot; in Leonardo de Vinci|publisher=Reynal and Company, in association with William Morris and Company|location=New York|pages=157|edition=Authoritative work, published in Italy by Istituto Geografico De Agostini, in conjunction with exhibition of Leonardo's work in Milan in 1938 (re-edited English translation)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fear of persecution, social disgrace, and being proved incorrect are regarded as contributing factors to Darwin's delaying the publication of his radical and influential work ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.

One of the results of controversies caused by a writer's work is scandal, which is a negative public reaction that causes damage to reputation and depends on public outrage. It has been said that it is possible to scandalise the public because the public &quot;wants to be shocked in order to confirm its own sense of virtue&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson &amp; Wilson&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Colin|title=Scandal!: An Explosive Exposé of the Affairs, Corruption and Power Struggles of the Rich and Famous|year=2011|publisher=Random House|author2=Damon Wilson }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scandal may be caused by what the writer wrote or by the style in which it was written. In either case, the content or the style is likely to have broken with tradition or expectation. Making such a departure may in fact, be part of the writer's intention or at least, part of the result of introducing innovations into the genre in which they are working. For example, novelist [[D H Lawrence]] challenged ideas of what was acceptable as well as what was expected in form. These may be regarded as literary scandals, just as, in a different way, are the scandals involving writers who mislead the public about their identity, such as [[Norma Khouri]] or [[Helen Darville]] who, in deceiving the public, are considered to have committed fraud.

Writers may also cause the more usual type of scandal – whereby the public is outraged by the opinions, behaviour or life of the individual (an experience not limited to writers). Poet [[Paul Verlaine]] outraged society with his behaviour and treatment of his wife and child as well as his lover. Among the many writers whose writing or life was affected by scandals are [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Lord Byron]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Albert Camus]], and [[H. G. Wells]]. One of the most famously scandalous writers was the [[Marquis de Sade]] who offended the public both by his writings ''and'' by his behaviour.

===Punishment===
[[File:Tyndale-martyrdom.png|thumb|Engraving depicting the death of [[William Tyndale]]]]
The consequence of scandal for a writer may be censorship or discrediting of the work, or social ostracism of its creator. In some instances, punishment, persecution, or prison follow. The [[list of journalists killed in Europe]], [[list of journalists killed in the United States]] and the [[list of journalists killed in Russia]] are examples. Others include:
* The [[Balibo Five]], a group of Australian television journalists who were killed while attempting to report on Indonesian incursions into [[Portuguese Timor]] in 1975.
* [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] (1906–1945), an influential theologian who wrote ''[[The Cost of Discipleship]]'' and was hanged for his resistance to [[Nazism]].
* [[Antonio Gramsci]] (1891–1937), who wrote political theory and criticism and was imprisoned for this by the Italian Fascist regime.
* [[Günter Grass]] (1927–2015), whose poem &quot;[[What Must Be Said]]&quot; led to his being declared ''[[persona non grata]]''  in [[Israel]].
* [[Peter Greste]] (born 1965), a journalist who was imprisoned in Egypt for news reporting which was &quot;damaging to national security.&quot;&lt;ref name=bbc-crisis&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25546389 |title=Egypt crisis: Al-Jazeera journalists arrested in Cairo |work=BBC News |date=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Primo Levi]] (1919–1987) who, among many Jews imprisoned during World War II, wrote an account of his incarceration called ''[[If This Is a Man]]''.
* [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564–1642), who was sentenced to imprisonment for [[heresy]] as a consequence of writing in support of the then controversial theory of [[heliocentrism]], although the sentence was almost immediately commuted to [[house arrest]].
* [[Sima Qian]] (145 or 135 BC – 86 BC) who &quot;successfully defended a vilified master from defamatory charges&quot; and was given &quot;the choice between [[castration]] or execution.&quot; He &quot;became a eunuch and had to bury his own book ... in order to protect it from the authorities.&quot;&lt;ref name=Battles&gt;{{cite book|last=Battles|first=Matthew|title=Library – An Unquiet History|year=2003|publisher=William Heinemann|location=London|isbn=0-434-00887-7}}p40&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Salman Rushdie]] (born 1947), whose novel ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' was banned and burned internationally after causing [[The Satanic Verses controversy|such a worldwide storm]] that a [[Fatwa|fatwā]] was issued against him. Though Rushdie survived, numerous others were killed in incidents connected to the novel.
* [[Roberto Saviano]] (born 1979), whose best-selling book ''[[Gomorrah (book)|Gomorrah]]'' provoked the Neapolitan [[Camorra]], annoyed [[Silvio Berlusconi]] and led to him receiving permanent police protection.
* [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] (1918–2008), who used his experience of imprisonment as the subject of his writing in ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]'' and ''[[Cancer Ward]]''—the latter, while legally published in the Soviet Union, had to gain the approval of the [[Union of Soviet Writers|USSR Union of Writers]].
* [[William Tyndale]] ({{Circa|1494}} – 1536), who was executed because he translated the Bible into English.
* [[Simon Sheppard (activist)|Simon Sheppard]] (born 1957) who was imprisoned in the UK for expressing controversial opinions on race and the Holocaust.

==Protection and representation==
The organisation [[Reporters Without Borders]] (also known by its French name: Reporters Sans Frontières) was set up to help protect writers and advocate on their behalf.

The professional and industrial interests of writers are represented by various national or regional guilds or unions. Examples include writers guilds in [[Australian Writers' Guild|Australia]] and [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and unions in [[Arab Writers Union|Arabia]], [[Writers Union of Armenia|Armenia]], [[Union of Azerbaijani Writers|Azerbaijan]], [[Writers' Union of Canada|Canada]], [[Estonian Writers' Union|Estonia]], [[Hungarian Writers' Union|Hungary]], [[Irish Writers' Union|Ireland]], [[Moldovan Writers' Union|Moldova]], [[Unyon ng mga Manunulat sa Pilipinas|Philippines]], [[Polish Writers' Union|Poland]], [[Union des écrivaines et des écrivains québécois|Québéc]], [[Writers' Union of Romania|Romania]], [[Union of Russian Writers|Russia]], [[Sudanese Writers Union|Sudan]], and [[Writer's Union of Ukraine|Ukraine]]. In the United States, there is both a [[Writers Guild of America|writers guild]] and a [[National Writers Union]].

==Awards==
[[File:Tomas Transtromer and Modhir Ahmed.jpg|thumb|[[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]] Swedish winning poet and translator [[Tomas Tranströmer]] signs a book about his work by [[Modhir Ahmed]] (2007)]]
There are many awards for writers whose writing has been adjudged excellent. Among them are the many [[literary award]]s given by individual countries, such as the [[Prix Goncourt]] and the [[Pulitzer Prize]], as well as international awards such as the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Russian writer [[Boris Pasternak]] (1890–1960), under pressure from his government, reluctantly declined the Nobel Prize that he won in 1958.

'''Victor Andrew de Bier Everleigh McLaglen''' (10 December 1886 – 7 November 1959) was an English [[film actor]] who held both British and American citizenship.&lt;ref name=&quot;WVobit&quot;&gt;Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', 11 November 1959, page 79.&lt;/ref&gt; He was known as a [[character actor]], particularly in [[Western (genre)|Westerns]], and made seven films with [[John Ford]] and [[John Wayne]]. McLaglen won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] in 1935 for his role in ''[[The Informer (1935 film)|The Informer]]''.

==Early life==
McLaglen claimed to have been born in [[Tunbridge Wells]], [[Kent]], although his birth certificate records [[Stepney]] in the [[East End of London]] as his true birthplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=PrdEKeq0bNmjEdMwdcABvA&amp;scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=20 November 2015|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Andrew Charles Albert Mclaglen, was a missionary in the Free Protestant Church in South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Pocock|first=Roger|date=2015-08-11|title=The Fighting Macks (an extraordinary family of brothers)|url=https://frontiersmenhistorian.info/2015/08/11/the-fighting-macks-an-extraordinary-family-of-brothers/|access-date=2020-06-12|website=The Frontiersmen Historian|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was later a bishop of the [[Free Protestant Episcopal Church]] of England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bloomsburypeople.blogspot.com/2009/12/victor-mclaglens-father-new-revelations.html ''Victor McLaglen's father – new revelations'']; [[Peter Anson]] BISHOPS AT LARGE (1964) has further information on Bishop McLaglen.&lt;/ref&gt; The McLaglen family is ultimately of Scottish origin, descended from a MacLachlan who settled in South Africa in the 19th century. The name was rendered into McLaglen from Dutch pronunciation. A.C.A. McLaglen was christened Andries Carel Albertus McLaglen in Cape Town on 4 April 1851.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:S3HT-6224-Q34|title=Parish registers, Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk, Cape Town (Cape Province), 1695-1976: Baptisms 1843-1852|accessdate=20 April 2018|work=South Africa, Dutch Reformed Church Registers (Cape Town Archives), 1660-1970|publisher=FamilySearch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of ten10 siblings, he had eight brothers and a sister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Father of Four Film Stars: Death of Bishop McLaglen |work=Derby Daily Telegraph |date=18 October 1928 |accessdate=22 September 2018 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000327/19281018/018/0004| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; Four of his brothers also became actors: Arthur (1888–1972), an actor and sculptor, and [[Clifford McLaglen|Clifford]] (1892–1978), Cyril (1899–1987), and Kenneth (''circa'' 1901–1979).&lt;ref&gt;[http://1914–1918.invisionzone.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=49416 ''Victor McLaglen, Query''], invisionzone.com, 19 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other siblings included Frederick (born ''circa'' 1882), Sydney (born ''circa'' 1884), Lewis (born ''circa'' 1889), and a sister, Lily (born ''circa'' 1893). Another brother, Leopold McLaglen (1884–1951), who appeared in one film, gained notoriety prior to World War I as a [[showman]] and self-proclaimed world [[jujutsu]] champion,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ejmas.com/jnc/jncart_McLaglan_1202.htm &quot;The Science of Jiujitsu&quot;].

==Army service and boxing career==
McLaglen left home at 14 to join the [[British Army]] with the intention of fighting in the [[Second Boer War]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Daley&quot;&gt;Daley, Alex (2018) &quot;Hollywood Heavyweight&quot;, ''Boxing News'', 13 September 2018, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; but much to his chagrin, he was stationed at [[Windsor Castle]] in the [[Life Guards (British Army)|Life Guards]] and was later forced to leave the army when his true age was discovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daley&quot; /&gt;

Four years later, he moved to [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], Canada, where he became a local celebrity,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mhs.mb.ca/docs/mb_history/67/quietman.shtml ''Winnipeg's 'Quiet' Man''] Manitoba Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt; earning a living as a [[Wrestling|wrestler]] and [[heavyweight]] boxer, with several notable wins in the ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article166733648|title=VICTOR MclAGLEN MAY BE ANOTHER JIM JEFFRIES.|newspaper=[[Sydney Sportsman]]|volume=VIII|issue=402|location=New South Wales, Australia|date=8 April 1908|accessdate=18 December 2017|page=7|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also briefly served as a constable in the Winnipeg Police Force in 1907.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

One of his most famous fights was against heavyweight champion [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] in a six-round [[Exhibition fight|exhibition bout]] at the Vancouver Athletic Club on 10 March 1909.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daley&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;boxing&quot;&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/mclaglen.htm ''Victor McLaglen''], Cyber Boxing Zone; accessed 17 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article79917115|title=GIANT ATHLETE|newspaper=The Daily News|volume=XXXIII|issue=12,088|location=Western Australia|date=27 March 1914|accessdate=18 December 2017|page=2|edition=THIRD|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was Johnson's first bout since winning the heavyweight title from [[Tommy Burns (Canadian boxer)|Tommy Burns]]. Between bouts, McLaglen toured with a [[circus]], which offered $25 to anyone who could go three rounds with him.

He returned to Britain in 1913, and during the First World War served as a [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] ([[Acting (rank)|acting]]) with the 10th Battalion, [[Middlesex Regiment]]. Later, he claimed to have served with the [[Royal Irish Fusiliers]]. He served for a time as military assistant provost marshal for the city of [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://1914-1918.invisionzone.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=38586&amp;hl=McLaglen+myth ''Victor McLaglen myth?''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223235137/http://1914-1918.invisionzone.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=38586&amp;hl=McLaglen+myth# |date=23 February 2009 }}, Invisionzone.com, 26 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=McLaglen Hopes He Won't Stay Long |work=Sheffield Independent |date=6 October 1937 |accessdate=22 September 2018 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001465/19371006/017/0001| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued boxing, and was named heavyweight champion of the British Army in 1918.&lt;ref name=&quot;boxing&quot;/&gt;

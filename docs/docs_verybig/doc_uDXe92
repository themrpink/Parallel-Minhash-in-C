'''Nevi'im''' ({{IPAc-en|n|ə|v|i|ˈ|iː|m|,_|n|ə|ˈ|v|iː|ɪ|m}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/neviim &quot;Neviim&quot;]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-he-n|נְבִיאִים}} ''Nəḇî'îm'', &quot;Prophets&quot; literally &quot;spokespersons&quot;) is the second main division of the [[Hebrew Bible]] (the ''[[Tanakh]]''), between the [[Torah]] (instruction) and [[Ketuvim]] (writings). The Nevi'im are divided into two groups. The Former Prophets ({{lang-he-n|נביאים ראשונים}} ''Nevi'im Rishonim'') consists of the narrative books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings; while the Latter Prophets ({{lang-he-n|נביאים אחרונים}} ''Nevi'im Akharonim'') include the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the [[Twelve Minor Prophets]].

== Synopsis ==
In [[Judaism]], ''[[Books of Samuel|Samuel]]'' and ''[[Books of Kings|Kings]]'' are each counted as one book. In addition, twelve relatively short prophetic books are counted as one in a single collection called ''Trei Asar'' or &quot;The [[Twelve Minor Prophets]]&quot;. The Jewish tradition thus counts a total of eight books in ''Nevi'im'' out of a total of 24 books in the entire Tanakh. In the Jewish [[liturgy]], selections from the books of ''Nevi'im'' known as the ''[[Haftarah]]'' are read publicly in the synagogue after the reading of the Torah on each [[Shabbat]], as well as on Jewish festivals and fast days. The [[Book of Daniel]] is part of the Writings, or ''[[Ketuvim]]'', in the Tanakh.{{Efn | In the various Christian Bibles for Protestants, Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox, there are deviations and exceptions: The prophets are placed in the final section (following the writings) of the Hebrew Bible text. The major prophets (''[[Book of Isaiah]]'', ''[[Book of Jeremiah]]'' and ''[[Book of Ezekiel]]'') are followed by ''[[Book of Daniel]]'' due to its prophetic nature according to common Christian theology. Roman Catholic Bibles also place [[additions to Daniel]] here, and the Eastern Orthodox Church includes additions to Daniel, plus 4 Maccabees following Malachi in its Bible canon. The ordering of the twelve minor prophets, however, which is roughly chronological, is the same for all three Christian traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Coogan | first = Michael D | title = A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2009 | pages = 8–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = The Making of the Old Testament Canon | first = Lou H | last = Silberman | title = The Interpreter’s One-Volume Commentary on the Bible | publisher = Abingdon Press | place = Nashville | origyear = 1971 | year = 1991 | page = 1209}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Former Prophets===
The Former Prophets are the books Joshua, Judges, 1st &amp; 2nd Samuel, 1st &amp; 2nd Kings. They contain historical narratives that begin immediately after the death of Moses with the divine appointment of Joshua as his successor, who then leads the people of Israel into the Promised Land, and end with the release from imprisonment of the last king of Judah. Treating Samuel and Kings as single books, they cover:
# Joshua's conquest of the land of Canaan (in the [[Book of Joshua]]), 
# the struggle of the people to possess the land (in the [[Book of Judges]]), 
# the people's request to God to give them a king so that they can occupy the land in the face of their enemies (in the books of 1st and 2nd [[Samuel]])
# the possession of the land under the divinely-appointed kings of the House of David, ending in conquest and foreign exile (1st and 2nd Kings)

====Joshua====
The [[Book of Joshua]]  (''Yehoshua'' יהושע) contains a history of the [[Israelites]] from the death of [[Moses]] to that of [[Joshua]]. After Moses' death, Joshua, by virtue of his previous appointment as Moses' successor, receives from God the command to cross the Jordan. In execution of this order Joshua issues the requisite instructions to the stewards of the people for the crossing of the Jordan; and he reminds the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half of Manasseh of their pledge given to Moses to help their brethren.

The book essentially consists of three parts:
# The history of the conquest of the land (1–12).
# The allotment of the land to the different tribes, with the appointment of cities of refuge, the provision for the Levites (13–22), and the dismissal of the eastern tribes to their homes.
# The farewell addresses of Joshua, with an account of his death (23, 24).

====Judges====
The [[Book of Judges]] (''Shoftim'' שופטים) consists of three distinct parts:
#The Introduction (1:1–3:10 and 3:12) giving a summary of the book of Joshua.
#The Main Text (3:11–16:31), discussing the five Great Judges, [[Abimelech (Judges)]], and providing glosses for a few minor Judges.
#The Appendices (17:1–21:25), giving two stories set in the time of the Judges, but not discussing the Judges themselves.

====Samuel====
The [[Books of Samuel]] (''Shmu'el'' שמואל) consists of five parts:
* The period of [[Tetragrammaton|God]]'s rejection of [[Eli (Biblical priest)|Eli]], [[Samuel (biblical figure)|Samuel's]] birth, and subsequent judgment (1 Samuel 1:1–7:17).
* The period of the life of [[Saul]] prior to meeting [[David]] (1 Samuel 8:1–15:35).
* The period of Saul's interaction with David (1 Samuel 16:1 – 2 Samuel 1:27).
* The period of David's reign and the rebellions he suffers (2 Samuel 2:1–20:22).
* An appendix of material concerning David in no particular order, and out of sequence with the rest of the text (2 Samuel 22:1–24:25).

A conclusion of sorts appears at [[1 Kings]] 1–2, concerning [[Solomon]] enacting a final revenge on those who did what David perceived as wrongdoing, and having a similar narrative style. While the subject matter in the Book(s) of Samuel is also covered by the narrative in [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]], it is noticeable that the section (2 Sam. 11:2–12:29) containing an account of the matter of [[Bathsheba]] is omitted in the corresponding passage in 1 Chr. 20.

====Kings====
The [[Books of Kings]] (''Melakhim'' מלכים) contains accounts of the kings of the ancient [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] and the [[Kingdom of Judah]], and the [[annal]]s of the Jewish commonwealth from the accession of [[Solomon]] until the subjugation of the kingdom by [[Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon|Nebuchadnezzar]] and the [[Babylonians]].

===Latter Prophets===
The Latter Prophets are divided into two groups, the [[Major prophet]]s (Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel) and the [[Twelve Minor Prophets]] (Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi) collected into a single book.

====Isaiah====
The 66 chapters of [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] (''Yeshayahu'' [ישעיהו]) consist primarily of prophecies of the judgments awaiting nations that are persecuting [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. These nations include [[Babylon]], [[Assyria]], [[Philistia]], [[Moab]], [[Syria]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] (the northern kingdom), [[Ethiopia]], [[Egypt]], [[Arabia]], and [[Phoenicia]].  The prophecies concerning them can be summarized as saying that [[Tetragrammaton|God]] is the God of the whole earth, and that nations which think of themselves as secure in their own power might well be conquered by other nations, at God's command.

Chapter 6 describes Isaiah's call to be a prophet of God. Chapters 36–39 provide historical material about King [[Hezekiah]] and his triumph of faith in God. Chapters 24–35, while too complex to characterize easily, are primarily concerned with prophecies of a [[Messiah]], a person anointed or given power by God, and of the Messiah's kingdom, where justice and righteousness will reign.  This section is seen by Jews as describing an actual king, a descendant of their great king, David, who will make Judah a great kingdom and [[Jerusalem]] a truly holy city.

The prophecy continues with what some scholars&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblica.com/en-us/bible/online-bible/scholar-notes/niv-study-bible/intro-to-isaiah Biblica.com - Introduction to Isaiah - Scholar Notes from the Zondervan NIV Study Bible.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bible.org/seriespage/introduction-study-book-isaiah|title=1. Introduction to The Study of the Book of Isaiah|work=Bible.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; have called &quot;The Book of Comfort&quot; which begins in chapter 40 and completes the writing. In the first eight chapters of this book of comfort, Isaiah prophesies the deliverance of the [[Jew]]s from the hands of the Babylonians and restoration of Israel as a unified nation in the land promised to them by God. Isaiah reaffirms that the Jews are indeed the chosen people of God in chapter 44 and that [[Tetragrammaton|Hashem]] is the only God for the Jews (and only the God of the Jews) as he will show his power over the gods of Babylon in due time in chapter 46. In chapter 45:1 the Persian ruler [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] is named as the [[messiah]] who will overthrow the Babylonians and allow the return of Israel to their original land.  The remaining chapters of the book contain prophecies of the future glory of [[Zion]] under the rule of a righteous servant (52 &amp; 54). Chapter 53 contains a very poetic prophecy about this servant which is generally considered by [[Christians]] to refer to the [[crucifixion]] of [[Jesus]], though Jews generally interpret it as a reference to God's people. Although there is still the mention of judgment of false worshippers and idolaters (65 &amp; 66), the book ends with a message of hope of a righteous ruler who extends salvation to his righteous subjects living in the Lord's kingdom on earth.

====Jeremiah====
The [[Book of Jeremiah]] (''Yirmiyahu'' [ירמיהו]) can be divided into twenty-three chapters, which are organized into five sub-sections or books.
# The introduction, ch. 1.
# Scorn for the sins of Israel, consisting of seven sections, (1.) ch. 2; (2.) ch. 3–6; (3.) ch. 7–10; (4.) ch. 11–13; (5.) ch. 14–17:18; (6.) ch. 17:19–ch. 20; (7.) ch. 21–24.
# A general review of all nations, foreseeing their destruction, in two sections, (1.) ch. 46–49; (2.) ch. 25; with an historical appendix of three sections, (1.) ch. 26; (2.) ch. 27; (3.) ch. 28, 29.
# Two sections picturing the hopes of better times, (1.) ch. 30, 31; (2.) ch. 32,33; to which is added an historical appendix in three sections, (1.) ch. 34:1–7; (2.) ch. 34:8-22; (3.) ch. 35.
# The conclusion, in two sections, (1.) ch. 36; (2.) ch. 45.

In Egypt, after an interval, Jeremiah is supposed to have added three sections, viz., ch. 37–39; 40–43; and 44. The main Messianic prophecies are found in 23:1–8; 31:31–40; and 33:14–26.

[[Jeremiah]]'s prophecies are noted for the frequent repetitions found in them of the same words, phrases, and imagery. They cover the period of about 30 years. They are not in chronological order. Modern scholars do not believe they have reliable theories as to when, where, and how the text was edited into its present form.

====Ezekiel====
The [[Book of Ezekiel]] (''Yehezq'el'' [יחזקאל]) contains three distinct sections.
# Judgment on Israel – Ezekiel makes a series of denunciations against his fellow Judeans ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ezekiel%203:22-24;&amp;version=49; 3:22–24]), warning them of the certain destruction of [[Jerusalem]], in opposition to the words of the false prophets ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ezekiel%204:1-3;&amp;version=49; 4:1–3]). The symbolic acts, by which the extremities to which Jerusalem would be reduced are described in [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ezekiel%204-5;&amp;version=49; Chapters 4 and 5], show his intimate acquaintance with the Levitical legislation. (See, for example, [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2022:30;&amp;version=49; 22:30]; [[Deuteronomy]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut%2014:21;&amp;version=49; 14:21]; [[Leviticus]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lev%205:2;&amp;version=49; 5:2]; [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lev%207:18,24;&amp;version=49; 7:18,24]; [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lev%2017:15;&amp;version=49; 17:15]; [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lev%2019:7;&amp;version=49; 19:7]; [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lev%2022:8;&amp;version=49; 22:8])
# Prophecies against various neighboring nations: against the [[Ammon]]ites ( [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2025:1-7;&amp;version=49; Ezek. 25:1–7]), the [[Moab]]ites ( [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%208-11;&amp;version=49; 25:8–11]), the [[Edom]]ites ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2012-14;&amp;version=49; 25:12–14]), the [[Philistines]] ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2015-17;&amp;version=49; 25:15–17]), [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]] ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2026-28;&amp;version=49; 26–28]), and against [[Egypt]] ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2029-32;&amp;version=49; 29-32]).
# Prophecies delivered after the destruction of Jerusalem by [[Nebuchadnezzar II]]: the triumphs of Israel and of the kingdom of God on earth ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2033-39;&amp;version=49; Ezek. 33–39]); Messianic times, and the establishment and prosperity of the kingdom of God ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2040;48;&amp;version=49; 40–48]).

====The Twelve====
{{Main|Twelve Minor Prophets}}
The Twelve are:
# [[Book of Hosea|Hosea]] or ''Hoshea'' [הושע]
# [[Book of Joel|Joel]] or ''Yo'el'' [יואל]
# [[Book of Amos|Amos]] [עמוס]
# [[Book of Obadiah|Obadiah]] or ''Ovadyah'' [עובדיה]
# [[Book of Jonah|Jonah]] or ''Yonah'' [יונה]
# [[Book of Micah|Micah]] or ''Mikhah'' [מיכה]
# [[Book of Nahum|Nahum]] or ''Nachum'' [נחום]
# [[Book of Habakkuk|Habakkuk]] or ''Habaquq'' [חבקוק]
# [[Book of Zephaniah|Zephaniah]] or ''Tsefania'' [צפניה]
# [[Book of Haggai|Haggai]] or ''Haggai'' [חגי]
# [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] ''Zekharia'' [זכריה]
# [[Book of Malachi|Malachi]] or ''Malakhi'' [מלאכי]

==Liturgical use==
{{main|Haftarah}}
The [[Haftarah]] is a text selected from the books of ''Nevi'im'' that is read publicly in the synagogue after the reading of the Torah on each [[Shabbat]], as well as on Jewish festivals and fast days.

===Cantillation===
There is a special [[cantillation]] melody for the haftarah, distinct from that of the Torah portion.  In some earlier authorities there are references to a tune for the &quot;prophets&quot; generally, distinct from that for the haftarah: this may have been a simplified melody for learning purposes.{{Efn | The article on &quot;Cantillation&quot; in the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] shows tunes for &quot;Prophets (other readings)&quot; for both the Western Sephardi and the Baghdadi traditions.}}

Certain cantillation marks and combinations appear in Nevi'im but not within any of the Haftarah selections, and most communities therefore do not have a musical tradition for those marks. J.L. Neeman suggested that &quot;those who recite Nevi'im privately with the cantillation melody may read the words accented by those rare notes by using a &quot;metaphor&quot; based on the melody of those notes in the five books of the Torah, while adhering to the [[musical scale]] of the melody for Nevi'im.&quot;  Neeman includes a reconstruction of the musical scale for the lost melodies of the rare cantillation notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Neeman | first = JL | title = The Tunes of the Bible – Musical Principles of the Biblical Accentuation | place = Tel Aviv | year = 1955 | language = Hebrew | volume = 1 | pages = 136, 188–89}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Ashkenazi tradition, the resemblance between the Torah and Haftarah melodies is obvious and it is easy to transpose motifs between the two as suggested by Neeman.  In the Sephardi traditions the haftarah melody is considerably more florid than the Torah melody, and usually in a different musical mode, and there are only isolated points of contact between the two.

===Extraliturgical public reading===
{{Main|Seder ha-Mishmarah}}
In some Near and [[Mizrahi Jews|Middle Eastern Jewish]] traditions, the whole of Nevi'im (as well as the rest of the Tanakh and the Mishnah) is read each year on a weekly rota, usually on Shabbat afternoons. These reading sessions often take place in the synagogue courtyard but are not considered to be synagogue services.

==Aramaic translation==
A ''[[targum]]'' is an [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] [[translation]] of the Hebrew Scriptures that was compiled or written in the [[Land of Israel]] or in [[Babylonia]] from the [[Second Temple]] period until the early [[Middle Ages]] (late first millennium). According to the [[Talmud]], the targum on Nevi'im was composed by [[Jonathan ben Uzziel]]. Like [[Targum Onkelos]] on the Torah, [[Targum Jonathan]] is an eastern ([[Babylon]]ian) targum with early origins in the west ([[Land of Israel]]).

Like the targum to the Torah, [[Targum Jonathan]] to Nevi'im served a formal liturgical purpose: it was read alternately, verse by verse, or in blocks of up to three verses, in the public reading of the Haftarah and in the study of Nevi'im. [[Yemenite Jews]] continue the above tradition to this day, and have thus preserved a living tradition of the Babylonian vocalization for the Targum to Nevi'im.

Compendium of Chemical Terminology, 2nd ed. (the &quot;Gold Book&quot;). Compiled by A. D. McNaught and A. Wilkinson. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford (1997). Online version (2019-) created by S. J. Chalk. {{ISBN|0-9678550-9-8}}. https://doi.org/10.1351/goldbook.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''coordinate bond'''&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef | file = C01329 | title = coordinate bond}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a kind of two-center, two-electron [[covalent bond]] in which the two [[electrons]] derive from the same [[atom]].  The bonding of [[Metal#Chemical|metal]] [[ions]] to [[ligand]]s involves this kind of interaction.  This type of interaction is central to [[Lewis acids and bases|Lewis theory]].

== Examples ==
[[File:NH3-BF3-adduct-bond-lengthening-2D.png|thumb|Formation of an [[adduct]] of [[ammonia]] and [[boron trifluoride]], involving formation of a coordinate covalent bond.]]
Coordinate covalent bonding is pervasive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all [[metal aquo complex|metal aquo-complex]]es [M(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]''&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the bonding between water and the metal [[cation]] is described as a coordinate covalent bond.  Metal-ligand interactions in most [[organometallic]] [[Chemical_compound|compounds]] and most [[coordination compound|coordination compounds]] are described similarly.

The term ''dipolar bond'' is used in [[organic chemistry]] for compounds such as [[amine oxide]]s for which the electronic structure can be described in terms of the basic [[amine]] donating two electrons to an oxygen atom.

:{{chem|R|3|N}} → O

The arrow → indicates that both electrons in the bond originate from the amine [[Moiety (chemistry)|moiety]]. In a standard covalent bond each atom contributes one electron. Therefore, an alternative description is that the amine gives away one electron to the oxygen atom, which is then used, with the remaining unpaired electron on the nitrogen atom, to form a standard covalent bond. The process of transferring the electron from nitrogen to oxygen creates [[formal charge]]s, so the electronic structure may also be depicted as

:{{chem|R|3|N|+|O|-}}

[[File:CoA6Cl3.png|thumb|220px|Hexamminecobalt(III) chloride]]
This electronic structure has an [[electric dipole]], hence the name polar bond. In reality, the atoms carry [[fractional charge]]s; the more [[electronegative]] atom of the two involved in the bond will usually carry a fractional negative charge. One exception to this is [[carbon monoxide]]. In this case, the carbon atom carries the fractional negative charge although it is less electronegative than oxygen.

An example of a dative covalent bond is provided by the interaction between a molecule of [[ammonia]], a [[Lewis base]] with a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom, and [[boron trifluoride]], a [[Lewis acid]] by virtue of the boron atom having an incomplete [[octet rule|octet]] of electrons. In forming the adduct, the boron atom attains an octet configuration.

The electronic structure of a [[coordination complex]] can be described in terms of the set of [[ligand]]s each donating a pair of electrons to a metal centre.  For example, in [[hexamminecobalt(III) chloride]], each [[ammonia]] ligand donates its lone pair of electrons to the cobalt(III) ion. In this case, the bonds formed are described as coordinate bonds.

== Comparison with other electron-sharing modes ==
In all cases, the bond, whether dative or &quot;normal&quot; electron-sharing, is a covalent bond.  In common usage, the prefix dipolar, dative or coordinate merely serves to indicate the origin of the electrons used in creating the bond.  For example, F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B ← O(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&quot;[[Boron trifluoride etherate|boron trifluoride (diethyl) etherate]]&quot;) is prepared from BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and :O(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as opposed to the radical species [•BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; and [•O(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.  The dative bond is also a convenience in terms of notation, as formal charges are avoided: we can write D: + ()A ⇌ D → A rather than D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;–A&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; (here : and () represent the lone-pair and empty orbital on the electron-pair donor D and acceptor A, respectively).  The notation is sometimes used even when the Lewis acid-base reaction involved is only notional (e.g., the sulfoxide R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → O is rarely if ever made by reacting the sulfide R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S with atomic oxygen O).  Thus, most chemists ''do not'' make any claim with respect to the properties of the bond when choosing one notation over the other (formal charges vs. arrow bond).

It is generally true, however, that bonds depicted this way are polar covalent, sometimes strongly so, and some authors claim that there are genuine differences in the properties of a dative bond and electron-sharing bond and suggest that showing a dative bond is more appropriate in particular situations.  As far back as 1989, Haaland characterized dative bonds as bonds that are (i) weak and long; (ii) with only a small degree of charge-transfer taking place during bond formation; and (iii) whose preferred mode of dissociation in the gas phase (or low ε inert solvent) is heterolytic rather than homolytic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haaland|first=Arne|date=1989|title=Covalent versus Dative Bonds to Main Group Metals, a Useful Distinction|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English|language=en|volume=28|issue=8|pages=992–1007|doi=10.1002/anie.198909921|issn=0570-0833}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ammonia-borane adduct (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N → BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is given as a classic example: the bond is weak, with a dissociation energy of 31 kcal/mol (cf. 90 kcal/mol for ethane), and long, at 166 pm (cf. 153 pm for ethane), and the molecule possesses a dipole moment of 5.2 D that implies a transfer of only 0.2 ''e''&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; from nitrogen to boron.  The heterolytic dissociation of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N → BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is estimated to require 27 kcal/mol, confirming that heterolysis into ammonia and borane is more favorable than homolysis into radical cation and radical anion.  However, aside from clear-cut examples, there is considerable dispute as to when a particular compound qualifies and, thus, the overall prevalence of dative bonding (with respect to an author's preferred definition).  Computational chemists have suggested quantitative criteria to distinguish between the two &quot;types&quot; of bonding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Himmel|first=Daniel|last2=Krossing|first2=Ingo|last3=Schnepf|first3=Andreas|date=2014-01-07|title=Dative Bonds in Main-Group Compounds: A Case for Fewer Arrows!|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|language=en|volume=53|issue=2|pages=370–374|doi=10.1002/anie.201300461|pmid=24243854}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frenking|first=Gernot|date=2014-06-10|title=Dative Bonds in Main-Group Compounds: A Case for More Arrows!|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|language=en|volume=53|issue=24|pages=6040–6046|doi=10.1002/anie.201311022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmidbaur|first=Hubert|last2=Schier|first2=Annette|date=2013-01-02|title=Coordination Chemistry at Carbon: The Patchwork Family Comprising (Ph 3 P) 2 C, (Ph 3 P)C(C 2 H 4 ), and (C 2 H 4 ) 2 C|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|language=en|volume=52|issue=1|pages=176–186|doi=10.1002/anie.201205294}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

Some non-obvious examples where dative bonding is claimed to be important include [[carbon suboxide]] (O≡C → C&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; ← C≡O), tetraaminoallenes (described using dative bond language as &quot;carbodicarbenes&quot;; (R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C → C&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; ← C(NR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), the Ramirez [[Hexaphenylcarbodiphosphorane|carbodiphosphorane]] (Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P → C&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; ← PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[Bis(triphenylphosphine)iminium chloride|bis(triphenylphosphine)iminium]] cation (Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P → N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ← PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), all of which exhibit considerably bent equilibrium geometries, though with a shallow barrier to bending.  Simple application of the normal rules for drawing Lewis structures by maximizing bonding (using electron-sharing bonds) and minimizing formal charges would predict [[heterocumulene]] structures, and therefore linear geometries, for each of these compounds.  Thus, these molecules are claimed to be better modeled as coordination complexes of :C: (carbon(0) or &quot;carbone&quot;) or :N:&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (mononitrogen cation) with CO, PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, or ''N-''heterocycliccarbenes as ligands, the lone-pairs on the central atom accounting for the bent geometry.  However, the usefulness of this view is disputed.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

'''Forensic science''', also known as '''criminalistics''',&lt;ref&gt;https://study.com/articles/Criminology_vs_Criminalistics_Whats_the_Difference.html&lt;/ref&gt; is the application of [[science]] to [[Criminal law|criminal]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil laws]], mainly—on the criminal side—during [[criminal investigation]], as governed by the legal standards of [[admissible evidence]] and [[criminal procedure]].

Forensic scientists collect, preserve, and analyze scientific [[evidence]] during the course of an investigation. While some forensic scientists travel to the scene of the crime to collect the evidence themselves, others occupy a laboratory role, performing analysis on objects brought to them by other individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;job desc&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Job Description for Forensic Laboratory Scientists | website=Crime Scene Investigator EDU | accessdate=28 August 2015 | url=http://www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org/forensic-scientist-job-description/ | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906092342/http://www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org/forensic-scientist-job-description/ | archivedate=6 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to their laboratory role, forensic scientists testify as [[expert witness]]es in both criminal and civil cases and can work for either the [[Prosecutor|prosecution]] or the defense. While any field could technically be ''forensic'', certain sections have developed over time to encompass the majority of forensically related cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;aafs sections&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Sections | website=American Academy of Forensic Sciences | date=27 August 2015 | accessdate=28 August 2015 | url=http://www.aafs.org/about-aafs/sections/ | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150830013131/http://www.aafs.org/about-aafs/sections/ | archivedate=30 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Forensic science is a combination of two different Latin words: forensis and science. The former, forensic, relates to a discussion or examination performed in public. Because trials in the ancient world were typically held in public, it carries a strong judicial connotation. The second is science, which is derived from the Latin word for 'knowledge' and is today closely tied to the scientific method, a systematic way of acquiring knowledge. Taken together, then, forensic science can be seen as the use of the scientific methods and processes in crime solving.

==Etymology==
The word ''forensic'' comes from the Latin term ''{{lang|la|forēnsis}}'', meaning &quot;of or before the forum&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{ShorterOxfordEnglishDictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of the term originates from Roman times, during which a criminal charge meant presenting the case before a group of public individuals in the [[Roman Forum|forum]]. Both the person accused of the crime and the accuser would give speeches based on their sides of the story. The case would be decided in favor of the individual with the best argument and delivery. This origin is the source of the two modern usages of the word ''forensic''—as a form of legal evidence; and as a category of public presentation.

In modern use, the term ''forensics'' in the place of ''forensic science'' can be considered incorrect, as the term ''forensic'' is effectively a [[synonym]] for ''legal'' or ''related to courts''. However, the term is now so closely associated with the scientific field that many dictionaries include the meaning that equates the word ''forensics'' with ''forensic science''.

==Accent==
=== Origins ===
Coventry in a linguistic sense looks both ways, towards both the 'West' and 'East' Midlands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chinn&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/content/articles/2005/01/07/voices_05_chinn_history_feature.shtml |title=What did the Vikings ever do for us? |date=18 April 2008 |accessdate=1 October 2009 |work=BBC News Online |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219102712/http://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/content/articles/2005/01/07/voices_05_chinn_history_feature.shtml |archive-date=19 February 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; One thousand years ago, the extreme west of Warwickshire, what today we would designate Birmingham and the Black Country was then separated from Coventry and east Warwickshire by the forest of [[Arden, Warwickshire|Arden]], with resulting inferior means of communication.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chinn&quot;/&gt; The west Warwickshire settlements too were smaller in comparison to Coventry which, by the 14th&amp;nbsp;century, was England's third city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chinn&quot;/&gt; Even as far back as Anglo-Saxon times Coventry—situated as it was, close to [[Watling Street]]—was a trading and market post between King Alfred's Saxon Mercia and [[Danelaw]] England with a consequent merging of dialects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trugill&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title= English Accents:An Introduction to Social and Regional Varieties of English in the British Isles |editor1-last=Trugill |editor1-first= Peter |editor2-last= Hughes |editor2-first=Arthur |editor3-last= Watt |editor3-first= Dominic|year= 2005 |publisher=Hodder Stoughton |isbn= 978-0-340-88718-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coventry and Birmingham accents ===
Phonetically the accent of Coventry, like the perhaps better known accent of Birmingham, is similar to Northern English with respect to its system of short vowels. For example, it lacks the BATH/TRAP (Cov. /baθ/, Southern /bɑ:θ/) and FOOT/STRUT (Cov. /strʊt/, Southern /strʌt/) splits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trugill&quot;/&gt; Yet the longer vowels in the accent also contain traces of [[Estuary English]] such as a partial implementation of the London [[diphthong]] shift, increasingly so amongst the young since 1950. We also see other [[Estuary English]] features, such as a /l/-vocalisation whereby words such as 'milk' come to be pronounced as /mɪʊk/.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trugill&quot;/&gt; However, the distinction between Coventry and Birmingham accents is often overlooked. Certain features of the Birmingham accent (e.g. occasional tapping of prevocalic /r/ in words such as 'crack') stop starkly as one moves beyond Solihull in the general direction of Coventry, a possible approximation of the 'Arden Forest' divide perhaps. In any case, Coventry sits right at a dialectal crossroads, very close to isoglosses that generally delineate 'Northern' and 'Southern' dialects, exhibiting features from both sides of the divide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trugill&quot;/&gt;

=== Coventry accent on television ===
Dramatic representations on film have been very uneven down the years, ranging from Yorkshire sounding builders visiting the Queen Vic in ''[[EastEnders]]'' [1987]{{Failed verification|reason=no mention of this on page|date=July 2020}} to Black Country sounding factory workers in the [[Jeffrey Archer]] adaptation ''[[First Among Equals (TV series)|First Among Equals]]'' (1986).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.episodeworld.com/show/EastEnders/season=22/English.html|title=Eastenders Episode Guide|date=1 October 2009|accessdate=1 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319003108/http://www.episodeworld.com/show/EastEnders/season=22/english.html|archive-date=19 March 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|reason=page does not mention &quot;First Among Equals&quot; at all|date=July 2020}} The BBC's 2009 documentary ''The Bombing of Coventry'' contained useful phonetic data on the 'Coventry Accent' in the form of interviews with Coventrians. A recent performance from the actress Becci Gemmell, playing Coventry character Joyce in the BBC drama ''[[Land Girls (TV series)|Land Girls]]'', also gave a more accurate phonetic representation of the accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/06_june/04/landgirls.shtml|title=Land Girls Press Pack|date=3 June 2009|accessdate=10 October 2009|work=BBC News Online|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609093450/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/06_june/04/landgirls.shtml|archive-date=9 June 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
A [[minor planet]], [[3009 Coventry]], discovered by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astronomer [[Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh]] in 1973, is named after the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmadel2003&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schmadel|first=Lutz D.|title=Dictionary of minor planet names|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KWrB1jPCa8AC&amp;q=3006+Livadia+1979&amp;pg=PA247|year=2003|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-00238-3|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

===Universities and further education colleges===
[[File:Coventry university 26l07.JPG|left|thumb|The Alan Berry building, Coventry University.]]
Coventry has two universities; [[Coventry University]] is situated on a modern city centre campus while the [[University of Warwick]] lies {{convert|3+1/2|mi|km|abbr=off}} to the south of the city centre. The [[University of Warwick]] is one of only five universities never to have been rated outside the top ten in terms of teaching excellence and research and is a member of the prestigious [[Russell Group]]. A team from the university won the BBC TV ''[[University Challenge]]'' trophy in April 2007. [[Coventry University]] is one of only a handful of universities to run a degree course in automotive design in the [[Coventry School of Art and Design]].

Coventry also has three further education colleges within city boundaries, [[City College Coventry|City College]], [[Henley College Coventry|Henley College]] and [[Hereward College]].

===Schools===
Many of the secondary schools in and around Coventry are specialist colleges, such as [[Finham Park School]], which is a mathematics and IT college, a teacher training school and the only school in Coventry to offer studying the International Baccalaureate, and [[Coventry Blue Coat Church of England School]] which has recently become a specialist college of music, one of only a few in the country. [[Cardinal Wiseman Catholic School and Language College]] specialises in languages. [[Bishop Ullathorne RC School]] became a specialist college in humanities in 2006. [[Ernesford Grange Community Academy]], in the south east, is a specialist science college. [[Coundon Court|Coundon Court School]] is a [[Technology College]]. [[Pattison College]], a private school opened in 1949, specialises in the performing arts. There is also [[Caludon Castle School]], a business and enterprise school, which has been rebuilt over 2005–07. [[Exhall Grange School|Exhall Grange School and Science College]] is in the north of the city, although, its catchment area is north Warwickshire. There is also [[Cardinal Newman Catholic School and Community College]] and whitley academy.

Coventry has a variety of schools: Two of the oldest secondary schools being [[President Kennedy School and Community College]] founded in 1966 and located in the north-west of Coventry (currently undergoing rebuilding work) and [[Sidney Stringer Academy]] which is located in the centre of the city. It is a co-educational school and has moved into a larger building costing £28 million.

The Coventry School Foundation comprises the independent schools [[King Henry VIII School, Coventry|King Henry VIII School]] and [[Bablake School]] together with [[King Henry VIII Preparatory School]].

The [[Woodlands Academy, Coventry|Woodlands Academy]] and Tile Hill Wood School were the last remaining single sex schools in the city, serving boys and girls respectively. These schools merged onto the Tile Hill Wood site in 2016 before officially being rebranded as [[West Coventry Academy]] in 2017. Both Woodlands and Tile Hill shared a joint sixth form along with The Westwood Academy called West Coventry Sixth Form, but in 2018 Westwood left the sixth form and it now operates under the name West Coventry Academy Sixth Form.

The Westwood Academy, which is a [[Technology College]], is close to the University of Warwick. It is the only school in Coventry that is a CISCO Academy and has links with other educational establishments, industry and the local community.

Sherbourne Fields School is an educational [[special needs]] school for young people with physical disabilities and is located in the Coundon area. It opened in the 1960s and there are now discussions as to whether to close this school.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===History and politics===
Coventry is well known for the legendary 11th&amp;nbsp;century exploits of [[Lady Godiva]] who rode through the city naked on horseback in protest at high taxes being levied on the cityfolk by her husband [[Leofric, Earl of Mercia]]. The residents of the city were commanded to look away as she rode, but one man did not and was allegedly struck blind. He became known as ''[[Voyeurism|Peeping Tom]]'' thus originating a new idiom, or metonym, in English. There is a Grade II* [[listed building|listed]] statue&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE |num=1031589 |desc=Bronze statue of Lady Godiva – Grade II* |accessdate=12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; of her in the city centre, which for 18&amp;nbsp;years had been underneath a Cathedral Lanes shopping centre canopy, removed in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/coventry_warwickshire/7697036.stm|title=Godiva statue canopy comes down|work=BBC News Online|publisher=BBC|date=29 October 2008|accessdate=30 October 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101132321/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/coventry_warwickshire/7697036.stm|archive-date=1 November 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a bust of Peeping Tom looking out across Hertford Street shopping precinct, and overlooking Broadgate and the statue of Godiva is a clock where, at every hour, Lady Godiva appears on her horse while being watched by Peeping Tom.

Although Egyptian is the oldest Afroasiatic language documented in written form, its [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] repertoire is very different from that of the rest of the [[Afroasiatic]] in general, and [[Semitic languages]] in particular. There are multiple possibilities: Egyptian had already undergone radical changes from Proto-Afroasiatic before it was recorded; the Afroasiatic family has so far been studied with an excessively Semito-centric approach; or, as G. W. Tsereteli suggests, Afroasiatic is an [[Sprachbund|allogenetic]] rather than a [[genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetic]] group of languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;l51&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Egyptian language is conventionally grouped into six major [[chronological]] divisions:&lt;ref name=&quot;Bard&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Bard |first=Kathryn A. |author2=Steven Blake Shubert |title=Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt |year=1999 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-18589-9 |pages=325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Archaic Egyptian (before 2600 BC), the [[reconstructed language]] of the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period]],
*Old Egyptian (c. 2600 – 2000 BC), the language of the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]],
*Middle Egyptian (c. 2000 – 1350 BC), the language of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] to early [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] and continuing on as a [[literary language]] into the 4th century,
*[[Late Egyptian language|Late Egyptian]] (c. 1350 – 700 BC), [[Amarna period]] to [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]],
*[[Demotic (Egyptian)#Language|Demotic]] (c. 700 BC – AD 400), the vernacular of the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]], [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] and early [[Roman Egypt]],
*[[Coptic language|Coptic]] (after c. 200 AD), the vernacular at the time of [[Copts#History|Christianisation]], and liturgical language of [[Egyptian Christianity]].

Old, Middle, and Late Egyptian were all written using both the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]] and [[hieratic]] scripts. 
[[Demotic script|Demotic]] is the name of the script derived from hieratic beginning in the 7th century BC.

The [[Coptic alphabet]] was derived from the [[Greek alphabet]], with adaptations for Egyptian phonology. It was first developed in the [[Ptolemaic period]], and gradually replaced the Demotic script in about the 4th to 5th centuries of the Christian era.

===Old Egyptian===
[[File:Peribsen2.JPG|thumb|right|Seal impression from the tomb of [[Seth-Peribsen]], containing the oldest known complete sentence in Egyptian]]

The term &quot;Archaic Egyptian&quot; is sometimes reserved for the earliest use of hieroglyphs, from the late fourth through the early third millennia BC. At the earliest stage, around 3300 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Mattessich, [http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/cdm/ref/collection/aah/id/19526 &quot;Oldest writings, and inventory tags of Egypt&quot;], ''Accounting Historians Journal'', 2002, Vol. 29, No. 1, pp. 195–208.&lt;/ref&gt; hieroglyphs were not a fully developed [[writing system]], being at a transitional stage of [[proto-writing]]; over the time leading up to the 27th century BC, grammatical features such as [[Afroasiatic languages#Nisba|nisba]] formation can be seen to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Richard Mattessich|author-link=Richard Mattessich| year=2002|title=The oldest writings, and inventory tags of Egypt|journal=Accounting Historians Journal|jstor=40698264|volume=29|issue=1|pages=195–208|doi=10.2308/0148-4184.29.1.195|url=http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/cdm/ref/collection/aah/id/19526 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen_2f.&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|2013|p=2f.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Old Egyptian is dated from the oldest known complete sentence, including a [[finite verb]], which has been found. Discovered in the tomb of [[Seth-Peribsen]] (dated c. 2690 BC), the seal impression reads:

Extensive texts appear from about 2600 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen_2f.&quot; /&gt; The [[Pyramid Texts]] are the largest body of literature written in this phase of the language. One of its distinguishing characteristics is the tripling of [[ideogram]]s, phonograms, and [[determinative]]s to indicate the plural. Overall, it does not differ significantly from Middle Egyptian, the classical stage of the language, though it is based on a different dialect.

In the period of the 3rd dynasty (c. 2650&amp;nbsp;– c. 2575 BC), many of the principles of hieroglyphic writing were regularized. From that time on, until the script was supplanted by an early version of Coptic (about the third and fourth centuries), the system remained virtually unchanged. Even the number of signs used remained constant at about 700 for more than 2000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hieroglyph {{!}} writing character |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/265009/hieroglyph |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=5 December 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Egyptian===

Middle Egyptian was spoken for about 700 years, beginning around 2000 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;l5&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the classical variant of Egyptian, Middle Egyptian is the best-documented variety of the language, and has attracted the most attention by far from [[Egyptology]]. Whilst most Middle Egyptian is seen written on monuments by hieroglyphs, it was also written using a [[cursive hieroglyphs|cursive variant]], and the related [[hieratic]].&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.archaeology.org/9903/newsbriefs/egypt.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Middle Egyptian first became available to modern scholarship with the [[Decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs|decipherment of hieroglyphs]] in the early 19th century. The first grammar of Middle Egyptian was published by [[Adolf Erman]] in 1894, surpassed in 1927 by [[Alan Gardiner]]'s work. Middle Egyptian has been well-understood since then, although certain points of the [[Egyptian verb|verb]]al inflection remained open to revision until the mid-20th century, notably due to the contributions of [[Hans Jakob Polotsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Polotsky, H. J., '' Études de syntaxe copte'', Société d'Archéologie Copte, Cairo (1944); Polotsky, H. J., '' Egyptian Tenses'', Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, Vol. 2, No. 5 (1965).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Middle Egyptian stage is taken to have ended around the 14th century BC, giving rise to [[Late Egyptian]]. This transition was taking place in the later period of the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt]] (known as the [[Amarna Period]]). 
Middle Egyptian was retained as a literary [[standard language]], and in this usage survived until the Christianisation of [[Roman Egypt]] in the 4th century.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}}

===Late Egyptian===
[[Late Egyptian language|Late Egyptian]], appearing around 1350 BC, is represented by a large body of religious and secular [[Ancient Egyptian literature|literature]], comprising such examples as the ''[[Story of Wenamun]]'', the love poems of the Chester–Beatty I papyrus, and the ''[[Instruction of Any]]''. [[Sebayt|Instructions]] became a popular literary genre of the New Kingdom, which took the form of advice on proper behavior. Late Egyptian was also the language of New Kingdom administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;l7&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, ''op. cit.'', p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hebrew Bible contains some words, terms and names that are thought by scholars to be Egyptian in origin. An example of this is [[Zaphnath-Paaneah]], the Egyptian name given to [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]].

===Demotic and Coptic===
[[Image:Funerary stele Thousei Louvre E27220.jpg|thumb|10th century stela with Coptic inscription, in the [[Louvre]]]]
[[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] is the name given to the Egyptian script used to write both the Egyptian vernacular of the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]] from the eight century BC as well as texts in archaic forms of the language. It was written in a script derived from a northern variety of [[hieratic]] writing. The last evidence of archaic Egyptian in Demotic is a graffito written in 452 BC, but Demotic was used to write vernacular before and in parallel with the Coptic script throughout the early [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] until it was supplanted by the [[Coptic alphabet]] entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=James|authorlink=James Peter Allen|title=Ancient Egyptian Phonology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09LQDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3|date=26 March 2020|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-48555-5|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coptic language|Coptic]] is the name given to the late Egyptian vernacular when it was written in a Greek-based alphabet, the Coptic alphabet; it flourished from the time of [[History of Christianity#Early Christianity (c. 31/33–324)|Early Christianity (c. 31/33–324)]] but first appeared during the [[Hellenistic period]] {{circa|3rd century BC}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=James|authorlink=James Peter Allen|title=Ancient Egyptian Phonology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09LQDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3|date=26 March 2020|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-48555-5|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It survived into the medieval period.

By the 16th century Coptic was dwindling rapidly due to the persecution of Coptic Christians under the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]]. It probably survived in the Egyptian countryside as a spoken language for several centuries after that. Coptic survives as the liturgical language of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] and the [[Coptic Catholic Church]] and, still, as the mother tongue of several families in [[Cairo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Coptic language's last survivors&quot; /&gt;

==Dialects==
Most hieroglyphic Egyptian texts are written in a literary [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige register]] rather than the [[vernacular]] [[Variety (linguistics)|speech variety]] of their author. As a result, dialectical differences are not apparent in written Egyptian until the adoption of the [[Coptic alphabet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;a2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;l8&quot; /&gt; Nevertheless, it is clear that these differences existed before the Coptic period. In one [[Papyrus Anastasi I|Late Egyptian letter]] (dated c. 1200 BC), a scribe jokes that his colleague's writing is incoherent like “the speech of a [[Coptic language#Bohairic|Delta]] man with a man of [[Coptic language#Akhmimic|Elephantine]].”&lt;ref name=&quot;a2&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|2000|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;l8&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, some evidence of internal dialects has been found in pairs of similar words in Egyptian that, based on similarities with later dialects of Coptic, may be derived from northern and southern dialects of Egyptian.&lt;ref name=&quot;s99&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Satzinger|2008|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written Coptic has five major dialects, which differ mainly in graphic conventions, most notably the southern Saidic dialect, the main classical dialect, and the northern Bohairic dialect, currently used in Coptic Church services.&lt;ref name=&quot;a2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;l8&quot; /&gt;

==Writing systems==
Most surviving texts in the Egyptian language are written on stone in [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]]. The native name for Egyptian hieroglyphic writing is ''{{lang|egy|zẖꜣ n mdw-nṯr}}'' (&quot;writing of the gods' words&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4eZvdVOvaU4C&amp;q=%22writing+of+the+gods%27+words%22&amp;pg=PA2|title=Semitic Papyrology in Context: A Climate of Creativity : Papers from a New York University Conference Marking the Retirement of Baruch A. Levine|last=Schiffman|first=Lawrence H.|date=2003-01-01|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-9004128859|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}
In antiquity, most texts were written on perishable [[papyrus]] in hieratic and (later) demotic, which are now lost. There was also a form of [[cursive hieroglyphs]], used for religious documents on papyrus, such as the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' of the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]]; it was simpler to write than the hieroglyphs in stone inscriptions, but it was not as cursive as hieratic and lacked the wide use of [[typographic ligature#History|ligatures]]. Additionally, there was a variety of stone-cut hieratic, known as &quot;lapidary hieratic&quot;.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}
In the language's final stage of development, the [[Coptic alphabet]] replaced the older writing system.

Hieroglyphs are employed in two ways in Egyptian texts: as [[ideogram]]s to represent the idea depicted by the pictures and, more commonly, as [[phonogram (linguistics)|phonograms]] to represent their [[phonetics|phonetic]] value.

As the phonetic realisation of Egyptian cannot be known with certainty, Egyptologists use a system of [[Transliteration of Ancient Egyptian|transliteration]] to denote each sound that could be represented by a uniliteral hieroglyph.&lt;ref name=&quot;a13&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|2000|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
{{Further|Transliteration of Ancient Egyptian}}
While the consonantal phonology of the Egyptian language may be reconstructed, the exact [[phonetics]] are unknown, and there are varying opinions on how to classify the individual phonemes. In addition, because Egyptian is recorded over a full 2000 years, the Archaic and Late stages being separated by the amount of time that separates [[Old Latin]] from [[Italian language|Modern Italian]], significant phonetic changes must have occurred during that lengthy time frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lipiński |first=E. (Edward) |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/783059625|title=Semitic languages : outline of a comparative grammar|date=2001|publisher=Peeters|isbn=90-429-0815-7|oclc=783059625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phonologically, Egyptian contrasted labial, alveolar, palatal, velar, uvular, pharyngeal, and glottal consonants. Egyptian also contrasted voiceless and emphatic consonants, as with other Afroasiatic languages, but exactly how the emphatic consonants were realised is unknown. Early research had assumed that the opposition in stops was one of voicing, but it is now thought to be either one of [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]] and [[emphatic consonant]]s, as in many Semitic languages, or one of [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] and [[ejective consonant]]s, as in many [[Cushitic languages]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''Egyptian Phonology'', by Carsten Peust, for a review of the history of thinking on the subject; his reconstructions of words are nonstandard.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since vowels were not written until Coptic, reconstructions of the Egyptian vowel system are much more uncertain and rely mainly on evidence from Coptic and records of Egyptian words, especially proper nouns, in other languages/writing systems. Also, scribal errors provide evidence of changes in pronunciation over time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}}

The actual pronunciations reconstructed by such means are used only by a few specialists in the language. For all other purposes, the Egyptological pronunciation is used, but it often bears little resemblance to what is known of how Egyptian was pronounced.

===Consonants===
The following consonants are reconstructed for Archaic (before 2600 BC) and Old Egyptian (2686–2181 BC), with IPA equivalents in square brackets if they differ from the usual transcription scheme:

{{IPAslink|l}} has no independent representation in the hieroglyphic orthography, and it is frequently written as if it were {{IPAslink|n}} or {{IPAslink|r}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;l33&quot; /&gt; That is probably because the standard for written Egyptian is based on a dialect in which {{IPAslink|l}} had merged with other sonorants.&lt;ref name=&quot;l31&quot;/&gt; Also, the rare cases of {{IPAslink|ʔ}} occurring are not represented. The phoneme {{IPAslink|j}} is written as {{angbr IPA|j}} in initial position ({{angbr IPA|jt}} = {{IPA|*/ˈjaːtVj/}} 'father') and immediately after a stressed vowel ({{angbr IPA|bjn}} = {{IPA|*/ˈbaːjin/}} 'bad') and as {{angbr IPA|jj}} word-medially immediately before a stressed vowel ({{angbr|ḫꜥjjk}} = {{IPA|*/χaʕˈjak/}} 'you will appear') and are unmarked word-finally ({{angbr IPA|jt}} = {{IPA|/ˈjaːtVj/}} 'father').&lt;ref name=&quot;l33&quot; /&gt;

In Middle Egyptian (2055–1650 BC), a number of consonantal shifts take place. By the beginning of the Middle Kingdom period, {{IPAslink|z}} and {{IPAslink|s}} had merged, and the graphemes {{angbr|s}} and {{angbr|z}} are used interchangeably.&lt;ref name=&quot;l34&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, {{IPAslink|j}} had become {{IPAslink|ʔ}} word-initially in an unstressed syllable ({{angbr IPA|jwn}} {{IPA|/jaˈwin/}} &gt; {{IPA|*/ʔaˈwin/}} &quot;colour&quot;) and after a stressed vowel ({{angbr|ḥjpw}} {{IPA|*/ˈħujpVw/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ˈħeʔp(Vw)/}} '[the god] Apis').&lt;ref name=&quot;l35&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Late Egyptian (1069–700 BC), the phonemes ''d ḏ g'' gradually merge with their counterparts ''t ṯ k'' ({{angbr|dbn}} {{IPA|*/ˈdiːban/}} &gt; Akkadian transcription ''ti-ba-an'' 'dbn-weight'). Also, ''ṯ ḏ'' often become {{IPA|/t d/}}, but they are retained in many [[lexeme]]s; ''ꜣ'' becomes {{IPAslink|ʔ}}; and {{IPA|/t r j w/}} become {{IPAslink|ʔ}} at the end of a stressed syllable and eventually null word-finally: {{angbr|pḏ.t}} {{IPA|*/ˈpiːɟat/}} &gt; Akkadian transcription -''pi-ta'' 'bow'.&lt;ref name=&quot;l38&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More changes occur in the 1st millennium BC and the first centuries AD, leading to Coptic (1st–17th centuries AD). In Sahidic ''ẖ ḫ ḥ'' had merged into {{coptic|ϣ}} ''š'' (most often from ''ḫ'') and {{coptic|ϩ}} {{IPAslink|h}} (most often ''ẖ ḥ''). Bohairic and Akhmimic are more conservative and have a velar fricative {{IPAslink|x}} ({{coptic|ϧ}} in Bohairic, {{coptic|ⳉ}} in Akhmimic).&lt;ref name=&quot;l41&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pharyngeal ''*ꜥ'' had merged into glottal {{IPAslink|ʔ}} after it had affected the quality of the surrounding vowels.&lt;ref name=&quot;l46&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAslink|ʔ}} is not indicated orthographically unless it follows a stressed vowel; then, it is marked by doubling the vowel letter (except in Bohairic): Akhmimic {{coptic|ⳉⲟⲟⲡ}} {{IPA|/xoʔp/}}, Sahidic and Lycopolitan {{coptic|ϣⲟⲟⲡ}} ''šoʔp'', Bohairic {{coptic|ϣⲟⲡ}} ''šoʔp'' 'to be' &lt; ''ḫpr.w'' *{{IPA|/ˈχapraw/}} 'has become'.&lt;ref name=&quot;l41&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;There is evidence of Bohairic having a phonemic glottal stop: {{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=44}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The phoneme {{coptic|ⲃ}} {{IPAslink|b}} was probably pronounced as a fricative {{IPAblink|β}}, becoming {{coptic|ⲡ}} {{IPAslink|p}} after a stressed vowel in syllables that had been closed in earlier Egyptian (compare {{coptic|ⲛⲟⲩⲃ}} &lt; {{IPA|*/ˈnaːbaw/}} 'gold' and {{coptic|ⲧⲁⲡ}} &lt; *{{IPA|/dib/}} 'horn').&lt;ref name=&quot;l41&quot; /&gt; The phonemes {{IPA|/d g z/}} occur only in [[Greek language|Greek]] loanwords, with rare exceptions triggered by a nearby {{IPA|/n/}}: {{coptic|ⲁⲛⲍⲏⲃⲉ/ⲁⲛⲥⲏⲃⲉ}} &lt; ''ꜥ.t n.t sbꜣ.w'' 'school'.&lt;ref name=&quot;l41&quot; /&gt;

{{Contains special characters|Coptic}}
Earlier ''*d ḏ g q'' are preserved as ejective ''t' c' k' k{{'}}'' before vowels in Coptic. Although the same graphemes are used for the pulmonic stops ({{angbr|{{coptic|ⲧ ϫ ⲕ}}}}), the existence of the former may be inferred because the stops {{angbr|{{coptic|ⲡ ⲧ ϫ ⲕ}}}} {{IPA|/p t c k/}} are allophonically aspirated {{IPA|[pʰ tʰ cʰ kʰ]}} before stressed vowels and [[sonorant]] consonants.&lt;ref name=&quot;l42&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bohairic, the allophones are written with the special graphemes {{angbr|{{coptic|ⲫ ⲑ ϭ ⲭ}}}}, but other dialects did not mark aspiration: Sahidic {{coptic|ⲡⲣⲏ}}, Bohairic {{coptic|ⲫⲣⲏ}} 'the sun'.&lt;ref name=&quot;l42&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;In other dialects, the graphemes are used only for clusters of a stop followed by {{IPAslink|h}} and were not used for aspirates: see {{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=248}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Bohairic does not mark aspiration for reflexes of older ''*d ḏ g q'': Sahidic and Bohairic {{coptic|ⲧⲁⲡ}} {{IPA|*/dib/}} 'horn'.&lt;ref name=&quot;l42&quot; /&gt; Also, the definite article {{coptic|ⲡ}} is unaspirated when the next word begins with a glottal stop: Bohairic {{coptic|ⲡ + ⲱⲡ &gt; ⲡⲱⲡ}} 'the account'.&lt;ref name=&quot;l43&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vowels===
Here is the vowel system reconstructed for earlier Egyptian:

Vowels are always short in unstressed syllables ({{angbr|tpj}} = {{IPA|*/taˈpij/}} 'first') and long in open stressed syllables ({{angbr|rmṯ}} = {{IPA|*/ˈraːmac/}} 'man'), but they can be either short or long in closed stressed syllables ({{angbr|jnn}} = {{IPA|*/jaˈnan/}} 'we', {{angbr|mn}} = {{IPA|*/maːn/}} 'to stay').&lt;ref name=&quot;l36&quot;/&gt;

In the Late [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]], after [[Ramses II]], around 1200 BC, {{IPA|*/ˈaː/}} changes to {{IPA|*/ˈoː/}} (like the [[Canaanite shift]]), {{angbr|ḥrw}} '(the god) Horus' {{IPA|*/ħaːra/}} &gt; {{IPA|*/ħoːrə/}} (Akkadian transcription: -ḫuru).&lt;ref name=&quot;l38&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA|*/uː/}}, therefore, changes to {{IPA|*/eː/}}: {{angbr|šnj}} 'tree' {{IPA|*/ʃuːn(?)j/}} &gt; {{IPA|*/ʃeːnə/}} (Akkadian transcription: -sini).&lt;ref name=&quot;l38&quot; /&gt;

In the Early New Kingdom, short stressed {{IPA|*/ˈi/}} changes to {{IPA|*/ˈe/}}: {{angbr|mnj}} &quot;[[Menes]]&quot; {{IPA|*/maˈnij/}} &gt; {{IPA|*/maˈneʔ/}} (Akkadian transcription: ma-né-e).&lt;ref name=&quot;l38&quot; /&gt; Later, probably 1000–800 BC, a short stressed {{IPA|*/ˈu/}} changes to {{IPA|*/ˈe/}}: {{angbr|ḏꜥn.t}} &quot;[[Tanis]]&quot; {{IPA|*/ˈɟuʕnat/}} was borrowed into Hebrew as *ṣuʕn but would become transcribed as {{angbr|ṣe-e'-nu/ṣa-a'-nu}} during the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;l39&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unstressed vowels, especially after a stress, become {{IPA|*/ə/}}: {{angbr|nfr}} 'good' {{IPA|*/ˈnaːfir/}} &gt; {{IPA|*/ˈnaːfə/}} (Akkadian transcription -na-a-pa).&lt;ref name=&quot;l39&quot; /&gt; {{IPA|*/iː/}} changes to {{IPA|*/eː/}} next to {{IPA|/ʕ/}} and {{IPA|/j/}}: {{angbr|wꜥw}} 'soldier' {{IPA|*/wiːʕiw/}} &gt; {{IPA|*/weːʕə/}} (earlier Akkadian transcription: ú-i-ú, later: ú-e-eḫ).&lt;ref name=&quot;l39&quot; /&gt;

In Sahidic and Bohairic Coptic, Late Egyptian stressed {{IPA|*/ˈa/}} becomes {{IPA|*/ˈo/}} and {{IPA|*/ˈe/}} becomes {{IPA|/ˈa/}}, but are unchanged in the other dialects: {{angbr|sn}} {{IPA|*/san/}} 'brother' &gt; Sahaidic and Bohairic {{angbr|son}}, Akhminic, Lycopolitan and Fayyumic {{angbr|san}}; {{angbr|rn}} 'name' {{IPA|*/rin/}} &gt; {{IPA|*/ren/}} &gt; Sahaidic and Bohairic {{angbr|ran}}, Akhminic, Lycopolitan and Fayyumic {{angbr|ren}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;l46&quot;/&gt; However, Sahaidic and Bohairic preserve {{IPA|*/ˈa/}}, and Fayyumic renders it as {{angbr|e}} in the presence of guttural fricatives: {{angbr|ḏbꜥ}} 'ten thousand' {{IPA|*/ˈbaʕ/}} &gt; Sahaidic, Akhmimic and Lycopolitan {{angbr|tba}}, Bohairic {{angbr|tʰba}}, Fayyumic {{angbr|tbe}}. In Akhmimic and Lycopolitan, {{IPA|*/ˈa/}} becomes {{IPA|/ˈo/}} before etymological {{IPA|/ʕ, ʔ/}}: {{angbr|jtrw}} 'river' {{IPA|*/ˈjatraw/}} &gt; 
{{IPA|*/jaʔr(ə)/}} &gt; Sahaidic {{angbr|eioor(e)}}, Bohairic {{angbr|ior}}, Akhminic {{angbr|ioore, iôôre}}, Fayyumic {{angbr|iaal, iaar}}. Similarly, the diphthongs {{IPA|*/ˈaj/}}, {{IPA|*/ˈaw/}}, which normally have reflexes {{IPA|/ˈoj/}}, {{IPA|/ˈow/}} in Sahidic and are preserved in other dialects, are in Bohairic {{angbr|ôi}} (in non-final position) and {{angbr|ôou}} respectively: &quot;to me, to them&quot; Sahidic {{angbr|eroi, eroou}}, Akhminic and Lycopolitan {{angbr|arai, arau}}, Fayyumic {{angbr|elai, elau}}, Bohairic {{angbr|eroi, erôou}}. Sahidic and Bohairic preserve {{IPA|*/ˈe/}} before {{IPA|/ʔ/}} (etymological or from lenited {{IPA|/t r j/}} or tonic-syllable coda {{IPA|/w/}}),: Sahidic and Bohairic {{angbr|ne}} {{IPA|/neʔ/}} 'to you (fem.)' &lt; {{IPA|*/ˈnet/}} &lt; {{IPA|*/ˈnic/}}. {{IPA|*/e/}} may also have different reflexes before [[sonorant]]s, near [[sibilant]]s and in diphthongs.&lt;ref name=&quot;l47&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Old {{IPA|*/aː/}} surfaces as {{IPA|/uː/}} after nasals and occasionally other consonants: {{angbr|nṯr}} 'god' {{IPA|*/ˈnaːcar/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ˈnuːte/}} {{angbr|noute}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA|/uː/}} has acquired phonemic status, as is evidenced by minimal pairs like 'to approach' {{angbr|hôn}} {{IPA|/hoːn/}} &lt; {{IPA|*/ˈçaːnan/}} ẖnn vs. 'inside' {{angbr|houn}} {{IPA|/huːn/}} &lt; {{IPA|*/ˈçaːnaw/}} ẖnw.&lt;ref name=&quot;l48&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; An etymological {{IPA|*/uː/}} &gt; {{IPA|*/eː/}} often surfaces as {{IPA|/iː/}} next to {{IPA|/r/}} and after etymological pharyngeals: {{angbr|hir}} &lt; {{IPA|*/χuːr/}} 'street' (Semitic loan).&lt;ref name=&quot;l48&quot; /&gt;

Most Coptic dialects have two phonemic vowels in unstressed position. Unstressed vowels generally became {{IPA|/ə/}}, written as {{angbr|e}} or null ({{angbr|i}} in Bohairic and Fayyumic word-finally), but pretonic unstressed /a/ occurs as a reflex of earlier unstressed {{IPA|*/e/}} near an etymological pharyngeal, velar or sonorant ('to become many' {{angbr|ašai}} &lt; ꜥšꜣ {{IPA|*/ʕiˈʃiʀ/}}) or an unstressed {{IPA|*/a/}}. Pretonic [i] is underlyingly {{IPA|/əj/}}: Sahidic 'ibis' {{angbr|hibôi}} &lt; h(j)bj.w {{IPA|*/hijˈbaːj?w/}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;l48&quot; /&gt;

Thus, the following is the Sahidic vowel system c. AD 400:

===Phonotactics===
Earlier Egyptian has the syllable structure CV(:)(C) in which V is long in open stressed syllables and short elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;l36&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, CV:C or CVCC can occur in word-final, stressed position.&lt;ref name=&quot;l36&quot; /&gt; However, CV:C occurs only in the infinitive of biconsonantal verbal roots, CVCC only in some plurals.&lt;ref name=&quot;l36&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;l39&quot; /&gt;

In later Egyptian, stressed CV:C, CVCC, and CV become much more common because of the loss of final dentals and glides.&lt;ref name=&quot;l39&quot;/&gt;

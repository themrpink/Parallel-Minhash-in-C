'''Corn soup''' is a [[soup]] made of [[maize|corn]], typically [[sweetcorn]]. Initially popular only in corn-producing areas of the world, the dish is now widespread because of greater corn distribution. Typical ingredients are corn cut from the cob, water, butter and flour, with salt and pepper for seasoning. Additional ingredients vary by region, and may include eggs.

== Native Americans ==
Corn, being a staple crop for many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes has led to corn soup being a primary food among them.  M. R. Harrington reported that 1908 hulled-corn soup ''o&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;no'kwǎ''' was the most popular dish for the [[Seneca tribe|Seneca]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]]. He also stated, &quot;[s]eldom do the Indians, [[Paganism|pagan]] or [[Christianity|Christian]], meet for any function [...] without a kettle of o&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;no'kwǎ', hot and savory, to regale the crowd&quot;. The soup was served at religious events, the people getting a ladleful every time they encircled the kettle.&lt;ref&gt;M. R. Harrington. ''Some Seneca Corn-Foods and Their Preparation''. American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 10, No. 4. (Oct. - Dec., 1908), pp. 575-590. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/659688 Stable URL]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clam soup''' is a soup prepared using [[clam]]s as a primary ingredient. Clam soup can be prepared as a thin, [[broth]]- or cream/milk-based soup and as a thicker, [[chowder]]-style soup. In Japan, hot [[miso soup]] prepared with clams is believed by some to be a cure for the [[hangover]].

==Overview==
Clam soup is prepared using [[clam]]s as a main ingredient. Additional ingredients can include carrot, celery, onion and other vegetables, vegetable [[broth]] or [[stock (food)|stock]] or other types of broths and stocks (such as fish stock)&lt;ref name=&quot;Farmer 1896&quot;/&gt; seasonings and spices, salt and pepper. Fresh or canned clams can be used to prepare the dish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldthwaite Cognard-Black Nestle 2014&quot;/&gt; [[Clam chowder]] is a well-known clam soup, but not all clam soups are [[chowder]]s or have the thick consistency that chowders typically possess.

In Japan, hot [[miso soup]] with clams is a traditional cure for the [[hangover]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bellomo 2015&quot;/&gt; Clams possess high levels of [[ornithine]], an [[amino acid]] that some Japanese people believe serves to reduce levels of stress, and &quot;helps improve liver function—including detoxifying harmful substances like alcohol.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bellomo 2015&quot;/&gt; A canned clam soup product named &quot;Power of 70&quot; claims to cure hangovers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bellomo 2015&quot;/&gt;

==Varieties==
===Clam chowder===
[[File:Clam chowder with whole clams.jpg|thumb|[[Clam chowder]] with whole clams]]
[[Clam chowder]] is a clam soup prepared as a [[chowder]], typically using a cream base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warshaw 2015&quot;/&gt; Several varieties of clam chowder exist. [[Manhattan clam chowder]] is a tomato-based soup prepared with vegetables and clams, but lacks cream or milk.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warshaw 2015&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Voltz 1972&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Correa 2016&quot;/&gt;

===Jaecheop-guk===

[[Jaecheop-guk]] is a clear [[Korean cuisine|Korean soup]] made with small [[freshwater]] [[clam]]s called ''jaecheop'' (재첩, ''[[Corbicula leana]]''). It is a local specialty of the [[Gyeongsang Province]] where ''jaecheop'' are harvested, such as the lower reaches of [[Nakdong River]], and river basins around [[Gimhae]], Myeongji, Eumgung, and [[Hadan]] counties&lt;ref name=&quot;triptokorea&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.triptokorea.com/english/viewtopic.php?t=4248 |title=Jaecheopguk (edile cockle soup) |publisher=triptokorea.com |access-date=2017-03-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717104911/http://english.triptokorea.com/english/viewtopic.php?t=4248 |archive-date=2011-07-17 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as places near the [[Suyeong River]] in [[Busan]] and the [[Seomjin River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Doosan&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyber.com/search_w/ctdetail.php?masterno=780473&amp;contentno=780473 |title=Jaecheopguk (재첩국) |publisher=[[Doosan Encyber]] |language=Korean |accessdate=2008-05-25 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chicken soup''' is a [[soup]] made from [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], simmered in water, usually with various other ingredients. The classic chicken soup consists of a clear [[broth|chicken broth]], often with pieces of chicken or vegetables; common additions are [[pasta]], [[noodle]]s, [[dumpling]]s, or grains such as [[rice]] and [[barley]]. Chicken soup has acquired the reputation of a [[Home remedy|folk remedy]] for [[common cold|colds]] and [[influenza]], and in many countries is considered a [[comfort food]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fisher-BBC&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/will-chicken-soup-really-cure-your-cold|title=Will chicken soup really cure your cold?|first=Roxanne|last=Fisher|website=BBC Good Food|language=en|access-date=2019-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Humans were already boiling food by the time that [[Domestic fowl|chicken was domesticated]] in the [[neolithic|neolithic period]], so it is likely that chickens were being boiled for soup.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Zielinski, &quot;Stone Age Stew? Soup Making May Be Older Than We'd Thought&quot;, ''The Salt'', National Public Radio, [https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2013/02/06/171104410/stone-age-stew-soup-making-may-be-older-than-wed-thought February 6, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Modern American chicken soup, which typically includes root vegetables including carrot, onion, leeks and celery, was a staple across Northern Europe and was brought to the United States by immigrants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moskin-NYT&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/dining/chicken-noodle-soup-recipe-video.html|title=A Superior Chicken Soup|last=Moskin|first=Julia|date=2016-11-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-02-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==

Variations on the flavor are gained by adding [[root vegetable]]s such as parsnip, potato, [[sweet potato]] and celery root, herbs such as parsley, dill, other vegetables such as zucchini, whole garlic cloves, lettuce, or tomatoes and black pepper. The soup should be brought slowly to a boil and then simmered in a covered pot on a very low flame for one to three hours, adding water if necessary. A clearer broth is achieved by skimming the drops of fat off the top of the soup as it is cooking, first bringing the chicken to boil from a pot of cold water and discarding the water before continuing, or straining it through a strainer or cheesecloth. [[Saffron]] or [[turmeric]] are sometimes added as a yellow colorant. Then the chicken can be shredded by hand and stored in the refrigerator until ready for use in the soup.

==Nutritional value==
Chicken soup can be a relatively [[Diet food|low fat]] food: fat can be removed by chilling the soup after cooking and skimming the layer of congealed fat from the top.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theforkedspoon.com/homemade-chicken-noodle-soup/|title=Homemade Chicken Noodle Soup Recipe|last=Randhawa|first=Jessica|date=May 14, 2019|work=The Forked Spoon|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study determined that &quot;prolonged cooking of a bone in soup increases the calcium content of the soup when cooked at an acidic, but not at a neutral pH&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chicken soup revisited: Calcium content of soup increases with duration of cooking|author=H. N. Rosen | doi=10.1007/BF00334329|volume=54|issue=6|journal=Calcified Tissue International|pages=486–488 |year= 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Strictly speaking, '''chicken soup''', unless qualified, implies that the [[soup]] is served as a thin broth, with pieces of meat, and possibly vegetables, and either noodles, rice, barley, or dumplings.

'''[[List of soups#Cream|Cream of chicken soup]]''' is a thick, creamy, soup made with chicken stock and pieces, combined with milk (or cream) and flour, which might contain vegetable pieces, depending on the recipe. [[File:Cream of Chicken Soup.jpg|thumb|Cream of Chicken Soup]]

Several terms are used when referring to chicken soups:

*'''Chicken [[broth]]''' is the liquid part of chicken soup. Broth can be served as is, or used as stock, or served as soup with noodles. Broth can be milder than stock, does not need to be boiled as long, and can be made with meatier chicken parts.
*'''Chicken [[Bouillon (broth)|bouillon]]''' or '''bouillon de poulet''' is the French term for chicken broth.
*'''Chicken [[consommé]]''' is a more refined chicken broth. It is usually strained to perfect clarity, and reduced to concentrate it.
*'''Chicken [[stew]]''' is a more substantial dish with a higher ratio of solids to broth. The broth may also be thickened toward a [[gravy]]-like consistency with a [[roux]] or by adding [[flour]]-based [[dumpling]]s ([[matzah ball]]s do not have the same thickening effect).
*'''Chicken [[Stock (food)|stock]]''' is a liquid in which chicken bones and vegetables have been simmered for the purpose of serving as an ingredient in more complex dishes. Chicken stock is not usually served as is. Stock can be made with less palatable parts of the chicken, such as feet, necks or bones: the higher bone content in these parts contributes more [[gelatin]] to the liquid, making it a better base for sauces. Stock can be reboiled and reused as the basis for a new stock. [[Bouillon cube]]s or [[soup base]] are often used instead of chicken stock prepared from scratch.

==Medicinal properties==
Chicken soup has long been touted as a form of [[folk medicine]] to treat symptoms of the [[common cold]] and related conditions. In 2000, scientists at the [[University of Nebraska Medical Center]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]] studied the effect of chicken soup on the [[inflammatory response]] ''[[in vitro]]''. They found that some components of the chicken soup inhibit [[neutrophil]] migration, which may have an [[anti-inflammatory]] effect that could ''hypothetically'' lead to temporary ease from symptoms of illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rennard BO, Ertl RF, Gossman GL, Robbins RA, Rennard SI |title=Chicken soup inhibits neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro |journal=Chest |volume=118 |issue=4 |pages=1150–7 |date=October 2000 |pmid=11035691 |doi=10.1378/chest.118.4.1150 |url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11035691 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120801120335/http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11035691 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-08-01 |citeseerx=10.1.1.584.6659 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since these results have been obtained from purified cells (and directly applied), the diluted soup ''[[in vivo]]'' effect is debatable. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewed the University of Nebraska study, among others, in 2007 and concluded that &quot;none of the research is conclusive, and it is not known whether the changes measured in the laboratory really have a meaningful effect on people with cold symptoms.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Parker-Pope, Tara (2007), [http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/12/the-science-of-chicken-soup/ &quot;The Science of Chicken Soup&quot;] (12 October issue).&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been shown that chicken soup contains the [[amino acid]] [[cysteine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-01-10/entertainment/9601100333_1_chicken-soup-respiratory-infections-cold-symptoms | work=Chicago Tribune | first=Bob | last=Condor | title=Strategies To Help You Survive The Cold Season | date=10 January 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is very similar to [[acetylcysteine]], which is used by doctors for patients with [[bronchitis]] and other respiratory infections to help clear them.

Chicken soup is also known as &quot;[[Jews|Jewish]] penicillin&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oliver|first=Jamie|title=Jewish penicillin|work=Jamieoliver.com|url=http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/chicken-recipes/jewish-penicillin/|access-date=2016-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; either as [[ersatz good]] [[penicillin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wex|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Wex|title=Rhapsody in Schmaltz: Yiddish Food and Why We Can't Stop Eating It|page=177|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2016|isbn=9781466882652|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uOaUCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA177|quote=To call chicken soup “Jewish penicillin” is to point to its limitations, not its virtues.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as alternative to penicillin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bratskeir|first=Kate|title=Chicken Soup Really Is 'Jewish Penicillin' For Your Cold.

==In different cultures==

===China===
Many [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] soups are based on [[chicken broth]]. Typical Chinese chicken soup is made from old hens and is seasoned with [[ginger]], [[scallion]]s, [[black pepper]], [[soy sauce]], [[rice wine]] and [[sesame oil]]. A more elaborate version can be made from freshly killed old hen and various herbs such as [[ginseng]], dried [[wolfberry|goji]], and old ginger root. The soup is then boiled for hours.

===Colombia===
[[File:Ajiaco.jpg|230px|thumb|right|[[Ajiaco]] of [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]]]]
[[Bogotá]], [[Cuisine of Colombia|Colombia's]] capital, is known for a version of chicken soup called ''[[ajiaco]]''. Along with chicken, ''ajiaco'' typically includes [[maize]], three types of [[potato]]es, [[avocado]], [[caper]]s, an herb called ''[[Galinsoga parviflora|guascas]]'', and is served with a dollop of [[cream]].

[[Sancocho]] de Gallina is another popular dish throughout Colombia and in neighboring countries. This is a broth that includes entire pieces of (often rather tough) soup hen [[Meat on the bone|on the bone]] with large pieces of [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]], potato, [[cassava]] and/or other vegetables.

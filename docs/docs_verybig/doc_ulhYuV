The '''morality play''' is a [[genre]] of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[Tudor porn|early Tudor]] theatrical entertainment. In their own time, these plays were known as '''''interludes''''', a broader term for dramas with or without a [[moral]].&lt;ref&gt;Richardson and Johnston (1991, 97-98).&lt;/ref&gt; Morality plays are a type of [[allegory]] in which the [[protagonist]] is met by [[personification]]s of various [[morality|moral]] attributes who try to prompt them to choose a good life over one of evil. The plays were most popular in [[Europe]] during the 15th and 16th centuries. Having grown out of the religiously based [[mystery play]]s of the Middle Ages, they represented a shift towards a more secular base for European theatre. [[Hildegard von Bingen]]'s ''[[Ordo Virtutum]]'' (English: &quot;Order of the Virtues&quot;) composed c. 1151, is the earliest known morality play by more than a century, and the only Medieval musical drama to survive with an attribution for both the text and the music.

==Characteristics==
Morality plays typically contain a protagonist who represents either humanity as a whole or a smaller social structure. Supporting characters are personifications of good and evil. This alignment of characters provides the play’s audience with moral guidance. Morality plays are the result of the dominant belief of the time period, that humans had a certain amount of control over their post-death fate while they were on earth.&lt;ref&gt;King, Pamela M. &quot;Morality Plays&quot;. ''The Cambridge Companion to Medieval English Theatre''. Ed. Richard Beadle. Cambridge: Cambridge U P, 1994. 235. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Everyman (play)|Everyman]]'', perhaps the archetypal morality play, the characters take on the common pattern, representing broader ideas. Some of the characters in ''Everyman'' are God, Death, Everyman, Good-Deeds, Angel, Knowledge, Beauty, Discretion, and Strength. The personified meanings of these characters are hardly hidden. The premise of ''Everyman'' is that God, believing that the people on earth are too focused on wealth and worldly possessions, sends Death to Everyman to remind him of God's power and the importance of upholding values.&lt;ref&gt;''Everyman and Other Miracle and Morality Plays''. Ed. Stanley Appelbaum and Candace Ward. New York: Dover Publications, 1995. 36-59. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis put on morality, the seemingly vast difference between good and evil, and the strong presence of God makes ''Everyman'' one of the most concrete examples of a morality play. At the same time, most morality plays focus more on evil, while ''Everyman'' focuses more on good, highlighting sin in contrast.&lt;ref&gt;King, Pamela M. &quot;Morality Plays&quot;. ''The Cambridge Companion to Medieval English Theatre''. Ed. Richard Beadle. Cambridge: Cambridge U P, 1994. 257. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Only five English morality plays from the medieval period are extant: ''[[The Castle of Perseverance]]'' (c.1425); ''[[Wisdom (play)|Wisdom]]'', (1460-63); ''[[Mankind (play)|Mankind]]'' (c.1470); ''[[Everyman (play)|Everyman]]'' (c.1495); the fragmentary ''Pride of Life'' (late 14th century).&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Medieval Literature, &quot;Morality Play,&quot; Online: https://medieval_literature.enacademic.com/422/morality_play&lt;/ref&gt;

Other plays that take on the typical traits of morality plays, but are rarely given the title of &quot;morality play&quot; are ''Hickscorner'' and ''The Second Shepherds' Play.'' The characters in ''Hickscorner'' are Pity, Perseverance, Imagination, Contemplation, Freewill, and Hickscorner. They blatantly represent moral ideals.&lt;ref&gt;
Everyman and Other Miracle and Morality Plays. Ed. Stanley Appelbaum and Candace Ward. New York: Dover Publications, 1995. 60. Print.
&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Second Shepherds' Play'', the characters are less obviously representative of good and evil, being primarily a trio of shepherds. But other characters such as Mary, The Child Christ, and An Angel show a strong moral presence and the importance of God in the play.&lt;ref&gt;

==Justice and Equity as characters==
In early English dramas [[Justice]] was personified as an entity which exercised “theological virtue or grace, and was concerned with the divine pronouncement of judgment on man”.&lt;ref&gt;McCutchan, J. Wilson. &quot;Justice and Equity in the English Morality Play.&quot;Journal of the History of Ideas. 19.3 (1958): 406.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as time progressed, more moralities began to emerge; it is during this transitional period where one begins to see [[Justice]] begin to assume more and more the qualities of a judge.  The Justice in ''Respublica'' begins to concern himself with administering justice on “the criminal element”, rather than with the divine pronouncement on a generic representative of mankind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Respublica 1905&quot;&gt;''Respublica'', ed. by Leonard A. Magnus (London, 1905), Extra Series XCIV.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first instance where one may observe a direct divergence from the theological virtues and concerns that were previously exerted by Justice in the morality plays of the fifteenth century. The Justice in ''Respublica'' is personified as a “civil force rather than a theological one”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Respublica 1905&quot;/&gt; An evolution of sorts takes place within the morals and agendas of Justice: he begins to don the Judicial Robe of prosecutor and executioner.

Another change envelops in the character of Justice during the sixteenth century in morality plays; [[Equity (law)|Equity]] replaces Justice and assumes the judiciary duties previously performed by Justice. This changing of rulers, or preceding justices, is done when Equity declares that his brother Justice has been banished from the country and that he (Equity) will from now on take on the duties of the former monarch, Justice.&lt;ref&gt;McCutchan, J. Wilson . &quot;Justice and Equity in the English Morality Play.&quot;Journal of the History of Ideas. 19.3 (1958): 408.&lt;/ref&gt; This change of ruling heads is portrayed in the morality play, ''Liberality and Prodigality'', where Equity serves Virtue in the detection, arrest, and punishment of Prodigality for the robbery and murder of Tenacity, a yeoman in the country of Middlesex.&lt;ref&gt;''Liberality and Prodigality'', in ''A Select Collection of Old English Plays''. ed. by W. Carew Hazlitt (London, 1874), VIII, 329-83.&lt;/ref&gt; Virtue states,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
So horrible a fact can hardly pleaded for favour:&lt;br /&gt;
Therefore go you, Equity, examine more diligently&lt;br /&gt;
The manner of this outrageous robbery:&lt;br /&gt;
And as the same by examination shall appear,&lt;br /&gt;
Due justice may be done in presence here.&lt;br /&gt; (''Liberality and Prodigality'' 377)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The meta phases that Justice undergoes during the sixteenth century in morality plays, from “Justice” to “Equity” further illustrates the evolution of Justice; not only did Justice change from a “theological abstraction to a civil servant”,&lt;ref&gt;McCutchan, J. Wilson . &quot;Justice and Equity in the English Morality Play.&quot;Journal of the History of Ideas. 19.3 (1958): 409.&lt;/ref&gt; but he experienced a corporeal change as well.

One may readily observe the evolutionary progression of Justice as portrayed in the plays of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. One encounters Justice in the early-fifteenth-century moralities as a performer playing the role of a theological virtue or grace, and then one sees him develop to a more serious figure, occupying the position of an arbiter of justice during the sixteenth century. It is a journey of discovery and great change on which Justice welcomes one to embark as one leafs through the pages of morality plays.

==Pre-Reformation versus post-Reformation==
Although the purpose of all morality plays is to instruct listeners on the means of receiving redemption, morality plays after the [[Protestant Reformation]] are of a distinctly different [[didacticism]] than the morality plays before the Reformation.

Morality plays before the Reformation teach a [[Catholic Church |Catholic]] approach to redemption, with an emphasis on works and the sacraments, a view originating with [[Tertullian]] (c. 155 – c. 240 AD) and [[Cyprian]] (d. 258). The emphasis on works can be seen in the final speech in one of the most well-known of medieval morality plays, [[Everyman (play)|Everyman]], in which there is a clear statement about the necessity of good works for the one who desires heaven:
&lt;poem&gt; 
Doctor:  This moral men may have in mind;
Ye hearers, take it of worth, old and young,
And forsake pride, for he deceiveth you in the end,
And remember Beauty, Five-wits, Strength, and Discretion,
They all at last do Everyman forsake,
Save his Good-Deeds, there doth he take.
But beware, and they be small
Before God, he hath no help at all.
None excuse may be there for Everyman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cawley |first=A. C.|title=Everyman and Medieval Miracle Plays |date=1974 |publisher= Dent |location=London |isbn=978-0-460-87280-5 |page =225}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
The importance of the sacraments is seen in the morality tale entitled [[Mankind (play)|Mankind]].  In this play, the [[sacrament of penance]] is emphasized when the allegorical character Mercy speaks to Mankind:  “Come let us go to this cloister and incline your mind towards God.  Don’t sin thinking that you are assured mercy, that itself is a sin.  It’s not a good idea to take advantage of the Lord.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= McDonald |first1= Rick |title= Modern English Translation of Mankind |url= http://research.uvu.edu/mcdonald/3610/mankind.html |publisher =Utah Valley University|accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Pre-Reformation plays emphasized the importance of the [[sacraments of the Catholic Church]] (such as partaking in mass and baptism), the church clergy, the church hierarchy, the church establishment in general, and the abstinence from the [[Seven Deadly Sins]]. Many of the morality tales were [[allegory |allegories]] and involved characters with names of Vices (e.g., Gluttony) and Virtues (e.g., Goodness).  Their purpose was to direct the playgoers to pursue virtue and renounce vice.

Frequently a character representing a Vice would state, upon his first appearance, that he was evil.  For example, in [[The Castle of Perseverance]], a character called Lust-Liking states:
&lt;poem&gt;
Lo, me! here ready Lord, to fare and to flee
To seek thee a servant valued and dear!
Whoso will by Folly ruled be, 
He is worthy to be a servant here,
Who slips into the Sins Seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Johnston |first =Alexandra F.|title=The Castle of Perseverance: A Modernization |url= http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~ajohnsto/cascomp.html |website= Computing in the Humanities and Social Sciences |publisher= University of Toronto|accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
Even after this initial introduction, however, the Vice will continually reiterate to the audience that his nature is diabolic. Very often, the Vice presented will bring his character into criticism by the manner in which he presents himself to his audience, thus further demonstrating his wickedness. For example, the Vices in the earlier morality plays often spoke using vulgar language and by blasphemous swearing.  Often, these curses were spoken in [[Latin]], which being considered the holy language, made these curses even more offensive to the audience.  Moreover, the Vices often made a mockery of religious practices sacred to the audience, thereby castigating themselves in the eyes of their audience. Deceit is another means by which the Vice exposes his wickedness to the audience and serves as an example to them of what to avoid in a righteous life. Furthermore, in the pre-Reformation play, the Vices denounce their own characters by acting violently toward each other and toward the Virtues.&lt;ref name= &quot;Pineas, Rainer 1962&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Pineas | first = Rainer | title = The English Morality Play as a Weapon of Religious Controversy | journal = Studies in English Literature | volume = 2 | number = 2 | year = 1962 | pages = 157–80 | publisher = JSTOR | format = Web | doi = 10.2307/449497 | jstor = 449497 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas the pre-Reformation morality plays sought to reinforce the establishment of the Catholic Church and Catholic doctrine, the post-Reformation morality plays worked to destroy Catholic credibility and demonise the Catholic Church.  Although post-Reformation morality plays were like its predecessor in that it also was concerned with the salvation of its audience, it differed in that it believed that the theology promoted by pre-Reformation plays was antithetical to salvation. Thus, a major shift in focus, from concern for the individual’s moral behaviour to concern for the individual's theological practices, occurred with the post-Reformation morality plays. The wave of [[Protestantism]] which fuelled the content of these plays dictated that more attention should be given to warning people against the Catholic Church than of their sinful nature.  The means of redemption, according to the philosophy embedded in post-Reformation morality plays, is dependent upon the audience understanding the truthfulness of Protestant theology and verses and also the deceptiveness and wickedness of Catholic theology, whose best example is the secular play of Calderón.&lt;ref name=&quot;Muratta Bunsen, Eduardo 2014&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Muratta Bunsen | first = Eduardo | title = Leidenschaft des Zweifelns: Skepsis und Probabilismus in den Säkulardramen von Pedro Calderón de la Barca | language = de | publisher = FU | place = Berlin, DE | url = http://www.geisteswissenschaften.fu-berlin.de/we05/forschung/dissertationen/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vices in post-Reformation morality plays are almost always depicted as being Catholic. At times this depiction is achieved through their physical appearance. For example, Vices in post-Reformation morality plays would be dressed as cardinals, friars, monks, or the pope. Other times, the Vice comes out and states he is a Catholic, or elucidates that he is Catholic by swearing a Catholic pledge.  Oftentimes, the Vice in post-Reformation plays admits that Catholic theology is flawed, and that by being Catholic the Vice is committing treason.  Moreover, Vices often appear ignorant and naive, especially when it comes to their biblical understanding and knowledge of the [[New Testament]]. Often, morality plays coming out of the post-Reformation period ridicule ritualistic Catholic practices. Furthermore, these plays postulated that Catholics were opposed to moral behaviour and truthfulness, and that the Catholic Church warped the text of the Bible to justify sinning. To deceive the victim of post-Reformation morality plays, the Vice typically assumes a new name to disguise what actual Vice he is.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Because the Vice is aggressively tied to Catholicism from the outset of the play, when the Vice is reprimanded and damned, so are his Catholic beliefs. Therefore, the Vice served as a central component to discrediting the Catholic Church in post-Reformation morality plays.&lt;ref name= &quot;Pineas, Rainer 1962&quot; /&gt;

The role of the Virtues in post-Reformation morality plays was to preach a message of salvation based upon an individual’s faith and the grace of God. They promoted Protestant beliefs of [[original sin]], the importance of bible reading and meditation, the marriage of clergymen, and the cleansing of sin only through Christ’s sacrifice; at the same time, they discredited the Catholic belief in [[transubstantiation]].&lt;ref name= &quot;Pineas, Rainer 1962&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Chain-link and barbed wire.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Razor wire—long-barb type on top of a [[chain link fence|chain link privacy-fence]] surrounding a utility power sub-station]]

'''Barbed tape''' or '''razor wire''' is a mesh of metal strips with sharp edges whose purpose is to prevent passage by humans. The term &quot;razor wire&quot;, through long usage, has generally been used to describe barbed tape products. Razor wire is much sharper than the standard [[barbed wire]]; it is named after its appearance but is not [[razor]] sharp. The points are very sharp and made to rip and snag clothing and flesh.

The multiple blades of a razor-wire fence are designed to inflict serious cuts on anyone attempting to climb through and therefore have a strong psychological [[deterrence (psychology)|deterrent]] effect. Razor wire is used in many high-security applications because, although it can be circumvented relatively quickly by humans with tools, penetrating a razor-wire barrier without tools is very slow and difficult, giving security forces more time to respond.

== Use ==
[[File:Tuolsleng3.jpg|thumb|right|Short barb razor wire at [[Tuol Sleng]]]]

Starting in the late 1960s, barbed tape was typically found in prisons and secure [[mental hospital]]s, where the increased breaching time for a poorly equipped potential escapee was a definite advantage. Until the development of reinforced barbed tape in the early 1980s (and especially after the September 11, 2001 attacks), it was rarely used for military purposes or genuine high security facilities because, with the correct tools, it was easier to breach than barbed wire. Since then some military forces have replaced barbed wire with barbed tape for many applications, mainly because it is slightly lighter for the same effective coverage and it takes up very little space compared to barbed wire or reinforced barbed tape when stored on drums.

More recently barbed tape has been used in more commercial and residential security applications. This is often primarily a visual deterrent since a well-prepared burglar can breach barbed wire and barbed tape barriers in similar amounts of time, using simple techniques such as cutting the wire or throwing a piece of carpet over its strands.

Due to its dangerous nature, razor wire/barbed tape and similar fencing/barrier materials is prohibited in some locales. Norway prohibits any barbed wire except in combination with other fencing, in order to protect domesticated animals from exposure.&lt;ref&gt;§ 15 in Lov om dyrevelferd (Animal welfare law). Accessed November 5th, 2018, at https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2009-06-19-97/KAPITTEL_1#%C2%A715&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==

Razor wire has a central strand of high [[tensile strength]] wire, and a steel tape punched into a shape with barbs. The steel tape is then cold-[[crimp (joining)|crimp]]ed tightly to the wire everywhere except for the barbs. Flat barbed tape is very similar, but has no central reinforcement wire. The process of combining the two is called roll forming.

=== Types ===
Like barbed wire, razor wire is available as either straight wire, spiral (helical) coils, concertina (clipped) coils, flat wrapped panels or welded mesh panels. Unlike barbed wire, which usually is available only as plain steel or [[hot-dip galvanizing|galvanized]], barbed tape razor wire is also manufactured in [[stainless steel]] to reduce corrosion from rusting. The core wire can be galvanized and the tape stainless, although fully stainless barbed tape is used for permanent installations in harsh climatic environments or under water.

Barbed tape is also characterized by the shape of the barbs. Although there are no formal definitions, typically '''short barb''' barbed tape has barbs from 10-mm to 12-mm long, '''medium barb''' tape has barbs 20-mm to 22-mm long, and '''long barb''' tape has barbs from 60 to 66-mm long.

==== According to the structure ====
* '''Helical type:''' Helical type razor wire is the most simple pattern. There are no concertina attachments and each spiral loop is left. It shows a natural spiral freely.
* '''Concertina type:''' It is the most widely used type in the security defense applications. The adjacent loops of helical coils are attached by clips at specified points on the circumference. It shows an accordion-like configuration condition.
* '''Blade type:''' The razor wire are produced in straight lines and cut into a certain length to be welded onto the galvanized or powder coated frame. It can be used individually as a security barrier.
** '''Flat type:''' A popular razor wire type with flat and smooth configuration (like Olympic rings). According to different technology, it can be clipped or the welded type.
** '''Welded type:''' The razor wire tape are welded into panels, then the panels are connected by clips or tie wires to form a continuous razor wire fence.
* '''Flattened type:''' A transformation of single coil concertina razor wire. The concertina wire is flattened to form the flat-type razor wire.

==== According to the coil type ====
* '''Single coil:''' Commonly seen and widely used type, which is available in both helical and concertina types.
* '''Double coil:''' A complex razor wire type to supply higher security grade. A smaller diameter coil is placed inside of the larger diameter coil. It is also available in both helical and concertina types.

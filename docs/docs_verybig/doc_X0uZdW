[[File:SQUID by Zureks.jpg|thumb|Sensing element of the SQUID]]

A '''SQUID''' (for '''superconducting quantum interference device''') is a very sensitive [[magnetometer]] used to measure extremely subtle [[magnetic field]]s, based on [[Superconductivity|superconducting]] loops containing [[Josephson junction]]s.

SQUIDs are sensitive enough to measure [[magnetic flux units|fields]] as low as 5 [[atto-|a]][[Tesla (unit)|T]] (5×10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt; T) with a few days of averaged measurements.&lt;ref name=Ran04&gt;{{cite book |url=http://einstein.stanford.edu/content/education/GP-B_T-Guide4-2008.pdf |last=Ran |first=Shannon K’doah |title=Gravity Probe B: Exploring Einstein's Universe with Gyroscopes |page=26 |year=2004 |publisher=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their noise levels are as low as 3 [[femto-|f]]T·[[Hertz|Hz]]&lt;sup&gt;−½&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ib.ptb.de/de/org/7/75/751/SQUID_Stromsensoren/Drung_ASC06_Preprint.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719073509/http://ib.ptb.de/de/org/7/75/751/SQUID_Stromsensoren/Drung_ASC06_Preprint.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-07-19|title=Highly sensitive and easy-to-use SQUID sensors|author1=D.

[[SERF]] atomic magnetometers, invented in the early 2000s are potentially more sensitive and do not require [[cryogenic]] [[refrigeration]] but are orders of magnitude larger in size (~1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and must be operated in a near-zero magnetic field.

== History and design ==

There are two main types of SQUID: [[direct current]] (DC) and [[radio frequency]] (RF). RF SQUIDs can work with only one [[Josephson junction]] ([[superconducting tunnel junction]]), which might make them cheaper to produce, but are less sensitive.

=== DC SQUID ===
[[File:DC SQUID.svg|thumb|200px|Diagram of a DC SQUID. The current &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; enters and splits into the two paths, each with currents &lt;math&gt;I_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_b&lt;/math&gt;. The thin barriers on each path are Josephson junctions, which together separate the two superconducting regions. &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; represents the magnetic flux threading the DC SQUID loop.]]

[[File:SQUID IV.jpg|thumb|Electrical schematic of a SQUID where &lt;math&gt;I_b&lt;/math&gt; is the bias current, &lt;math&gt;I_0&lt;/math&gt; is the critical current of the SQUID, &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is the flux threading the SQUID and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the voltage response to that flux. The X-symbols represent [[Josephson junction]]s.]]

Upper and lower curves correspond to &lt;math&gt;n \cdot \Phi_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n+\frac{1}{2} \cdot \Phi_0&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Right: Periodic voltage response due to flux through a SQUID. The periodicity is equal to one flux quantum, &lt;math&gt;\Phi_0&lt;/math&gt;.]]

The DC SQUID was invented in 1964 by Robert Jaklevic, John J. Lambe, James Mercereau, and Arnold Silver of [[Ford Research Labs]]&lt;ref name=Jaklevic64&gt;{{cite journal|author1=R. C. Jaklevic |author2=J. Lambe |author3=A. H. Silver |author4=J. E. Mercereau  |name-list-style=amp |title=Quantum Interference Effects in Josephson Tunneling|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=12|pages=159–160|year=1964|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.12.159|bibcode=1964PhRvL..12..159J|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Brian David Josephson]] postulated the [[Josephson effect]] in 1962, and the first Josephson junction was made by John Rowell and [[Philip Warren Anderson|Philip Anderson]] at [[Bell Labs]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = P. | last2 = Rowell | first2 = J. | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.10.230 | title = Probable Observation of the Josephson Superconducting Tunneling Effect | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 230–232 | year = 1963 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1963PhRvL..10..230A }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has two Josephson junctions in parallel in a superconducting loop. It is based on the DC [[Josephson effect]]. In the absence of any external magnetic field, the input current &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; splits into the two branches equally. If a small external magnetic field is applied to the superconducting loop, a screening current, &lt;math&gt;I_s&lt;/math&gt;, begins to circulate the loop that generates the magnetic field canceling the applied external flux, and creates an additional [[Josephson phase]] which is proportional to this external magnetic flux.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_21.html|title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics Vol. III Ch. 21: The Schrödinger Equation in a Classical Context: A Seminar on Superconductivity, Section 21–9: The Josephson junction|last=|first=|date=|website=www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The induced current is in the same direction as &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; in one of the branches of the superconducting loop, and is opposite to &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; in the other branch; the total current becomes &lt;math&gt;I/2 + I_s&lt;/math&gt; in one branch and &lt;math&gt;I/2 - I_s&lt;/math&gt; in the other. As soon as the current in either branch exceeds the critical current, &lt;math&gt;I_c&lt;/math&gt;, of the [[Josephson junction]], a voltage appears across the junction.

Now suppose the external flux is further increased until it exceeds &lt;math&gt;\Phi_0/2&lt;/math&gt;, half the [[magnetic flux quantum]]. Since the flux enclosed by the superconducting loop must be an integer number of flux quanta, instead of screening the flux the SQUID now energetically prefers to increase it to &lt;math&gt;\Phi_0&lt;/math&gt;. The current now flows in the opposite direction, opposing the difference between the admitted flux &lt;math&gt;\Phi_0&lt;/math&gt; and the external field of just over &lt;math&gt;\Phi_0/2&lt;/math&gt;. The current decreases as the external field is increased, is zero when the flux is exactly &lt;math&gt;\Phi_0&lt;/math&gt;, and again reverses direction as the external field is further increased. Thus, the current changes direction periodically, every time the flux increases by additional half-integer multiple of &lt;math&gt;\Phi_0&lt;/math&gt;, with a change at maximum amperage every half-plus-integer multiple of &lt;math&gt;\Phi_0&lt;/math&gt; and at zero amps every integer multiple.

If the input current is more than &lt;math&gt;I_c&lt;/math&gt;, then the SQUID always operates in the resistive mode. The voltage, in this case, is thus a function of the applied magnetic field and the period equal to &lt;math&gt;\Phi_0&lt;/math&gt;. Since the current-voltage characteristic of the DC SQUID is hysteretic, a shunt resistance, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is connected across the junction to eliminate the hysteresis (in the case of copper oxide based [[high-temperature superconductors]] the junction's own intrinsic resistance is usually sufficient). The screening current is the applied flux divided by the self-inductance of the ring. Thus &lt;math&gt;\Delta \Phi&lt;/math&gt; can be estimated as the function of &lt;math&gt;\Delta V&lt;/math&gt; (flux to voltage converter)&lt;ref name=du&gt;{{cite book|author=E. du Trémolet de Lacheisserie, D. Gignoux, and M. Schlenker (editors)|title=Magnetism: Materials and Applications|volume=2|publisher=Springer|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=clarke&gt;{{cite book|author=J. Clarke and A. I. Braginski (Eds.)|title=The SQUID handbook|volume=1|publisher=Wiley-Vch|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta V = R \cdot \Delta I&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;2 \cdot I = 2 \cdot \frac{\Delta \Phi}{L}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the self inductance of the superconducting ring

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta V = \frac{R}{L} \cdot \Delta \Phi&lt;/math&gt;

The discussion in this Section assumed perfect flux quantization in the loop. However, this is only true for big loops with a large self-inductance. According to the relations, given above, this implies also small current and voltage variations. In practice the self-inductance &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of the loop is not so large. The general case can be evaluated by introducing a parameter

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{i_cL}{\Phi_0}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;i_c&lt;/math&gt; the critical current of the SQUID. Usually &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is of order one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A.TH.A.M. de Waele  |author2=R. de Bruyn Ouboter |name-list-style=amp |title=Quantum-interference phenomena in point contacts between two superconductors|journal=Physica|volume= 41|year=1969|pages=225–254|doi=10.1016/0031-8914(69)90116-5|issue=2|bibcode = 1969Phy....41..225D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== RF SQUID ===
[[File:Squid prototype2.jpg|thumb|A prototype SQUID]]

The RF SQUID was invented in 1965 by Robert Jaklevic, John J. Lambe, Arnold Silver, and [[James Edward Zimmerman]] at Ford.&lt;ref name=clarke/&gt; It is based on the AC Josephson effect and uses only one Josephson junction. It is less sensitive compared to DC SQUID but is cheaper and easier to manufacture in smaller quantities. Most fundamental measurements in [[biomagnetism]], even of extremely small signals, have been made using RF SQUIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Romani | first1 = G.

These frequency measurements can be easily taken, and thus the losses which appear as the voltage across the load resistor in the circuit are a periodic function of the applied magnetic flux with a period of &lt;math&gt;\Phi_0&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Materials used ===
The traditional [[superconducting]] materials for SQUIDs are pure [[niobium]] or a lead [[alloy]] with 10% gold or [[indium]], as pure lead is unstable when its temperature is repeatedly changed. To maintain superconductivity, the entire device needs to operate within a few degrees of [[absolute zero]], cooled with [[liquid helium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=SQUID|url=https://www.chemeurope.com/en/encyclopedia/SQUID.html|access-date=2020-08-21|website=www.chemeurope.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High-temperature SQUID sensors were developed in the late 1980's.&lt;ref&gt;M.S. Colclough, C.E. Gough et al, Radiofrequency SQUID operation usinga ceramic high temperature superconductor,  Nature 328, 47 (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; They are made of [[High-temperature superconductivity|high-temperature superconductors]], particularly [[yttrium barium copper oxide|YBCO]], and are cooled by [[liquid nitrogen]] which is cheaper and more easily handled than liquid helium. They are less sensitive than conventional low temperature SQUIDs but good enough for many applications.&lt;ref&gt;LP Lee et al., Monolithic 77K DC SQUID magnetometer, Applied Physics Letters 59, 3051 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
[[File:Squid prototype.jpg|thumb|The inner workings of an early SQUID]]

The extreme sensitivity of SQUIDs makes them ideal for studies in biology. [[Magnetoencephalography]] (MEG), for example, uses measurements from an array of SQUIDs to make inferences about [[neuron|neural]] activity inside brains. Because SQUIDs can operate at acquisition rates much higher than the highest temporal frequency of interest in the signals emitted by the brain (kHz), MEG achieves good temporal resolution. Another area where SQUIDs are used is [[magnetogastrography]], which is concerned with recording the weak magnetic fields of the stomach. A novel application of SQUIDs is the [[magnetic marker monitoring]] method, which is used to trace the path of orally applied drugs. In the clinical environment SQUIDs are used in [[cardiology]] for [[magnetic field imaging]] (MFI), which detects the magnetic field of the heart for diagnosis and risk stratification.

Probably the most common commercial use of SQUIDs is in magnetic property measurement systems (MPMS). These are [[Turnkey|turn-key]] systems, made by several manufacturers, that measure the magnetic properties of a material sample. This is typically done over a temperature range from that of 300 mK to roughly 400 K.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kleiner | first1 = R. | last2 = Koelle | first2 = D. | last3 = Ludwig | first3 = F. | last4 = Clarke | first4 = J. | title = Superconducting quantum interference devices: State of the art and applications | doi = 10.1109/JPROC.2004.833655 | journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | volume = 92 | issue = 10 | pages = 1534–1548 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = | s2cid = 20573644 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the decreasing size of SQUID sensors since the last decade, such sensor can equip the tip of an [[Atomic force microscopy|AFM]] probe. Such device allows simultaneous measurement of roughness of the surface of a sample and the local magnetic flux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neel.cnrs.fr/spip.php?article914&amp;lang=en|title=Microscopie à microsquid - Institut NÉEL|author=|date=|website=neel.cnrs.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, SQUIDs are being used as detectors to perform [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI). While high-field MRI uses precession fields of one to several teslas, SQUID-detected MRI uses measurement fields that lie in the microtesla range. In a conventional MRI system, the signal scales as the square of the measurement frequency (and hence precession field): one power of frequency comes from the thermal polarization of the spins at ambient temperature, while the second power of field comes from the fact that the induced voltage in the pickup coil is proportional to the frequency of the precessing magnetization. In the case of untuned SQUID detection of prepolarized spins, however, the NMR signal strength is independent of precession field, allowing MRI signal detection in extremely weak fields, on the order of Earth's magnetic field. SQUID-detected MRI has advantages over high-field MRI systems, such as the low cost required to build such a system, and its compactness. The principle has been demonstrated by imaging human extremities, and its future application may include tumor screening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Transition-edge sensors===
One of the largest uses of SQUIDs is to read out superconducting [[Transition-edge sensor]]s. Hundreds of thousands of multiplexed SQUIDs coupled to transition-edge sensors are presently being deployed to study the [[Cosmic microwave background]], for [[X-ray astronomy]], to search for dark matter made up of [[Weakly interacting massive particles]], and for spectroscopy at [[Synchrotron light sources]].

===Cold dark matter===
Advanced SQUIDS called near quantum-limited SQUID amplifiers form the basis of the [[Axion Dark Matter Experiment]] (ADMX) at the University of Washington. Axions are a prime candidate for [[cold dark matter]].&lt;ref&gt;A Squid-Based Microwave Cavity Search For Axions By ADMX; SJ Sztalos, G Carlos, C Hagman, D Kinion, K van Bibber, M Hotz, L Rosenberg, G Rybka, J Hoskins,  J Hwang, P Sikivie, DB Tanner, R Bradley, J Clarke; Phys.Rev.Lett. 104:041301; 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposed uses===
A potential military application exists for use in [[anti-submarine warfare]] as a [[magnetic anomaly detector]] (MAD) fitted to [[maritime patrol aircraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aip.org/tip/INPHFA/vol-4/iss-2/p20.pdf |title=SQUID Sensors Penetrate New Markets |first=Jennifer |last=Ouellette |page=22 |publisher=The Industrial Physicist |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518032905/http://aip.org/tip/INPHFA/vol-4/iss-2/p20.pdf |archive-date=18 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SQUIDs are used in [[superparamagnetic relaxometry]] (SPMR), a technology that utilizes the high magnetic field sensitivity of SQUID sensors and the superparamagnetic properties of magnetite [[nanoparticle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Flynn|first1=E R|last2=Bryant|first2=H C|title=A biomagnetic system for in vivo cancer imaging|journal=Physics in Medicine and Biology|volume=50|issue=6|pages=1273–1293|doi=10.1088/0031-9155/50/6/016|pmc=2041897|pmid=15798322|bibcode=2005PMB....50.1273F|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=De Haro|first1=Leyma P.|last2=Karaulanov|first2=Todor|last3=Vreeland|first3=Erika C.|last4=Anderson|first4=Bill|last5=Hathaway|first5=Helen J.|last6=Huber|first6=Dale L.|last7=Matlashov|first7=Andrei N.|last8=Nettles|first8=Christopher P.|last9=Price|first9=Andrew D.|date=2015-10-01|title=Magnetic relaxometry as applied to sensitive cancer detection and localization|journal= Biomedical Engineering / Biomedizinische Technik|language=en|volume=60|issue=5|pages=445–55|doi=10.1515/bmt-2015-0053|pmid=26035107|osti=1227725|s2cid=13867059|issn=1862-278X}}&lt;/ref&gt; These nanoparticles are paramagnetic; they have no magnetic moment until exposed to an external field where they become ferromagnetic.

In [[signal processing]], '''white noise''' is a random [[signal]] having equal intensity at different [[frequencies]], giving it a constant [[power spectral density]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carter,Mancini|first=Bruce,Ron|title=Op Amps for Everyone|year=2009|publisher=Texas Instruments|isbn=978-0080949482|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used, with this or similar meanings, in many scientific and technical disciplines, including [[physics]], [[acoustical engineering]], [[telecommunications]], and [[statistical forecasting]]. White noise refers to a statistical model for signals and signal sources, rather than to any specific signal. White noise draws its name from [[White#Optics|white light]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stein |first=Michael L. |date=1999 |title=Interpolation of Spatial Data: Some Theory for Kriging |publisher=Springer |page=40 |isbn=978-1-4612-7166-6 |quote=white light is approximately an equal mixture of all visible frequencies of light, which was demonstrated by Isaac Newton|doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-1494-6 |series=Springer Series in Statistics }}&lt;/ref&gt; although light that appears white generally does not have a flat power spectral density over the visible band.

In [[discrete time]], white noise is a [[discrete signal]] whose [[sample (signal)|samples]] are regarded as a sequence of [[serial correlation|serially uncorrelated]] [[random variable]]s with zero [[mean (statistics)|mean]] and finite [[variance]]; a single realization of white noise is a '''random shock'''. Depending on the context, one may also require that the samples be [[statistical independence|independent]] and have identical [[probability distribution]] (in other words [[i.i.d.|independent and identically distributed random variables]] are the simplest representation of white noise).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stein |first=Michael L. |date=1999 |title=Interpolation of Spatial Data: Some Theory for Kriging |publisher=Springer |page=40 |isbn=978-1-4612-7166-6 |quote=The best-known generalized process is white noise, which can be thought of as a continuous time analogue to a sequence of independent and identically distributed observations.|doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-1494-6 |series=Springer Series in Statistics }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, if each sample has a [[normal distribution]] with zero mean, the signal is said to be [[additive white Gaussian noise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Diebold|first= Frank|title=Elements of Forecasting |edition=Fourth |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The samples of a white noise signal may be [[sequential]] in time, or arranged along one or more spatial dimensions. In [[digital image processing]], the [[pixel]]s of a ''white noise image'' are typically arranged in a rectangular grid, and are assumed to be independent random variables with [[Continuous uniform distribution|uniform probability distribution]] over some interval. The concept can be defined also for signals spread over more complicated domains, such as a [[sphere]] or a [[torus]].

[[File:White-noise-sound-20sec-mono-44100Hz.ogg|right|thumb|Some &quot;white noise&quot; sound (Loud)]]
An ''infinite-bandwidth white noise signal'' is a purely theoretical construction. The bandwidth of white noise is limited in practice by the mechanism of noise generation, by the transmission medium and by finite observation capabilities. Thus, random signals are considered &quot;white noise&quot; if they are observed to have a flat spectrum over the range of frequencies that are relevant to the context. For an [[audio signal]], the relevant range is the band of audible sound frequencies (between 20 and 20,000 [[hertz|Hz]]). Such a signal is heard by the human ear as a ''hissing sound'', resembling the /h/ sound in a sustained aspiration. On the other hand, the /sh/ sound in &quot;ash&quot; is a colored noise because it has a formant structure. In [[music]] and [[acoustics]], the term &quot;white noise&quot; may be used for any signal that has a similar hissing sound.&lt;!-- Other uses of the term --&gt;

The term white noise is sometimes used in the context of [[Phylogenetic comparative methods|phylogenetically based statistical methods]] to refer to a lack of phylogenetic pattern in comparative data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Developmental trait evolution in trilobites |journal=Evolution |volume=66 |issue= 2|pages=314–329 |year=2011 |pmid= 22276531|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01447.x|url=http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Fusco_et_al_2011_trilobites.pdf |last1=Fusco |first1=G|last2=Garland |first2=T., Jr |last3=Hunt |first3=G  |last4=Hughes |first4=NC|s2cid=14726662 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is sometimes used analogously in nontechnical contexts to mean &quot;random talk without meaningful contents&quot;.&lt;ref name=shipman&gt;

==Statistical properties==
[[File:Noise.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Spectrogram]] of [[pink noise]] (left) and white noise (right), shown with linear frequency axis (vertical) versus time axis (horizontal). ]]
Any distribution of values is possible (although it must have zero [[DC component]]). Even a binary signal which can only take on the values 1 or 0 will be white if the sequence is statistically uncorrelated. Noise having a continuous distribution, such as a [[normal distribution]], can of course be white.

It is often incorrectly assumed that [[Gaussian noise]] (i.e., noise with a Gaussian amplitude distribution{{snd}}see [[normal distribution]]) necessarily refers to white noise, yet neither property implies the other. Gaussianity refers to the probability distribution with respect to the value, in this context the probability of the signal falling within any particular range of amplitudes, while the term 'white' refers to the way the signal power is distributed (i.e., independently) over time or among frequencies.

White noise is the generalized mean-square derivative of the [[Wiener process]] or [[Brownian motion]].

A generalization to [[random element]]s on infinite dimensional spaces, such as [[random field]]s, is the [[nuclear space|white noise measure]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1888 Burckhardt operated on the brains of six patients (one of whom died a few days after the operation) at the Préfargier Asylum, cutting out a piece of [[cerebral cortex]]. He presented the results at the Berlin Medical Congress and published a report, but the response was hostile and he did no further operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kotowicz&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kotowicz | first1 = Z. | year = 2005 | title = Gottlieb Burckhardt and Egas Moniz - two beginnings of psychosurgery | url = | journal = Gesnerus | volume = 62 | issue = 1–2| pages = 77–101 | pmid = 16201322 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Early in the 20th century, Russian neurologist [[Vladimir Bekhterev]] and Estonian neurosurgeon [[Ludvig Puusepp]] operated on three patients with mental illness, with discouraging results.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kotowicz&quot;/&gt;

===1930s–1950s===

Although there had been earlier attempts to treat psychiatric disorders with brain surgery, it was Portuguese neurologist [[Antonio Egas Moniz|Egas Moniz]] who was responsible for introducing the operation into mainstream psychiatric practice. He also coined the term psychosurgery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kotowicz&quot;/&gt; Moniz developed a theory that people with mental illnesses, particularly &quot;obsessive and melancholic cases&quot; had a disorder of the [[synapse]]s which allowed unhealthy thoughts to circulate continuously in their brains. Moniz hoped that by surgically interrupting pathways in their brain he could encourage new healthier synaptic connections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moniz&quot;&gt;E. Moniz 1956 How I succeeded in performing the prefrontal leukotomy. In A.M. Sackler ''et al''. (eds.) ''The great physiodynamic therapies in psychiatry; an historical reappraisal''. New York: Hoeber, 131-37&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1935, under Moniz's direction, surgeon Pedro Almeida Lima drilled a series of holes on either side of a woman's skull and injected [[ethanol]] to destroy small areas of subcortical white matter in the [[frontal lobe]]s. After a few operations using ethanol, Moniz and Almeida Lima changed their technique and cut out small cores of brain tissue. They designed an instrument which they called a leucotome and called the operation a [[leucotomy]] (cutting of the white matter).&lt;ref name=&quot;Moniz&quot;/&gt; After twenty operations, they published an account of their work. The reception was generally not friendly but a few psychiatrists, notably in Italy and the US, were inspired to experiment for themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moniz&quot;/&gt;

In the US, psychosurgery was taken up and zealously promoted by neurologist [[Walter Freeman (neurologist)|Walter Freeman]] and neurosurgeon [[James W. Watts|James Watts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Heller&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1227/01.NEU.0000240227.72514.27 | last1 = Heller | first1 = A.C. | last2 = Amar | year = 2006 | first2 = Arun P. | last3 = Liu | first3 = Charles Y. | last4 = Apuzzo | first4 = Michael L.J. | title = Surgery of the mind and mood: a mosaic of issues in time and evolution | url = | journal = Neurosurgery | volume = 59 | issue = 4| pages = 720–40 | pmid=17038938| s2cid = 22958424 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They started a psychosurgery program at [[George Washington University]] in 1936, first using Moniz's method but then devised a method of their own in which the connections between the prefrontal lobes and deeper structures in the brain were severed by making a sweeping cut through a burr hole on either side of the skull.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heller&quot;/&gt; They called their new operation a [[lobotomy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Moniz&quot;/&gt;

Freeman went on to develop a new form of lobotomy which dispensed with the need for a neurosurgeon. He hammered an ice pick-like instrument, an orbitoclast, through the eye socket and swept through the frontal lobes. The transorbital or &quot;ice pick&quot; lobotomy was done under [[local anesthesia]] or using [[electroconvulsive therapy]] to render the patient unconscious and could be performed in mental hospitals lacking surgical facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The 1940s saw a rapid expansion of psychosurgery, in spite of the fact that it involved a significant risk of death&lt;ref name=&quot;Tooth&quot;&gt;G.C. Tooth and M.P.

Beginning in the 1940s various new techniques were designed in the hope of reducing the adverse effects of the operation. These techniques included [[William Beecher Scoville]]'s [[History of psychosurgery in the United Kingdom#Subcaudate tractotomy|orbital undercutting]], Jean Talairach's [[History of psychosurgery in the United Kingdom#Capsulotomy|anterior capsulotomy]], and Hugh Cairn's [[bilateral cingulotomy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Heller&quot;/&gt; Stereotactic techniques made it possible to place [[lesion]]s more accurately, and experiments were done with alternatives to cutting instruments such as radiation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heller&quot;/&gt; Psychosurgery nevertheless went into rapid decline in the 1950s, due to the introduction of new drugs and a growing awareness of the long-term damage caused by the operations,&lt;ref name=&quot;Heller&quot;/&gt; as well as doubts about its efficacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mashour&quot;/&gt; By the 1970s, the standard or transorbital lobotomy had been replaced with other forms of psychosurgical operations.

===1960s to the present===
During the 1960s and 1970s, psychosurgery became the subject of increasing public concern and debate, culminating in the US with congressional hearings. Particularly controversial in the United States was the work of Harvard neurosurgeon [[Vernon Mark]] and psychiatrist [[Frank Ervin]], who carried out amygdalotomies in the hope of reducing violence and &quot;pathologic aggression&quot; in patients with temporal lobe seizures and wrote a book entitled ''Violence and the Brain'' in 1970.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mashour&quot;/&gt; The National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research in 1977 endorsed the continued limited use of psychosurgical procedures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mashour&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0269889714000349 | last1 = Casey | first1 = B.P. | title =  The surgical elimination of violence?

In the US and other Western countries, the number of operations has further declined over the past 30 years, a period during which there had been no major advances in ablative psychosurgery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sachdev&quot;/&gt;
Recently, a significant advance was demonstrated in the surgical treatment of a patient who 10 year depressive episode was resistant to all other treatments.

==Ethics==
Psychosurgery has a controversial history and despite modifications still raises serious questions about benefit, risks, and the adequacy with which consent is obtained.  Its continued use is defended by references to the &quot;therapeutic imperative&quot; to do something in the case of psychiatric patients who have not responded to other forms of treatment, and the evidence that some patients see improvement in their symptoms following surgery. There remain however problems concerning the rationale, indications and efficacy of psychosurgery, and the results of the operation raise questions of &quot;identity, spirit, relationships, integrity and human flourishing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;G Gillet 2007 Psychosurgery and neuroimplantation: changing what is deep within a person.

[[File:Ice-calorimeter.jpg|150px|right|thumb|The world's first '''ice-calorimeter''', used in the winter of 1782–83, by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], to determine the [[heat]] evolved in various [[chemical change]]s; calculations which were based on [[Joseph Black]]'s prior discovery of [[latent heat]].  These experiments mark the foundation of [[thermochemistry]].]] 
A '''calorimeter''' is an object used for [[calorimetry]], or the process of measuring the heat of [[chemical reaction]]s or [[physical change]]s as well as [[heat capacity]]. Differential scanning calorimeters, isothermal micro calorimeters, [[titration]] calorimeters and accelerated rate calorimeters are among the most common types. A simple calorimeter just consists of a thermometer attached to a metal container full of water suspended above a combustion chamber.  It is one of the measurement devices used in the study of thermodynamics, chemistry, and biochemistry.

To find the [[enthalpy]] change per [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of a substance A in a reaction between two substances A and B, the substances are separately added to a calorimeter and the initial and final [[temperature]]s (before the reaction has started and after it has finished) are noted. Multiplying the temperature change by the mass and [[specific heat capacity|specific heat capacities]] of the substances gives a value for the [[energy]] given off or absorbed during the reaction. Dividing the energy change by how many moles of A were present gives its enthalpy change of reaction.

: &lt;math&gt;q=C_v(T_f-T_i)&lt;/math&gt; 

Where {{mvar|q}} is the amount of heat according to the change in temperature measured in joules and {{mvar|C&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the heat capacity of the calorimeter which is a value associated with each individual apparatus in units of energy per temperature (Joules/Kelvin).  

==History==
In 1761 Joseph Black introduced the idea of latent heat which lead to creation of the first ice-calorimeters.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, Hugh, ed. (1911). &quot;Black, Joseph&quot;. Encyclopædia Britannica. 4 (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1780, Antoine Lavoisier used the heat from the guinea pig's respiration to melt snow surrounding his apparatus, showing that respiratory gas exchange is combustion, similar to a candle burning.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Laurent Lavoisier, Elements of Chemistry: In a New Systematic Order; Containing All the Modern Discoveries, 1789: &quot;I acknowledge the name of Calorimeter, which I have given it, as derived partly from Greek and partly from Latin, is in some degree open to criticism; but in matters of science, a slight deviation from strict etymology, for the sake of giving distinctness of idea, is excusable; and I could not derive the name entirely from Greek without approaching too near to the names of known instruments employed for other purposes.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Lavoisier dubbed this apparatus the calorimeter, based on both Greek and Latin roots. One of the first ice calorimeters was used in the winter of 1782 by Lavoisier and Pierre-Simon Laplace, which relied on the heat required to melt ice to water to measure the heat released from chemical reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/79/5/899S |last1=Buchholz |first1=Andrea C |last2=Schoeller |first2=Dale A. |year=2004 |title=Is a Calorie a Calorie? |journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=79 |number=5 |pages=899S–906S |pmid=15113737 |accessdate=2007-03-12 |doi=10.1093/ajcn/79.5.899S|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adiabatic calorimeters==
[[File:Calorimeter of Lavoisier and La Place plate xi the s1784m49j 3f462600t dl full size.jpg|thumb|right|The Calorimeter of Lavoisier and La Place, 1801]]
An [[adiabatic process|adiabatic]] calorimeter is a calorimeter used to examine a runaway reaction.  Since the calorimeter runs in an adiabatic environment, any heat generated by the material sample under test causes the sample to increase in temperature, thus fueling the reaction.

No adiabatic calorimeter is fully adiabatic - some heat will be lost by the sample to the sample holder. A mathematical correction factor, known as the phi-factor, can be used to adjust the calorimetric result to account for these heat losses. The phi-factor is the ratio of the [[thermal mass]] of the sample and sample holder to the thermal mass of the sample alone.

==Reaction calorimeters==

{{Main article|Reaction calorimeters}}
A reaction calorimeter is a calorimeter in which a [[chemical reaction]] is initiated within a closed insulated container. Reaction heats are measured and the total heat is obtained by integrating heatflow versus time. This is the standard used in industry to measure heats since industrial processes are engineered to run at constant temperatures.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018|reason=Which industry who says it's the standard?}} Reaction calorimetry can also be used to determine maximum heat release rate for chemical process engineering and for tracking the global kinetics of reactions. There are four main methods for measuring the heat in reaction calorimeter:

===Heat flow calorimeter===

The cooling/heating jacket controls either the temperature of the process or the temperature of the jacket. Heat is measured by monitoring the temperature difference between heat transfer fluid and the process fluid. In addition, fill volumes (i.e. wetted area), specific heat, heat transfer coefficient have to be determined to arrive at a correct value.  It is possible with this type of calorimeter to do reactions at reflux, although it is very less accurate.

===Heat balance calorimeter===

The cooling/heating jacket controls the temperature of the process. Heat is measured by monitoring the heat gained or lost by the heat transfer fluid.

===Power compensation===
Power compensation uses a heater placed within the vessel to maintain a constant temperature. The energy supplied to this heater can be varied as reactions require and the calorimetry signal is purely derived from this electrical power.

===Constant flux===
Constant flux calorimetry (or COFLUX as it is often termed) is derived from heat balance calorimetry and uses specialized control mechanisms to maintain a constant heat flow (or flux) across the vessel wall.

A bomb calorimeter is a type of constant-volume calorimeter used in measuring the heat of combustion of a particular reaction. Bomb calorimeters have to withstand the large pressure within the calorimeter as the reaction is being measured. Electrical energy is used to ignite the fuel; as the fuel is burning, it will heat up the surrounding air, which expands and escapes through a tube that leads the air out of the calorimeter. When the air is escaping through the copper tube it will also heat up the water outside the tube. The change in temperature of the water allows for calculating calorie content of the fuel.

In more recent calorimeter designs, the whole bomb, pressurized with excess pure oxygen (typically at 30 atm) and containing a weighed mass of a sample (typically 1–1.5 g) and a small fixed amount of water (to saturate the internal atmosphere, thus ensuring that all water produced is liquid, and removing the need to include enthalpy of vaporization in calculations), is submerged under a known volume of water (ca.&amp;nbsp;2000 ml) before the charge is electrically ignited. The bomb, with the known mass of the sample and oxygen, form a closed system — no gases escape during the reaction. The weighed reactant put inside the steel container is then ignited. Energy is released by the combustion and heat flow from this crosses the stainless steel wall, thus raising the temperature of the steel bomb, its contents, and the surrounding water jacket. The temperature change in the water is then accurately measured with a thermometer. This reading, along with a bomb factor (which is dependent on the heat capacity of the metal bomb parts), is used to calculate the energy given out by the sample burn. A small correction is made to account for the electrical energy input, the burning fuse, and acid production (by titration of the residual liquid). After the temperature rise has been measured, the excess pressure in the bomb is released.

Basically, a bomb calorimeter consists of a small cup to contain the sample, oxygen, a stainless steel bomb, water, a stirrer, a thermometer, the dewar or insulating container (to prevent heat flow from the calorimeter to the surroundings) and ignition circuit connected to the bomb. By using stainless steel for the bomb, the reaction will occur with no volume change observed.

Since there is no heat exchange between the calorimeter and surroundings (Q = 0) (adiabatic), no work is performed (W = 0)

Thus, the total internal energy change

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta E_{\text{total}}=Q+W=0&lt;/math&gt;

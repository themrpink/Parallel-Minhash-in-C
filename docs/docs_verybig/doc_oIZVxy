Standardized earthen plumbing pipes with broad [[flange]]s making use of [[asphalt]] for preventing leakages appeared in the urban settlements of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] by 2700 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Teresi et al. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper piping appeared in Egypt by 2400 BCE, with the [[Pyramid of Sahure]] and adjoining temple complex at [[Abusir]], found to be connected by a copper waste pipe. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bunson|first=Margaret|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-6EJ0G-4jyoC&amp;q=Abusir+copper+pipe+ancient+egypt&amp;pg=PA6|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt|date=2014-05-14|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4381-0997-8|location=|pages=6|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word  &quot;plumber&quot; dates from the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Pulsifer, William H. [https://archive.org/details/notesforhistoryo00pulsrich Notes For a History of Lead], New York University Press, 1888. pp. 132, 158&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Latin]] for [[lead]] is ''{{lang|la|plumbum}}''.  Roman roofs used lead in conduits and drain pipes&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Px4XAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA821 Middleton, The Remains of Ancient Rome, Vol. 2, A &amp; C Black, 1892]&lt;/ref&gt; and some were also covered with lead. Lead was also used for [[piping]] and for making baths.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081121025509/http://www.ila-lead.org/factbook/annex.pdf Historical production and uses of lead]. ila-lead.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Plumbing reached its early apex in [[Sanitation in ancient Rome|ancient Rome]], which saw the introduction of expansive systems of [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]], [[tile]] [[wastewater]] removal, and widespread use of [[lead pipe]]s. The Romans used [[lead pipe inscription]]s to prevent [[water theft]]. With the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|Fall of Rome]] both water supply and sanitation stagnated—or regressed—for well over 1,000 years.  Improvement was very slow, with little effective progress made until the growth of modern densely populated cities in the 1800s. During this period, [[public health]] authorities began pressing for better waste disposal systems to be installed, to prevent or control [[epidemic]]s of disease. Earlier, the waste disposal system had consisted of collecting waste and dumping it on the ground or into a river. Eventually the development of separate, underground water and sewage systems eliminated open sewage ditches and [[cesspit|cesspools]].

In post-classical [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] The wealthy enjoyed indoor plumbing in their stone homes.&lt;ref&gt;The Travels of Ibn Battuta&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|last=Cartwright|first=Mark|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Kilwa/=false|encyclopedia=Ancient History Encyclopedia|title=Kilwa|date=2019-03-29|year=2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most large cities today pipe solid wastes to [[sewage treatment]] plants in order to separate and partially purify the water, before emptying into streams or other bodies of water. For potable water use, [[galvanized iron]] piping was commonplace in the United States from the late 1800s until around 1960. After that period, copper piping took over, first soft copper with flared fittings, then with rigid copper tubing using soldered fittings.

The use of lead for potable water declined sharply after [[World War II]] because of increased awareness of the dangers of [[lead poisoning]]. At this time, copper piping was introduced as a better and safer alternative to lead pipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Public Notice .Lead Contamination Informative City Ok Moscow Water System|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2026&amp;dat=19880812&amp;id=EZUrAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3819,1428737|accessdate=December 27, 2013|newspaper=Moscow-Pullman Daily News|date=August 12, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Waterpipes.jpeg|thumb|200px|A system of [[copper]] water [[Tubing (material)|tubes]] used in a [[radiator]] heating system.]]

A ''water pipe'' is a [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]] or [[Tube (fluid conveyance)|tube]], frequently made of plastic or metal,{{efn|Materials used to make water pipes are [[polyvinyl chloride]], [[polypropylene]], [[polyethylene]], [[ductile iron]], [[cast iron]], [[steel]], [[copper]] and formerly [[lead]].}} that carries [[Pressure|pressurized]] and [[Water purification|treated]] [[fresh water]] to a building (as part of a [[municipal water system]]), as well as inside the building.

===History===
{{Main|History of water supply and sanitation}}
[[File:Canalisation machine de Marly.jpg|thumb|Old water pipe, remnant of the [[Machine de Marly]] near [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], France]]

[[Lead]] was the favoured material for water pipes for many centuries because its [[ductility|malleability]] made it practical to [[metalsmith|work]] into the desired shape. Such use was so common that the word &quot;plumbing&quot; derives from ''plumbum'', the [[Latin]] word for lead. This was a source of lead-related health problems in the years before the [[lead poisoning|health hazards of ingesting lead]] were fully understood; among these were [[stillbirth]]s and high rates of [[infant mortality]]. Lead water pipes were still widely used in the early 20th century and remain in many households. Lead-tin [[alloy]] [[solder]] was commonly used to join [[copper pipe]]s, but modern practice uses tin-antimony alloy solder instead in order to eliminate lead hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lead in Drinking Water|url=http://water.epa.gov/drink/info/lead/|publisher=Epa.gov|accessdate=22 January 2014|date=February 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the Romans' common use of lead pipes, [[Roman aqueduct|their aqueducts]] rarely poisoned people. Unlike other parts of the world where lead pipes cause poisoning, the Roman water had so much [[calcium]] in it that a layer of plaque prevented the water contacting the lead itself. What often causes confusion is the large amount of evidence of widespread lead poisoning, particularly amongst those who would have had easy access to piped water,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hansen|first=Roger|title=WATER AND WASTEWATER SYSTEMS IN IMPERIAL ROME|url=http://www.waterhistory.org/histories/rome/|publisher=Waterhistory.org|accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an unfortunate result of lead being used in cookware and as an additive to processed food and drink (for example as a [[preservative]] in wine).&lt;ref name=&quot;Lead Poisoning&quot;&gt;Grout, James. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/wine/leadpoisoning.html &quot;Lead Poisoning and Rome&quot;]. Encyclopaedia Romana. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman lead pipe inscription]]s provided information on the owner to prevent water theft.

[[Piping#Wooden piping history|Wooden pipes]] were used in London and elsewhere during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would pass through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wooden water pipe|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/lg-zKE0ETBSw4I8O_RHz5A|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were  used in Philadelphia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/retropod/philadelphias-plumbing-revolution-wood-pipes/|title=Philadelphia's plumbing revolution: wood pipes - Retropod|last=Rosenwald|first=Mike|date=February 11, 2019|website=[[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were widely used in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made of sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and conduits, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.

[[Cast iron pipe|Cast iron]] and [[ductile iron pipe]] was long a lower-cost alternative to copper before the advent of durable plastic materials but special non-conductive fittings must be used where transitions are to be made to other metallic pipes (except for terminal fittings) in order to avoid corrosion owing to electrochemical reactions between dissimilar metals (see [[galvanic cell]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Pipe Material|url=http://water.me.vccs.edu/concepts/material.html|publisher=Virginia's Community Colleges|accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bronze]] fittings and short pipe segments are commonly used in combination with various materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statista.com/statistics/232263/market-for-water-equipment/ Worldwide Market for Industrial and Domestic Water Equipment as of 2010]. PwC. March 2012. Retrieved January 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference between pipes and tubes==
[[File:Watermain.jpg|thumb|Typical PVC municipal water main being installed in Ontario, Canada]]
[[File:FlexibleRainPipe.JPG|thumb|right|150px|A plastic water pipe being installed. Note that the inner tube is actually transporting the water, while the outer tube only serves as a protective casing]]

The difference between pipes and tubes is a matter of sizing. For instance, [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] pipe for plumbing applications and galvanized steel pipe are measured in [[iron pipe size]] (IPS). Copper tube, [[CPVC]], [[PEX|PeX]] and other tubing is measured nominally, basically an average diameter. These sizing schemes allow for universal adaptation of transitional fittings. For instance, 1/2&quot; PeX tubing is the same size as 1/2&quot; copper tubing. 1/2&quot; PVC on the other hand is not the same size as 1/2&quot; tubing, and therefore requires either a threaded male or female adapter to connect them.  When used in agricultural irrigation, the singular form &quot;pipe&quot; is often used as a plural.&lt;ref name=&quot;etb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Difference between Pipes and Tubes|url=http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/pipes-tubes-d_347.html|accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pipe is available in rigid ''joints'', which come in various lengths depending on the material. Tubing, in particular copper, comes in rigid hard tempered joints or soft tempered (annealed) rolls. PeX and CPVC tubing also comes in rigid joints or flexible rolls. The temper of the copper, whether it is a rigid joint or flexible roll, does not affect the sizing.&lt;ref name=&quot;etb&quot; /&gt;

The thicknesses of the water pipe and tube walls can vary. Because piping and tubing are commodities, having a greater wall thickness implies higher initial cost. Thicker walled pipe generally implies greater durability and higher pressure tolerances. Pipe wall thickness is denoted by various schedules or for large bore polyethylene pipe in the UK by the [[Standard Dimension Ratio]] (SDR), defined as the ratio of the pipe diameter to its wall thickness. Pipe wall thickness increases with schedule, and is available in schedules 20, 40, 80, and higher in special cases. The schedule is largely determined by the operating pressure of the system, with higher pressures commanding greater thickness. Copper tubing is available in four wall thicknesses: type DWV (thinnest wall; only allowed as drain pipe per UPC), type 'M' (thin; typically only allowed as drain pipe by IPC code), type 'L' (thicker, standard duty for water lines and water service), and type 'K' (thickest, typically used underground between the main and the meter).

Wall thickness does not affect pipe or tubing size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wall thickness does not affect pipe o|url=http://www.jmeagle.com/pdfs/Technical%20Bulletins/TB10SunlightEffectsonPVC.pdf|accessdate=22 January 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903072809/http://www.jmeagle.com/pdfs/Technical%20Bulletins/TB10SunlightEffectsonPVC.pdf|archivedate=September 3, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1/2&quot; L copper has the same outer diameter as 1/2&quot; K or M copper. The same applies to pipe schedules. As a result, a slight increase in pressure losses is realized due to a decrease in flowpath as wall thickness is increased. In other words, 1 foot of 1/2&quot; L copper has slightly less volume than 1 foot of 1/2 M copper.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

=== Materials ===
Water systems of ancient times relied on gravity for the supply of water, using pipes or channels usually made of [[clay]], [[lead]], bamboo, wood, or stone. Hollowed wooden logs wrapped in steel banding were used for plumbing pipes, particularly water mains. Logs were used for water distribution in England close to 500 years ago. US cities began using hollowed logs in the late 1700s through the 1800s.  Today, most plumbing supply pipe is made out of steel, copper, and plastic; most waste (also known as &quot;soil&quot;)&lt;ref name=cispi&gt;http://www.cispi.org/products/types.aspx{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Cast Iron Soil Pipe Institute&lt;/ref&gt; out of steel, copper, plastic, and cast iron.&lt;ref name=cispi /&gt;

The straight sections of plumbing systems are called &quot;pipes&quot; or &quot;tubes&quot;. A pipe is typically formed via [[casting]] or [[welding]], whereas a tube is made through [[extrusion]]. Pipe normally has thicker walls and may be threaded or welded, while tubing is thinner-walled and requires special joining techniques such as [[brazing]], [[compression fitting]], [[crimp (joining)|crimping]], or for plastics, [[solvent welding]].  These joining techniques are discussed in more detail in the [[piping and plumbing fittings]] article.

==== Steel ====
{{Main|Galvanized pipe}}
[[Galvanized steel]] potable water supply and distribution [[pipe (material)|pipes]] are commonly found with [[nominal pipe size]]s from {{convert|3/8|in|mm}} to {{convert|2|in|mm}}. It is rarely used today for new construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has [[National Pipe Thread]] (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, [[valve]]s, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (often known simply as &quot;'''galv'''&quot; or &quot;'''iron'''&quot; in the plumbing trade) is relatively expensive, and difficult to work with due to weight and requirement of a [[pipe threader]]. It remains in common use for repair of existing &quot;galv&quot; systems and to satisfy [[building code]] non-combustibility requirements typically found in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications. It is also extremely durable and resistant to mechanical abuse.  Black lacquered steel pipe is the most widely used pipe material for [[fire sprinkler]]s and natural gas.

Most typical single family home systems won't require supply piping larger than {{convert|3/4|in|mm}} due to expense as well as steel piping's tendency to become obstructed from internal rusting and mineral deposits forming on the inside of the pipe over time once the internal galvanizing zinc coating has degraded. In potable water distribution service, galvanized steel pipe has a service life of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not uncommon for it to be less in geographic areas with corrosive water contaminants.

==== Copper ====
{{Main|Copper tubing}}

Copper pipe and tubing was widely used for domestic water systems in the latter half of the twentieth century. Demand for copper products has fallen due to the dramatic increase in the price of copper, resulting in increased demand for alternative products including [[PEX]] and [[stainless steel]].

==== Plastic ====
{{Main|Plastic pipework}}
[[File:SinkPlumbing.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Plastic hot and cold supply piping for a sink]]
Plastic pipe is in wide use for domestic water supply and [[Drain-waste-vent system|drain-waste-vent]] (DWV) pipe. Principal types include:
[[Polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not become practical to manufacture until 1926, when [[Waldo Semon]] of BF Goodrich Co. developed a method to plasticize PVC, making it easier to process. PVC pipe began to be manufactured in the 1940s and was in wide use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping during the reconstruction of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics manufacturers in Western Europe and Japan began producing [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]] (ABS) pipe. The method for producing [[cross-linked polyethylene]] (PEX) was also developed in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have become increasingly common, with a variety of materials and fittings employed.
* [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]/[[chlorinated polyvinyl chloride|CPVC]] – rigid plastic pipes similar to PVC drain pipes but with thicker walls to deal with municipal water pressure, introduced around 1970. PVC stands for polyvinyl chloride, and it has become a common replacement for metal piping. PVC should be used only for cold water, or for venting. CPVC can be used for hot and cold potable water supply. Connections are made with primers and solvent cements as required by code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What's the difference between PVC and CPVC pipe?|url=http://www.commercial-industrial-supply.com/resource-center/whats-the-difference-between-pvc-and-cpvc-pipe/|date=August 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Polypropylene|PP]] – The material is used primarily in housewares, food packaging, and clinical equipment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/polypropylene-properties-and-uses.html|title=Polypropylene Properties and Uses|author=Bidisha Mukherjee|work=Buzzle|access-date=February 7, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208001734/http://www.buzzle.com/articles/polypropylene-properties-and-uses.html|archive-date=February 8, 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; but since the early 1970s has seen increasing use worldwide for both domestic hot and cold water. PP pipes are [[heat fusion|heat fused]], being unsuitable for the use of glues, solvents, or mechanical fittings. PP pipe is often used in [[green building]] projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmengineer.com/Articles/Green/2010/06/01/Walking-The-Talk|title=Walking The Talk|work=pmengineer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Polybutylene terephthalate|PBT]] – flexible (usually gray or black) plastic pipe which is attached to barbed fittings and secured in place with a copper crimp ring. The primary manufacturer of PBT tubing and fittings was driven into bankruptcy by a class-action lawsuit over failures of this system.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} However, PB and PBT tubing has since returned to the market and codes, typically first for &quot;exposed locations&quot; such as risers.
* [[PEX]] – cross-linked polyethylene system with mechanically joined fittings employing barbs, and crimped steel or copper rings.
* Polytanks – plastic polyethylene cisterns, underground water tanks, above ground water tanks, are usually made of linear polyethylene suitable as a potable water storage tank, provided in white, black or green.
* Aqua – known as PEX-Al-PEX, for its PEX/aluminum sandwich, consisting of aluminum pipe sandwiched between layers of PEX, and connected with modified brass compression fittings. In 2005, many of these fittings were recalled.{{Elucidate|date=March 2012}}

Present-day water-supply systems use a network of high-pressure pumps, and pipes in buildings are now made of copper,&lt;ref&gt;''Copper Tube Handbook'', the Copper Development Association, New York, USA, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; brass, plastic (particularly [[cross-linked polyethylene]] called PEX, which is estimated to be used in 60% of single-family homes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.builderonline.com/legislation/californias-pex-battle-continues.aspx California’s PEX Battle Continues]. Builderonline.com&lt;/ref&gt;), or other nontoxic material. Due to its [[lead poisoning|toxicity]], most cities moved away from lead water-supply piping by the 1920s in the United States,&lt;ref name=Maceketal2006 /&gt; although lead pipes were approved by national plumbing codes into the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rabin|first=Richard|date=2017-03-06|title=The Lead Industry and Lead Water Pipes &quot;A MODEST CAMPAIGN&quot;|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=98|issue=9|pages=1584–1592|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2007.113555|issn=0090-0036|pmc=2509614|pmid=18633098}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lead was used in plumbing solder for drinking water until it was banned in 1986.&lt;ref name=Maceketal2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Macek | first1 = MD | last2 = Matte | first2 = TD | last3 = Sinks | first3 = T | last4 = Malvitz | first4 = DM | title = Blood lead concentrations in children and method of water fluoridation in the United States, 1988–1994 | journal =  Environmental Health Perspectives| volume = 114 | issue = 1 | pages = 130–4 |date=Jan 2006 | doi =  10.1289/ehp.8319 |pmc=1332668 |pmid=16393670}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drain and vent lines are made of plastic, steel, cast iron, or lead.&lt;ref&gt;''Uniform Plumbing Code'', IAPMO&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''International Plumbing Code'', ICC&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to lengths of pipe or tubing, pipe fittings such as valves, elbows, tees, and unions. are used in plumbing systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miscellaneous Valves|url=http://www.ridgewaymechanical.com/atlanta_plumbing_miscellaneous_valves.htm|accessdate=December 27, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426212049/http://ridgewaymechanical.com/atlanta_plumbing_miscellaneous_valves.htm|archivedate=April 26, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pipe and fittings are held in place with [[pipe hanger]]s and [[strapping]].

[[Plumbing fixture]]s are exchangeable devices that use water and can be connected to a building's plumbing system. They are considered to be &quot;fixtures&quot;, in that they are semi-permanent parts of buildings, not usually owned or maintained separately.  Plumbing fixtures are seen by and designed for the [[End user|end-users]]. Some examples of fixtures include water closets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Basic Plumbing Principles|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&amp;dat=19261110&amp;id=Y_NPAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1477,3295499|accessdate=December 27, 2013|newspaper=The Evening Independent|date=November 10, 1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as [[toilet]]s), [[Urinal (restroom)|urinals]], [[bidet]]s, [[shower]]s, [[bathtub]]s, utility and kitchen [[sink]]s, [[drinking fountain]]s, [[ice maker]]s, humidifiers, [[air washer]]s, [[fountain]]s, and eye wash stations.

=== Sealants ===
Threaded pipe joints are sealed with [[thread seal tape]] or [[pipe dope]]. Many plumbing fixtures are sealed to their mounting surfaces with [[plumber's putty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Key To Pop-up Drain Is Fresh Plumber's Putty|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1696&amp;dat=20030112&amp;id=lg0bAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6826,1218984|accessdate=December 27, 2013|newspaper=Daily News|date=January 12, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equipment and tools ==
[[File:Plumber uses two wrenches to tighten a fitting.jpg|thumb|A plumber tightening the fitting on a gas supply line.]]
Plumbing equipment includes devices often  behind walls or in utility spaces which are not seen by the general public. It includes [[water meter]]s, [[pump]]s, expansion tanks, [[back flow preventers]], [[water filter]]s, [[UV sterilization]] lights, [[water softener]]s, [[water heating|water heaters]], [[heat exchangers]], gauges, and control systems.

There are many tools a plumber needs to do a good plumbing job. While many simple plumbing tasks can be completed with a few common hand held tools, other more complex jobs require specialised tools, designed specifically to make the job easier.

Specialized plumbing tools include [[pipe wrench]]es, [[flaring pliers]], pipe vise, pipe bending machine, pipe cutter, [[Tap and die|dies]], and joining tools such as soldering torches and crimp tools. New tools have been developed to help plumbers fix problems more efficiently. For example, plumbers use video cameras for inspections of hidden leaks or other problems; they also use hydro jets, and high pressure hydraulic pumps connected to steel cables for trench-less sewer line replacement.

Flooding from excessive rain or clogged sewers may require specialized equipment, such as a heavy duty pumper truck designed to vacuum raw sewage.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

== Problems ==
Bacteria have been shown to live in &quot;premises plumbing systems&quot;. The latter refers to the &quot;pipes and fixtures within a building that transport water to taps after it is delivered by the utility&quot;.&lt;ref name=ehp&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Carol Potera|title=Plumbing Pathogens: A Fixture in Hospitals and Homes|journal= Environmental Health Perspectives|date=August 2015|volume=123|issue=8|doi=10.1289/ehp.123-A217|pmc=4528999|pmid=26230512|page=A217|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community water systems have been known for centuries to spread [[waterborne diseases]] like typhoid and cholera.  However, &quot;opportunistic premises plumbing pathogens&quot; have been recognized only more recently: [[Legionella pneumophila]], discovered in 1976, [[Mycobacterium avium]], and [[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]] are the most commonly tracked bacteria, which people with depressed immunity can inhale or ingest and may become infected with.&lt;ref name=ehp2&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Joseph O. Falkinham III|author2=Elizabeth D. Hilborn|author3=Matthew J. Arduino|author4=Amy Pruden|author5=Marc A.

Some of the locations where these opportunistic pathogens can grow include faucets, shower heads, water heaters and along pipe walls. Reasons that favor their growth are &quot;high surface-to-volume ratio, intermittent stagnation, low disinfectant residual, and warming cycles&quot;. A high surface-to-volume ratio, i.e. a relatively large surface area allows the bacteria to form a [[biofilm]], which protects them from disinfection.&lt;ref name=ehp2 /&gt;

== Regulation ==
[[File:pipewrench.jpg|thumb|100px|A [[pipe wrench]] for holding and turning pipe]]
Much of the plumbing work in populated areas is regulated by government or quasi-government agencies due to the direct impact on the public's health, safety, and welfare. Plumbing installation and repair work on residences and other buildings generally must be done according to plumbing and building codes to protect the inhabitants of the buildings and to ensure safe, quality construction to future buyers. If permits are required for work, plumbing contractors typically secure them from the authorities on behalf of home or building owners.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

=== Australia ===
In Australia, the national governing body for plumbing regulation is the Australian Building Codes Board. They are responsible for the creation of the National Construction Code (NCC), Volume 3 of which, the Plumbing Regulations 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_reg/pr2008216/s11.html|title=PLUMBING REGULATIONS 2008 - REG 11 Plumbing work that may be carried out by unlicensed or unregistered persons|website=classic.austlii.edu.au|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Plumbing Code of Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ablis.business.gov.au/service/ag/the-plumbing-code-of-australia-pca-/31066|title=The Plumbing Code of Australia (PCA) - Australian Government|date=14 Nov 2018|website=ablis.gov.au|access-date=14 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; pertains to plumbing.

Each Government at the state level has their own Authority and regulations in place for licensing plumbers. They are also responsible for the interpretation, administration and enforcement of the regulations outlined in the NCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abcb.gov.au/ncc-online/Regulatory-Framework|title=Regulatory Framework {{!}} Australian Building Codes Board|website=www.abcb.gov.au|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Authorities are usually established for the sole purpose of regulating plumbing activities in their respective states/territories. However, several state level regulation acts are quite outdated, with some still operating on local policies introduced more than a decade ago. This has led to an increase in plumbing regulatory issues not covered under current policy, and as such, many policies are currently being updated to cover these more modern issues. The updates include changed to the minimum experience and training requirements for licensing, additional work standards for new and more specific kinds of plumbing, as well as adopting the Plumbing Code of Australia into state regulations in an effort to standardise plumbing regulations across the country.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom the professional body is the [[Chartered Institute of Plumbing and Heating Engineering]] (educational charity status) and it is true that the trade still remains virtually ungoverned;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ciphe.org.uk |title=The Chartered Institute of Plumbing and Heating Engineering (CIPHE) |accessdate=March 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are no systems in place to monitor or control the activities of unqualified plumbers or those home owners who choose to undertake installation and maintenance works themselves, despite the health and safety issues which arise from such works when they are undertaken incorrectly; see ''Health Aspects of Plumbing (HAP)'' published jointly by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the [[World Plumbing Council|World Plumbing Council (WPC)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldplumbing.org|title=World Plumbing Council|accessdate=October 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/plumbinghealthasp/en|title=WHO Health aspects of plumbing|accessdate=October 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; WPC has subsequently appointed a representative to the World Health Organization to take forward various projects related to Health Aspects of Plumbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldplumbing.org/sep07.html|title=World Plumbing Council|accessdate=October 11, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117061821/http://www.worldplumbing.org/sep07.html|archivedate=January 17, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In the United States, plumbing codes and licensing are generally controlled by state and local governments. At the national level, the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] has set guidelines about what constitutes [[lead]]-free plumbing fittings and pipes, in order to comply with the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/dwstandardsregulations/section-1417-safe-drinking-water-act-prohibition-use-lead-pipes-solder-and|title=Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act: Prohibition on Use of Lead Pipes, Solder, and Flux|accessdate=December 20, 2016|date=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some widely used Standards in the United States are:{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

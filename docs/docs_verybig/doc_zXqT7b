'''Kidinnu''' (also ''Kidunnu''; possibly [[floruit|fl.]] 4th century BC; possibly died 14 August 330 BC) was a [[Babylonian astronomy|Chaldean astronomer]] and [[Babylonian mathematics|mathematician]]. [[Strabo]] of [[Amaseia]] called him Kidenas, [[Pliny the Elder]] Cidenas, and [[Vettius Valens]] Kidynas.

Some [[cuneiform]] and classical Greek and Latin texts mention an astronomer with this name, but it is not clear if they all refer to the same individual:

* The Greek geographer [[Strabo]] of [[Amaseia]], in ''Geography'' 16.1–.6, writes: &quot;In [[Babylon]] a settlement is set apart for the local [[philosopher]]s, the Chaldaeans, as they are called, who are concerned mostly with [[astronomy]]; but some of these, who are not approved of by the others, profess to be writers of [[horoscope]]s. (There is also a tribe of the Chaldaeans, and a territory inhabited by them, in the neighborhood of the [[Arabia|Arabs]] and of the [[Persian Gulf]], as it is called.) There are also several tribes of the Chaldaean astronomers. For example, some are called Orcheni [those from [[Uruk]]], others Borsippeni [those from [[Borsippa]]], and several others by different names, as though divided into different sects which hold to various dogmas about the same subjects. And the mathematicians make mention of some of these men; as, for example, Kidenas, [[Naburimannu|Nabourianos]] and [[Soudines]]&quot;.
* The Roman encyclopaedist [[Pliny the Elder]], in ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' II.vi.39, writes that the [[planet]] [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] can be viewed &quot;sometimes before sunrise and sometimes after sunset, but according to Cidenas and [[Sosigenes of Alexandria|Sosigenes]] never more than 22 degrees away from the [[sun]]&quot;.
* The Roman astrologer [[Vettius Valens]], in ''Anthology'', says that he used [[Hipparchus]] for the Sun, [[Sudines]] and Kidynas and [[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]] for the [[Moon]], and again Apollonius for both types (of [[eclipse]]s, ''i.e.'' solar and lunar).
* The [[Hellenistic]] astronomer [[Ptolemy]], in ''[[Almagest]]'' IV 2, discusses the duration and ratios of several periods related to the Moon, as known to &quot;ancient astronomers&quot; and &quot;the Chaldeans&quot; and improved by Hipparchus.  He mentions the equality of 251 [[synodic month|(synodic) months]] to 269 [[anomalistic month|returns in anomaly]]. In a preserved classical manuscript of the excerpt known as ''Handy Tables'', an anonymous reader in the third century wrote the comment (a [[scholium]]) that Kidenas discovered this relation.
* The [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]] of two Babylonian System B [[moon|lunar]] [[ephemeris|ephemerides]] from Babylon (see ACT 122 for 104–101 BC, and ACT 123a for an unknown year) say that they are the ''tersitu'' of Kidinnu.
* A damaged cuneiform [[astronomical diary tablet]] from Babylon ([[Babylonian Chronicles|Babylonian Chronicle 8]]: the Alexander Chronicle, BM 36304) mentions that &quot;ki-di-nu was killed by the sword&quot; on day 15 of probably the 5th month of that year, which has been dated as 14 August 330 BC, less than a year after [[Alexander the Great]] conquered Babylon.

The following information is an excerpt of the overview of a century of scholarship in the sources referenced below.

The meaning of ''tersitu'' is not known definitively.  Already [[Franz Xaver Kugler]] proposed that the word can be interpreted here as &quot;table&quot;; in another context it seems to mean something like &quot;tool&quot;, but in yet another it refers to a blue enamel paste.  P. Schnabel, in a series of papers (1923–1927), interpreted the phrase as an assignment of authorship.  He argued that [[Naburimannu]] developed the Babylonian System A of calculating [[Solar System]] ephemerides, and that later Kidinnu developed the Babylonian System B.  A Greco-Roman tradition, mentioned above, attributes to Kidinnu the discovery that 251 synodic months equals 269 anomalistic months. This relationship is implicit in System B, and is therefore another reason to believe that Kidinnu was involved in developing the [[lunar theory]] of System B. However, the conclusion that Kidinnu is the main creator of System B is uncertain. Babylonian astronomers before Kidinnu's time apparently already knew the [[Saros cycle]] (old eclipse observations were collected in tables organised according to the Saros cycle since the late 5th century BC) and the [[Metonic cycle]] (the dates of the lunar calendar in the Saros tables follow a regular 19-year pattern of embolismic months at least since 498 BC); both cycles are also used in System B.  Schnabel computed specific years (first 314 BC and later 379 BC) for the origin of the System B lunar theory, but [[Franz Xaver Kugler]] and [[Otto E. Neugebauer]] later disproved Schnabel's calculations.  Schnabel also asserted that Kidinnu discovered [[precession]] when distinguishing between [[sidereal year|sidereal]] and [[tropical year]]s; Neugebauer contested this and current scholarship considers this conclusion to be unfounded.

The lunation length used in System B has also been attributed to Kidinnu.  It is 29 days + 191 time degrees + 1/72 of a time degree (&quot;barley corn&quot;) = 29&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; 31:50:8:20 ([[sexagesimal]]) = 29&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; + 12&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt; + 793/1080&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt; (Hebrew ''chelek'')  = 29.53059414...&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;. Being a rounded value in the archaic unit of &quot;barley corns&quot; it may be even more ancient.  In any case, it is very accurate, within about ⅓ of a second per month. [[Hipparchus]] confirmed this value for the lunation length.  [[Ptolemy]] accepted and used it, as mentioned above.  [[Hillel II|Hillel]] first used it in the [[Hebrew calendar]], and it has been used for that purpose ever since.

The existing evidence makes it difficult to put Kidinnu at a time and place.  Schnabel placed Kidinnu in Sippar, but [[Otto E. Neugebauer]] showed that Schnabel based this conclusion on a misreading of the cuneiform tablet. Classical sources like Strabo mention different &quot;schools&quot; and &quot;doctrines&quot; followed in different places (Babylon, Borsippa, Sippar, Uruk).  System A and B have been used contemporaneously, and tablets for both systems have been found in both Babylon and Uruk. Tablets based on System B, associated with Kidinnu, have been found mostly in Uruk, but the earlier tablets came predominantly from Babylon. The oldest preserved tablet using System B comes from Babylon and dates from 258-257 BC. This is in the [[Seleucid era]], but it is plausible that the traditional Chaldean astronomical systems had been developed before the Hellenistic period.  The Alexander chronicle mentioned above suggests that the famous astronomer Kidinnu died in Babylon in 330 BC, ''if'' it refers to the same Kidinnu who was mentioned on the ephemeris tablets centuries later.

==Worldwide==
*[[Nonviolent Radical Party Transnational and Transparty]] (1989–present)

==Europe==
In the western Mediterranean European countries, Radicalism was one of the major political movements between [[Revolutions of 1848|1848]] and [[Fall of France|1940]]. Such parties were often labelled 'Democratic', 'Radical democratic', or 'Radical liberal' parties:

* In [[France]]:
**[[Radical Left (France)]] (1881-1940), parliamentary group of the [[Independent Radicals]].
**[[Radical Party (France)|Radical-Socialist Party (France)]] (1901–2017)
**[[Radical Party of the Left]] (1971–2017)
**[[Radical Movement]] (2017–present), merger of the Radical Party and the Radical Party of the Left
**[[Radical Party of the Left]] (2019-present), re-founded by members of the Radical Movement who disagreed with the party's alliance with [[La République En Marche!|La République en Marche!]]
* In [[Italy]]:
**[[Italian Radical Party]] (1877–1925)
**[[Radical Party (Italy)]] (1955–1989)
**[[Italian Radicals]] (2001–present)
**[[Radicals of the Left]] (2004–2010)
**Radical Socialist Movement (2006-present), formed by dissidents members of the Radicals of the Left
**Liberty and Equality (2010-present), formed by dissidents members of the Radicals of the Left
* In [[Spain]], Radicalism took the form of various parties labelled 'democratic', 'progressive', 'radical' and 'republican':
** the [[Progressive Party (Spain)|Progressive Party]] (1835–69), formed by former participants in the radical Revolution of 1820;
** the [[Democratic Party (Spain)|Democratic Party]] (1849–69) a Spanish progressive party of [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] and [[Revolutions of 1848|1848er]] inspiration, active in the 1850s.
** the Federal Democratic Republican Party (1868–1910)
** the Democratic Radical Party (1869–80), successor the Progressive Party. It was refounded in 1880, following splinters, as the Progressive Democratic Party (1880–1912)
** the successor Democratic Party (1876–9) reformed as the Possibilist Democratic Party (1879–90)
** The Radical-Republican Party (1908–40), a splinter of the Progressive Democratic Party;
** Its splinter, the [[Radical Socialist Republican Party|Radical-Socialist Republican Party]] (1928–34). This merged with others to form the [[Republican Left (Spain)|Republican Left]] (1934–59)
** A second splinter of the Radical-Republican Party formed the Republican Democratic Party and [[Republican Union (Spain, 1934)|Republican Union]] (1934–59)

In the [[Low Countries|Dutch-speaking]], [[List of territorial entities where German is an official language|German-speaking]] and [[Nordic countries]], the English or French term Radical was represented by terms that literally translated as 'Free-Minded' (or, alternatively, as '[[Freethinker]]' or '[[Rationalism|Rationalist]]'), including:

* In [[Switzerland]]:
** the original Radical Party (1830s&amp;ndash;1894), see [[Regeneration (Switzerland)]]
** the comparatively left-leaning successor party known as the [[Radical Democratic Party of Switzerland|Radical-Democratic Party]] (in French) and the ''Free-minded Democratic Party'' (German) (1878 to present)
** the comparatively right-leaning successor party known as the [[Radical Liberal Party of Switzerland|Radical-Liberal Party]] (1893 to 2009), and its successor the [[FDP.The Liberals|FDP]], whose name translates to the ''Free-minded and Liberal Party'' in German and the ''Radical and Liberal Party'' in French (2009–present)
* In [[Luxembourg]]: 
** the [[Liberal League (Luxembourg)|Liberal League]] (1904–28), although predominantly [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] rather than Radical, contained a left-wing faction of Radical ideology;
** the [[Radical Socialist Party (Luxembourg)|Radical Socialist Party]] (1925–1932), founded by the splinter of the left-wing of the old Liberal League;
** the [[Radical Party (Luxembourg)]] (1928–1932), founded by the splinter of the right-wing of the Radical Socialist Party.

** the [[Radical League]] (1892–1901)
** the [[Free-thinking Democratic League|Free-minded Democratic League]] (1901-1946)
**the [[Political Party of Radicals]] (1968–1991)
* In [[Germany]], a succession of Radical parties existed:
** The [[German Free-minded Party]] (1884 to 1893), which split into two successors:
** the left-leaning [[Free-minded Union]] (1893 to 1910)
** and the centre-leaning the [[Free-minded People's Party (Germany)|Free-minded People's Party]] (1893 to 1910)
** These merged as the [[Progressive People's Party (Germany)|Progressive People's Party]] (1910 to 1918)
** This was reformed as the [[German Democratic Party]] (1918 to 1930).
* In [[Scandinavia]]:
** In [[Denmark]], the current Liberal Party began as a Radical Party, hence its name in Danish ([[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre, 'Left']]). The Radical wing split off from the classical-liberal majority in 1905 to form a new party, known as [[Danish Social Liberal Party|Radikale Venstre]] (Radical Left).
** In [[Sweden]], the [[Free-minded National Association]] (1902 to 1934)
** In [[Norway]], the [[Free-minded Liberal Party]] (1909 to 1932) and Free-minded People's Party (1932 to 1935)
** In [[Finland]], the [[Young Finnish Party|Young Finns]] (1905-1918), its successor the [[National Progressive Party (Finland)|National Progressive Party]] (1919–51), and its successor the [[Liberal League (Finland)|Free-minded League]] (1951 to 1965)

In south-eastern Europe, Radicalism was also a historically important political movement:

* In [[Bulgaria]], the [[Radical Democratic Party (Bulgaria)|Radical Democratic Party]] (1902–present)
* In [[Greece]]
** the [[Party of Radicals (Ionian Islands)|Party of Radicals]] (1848-1864) of the [[United States of the Ionian Islands]]
** the Venizelist splinter from the Liberal Party () and the Democratic Party ()
* In [[Romania]] (see [[List of political parties in Romania#Parties active before 1918|list of historical political parties in Romania]])
** the Free and Independent Fraction (1864-1884)
** the National Liberal Party (1875-1940)
** the [[Radical Party (Romania)|Radical Party]] (1884–19??), splinter of the former;
* In [[Serbia]]
** the Serbian Progressive Party (1881-1919)
** the [[People's Radical Party]] (1881–1926)
** the Independent Radical Party (1903-1919),  left-wing splinter of the former
** the [[State Party of Serbian, Croatian and Slovene Democrats]] (1919-1946) and its splinter, the [[Yugoslav Democratic Party|Republican and Democratic Party]] (1924-1946)
** the [[Serbian Radical Party]] (1991–present)
* In [[Turkey]], the [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (1919-1980)

In Central and Eastern Europe, Radicalism was less potent but nonetheless prominent political force:

* In [[Czechoslovakia]] and its predecessor territories:
** the [[Young Czech Party]] (1874-1918)
** the [[Czech National Social Party]] (1897–present)
*In [[Russia]] and its historical territories:
**[[Constitutional Democratic Party]]
**[[Trudoviks|Trudovik Party]] 
*In [[Ukraine]] and its predecessor territories:
**the [[Ruthenian-Ukrainian Radical Party]] (1890-1926)

{{Decadebox BC|109}}

==Events and trends==
* [[1090 BC]]—or the Year of the [[Hyena]]s, in the reign of [[Ramesses XI]], was a year of catastrophe. There was a very significant drop in the flow of river [[Nile]] waters, caused by a spike in climate normality. This led to significant starvation of the [[Egyptians]], loss of faith in the religion as conducted by the high priest and collapse not only of the state in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] but also its economy, leading to a ten-year period of chaos. This led to the emergence of [[tomb robber]]s and the end of the [[Valley of the Kings]] as a burial site.&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Lives: The Story of the Pharaohs' Tombmakers

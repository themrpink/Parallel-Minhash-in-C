==Types of buds==
[[File:Plant Buds clasification.svg|thumb|270px|right|Plant buds classification]]
[[File:Ficus bud.JPG|Bud of ''[[Ficus carica]]''|thumb|270px|right|Terminal, vegetative bud of ''[[Ficus carica]]'']]
Buds are often useful in the identification of plants, especially for woody plants in winter when leaves have fallen.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Trelease, W. |origyear=1931|year= 1967 |title=Winter botany: An Identification Guide to Native Trees and Shrubs |publisher=Dover Publications, Inc |location=New York |isbn=0486218007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Buds may be classified and described according to different criteria: location, status, morphology, and function.

Botanists commonly use  the following terms:
*for location:
**'''{{vanchor|terminal}}''', when located at the tip of a stem  ('''apical''' is equivalent but rather reserved for the one at the top of the plant);
**'''[[Axillary bud|axillary]]''', when located in the axil of a leaf ('''lateral''' is the equivalent but some adventitious buds may be lateral too);
**'''[[Adventitiousness#Adventitious buds and shoots|adventitious]]''', when occurring elsewhere, for example on trunk or on roots (some adventitious buds may be former axillary ones reduced and hidden under the bark, other adventitious buds are completely new formed ones).
*for status:
**'''accessory''', for secondary buds formed besides a principal  bud (axillary or terminal);
**'''resting''', for buds that form at the end of a growth season, which will lie dormant until onset of the next growth season;
**'''dormant''' or '''latent''', for buds whose growth has been delayed for a rather long time. The term is usable as a synonym of ''resting'', but is better employed for buds waiting undeveloped for years, for example '''[[Epicormic shoot#Epicormic buds|epicormic buds]]''';
**'''pseudoterminal''', for an axillary bud taking over the function of a terminal bud (characteristic of species whose growth is [[sympodial]]: terminal  bud dies and is replaced by the closer axillary bud, for examples [[beech]], [[persimmon]], ''[[Platanus]]'' have sympodial growth).
*for morphology:
**'''scaly''' or '''covered''' ('''perulate'''), when scales, also referred to as a perule (lat. perula, perulaei) (which are in fact transformed and reduced leaves) cover and protect the embryonic parts;
**'''naked''', when not covered by scales;
**'''hairy''', when also protected by hairs (it may apply either to scaly or to naked buds).
*for function:
**'''vegetative''', if only containing vegetative pieces: embryonic shoot with leaves (a '''leaf bud''' is the same);
**'''reproductive''', if containing embryonic flower(s) (a '''flower bud''' is the same);
**'''mixed''', if containing both embryonic leaves and flowers.

[[File:Kevin Bacon, James Purefoy (7606385516).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Kevin Bacon with [[James Purefoy]], who has a Bacon number of 2: Purefoy appeared in ''[[Women Talking Dirty]]'' with [[Helena Bonham Carter]], and Bonham Carter appeared in ''[[Novocaine (film)|Novocaine]]'' with Bacon. (Both actors were main cast on ''[[The Following]]'', but television works are excluded from the game.)]]
'''Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon''' or '''Bacon's Law''' is a [[parlour game|parlor game]] where players challenge each other to find the shortest path between an arbitrary actor and prolific actor [[Kevin Bacon]], linked by films they have appeared in together. It rests on the assumption that anyone involved in the [[Hollywood]] film industry can be linked through their film roles to Bacon within six steps. The game's name is a reference to &quot;[[six degrees of separation]]&quot;, a concept which posits that any two people on Earth are six or fewer acquaintance links apart. 

In 2007, Bacon started a [[charitable organization]] called [[SixDegrees.org]]. In 2020, Bacon started a [[podcast]] called The Last Degree of Kevin Bacon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Kevin Bacon's best friend definitely wants to murder him in exclusive trailer for his new podcast|url=https://ew.com/podcasts/2020/02/12/the-last-degree-of-kevin-bacon-spotify-podcast-trailer/|website=EW.com|language=EN|access-date=2020-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In a January 1994 interview with [[Premiere (magazine)|''Premiere'' magazine]] Kevin Bacon mentioned while discussing the film ''[[The River Wild]]'' that &quot;he had worked with everybody in Hollywood or someone who's worked with them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2012/09/13/google_adds_six_degrees_of_kevin_bacon_to_search_engine.html|title=Google adds Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon to search engine|last=Teotonio|first=Isabel|date=September 13, 2012|website=Toronto Star|access-date=January 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, a lengthy [[newsgroup]] thread which was headed &quot;Kevin Bacon is the Center of the Universe&quot; appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.movies/browse_frm/thread/faa36e7ba4704e7f/58cbe670d2acbcd7 |title=Kevin Bacon is the Center of the Universe |last=Ruthven |first=Alexander |date=April 7, 1994 |work=rec.arts.movies |publisher=Google groups |access-date=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four [[Albright College]] students invented the game that became known as &quot;Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; after watching two movies featuring Bacon back to back, ''[[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]]'' and ''[[The Air Up There]]''. During the second they began to speculate on how many movies Bacon had been in and the number of people with whom he had worked.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} 

They wrote a letter to talk show host [[Jon Stewart]], telling him that &quot;Kevin Bacon was the center of the entertainment universe&quot; and explaining the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;/&gt; They appeared on ''[[The Jon Stewart Show]]'' and ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' with Bacon to explain the game. Bacon admitted that he initially disliked the game because he believed it was ridiculing him, but he eventually came to enjoy it. The three inventors released a book, ''Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon'' ({{ISBN|9780452278448}}), with an introduction written by Bacon.&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fass |first1=Craig |first2=Brian |last2=Turtle |first3=Mike |last3=Ginelli |title=Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon |year=1996 |publisher=[[Plume (publishing)|Plume]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-452-27844-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/sixdegreesofkevi00fass }}&lt;/ref&gt; A board game based on the concept was released by Endless Games.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Bacon appeared in a commercial for the [[Visa (company)|Visa]] [[check card]] that parodied the game. In the commercial, Bacon wants to write a check to buy a book, but the clerk asks for his ID, which he does not have. He leaves and returns with a group of people, then says to the clerk, &quot;Okay, I was in a movie with an extra, Eunice, whose hairdresser, Wayne, attended Sunday school with Father O'Neill, who plays racquetball with Dr. Sanjay, who recently removed the appendix of Kim, who dumped you sophomore year. So you see, we're practically brothers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afJRKbBEr2Q |title=VISA CHECK CARD The Six Degrees Of Kevin Bacon |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=Sep 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, [[Dave Barry]], in a column describing the unexpected complications that emerged when he attempted to find out the precise wording of the [[Lone Ranger]]'s catchphrase, connected the Lone Ranger to Kevin Bacon in the following way: the Lone Ranger was the [[Green Hornet]]'s great-uncle; the Green Hornet and [[O. J. Simpson]] both hung out with [[Kato (disambiguation)|people named Kato]]; Simpson and [[Robert Wagner]] co-starred in ''[[The Towering Inferno]]''; Wagner and Bacon co-starred in ''[[Wild Things (film)|Wild Things]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Barry, ''Boogers Are My Beat'' (New York: Three Rivers Press, 2003), 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was also presented in an episode of the TV show ''[[Mad About You]]'' dated November 19, 1996, in which a character expressed the opinion that every actor is only three degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon. Bacon spoofed the concept himself in a cameo he performed for the independent film ''[[We Married Margo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://web.mac.com/jdshapiro/Site/WeMarriedMargo.html#1 | title = We Married Margo | work = J.D. Shapiro's Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing himself in a 2003 episode of ''[[Will and Grace]]'', Bacon connects himself to [[Val Kilmer]] through [[Tom Cruise]] and jokes &quot;Hey, that was a short one!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Will and Grace'', Season 5 episode 2 &quot;Bacon and Eggs&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The headline of ''[[The Onion]]'', a satirical newspaper, on October 30, 2002, was &quot;Kevin Bacon Linked To [[Al-Qaeda]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonion.com/articles/kevin-bacon-linked-to-alqaeda,37/|title=The Onion, Volume 38, Issue 40|publisher=theonion.com |date= |accessdate=May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacon provides the voice-over commentary for the [[NY Skyride]] attraction at the [[Empire State Building]] in [[New York City]]. At several points throughout the commentary, Bacon alludes to his connections to Hollywood stars via other actors with whom he has worked.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

[[Turner Classic Movies]]’ annual ''[[31 Days of Oscar]]'' festival sometimes utilizes a promotional tactic called “360 Degrees of Oscar” (based on Bacon’s theoretical game) where TCM takes a significant actor, actress, director, or producer, and evolves its entire festival around them (the first and last films in the festival feature their works).  It has been used as recently as 2020.

In 2009, Bacon narrated a [[National Geographic Channel]] show &quot;The Human Family Tree&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/episode/the-human-family-tree-3706/Overview | title = The Human Family Tree | publisher = [[National Geographic Channel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a program which describes the efforts of that organization's [[Genographic Project]] to establish the genetic interconnectedness of all humans. In 2011, [[James Franco]] made reference to Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon while hosting the [[83rd Academy Awards]]. In the summer of 2012, [[Google]] began to offer the ability to find an actor's Bacon number on its main page, by searching for the actor's name preceded by the phrase &quot;bacon number&quot;.
[[EE (telecommunications company)|EE]] began a UK television advertising campaign on November 3, 2012, based on the Six Degrees concept, where Kevin Bacon illustrates his connections and draws attention to how the EE 4G network allows similar connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.saatchi.co.uk/news/archive/ee_debuts_multi-million_pound_marketing_launch_campaign_starring_kevin_bacon_ | title = EE debuts multi-million pound marketing launch campaign starring Kevin Bacon | publisher = The Lovemarks Company, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi London | accessdate=November 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most highly connected nodes of the Internet have been referred to as &quot;the 'Kevin Bacons' of the Web,&quot; inasmuch as they enable most users to navigate to most sites in 19 clicks or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/science/2013/02/any-two-pages-on-the-web-are-connected-by-19-clicks-or-less/ |title=Any Two Pages on the Web Are Connected By 19 Clicks or Less |work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] |last=Stromberg |first=Joseph |date=February 18, 2013 |accessdate=March 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Discussion: Network science |author=Albert-László Barabási |date=February 18, 2013 |volume=371 |doi=10.1098/rsta.2012.0375 |pmid=23419844 |issue=1987 |pages=20120375 |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]] |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic]]'s song &quot;Lame Claim to Fame,&quot; one of the lines is, &quot;I know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who knows Kevin Bacon.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://genius.com/3432173/Weird-al-yankovic-lame-claim-to-fame/I-know-a-guy-who-knows-a-guy-who-knows-a-guy-who-knows-a-guy-who-knows-a-guy-who-knows-kevin-bacon|title=I know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy / Who knows a guy who knows Kevin Bacon|website=Genius}}&lt;/ref&gt; American rapper MC Zappa also makes reference to the game in his 2018 song &quot;Level Up (The Ill Cypher)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://genius.com/16599085/Mc-zappa-level-up-the-ill-cypher/Word-they-be-chasin-heaven-like-jason-nevin-but-theres-more-degrees-of-separation-than-kevin-bacon|title=Word; they be chasin' heaven like Jason Nevin / But there's more degrees of separation than Kevin Bacon|website=Genius}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bacon numbers ==
The '''Bacon number''' of an [[actor]] is the number of degrees of separation he or she has from Bacon, as defined by the game. This is an application of the [[Erdős number]] concept to the [[Hollywood]] movie industry. The higher the Bacon number, the greater the separation from Kevin Bacon the actor is.

The computation of a Bacon number for actor X is a &quot;[[Shortest path problem|shortest path]]&quot; [[algorithm]], applied to the [[co-stardom network]]:
* Kevin Bacon himself has a Bacon number of 0.
* Those actors who have worked directly with Kevin Bacon have a Bacon number of 1.
* If the lowest Bacon number of any actor with whom X has appeared in any movie is N, X's Bacon number is N+1.

===Examples===
[[Elvis Presley]]:
* Elvis Presley was in ''[[Change of Habit]]'' (1969) with [[Edward Asner]]
* Edward Asner was in ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (1991) with Kevin Bacon

Therefore, Asner has a Bacon number of 1, and Presley (who never appeared in a film with Bacon) has a Bacon number of 2.

[[Ian McKellen]]:
* Ian McKellen was in ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014) with [[Michael Fassbender]] and [[James McAvoy]]
* McAvoy and Fassbender were in ''[[X-Men: First Class]]'' (2011) with Kevin Bacon

Therefore, McAvoy and Fassbender have Bacon numbers of 1, and McKellen has a Bacon number of 2.

Because some people have both a finite Bacon ''and'' a finite [[Erdős number]] because of acting and publications, there are a rare few who have a finite [[Erdős–Bacon number]], which is defined as the sum of a person's independent Erdős and Bacon numbers.

==Center of the Hollywood Universe==
While at the [[University of Virginia]], Brett Tjaden created the Oracle of Bacon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oracleofbacon.org/|title=The Oracle of Bacon|website=oracleofbacon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A previous version of this computer program used information on some 800,000 people from the [[Internet Movie Database]] (IMDb), while the current implementation uses data drawn from Wikipedia. The algorithm calculates &quot;how good a center&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oracleofbacon.org/cgi-bin/center-cgi | work = The Oracle of Bacon | title = How good a center an actor is? | first = Patrick | last = Reynolds}}&lt;/ref&gt; an individual IMDb personality is, i.e. a [[Weighted mean|weighted average]] of the degree of separation of all the people that link to that particular person. The site returns an average ''personality'' number, e.g. for [[Clint Eastwood]], it returns an average &quot;Clint Eastwood Number.&quot; From there the Oracle site posits &quot;The Center of the Hollywood Universe&quot; as being the person with the lowest average personality number. Kevin Bacon, as it turns out, is not the &quot;Center of the Hollywood Universe&quot; (i.e. the most linkable actor). In fact, Bacon does not even make the top 100 list of average personality numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oracleofbacon.org/center_list.php | work = The Oracle of Bacon | title = 1000 best centers | first = Patrick | last = Reynolds}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he is not the most linkable actor, this still signifies being a better center than more than 99% of the people who have ever appeared in a film. Since each actor's average personality number can change with each new film made, the center can and does shift. &quot;Centers&quot; have included [[Rod Steiger]], [[Donald Sutherland]], [[Eric Roberts]], [[Dennis Hopper]], [[Christopher Lee]] and [[Harvey Keitel]].

A 2020 study from [[Cardiff University]] also used further measures to determine the center of the movie universe.&lt;ref&gt;
Lewis, R. [https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11103 &quot;Who is the Centre of the Movie Universe? Using Python and NetworkX to Analyse the Social Network of Movie Stars&quot;], ''arXiv:2002.11103'', Feb 2020&lt;/ref&gt; These included degree centrality, closeness centrality and betweenness centrality, which were implemented using the [[NetworkX]] Python Library. The study also looked at movies released in different decades and found that, between 2000 and 2020, the most central actors included [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Brahmanandam]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], and [[Ben Kingsley]].

== Photography book ==
Inspired by the game, the British photographer [[Andy Gotts]] tried to reach Kevin Bacon through photographic links instead of film links.

Gotts wrote to 300 actors asking to take their pictures, and received permission only from [[Joss Ackland]]. Ackland then suggested that Gotts photograph [[Greta Scacchi]], with whom he had appeared in the film ''[[White Mischief (film)|White Mischief]]''. Gotts proceeded from there, asking each actor to refer him to one or more friends or colleagues. Eventually, [[Christian Slater]] referred him to Bacon. Gotts' photograph of Bacon completed the project, eight years after it began. Gotts published the photos in a book, ''Degrees'' ({{ISBN|0-9546843-6-2}}), with text by [[Alan Bates]], [[Pierce Brosnan]], and Bacon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.clooneystudio.com/degrees2.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071013051515/http://clooneystudio.com/degrees2.html | archivedate = October 13, 2007 | title = Andy Gotts' Degrees Exhibition | work = Clooney Studio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Rufus Shafter''' (October 16, 1835 &amp;ndash; November 12, 1906) was a [[Union Army]] officer during the [[American Civil War]] who received America's highest military decoration, the [[Medal of Honor]], for his actions at the [[Battle of Fair Oaks &amp; Darbytown Road|Battle of Fair Oaks]]. Shafter also played a prominent part as a [[Major general (United States)|major general]] in the [[Spanish–American War]]. [[Fort Shafter]], [[Hawaii]], is named for him, as well as the city of [[Shafter, California]] and the ghost town of [[Shafter, Texas]]. He was nicknamed &quot;Pecos Bill&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;TSHAhandbk-Shafter&quot; /&gt; after the [[Pecos Bill|fictional character of the same name]].

==Early life==
Shafter was born in [[Galesburg, Michigan]] on October 16, 1835. He worked as a teacher and farmer in the years preceding the Civil War.

==Civil War and Indian campaigns==
Shafter served as a 1st lieutenant the [[Union Army]]'s [[7th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] at the battles of [[Battle of Ball's Bluff|Ball's Bluff]] and [[Battle of Fair Oaks|Fair Oaks]]. He was wounded at the [[Battle of Fair Oaks]] and later received the Medal of Honor for heroism during the battle. He led a charge on the first day of the battle and was wounded towards the close of that day's fighting. In order to stay with his regiment he concealed his wounds, fighting on the second day of the battle. On August 22, 1862, he was mustered out of the volunteer service but returned to the field as major in the [[19th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment]]. He was captured at the [[Battle of Thompson's Station]] and spent three months in a [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] prison. In April 1864 after his release he was appointed [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] of the [[17th United States Colored Infantry]] and led the regiment at the [[Battle of Nashville]].

By the end of the war, he had been promoted to [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general of volunteers]]. He stayed in the [[Regular Army (United States)|regular army]] when the war ended. During his subsequent service in the [[Indian Wars]], he received his &quot;Pecos Bill&quot; nickname. He led the 24th Infantry, another [[United States Colored Troops]] regiment, in campaigns against the [[Cheyenne]], [[Comanche]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]] and [[Kiowa]] Indians in [[Texas]]. While commander of [[Fort Davis National Historic Site|Fort Davis]], he started a controversial court-martial of second lieutenant [[Henry Flipper]], the first black cadet to graduate from West Point. In May 1897 he was appointed as a [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]].

==Spanish–American War==

Just before the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, Shafter was commander of the Department of [[California]]. Shafter was an unlikely candidate for command of the expedition to Cuba. He was aged 63,{{clarify|date=May 2009|reason=should 63 be &quot;62&quot; or &quot;approaching 63&quot; if war started early 1898 and he left Cuba in September anyway?}} weighed over 300 pounds and suffered from [[gout]]. Nevertheless, he received a promotion to Major General of Volunteers and command of the [[Fifth Army Corps (Spanish-American War)|Fifth Army Corps]] being assembled in Tampa, Florida. One possible reason for his being given this command was his lack of political ambitions.

Shafter appeared to maintain a very loose control over the expedition to Cuba from the beginning, commencing with a very disorganized landing at Daiquiri on the southern coast of Cuba. Confusion prevailed over landing priorities and the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]]. When [[Samuel S. Sumner|General Sumner]] refused to allow the Army's [[Gatling Gun]] Detachment - which had priority - to disembark from the transport ''Cherokee'' on the grounds that the lieutenant commanding the detachment did not have the rank to enforce his priority, Shafter had to personally intervene, returning to the ship in a steam launch to enforce his demand that the guns come off immediately.&lt;ref name=&quot;qlg3m&quot; /&gt;

During the disembarkation, Shafter sent forward Fifth Corps' Cavalry Division under [[Joseph Wheeler]] to reconnoiter the road to [[Santiago de Cuba]]. In a complete (alleged, look for and read after action reports from Lt. Colonel Roosevelt and Colonel Wood.) disregard of orders, Wheeler brought on a fight which escalated into the [[Battle of Las Guasimas]]. Shafter apparently did not realize the battle was even underway nor did he say anything to Wheeler about it afterward.

A plan was finally developed for the attack on Santiago. Shafter would send his 1st Division (at the time, brigade and division numbers were not unique outside their parent formation) to [[Battle of El Caney|attack El Caney]] while his 2nd Division and the Cavalry Division would attack the heights south of El Caney known as San Juan Hill. Originally, Shafter planned to lead his forces from the front, but he suffered greatly from the tropical heat and was confined to his headquarters far to the rear and out of sight of the fighting. Unable to see the battle firsthand, he never developed a coherent chain of command. Shafter's offensive battle plans were both simplistic and extremely vague. He seemed to be unaware or unconcerned about the mass killing effect of modern military weapons technology possessed by the Spanish. Further, his intelligence-gathering efforts on Spanish troop dispositions and equipment was extremely meager, though he had a number of sources available to him, including reconnaissance reports by Cuban rebel forces as well as espionage obtained from indigenous Cubans.

During the hurried attack on El Caney and [[Battles of San Juan Hill and Kettle Hill|San Juan Heights]], American forces, who had packed the available roads and were unable maneuver, suffered heavy losses from Spanish troops equipped with modern repeating smokeless powder rifles and breech-loading artillery, while the short-ranged black-powder guns of U.S. artillery units were unable to respond effectively. Additional casualties were incurred in the actual assault, which was marked by a series of brave but disorganized and uncoordinated advances. After suffering some 1,400 casualties, and aided by a single Gatling Gun detachment for fire support, American troops successfully stormed and occupied both El Caney and San Juan Heights.

The next task for Shafter was the investment and siege of the city of Santiago and its garrison. However, the extent of the American losses were becoming known at Shafter's headquarters back at Sevilla (his gout, poor physical condition, and huge bulk did not allow him to go to the front). The casualties were delivered not only by messenger report, but also by &quot;meat wagons&quot; delivering the wounded and dying to the hospital. Viewing the carnage, Shafter began to waver in his determination to defeat the Spanish at Santiago. He knew his troops' position was tenuous, but again had little intelligence on the hardships of the Spanish inside beleaguered Santiago. Shafter felt the Navy was doing little to relieve the pressure on his forces. Supplies could not be delivered to the front, leaving his men in want of necessities, particularly food rations. Shafter himself was ill, and very weak. With this view of events, Shafter sent a dramatic message to Washington. He suggested that the army should give up its attack and all its gains for the day, and withdraw to safer ground about five miles away. Fortunately, by the time this message reached Washington, Shafter changed his mind, and instead renewed siege operations after demanding the Spanish surrender the city and garrison of Santiago. With the victory of the U.S. Navy at the [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba]], by Admirals [[William T. Sampson]] and [[Winfield Scott Schley]], the fate of the Spanish position at Santiago was sealed. Shortly afterward, the Spanish commander surrendered the city.

==Postwar career and retirement==
With disease rampant in the American army in Cuba, Shafter and many of his officers favored a quick withdrawal from Cuba. Shafter personally left Cuba in September 1898, and after a stay in quarantine at [[Camp Wikoff]], Shafter returned to command the [[Department of California]]. There he oversaw the supplying of the expedition to the Philippines. In January 1900, Shafter offered the following opinion on the [[Philippine–American War|war in the Philippines]]: &quot;My plan would be to disarm the natives of the Philippine Islands, even if I have to kill half of them to do it. Then I would treat the rest of them with perfect justice.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;KBhrF&quot; /&gt;

Shafter was a member of the [[Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States]], the [[Military Order of Foreign Wars]] and the [[Sons of the American Revolution]].

Shafter retired in 1901 and retired to a {{convert|60|acre|ha}} farm, next to his daughter's land&lt;ref name=&quot;TSHAhandbk-Shafter&quot; /&gt; in Bakersfield, California. He died there in 1906 and is buried at [[San Francisco National Cemetery]].

==In popular culture==
-Shafter was portrayed by [[Rodger Boyce]] in the 1997 film ''[[Rough Riders (film)|Rough Riders]]''. Shafter was in the 1898 film [[Surrender of General Toral]].

-Shafter is also notable for the fact that he has the highest known [[Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon|Bacon Number]] in the parlour game Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, at 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.kids.net.au/page/ba/Bacon_number___William_Rufus_Shafter|title=Kids.Net.Au - Encyclopedia &gt; Bacon number William Rufus Shafter|website=encyclopedia.kids.net.au|access-date=2020-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

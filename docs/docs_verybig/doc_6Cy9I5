Gulliver becomes a member of a horse's household and comes to both admire and emulate the Houyhnhnms and their way of life, rejecting his fellow humans as merely Yahoos endowed with some semblance of reason which they only use to exacerbate and add to the vices Nature gave them. However, an Assembly of the Houyhnhnms rules that Gulliver, a Yahoo with some semblance of reason, is a danger to their civilization and commands him to swim back to the land that he came from. Gulliver's &quot;Master,&quot; the Houyhnhnm who took him into his household, buys him time to create a canoe to make his departure easier. After another disastrous voyage, he is rescued against his will by a Portuguese ship. He is disgusted to see that Captain Pedro de Mendez, whom he considers a Yahoo, is a wise, courteous, and generous person.

He returns to his home in England, but is unable to reconcile himself to living among &quot;Yahoos&quot; and becomes a recluse, remaining in his house, avoiding his family and his wife, and spending several hours a day speaking with the horses in his stables.

It is now generally accepted that the fourth voyage of ''Gulliver's Travels'' does embody a wholly pessimistic view of the place of man and the meaning of his existence in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Jan, Firdaus|first=K.

==Composition and history==
It is uncertain exactly when Swift started writing ''Gulliver's Travels''. (Much of the writing was done at Loughry Manor in [[Cookstown]], [[County Tyrone]], whilst Swift stayed there.) Some sources{{which|date=August 2013}} suggest as early as 1713 when Swift, Gay, Pope, [[John Arbuthnot|Arbuthnot]] and others formed the [[Scriblerus Club]] with the aim of satirising popular literary genres. According to these accounts, Swift was charged with writing the memoirs of the club's imaginary author, Martinus Scriblerus, and also with satirising the &quot;travellers' tales&quot; literary subgenre. It is known from Swift's correspondence that the composition proper began in 1720 with the mirror-themed Parts I and II written first, Part IV next in 1723 and Part III written in 1724; but amendments were made even while Swift was writing ''[[Drapier's Letters]]''. By August 1725 the book was complete; and as ''Gulliver's Travels'' was a transparently anti-[[British Whig Party|Whig]] satire, it is likely that Swift had the manuscript copied so that his handwriting could not be used as evidence if a prosecution should arise, as had happened in the case of some of his Irish [[pamphlet]]s (the ''Drapier's Letters''). In March 1726 Swift travelled to London to have his work published; the manuscript was secretly delivered to the publisher [[Benjamin Motte]], who used five printing houses to speed production and avoid piracy.&lt;ref&gt;Clive Probyn, ''Swift, Jonathan (1667–1745)'', ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' ([[Oxford University Press]]: [[Oxford]], 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Motte, recognising a best-seller but fearing prosecution, cut or altered the worst offending passages (such as the descriptions of the court contests in Lilliput and the rebellion of [[Lindalino]]), added some material in defence of Queen Anne to Part II, and published it. The first edition was released in two volumes on 28 October 1726, priced at 8''s''. ''6''d.''&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Journal'' 28 Oct 1726, &quot;This day is published&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Motte published ''Gulliver's Travels'' anonymously, and as was often the way with fashionable works, several follow-ups (''Memoirs of the Court of Lilliput''), parodies (''Two Lilliputian Odes, The first on the Famous Engine With Which Captain Gulliver extinguish'd the Palace Fire...'') and &quot;keys&quot; (''Gulliver Decipher'd'' and ''Lemuel Gulliver's Travels into Several Remote Regions of the World Compendiously Methodiz'd'', the second by [[Edmund Curll]] who had similarly written a &quot;key&quot; to Swift's ''[[Tale of a Tub]]'' in 1705) were swiftly produced. These were mostly printed anonymously (or occasionally pseudonymously) and were quickly forgotten. Swift had nothing to do with them and disavowed them in Faulkner's edition of 1735. Swift's friend [[Alexander Pope]] wrote a set of five ''Verses on Gulliver's Travels'', which Swift liked so much that he added them to the second edition of the book, though they are rarely included.

===Faulkner's 1735 edition===
In 1735 an Irish publisher, [[George Faulkner]], printed a set of Swift's works, Volume III of which was ''Gulliver's Travels''. As revealed in Faulkner's &quot;Advertisement to the Reader&quot;, Faulkner had access to an annotated copy of Motte's work by &quot;a friend of the author&quot; (generally believed to be Swift's friend Charles Ford) which reproduced most of the manuscript without Motte's amendments, the original manuscript having been destroyed. It is also believed that Swift at least reviewed proofs of Faulkner's edition before printing, but this cannot be proved. Generally, this is regarded as the ''[[Editio Princeps]]'' of ''Gulliver's Travels'' with one small exception. This edition had an added piece by Swift, ''A letter from Capt. Gulliver to his Cousin Sympson'', which complained of Motte's alterations to the original text, saying he had so much altered it that &quot;I do hardly know mine own work&quot; and repudiating all of Motte's changes as well as all the keys, libels, parodies, second parts and continuations that had appeared in the intervening years. This letter now forms part of many standard texts.

===Lindalino===
The five-paragraph episode in Part III, telling of the rebellion of the surface city of [[Lindalino]] against the flying island of Laputa, was an obvious allegory to the affair of ''[[Drapier's Letters]]'' of which Swift was proud. Lindalino represented [[Dublin]] and the impositions of Laputa represented the British imposition of [[William Wood (ironmaster)|William Wood]]'s poor-quality copper currency. Faulkner had omitted this passage, either because of political sensitivities raised by an Irish publisher printing an anti-British satire, or possibly because the text he worked from did not include the passage. In 1899 the passage was included in a new edition of the ''Collected Works''. Modern editions derive from the Faulkner edition with the inclusion of this 1899 addendum.

[[Isaac Asimov]] notes in ''The Annotated Gulliver'' that Lindalino is generally taken to be Dublin, being composed of double lins; hence, Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swift|first=Jonathan|editor=Isaac Asimov|title=The Annotated Gulliver's Travels|date=1980|publisher=Clarkson N Potter Inc|location=New York|isbn=0-517-539497|page=[https://archive.org/details/annotatedgullive0000swif/page/160 160]|url=https://archive.org/details/annotatedgullive0000swif/page/160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swift's Gulliver- Voyage to Brobdingnag The Metropolitan Museum of Art edit.jpg|thumb|upright|''The King of Brobdingnag and Gulliver'' by [[James Gillray]] (1803), (satirising [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and [[George III]]). [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]
''Gulliver's Travels'' has been the recipient of several designations: from [[Menippean satire]] to a children's story, from proto-science fiction to a forerunner of the modern novel.

Published seven years after [[Daniel Defoe]]'s successful ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', ''Gulliver's Travels'' may be read as a systematic rebuttal of Defoe's optimistic account of human capability. In ''The Unthinkable Swift: The Spontaneous Philosophy of a Church of England Man'', [[Warren Montag]] argues that Swift was concerned to refute the notion that the individual precedes society, as Defoe's novel seems to suggest. Swift regarded such thought as a dangerous endorsement of [[Thomas Hobbes]]' radical political philosophy and for this reason Gulliver repeatedly encounters established societies rather than desolate islands. The captain who invites Gulliver to serve as a surgeon aboard his ship on the disastrous third voyage is named Robinson.

Scholar Allan Bloom asserts that Swift's lampooning of the experiments of Laputa is the first questioning by a modern liberal democrat of the effects and cost on a society which embraces and celebrates policies pursuing scientific progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Allan Bloom|title=Giants and Dwarfs: An Outline of Gulliver's Travels|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1990|location=New York|pages=47–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swift wrote:
{{Quote |text=The first man I saw was of a meagre aspect, with sooty hands and face, his hair and beard long, ragged, and singed in several places. His clothes, shirt, and skin, were all of the same colour. He has been eight years upon a project for extracting sunbeams out of cucumbers, which were to be put in phials hermetically sealed, and let out to warm the air in raw inclement summers. He told me, he did not doubt, that, in eight years more, he should be able to supply the governor’s gardens with sunshine, at a reasonable rate: but he complained that his stock was low, and entreated me “to give him something as an encouragement to ingenuity, especially since this had been a very dear season for cucumbers.” I made him a small present, for my lord had furnished me with money on purpose, because he knew their practice of begging from all who go to see them.}}

A possible reason for the book's classic status is that it can be seen as many things to many people. Broadly, the book has three themes:
* A satirical view of the state of European government, and of petty differences between religions
* An inquiry into whether men are inherently corrupt or whether they become corrupted
* A restatement of the older &quot;ancients versus moderns&quot; controversy previously addressed by Swift in ''[[The Battle of the Books]]''

In storytelling and construction the parts follow a pattern:
* The causes of Gulliver's misadventures become more malignant as time goes on—he is first shipwrecked, then abandoned, then attacked by strangers, then attacked by his own crew.
* Gulliver's attitude hardens as the book progresses—he is genuinely surprised by the viciousness and politicking of the Lilliputians but finds the behaviour of the Yahoos in the fourth part reflective of the behaviour of people.
* Each part is the reverse of the preceding part—Gulliver is big/small/wise/ignorant, the countries are complex/simple/scientific/natural, and the forms of government are worse/better/worse/better than Britain's.
* Gulliver's viewpoint between parts is mirrored by that of his [[antagonist]]s in the contrasting part—Gulliver sees the tiny Lilliputians as being vicious and unscrupulous, and then the king of Brobdingnag sees Europe in exactly the same light; Gulliver sees the Laputians as unreasonable, and his Houyhnhnm master sees humanity as equally so.
* No form of government is ideal—the simplistic Brobdingnagians enjoy public executions and have streets infested with beggars, the honest and upright Houyhnhnms who have no word for lying are happy to suppress the true nature of Gulliver as a Yahoo and are equally unconcerned about his reaction to being expelled.
* Specific individuals may be good even where the race is bad—Gulliver finds a friend in each of his travels and, despite Gulliver's rejection and horror toward all Yahoos, is treated very well by the Portuguese captain, Don Pedro, who returns him to England at the novel's end.

Of equal interest is the character of Gulliver himself—he progresses from a cheery optimist at the start of the first part to the pompous [[misanthrope]] of the book's conclusion and we may well have to filter our understanding of the work if we are to believe the final misanthrope wrote the whole work. In this sense, ''Gulliver's Travels'' is a very modern and complex novel. There are subtle shifts throughout the book, such as when Gulliver begins to see all humans, not just those in Houyhnhnm-land, as Yahoos.&lt;ref name=&quot;1667-1745&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gulliver's travels : complete, authoritative text with biographical and historical contexts, critical history, and essays from five contemporary critical perspectives|last=Swift|first=Jonathan|others=Fox, Christopher|isbn=978-0312066659|location=Boston|oclc=31794911|date = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout, Gulliver is presented as being gullible.  He generally accepts what he is told at face value; he rarely perceives deeper meanings; and he is an honest man who expects others to be honest. This makes for fun and irony: what Gulliver says can be trusted to be accurate, and he does not always understand the meaning of what he perceives.

Also, although Gulliver is presented as a commonplace &quot;[[everyman]]&quot; with only a basic education, he possesses a remarkable natural gift for language. He quickly becomes fluent in the native tongues of the strange lands in which he finds himself, a literary device that adds verisimilitude and humour to Swift's work.

Despite the depth and subtlety of the book, as well as frequent [[Off-color humor|off-colour]] and [[Black comedy|black humour]], it is often mistakenly classified as a children's story because of the popularity of the Lilliput section (frequently [[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerised]]) as a book for children. Indeed, many adaptations of the story are squarely aimed at a young audience, and one can still buy books entitled ''Gulliver's Travels'' which contain only parts of the Lilliput voyage, and occasionally the Brobdingnag section.

=== Misogyny ===
Swift uses satire to openly mock [[misogyny]] throughout the book, with one of the most cited examples of this coming from Gulliver's description of a Brobdingnagian woman:

: &quot;I must confess no Object ever disgusted me so much as the Sight of her monstrous Breast, which I cannot tell what to compare with, so as to give the curious Reader an Idea of its Bulk, Shape, and Colour.... This made me reflect upon the fair Skins of our ''English'' Ladies, who appear so beautiful to us, only because they are of our own Size, and their Defects not to be seen but through a magnifying glass....&quot;

This open critique towards aspects of the female body is something that Swift often brings up in other works of his, particularly in poems such as ''The Lady's Dressing Room'' and ''A Beautiful Young Nymph Going To Bed''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Katharine M.|date=1959|title='My Female Friends': The Misogyny of Jonathan Swift|jstor=40753638|journal=Texas Studies in Literature and Language|volume=1|issue=3|pages=366–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A criticism of Swift's use of misogyny by [[Felicity A. Nussbaum]] proposes the idea that “Gulliver himself is a gendered object of satire, and his antifeminist sentiments may be among those mocked.” Gulliver’s own masculinity is often mocked, seen in how he is made to be a coward among the Brobdingnag people, repressed by the people of Lilliput, and viewed as an inferior Yahoo among the Houyhnhnms.&lt;ref name=&quot;1667-1745&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--gender characteristics generate from deeply meaningful personal ethic differences expressly associated with grammatical gender. Popular historical literature more likely create gender as known today, than criticize gender as known today; even if somehow the literature criticized gender as known when authoring. Also, characters rarely form models of behavior unless those characters exhibit difficulty to perfectly imitate but-rather models of behavior form from veritable what-ifs tested in the reader's reality--&gt;

Nussbaum goes on to say in her analysis of the misogyny of the stories that in the adventures, particularly in the first story, the satire isn't singularly focussed on satirizing women, but to satirize Gulliver himself as a politically naive and inept giant whose masculine authority comically seems to be in jeopardy &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gulliver's travels : complete, authoritative text with biographical and historical contexts, critical history, and essays from five contemporary critical perspectives|last=Swift, Jonathan|others=Fox, Christopher|isbn=0-312-10284-4|location=Boston|oclc=31794911|year = 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism of Swift's use of misogyny delves into Gulliver's repeated use of the word 'nauseous', and the way that Gulliver is fighting his emasculation by commenting on how he thinks the women of Brobdingnag are disgusting.

:&quot;Swift has Gulliver frequently invoke the sensory (as opposed to reflective) word &quot;nauseous&quot; to describe this and other magnified images in Brobdingnag not only to reveal the neurotic depths of Gulliver's misogyny, but also to show how male nausea can be used as a pathetic countermeasure against the perceived threat of female consumption. Swift has Gulliver associate these magnified acts of female consumption with the act of &quot;throwing-up&quot;—the opposite of and antidote to the act of gastronomic consumption.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Armintor |first=Deborah Needleman |date=2007 |title=The Sexual Politics of Microscopy in Brobdingnag |journal=SEL: Studies in English Literature 1500–1900 |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=619–40 |jstor=4625129|doi=10.1353/sel.2007.0022 |s2cid=154298114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This commentary of Deborah Needleman Armintor relies upon the way that the giant women do with Gulliver as they please, in much the same way as one might play with a toy, and get it to do everything one can think of.  Armintor's comparison focuses on the pocket microscopes that were popular in Swift's time.  She talks about how this instrument of science was transitioned to something toy-like and accessible, so it shifted into something that women favored, and thus men lose interest.  This is similar to the progression of Gulliver's time in Brobdingnag, from man of science to women's plaything.

=== Comic misanthropy ===
[[Misanthropy]] is a theme that scholars have identified in ''Gulliver's Travels.''  Arthur Case, R.S. Crane, and Edward Stone discuss [[Lemuel Gulliver|Gulliver]]'s development of misanthropy and come to the consensus that this theme ought to be viewed as comical rather than cynical.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;Case, Arthur E. “From ‘The Significance of ''Gulliver’s Travels''.’” ''A Casebook on Gulliver Among the Houyhnhnms'', edited by Milton P. Foster, Thomas Y. Crowell Company, 1961, pp. 139–47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;Crane, R.S. “The Houyhnhnms, the Yahoos, and the History of Ideas.” ''Twentieth Century Interpretations of Gulliver’s Travels: A Collection of Critical Essays'', edited by Frank Brady, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, Prentice-Hall, 1968, pp. 80–88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:22&quot;&gt;Stone, Edward. “Swift and the Horses: Misanthropy or Comedy?” ''A Casebook on Gulliver Among the Houyhnhnms'', edited by Milton P. Foster, Thomas Y. Crowell Company, 1961, pp. 180–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of Gulliver's development of misanthropy, these three scholars point to the fourth voyage.  According to Case, Gulliver is at first averse to identifying with the [[Yahoo (Gulliver's Travels)|Yahoos]], but, after he deems the [[Houyhnhnm]]s superior, he comes to believe that humans (including his fellow Europeans) are Yahoos due to their shortcomings.  Perceiving the Houyhnhnms as perfect, Gulliver thus begins to perceive himself and the rest of humanity as imperfect.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;  According to Crane, when Gulliver develops his misanthropic mindset, he becomes ashamed of humans and views them more in line with animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot; /&gt;  This new perception of Gulliver's, Stone claims, comes about because the Houyhnhnms' judgement pushes Gulliver to identify with the Yahoos.&lt;ref name=&quot;:22&quot; /&gt;  Along similar lines, Crane holds that Gulliver's misanthropy is developed in part when he talks to the Houyhnhnms about mankind because the discussions lead him to reflect on his previously held notion of humanity.  Specifically, Gulliver’s master, who is a Houyhnhnm, provides questions and commentary that contribute to Gulliver’s reflectiveness and subsequent development of misanthropy.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot; /&gt;  However, Case points out that Gulliver's dwindling opinion of humans may be blown out of proportion due to the fact that he is no longer able to see the good qualities that humans are capable of possessing.  Gulliver’s new view of humanity, then, creates his repulsive attitude towards his fellow humans after leaving Houyhnhnmland.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;  But in Stone's view, Gulliver’s actions and attitude upon his return can be interpreted as misanthropy that is exaggerated for comic effect rather than for a cynical effect.  Stone further suggests that Gulliver goes mentally mad and believes that this is what leads Gulliver to exaggerate the shortcomings of humankind.&lt;ref name=&quot;:22&quot; /&gt;  

Another aspect that Crane attributes to Gulliver’s development of misanthropy is that when in Houyhnhnmland, it is the animal-like beings (the Houyhnhnms) who exhibit reason and the human-like beings (the Yahoos) who seem devoid of reason; Crane argues that it is this switch from Gulliver’s perceived norm that leads the way for him to question his view of humanity.  As a result, Gulliver begins to identify humans as a type of Yahoo.  To this point, Crane brings up the fact that a traditional definition of man—''Homo est animal rationale'' (Humans are rational animals)—was prominent in academia around [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]]’s time.  Furthermore, Crane argues that Swift had to study this type of logic (see [[Porphyrian tree|Porphyrian Tree]]) in college, so it is highly likely that he intentionally inverted this logic by placing the typically given example of irrational beings—horses—in the place of humans and vice versa.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot; /&gt;

Stone points out that ''Gulliver's Travels'' takes a cue from the genre of the travel book, which was popular during Swift's time period.  From reading travel books, Swift’s contemporaries were accustomed to beast-like figures of foreign places; thus, Stone holds that the creation of the Yahoos was not out of the ordinary for the time period.  From this playing off of familiar genre expectations, Stone deduces that the parallels that Swift draws between the Yahoos and humans is meant to be humorous rather than cynical.  Even though Gulliver sees Yahoos and humans as if they are one and the same, Stone argues that Swift did not intend for readers to take on Gulliver’s view; Stone states that the Yahoos’ behaviors and characteristics that set them apart from humans further supports the notion that Gulliver's identification with Yahoos is not meant to be taken to heart.  Thus, Stone sees Gulliver’s perceived superiority of the Houyhnhnms and subsequent misanthropy as features that Swift used to employ the satirical and humorous elements characteristic of the Beast Fables of travel books that were popular with his contemporaries; as Swift did, these Beast Fables placed animals above humans in terms of morals and reason, but they were not meant to be taken literally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:22&quot; /&gt;

===Character analysis===
'''Pedro de Mendez''' is the name of the Portuguese captain who rescues Gulliver in Book IV. When Gulliver is forced to leave the Island of the [[Houyhnhnms]], his plan is &quot;to discover some small Island uninhabited&quot; where he can live in solitude. Instead, he is picked up by Don Pedro's crew. Despite Gulliver's appearance—he is dressed in skins and speaks like a horse—Don Pedro treats him compassionately and returns him to Lisbon.

Though Don Pedro appears only briefly, he has become an important figure in the debate between so-called soft school and hard school readers of ''Gulliver's Travels''. Some critics contend that Gulliver is a target of Swift's satire and that Don Pedro represents an ideal of human kindness and generosity. Gulliver believes humans are similar to Yahoos in the sense that they make &quot;no other use of reason, than to improve and multiply...vices&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gulliver's Travels|last=Swift|first=Jonathan|publisher=|year=1726|isbn=978-0-393-93065-8|location=|page=490}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Pedro provides a contrast to Gulliver's reasoning, proving humans are able to reason, be kind, and most of all: civilized. Gulliver sees the bleak fallenness at the center of human nature, and Don Pedro is merely a minor character who, in Gulliver's words, is &quot;an Animal which had some little Portion of Reason&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;James Clifford, &quot;Gulliver's Fourth Voyage: 'hard' and 'soft' Schools of Interpretation&quot;.

== Reception ==

The book was very popular upon release and was commonly discussed within social circles.&lt;ref&gt;Wiener, Gary, editor. &quot;The Enthusiastic Reception of Gulliver's Travels&quot;. ''Readings on Gulliver's Travels'', Greenhaven Press, 2000, pp. 57–65.&lt;/ref&gt; Public reception widely varied, with the book receiving an initially enthusiastic reaction with readers praising its satire, and some reporting that the satire's cleverness sounded like a realistic account of a man's travels.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;Gerace, Mary. “The Reputation of ‘Gulliver’s Travels’ in the Eighteenth Century.” ''University of Windsor'', 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Beattie (poet)|James Beattie]] commended Swift’s work for its “truth” regarding the narration and claims that “the statesman, the philosopher, and the critick, will admire his keenness of satire, energy of description, and vivacity of language,” noting that even children can enjoy the novel.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;Lund, Roger D. ''Johnathan Swift’s Gulliver's Travels: A Routledge Study Guide''. Routledge, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; As popularity increased, critics came to appreciate the deeper aspects of ''Gulliver’s Travels.'' It became known for its insightful take on morality, expanding its reputation beyond just humorous satire.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

Despite its initial positive reception, the book faced backlash. One of the first critics of the book, referred to as Lord Bolingbroke, criticized Swift for his overt use of misanthropy.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Other negative responses to the novel also looked towards its portrayal of humanity, which was considered inaccurate. Swifts’s peers rejected the novel on claims that its themes of misanthropy were harmful and offensive. They criticized its satire for exceeding what was deemed acceptable and appropriate, including the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos’s similarities to humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; There was also controversy surrounding the political allegories. Readers enjoyed the political references, finding them humorous. However, members of the Whig party were offended, believing that Swift mocked their politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

British novelist and journalist [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] described Swift's novel as &quot;blasphemous&quot;, citing its critical view of mankind as ludicrous and overly harsh. He concludes his critique by remarking that he cannot understand the origins of Swift’s critiques on humanity.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;

==Cultural influences==
{{main|Cultural influence of Gulliver's Travels}}
[[File:Pruszkowski Gulliver and a giant.jpg|thumb|upright|''Gulliver and a giant'', a painting by [[Tadeusz Pruszkowski]] ([[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]]).]]

The term ''Lilliputian'' has entered many languages as an adjective meaning &quot;small and delicate&quot;. There is a brand of small cigar called Lilliput, and a series of collectable model houses known as &quot;Lilliput Lane&quot;. The smallest light bulb fitting (5&amp;nbsp;mm diameter) in the [[Edison screw]] series is called the &quot;Lilliput Edison screw&quot;. In Dutch and Czech, the words ''Lilliputter'' and ''lilipután'', respectively, are used for adults shorter than 1.30 meters. Conversely, ''Brobdingnagian'' appears in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' as a synonym for ''very large'' or ''gigantic''.

In like vein, the term ''yahoo'' is often encountered as a [[synonym]] for ''ruffian'' or ''thug''. In the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' it is considered a definition for &quot;a rude, noisy, or violent person&quot; and its origins attributed to Swift's ''Gulliver's Travels''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/yahoo#yahoo|title=yahoo – definition of yahoo in English |work= Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the discipline of [[computer architecture]], the terms [[endianness|''big-endian'' and ''little-endian'']] are used to describe two possible ways of laying out [[byte]]s in [[computer memory|memory]]. The terms derive from one of the satirical conflicts in the book, in which two religious sects of Lilliputians are divided between those who crack open their soft-boiled eggs from the little end, the &quot;Little-endians&quot;, and those who use the big end, the &quot;Big-endians&quot;.

===In other works===
Many sequels followed the initial publishing of the ''Travels''. The earliest of these was the anonymously authored ''Memoirs of the Court of Lilliput'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZTRAAAAMAAJ|title=Memoirs of the Court of Lilliput|year=1727|publisher=J. Roberts|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; published 1727, which expands the account of Gulliver's stays in Lilliput and Blefuscu by adding several gossipy anecdotes about scandalous episodes at the Lilliputian court.  Abbé [[Pierre Desfontaines]], the first French translator of Swift's story, wrote a sequel, ''Le Nouveau Gulliver ou Voyages de Jean Gulliver, fils du capitaine Lemuel Gulliver'' (The New Gulliver, or the travels of John Gulliver, son of Captain Lemuel Gulliver), published in 1730.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w6LRAAAAMAAJ|title=Le nouveau Gulliver: ou, Voyage de Jean Gulliver, fils du capitaine Gulliver|first1=Desfontaines (Pierre-François Guyot, M.|last1=l'abbé)|first2=Jonathan|last2=Swift|year=1730|publisher=La veuve Clouzier|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gulliver's son has various fantastic, satirical adventures.

A '''levee''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɛ|v|i}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/levee|title=levee – meaning of levee in Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English |website=Ldoceonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/levee?a=british|title=levee Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=Dictionary.cambridge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''dike''', '''dyke''', '''embankment''', '''floodbank''' or '''stopbank''' is an elongated naturally occurring ridge or artificially constructed [[fill dirt|fill]] or wall that regulates water levels. It is usually [[Soil|earthen]] and often [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the course of a [[river]] in its [[floodplain]] or along low-lying coastlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Levees and Other Raised Ground | author=Henry Petroski | publisher=American Scientist | year=2006 | volume=94 | issue=1 | pages=7–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
Speakers of [[American English]] (notably in the [[Midwest]] and [[Deep South]]) use the word ''levee'', from the French word ''levée'' (from the feminine past participle of the [[French verb]] ''lever'', &quot;to raise&quot;). It originated in [[New Orleans]] a few years after the city's founding in 1718 and was later adopted by English speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|levee}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=July 2017}} The name derives from the trait of the levee's ridges being ''raised'' higher than both the channel and the surrounding floodplains.

In the [[red-figure pottery|red-figure]] period, the Triton-Herakles theme became completely outmoded, supplanted by such scenes as [[Theseus]]'s adventures in Poseidon's golden mansion, embellished with the presence of Triton.{{sfnp|Mommsen|2014|pp=55}} Again, extant literature describing the adventure omits any mention of Triton,&lt;ref&gt;[[Bacchylides]] 17, [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hygnius]] ''[[Poeticon astronomicon]]'' 2.5 , [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 1. 17.3, apud {{harvp|Mommsen|2014|pp=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; but placement of Triton in the scene is not implausible.{{sfnp|Mommsen|2014|pp=55}}

== Further genealogy ==

Triton was the father of a daughter named [[Pallas (daughter of Triton)|Pallas]] and foster parent to the goddess [[Athena]], according to Pseudo-Apollodorus's ''Bibliotheca''.{{Refn|group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;|In this story, Pallas was inadvertently killed by Athena during sparring, and the goddess subsequently took a wooden figurine of Pallas and wrapped the [[Aegis]] (goat-skin) around it, thus creating the [[Palladium (classical antiquity)|palladium]].}}&lt;ref&gt;{{URL|1=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0022:text=Library:book=3:chapter=12|2=Apollod. 3.12.6}}; or 3.144: {{cite book|translator1=Stephen M.

Athena bears the epithet ''Tritogeneia'' ({{lang|grc|Τριτογένεια}}) &quot;Triton-born&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;theogony895&quot; /&gt; and while this is suggestive of Triton's daughter being Athena,{{Refn|Connelly claims this is so in some sources.}} the appellation is otherwise explainable in several ways, e.g., as Athena's birth (from Zeus's head) taking place at the River Triton or [[Lake Tritonis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;connelly&quot; /&gt;

Triton also had a daughter named Triteia. According to Pausanias writing in the 2nd century CE, one origin story of the city of Triteia held that this was an [[eponym]]ous  city after Triteia, founded by her and [[Ares]]'s son, named [[Melanippus]] (&quot;Black Horse&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-eng1:7.22.8 |author=Pausanias |translator-last=Jones |translator-first=William Henry Samuel |translator-link=William Henry Samuel Jones |title=Description of Greece VII 22.8 |publisher=Harvard University Press |website=Perseus.tufts.edu |series=Loeb Classical Library |access-date=2019-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tritons ==
At some time during the Greco-Roman period, &quot;Tritons&quot;, in the plural, came to be used a generic term for [[merman|mermen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot; /&gt;

=== Hellenistic and Roman art ===

[[File:Clevelandart 1985.184.jpg|thumb|left|upright=2.0|Tritoness bronze applique, Greek, 2nd century BCE, Cleveland Museum of Art]]

[[Greek pottery]] depicting a half-human, half-fish being bearing an inscription of &quot;Triton&quot; is popular by the 6th century BC.{{sfnp|Lattimore|1976|p=56}} It has also been hypothesized that by this time &quot;Triton&quot; has become a generic term for a merman.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lattimore|1976|p=56}}: &quot;By the sixth century, to judge from inscriptions on vases, &quot;Triton&quot; was the most popular designation for the merman&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;|As aforementioned, &quot;Triton&quot; is the most common label, but &quot;[[Nereus]]&quot;, and &quot;Old Man of the Sea&quot; are found as inscriptions in six century pottery depicting the motif of Herakles wrestling a sea-monster.&lt;ref name=&quot;pedley&quot; /&gt;}}

In later Greek periods into the Roman period, Tritons were depicted as [[ichthyocentaurs]], i.e., merman with a horse's forelegs in place of arms. The earliest known examples are from the 2nd century B.C.{{efn|Among the relief groups in the [[Pergamon Altar]].}}&lt;ref&gt;Rumpf, Andreas (1939) ''Die Meerwesen'', {{URL|1=https://books.google.com/books?&amp;id=NhNGAQAAIAAJ|2=Reprint (1969)}}, p. 105 and note 140, ''apud'' {{harvp|Lattimore|1976|p=44}}, note 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;Ichthyocentaur&quot; did not originate in Ancient Greece, and only appeared in writing in the [[Byzantine period]] (12th century); &quot;Centaur-Triton&quot; is another word for a Triton with horse-legs.&lt;ref name=&quot;dgrbm-triton1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;packard&quot; /&gt;

Besides examples in which the horse-like forelimbs have been replaced by wings,&lt;ref name=&quot;packard&quot; /&gt; there are other examples where the forelegs have several clawed digits (somewhat like lions), as in one relief at the [[Glyptothek]] in Munich, Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;roscher&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;overbeck&quot; /&gt; A Triton with a lower extremity like a lobster or crayfish, in a fresco unearthed from [[Herculanum]] has been mentioned.&lt;ref name=&quot;clarac&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;froehner&quot; /&gt;

Double-tailed tritons began to be depicted by the late 2nd century BC, such as in the [[Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus]]. [[Andreas Rumpf|Rumpf]] thought that might be the earliest example of a &quot;Triton with two fish-tails (Triton mit zwei Fischschwänzen)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rumpf, Andreas (1939) ''Die Meerwesen'', {{URL|1=https://books.google.com/books?&amp;id=NhNGAQAAIAAJ|2=Reprint (1969)}}, p. 105 (?) ''apud'' {{harvp|Lattimore|1976|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the double-tailed tritonesses in [[Damophon]]'s sculptures at [[Lycosura]] predates it, and even this is doubted to be the first example.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Picard|Picard, Charles]] (1948), ''{{URL|1=https://books.google.com/books?id=LXftAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Damophon+tritonesses |2=Manuel d'archéologie grecque: sculpture}}'', p. 684 ''apud'' {{harvp|Lattimore|1976|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lattimore believed the two-tailed triton should be dated to the 4th century BC, and speculated that Skopas was the one to devise it.{{sfnp|Lattimore|1976|pp=60–61}}{{Refn|Skopa's sculpture is long lost. Cf. A. F. Stewart's remark that hypotheses on a lost work causes Lattimore to adopt an equivocal (&quot;might-have-beens&quot;), though Lattimore is uniquely resolute on the &quot;conclusion [that] the double-tailed Triton was probably Skopas's creation (p. 61)&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;stewart&quot; /&gt;}}

As aforementioned, there is the female version of the half-human, half-fishlike being, sometimes called a &quot;tritoness&quot;{{sfnp|Lattimore|1976|p=61}} or a &quot;female triton&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;lawrence&quot; /&gt;

=== Literature in the Roman period ===
The first literary attestation of Tritons ({{lang-la|Tritonēs}}) in the plural was Virgil's ''[[Aeneid]]'' (c. 29–19 BC).&lt;ref name=&quot;robinson&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0690.phi003.perseus-eng1:5.799-5.826 |author=P. Vergilius Maro |translator=John Dryden |title=Aeneid V. 824 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1st century CE, another Latin poet [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]] wrote in ''Argonautica'' that there was a huge Triton at each side of Neptune's chariot, holding the reins of horses.&lt;ref name=&quot;valerius-argonautica-1.679&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kleywegt&quot; /&gt; And [[Statius]] (1st century) makes a Triton [[figurehead]] adorn the prow of the ''[[Argo]]''.{{Refn|''Thebaid'' 5.371f.{{sfnp|Kleywegt|2005|p=175}}}}

Trions and nereids appear as marine retinues ({{lang-la|{{linktext|marinum |obsequium}}}}) to the goddess Venus in [[Apuleius]]'s ''Metamorphoses'', or &quot;[[The Golden Ass]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;kenney-apuleius&quot; /&gt;

=== Pausanias ===
Tritons ({{lang-gr|Τρίτωνες}}, ''Tritones'') were described in detail in the 2nd century CE by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (ix. 21).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-eng1:9.21.1 |author=Pausanias |translator=William Henry Samuel Jones |translator-link=William Henry Samuel Jones |title=Description of Greece IV, 9.21.2 |publisher=Harvard University Press |website=Perseus.tufts.edu |series=Loeb Classical Library |access-date=2019-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dgrbm-triton1&quot;&gt;{{Cite DGRBM|author=|title=Triton (1)|volume=|page=|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104%3Aentry%3Dtriton-bio-1|short=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &quot;The Tritons have the following appearance. On their heads they grow hair like that of marsh frogs ({{lang-grc-gre|βατράχιον}}, plants of the ''[[Ranunculus]]'' genus{{Refn|group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;|Translated as &quot;parsley which grows in marshes&quot; by Taylor.&lt;ref name=&quot;taylor&quot; /&gt;}}) not only in color, but in the impossibility of separating one hair from another. The rest of their body is rough with fine scales just as is the shark. Under their ears they have gills and a man's nose; but the mouth is broader and the teeth are those of a beast. Their eyes seem to me blue,{{Efn|{{lang-grc-gre|γλαυκός}}. Defined &quot;freq. of the eye, ''light blue, grey''&quot;, in [[LSJ|Liddle-Scott-Jones]], &quot;{{url|1=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dglauko%2Fs1|2=γλαυκός}}&quot;.}} and they have hands, fingers, and nails like the shells of the murex. Under the breast and belly is a tail like a dolphin's instead of feet.&quot;

Pausanias was basing his descriptions on a headless Triton exhibited in [[Tanagra]] and another curiosity in Rome. These Tritons were preserved mummies or taxidermied real animals or humans (or fabrication made to appear as such).{{sfnp|Mayor|2011|p=232}}&lt;ref name=&quot;frazer&quot; /&gt; The Tanagran Triton was seen by [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]]{{Refn|Aelian, ''De Natura Animalium'', xiii, 21, apud Frazer&lt;ref name=&quot;frazer&quot; /&gt;}} who described it as an embalmed or pickled mummy ({{lang-grc-gre|{{linktext|τάριχος}}}}). While Pausanias related a legend around the Tanagran Triton that its head was cut off, [[James George Frazer|J. G. Frazer]] conjectured that such a {{linktext|cover story}} had to be invented after a sea mammal's carcass with a severed or severely mutilated head was passed off as a Triton.&lt;ref name=&quot;frazer&quot; /&gt;{{Refn|group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;|Tritons were the aquatic versions of [[Satyrs]] and Centaur &quot;relicts&quot;, i.e., creatures purported to exist and exhibited in Greek and Roman times.{{sfnp|Mayor|2011|p=236}}}}

== Renaissance Period  ==
[[File:Tritonbrunnen rom.JPG|thumb|upright|right|[[Fontana del Tritone|The Triton Fountain]] (1642–3), by [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]], [[Rome]]]]

Triton was referred to as &quot;trumpeter of Neptune (''Neptuni tubicen'')&quot; in [[Cristoforo Landino]] (d. 1498)'s commentary on Virgil;&lt;ref name=&quot;landino&quot; /&gt; this phrasing later appeared in the gloss for &quot;Triton&quot; in [[Marius Nizolius]]'s ''Thesaurus'' (1551),&lt;ref name=&quot;nizolius&quot; /&gt; and [[Konrad Gesner]]'s book (1558).&lt;ref name=&quot;gesner&quot; /&gt;

Triton makes appearance in [[English literature]] as the messenger for the god Poseidon.&lt;ref name=&quot;norton&quot; /&gt; In [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[Faerie Queene]]'', Triton blew &quot;his trompet shrill before&quot; Neptune and Amphitrite.&lt;ref name=&quot;norton&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;spenser&quot; /&gt; And in [[John Milton|Milton]] (1637), &quot;[[Lycidas]]&quot;  v. 89, &quot;The Herald of the Sea&quot; refers to Triton.&lt;ref name=&quot;milton-lycidas-ed-revard&quot; /&gt;

[[Gianlorenzo Bernini]] sculpted the &quot;[[Neptune and Triton]]&quot; fountain (1622–23) now in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]&lt;ref name=&quot;barrow&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wilkins&quot; /&gt; and the  [[Fontana del Tritone|Triton Fountain]] (1642–43) in Bernini Square, Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;dickerson&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wilkins|2000|p=406}}, n84&lt;/ref&gt; There is differing opinion on what earlier works he may have drawn from near-contemporary works or examples from antiquity. He may have been influenced by Battista di Domenico Lorenzi's ''Alpheus and Arethusa'' (1568–70) or his Triton blowing the conch (late 1570s),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wilkins|2000}}, p. 390 and n24; p. 405, n 82.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Stoldo Lorenzi]]'s Neptune fountain.&lt;ref name=&quot;wittkower&quot; /&gt; But [[Rudolf Wittkower]] has cautioned against exaggerating the influences of Florentine fountains.&lt;ref name=&quot;wittkower&quot; /&gt; It has been pointed out that Bernini had access to the Papal collection{{Refn|group=lower-alpha|As a favorite of [[Paul V]] (d. 1621).{{sfnp|Barrow|2018|p=165}} [[Urban VIII]] (elected 1623) became his great patron.{{sfnp|Wilkins|2000|p=393}}}} of genuine Greco-Roman sculptures, and worked with restoring ancient fragments,{{sfnp|Barrow|2018|pp=165–166}} although it is unclear if any Triton was among these. It is within the realm of possibilities that Bernini might have used as his model the ancient [[Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus]], which does include Triton in its composition.{{sfnp|Barrow|2018|pp=174–175}} The Triton of this altar, the Stoldo Lorenzi Triton and the Bernini Triton are all double-tailed, like a pair of human legs.{{sfnp|Barrow|2018|p=175}}

== Victorian Age ==
[[File:Viktor Tilgner-Triton und Nymphe-Volksgarten.jpg|thumb|''Triton and Nymphe'' fountain by [[Viktor Tilgner]] in the [[Volksgarten (Vienna)]]]]

In [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]]'s sonnet &quot;[[The World Is Too Much with Us]]&quot; (c. 1802, published 1807), the poet regrets the prosaic humdrum modern world, yearning for

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em&quot;&gt;glimpses that would make me less forlorn;
Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;
Or hear old Triton blow his wreathèd horn.&lt;/poem&gt;

== In popular culture ==
Triton appears in the 1963 film ''[[Jason_and_the_Argonauts_(1963_film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]''. When the Argo is threatened with destruction by the clashing rocks, Triton emerges from the water to hold the sides of the narrow passage apart so that the Argo can pass through safely.

[[King Triton]] is a character depicted in the Disney's ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', inspired by Triton, as an undersea king, the father of the title character.  In ''The Little Mermaid'', Triton has seven daughters for the [[Seven Seas]],{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} the youngest named [[Ariel (Disney character)|Ariel]], of whom he is very overprotective. However, [[King Triton|this character]] (and all the other ones in the Disney movie) is actually based on [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s fairy tale of the same name.

==Mascot ==
There are numerous universities, colleges, and [[High school (North America)|high school]]s that use Triton as their mascot. These include the following:
* [[University of California, San Diego]], [[La Jolla, California]]
* [[Eckerd College]], [[St. Petersburg, Florida]]
* [[Edmonds College]], [[Lynnwood, Washington]]
* [[Iowa Central Community College]], [[Fort Dodge, Iowa]]
* [[Mariner High School (Cape Coral, Florida)|Mariner High School]], [[Cape Coral, Florida]]
* [[Notre Dame Academy (Green Bay, Wisconsin)|Notre Dame Academy]], [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]
* [[San Clemente High School (San Clemente, California)]]
* [[University of Guam]], [[Mangilao, Guam]]
* [[University of Missouri–St. Louis]]
* [[University of Rennes 1]], [[Brittany]] [[France]]
Many club sports teams, especially swimming leagues, use the symbol of Triton.

== Eponyms ==
The largest moon of the planet [[Neptune]] has been given the name [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], as Neptune is the Roman equivalent of Poseidon. A family of large sea snails, the shells of some of which have been used as trumpets since antiquity, are commonly known as &quot;tritons&quot;, see [[Triton (gastropod)]].

The name Triton is associated in modern industry with tough hard-wearing machines such as the [[Ford Triton engine]] and [[Mitsubishi Triton]] pickup truck.

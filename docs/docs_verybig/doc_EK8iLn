&lt;!-- The following map actually shows the climates of the C group in the Köppen–Geiger scheme, which comprises maritime-influenced climates that are to a large part rather subtropical than temperate in the usual sense (or, as in Florida and parts of Africa, even tropical), and fails to include all continental climates, may have belong to the temperate zones, so it got stuffed up as well as subarctic climates, which are usually included in the temperate climate zones as well, as &quot;cool-temperate&quot; or &quot;cold-temperate&quot;.

{{Weather}}

In [[geography]], the '''temperate''' or '''tepid climates''' of [[Earth]] occur in the [[middle latitudes]], which span between the [[tropics]] and the [[polar regions of Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/weatherandclimatechange/climate/worldclimates/temperate.asp |title=Weather &amp; Climate Change: Climates around the world |publisher=[[Education Scotland]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414115206/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/weatherandclimatechange/climate/worldclimates/temperate.asp |archivedate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most climate classifications, temperate climates refer to the climate zone between 35° and 50° north and south latitudes (between the [[subarctic]] and [[subtropics|subtropical]] climates).

These zones generally have wider [[temperature]] ranges throughout the year and more distinct [[season]]al changes compared to [[tropical climate]]s, where such variations are often small.

The '''temperate zones''' (latitudes from 23.5° to the [[polar circle]]s at about 66.5°, [[Arctic Circle|north]] and [[Antarctic Circle|south]]) are where the widest seasonal changes occur, with most climates found in it having some influence from both the tropics and the [[geographical pole|poles]]. The [[subtropics]] (latitudes from about 23.5° to 35°, [[Tropic of Cancer|north]] and [[Tropic of Capricorn|south]]) have temperate climates that have the least seasonal change and the warmest in winter, while at the other end, [[subarctic climate]]s located from 55 to 65 north latitude have the most seasonal changes and long and severe winters.

In temperate climates, not only do latitudinal positions influence temperature changes, but sea currents, prevailing wind direction, continentality (how large a landmass is), and altitude also shape temperate climates.

The [[Köppen climate classification]] defines a climate as &quot;temperate&quot; when the mean temperature is above {{convert|-3|C|F|1}} but below {{convert|18|C|F|1}} in the coldest month. However, other climate classifications set the minimum at {{convert|0|C|F|1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://enviroliteracy.org/air-climate-weather/climate/latitude-climate-zones/ |title=Latitude &amp; Climate Zones |website=The Environmental Literacy Council |accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weather-climate.org.uk/13.php |title=Patterns of Climate |website=Weather-climate.org.uk |accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Zones and climates ==
The '''north temperate zone''' extends from (approximately 23.5° north) to the [[Arctic Circle]] (approximately 66.5° north latitude). The '''south temperate zone''' extends from (approximately 23.5° south) to the [[Antarctic Circle]] (approximately 66.5° south).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of World Geography, Volume 1 |location=New York |publisher=Facts on File |series=Facts on File Library of World Geography |last=McColltoll |first=R. W. |page=919 |date=2005 |isbn=0-816-05786-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/earth-and-environment/atmosphere-and-weather/atmospheric-and-space-sciences-atmosphere/daylight |title=Solar Illumination: Seasonal and Diurnal Patterns |website=Encyclopedia.com |access-date=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''In some climate classifications'', the temperate zone is often divided into several smaller climate zones, based on monthly temperatures, the coldest month, and rainfall. These include [[humid subtropical climate]], [[Mediterranean climate]], [[oceanic climate|oceanic]], and [[continental climate]].

=== Subtropics ===
These are the climates that are typically found toward the more equatorial portion of the temperate zone between 23.5° and 35° north or south, and thus are far more influenced by the tropics than any other temperate climate type, usually having warmer temperatures over the year, longer summers and mild, short winters. Freezing precipitation is uncommon in this portion of the temperate zone.

On the winter solstice within this range of latitude, the sun still rises to an altitude of between 31.5 and 43 degrees above the horizon respectively thus contributing to the warmer winters however it does not quite reach the zenith (directly overhead) on the summer solstice hence the definition of being within the temperate zone.

==== Humid subtropical (Cfa) and monsoon subtropical (Cwa)====
[[File:Koppen World Map Cwa Cfa.png|thumb|255x255px|Regions where the humid (Cfa) and dry-winter subtropical (Cwa) climates are found.]]
[[Humid subtropical climate]]s generally have long, hot and humid summers with convective showers in summer and a peak seasonal rainfall in the hottest months. Winters are normally mild in the humid subtropics, and warm ocean currents normally are found in coastal areas with humid subtropical climates. This type of climate is normally located along leeward lower east coasts of continents such as in southeast and central [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]] and south of [[Brazil]], the southeast portions of [[East Asia]], the [[southern United States]], [[South Africa]], and eastern [[Australia]]. In some areas with a humid subtropical climate (most notably southeast [[China]] and [[North India]]), there is an even sharper wet-dry season, called subtropical monsoon or Cwa. In these regions, winters are quite dry and summers have very heavy rainfall. Some Cwa areas in southern China reported more than 80% of annual precipitation in the 5 warmest months (southwest monsoon).

==== Mediterranean (Csa, Csb) ====
[[File:Koppen World Map C.png|thumb|260x260px|Regions where the dry-summer subtropical or Mediterranean climates (Csa, Csb) are found.]]
[[Mediterranean climate]]s, opposite to the humid subtropical and monsoonal climates, have a dry summer, with rainfall in the winter and cooler months. They occur mostly at the western edges and coasts of the continents and are bounded by arid deserts on their equatorward sides that cause the dry season of summer, and oceanic climates to the poleward sides that are influenced by cool ocean currents and air masses that bring the rainfall of winter. The five main Mediterranean regions of the world are the [[Mediterranean Basin]] in northwestern [[Afro-Eurasia]], coastal [[California]] in the [[United States]], the southwest of [[Australia]], the [[Western Cape]] of [[South Africa]] and the south and southwestern coast of Chile.

==== Subtropical highland (Cfb, Cwb) ====

[[File:Koppen World Map Cfb Cfc Cwb Cwc.png|thumb|260x260px|Regions where oceanic climates (Cfb, Cfc, Cwb, Cwc) are found.]]

These are variants of the subtropical climates found in high altitude plateaus or montane systems either in the tropics or subtropics, they have characteristically mild temperatures year-round, featuring the four seasons in the subtropics and no marked seasons in the tropics, the latter usually remaining mild to cool through most of the year.

=== Middle latitudes ===
These climates occur in the middle latitudes, between approximately 23.5° and 66.5° north, and 23° and 66.5° south, and are the ones with the most equal influence from the equator and the poles, and the most prototypical temperate climates with the typical distinct four-season pattern. In these the temperatures remain relatively cool through most of the year, as opposed to mild and warm in the subtropics and cold in the subpolar zone.

==== Oceanic (Cfb) ====
The [[oceanic climate]]s are created by the onshore flow from the cool high latitude oceans to their west. This causes the climate to have cool summers and cool (but not cold) winters, and relative humidity and precipitation evenly distributed along the year. These climates are frequently cloudy, and are fairly milder both in winter and summer in comparison to other temperate climates. Annual rainfall is spread throughout the entire year. Regions with this climate include [[Northwestern Europe]], [[Pacific Northwest|Northwestern North America]], southeastern and southwestern [[South America]], southeastern [[Australia]] and most of [[New Zealand]].

=== Subpolar zone ===
These are temperate climates that compared to the subtropics are on the poleward edge of the temperate zone. Therefore, they still have four marked seasons including a warmer one, but are far more influenced by the polar zones than any other but the very polar climates ([[tundra]] and [[ice cap climate]]).

==== Subpolar oceanic (Cfc, Cwc, Csc) ====
Areas with subpolar oceanic climates feature an oceanic climate but are usually located closer to polar regions. As a result of their location, these regions tend to be on the cool end of oceanic climates. Snowfall tends to be more common here than in other oceanic climates. Subpolar oceanic climates are less prone to temperature extremes than [[subarctic climate]]s or [[continental climate]]s, featuring milder winters than these climates. This variant of an oceanic climate is found in parts of coastal [[Iceland]], the [[Faroe Islands]], parts of [[Scotland]], northwestern coastal areas of [[Norway]] such as [[Lofoten]] and reaching to 70° north on some islands, uplands near the coast of southwestern Norway, the [[Aleutian Islands]] of [[Alaska]] and northern parts of the [[Alaskan Panhandle]], some parts of Southern [[Argentina]] and Chile (though most regions are still classified as continental subantarctic), and a few highland areas of [[Tasmania]], and the [[Australian Alps|Australian]] and [[Southern Alps (New Zealand)|Southern Alps]]. This type of climate is even found in the very remote parts of the Papuan Highlands in Indonesia. The classification used for this regime is Cfc. In the most marine of those areas affected by this regime, temperatures above 20&amp;nbsp;°C (68&amp;nbsp;°F) are extreme weather events, even in the midst of summer. Temperatures above 30&amp;nbsp;°C (86&amp;nbsp;°F) have been recorded on rare occasions in some areas of this climate, and in winter temperatures down to −20&amp;nbsp;°C (−4&amp;nbsp;°F) have seldom been recorded in some areas.

== Human aspects ==

=== Demography, fauna and flora ===
The vast majority of the world's human population resides in temperate zones, especially in the [[northern hemisphere]], due to its greater mass of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hypsographic demography: The distribution of human population by altitude |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |first1=Joel E. |last1=Cohen |first2=Christopher |last2=Small |volume=95 |issue=24 |pages=14009–14014 |date=24 November 1998 |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.24.14009 |pmid=9826643 |pmc=24316|bibcode=1998PNAS...9514009C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest described number in temperate region in the world is found in [[southern Africa]], where some 24,000 taxa (species and infraspecific taxa) have been described, but the native fauna and flora of this region does not have much cultural importance for the majority of the human population of the world that lives in Temperate Zones and that live in the Northern Hemisphere, only environmental importance.&lt;ref name=ger&gt;{{cite book |url=http://planet.botany.uwc.ac.za/NISL/Biodiversity/Attachments/Plants%20of%20SA.pdf |title=Plants of Southern Africa: An Annotated Checklist |publisher=National Botanical Institute |location=Pretoria |series=Strelitzia |editor1-first=Gerrit |editor1-last=Germishuizen |editor2-first=N. L. |editor2-last=Meyer |volume=14 |date=January 2003 |isbn=978-1-919795-99-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agriculture ===
Farming is a large-scale practice in the temperate regions (except for boreal/subarctic regions) due to the plentiful rainfall and warm summers, because most agricultural activity occurs in the spring and summer, cold winters have a small effect on agricultural production. Extreme winters or summers have a huge impact on the productivity of agriculture.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Climate Revealed |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |first=William James |last=Burroughs |page=114 |date=1999 |isbn=978-0-521-77081-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urbanization ===
Temperate regions have the majority of the world's population, which leads to large cities. There are a couple factors why the climate of large city landscapes differs from the climate of rural areas. One factor is the strength of the absorption rate of builds and asphalt, which is higher than natural land. The other large factor is the burning of fossil fuels from buildings and vehicles. These factors have led to the average climate of cities to be warmer than surrounding areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

== Misconceptions ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2020}}
&quot;Temperate Climate&quot; refers to climates between Polar and Tropical. However, there is a gradual change from polar to tropical climates across the middle latitude temperate zones. Normally, in the northern hemisphere, the northern portions of the temperate zone feature [[Boreal climate|Boreal]], [[Continental climate|Continental]], and [[Oceanic climate]]s, while the southern portions of the temperate zone are often [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] and [[humid subtropical climate]]s. These different climates all fall within the temperate zone which has a basic definition as being any climate with a mean temperature above {{convert|-3|C|F|1}} but below {{convert|18|C|F|1}} in the coldest month. Obviously winter temperatures will be more mild in southerly portions and colder in the more northerly portions of the northern temperate zone and vice versa in the southern temperate zone.

From a floristic standpoint, each of these climate zones have generally temperate vegetation. There is however, an obvious change in flora from the far northern portions of the temperate zone (Boreal) to the far southern portion (humid subtropical). Pines and conifers are endemic and more abundant in the northern portion of the temperate, while palms may be endemic to far southern portions of the temperate zone. Along with this, the humid subtropical climate may be wrongly separated from the Temperate group of climates, and further associated with the Tropical climates, much because of its name, temperatures and the vegetation found in Subtropical zones which can be somewhat similar to that of Tropical regions (For instance the [[Atlantic Forest]] of [[Brazil]] is spread across both Temperate and Tropical zones of the country). Additionally, both temperate and tropical species can be found side by side in the far southern portions of the temperate zone (for example in central Florida), while subarctic species might be found growing in northern portions of the continental zone (for example in Northwest Europe).

'''Adam Wiśniewski-Snerg''' (January 1, 1937 - August 30, 1995) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[science fiction author]]. He was born in [[Płock]], Poland.

Although unpopular during his life, after his suicide he became recognized as one of the most significant authors of Polish SF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ksiazki.wp.pl/adam-wisniewski-snerg-6150147474081921c|title=Adam Wiśniewski-Snerg|last=S.A|first=Wirtualna Polska Media|date=2010-04-14|website=ksiazki.wp.pl|language=pl|access-date=2019-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the prototype of Sneer, the main character of ''[[Limes inferior]]'', one of the novels by [[Janusz A. Zajdel]].

'''Celje''' ({{IPA-sl|ˈtsɛ̀ːljɛ|pron|Sl-Celje.oga}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bos.zrc-sazu.si/c/SP/neva.exe?name=sp&amp;expression=Celje&amp;hs=1|title=Celje|work=Slovenski pravopis 2001|language=sl}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[list of cities and towns in Slovenia|third-largest]] city in [[Slovenia]]. It is a regional center of the traditional Slovenian region of [[Styria (Slovenia)|Styria]] and the administrative seat of the [[City Municipality of Celje]] ({{lang-sl|Mestna občina Celje}}). The town of Celje is located below [[Celje Castle|Upper Celje Castle]] ({{convert|407|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}) at the [[confluence]] of the [[Savinja]], [[Hudinja (river)|Hudinja]], [[Ložnica]], and [[Voglajna]] rivers in the lower [[Savinja Valley]], and at the crossing of the roads connecting [[Ljubljana]], [[Maribor]], [[Velenje]], and the [[Central Sava Valley]]. It lies {{convert|238|m|abbr=on}} above [[mean sea level]] (MSL).&lt;ref name=STAT2002 /&gt;

==Name==
Celje was known as ''Celeia'' during the [[Roman Empire|Roman period]]. Early attestations of the name during or following Slavic settlement include ''Cylia'' in 452, ''ecclesiae Celejanae'' in 579, ''Zellia'' in 824, ''in Cilia'' in 1310, ''Cilli'' in 1311, and ''Celee'' in 1575. The proto-Slovene name ''*Ceľe'' or ''*Celьje'', from which modern Slovene ''Celje'' developed, was borrowed from [[Vulgar Latin]] ''Celeae''. The name is of pre-Roman origin and its further etymology is unclear.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snoj&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Snoj |first1=Marko |title=Etimološki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen |date=2009 |publisher=Modrijan |location=Ljubljana |page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the local [[Slovene language|Slovene]] dialect, Celje is called ''Cjele'' or ''Cele''. In [[German language|German]] it is called ''Cilli'', and it is known in [[Italian language|Italian]] as ''Cilli'' or ''Celie''.

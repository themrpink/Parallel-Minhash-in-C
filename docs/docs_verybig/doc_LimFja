In 1990, he starred in ''[[The Old Man and the Sea (1990 film)|The Old Man and the Sea]]'', a television movie based on the novel by [[Ernest Hemingway]]. Quinn's film career slowed during the 1990s, but he nonetheless continued to work steadily, appearing in ''[[Revenge (1990 film)|Revenge]]'' (1990), ''[[Jungle Fever]]'' (1991), ''[[Last Action Hero]]'' (1993), ''[[A Walk in the Clouds]]'' (1995) and ''[[Seven Servants]]'' (1996).&lt;ref name=&quot;IMDb name|63&quot;/&gt;

In 1994, Quinn played the role of Zeus in five television movies focusing on the legendary journeys of Hercules. These were, in order, ''[[Hercules and the Amazon Women]]'', ''[[Hercules and the Lost Kingdom]]'', ''[[Hercules and the Circle of Fire]]'', ''[[Hercules in the Underworld]]'', and ''[[Hercules in the Maze of the Minotaur]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;IMDb name|63&quot;/&gt;

== Mafia ==

Quinn made an appearance at the [[John Gotti]] trial, according to John H. Davis, author of ''Mafia Dynasty: The Rise and Fall of the Gambino Crime Family''. He told reporters he wanted to play [[Paul Castellano]], the boss of the Gambino family after [[Carlo Gambino]]. Gotti had Castellano murdered, becoming the boss of the Gambino family thereafter. Gotti was on trial concerning a variety of felony charges when Quinn visited the courtroom.

Although he tried to shake hands with Gotti, federal marshals prevented him from doing so, Davis says. The actor interpreted the testimony of [[Sammy Gravano|Sammy (&quot;The Bull&quot;) Gravano]], Gotti's [[underboss]], against Gotti as &quot;a friend who betrays a friend.&quot; He had not come to &quot;judge&quot; Gotti, Quinn insisted, but only because he wanted to portray Castellano, who inspired the actor because he had had a &quot;thirty-year-old&quot; mistress, which Quinn believed was &quot;a beautiful thing&quot;. He would later portray Gambino family underboss [[Aniello Dellacroce]] in the 1996 HBO film ''[[Gotti (1996 film)|Gotti]]'' as well as [[Joe Masseria]] in the 1991 film ''[[Mobsters (film)|Mobsters]]''.

Quinn was nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance as Dellacroce.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Quinn had a personal relationship with New York City Mafia crime boss [[Frank Costello]] and other [[Genovese crime family|Genovese]] gangsters.&lt;ref name=TedStrong-AQ /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Transcript: [http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0106/04/lkl.00.html &quot;Remembering Anthony Quinn&quot;], ''[[Larry King Live]]'', June 4, 2001; accessed May 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting and writing==
Art critic Donald Kuspit explains, &quot;Examining Quinn's many expressions of creativity together—his art, collecting, and acting—we can see that he was a creative genius&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthonyquinn.net/h04/04_03.html Exhibitions: Feedback] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511194025/http://www.anthonyquinn.net/h04/04_03.html |date=May 11, 2008}}, AnthonyQuinn.net; accessed March 30, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in life Quinn had an interest in painting and drawing. Throughout his teenage years he won various art competitions in California and focused his studies at Polytechnic High School in Los Angeles on drafting. Later, Quinn studied briefly under [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] through the Taliesin Fellowship — an opportunity created by winning first prize in an architectural design contest. Through Wright's recommendation, Quinn took acting lessons as a form of post-operative speech therapy, which led to an acting career that spanned over six decades.{{sfn|Marill|1975|page=15}}

Apart from art classes taken in Chicago during the 1950s, Quinn never attended art school; nonetheless, taking advantage of books, museums, and amassing a sizable collection, he managed to give himself an effective education in the language of modern art. By the early 1980s, his work had caught the eyes of various gallery owners and was exhibited internationally, in Mexico City, Los Angeles, New York City and Paris. His work is now represented in both public and private collections throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.artencounter.com/product/glance-mirror-anthony-quinn/| title=A Glance In The Mirror by Anthony Quinn| website=Art encounter| access-date=November 12, 2018| language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote two memoirs, ''[[The Original Sin (book)|The Original Sin]]'' (1972) and ''One Man Tango'' (1997), a number of scripts, and a series of unpublished stories currently in the collection of his archive.

==Civil rights activism==
Quinn, who experienced discrimination growing up in Los Angeles, participated in various civil rights and social causes. He provided funding for the Latino advocacy group, the [[Spanish-Speaking People's Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://sites.google.com/a/apps.edina.k12.mn.us/history-day-josefina-fierro-de-bright/adult-life-of-josefina-fierro-de-bright| title=Josefina's beginnings of activist - History Day: Josefina Fierro de Bright| website=Edina Public Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt; He assisted in fundraising efforts for the legal defense of Mexican American youth in the racially charged [[Sleepy Lagoon murder]] trial in 1942. While in Paris, he and several other prominent Americans, composed a petition endorsing the 1963 [[March on Washington]]. The petition, which was reprinted in several high-profile publications, was intended to rally support among Americans living abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=https://www.counterpunch.org/2018/07/03/a-baldwinites-regret/| title=A Baldwinite's Regret| first=Elliott| last=Miller| date=July 3, 2018| journal=[[CounterPunch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, he visited with Native American student activists [[Occupation of Alcatraz|occupying Alcatraz Island]] in protest, promising to offer assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Occupation-Of-Alcatraz-30-year-anniversary-of-2895929.php| title=Occupation Of Alcatraz / 30-year anniversary of Indian coup| first1=Peter| last1=Fimrite| date=November 19, 1999| newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, Quinn was a panelist at the Mexican-American Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c8251nj8/entire_text/| title=Anthony Quinn Collection of Scripts| website=Online Archives of California}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, he narrated a documentary film by the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] discussing job discrimination faced by Hispanic Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/history/35th/1965-71/educating.html| title=Educating the Public about Employment Discrimination| website=www.eeoc.gov| access-date=April 18, 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504053832/https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/history/35th/1965-71/educating.html| archive-date=May 4, 2017| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a supporter of the [[United Farm Workers]] organization led by his friend and labor activist [[Cesar Chavez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-may-26-mn-34230-story.html| title=UFW Toils in a New Field: Cities| date=May 26, 2000| newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]| first=Dana| last=Calvo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[Image:Anthony Quinn Cannes.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Anthony Quinn with his second wife, Jolanda Addolori]]
Quinn's first wife was the actress [[Katherine DeMille]], the adopted daughter of [[Cecil B. DeMille]]; they wed in 1937. The couple had five children: Christopher (1938&amp;ndash;1941), Christina (born December 1, 1941), Catalina (born November 21, 1942), Duncan (born August 4, 1945), and Valentina (born December 26, 1952).&lt;ref name=q&gt;[http://www.anthonyquinn.com/h09/Quinn_Chronology.pdf &quot;Chronology of Anthony Quinn and Related World Events&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528232019/http://www.anthonyquinn.com/h09/Quinn_Chronology.pdf |date=May 28, 2008}} AnthonyQuinn.com; accessed March 30, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Their first child, Christopher, aged two, drowned in the lily pond of next-door neighbor [[W. C. Fields]].&lt;ref name=q/&gt;

In 1965, Quinn and DeMille divorced because of his affair with Italian costume designer Jolanda Addolori, whom he married in 1966. They had three children: [[Francesco Quinn]] (March 22, 1963 – August 5, 2011), [[Danny Quinn]] (born April 16, 1964), and [[Lorenzo Quinn]] (born May 7, 1966).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;/&gt;

In the 1970s, during his marriage to Addolori, Quinn also had two children with Friedel Dunbar, an event producer in Los Angeles: Sean Quinn (born February 7, 1973) and Alexander Anthony Quinn (born December 30, 1976).

By the 1990s, Quinn then had two children with his secretary, Katherine Benvin; daughter Antonia Patricia Rose Quinn (born July 23, 1993) and son Ryan Nicholas Quinn (born July 5, 1996).&lt;ref name=TedStrong-AQ&gt;[http://www.tedstrong.com/anthonyquinn.html Profile of Anthony Quinn] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403070621/http://www.tedstrong.com/anthonyquinn.html |date=April 3, 2008}}, TedStrong.com; accessed March 30, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.mlive.com/saginawnews/business/index.ssf/2008/05/midmichigan_hispanic_business.html| title=Mid-Michigan Hispanic Business Association hosts art reception honoring the late Anthony Quinn| date=May 6, 2008| last=McFarland| first=Jodi| newspaper=[[The Saginaw News]]| accessdate=August 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His marriage with Addolori finally ended in divorce in August 1997. He then married Benvin in December 1997 and remained married until his death, in June 2001.

==Death==
Quinn spent his last years in [[Bristol, Rhode Island]]. He died of [[respiratory failure]], [[pneumonia]] and [[throat cancer]] on June 3, 2001, in [[Boston]], at age 86.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytobit&quot;/&gt;

His funeral was held in the [[First Baptist Church in America]] in [[College Hill, Providence, Rhode Island]]. Late in life, he had rejoined the [[International Church of the Foursquare Gospel|Foursquare]] evangelical Christian community. He is buried in a family plot in [[Bristol, Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Bristol OKs Quinn's burial on own property| url=https://www.southcoasttoday.com/article/20010609/news/306099984| last=Forlitti| first=Amy| date=January 12, 2011| newspaper=[[The Standard-Times (New Bedford)|South Coast Today]]| accessdate=July 24, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''René Goscinny''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁəne ɡɔsini|lang}}, {{IPA-pl|ɡɔɕˈtɕinnɨ|lang|Pl-gościnny.ogg}}; 14 August 1926 – 5 November 1977) was a French comic editor and writer, who created the ''[[Asterix|Astérix]]'' [[comic book]] series with illustrator [[Albert Uderzo]]. Raised largely in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], where he attended French schools, he lived for a time in the United States. There he met Belgian cartoonist [[Morris (comics)|Morris]]. After his return to France, they collaborated for more than 20 years on the comic series ''[[Lucky Luke]]'' (in what was considered the series' golden age.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Babic2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Annessa Ann Babic|title=Comics as History, Comics as Literature: Roles of the Comic Book in Scholarship, Society, and Entertainment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sJJlAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA53|date=11 December 2013|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|isbn=978-1-61147-557-9|pages=53–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He wrote ''[[Iznogoud]]'' with [[Jean Tabary]]. Goscinny also wrote a series of children's books known as ''[[Le Petit Nicolas]]'' (''Little Nicolas'').

==Early life==
Goscinny was born in [[Paris]] in 1926, to [[Jews|Jewish]] immigrants from [[Poland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;obs&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Garcia|first= Laure|work =Le Nouvel Observateur | title = Uderzo, le dernier Gaulois | url = http://hebdo.nouvelobs.com/hebdo/parution/p2136/articles/a280131-uderzo__le_dernier_gaulois.html|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were Stanisław Simkha Gościnny (the surname means &quot;hospitable&quot; in Polish; Simkha is Jewish,  meaning &quot;happiness&quot;), a chemical engineer from [[Warsaw]], and Anna (Hanna) Bereśniak-Gościnna from Chodorków, a small village near [[Zhytomyr]] in the [[Second Polish Republic]] (now part of [[Ukraine]]).&lt;ref&gt;According to Yeruham Eniss, the village had a soap factory, and many Jews of nearby Chodorków had jobs selling and trading in soap. A census made in the late 1930s counted 3670 Jewish families in Chodorków before [[World War II]] ([[ShtetLinks]] website: alternate spellings include Chortkow and Khodorkov)&lt;/ref&gt; Goscinny's maternal grandfather, Abraham Lazare Berezniak, founded a printing company. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.timesofisrael.com/the-wild-adventures-of-rene-goscinny-jewish-inventor-of-asterix-and-obelix/&lt;/ref&gt; Claude, Goscinny's older brother, was six years older, born on 10 December 1920.

Stanisław and Anna had met in Paris and married in 1919. When René was two, the Gościnnys moved to [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], because his father had been hired as a chemical engineer there. René had a happy childhood in Buenos Aires and studied in French-language schools there. He was often the &quot;class clown&quot;, probably to compensate for a natural shyness. He started drawing very early on, inspired by the illustrated stories which he enjoyed reading.

In December 1943, the year after Goscinny graduated from lycée or high school, his father died of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] (stroke). The youth had to go to work. The next year, he got his first job, as an assistant accountant in a tire recovery factory. After being laid off the following years, Goscinny became a junior illustrator in an advertising agency.&lt;ref name=&quot;lambiek&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Lambiek Comiclopedia | title = René Goscinny | url =http://lambiek.net/artists/g/goscinny.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goscinny, along with his mother, emigrated from Argentina and immigrated to New York, United States in 1945, to join her brother Boris. To avoid service in the [[United States Armed Forces]], he travelled to France to join the [[French Army]] in 1946. He served at [[Aubagne]], in the 141st Alpine Infantry Battalion. Promoted to senior [[corporal]], he became the appointed artist of the regiment and drew illustrations and posters for the army.

==First works==
The following year, Goscinny worked on an illustrated version of the [[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]] short story &quot;[[La Fille aux yeux d'or|The Girl with the Golden Eyes]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Honoré de Balzac, ''La fille aux yeux d'or'', Paris : Éditions du livre français, collection &quot;Les classiques du XIXe&quot;, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; In April of that year he returned to New York. 

There he went through the most difficult period of his life. For a while, Goscinny was jobless, alone, and living in poverty. By 1948, though, he had begun working in a small studio, where he became friends with future ''[[MAD Magazine]]'' contributors [[Will Elder]], [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]], and [[Harvey Kurtzman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lambiek&quot;/&gt; Goscinny became art director at [[Kunen Publishers]], where he wrote four books for children. 

Around this time he met two Belgian comic artists, Joseph Gillain, better known as [[Jijé]], and Maurice de Bevere, also known as [[Morris (comics)|Morris]]. Morris lived in the US for six years, having already started his cartoon series ''[[Lucky Luke]].'' (He and Goscinny collaborated on this, with Goscinny writing it from 1955 until his death in 1977, a period described as its golden age).&lt;ref name=&quot;lambiek&quot;/&gt;

[[Georges Troisfontaines]], chief of the [[World Press agency]], convinced Goscinny to return to France in 1951 in order to work for his agency as the head of the [[Paris]] office. There he met [[Albert Uderzo]], with whom he started a longtime collaboration.&lt;ref name=&quot;lambiek&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lagardere&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Lagardère | title = Release of the 33rd Asterix volume | url =http://www.lagardere.com/us/actualites/detail_actu.cfm?idt=9&amp;idn=5994&amp;nav=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They started out with some work for ''[[Bonnes Soirées]]'', a women's magazine for which Goscinny wrote ''Sylvie''. Goscinny and Uderzo also launched the series ''Jehan Pistolet'' and ''Luc Junior,'' in the magazine ''La Libre Junior''.

In 1955, Goscinny, together with Uderzo, [[Jean-Michel Charlier]], and [[Jean Hébrad]], founded the syndicate Edipress/Edifrance. The syndicate launched publications such as ''Clairon'' for the factory union and ''Pistolin'' for a chocolate company. Goscinny and Uderzo cooperated on the series ''Bill Blanchart'' in ''Jeannot'', ''Pistolet'' in ''Pistolin,'' and ''Benjamin et Benjamine'' in the magazine of the same name. Under the pseudonym Agostini, Goscinny wrote ''[[Le petit Nicolas|Le Petit Nicolas]]'' for [[Jean-Jacques Sempé]] in ''[[Le Moustique]].'' It was later published in ''[[Sud-Ouest (magazine)|Sud-Ouest]]'' and ''[[Pilote]]'' magazines.

In 1956, Goscinny began a collaboration with ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine. He wrote some short stories for [[Jo Angenot]] and [[Albert Weinberg]], and worked on ''Signor Spaghetti'' with [[Dino Attanasio]], ''Monsieur Tric'' with [[Bob de Moor]], ''[[Prudence Petitpas]]'' with [[Maurice Maréchal (comics artist)|Maurice Maréchal]], ''Globul le Martien'' and ''Alphonse'' with [[Tibet (comics)|Tibet]], ''Strapontin'' with [[Arthur Berckmans|Berck]] and ''[[Modeste et Pompon]]'' with [[André Franquin]]. An early creation with Uderzo, ''[[Oumpah-pah]]'', was also adapted for serial publication in ''Tintin'' from 1958-1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;asterix int&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Asterix International! | title = Albert Uderzo | url =http://www.asterix-international.de/asterix/uderzo.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Goscinny appeared in the magazines ''[[Paris-Flirt]]'' (''Lili Manequin'' with [[Will (comics)|Will]]) and ''[[Vaillant (magazine)|Vaillant]]'' (''Boniface et Anatole'' with Jordom, ''Pipsi'' with Godard).

==''Pilote'' and ''Astérix'' (1959)==
In 1959, the Édifrance/Édipresse syndicate started the [[Franco-Belgian comics]] magazine ''[[Pilote]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;BDO-1959&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=BDoubliées|title=Pilote année 1959|url=http://bdoubliees.com/journalpilote/annees/1959.htm|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goscinny became one of the most productive writers for the magazine. In the magazine's first issue, he launched ''[[Asterix|Astérix]]'', with Uderzo. The series was an instant hit and remains popular worldwide. Goscinny also restarted the series ''Le Petit Nicolas'' and ''Jehan Pistolet'', now called ''Jehan Soupolet''. Goscinny also began ''Jacquot le Mousse'' and ''Tromblon et Bottaclou'' with Godard.

The magazine was bought by [[Georges Dargaud]] in 1960, and Goscinny became editor-in-chief. He also began new series like ''Les Divagations de Monsieur Sait-Tout'' (with Martial), ''La Potachologie Illustrée'' (with [[Cabu]]), ''Les Dingodossiers'' (with [[Marcel Gotlieb|Gotlib]]) and ''La Forêt de Chênebeau'' (with [[Mic Delinx]]). With [[Tabary]], he launched ''Calife Haroun El Poussah'' in ''Record'', a series that was later continued in ''Pilote'' as ''[[Iznogoud]]''. With [[Raymond Macherot]] he created ''Pantoufle'' for ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]''.

==Family==
Goscinny married Gilberte Pollaro-Millo in 1967. In 1968 their daughter [[Anne Goscinny]] was born. She also became an author.

==Death==

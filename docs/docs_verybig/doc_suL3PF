==== Criteria ====
People who fulfill all of the following criteria can obtain German citizenship through naturalisation:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/faqs/EN/themen/migration/staatsang/Erwerb_der_deutschen_Staatsbuergerschaft_durch_Eingbuergerung_en.html;jsessionid=069AB884F837BA8296892B90A7CD1D49.1_cid364?nn=9386226|title=Becoming a German citizen by naturalization|website=Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community|language=en|access-date=2019-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* At least 8 years' residence in Germany with a valid residence permit. This minimum period is reduced for the following:
** 7 years for people who have successfully completed an official integration course;
** 3 years for spouses and registered same-sex partners of a German citizen (must have been married or in the registered partnership for at least 2 years at the time of application).
* Declaring allegiance to the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German Constitution]];

==== Loss of previous citizenship ====
People who naturalise as German citizens must usually give up their previous nationality, as German law takes a restrictive approach to [[multiple citizenship]]. Exceptions are made for:

* [[European Union|EU]] and [[Switzerland|Swiss]] citizens, provided that the law of their country of origin does not prohibit the acquisition of another citizenship;
* Citizens of countries where renouncing one's citizenship is too difficult or humiliating (e.g. [[Afghan nationality law|Afghanistan]]), prohibitively expensive (e.g. the [[United States citizenship|United States]]) or legally impossible (e.g. [[Argentinian nationality law|Argentina]]).

===India===
{{Main|Indian nationality law}}
The [[India]]n citizenship and nationality law and the [[Constitution of India]] provides single citizenship for the entire country. The provisions relating to citizenship at the commencement of the Constitution are contained in Articles 5 to 11&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/India_2014#50|title=Constitute|website=www.constituteproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Part&amp;nbsp;II of the Constitution of India.

The Citizenship (Amendment) Ordinance 2005 was promulgated by the President of India and came into force on 28 June 2005.{{cn|date=December 2019}}

Following these reforms, Indian nationality law largely follows the ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' (citizenship by right of blood) as opposed to the ''[[jus soli]]'' (citizenship by right of birth within the territory).{{cn|date=December 2019}}

In 2019, a [[Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019|Citizenship Amendment Act]] was passed by the Parliament of India. This Act aims at fast tracking citizenship for illegal immigrants who have entered India on or before 31st December, 2014 from the neighbouring countries of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=&quot;PIBPassesBill&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=195783|title=Parliament passes the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2019|website=pib.gov.in|access-date=18 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191216092712/https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx%3Frelid%3D195783|archive-date=16 December 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

**By naturalization: the foreigner can apply for Italian citizenship after ten years of legal residence in [[Italy]], reduced to five years for those who have been recognized as stateless or refugee and four years for citizens of countries of the [[European Community]].

===Indonesia===
{{Main|Indonesian nationality law}}
[[Indonesia]]n nationality is regulated by Law No. 12/2006 (UU No. 12 Tahun 2006). The Indonesian nationality law is based on [[jus sanguinis]] and [[jus soli]]. The Indonesian nationality law does not recognize [[dual citizenship]] except for people under the age of 18 (single citizenship principle). After reaching 18 years of age individuals are forced to choose one citizenship (limited double citizenship principle).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Indonesia's New Immigration Law Confuses One and All|newspaper= [[Jakarta Globe]]|url= http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/new-immigration-law-confuses-one-and-all/472829|accessdate= 2012-06-15|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120603061637/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/new-immigration-law-confuses-one-and-all/472829|archive-date= 2012-06-03|url-status= dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A foreign citizen can apply to become an Indonesian citizen with the following requirements:
* Age 18 or older, or married
* Resided in Indonesia for a minimum of 5 consecutive years or 10 non-consecutive years
* Physically and mentally healthy
* Ability to speak [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and acknowledge [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] and [[Constitution of Indonesia|Undang-Undang Dasar Negara Republik Indonesia Tahun 1945]]
* Never convicted of a crime for which the punishment is imprisonment for one year or more
* If having Indonesian citizenship will not give the person dual citizenship
* Employed or have fixed income
* Pay citizenship fee

Any application for citizenship is granted by the [[President of Indonesia]].

===Israel===
[[Israel]]'s [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] was made on 14 May 1948, the day before the British Mandate was due to expire as a result of the United Nations Partition Plan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0514.html &quot;Zionists Proclaim New State of Israel; Truman Recognizes it and Hopes for Peace&quot;], ''[[New York Times]]'', 15 May 1948&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli parliament created two laws regarding immigration, citizenship and naturalization: the [[Law of Return]] and the [[Israeli citizenship law]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Warsoff&quot;&gt;Warsoff, Louis A. &quot;Citizenship in the State of Israel – a Comment&quot;, ''New York University Law Review'' 33(1958): 857–862. Web. 28 Nov. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Law of Return, enacted on July 15, 1950, gives [[Jews]] living anywhere in the world the right to immigrate to Israel. This right to immigrate did not and still does not grant citizenship. In fact, for four years after Israel gained independence, there were no Israeli citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warsoff&quot; /&gt;

On July 14, 1952, the Israeli parliament enacted the Israeli Nationality Law.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warsoff&quot; /&gt; The Nationality Law naturalized all citizens of Mandated Palestine, the inhabitants of Israel on July 15, 1952, and those who had legally resided in Israel between May 14, 1948, and July 14, 1952. The law further clarified that naturalization was available to immigrants who had arrived before Israel's creation, immigrants who arrived after statehood was granted, and those who did not come to Israel as immigrants but have since expressed desire to settle in Israel, with restriction. Naturalization applicants must also meet the following requirements: be over 18 years of age, have resided in Israel for three out of the five preceding years, have settled or intend to settle permanently in Israel, have some knowledge of Hebrew, and have renounced prior nationality or demonstrated ability to renounce nationality after becoming a citizen of Israel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warsoff&quot; /&gt;

Because of Israel's relatively new and culturally mixed identity, Israel does not grant citizenship to people born on Israeli soil. Instead, the government chose to enact a jus sanguinis system, with the naturalization restrictions listed above. There is currently no legislation on second-generation immigrants (those born in Israel to immigrant parents). Furthermore, foreign spouses can apply for citizenship through the Minister of the Interior, but have a variety of restrictions and are not guaranteed citizenship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weil&quot;&gt;Weil, Patrick. &quot;Comparing Twenty-Five Nationality Laws.&quot; ''Citizenship Today: Global Perspectives and Practices''.

===Malaysia===
{{main|Malaysian nationality law}}
Naturalisation in Malaysia is guided by the 1964 [[Constitution of Malaysia|Malaysian Constitution]]. According to the law, those who want to be the country citizen should live in the country for a period of 10–12 years. The would-be-citizens are required to speak the [[Malay language]] as well submitting the identity cards of two Malaysians who recommend the applicant for citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://traveltips.usatoday.com/malaysian-citizenship-requirements-63015.html|title=Malaysian Citizenship Requirements|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Government of Malaysia]] does not recognise dual citizenship, those who seek naturalisation are needed to reside permanently in the country and renouncing their former country citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kln.gov.my/c/document_library/get_file?p_l_id=218250&amp;folderId=228818&amp;name=DLFE-6117.doc|title=Application to Renounce Malaysia Citizenship|publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Malaysia]]|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
Naturalization in [[Russia]] is guided by articles 13 and 14 of the federal law “About Citizenship of Russian Federation” passed on May 31, 2002. Citizenship of Russia can be obtained in general or simplified order. To become a citizen in general order, one must be 18 years of age or older, continuously live in Russia as a permanent resident for at least five years (this term is limited to one year for valued specialists, political asylum seekers and refugees), have legal means of existence, promise to obey the laws and [[Constitution of Russia]] and be fluent in the [[Russian language]].

There is also a possibility to naturalize in a simplified order, in which certain requirements will be waived. Eligible for that are people, at least one parent of whom is a Russian citizen living on Russian territory; people, who lived on the territories of the former [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]] but never obtained citizenships of those nations after they gained independence; people, who were born on the territory of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|RSFSR]] and formerly held [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] citizenship; people married to Russian citizens for at least 3 years; people, who served in [[Russian Armed Forces]] under contract for at least 3 years; parents of mentally incapacitated children over 18 who are Russian citizens; participants of the State Program for Assisting Compatriots Residing Abroad; and some other categories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russia&quot;&gt;[http://archive.mid.ru//dks.nsf/mnsdoc/04.03.02.02 About Citizenship of Russian Federation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117141703/http://archive.mid.ru/dks.nsf/mnsdoc/04.03.02.02 |date=2016-01-17 }}, 31 May 2002 N 62-ФЗ&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
Chapter 2 of the South African Citizenship Act, enacted on October 6, 1995, defines who is considered a naturalized citizen at the time of the act and also outlines the naturalization process for future immigrants.&lt;ref name=&quot;South Africa&quot;&gt;{{cite act |type=Act |index=88 |date=1995 |title=South African Citizenship Act, 1995 |url=https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/201409/act88of1995.pdf |language=English | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191107182036/https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/201409/act88of1995.pdf
 | archive-date=2 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any person who immediately prior to the commencement of the act had been a South African citizen via naturalization, had been deemed to be a South African citizen by registration, or had been a citizen via naturalization of any of the former states now composing South Africa is now considered to be a naturalized citizen of South Africa.

Those wishing to apply for naturalization in the future must apply to the Minister of Home Affairs and must meet a slew of requirements. First, naturalization applicants must be over the age of 18 and must have been a permanent resident of South Africa for five years prior to application (prior to 2010, the permanent residence requirement was one year prior to application and for four out of the eight years prior to application).&lt;ref name=&quot;South Africa Amendment 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite act |type=Act |index=17 |date=2010 |title=South African Citizenship Amendment Act, 2010 |url=https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/201409/a1720100.pdf |language=English | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201001224421/https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/201409/a1720100.pdf
 | archive-date=2 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applicants must also demonstrate good character and knowledge of the basic responsibilities and privileges of a South African citizen. The ability to communicate in one of the official languages of South Africa is also required. Applicants must show the intention to reside in South Africa after naturalization, and they are required to make a declaration of allegiance. The [[Constitution of South Africa]] states that national legislation must provide for the acquisition, loss and restoration of citizenship.&lt;ref name=&quot;South Africa Constitution&quot;&gt;{{cite act |type=Act |index=108 |date=1996 |title=[[Constitution of the Republic of South Africa|Constitution of South Africa]], 1996 |article=1 |article-type=Chapter |url=https://www.gov.za/documents/constitution/chapter-1-founding-provisions |language=English | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201001225321/https://www.gov.za/documents/constitution/chapter-1-founding-provisions

Being a naturalized South African citizen is a privilege, not a right. Even after meeting all the requirements and going through the naturalization process, the minister holds the right to deny citizenship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minister&quot;&gt;&quot;South African Citizenship Through Naturalization.&quot; Immigration Assistant. N.p., 21 July 2009. Web. 1 Dec. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign spouses of South African citizens can apply for naturalization after two years of marriage, but is subject to potential denial of the minister. The minister can also grant citizenship to minors, if their parent applies for them.

The minister also holds the power to revoke naturalization at any time for specific reasons listed in the Act. Reasons for revoking the naturalization certificate include marrying someone who is a citizen of another country and holding citizenship in another country, or applying for citizenship of another country without prior authorization for retention of citizenship. If a permanent resident is denied naturalization, he or she must wait at least one year before reapplying.

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|British nationality law}}
There has always been a distinction in the [[law of England and Wales]] between the subjects of the monarch and aliens: the monarch's subjects owed the monarch allegiance, and included those born in his or her dominions (natural-born subjects) and those who later gave him or her their allegiance (naturalised subjects). Today, the requirements for naturalisation as a citizen of the [[United Kingdom]] depend on whether or not one is the spouse or [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|civil partner]] of a citizen. An applicant who is a spouse or civil partner of a British citizen must:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/apply-citizenship-spouse|title=Apply for citizenship if your spouse is a British citizen|website=gov.uk|accessdate=September 9, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=September 2020}}
* hold [[indefinite leave to remain]] in the [[UK]] (or an equivalent such as [[Right of Abode (United Kingdom)|Right of Abode]] or Irish citizenship)
* have lived legally in the UK for three years
* been outside of the UK no more than 90 days during the one-year period prior to filing the application.
* show sufficient knowledge of life in the UK, either by passing the [[Life in the United Kingdom test]] or by attending combined English language and citizenship classes. Proof of this must be supplied with one's application for naturalisation. Those aged 65 or over may be able to claim exemption.
* meet specified [[English language|English]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]] or [[Scottish Gaelic language]] competence standards. 

For those not married to or in a civil partnership with a British citizen, the requirements are:
* Five years legal residence in the UK
* Indefinite leave to remain or &quot;equivalent&quot; for this purpose (see above) must have been held for 12&amp;nbsp;months
* the applicant must intend to continue to live in the UK or work overseas for the UK government or a British corporation or association
* the same &quot;good character&quot; standards apply as for those married to British citizens
* the same language and knowledge of life in the UK standards apply as for those married to British citizens.

The [[Naturalization Act of 1795]] set the initial rules on naturalization: &quot;free, White persons&quot; who had been resident for five years or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sunypress.edu/p-6435-race-nation-and-refuge.aspx|title=Race, Nation, and Refuge|website=www.sunypress.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; An 1862 law allowed honorably discharged Army veterans of any war to petition for naturalization after only one year of residence in the United States. An 1894 law extended the same privilege to honorably discharged five-year veterans of the Navy or Marine Corps. Laws enacted in 1919, 1926, 1940, and 1952 continued preferential treatment provisions for veterans.&lt;ref&gt;Schulze, Lorine McGinnis (2003).

Following the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898, Philippine citizens were classified as U.S. nationals, and the 1917 [[Jones–Shafroth Act]] granted U.S. citizenship to natives of [[Puerto Rico]]. But the 1934 [[Tydings–McDuffie Act]] reclassified Filipinos as aliens, and set a quota of 50 immigrants per year, and otherwise applying the [[Immigration Act of 1924]] to them.

The [[Magnuson Act]] repealed the Chinese Exclusion Act. During the 1940s, 100 annual immigrants from [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]] and the Philippines were allowed. The [[War Brides Act]] of 1945 permitted soldiers to bring back their foreign wives and established precedent in naturalization through [[marriage]]. The [[Immigration Act of 1965]] finally allowed people from all nations to be given equal access to immigration and naturalization.

[[Illegal immigration]] became a major issue in the United States at the end of the 20th century. The [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986]], while tightening border controls, also provided the opportunity of naturalization for illegal aliens who had been in the country for at least four years. Today, [[lawful permanent residents (United States)|lawful permanent residents]] of the United States are eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship after five years,&lt;ref name=&quot;1101(a)(23)&quot;/&gt; unless they continue to be married to a U.S. citizen, in which case they can apply after only three years of permanent residency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.immigrationamerica.org/citizenship/naturalization &quot;Citizenship Through Naturalization&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824103202/http://www.immigrationamerica.org/citizenship/naturalization |date=2011-08-24 }}, ImmigrationAmerica&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Child Citizenship Act of 2000]] streamlined the naturalization process for children [[adoption in the United States|adopted]] [[international adoption|internationally]]. A child under age 18 who is adopted by at least one U.S. citizen parent, and is in the custody of the citizen parent(s), is now automatically naturalized once admitted to the United States as an immigrant or when legally adopted in the United States, depending on the visa under which the child was admitted to the United States. The Act also provides that the non-citizen minor child of a newly naturalized U.S. citizen, whether by birth or adoption, also automatically receives U.S. citizenship

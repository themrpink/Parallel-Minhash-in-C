{{Very long|date=August 2019}}
The '''history of Estonia''' forms a part of the [[history of Europe]]. Humans settled in the region of [[Estonia]] near the end of the [[Quaternary glaciation|last glacial era]], beginning from around 8500 BC. Before German crusaders invaded in the early 13th century, proto-Estonians of [[ancient Estonia]] worshipped spirits of nature.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Starting with the [[Northern Crusades]] in the Middle Ages, Estonia became a battleground for centuries where Denmark, Germany, Russia, Sweden and Poland fought their many wars&lt;ref name=&quot;culture_and_customs_of_the_baltic_states&quot;&gt;Compare: {{Cite book | last1 = O'Connor | first1 = Kevin J. | title = Culture and customs of the Baltic states | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IpR0-OrrwssC | year = 2006 | publisher = [[Greenwood Press]] | location = Westport, Connecticut | isbn = 978-0-313-33125-1 | page = 4 | quote = Given their precarious geographical position and their history as a battleground on which larger powers such as Germany, Russia, Sweden and Poland fought their many wars, it is amazing that the Baltic countries exist at all.}}&lt;/ref&gt; over controlling the important geographical position of the country as a gateway between East and West.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

After Danes and Germans conquered the area in 1227, Estonia was ruled initially by Denmark in the north, by the [[Livonian Order]], an autonomous part of the [[Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights]] and by [[Baltic German]] ecclesiastical states of the [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Empire]]. From 1418 to 1562 the whole of Estonia formed part of the [[Livonian Confederation]]. After the [[Livonian War]] of 1558–1583, Estonia became part of the [[Swedish Empire]] until 1710/1721, [[Capitulation of Estonia and Livonia|when Sweden ceded it]] to [[Russian Empire|Russia]] as a result of the [[Great Northern War]] of 1700–1721. Throughout this period the [[Baltic Germans|Baltic-German]] nobility enjoyed autonomy, and [[German language|German]] served as the language of administration and education.

The [[Estophilia#Estophile Enlightenment Period|Estophile Enlightenment Period]] (1750–1840) led to the [[Estonian national awakening]] in the middle of the 19th century. In the aftermath of World War I (1914-1918) and the Russian revolutions of 1917, Estonians  [[Estonian Declaration of Independence|declared their independence]] in February 1918. The [[Estonian War of Independence]] (1918-1920) ensued on two fronts: the newly proclaimed state fought against [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevist Russia]] to the east and against the Baltic German forces (the [[Baltische Landeswehr]]) to the south. The [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Estonian)|Tartu Peace Treaty]] (February 1920) marked the end of fighting and recognised Estonian independence in perpetuity.

In 1940, in the wake of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939, the [[Soviet Union]] occupied Estonia and (according to e.g. the US,&lt;ref name=&quot;USA&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/rm/86539.htm |title= U.S.-Baltic Relations: Celebrating 85 Years of Friendship |last= Fried|first= Daniel|date= 14 June 2007|publisher= U.S. State Department}}&lt;/ref&gt; the EU,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+MOTION+B6-2007-0215+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN|title= Motion for a resolution on the Situation in Estonia|date= 21 May 2007|publisher= European Parliament|accessdate= 2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[European Court of Human Rights]]{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}) illegally annexed the country. In the course of [[Operation Barbarossa]], [[Nazi Germany]] occupied Estonia in 1941; later in [[World War II]] the Soviet Union reoccupied it (1944). Estonia regained independence in 1991 in the course of the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and joined the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]] in 2004.

==Ancient Estonia: pre-history==
{{Main|Ancient Estonia}}

===Mesolithic Period===
[[File:KundaCultureTools.jpg|thumb|Tools made by [[Kunda culture]], the Estonian History Museum]]
The region has been populated since the end of the [[Quaternary glaciation|Late Pleistocene Ice Age]], about 10,000 BC. The earliest traces of human settlement in Estonia are connected with the [[Kunda culture]]. The early [[mesolithic]] [[Pulli settlement]] is located by the [[Pärnu]] River. It has been dated to the beginning of the 9th millennium BC. The Kunda culture received its name from the [[Kunda, Estonia|''Lammasmäe'']] settlement site in northern Estonia, which dates from earlier than 8500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Subrenat|2004|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bone and stone artifacts similar to those found at Kunda have been discovered elsewhere in Estonia, as well as in [[Latvia]], northern [[Lithuania]] and southern [[Finland]]. Among minerals, [[flint]] and [[quartz]] were used the most for making cutting tools.

===Neolithic Period===
The beginning of the [[Neolithic Period]] is marked by the [[ceramics]] of the Narva culture, and appear in Estonia at the beginning of the 5th millennium. The oldest finds date from around 4900 BC. The first pottery was made of thick clay mixed with pebbles, shells or plants. The Narva-type ceramics are found throughout almost the entire Estonian coastal region and on the islands. The stone and bone tools of the era have a notable similarity with the artifacts of the Kunda culture.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such a linking of archaeologically defined cultural entities with linguistic ones cannot be proven, and it has been suggested that the increase of settlement finds in the period is more likely to have been associated with an economic boom related to the warming of climate. Some researchers have even argued that a [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] form of language may have been spoken in Estonia and Finland since the end of the last glaciation.&lt;ref name=&quot;the_cambridge_history_of_scandinavia&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

The burial customs of the comb pottery people included additions of figures of animals, birds, snakes and men carved from bone and [[amber]]. Antiquities from comb pottery culture are found from Northern Finland to Eastern [[Prussia]].

The beginning of the Late Neolithic Period about 2200 BC is characterized by the appearance of the [[Corded Ware culture]], pottery with corded decoration and well-polished stone axes (s.c. boat-shape axes). Evidence of agriculture is provided by charred grains of wheat on the wall of a corded-ware vessel found in Iru settlement. Osteological analysis show an attempt was made to domesticate the [[wild boar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Subrenat|2004|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific burial customs were characterized by the dead being laid on their sides with their knees pressed against their breast, one hand under the head. Objects placed into the graves were made of the bones of domesticated animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

===Bronze Age===
[[File:StoneCistGraves.jpg|thumb|Stone [[cist]] graves from the Bronze Age in Northern Estonia]]

The beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in Estonia is dated to approximately 1800 BC. The development of the borders between the [[Balto-Finnic peoples|Finnic peoples]] and the [[Balts]] was under way. The first fortified settlements, Asva and Ridala on the island of [[Saaremaa]] and Iru in Northern Estonia, began to be built. The development of shipbuilding facilitated the spread of bronze. Changes took place in burial customs, a new type of burial ground spread from Germanic to Estonian areas, and stone [[cist]] graves and cremation burials became increasingly common, alongside a small number of boat-shaped stone graves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Subrenat|2004|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About the 7th century BC, a large meteorite hit [[Saaremaa]] island and created the [[Kaali crater]]s.

About 325 BC, the Greek explorer [[Pytheas]] possibly visited Estonia. The [[Thule]] island he described has been identified as [[Saaremaa]] by [[Lennart Meri]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Silverwhite&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

===Iron Age===
The [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]] began in Estonia about 500 BC and lasted until the middle of the 1st century AD. The oldest iron items were imported, although since the 1st century iron was [[smelting|smelted]] from local marsh and lake ore. Settlement sites were located mostly in places that offered natural protection. Fortresses were built, although used temporarily. The appearance of square [[Celtic field]]s surrounded by enclosures in Estonia date from the Pre-Roman Iron Age. The majority of stones with man-made indents, which presumably were connected with magic designed to increase crop fertility, date from this period. A new type of grave, quadrangular burial mounds, began to develop. Burial traditions show the clear beginning of [[social stratification]].

This period saw a single Siberian Y-DNA haplogroup making up half of male lineages in Estonia.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20190512050452/https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(19)30424-5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Urban design''' is the process of designing and shaping the physical features of [[city|cities]], [[town]]s, and [[village]]s and [[urban planning|planning]] for the provision of municipal services to residents and visitors. Although it deals with issues of a larger scale than [[architecture]], it cannot be understood as a wholly separated field of research and design, since the quality of one depends on the quality of the other. In fact, it is this very [[interdependence theory|interdependency]], which has been termed ''relational design''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Massip-Bosch |first=E. |title=Architecture &amp; The City: A Relational Design Primer |year=2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Barcelona]]-based architect Enric Massip-Bosch, which makes urban design and architecture inextricably linked in many university education programs, especially in Europe. This tendency towards reintegration in architectural studies is also gaining momentum in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Salama |first1=A. |last2=O'Reilly |first2=W. |last3=Noschis |first3=K. |title=Architectural Education Today: Cross-cultural Perspectives |publisher=ARTI-ARCH |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Urban design deals with the larger scale of groups of buildings, infrastructure, streets, and [[public space]]s, entire [[neighbourhood]]s and districts, and entire cities, with the goal of making [[urban area|urban environments]] that are [[equity (economics)|equitable]], beautiful, performative, and [[sustainable development|sustainable]].

Urban design is an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field that utilizes the procedures and the elements of architecture and other related professions, including [[landscape design]], [[urban planning]], [[civil engineering]], and [[municipal engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Van Assche, K., |author2=Beunen, R. |author3=Duineveld, M. |author4=de Jong, H. |year=2013 |url=http://plt.sagepub.com/content/12/2/177.short |title=Co-evolutions of planning and design: Risks and benefits of design perspectives in planning systems |journal=[[Planning Theory]] |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=177-98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moudon |first=Anne Vernez |title=A Catholic Approach to Organizing What Urban Designers Should Know |journal=Journal of Planning Literature |date=1992 |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=331–349 |doi=10.1177/088541229200600401}}&lt;/ref&gt; It borrows substantive and procedural knowledge from public administration, sociology, law, urban geography, urban economics and other related disciplines from the social and behavioral sciences, as well as from the natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of the City |last=Caves |first=R. W. |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2004|isbn=978-0415862875 |location= |pages=692}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In more recent times different sub-subfields of urban design have emerged such as strategic urban design, [[landscape urbanism]], [[water-sensitive urban design]], and [[sustainable urbanism]]. Urban design demands an understanding of a wide range of subjects from physical geography to social science, and an appreciation for disciplines, such as [[real estate development]], [[urban economics]], [[political economy]] and [[social theory]].

Urban designers work to create inclusive cities that protect the commons, ensure equal access to and distribution of public goods, and meet the needs of all residents, particularly women, people of color, and other marginalized populations. Through design interventions, urban designers work to revolutionize the way we conceptualize our social, political and spatial systems as strategies to produce and reproduce a more equitable and innovative future.

Urban design is about making connections between people and places, movement and urban form, nature and the built fabric. Urban design draws together the many strands of place-making, environmental stewardship, social equity and economic viability into the creation of places with distinct beauty and identity. Urban design draws these and other strands together, creating a vision for an area and then deploying the resources and skills needed to bring the vision to life.

Urban design theory deals primarily with the design and management of [[public space]] (i.e. the 'public environment', 'public realm' or 'public domain'), and the way public places are used and experienced. Public space includes the totality of spaces used freely on a day-to-day basis by the general public, such as streets, plazas, parks and public infrastructure.  Some aspects of privately owned spaces, such as building facades or domestic gardens, also contribute to public space and are therefore also considered by urban design theory. Important writers on urban design theory include [[Christopher Alexander]], [[Peter Calthorpe]], [[Gordon Cullen]], [[Andres Duany]], [[Jane Jacobs]], [[Mitchell Joachim]], [[Jan Gehl]], [[Allan Jacobs|Allan B. Jacobs]], [[Kevin A. Lynch|Kevin Lynch]], [[Aldo Rossi]], [[Colin Rowe]], [[Robert Venturi]], [[William H. Whyte]], [[Camillo Sitte]], Bill Hillier ([[Space syntax]]), and [[Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk]].

==History==
{{cleanup|section|reason=references need proper formatting; citations are missing|date=January 2017|talksection=history}}

Although contemporary professional use of the term 'urban design' dates from the mid-20th century, urban design as such has been practiced throughout history. Ancient examples of carefully planned and designed [[cities]] exist in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas, and are particularly well known within Classical Chinese, Roman and Greek cultures (see [[Hippodamus of Miletus]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

European Medieval cities are often, and often erroneously, regarded as exemplars of undesigned or 'organic' city development.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} There are many examples of considered urban design in the Middle Ages (see, e.g., David Friedman, ''Florentine New Towns: Urban Design in the Late Middle Ages'', MIT 1988).  In England, many of the towns listed in the 9th century [[Burghal Hidage]] were designed on a grid, examples including [[Southampton]], [[Wareham, Dorset]] and [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire]], having been rapidly created to provide a defensive network against Danish invaders.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} 12th century western Europe brought renewed focus on urbanisation as a means of stimulating economic growth and generating revenue.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The [[burgage]] system dating from that time and its associated burgage plots brought a form of self-organising design to medieval towns.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}  Rectangular grids were used in the [[Bastides]] of 13th and 14th century Gascony, and the new towns of England created in the same period.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Throughout history, design of [[street]]s and deliberate configuration of [[public spaces]] with [[buildings]] have reflected contemporaneous social norms or philosophical and religious beliefs (see, e.g., [[Erwin Panofsky]], ''Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism'', Meridian Books, 1957). Yet the link between designed urban space and human mind appears to be [[wikt:bidirectional|bidirectional]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Indeed, the reverse impact of [[urban structure]] upon human behaviour and upon thought is evidenced by both [[environmental psychology|observational]] study and historical record.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} There are clear indications of impact through [[Renaissance]] urban design on the thought of [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Galileo Galilei]] (see, e.g., Abraham Akkerman, &quot;Urban planning in the founding of Cartesian thought,&quot; ''Philosophy and Geography'' 4(1), 1973). Already [[René Descartes]] in his ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'' had attested to the impact Renaissance planned new towns had upon his own thought, and much evidence exists that the Renaissance streetscape was also the perceptual stimulus that had led to the development of coordinate geometry (see, e.g., Claudia Lacour Brodsky, ''Lines of Thought: Discourse, Architectonics, and the Origins of Modern Philosophy'', Duke 1996).

The beginnings of modern urban design in Europe are associated with the [[Renaissance]] but, especially, with the [[Age of Enlightenment]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Spanish colonial cities were often planned, as were some towns settled by other imperial cultures.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} These sometimes embodied utopian ambitions as well as aims for functionality and good governance, as with [[James Oglethorpe]]'s plan for [[Savannah, Georgia]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} In the [[Baroque]] period the design approaches developed in French formal gardens such as [[Gardens of Versailles|Versailles]] were extended into urban development and redevelopment. In this period, when modern professional specialisations did not exist, urban design was undertaken by people with skills in areas as diverse as [[sculpture]], [[architecture]], [[garden design]], [[surveying]], [[astronomy]], and [[military engineering]]. In the 18th and 19th centuries, urban design was perhaps most closely linked with surveyors (engineers) and architects. The increase in urban populations brought with it problems of epidemic disease,{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} the response to which was a focus on public health, the rise in the UK of [[municipal engineering]] and the inclusion in British legislation of provisions such as minimum widths of street in relation to heights of buildings in order to ensure adequate light and [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Much of [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]'s work was concerned with urban design, and the newly formed profession of landscape architecture also began to play a significant role in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frederick Law Olmsted|url=http://www.fredericklawolmsted.com|publisher=fredericklawolmsted.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern Urban Design===
[[File:Lorategi-hiriaren diagrama 1902.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ebenezer Howard]]'s influential 1902 diagram, illustrating urban growth through [[Garden city movement|garden city]] &quot;off-shoots&quot;]]

[[File:Dubaimainstreet.JPG|thumb|Dubai main street.]]
In the 19th century, cities were industrializing and expanding at a tremendous rate. Private business largely dictated the pace and style of this development. The expansion created many hardships for the [[working poor]] and concern for public health increased. However, the [[laissez-faire]] style of government, in fashion for most of the [[Victorian era]], was starting to give way to a [[Social liberalism|New Liberalism]]. This gave more power to the public. The public wanted the government to provide citizens, especially factory workers, with healthier environments. Around 1900, modern urban design emerged from developing theories on how to mitigate the consequences of the [[industrial age]].

The first modern urban planning theorist was Sir [[Ebenezer Howard]]. His ideas, although utopian, were adopted around the world because they were highly practical. He initiated the garden city movement in 1898 [[garden city movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LFLydtcQf54C|title=Urban and Regional Planning|author=Peter Hall, Mark Tewdwr-Jones|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780203861424}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His garden cities were intended to be planned, self-contained communities surrounded by parks. Howard wanted the cities to be proportional with separate areas of residences, industry, and agriculture. Inspired by the [[Utopian]] novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' and [[Henry George]]'s work ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'', Howard published his book ''[[Garden Cities of To-morrow]]'' in 1898. His work is an important reference in the history of urban planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rudi.net/node/6597|title=To-morrow: A Peaceful Path to Real Reform}}&lt;/ref&gt; He envisioned the self-sufficient garden city to house 32,000 people on a site {{convert|6000|acres|0|abbr=on}}. He planned on a [[concentric]] pattern with open spaces, public parks, and six radial [[boulevard]]s, {{convert|120|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide, extending from the center. When it reached full population, Howard wanted another garden city to be developed nearby. He envisaged a cluster of several garden cities as [[satellite town|satellites]] of a central city of 50,000 people, linked by road and rail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Goodall | first = B | year = 1987 | title = Dictionary of Human Geography | place = London | publisher = Penguin}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His model for a garden city was first created at [[Letchworth]]{{Sfn | Hardy | 1999 | p = 4}} and [[Welwyn Garden City]] in [[Hertfordshire]]. Howard's movement was extended by [[Frederic Osborn|Sir Frederic Osborn]] to regional planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.tcpa.org.uk/data/files/18991999.pdf | title = History 1899–1999 | publisher = TCPA | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110727123822/http://www.tcpa.org.uk/data/files/18991999.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1900s, urban planning became professionalized. With input from [[utopia]]n visionaries, civil engineers, and [[local government|local councilors]], new approaches to city design were developed for consideration by decision makers such as elected officials. In 1899, the [[Town and Country Planning Association]] was founded. In 1909, the first academic course on urban planning was offered by the [[University of Liverpool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/619445/urban-planning|title=urban planning}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban planning was first officially embodied in the [[Housing, Town Planning, &amp;c. Act 1909|Housing and Town Planning Act of 1909]] Howard's ‘garden city’ compelled local authorities to introduce a system where all housing construction conformed to specific building standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/towncountry/towns/overview/townplanning/|title=The birth of town planning}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom following this Act, [[surveying|surveyor]], [[civil engineer]]s, [[architect]]s, and [[lawyer]]s began working together within [[municipal government|local authorities]].
In 1910, [[Thomas Adams (architect)|Thomas Adams]] became the first Town Planning Inspector at the [[Local Government Board]] and began meeting with practitioners. In 1914, The [[Town Planning Institute]] was established. The first urban planning course in America wasn’t established until 1924 at [[Harvard University]]. Professionals developed schemes for the development of land, transforming town planning into a new area of expertise.

In the 20th century, urban planning was forever changed by the [[automobile]] industry. Car oriented design impacted the rise of ‘urban design’. City layouts now had to revolve around roadways and traffic patterns.

In June 1928, [[Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne|the International Congresses of Modern Architecture (CIAM)]] was founded at the Chateau de [[la Sarraz]] in Switzerland, by a group of 28 European architects organized by [[Le Corbusier]], [[Hélène de Mandrot]], and [[Sigfried Giedion]]. At the CIAM was one of many 20th century [[Manifesto|manifestos]] meant to advance the cause of &quot;architecture as a social art&quot;. 

Team X was a group of architects and other invited participants who assembled starting in July 1953 at the 9th Congress of the [[Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne|International Congresses of Modern Architecture (CIAM)]] and created a schism within CIAM by challenging its doctrinaire approach to [[urbanism]]. 

In 1956, the term  “Urban design” was first used at a series of conferences hosted by [[Harvard University]]. The event provided a platform for Harvard's Urban Design program. The program also utilized the writings of famous urban planning thinkers: [[Gordon Cullen]], [[Jane Jacobs]], [[Kevin A. Lynch|Kevin Lynch]], and [[Christopher Alexander]]. 

In 1961, [[Gordon Cullen]] published ''The Concise Townscape''. He examined the traditional artistic approach to city design of theorists including Camillo Sitte, Barry Parker and [[Raymond Unwin]]. Cullen also created the concept of 'serial vision'. It defined the urban landscape as a series of related spaces.

In 1961, [[Jane Jacobs]] published ' ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]''. She critiqued the [[Modernism]] of [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne|CIAM]] (International Congresses of Modern Architecture). Jacobs also claimed [[crime rate]]s in publicly owned spaces were rising because of the Modernist approach of ‘city in the park’. She argued instead for an 'eyes on the street' approach to town planning through the resurrection of main public space precedents (e.g. streets, squares).

In the same year, [[Kevin A. Lynch|Kevin Lynch]] published ''The Image of the City''. He was seminal to urban design, particularly with regards to the concept of legibility. He reduced urban design theory to five basic elements: paths, districts, edges, nodes, landmarks. He also made the use of mental maps to understanding the city popular, rather than the two-dimensional physical master plans of the previous 50 years.

Other notable works:

''Architecture of the City'' by [[Aldo Rossi]] (1966)

''Learning from Las Vegas'' by [[Robert Venturi]] and [[Denise Scott Brown]] (1972)

''Collage City'' by [[Colin Rowe]](1978)

''The Next American Metropolis'' by [[Peter Calthorpe]](1993)

''The Social Logic of Space'' by Bill Hillier and Julienne Hanson (1984)

The popularity of these works resulted in terms that become everyday language in the field of urban planning. Aldo Rossi introduced 'historicism' and 'collective memory' to urban design. Rossi also proposed a 'collage metaphor' to understand the collection of new and old forms within the same urban space. Peter Calthorpe developed a manifesto for sustainable urban living via medium density living. He also designed a manual for building new settlements in his concept of [[Transit-oriented development|Transit Oriented Development]] (TOD). Bill Hillier and Julienne Hanson introduced [[Space Syntax]] to predict how movement patterns in cities would contribute to urban vitality, anti-social behaviour and economic success. 'Sustainability', 'livability', and 'high quality of urban components' also became commonplace in the field.

====Current Trends====
[[File:Jakriborg, juni 2005 c.jpg|thumb|[[Jakriborg]] in Sweden, started in the late 1990s as a [[New Urbanism|new urbanist]] eco-friendly [[Planned community|new town]] near [[Malmö]]]]
Today, urban design seeks to create [[sustainable city|sustainable urban]] environments with long-lasting structures, buildings, and overall livability. [[Walkability|Walkable]] urbanism is another approach to practice that is defined within the ''Charter of [[New Urbanism]]''. It aims to reduce environmental impacts by altering the built environment to create smart cities that support [[sustainable transport]]. Compact urban neighborhoods encourage residents to drive less. These neighborhoods have significantly lower environmental impacts when compared to [[urban sprawl|sprawling]] suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;Ewing, R [http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html &quot;Growing Cooler - the Evidence on Urban Development and Climate Change&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224212241/http://smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html |date=2010-12-24 }}. Retrieved on: 2009-03-16.&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent urban sprawl, [[Circular flow land use management]] was introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns.

As a result of the recent [[New Classical Architecture]] movement, [[sustainable architecture|sustainable construction]] aims to develop [[smart growth]], walkability, [[Vernacular architecture|architectural tradition]], and [[Classical architecture|classical design]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnu.org/charter Charter of the New Urbanism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty, Humanism, Continuity between Past and Future|url=http://www.traditionalarchitecture.co.uk/aims.html|publisher=Traditional Architecture Group|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contrasts from [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|globally uniform]] architecture. In the 1980s, urban design began to oppose the increasing solitary [[housing estate]]s and [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/smartgrowth05.pdf Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities]. American Institute of Architects. Retrieved on 2014-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt;
Managed Urbanisation with the view to making the urbanising process completely culturally and economically and environmentally sustainable, and as a possible solution to the [[urban sprawl]], Frank Reale has submitted an interesting concept of [https://sites.google.com/view/managedurbanisation/ Expanding Nodular Development (E.N.D.)] that integrates many urban design and ecological principles, to design and build smaller rural hubs with high-grade connecting freeways, rather than adding more expensive infrastructure to existing big cities and the resulting congestion.

==== Paradigm Shifts ====
Throughout the young existence of the Urban Design discipline, many paradigm shifts have occurred that have affected the trajectory of the field regarding theory and practice. These paradigm shifts cover multiple subject areas outside of the traditional design disciplines.

* Team 10 - The first major paradigm shift was the formation of Team 10 out of CIAM, or the [[Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne|Congres Internationaux d’Architecture Moderne]]. They believed that Urban Design should introduce ideas of ‘Human Association’, which pivots the design focus from the individual patron to concentrating on the collective urban population.  
* The Brundtland Report and Silent Spring - Another paradigm shift was the publication of the [[Brundtland Report]] and the book [[Silent Spring]] by Rachel Carson. These writings introduced the idea that human settlements could have detrimental impacts on ecological processes, as well as human health, which spurred a new era of environmental awareness in the field.  
* The Planner's Triangle - The Planner's Triangle, created by Scott Cambell, emphasized three main conflicts in the planning process. This diagram exposed the complex relationships between  Economic Development, Environmental Protection, and Equity and Social Justice. For the first time, the concept of Equity and Social Justice was considered as equally important as Economic Development and Environmental Protection within the design process. 
* Death of Modernism (Demolition of Pruitt Igoe) - Pruitt Igoe was a spatial symbol and representation of Modernist theory regarding social housing. In its failure and demolition, these theories were put into question and many within the design field considered the era of Modernism to be dead.  
* Neoliberalism &amp; the election of Reagan - The election of President Reagan and the rise of [[Neoliberalism]] affected the Urban Design discipline because it shifted the planning process to emphasize capitalistic gains and spatial privatization. Inspired by the trickle down approach of Reaganomics,  it was believed that the benefits of a capitalist emphasis within design would positively impact everyone. Conversely, this led exclusionary design practices and to what many consider as “the death of public space”. 

* Right to the City - The spatial and political battle over our citizens rights to the city has been an ongoing one. David Harvey, along with Dan Mitchell and Edward Soja, discussed rights to the city as a matter of shifting the historical thinking of how spatial matter was determined in a critical form. This change of thinking occurred in three forms: ontologically, sociologically, and the combination of this socio-spatial dialect. Together the aim shifted to be able to measure what matters in a socio-spatial context.  
* Black Lives Matter (Ferguson) - The [[Black Lives Matter]] movement challenged design thinking because it emphasized the injustices and inequities suffered by people of color in urban space, as well as emphasized their right to public space without discrimination and brutality. It claims that minority groups lack certain spatial privileges, and that this deficiency can result in matters of life and death. In order to reach an equitable state of urbanism, there needs to be equal identification of socio-economic lives within our urban scapes.

== New Approaches ==
There have been many different theories and approaches applied to the practice of urban design. 

[[New Urbanism]] is an approach that began in the 1980s as a place-making initiative to combat suburban sprawl. Its goal is to increase density by creating compact and complete towns and neighborhoods. The 10 principles of new urbanism are: walkability, connectivity, mixed-use and diversity, mixed housing, quality architecture and urban design, traditional neighborhood structure, increased density, smart transportation, sustainability, and quality of life. New urbanism and the developments that it has created are sources of debates within the discipline, primarily with the landscape urbanist approach but also due to its reproduction of idyllic architectural tropes that do not respond to the context. [[Andrés Duany|Andres Duany]], [[Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk]], [[Peter Calthorpe]], and [[Jeff Speck]] are all strongly associated with New Urbanism and its evolution over the years.

[[Landscape urbanism|Landscape Urbanism]] is a theory that first surfaced in the 1990s, arguing that the city is constructed of interconnected and ecologically rich horizontal field conditions, rather than the arrangement of objects and buildings. Charles Waldheim, [[Mohsen Mostafavi]], [[James Corner]], and [[Richard Weller]] are closely associated with this theory. Landscape urbanism theorises sites, territories, ecosystems, networks, infrastructures though [[Landscape design|landscape practice]] accrding to Corner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://cdland4.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/corner_terra-fluxus1.pdf|title= Landscape Urbanism Reader, Terra Fluxus|author=James Corner|year=2006|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|isbn=978-1-56898-439-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while applying a dynamic concepts to cities as ecosystems that grow, shrink or change phases of development according to Waldheim&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://scenariojournal.com/article/an-interview-with-charles-waldheim/|title=An Interview With Charles Waldheim: Landscape Urbanism Now |author=Meg Studer|year=2011|publisher=Scenario Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Everyday Urbanism]] is a concept introduced by Margaret Crawford and influenced by [[Henri Lefebvre|Henry Lefebvre]] that describes the everyday lived experience shared by urban residents including: commuting, working, relaxing, moving through city streets and sidewalks, shopping, buying and eating food, running errands. Everyday urbanism is not concerned with aesthetic value. Instead, it introduces the idea of eliminating the distance between experts and ordinary users and forces designers and planners to contemplate a ‘shift of power’ and address social life from a direct and ordinary perspective.

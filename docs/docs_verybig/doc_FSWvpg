===Development===
{{See also|List of tallest buildings in Las Vegas}}
When [[The Mirage]] opened in 1989, it started a trend of major resort development on the Las Vegas Strip outside of the city. This resulted in a drop in tourism in the downtown area, but many recent projects have increased the number of visitors to downtown.

An effort has been made by city officials to diversify the economy by attracting health-related, high-tech and other commercial interests. No state tax for individuals or corporations, as well as a lack of other forms of business-related taxes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lvrda.org|title=LVRDA|publisher=Lvrda.org|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; have aided the success of these efforts.

The Fremont Street Experience was built in an effort to draw tourists back to the area, and has been popular since its startup in 1995.

The city purchased {{convert|61|acre}} of property from the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] in 1995 with the goal of creating a better draw for more people to the downtown area. In 2004, Las Vegas Mayor [[Oscar Goodman]] announced plans for [[Symphony Park]], which could include a mixture of offerings, such as residential space and office buildings.

Already operating in Symphony Park is the Cleveland Clinic [[Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health]] (opened in 2010), [[The Smith Center for the Performing Arts]] (opened in 2012) and the DISCOVERY Children's Museum (opened in 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downtown.vegas/work/neighborhoods-districts/symphony-park/|title=Symphony Park, Las Vegas|publisher=Las Vegas Economic and Urban Development Agency|accessdate=April 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On land across from Symphony Park, the [[World Market Center]] Las Vegas opened in 2005. It currently encompasses three large buildings with a total of 5.1&amp;nbsp;million square feet. Trade shows for the furniture and furnishing industries are held there semiannually.

Also located nearby is the Las Vegas North Premium Outlets. A second expansion was completed in May 2015, with the mall currently offering 175 stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premiumoutlets.com/lasvegas|title=Premium Outlets: Las Vegas|publisher=Premiumoutlets.com|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new [[Las Vegas City Hall]] opened in February 2013 on downtown's Main Street. The former City Hall building is now occupied by the corporate headquarters for the major online retailer, [[Zappos.com]], which opened downtown in 2013. Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh has taken an interest in the urban area and has contributed $350&amp;nbsp;million toward a revitalization effort called the Downtown Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downtownproject.com|title=Downtown Project – Revitalizing Downtown Las Vegas|publisher=Downtownproject.com|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/magazine/what-happens-in-brookley-moves-to-vegas.html]{{dead link|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects funded include Las Vegas's first independent bookstore, [[The Writer's Block]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knpr.org/knpr/2014-12/despite-e-books-independent-bookstore-gambling-downtown-las-vegas |title=Despite E-Books, Independent Bookstore Gambling on Downtown Las Vegas |publisher=Webcitation.org |accessdate=May 30, 2015 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530082035/http://knpr.org/knpr/2014-12/despite-e-books-independent-bookstore-gambling-downtown-las-vegas |archive-date=May 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other industries===

A number of new industries have moved to Las Vegas in recent decades.  Online shoe retailer [[Zappos.com]] (now an Amazon subsidiary) was founded in San Francisco but by 2013 had moved its headquarters to downtown Las Vegas.  [[Allegiant Air]], a low-cost air carrier, launched in 1997 with its first hub at [[McCarran International Airport]] and headquarters in nearby Summerlin.

[[Planet 13 Holdings]], a cannabis company, have opened the world's largest [[Cannabis shop|cannabis dispensary]] in Las Vegas at 112,000 square feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/02/planet-13-worlds-largest-cannabis-dispensary-opens-in-las-vegas.html|title=The world's largest cannabis dispensary just opened in Vegas—and it has an entertainment complex attached|last=Im|first=Jimmy|date=2018-11-03|website=CNBC|language=en|access-date=2019-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/15/18096082/planet-13-marijuana-dispensary-las-vegas-luxury-marketing-branding-cannabis|title=We visited the world's largest cannabis dispensary|last=Chen|first=Angela|date=2018-11-15|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact of growth on water supply ===
A growing population means the Las Vegas Valley used 1.2 billion gallons more water in 2014 than in 2011. Although water conservation efforts implemented in the wake of a 2002 drought have had some success, local [[Water footprint|water consumption]] remains 30 percent more than in Los Angeles, and over three times that of San Francisco metropolitan area residents. The [[Southern Nevada Water Authority]] is building a $1.4 billion tunnel and pumping station to bring water from [[Lake Mead]], has purchased water rights throughout Nevada, and has planned a controversial $3.2 billion [[Water transportation|pipeline]] across half the state. By law, the Las Vegas Water Service District &quot;may deny any request for a water commitment or request for a water connection if the District has an inadequate supply of water.&quot; However, limiting growth on the basis of inadequate water supply has been unpopular with the casino and building industries.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The [[Las Vegas Academy|Las Vegas Academy of International Studies, Performing and Visual Arts]] is a [[Grammy]] award-winning [[magnet school]] located in [[downtown Las Vegas]]. The [[Smith Center for the Performing Arts]] is situated downtown in [[Symphony Park]] and hosts various Broadway shows and other artistic performances. 

Las Vegas has earned the moniker &quot;Gambling Capital of the World&quot;, as the city currently has the largest strip of land-based casinos in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vegasmobilecasino.co.uk/las-vegas-gambling-capital-of-the-world|title=Las Vegas Gambling Capital|publisher=vegasmobilecasino.co.uk|accessdate=September 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parks and recreation==
Las Vegas has 68 parks. The city owns the land for, but does not operate, four golf courses: Angel Park Golf Club, Desert Pines Golf Club, Durango Hills Golf Club, and the Las Vegas Municipal Golf Course. It is also responsible for 123 playgrounds, 23 softball fields, 10 football fields, 44 soccer fields, 10 dog parks, six community centers, four senior centers, 109 skates parks, six swimming pools, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegasnevada.gov/Find/parks_facilities.htm |title=City of Las Vegas – Find Parks and Facilities |publisher=Lasvegasnevada.gov |accessdate=January 10, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109114805/http://www.lasvegasnevada.gov/find/parks_facilities.htm |archive-date=January 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}
[[File:Lasvegasnewcityhall.jpg|thumb|[[Las Vegas City Hall]] in downtown Las Vegas]]
The city of Las Vegas government operates as a [[council–manager government]]. The Mayor sits as a Council member-at-large and presides over all of the [[city council]] meetings. In the event that the Mayor cannot preside over a City Council meeting, the Mayor Pro-Tem is the [[Chairman|presiding officer]] of the meeting until such time as the Mayor returns to his/her seat. The City Manager is responsible for the administration and the day-to-day operations of all [[municipal services]] and city departments. The City Manager maintains intergovernmental relationships with federal, state, county and other local governments.

Much of the Las Vegas metropolitan area is split into neighboring incorporated cities or unincorporated communities. Approximately 700,000 people live in unincorporated areas governed by [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]], and another 465,000 live in incorporated cities such as [[North Las Vegas, Nevada|North Las Vegas]], [[Henderson, Nevada|Henderson]] and [[Boulder City, Nevada|Boulder City]].

Inter-city bus service to and from Las Vegas is provided by [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]], [[BoltBus]], [[Orange Belt Stages]], [[Tufesa]], and several smaller carriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kfhgroup.com/aibra/Tables/tables.htm|title=AIBRA – Nevada}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amtrak]] trains have not served Las Vegas since the service via the ''[[Desert Wind]]'' at [[Las Vegas station (Nevada)|Las Vegas station]] was discontinued in 1997, but [[Amtrak California]] operates [[Thruway Motorcoach]] dedicated service between the city and its passenger rail stations in [[Bakersfield (Amtrak station)|Bakersfield, California]], as well as [[Los Angeles Union Station]] via [[Harvey House (Barstow, California)|Barstow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California-Train and Thruway service|url=http://www.amtrak.com/ccurl/158/578/California-Thruway-Map-2012.pdf|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Union Pacific Railroad]] is the only [[Class I railroad]] providing rail freight service to the city. Until 1997, the Amtrak ''Desert Wind'' train service ran through Las Vegas using the Union Pacific Railroad tracks.

A [[bus rapid transit]] link in Las Vegas called the Strip &amp; Downtown Express (previously ACE Gold Line&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/aug/17/lawsuit-prompts-rtc-drop-ace-name-bus-lines/ |title=Lawsuit prompts RTC to drop 'ACE' name from bus lines |author=Green, Steve |date=August 17, 2011 |work=Las Vegas Sun |accessdate=March 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) with limited stops and frequent service was launched in March 2010, and connects downtown Las Vegas, the Strip and the Las Vegas Convention Center.

In 2016, 77.1 percent of working Las Vegas residents (those living in the city, but not necessarily working in the city) commuted by driving alone. About 11 percent commuted via carpool, 3.9 percent used public transportation, and 1.4 percent walked. About 2.3 percent of Las Vegas commuters used all other forms of transportation, including taxi, bicycle, and motorcycle. About 4.3 of working Las Vegas residents worked at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Census Reporter|title=Means of Transportation to Work by Age|accessdate=May 6, 2018|url=https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B08101&amp;geo_ids=16000US3240000&amp;primary_geo_id=16000US3240000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, 10.2 percent of city of Las Vegas households were without a car, which increased slightly to 10.5 percent in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Las Vegas averaged 1.63 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8 per household.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Car Ownership in U.S. Cities Data and Map|journal=Governing|url=http://www.governing.com/gov-data/car-ownership-numbers-of-vehicles-by-city-map.html|accessdate=May 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With some exceptions, including [[Las Vegas Boulevard]], [[Nevada State Route 582|Boulder Highway (SR 582)]] and [[Nevada State Route 599|Rancho Drive (SR 599)]], the majority of surface streets in Las Vegas are laid out in a grid along [[Public Land Survey System]] [[section line]]s. Many are maintained by the [[Nevada Department of Transportation]] as [[state highway]]s. The street numbering system is divided by the following streets:

* Westcliff Drive, [[U.S. Route 95 in Nevada|US 95 Expressway]], [[Fremont Street]] and [[Charleston Boulevard]] divide the north–south block numbers from west to east.
* [[Las Vegas Boulevard]] divides the east–west streets from the [[Las Vegas Strip]] to near the Stratosphere, then Main Street becomes the dividing line from the Stratosphere to the North Las Vegas border, after which the Goldfield Street alignment divides east and west.
* On the east side of Las Vegas, block numbers between [[Charleston Boulevard]] and Washington Avenue are different along Nellis Boulevard, which is the eastern border of the city limits.

Interstates 15, 515, and US 95 lead out of the city in four directions. Two major freeways – [[Interstate 15 in Nevada|Interstate 15]] and [[Interstate 515]]/[[U.S. Route 95 (Nevada)|U.S. Route 95]] – cross in downtown Las Vegas. I-15 connects Las Vegas to Los Angeles, and heads northeast to and beyond [[Salt Lake City]]. I-515 goes southeast to [[Henderson, Nevada|Henderson]], beyond which [[US 93 (NV)|US 93]] continues over the [[Mike O'Callaghan–Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge]] towards [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. US 95 connects the city to northwestern Nevada, including [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]] and [[Reno, NV|Reno]]. US 93 splits from I-15 northeast of Las Vegas and goes north through the eastern part of the state, serving [[Ely, Nevada|Ely]] and [[Wells, Nevada|Wells]]. US 95 heads south from US 93 near Henderson through far eastern California. A [[Las Vegas Beltway|partial beltway]] has been built, consisting of [[Interstate 215 (Nevada)|Interstate 215]] on the south and [[Clark County 215]] on the west and north. Other radial routes include [[SR 160 (NV)|Blue Diamond Road (SR 160)]] to [[Pahrump, Nevada|Pahrump]] and [[SR 147 (NV)|Lake Mead Boulevard (SR 147)]] to [[Lake Mead]].

The '''Duchy of Schleswig''' ({{lang-da|Hertugdømmet Slesvig}}; {{lang-de|Herzogtum Schleswig}}; [[Low German]]: ''Hartogdom Sleswig''; [[North Frisian language|North Frisian]]: ''Härtochduum Slaswik'') was a [[duchy]] in [[Southern Jutland]] (''Sønderjylland'') covering the area between about 60&amp;nbsp;km (35 miles) north and 70&amp;nbsp;km (45 miles) south of the current border between [[Germany]] and [[Denmark]]. The territory has been divided between the two countries since 1920, with [[South Jutland County|Northern Schleswig]] in Denmark and [[Southern Schleswig]] in Germany. The region is also called '''Sleswick''' in English.

== History ==
[[File:AreasSettlementSchleswig-HolsteinText.png|thumb|right|Germanic and Slavonic settlement areas in Schleswig/Southern Jutland and Holstein (from 800 to 1100)]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Schleswig interreg.gif|right|thumb|240px|The contemporary transnational ''[[Euroregion]]'' [[Sønderjylland]]-Schleswig covers most of historical Schleswig.]] --&gt;
[[File:Folkesprogene i Hertugdømmet Slesvig.png|thumb|right|240px|[[Language shift]] in the 19th century in Southern Schleswig]]
From early medieval times, the area's significance lay in being the buffer province of Scandinavia and the Danish Realm towards the powerful [[Holy Roman Empire]] to the south, as well as being a transit area for the transfer of goods between the [[North Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea]], connecting the trade route through [[Russia]] with the trade routes along the [[Rhine]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast (see also [[Kiel Canal]]).

===Early history===
Roman sources place the homeland of the tribe of [[Jutes]] north of the river [[Eider River|Eider]] and that of the [[Angles]] south of it. The Angles in turn bordered the neighbouring [[Saxons]]. By the early Middle Ages, the region was inhabited by three groups:
*[[Danes]] (including assimilated [[Jutes]]{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}), who lived north of the [[Danevirke]] and the [[Eckernförde Bay]],
*[[North Frisians]], who lived in most of [[North Frisia]], including on the [[North Frisian Islands]], and
*[[Saxons]] (including [[Germanized]] [[Wagrians]] and [[Wends]]), who lived in the area south of the Danes and the Frisians.

During the 14th century, the population on [[Schwansen]] began to speak Low German alongside Danish,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Treschow Hanson: ''Reise durch einen Theil von Sachsen und Dänemark'', Altona 1813, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; but otherwise the ethno-linguistic borders remained remarkably stable until around 1800, with the exception of the population in the towns that became increasingly German from the 14th century onwards.

During the early [[Viking Age]], [[Haithabu]] – Scandinavia's biggest trading centre – was located in this region, which is also the location of the interlocking fortifications known as the [[Danevirke|''Danewerk'' or ''Danevirke'']]. Its construction, and in particular its great expansion around 737, has been interpreted as an indication of the emergence of a unified Danish state.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelsen, Karsten Kjer, &quot;Politikens bog om Danmarks oldtid&quot;, Politikens Forlag (1. bogklubudgave), 2002, {{ISBN|87-00-69328-6}}, pp. 122-123 {{in lang|da}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1931, scientists of the [[National Museum of Denmark]] announced that they had unearthed eighteen Viking graves with the remains of eighteen men in them. The discovery came during excavations in Schleswig. The skeletons indicated that the men were bigger proportioned than twentieth-century Danish men. Each of the graves was laid out from east to west. Researchers surmised that the bodies were entombed in wooden coffins originally, but only the iron nails remained.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Viking Find Reported&quot;, ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 17, 1931, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the [[Early Middle Ages]], Schleswig formed part of the historical [[Lands of Denmark]] as Denmark unified out of a number of petty chiefdoms in the 8th to 10th centuries in the wake of Viking expansion.

The southern boundary of Denmark in the region of the [[Eider River]] and the Danevirke was a source of continuous dispute. The [[Treaty of Heiligen]] was signed in 811 between the Danish [[King Hemming]] and [[Charlemagne]], by which the border was established at the Eider. During the 10th century, there were several wars between [[East Francia]] and Denmark. In 1027, [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] and [[Canute the Great]] again fixed their mutual border at the Eider.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers Konversationslexikon, 4th edition (1885-90), entry: &quot;Eider&quot;  [http://susi.e-technik.uni-ulm.de:8080/Meyers2/seite/werk/meyers/band/5/seite/0369/meyers_b5_s0369.html] {{in lang|de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1115, King [[Niels of Denmark|Niels]] created his nephew [[Canute Lavard]] – a son of his predecessor [[Eric I of Denmark|Eric I]] – [[Earl]] of Schleswig, a title used for only a short time before the recipient began to style himself [[Duke]].&lt;ref&gt;Danmarkshistoriens hvornår skete det, Copenhagen: Politiken, 1966, p. 65 {{in lang|da}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1230s, Southern Jutland (the Duchy of Slesvig) was allotted as an [[appanage]] to [[Abel of Denmark|Abel Valdemarsen]], Canute's great-grandson, a younger son of [[Valdemar II of Denmark]]. Abel, having wrested the Danish throne to himself for a brief period, left his duchy to his sons and their successors, who pressed claims to the throne of Denmark for much of the next century, so that the Danish kings were at odds with their cousins, the dukes of Slesvig. Feuds and marital alliances brought the Abel dynasty into a close connection with the German [[Holstein-Glückstadt|Duchy of Holstein]] by the 15th century. The latter was a [[fief]] subordinate to the [[Holy Roman Empire]], while Schleswig remained a Danish fief.  &lt;!-- more material is needed to properly describe the dispute between the Danish kings and the Schauenburger dynasty --&gt; These dual loyalties were to become a main root of the dispute between the German states and Denmark in the 19th century, when the ideas of [[romantic nationalism]] and the [[nation-state]] gained popular support.

===Early modern times===&lt;!-- this section title is linked from other articles ---&gt;
The title of [[Duke]] of Schleswig was inherited in 1460 by the hereditary [[List of Danish monarchs|kings]] of Norway, who were also regularly elected kings of Denmark simultaneously, and their sons (unlike Denmark, which was not hereditary). This was an anomaly{{dubious|date=October 2018}} – a king holding a ducal title of which he as king was the fount and [[liege lord]]. The title and anomaly survived presumably because it was already co-regally held by the king's sons. {{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Between 1544 and 1713/20, the ducal reign had become a condominium, with the royal [[House of Oldenburg]] and its cadet branch [[House of Holstein-Gottorp]] jointly holding the stake. A third branch in the condominium, the short-lived House of [[Schleswig-Holstein-Haderslev|Haderslev]], was already extinct in 1580 by the time of [[John II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Haderslev|John the Elder]].

Following the [[Protestant Reformation]], when Latin was replaced as the medium of church service by the vernacular languages, the [[diocese of Schleswig]] was divided and an autonomous [[archdeaconry]] of Haderslev created. On the west coast, the Danish [[diocese of Ribe]] ended about 5&amp;nbsp;km (3 miles) north of the present border. This created a new cultural dividing line in the duchy because German was used for church services and teaching in the diocese of Schleswig and Danish was used in the diocese of Ribe and the archdeaconry of Haderslev. This line corresponds remarkably closely with the present border.

In the 17th century a series of wars between Denmark and Sweden—which Denmark lost—devastated the region economically. However, the nobility responded with a new agricultural system that restored prosperity. In the period 1600 to 1800 the region experienced the growth of manorialism of the sort common in the rye-growing regions of eastern Germany. The manors were large holdings with the work done by feudal peasant farmers. They specialized in high quality dairy products. Feudal lordship was combined with technical modernization, and the distinction between [[unfree labour]] and paid work was often vague.  The feudal system was gradually abolished in the late 18th century, starting with the crown lands in 1765 and later the estates of the nobility. In 1805 all serfdom was abolished and land tenure reforms allowed former peasants to own their own farms.&lt;ref&gt;Carsten Porskrog Rasmussen, &quot;Innovative Feudalism. The development of dairy farming and Koppelwirtschaft on manors in Schleswig-Holstein in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,&quot; ''Agricultural History Review'' (2010) 58#2 pp 172-190.&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century and the rise of nationalism===
From around 1800 to 1840, the Danish-speaking population on the [[Angeln]] peninsula between Schleswig and Flensburg began to switch to Low German and in the same period many North Frisians also switched to Low German. This linguistic change created a new de facto dividing line between German and Danish speakers north of [[Tønder]] and south of Flensburg.
From around 1830, large segments of the population began to identify with either German or Danish nationality and mobilized politically. In Denmark, the National Liberal Party used the Schleswig Question as part of their agitation and demanded that the Duchy be incorporated into the Danish kingdom under the slogan &quot;Denmark to the Eider&quot;. This caused a conflict between Denmark and the German states over Schleswig and [[Holstein]], which led to the [[Schleswig-Holstein Question]] of the 19th century. When the National Liberals came to power in Denmark in 1848, it provoked an uprising of ethnic Germans who supported Schleswig's ties with Holstein. This led to the [[First War of Schleswig]]. Denmark was victorious and the Prussian troops were ordered to pull out of Schleswig and Holstein following the [[London Protocol (1852)|London Protocol of 1852]].

Denmark again attempted to integrate Schleswig by creating a new common constitution (the so-called [[History of Schleswig-Holstein#The November Constitution|November Constitution]]) for Denmark and Schleswig in 1863, but the [[German Confederation]], led by Prussia and Austria, defeated the Danes in the [[Second War of Schleswig]] the following year. Prussia and Austria then assumed administration of Schleswig and Holstein respectively under the [[Gastein Convention]] of 14 August 1865. However, tensions between the two powers culminated in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866. In the [[Peace of Prague (1866)|Peace of Prague]], the victorious Prussians annexed both Schleswig and Holstein, creating the [[province of Schleswig-Holstein]]. Provision for the cession of northern Schleswig to Denmark was made pending a popular vote in favour of this. In 1878, however, Austria went back on this provision, and Denmark recognized in a Treaty of 1907 with Germany that, by the agreement between Austria and Prussia, the frontier between Prussia and Denmark had finally been settled.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;&gt;{{Cite EB1922|wstitle=Schleswig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 1900===
[[File:SchleswigSlesvig18642016.png|thumb|right|240px|Schleswig/Slesvig with present-day administrative borders]]
The [[Treaty of Versailles]] provided for [[1920 Schleswig plebiscites|plebiscites]] to determine the allegiance of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Collier's|wstitle=Schleswig (duchy)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, two [[referendum|referenda]] were held in 1920, resulting in the partition of the region. [[South Jutland County|Northern Schleswig]] voted by a majority of 75% to join Denmark, whereas Central Schleswig voted by a majority of 80% to remain part of Germany. In Southern Schleswig, no referendum was held, as the likely outcome was apparent. The name [[Southern Schleswig]] is now used for all of German Schleswig. This decision left substantial minorities on both sides of the new border.

Following the Second World War, a substantial part of the German population in Southern Schleswig changed their nationality and declared themselves as Danish. This change was caused by a number of factors, most importantly the German defeat and an influx of a large number of refugees [[Republikflucht|from eastern Germany]], whose culture and appearance differed from the local Germans, who were mostly descendants of Danish families who had changed their nationality in the 19th century. The change created a temporary Danish majority in the region and a demand for a new referendum from the Danish population in South Schleswig and some Danish politicians, including prime minister [[Knud Kristensen]]. However, the majority in the Danish parliament refused to support a referendum in South Schleswig, fearing that the &quot;new Danes&quot; were not genuine in their change of nationality. This proved to be the case and, from 1948 the Danish population began to shrink again. By the early 1950s, it had nevertheless stabilised at a level four times higher than the pre-war number.

In the [[Copenhagen-Bonn declaration]] of 1955, West Germany (later Germany as a whole) and Denmark promised to uphold the rights of each other's minority population. Today, both parts co-operate as a [[Euroregion]], despite a national border dividing the former duchy. As Denmark and Germany are both part of the [[Schengen Area]], for many years, there were no controls at the border. However, in response to the 2016 [[European migrant crisis]], border checks were reintroduced.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.politiko.dk/nyheder/regeringen-indfoerer-midlertidig-graensekontrol-til-tyskland&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name and naming dispute==
[[File:ForbudSønderjylland1895.jpg|thumb|The term &quot;Sønderjylland&quot; was forbidden by the Prussians in 1895. The picture shows two girls in costumes of the islands Föhr and Als before the Dannevirke]]
[[File:Sonderjylland1918.jpg|thumb|240px|upright=1.6|Danish Map of Southern Jutland (1918)]]
In the 19th century, there was a naming dispute concerning the use of ''Schleswig'' or ''Slesvig'' and ''Sønderjylland'' ([[Southern Jutland]]). Originally the duchy was called ''Sønderjylland'' (Southern Jutland) but in the late 14th century the name of the city Slesvig (now [[Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig]]) started to be used for the whole territory. The term &quot;Sønderjylland&quot; was hardly used between the 16th and 19th centuries, and in this period the name &quot;Schleswig&quot; had no special political connotations. But around 1830, some Danes started to re-introduce the archaic term Sønderjylland to emphasize the area's history before its association with Holstein and its connection with the rest of [[Jutland]]. Its revival and widespread use in the 19th century therefore had a clear Danish nationalist connotation of laying a claim to the territory and objecting to the German claims. &quot;Olsen's Map&quot;, published by the Danish cartographer Olsen{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} in the 1830s, used this term, arousing a storm of protests by the duchy's German inhabitants. Even though many Danish nationalists, such as the National Liberal ideologue and [[agitator]] [[Orla Lehmann]], used the name &quot;Schleswig&quot;, it began to assume a clear German nationalist character in the mid 19th century – especially when included in the combined term &quot;Schleswig-Holstein&quot;. A central element of the German nationalistic claim was the insistence on Schleswig and Holstein being a single, indivisible entity. Since Holstein was legally part of the German Confederation, and ethnically entirely German with no Danish population, use of that name implied that both provinces should belong to Germany and that their connection with Denmark should be weakened or altogether severed.

After the German conquest in 1864, the term Sønderjylland became increasingly dominant among the Danish population, even though most Danes still had no objection to the use of &quot;Schleswig&quot; as such (it is etymologically of Danish origin) and many of them still used it themselves in its Danish version &quot;Slesvig&quot;. An example is the founding of [[De Nordslesvigske Landboforeninger]] (The North Schleswig Farmers Association). In 1866 Schleswig and Holstein were legally merged into the Prussian [[province of Schleswig-Holstein]]. 
The naming dispute was resolved with the [[1920 Schleswig plebiscites|1920 plebiscites and partition]], each side applying its preferred name to the part of the territory remaining in its possession – though both terms can, in principle, still refer to the entire region. Northern Schleswig was, after the 1920 plebiscites, officially named the Southern Jutland districts (''de sønderjyske landsdele''), while Southern Schleswig then remained a part of the Prussian province, which became the [[States of Germany|German state]] of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] in 1946.

      <text bytes="24349" xml:space="preserve">'''Biodefense''' refers to measures to restore [[biosecurity]] to a group of organisms who are, or may be, subject to [[biological agent|biological threats]] or infectious diseases. Biodefense is frequently discussed in the context of [[biological warfare|biowar]] or [[bioterrorism]], and is generally considered a military or [[emergency response]] term.

Biodefense applies to two distinct target populations: civilian non-combatant and military combatant (troops in the field). Protection of water supplies and food supplies are often a critical part of biodefense.

==Military==

===Troops in the field===
[[United States biological defense program|Military biodefense in the United States]] began with the [[United States Army Medical Unit]] (USAMU) at [[Fort Detrick]], [[Maryland]], in 1956. (In contrast to the [[United States Army Biological Warfare Laboratories|U.S. Army Biological Warfare Laboratories]] [1943–1969], also at Fort Detrick, the USAMU's mission was purely to develop defensive measures against [[bio-agents]], as opposed to weapons development.) The USAMU was disestablished in 1969 and succeeded by today's [[USAMRIID|United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID)]].

The [[United States Department of Defense]] (or &quot;DoD&quot;) has focused since at least 1998 on the development and application of vaccine-based biodefenses.  In a July 2001 report commissioned by the DoD, the &quot;DoD-critical products&quot; were stated as vaccines against [[anthrax]] (AVA and Next Generation), [[smallpox]], [[Bubonic plague|plague]], [[tularemia]], [[botulinum]], [[ricin]], and [[equine encephalitis]].  Note that two of these targets are toxins (botulinum and ricin) while the remainder are infectious agents.

===Role of public health and disease surveillance===

It is important to note that all of the classical and modern biological weapons organisms are animal diseases, the only exception being smallpox. Thus, in any use of biological weapons, it is highly likely that animals will become ill either simultaneously with, or perhaps earlier than humans.

Indeed, in the largest biological weapons accident known–the anthrax outbreak in Sverdlovsk (now [[Yekaterinburg]]) in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1979, sheep became ill with anthrax as far as 200 kilometers from the release point of the organism from a military facility in the southeastern portion of the city (known as [[Compound 19]] and still off limits to visitors today, see [[Sverdlovsk anthrax leak]]).

Thus, a robust surveillance system involving human clinicians and veterinarians may identify a bioweapons attack early in the course of an epidemic, permitting the prophylaxis of disease in the vast majority of people (and/or animals) exposed but not yet ill.

For example, in the case of anthrax, it is likely that by 24–36 hours after an attack, some small percentage of individuals (those with compromised immune system or who had received a large dose of the organism due to proximity to the release point) will become ill with classical symptoms and signs (including a virtually unique [[chest X-ray]] finding, often recognized by public health officials if they receive timely reports). By making these data available to local public health officials in real time, most models of anthrax epidemics indicate that more than 80% of an exposed population can receive antibiotic treatment before becoming symptomatic, and thus avoid the moderately high mortality of the disease.

===Identification of bioweapons===

The goal of biodefense is to integrate the sustained efforts of the national and homeland security, medical, public health, intelligence, diplomatic, and law enforcement communities. Health care providers and public health officers are among the first lines of defense. In some countries private, local, and provincial (state) capabilities are being augmented by and coordinated with federal assets, to provide layered defenses against biological weapons attacks. During the [[first Gulf War]] the United Nations activated a biological and chemical response team, [[Task Force Scorpio]], to respond to any potential use of weapons of mass destruction on civilians.

The traditional approach toward protecting agriculture, food, and water: focusing on the natural or unintentional introduction of a disease is being strengthened by focused efforts to address current and anticipated future biological weapons threats that may be deliberate, multiple, and repetitive.

The growing threat of biowarfare agents and bioterrorism has led to the development of specific field tools that perform on-the-spot analysis and identification of encountered suspect materials. One such technology, being developed by researchers from the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL), employs a &quot;sandwich immunoassay&quot;, in which fluorescent dye-labeled antibodies aimed at specific [[pathogen]]s are attached to silver and gold nanowires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news74433040.html Physorg.com, &quot;Encoded Metallic Nanowires Reveal Bioweapons&quot;, 12:50 EST, August 10, 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]] (NIAID) also participates in the identification and prevention of biowarfare and first released a strategy for biodefense in 2002, periodically releasing updates as new pathogens are becoming topics of discussion. Within this list of strategies, responses for specific infectious agents are provided, along with the classification of these agents. NIAID provides countermeasures after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security details which pathogens hold the most threat.

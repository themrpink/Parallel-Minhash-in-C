Brooklyn features extensive [[public transport|public transit]]. Nineteen [[New York City Subway]] services, including the [[Franklin Avenue Shuttle]], traverse the borough. Approximately 92.8% of Brooklyn residents traveling to Manhattan use the subway, despite the fact some neighborhoods like [[Flatlands, Brooklyn|Flatlands]] and [[Marine Park, Brooklyn|Marine Park]] are poorly served by subway service. Major stations, out of the [[List of New York City Subway stations in Brooklyn|170 currently in Brooklyn]], include:
* [[Atlantic Avenue&amp;nbsp;– Barclays Center]]
* [[Broadway Junction (New York City Subway)|Broadway Junction]]
* [[DeKalb Avenue (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|DeKalb Avenue]]
* [[Jay Street&amp;nbsp;– MetroTech]]

Proposed New York City Subway lines never built include a line along Nostrand or Utica Avenues to Marine Park,&lt;ref&gt;nycsubway.org—[http://nycsubway.org/wiki/IND_Second_System_-_1929_Plan IND Second System 1929 Plan]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a subway line to [[Spring Creek, Brooklyn|Spring Creek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://secondavenuesagas.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/1968expansionlarge.jpg |title=1968 NYCTA Expansion Plans (Picture) |publisher=Second Avenue Sagas }} Retrieved December 6, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejoekorner.com/lines/progforaction.htm Program for Action maps] from thejoekorner.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooklyn was once served by [[list of streetcar lines in Brooklyn|an extensive network of streetcars]], but many were replaced by the [[List of bus routes in Brooklyn|public bus network]] that covers the entire borough. There is also daily express bus service into Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite NYC bus map|B}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York's famous yellow cabs also provide transportation in Brooklyn, although they are less numerous in the borough. There are three commuter rail stations in Brooklyn: [[East New York (LIRR station)|East New York]], [[Nostrand Avenue (LIRR station)|Nostrand Avenue]], and [[Atlantic Terminal]], the terminus of the [[Atlantic Branch]] of the [[Long Island Rail Road]]. The terminal is near the [[Atlantic Avenue&amp;nbsp;– Barclays Center]] subway station, with ten connecting subway services.

In February 2015, Mayor [[Bill de Blasio]] announced that the city government would begin a citywide ferry service called [[NYC Ferry]] to extend ferry transportation to communities in the city that have been traditionally underserved by public transit.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/16/nyregion/new-york-city-ferry-service.html|title=De Blasio's $325 Million Ferry Push: Rides to 5 Boroughs, at Subway Price|last=Mcgeehan|first=Patrick|date=June 15, 2016|access-date=June 28, 2016|issn=0362-4331|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nbcny-hornblower&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/New-York-City-Citywide-Ferry-Service-Hornblower-2017-372257472.html|title=New York City's Ferry Service Set to Launch in 2017|work=NBC New York|access-date=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ferry opened in May 2017,&lt;ref name=&quot;nydailynews.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/newswires/new-york/nyc-launches-ferry-service-queens-east-river-routes-article-1.3122046|title=NYC launches ferry service with Queens, East River routes|date=May 1, 2017|website=Daily News|location=New York|agency=Associated Press|access-date=May 1, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501154444/http://www.nydailynews.com/newswires/new-york/nyc-launches-ferry-service-queens-east-river-routes-article-1.3122046|archivedate=May 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:14&quot;/&gt; with the Bay Ridge ferry serving southwestern Brooklyn and the [[East River Ferry]] serving northwestern Brooklyn.

Most of the [[limited-access road|limited-access expressways and parkways]] are in the western and southern sections of Brooklyn, where the borough's two [[Interstate Highway System|interstate highways]] are located; [[Interstate 278]], which uses the [[Gowanus Expressway]] and the [[Brooklyn-Queens Expressway]], traverses [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn|Sunset Park]] and [[Brooklyn Heights]], while [[Interstate 478]] is an unsigned route designation for the [[Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel]], which connects to Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;Shilling, Erik (January 1, 2018) [https://jalopnik.com/all-52-highways-and-parkways-in-the-new-york-city-a-1821506061 &quot;All (?) 52 Highways and Parkways in the New York City Area, Ranked&quot;], ''Jalopnik''. Retrieved February 17, 2020.&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent roadways are the [[Prospect Expressway]] ([[New York State Route 27]]), the [[Belt Parkway]], and the [[Jackie Robinson Parkway]] (formerly the Interborough Parkway). Planned expressways that were never built include the Bushwick Expressway, an extension of [[I-78]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nycroads.com/roads/bushwick/ |title=Bushwick Expressway (I-78, unbuilt) |publisher=Nycroads.com |access-date=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Cross-Brooklyn Expressway, I-878.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nycroads.com/roads/cross-brooklyn/ |title=Cross Brooklyn Expressway (I-878, unbuilt) |publisher=Nycroads.com |access-date=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major thoroughfares include [[Atlantic Avenue (New York City)|Atlantic Avenue]], [[Fourth Avenue (Brooklyn)|Fourth Avenue]], 86th Street, [[Kings Highway (Brooklyn)|Kings Highway]], [[Bay Parkway (Brooklyn)|Bay Parkway]], [[Ocean Parkway (Brooklyn)|Ocean Parkway]], [[Eastern Parkway]], [[Linden Boulevard]], [[McGuinness Boulevard]], [[Flatbush Avenue]], [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Brooklyn)|Pennsylvania Avenue]], and [[Nostrand Avenue]].

Much of Brooklyn has only named streets, but [[Park Slope]], [[Bay Ridge]], [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn|Sunset Park]], [[Bensonhurst]], and [[Borough Park, Brooklyn|Borough Park]] and the other western sections have [[List of numbered Brooklyn streets|numbered streets]] running approximately northwest to southeast, and numbered avenues going approximately northeast to southwest. East of Dahill Road, lettered avenues (like Avenue M) run east and west, and numbered streets have the prefix &quot;East&quot;. South of Avenue O, related numbered streets west of Dahill Road use the &quot;West&quot; designation. This set of numbered streets ranges from West 37th Street to East 108 Street, and the avenues range from A–Z with names substituted for some of them in some neighborhoods (notably Albemarle, Beverley, Cortelyou, Dorchester, Ditmas, Foster, Farragut, Glenwood, Quentin). Numbered streets prefixed by &quot;North&quot; and &quot;South&quot; in Williamsburg, and &quot;Bay&quot;, &quot;Beach&quot;, &quot;Brighton&quot;, &quot;Plumb&quot;, &quot;Paerdegat&quot; or &quot;Flatlands&quot; along the southern and southwestern waterfront are loosely based on the old grids of the original towns of Kings County that eventually consolidated to form Brooklyn. These names often reflect the bodies of water or beaches around them, such as [[Plumb Beach]] or [[Paerdegat Basin]].

Brooklyn is connected to Manhattan by three bridges, the [[Brooklyn Bridge|Brooklyn]], [[Manhattan Bridge|Manhattan]], and [[Williamsburg Bridge]]s; a vehicular tunnel, the [[Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel]] (also known as the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel); and several subway tunnels. The [[Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge]] links Brooklyn with the more suburban borough of [[Staten Island]]. Though much of its border is on land, Brooklyn shares several water crossings with [[Queens]], including the [[Pulaski Bridge]], the [[Greenpoint Avenue Bridge]], the [[Kosciuszko Bridge]] (part of the [[Brooklyn-Queens Expressway]]), and the [[Grand Street Bridge]], all of which carry traffic over [[Newtown Creek]], and the [[Marine Parkway Bridge]] connecting Brooklyn to the [[Rockaway Peninsula]].

===Waterways===
Brooklyn was long a major shipping port, especially at the [[Brooklyn Army Terminal]] and [[Bush Terminal]] in [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn|Sunset Park]]. Most container ship cargo operations have shifted to the New Jersey side of New York Harbor, while the [[Brooklyn Cruise Terminal]] in [[Red Hook, Brooklyn|Red Hook]] is a focal point for New York's growing cruise industry. The ''[[Queen Mary 2]]'', one of the [[List of largest cruise ships|world's largest ocean liners]], was designed specifically to fit under the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, the longest suspension bridge in the United States. She makes regular ports of call at the Red Hook terminal on her transatlantic crossings from [[Southampton, England]].&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;

The [[East River Ferry]] serves points in [[Lower Manhattan]], [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]], [[Long Island City]], and northwestern Brooklyn via its East River route. The South Brooklyn and Rockaway routes serve southwestern Brooklyn before terminating in lower Manhattan. Ferries to Coney Island are also planned.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; [[NY Waterway]] offers tours and charters. [[SeaStreak]] also offers a weekday ferry service between the [[Brooklyn Army Terminal]] and the Manhattan ferry slips at [[Pier 11/Wall Street]] downtown and [[East 34th Street Ferry Landing]] in midtown. A [[Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel]], originally proposed in the 1920s as a core project for the then-new [[Port Authority of New York]] is again being studied and discussed as a way to ease freight movements across a large swath of the metropolitan area.{{wide image|Manhattan Bridge Panorama.JPG|1500px|alt= Manhattan Bridge|Manhattan Bridge seen from [[Brooklyn Bridge Park]].}}

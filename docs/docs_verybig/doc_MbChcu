Kelly described his songwriting as &quot;a scavenging art, a desperate act. For me it's a bit from here, a bit from there, fumbling around, never quite knowing what you're doing ... Song writing is like a way of feeling connected to mystery.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jj&quot; /&gt; He has resisted the label of 'storyteller' and insists that his songs are not strictly autobiographical; &quot;they come from imagining someone in a particular situation. Sometimes a sequence of events happens which makes it more a story, but other times it's just that situation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;apra02&quot; /&gt; Sometimes the same character is found in different songs, such as in &quot;To Her Door&quot;, &quot;Love Never Runs on Time&quot;, and &quot;How to Make Gravy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;apra02&quot; /&gt;

Kelly has also provided songs for many other artists, tailoring them to their particular vocal range. ''Women at the Well'' (2002) had 14 female artists record his songs in tribute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howl&quot; /&gt; According to Kelly, he adapted his song &quot;Foggy Highway&quot; for Renée Geyer because &quot;I admired her deep soul singing, ferocious and vulnerable ... When I heard the finished version ... the hairs rose up on the back of my neck.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;KellyGravy94&quot;/&gt; Kelly and The Stormwater Boys recorded it in a [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] style as the title track for the 2005 album ''Foggy Highway''.&lt;ref name=&quot;KellyGravy166&quot;/&gt; [[Divinyls]]' lead singer [[Christina Amphlett]] recorded &quot;Before Too Long&quot;—she was attracted by the lyrics—she interpreted the song's narrator as being a stalker, and provided a female perspective in a darkly menacing manner à-la ''[[Fatal Attraction]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webb&quot; /&gt;

Kelly has written songs with and for numerous artists, including [[Mick Thomas]], Geyer, [[Kate Ceberano]], Vika and Linda Bull, [[Nick Cave]], [[Nick Barker]], Kasey Chambers, Yothu Yindi, Archie Roach, [[Gyan Evans|Gyan]], [[Monique Brumby]], [[Kelly Willis]], Missy Higgins, and Troy Cassar-Daley.&lt;ref name=&quot;apra02&quot; /&gt; He has described how some songs he writes are suited to other vocal ranges. &quot;Quite often, I'm trying to write a certain kind of song and it's more ambitious than what my voice will get to. That's how I started writing songs with other people in mind&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hillman&quot;/&gt; Kelly and Carmody's &quot;From Little Things Big Things Grow&quot; was analysed by Sydney University's Linguistics professor James R Martin. &quot;[They] render the story as a narrative ... with the familiar Orientation, Complication, Evaluation, Resolution and Coda staging&quot;. Martin finds that Kelly and Carmody made the point that when people exert their rights with support from friends, they may defeat those with prestige.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin&quot;/&gt;

Kelly understands that co-writing with other songwriters lends power to his songs. &quot;You often write songs with collaborators that you would never write by yourself. It's a way of dragging a song out of you that you wouldn't have come up with&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;apra02&quot; /&gt; One of his collaborators, Linda Bull, described Kelly's process: they would start with a simple chat. &quot;We'd just chuck ideas around and he'd pick the best bits. He'd take all the bluntness and crudeness out of it and make it beautiful; that's his magic ... It's conversations that you have {{Sic|every|day}}&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Songline&quot; /&gt; Forster summarised his 2009 review of Kelly's compilation, ''Songs from the South'', with &quot;[his songs] sound easy and approachable ... Then you think: If the songs are so simple and the ideas behind them so clear, why aren't more people writing like Paul Kelly and sounding as good as he does?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Forster&quot; /&gt; In 2010 Carmody and Kelly's &quot;From Little Things Big Things Grow&quot; was added to the [[National Film and Sound Archive]]'s Sounds of Australia Registry.&lt;ref name=&quot;SoundsReg&quot;/&gt;

==Personal life==

Paul Kelly's first marriage (1980–1984) was to Hilary Brown; the couple had a son, Declan, who later worked as a radio presenter on [[3RRR]]'s ''Against the Arctic'' from 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lure&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Songline&quot;/&gt; As of 2007, he was a DJ around Melbourne and played the drums.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hargreaves&quot;/&gt; For ''Paul Kelly: Stories of Me'' Declan recalled his feelings whenever he hears &quot;When I First Met Your Ma&quot;, which describes Kelly's courtship of Hilary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Street 2013&quot;/&gt; Hilary remembered &quot;songs written especially for and about her&quot; but also about other women, she quipped &quot;There are too many girls out there! One for every song!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Street 2013&quot;/&gt;

Kelly's second marriage (1993–2001) was to actress [[Kaarin Fairfax]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mordue1996&quot;/&gt; ''The Monthly''{{'}}s Richard Guilliatt travelled with Kelly, his band and &quot;his new love and future wife, the diminutive&quot; Fairfax on a section of the group's US tour prior to the release of ''Under the Sun''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guilliatt&quot;/&gt; The couple have two daughters, Madeleine (born 1991) and Memphis (born 1993).&lt;ref name=&quot;Lure&quot;/&gt; From 1989 to 1992, Fairfax supplied backing vocals on tracks by Paul Kelly and the Messengers. In 1990, as Mary-Jo Starr, a country music artist, Fairfax released three singles, and an album, ''Too Many Movies''. Memphis Kelly starred alongside her parents in the [[Rachel Perkins]] short film, ''[[One Night the Moon]]'' (2001), for which Paul Kelly composed the score.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lure&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TrovePK&quot;/&gt; After the couple separated in 2001, Madeleine and Memphis stayed with Fairfax, but Kelly maintained contact with his daughters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Songline&quot;/&gt; In 2010 Madeleine and Memphis formed a pop indie trio, Wishful, with Sam Humphrey; they were later joined by Harley Hamer and Caleb Williams. In March 2014, Wishful performed at the [[Port Fairy Folk Festival]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wishful&quot;/&gt;

Kelly was in a relationship with Sian Prior, a journalist, university lecturer and opera singer, from 2002 to 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;Songline&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UniMelb&quot;/&gt; They met when Kelly was interviewed on her ''Sunday Arts'' ABC radio program.&lt;ref name=&quot;Songline&quot;/&gt; Kelly wrote &quot;You're 39, You're Beautiful and You're Mine&quot; for Prior who was already 40 by the time he finished.&lt;ref name=&quot;Songline&quot;/&gt; Prior has played clarinet and provided backing vocals on some of Kelly's songs, as well as with the Stardust Five.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harbour&quot;/&gt; She has performed live with Kelly on several occasions including clarinet on six tracks of his ''A – Z Recordings'' boxed set.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stands&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Quarry&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shedden&quot;/&gt; In his memoir, Kelly credited Prior with inspiring him to give up his long-term heroin addiction, &quot;I got lucky, I met a woman who said: 'It's me or it'. She gave me the number of a counsellor ... I thought about 'it' every day for a long time. Less now&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;KellyGravy79&quot;/&gt; The couple had separated during the making of Kelly's biopic, however the separation is not mentioned and Prior is not interviewed in the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strickland&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Street 2013&quot;/&gt; According to Prior after a date in 2011, &quot;[we] came home. He sat on the bed. 'I've decided I want to be single again,' he told her. 'Yes, I have been with other women.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood&quot;/&gt; The split occurred after she had filmed her interview and &quot;after the breakup, [she] requested the footage not be used. Her presence in Kelly's life is as a footnote in the credits. It's as if she was never there.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood&quot;/&gt;

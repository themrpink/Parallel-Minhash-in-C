A limited number of 7-Eleven locations feature [[filling station|gas station]]s from [[Shell Canada]], [[Petro-Canada]], or [[Esso]]. In November 2005, 7-Eleven started offering the Speak Out Wireless cellphone service in Canada. 7-Eleven locations also featured [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce|CIBC]] [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]s{{emdash}}in June 2012, these machines were replaced with ATMs operated by [[Scotiabank]]. 7-Eleven abandoned the [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], market in December 2009 after selling its six outlets to [[Quickie Convenience Stores]], a regional chain.

In March 2016, 7-Eleven acquired 148 [[Imperial Oil]]-owned Esso gas stations in Alberta and British Columbia for C$2.8&amp;nbsp;billion. Most of their convenience stores were converted to 7-Eleven stores, and they remain supplied by Esso. Some locations were not immediately converted to 7-Eleven, and instead operate under the transitional banner &quot;smartstop 24/7&quot; with their existing store formats, typically inherited from the previous [[On the Run (convenience store)|On the Run]] chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Exciting the Market|url=https://issuu.com/ensembleiq/docs/csnc_mar_19_fa3f064e4361b4/12|journal=Octane|volume=March 2019|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://calgaryherald.com/business/energy/esso-stations-to-sprout-7-eleven-stores-thanks-to-2-8-billion-gas-bar-megadeal|title=Esso stations to sprout 7-Eleven stores thanks to $2.8-billion gas bar megadeal|date=March 9, 2016|work=Calgary Herald|access-date=August 6, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mexico ====

In [[Mexico]], the first 7-Eleven store opened in 1971 in [[Monterrey]] in association with Grupo Chapa (now Iconn) and 7-Eleven, Inc. under the name Super 7. In 1995, Super 7 was renamed to 7-Eleven, which now has 1,835 stores in several areas of the country. When stores are located within classically designed buildings (such as in Centro Histórico buildings) or important landmarks, the storefront logo is displayed in monochrome with gold or silver lettering. The main competitors in Mexico are [[OXXO]] (Femsa), [[Super City (store)|Super City]] (Soriana), and [[Farmacias Guadalajara]], among others.

===== Fuel =====

In the U.S., many 7-Eleven locations used to have filling stations with gasoline distributed by [[Citgo]], which in 1983 was purchased by Southland Corporation. 50% of Citgo was sold in 1986 to [[Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A.]], and the remaining 50% was acquired in 1990. Although Citgo was the predominant partner of 7-Eleven, other oil companies are also co-branded with 7-Eleven, including [[Petrofina|Fina]], [[Exxon]], [[Gulf Oil LP|Gulf]], [[Marathon Oil|Marathon]], [[BP]], [[Shell Oil Company|Shell]], [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] (some former TETCO convenience stores were co-branded with Chevron, and Texaco prior to the 7-Eleven purchase in late 2012), and [[Pennzoil]].

==== Australia ====

The first 7-Eleven in Australia opened on August 24, 1977, in the Melbourne suburb of [[Oakleigh, Victoria]]. The majority of stores are located in metropolitan areas, particularly in central business district areas. Stores in suburban areas often operate as [[petrol station]]s and most are owned and operated as franchises, with a central administration. 7-Eleven bought [[Mobil]]'s remaining Australian petrol stations in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ker |first1=Peter |title=Mobil name goes back on 7-Eleven stations |url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/mobil-name-goes-back-on-7eleven-stations-20140109-30kds.html |access-date=23 October 2020 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |publisher=[[Nine Entertainment Co.]] |date=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; converting them to 7-Eleven outlets, resulting in an immediate and unprecedented overnight major expansion of the brand. In South Australia all Mobil petrol stations were sold to [[Peregrine Corporation]] and branded as [[On the Run (convenience store)|On the Run]] petrol stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.7eleven.com.au/media-centre/article/7-eleven-acquires-mobil-retail-fuels-business|title=7-Eleven Acquires Mobil Retail Fuels Business|access-date=October 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

7-Eleven stores in Australia sell a wide range of items, including daily newspapers, drinks, confectionery, and [[snack food]]s. They sell [[gift card]]s, including three types of pre-paid [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] cards. The chain has partnered with BankWest, placing a BankWest [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] in each of their stores nationwide. Each year on November 7, 7-Eleven promotes &quot;7-Eleven Day&quot; by giving away a free [[Slurpee]] to customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slurpee.com.au/news/view/happy-7-eleven-day |title=Slurpee News: HAPPY 7-ELEVEN DAY! |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130001143/http://www.slurpee.com.au/news/view/happy-7-eleven-day |archive-date=January 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, 7-Eleven announced plans to start operating stores in Western Australia, with 11 stores planned to operate within the first year and a total of 75 stores established within five years. The first store was opened on October 30, 2014 in the city of [[Fremantle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First 7-Eleven in WA to open in October|url=http://www.7eleven.com.au/media-centre/article/first-7-eleven-in-wa-to-open-in-october|website=7-Eleven|publisher=7-Eleven Stores Pty.

===== Wage theft =====

In August 2015, [[Fairfax Media]] and the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'s ''[[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]]'' programme reported on the employment practices of certain 7-Eleven franchisees in Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;smh1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ferguson|first1=Adele|last2=Danckert|first2=Sarah|last3=Klaus|first3=Toft|title=7-Eleven: Investigation exposes shocking exploitation of convenience store workers|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace-relations/7eleven-investigation-exposes-shocking-exploitation-of-convenience-store-workers-20150828-gja276.html|access-date=October 2, 2015|work=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Nine Entertainment Co. |date=August 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=7-Eleven – A sweatshop on every corner|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace-relations/7eleven-a-sweatshop-on-every-corner-20150827-gj8vzn.html|date=August 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation found that many 7-Eleven employees were being underpaid at rates of around [[Australian dollar|A$]]10 to A$14 per hour before tax, well under the legally-required minimum [[Industrial award|award rate]] of A$24.69 per hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;smh1&quot; /&gt;

Franchisees underpaying their staff would typically maintain rosters and pay records that would appear to show the employee being paid the legally-required rate, however these records would in fact only include half of the hours the employee actually worked in a week. Employees would then be paid on the basis of these records, resulting in them effectively being paid half the legally-required rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;smh1&quot; /&gt;

It was also reported that workers were often not paid loadings and [[Public holidays in Australia#Penalty rates|penalty rates]] that they are legally entitled to, for working overtime hours, nights, weekends, and public holidays.&lt;ref name=&quot;smh1&quot; /&gt;

After these reports came to light and received widespread attention, some employees had alleged to Fairfax Media that they had begun to be paid correctly through the 7-Eleven payroll system, however would then be asked by the franchisee to pay back half their wages in cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ferguson|first1=Adele|title=7-Eleven: Workers caught in cashback scam|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace-relations/7eleven-workers-caught-in-cashback-scam-20150907-gjh0kt.html|access-date=October 2, 2015|work=Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Nine Entertainment Co. |date=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 7-Eleven subsequently announced they would fund an inquiry to investigate instances of wage fraud.

In the area of [[abstract algebra]] known as [[group theory]], the '''monster group''' M (also known as the '''Fischer–Griess monster''', or the '''friendly giant''') is the largest [[sporadic simple group]], having [[Order (group theory)|order]]
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;{{·}}3&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;{{·}}5&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;{{·}}7&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;{{·}}11&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;{{·}}13&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;{{·}}17{{·}}19{{·}}23{{·}}29{{·}}31{{·}}41{{·}}47{{·}}59{{·}}71

: ≈ 8{{e|53}}.

The [[Finite group|finite]] [[simple group]]s have been completely [[Classification of finite simple groups|classified]].  Every such group belongs to one of 18 [[countably infinite]] families, or is one of 26 sporadic groups that do not follow such a systematic pattern. The monster group contains 20 sporadic groups (including itself) as [[subquotient]]s. [[Robert Griess]], who proved the existence of the monster in 1982, has called those 20 groups the ''happy family'', and the remaining six exceptions ''[[pariah group|pariahs]]''.

It is difficult to give a good constructive definition of the monster because of its complexity. [[Martin Gardner]] wrote a popular account of the monster group in his June 1980 [[Mathematical Games column]] in ''[[Scientific American]]''.

==History==
The monster was predicted by [[Bernd Fischer (mathematician)|Bernd Fischer]] (unpublished, about 1973) and {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Robert Griess|first=Robert|last= Griess|year=1976}} as a simple group containing a [[Double covering group|double cover]] of Fischer's [[baby monster group]] as a [[Centralizer and normalizer|centralizer]] of an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]].  Within a few months, the order of M was found by Griess using the [[Thompson order formula]], and Fischer, Conway, Norton and Thompson discovered other groups as subquotients, including many of the known sporadic groups, and two new ones: the [[Thompson group (finite)|Thompson group]] and the [[Harada–Norton group]]. The [[Character theory|character table]] of the monster, a 194-by-194 array, was calculated in 1979 by Fischer and Donald Livingstone using computer programs written by Michael Thorne. It was not clear in the 1970s whether the monster actually existed. {{harvtxt|Griess|1982}} constructed M as the [[automorphism group]] of the [[Griess algebra]], a 196,884-dimensional commutative [[nonassociative algebra]] over the real numbers; he first announced his construction in [[Ann Arbor]] on January 14, 1980. In his 1982 paper, he referred to the monster as the Friendly Giant, but this name has not been generally adopted. {{harvs|txt|authorlink=John Horton Conway|first=John |last=Conway|year=1985}} and {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Jacques Tits|first=Jacques|last=Tits|year1=1983|year2=1984}} subsequently simplified this construction.

Griess's construction showed that the monster exists. {{harvs|txt|authorlink=John G. Thompson|last=Thompson|year=1979}} showed that its uniqueness (as a simple group satisfying certain conditions coming from the classification of finite simple groups) would follow from the existence of a 196,883-dimensional [[faithful representation]]. A proof of the existence of such a representation was announced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Simon P. Norton|last=Norton|year=1985}}, though he has never published the details. {{harvtxt|Griess|Meierfrankenfeld|Segev|1989}} gave the first complete published proof of the uniqueness of the monster (more precisely, they showed that a group with the same centralizers of involutions as the monster is isomorphic to the monster).

The monster was a culmination of the development of sporadic simple groups and can be built from any two of three subquotients: the [[Fischer group]] Fi&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;, the baby monster, and the [[Conway group]] Co&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

The [[Schur multiplier]] and the [[outer automorphism group]] of the monster are both [[Trivial group|trivial]].

==Representations==
The minimal degree of a [[Faithful representation|faithful]] complex representation is 196,883, which is the product of the three largest [[prime divisor]]s of the order of M.
The smallest faithful linear representation over any field has dimension 196,882 over the field with two elements, only one less than the dimension of the smallest faithful complex representation.

The smallest faithful permutation representation of the monster is on
2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; · 3&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; · 5&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; · 7&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; · 11 · 13&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; · 29 · 41 · 59 · 71 (about 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;)
points.

The monster can be realized as a [[Galois group]] over the [[rational number]]s {{Harv|Thompson|1984|loc=p. 443}}, and as a [[Hurwitz group]].{{sfn|Wilson|2001}}

The monster is unusual among simple groups in that there is no known easy way to represent its elements. This is not due so much to its size as to the absence of &quot;small&quot; representations. For example, the simple groups A&lt;sub&gt;100&lt;/sub&gt; and SL&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;(2) are far larger, but easy to calculate with as they have &quot;small&quot; permutation or linear representations. The alternating groups have permutation representations that are &quot;small&quot; compared to the size of the group, and all finite simple groups of Lie type have linear representations that are &quot;small&quot; compared to the size of the group. All sporadic groups other than the monster also have linear representations small enough that they are easy to work with on a computer (the next hardest case after the monster is the baby monster, with a representation of dimension 4370).

=== A computer construction ===
[[Robert Arnott Wilson|Robert A. Wilson]] has found explicitly (with the aid of a computer) two invertible 196,882 by 196,882 matrices (with elements in the [[Finite field|field of order 2]]) which together [[Generating set of a group|generate]] the monster group by matrix multiplication; this is one dimension lower than the 196,883-dimensional representation in characteristic 0. Performing calculations with these matrices is possible but is too expensive in terms of time and storage space to be useful, as each such matrix occupies over four and a half gigabytes.{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}}

Wilson asserts that the best description of the monster is to say, &quot;It is the [[automorphism group]] of the [[monster vertex algebra]]&quot;.  This is not much help however, because nobody has found a &quot;really simple and natural construction of the monster vertex algebra&quot;.{{sfn|Borcherds|2002|p=1077}}

Wilson with collaborators has found a method of performing calculations with the monster that is considerably faster. Let ''V'' be a 196,882 dimensional vector space over the field with 2 elements. A large subgroup ''H'' (preferably a maximal subgroup) of the Monster is selected in which it is easy to perform calculations. The subgroup ''H'' chosen is 3&lt;SUP&gt;1+12&lt;/SUP&gt;.2.Suz.2, where Suz is the [[Suzuki group (mathematics)|Suzuki group]]. Elements of the monster are stored as words in the elements of ''H'' and an extra generator ''T''. It is reasonably quick to calculate the action of one of these words on a vector in ''V''. Using this action, it is possible to perform calculations (such as the order of an element of the monster). Wilson has exhibited vectors ''u'' and ''v'' whose joint stabilizer is the trivial group. Thus (for example) one can calculate the order of an element ''g'' of the monster by finding the smallest ''i'' &amp;gt; 0 such that ''g''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;''u'' = ''u'' and ''g''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;''v'' = ''v''.

This and similar constructions (in different [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristics]]) have been used to find some of its non-local maximal subgroups.

== Moonshine ==
{{main|Monstrous moonshine}}
The monster group is one of two principal constituents in the [[monstrous moonshine]] conjecture by Conway and Norton (1979), which relates discrete and non-discrete mathematics and was finally proved by [[Richard Ewen Borcherds|Richard Borcherds]] in 1992.

In this setting, the monster group is visible as the automorphism group of the [[monster module]], a [[vertex operator algebra]], an infinite dimensional algebra containing the Griess algebra, and acts on the [[monster Lie algebra]], a [[generalized Kac–Moody algebra]].

Many mathematicians, including Conway, have seen the monster as a beautiful and still mysterious object.{{sfn|Roberts|2013}} Conway said of the monster group: &quot;There's never been any kind of explanation of why it's there, and it's obviously not there just by coincidence. It's got too many intriguing properties for it all to be just an accident.&quot;{{sfn|Haran|2014|loc=7:57}} [[Simon P. Norton]], an expert on the properties of the monster group, is quoted as saying, &quot;I can explain what Monstrous Moonshine is in one sentence, it is the voice of God.&quot;{{sfn|Masters|2019}}

== McKay's E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; observation ==
There are also connections between the monster and the extended [[Dynkin diagram]]s &lt;math&gt;\tilde E_8,&lt;/math&gt; specifically between the nodes of the diagram and certain conjugacy classes in the monster, known as ''McKay's E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; observation''.{{sfn|Duncan|2008}}{{sfn|le Bruyn|2009}}{{sfn|He|McKay|2015}} This is then extended to a relation between the extended diagrams &lt;math&gt;\tilde E_6, \tilde E_7, \tilde E_8&lt;/math&gt; and the groups 3.Fi&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;′, 2.B, and M, where these are (3/2/1-fold central extensions) of the [[Fischer group]], [[baby monster group]], and monster. These are the [[sporadic group]]s associated with centralizers of elements of type 1A, 2A, and 3A in the monster, and the order of the extension corresponds to the symmetries of the diagram. See [[ADE classification#Trinities|ADE classification: trinities]] for further connections (of [[McKay correspondence]] type), including (for the monster) with the rather small simple group [[projective special linear group|PSL]](2,11) and with the 120 tritangent planes of a canonic sextic curve of genus 4 known as [[Bring's curve]].

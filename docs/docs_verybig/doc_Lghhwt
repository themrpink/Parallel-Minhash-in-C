In other languages, singulatives can be regularly formed from [[collective noun]]s; e.g. [[Modern Standard Arabic|Standard Arabic]] {{lang|ar|تفاح}} ''tuffāḥ'' &quot;apple&quot; → {{lang|ar|تفاحة}} ''tuffāḥah'' &quot;(individual) apple&quot;, {{lang|ar|بقر}} ''baqar'' &quot;cattle&quot; → {{lang|ar|بقرة}} ''baqarah'' &quot;(single) cow&quot;.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In [[Russian language|Russian]], the suffix for forming singulative form is -ин- ''-in-''; e.g. град ''grad'' &quot;hail&quot; → градина ''gradina'' &quot;hailstone&quot;, лёд ''lyod'' &quot;ice&quot; → льдина ''l'dina'' &quot;block of ice&quot;. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In both Russian and Arabic, the singulative form always takes on the feminine [[Grammatical gender|gender]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In Dutch, singulative forms of collective nouns are occasionally made by diminutives: ''snoep'' &quot;sweets, candy&quot; → ''snoepje'' &quot;sweet, piece of candy&quot;. These singulatives can be pluralised like most other nouns: ''snoepjes'' &quot;several sweets, pieces of candy&quot;.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===Dual===
{{Main |Dual (grammatical number)}}
The distinction between a &quot;singular&quot; number (one) and a &quot;plural&quot; number (more than one) found in English is not the only possible classification. Another one is &quot;singular&quot; (one), &quot;dual&quot; (two) and &quot;plural&quot; (more than two). Dual number existed in [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], persisted in many ancient [[Indo-European languages]] that descended from it—[[Sanskrit]], [[Ancient Greek]], [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Old Norse]], and [[Old English]] for example—and can still be found in a few modern Indo-European languages such as [[Slovene language|Slovene]].{{Sfn | Kordić | 2001 | pp = 63, 72–73}} Many more modern Indo-European languages show residual traces of the dual, as in the [[English language|English]] distinctions ''both'' vs. ''all'', ''either'' vs. ''any'', ''neither'' vs. ''none'', and so on. Former dual forms may broaden their meanings to become paucal forms: Norwegian ''både'', for example, though cognate with English ''both'', can be used with more than two things, as in ''X sparer både tid, penger, og arbeid'', literally &quot;X saves both time, money, and labour&quot;.

Many [[Semitic languages]] also have dual number. For instance, in Arabic all nouns can have singular, plural, or dual forms. For non-[[broken plural]]s, masculine plural nouns end with ون ''{{transl |ar|DIN|-ūn}}'' and feminine plural nouns end with ات ''{{transl |ar|DIN|-āt}}'', whilst ان ''{{transl |ar|DIN|-ān}}'', is added to the end of a noun to indicate that it is dual (even among nouns that have broken plurals).

Pronouns in [[Polynesian languages]] such as [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]] exhibit the singular, dual, and plural numbers.

The dual may be restricted to certain morphological categories. For example, in [[North Saami]], in possessive forms the possessor has three numbers (singular, dual, plural) whereas the noun possessed only has two (singular, plural).

===Trial===
The trial number is a grammatical number referring to 'three items', in contrast to 'singular' (one item), 'dual' (two items), and 'plural' (four or more items). Several Austronesian languages such as [[Tolomako]], [[Lihir language|Lihir]], and [[Manam language|Manam]]; the [[Kiwaian languages]]; and the Austronesian-influenced creole languages [[Bislama]] and [[Tok Pisin]] have the trial number in their pronouns. No language has been documented to have trial number in its nouns.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010|reason=what source(s) say no language is known with trial number in its nouns?}}

===Quadral===
The [[wikt:quadral|quadral]] number, if it existed, would denote [[4 (number)|four]] items together, as trial does three. No known natural language has it, nor is there any proof that any natural language ever did. It was once thought to exist in the pronoun systems of [[Marshallese language|Marshallese]], spoken in the [[Marshall Islands]] in the Pacific Ocean,&lt;ref&gt;Gregersen, Edgar A., &quot;Language in Africa&quot;, p. 62. (Note that Marshallese is not a language spoken in Africa.)&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Sursurunga language|Sursurunga]],&lt;ref&gt;Hutchisson, Don. 1986. Sursurunga pronouns and the special uses of quadral number. In: Wiesemann, Ursula (ed.) Pronominal Systems. (Continuum 5). Tübingen: Narr. 217–255.&lt;/ref&gt; in Tangga,&lt;ref&gt;Capell, Arthur, 1971. The Austronesian Languages of Australian New Guinea. In: Thomas A. Sebeok (ed.), Current Trends in Linguistics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beaumont, Clive H. 1976 Austronesian Languages: New Ireland. In: Stephen A. Wurm (ed.) Austronesian Languages: New Guinea Area Languages and Language Study II (Pacific Linguistics, Series C, no. 39) 387-97. Canberra:&lt;/ref&gt; and in several other Austronesian languages. While not all of these languages are adequately attested, it turns out that Sursurunga instead has both a &quot;lesser paucal&quot; (labeled &quot;trial&quot;, but in fact referring to small groups, with typically three or four members) and a &quot;greater paucal&quot; (misnamed the &quot;quadral&quot;, as it has a minimum of four, e.g. a pair of [[dyadic kin]] terms)—the distinction is along the lines of &quot;a few&quot; vs. &quot;several&quot;;—and that what Marshallese actually has is a trial and a paucal.{{Sfn | Corbett | 2000 | pp = 25–30, 40, 46, 224, 317, 358}} None of them has a &quot;quadral&quot;; in at least two cases the field workers who originally suggested they did have a &quot;quadral&quot; were also the first to publish a peer-reviewed article contradicting that suggestion.

===Paucal===
Paucal number, for a few (as opposed to many) instances of the referent (e.g. in [[Hopi language|Hopi]], [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]], [[Lower Sepik-Ramu languages]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Foley-Sepik&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Foley |first=William A. |author-link=William A.

Paucal number has also been documented in some [[Cushitic languages]] of Ethiopia, including Baiso, which marks singular, paucal, plural.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Surrey | place = UK | url = http://www.features.surrey.ac.uk/features/number.html | title = Paucal documentation}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When paucal number is used in Arabic, it generally refers to ten or fewer instances.

Of the Indo-European languages, [[Kurmanji]] (also known as Northern Kurdish) is one of the few known languages with paucal number. For instance: &quot;car-'''IN'''-an&quot; (sometimes), cf. &quot;gelek car-an&quot; (many times) and &quot;car&quot; (time). Another example is &quot;sêv-'''IN'''-an&quot; (some apples), &quot;sêvan&quot; (the apples), &quot;sêv&quot; (apple). It can be applied to basically all nouns. In [[Russian language|Russian]], the [[genitive]] singular is also applied to two, three or four items (2, 3, 4 ка́мня – stones, gen. sg.; but 5...20 камне́й – stones, gen. pl.), making it effectively paucal (cf. э́тот ка́мень – this stone, [[Nominative|nom.]] sg.; э́ти ка́мни – these stones, nom. pl.). [[Polish language|Polish]] functions similarly: 'one dog' is ''jeden pies''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', while (2, 3, 4 psy – dogs, pl.; but ''5+ psów'' - dogs, gen. pl.). [[Slovene language|Slovene]] has one more distinction. With its use of dual ('one dog' is ''en pes'', 'two dogs' is ''dva psa''), paucal is only used for counting 3 and 4 (''3, 4 psi'' – dogs, pl.; but ''5+ psov'' – dogs, gen.pl.).

===Distributive plural===
Distributive plural number, for many instances viewed as independent individuals (for example, in [[Navajo language|Navajo]]).

==Formal expression==
[[Synthetic language]]s typically distinguish grammatical number by [[inflection]]. ([[Analytic language]]s, such as [[Chinese spoken language|Chinese]], often do not mark grammatical number.)

Some languages have no [[marker (linguistics)|marker]] for the plural in certain cases, e.g. [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''hus'' – &quot;house, houses&quot; (but ''huset'' – &quot;the house&quot;, ''husen'' – &quot;the houses&quot;).

In most languages, the singular is formally unmarked, whereas the plural is marked in some way. Other languages, most notably the [[Bantu languages]], mark both the singular and the plural, for instance [[Swahili language|Swahili]] (see example below). The third logical possibility, found in only a few languages such as [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], is an unmarked plural contrasting with marked singular. Below are some examples of number [[affix]]es for nouns (where the inflecting [[morpheme]]s are underlined):

* [[Affix]]ation (by adding or removing [[prefix]]es, [[suffix]]es, [[infix]]es, or [[circumfix]]es):
** [[Estonian language|Estonian]]: ''puu'' &quot;tree, wood&quot; (singular) – ''puu&lt;u&gt;d&lt;/u&gt;'' &quot;the trees, woods&quot; (nominative plural), or ''kolm puud'' &quot;three trees&quot; ([[Partitive case|partitive]] singular)
** [[Finnish language|Finnish]]: ''lehmä'' &quot;cow, the cow&quot; (singular) – ''lehmä&lt;u&gt;t&lt;/u&gt;'' &quot;the cows&quot; ([[nominative]] plural)

* [[Simulfix]] (through various kinds of internal [[Apophony|sound alternations]]):
** [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: كِتَاب ''k&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;t&lt;u&gt;ā&lt;/u&gt;b'' &quot;book&quot; (singular) – كُتُب ''k&lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt;t&lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt;b'' &quot;books&quot; (plural)

* [[Reduplication]] (through doubling):
** [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''orang'' &quot;person&quot; (singular) – ''orang-&lt;u&gt;orang&lt;/u&gt;'' &quot;people&quot; (plural); '''BUT''' ''dua orang'' &quot;two people&quot; and ''banyak orang'' &quot;many people&quot; (reduplication is not done when the context is clear and when the plurality is not emphasized)
** [[Pipil language|Pipil]]: ''kumit'' &quot;pot&quot; (singular) – ''&lt;u&gt;kuj&lt;/u&gt;-kumit'' &quot;pots&quot; (plural); similar to Indonesian, reduplication is omitted when plurality is marked elsewhere or not emphasized.
** [[Somali language|Somali]]: ''buug'' &quot;book&quot; (singular) – ''buug-&lt;u&gt;ag&lt;/u&gt;'' &quot;books&quot; (plural)
* [[Suppletion]] (the use of the one word as the inflected form of another word):

* [[Tone (linguistics)|Tonality]] (by changing a drag tone to a push tone)
** [[Limburgish]]: ''daãg'' &quot;day&quot; (singular) – ''daàg'' &quot;days&quot; (plural)
** [[Ancient Greek]]: γλῶσσα ''glôssa'' &quot;tongue&quot; (singular) – γλώσσα ''glǒssa'' &quot;two tongues&quot; (dual)

Elements marking number may appear on nouns and [[pronoun]]s in [[dependent-marking language]]s or on [[verb]]s and [[adjectives]] in [[head-marking language]]s.

| Paul is teaching the cowboy&lt;u&gt;'''s'''&lt;/u&gt;.
| Paul idilohí yiłch’í&lt;u&gt;'''da'''&lt;/u&gt;gó’aah.
|}

In the English sentence above, the plural suffix ''-s'' is added to the noun ''cowboy''. In the equivalent in [[Western Apache]], a [[head-marking language]], a plural infix ''da-'' is added to the verb ''yiłch’ígó’aah'' &quot;he is teaching him&quot;, resulting in ''yiłch’ídagó’aah'' &quot;he is teaching them&quot; while noun ''idilohí'' &quot;cowboy&quot; is unmarked for number.

===Number particles===
Plurality is sometimes marked by a specialized number particle (or number word). This is frequent in Australian and Austronesian languages. An example from [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] is the word ''mga'' [mɐˈŋa]: compare ''bahay'' &quot;house&quot; with ''mga bahay'' &quot;houses&quot;. In [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]], certain nouns optionally denote plurality by secondary stress: ''ing laláki'' &quot;man&quot; and ''ing babái'' &quot;woman&quot; become ''ding láláki'' &quot;men&quot; and ''ding bábái'' &quot;women&quot;.

===Classifiers with number morphology===
In [[Sanskrit]] and some other languages, number and case are fused category and there is concord for number between a noun and its [[Predicate (grammar)|predicator]]. Some languages however (for example, [[Assamese language|Assamese]]) lack this feature.

Languages that show number inflection for a large enough corpus of nouns or allow them to combine directly with singular and plural numerals can be described as non-classifier languages. On the other hand, there are languages that obligatorily require a counter word or the so-called [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifier]] for all nouns. For example, the category of number in Assamese is fused with the category of classifier, which always carries a definite/indefinite reading. The singularity or plurality of the noun is determined by the addition of the classifier [[suffix]] either to the noun or to the numeral. Number system in Assamese is either realized as numeral or as nominal inflection, but not both. Numerals [ek] 'one' and [dui] 'two', can be realized as both [[free morpheme]] and [[clitics]]. When used with classifiers, these two numerals are cliticised to the classifiers.

Pingelapese is a Micronesian language spoken on the Pingelap atoll and on two of the eastern Caroline Islands, called the high island of Pohnpei. In Pingelapese, the meaning, use, or shape of an object can be expressed through the use of numerical classifiers. These classifiers combine and noun and a number that together can give more details about the object. There are at least five sets of numerical classifiers in Pingelapese. Each classifier has a numeral part and a classifier part that corresponds to the noun it is describing. The classifier follows the noun in a phrase. There is a separate set of numerical classifiers that is used when the object is not specified. Examples of this is the names of the days of the week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Preverbal Particles in Pingelapese|last=Hattori|first=Ryoko|publisher=Ann Arbor|year=2012|isbn=9781267817211|pages=38–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Obligatoriness of number marking ===
In many languages, such as English, number is obligatorily expressed in every grammatical context. Some limit number expression to certain classes of nouns, such as [[animacy|animates]] or referentially prominent nouns (as with proximate forms in most [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]]s, opposed to referentially less prominent obviative forms). In others, such as Chinese and Japanese, number marking is not consistently applied to most nouns unless a distinction is needed or already present.

A very common situation is for plural number to not be marked if there is any other overt indication of number, as for example in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''virág'' &quot;flower&quot;; ''virágok'' &quot;flowers&quot;; ''hat virág'' &quot;six flowers&quot;.

===Transnumeral{{anchor|general number}}===
Many languages, such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Malay language|Malay]], have optional number marking. In such cases, an unmarked noun is neither singular nor plural, but rather ambiguous as to number. This is called ''transnumeral'' or sometimes ''general number,'' abbreviated {{sc|'''trn'''}}. Many such languages have optional number marking, which tends to be used for definite and highly [[animacy hierarchy|animate]] referents, most notably first-person pronouns.

=== Inverse number ===
The languages of the [[Tanoan languages|Tanoan]] family have three numbers – singular, dual, and plural – and exhibit an unusual system of marking number, called ''inverse number'' (or ''number toggling''). In this scheme, every [[count noun|countable noun]] has what might be called its &quot;inherent&quot; or &quot;expected&quot; numbers, and is unmarked for these. When a noun appears in an &quot;inverse&quot; (atypical) number, it is inflected to mark this. For example, in [[Jemez language|Jemez]], where nouns take the ending ''-sh'' to denote an inverse number, there are four [[noun class]]es which inflect for number as follows:

{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; line-height: 1.2em; border-collapse: collapse; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid;&quot;

| ''-''
| ''-sh''
| ''-''
|-
!IV
|mass (non-countable) nouns
| (n/a)
| (n/a)
| (n/a)
|}

As can be seen, class-I nouns are inherently singular, class-II nouns are inherently plural, class-III nouns are inherently singular or plural. Class-IV nouns cannot be counted and are never marked with ''-sh''.*&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sprott | first = Robert | year = 1992 | title = Jemez syntax | type = doctoral dissertation | publisher = [[University of Chicago]] | place = US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar system is seen in [[Kiowa language|Kiowa]] (Kiowa is distantly related to Tanoan languages like Jemez):

{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; line-height: 1.2em; border-collapse: collapse; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid;&quot;

===Verbs===
{{Main|Grammatical conjugation}}
In many languages, verbs are conjugated according to number. Using French as an example, one says ''je vois'' (''I see''), but ''nous voyons'' (''we see''). The verb ''voir'' (''to see'') changes from ''vois'' in the first person singular to ''voyons'' in the plural. In everyday English, this often happens in the third person (''she sees'', ''they see''), but not in other grammatical persons, except with the verb ''to be''.
&lt;!-- The next paragraph makes no sense to me ([[User:Ruakh|Ruakh]]), and I don't see anything obviously relevant in the linked articles, so I'm commenting it out until someone can explain it. (I think the problem might just be a misuse of linguistics terms; it makes no sense for a verb to &quot;refer&quot; to a noun, but maybe here it's being used to mean that the noun is the subject of the verb?)
Verbs may agree with the number of nouns to which they refer, even when there is no other form of number agreement in a language. For more information on this special type of number agreement, see [[Grammatical person]], [[Verb]], and [[English verbs]].
--&gt;

===Adjectives and determiners===
[[Adjective]]s often agree with the number of the noun they modify. For example, in [[French language|French]], one says ''un grand arbre'' {{IPA|[œ̃ ɡʁɑ̃t aʁbʁ]}} &quot;a tall tree&quot;, but ''deux grands arbres'' {{IPA|[dø ɡʁɑ̃ zaʁbʁ]}} &quot;two tall trees&quot;. The singular adjective ''grand'' becomes ''grands'' in the plural, unlike English &quot;tall&quot;, which remains unchanged.

Other [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]]s may agree with number. In English, the [[demonstrative]]s &quot;this&quot;, &quot;that&quot; change to &quot;these&quot;, &quot;those&quot; in the plural, and the [[indefinite article]] &quot;a&quot;, &quot;an&quot; is either omitted or changes to &quot;some&quot;. In French and German, the [[definite article]]s have [[grammatical gender|gender distinctions]] in the singular but not the plural. In Italian, Spanish and Portuguese, both definite and indefinite articles are inflected for gender and number, e.g. Portuguese ''o, a'' &quot;the&quot; (singular, masc./fem.), ''os, as'' &quot;the&quot; (plural, masc./fem.); ''um, uma'' &quot;a(n)&quot; (singular, masc./fem.), ''uns, umas'' &quot;some&quot; (plural, masc./fem.), ''dois, duas'' &quot;two&quot; (plural, masc./fem.),

In the [[Finnish language|Finnish]] sentence ''Yö'''t''' o'''vat''' pime'''i'''tä'' &quot;Nights are dark&quot;, each word referring to the plural noun ''yöt'' &quot;nights&quot; (&quot;night&quot; = ''yö'') is pluralized (night-&lt;small&gt;PL&lt;/small&gt; is-&lt;small&gt;PL&lt;/small&gt; dark-&lt;small&gt;PL&lt;/small&gt;-[[partitive]]).

=== Exceptions ===
{{See also|Synesis|Plurale tantum}}
Sometimes, grammatical number will not represent the actual quantity. For example, in Ancient Greek [[Neuter gender|neuter]] plurals took a singular verb.&lt;ref&gt;[https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/6417.learning-ancient-greek “Learn Ancient Greek: 11_Unit 2 Agreement Infinitives Questions”], video tutorial by Leonard Muellner and Belisi Gillespie at [[Center for Hellenic Studies]] at [[Harvard University]], published January 25, 2018; retrieved May 30, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The plural form of a pronoun may also be applied to a single individual as a sign of importance, respect or generality, as in the ''[[pluralis majestatis]]'', the [[T-V distinction]], and the [[generic you|generic &quot;you&quot;]], found in many languages, or, in English, when using the [[singular they|singular &quot;they&quot;]] for [[gender-neutrality]].

In [[Arabic grammar|Arabic]], the plural of a non-human noun (one that refers to an animal or to an [[animacy|inanimate]] entity regardless of whether the noun is grammatically masculine or feminine in the singular) is treated as feminine singular—this is called the inanimate plural. For example:

===Collective nouns===
{{Main |Collective noun}}
A collective noun is a word that designates a group of objects or beings regarded as a whole, such as &quot;flock&quot;, &quot;team&quot;, or &quot;corporation&quot;. Although many languages treat collective nouns as singular, in others they may be interpreted as plural. In [[British English]], phrases such as ''the committee are meeting'' are common (the so-called agreement ''in sensu'' &quot;in meaning&quot;; with the meaning of a noun, rather than with its form, see [[synesis|constructio ad sensum]]). The use of this type of construction varies with dialect and level of formality.

In some cases, the number marking on a verb with a collective subject may express the degree of collectivity of action:
* ''The committee are discussing the matter'' (the individual members are discussing the matter), but ''the committee has decided on the matter'' (the committee has acted as an indivisible body).
* ''The crowd is tearing down the fences'' (a crowd is doing something as a unit), but ''the crowd are cheering wildly'' (many individual members of the crowd are doing the same thing independently of each other).

==Semantic versus grammatical number==
All languages are able to specify the quantity of referents. They may do so by [[lexicon|lexical]] means with words such as English ''a few'', ''some'', ''one'', ''two'', ''five hundred''. However, not every language has a grammatical category of number. Grammatical number is expressed by [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] or [[syntactic]] means. That is, it is indicated by certain grammatical elements, such as through [[affix]]es or number words. Grammatical number may be thought of as the indication of [[semantic]] number through [[grammar]].

Languages that express quantity only by lexical means lack a grammatical category of number. For instance, in [[Khmer language|Khmer]], neither nouns nor verbs carry any grammatical information concerning number: such information can only be conveyed by lexical items such as ''khlah'' 'some', ''pii-bey'' 'a few', and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution= Linguistic sketch | url= http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=75 | title= Khmer | type= article | publisher= UCLA Language Materials project (www.lmp.ucla.edu) | access-date= 2005-11-28 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060211185103/http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=75 | archive-date= 2006-02-11 | url-status= dead }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auxiliary languages==
[[International auxiliary language|Auxiliary language]]s often have fairly simple systems of grammatical number. In one of the most common schemes (found, for example, in [[Interlingua]] and [[Ido]]), nouns and pronouns distinguish between singular and plural, but not other numbers, and adjectives and verbs do not display any number agreement. In [[Esperanto]], however, adjectives must agree in both number and case with the nouns that they qualify.

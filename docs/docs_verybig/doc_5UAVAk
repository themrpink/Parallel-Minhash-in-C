==Ribs as food==
[[Ribs (food)|Ribs as food]] are widely used from many animals. The ribs are the less meaty part of the [[meat chop]] and they are often cooked as part of a slab; five or more is known as a ''rack'', as in a [[rack of lamb]]. [[Short ribs]] are ribs of beef either served singly or several as a ''plate''. A [[rib steak]] from beef is a popular choice used in many [[cuisine]]s. [[Pork rib]]s, including [[spare ribs]] are popular in [[European cuisine|European]] and [[Asian cuisine]].

'''Sea butterflies''', [[scientific name]] '''Thecosomata''' ('''thecosomes''',&lt;ref name=&quot;Lalli1989&quot; /&gt; &quot;case/shell-body&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|theco-}} Sub-entry: &quot;''thecoˈsomate'', ''thecoˈsomatous''  {{abbr|adjs.|adjectives}} [{{abbr|Gr.|Greek}} {{lang|grc|σῶµα}} body], belonging to the Thecosomata&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;), are a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] [[suborder (biology)|suborder]] of small [[pelagic]] swimming [[sea snail]]s. These are [[holoplankton]]ic [[opisthobranch]] [[gastropod]] [[mollusk]]s in the informal group [[Opisthobranchia]].  They include some of the world's most abundant gastropod species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lalli1989&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Along with its sister group, the [[Gymnosomata]], this group is included in the [[pteropod]]s. The validity of this clade is not unanimously established; although it had fallen out of favour for a number of years, recent molecular evidence suggests that the taxon should be resurrected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Klussmann-Kolb | first1 = A. | last2 = Dinapoli | first2 = A. | doi = 10.1111/j.1439-0469.2006.00351.x | title = Systematic position of the pelagic Thecosomata and Gymnosomata within Opisthobranchia (Mollusca, Gastropoda) - revival of the Pteropoda | journal = Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 118 | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Most Thecosomata have a calcified [[gastropod shell|shell]], whereas mature Gymnosomata do not.&lt;ref name=Hunt2007/&gt;

==Morphology==
[[File:Sea butterfly pseudoconch (12286).jpg|thumb|Sea butterfly pseudoconch]]
These snails float and swim freely in the water, and are carried along with the currents. This has led to a number of adaptations in their bodies. The shell and the [[gill]] have disappeared in several families. Their foot has taken the form of two wing-like lobes, or [[parapodia]], which propel the animal through the sea by slow flapping movements.  They are rather difficult to observe, since the shell (when present) is mostly colorless, very fragile and usually less than 1&amp;nbsp;cm in length. Although their shell may be so fine as to be transparent, it is nevertheless [[calcareous]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Comeau | first1 = S. | last2 = Gorsky | first2 = G. | last3 = Jeffree | first3 = R. | last4 = Teyssié | first4 = J. -L. | last5 = Gattuso | first5 = J. -P. | title = Impact of ocean acidification on a key Arctic pelagic mollusc (''Limacina helicina'') | doi = 10.5194/bg-6-1877-2009 | journal = Biogeosciences | volume = 6 | issue = 9 | pages = 1877 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; their shells are [[symmetry (biology)#Bilateral symmetry|bilaterally symmetric]] and can vary widely in shape: coiled, needle-like, triangular, globulous.

The shell is present in all stages of the Cavolinioidea (euthecosomata) life cycle, whereas in the  Cymbulioidea (pseudothecosomata), adult Peraclididae  bear shells, Cymbuliidae shed their larval shells and develop a cartilaginous pseudoconch in adulthood, and Desmopteridaen adults lack any rigid structure.

== Behaviour ==
Thecosomata beat their wing-like parapodia to &quot;fly&quot; through the water.&lt;ref name=Seibel2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Murphy, D. |author2=Adhikari, D. |author3=Webster, D. |author4=Yen, J. |title=Underwater flight by the planktonic sea butterfly |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |year=2016 |volume=219 |issue=4 |pages=535–543|doi=10.1242/jeb.129205 |doi-access=free |pmid=26889002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are [[holoplankton]]ic; that is, they spend their whole life in a planktonic form, rather than just being planktonic during the [[larva]]l stage, as is more commonly the case in many [[marine (ocean)|marine]] gastropods, whose [[veliger]] larvae are part of the [[meroplankton]].

Little is known about the behaviour of sea butterflies, but they are known to have a peculiar way of feeding. At times, they just float along, [[ventral]]-side up, with the currents. They are mostly passive [[plankton]] feeders, but at times they can be active feeders. They are generally herbivorous,&lt;ref name=Hunt2007&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hunt | first1 = B. P.

If disturbed, they abandon the net and flap slowly away. When descending to deeper water, they hold their wings up. Sometimes, they swarm in large numbers and can be found washed up in [[flotsam]], especially along the coast of [[eastern Australia]].

== Distribution ==
Thecosomata are the most common (in terms of diversity, species richness, and abundance) in the top {{Convert|25|m}} of the ocean, and become rarer the deeper one samples.&lt;ref name=ParraFlores2009&gt;{{cite journal

Every day, they migrate vertically in the water column, following their planktonic prey. At night they hunt at the surface and return to deeper water in the morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sea Butterfly|url=http://www.ourbreathingplanet.com/sea-butterfly/|website=Our Breathing Planet |access-date=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fossil record ==
This is, geologically speaking, a rather young group, having evolved from the Late [[Paleocene]] in the [[Cenozoic]] Era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Bé |first1=A.W.H. |first2=R.W. |last2=Gilmer |year=1977 |title=A zoogeographic and taxonomic review of euthecosomatous pteropoda |pages=733–808 |journal=Oceanic Micropaleontology |volume=1 |editor-first=A.T.S. |editor-last=Ramsey |publisher=Academic Press |place=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group is represented in the fossil record from shells of those groups within the clade that mineralized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These shells are a major contributor to the carbonate cycle, making up as much as 12% of global carbonate flux.&lt;ref name=Hunt2007/&gt;  However the low stability of their [[aragonitic]] shells means that few end up being preserved in sediments, these being in shallower waters of the tropical oceans.&lt;ref name=Hunt2007/&gt;

==Importance in the food chain==
These creatures, which range from [[lentil]]- to orange-sized, are eaten by various marine species, including a wide variety of fish that are, in turn, consumed by [[penguin]]s and [[polar bear]]s.  The sea butterflies form the sole food source of their relatives, the [[Gymnosomata]].&lt;ref name=Seibel2007&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Seibel | first1 = B.

However, fish can get &quot;black gut&quot;, rendering them unsaleable, if sea butterflies are consumed in large quantities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lalli1989&quot; /&gt;

{{Short description|Bound state of an electron and positron}}[[File:Positronium.svg|thumb|200px|right|An [[electron]] and [[positron]] orbiting around their common [[centre of mass]]. (An s state has zero angular momentum; so orbiting around each other would mean going straight at each other until scattered or until annihilation, whichever comes first). This is a bound quantum state known as '''positronium'''.]]
'''Positronium''' ('''Ps''') is a system consisting of an [[electron]] and its [[antimatter|anti-particle]], a [[positron]], bound together into an [[exotic atom]], specifically an [[onium]].  The system is unstable: the two particles annihilate each other to predominantly produce two or three [[gamma-ray]]s, depending on the relative spin states.  The [[energy level]]s of the two particles are similar to that of the [[hydrogen atom]] (which is a bound state of a [[proton]] and an electron). However, because of the reduced mass, the [[frequency|frequencies]] of the [[spectral line]]s are less than half of those for the corresponding hydrogen lines.

==States==

The mass of positronium is 1.022&amp;nbsp;MeV, which is twice the electron mass minus the binding energy of a few eV. The [[ground state]] of positronium, like that of hydrogen, has two possible configurations depending on the relative orientations of the spins of the electron and the positron.

The [[Singlet state|''singlet'' state]], {{SubatomicParticle|para-positronium}},  with [[Antiparallel (mathematics)|antiparallel]] [[spin (physics)|spin]]s ([[spin quantum number|''S'']]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, ''M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) is known as ''para''-positronium (''p''-Ps). It has a mean lifetime of 0.12&amp;nbsp;[[nanosecond|ns]] and decays preferentially into two gamma rays with energy of {{val|511|ul=keV}} each (in the [[center-of-mass frame]]). By detecting these photons the position at which the decay occurred can be determined.  This process is used in [[positron-emission tomography]]. ''Para''-positronium can decay into any even number of photons (2, 4, 6, ...), but the probability quickly decreases with the number: the [[branching ratio]] for decay into 4 photons is {{val|1.439|(2)|e=-6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;hep-ph0310099&quot;&gt;

=== Measurements ===
Measurements of these lifetimes and energy levels have been used in [[precision tests of quantum electrodynamics]], confirming [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED) predictions to high precision.&lt;ref name=&quot;hep-ph0310099&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Annihilation can proceed via a number of channels, each producing [[gamma rays]] with total energy of {{val|1022|ul = keV}} (sum of the electron and positron mass-energy), usually 2 or 3, with up to 5 gamma ray photons recorded from a single annihilation.

The annihilation into a [[neutrino]]–antineutrino pair is also possible, but the probability is predicted to be negligible. The branching ratio for ''o''-Ps decay for this channel is {{val|6.2|e=-18}} ([[electron neutrino]]–antineutrino pair) and {{val|9.5|e=-21}} (for other flavour)&lt;ref name=&quot;hep-ph9911410&quot; /&gt; in predictions based on the Standard Model, but it can be increased by non-standard neutrino properties, like relatively high [[magnetic moment]]. The experimental upper limits on branching ratio for this decay (as well as for a decay into any &quot;invisible&quot; particles) are &lt;{{val|4.3|e=-7}} for ''p''-Ps and &lt;{{val|4.2|e=-7}} for ''o''-Ps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Badertscher&quot; /&gt;

==Energy levels==
{{main|Bohr model#Electron energy levels}}

While precise calculation of positronium energy levels uses the [[Bethe–Salpeter equation]] or the [[Breit equation]], the similarity between positronium and hydrogen allows a rough estimate.  In this approximation, the energy levels are different because of a different effective mass, ''m''*, in the energy equation (see [[Bohr model#Electron energy levels|electron energy levels]] for a derivation):

::&lt;math&gt;E_n = -\frac{\mu q_\mathrm{e}^4}{8 h^2 \varepsilon_0^2} \frac{1}{n^2},&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:{{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Elementary charge|charge magnitude]] of the electron (same as the positron),
:{{mvar|h}} is [[Planck's constant]],
:{{math|''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[electric constant]] (otherwise known as the permittivity of free space),
:{{mvar|&amp;mu;}} is the [[reduced mass]]:
:::&lt;math&gt;\mu = \frac{m_\mathrm{e} m_\mathrm{p}}{m_\mathrm{e} + m_\mathrm{p}} = \frac{m_\mathrm{e}^2}{2m_\mathrm{e}} = \frac{m_\mathrm{e}}{2},&lt;/math&gt;
:where {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}} are, respectively, the mass of the electron and the positron (which are ''the same'' by definition as antiparticles).

Thus, for positronium, its reduced mass only differs from the electron by a factor of 2. This causes the energy levels to also roughly be half of what they are for the hydrogen atom.

So finally, the energy levels of positronium are given by

::&lt;math&gt; E_n = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{m_\mathrm{e} q_\mathrm{e}^4}{8 h^2 \varepsilon_0^2} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{-6.8~\mathrm{eV}}{n^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The lowest energy level of positronium ({{math|''n'' {{=}} 1}}) is &amp;minus;6.8&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt]]s&amp;nbsp;(eV). The next level is {{val|-1.7|u=eV}}. The negative sign is a convention that implies a [[bound state]].  Positronium can also be considered by a particular form of the [[Two-body Dirac equations|two-body Dirac equation]]; Two particles with a [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb interaction]] can be exactly separated in the (relativistic) [[center-of-momentum frame]] and the resulting ground-state energy has been obtained very accurately using [[finite element method]]s of J. Shertzer&lt;ref name=&quot;Shertzer&quot;/&gt; and confirmed more recently.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dirac equation whose Hamiltonian comprises two Dirac particles and a static Coulomb potential is not relativistically invariant.  But if one adds the {{math|{{sfrac|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} (or {{math|''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{mvar|&amp;alpha;}} is the [[fine-structure constant]]) terms, where {{math|''n'' {{=}} 1,2…}}, then the result is relativistically invariant.  Only the leading term is included.  The {{math|''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} contribution is the Breit term; workers rarely go to {{math|''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} because at {{math|''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} one has the Lamb shift, which requires quantum electrodynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shertzer&quot;&gt;

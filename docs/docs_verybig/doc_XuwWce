Early Mars spacecraft were small, and launched by [[Molniya (rocket)|Molniya]] rockets. Starting with two failures in 1969, the heavier [[Proton-K]] rocket was used to launch larger 5 tonne spacecraft, consisting of an orbiter and a lander to Mars. The orbiter bus design was likely somewhat rushed into service and immature,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} considering that it performed very unreliably in the [[Venera]] variant after 1975. This reliability problem was common to much Soviet space hardware from the late 1960s and early 1970s and was largely corrected with a deliberate policy, implemented in the mid-1970s, of consolidating (or &quot;debugging&quot;) existing designs rather than introducing new ones.  The names of the &quot;Mars&quot; missions do not need to be translated, as the word &quot;Mars&quot; is spelled and pronounced approximately the same way in English and Russian.

In addition to the Mars program, the Soviet Union also sent a probe to Mars as part of the [[Zond program]]; [[Zond 2]], however it failed en route. Two more spacecraft were sent during the [[Phobos program]]. In 1996, [[Russia]] launched [[Mars 96]], its first interplanetary mission since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], however it failed to depart Earth orbit.

==Spacecraft==

===Mars 1M===
{{Main|Mars 1M}}
[[File:Soviet Union-1964-Stamp-0.06. Mars 1.jpg|thumb|Mars 1 stamp]]
The first Soviet attempts to send a probe to Mars were the two [[Mars 1M]] spacecraft, which each had a mass of about 650&amp;nbsp;kg. Both were launched in 1960 and failed to achieve orbit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marsnik&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/chronology_mars.html|title=Chronology of Mars Exploration|work=National Space Science Data Center|accessdate=2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The spacecraft were dubbed ''Marsnik'' by the Western media.

===Mars 2MV===
{{Main|Mars 1}}
[[Mars 1]] was launched in 1962 but failed en route to Mars. Two other Soviet launches at around the same time, [[Mars 2MV-4 No.1]] and [[Mars 2MV-3 No.1]] were {{convert|900|kg|lb|adj=on}} spacecraft, however both failed to leave Earth orbit due to problems with the upper stages of their carrier rockets.

===Mars 2M===
[[Mars 2M No.521]] and [[Mars 2M No.522]], known in the West as Mars 1969A and B, were heavier spacecraft with masses of {{convert|5|t}}. They were launched by [[Proton-K]] rockets, and consisted of orbiters. Both were destroyed during launch.

===Mars 4M===
The Mars 4M spacecraft; [[Mars 2]] and [[Mars 3]] missions consisted of identical spacecraft, each with an orbiter and an attached lander, which became the first spacecraft to reach the surface of Mars.

The orbiters' primary scientific objectives were to image the Martian surface and clouds, determine the temperature on Mars, study the topography, composition and physical properties of the surface, measure properties of the atmosphere, monitor the [[solar wind]] and the interplanetary and Martian [[magnetic field]]s, and act as communications relays to send signals from the landers to Earth.

[[File:1972 CPA 4113.jpg|thumb|Mars 2 stamp]]
*Launch date/time:
**Mars 2: May 19, 1971 at 16:22:44 UTC
*Launch mass (including fuel):
**Combined: 4650&amp;nbsp;kg
**Orbiter: 3440&amp;nbsp;kg
**Lander: 1210&amp;nbsp;kg
*On-orbit dry mass: 2265&amp;nbsp;kg
*Dimensions: 4.1 meters tall, 2 meters across (5.9 meters across with solar panels deployed)

Mars 2 released the descent module 4.5 hours before reaching Mars on November 27, 1971. The descent module entered the Martian atmosphere at roughly 6.0&amp;nbsp;km/s at a steeper angle than planned. The descent system malfunctioned and the lander crashed at {{Coord|45|S|30|W|globe:Mars}}, delivering the Soviet Union coat of arms to the surface. Meanwhile, the orbiter engine performed a burn to put the spacecraft into a 1380 x 24,940&amp;nbsp;km, 18‑hour orbit about Mars with an inclination of 48.9 degrees. Scientific instruments were generally turned on for about 30 minutes near [[periapsis]].

====Mars 3====
{{Main|Mars 3}}
[[Image:1972 CPA 4114.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mars 3]] lander stamp]]

*Launch date/time:
**Mars 3: May 28, 1971 at 15:26:30 UTC
*Launch mass (including fuel):
**Combined: 4650&amp;nbsp;kg
**Orbiter: 3440&amp;nbsp;kg
**Lander: 1210&amp;nbsp;kg
*On-orbit dry mass: 2265&amp;nbsp;kg
*Dimensions: 4.1 meters tall, 2 meters across (5.9 meters across with solar panels deployed)

Mars 3's descent module was released at 09:14 UT on December 2, 1971, 4 hours 35 minutes before reaching Mars. The descent module entered the Martian atmosphere at roughly 5.7&amp;nbsp;km/s. Through [[aerodynamic braking]], [[parachute]]s, and [[retrorocket]]s, the lander achieved a soft landing at {{Coord|45|S|158|W|globe:Mars}} and began operations. However, after 20 seconds the instruments stopped working for unknown reasons, perhaps as a result of the massive surface dust storms raging at the time of landing. Mars 3 lander still managed to transmit a portion of the first picture of Martian surface. Meanwhile, the orbiter had suffered from a partial loss of fuel and did not have enough to put itself into a planned 25-hour orbit. The engine instead performed a truncated burn to put the spacecraft into a long 12-day-19-hour period orbit about Mars with an inclination thought to be similar to that of Mars 2 (48.9 degrees).

Both landers had a small Mars '[[rover (space exploration)|rover]]' on board, which would move across the surface on skis while connected to the lander with a 15-meter umbilical. Two small metal rods were used for autonomous obstacle avoidance, as radio signals from Earth would take too long to drive the rovers using remote control. Each rover had both a densitometer and a dynamic penetrometer, to test the density and the bearing strength of the soil. Because of the demise of the landers, neither rover saw action.

The Mars 2 and 3 orbiters sent back a large volume of data covering the period from December 1971 to March 1972, although transmissions continued through August. It was announced that Mars 2 and 3 had completed their missions by August 22, 1972, after 362 orbits completed by Mars 2 and 20 orbits by Mars 3. The probes sent back a total of 60 pictures. The images and data enabled creation of surface relief maps, and gave information on the Martian [[gravity]] and [[magnetic field]]s.

===Mars 3MS===
{{Main|Kosmos 419}}
[[Kosmos 419]] was launched on May 5, 1971. It consisted of only an orbiter, and was intended to become the first spacecraft to orbit Mars ([[areocentric orbit]]), thereby beating the American [[Mariner 8]] and [[Mariner 9]] spacecraft.

The [[Mars 4]] and [[Mars 5]] orbiters, launched in 1973, were designed to orbit Mars and return information on the composition, structure, and properties of the Martian atmosphere and surface. The spacecraft were also designed to act as communications links to the Mars 6 and 7 landers. Like earlier heavy spacecraft, they were launched by Proton-K rockets.

====Mars 4====
{{Main|Mars 4}}
*Launch date/time:
**Mars 4: July 21, 1973 at 19:30:59 UTC
*On-orbit mass:
**Dry: 2270&amp;nbsp;kg
**Fully fuelled: 3440&amp;nbsp;kg

The Mars 4 orbiter reached Mars on February 10, 1974. Due to a flaw in the transistor 2Т-312 which resulted in its degradation during the voyage to Mars, the retro-rockets designed to slow the craft into Mars orbit did not fire, and Mars 4 flew by the planet at a range of 2200&amp;nbsp;km. It returned one swath of pictures and some radio occultation data which constituted the first detection of the nightside [[ionosphere]] on Mars. It continued to return interplanetary data from [[heliocentric orbit]] after the flyby.

====Mars 5====
{{Main|Mars 5}}
*Launch date/time:
**Mars 5: July 25, 1973 at 18:55:48 UTC
*On-orbit mass:
**Dry: 2270&amp;nbsp;kg
**Fully fuelled: 3440&amp;nbsp;kg

Mars 5 reached Mars on February 12, 1974 at 15:45 UT and was inserted into an elliptical 1755 by 32,555&amp;nbsp;km, 24 h 53 min orbit with an inclination of 35.3 degrees. Nearly synchronized with the rotation of the planet, its two phototelevision cameras could be commanded to take 12 pictures during each close approach. The Vega camera used a wide area 52mm lens with color filters, the Zulfar camera used a telescopic 350mm lens and long-pass orange filter. Images were transmitted in a rapid 220-line mode, and then selected pictures were retransmitted at 880 or 1760 line resolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Images&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Mitchel |first=Don P | url=http://www.mentallandscape.com/C_CatalogMars.htm | title=Soviet Mars Images |work=Don P. Mitchell Homepage |accessdate=2007-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mars 5 collected data for 22 orbits until a loss of pressurization in the transmitter housing ended the mission. About 60 images were returned over a nine-day period showing swaths of the area south of [[Valles Marineris]], from {{Coord|5|N|330|W|globe:Mars}} to {{Coord|20|S|130|W|globe:Mars}}.

===Mars 3MP===
In 1973 the speed required to place a spacecraft in an interplanetary trajectory had to be increased.  Thus the Proton could not deliver spacecraft with an orbiter and an attached lander to the necessary trajectory to reach Mars, as had been possible in 1971. To resolve this problem, four spacecraft were launched. The Mars 4 and 5 orbiters, which had been launched separately, were used to relay communications, and to complete mission objectives which would have been completed by landers. Two landers were launched with orbiter type buses (Mars 6 and 7), but without fuel to enter orbit of the Mars satellite.

====Mars 6====
{{Main|Mars 6}}
Mars 6 successfully lifted off on August 5, 1973, into an intermediate Earth orbit on a [[Proton-K]]/[[Blok D|D]] booster and then launched into a Mars transfer trajectory. Total fueled launch mass of the lander and bus was 3260&amp;nbsp;kg. It reached Mars on March 12, 1974. The descent module separated from the bus at a distance of 48,000&amp;nbsp;km from Mars. The bus continued on into a heliocentric orbit after passing within 1600&amp;nbsp;km of Mars. The descent module entered the atmosphere at 09:05:53 UT at a speed of 5.6&amp;nbsp;km/s. The parachute opened at 09:08:32 UT after the module had slowed its speed to 600&amp;nbsp;m/s by [[aerobraking]]. During this time the craft was collecting data and transmitting it directly to the bus for immediate relay to Earth. Contact with the descent module was lost at 09:11:05 UT in &quot;direct proximity to the surface&quot;, probably either when the retrorockets fired or when it hit the surface at an estimated 61&amp;nbsp;m/s. Mars 6 landed at {{Coord|23.90|S|19.42|W|globe:Mars}} in the [[Margaritifer Terra]] region of Mars. The landed mass was 635&amp;nbsp;kg. The descent module transmitted 224 seconds of data before transmissions ceased, the first data returned from the [[atmosphere of Mars]]. Much of the data was unreadable due to a flaw in a transistor which led to degradation of the system during its journey to Mars.

====Mars 7====
{{Main|Mars 7}}
Mars 7 successfully lifted off on August 9, 1973, into an intermediate Earth orbit on a Proton-K/D booster and then launched into a Mars transfer trajectory. Total fueled launch mass of the lander and bus was 3260&amp;nbsp;kg. It reached Mars on March 9, 1974. Due to a problem in the operation of one of the on-board systems (attitude control or retro-rockets) the landing probe separated prematurely (4 hours before encounter) and missed the planet by 1300&amp;nbsp;km. The early separation was probably due to a computer error which resulted from degradation of the systems during the trip to Mars. The intended landing site was {{Coord|50|S|28|W|globe:Mars}}. The lander and bus continued on into heliocentric orbits.

===Mars 4NM and 5NM===
The Mars 4NM and Mars 5NM projects would have seen heavier spacecraft launched by [[N1 (rocket)|N1]] rockets. They would have deployed heavy [[Marsokhod]] rovers onto the surface, and conducted [[sample return mission]]s. The N1 failed on all four of its test flights, and was never used to launch any Mars spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/213/50.shtml Советский грунт с Марса] {{in lang|ru}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304232912/http://www.novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/213/50.shtml |date=March 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mars 5M===
[[Mars 5M]] (Mars 79) was a sample return mission developed in 1977 to be double launched in 1979 by Proton launchers and then docked in Earth orbit for a joint flight of orbital and return modules to Mars. The project was canceled due to the low reliability of the [[Igla (spacecraft docking system)|Igla automatic docking system]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:ru:Марс-79|Марс-79]] {{in lang|ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Martian''' is an inhabitant of the planet [[Mars]] or a [[Colonization of Mars|human colonist on Mars]]. Although the search for evidence of [[life on Mars]] continues, many [[science fiction]] writers have imagined what [[extraterrestrial life]] on Mars might be like.

==Martians in fiction==
{{Further|Mars in fiction|History of science fiction}}

The earliest known instances of the word &quot;Martian&quot;, used as a noun instead of an adjective, were printed in late 1877. They appeared nearly simultaneously in England and the United States, in magazine articles detailing [[Asaph Hall]]'s discovery of the [[moons of Mars]] in August of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Peter Jensen|title=The World's First Martian|url=http://esnpc.blogspot.com/2014/03/the-worlds-first-martians-and-first.html|website=Early Sports and Pop Culture Blog|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next event to inspire the use of the noun ''Martian'' in print was the [[International Exposition of Electricity]], which was hosted in Paris in the year 1881. During the four months of the exhibition, many people visited to witness such technological marvels as the [[incandescent light bulb]] and the [[telephone]]. One visitor came away wondering what kind of world such innovations might engender in the next 200 years. Writing anonymously, s/he assembled some speculations in an essay titled &quot;The Year of Grace 2081&quot;, which enjoyed wide circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brown |first1=Peter Jensen |title=The Future as Seen from the Dawn of the Electrical Age |url=http://esnpc.blogspot.com/2014/03/the-future-as-seen-from-dawn-of.html |website=Early Sports 'n Pop-Culture Blog |access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Martians enter the story late in the narrative. During a rest from international conflict on Earth, humans begin telecommunicating with Martians. &quot;After a brief period passed in the exchange of polite messages&quot;, says the essayist, humans will decide to war with the Martians on some pretence of honor. The war that results is cataclysmic:

{{Quote|[Humans] will unite all their energies for the fabrication of mammoth engines which will discharge oceans of water, metal and fire right into the face of Mars.  In return, the Martians will pelt them with [[aerolith]]s weighing three thousand tons, which will chip whole mountains off the [[Himalayas]] and make a big hole where [[Mont Blanc]] now exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EcgcAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA382 |chapter=The Year of Grace 2081 |title=Truth: A Weekly Journal, Volume X (Nos. 236 to 260) |location=London |date=1881 |page=383 |access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

[[W. S. Lach-Szyrma]]'s novel ''[[Aleriel, or A Voyage to Other Worlds]]'' (1883) was previously reputed to be the first published work to apply the word ''Martian'' as a noun. The usage is incidental; it occurs when Aleriel, the novel's protagonist, lands on Mars in a spacecraft called an &quot;ether-car&quot; (an allusion to [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], which was once postulated as a gaseous medium in [[outer space]]). Aleriel buries the car in snow &quot;so that it might not be disturbed by any Martian who might come across it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blog.inkyfool.com/2010/09/wladyslaw-lach-szyrma-and-first-martian.html |date = 16 September 2010 |title = Wladyslaw Lach-Szyrma and the First Martian |first = Mark |last = Forsyth |website = The Inky Fool |accessdate = 4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:War of the Worlds original cover bw.jpg|thumb|''War of the Worlds'' reprinted in the August 1927 issue of ''[[Amazing Stories]]'']]
Fifteen years after Aleriel, [[H. G. Wells]]' landmark novel ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' (1898) was published by [[William Heinemann, Ltd.]], then a relatively new publishing house. The novel was revised numerous times,{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} and has since been translated into many languages. In the story, the [[Martian (The War of the Worlds)|Martians]] are a technologically advanced race of [[octopus]]-like [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrials]] who invade Earth because Mars is becoming too cold to sustain them. The Martians' undoing is a fatal vulnerability to Earth bacteria.

In his book ''Mars and Its Canals'' (1906), astronomer and businessman [[Percival Lowell]] conjectured that an extinct Martian race had once constructed a vast network of [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]] to channel water to their settlements from Mars' [[polar ice cap]]s, [[Planum Australe]] and [[Planum Boreum]]. Lowell did not invent this [[Martian canal]] hypothesis, but he supported it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Russel Wallace]] refuted Lowell's conjecture in his own book ''Is Mars Habitable?'' (1907), in which he argues that neither the [[atmosphere of Mars]] nor [[Climate of Mars|its climate]] could sustain life as we understand it.&lt;/ref&gt; The belief that Mars had [[canal]]s was based on observations [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] made through his [[reflecting telescope]]. Although the telescope's image was fuzzy, Schiaparelli thought he saw long, straight lines on the Martian surface; some astronomers came to believe that these lines were structures built by Martians. This idea inspired Lowell, who returned to the subject in ''Mars As the Abode of Life'' (1910), in which he wrote a fanciful description of what this Martian society may have been like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msss.com/http/ps/life/life.html |title=Life on Mars |last=Caplinger |first=Michael |date=April 1995 |website=msss.com |publisher=[[Malin Space Science Systems]] |accessdate=4 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527182311/http://www.msss.com/http/ps/life/life.html |archivedate=27 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although his description was based on almost no evidence, Lowell's words evoked vivid pictures in his readers' imaginations.

One of the people Lowell inspired was [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], who began writing his own story about Mars in the summer of 1911. The story is a [[planetary romance]] in which an [[American Civil War]] veteran named [[John Carter of Mars|John Carter]] is transported to Mars when he walks inside a cave on Earth. He finds that Mars is populated by two species of warring [[humanoid]]s, and he becomes embroiled in their conflict. In February 1912, an American [[pulp magazine]] called ''[[The All-Story]]'' published Burroughs' story as the first installment of a [[serial novel]], which the editor titled ''[[Under the Moons of Mars]]'' (retitled ''A Princess of Mars'' in subsequent editions). The book was the first in Burroughs' [[Barsoom]] series.

Although the noun ''Martian'' can describe any organism from Mars, these and later works typically imagine Martians as a humanoid monoculture. ''Martian'', in this sense, is more like the word ''human'' than the word ''[[Earthling]]''. (Few writers describe a [[biodiverse]] Mars.) In science fiction, Martians are stereotypically imagined in one or more of the following ways: as [[alien invader]]s; as humanoids with a civilization that resembles one on Earth; as [[anthropomorphic]] animals; as beings with superhuman abilities; as humanoids with a lower intelligence than humans; as human colonists who adopt a Martian identity; and/or as an extinct race who possessed high intelligence.

===Human colonists as Martians===
{{See also|Colonization of Mars|Colonialism|Cultural hegemony}}

Many of [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s Martian characters are humans born and raised on Mars. In ''[[Red Planet (novel)|Red Planet]]'' (1949), boys attend a [[boarding school]] in a human colony on Mars. A population of native Martians tolerates them until the colony administrator threatens a Martian child. The Martians demand that the humans leave Mars, but a human doctor convinces them to reconsider.

In Heinlein's 1956 novel ''[[Double Star]]'', humans have colonized the solar system, and a politician on Mars faces the [[civil rights]] issue of granting a native Martian species (who are [[second-class citizen]]s) the [[right to vote]].

In [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[Martian Time-Slip]]'' (1964), a human colony on Mars is trying to cope with arduous environmental conditions. They treat an aboriginal race, whom they call &quot;Bleekmen&quot;, with casual racism. In ''[[The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch]]'' (1965), Mars has no indigenous life. To cope with the sterile habitat, the human colonists abuse drugs such as &quot;Can-D&quot; and &quot;Chew-Z&quot;.

Dick previously published a shorter version of the story in 1963, called ''All We Marsmen''. Like Heinlein's ''Double Star'', ''All We Marsmen'' was conceived at a time in US history when many marginalized people were fighting especially vehemently for more civil rights. US President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] into law on 2 July 1964.{{ref|a|1}}

''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990) is a science fiction [[action film]] about an apparently unsophisticated [[construction worker]] who turns out to be a [[freedom fighter]] from Mars who has been relocated to Earth. He later learns of an alien artifact that proves Mars harbored life before the human colonization. The film, directed by [[Paul Verhoeven]] and starring [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], is based on the short story &quot;[[We Can Remember It for You Wholesale]]&quot; by [[Philip K. Dick]]. 

The character designers for ''[[Futurama]]'', a comical American [[animated series]], imagine Mars after human colonization as being like the [[American frontier]]; native Martians inhabit zones analogous to [[Indian reservation]]s. One of the series principal characters, [[Amy Wong]], is a scientist of Chinese descent who was born on Mars. Her parents have amassed an enormous fortune and enterprise there.

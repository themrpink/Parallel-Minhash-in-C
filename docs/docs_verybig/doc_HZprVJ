The average emissivity of the earth is readily estimated from available data. The emissivities of terrestrial surfaces are all in the range of 0.96 to 0.99&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icess.ucsb.edu/modis/EMIS/html/seawater.html|title=Seawater Samples - Emissivities|work=ucsb.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1175/JCLI3720.1 |vauthors=Jin M, Liang S |title=An Improved Land Surface Emissivity Parameter for Land Surface Models Using Global Remote Sensing Observations |journal=J.

This simple model readily determines the effect of changes in solar output or change of earth albedo or effective earth emissivity on average earth temperature. It says nothing, however about what might cause these things to change. Zero-dimensional models do not address the temperature distribution on the earth or the factors that move energy about the earth.

== Radiative-convective models ==

The zero-dimensional model above, using the solar constant and given average earth temperature, determines the effective earth emissivity of long wave radiation emitted to space. This can be refined in the vertical to a one-dimensional radiative-convective model, which considers two processes of energy transport:

* upwelling and downwelling radiative transfer through atmospheric layers that both absorb and emit infrared radiation
* upward transport of heat by convection (especially important in the lower [[troposphere]]).

The radiative-convective models have advantages over the simple model: they can determine the effects of varying [[greenhouse gas]] concentrations on effective emissivity and therefore the surface temperature. But added parameters are needed to determine local emissivity and albedo and address the factors that move energy about the earth.

== Higher-dimension models ==

The zero-dimensional model may be expanded to consider the energy transported horizontally in the atmosphere. This kind of model may well be [[Zonal and meridional|zonally]] averaged. This model has the advantage of allowing a rational dependence of local albedo and emissivity on temperature – the poles can be allowed to be icy and the equator warm – but the lack of true dynamics means that horizontal transports have to be specified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shodor.org/master/environmental/general/energy/application.html|title=Energy Balance Models|work=shodor.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== EMICs (Earth-system models of intermediate complexity) ==
{{Main|Earth systems model of intermediate complexity}}
Depending on the nature of questions asked and the pertinent time scales, there are, on the one extreme,  conceptual, more inductive models, and, on the other extreme, [[general circulation model]]s operating at the highest spatial and temporal resolution currently feasible. Models of intermediate complexity bridge the gap. One example is the Climber-3 model. Its atmosphere is a 2.5-dimensional statistical-dynamical model with 7.5° × 22.5° resolution and time step of half a day;  the ocean is MOM-3 ([[Modular Ocean Model]]) with a 3.75° × 3.75° grid and 24 vertical levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pik-potsdam.de/emics/|title=emics1|work=pik-potsdam.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== GCMs (global climate models or general circulation models) ==
{{Main|General Circulation Model}}

General Circulation Models (GCMs) discretise the equations for fluid motion and energy transfer and integrate these over time. Unlike simpler models, GCMs divide the atmosphere and/or oceans into grids of discrete &quot;cells&quot;, which represent computational units. Unlike simpler models which make mixing assumptions, processes internal to a cell—such as convection—that occur on scales too small to be resolved directly are parameterised at the cell level, while other functions govern the interface between cells.

Atmospheric GCMs (AGCMs) model the atmosphere and impose [[sea surface temperature]]s as boundary conditions. Coupled atmosphere-ocean GCMs (AOGCMs, e.g. [[HadCM3]], [[EdGCM]], [[GFDL CM2.X]], ARPEGE-Climat)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/gmgec/site_engl/arpege/arpege_en.html ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215849/http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/gmgec/site_engl/arpege/arpege_en.html |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; combine the two models. The first general circulation climate model that combined both oceanic and atmospheric processes was developed in the late 1960s at the [[NOAA]] [[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/breakthroughs/climate_model/welcome.html|title=NOAA 200th Top Tens: Breakthroughs: The First Climate Model|work=noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; AOGCMs represent the pinnacle of complexity in climate models and internalise as many processes as possible. However, they are still under development and uncertainties remain.  They may be coupled to models of other processes, such as the [[carbon cycle]], so as to better model feedback effects. Such integrated multi-system models are sometimes referred to as either &quot;earth system models&quot; or &quot;global climate models.&quot;

== Research and development ==

There are three major types of institution where climate models are developed, implemented and used:

* National meteorological services. Most national weather services have a [[climatology]] section.
* Universities. Relevant departments include atmospheric sciences, meteorology, climatology, and geography.
* National and international research laboratories. Examples include the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] (NCAR, in [[Boulder, Colorado]], USA), the [[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory]] (GFDL, in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], USA), [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], the [[Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research]] (in [[Exeter]], UK), the [[Max Planck Institute for Meteorology]] in Hamburg, Germany, or the [[Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement|Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement]] (LSCE), France, to name but a few.

The [[World Climate Research Programme]] (WCRP), hosted by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO), coordinates research activities on climate modelling worldwide.

A 2012 [[U.S. National Research Council]] report discussed how the large and diverse U.S. climate modeling enterprise could evolve to become more unified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=U.S. National Research Council Report, ''A National Strategy for Advancing Climate Modeling'' | url=http://dels.nas.edu/Report/National-Strategy-Advancing-Climate/13430 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Efficiencies could be gained by developing a common software infrastructure shared by all U.S. climate researchers, and holding an annual climate modeling forum, the report found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=U.S. National Research Council Report-in-Brief, ''A National Strategy for Advancing Climate Modeling'' | url=http://dels.nas.edu/Materials/Report-In-Brief/4291-Climate-Modeling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NASA graphic representing the distribution of solar radiation.jpg|thumb|NASA graphic representing the distribution of solar radiation]]
'''Cloud albedo''' is a measure of the [[albedo]] of a [[cloud]]. Higher values indicate that a cloud reflects a larger amount of [[solar radiation]] and [[Transmittance|transmits]] a smaller amount of radiation.  Cloud albedo depends on the total mass of water, the size and shape of the droplets or particles and their distribution in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theweatherprediction.com/habyhints3/758/|title=CLOUD ALBEDO EFFECT|website=www.theweatherprediction.com|access-date=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Physical Climatology|last=Hartmann|first=Dennis|publisher=ELSEVIER|isbn=978-0-12-328531-7|location=Australia|pages=76–78|date=2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloud albedo, along with the [[greenhouse effect]] of clouds, strongly influence the [[Earth's energy budget]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Clouds/|title=Clouds &amp; Radiation Fact Sheet : Feature Articles|last=Steve|first=Graham|date=1999-03-01|website=earthobservatory.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thick clouds (such as [[stratocumulus]]) reflect a large amount of incoming solar radiation, meaning they have a high albedo.  Thin clouds (such as [[Cirrus cloud|Cirrus]]) tend to transmit most solar radiation, so have low albedo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Library/Clouds/|title=EO Library: Clouds &amp; Radiation Fact Sheet|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=2008-10-15|date=March 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/cchen/Latham_et_al_2008.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== What can change cloud albedo? ==
Cloud albedo varies from less than 10% to more than 90% and depends on drop sizes, liquid [[water]] or ice content, thickness of the cloud, and the [[sun]]'s [[zenith angle]].

=== Liquid Water Path (LWP) ===
Studies have shown that cloud liquid water path varies with changing cloud droplet size, which may alter the behavior of clouds and their albedo.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Han|first=Qingyuan|last2=Rossow|first2=William B.|last3=Chou|first3=Joyce|last4=Welch|first4=Ronald M.|date=1998-07-01|title=Global Survey of the Relationships of Cloud Albedo and Liquid Water Path with Droplet Size Using ISCCP|journal=Journal of Climate|volume=11|issue=7|pages=1516–1528|doi=10.1175/1520-0442(1998)011&lt;1516:GSOTRO&gt;2.0.CO;2|issn=0894-8755|bibcode=1998JCli...11.1516H|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variations of the albedo of typical clouds in the atmosphere are dominated by the column amount of liquid water and ice in the cloud.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  The smaller the drops and the greater the liquid water content, the greater the cloud albedo, if all other factors are the same.

=== The Twomey Effect (Aerosol Indirect Effect) ===
Addition of cloud nuclei by pollution can lead to an increase in solar radiation reflected by clouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Twomey|first=S.|date=May 1974|title=Pollution and the Planetary Albedo|url=|journal=Pollution and Planetary Albedo|volume=|pages=1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing aerosol concentration and aerosol density increases cloud droplet concentration, decreases cloud droplet size, and increases cloud albedo.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; In macrophysically identical clouds, a cloud with few larger drops will have a lower albedo than a cloud with more smaller drops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atmos.washington.edu/~robwood/teaching/591/ATMS_591_Twomey_1977.pdf|title=The Twomey Effect|last=Wood|first=Rob|date=|website=atmos.washington.edu|access-date=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zenith Angle ===
The cloud albedo increases with the total water content or depth of the cloud and with the [[solar zenith angle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The variation of albedo with zenith angle is most rapid when the sun is near the horizon, and least when the sun is overhead. Absorption of solar radiation by plane-parallel clouds decreases with increasing zenith angle because radiation that is reflected to space at the higher zenith angles penetrates less deeply into the cloud and is therefore less likely to be absorbed.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

{{Weather}}

In [[meteorology]], a '''cloud''' is an [[aerosol]] consisting of a visible mass of minute [[liquid]] [[drop (liquid)|droplets]], [[ice crystals|frozen crystals]], or other [[particulates|particles]] suspended in the [[atmosphere]] of a [[planet]]ary body or similar space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Weather Terms |url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/box/glossary.htm |publisher=[[National Weather Service]] |access-date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Water]] or various other chemicals may compose the droplets and crystals. On [[Earth]], clouds are formed as a result of saturation of the air when it is cooled to its [[dew point]], or when it gains sufficient moisture (usually in the form of [[water vapor]]) from an adjacent source to raise the dew point to the ambient temperature.

They are seen in the Earth's [[homosphere]], which includes the [[troposphere]], [[stratosphere]], and [[mesosphere]]. '''Nephology''' is the science of clouds, which is undertaken in the [[cloud physics]] branch of [[meteorology]].  There are two methods of naming clouds in their respective layers of the homosphere, Latin and common. 

Genus types in the troposphere, the atmospheric layer closest to Earth's surface, have [[Latin]] names due to the universal adoption of [[Luke Howard]]'s [[nomenclature]] that was formally proposed in 1802.  It became the basis of a modern international system that divides clouds into five physical ''forms'' which can be further divided or classified into altitude ''levels'' to derive ten basic ''genera''. The main representative cloud types for each of these forms are [[stratus cloud|stratus]], [[cirrus cloud|cirrus]], [[stratocumulus cloud|stratocumulus]], [[cumulus cloud|cumulus]], and [[cumulonimbus cloud|cumulonimbus]].  ''Low-level''  clouds do not have any altitude-related prefixes.  However ''mid-level'' stratiform and stratocumuliform types are given the prefix ''alto-'' while ''high-level'' variants of these same two forms carry the prefix ''cirro-''. Genus types with sufficient vertical extent to occupy more than one level do not carry any altitude related prefixes.  They are classified formally as low- or mid-level depending on the altitude at which each initially forms, and are also more informally characterized as ''multi-level'' or ''vertical''.   Most of the ten genera derived by this method of classification can be subdivided into ''species'' and further subdivided into ''varieties''. Very low stratiform clouds that extend down to the Earth's surface are given the common names ''fog'' and ''mist'', but have no Latin names.

In the stratosphere and mesosphere, clouds have common names for their main types. They may have the appearance of  stratiform veils or sheets, cirriform wisps, or stratocumuliform bands or ripples. They are seen infrequently, mostly in the polar regions of Earth. Clouds have been observed in the atmospheres of other [[planet]]s and [[Natural satellite|moons]] in the [[Solar System]] and beyond. However, due to their different temperature characteristics, they are often composed of other substances such as [[methane]], [[ammonia]], and [[sulfuric acid]], as well as water.

Tropospheric clouds can have a direct effect on climate change on Earth.  They may reflect incoming rays from the sun which can contribute to a cooling effect where and when these clouds occur, or trap longer wave radiation that reflects back up from the Earth's surface which can cause a warming effect.  The altitude, form, and thickness of the clouds are the main factors that affect the local heating or cooling of Earth and the atmosphere.  Clouds that form above the troposphere are too scarce and too thin to have any influence on climate change.

The tabular overview that follows is very broad in scope. It draws from several methods of cloud classification, both formal and informal, used in different levels of the Earth's homosphere by a number of cited authorities. Despite some differences in nomenclature, the classification schemes seen in this article can be combined by using an informal cross-classification of physical forms and altitude levels to derive the 10 tropospheric genera, the fog and mist that forms at surface level, and several additional major types above the troposphere. The cumulus genus includes four species that indicate vertical size and structure which can affect both forms and levels. This table should not be seen as a strict or singular classification, but as an illustration of how various major cloud types are related to each other and defined through a full range of altitude levels from Earth's surface to the &quot;edge of space.&quot;

== Etymology and history of cloud science and nomenclature ==
{{Main|Timeline of meteorology }}

===Etymology===
The origin of the term &quot;cloud&quot; can be found in the [[Old English]] words ''clud'' or ''clod'', meaning a hill or a mass of rock. Around the beginning of the 13th century, the word came to be used as a metaphor for rain clouds, because of the similarity in appearance between a mass of rock and cumulus heap cloud. Over time, the metaphoric usage of the word supplanted the Old English ''{{lang|ang|weolcan}}'', which had been the literal term for clouds in general.&lt;ref name=Harper&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cloud |title=Cloud |author=Harper, Douglas |year=2012 |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/cloud |title=Cloud |website=The Free Dictionary |publisher=Farlex |access-date=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aristotle ===

Ancient cloud studies were not made in isolation, but were observed in combination with other [[weather]] elements and even other natural sciences. Around 340 BC, Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] wrote ''[[Meteorologica]]'', a work which represented the sum of knowledge of the time about natural science, including weather and climate. For the first time, precipitation and the clouds from which precipitation fell were called meteors, which originate from the Greek word ''meteoros'', meaning 'high in the sky'. From that word came the modern term [[meteorology]], the study of clouds and weather. ''Meteorologica'' was based on intuition and simple observation, but not on what is now considered the scientific method. Nevertheless, it was the first known work that attempted to treat a broad range of meteorological topics in a systematic way, especially the [[hydrological cycle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Meteorologica&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frisinger |first=H.

===First comprehensive classification===

After centuries of speculative theories about the formation and behavior of clouds, the first truly scientific studies were undertaken by [[Luke Howard]] in England and [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] in France. Howard was a methodical observer with a strong grounding in the Latin language, and used his background to classify the various tropospheric cloud types during 1802. He believed that the changing cloud forms in the sky could unlock the key to weather forecasting. Lamarck had worked independently on cloud classification the same year and had come up with a different naming scheme that failed to make an impression even in his home country of [[France]] because it used unusual French names for cloud types. His system of nomenclature included 12 categories of clouds, with such names as (translated from French) hazy clouds, dappled clouds, and broom-like clouds. By contrast, Howard used universally accepted Latin, which caught on quickly after it was published in 1803.&lt;ref name=&quot;Preface&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=International Cloud Atlas, preface to the 1939 edition |volume=I |year=1975 |url=https://archive.org/details/manualonobservat00worl/page/ |pages=[https://archive.org/details/manualonobservat00worl/page/ IX–XIII] |isbn=978-92-63-10407-6 |access-date=6 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a sign of the popularity of the naming scheme, German dramatist and poet [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] composed four poems about clouds, dedicating them to Howard. An elaboration of Howard's system was eventually formally adopted by the International Meteorological Conference in 1891.&lt;ref name=&quot;Preface&quot;/&gt; This system covered only the tropospheric cloud types, but the discovery of clouds above the troposphere during the late 19th century eventually led to the creation of separate classification schemes using common names for these very high clouds, which were still broadly similar to some cloud forms identified in the troposphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polar-stratospheric&quot;/&gt;

The inhabitants of Moldavia were Christians. Archaeological works revealed the remains of a Christian necropolis at Mihălășeni, Botoșani county, from the 5th century. The place of worship, and the tombs had Christian characteristics. The place of worship had a rectangular form with sides of eight and seven meters. Similar necropolises and places of worship were found at Nicolina, in Iași&lt;ref&gt;Octavian-Liviu Șovan, Zorile creștinismului în nord-estul Moldovei-repere arheologice, Revista Forum cultural, Anul V, nr.4, decembrie 2005 (19)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bolokhoveni|Bolohoveni]], is mentioned by the Hypatian Chronicle in the 13th century. The chronicle shows that this{{which one|date=March 2019}} land is bordered on the principalities of Halych, Volhynia and Kiev. Archaeological research also identified the location of 13th-century fortified settlements in this region.{{which one|date=March 2019}} Alexandru V.

Boldur, Istoria Basarabiei, Editura V. Frunza, p 111-119&lt;/ref&gt; The Bolohoveni disappeared from chronicles after their defeat in 1257 by [[Daniel of Galicia]]'s troops. Their ethnic identity is uncertain; although Romanian scholars, basing on their ethnonym identify them as [[Romanians]] (who were called [[Vlachs]] in the [[Middle Ages]]), archeological evidence and the ''[[Hypatian Chronicle]]'' (which is the only [[primary source]] that documents their history) suggest that they were a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic people]].{{sfn|Spinei|1986|p=57}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Bolokhovians&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Bolokhovians |url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages\B\O\Bolokhovians.htm |encyclopedia=Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine |publisher=Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies |year=2001 |accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 13th century, the ''[[Brodnici|Brodniks]]'', a possible [[Slavs|Slavic]]&amp;ndash;[[Vlachs|Vlach]] [[vassal]] state of [[Halych-Volhynia|Halych]], were present, alongside the Vlachs, in much of the region's territory (towards 1216, the Brodniks are mentioned as in service of [[Vladimir-Suzdal|Suzdal]]).

Somewhere in the 11th century, a [[Viking]] named Rodfos [[Blakumen|was killed by Vlachs]] presumably in the area of what would become Moldavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vikingart.com/VArt/PS_Sjonhem.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20060616225750/http://www.vikingart.com/VArt/PS_Sjonhem.htm |archivedate=2006-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1164, the future [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine emperor]] [[Andronikos I Komnenos]], was taken prisoner by Vlach shepherds in the same region.

Friar [[William of Rubruck]], who visited the court of the Great Khan in the 1250s, listed &quot;the Blac&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jackson|2009|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Vlachs, among the peoples who paid tribute to the Mongols, but the Vlachs' territory is uncertain.{{sfn|Sălăgean|2005|p=196}}{{sfn|Spinei|1986|p=131}} Rubruck described &quot;Blakia&quot; as &quot;[[Asen dynasty|Assan's]] territory&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jackson|2009|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; south of the Lower Danube, showing that he [[Bulgarian lands across the Danube|identified it with the northern regions]] of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]].{{sfn|Vásáry|2005|p=30}}
Later in the 14th century, King [[Charles I of Hungary]] attempted to expand his realm and the influence of the [[Catholic Church]] eastwards after the fall of Cuman rule, and ordered a campaign under the command of [[Phynta de Mende]] (1324). In 1342 and 1345, the Hungarians were victorious in a battle against [[Tatars|Tatar-Mongols]]; the conflict was resolved by the death of [[Jani Beg]], in 1357. The Polish chronicler [[Jan Długosz]] mentioned Moldavians (under the name ''Wallachians'') as having joined a military expedition in 1342, under King [[Władysław I the Elbow-high|Władysław I]], against the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Annals of Jan Długosz'', p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1353, [[Dragoș]], mentioned as a Vlach ''[[Knyaz]]'' in [[Maramureș]], was sent by [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]] to establish a line of defense against the [[Golden Horde]] forces of Mongols on the [[Siret River]]. This expedition resulted in a polity vassal to Hungary, in the [[Baia]] (''Târgul Moldovei'' or ''Moldvabánya'') region.

[[Bogdan I of Moldavia|Bogdan of Cuhea]], another Vlach [[voivode]] from Maramureș who had fallen out with the Hungarian king, crossed the Carpathians in 1359, took control of Moldavia, and succeeded in removing Moldavia from Hungarian control. His realm extended north to the [[Cheremosh River]], while the southern part of Moldavia was still occupied by the Tatar Mongols.

After first residing in Baia, Bogdan moved Moldavia's seat to [[Siret]] (it was to remain there until [[Petru II of Moldavia|Petru II Mușat]] moved it to [[Suceava]]; it was finally moved to [[Iași|Iași (Jassy)]] under [[Alexandru Lăpușneanu]] - in 1565). The area around Suceava, roughly correspondent to future [[Bukovina]], would later constitute one of the two administrative divisions of the new realm, under the name ''Țara de Sus'' (the &quot;Upper Land&quot;), whereas the rest, on both sides of the [[Prut]] river, formed ''Țara de Jos'' (the &quot;Lower Land&quot;).

Disfavored by the brief union of [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty|Angevin Poland]] and Hungary (the latter was still the country's overlord), Bogdan's successor [[Lațcu of Moldavia|Lațcu]] accepted [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] around 1370. Despite the founding of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Siret]], this move did not have any lasting consequences. Despite remaining officially [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and culturally connected with the [[Byzantine Empire]] after 1382, princes of the [[House of Bogdan-Mușat]] entered a conflict with the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople Patriarchy]] over control of appointments to the newly founded [[Metropolitan of Moldavia|Moldavian Metropolitan seat]]; [[Patriarch Antony IV of Constantinople|Patriarch Antony IV]] even cast an [[anathema]] over Moldavia after [[Roman I of Moldavia|Roman I]] expelled his appointee back to Byzantium. The crisis was finally settled in favor of the Moldavian princes under [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander I]]. Nevertheless, religious policy remained complex: while conversions to faiths other than Orthodox were discouraged (and forbidden for princes), Moldavia included sizable Roman Catholic communities (Germans and [[Magyars]]), as well as [[Armenian Apostolic Church|non-Chalcedonic]] [[Armenians in Romania|Armenians]]; after 1460, the country welcomed [[Hussite]] refugees (founders of [[Ciuburciu]] and, probably, [[Huși]]).

The principality of Moldavia covered the entire geographic region of Moldavia. In various periods, various other territories were politically connected with the Moldavian principality. This is the case of the province of [[Pokuttya]], the fiefdoms of [[Cetatea de Baltă]] and [[Ciceu]] (both in [[Transylvania]]) or, at a later date, the territories between the Dniester and the Bug rivers.

Petru II profited from the end of the Hungarian-Polish union and moved the country closer to the [[History of Poland during the Jagiellon dynasty|Jagiellon realm]], becoming a [[Vassalage|vassal]] of [[Władysław II Jagiełło|Władysław II]] on September 26, 1387. This gesture was to have unexpected consequences: Petru supplied the Polish ruler with funds needed in the war against the [[Teutonic Knights]], and was granted control over [[Pokuttya]] until the debt was to be repaid; as this is not recorded to have been carried out, the region became disputed by the two states, until it was lost by Moldavia in the [[Battle of Obertyn]] (1531). Prince Petru also expanded his rule southwards to the [[Danube Delta]]. His brother Roman I conquered the Hungarian-ruled [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi|Cetatea Albă]] in 1392, giving Moldavia an outlet to the [[Black Sea]], before being toppled from the throne for supporting [[Fyodor Koriatovych]] in his conflict with [[Vytautas the Great]] of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]]. Under [[Stephen I of Moldavia|Stephen I]], growing Polish influence was challenged by [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Hungary]], whose expedition was defeated at [[Ghindăoani]] in 1385; however, Stephen disappeared in mysterious circumstances.

Although [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander I]] was brought to the throne in 1400 by the Hungarians (with assistance from [[Mircea I of Wallachia]]), he shifted his allegiances towards Poland (notably engaging Moldavian forces on the Polish side in the [[Battle of Grunwald]] and the [[Siege of Marienburg (1410)|Siege of Marienburg]]), and placed his own choice of rulers in Wallachia. His reign was one of the most successful in Moldavia's history, but also saw the very first confrontation with the [[Ottoman Turks]] at Cetatea Albă in 1420, and later even a conflict with the Poles. A deep crisis was to follow Alexandru's long reign, with his successors battling each other in a succession of wars that divided the country until the murder of [[Bogdan II of Moldavia|Bogdan II]] and the ascension of [[Peter III Aaron|Petru III Aron]] in 1451. Nevertheless, Moldavia was subject to further Hungarian interventions after that moment, as [[Matthias Corvinus]] deposed Aron and backed [[Alexăndrel]] to the throne in [[Suceava]]. Petru Aron's rule also signified the beginning of Moldavia's [[Ottoman Empire]] allegiance, as the ruler agreed to pay [[tribute]] to Sultan [[Mehmed II]].

===Late Middle Ages===

{{See also|Moldavian–Ottoman Wars}}

Under [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]], who took the throne and subsequently came to an agreement with [[Kazimierz IV Jagiellon|Casimir IV of Poland]] in 1457, the state reached its most glorious period. Stephen blocked Hungarian interventions in the [[Battle of Baia]], invaded Wallachia in 1471, and dealt with Ottoman reprisals in a major victory (the 1475 [[Battle of Vaslui]]); after feeling threatened by Polish ambitions, he also attacked [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and resisted Polish reprisals in the [[Battle of the Cosmin Forest]] (1497). However, he had to surrender [[Kiliya, Ukraine|Chilia]] (Kiliya) and Cetatea Albă ([[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi]]), the two main fortresses in the [[Budjak]], to the Ottomans in 1484, and in 1498 he had to accept Ottoman suzerainty, when he was forced to agree to continue paying tribute to Sultan [[Bayezid II]]. Following the taking of [[Khotyn|Hotin]] (Khotyn) and [[Pokuttya]], Stephen's rule also brought a brief extension of Moldavian rule into [[Transylvania]]: Cetatea de Baltă and [[Ciceu]] became his [[Fiefdom|fiefs]] in 1489.

[[File:Khotyn 3.jpg|thumb|[[Khotyn Fortress]] on the [[Dniester]] River, present-day [[Ukraine]], then bordering the northern frontier of the Moldavian Principality and southern [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]]]

Under [[Bogdan III the One-Eyed]], Ottoman overlordship was confirmed in the shape that would rapidly evolve into control over Moldavia's affairs. [[Peter IV Rareș]], who reigned in the 1530s and 1540s, clashed with the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] over his ambitions in Transylvania (losing possessions in the region to [[George Martinuzzi]]), was defeated in Pokuttya by Poland, and failed in his attempt to extricate Moldavia from Ottoman rule – the country lost [[Bender, Moldova|Bender]] to the Ottomans, who included it in their [[Silistra Eyalet]].

A period of profound crisis followed. Moldavia stopped issuing its own coinage circa 1520, under [[Stephen IV of Moldavia|Prince Ștefăniță]], when it was confronted with rapid depletion of funds and rising demands from the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]]. Such problems became endemic when the country, brought into the [[Great Turkish War]], suffered the impact of the [[stagnation of the Ottoman Empire]]; at one point, during the 1650s and 1660s, princes began relying on [[counterfeit]] coinage (usually copies of [[Swedish riksdaler]]s, as was that issued by [[Eustratie Dabija]]). The economic decline was accompanied by a failure to maintain state structures: the [[Feudalism|feudal]]-based [[Moldavian military forces]] were no longer convoked, and the few troops maintained by the rulers remained professional [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] such as the ''[[seimeni]]''.

[[File:Jassy (Iasi)-Trei Ierarhi Monastery (J.Rey, 1845).jpg|thumb|left|[[Trei Ierarhi Monastery]] in Iași, housed the [[Vasilian College]], an institution of higher learning founded in 1640]]
[[File:Mihai 1600.png|thumb|left|In 1600, [[Michael the Brave]] became Prince of Wallachia, of Transylvania, and of Moldavia.]]

However, Moldavia and the similarly affected Wallachia remained both important sources of income for the Ottoman Empire and relatively prosperous agricultural economies (especially as suppliers of grain and cattle – the latter was especially relevant in Moldavia, which remained an under-populated country of [[pasture]]s). In time, much of the resources were tied to the [[Economic history of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman economy]], either through [[Monopoly|monopolies]] on trade that were only lifted in 1829, after the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] (which did not affect all domains directly), or through the raise in direct taxes - the one demanded by the Ottomans from the princes, as well as the ones demanded by the princes from the country's population. Taxes were directly proportional with Ottoman requests, but also with the growing importance of Ottoman appointment and sanctioning of princes in front of election by the [[boyar]]s and the boyar Council – ''{{ill|Sfatul boieresc|ro|Sfatul domnesc}}'' (drawing in a competition among pretenders, which also implied the intervention of creditors as suppliers of bribes). The fiscal system soon included taxes such as the ''[[Historical Romanian taxes|văcărit]]'' (a tax on head of cattle), first introduced by [[Iancu Sasul]] in the 1580s.

The economic opportunities offered brought about a significant influx of [[Greeks in Romania|Greek]] and [[Levant]]ine financiers and officials, who entered a stiff competition with the high boyars over appointments to the Court. As the [[Manorialism|manor system]] suffered the blows of economic crises, and in the absence of [[Salary|salarisation]] (which implied that persons in office could decide their own income), obtaining princely appointment became the major focus of a boyar's career. Such changes also implied the decline of free peasantry and the rise of [[serfdom]], as well as the rapid fall in the importance of low boyars (a traditional institution, the latter soon became marginal, and, in more successful instances, added to the population of towns); however, they also implied a rapid transition towards a [[monetary economy]], based on exchanges in foreign currency. Serfdom was doubled by the much less numerous slave population (''robi''), composed of migrant [[Roma in Romania|Roma]] and captured [[Nogais]].

[[File:Partitions of Moldavia.jpg|thumb|Moldavia through the ages]]

The conflict between princes and boyars was to become exceptionally violent – the latter group, who frequently appealed to the Ottoman court in order to have princes comply with its demands, was persecuted by rulers such as [[Alexandru Lăpușneanu]] and [[John III the Terrible|John III]]. Ioan Vodă's revolt against the Ottomans ended in his execution (1574). The country descended into political chaos, with frequent Ottoman and [[Tatars|Tatar]] incursions and pillages. The claims of Mușatins to the crown and the traditional system of succession were ended by scores of illegitimate reigns; one of the usurpers, [[Ioan Iacob Heraclid]], was a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Greek who encouraged the [[Renaissance]] and attempted to introduce [[Lutheranism]] to Moldavia.

In 1595, the rise of the [[Movilești]] boyars to the throne with [[Ieremia Movilă]] coincided with the start of frequent anti-Ottoman and anti-[[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] military expeditions of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] into Moldavian territory (see ''[[Moldavian Magnate Wars]]''), and rivalries between pretenders to the Moldavian throne encouraged by the three competing powers.

The Wallachian prince [[Michael the Brave]], after previously taking over [[Transylvania]], also deposed Prince Ieremia Movilă, in 1600, and managed to become the first Prince to rule over Moldavia, Wallachia, and Transylvania;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/379802/Michael Michael the Brave] at [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;White2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=George W.

Polish incursions were dealt a blow by the Ottomans during the 1620 [[Battle of Cecora (1620)|Battle of Cecora]], which also saw an end to the reign of [[Gaspar Graziani]].

A period of relative peace followed during the more prosperous and prestigious rule of [[Vasile Lupu]]. He took the throne as a boyar appointee in 1637 and began battling his rival [[Gheorghe Ștefan]], as well as the Wallachian prince [[Matei Basarab]]. However, his invasion of Wallachia, with the backing of [[Cossack]] [[Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks|Hetman]] [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], ended in disaster at the [[Battle of Finta]] in 1653. A few years later, Moldavia was occupied for two short intervals by the anti-Ottoman Wallachian prince [[Constantin Șerban]], who clashed with the first ruler of the [[Ghica family]], [[George Ghica]]. In the early 1680s, Moldavian troops under [[George Ducas]] intervened in [[right-bank Ukraine]] and assisted [[Mehmed IV]] in the [[Battle of Vienna]], only to suffer the effects of the [[Great Turkish War]].

===Phanariots (1711–1822)===
{{Main|Phanariotes|History of the Russo-Turkish wars}}
[[File:Principati1786.jpg|thumb|The Principalities of Moldavia and [[Wallachia]] in 1782, Italian map by G. Pittori, since the geographer Giovanni Antonio Rizzi Zannoni]]
[[File:Siege and capture of Jassy in 1788 by the Russian army.jpg|thumb|The siege and capture of [[Iași|Iași (Jassy)]] in 1788 by the Russian Army]]

During the late 17th century, Moldavia became the target of the [[Russian Empire]]'s southwards expansion, inaugurated by [[Peter the Great]] with the [[Pruth River Campaign|Russo-Turkish War of 1710-1711]]. Prince [[Dimitrie Cantemir]] sided with Peter in open rebellion against the Ottomans, but he was defeated at [[Stănilești]]. Sultan [[Ahmed III]] officially discarded recognition of local choices for princes, imposing instead a system relying solely on Ottoman approval: the [[Phanariotes|Phanariote epoch]], inaugurated by the reign of [[Nicholas Mavrocordatos]].

Phanariote rule was marked by [[political corruption]], intrigue, and high taxation, as well as by sporadic incursions of Habsburg and Russian armies deep into Moldavian territory. Nonetheless, they also attempted legislative and administrative modernization inspired by [[Age of Enlightenment|The Enlightenment]] (such as the decision by [[Constantine Mavrocordatos]] to salarize public offices, to the outrage of boyars, and the abolition of serfdom in 1749, as well as [[Scarlat Callimachi (hospodar)|Scarlat Callimachi]]'s ''Code''), and signified a decrease in Ottoman demands after the threat of Russian annexation became real and the prospects of a better life led to waves of peasant emigration to neighboring lands. The effects of Ottoman control were also made less notable after the 1774 [[Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca]] allowed Russia to intervene in favour of Ottoman subjects of the Eastern Orthodox faith - leading to campaigns of petitioning by the Moldavian boyars against princely policies.

In 1712, [[Khotyn|Hotin]] was taken over by the Ottomans and became part of a defensive system that Moldavian princes were required to maintain, as well as an area for Islamic [[colonization]] (the [[Laz people|Laz]] community).

[[File:Rom1793-1812.png|thumb|The Principality of Moldavia, 1793–1812, highlighted in orange]]

In 1775 Moldavia lost to the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] its northwestern part, which became known as [[Bukovina]]. For Moldavia, it meant both an important territorial loss and a major blow to the cattle trade, as the region stood on the trade route to Central Europe.

The [[Treaty of Jassy]] in 1792 forced the Ottoman Empire to cede [[Yedisan]] to the Russian Empire, which made Russian presence much more notable, given that the Empire acquired a common border with Moldavia. The first effect of this was the cession of the eastern half of Moldavia (renamed as [[Bessarabia]]) to the Russian Empire in 1812.

===Organic Statute, 1848 revolution===
{{Main|National awakening of Romania|Regulamentul Organic|Moldavian Revolution of 1848|Wallachian Revolution of 1848}}
[[File:Statuia lui Ştefan cel Mare din Iaşi1.jpg|thumb|left|Iași, [[Palace of Culture (Iași)|Princely Palace]] of Moldavia]]

Phanariote rule was officially ended after the 1821 occupation of the country by [[Alexander Ypsilantis]]'s [[Filiki Eteria]] during the [[Greek War of Independence]]; the subsequent Ottoman retaliation led to the rule of [[Ioan Sturdza]]. He was considered the first of a new system, since the Ottomans and Russia had agreed in 1826 to allow for the election by locals of rulers over the two [[Danubian Principalities]], and convened on their mandating for seven-year terms. In practice, a new foundation to reigns in Moldavia was created by the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)]], beginning a period of Russian domination over the two countries which ended only in 1856. Begun as a military occupation under the command of [[Pavel Kiselyov]], Russian domination gave Wallachia and Moldavia, which were not removed from nominal Ottoman control, the modernizing ''[[Regulamentul Organic|Organic Statute]]'' (the first document resembling a [[constitution]], as well as the first to regard both principalities). After 1829, the country also became an important destination for [[immigration]] of [[Ashkenazi Jews]] from the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]] and areas of Russia (''see [[History of the Jews in Romania]] and [[Sudiți]]'').

[[File:Obeliscul cu lei Iasi 02.JPG|thumb|Iași, [[Copou Park|Obelisk of Lions]] (1834), dedicated to the Organic Statute]]

The first Moldavian rule established under the Statute, that of [[Mihail Sturdza]], was nonetheless ambivalent: eager to reduce abuse of office, Sturdza introduced reforms (the abolition of slavery, [[secularization]], economic rebuilding), but he was widely seen as enforcing his own power over that of the newly instituted consultative Assembly. A supporter of the union of his country with Wallachia and of Romanian [[Romantic nationalism]], he obtained the establishment of a [[customs union]] between the two countries (1847) and showed support for [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] projects favored by low boyars; nevertheless, he clamped down with noted violence the [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|Moldavian revolutionary attempt]] in the last days of March 1848. [[Grigore Alexandru Ghica]] allowed the exiled revolutionaries to return to Moldavia c. 1853, which led to the creation of the [[National Party (Romania)|National Party]] ({{lang|ro|Partida Națională}}), a trans-boundary group of radical union supporters which campaigned for a single state under a foreign dynasty.

===Southern Bessarabia===

[[File:Rom1856-1859.png|thumb|Moldavia (in orange) after 1856]]
In 1856, under the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], the Russian Empire returned to Moldavia a significant territory in southern [[Bessarabia Governorate|Bessarabia]] (including a part of [[Budjak]]), organised later as the [[Bolgrad]], [[Cahul]], and [[Izmail|Ismail]] counties.&lt;ref name=king23-hitch41&gt;King, p.22-23; Hitchins, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Union with Wallachia===

Russian domination ended abruptly after the [[Crimean War]], when the Treaty of Paris also passed the two Romanian principalities under the tutelage of [[Great power|Great European Powers]] (together with Russia and the Ottoman overlord, power-sharing included the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the [[Austrian Empire]], the [[Second French Empire|French Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]], and [[Prussia]]). Due to Austrian and Ottoman opposition and British reserves, the union program as demanded by radical campaigners was debated intensely. In September 1857, given that ''[[Kaymakam|Caimacam]]'' [[Nicolae Vogoride]] had perpetrated [[Electoral fraud|fraud]] in elections in Moldavia, the Powers allowed the two states to convene ad hoc [[divan]]s, which were to decide a new constitutional framework; the result showed overwhelming support for the union, as the creation of a [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] state. After further meetings among leaders of tutor states, an agreement was reached (the ''Paris Convention''), whereby a limited union was to be enforced – separate governments and thrones, with only two bodies (a [[High Court of Cassation and Justice|Court of Cassation]] and a Central Commission residing in [[Focșani]]); it also stipulated that an end to all privilege was to be passed into law, and awarded back to Moldavia the areas around [[Bolhrad]], [[Cahul]], and [[Izmail]].

However, the Convention failed to note whether the two thrones could not be occupied by the same person, allowing ''Partida Națională'' to introduce the candidacy of [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] in both countries. On January 17 (January 5, 1859 [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|Old Style]]), in [[Iași]], he was elected prince of Moldavia by the respective electoral body. After street pressure over the much more [[Conservatism|conservative]] body in [[Bucharest]], Cuza was elected in Wallachia as well (February 5/January 24). Exactly three years later, after diplomatic missions that helped remove opposition to the action, the formal union created the [[United Principalities]] (the basis of modern Romania) and instituted Cuza as ''[[Domnitor]]'' (all legal matters were clarified after the replacement of the prince with [[Carol I of Romania|Carol of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]] in April 1866, and the creation of an independent [[Kingdom of Romania]] in 1881) - this officially ending the existence of the Principality of Moldavia.

Slavery ({{lang-ro|robie}}) was part of the [[social class|social order]] from before the founding of the Principality of Moldavia, until it was [[Abolitionism|abolished]] in stages during the 1840s and 1850s. Most of the slaves were of [[Roma minority in Romania|Roma]] (Gypsy) ethnicity. There were also slaves of [[Tatars|Tatar]] ethnicity, probably prisoners captured from the wars with the [[Nogai Horde|Nogai]] and [[Crimean Tatars]]. The institution of slavery was first attested in a 1470 Moldavian document, through which Prince [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]] frees Oană, a Tatar slave who had fled to [[History of Poland during the Jagiellon dynasty|Jagiellon Poland]].&lt;ref name=Achim&gt;Viorel Achim, ''The Roma in Romanian History'', Central European University Press, Budapest, 2004, {{ISBN|963-9241-84-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact origins of slavery are not known, as it was a common [[Slavery in medieval Europe|practice in medieval Europe]]. As in the [[Byzantine Empire]], the Roma were held as slaves of the state, of the [[boyars]] or of the monasteries. Historian [[Nicolae Iorga]] associated the Roma people's arrival with the 1241 [[Mongol invasion of Europe]] and considered their slavery as a vestige of that era; he believed that the Romanians took the Roma as slaves from the [[Mongols]] and preserved their status to control their labor. Other historians consider that the Roma were enslaved while captured during the battles with the Tatars. The practice of enslaving prisoners may also have been taken from the Mongols. The ethnic identity of the &quot;Tatar slaves&quot; is unknown, they could have been captured Tatars of the [[Golden Horde]], [[Cuman people|Cumans]], or the slaves of Tatars and Cumans.&lt;ref name=Achim/&gt; While it is possible that some Romani people were slaves or auxiliary troops of the Mongols or Tatars, most of them came from south of the [[Danube]], demonstrating that slavery a widespread practice. The Tatar slaves, smaller in numbers, were eventually merged into the Roma population.&lt;ref name=Stefanescu&gt;Ștefan Ștefănescu, ''Istoria medie a României'', Vol. I, Editura Universității din București, Bucharest, 1991 {{in lang|ro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, Roma slaves were divided into three categories. The smallest was owned by the ''hospodars'', and went by the Romanian-language name of ''țigani domnești'' (&quot;Gypsies belonging to the lord&quot;). The two other categories comprised ''țigani mănăstirești'' (&quot;Gypsies belonging to the monasteries&quot;), who were the property of [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] and [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] monasteries, and ''țigani boierești'' (&quot;Gypsies belonging to the boyars&quot;), who were enslaved by the category of landowners.&lt;ref name=Djuvara&gt;[[Neagu Djuvara]], ''Între Orient și Occident.

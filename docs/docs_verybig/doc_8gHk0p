Once [[William I of England|King William]] had won total control of the strategically important Thames Valley, he went on to invade the rest of England. He had many castles built, including those at [[Wallingford Castle|Wallingford]], [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]], [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] and most importantly the [[Tower of London]]. Many details of Thames activity are recorded in the [[Domesday Book]]. The following centuries saw the conflict between king and barons coming to a head in AD 1215 when [[John, King of England|King John]] was forced to sign the [[Magna Carta]] on an island in the Thames at [[Runnymede]]. Among a host of other things, this granted the barons the right of Navigation under Clause 23.

Another major consequence of John's reign was the completion of the multi-piered [[London Bridge]], which acted as a barricade and barrage on the river, affecting the tidal flow upstream and increasing the likelihood of the river freezing over. In [[Tudor period|Tudor]] and [[Stuart period|Stuart]] times, various kings and queens built magnificent riverside palaces at [[Hampton Court Palace|Hampton Court]], [[Kew]], [[Richmond on Thames]], [[Whitehall]] and [[Greenwich]].

As early as the 1300s, the Thames was used to dispose of waste matter produced in the city of London, thus turning the river into an open sewer. In 1357, [[Edward III]] described the state of the river in a proclamation: &quot;... dung and other filth had accumulated in divers places upon the banks of the river with ... fumes and other abominable stenches arising therefrom.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2007&quot;&gt;Peter Ackroyd, Thames: The Biography, New York: Doubleday, 2007. &quot;Filthy River&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of the population of London greatly increased the amount of waste that entered the river, including human excrement, animal waste from slaughter houses, and waste from manufacturing processes. According to historian Peter Ackroyd, &quot;a public lavatory on London Bridge showered its contents directly onto the river below, and latrines were built over all the tributaries that issued into the Thames.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2007&quot;/&gt;

=== Early modern period ===
[[File:The Frozen Thames 1677.jpg|thumb|''The Frozen Thames'' by [[Abraham Hondius]], 1677]]

During a series of cold winters the Thames froze over above London Bridge: in the first [[Thames frost fairs|Frost Fair]] in 1607, a tent city was set up on the river, along with a number of amusements, including ice bowling.

In good conditions, barges travelled daily from Oxford to London carrying timber, wool, foodstuffs and livestock. The stone from the [[Cotswolds]] used to rebuild [[St Paul's Cathedral]] after the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] in 1666 was brought all the way down from [[Radcot]]. The Thames provided the major route between the City of London and Westminster in the 16th and 17th centuries; the clannish guild of watermen ferried Londoners from landing to landing and tolerated no outside interference. In 1715, [[Thomas Doggett]] was so grateful to a local waterman for his efforts in ferrying him home, pulling against the tide, that he set up a rowing race for professional watermen known as &quot;[[Doggett's Coat and Badge]]&quot;.

[[File:FaradayFatherThames.jpg|thumb|''[[Michael Faraday]] giving his card to Father Thames'', caricature commenting on a letter of Faraday's [[Great Stink|on the state of the river]] in ''[[The Times]]'' in July 1855]]

By the 18th century, the Thames was one of the world's busiest waterways, as London became the centre of the vast, mercantile [[British Empire]], and progressively over the next century the docks expanded in the [[Isle of Dogs]] and beyond. Efforts were made to resolve the navigation conflicts upstream by building locks along the Thames. After temperatures began to rise again, starting in 1814, the river stopped freezing over.&lt;ref name=freeze2&gt;{{cite web |title=Frost Fairs, London, UK |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A970733 |publisher=BBC |access-date=21 March 2007 |archive-date=27 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200827085621/https://h2g2.com/edited_entry/A970733 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building of a new [[London Bridge]] in 1825, with fewer [[pier (architecture)|piers]] (pillars) than the old, allowed the river to flow more freely and prevented it from freezing over in cold winters.&lt;ref name=freeze1&gt;{{cite web |title=London, River Thames and Tower Bridge |url=http://www.vrlondon.co.uk/london_virtual_tour/source/lon7.html |publisher=VR London |access-date=21 March 2007 |archive-date=16 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516023416/http://www.vrlondon.co.uk/london_virtual_tour/source/lon7.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout early modern history the population of London and its industries discarded their rubbish in the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lbhf.gov.uk/external/la21/articles/stink.htm |title=Thames and Waterways |publisher=London Borough of Hammersmith &amp; Fulham |access-date=17 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415055701/http://www.lbhf.gov.uk/external/la21/articles/stink.htm |archive-date=15 April 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This included the waste from slaughterhouses, fish markets, and tanneries. The buildup in household cesspools could sometimes overflow, especially when it rained, and was washed into London's streets and sewers which eventually led to the Thames.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Schneer]], &quot;The Thames&quot; 145–146&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 18th and 19th centuries people known as [[Mudlark]]s scavenged in the river mud for a meagre living.

===Victorian era===
[[File:Monster Soup commonly called Thames Water. Wellcome V0011218.jpg|thumb|left|Satirical cartoon by [[William Heath (artist)|William Heath]], showing a woman observing monsters in a drop of London water (at the time of the ''Commission on the London Water Supply'' report, 1828)]]

In the 19th century the quality of water in Thames deteriorated further. The dumping of raw [[sewage]] into the Thames was formerly only common in the [[City of London]], making its tideway a harbour for many harmful bacteria. Gas manufactories were built alongside the river, and their by-products leaked into the water, including spent lime, ammonia, cyanide, and carbolic acid. The river had an unnaturally warm temperature caused by chemical reactions in the water, which also removed the water's oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ackroyd, &quot;Thames: Sacred River&quot; 272–273&lt;/ref&gt; Four serious cholera outbreaks killed tens of thousands of people between 1832 and 1865. Historians have attributed [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert's]] death in 1861 to typhoid that had spread in the river's dirty waters beside Windsor Castle.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; Wells with [[water table]]s that mixed with tributaries (or the non-tidal Thames) faced such pollution with the widespread installation of the [[flush toilet]] in the 1850s.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Peter Ackroyd, ''Thames: The Biography''. 272 &amp; 274.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the '[[Great Stink|Great Stink' of 1858]], pollution in the river reached such an extreme that sittings of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] at Westminster had to be abandoned. Chlorine-soaked drapes were hung in the windows of Parliament in an attempt to stave off the smell of the river, but to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ackroyd, &quot;Thames: Sacred River&quot; 272&lt;/ref&gt;

A concerted effort to contain the city's sewage by constructing massive [[Combined sewer|sewer systems]] on the north and south river embankments followed, under the supervision of engineer [[Joseph Bazalgette]]. Meanwhile, similar huge undertakings took place to ensure the water supply, with the building of reservoirs and pumping stations on the river to the west of London, slowly helping the quality of water to improve.

The [[Victorian era]] was one of imaginative engineering. The coming of the railways added railway bridges to the earlier road bridges and also reduced commercial activity on the river. However, sporting and leisure use increased with the establishment of [[regatta]]s such as [[Henley Royal Regatta|Henley]] and [[the Boat Race]]. On 3 September 1878, one of the worst river disasters in England took place, when the crowded pleasure boat {{SS|Princess Alice|1865|2}} collided with the ''Bywell Castle'', killing over 640 people.

=== 20th century ===
[[File:London from above MLD 051002 003.jpg|thumb|The Thames as it flows through east London, with the [[Isle of Dogs]] in the centre]]

The growth of [[road transport]], and the decline of the [[British Empire|Empire]] in the years following 1914, reduced the economic prominence of the river. During the [[Second World War]], the protection of certain Thames-side facilities, particularly docks and water treatment plants, was crucial to the munitions and water supply of the country. The river's defences included the [[Maunsell fort]]s in the estuary, and the use of [[barrage balloons]] to counter [[Luftwaffe|German bombers]] using the reflectivity and shapes of the river to navigate during [[the Blitz]].

In the post-war era, although the [[Port of London#The Port today|Port of London]] remains one of the UK's three main ports, most trade has moved downstream from central London. In the late 1950s, the discharge of methane gas in the depths of the river caused the water to bubble, and the toxins wore away at boats' propellers.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ackroyd &quot;Thames: Sacred River&quot; 274&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline of heavy industry and tanneries, reduced use of oil-pollutants and improved sewage treatment have led to much better water quality compared to the late 19th and early- to mid-20th centuries and aquatic life has returned to its formerly 'dead' stretches.

Alongside the entire river runs the [[Thames Path]], a National Route for walkers and cyclists.

In the early 1980s a pioneering flood control device, the [[Thames Barrier]], was opened. It is closed to tides several times a year to prevent water damage to London's low-lying areas upstream (the [[1928 Thames flood]] demonstrated the severity of this type of event).

In the late 1990s, the {{convert|7|mi|km|0|adj=on}} long [[Jubilee River]] was built as a wide &quot;naturalistic&quot; flood relief channel from [[Taplow]] to [[Eton, Berkshire|Eton]] to help reduce the flood risk in [[Maidenhead]] [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] and Eton.&lt;ref&gt;[[Environment Agency]] (2005).

In 2010, the Thames won the largest environmental award in the world – the $350,000 International Riverprize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://riverfoundation.org.au/our-programs/riverprize/international-riverprize/ |website=riverfoundation.org.au |title=Thiess International Riverprize – International RiverFoundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major resources provided by the Thames is the water distributed as drinking water by [[Thames Water]], whose area of responsibility covers the length of the River Thames. The [[Thames Water Ring Main]] is the main distribution mechanism for water in London, with one major loop linking the [[Hampton, London|Hampton]], [[Walton-on-Thames|Walton]], [[Ashford, Surrey|Ashford]] and [[Kempton Park, Surrey|Kempton Park]] Water Treatment Works with central London.

In the past, commercial activities on the Thames included fishing (particularly eel trapping), [[coppicing]] [[willow]]s and [[Willow|osiers]] which provided wood, and the operation of [[watermill]]s for flour and paper production and metal beating. These activities have disappeared. A [[screw turbine]] hydro-electric plant at [[Romney Lock]] to power [[Windsor Castle]] using two [[Archimedes' screw]]s was opened in 2013 by the Queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Queen goes gree: hydroelectric turbines arrive at Windsor Castle |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/8749107/The-Queen-goes-green-hydroelectric-turbines-arrive-at-Windsor-Castle.html |access-date=27 August 2020 |work=Telegraph |date=8 September 2011 |archive-date=27 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200827085623/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/8749107/The-Queen-goes-green-hydroelectric-turbines-arrive-at-Windsor-Castle.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; This followed the first installation of such a screw at [[Mapledurham Watermill]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cassell |first1=Paul |title=Hydroelectric power comes to Mapledurham |url=https://www.getreading.co.uk/news/local-news/hydroelectric-power-comes-to-mapledurham-4207122 |access-date=22 October 2019 |publisher=Berkshire Live |date=1 Nov 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thames is popular for a wide variety of riverside housing, including high-rise flats in central London and chalets on the banks and islands upstream. Some people live in houseboats, typically around [[Brentford]] and [[Tagg's Island]].

=== Transport and tourism ===

==== The tidal river ====
{{Main|London River Services}}
[[File:Waterloo Pier 1.jpg|thumb|Passenger service on the River Thames]]

In London there are many sightseeing tours in tourist boats, past the more famous riverside attractions such as the [[Houses of Parliament]] and the [[Tower of London]] as well as regular riverboat services co-ordinated by [[London River Services]]. London city Airport is situated on the Thames, in East London. Previously it was a dock.

==== The upper river ====
In summer, passenger services operate along the entire non-tidal river from Oxford to Teddington. The two largest operators are [[Salters Steamers]] and French Brothers. Salters operate services between [[Folly Bridge]], Oxford and Staines. The whole journey takes four days and requires several changes of boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salterssteamers.co.uk/trips.htm |title=Salters Steamers website |work=Salterssteamers.co.uk |access-date=17 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529030233/http://www.salterssteamers.co.uk/trips.htm |archive-date=29 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; French Brothers operate passenger services between Maidenhead and Hampton Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=French Brothers |url=http://www.simplonpc.co.uk/FrenchBros.html |publisher=Simplon |access-date=27 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Along the course of the river a number of smaller private companies also offer river trips at Oxford, Wallingford, Reading and Hampton Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hart, Dorothy |url=http://www.the-river-thames.co.uk/leisure.htm |title=Floating Down the River website |work=The-river-thames.co.uk |date=1 January 2000 |access-date=17 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies also provide boat hire on the river.

The leisure navigation and sporting activities on the river have given rise to a number of businesses including boatbuilding, marinas, ships chandlers and salvage services.

The [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|Air Line]] [[aerial lift|cable car]] over the Thames from the [[Greenwich Peninsula]] to the [[Royal Docks]] has been in operation since the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].

=== Police and lifeboats ===
The river is policed by five police forces. The [[Marine Support Unit|Thames Division]] is the River Police arm of London's [[Metropolitan Police]], while [[Surrey Police]], [[Thames Valley Police]], [[Essex Police]] and [[Kent Police]] have responsibilities on their parts of the river outside the metropolitan area. There is also a [[London Fire Brigade]] fire boat on the river. The river claims a number of lives each year.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, 24 July 2014 {{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-28456639|title=Deaths in the River Thames reached 15 last year|work=BBC News online|language=en-GB|access-date=23 January 2019|archive-date=27 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200827085624/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-28456639|url-status=live}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the [[Marchioness disaster]] in 1989 when 51 people died, the [[UK government|Government]] asked the [[Maritime and Coastguard Agency]], the [[Port of London Authority]] and the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]] (RNLI) to work together to set up a dedicated Search and Rescue service for the tidal River Thames. As a result, there are four [[lifeboat station]]s on the River Thames at [[Teddington]] ([[Teddington lifeboat station]]), [[Chiswick]] (Chiswick lifeboat station), [[Victoria Embankment]]/[[Waterloo Bridge]] ([[Tower Lifeboat Station]]) and [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]] (Gravesend lifeboat station).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1739401.stm |work=BBC News |date=2 January 2002 |title=Thames lifeboat service launched |access-date=17 May 2010 |archive-date=19 May 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5yo0kXnz9?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1739401.stm |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thames is maintained for navigation by powered craft from the estuary as far as [[Lechlade]] in Gloucestershire and for very small craft to [[Cricklade]]. The original [[towpath]] extends upstream from [[Putney Bridge]] as far as the connection with the now disused [[Thames and Severn Canal]] at [[Inglesham]], one and a half miles  upstream of the [[St John's Lock|last boat lock]] near [[Lechlade]]. From Teddington Lock to the head of navigation, the navigation authority is the [[Environment Agency]]. Between the sea and [[Teddington Lock]], the river forms part of the [[Port of London]] and navigation is administered by the [[Port of London Authority]]. Both the tidal river through London and the non-tidal river upstream are intensively used for leisure navigation.

The non-tidal River Thames is divided into reaches by the 45 [[lock (water transport)|locks]]. The locks are staffed for the greater part of the day, but can be operated by experienced users out of hours. This part of the Thames links to existing navigations at the [[River Wey Navigation]], the [[River Kennet]] and the [[Oxford Canal]]. All craft using it must be licensed. The [[Environment Agency]] has patrol boats (named after tributaries of the Thames) and can enforce the limit strictly since river traffic usually has to pass through a lock at some stage. A speed limit of {{convert|8|km/h|kn|1|abbr=on}} applies. There are pairs of [[Navigation transit markers|transit markers]] at various points along the non-tidal river that can be used to check speed – a boat travelling legally taking a minute or more to pass between the two markers.

The tidal river is navigable to large ocean-going ships as far upstream as the [[Pool of London]] and [[London Bridge]]. Although London's upstream enclosed docks have closed and central London sees only the occasional visiting [[cruise ship]] or [[naval ship|warship]], the tidal river remains one of Britain's main ports. Around 60 active terminals cater for shipping of all types including [[ro-ro]] ferries, cruise liners and vessels carrying [[Containerization|containers]], vehicles, timber, grain, paper, [[Petroleum|crude oil]], [[petroleum products]], [[liquified petroleum gas]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.portoflondon.co.uk/siteimages/port%20promotion/Terminal%20location%20map%20(full).jpg |access-date=12 May 2008 |author=Port of London Authority |title=Terminal locations |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527201816/http://www.portoflondon.co.uk/siteimages/port%20promotion/Terminal%20location%20map%20(full).jpg |archive-date=27 May 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a regular traffic of [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]] or [[waste|refuse]] vessels, operating from [[wharf|wharves]] in the west of London. The tidal Thames links to the canal network at the [[River Lea Navigation]], the [[Regent's Canal]] at [[Limehouse Basin]] and the [[Grand Union Canal]] at Brentford.

Upstream of [[Wandsworth Bridge]] a speed limit of {{convert|8|kn|km/h|0}} is in force for powered craft to protect the riverbank environment and to provide safe conditions for rowers and other river users. There is no absolute speed limit on most of the Tideway downstream of Wandsworth Bridge, although boats are not allowed to create undue wash. Powered boats are limited to 12 knots between [[Lambeth Bridge]] and downstream of Tower Bridge, with some exceptions. Boats can be approved by the [[Harbourmaster|harbour master]] to travel at speeds of up to 30 knots from below Tower Bridge to past the Thames Barrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Thames Bylaws 2012 |author=Port of London |page=20 |url=http://www.pla.co.uk/assets/120529_Thames_Byelaws1.pdf |access-date=24 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305232657/http://www.pla.co.uk/assets/120529_Thames_Byelaws1.pdf |archive-date=5 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== History of the management of the river ====
In the [[Middle Ages]] [[the Crown]] exercised general jurisdiction over the Thames, one of the four royal rivers, and appointed [[water bailiff]]s to oversee the river upstream of Staines. The [[City of London]] exercised jurisdiction over the tidal Thames. However, navigation was increasingly impeded by [[weir]]s and mills, and in the 14th century the river probably ceased to be navigable for heavy traffic between Henley and Oxford. In the late 16th century the river seems to have been reopened for navigation from Henley to [[Burcot, Oxfordshire|Burcot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22808 |title=Victoria County History of Oxfordshire: Rivers and river navigation |publisher=British-history.ac.uk |access-date=17 May 2010 |archive-date=27 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200827085632/https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/oxon/vol4/pp284-295 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commission concerned with the management of the river was the [[Oxford-Burcot Commission]], formed in 1605 to make the river navigable between Burcot and Oxford.

In 1751 the [[Thames Navigation Commission]] was formed to manage the whole non-tidal river above Staines. The [[City of London]] long claimed responsibility for the tidal river. A long running dispute between the City and the Crown over ownership of the river was not settled until 1857, when the [[Thames Conservancy]] was formed to manage the river from Staines downstream. In 1866 the functions of the Thames Navigation Commission were transferred to the Thames Conservancy, which thus had responsibility for the whole river.

In 1909 the powers of the Thames Conservancy over the [[tidal river]], below Teddington, were transferred to the [[Port of London Authority]].

In 1974 the Thames Conservancy became part of the new [[Thames Water Authority]]. When Thames Water was privatised in 1990, its river management functions were transferred to the [[National Rivers Authority]], in 1996 subsumed into the [[Environment Agency]].

In 2010, the Thames won the world's largest environmental award at the time, the $350,000 International Riverprize, presented at the International Riversymposium in Perth, WA in recognition of the substantial and sustained restoration of the river by many hundreds of organisations and individuals since the 1950s.

=== The river as a boundary ===
Until enough crossings were established, the river presented a formidable barrier, with Belgic tribes and Anglo-Saxon kingdoms being defined by which side of the river they were on. When English counties were established their boundaries were partly determined by the Thames. On the northern bank were the ancient counties of [[Gloucestershire]], Oxfordshire, [[Buckinghamshire]], [[Middlesex]] and [[Essex]]. On the southern bank were the counties of [[Wiltshire]], Berkshire, [[Surrey]] and [[Kent]].

At the same time it removed Teklogix from its operating company name to create a &quot;clear, unifying, global identity&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;psion.com&quot;/&gt;

== Psion and the term ''Netbook'' ==
Psion registered the trademark ''NETBOOK'' in various territories, including [[European Union]] {{Community trademark|000428250}} and {{US trademark|75215401}}, which was applied for on 18 December 1996 and registered by [[USPTO]] on 21 November 2000. They used this trademark&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/release?id=16302 Psion netbook news release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608191451/http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/release?id=16302 |date=2011-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[Psion netBook]] product, discontinued in November 2003,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psionteklogix.com/public.aspx?s=us&amp;p=EOLProducts Psion Discontinued Products] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517090710/http://www.psionteklogix.com/public.aspx?s=us&amp;p=EOLProducts |date=2007-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and from October 2003, the NETBOOK PRO, later also discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psionteklogix.com/products/discontinued-products.htm NETBOOK PRO discontinued] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104021536/http://www.psionteklogix.com/products/discontinued-products.htm |date=2011-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intel]] started using the term ''[[netbook]]'' in March 2008 as a generic term to describe &quot;small laptops that are designed for wireless communication and access to the Internet&quot;, believing they were &quot;not offering a branded line of computers here&quot; and &quot;see no naming conflict&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.intel.com/technology/2008/03/thoughts_on_netbooks.php Paul Bergevin - VP and GM of Intel's Global Communication Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the growing use of the term, on 23 December 2008 Psion Teklogix sent cease and desist letters&lt;ref&gt;[http://jkontherun.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/psion-letter.jpg Psion Cease and Desist Letter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326131612/http://jkontherun.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/psion-letter.jpg |date=2009-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to various parties including enthusiast website(s) demanding they no longer use the term &quot;''netbook''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jkontherun.com/2008/12/23/netbook-enthusiast-web-sites-getting-c-d-using-term-netbook/ jkOnTheRun]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/dec/24/psion-netbook-threats Psion threatens netbook sites over trademarks]&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2009, [[Intel]] sued [[Psion Teklogix]] (US &amp; Canada) and Psion (UK) in the Federal Court, seeking a cancellation of the trademark and an order enjoining Psion from asserting any trademark rights in the term &quot;netbook&quot;, a declarative judgement regarding their use of the term, attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements and &quot;such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courthousenews.com/2009/02/16/IntelvPsion.pdf Complaint for Injunctive Relief, Declaratory Judgment &amp; Cancellation of Federal Trademark]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courthousenews.com/2009/02/16/Intel_Wants_Netbook_Trademark_Canceled.htm Intel Wants 'Netbook' Trademark Canceled]&lt;/ref&gt; The suit was settled out of court, and on June 2, 2009 Psion announced that the company was withdrawing all of its trademark registrations for the term &quot;Netbook&quot; and that Psion agreed to &quot;waive all its rights against third parties in respect of past, current or future use&quot; of the term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-10253210-92.html Psion, Intel settle 'Netbook' trademark dispute]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar marks were rejected by the [[USPTO]] citing a &quot;likelihood of confusion&quot; under section 2(d), including 'G NETBOOK' ({{US trademark|77527311}} rejected 31 October 2008), [[Micro-Star International|MSI]]'s 'WIND NETBOOK' ({{US trademark|77580272}}) and [[Coby Electronics Corporation|Coby Electronics]]' 'COBY NETBOOK' ({{US trademark|77590174}} rejected 13 January 2009)

==Psion and Linux==
Psion PLC had a lengthy, but distant, interest in [[Linux]] as an [[operating system]] on its electronic devices.  In 1998, it supported the Linux7K project that had been initiated by Ed Bailey at [[Red Hat]], which was to port Linux to its Series 5 personal computer.&lt;ref&gt;

The project soon transitioned to an informal [[open-source software|open source]] project at Calcaria.net that kept the name Linux7K.  After the project transitioned again to sourceforge.net, the project's name was changed to a more general name &quot;PsiLinux&quot;, and more recently to &quot;OpenPsion&quot;.  The project has developed Linux kernels and filesystems for the [[Psion Revo|Revo]], [[Psion Series 5|Series 5 and 5MX]], and [[Psion Series 7|Series 7 and netBook]].

In 2003–4, Psion Teklogix and its founder David Potter expressed interest in Linux as the operating system for its devices as it divested from Symbian.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Rambouillet Agreement''', formally the '''Interim Agreement for Peace and Self-Government in Kosovo''', was a proposed peace agreement between the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and a delegation representing the [[Albanians|Ethnic Albanian]] majority population of [[Kosovo]]. It was drafted by the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) and named for the [[Château de Rambouillet]], where it was initially proposed in early 1999. The significance of the agreement lies in the fact that Yugoslavia refused to accept it, which NATO used as justification to start its intervention in the [[Kosovo War]]. Belgrade's rejection was based on the argument that the agreement contained provisions for Kosovo's [[autonomy]] that went further than the Serbian and Yugoslav governments saw as reasonable.

==Negotiations==
The biggest problem for both sides was that the Albanians were unwilling to accept a solution that would retain Kosovo as part of Serbia, whilst the Serbs did not want to see the pre-1990 status quo restored, and they were implacably opposed to any international role in the governance of the province, including the offer of a face-saving measure wherein blue-helmeted UN peacekeeping troops would be used instead of NATO troops.&lt;ref name = &quot;Judah 323&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Judah|2009|p=323}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The negotiations thus became somewhat a game of musical chairs, each side trying to avoid being blamed for the breakdown of the talks.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} To add to the farce, the NATO Contact Group countries were desperate to avoid having to make good on their threat of force—Greece and Italy were opposed to the idea. Consequently, when the talks failed to achieve an agreement by the original deadline of 19 February, they were extended by another month.

The two paragraphs above, however, are partially contradicted by the historical evidence. In particular, the statement by the co-chairmen [[Robin Cook]] and [[Hubert Védrine]] on 23 February 1999 that the negotiations &quot;have led to a consensus&quot; on substantial autonomy for Kosovo, including on mechanisms for free and fair elections to democratic institutions, for the governance of Kosovo, for the protection of human rights and the rights of members of national communities; and for the establishment of a fair judicial system&quot;. They went on to say that &quot;a political framework is now in place&quot; leaving the further work of finalizing &quot;the implementation Chapters of the Agreement, including the modalities of the invited international civilian and military presence in Kosovo&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohr.int/other-doc/contact-g/default.asp?content_id=3560 |title=Contact Group Statement – Rambouillet, 23 February 1999 |publisher=Office of the High Representative |date=23 February 1999 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234216/http://www.ohr.int/other-doc/contact-g/default.asp?content_id=3560 |archivedate=26 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, on 18 March 1999, the Albanian, American and British delegation signed what became known as the 'Rambouillet Accords'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://1997-2001.state.gov/www/regions/eur/ksvo_rambouillet_text.html |title=Rambouillet Agreement -Interim Agreement for Peace and Self-Government in Kosovo |publisher=US State Department |date=March 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Serbian and Russian delegations refused. The accords called for NATO administration of Kosovo as an autonomous province within Yugoslavia; a force of 30,000 NATO troops to maintain order in Kosovo; an unhindered right of passage for NATO troops on Yugoslav territory, including Kosovo; and immunity for NATO and its agents to Yugoslav law. According to Tim Judah, the Serbian side used Annex B only later on as a reason for the failure of talks; at the time, the Serbs rejected any discussion of the involvement of foreign troops, let alone the extensive rights that would have been afforded them by Annex B.&lt;ref name = &quot;Judah 324&quot; /&gt;

Events proceeded rapidly after the failure at Rambouillet. The international monitors from the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] were withdrawn on 22 March for fear of the monitors' safety ahead of the anticipated bombing by NATO.  On 23 March, the Serbian assembly issued a resolution that condemned the withdrawal of the OSCE monitors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Herring|2000|p=227}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and accepted the principle of &quot;autonomy&quot; for Kosovo&lt;ref name=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.serbia-info.com/news/1999-03/24/10030.html  |title=Conclusions of Serbian parliament |work=SerbiaInfo |publisher=Serbian Government |date= 24 March 1999 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080214160503/http://www.serbia-info.com/news/1999-03/24/10030.html |archivedate = 14 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and non-military part of the agreement.

NATO leaders had expected that a brief bombing campaign would lead to Serb forces withdrawing from Kosovo, hence ending the humanitarian crisis; but [[Slobodan Milošević|Milošević]] may have gambled that his government and armed forces could withstand a few days of bombing without serious harm.&lt;ref name = &quot;Judah 324&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Judah|2009|p=324}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

== Use of force ==
A highly controversial facet of the negotiations at Rambouillet was the [[Threat of force (public international law)|threat of force]], against the FRY, that girded them.

Article 2 of the UN Charter states that &quot;[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Charter of the United Nations » Chapter II |url= http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-i/index.html |website= un.org |accessdate= 13 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 39 stipulates that &quot;[t]he Security Council shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42, to maintain or restore international peace and security&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Charter of the United Nations » Chapter VII |url= http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-vii/index.html |website= un.org |accessdate= 13 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Article 53 states that &quot;no enforcement action shall be taken under regional arrangements or by regional agencies without the authorization of the Security Council&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Charter of the United Nations » Chapter VIII |url= http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-viii/index.html |website= un.org |accessdate= 13 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents and critics of the bombing differ on, for example, whether NATO's threatened and then actual use of force were violations of the territorial integrity and political independence of the FRY, and whether NATO meets the criteria of a regional agency.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

==Reactions==
In commentary released to the press, former United States Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] declared that:

{{quote|The Rambouillet text, which called on Serbia to admit NATO troops throughout Yugoslavia, was a provocation, an excuse to start bombing. Rambouillet is not a document that an angelic Serb could have accepted.  It was a terrible diplomatic document that should never have been presented in that form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/24/serbia-kosovo | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Serbia's anniversary is a timely reminder | first=Ian | last=Bancroft | date=24 March 2009 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Henry Kissinger]], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 28 June 1999}} The historian [[Christopher Clark]] supports this view, asserting that the terms of the 1914 [[July Crisis#Content of the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum to Serbia|Austro-Hungarian ultimatum to Serbia]] appear lenient compared to the NATO demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Christopher|title=The Sleepwalkers.

A former hand on the State Department's Yugoslavia desk, George Kenney, reported in May 1999 that a senior State Department official had briefed journalists off the record that &quot;[we] deliberately set the bar higher than the Serbs could accept&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last= Kenney |first= George |date= 27 May 1999 |title=  Rolling Thunder: the Rerun |url= http://www.thenation.com/article/rolling-thunder-rerun/ |website= The Nation |accessdate= 1 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{United States House of Representatives}}

The '''speaker of the United States House of Representatives''' is the [[Speaker (politics)|presiding officer]] of the [[United States House of Representatives]]. The office was established in 1789 by [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 2: House of Representatives|Article I, Section 2]] of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]]. The speaker is the political and parliamentary leader of the House of Representatives, and is simultaneously the House's presiding officer, ''de facto'' leader of the body's majority party, and the institution's administrative head. Speakers also perform various other administrative and procedural functions. Given these several roles and responsibilities, the speaker usually does not personally preside over debates. That duty is instead delegated to members of the House from the majority party. Neither does the speaker regularly participate in floor debates.

The Constitution does not require the speaker to be an [[incumbent]] member of the House of Representatives, although every speaker thus far has been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last=Heitshusen |first=Valerie |date=May 16, 2017 |title=The Speaker of the House: House Officer, Party Leader, and Representative |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/97-780.pdf |publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]] |page=2 |access-date=September 20, 2020 |quote=In fact, there is no requirement that the Speaker be a Member of the House.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speaker is second in the [[United States presidential line of succession]], after the [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] and ahead of the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president ''pro tempore'' of the Senate]].&lt;ref name=CRS2005continuity/&gt;

The current House speaker, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] of [[California]], was elected to the office on [[2019 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election|January 3, 2019]]. Pelosi previously served as speaker from January 4, 2007 to January 3, 2011. She has the distinction of being the first woman to serve as speaker, and is also the first former speaker to be returned to office since [[Sam Rayburn]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/28/pelosi-speaker-votes-1023848|title=Pelosi grabs momentum with big speaker vote|last1=Bresnahan|first1=John|date=November 28, 2018|work=[[Politico]]|accessdate=December 26, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190226213612/https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/28/pelosi-speaker-votes-1023848|archive-date=February 26, 2019|last2=Caygle|first2=Heather|last3=Bade|first3=Rachael|authorlink3=Rachael Bade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Selection ==
The House elects its speaker at the beginning of a new Congress (i.e. {{Linktext|biennially}}, after [[Election Day (United States)|a general election]]) or when a speaker dies, resigns or is removed from the position intra-term. Since 1839, the House has elected speakers by [[roll call vote]].&lt;ref name=HG125&gt;{{cite web| last=Forte| first=David F.| title=Essays on Article I: Speaker of the House| url=https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/10/speaker-of-the-house| work=Heritage Guide to The Constitution| publisher=Heritage Foundation| accessdate=January 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, each [[Party caucuses and conferences in the United States Congress|party's caucus or conference]] selects a candidate for the speakership from among its senior leaders prior to the roll call. Representatives are not restricted to voting for the candidate nominated by their party, but generally do, as the outcome of the election effectively determines which party has the [[Majority party|majority]] and consequently will organize the House.&lt;ref name=CRS-RL30857&gt;{{cite web| last1=Heitshusen| first1=Valerie| last2=Beth| first2=Richard S.| title=Speakers of the House: Elections, 1913–2019| date=January 4, 2019| work=CRS Report for Congress| url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL30857.pdf| publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]], the [[Library of Congress]]| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=January 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Constitution does not explicitly state that the speaker must be an [[incumbent]] member of the House, it is permissible for representatives to vote for someone who is not a member of the House at the time, and non-members have received a few votes in various speaker elections over the past several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Grier| first=Peter| date=September 25, 2015| url=https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/Decoder/2015/0925/John-Boehner-exit-Anyone-can-run-for-House-speaker-even-you| title=John Boehner exit: Anyone can run for House speaker, even you| newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor| accessdate=January 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every person elected speaker has been a member.&lt;ref name=CRS-RL30857/&gt;

Representatives who choose to vote for someone other than their party's nominated candidate usually vote for someone else in their party or vote &quot;present&quot;. Anyone who votes for the other party's candidate would face serious consequences, as was the case when [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Jim Traficant]] voted for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Dennis Hastert]] in 2001 ([[107th United States Congress|107th Congress]]). In response, the Democrats stripped him of his seniority and he lost all of his committee posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/james-a-traficant-jr-colorful-ohio-congressman-expelled-by-house-dies-at-73/2014/09/27/fa98868a-4431-11e4-9a15-137aa0153527_story.html|title=James A.

To be elected speaker, a candidate must receive an absolute majority of the votes cast, as opposed to an absolute majority of the full membership of the House{{snd}}presently 218 votes, in a House of 435. There have only been a few instances during the past century where a person received a majority of the votes cast, and thus won the election, while failing to obtain a majority of the full membership. It happened most recently in 2015 ([[114th United States Congress|114th Congress]]), when [[John Boehner]] was elected with 216 votes (as opposed to 218). Such a variation in the number of votes necessary to win a given election might arise due to vacancies, absentees, or members being present but not voting. If no candidate wins a majority of the &quot;votes cast for a person by name&quot;, then the roll call is repeated until a speaker is elected.&lt;ref name=CRS-RL30857/&gt; Multiple roll calls have been necessary only 14 times (out of 126 speakership elections) since 1789; and not since 1923 ([[68th United States Congress|68th Congress]]), when a closely divided House needed nine ballots to elect [[Frederick H. Gillett]] speaker.&lt;ref name=HouseHAA/&gt; Upon winning election the new speaker is immediately sworn in by the [[dean of the United States House of Representatives]], the chamber's longest-serving member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fathers/Deans of the House|url=https://history.house.gov/Institution/Seniority/Deans-of-the-House/|website=history.house.gov|publisher=United States House of Representatives|access-date=January 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://constitution.laws.com/house-of-representatives/election-of-the-speaker| title=Election of the Speaker Overview| website=constitution.laws.com| accessdate=January 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first speaker of the House, [[Frederick Muhlenberg]] of [[Pennsylvania]], was elected to office on April 1, 1789, the day the House organized itself at the start of the [[1st United States Congress|1st Congress]]. He served two non-consecutive terms in the speaker's chair, 1789–1791 (1st Congress) and 1793–1795 ([[3rd United States Congress|3rd Congress]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Speakers of the House| url=https://history.house.gov/People/Office/Speakers-List/|website=history.house.gov|publisher=United States House of Representatives|access-date=January 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

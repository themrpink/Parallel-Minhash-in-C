The [[Handley Page]] company in Britain produced the [[Handley Page Type W]] as the company's first civil transport aircraft. It housed two crew in an open [[cockpit]] and 15 passengers in an enclosed cabin. Powered by two {{convert|450|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Napier Lion]] engines, the prototype first flew on 4 December 1919, shortly after it was displayed at the 1919 [[Paris Air Show]] at [[Le Bourget]]. It was the world's first airliner to be designed with an on-board [[Aircraft lavatory|lavatory]]{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}.

Meanwhile, in France, the [[Bleriot-SPAD S.33]] was a great success throughout the 1920s, initially serving the Paris-[[London]] route, and later on [[Europe|continental]] routes. The enclosed cabin could carry four passengers with an extra seat in the cockpit.

By 1921,  aircraft capacity needed to be larger for the economics to remain favourable. The English company [[de Havilland]], therefore built the 10-passenger [[de Havilland Doncaster|DH.29]] [[monoplane]], while starting work on the design of the DH.32, an eight-seater [[biplane]] with a less powerful but more economical [[Rolls-Royce Eagle]] [[Reciprocating engine|engine]]. Owing to the urgent need for more capacity, however, work on the DH.32 was stopped and the [[De Havilland DH.34|DH.34]] biplane was designed, accommodating 10 passengers. The [[Fokker trimotor]] was an important and popular transport, manufactured under license in Europe and America.

Throughout the 1920s, companies in Britain and France were at the forefront of the civil airliner industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brighthub.com/science/aviation/articles/64406.aspx |first=Jason C. |last=Chavis |editor-first=Laurie |editor-last=Patsalides |title=From Civilian to Military: All About 1920 Airplanes |publisher=Brighthub.com |date=19 May 2011 |access-date=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; often considerably aided by government subsidies.

In America, the [[Ford Trimotor]] was an important early airliner. With two engines mounted on the wings and one in the nose, and a slabsided body, it carried eight passengers and was produced from 1925 to 1933. It was used by the predecessor to [[Trans World Airlines]], and by other airlines long after production ceased.  [[Pan Am]] opened up transoceanic service in the late 1920s and early '30s, based on a series of large seaplanes – the [[Sikorsky S-38]] through [[Sikorsky S-42]].

By the 1930s, the airliner industry had matured and large consolidated national airlines were established with regular international services that spanned the globe, including [[Imperial Airways]] in Britain, [[Lufthansa]] in Germany, KLM in the Netherlands, and [[United Airlines]] in America. Multi-engined aircraft were now capable of transporting dozens of passengers in comfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/29214178/World-Airliners-1913-to-1939 |title=World Airliners 1913 to 1939 |publisher=Scribd.com |date=31 March 2010 |access-date=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, the [[de Havilland Dragon]] was a successful aircraft during the 1930s. Its simple design used a plywood box fuselage. It could carry six passengers, each with {{convert|45|lb|kg}} of luggage, on the London-Paris route on a fuel consumption of just 13 gal (49 l) per hour. The wing panels outboard of the engines could be folded for storage. The type was attractive as a short-haul, low-capacity airliner and was soon in service worldwide. British production of the DH.84{{explain|date=March 2019}} ended when it was replaced on the assembly line by the more powerful and elegant [[de Havilland Dragon Rapide]].

[[File:Douglas C-47A Skytrain (DC-3), KLM - Royal Dutch Airlines (DDA Classic Airlines) AN2107554.jpg|thumb|The [[Douglas DC-3]] appeared in 1935]]
The first modern-looking, sleek metal airliners also came into service in the 1930s. In the United States, the [[Boeing 247]] and the 14-passenger [[Douglas DC-2]] flew, and in 1935, the more powerful, faster, 21–32 passenger [[Douglas DC-3]] appeared. DC-3s were produced in quantity for World War II and sold as surplus afterward. The Douglas DC-3 was a particularly important airplane, because it was the first airliner to be profitable without a government subsidy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mellberg&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mellberg | first1 = William F | year = 2003 | title = TRANSPORTATION REVOLUTION | journal = Mechanical Engineering | volume = 125 | pages = 22–25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-haul flights were expanded during the 1930s as both Pan American Airways and Imperial Airways competed in the provision of [[Transatlantic flight|transatlantic travel]] using [[flying boat]]s such as the British [[Short Empire]] and the American [[Boeing 314]]. This prefigured the dramatic growth of transatlantic travel in the postwar period.

===The postwar era===
{{main|Jet airliner}}

====United Kingdom====
[[File:Comet Prototype at Hatfield.jpg|thumb|right|Prototype of the [[de Havilland Comet]] in 1949, the first jet airliner in the world]]
In the United Kingdom, the [[Brabazon Committee]] was formed in 1942 under [[John Moore-Brabazon, 1st Baron Brabazon of Tara]] to investigate the future needs of the British Empire's civilian airliner market. The study was an attempt at defining in broad overview, the impact of projected advances in aviation technology, and to forecast the global needs of the postwar [[British Empire]] (in South Asia, Africa, and the Near and [[Far East]]) and Commonwealth ([[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]]) in the area of air transport, for passengers, mail, and cargo. The crucial problem that the planners faced was that an agreement had been reached between the United States and the United Kingdom in 1942 to split responsibility for building multi-engine aircraft types for British use: the US would concentrate on [[Military transport aircraft|transport aircraft]], while the UK would concentrate on their [[heavy bomber]]s. This decision meant that the United Kingdom would be left at the close of the war with little experience in the design, manufacture, and final assembly of transport aircraft.

The final report called for the construction of four general designs studied by the committee and members of the state-owned airlines [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC) and later [[British European Airways]] (BEA). The first three designs were piston-powered aircraft of varying sizes for different markets, while the Type IV design, at the urging of [[Geoffrey de Havilland]], whose company was involved in development the first jet fighters, was for a [[jet engine|jet-powered]] 100-seat design.

The Type I design, after a brief contest, was given to the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]], building on submissions they had made during the war for a &quot;100 ton [[bomber]]&quot;. This evolved into the creation of the [[Bristol Brabazon]].

The Type II process was complicated by the proposition of [[Vickers]] that a move to the newly developed [[turboprop]] power should be made. The specification was, therefore, split in two, with the conventional piston design going to the eventual [[de Havilland Dove]] and [[Airspeed Ambassador]]. The revolutionary [[Vickers Viscount|VC.2 Viceroy]], first flown in 1948, was the first turboprop design anywhere. The Type III requirement was developed as the [[Avro Tudor]].

The Type IV for the jet-powered aircraft went to de Havilland and became, in 1949, the world's first jet airliner, the [[de Havilland Comet|Comet]]. It featured an aerodynamically clean design with four [[de Havilland Ghost]] [[turbojet]] engines buried in the wings, a pressurised fuselage, and large, square windows. For the era, it offered a relatively quiet, comfortable passenger cabin and showed signs of being a commercial success at its 1952 debut. However, a year after entering commercial service, the Comets began suffering problems, with three of them breaking up during mid-flight in well-publicised accidents. This was later found to be due to catastrophic [[Fatigue (material)|metal fatigue]], not well understood at the time, in the airframes. The Comet was withdrawn from service and extensively tested to discover the cause. Rival manufacturers, meanwhile, heeded the lessons learned from the Comet while developing their own aircraft. Although sales never fully recovered, the improved Comet 2 and the prototype Comet 3 culminated in the redesigned Comet 4 series which debuted in 1958 and had a productive career of over 30 years.

This disaster, coupled with the fact that the UK's domestic market was much smaller than the US's, meant that by the 1960s, it was increasingly clear that the UK had lost the airliner market to the US, and later designs like the [[BAC 1-11]], [[Vickers VC10]], and [[Hawker Siddeley Trident]] although successful would be unable to win a substantial part of it back again. Another committee was formed to consider [[supersonic]] designs, STAC, and worked with Bristol to create the [[Bristol 223]] design for a 100-passenger transatlantic airliner. However, this was going to be so expensive to produce that the effort was later merged with similar efforts in France to create the [[Concorde]] supersonic airliner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jarrett&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Hamilton-Paterson| first =James| title =Empire of the Clouds: When Britain's Aircraft Ruled the World| publisher =Faber &amp; Faber| edition =1St edition reprint|year=2010| page =304| isbn =0571247946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
The United States, conversely, gained a huge advantage in design and production in the airline industry in the years leading up to the war, but many of the developments were put off until after the war as the manufacturing efforts were placed on the war effort. The advancements that the United States made in this industry were in large part due to the cooperation of the airlines discussing what they desired with the airliner manufacturers.

[[File:6609-UAL-DC-6-NorthRampStapletonDEN.jpg|thumb|[[United Airlines]] [[Douglas DC-6|DC-6]], Stapleton Airport, Denver, September 1966]]
Soon after the war, though, Douglas made a large advancement with the [[Douglas DC-4|DC-4]]; although this could not cross the Atlantic at every point, it was able to make a nonstop flight from [[New York City|New York]] to the United Kingdom. Due to the war going on, the first batch of these planes went to the U.S. Army and Air Forces, and was named the [[Douglas C-54 Skymaster|C-54 Skymaster]]. Some of these  used in the war were later converted for the airline industry, along with the passenger and cargo versions that were placed on the market once the war ended. Douglas  later developed a version of this plane that was pressurized and five feet longer; this redesigned plane became the [[Douglas DC-6|DC-6]]; these DC-6s were grounded for six months to rectify a few safety issues that were causing in-flight fires.

Soon after the DC-4, Lockheed developed the distinctive triple-tail [[Lockheed Constellation|Constellation]]. An aviation breakthrough, it was the first commercially successful pressurized airliner, allowing it to fly higher than other airliners. Its fuselage was some 127&amp;nbsp;inches wider than the DC-4s. Drafted by the military in World War II, it experienced a similar late entry into the civilian airline industry. Safety concerns grounded it for six months soon after it entered service while problems were investigated and repaired.

In 1947, the [[Boeing 377 Stratocruiser]] entered the industry with a completely different design from Douglas and Lockheed aircraft. Based on the [[Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter|C-97 Stratofreighter]] military transport, it had a double deck and pressurized fuselage. Luxury and a 100-passenger capacity distinguished it from its rivals. While 900 C-97s were supplied to the military, only 55 were produced for civil aviation.

The American companies had done a great job of advancing the status of transcontinental travel, but the aging fleet of DC-3s had to be addressed. Convair decided that they were going to address this market, and began producing the [[Convair CV-240 family|Convair 240]], which was a 40-person fully pressurized plane. Including two that were equipped with jet-assisted take-off units, 566 of these planes flew. Convair  later developed the [[Convair CV-240 family|Convair 340]], which was slightly larger and could accommodate between 44 and 52 passengers, and 311 of this model were produced. Finally, Convair created a Convair 440, which had small modifications, including much better soundproofing than the previous models. Convair experienced  competition from the [[Martin 2-0-2]] and [[Martin 4-0-4]], but in general was able to control this market, as the 2-0-2 had safety concerns and was unpressurized, and the 4-0-4 only sold around 100 units.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jarrett&quot;&gt;Jarrett, Phillip. eds. Modern Air Transport: Worldwide Air Transport from 1945 to the Present. London: Putnam, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States was dominant in this industry for several reasons, including a large domestic market for these planes. The market also worked in the United States' favor as the American companies began to build pressurized airliners. During the postwar years, engines became much larger and more powerful, and safety features such as deicing, navigation, and weather information were added to the planes. Lastly, the planes produced in the United States were more comfortable and had superior flight decks than those produced in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jarrett&quot;/&gt;

====France====
In the postwar years, France developed a few significant airliners, some of these being planes that could land on water; part of the reason the French companies were so focused on these flying boats is that in 1936, the French Air Ministry requested transatlantic flying boats that could hold at least 40 passengers. Only one model from this request was ever put into service. The first set of these were three [[Latécoère 631]]'s that [[Air France]] purchased and put into service in July 1947. However, two of these planes crashed, and the third plane was soon removed because of safety concerns. Later, the [[SNCASE Languedoc|SNCASE SE.161 Languedoc]] was a much more successful plane (over 100 of these were built), with 40 of them being placed into service through Air France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jarrett&quot;/&gt; The French also developed the [[Breguet Deux-Ponts|Breguet 763 Deux Ponts]], which first flew in February 1949. This was a double-decker transport airliner that ended up being used for both people and cargo. This four-engined plane could be used to hold large amounts of cargo or 97 passengers. After a long silence, France then created the [[Sud-Aviation Caravelle|Caravelle]], the world's first short- to midrange jet airliner. Subsequent French efforts were part of the [[Airbus]] pan-European initiative.

====USSR====
Soon after the war, most of the Soviet fleet of airliners consisted of DC-3s or [[Lisunov Li-2]]s. These planes were in desperate need of replacement, and in 1946, the [[Ilyushin Il-12]] made its first flight. The Il-12 was very similar in design to American Convair 240, except was unpressurized. In 1953, the [[Ilyushin Il-14]] made its first flight, and this version was equipped with much more powerful engines. The main contribution that the Soviets made in regards to airliners was the [[Antonov An-2]]. This plane is a biplane, unlike most of the other airliners, and sold more units than any other transport plane.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jarrett&quot;/&gt;

==Types==

===Narrow-body airliners===
[[File:Airbus A320-200 Airbus Industries (AIB) &quot;House colors&quot; F-WWBA - MSN 001 (10276181983).jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Airbus A320 family]] is the most ordered [[narrow-body aircraft]]]]

The most common airliners are the [[narrow-body aircraft]], or single-aisles.
The earliest [[jet airliner]] were narrowbodies: the initial [[de Havilland Comet]], the [[Boeing 707]] and its competitor the [[Douglas DC-8]].
They were followed by smaller models : the [[Douglas DC-9]] and its [[MD-80]]/[[MD-90]]/[[Boeing 717]] derivatives; the [[Boeing 727]], [[Boeing 737|737]] and [[Boeing 757|757]] using the 707 cabin cross-section; or the [[Tupolev Tu-154]], [[Ilyushin IL-18]], and the [[Ilyushin IL-62]].

Currently produced narrow-body airliners include the [[Airbus A220]] and [[Airbus A320 family|A320 family]], [[Boeing 737]] and [[Embraer E-Jet family]], generally used for [[Flight length|medium-haul flights]] with 100 to 240 passengers. 
They could be joined by the in-development [[Comac C919]] and [[Irkut MC-21]].

===Wide-body airliners===
[[File:Boeing 747 rollout (3).jpg|thumb|upright|The first [[wide-body aircraft]], the [[Boeing 747]], rolled out in September 1968]]

The larger [[wide-body aircraft]], or twin-aisle as they have two separate aisles in the cabin, are used for long-haul flights.
The first was the [[Boeing 747]] quadjet, followed by the trijets: the [[Lockheed L-1011]] and the [[Douglas DC-10]], then its [[MD-11]] stretch.
Other quadjets were introduced: the [[Ilyushin Il-86]] and [[Ilyushin Il-96|Il-96]], the [[Airbus A340]] and the double-deck [[Airbus A380|A380]].
Twinjet were also put into service: the [[Airbus A300]]/[[Airbus A310|A310]], [[Airbus A330|A330]] and [[Airbus A350|A350]]; the [[Boeing 767|767]], [[Boeing 777|777]] and [[Boeing 787|787]].

===Regional aircraft===
[[File:Lufthansa CityLine, Canadair CRJ-700, D-ACPQ (14003297897).jpg|thumb|upright|Over 1,800 [[Bombardier CRJ]]s have been delivered]]

[[Regional airliner]]s seat fewer than 100 passengers.
These smaller aircraft are often used to feed traffic at large [[airline hub]]s to larger aircraft operated by the major [[mainline (flight)|mainline carriers]], [[legacy carriers]], or [[flag carrier]]s; often sharing the same livery.
[[Regional jet]]s include the [[Bombardier CRJ100/200]] and [[Bombardier CRJ700 series]], or the [[Embraer ERJ family]].
Currently produced [[turboprop]] regional airliners include the [[Dash-8]] series, and the [[ATR 42]]/[[ATR 72|72]].

===Commuter aircraft===
[[File:1900C envol.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Beechcraft 1900]], short-range commuter aircraft]]

[[Light aircraft]] can be used as small commuter airliners, or as [[air taxi]]s.
Twin turboprops carrying up to 19 passengers include the [[Beechcraft 1900]], [[Fairchild Metro]], [[Jetstream 31]], [[DHC-6 Twin Otter]] and [[Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante]].
Smaller airliners include the single-engined turboprops like the [[Cessna Caravan]] and [[Pilatus PC-12]]; or twin piston-powered aircraft made by [[Cessna]], [[Piper Aircraft|Piper]], [[Britten-Norman]], and [[Beechcraft]].
They often lack [[Aircraft lavatory|lavatories]], stand-up cabins, [[pressurization]], [[Galley (kitchen)|galleys]], overhead storage bins, reclining seats, or a [[flight attendant]].

==Engines==
Until the beginning of the [[Jet Age]], [[piston engine]]s were common on [[propliner]]s such as the Douglas DC-3. Nearly all modern airliners are now powered by [[gas turbine|turbine]] engines, either [[turbofan]]s or [[turboprop]]s. Gas turbine engines operate efficiently at much higher altitudes, are more reliable than piston engines, and produce less vibration and noise. The use of a common fuel type – kerosene-based jet fuel – is another advantage. Prior to the Jet Age,  the same or very similar engines commonly were used in civilian airliners and [[military aircraft]]. In recent years, divergence has occurred, so that is of the same engine on military type and civilian type aircraft is unusual. Those military aircraft which do share engine technology with airliners are typically [[Military transport aircraft|transports]] or [[aerial refueling|tanker]] types.

==Airliner variants==
Some variants of airliners have been developed for carrying freight or for luxury [[business jet|corporate use]]. Many airliners have also been modified for government use as [[Very Important Person|VIP]] transports and for military functions such as airborne tankers (for example, the [[Vickers VC10]], [[Lockheed L-1011]], [[Boeing 707]]), air ambulance ([[United States Air Force|USAF]]/[[United States Navy|USN]] [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]]), [[Aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] ([[Embraer ERJ 145 family|Embraer ERJ 145]], [[Saab 340]], and [[Boeing 737]]), as well as for troop-carrying roles.

==Configuration==
Modern jetliners are usually low-wing designs with two engines mounted underneath the [[swept wing]]s ([[turboprop]] aircraft are slow enough to use straight wings). The Boeing 747 and Airbus A380 are the only airliners in production which are too heavy (more than 400 tons [[maximum takeoff weight]]) for just two engines. Smaller airliners sometimes have their engines mounted on either side of the rear fuselage. Numerous advantages and disadvantages exist due to this arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Kroo| first = Ilan| title = Engine Placement| work = AA241 Introduction to Aircraft Design: Synthesis and Analysis| publisher = Stanford University| date = January 19, 2006| url = http://rahauav.com/Library/Design-performance/Aircraft%20Design,%20synthesis%20and%20analysis.pdf| access-date = February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most important advantage to mounting the engines under the wings is that the total aircraft weight is more evenly distributed across the wingspan, which imposes less [[bending moment]] on the wings and allows for a lighter wing structure. This factor becomes more important as aircraft weight increases, and no in-production airliners have both a maximum takeoff weight more than 50 tons and engines mounted on the fuselage. The [[Antonov An-148]] is the only in-production jetliner with high-mounted wings (usually seen in [[military transport aircraft]]), which reduces the risk of damage from unpaved runways.

Except for a few experimental or military designs, all aircraft built to date have had all of their weight [[Lift (force)|lifted]] off the ground by airflow across the wings. In terms of [[aerodynamics]], the fuselage has been a mere burden. [[NASA]] and [[Boeing]] are currently developing a [[blended wing body]] design in which the entire airframe, from wingtip to wingtip, contributes lift. This promises a significant gain in [[Fuel efficiency in transportation|fuel efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Blended Wing Body Feature | publisher =NASA | date =17 April 2013 | url =http://www.nasa.gov/topics/aeronautics/features/bwb_main.html| access-date =18 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current manufacturers==
[[File:Boeing 767 Nose Section.jpg|thumb|Assembly of a [[Boeing 767]] nose section]]
The major manufacturers with airliners currently in production include:
* [[Airbus]] (France/Germany/Spain/United Kingdom)
* [[Antonov]] (Ukraine)
* [[ATR Aircraft]] (France/Italy)
* [[Boeing]] (United States)
* [[Bombardier Aerospace]] (Canada) 
* [[Comac]] (China)
* [[Embraer]] (Brazil)
* [[Let Kunovice]] (Czech Republic)
* [[Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation]] (Japan)
* [[United Aircraft Corporation]] (Russia, includes [[Tupolev]], [[Yakovlev]], [[Sukhoi]], [[Ilyushin]], and others)
* [[Xi'an Aircraft Industrial Corporation]] (China)

The narrow-body and wide-body airliner market is dominated by Airbus and Boeing, and the [[regional airliner]] market is mostly split between [[ATR Aircraft]], [[Bombardier Aerospace]], and [[Embraer]].

Setting up a reliable [[customer support]] network, ensuring uptime, availability and support 24/7 and anywhere, is critical for the success of airliner manufacturers.&lt;!--ref name=AvWeek17jul2019--&gt;
[[Boeing and Airbus]] are ranked 1 and 2 in customer satisfaction for aftermarket support by a survey by [[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology|Inside MRO]] and [[Air Transport World]], and this is a reason why [[Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation]] purchased the [[Bombardier CRJ]] program.&lt;!--ref name=AvWeek17jul2019--&gt;
It is an [[entry barrier]] for new entrants like the [[Xian MA700]] and [[Comac C919]], with no credible previous experience with the [[MA60]], or the [[Irkut MC-21]] after the [[Sukhoi Superjet 100]].&lt;ref name=AvWeek17jul2019&gt;{{cite news |url= https://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/customer-support-jetliner-industry-s-biggest-challenge |title= Customer Support: The Jetliner Industry’s Biggest Challenge |date= Jul 17, 2019 |author= Kevin Michaels |work= Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

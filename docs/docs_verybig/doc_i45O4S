In the year 1709, Pope showcased his precocious metrical skill with the publication of ''Pastorals'', his first major poems. They earned him instant fame. By the time he was 23 he had written ''[[An Essay on Criticism]]'', released in 1711. A kind of poetic manifesto in the vein of [[Horace]]'s ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'', the essay was met with enthusiastic attention and won Pope a wider circle of prominent friends, most notably [[Joseph Addison]] and [[Richard Steele]], who had recently started collaborating on the influential ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]''. The critic [[John Dennis (dramatist)|John Dennis]], having located an ironic and veiled portrait of himself, was outraged by what he considered the impudence of the younger author. Dennis hated Pope for the rest of his life, and, save for a temporary reconciliation, dedicated his efforts to insulting him in print, to which Pope retaliated in kind, making Dennis the butt of much satire.

''The Rape of the Lock'', perhaps the poet's most famous poem, appeared first in 1712, followed by a revised and enlarged version in 1714. When [[Robert Petre, 7th Baron Petre|Lord Petre]] forcibly snipped off a lock from Miss [[Arabella Fermor]]'s head (the &quot;Belinda&quot; of the poem), the incident gave rise to a high-society quarrel between the families. With the idea of allaying this, Pope treated the subject in a playful and witty [[mock-heroic]] epic. The narrative poem brings into focus the onset of acquisitive individualism and conspicuous consumption, where purchased goods assume dominance over moral agency.

A folio comprising a collection of his poems appeared in 1717, together with two new ones written about the passion of love. These were ''Verses to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady'' and the famous proto-romantic poem ''[[Eloisa to Abelard]]''. Though Pope never married, about this time he became strongly attached to Lady M. Montagu, whom he indirectly referenced in the popular poem ''Eloisa to Abelard'', and to Martha Blount, with whom his friendship continued throughout his life.

In his career as a satirist, Pope made his share of enemies as the critics, politicians, and certain other prominent figures felt the sting of his sharp-witted satires. Some were so virulent, that Pope even carried pistols at one point while walking his dog. After 1738, Pope composed relatively little. He toyed with the idea of writing a patriotic epic called ''Brutus.'' He mainly revised and expanded his masterpiece ''The Dunciad''. Book Four appeared in 1742, and a complete revision of the whole poem in the following year. In this version, he replaced Lewis Theobald with the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]] [[Colley Cibber]], as &quot;king of dunces&quot;. However, his real target in the poem is the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] politician [[Robert Walpole]]. By now Pope's health was failing, and when told by his physician, on the morning of his death, that he was better, Pope replied: &quot;Here am I, dying of a hundred good symptoms.&quot;

===Early life===
Alexander Pope was born in London on 21 May 1688, the year of the [[Glorious Revolution]]. His father (also Alexander, 1646–1717) was a successful linen merchant in the [[Strand, London|Strand]]. The poet's mother, Edith (1643–1733), was the daughter of William Turner, Esquire, of [[York]]. Both parents were [[Catholic Church|Catholics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Erskine-Hill, DNB&quot;&gt;Erskine-Hill, ''DNB''&lt;/ref&gt; Edith's sister, Christiana, was the wife of famous miniature painter [[Samuel Cooper]]. Pope's education was affected by the recently enacted [[Test Act]]s, which upheld the status of the [[state church|established]] [[Church of England]] and banned Catholics from teaching, attending a university, voting, and holding public office on penalty of perpetual imprisonment. Pope was taught to read by his aunt and went to [[Twyford School]] in about 1698/99.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erskine-Hill, DNB&quot; /&gt; He then went on to two Roman Catholic schools in London.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erskine-Hill, DNB&quot;&gt;Erskine-Hill, ''DNB''&lt;/ref&gt; Such schools, while illegal, were tolerated in some areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander Pope' 2000&quot;&gt;'Alexander Pope', ''Literature Online biography'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1700, his family moved to a small estate at [[Popeswood]] in [[Binfield]], Berkshire, close to the royal [[Windsor Great Park|Windsor Forest]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Erskine-Hill, DNB&quot;/&gt; This was due to strong anti-Catholic sentiment and a statute preventing &quot;Papists&quot; from living within {{convert|10|mi|km}} of London or Westminster.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;An Act to prevent and avoid dangers which may grow by Popish Recusants&quot; (3. Jac. 1, v). For details, see ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', &quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11611c.htm Penal Laws]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Pope would later describe the countryside around the house in his poem ''Windsor Forest''.&lt;ref name=&quot;WF&quot;&gt;Pope, Alexander. [http://www.eighteenthcenturypoetry.org/works/o3704-w0010.shtml ''Windsor-Forest'']. Eighteenth-Century Poetry Archive (ECPA).&lt;/ref&gt; Pope's formal education ended at this time, and from then on, he mostly educated himself by reading the works of classical writers such as the [[Satire|satirists]] [[Horace]] and [[Juvenal]], the [[Epic poetry|epic poets]] [[Homer]] and [[Virgil]], as well as English authors such as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[John Dryden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Erskine-Hill, DNB&quot;&gt;Erskine-Hill, ''DNB''&lt;/ref&gt; He studied many languages and read works by English, French, Italian, Latin, and Greek poets. After five years of study, Pope came into contact with figures from London literary society such as [[William Congreve]], [[Samuel Garth]] and [[William Trumbull]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Erskine-Hill, DNB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander Pope' 2000&quot;/&gt;

At Binfield he made many important friends. One of them, [[John Caryll the younger|John Caryll]] (the future dedicatee of ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]''), was twenty years older than the poet and had made many acquaintances in the London literary world. He introduced the young Pope to the ageing playwright [[William Wycherley]] and to [[William Walsh (poet)|William Walsh]], a minor poet, who helped Pope revise his first major work, ''The Pastorals''. He also met the Blount sisters, Teresa and [[Martha Blount|Martha]], both of whom remained lifelong friends.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander Pope' 2000&quot;/&gt;

From the age of 12 he suffered numerous health problems, including [[Pott disease]], a form of [[tuberculosis]] that affects the spine, which deformed his body and stunted his growth, leaving him with a severe hunchback. His tuberculosis infection caused other health problems including respiratory difficulties, high fevers, inflamed eyes and abdominal pain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erskine-Hill, DNB&quot;/&gt; He grew to a height of only {{convert|1.37|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. Pope was already removed from society as a Catholic, and his poor health alienated him further. Although he never married, he had many female friends to whom he wrote witty letters, including [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]]. It has been alleged that his lifelong friend Martha Blount was his lover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander Pope' 2000&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon 2002&quot;&gt;Gordon (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Mount', ''Britannica'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of Alexander Pope'', by [[Robert Carruthers]], 1857, with a corrupted and badly scanned version available [https://archive.org/details/lifealexanderpo00carrgoog from Internet Archive], or as an [https://archive.org/details/lifealexanderpo00carrgoog even worse 23MB PDF]. For reference to his relationship with Martha Blount and her sister, see pp. 64–68 (p. 89 ff. of the PDF). In particular, discussion of the controversy over whether the relationship was sexual is described in some detail on pp. 76–78.&lt;/ref&gt; His friend [[William Cheselden]] said, according to [[Joseph Spence (author)|Joseph Spence]], &quot;I could give a more particular account of Mr. Pope's health than perhaps any man. Cibber's slander (of carnosity) is false. He had been gay, but left that way of life upon his acquaintance with Mrs. B.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Zachary Cope, ''William Cheselden, 1688–1752''. Edinburgh: E. &amp; S. Livingstone, 1953, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
[[File:Alexander Pope's house wall plaque Twickenham.jpg|thumb|Plaque above [[Pope's Grotto]] at Twickenham]]

In May 1709, Pope's ''Pastorals'' was published in the sixth part of bookseller [[Jacob Tonson]]'s ''Poetical Miscellanies''. This earned Pope instant fame and was followed by ''[[An Essay on Criticism]]'', published in May 1711, which was equally well received.

[[File:Alexander Pope's house at Twickenham.png|thumb|left|[[Pope's villa]] at [[Twickenham]], showing the [[grotto]]; from a watercolour produced soon after his death]]

Around 1711, Pope made friends with Tory writers [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Thomas Parnell]] and [[John Arbuthnot]], who together formed the satirical [[Scriblerus Club]]. Its aim was to satirise ignorance and pedantry through the fictional scholar Martinus Scriblerus. He also made friends with Whig writers [[Joseph Addison]] and [[Richard Steele]]. In March 1713, ''Windsor Forest''&lt;ref name=&quot;WF&quot;/&gt; was published to great acclaim.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander Pope' 2000&quot;/&gt;

During Pope's friendship with Joseph Addison, he contributed to Addison's play ''[[Cato, a Tragedy|Cato]]'', as well as writing for ''[[The Guardian (1713)|The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]''. Around this time, he began the work of translating the ''[[Iliad]]'', which was a painstaking process – publication began in 1715 and did not end until 1720.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander Pope' 2000&quot;/&gt;

In 1714 the political situation worsened with the death of Queen Anne and the disputed succession between the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverians]] and the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], leading to the [[Jacobite rising of 1715]]. Though Pope, as a Catholic, might have been expected to have supported the Jacobites because of his religious and political affiliations, according to Maynard Mack, &quot;where Pope himself stood on these matters can probably never be confidently known&quot;. These events led to an immediate downturn in the fortunes of the Tories, and Pope's friend [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke]], fled to France.

Pope lived in his parents' house in Mawson Row, [[Chiswick]], between 1716 and 1719; the red brick building is now the [[Mawson Arms]], commemorating him with a [[blue plaque]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ChiswickHistory&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://chiswickhistory.org.uk/html/110-people.html |title=Chiswick History |publisher=chiswickhistory.org.uk |work=People: Alexander Pope |accessdate=16 March 2012 |author=Clegg, Gillian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The money made from his translation of Homer allowed Pope to move in 1719 to [[Pope's villa|a villa at Twickenham]], where he created his now famous [[Pope's Grotto|grotto]] and gardens. The serendipitous discovery of a spring during the excavation of the subterranean retreat enabled it to be filled with the relaxing sound of trickling water, which would quietly echo around the chambers. Pope was said to have remarked that: &quot;Were it to have nymphs as well – it would be complete in everything.&quot; Although the house and gardens have long since been demolished, much of the grotto survives. It now lies beneath Radnor House Independent Co-ed School and is occasionally opened to the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon 2002&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[London Evening Standard]]'', 2 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Essay on Criticism''===
{{main|An Essay on Criticism}}
''[[An Essay on Criticism]]'' was first published anonymously on 15 May 1711. Pope began writing the poem early in his career and took about three years to finish it.

At the time the poem was published, the [[heroic couplet]] style in which it was written was a moderately new poetic form, and Pope's work was an ambitious attempt to identify and refine his own positions as a poet and critic. The poem was said to be a response to an ongoing debate on the question of whether poetry should be natural, or written according to predetermined artificial rules inherited from the classical past.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rogers 2006&quot;&gt;Rogers (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'essay' begins with a discussion of the standard rules that govern poetry by which a critic passes judgment. Pope comments on the classical authors who dealt with such standards and the authority that he believed should be accredited to them. He discusses the laws to which a critic should adhere while critiquing poetry, and points out that critics serve an important function in aiding poets with their works, as opposed to the practice of attacking them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baines 2001&quot;&gt;Baines (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; The final section of ''An Essay on Criticism'' discusses the moral qualities and virtues inherent in the ideal critic, who, Pope claims, is also the ideal man.

===''The Rape of the Lock''===
Pope's most famous poem is ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', first published in 1712, with a revised version published in 1714. A [[mock-epic]], it satirises a high-society quarrel between [[Arabella Fermor]] (the &quot;Belinda&quot; of the poem) and [[Robert Petre, 7th Baron Petre|Lord Petre]], who had snipped a lock of hair from her head without her permission. The satirical style is tempered, however, by a genuine and almost voyeuristic interest in the &quot;beau-monde&quot; (fashionable world) of 18th-century English society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.english-literature.org/essays/alexander-pope.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531103412/http://www.english-literature.org/essays/alexander-pope.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-05-31 |title=from the London School of Journalism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revised, extended version of the poem brought more clearly into focus its true subject – the onset of acquisitive individualism and a society of conspicuous consumers. In the world of the poem, purchased artifacts displace human agency, and &quot;trivial things&quot; assume dominance.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Nicholson, ''Writing and the Rise of Finance: Capital Satires of the Early Eighteenth Century'' (Cambridge 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Dunciad'' and ''Moral Essays''===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}
[[File:Alexander Pope circa 1736.jpeg|thumb|upright|Alexander Pope, painting attributed to English painter [[Jonathan Richardson]], {{circa|1736}}, [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]]]

Though ''[[The Dunciad]]'' was first published anonymously in [[Dublin]], its authorship was not in doubt. Pope pilloried a host of other &quot;hacks&quot;, &quot;scribblers&quot; and &quot;dunces&quot; in addition to Theobald, and Maynard Mack has accordingly called its publication &quot;in many ways the greatest act of folly in Pope's life.&quot; Though a masterpiece which would become &quot;one of the most challenging and distinctive works in the history of English poetry&quot;, writes Mack, &quot;it bore bitter fruit. It brought the poet in his own time the hostility of its victims and their sympathizers, who pursued him implacably from then on with a few damaging truths and a host of slanders and lies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Maynard Mack. ''Alexander Pope: A Life'' (W. W. Norton &amp; Company, and [[Yale University Press]], 1985), pp. 472–473.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his half-sister Magdalen Rackett, some of Pope's targets were so enraged by ''The Dunciad'' that they threatened him. &quot;My brother does not seem to know what fear is,&quot; she told [[Joseph Spence (author)|Joseph Spence]], explaining that Pope loved to walk alone, so went accompanied by his [[Great Dane]] Bounce, and for some time carried pistols in his pocket.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Spence. [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015030979424;view=1up;seq=52 ''Observations, Anecdotes, and Characters of Books and Men, Collected from the Conversation of Mr. Pope'' (1820), p. 38].&lt;/ref&gt; Together with John Gay's ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' and Jonathan Swift's ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', this first ''Dunciad'' was part of a concerted propaganda assault against [[Robert Walpole]]'s Whig ministry and the financial revolution it stabilised. Although he was a keen participant in the stock and money markets, Pope never missed an opportunity to satirise the personal, social and political effects of the new scheme of things. From ''The Rape of the Lock'' onwards, these satirical themes are a constant in his work.

In 1731, Pope published his &quot;Epistle to [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Burlington]],&quot; on the subject of architecture, the first of four poems which would later be grouped under the title ''[[Moral Essays]]'' (1731–1735). In the epistle, Pope ridiculed the bad taste of the aristocrat &quot;Timon&quot;. Pope's enemies claimed he was attacking the [[James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos|Duke of Chandos]] and his estate, [[Cannons (house)|Cannons]]. Though the charge was untrue, it did much damage to Pope.

===''An Essay on Man''===
{{main|An Essay on Man}}

''[[An Essay on Man]]'' is a philosophical poem, written in heroic couplets and published between 1732 and 1734. Pope intended this poem to be the centrepiece of a proposed system of ethics that was to be put forth in poetic form. It was a piece of work that Pope intended to make into a larger work; however, he did not live to complete it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nuttal 1984&quot;&gt;Nuttal (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem is an attempt to &quot;vindicate the ways of God to Man&quot;, a variation on Milton's attempt in ''Paradise Lost'' to &quot;justify the ways of God to Man&quot; (1.26). It challenges as prideful an anthropocentric world-view. The poem is not solely Christian, however; it makes an assumption that man has fallen and must seek his own salvation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nuttal 1984&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Alexander Pope.jpg|left|thumb|Alexander Pope circa 1742]]

It consists of four epistles addressed to [[Lord Bolingbroke]]. Pope presents an idea on his view of the Universe: no matter how imperfect, complex, inscrutable and disturbing the Universe appears to be, it functions in a rational fashion according to the natural laws. The natural laws consider the Universe as a whole a perfect work of God. To humans, it appears to be evil and imperfect in many ways. Pope ascribes this to our limited mindset and limited intellectual capacity. He gets the message across that humans must accept their position in the &quot;Great Chain of Being&quot;, at a middle stage between the angels and the beasts of the world. Accomplish this and we potentially could lead happy and virtuous lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nuttal 1984&quot;/&gt;

The poem is an affirmative poem of faith: life seems to be chaotic and confusing to man when he is in the centre of it, but according to Pope it is really divinely ordered. In Pope's world, God exists and is what he centres the Universe around in order to have an ordered structure. The limited intelligence of man can only take in tiny portions of this order and can experience only partial truths, hence man must rely on hope which then leads into faith. Man must be aware of his existence in the Universe and what he brings to it, in terms of riches, power, and fame. It is man's duty to strive to be good regardless of other situations: this is the message Pope is trying to get across to the reader.&lt;ref&gt;Cassirer (1944).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life and works===
[[File:Alexander Pope dying.png|thumb|The death of Alexander Pope from ''Museus'', a [[threnody]] by [[William Mason (poet)|William Mason]]. [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] holds the dying Pope, and [[John Milton]], [[Edmund Spenser]], and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] prepare to welcome him to heaven.]]

The ''Imitations of Horace'' followed (1733–38). These were written in the popular Augustan form of the &quot;imitation&quot; of a classical poet, not so much a translation of his works as an updating with contemporary references. Pope used the model of [[Horace]] to satirise life under [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], especially what he regarded as the widespread corruption tainting the country under Walpole's influence and the poor quality of the court's artistic taste.

Pope also added a wholly original poem, ''[[Epistle to Doctor Arbuthnot]]'', as an introduction to the &quot;Imitations&quot;. It reviews his own literary career and includes the famous portraits of Lord [[John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey|Hervey]] (&quot;[[Sporus]]&quot;) and Addison (&quot;Atticus&quot;). In 1738 he wrote the ''Universal Prayer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/pope_a/prayer.html |title=Alexander Pope 'Universal Prayer' |author=Trevor W. McKeown |work=bcy.ca}} [http://www.eighteenthcenturypoetry.org/works/o3702-w0010.shtml Full-text]. Also at the Eighteenth-Century Poetry Archive (ECPA).&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the younger poets whose work Pope admired was [[Joseph Thurston (poet)|Joseph Thurston]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-70938#odnb-9780198614128-e-70938-div1-d584298e173 ODNB Retrieved 16 June 2020.]&lt;/ref&gt; After 1738, Pope himself wrote little. He toyed with the idea of composing a patriotic epic in blank verse called ''Brutus'', but only the opening lines survive. His major work in these years was revising and expanding his masterpiece ''The Dunciad''. Book Four appeared in 1742 and a complete revision of the whole poem the following year. Here Pope replaced the &quot;hero&quot; Lewis Theobald with the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]], [[Colley Cibber]] as &quot;king of dunces&quot;. However, the real focus of the revised poem is Walpole and his works. By now Pope's health, which had never been good, was failing. When told by his physician, on the morning of his death, that he was better, Pope replied: &quot;Here am I, dying of a hundred good symptoms.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ruffhead |first=Owen |title=The Life of Alexander Pope; With a Critical Essay on His Writings and Genius |url=https://archive.org/details/lifealexanderpo00ruffgoog |year=1769 |page=[https://archive.org/details/lifealexanderpo00ruffgoog/page/n479 475]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dyce |first=Alexander |title=The Poetical Works of Alexander Pope, with a Life, by A.

On the previous day, 29 May 1744, Pope had called for a priest and received the [[Last Rites]] of the Catholic Church. He was buried in the nave of [[St Mary's Church, Twickenham]].

==Translations and editions==
===Translation of the ''Iliad''===
Pope had been fascinated by Homer since childhood. In 1713, he announced his plans to publish a translation of the ''[[Iliad]]''. The work would be available by subscription, with one volume appearing every year over the course of six years. Pope secured a revolutionary deal with the publisher Bernard Lintot, which earned him two hundred [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] (£210) a volume, a vast sum at the time.

His translation of the ''Iliad'' appeared between 1715 and 1720. It was acclaimed by [[Samuel Johnson]] as &quot;a performance which no age or nation could hope to equal&quot; (although the classical scholar [[Richard Bentley]] wrote: &quot;It is a pretty poem, Mr. Pope, but you must not call it Homer.&quot;){{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Translation of the ''Odyssey''===
[[File:OdysseyPopeTP1752.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece and title page of a 1752 edition of Pope's ''Odyssey''|alt=]]
Encouraged by the success of the ''Iliad'', Bernard Lintot published Pope's five-volume translation of Homer's ''Odyssey'' in 1725 and 1726.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Homer |name-list-style=amp |translator1=Alexander Pope |translator2=William Broome |translator3=Elijah Fenton |title=The Odyssey of Homer |edition=1st |date=1725–1726 |location=London |publisher=Bernard Lintot}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this work Pope collaborated with [[William Broome]] and [[Elijah Fenton]]: Broome translated eight books (2, 6, 8, 11, 12, 16, 18, 23), Fenton four (1, 4, 19, 20) and Pope the remaining 12.

===Edition of Shakespeare's works===
In this period, Pope was employed by publisher [[Jacob Tonson]] to produce an opulent new edition of Shakespeare.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pope-Shakespeare-Tonson&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Preface to Shakespeare, 1725, Alexander Pope |url=https://shakespearebrasileiro.org/en/preface-to-shakespeare-1725-alexander-pope/ |website=ShakespeareBrasileiro |accessdate=10 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it appeared in 1725, this edition silently regularised Shakespeare's metre and rewrote his verse in a number of places. Pope also removed about 1,560 lines of Shakespearean material, arguing that some appealed to him more than others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pope-Shakespeare-Tonson&quot;/&gt; In 1726, lawyer, poet and pantomime-deviser [[Lewis Theobald]] published a scathing pamphlet called ''Shakespeare Restored'', which catalogued the errors in Pope's work and suggested a number of revisions to the text. This enraged Pope, and thus, Theobald was the main target of Pope's poem ''[[The Dunciad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lewis-Theobald#ref59272 &quot;Lewis Theobald&quot;] in ''Encyclopaedia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second edition of Pope's ''Shakespeare'' appeared in 1728.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pope-Shakespeare-Tonson&quot;/&gt; Aside from making some minor revisions to the preface, it seems that Pope had little to do with it. Most later 18th-century editors of Shakespeare dismissed Pope's creatively motivated approach to textual criticism. Pope's preface continued to be highly rated. It was suggested that Shakespeare's texts were thoroughly contaminated by actors' interpolations and they would influence editors for most of the 18th century.

==Reception==
By the mid-18th century, new fashions in poetry emerged. A decade after Pope's death, Joseph Warton claimed that Pope's style of poetry was not the most excellent form of the art. The Romantic movement that rose to prominence in early 19th-century England was more ambivalent towards his work. Though [[Lord Byron]] identified Pope as one of his chief influences – believing his scathing satire of contemporary English literature ''English Bards and Scotch Reviewers'' to be a continuance of Pope's tradition) – [[William Wordsworth]] found Pope's style fundamentally too decadent to be a representation of the human condition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander Pope' 2000&quot;/&gt; George Gilfillan in his study of 1856 described Pope's talent as &quot;a rose peering into the summer air, fine, rather than powerful&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;George Gilfillan, ''The Genius and Poetry of Pope'', The Poetical Works of Alexander Pope, Vol. 11, 1856.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, Pope's reputation revived. Pope's work was, of course, full of references to the people and places of his time, and these aided people's understanding of the past. The post-war period stressed the power of Pope's poetry, recognising that Pope's immersion in Christian and Biblical culture lent depth to his poetry. For example, Maynard Mack, a Pope scholar of the later 20th century, argued that Pope's moral vision demanded as much respect as his technical excellence. Between 1953 and 1967 the definitive Twickenham edition of Pope's poems was published in ten volumes, including an index volume.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander Pope' 2000&quot;/&gt;

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine published a portrait, supposedly of Hooke, on 3 July 1939.  However, when the source was traced by [[Ashley Montagu]], it was found to lack a verifiable connection to Hooke.  Moreover, Montagu found that two contemporary written descriptions of Hooke's appearance agreed with one another, but that neither matched the ''Time'''s portrait.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Montagu, M. F.

In 2003, historian [[Lisa Jardine]] claimed that a recently discovered portrait was of Hooke,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Jardine | first = Lisa | title = The Curious Life of Robert Hooke | publisher = Harper Collins | year = 2003 | pages = 15–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this claim was disproved by William Jensen of the [[University of Cincinnati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraries.uc.edu/source/volfour/oesper2.html |title=Source- The UC Libraries Newsletter |publisher=Libraries.uc.edu |date=4 February 2011 |accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The portrait identified by Jardine depicts the Flemish scholar [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]].

Other possible likenesses of Hooke include the following:
* A seal used by Hooke displays an unusual profile portrait of a man's head, which some have argued portrays Hooke.
* The engraved frontispiece to the 1728 edition of [[Ephraim Chambers|Chambers' ''Cyclopedia'']] shows a drawing of a bust of Robert Hooke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.she-philosopher.com/players/RHsplash.html |title=Robert Hooke |publisher=she-philosopher.com |date=17 August 2007 |accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which the drawing is based on an actual work of art is unknown.

The window was destroyed in the [[1993 Bishopsgate bombing]].

In 2003, amateur history painter Rita Greer embarked on a self-funded project to memorialise Hooke. Her project aimed to produce credible images of him, both painted and drawn, that she believes fit the descriptions of him by his contemporaries John Aubrey and Richard Waller. Greer's images of Hooke, his life and work have been used for TV programmes in UK and US, in books, magazines and for PR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Burgan | first = Michael | title = Robert Hooke Natural Philosopher and Scientific Explorer | publisher = Compass Point Books|location= Minneapolis, Minnesota | year = 2008 | pages = Cover, 21, 26, 45, 65, 77, 88, 96, 98–99, 101| isbn = 978-0756533151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Fekany Lee | first = Kimberly | title = Cell Scientists: from Leeuwenhoek to Fuchs | publisher = Compass Point Books, Minneapolis, Minnesota | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-7565-3964-1 | url = https://archive.org/details/cellscientistsfr0000leek }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Chapman | first = Allan | title = England's Leonardo Robert Hooke and the Seventeenth-Century Scientific Revolution | publisher = Institute of Physics Publishing Ltd. | year = 2005 | pages = Portrait of Robert Hooke inside dust jacket and last page of plates | isbn = 978-0-7503-0987-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Gresham College memorial portrait of Robert Hooke | journal = Dome, the Magazine of the Friends of St. Paul's Cathedral | issue = 46 | page = 17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Chapman | first = Allan | title = Robert Hooke: the forgotten genius of physics | journal = Interactions | issue = April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Rita's portraits of Hooke sought after across UK | journal = Petersfield Post | issue = 21 May | year = 2008 | page  = 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Unveiling of memorial portrait of Robert Hooke as astronomer and inventor | journal = Open House.

In 2019 Larry Griffing championed the position that a contemporary portrait by famed painter [[Mary Beale]] of an unknown sitter and referred to as &quot;Portrait of a Mathematician&quot; was actually Hooke, noting that the physical features of the sitter in the portrait match his. The figure points to a drawing of elliptical motion which appears to match an unpublished manuscript created by Hooke. The painting also includes an [[orrey]] depicting the same principle. Griffing believes that buildings included in the image are of Lowther Castle and pointedly its Church of St. Michael. The church was renovated under one of Hooke's architectural commissions, which Beale would have gained familiarity with when commissioned by the Lowther family. Griffing theorizes that the painting would've been owned by the Royal Society but was purposefully abandoned when Newton as its president moved the Society's official residence in 1710.&lt;ref name=Griffing/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=This 17th Century Scientist Discovered the Cell.

In [[computing]], a '''core dump''',{{efn|The term '''core''' is obsolete on contemporary hardware, but is used on many systems for historical reasons.}} '''memory dump''', '''crash dump''', '''system dump''', or '''ABEND dump'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AIX 7.1 information|url=http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/aix/v7r1/index.jsp}}{{Dead link|date=July 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of the recorded state of the working [[Computer storage|memory]] of a [[computer program]] at a specific time, generally when the program has [[crash (computing)|crashed]] or otherwise terminated abnormally.&lt;ref&gt;{{man|4|core|Solaris|Process core file}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice, other key pieces of [[Context switch|program state]] are usually dumped at the same time, including the [[processor register]]s, which may include the program counter and stack pointer, memory management information, and other processor and operating system flags and information. A '''snapshot  dump''' (or '''snap dump''') is a memory dump requested by the [[computer operator]] or by the running program, after which the program is able to continue. Core dumps are often used to assist in diagnosing and [[debugging]] errors in computer programs.

On many operating systems, a [[fatal exception]] in a program automatically triggers a core dump. By extension, the phrase &quot;to dump core&quot; has come to mean in many cases, any fatal error, regardless of whether a record of the program memory exists.  The term &quot;core dump&quot;, &quot;memory dump&quot;, or just &quot;dump&quot; has also become jargon to indicate any output of a large amount of raw data for further examination or other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techopedia.com/definition/23340/database-dump|title=What is a Database Dump? - Definition from Techopedia|author=Cory Janssen|work=Techopedia.com|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sophos.com/en-us/support/knowledgebase/111474.aspx|title=How to configure a computer to capture a complete memory dump|date=12 July 2010|work=sophos.com|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The name comes from [[magnetic core memory]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], ''s.v.'' 'core'&lt;/ref&gt; the principal form of [[random access memory]] from the 1950s to the 1970s. The name has remained long after magnetic core technology became obsolete.

Earliest core dumps were paper printouts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=storage dump definition|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/storage+dump}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of the contents of memory, typically arranged in columns of [[octal]] or [[hexadecimal]] numbers (a &quot;[[hex dump]]&quot;), sometimes accompanied by their interpretations as machine language instructions, text strings, or decimal or floating-point numbers (''cf.'' [[disassembler]]).

As memory sizes increased and post-mortem analysis utilities were developed, dumps were written to magnetic media like tape or disk.

Instead of only displaying the contents of the applicable memory, modern operating systems typically generate a file containing an image of the memory belonging to the crashed process, or the memory images of parts of the [[address space]] related to that process, along with other information such as the values of processor registers, program counter, system flags, and other information useful in determining the root cause of the crash. These files can be viewed as text, printed, or analysed with specialised tools such as elfdump on [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems, [[objdump]] and [[kdump (Linux)|kdump]] on [[Linux]], [[WinDbg]] on Microsoft Windows, Valgrind, or other debuggers.

==Uses==
Core dumps can serve as useful debugging aids in several situations.  On early standalone or [[batch processing|batch-processing]] systems, core dumps allowed a user to debug a program without monopolizing the (very expensive) computing facility for debugging; a printout could also be more convenient than debugging using [[front panel]] switches and lights.

On shared computers, whether time-sharing, batch processing, or server systems, core dumps allow off-line debugging of the [[operating system]], so that the system can go back into operation immediately.

Core dumps allow a user to save a crash for later or off-site analysis, or comparison with other crashes.  For [[embedded system|embedded computers]], it may be impractical to support debugging on the computer itself, so analysis of a dump may take place on a different computer.  Some operating systems such as early versions of [[Unix]] did not support attaching [[debugger]]s to running processes, so core dumps were necessary to run a debugger on a process's memory contents.

Core dumps can be used to capture data freed during [[dynamic memory allocation]] and may thus be used to retrieve information from a program that is no longer running. In the absence of an interactive debugger, the core dump may be used by an assiduous programmer to determine the error from direct examination.

== Analysis ==
A core dump represents the complete contents of the dumped regions of the address space of the dumped process.  Depending on the operating system, the dump may contain few or no data structures to aid interpretation of the memory regions.  In these systems, successful interpretation requires that the program or user trying to interpret the dump understands the structure of the program's memory use.

A debugger can use a [[symbol table]], if one exists, to help the programmer interpret dumps, identifying variables symbolically and displaying source code; if the symbol table is not available, less interpretation of the dump is possible, but there might still be enough possible to determine the cause of the problem.  There are also special-purpose tools called [[dump analyzer]]s to analyze dumps. One popular tool, available on many operating systems, is the GNU binutils' [[objdump]].

On modern [[Unix-like]] operating systems, administrators and programmers can read core dump files using the GNU Binutils [[Binary File Descriptor library]] (BFD), and the [[GNU Debugger]] (gdb) and objdump that use this library.  This library will supply the raw data for a given address in a memory region from a core dump; it does not know anything about variables or data structures in that memory region, so the application using the library to read the core dump will have to determine the addresses of variables and determine the layout of data structures itself, for example by using the symbol table for the program undergoing debugging.

Analysts of crash dumps from [[Linux]] systems can use [[kdump (Linux)|kdump]] or the Linux Kernel Crash Dump (LKCD).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Core dumps can save the context (state) of a process at a given state for returning to it later. Systems can be made highly available by transferring core between processors, sometimes via core dump files themselves.

Core can also be dumped onto a remote host over a network (which is a security risk).&lt;ref&gt;

== Core dump files ==

=== Format ===

In older and simpler operating systems, each process had a contiguous address-space, so a dump file was sometimes simply a file with the sequence of bytes, digits,{{efn|name=decimal|Some older machines were [[Decimal computer|decimal]].}} characters{{efn|name=decimal}} or words. On other early machines a dump file contained discrete records each containing a storage address and the associated contents. On early machines the dump was often written by a stand-alone dump program rather than by the application or the operating system.

&lt;!-- I doubt that this was first; please add older examples if you know of any. --&gt; 
On the [[IBM System/360]], the standard operating systems wrote formatted ABEND and SNAP dumps, with the addresses, registers, storage contents, etc., all converted to printable forms. Later releases added the ability to write unformatted{{efn|In the sense that the records were binary rather than formatted for printing.}} dumps, called at that time core image dumps.

In modern operating systems, a process address space may have gaps, and share pages with other processes or files, so more elaborate representations are used; they may also include other information about the state of the program at the time of the dump.

In [[Unix-like]] systems, core dumps generally use the standard [[executable]] image-[[file format|format]]:
* [[a.out]] in older versions of [[Unix]],
* [[Executable and Linkable Format|ELF]] in modern [[Linux]], [[UNIX System V|System V]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], and [[BSD]] systems,
* [[Mach-O]] in [[macOS]], ''etc.''

*The Damage Assessment and Repair (DAR) facility added an automatic unformatted{{efn|IBM provided tools for extracting and formatting data from an unformatted dump; those tools{{efn|Initially the batch utility IMDPRDMP; currently the TSO command and [[ISPF]] panel repertoire for Interactive Problem Control System (IPCS).}} often made it easier to deal with an unformatted dump than even a small formatted dump.}} dump to the dataset &lt;code&gt;SYS1.DUMP&lt;/code&gt;{{efn|There have been several name changes since then, and [[z/OS]] supports multiple system dump data sets with arbitrary dsnames.}} at the time of failure as well as a console dump requested by the operator. 
*The newer transaction dump is very similar to older forms of dumps.

==== Unix-like ====
* Since Solaris&amp;nbsp;8, system utility &lt;code&gt;coreadm&lt;/code&gt; allows the name and location of core files to be configured.
* Dumps of user processes are traditionally created as &lt;code&gt;core&lt;/code&gt;.  On Linux (since versions 2.4.21 and 2.6 of the [[Linux kernel mainline]]), a different name can be specified via [[procfs]] using the &lt;code&gt;/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern&lt;/code&gt; configuration file; the specified name can also be a template that contains tags substituted by, for example, the executable filename, the process ID, or the reason for the dump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* System-wide dumps on modern Unix-like systems often appear as &lt;code&gt;vmcore&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;vmcore.incomplete&lt;/code&gt;.

==== Others ====
* Systems such as [[Microsoft Windows]], which use [[filename extension]]s, may use extension &lt;code&gt;.dmp&lt;/code&gt;; for example, core dumps may be named &lt;code&gt;memory.dmp&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;\Minidump\Mini051509-01.dmp&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Windows memory dumps ===
[[Microsoft Windows]] supports two memory dump formats, described below.

==== Kernel-mode dumps ====
{{Main article|Blue Screen of Death}}

There are five types of kernel-mode dumps:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/varieties-of-kernel-mode-dump-files|title=Varieties of Kernel-Mode Dump Files|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Complete memory dump{{snd}} contains full physical memory for the target system.
* Kernel memory dump{{snd}} contains all the memory in use by the kernel at the time of the crash.
* Small memory dump{{snd}} contains various info such as the stop code, parameters, list of loaded device drivers, etc.
* Automatic Memory Dump (Windows 8 and later){{snd}} same as Kernel memory dump, but if the [[Paging#PAGEFILE-SYS|paging file]] is both System Managed and too small to capture the Kernel memory dump, it will automatically increase the paging file to at least the size of RAM for four weeks, then reduce it to the smaller size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/automatic-memory-dump|title=Automatic Memory Dump|date=28 November 2017|publisher=Microsoft|language=en-us|access-date=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Active memory dump (Windows 10 and later){{snd}} contains most of the memory in use by the kernel and user mode applications.
To analyze the Windows kernel-mode dumps [[WinDbg|Debugging Tools for Windows]] are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn745912(v=vs.85).aspx|title=Getting Started with WinDbg (Kernel-Mode)|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== {{Anchor|MINIDUMP}}User-mode memory dumps ====
User-mode memory dump, also known as ''minidump'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680369(v=vs.85).aspx|title=Minidump Files|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a memory dump of a single process. It contains selected data records: full or partial (filtered) process memory; list of the [[Thread (computing)|threads]] with their [[call stack]]s and state (such as [[Processor register|registers]] or [[Win32 Thread Information Block|TEB]]); information about [[Handle (computing)|handles]] to the kernel objects; list of loaded and unloaded [[Dynamic-link library|libraries]]. Full list of options available in &lt;code&gt;MINIDUMP_TYPE&lt;/code&gt; enum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680519(v=vs.85).aspx|title=MINIDUMP_TYPE enumeration|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Space missions ==
The [[NASA]] [[Voyager program]] was probably the first craft to routinely utilize the core dump feature in the Deep Space segment. The core dump feature is a mandatory telemetry feature for the Deep Space segment as it has been proven to minimize system diagnostic costs{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}. The Voyager craft uses routine core dumps to spot memory damage from [[cosmic ray]] events.

Space Mission core dump systems are mostly based on existing toolkits for the target CPU or subsystem. However, over the duration of a mission the core dump subsystem may be substantially modified or enhanced for the specific needs of the mission.

==Coordinate systems==
There are two longitudinal coordinate systems in use for Vesta, with [[prime meridian]]s separated by 150°. The [[IAU]] established a coordinate system in 1997 based on ''Hubble'' photos, with the prime meridian running through the center of [[Olbers Regio]], a dark feature 200&amp;nbsp;km across. When ''Dawn'' arrived at Vesta, mission scientists found that the location of the pole assumed by the IAU was off by 10°, so that the IAU coordinate system drifted across the surface of Vesta at 0.06° per year, and also that Olbers Regio was not discernible from up close, and so was not adequate to define the prime meridian with the precision they needed. They corrected the pole, but also established a new prime meridian 4° from the center of [[Claudia (crater)|Claudia]], a sharply defined crater 700 meters across, which they say results in a more logical set of mapping quadrangles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Claudian&quot;/&gt; All NASA publications, including images and maps of Vesta, use the Claudian meridian, which is unacceptable to the IAU. The IAU Working Group on Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements recommended a coordinate system, correcting the pole but rotating the Claudian longitude by 150° to coincide with Olbers Regio.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAUcoordinates&quot;/&gt; It was accepted by the IAU, though it disrupts the maps prepared by the ''Dawn'' team, which had been positioned so they would not bisect any major surface features.&lt;ref name=Claudian/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawncoordinates&quot;/&gt;

==Physical characteristics==
[[File:Vesta full mosaic.jpg|thumb|Composite greyscale image of Vesta taken by [[Dawn (spacecraft)|''Dawn'']]]]
[[File:Iau dozen.jpg|thumb|The [[IAU definition of planet#First draft proposal|IAU 2006 draft proposal]] on the definition of a planet listed Vesta as a candidate.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAU-draft2006&quot;/&gt; Vesta is shown fourth from the left along the bottom row.]]

Vesta is the second-most-massive body in the [[asteroid belt]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Baer2007&quot;/&gt; though only 28% as massive as Ceres.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitjeva05&quot;/&gt; Vesta's density is lower than those of the four [[terrestrial planet]]s, but higher than that of most asteroids and all of the moons in the Solar System except [[Io (moon)|Io]]. Vesta's surface area is about the same as that of [[Pakistan]] (about 800,000 square kilometers).{{efn|1=Or Venezuela or Tanzania; somewhat larger than Texas and ten times that of the UK.}} It has a differentiated interior.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hubble&quot;/&gt; Vesta is only slightly larger ({{val|525.4|0.2|u=km}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Russell2012&quot;/&gt;) than [[2 Pallas]] ({{val|512|3|u=km}}) in volume,&lt;ref name=&quot;Carry2009&quot;/&gt; but is about 25% more massive.

Vesta's shape is close to a gravitationally relaxed [[oblate spheroid]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas1997b&quot;/&gt; but the large concavity and protrusion at the southern pole (see '[[#Surface features|Surface features]]' below) combined with a mass less than {{val|5|e=20|u=kg}} precluded Vesta from automatically being considered a [[dwarf planet]] under [[IAU definition of planet#Draft proposal|International Astronomical Union (IAU) Resolution XXVI 5]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IAU0601&quot;/&gt; A 2012 analysis of Vesta's shape&lt;ref name=&quot;Fu 2013&quot;/&gt; and gravity field using data gathered by the [[Dawn (spacecraft)|''Dawn'' spacecraft]] has shown that Vesta is currently not in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Russell2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Asmar 2012&quot;/&gt;

Temperatures on the surface have been estimated to lie between about −20&amp;nbsp;°C with the [[Sun]] overhead, dropping to about −190&amp;nbsp;°C at the winter pole. Typical daytime and nighttime temperatures are −60&amp;nbsp;°C and −130&amp;nbsp;°C respectively. This estimate is for 6 May 1996, very close to [[perihelion]], although details vary somewhat with the seasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mueller01&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Viewing the South Pole of Vesta.jpg|thumb|South pole of Vesta, showing the extent of Rheasilvia crater.]]

Prior to the arrival of the [[Dawn (spacecraft)|''Dawn'' spacecraft]], some Vestan surface features had already been resolved using the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and ground-based telescopes (e.g. the [[W. M. Keck Observatory|Keck Observatory]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Zellner2005&quot;/&gt; The arrival of ''Dawn'' in July 2011 revealed the complex surface of Vesta in detail.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaumann2012&quot;/&gt;

===Rheasilvia and Veneneia craters===
{{main|Rheasilvia|Veneneia}}

The most prominent of these surface features are two enormous craters, the {{convert|500|km|mi|0|adj=on}}-wide Rheasilvia crater, centered near the south pole, and the {{convert|400|km|mi|0}} wide Veneneia crater. The Rheasilvia crater is younger and overlies the Veneneia crater.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schenk2012&quot;/&gt; The ''Dawn'' science team named the younger, more prominent crater [[Rheasilvia]], after the mother of Romulus and Remus and a mythical [[vestal virgin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rheasilvianamed&quot;/&gt; Its width is 95% of the mean diameter of Vesta. The crater is about {{convert|19|km|mi|0}} deep. A central peak rises 23&amp;nbsp;km above the lowest measured part of the crater floor and the highest measured part of the crater rim is 31&amp;nbsp;km above the crater floor low point. It is estimated that the impact responsible excavated about 1% of the volume of Vesta, and it is likely that the [[Vesta family]] and [[V-type asteroid]]s are the products of this collision. If this is the case, then the fact that 10-km fragments have survived bombardment until the present indicates that the crater is at most only about 1&amp;nbsp;billion years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;Binzel1997&quot;/&gt; It would also be the site of origin of the [[HED meteorite]]s. All the known V-type asteroids taken together account for only about 6% of the ejected volume, with the rest presumably either in small fragments, ejected by approaching the 3:1&amp;nbsp;[[Kirkwood gap]], or perturbed away by the [[Yarkovsky effect]] or [[radiation pressure]]. [[Spectroscopy|Spectroscopic]] analyses of the Hubble images have shown that this crater has penetrated deep through several distinct layers of the crust, and possibly into the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]], as indicated by spectral signatures of [[olivine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas1997b&quot;/&gt;

The large peak at the center of Rheasilvia is {{convert|20|to(-)|25|km|mi}} high and {{convert|180|km|mi}} wide,&lt;ref name=&quot;Schenk2012&quot;/&gt; and is possibly a result of a planetary-scale impact.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karimi&amp;Dombard16&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode=2016JGRE..121.1786K | first1=S | last1=Karimi | title=On the possibility of viscoelastic deformation of the large south polar craters and true polar wander on the asteroid Vesta | date=2016 | last2=Dombard | first2=A.J. | journal=Journal of Geophysical Research | volume=121 | issue=9 | pages=1786–1797 | doi=10.1002/2016JE005064| doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Old unnamed equatorial basin on 4 Vesta.png|thumb|Feralia Planitia, an old, degraded crater near Vesta's equator (green and blue). It is 270&amp;nbsp;km across and predates Rheasilvia (green at bottom).]]

Several old, degraded craters rival Rheasilvia and Veneneia in size, though none are quite so large. They include [[Feralia Planitia]], shown at right, which is 270&amp;nbsp;km across.&lt;ref name=&quot;Av-10&quot;/&gt; More-recent, sharper craters range up to {{convert|158|km|mi|0}} Varronilla and {{convert|196|km|mi|0}} Postumia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Planetary Names&quot;/&gt;

====&quot;Snowman craters&quot;====
The &quot;snowman craters&quot; is an informal name given to a group of three adjacent craters in Vesta's northern hemisphere. Their official names from largest to smallest (west to east) are Marcia, Calpurnia, and Minucia. Marcia is the youngest and cross-cuts Calpurnia. Minucia is the oldest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams2014&quot;/&gt;

===Troughs===
The majority of the equatorial region of Vesta is sculpted by a series of parallel troughs. The largest is named [[Divalia Fossa]] (10–20&amp;nbsp;km wide, 465&amp;nbsp;km long). Despite the fact that Vesta is a one-seventh the size of the Moon, Divalia Fossa dwarfs the [[Grand Canyon]]. A second series, inclined to the equator, is found further north. The largest of the northern troughs is named [[Saturnalia Fossa]] (≈ 40&amp;nbsp;km wide, &gt; 370&amp;nbsp;km long). These troughs are thought to be large-scale [[graben]] resulting from the impacts that created Rheasilvia and Veneneia craters, respectively. They are some of the [[List of largest rifts and valleys in the Solar System|longest chasms in the Solar System]], nearly as long as [[Ithaca Chasma]] on [[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]]. The troughs may be graben that formed after another asteroid collided with Vesta, a process that can happen only in a body that, like Vesta, is differentiated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buczkowski2012&quot;/&gt; Vesta's differentiation is one of the reasons why scientists consider it a protoplanet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stunted Planet&quot;/&gt;

===Surface composition===
Compositional information from the visible and infrared spectrometer (VIR), gamma-ray and neutron detector (GRaND), and framing camera (FC), all indicate that the majority of the surface composition of Vesta is consistent with the composition of the howardite, eucrite, and diogenite meteorites.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeSanctis2012a&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Prettyman2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reddy2012&quot;/&gt; The Rheasilvia region is richest in diogenite, consistent with the Rheasilvia-forming impact excavating material from deeper within Vesta. The presence of olivine within the Rheasilvia region would also be consistent with excavation of mantle material. However, olivine has only been detected in localized regions of the northern hemisphere, not within Rheasilvia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ammannito2013&quot;/&gt; The origin of this olivine is currently unknown.

===Features associated with volatiles===
Pitted terrain has been observed in four craters on Vesta: Marcia, Cornelia, Numisia and Licinia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Denevi2012&quot;/&gt; The formation of the pitted terrain is proposed to be degassing of impact-heated volatile-bearing material. Along with the pitted terrain, curvilinear gullies are found in Marcia and Cornelia craters. The curvilinear gullies end in lobate deposits, which are sometimes covered by pitted terrain, and are proposed to form by the transient flow of liquid water after buried deposits of ice were melted by the heat of the impacts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scully2014&quot;/&gt; Hydrated materials have also been detected, many of which are associated with areas of dark material.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeSanctis2012b&quot;/&gt; Consequently, dark material is thought to be largely composed of carbonaceous chondrite, which was deposited on the surface by impacts. Carbonaceous chondrites are comparatively rich in mineralogically bound OH.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reddy2012&quot;/&gt;

==Geology==
[[File:Vestan interior PIA15510.jpg|thumb|Cut-away schematic of Vestan core, mantle, and crust]]
[[File:MillbillillieMeteorite.jpg|thumb|right|Eucrite meteorite]]

There is a large collection of potential samples from Vesta accessible to scientists, in the form of over 1200&amp;nbsp;[[HED meteorite]]s (Vestan [[achondrite]]s), giving insight into Vesta's geologic history and structure. [[NASA Infrared Telescope Facility]] (NASA IRTF) studies of asteroid {{mpl|(237442) 1999 TA|10}} suggest that it originated from deeper within Vesta than the HED meteorites&lt;ref name=&quot;Vestainterior&quot;/&gt;

Vesta is thought to consist of a metallic iron–nickel [[planetary core|core]] 214–226&amp;nbsp;km in diameter,&lt;ref name=&quot;Russell2012&quot;/&gt; an overlying rocky [[olivine]] [[mantle (geology)|mantle]], with a surface [[crust (geology)|crust]]. From the first appearance of [[calcium–aluminium-rich inclusion]]s (the first solid matter in the [[Solar System]], forming about 4.567&amp;nbsp;billion years ago), a likely time line is as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghosh1998&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Righter1997&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Drake2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sahijpal2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gupta2010&quot;/&gt;

Vesta is the only known intact asteroid that has been resurfaced in this manner. Because of this, some scientists refer to Vesta as a protoplanet.&lt;ref name=&quot;nasa-dawn20110329&quot;/&gt; However, the presence of [[iron meteorite]]s and achondritic meteorite classes without identified parent bodies indicates that there once were other differentiated [[planetesimal]]s with [[igneous]] histories, which have since been shattered by impacts.

On the basis of the sizes of [[V-type asteroid]]s (thought to be pieces of Vesta's crust ejected during large impacts), and the depth of Rheasilvia crater (see below), the crust is thought to be roughly {{convert|10|km|mi|0}} thick.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yamaguchi1995&quot;/&gt;
Findings from the ''Dawn'' spacecraft have found evidence that the troughs that wrap around Vesta could be graben formed by impact-induced faulting (see Troughs section above), meaning that Vesta has more complex geology than other asteroids. Vesta's differentiated interior implies that it was in hydrostatic equilibrium and thus a dwarf planet in the past, but it is not today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schenk2012&quot;/&gt; The impacts that created the Rheasilvia and Veneneia craters occurred when Vesta was no longer warm and plastic enough to return to an equilibrium shape, distorting its once rounded shape and prohibiting it from being classified as a dwarf planet today.

===Regolith===
Vesta's surface is covered by [[regolith]] distinct from that found on the [[Moon]] or asteroids such as [[25143 Itokawa|Itokawa]]. This is because [[space weathering]] acts differently. Vesta's surface shows no significant trace of [[nanophase iron]] because the [[Asteroid impact|impact]] speeds on Vesta are too low to make rock melting and vaporization an appreciable process. Instead, regolith evolution is dominated by [[brecciation]] and subsequent mixing of bright and dark components.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pieters2012&quot;/&gt; The dark component is probably due to the infall of [[carbon]]aceous material, whereas the bright component is the original Vesta basaltic soil.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCord2012&quot;/&gt;

==Fragments==
Some [[small Solar System body|small Solar System bodies]] are suspected to be fragments of Vesta caused by impacts. The [[Vesta family|Vestian]] asteroids and [[HED meteorite]]s are examples. The [[V-type asteroid]] [[1929 Kollaa]] has been determined to have a composition akin to cumulate [[eucrite]] meteorites, indicating its origin deep within Vesta's crust.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelley2003&quot;/&gt;

Vesta is currently one of only six identified [[Solar System]] bodies of which we have physical samples, coming from a number of meteorites suspected to be Vestan fragments. It is estimated that 1 out of 16 meteorites originated from Vesta.&lt;ref name=&quot;siliconvalleyastrolecture&quot;/&gt; The other identified Solar System samples are from Earth itself, [[Martian meteorite|meteorites from Mars]], [[Lunar meteorite|meteorites from the Moon]], and [[Sample return mission|samples returned]] from the [[Moon]], the comet [[Wild 2]], and the asteroid [[25143 Itokawa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nasa2011-vesta&quot;/&gt;{{efn|1=Note that there is very strong evidence that [[6 Hebe]] is the parent body for H-[[chondrites]], one of the most common meteorite types.}}

In 1981, a proposal for an asteroid mission was submitted to the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA). Named the '''Asteroidal Gravity Optical and Radar Analysis''' ('''AGORA'''), this [[spacecraft]] was to launch some time in 1990–1994 and perform two flybys of large asteroids. The preferred target for this mission was Vesta. AGORA would reach the asteroid belt either by a [[gravitational slingshot]] trajectory past Mars or by means of a small [[ion engine]]. However, the proposal was refused by the ESA. A joint [[NASA]]–ESA asteroid mission was then drawn up for a '''Multiple Asteroid Orbiter with Solar Electric Propulsion''' ('''MAOSEP'''), with one of the mission profiles including an orbit of Vesta. NASA indicated they were not interested in an asteroid mission. Instead, the ESA set up a technological study of a spacecraft with an ion drive. Other missions to the asteroid belt were proposed in the 1980s by France, Germany, Italy and the United States, but none were approved.&lt;ref name=&quot;ulivi_harland08&quot;/&gt; Exploration of Vesta by fly-by and [[Deep Impact (spacecraft)|impacting penetrator]] was the second main target of the first plan of the multi-aimed Soviet [[Vesta mission]], developed in cooperation with European countries for realisation in 1991–1994 but canceled due to the Soviet Union disbanding.
[[File:Dawn Flight Configuration 2.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's conception of ''[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]]'' orbiting Vesta]]
In the early 1990s, NASA initiated the [[Discovery Program]], which was intended to be a series of low-cost scientific missions. In 1996, the program's study team recommended a mission to explore the asteroid belt using a spacecraft with an ion engine as a high priority. Funding for this program remained problematic for several years, but by 2004 the ''[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]]'' vehicle had passed its critical design review&lt;ref name=&quot;Russell2007&quot;/&gt; and construction proceeded.

It launched on 27 September 2007 as the first space mission to Vesta. On 3 May 2011, ''Dawn'' acquired its first targeting image 1.2 million kilometers from Vesta.&lt;ref name=&quot;pr2011-138&quot;/&gt; On 16 July 2011, NASA confirmed that it received telemetry from ''Dawn'' indicating that the spacecraft successfully entered Vesta's orbit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vega2011&quot;/&gt; It was scheduled to orbit Vesta for one year, until July 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawntimeline&quot;/&gt; ''Dawn''{{'s}} arrival coincided with late summer in the southern hemisphere of Vesta, with the large crater at Vesta's south pole ([[Rheasilvia]]) in sunlight. Because a season on Vesta lasts eleven months, the northern hemisphere, including anticipated compression fractures opposite the crater, would become visible to ''Dawn''{{'s}} cameras before it left orbit.&lt;ref name=&quot;DawnMission&quot;/&gt; ''Dawn'' left orbit around Vesta on 4 September 2012 {{nobreak|11:26 p.m. PDT}} to travel to [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawndeparture&quot;/&gt;

NASA/DLR released imagery and summary information from a survey orbit, two high-altitude orbits (60–70&amp;nbsp;m/pixel) and a low-altitude mapping orbit (20&amp;nbsp;m/pixel), including digital terrain models, videos and atlases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russell2013&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roatsch2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roatsch2013&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;journeyaboveVesta&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dawn_gis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NASADawn&quot;/&gt; Scientists also used ''Dawn'' to calculate Vesta's precise mass and gravity field. The subsequent determination of the J&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; component yielded a core diameter estimate of about 220&amp;nbsp;km assuming a crustal density similar to that of the HED.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russell2013&quot;/&gt;

Detailed images retrieved during the high-altitude (60–70&amp;nbsp;m/pixel) and low-altitude (~20&amp;nbsp;m/pixel) mapping orbits are available on the [http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/vesta_dawn_gallery_2.asp Dawn Mission website of JPL/NASA].

== Visibility ==
[[File:Asteroid Vesta.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.75|Annotated image from Earth's surface in June 2007 with (4) Vesta]]

Its size and unusually bright surface make Vesta the brightest asteroid, and it is occasionally visible to the [[naked eye]] from dark skies (without [[light pollution]]). In May and June 2007, Vesta reached a peak [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] of +5.4, the brightest since 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;SkyTelescope2007a&quot;/&gt; At that time, [[opposition (astronomy)|opposition]] and [[perihelion]] were only a few weeks apart.&lt;ref name=&quot;SkyTelescope2007b&quot;/&gt; It was brighter still at its 22 June 2018 opposition, reaching a magnitude of +5.3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Cosmic Challenge: The Ultimate Observing List for Amateurs | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=21 October 2010 | last=Harrington | first=Philip S. | page=75 | isbn=9781139493680}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Less favorable oppositions during late autumn 2008 in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] still had Vesta at a magnitude of from +6.5 to +7.3.&lt;ref name=James2008/&gt; Even when in [[astronomical conjunction|conjunction]] with the Sun, Vesta will have a magnitude around +8.5; thus from a pollution-free sky it can be observed with [[binoculars]] even at [[Elongation (astronomy)|elongations]] much smaller than near opposition.&lt;ref name=&quot;James2008&quot;/&gt;

===2010–2011===
In 2010, Vesta reached opposition in the [[constellation]] of [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]] on the night of 17–18 February, at about magnitude 6.1,&lt;ref name=&quot;Horizons&quot;/&gt; a brightness that makes it visible in binocular range but generally not for the [[Naked-eye stars|naked eye]]. Under perfect dark sky conditions where all light pollution is absent it might be visible to an experienced observer without the use of a telescope or binoculars. Vesta came to opposition again on 5 August 2011, in the constellation of [[Capricornus]] at about magnitude 5.6.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horizons&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MPC-eph&quot;/&gt;

===2012–2013===
Vesta was at opposition again on 9 December 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;NightSkyOnline&quot;/&gt; According to ''[[Sky and Telescope]]'' magazine, this year Vesta came within about 6 degrees of [[1 Ceres]] during the winter of 2012 and spring 2013.&lt;ref name=flanders/&gt; Vesta orbits the Sun in 3.63 years and Ceres in 4.6 years, so every 17.4 years Vesta overtakes Ceres (the previous overtaking was in April 1996).&lt;ref name=&quot;flanders&quot;/&gt; On 1 December 2012, Vesta had a magnitude of 6.6, but it had decreased to 8.4 by 1 May 2013.&lt;ref name=flanders/&gt;

===2014===

Ceres and Vesta came within one degree of each other in the night sky in July 2014.&lt;ref name=flanders/&gt;

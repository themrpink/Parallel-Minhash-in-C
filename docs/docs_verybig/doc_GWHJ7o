Reviewing the 1999 revival, [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] wrote that it displayed the contradictory elements in Coward's writings, a show &quot;traditionally seen as a patriotic pageant about the first 30 years of the century&quot; but strongly anti-militaristic and portraying &quot;the anger that bubbles away among the working class&quot;. He concluded, &quot;''Cavalcade'' is actually about the way the high hopes at the start of the century have turned to senseless slaughter and hectic hedonism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Billington, Michael. [https://www.theguardian.com/culture/1999/nov/30/artsfeatures2 &quot;Oh what a ghastly war&quot;], ''The Guardian'', 30 November 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
A record with the title ''Cavalcade Suite'' was made by the New Mayfair Orchestra. It contained a selection of the contemporary songs used in ''Cavalcade'', introduced by Coward. At the end he speaks the toast to England from the play. (HMV C2289)

Coward himself recorded &quot;Lover of My Dreams&quot; (the Mirabelle Waltz Song), with, on the reverse, &quot;Twentieth Century Blues&quot;, played by the New Mayfair Novelty Orchestra, with vocal by an unnamed singer identified by Mander and Mitchenson as [[Al Bowlly]]. (HMV B4001)

''Cavalcade—Vocal Medley'': On this Coward sings &quot;Soldiers of the Queen&quot;, &quot;Goodbye, Dolly&quot;, &quot;Lover of My Dreams&quot;, &quot;I do Like to be Beside the Seside&quot;, &quot;Goodbye, My Bluebell&quot;, &quot;Alexander's Ragtime Band&quot;, &quot;Everybody's Doing It&quot;, &quot;Let's All Go Down the Strand&quot;, &quot;If You were the Only Girl&quot;, &quot;Take Me Back to Dear Old Blighty&quot;, &quot;There's a Long, Long Trail&quot;, &quot;Keep the Home Fires Burning&quot;, and &quot;Twentieth Century Blues&quot;. (HMV C2431).

Coward later recorded &quot;Twentieth Century Blues&quot; on the LP album &quot;Noël Coward in New York&quot;, with an orchestra conducted by [[Peter Matz]]. (Columbia ML 5163)

      <text bytes="14595" xml:space="preserve">{{short description|The tendency of some materials to change the value of their electrical resistance when placed in an external magnetic field}}

'''Magnetoresistance''' is the tendency of a material (often ferromagnetic) to change the value of its [[electrical resistance]] in an externally-applied [[magnetic field]]. There are a variety of effects that can be called magnetoresistance. Some occur in bulk non-magnetic metals and semiconductors, such as geometrical magnetoresistance, [[Shubnikov–de Haas effect|Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations]], or the common positive magnetoresistance in metals.&lt;ref&gt;A. B. Pippard: ''Magnetoresistance in Metals'', Cambridge University Press (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Other effects occur in magnetic metals, such as negative magnetoresistance in ferromagnets&lt;ref name=Coleman&gt;{{Citation |first1=R.V. |last1=Coleman |first2=A. |last2=Isin |title=Magnetoresistance in Iron Single Crystals|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=37 |issue=3 |date=1966 |pages=1028–1029 |doi=10.1063/1.1708320|bibcode = 1966JAP....37.1028C }}&lt;/ref&gt; or anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR). Finally, in multicomponent or multilayer systems (e.g. magnetic tunnel junctions), [[giant magnetoresistance]] (GMR), [[tunnel magnetoresistance]] (TMR), [[colossal magnetoresistance]] (CMR), and [[extraordinary magnetoresistance]] (EMR) can be observed.

The first magnetoresistive effect was discovered in 1856 by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], better known as Lord Kelvin, but he was unable to lower the electrical resistance of anything by more than 5%. Today, systems including [[semimetal]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Unstoppable Magnetoresistance|url=http://phys.org/news/2014-10-unstoppable-magnetoresistance.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and concentric ring [[Extraordinary magnetoresistance|EMR]] structures are known. In these, a magnetic field can adjust the resistance by orders of magnitude. Since different mechanisms can alter the resistance, it is useful to separately consider situations where it depends on a magnetic field directly (e.g. geometric magnetoresistance and multiband magnetoresistance) and those where it does so indirectly through magnetization (e.g. AMR and [[Tunnel magnetoresistance|TMR]]).

==Discovery==
[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]] first discovered ordinary magnetoresistance in 1856.&lt;ref name=Kelvin&gt;{{Citation |first=W. |last=Thomson |title=On the Electro-Dynamic Qualities of Metals:—Effects of Magnetization on the Electric Conductivity of Nickel and of Iron |journal=Proc. Royal Soc. Lond. |volume=8 |date=18 June 1857 |pages=546–550 |doi=10.1098/rspl.1856.0144|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; He experimented with pieces of iron and discovered that the resistance increases when the current is in the same direction as the magnetic force and decreases when the current is at 90° to the magnetic force. He then did the same experiment with nickel and found that it was affected in the same way but the magnitude of the effect was greater. This effect is referred to as anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR).

[[Image:Corbino disc.PNG|thumbnail|250px|Corbino disc. With the magnetic field turned off, a radial current flows in the conducting annulus due to the battery connected between the (infinite) conductivity rims. When a magnetic field along the axis is turned on,(B points directly out of the page) the [[Lorentz force]] drives a circular component of current, and the resistance between the inner and outer rims goes up. This increase in resistance due to the magnetic field is called ''magnetoresistance''.]]

In 2007, [[Albert Fert]] and [[Peter Grünberg]] were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for the discovery of [[Giant Magnetoresistance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2007 |publisher=Nobel Media AB |date=9 Oct 2007 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2007/ |accessdate=25 Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geometrical magnetoresistance==
An example of magnetoresistance due to direct action of magnetic field on electric current can be studied on a Corbino disc (see Figure).
It consists of a conducting annulus with perfectly conducting rims. Without a magnetic field, the battery drives a radial current between the rims. When a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the annulus is applied, (either into or out of the page) a circular component of current flows as well, due to [[Lorentz force]]. Initial interest in this problem began with Boltzmann in 1886, and independently was re-examined by Corbino in 1911.&lt;ref name=Giuliani&gt;{{cite journal |author=G Giuliani |title=A general law for electromagnetic induction |year=2008 |journal= EPL |volume=81 |doi=10.1209/0295-5075/81/60002 |pages=60002|bibcode = 2008EL.....8160002G |issue=6 |arxiv = 1502.00502 |s2cid=14917438 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a simple model, supposing the response to the Lorentz force is the same as for an electric field, the carrier velocity '''v''' is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = \mu \left( \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v \times B} \right), \ &lt;/math&gt;

where μ is the carrier mobility.  Solving for the velocity, we find:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \frac{ \mu}{1+(\mu B)^2} \left( \mathbf{E} + \mu \mathbf{E \times B} + \mu^2 (\mathbf{B \cdot E}) \mathbf{B}  \right) = 
   \frac{ \mu}{1+(\mu B)^2} \left( \mathbf{E}_{\perp} + \mu \mathbf{E \times B}\right) + \mu\mathbf{E}_{\parallel} , \ &lt;/math&gt;

where the effective reduction in mobility due to the '''B'''-field (for motion perpendicular to this field) is apparent. Electric current (proportional to the radial component of velocity) will decrease with increasing magnetic field and hence the resistance of the device will increase. Critically, this magnetoresistive scenario depends sensitively on the device geometry and current lines and it does not rely on magnetic materials.

In a [[semiconductor]] with a single carrier type, the magnetoresistance is proportional to (1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(''μB'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), where μ is the [[electron mobility|semiconductor mobility]] (units m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·V&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; or T&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and ''B'' is the magnetic field (units [[tesla (unit)|tesla]]s). [[Indium antimonide]], an example of a high mobility semiconductor, could have an electron mobility above 4&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·V&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 300&amp;nbsp;K. So in a 0.25&amp;nbsp;T field, for example the magnetoresistance increase would be 100%.

==Anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR)==
[[File:AMR of Permalloy.png|thumbnail|250px|The resistance of a thin [[Permalloy]] film is shown here as a function of the angle of an applied external field.]]Thomson's experiments&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelvin&quot;/&gt; are an example of AMR,&lt;ref name=McGuirePotter&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McGuire | first1 = T. | last2 = Potter | first2 = R. | doi = 10.1109/TMAG.1975.1058782 | title = Anisotropic magnetoresistance in ferromagnetic 3d alloys| url = http://www.unife.it/scienze/lm.fisica/insegnamenti/proprieta-magnetiche-materia/materiale/magnetoresistenza_anisotropa.pdf| journal = IEEE Transactions on Magnetics | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 1018–1038| year = 1975 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1975ITM....11.1018M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  a property of a material in which a dependence of electrical resistance on the angle between the direction of electric current and direction of '''magnetization''' is observed. The effect arises from the simultaneous action of magnetization and [[Spin–orbit interaction|spin-orbit interaction]] and its detailed mechanism depends on the material. It can be for example due to a larger probability of s-d scattering of electrons in the direction of magnetization (which is controlled by the applied magnetic field). The net effect (in most materials) is that the electrical resistance has maximum value when the direction of current is parallel to the applied magnetic field. AMR of new materials is being investigated and magnitudes up to 50% have been observed in some ferromagnetic uranium compounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiśniewski&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wiśniewski | first1 = P. | year = 2007| title = Giant anisotropic magnetoresistance and magnetothermopower in cubic 3:4 uranium pnictides | url = | journal = Applied Physics Letters| volume = 90| issue = 19| pages = 192106| doi = 10.1063/1.2737904 |bibcode = 2007ApPhL..90s2106W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In polycrystalline ferromagnetic materials, the AMR can only depend on the angle &lt;math&gt;\varphi=\psi-\theta&lt;/math&gt; between the magnetization and current direction
and (as long as the resistivity of the material can be described by a rank-two tensor), it must follow&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first1=E. |last1=De Ranieri |first2=A. W. |last2=Rushforth |first3=K. |last3=Výborný |first4=U. |last4=Rana |first5=E. |last5=Ahmed |first6=R. P. |last6=Campion |first7=C. T. |last7=Foxon |first8=B. L. |last8=Gallagher |first9=A.

&lt;math&gt;\rho(\varphi) = \rho_\perp + (\rho_\parallel - \rho_\perp) \cos^2 \varphi &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the (longitudinal) [[resistivity]] of the film and  &lt;math&gt;\rho_{\parallel,\perp}&lt;/math&gt; are the resistivities for &lt;math&gt;\varphi=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;90^\circ&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Associated with longitudinal resistivity, there is also transversal resistivity dubbed (somewhat confusingly[[#Footnotes|[1]]]) the planar Hall effect. In monocrystals, resistivity &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; depends also on &lt;math&gt;\psi, \theta&lt;/math&gt; individually.

To compensate for the non-linear characteristics and inability to detect the polarity of a magnetic field, the following structure is used for sensors. It consists of stripes of aluminum or gold placed on a thin film of [[permalloy]] (a ferromagnetic material exhibiting the AMR effect) inclined at an angle of 45°. This structure forces the current not to flow along the “easy axes” of thin film, but at an angle of 45°. The dependence of resistance now has a permanent offset which is linear around the null point. Because of its appearance, this sensor type is called '[[barber pole]]'.

The AMR effect is used in a wide array of sensors for measurement of Earth's magnetic field (electronic [[compass]]), for electric current measuring (by measuring the magnetic field created around the conductor), for traffic detection and for linear position and angle sensing. The biggest AMR sensor manufacturers are [[Honeywell]], [[NXP Semiconductors]], [[STMicroelectronics]], and [http://www.sensitec.com Sensitec GmbH].

As theoretical aspects, I. A. Campbell, A. Fert, and O. Jaoul (CFJ) &lt;ref name=CFJ&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = I.

The AMR ratio is expressed as

&lt;math&gt; \frac{\Delta \rho}{\rho}= \frac{\rho_\parallel - \rho_\perp}{\rho_\perp}=\gamma (\alpha - 1), &lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt; \gamma=(3/4)(A/H)^2 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \alpha=\rho_\downarrow/\rho_\uparrow &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; H &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \rho_\sigma &lt;/math&gt; are a spin-orbit coupling constant (so-called &lt;math&gt; \zeta &lt;/math&gt;), an exchange field, and a resistivity for spin &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt;, respectively. In addition, recently, Satoshi Kokado et al.&lt;ref name=Kokado1&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kokado | first1 = Satoshi | last2 = Tsunoda | first2 = Masakiyo | last3 = Harigaya | first3 = Kikuo | first4 = Akimasa | last4 = Sakuma | doi = 10.1143/JPSJ.81.024705 | title = Anisotropic Magnetoresistance Effects in Fe, Co, Ni, Fe4N, and Half-Metallic Ferromagnet: A Systematic Analysis | journal = J.

'''Burgos''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|b|ʊər|g|ɒ|s}} {{respell|BOOR|goss}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|b|ʊər|g|oʊ|s}} {{respell|BOOR|gohss}}, {{IPA-es|ˈbuɾɣos|lang}}) is a city of [[Spain]] located in the autonomous community of [[Castile and León]]. It is the capital and most populated municipality of the [[province of Burgos]].

It is situated in the north of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], on the confluence of the [[Arlanzón (river)|Arlanzón river]] tributaries, at the edge of the central plateau. The municipality has a population of about 180,000 inhabitants. It forms part of the [[Camino de Santiago]].

Founded in 884 by [[Diego Rodríguez Porcelos]], Burgos soon became the leading city of the embryonic [[County of Castile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SMNoCP5Aq_IC&amp;pg=PA150|title=Las técnicas y las construcciones en la ingeniería romana|isbn=978-84-614-3758-0|year=2010|publisher=Fundación de la Ingeniería Técnica de Obras Públicas|page=150|chapter=Introducción al conocimiento de la viaria romana de la cuenca del Duero a través de la documentación altomedieval|ref=harv|first1=García González|last1=Juan José|first2=David|last2=Peterson|first3=Iván|last3=García Izquierdo|first4=Lucía|last4=García Aragón}}&lt;/ref&gt; 11th century chieftain [[El Cid|Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar]] (''El Cid'') is connected to the city, as he was born near Burgos and was raised and educated there.

== Toponymy ==

There are several possible origins for the toponymy. When the city was founded, the inhabitants of the surrounding country moved into the fortified village, whose [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] name of Burgos signified consolidated [[defensive wall|walled]] villages{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} (Gothic ''baurgs'').&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Joseph, 1892, ''A Primer of the Gothic Language'', glossary &amp; section 182.&lt;/ref&gt; The city began to be called ''Caput Castellae'' (&quot;Cabeza de Castilla&quot; or &quot;Head of Castile&quot;).&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;

== History ==

{{see also|Timeline of Burgos}}
[[Homo antecessor|Early humans]] occupied sites around Burgos as early as 800,000 years ago.
When the Romans took possession of what is now the province of Burgos, the site had been a [[Celts|Celtic]] city. In Roman times, it belonged to [[Hispania Citerior]] (&quot;Hither Spain&quot;) and then to [[Hispania Tarraconensis]]. In the 5th century, the [[Visigoths]] drove back the [[Suebi]], then the Berbers occupied almost all of [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] in the 8th century, though only for a very brief period, and left little if any trace of their occupation. King [[Alfonso III of Leon|Alfonso III the Great]] of [[Kingdom of León|León]] reconquered it about the middle of the 9th century, and built several castles for the defence of Christendom, which was then extended through the reconquest of lost territory. The region came to be known as Castile (Latin ''castella''), i.e. &quot;(land of) castles&quot;.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;

Burgos was founded in 884 as an outpost of this [[Reconquista|expanding Christian frontier]],&lt;ref&gt;Teofilo F. Ruiz, &quot;The Transformation of the Castilian Municipalities: The Case of Burgos 1248–1350&quot; ''Past and Present'' '''77''' (November 1977, pp. 3–32), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; when Diego Rodríguez &quot;Porcelos&quot;, count of [[County of Castile|Castile]], governed this territory with orders to promote the increase of the Christian population; with this end in view he gathered the inhabitants of the surrounding country into one fortified village. The city began to be called ''Caput Castellae'' (&quot;Cabeza de Castilla&quot; or &quot;Head of Castile&quot;). The [[County of Castile|county (''condado'') of Castile]], subject to the [[List of Leonese monarchs|Kings of León]], continued to be governed by counts and was gradually extended;&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt; one of these counts, Fernán González, established his independence.&lt;ref&gt;It later became the [[Kingdom of Castile]], being sometimes united with Navarre and sometimes with Leon. In the reign of [[St. Ferdinand III]] (c. 1200–1252), Leon and Castile were united, but they continued to be called respectively the Kingdom of Leon and the Kingdom of Castile until the 19th century.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 11th century, the city became the see of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Burgos]] and the capital of the [[Kingdom of Castile]]. Burgos was a major stop for pilgrims on the [[French Way]] the most popular path to [[Santiago de Compostela]]&lt;ref&gt;The [[Way of St James|Camino de Santiago]] passed directly through the city, where an urban section of it was called the &quot;French Road&quot; (Ruiz 1977:13).&lt;/ref&gt; and a centre of trade between the [[Bay of Biscay]] and the south, which attracted an unusually large foreign merchant population, who became part of the city oligarchy and excluded other foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;Ruiz 1977:10.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 13th and 14th centuries, Burgos was a favourite seat of the [[Crown of Castile|kings of León and Castile]] and a favoured burial site. The ''[[consejo]]'' or [[Medieval commune|urban commune]] of Burgos was firmly in the hands of an oligarchic class of ''caballeros villanos'', the &quot;peasant knights&quot; of Burgos, who provided the monarchs with a mounted contingent: in 1255 and 1266 royal charters granted relief from taxes to those citizens of Burgos who owned horses and could arm themselves, provided that they continue to live within the city walls.&lt;ref&gt;Ruiz 1977:6–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The merchant oligarchy succeeded the cathedral chapter as the major purchasers of land after 1250; they carried on their mercantile business in common with municipal or royal functions and sent their sons to England and Flanders to gain experience in overseas trade. A few families within the ''[[hermandad]]es'' or confraternities like the Sarracín and Bonifaz succeeded in monopolising the post of ''[[alcalde]]'', or mayor; a special court, the ''alcalde del rey'' was first mentioned at Burgos in 1281.&lt;ref&gt;Ruis 1977:23.&lt;/ref&gt; By the reign of [[Alfonso X]], the exemption of the non-noble knights and religious corporations, combined with exorbitant gifts and grants to monasteries and private individuals, placed great stress on the economic well-being of the realm.

In the century following the conquest of [[Seville]] (1248) on the Moors, Burgos became a testing ground for royal policies of increasing power against the ''consejo'', in part by encouraging the right to appeal from the ''consejo'' to the king. In 1285, [[Sancho IV of Castile|Sancho IV]] added a new body to the ''consejo'' which came to dominate it: the ''jurado'' in charge of collecting taxes and overseeing public works; the king reserved the right to select its members. The city perceived that danger to its autonomy came rather from an uncontrolled aristocracy during royal minorities: Burgos joined the ''hermandades'' of cities that leagued together for mutual protection in 1295 and 1315. In the 14th century, official royal intrusion in city affairs was perceived as a palliative against outbreaks of violence by the large excluded class of smaller merchants and artisans, on whom the tax burden fell. The ''[[alguacil]]'' was the royal official instituted to judge disagreements.

On 9 June 1345, sweeping aside the city government, [[Alfonso XI]] established direct royal rule of Burgos through the ''Regimiento'' of sixteen appointed men.

In 1574, [[Pope Gregory XIII]] made the bishopric a Metropolitan [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Burgos|archbishopric]], at the request of king [[Philip II of Spain|Felipe II]].

Burgos has been the scene of many wars: with the [[Moors]], the struggles between León and Navarre, and between Castile and [[Aragon]]. In the [[Peninsular War]] against Napoleonic France, the [[siege of Burgos]] (between 19 September to 21 October) was a scene of a withdrawal for [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]]. Again in the 19th-century [[Carlist]] civil [[wars of the Spanish succession]] Burgos was the scene of a battle. During the [[Spanish Civil War]], Burgos was the base of General [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s rebel Nationalist government.

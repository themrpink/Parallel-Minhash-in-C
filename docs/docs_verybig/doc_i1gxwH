[[Jiang Zemin]], the Party Secretary of Shanghai, was promoted to [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Communist Party]]. Jiang's decisive actions in Shanghai involving the ''World Economic Herald'' and his having prevented deadly violence in the city won him support from party elders in Beijing. Having put the new leadership team in place and recognising his weakened position, Deng Xiaoping himself also bowed out of the party leadership—at least officially—by resigning his last leadership position as Chairman of the [[Central Military Commission]] later that year. He kept a low profile until 1992. According to diplomatic cables de-classified by Canada, the Swiss ambassador informed Canadian diplomats in confidence that over several months following the massacre, &quot;every member of the Politburo Standing Committee has approached him about transferring very significant amounts of money to Swiss bank accounts.&quot;{{sfn|Phillips|2015}}

[[Bao Tong]], Zhao Ziyang's aide, was the highest-ranking official to be formally charged with a crime in connection with 1989 demonstrations. He was convicted in 1992 of &quot;revealing state secrets and counter-revolutionary propagandizing&quot; and served seven years in prison. To purge sympathizers of Tiananmen demonstrators from among the party's rank-and-file, the party leadership initiated a one-and-a-half-year-long rectification program to &quot;deal strictly with those inside the party with serious tendencies toward bourgeois liberalization&quot;. Four million people were reportedly investigated for their role in the protests. More than 30,000 Communist officers were deployed to assess the &quot;political reliability&quot; of more than one million government officials.{{sfn|Miles | 1997 | pp=27–30}} The authorities arrested tens if not hundreds of thousands of people across the country. Some were seized in broad daylight while they walked in the street; others were arrested at night. Many were jailed or sent to labor camps. They were often denied access to see their families and often put in cells so crowded that not everyone had space to sleep. Dissidents shared cells with murderers and rapists, and torture was not uncommon.{{sfn|Miles | 1997 | p=30}}

In the meantime, the Chinese government also constantly controlled public narratives about the protests on Tiananmen Square in 1989. When referring to the protests, the print media were required to be consistent with the Chinese government's account of the &quot;June 4th Incident&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; In addition, the Chinese government prepared a [[white paper]] to explain the government's views on the protests. Later, anonymous people within the Chinese government shipped the files overseas and published the &quot;[[The Tiananmen Papers|Tiananmen Papers]]&quot; in 2001. At the 30th anniversary of the June 4 Incident, [[Wei Fenghe]], a general of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, said in the [[Shangri-La Dialogue]]: &quot;The June 4 Incident was a turmoil and unrest. The Central Government took decisive measures to calm the unrest and stop the turmoil, and it is because of this decision that the stability within the country can be established. For the past three decades, China has undergone tremendous changes under the leadership of the Communist Party.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hk01.com/議事廳/335905/六四三十-國防部長魏鳳和-中央果斷平息動亂-屬正確決定|script-title=zh:【六四三十】國防部長魏鳳和：中央果斷平息動亂 屬正確決定|last=朱加樟|date=2019-06-02|website=香港01|language=zh-HK|access-date=2020-04-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200510210717/https://www.hk01.com/%E8%AD%B0%E4%BA%8B%E5%BB%B3/335905/%E5%85%AD%E5%9B%9B%E4%B8%89%E5%8D%81-%E5%9C%8B%E9%98%B2%E9%83%A8%E9%95%B7%E9%AD%8F%E9%B3%B3%E5%92%8C-%E4%B8%AD%E5%A4%AE%E6%9E%9C%E6%96%B7%E5%B9%B3%E6%81%AF%E5%8B%95%E4%BA%82-%E5%B1%AC%E6%AD%A3%E7%A2%BA%E6%B1%BA%E5%AE%9A|archive-date=May 10, 2020|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chinese media====
{{see also|People's Daily during the 1989 Student Movement}}

The suppression of June 4 marked the end of a period of relative press freedom in China, and media workers—both foreign and domestic—faced heightened restrictions and punishment in the aftermath of the crackdown. State media reports in the immediate aftermath were sympathetic to the students. As a result, those responsible were all later removed from their posts. Two news anchors [[Xue Fei (host)|Xue Fei]] and [[Du Xian (news anchor)|Du Xian]], who reported this event on June 4 in the daily ''[[Xinwen Lianbo]]'' broadcast on [[China Central Television]], were fired because they openly emoted in sympathy with the protesters. Wu Xiaoyong, the son of former foreign minister [[Wu Xueqian]], was removed from the English Program Department of [[Chinese Radio International]], ostensibly for his sympathies towards protesters. Editors and other staff at the ''[[People's Daily]]'', including director [[Qian Liren]] and Editor-in-Chief Tan Wenrui, were also sacked because of reports in the paper which were sympathetic towards the protesters.{{sfn|Wudunn | 1989}} Several editors were arrested.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

====Foreign media====
{{main|Foreign Media and the Tiananmen Square Protests}}

With the imposition of martial law, the Chinese government cut off the satellite transmissions of western broadcasters such as CNN and CBS. Broadcasters tried to defy these orders by reporting via telephone. Video footage was smuggled out of the country, although the only network that was able to record video during the night of June 4 was [[Televisión Española]] of Spain (TVE).{{sfn|Bregolat|2007}} During the military action, some foreign journalists faced harassment from authorities. [[CBS]] correspondent [[Richard Roth (journalist)|Richard Roth]] and his cameraman were taken into custody while filing a report from the Square via mobile phone.{{sfn|Roth|2009a}}

Several foreign journalists who had covered the crackdown were expelled in the weeks that followed while others were harassed by authorities or blacklisted from reentering the country.{{sfn|Fathers|1989}}{{sfn|Kristof: Beijing Ousts Correspondents}} In Shanghai, foreign consulates were told that the [[safety of journalists]] who failed to heed newly enacted reporting guidelines could not be guaranteed.{{sfn|Bociurkiw | 1989}}

===International reaction===

The Chinese government's response was widely denounced, particularly by Western governments and media.{{sfn|Tiananmen Square Document 35|1989}} Criticism came from both Western and Eastern Europe, North America, Australia, and some west Asian and Latin American countries. Many Asian countries remained silent throughout the protests; the government of India responded to the massacre by ordering the state television to offer only the absolute minimum coverage of the incident, so as not to jeopardize a thawing in relations with China, and to empathize with the Chinese government.{{sfn|Mohan | 2009}} Cuba, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany, among others, supported the Chinese government and denounced the protests.{{sfn|Tiananmen Square Document 35|1989}} Overseas Chinese students demonstrated in many cities in Europe, America, the Middle East, and Asia.{{sfn|Troubles Provoke}}

==Longer-term impact==

===Political impact===
{{see|Political purges during and after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests}}

The protests led to a strengthened role for the party in domestic affairs. In its aftermath, many of the freedoms introduced during the 1980s were rescinded, as the party returned to a conventional Leninist mold and re-established firm control over the press, publishing, and mass media. The protests were also a blow to the separation-of-powers model established following the Cultural Revolution, whereby the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] was a [[figurehead|symbolic position]], while the real centres of power—i.e., the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Communist Party]], the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]], and the [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]]—were [[Separation of powers|intended for different people]], to prevent the excesses of Mao-style personal rule.

When President [[Yang Shangkun]] asserted his [[reserve powers]] from his membership in the [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] and openly split with general secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] over the use of force, to side with Premier [[Li Peng]] and Central Military Commission chairman [[Deng Xiaoping]], official policy became inconsistent and incoherent, significantly impeding the exercise of power. By 1993, the positions of General Secretary, Central Military Commission chairman, and President were consolidated into the same person, a practice that has been continued since.

In 1989, neither the Chinese military nor the Beijing police had sufficient anti-riot gear, such as rubber bullets and tear gas.{{sfn|MacKinnon | 1999}} After the Tiananmen Square protests, riot police in Chinese cities were equipped with non-lethal equipment for riot control. The protests led to increased spending on internal security and to an expanded role for the People's Armed Police in suppressing urban protests.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The restrictions were only loosened after a few years had passed, especially after Deng's &quot;[[Deng Xiaoping's Southern Tour|1992 southern tour]].&quot;{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=195}} Privately-run print media then again flourished. Private newspapers increased from 250 in the 1980s to over 7,000 by 2003. Provincially-run satellite TV stations sprang up all over the country and challenged the market share of state-run CCTV.{{sfn|Kurlantzick | 2003 | p=50}} The leadership also stepped away from promoting communism as an all-encompassing belief system. State-approved religious organizations increased their membership significantly, and traditional beliefs suppressed during the Mao era re-appeared.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=50}} This state-sanctioned plurality also created an environment for unsanctioned forms of spirituality and worship to grow.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=52}} To reduce the need for controversial methods of state control, Protestants, Buddhists, and Taoists were often used by the state as &quot;approved&quot; denominations to &quot;fight against cults&quot; such as [[Falun Gong]], playing the sects against each other.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=52}}

As the party departed from the orthodox communism it was founded upon, much of its attention was focused on the cultivation of nationalism as an alternative ideology.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=199}} This policy largely succeeded in tying the party's legitimacy to China's &quot;national pride&quot;, turning domestic public opinion back in its favour.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=201}} This is perhaps most prominently seen in May 1999, when the United States [[United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade|bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade]].{{sfn|Link| 2010|p= 30}} The bombings saw an outpouring of nationalist sentiment and increased support for the party as the foremost advocate of China's national interest.{{sfn|Link| 2010|p= 30}}

===Economic impact===
{{see also|Deng Xiaoping's southern tour}}

After the Tiananmen Square protests, many business analysts downgraded their outlook for China's economic future.{{sfn|Naughton|2007}} The violent response to the protests was one of the factors that led to a delay in China's acceptance in the [[World Trade Organization]], which was not completed until twelve years later, in 2001.{{sfn|Naughton|2007}} Furthermore, bilateral aid to China decreased from $3.4&amp;nbsp;billion in 1988 to $700&amp;nbsp;million in 1990.{{sfn|Foot|2000}} Loans to China were suspended by the [[World Bank]], [[Asian Development Bank]], and foreign governments;{{sfn|Thakur | Burton | Srivastava | 1997 | pp=404–05}} China's credit rating was lowered;{{sfn|Foot|2000}} tourism revenue decreased from US$2.2&amp;nbsp;billion to US$1.8&amp;nbsp;billion; and foreign direct investment commitments were cancelled. However, there was a rise in government defense spending from 8.6% in 1986, to 15.5% in 1990, reversing a previous 10-year decline.{{sfn|Kelley | Shenkar | 1993 | pp=120–22}}

In the aftermath of the protests, the government sought again to centralize control over the economy,{{sfn|Naughton|2010}} though the changes were short-lived. Sensing that conservative policies had again taken a foothold within the party, Deng, now retired from all of his official positions, launched his &quot;[[Deng Xiaoping's Southern Tour|southern tour]]&quot; in 1992, visiting various cities in the country's most prosperous regions while advocating for further economic reforms.{{sfn|Wu | 2015}} Partly in response to Deng, by the mid-1990s, the country was again pursuing market liberalization on a scale even greater than those seen in the initial stages of the reforms in the 1980s. Although political liberals were purged from within the party, many of those who were economically liberal remained.{{sfn|Naughton|2010}} The economic shocks caused by the events of 1989, in retrospect, had only a minor and temporary effect on China's economic growth. Indeed, with many previously aggrieved groups now regarding political liberalization as a lost cause, more of their energy was spent on economic activities. The economy would quickly regain momentum into the 1990s.{{sfn|Naughton|2010}}

===Hong Kong===
[[File:2009candlevigil1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.23|[[Candlelight vigil]] in Hong Kong in 2009 on the 20th anniversary of the June 4th incident]]

In Hong Kong, the Tiananmen square protests led to fears that China would renege on its commitments under [[one country, two systems]], following the impending handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom in 1997. In response, Governor [[Chris Patten]] tried to expand the [[1994 Hong Kong electoral reform|franchise for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong]], which led to friction with Beijing. For many Hong Kongers, Tiananmen served as the turning point when they lost trust in the Beijing government. The event, coupled with general uncertainty about the status of Hong Kong after the transfer of sovereignty, led to [[Waves of mass migrations from Hong Kong|a sizeable exodus of Hong Kongers]] to Western countries such as Canada and Australia prior to 1997.

There have been [[Memorials for the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|large candlelight vigils attended by tens of thousands in Hong Kong every year since 1989]], even after the transfer of power to China in 1997. In spite of that, the [[June 4th Museum]] closed in July 2016, after only two years in its location. The group that runs the museum, the [[Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China|Hong Kong Alliance]], has started to crowdfund money to open the museum in a new location.{{sfn|Kam|2016}}

The events of Tiananmen in 1989 have become permanently etched in the public consciousness, perhaps more than anywhere else outside mainland China. The events continue to strongly impact perceptions of China, its government, attitudes towards democracy, and the extent to which Hong Kongers should identify as &quot;Chinese&quot;. The events of June 4 are seen as representative of the Chinese brand of authoritarianism, and they are often invoked by pro-democracy politicians in Hong Kong, especially in relation to democratic reform in Hong Kong and the territory's relationship with Beijing. Academic studies indicate that those who supported the rehabilitation of the Tiananmen Square movement had a tendency to support democratization in the territory as well as the election of pro-democracy parties.{{Sfn|Lee|2012|pp=152, 155}}

===Impact on China's image internationally===
The Chinese government drew widespread condemnation for its suppression of the protests. In the immediate aftermath, China seemed to be becoming a [[pariah state]], increasingly isolated internationally. This was a significant setback for the leadership, who had courted international investment for much of the 1980s, as the country emerged from the chaos of the Cultural Revolution. However, Deng Xiaoping and the core leadership vowed to continue economic liberalization policies after 1989.{{sfn|L. Zhang|2001|p=424}} From there on, China would work domestically as well as internationally to reshape its national image from that of a repressive regime to that of a benign global economic and military partner.{{sfn|Cabestan | 2010 |p= 194}}

[[File:Mong Kok 20200604-SDIM2297 (49970228988).jpg|thumb|Protest in Hong Kong, 2020]]

In the 1990s, China attempted to demonstrate its willingness to participate in international economic and defense institutions to secure investment for continued economic reforms.{{sfn|Link| 2010|p= 19}} The government signed the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|Non-Proliferation Treaty]] in 1992, the [[Chemical Weapons Convention|Convention on Chemical Weapons]] in 1993, and the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]] in 1996.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=199}} Whereas China had been a member of only 30 international organizations in 1986, it was a member of over 50 by 1997.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=198}} China also sought to diversify its external partnerships, establishing good diplomatic relations with post-Soviet Russia,{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=196}} and welcoming Taiwanese business in lieu of Western investment.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=196}} China expedited negotiations with the [[World Trade Organization]] and established relations with Indonesia, Israel, South Korea, and others in 1992.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=199}} While China was a net recipient of aid throughout the 1980s, its growing economic and military role transformed it into a net provider of aid.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=56}}

Furthermore, the government has successfully promoted China as an attractive destination for investment by emphasizing the country's skilled workers, comparatively low wages, established infrastructure, and sizeable consumer base.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=55}} Increased foreign investment in the country led many world leaders to believe that by constructively engaging China in the global marketplace, larger political reforms would inevitably follow.{{sfn|Link| 2010|p= 30}} At the same time, the explosion of commercial interest in the country opened the way for multinational corporations to turn a blind eye to politics and human rights in favour of focusing on business interests. Since then, Western leaders who were previously critical of China have sometimes paid lip service to the legacy of Tiananmen in bilateral meetings, but the substance of discussions revolved around business and trade interests.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=56}}

===European Union and United States arms embargo===
{{main|European Union arms embargo on the People's Republic of China}}

The European Union and United States embargo on armament sales to China, put in place as a result of the violent suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests, remains in place today. China has been calling for a lift of the ban for years and has had a varying amount of support from European Union members. Since 2004, China has portrayed the ban as &quot;outdated&quot; and damaging to China–European Union relations. In early 2004, French President [[Jacques Chirac]] spearheaded a movement within the European Union to lift the ban, Chirac effort being supported by German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]]. However, the passing of the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]], in March 2005, increased tensions between mainland China and Taiwan, damaging attempts to lift the ban; and several European Union Council members retracted their support for a lift of the ban. Moreover, Schröder's successor [[Angela Merkel]] opposed lifting the ban. Members of the United States Congress had also proposed restrictions on the transfer of military technology to the European Union if the latter lifted the ban. The United Kingdom also opposed the lifting of the embargo when it took charge of the European Union presidency in July 2005.

In addition, the [[European Parliament]] has consistently opposed the lifting of the arms embargo to China. Though its agreement is not necessary for lifting the ban, many argue it reflects the will of the European people better as it is the only directly elected European body. The arms embargo has limited China's options in seeking military hardware. Among the sources that were sought included the former [[Soviet bloc]] that it had a strained relationship with as a result of the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. Other willing suppliers have previously included Israel and South Africa, but American pressure has restricted this co-operation.{{sfn|Japan Concerned}}

Textbooks have little, if any, information about the protests.{{sfn|Olesen|2009}} After the protests, officials banned controversial films and books, and shut down many newspapers. Within a year, 12% of all newspapers, 8% of publishing companies, 13% of social science periodicals, and more than 150 films were banned or shut down. The government also announced it had seized 32&amp;nbsp;million of contraband books and 2.4&amp;nbsp;million of video and audio cassettes.{{sfn|Pei | 1994 | p=152}} Access to media and Internet resources on the subject are restricted or blocked by censors.{{sfn|Zetter|2009}} Banned literature and films include ''[[Summer Palace (2006 film)|Summer Palace]]'',{{sfn|Higgins | 2006}} ''[[Forbidden City (novel)|Forbidden City]]'', ''[[Collection of June Fourth Poems]]'',{{sfn|Ban on Poems}} ''[[The Critical Moment]]: Li Peng diaries'' and any writings of Zhao Ziyang or his aide [[Bao Tong]], including [[Prisoner of the State: The Secret Journal of Premier Zhao Ziyang|Zhao's memoirs]]. However, contraband and Internet copies of these publications can be found.{{sfn|Trying Times}}

Print media containing reference to the protests must be consistent with the government's version of events.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt; Not only domestic but also foreign journalists are detained, harassed, or threatened, as are their Chinese colleagues and any Chinese citizens they interview.{{sfn|Greenslade|2014}} Thus, Chinese citizens are typically reluctant to speak about the protests because of potential repercussions. Many young people born after 1980 are unfamiliar with the events and are apathetic about politics. Youth in China are sometimes unaware of the events, of the symbols such as [[tank man]],{{sfn|Fisher|2014}}{{sfn|Apathy}} or of the significance of the date June 4 itself.{{sfn|Young clerk let|2007}} Some older intellectuals no longer aspire to political change and instead focus on economic issues.{{sfn|Gifford|2007|pp=167–68}} A number of political prisoners have refused to talk to their children about their involvement, out of fear of putting them at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lee |first1=Lily |last2=Westcott |first2=Ben |title=They faced down the tanks in Tiananmen Square.

While public discussion of the events has become a social taboo, private discussions continue to take place despite frequent interference and harassment from the authorities. Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Liu Xiaobo]] remained in China to speak out about Tiananmen in the 1990s despite offers of asylum; he faced constant surveillance. [[Zhang Xianling]] and [[Ding Zilin]], mothers of victims who lost their lives in 1989, founded the [[Tiananmen Mothers]] organization and were particularly outspoken on the humanitarian aspects.{{sfn|References Censored|2009}} The authorities mobilize security forces, including members of the [[People's Armed Police]], every year on June 4 to prevent public displays of remembrance, with especially heavy security for major anniversaries such as the [[20th anniversary of Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|20th anniversary in 2009]] and the 25th anniversary in 2014.{{sfn|Bristow|2009}} On the 30th anniversary in 2019, renowned Chinese artist [[Ai Weiwei]] wrote that &quot;autocratic and totalitarian regimes fear facts because they have built their power on unjust foundations&quot; and said that memory is important: &quot;without it there is no such thing as a civilised society or nation&quot; because &quot;our past is all we have.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/04/china-tiananmen-square-beijing?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other|title=The west is complicit in the 30-year cover-up of Tiananmen|last1=Ai|first1=Weiwei|date=June 4, 2019|work=The Guardian – Australia edition|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616061550/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/04/china-tiananmen-square-beijing?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other|archive-date=June 16, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/why-searching-for-the-truth-about-tiananmen-is-more-important-than-ever-20190530-p51suy.html|title=Why searching for the truth about Tiananmen is more important than ever|last1=Needham|first1=Kirsty|date=May 31, 2019|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190929221548/https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/why-searching-for-the-truth-about-tiananmen-is-more-important-than-ever-20190530-p51suy.html|archive-date=September 29, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calls for the government to reassess===
The party's official stance towards the incident is that the use of force was necessary to control a &quot;political disturbance&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt; and that it ensured the stability necessary for economic prosperity.{{sfn|Relatives of Dead}} Chinese leaders, including former [[paramount leader]]s [[Jiang Zemin]] and [[Hu Jintao]], reiterate this line when questioned by foreign press.{{sfn|Provocateur}}

Over the years, some Chinese citizens have called for a reassessment of the protests and compensation from the government to victims' families. One group in particular, [[Tiananmen Mothers]], seeks compensation, vindication for victims, and the right to receive donations from within the mainland and from abroad.{{sfn|Relatives of Dead}} Zhang Shijun, a former soldier who was involved in the military crackdown, published an open letter to President Hu Jintao that sought to have the government reevaluate its position on the protests. He was subsequently arrested and taken from his home.{{sfn|Branigan|2009}}

Although the Chinese government never officially acknowledged relevant accusations when it came to the incident, in April 2006 a payment was made to the mother of one of the victims, the first publicized case of the government offering redress to a Tiananmen-related victim's family. The payment was termed a &quot;hardship assistance&quot; and was given to Tang Deying ({{lang|zh|唐德英}}), whose son Zhou Guocong ({{zh|s=周国聪|t=周國聰}}) died at age 15 while in police custody in [[Chengdu]] on June 6, 1989, two days after the Chinese Army dispersed the Tiananmen protesters. She was reportedly paid CNY70,000 (approximately US$10,250). This has been welcomed by various Chinese activists, but it was regarded by some as a measure to maintain social stability and not believed to herald a changing of the party's official position.{{sfn|China makes 1989|2006}}

===Chinese leaders voicing regret===
Before his death in 1998, Yang Shangkun told army doctor [[Jiang Yanyong]] that June 4 was the most serious mistake committed by the Communist Party in its history, a mistake that Yang himself could not correct, but one that certainly will eventually be corrected.{{sfn|镇压六四主将、党内斗争牺牲品杨白冰病逝}} Zhao Ziyang remained under house arrest until his death in 2005. Zhao's aide [[Bao Tong]] has repeatedly called on the government to reverse its verdict on the demonstrations. Chen Xitong, the mayor of Beijing, who read the martial law order and was later disgraced by a political scandal, expressed regret in 2012, a year before his death, for the death of innocent civilians.{{sfn|Buckley|2013}} Premier [[Wen Jiabao]] reportedly suggested reversing the government's position on Tiananmen in party meetings prior to his departure from politics in 2013, only to be rebuffed by his colleagues.{{sfn|Anderlini|2013}}

===United Nations report===
During its 41st session, from November 3 to 21, 2008, the [[UN Committee Against Torture]] expressed concern over the lack of investigations into the reports of people &quot;killed, arrested or disappeared on or following the 4&amp;nbsp;June 1989 Beijing suppression.&quot; The Chinese government, it stated, had also failed to inform relatives of those individuals' fate, despite relatives' numerous requests. Meanwhile, those responsible for the use of excessive force had not &quot;faced any sanction, administrative or criminal.&quot;{{sfn|Committee Against Torture|2008|p=8}} The Committee recommended that the Chinese government should take all of those steps, plus &quot;offer apologies and reparation as appropriate and prosecute those found responsible for excessive use of force, torture and other ill-treatment.&quot;{{sfn|Committee Against Torture|2008|p=8}}

In December 2009, the Chinese government responded to the committee's recommendations by saying that the government had closed the case concerning the &quot;political turmoil in the spring and summer of 1989.&quot;{{sfn|Committee Against Torture|2008| p=13}} It also stated that the &quot;practice of the past 20 years has made it clear that the timely and decisive measures taken by the Chinese Government at the time were necessary and correct.&quot; It claimed that the labelling of the &quot;incident as 'the Democracy Movement{{' &quot;}} is a &quot;distortion in the nature of the incident.&quot; According to the Chinese Government such observations were &quot;inconsistent with the Committee's responsibilities.&quot;{{sfn|Committee Against Torture|2008| p=13}}

===Jem'Hadar===

====Bayonet====
The [[Jem'Hadar]] often have [[bayonet]]s attached to their plasma (AKA polaron-pulse) rifles. They employ these in close combat, or to execute prisoners. Often Jem'Hadar bayonets are chemically-enhanced, releasing a lethal nerve-agent on contact.

====Kar'takin====
These straight-bladed polearms are used by the Jem'Hadar in close combat. They were used by both Starfleet officers and Jem'Hadar in the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode &quot;To the Death&quot;. The Kar'takin bear a resemblance to the [[Bardiche]] axe.

====Shock Blade====
This weapon delivers a taser-like jolt to whatever it strikes in combat. Holding the shock blade's trigger discharges a beam of neuro-electrical energy, with an effective range of 15 feet.&lt;ref&gt;http://gaming.trekcore.com/thefallen/images/manualweapon2.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

===Klingon===

====Bat'leth (AKA betleH)====
{{Main|Bat'leth}}
[[File:Bat'leth.svg|thumb|A bat'leth]]
The bat'leth is the [[Klingon]] double-sided [[scimitar]]/[[hook sword]]/[[deer horn knives]] hybrid-edge weapon, designed by martial arts enthusiast and ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' effects producer [[Dan Curry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyc&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Star Trek Encyclopedia|author=[[Michael Okuda|Okuda, Mike]] and Denise Okuda, with Debbie Mirek|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=0-671-53609-5|year=1999|title-link=The Star Trek Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bat'leth is a curved blade with spiked protrusions and handholds along the middle of the blade's back. In battle, the handholds are used to twirl and spin the blade rapidly.

Klingon oral history holds that the first bat'leth was forged around 625 A.D. by [[Kahless]], who dropped a lock of his hair into the lava from the Kri'stak Volcano, then plunged the fiery lock into the lake of Lursor and twisted it to form a blade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyc&quot; /&gt; After forging the weapon, he used it to defeat the tyrant Molor, and in doing so united the [[Klingon#Homeworld|Klingon homeworld]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyc&quot; /&gt; This first bat'leth was known as the Sword of Kahless' and was stolen by the invading [[Hur'q]]; [[The Sword of Kahless|an episode of ''Deep Space Nine'']] revolves around an effort to recover the Sword of Kahless.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyc&quot; /&gt; The name bat'leth itself is a slight corruption of '''''batlh 'etlh''''', which means &quot;Sword of Honor&quot; in Klingon.

A &quot;Valdris&quot; blade was used in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in two [[7-Eleven]] armed-robberies in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Benzel |first1=Lance |title=Where no Klingon has gone before - 7-11 robberies |url=http://gazette.com/where-no-klingon-has-gone-before-7-11-robberies/article/47426 |work=The Colorado Springs Gazette |date=February 4, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611172537/http://gazette.com/where-no-klingon-has-gone-before-7-11-robberies/article/47426 |archive-date=June 11, 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chon'naq (AKA chonnaQ)====
A smaller version of this &quot;belly-spear&quot; (the literal Klingon translation) is used in the children's game of ''qa'vak''...which incorporates spinning hoops, and hones assorted skills needed for hunting. Once a male Klingon reaches the Age of Ascension, he is presented with an adult version of the chon'naq by his father - on the occasion of their first hunt together as men.

====D'k tahg (AKA Daqtagh)====
[[File:D´k tahg.svg|thumb|A d'k tahg]]
A d'k tahg is a Klingon [[dagger]]. The knife has three blades: a main blade with a cutout in the center, and two smaller blades on either side. In some models, these side blades are spring-loaded and can pop out into position and close up for storage. In other models, the blades are fixed. It also features a [[Hilt#Pommel|pommel]] studded with blunt spikes. The d'k tahg first appeared in ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock]]'', and appeared occasionally throughout the following films and television series. The knife was designed by [[Gil Hibben]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Hartink| first = A.E.| title = Complete Encyclopedia of Knives| publisher = Chartwell Books| date = September 30, 2005| location = Lisse, The Netherlands| pages = 168–169| isbn = 978-1-85409-168-0| url = https://archive.org/details/greatcombathandg0000thom/page/168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the d'k tahg appeared in ''Star Trek III,'' it was not referred to by its name until ''Star Trek: The Next Generation.''

====Haf'leth====
This polearm is similar to a halberd.

====Iw'taj (AKA 'Iw taj)====
Directly descended from the weapon which inspired the Klingon ''tIq'ghob'' emblem, this dagger (literal translation: &quot;blood-knife&quot;) is longer and heavier than the d’k tahg (which was derived from it). Unlike the d’k tahg, which was conceived as a general-purpose combat-knife intended for mass production, the iw'taj is a dedicated dueling weapon.

The two side-blades, one pointing up and one pointing down, serve particular functions. The upward-pointing blade is designed to catch an opponent's weapon and, with a twisting motion, disarm him. The downward-pointing blade is designed to inflict shallow cuts in passing, sapping the enemy's strength; said design allows the weapon to advance smoothly, without this blade getting in the way. Duelists often hook their index and middle fingers over the crossbar; doing this allows the weapon to achieve impressive agility, despite weakening the grip...although it may also be used with a reverse grip.

The iw'taj is often carried by traditionalists, and by discerning martial artists. Usually, a warrior who carries both a mek’leth and an iw'taj is from a Qvav’mar background...and/or is a personal combatant of high caliber.&lt;ref name=wordp&gt;https://startrekpilgrim.wordpress.com/2013/06/24/klingon-bladed-weapons/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jej'taj (AKA jejtaj)====
This throwing-dagger is more often used defensively, to ward off blade attacks. Typically, it is wielded as a combination knuckleduster/boomerang.

====Mek'leth (AKA meqleH)====
A mek'leth is the Klingon [[short sword]] that appears in several episodes of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' and in the film ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]''. Designed by [[Dan Curry]], it consists of a short, thick, curved blade with a metal guard extending back parallel with the grip to protect the hand. [[Worf]] is the most commonly seen user of the mek'leth, owning one and using it several times, including in [[hand-to-hand combat]] against [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] drones in ''First Contact''.

====Oy'naq (AKA 'oy'naQ)====
This &quot;pain-stick&quot; (the literal translation), capable of killing a 2-ton Rectyne Monopod, is used as part of the Klingon Age of Ascension ritual.

====Kut'luch (AKA qutluch)====
Similar to the d'k tahg, the kut'luch is &quot;the ceremonial weapon of an assassin&quot;. A kut'luch is designed to do considerable damage to internal organs, by Klingon standards thus making it an extremely lethal weapon. The kut'luch is featured in the ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' episode &quot;[[Sins of the Father (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Sins of the Father]]&quot;, when Worf's brother, Kurn, is stabbed; and in the ''Star Trek: Voyager'' episode &quot;[[Real Life (Star Trek: Voyager)|Real Life]]&quot;, where the Doctor's simulated &quot;son&quot; prepares for the Kut'luch ceremony.

====Tik'leth====
This “[[longsword]]” (the literal translation) is one of the more Terran-like Klingon weapons, by most standards. Like spears, tik'leths are traditional weapons of the rank-and-file...although many nobles prefer a tik'leth's offensive functionality to that of a bat'leth, while many soldiers carry mass-produced bat’leths as a status symbol.&lt;ref name=wordp/&gt;

===Romulan===

====Teral'n====
A [[Romulan]] [[polearm]], similar to a [[trident]] with retractable blades. It appears in the 2009 ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' reboot and is used by the renegade miner Nero. In the ''[[Star Trek: Countdown|Countdown]]'' comic, Nero's weapon is revealed to be the &quot;Debrune teral'n&quot;, an ancient Romulan artifact that symbolized the empire's power; it is traditionally held by the presiding [[Praetor]].

A similar weapon, resembling an [[axe]] was also used by a member of Nero's crew. While widely considered to also be a Teral'n, the weapon has yet to be confirmed as one by an official source.

===Vulcan===

====Ahn'woon====
An ahn'woon is a Vulcan catch-strangle weapon, similar in principle to the Earth Roman gladiator's [[cast net]]. However, it is much more versatile. Depending on the skill of the user, it can be used several ways. It is wide enough to be used as a [[Sling (weapon)|sling]]. (In the [[James Blish]] written adaptation of the ''TOS'' script, Kirk employs it this way and hits Spock in the ribs with a stone.) The multi-strapped weapon (approximately 1.1 meters long) uses weights on the ends of the straps, like [[bolas]], to entangle, stun, or cut the target. The application of tying action and wrapping, as with a [[garrote]], can restrict the breathing of the target, asphyxiating the victim. It is considered the oldest Vulcan weapon.

====Lirpa====
A lirpa is a [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] weapon consisting of a wooden staff a little over a meter in length, with a semicircular blade at one end and a metal bludgeon on the other. The overall length of the weapon appears to be approximately 48 inches. It is similar to the [[monk's spade]] and the [[pugil stick]]. Captain [[James T. Kirk]] and [[Spock]] used lirpas when they fought for possession of [[Amok Time|T'Pring]] during Spock's [[Pon farr]] ritual in &quot;[[Amok Time]]&quot;. Soldiers sent after [[Jonathan Archer]] and [[T'Pol]] fought with lirpas because Vulcan's &quot;Forge&quot; region makes conventional energy weapons useless.

===Others===

====Glavin====
In the ''TNG'' episode &quot;Code of Honor&quot;, the Ligonians have deep traditions of fighting with a poison-tipped hand weapon called a Glavin. It is a large glove with a recurved claw at the end, and covered with dozens of spines. In several episodes, Worf is seen displaying one in his quarters, most likely the same one used by Lt. Tasha Yar.

====Mortaes====
In the ''TOS'' episode &quot;The Cloud Minders&quot;, mortaes and thongs are mining tools used as martial weapons by the &quot;troglyte&quot; (a corruption of &quot;[[Caveman|troglodyte]]&quot;) miners, and apparently the ruling class is also trained with these weapons, as Plasus challenges Kirk to hand-to-hand combat, asking, &quot;Are you as brave with a mortae as with a phaser?&quot; Kirk responds, &quot;Both will kill.&quot;

====Ushaan-tor====
In the ''Enterprise'' episode &quot;United&quot;, Andorian commander [[Thy'lek Shran]] and the NX-01's captain [[Jonathan Archer]], as a second for a Tellarite officer who kills Tallas, Shran's chief tactical officer and lover, engage in an Andorian &quot;ushaan&quot; duel. The weapon used is the '''ushaan-tor''', an Andorian ice-mining blade. The handheld blade of the ''ushaan-tor'' is about 20&amp;nbsp;cm from end to end, and resembles an Inupiat [[Ulu]] blade from Alaska, but in a one-piece all-metal design instead of having a separate wooden handle.

==Subspace weapons==
Subspace weapons are a class of directed energy weapons that directly affect [[subspace (Star Trek)|subspace]]. The weapons can produce actual tears in subspace, and are extremely unpredictable. These weapons were banned under [[Khitomer Accord|the second Khitomer Accord]]. The Son'a equipped their vessels with these types of weapons.

===Isolytic burst===
[[Son'a]] vessels carried and used isolytic burst weapons, a type of subspace weapon. They were seen using this weapon against the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)|''Enterprise''-E]] in ''Star Trek: Insurrection''. The ''Enterprise'' was only able to escape the weapon's effect by ejecting its warp core and detonating it to seal a subspace rift.

===Tricobalt devices===
The tricobalt warhead is a subspace weapon whose high-yield detonations can tear holes in subspace. Tricobalt devices are not a standard armament of Federation vessels and yields are calculated in Tera-Cochranes, indicating that its mechanism is somewhat similar to the general reaction in a warp field.

In ''TOS'': &quot;[[A Taste of Armageddon]]&quot;, the Eminian Union classified the USS ''Enterprise'' as 'destroyed' when it was hit by virtual tricobalt satellites. In ''DS9'': &quot;[[Trials and Tribble-ations]]&quot;, Arne Darvin plants a tricobalt explosive in a dead Tribble in an attempt to kill Kirk. [[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|USS ''Voyager'']] uses a pair of tricobalt devices to destroy the Caretaker array in the ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' pilot episode, &quot;[[Caretaker (Star Trek: Voyager)|Caretaker]]&quot;, and such a device was used against ''Voyager'' in the episode &quot;[[Blink of an Eye (Star Trek: Voyager)|Blink of an Eye]]&quot;. A tricobalt warhead was also used by the [[Tholian]]s in the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' episode &quot;[[In a Mirror, Darkly]]&quot;. They detonated a tricobalt warhead inside the [[gravity well]] of a dead star. The explosion created an interphasic rift, which they used to lure the Federation starship USS ''Defiant'' from another universe.

The games ''[[Star Trek: Armada]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Armada II]]'' have ships armed with Tricobalt devices for artillery support. The [[Federation]] ''Steamrunner''-class, the [[Klingon]] ''Chuq'Beh''-class Bird of Prey, the [[Romulan]] ''Raptor''-class Warbird, and the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] Harbinger are all capable of using them. The workings of the weapon is unknown but theorised is the use of [[Cobalt-60]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| episode-link=The Voyager Conspiracy| title=The Voyager Conspiracy| series=[[Star Trek: Voyager]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| episode-link=In a Mirror, Darkly| title=In a Mirror, Darkly, Part 1| series=[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is far more likely that tricobalt refers to the third periodical table analog for cobalt; similar to dilithium being the second periodic table equivalent of regular lithium. &quot;trititanium&quot; and most other in trek universe usage where a numeric prefix is appended to a regular real world periodic table element refers to additional periodic tables whose elements are composed of nucleons that are not protons or neutrons and maybe not even regular electrons yet can form atoms molecules and chemical compounds similar to normal matter.

Neutron radiation such as produced by a Cobalt 60 weapon is not very useful for destroying outposts, starships or anything else that is not a living creature.

==Other weapons==

===Magnetometric guided charges===
Around Stardate 43995, the Borg used this weapon to drive the USS ''Enterprise'', NCC-1701-D, from the Paulson Nebula. This shortly leads to the abduction of Captain Jean-Luc Picard.

===Multikinetic neutronic mines===
During Season 4, Episode 1 of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', [[Kathryn Janeway|Captain Janeway]] consults with Borg representative Seven of Nine on how to destroy [[Species 8472]]. Janeway calls Seven of Nine's &quot;multikinetic neutronic mine&quot; a &quot;weapon of mass destruction,&quot; following up on a statement from [[Tuvok]] that it would affect an entire starsystem, destroying innocent worlds. The mine's five-million isoton yield can disperse Borg nanoprobes across a five-light year range.

===Dreadnought===
Dreadnought was a Cardassian self-guided missile, containing one thousand kilograms of matter, and another thousand of antimatter. Tuvok describes this as enough to destroy a small moon. Although described as a self-guided missile, in practice Dreadnought functions much like an autonomous starship, and it even had life support capability on board. It possesses shields, phasers, a complement of quantum torpedoes, a Thoron shock emitter, a plasma wave weapon, engines capable of reaching at least Warp 9, and a sophisticated computer AI. It appears in the ''Voyager'' [[Dreadnought (Star Trek: Voyager)|episode of the same name]]. It had been captured by the [[Maquis (Star Trek)|Maquis]] due to a failed detonator and reprogrammed to attack its original creators. It was dragged into the Delta Quadrant in much the same manner as ''Voyager'', and when unable to resolve the unforeseen situation it locked on to a planet that was similar to the one it was programmed to target, but which was inhabited by innocents. Dreadnought was equipped with an exceptionally sophisticated artificial intelligence, capable of &quot;paranoia&quot; to a certain degree, as when reprogrammer B'Elanna Torres attempted to prevent it from destroying the innocent planet, it came to the conclusion that she had been captured by her Cardassian enemies and forced to make up a story to prevent the attack; it then ''pretended'' to follow her commands and shut down, only to re-activate and continue its mission once she was no longer aboard.

===Series 5 long range tactical armor unit===
Similar in purpose to the Cardassian Dreadnought, the Tactical Armor Units are self-guided missiles with sophisticated artificial intelligence. They are much smaller than Dreadnought, being only a few feet in length, and while nowhere near as powerful, they are nonetheless classified as weapons of mass destruction, capable of destroying everything in a 200-kilometer radius with a highly focused antimatter explosion. Their coordination and control is done through a &quot;Strategic Command Matrix&quot;, analogous to a nuclear control network of the type used by the United States. Each one possesses shielding, warp drive of indeterminate speed, and a sentient, [[genius]]-level [[artificial intelligence]] programmed to do whatever is necessary to reach their targets and detonate. They can detect and prevent tampering, are intelligent enough to find a way past almost any obstacle, and can win engagements even when outnumbered. They were created by a Delta Quadrant race called the Druoda, and the devices were greatly feared for their endurance and tenacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| episode-link=Warhead (Star Trek: Voyager)| title=Warhead| series=[[Star Trek: Voyager]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Q firearms===
Q firearms were used in the Q Civil War by the ''Voyager'' crew to compensate against the infinite power of the Q in &quot;[[The Q and the Grey]]&quot;. They are depicted as muzzle-loading muskets, to fit with the American Civil War-theme used by the Q Continuum as a concession to the human characters' limited perceptions. Presumably, their actual form would be as incomprehensible to non-Q as the Continuum itself. The use of the weapons caused stars to go supernova as a side effect in normal reality. They are arguably the most powerful weapons ever wielded by any humanoid species, as indicated by their ability to injure the otherwise-invulnerable Q.

===Red matter===
In the 2009 ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' reboot, red matter was developed on [[Vulcan (Star Trek planet)#Homeworld|Vulcan]] before 2387. When even a droplet is ignited an unstable [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] is formed; accordingly, it must be stored in a protective chamber. The red matter was originally to be used to save the Romulan homeworld from a volatile [[supernova]], but the design was finished too late to prevent Romulus' destruction. Upon capture in the &quot;past&quot; (2258) by the Romulan Nero, it was used as a planet-destroying [[doomsday weapon]] in conjunction with a plasma drill which bored a hole almost to the core of a planet. A small amount of red matter was then activated at the bottom of the drilling site, creating a black hole in the heart of the planet that would tear it apart from within. Red matter was thus used to destroy an alternate Vulcan (&quot;alternate&quot; due to temporal disruption, from Nero's haphazard method of time travel), then ultimately destroyed Nero's ship, the ''Narada'', along with all remaining technology from his ship, and all of the remaining red matter.

===Psionic resonator===
A psionic resonator was a weapon that functioned by amplifying telepathic energy and focusing it into kinetic form. In 2369 one type of Vulcan psionic resonator, known as the Stone of Gol was discovered to still exist, though in pieces, long after it was thought destroyed. The mercenary Arctus Baran was hired to locate the pieces and deliver them to the Vulcan Isolationist Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| episode-link=Gambit (Star Trek: The Next Generation)| title=Gambit| series=[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|Carriage using animals to provide rapid motive power}} 
[[File:Biga. Festa do esquecemento. Xinzo de Limia, Ourense, Galicia.jpg|thumb|250px|Reconstructed Roman chariot drawn by horses.]]
[[File:Chariot spread.png|thumb|250px|Approximate historical map of the spread of the spoke-wheeled chariot, 2000–500 BC.]]

A '''chariot''' is a type of [[carriage]] driven by a charioteer, usually using horses{{Efn|Although there were rare exceptions to the use of horses to pull chariots. For instance, the lion-pulled chariot described by [[Plutarch]] in his ''[[Parallel Lives|Life of Antony]]''.}} to provide rapid motive power. Chariots were used by armies as transport or mobile [[archery]] platforms, for hunting or for racing, and as a conveniently fast way to travel for many ancient people.

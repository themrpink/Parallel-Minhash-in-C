The size of blood vessels is different for each of them. It ranges from a diameter of about 25 millimeters for the aorta to only 8 micrometers in the capillaries. This comes out to about a 3000-fold range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/medicine/anatomy-and-physiology/anatomy-and-physiology/blood-vessels|title=Blood Vessels – Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vasoconstriction]] is the constriction of blood vessels (narrowing, becoming smaller in cross-sectional area) by contracting the [[vascular smooth muscle]] in the vessel walls. It is regulated by [[vasoconstrictor]]s (agents that cause vasoconstriction). These include [[paracrine]] factors (e.g. [[prostaglandin]]s), a number of [[hormone]]s (e.g. [[Antidiuretic hormone|vasopressin]] and [[angiotensin]]) and [[neurotransmitter]]s (e.g. [[epinephrine]]) from the nervous system.

[[Vasodilation]] is a similar process mediated by antagonistically acting mediators. The most prominent vasodilator is [[nitric oxide]] (termed [[endothelium-derived relaxing factor]] for this reason).

===Blood flow===
{{Main |Vascular resistance}}
The circulatory system uses the channel of blood vessels to deliver blood to all parts of the body. This is a result of the left and right side of the heart working together to allow blood to flow continuously to the lungs and other parts of the body. Oxygen-poor blood enters the right side of the heart through two large veins. Oxygen-rich blood from the lungs enters through the pulmonary veins on the left side of the heart into the aorta and then reaches the rest of the body. The capillaries are responsible for allowing the blood to receive oxygen through tiny air sacs in the lungs. This is also the site where carbon dioxide exits the blood. This all occurs in the lungs where blood is oxygenated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/hypertension-working-heart|title=How the Heart Works|website=WebMD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The blood pressure in blood vessels is traditionally expressed in [[torr|millimetres of mercury]] (1 mmHg = 133 [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]). In the arterial system, this is usually around 120 mmHg [[Systole (medicine)|systolic]] (high pressure wave due to contraction of the heart) and 80 mmHg [[diastolic]] (low pressure wave). In contrast, pressures in the venous system are constant and rarely exceed 10 mmHg.

[[Vascular resistance]] occurs where the vessels away from the heart oppose the flow of blood. Resistance is an accumulation of three different factors: blood viscosity, blood vessel length, and vessel radius.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Anatomy Physiology: The Unity of Form and Function, Saladin, McGraw Hill, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Blood viscosity is the thickness of the blood and its resistance to flow as a result of the different components of the blood. Blood is 92% water by weight and the rest of blood is composed of protein, nutrients, electrolytes, wastes, and dissolved gases. Depending on the health of an individual, the blood viscosity can vary (i.e. anemia causing relatively lower concentrations of protein, high blood pressure an increase in dissolved salts or lipids, etc.).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Vessel length is the total length of the vessel measured as the distance away from the heart. As the total length of the vessel increases, the total resistance as a result of friction will increase.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Vessel radius also affects the total resistance as a result of contact with the vessel wall. As the radius of the wall gets smaller, the proportion of the blood making contact with the wall will increase. The greater amount of contact with the wall will increase the total resistance against the blood flow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vessel Radius&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Factors that Affect Blood Pressure|url=http://www.interactivephysiology.com/demo/misc/assignmentfiles/cardiovascular/Fact_Aff_Blood_Pressure.pdf|url-status=dead|accessdate=21 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517024049/http://www.interactivephysiology.com/demo/misc/assignmentfiles/cardiovascular/Fact_Aff_Blood_Pressure.pdf|archive-date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disease ==
{{main|Vascular disease}}

Blood vessels play a huge role in virtually every medical condition. [[Cancer]], for example, cannot progress unless the tumor causes [[angiogenesis]] (formation of new blood vessels) to supply the malignant cells' metabolic demand. [[Atherosclerosis]], the formation of [[lipid]] lumps ([[atheroma]]s) in the blood vessel wall, is the most common [[cardiovascular disease]], the main cause of death in the Western world.

Blood vessel permeability is increased in [[inflammation]]. Damage, due to [[Physical trauma|trauma]] or spontaneously, may lead to [[hemorrhage]] due to mechanical damage to the vessel endothelium. In contrast, occlusion of the blood vessel by atherosclerotic plaque, by an [[embolism|embolised]] [[blood clot]] or a foreign body leads to downstream [[ischemia]] (insufficient blood supply) and possibly [[necrosis]]. Vessel occlusion tends to be a positive feedback system; an occluded vessel creates eddies in the normally [[laminar flow]] or [[plug flow]] blood currents. These eddies create abnormal fluid velocity gradients which push blood elements such as cholesterol or [[chylomicron]] bodies to the endothelium. These deposit onto the arterial walls which are already partially occluded and build upon the blockage.&lt;ref&gt;Multiphase Flow and Fluidization, Gidaspow et al., Academic Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common disease of the blood vessels is hypertension or high blood pressure. This is caused by an increase in the pressure of the blood flowing through the vessels. Hypertension can lead to more serious conditions such as heart failure and stroke. To prevent these diseases, the most common treatment option is medication as opposed to surgery. Aspirin helps prevent blood clots and can also help limit inflammation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mercyhealth.org/services/heart/heart-disease/blood-vessels/|title=Blood Vessel Diseases – Mercy Health System|website=www.mercyhealth.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vasculitis]] is [[inflammation]] of the vessel wall, due to [[autoimmune disease]] or [[infection]].

[[File:Dry ski slopes.JPG|thumb|Dry ski slope in Sátoraljaújhely, Hungary ([http://www.neveplast.it/ Neveplast])]]
[[File:Warmwell.jpg|thumb|Warmwell artificial ski slope in Dorset, U.K. ([[Snowflex]])]]
&lt;references group=&quot;http://www.fitforfun.de/sport/outdoor/abenteuer/textile-skipisten-wintersport-mal-anders-235265.html&quot; /&gt;A '''dry ski slope''' or '''artificial ski slope''' is a [[ski slope]] that mimics the attributes of [[snow]] using materials that are stable at room [[temperature]], to enable people to [[skiing|ski]], [[snowboarding|snowboard]] or [[Tubing (recreation)#Snow|snow tube]] in places where natural, snow-covered slopes are inconvenient or unavailable.

Although commonly known as &quot;dry ski slopes&quot;, many slopes are lubricated using a mist or jet system to increase speed and prevent damage to equipment from friction heat build-up. As a general rule, they are found predominantly in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Netherlands]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} as other European countries tend to have ready access to real snow fields, as does North America in the winter.

== Materials ==

=== Early materials ===

A variety of materials can be found on dry ski slopes.

Early efforts to mimic snow involved laying extruded [[plastic]] tiles with upward spikes in an attempt to provide grip. These were unpopular as they provided little grip and turning capability and the experience was similar to skiing across [[ice]].

However, in present day, many ski slopes (both indoor and outdoor) continue to use plastic, injection moulded tiles. Quality has improved and many dry ski slopes in the Netherlands use these tiles for training and championships.

=== Brush materials ===
[[File:Dendix.jpg|thumb|Dendix mesh material]]

The next stage in dry ski slope development came with the brush industry. The most common material is Dendix&lt;ref&gt;http://www.osborn.com/en-de/products/ski-mats.html&lt;/ref&gt; which is a by-product of brush manufacturing and is similar to a short-[[hair]]ed [[brush]] with the [[bristle]]s sticking upwards. Dendix is manufactured in [[Chepstow]], however it can be found on slopes throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Western Mail |url=http://www.natives.co.uk/news/2002/1102/18mosc.htm |title=Dendix installing ski slope in Moscow | publisher = Natives.co.uk |date=18 November 2002 |accessdate=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is arranged in a [[hexagon]]al pattern of approximately {{convert|1|in|adj=on}} strips of bristles in a {{convert|4|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} hexagon. Although it was a significant advancement from previous surfaces, concern over damage to slope users (it provides little or no impact protection to a slope user when falling) and ski or [[snowboard]] damage due to friction meant litigation for slopes using it was a constant threat. Nowadays [[water]] is often sprayed onto the surface of the dendix to [[lubrication|lubricate]] it and increase speed; however, higher [[insurance]] premiums cause many slope operators to look for safer alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Shephard GJ, Saab M, Ali KH |title=Upper limb in injuries in dry ski slope skiing—a continuing problem |journal=Eur J Emerg Med |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=31–4 |date=March 2000 |pmid=10839376 |doi=10.1097/00063110-200003000-00006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite more recent materials, Dendix remains the most popular plastic slope material in use.

=== Needle mushroom dry ski mat ===
[[File:JF dryski mat.jpg|thumb|left|Needle mushroom dry ski mat]]
[[File:JF dryski slope in Beijing Olympic forest park.jpg|thumb|right|Dry ski slope in Beijing Olympic forest park]]
In [[Chengdu]], China, a dry ski mat called a &quot;needle mushroom dry ski mat&quot; has been in use since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.basi.org.uk/world-winter-snowsports-exhibition-2017-day-1 Day 1 at the World Winter Snowsports Exhibition 2017 (WWSE) Beijing was super busy for BASI] British Association of Snowsport Instructors. 2017-09-08.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Source is a blog|date=January 2019}}{{Failed verification|reason=Needle mushroom dry ski mat not specifically mentioned in link provided|date=January 2019}} It is made of a plastic and aluminium base with many soybean-like beads on the surface. There are more than 20 slopes of needle mushroom dry ski mat, and new dry ski slopes are created each year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://shop.ispo.com/products/2017-china-ski-industry-white-book-chinese-english 2017 China Ski Industry White Book] ISPO Sports Network. Retrieved 2019-01-12.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Source is a commercial for a book|date=January 2019}}{{Failed verification|reason=Assertion not supported in link provided|date=January 2019}}

=== Recent materials ===
[[File:Artificial ski slopes.JPG|thumb|left| Neveplast dry ski slope.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neveplast.it/products/np30&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The most recent development has seen a crop of materials providing both impact protection and slope lubrication as well as the ability to perform turns, erect jumps, rails and quarterpipes and provide a ride that is closer to the feel of real snow. [http://www.neveplast.it Neveplast] is one of these, a newer material whose use is becoming even more common. This new type of mat, which uses a concentric arrangement of conical stems, is marketed for downhill, snowboarding and cross country skiing. Neveplast claims to be certified as having the same coefficient of friction between the surface and the ski as snow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neveplast.it/products/np30/| title=Neveplast NP30 product page |publisher=Neveplast Italia |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the skier a good side grip, with the same skis used on the snow, and without the need for water. The Neveplast cooling hole has a comparable diameter to the F.I.S. slalom pole standards used for training and competition in both slalom and giant slalom. Neveplast is also used for school camps. This surface is modular and flexible, used frequently also for Urban freestyle parks.
[[File:MRSNOW Speedski-Test-Tignes-2017-07 7.jpg|alt=Mr. Snow dry ski slopes on the Grande Motte glacier|thumb|Mr. Snow dry ski slopes on the Grande Motte glacier]]
A German provider that guarantees year round skiing is [http://mrsnow.de/ Mr. Snow]. The company does not only produce dry slopes for downhill skiing, snowboarding and cross country skiing but also provides [[Tubing (recreation)|tubing tracks]] and rental opportunities for events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainzund.de/skifahren-bei-30-grad-aktion-im-binger-wald-noch-diese-woche/| title=Skiing while 30 degrees in the Bingen forest |publisher=Mainz&amp; |accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The material of Mr. Snow is claimed to have very good sliding capacities, is predictable in all climates and does not harm the ski or sliding surface. Mr. Snow works without the use of [[silicone]] which is not necessary to achieve good sliding characteristics. The snow carpet evidently has no negative environmental impact. So the mats can remain on the surface 365 days a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mr. Snow |url=http://mrsnow.de/allgemein/event-sommer-skiwoche-zum-200-geburtstag-rheinhessens/ |title=Ski school acitivies during a summer week with Mr. Snow modules |date=16 July 2016 |accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
But it is also possible to remove them very quickly if it is required.  Temporary using can be realized with the 20 sqm modules.

[[File:Snowflex.jpg|thumb|Snowflex|left]] 
Another very common mat is [[Snowflex]], manufactured near [[Huddersfield]], [[West Yorkshire]] in England by Briton Engineering Developments Limited. Others include Perma-snow by [[John Nike]] Leisure/ Techmat 2000, also in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and Astroride by NorCal Extreme Sports in the United States. [[Snowflex]] and Perma-snow are both white in colour, although the former has been produced in a darker green (such as in [[Kendal Ski Club]] in [[Cumbria]], England) to comply with planning requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southlakeland.gov.uk/CIS/pdf/3616.pdf |title=Minutes of South Lakeland council meeting|accessdate=10 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809121554/http://www.southlakeland.gov.uk/CIS/pdf/3616.pdf |archivedate=9 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Snowboard Club UK |url=http://www.snowboardclub.co.uk/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=2182 |title=Discussion on synthetic surfaces |publisher=Snowboardclub.co.uk |accessdate=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no indication from NorCal Extreme Sports that AstroRide has been commercially tested to any great extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astroride.com/news.asp |title=NorCal Extreme Sports news page |publisher=Astroride.com |accessdate=10 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215010711/http://www.astroride.com/news.asp |archivedate=15 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Proslope surface.jpg|thumb|Proslope Artificial Snow Sports Matting.]]
The latest arrival is from UK company Proslope who produce a matting with variable filament lengths to emulate the gradual edge grip and release of snow. As with some other surfaces, the system is coloured white, is modular, and works both with and without a misting system.

== Ski and board preparation ==
Dry slope users often improve the performance of their equipment by using the hardest grade of [[ski wax]]. The wax wears off quickly, however, and must be renewed after one or two sessions. At least one company makes a hard wax that is intended for use on dry slopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Plastic Slope Fluoro Waxes | publisher = Datawax | url = http://www.datawax.com/datawax/showrange.do?range=2 | accessdate = 26 August 2009 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100117054429/http://www.datawax.com/datawax/showrange.do?range=2 | archivedate = 17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some users apply aerosol furniture polish or other can based products to the bases of their skis or boards as the silicone oil it contains is reputed to reduce friction. Other substances, such as [[dishwashing liquid]], are sometimes used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =  James Gambrill reports from the Kings Ski Club National Finals, 08 May 2007 | url = http://www.natives.co.uk/do/ecco.py/view_item?listid=9&amp;listcatid=39&amp;listitemid=3164 | accessdate = 26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juan Manuel Fangio''' ({{IPA-es|ˈfanχjo}}, {{IPA-it|ˈfandʒo}}; 24 June 1911&amp;nbsp;– 17 July 1995), nicknamed ''El Chueco'' (&quot;the bowlegged&quot; or &quot;bandy legged one&quot;) or ''El Maestro'' (&quot;The Master&quot;), was an [[Argentine]] racing car driver. He dominated the first decade of [[Formula One]] racing, winning the World Drivers' Championship five times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statsf1.com/en/juan-manuel-fangio.aspx|title=Juan Manuel FANGIO|website=statsf1.com|language=en|access-date=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From childhood, he abandoned his studies to pursue auto mechanics. In 1938, he debuted in [[Turismo Carretera]], competing in a Ford V8. In 1940, he competed with Chevrolet, winning the Grand Prix International Championship and devoted his time to the Argentine Turismo Carretera becoming its champion, a title he successfully defended a year later. Fangio then competed in Europe between 1947 and 1949, where he achieved further success.

He won the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Championship of Drivers]] five times—a record which stood for 46 years until beaten by [[Michael Schumacher]]—with four different teams ([[Alfa Romeo (Formula One)|Alfa Romeo]], [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]], [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes-Benz]] and [[Maserati in motorsport|Maserati]]), a feat that has not been repeated. He is regarded by many as one of the greatest F1 drivers in history, and considered by some to be the greatest of all time.&lt;ref name=HOF&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.formula1.com/en/championship/drivers/hall-of-fame/Juan_Manuel_Fangio.html |title=Juan Manuel Fangio |first=Gerald |last=Donaldson |publisher=Formula One |accessdate=2018-05-28 |quote=Many consider him to be the greatest driver of all time.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.redbull.com/gb-en/fangio-the-greatest-formula-1-driver-ever|title=Revealed: F1's best-ever driver|website=Red Bull}}&lt;/ref&gt;
he holds the highest winning percentage in Formula One – 46.15% – winning 24 of 52 Formula One races he entered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statsf1.com/en/statistiques/pilote/victoire/nombre.aspx|title=Statistics Drivers - Wins - By number|website=statsf1.com|language=en|access-date=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fangio is the only [[Formula One drivers from Argentina|Argentine driver]] to have won the [[Argentine Grand Prix]], which he won four times in his career, more than any other driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statsf1.com/en/statistiques/pilote/victoire/national.aspx|title=Statistics Drivers - Wins - By national GP|website=statsf1.com|language=en|access-date=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statsf1.com/en/grand-prix-argentina.aspx?lst=vp|title=Grands Prix Argentina|website=statsf1.com|language=en|access-date=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After retirement, Fangio presided as the honorary president of Mercedes-Benz Argentina from 1987, a year after the inauguration of his museum, until his death in 1995. On the centenary of his birth in 2011, Fangio was remembered around the world and various activities were held in his honor.

==Early life==
Fangio's grandfather, Giuseppe Fangio, emigrated to Buenos Aires from Italy in 1887. Giuseppe managed to buy his own farm near [[Balcarce, Buenos Aires|Balcarce]], a small city in southern [[Buenos Aires Province]], Argentina, within three years by making [[charcoal]] from tree branches. Giuseppe brought his family, with his 7-year son Loreto, later the racing driver's father, to Argentina from the small central Italian town of [[Castiglione Messer Marino]] in the [[Chieti]] province of the [[Abruzzo]] region. His mother, Herminia Déramo, was from [[Tornareccio]], slightly to the north. Fangio's parents married on 24 October 1903 and lived on farms, where Herminia was a housekeeper and Loreto worked in the building trade, becoming an apprentice stonemason.{{sfn|Donaldson|2003|p=7-8}}

Fangio was born in Balcarce on 24 June 1911, [[Nativity of St. John the Baptist|San Juan's Day]], at 12:10&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;ref name=obituaries&gt;{{cite web|url=http://f1fanatics.wordpress.com/hall-of-fame/juan-manuel-fangio/ |title=F1 Fanatics: Juan Manuel Fangio |publisher=F1fanatics.wordpress.com |date=31 January 2011 |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His birth certificate was mistakenly dated 23 June in the Register of Balcarce.&lt;ref name=earlylife&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.museofangio.com/en/juan-manuel-fangio/biography/1-primera-parte-1911-1936/ |title=Biography -First Part 1911-1936|website=Museo Fangio|accessdate= 4 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the fourth of six children.&lt;ref name=tribute&gt;{{cite news|last=Tremayne|first=David|title=Obituaries: Juan Manuel Fangio | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaries-juan-manuel-fangio-1591999.html | newspaper=The Independent | date=18 July 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his childhood he became known as ''El Chueco'', the bandy-legged one, for his skill in bending his left leg around the ball to shoot on goal in [[Association football|football]] games.&lt;ref name=tribute /&gt;

Fangio started his education at School No. 4 of Balcarce, before transferring to School No. 1 and 18 Uriburu Av.&lt;ref name=earlylife /&gt; When Fangio was 13, he dropped out of school and worked in Miguel Angel Casas auto mechanics' workshop as an assistant mechanic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Juan Manuel Fangio – Developed Childhood Interest in Cars|url=http://sports.jrank.org/pages/1413/Fangio-Juan-Manuel-Developed-Childhood-Interest-in-Cars.html|publisher=jrank.org|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was 16, he started riding as a mechanic for his employer's customers. He developed pneumonia, which almost proved fatal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Juan Manuel Fangio – Pieced Together Own Race Car|url=http://sports.jrank.org/pages/1414/Fangio-Juan-Manuel-Pieced-Together-Own-Race-Car.html|publisher=jrank.org|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; after a football game where hard running had caused a sharp pain in his chest. He was bed-ridden for two months, cared for by his mother.{{sfn|Donaldson|2003|p=14-15}}

After recovering, Fangio served compulsory military service at the age of 21. In 1932 he was enlisted at the Campo de Mayo cadet school near Buenos Aires. His driving skills caught the attention of his commanding officer, who appointed Fangio as his official driver. Fangio was discharged before his 22nd birthday, after taking his final physical examination. He returned to Balcarce where he aimed to further his football career. Along with his friend José Duffard he received offers to play at a club based in [[Mar del Plata]]. Their teammates at Balcarce suggested the two work on Fangio's hobby of building his own car, and his parents gave him space to do so in a rudimentary shed at the family home.{{sfn|Donaldson|2003|p=14-15}}

==Early racing career==
[[File:1950 Simca Gordini T15s.JPG|thumb|right|1950 Simca Gordini T15s, as raced, and retired, at the [[1950 24 Hours of Le Mans]] by [[José Froilán González]] and Juan Manuel Fangio]]
After finishing his military service, Fangio opened his own garage and raced in local events. He began his racing career in Argentina in 1936, driving a 1929 [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|{{nowrap|Ford Model&amp;nbsp;A}}]] that he had rebuilt. In the Tourism Highway category, Fangio participated in his first race between 18 and 30 October 1938 as the co-pilot of Luis Finocchietti. Despite not winning the Argentine Road Grand Prix, Fangio drove most of the way and finished 5th. In November of that year, he entered the &quot;400&amp;nbsp;km of [[Tres Arroyos]] &quot;, but it was suspended due to a fatal accident.&lt;ref name=&quot;Web2&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.museofangio.com/es/biografia/2-second-hand-1937-1942/|title = Part Two (1937–1942)|accessdate=15 February 2011|publisher=Foundation Fangio |location=Argentina }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time racing in Argentina, he drove [[Chevrolet]] cars and was Argentine National Champion in 1940 and 1941. One particular race, the 1940 Gran Premio del Norte, was almost 10,000&amp;nbsp;km (6,250&amp;nbsp;mi) long, one that Fangio described as a &quot;terrible ordeal&quot;. This race started in [[Buenos Aires]] on 27 September, and ran up through the [[Andes]] and [[Bolivia]] to [[Lima]], [[Peru]], and then back to Buenos Aires, taking 15 days, ending on 12 October with stages held each day. This horrendously gruelling race was held in the most varied and difficult conditions imaginable- held at variable times in hot and dry deserts, insect-ridden jungles with crushing humidity and {{Convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=out}} cliff drops, and mountain passes in freezing cold, snowy weather at extremely high altitude, sometimes in darkness- all on a mixture of dirt and paved roads. Early in the race Fangio hit a large rock and damaged the car's driveshaft, which in the next town would have to be replaced. Later on at an overnight stop in Bolivia one of the townspeople crashed into Fangio's car and bent an axle- he and his co-driver had to spend all night fixing it. Following this repair the fanblade got loose and punctured the radiator, which meant another repair before it would have to be replaced later. They drove 150 miles through scorching desert with no water, and during a night stint the headlights fell off and they had to be secured with his co-driver's necktie. The weather in the mountains was so cold that Fangio had to drive with his co-driver's arms around him for hours. These mountainous routes in Bolivia and Peru would sometimes involve going up to altitudes of 14,000 feet above sea level- a 40 percent reduction of air thickness, making breathing incredibly difficult and the engine being severely down on power. When he finally got back to Buenos Aires, Fangio had won this race- his first big victory.

In 1941, he beat [[Oscar Gálvez]] in the Grand Prix [[Getúlio Vargas]] in Brazil. For the second time, Fangio was crowned champion of Argentine TC. In 1942, he took tenth place in the South Grand Prix. In April he won the race &quot;Mar y Sierras&quot;, and then had to suspend activity due to World War II.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Web2&quot;/&gt; In 1946, Fangio returned to racing with two races in [[Morón]] and [[Tandil]] driving a [[Ford T|Ford&amp;nbsp;T]]. In February 1947, Fangio competed at National Mechanics (MN) at the Retiro circuit, and on 1 March, he started the race for Rosario City Award. Subsequently, Fangio triumphed in the 'Double Back Window' Race.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Web3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museofangio.com/es/biografia/3-tercera-part-1943-1949/|title = Part Three (1943–1949) | accessdate = 15 February 2011 |publisher=Foundation Fangio |location=Argentina}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1948, Fangio however suffered a personal tragedy in another gruelling race, this time a point-to-point race from Buenos Aires to Caracas, Venezuela- a 20-day event covering a distance of 9,580&amp;nbsp;km (5,950&amp;nbsp;mi) through Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and finally Venezuela. Fangio, with his co-driver Daniel Urrutia battled hard with brothers Juan and Oscar Galvez, and Domingo Marimon throughout. On the 10th day, on the Lima to Tumbes stage in northern Peru, on coastal roads along the Pacific Ocean, Fangio was driving at night in thick fog generated from the ocean in near-pitch black darkness when he approached a left hand bend at 140&amp;nbsp;km/h (87&amp;nbsp;mph) near the village of Huanchaco. With his cars' lights not helping him much thanks to the thick fog, he approached the bend too fast, lost control of the car and tumbled down an embankment, and Urrutia was thrown out of the car through the front windscreen. Oscar Galvez stopped to help Fangio, who had neck injuries, soon found the badly injured Urrutia. Another competitor, Luciano Marcilla, stopped and took Fangio and Urrutia to the nearest hospital in the town of Chocope 50&amp;nbsp;km (31&amp;nbsp;mi) away. Fangio survived but 35-year-old Urrutia did not, suffering multiple fatal cervical and basal skull fractures. Domingo Marimon won the race, but the race was a disaster and was marred by the deaths of 3 spectactors and 3 drivers (including Urrutia).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://motorsportmemorial.org/focus.php?db=ct&amp;n=1340|title=Motorsport Memorial -|website=motorsportmemorial.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fangio believed he would never race again and entered a depressed state after the death of his friend, but he soon got out of his saddened state, and his successes in Argentina caught the attention of the Argentine Automobile Club and the [[Juan Peron]]-led Argentine government, so they bought a Maserati and sent him to Europe in December 1948 to continue his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;cheqflag&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Rendall |first=Ivan |title=The Chequered Flag: 100 years of motor racing| publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson| origyear=1993| year=1995| isbn=0-297-83550-5| page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;grandprixhistory.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprixhistory.org/fangio_bio.htm|title=Juan-Manuel Fangio – Biography|work=grandprixhistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fangio was the oldest driver in many of his Formula One races, having started his Grand Prix career in his late 30s. During his career, drivers raced with almost no protective equipment on circuits with no safety features. Formula One cars in the 1950s were very fast, extremely physically demanding to drive; races were much longer than today and demanded incredible physical stamina. Tyres were cross-ply, and far less forgiving; treads often stripped in a race, and [[spark plug]]s fouled. There were, of course, no electronic aids or computer intervention. At the end of a GP, drivers often suffered blistered hands, caused by heavy steering and gear changing. Despite Fangio's short career, he was one of the top GP drivers in history, rivalling [[Tazio Nuvolari]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

Fangio had no compunction about leaving a team, even after a successful year or even during a season, if he thought he would have a better chance with a better car. As was then common, several of his race results were shared with teammates after he took over their car during races when his own had technical problems. His rivals included [[Alberto Ascari]], [[Giuseppe Farina]] and [[Stirling Moss]]. Throughout his career, Fangio was backed by funding from the Argentine government of [[Juan Perón]].&lt;ref name=&quot;en.espn.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.espn.co.uk/alfaromeo/motorsport/driver/456.html|title=Juan Manuel Fangio|work=ESPN UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World championship successes===
[[File:Juan Manuel Fangio Nurburgring 1957.jpg|thumb|right|Fangio after winning the [[1957 German Grand Prix]] at the Nürburgring.]]

Fangio's first Grand Prix race was the [[1948 French Grand Prix]] at [[Reims-Gueux|Reims]], where he started his [[Gordini|Simca Gordini]] from 11th on the grid but retired. Back to South America, during a long-distance race, he went off the road in Peru and tumbled down a mountainside. His co-driver, Daniel Urrutia was thrown out of the car, and when Fangio found him, he was dying. Following Urrutia's death, he considered quitting the sport. But he resolved to carry on and returned to Europe the following year, and raced in [[Sanremo]]; having upgraded to a [[Maserati 4CL|Maserati 4CLT/48]] sponsored by the Automobile Club of Argentina he dominated the event, winning both heats to take the aggregate win by almost a minute over [[Prince Bira]]. Fangio entered a further six Grand Prix races in 1949, winning four of them against top-level opposition.&lt;ref name=&quot;grandprixhistory.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;grandprix.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/drv-fanjua.html|title=Juan-Manuel Fangio Profile - Drivers - GP Encyclopedia - F1 History on Grandprix.com|work=grandprix.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

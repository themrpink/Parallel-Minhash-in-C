In September 1943, German troops occupied Grenoble, escalating the conflict with the clandestine movements. On 11 November 1943 (the anniversary of the [[World War I|armistice of 1918]]) massive strikes and demonstrations took place in front of the local collaboration offices. In response, the occupiers arrested 400 demonstrators in the streets. On 13 November, the resistance blew up the artillery at the Polygon, which was a psychological shock for an enemy who then intensified the repression. On 25 November, the occupiers killed 11 members of the Résistance organizations of Grenoble. This violent crackdown was nicknamed &quot;Grenoble's [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre|Saint-Bartholomew]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ordredelaliberation.fr/fr_ville/grenoble.html  |title=Ordre de la Libération |date=25 February 2008 |accessdate=12 May 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080225161640/http://www.ordredelaliberation.fr/fr_ville/grenoble.html |archivedate = 25 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; From these events, Grenoble was styled by the [[Free French Forces]] the title of ''Capital of the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]]'' on the antennas of the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://theses.univ-lyon2.fr/documents/getpart.php?id=lyon2.2000.barriere_p&amp;part=11279 |title=Grenoble en concurrence avec Lyon  |publisher=Université Lyon 2 |accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This event only intensified the activities of Grenoble's resistance movements. The Germans could not prevent the destruction of their new arsenal on 2 December at the Bonne Barracks. After the [[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy landing]], resistance operations reached their peak, with numerous attacks considerably hampering the activity of German troops. With the [[Operation Dragoon|landing in Provence]], German troops evacuated the city on 22 August 1944. On 5 November 1944, General [[Charles de Gaulle]] came to Grenoble and bestowed on the city the ''[[Ordre de la Libération|Compagnon de la Libération]]'' in order to recognise &quot;a heroic city at the peak of the French resistance and combat for the liberation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ordredelaliberation.fr&quot;/&gt;

In 1955, future [[Nobel Prize in Physics|physics Nobel prize]] laureate [[Louis Néel]] created the Grenoble Center for Nuclear Studies (CENG), resulting in the birth of the Grenoble model, a combination of research and industry. The first stone was laid in December 1956.

In 1968 Grenoble hosted the [[1968 Winter Olympics|Xth Olympic Winter Games]]. This event helped modernize the city with the development of infrastructure such as an airport, motorways, a new town hall, and a new train station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.francebleu.fr/sports/sport-d-hiver-ski-biathlon/jo-de-1968-a-grenoble-la-transformation-d-une-ville-1516120348 |title=JO de 1968 à Grenoble : la transformation d'une ville |publisher=France Bleu Isère |accessdate=1 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also helped the development of ski resorts like [[Chamrousse]], [[Les Deux Alpes]], and [[Villard-de-Lans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.grenoble.fr/uploads/Externe/9f/414_688_DP-lancement-50-ans-JO.pdf |title=1968/2018 Célébration des 50 ans des Jeux Olympiques d'hiver de Grenoble |publisher=Ville de Grenoble |accessdate=1 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Moucherotte 23 12 11 092 (2) final.JPG|thumb|Grenoble with the [[Dauphiné Alps]]]]

Grenoble is surrounded by mountains. To the north lies the [[Chartreuse Mountains|Chartreuse]], to the south and west the [[Vercors Plateau|Vercors]], and to the east the [[Belledonne|Belledonne range]]. Grenoble is regarded as the capital of the French Alps.

Except for a few dozen houses on the slopes of the [[Bastille (Grenoble)|Bastille]] hill of Chartreuse, Grenoble is exclusively built on the alluvial plain of the rivers [[Isère (river)|Isère]] and [[Drac (river)|Drac]] at an altitude of {{convert|214|m|ft}}. As a result, the city itself is extremely flat. Mountain sports are an important tourist attraction in summer and winter. Twenty large and small ski resorts surround the city, the nearest being [[Le Sappey-en-Chartreuse]], which is about 15 minutes' drive away.

Historically, both Grenoble and the surrounding areas were sites of heavy industry and mining.&lt;ref&gt;''Petite histoire du Dauphiné'', Félix Vernay, 1933, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Abandoned mills and factories can be found in small towns and villages, and a few have been converted to tourist attractions, such as the coal mine at [[La Mure]].

===Climate===

Grenoble features an atypical climate that is not easy to fit into a category. Under the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen system]], Grenoble has an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb''). In spite of being classified as maritime, Grenoble contains significant seasonal differences between the warm to hot summers and the cool to cold winters. Both temperatures above {{convert|30|C|F}} for the summer months and winter [[air frost]]s are common. In addition, the climate is much gloomier than the Mediterranean region, although less so than northern France. Rainfall is quite heavy by French standards, although the number of rainy days is relatively moderate. Snowfall also occurs, although the climate of Grenoble itself is too mild to sustain a snow pack all winter, unlike the surrounding mountains. The record low of {{convert|-27.1|C|F}} decisively indicates the city's continental influence, the record being significantly colder than typical records in maritime climates. Winter nights are also colder than all other French cities of significant size. In spite of this, the weather station of [[Alpes-Isère Airport|Grenoble-St Geoirs]] is located 40&amp;nbsp;km (26&amp;nbsp;mi) away from Grenoble, and at a higher altitude. Grenoble itself has a much more continental climate than its airport due to its low altitude, in a valley.

At the entrance to the Bouchayer-Viallet site, Square des Fusillés has been redeveloped and extended taking over an old car park, to facilitate access from the tramway stop and Cours Berriat.

Redevelopment of the former De Bonne barracks was an important step in the drive to launch [[Green building|sustainable housing]] in France.

==Main sights==
[[File:La bastille.JPG|thumb|The [[Bastille (Grenoble)|Bastille]] from downtown, with the Memorial at the back, on the top of the hill]]

===La Bastille===
The [[Bastille (Grenoble)|Bastille]], an ancient series of fortifications on the mountainside, overlooks Grenoble on the northern side and is visible from many points in the city. The Bastille is one of Grenoble's most visited tourist attractions and provides a good vantage point over both the town below and the surrounding mountains.

[[File:Seilbahn-Grenoble.JPG|thumb|left|&quot;Les Bulles&quot;: the cable cars]]
The Bastille fort was begun in the [[Middle Ages]], and later centuries saw extensive additions, including a semi-underground defense network. The Bastille has been credited as the most extensive example of early 18th-century fortifications in all of France. It then held an important strategic point on the French [[Alps|Alpine]] frontier with the [[Kingdom of Savoy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bastille-grenoble.fr/english/fortifie_uk.htm |title=Bienvenue sur www.bastille-grenoble.com |publisher=Bastille-grenoble.fr |accessdate=2014-04-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510104756/http://bastille-grenoble.fr/english/fortifie_uk.htm |archive-date=10 May 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first cable transport system, installed on the Bastille in 1875, was built by the Porte de France Cement Company for freight. This cable transport system connected a quarry on Mount Jalla, just over the Bastille, and Grenoble. It was abandoned in the early 20th century.

Since 1934, the Bastille has been the destination of the &quot;[[Grenoble-Bastille cable car]]&quot;. This system of mostly transparent egg-shaped [[Aerial tramway|cable cars]] known to locals as &quot;Les Bulles&quot; (the bubbles) provides the occupants with an excellent view over the [[Isère (river)|Isère]]. At the top are two restaurants and installed in the casemates of the fort itself since June 2006, the Bastille Art Centre allows visitors to see contemporary art exhibitions. There is also a small military museum on mountain troops (''Musée des troupes de montagne'') and, since 2000, a memorial to the mountain troops (''Mémorial national des troupes de montagne'') further along the road, on top of the hill.

===Palace of the Parliament of Dauphiné===
[[File:Parlement du Dauphiné - Grenoble.JPG|thumb|Palace of the [[Parliament]] of [[Dauphiné]]]]
This renaissance palace was constructed at the Place Saint André around 1500 and extended in 1539. It was the location of the [[Parlement]] of [[Dauphiné]] until the [[French Revolution]]. It then became the Grenoble courthouse, until the courts were moved to a modern building in 2002. The left wing of the palace was extended in 1897. The front of the former seat of the nearby Dauphiné Parlement combines elements from a gothic chapel and a Renaissance façade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isere-patrimoine.fr/2676-ancien-palais-du-parlement-ancien-palais-de-justice-grenoble.htm isere patrimoine.fr] {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building now belongs to the Isère Council (Conseil Général de l'Isère). An ongoing renovation project will give this building a new life whilst preserving its patrimonial character and adding a modern touch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espace-documentaire.cg38.fr/uploads/Document/c6/WEB_CHEMIN_33335_1182845658.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013200621/http://espace-documentaire.cg38.fr/uploads/Document/c6/WEB_CHEMIN_33335_1182845658.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=13 October 2007|date=13 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum of Grenoble===
The city's most prized museum, the [[Museum of Grenoble]] (''Musée de Grenoble''), welcomes {{formatnum:200000}} visitors a year. It is primarily renowned for its extensive paintings collection, which covers all artistic evolutions. In the early 20th century the Museum of Grenoble became the first French museum to open its collections to modern art, and its collection of modern and contemporary art has grown to become one of the largest in Europe. The painting holdings include works by painters such as [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], [[Rubens]], [[Zurbarán]], [[Ingres]], [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]], [[Paul Signac|Signac]], [[Claude Monet|Monet]], [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], [[Picasso]], [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Giorgio de Chirico]] and [[Andy Warhol]]. The museum also presents a few Egyptian antiquities as well as Greek and Roman artifacts. The Sculpture collection features works by [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Matisse]], [[Alberto Giacometti]] and [[Alexander Calder]]. In April 2010, the ''prophetess of Antinoe'', a 6th-century mummy discovered in 1907 in the [[Copts|Coptic]] [[necropolis]] of [[Antinopolis|Antinoe]] in Middle Egypt, returned to the Museum of Grenoble, after more than fifty years of absence and an extensive restoration.

===Archaeological museums ===
[[File:Musée archéologique de Grenoble 027.jpg|thumb|[[Grenoble Archaeological Museum|Archaeological]] museum with the vestiges protected by a new cover of glass and metal (Place Saint-Laurent)]]

Situated on the right bank of the Isère, on Place Saint-Laurent, the [[Grenoble Archaeological Museum]] presents the archaeological excavations done on its location. The vestiges date back all the way to the 3rd century AD and provide a timeline of the history of Christianity in the region. The museum is situated below a 12th-century Benedictine church, under which [[Jacques Joseph Champollion-Figeac]], brother of famed egyptologist [[Jean-François Champollion]], discovered a Roman church in 1803. It was one of the first classified monuments in France thanks to the intervention of [[Prosper Mérimée]], historic monument inspector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musee-archeologique-grenoble.fr/ |title=Musée archéologique St Laurent |publisher=Musee-archeologique-grenoble.com |accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic excavations were conducted from 1978 to 2011, as part of a regional research program on the evolution of churches during the Middle Ages. After eight years of work, the museum reopened 6 May 2011.

The [[Musée de l'Ancien Évêché]] is the second archaeological museum of the city, and located near the [[Grenoble Cathedral]]. Installed in 1998, it houses the first baptistery of the city

The Grenoble townhall hosts a bust of Stendhal by sculptor [[Pierre Charles Lenoir]]

==Education and science==

===Secondary level===
The large community of both foreign students and foreign researchers prompted the creation of an international school. The [[Cité Scolaire Internationale de Grenoble|Cité Scolaire Internationale Europole]] (CSI Europole) was formerly housed within the ''[[Lycée Stendhal]]'' across from the ''[[Maison du Tourisme]]'', but later moved to its own building in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Europole|fr}} district. In the centre of the city, two schools have provided education to the isérois for more than three centuries. The oldest one, the [[Lycée Stendhal]], was founded in 1651&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grenoble-tourisme.com/302-patrimoine-religieux.htm |title=Tourism office - patrimoine religieux |accessdate=14 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313161033/http://www.grenoble-tourisme.com/302-patrimoine-religieux.htm |archivedate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a Jesuit College. An astronomical and astrological sundial created in the main building of the college in 1673 can still be visited today. The second-oldest higher education establishment of Grenoble is the [[Lycée Champollion]], completed in 1887 to offer excellent education to both high school students and students of preparatory classes.

===Higher education===
[[File:Domaine universitaire Grenoble.jpg|thumb|Campus of the [[Université Grenoble Alpes]].]]
The city is an important university centre with over 54,000 students in 2013, of whom 16% arrive from abroad.&lt;ref&gt;http://cache.media.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/file/Atlas_2012-2013/27/8/Atlas_1213_Web_316278.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1339 [[Papal bull|pontificial bull]], Pope [[Benedict XII]] commissioned the establishment of the [[Université Grenoble Alpes|University of Grenoble]].

In 1965, the university mostly relocated from downtown to a suburban main campus outside of the city in [[Saint-Martin-d'Hères|Saint Martin d'Hères]] (with some parts in [[Gières]]). However, smaller campuses remain both downtown and in the northwestern part of the city known as the ''[[Polygone Scientifique]]'' (&quot;Scientific Polygon&quot;).

From 1970 to 2015, the university was divided into four separate institutions sharing the campus grounds, some buildings and laboratories, and even part of their administration:
* Grenoble&amp;nbsp;I – [[Joseph Fourier University]] (sciences, health, technologies)
* Grenoble&amp;nbsp;II – [[Pierre Mendès-France University]] (social sciences)
** which includes the [[Institut d'études politiques de Grenoble|Institute of political studies]]
* Grenoble&amp;nbsp;III – [[Stendhal University]] (humanities)
* [[Grenoble Institute of Technology]] (INPG or Grenoble-INP) is a federation of engineering colleges.

On 1 January 2016, the first three of those merged back to form the [[Université Grenoble Alpes]].

Grenoble is a major scientific centre, especially in the fields of [[physics]], [[computer science]], and [[applied mathematics]]: [[Joseph Fourier University|Universite Joseph Fourier]] (UJF) is one of the leading French scientific universities while the Grenoble Institute of Technology trains more than 5,000 engineers every year in key technology disciplines. Grenoble's high tech expertise is organized mainly around three domains: information technology, biotechnologies and new technologies of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grenoble.fr/176-poles-de-competitivite.htm|title=Pôles de compétitivité|publisher=Mairie de Grenoble|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819111320/http://www.grenoble.fr/176-poles-de-competitivite.htm|archivedate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many fundamental and applied scientific research laboratories are conjointly managed by Joseph Fourier University, Grenoble Institute of Technology, and the French ''[[French National Centre for Scientific Research|National Centre for Scientific Research]]'' (CNRS). Numerous other scientific laboratories are managed independently or in collaboration with the CNRS and the French ''[[Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique|National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control]]'' (INRIA).

Other research centres in or near Grenoble include the [[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility]] (ESRF), the [[Institut Laue-Langevin]] (ILL), the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] (EMBL), the [[Institut de radioastronomie millimétrique]], one of the main research facilities of the [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique|Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique]] (Nuclear Energy Commission, CEA), the [[LNCMI]] and the European branch of [[Xerox|Xerox Research]] (whose most notable center was [[PARC (company)|PARC]]). [[CEA-Leti: Laboratoire d'électronique des technologies de l'information|Leti]] and the recent development of [[Minatec]], a centre for innovation in micro- and nano-technology, only increases Grenoble's position as a European scientific centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minatec.com/minatec_uk/index.htm |title=See official website |accessdate=2009-05-26 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229114700/http://www.minatec.com/minatec_uk/index.htm |archivedate=29 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biotechnologies are also well represented in the Grenoble region with the molecular biology research center [[BioMérieux]], the [[Clinatec]] center, the regional center NanoBio and many ramifications of the global competitiveness cluster Lyonbiopôle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drt-cea.com/GIANT.htm drt-cea.com, GIANT, CAMPUS D'INNOVATION À GRENOBLE] {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Grenoble has large laboratories related to space and to the understanding and observation of the universe as the [[Institut de radioastronomie millimétrique]], the [[Institut de planétologie et d'astrophysique de Grenoble]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/decouverte/sciences/espace/rosetta?r=alpes|title=La mission de la sonde Rosetta prolongée jusqu'en septembre 2016 |publisher=francetvinfo.fr|date=2015-06-29 |accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Laboratoire de physique subatomique et de cosmologie de Grenoble]], the [[Institut Néel]] but also to a lesser extent the [[Institut des sciences de la Terre]] (part of the [[Observatoire des Sciences de l'Univers de Grenoble]]).

In order to foster this technological cluster university institutions and research organizations united to create the GIANT (Grenoble Innovation for Advanced New Technologies) Campus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giant-grenoble.org/giant-grenoble-innovation-for-advanced-new-technologies-280947.kjsp?RH=GIANT_EN&amp;RF=GIANT_EN |title=Official website of the GIANT Innovation Campus |publisher=Giant-grenoble.org |accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim at becoming one of the world's top campuses in research, higher education, and high tech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.grenoble-em.com/giant-innovation-campus |title=Official website of Grenoble École de Management |publisher=http://en.grenoble-em.com |accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city benefits from the highest concentration of strategic jobs in France after Paris, with 14% of the employments, 35,186 jobs, 45% of which specialized in design and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?ref_id=ip1278 |title=Insee – Territoire – Répartition géographique des emplois – Les grandes villes concentrent les fonctions intellectuelles, de gestion et de décision |publisher=Insee.fr |accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grenoble is also the largest research center in France after Paris with 22,800 jobs (11,800 in public research, 7,500 in private research and 3,500 PhD students).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grenoble-isere.com/fre/layout/set/print/content/download/8452/75437/version/2/file/AEPI-mementos+FR-pap.pdf |title=Chiffres clés Grenoble-Isère édition 2011 |publisher=AEPI |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112211607/http://www.grenoble-isere.com/fre/layout/set/print/content/download/8452/75437/version/2/file/AEPI-mementos+FR-pap.pdf |archive-date=12 January 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grenoble is also renowned for the excellence of its academic research in humanities and political sciences. Its universities, alongside public scientific institutions, host some of the largest research centres in France (in fields such as political science, urban planning or the [[sociology of organizations]]).

=== Knowledge and innovation community ===

Grenoble is one of the co-location centres of the [[European Institute of Innovation and Technology]]'s Knowledge and Innovation Communities for [[sustainable energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eit.europa.eu/home.html |title=European Institute of Innovation and Technology: Home |work=Europa (web portal) |accessdate=12 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328175502/http://eit.europa.eu/home.html |archivedate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Industry occupies a large part of the local economy. High-tech industries have a significant presence, especially in the field of semiconductors, electronics and [[biotechnology]]. [[STMicroelectronics]], [[Schneider Electric]] and [[Soitec]] have major manufacturing and R&amp;D facilities. Traditional industries in fields such as heavy equipment manufacturing and chemistry are still present and include [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]], [[GE Renewable Energy]] and [[Arkema]].

The town was once famous for [[glove]] manufacturing, for which {{Interlanguage link multi|Xavier Jouvin|fr}} introduced an innovative technique in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;A. Doyon, Xavier Jouvin, inventeur grenoblois et sa famille, Paris, Dayez ed., 1976&lt;/ref&gt; A few small companies keep producing gloves for a very high end market.

The presence of companies such as HP or Caterpillar in the area has drawn many American and British workers to Grenoble, especially in the surrounding mountain villages. The region has the second largest English-speaking community in France, after Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comptable-grenoble.com/comptable/comptabilite/4-grenoble-meylan.html |title=Comptable à Grenoble, Isère (38) |publisher=Comptable-grenoble.com |accessdate=29 October 2009 }}{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; That community has an English-speaking Church and supports the International School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanschoolgrenoble.com/|title=American School of Grenoble ASG home page|website=americanschoolgrenoble.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these Americans, British, Australians etc. go to Grenoble with the intention of returning home after some time but the mountains and general life style often keep them there. Some choose to put their children in the international school &quot;cité internationale&quot;, while the &quot;American School of Grenoble&quot; is the alternative for those who prefer to have the core curriculum in English. With numerous associations like Open House, this large English speaking population organizes family events making life in Grenoble harder to turn away from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grenoble, France's Second Largest English Speaking Community|url=http://speakenglishcenter.com/en/grenoble-frances-second-largest-english-speaki |accessdate=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

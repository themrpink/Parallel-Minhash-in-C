Many isotopes are produced in [[cyclotron]]s, for example [[fluorine-18]] and [[oxygen-15]] which are widely used for [[positron emission tomography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cyclotron Produced Radionuclides: Physical Characteristics and Production Methods|date=2009|publisher=IAEA|location=Vienna|isbn=978-92-0-106908-5|url=https://www-pub.iaea.org/books/iaeabooks/7892/Cyclotron-Produced-Radionuclides-Physical-Characteristics-and-Production-Methods}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Most synthetic radioisotopes have a short [[half-life]]. Though a health hazard, radioactive materials have many medical and industrial uses.

===Nuclear medicine===
The field of [[nuclear medicine]] covers use of radioisotopes for diagnosis or treatment.

====Diagnosis====
Radioactive tracer compounds, [[radiopharmaceutical]]s, are used to observe the function of various organs and body systems. These compounds use a chemical tracer which is attracted to or concentrated by the activity which is being studied. That chemical tracer incorporates a short lived radioactive isotope, usually one which emits a [[gamma ray]] which is energetic enough to travel through the body and be captured outside by a [[gamma camera]] to map the concentrations. [[Gamma camera]]s and other similar detectors are highly efficient, and the tracer compounds are generally very effective at concentrating at the areas of interest, so the total amounts of radioactive material needed are very small.

The metastable [[nuclear isomer]] Tc-99m is a [[gamma-ray]] emitter widely used for medical diagnostics because it has a short half-life of 6 hours, but can be easily made in the hospital using a [[technetium-99m generator]]. Weekly global demand for the parent isotope [[molybdenum-99]] was {{convert|12000|Ci|TBq|lk=out|order=flip|abbr=on}} in 2010, overwhelmingly provided by fission of [[uranium-235]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Production and Supply of Molybdenum-99|url=https://www.iaea.org/About/Policy/GC/GC54/GC54InfDocuments/English/gc54inf-3-att7_en.pdf|publisher=IAEA|accessdate=4 March 2018|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treatment====
Several radioisotopes and compounds are used for [[Unsealed source radiotherapy|medical treatment]], usually by bringing the radioactive isotope to a high concentration in the body near a particular organ. For example, [[iodine]]-131 is used for treating some disorders and tumors of the [[thyroid]] gland.

===Industrial radiation sources===
{{Expand section|date=July 2017}}
[[Alpha particle]], [[beta particle]], and [[gamma ray]] radioactive emissions are industrially useful. Most sources of these are synthetic radioisotopes. Areas of use include the [[Uses of radioactivity in oil and gas wells|petroleum industry]], [[industrial radiography]], [[homeland security]], [[process control]], [[food irradiation]] and underground detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenblatt|first1=Jack A.|title=Stable and Radioactive Isotopes: Industry &amp; Trade Summary|url=https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/ITS-1.pdf|website=Office of Industries|publisher=United States International Trade Commission|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rivard|first1=Mark J.|last2=Bobek|first2=Leo M.|last3=Butler|first3=Ralph A.|last4=Garland|first4=Marc A.|last5=Hill|first5=David J.|last6=Krieger|first6=Jeanne K.|last7=Muckerheide|first7=James B.|last8=Patton|first8=Brad D.|last9=Silberstein|first9=Edward B.|title=The US national isotope program: Current status and strategy for future success|journal=Applied Radiation and Isotopes|date=August 2005|volume=63|issue=2|pages=157–178|doi=10.1016/j.apradiso.2005.03.004|url=https://www.isotopes.gov/outreach/reports/Rivard.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Branch|first1=Doug|title=Radioactive Isotopes in Process Measurement|url=https://www.controlglobal.com/assets/12WPpdf/121105-vega-isotopes-measurement.pdf|publisher=VEGA Controls|accessdate=4 March 2018|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="3516" xml:space="preserve">A '''trace radioisotope''' is a [[radioisotope]] that occurs naturally in trace amounts (i.e. extremely small). Generally speaking, trace radioisotopes have [[half-lives]] that are short in comparison with the [[age of the Earth]], since [[primordial nuclide]]s tend to occur in larger than trace amounts. Trace radioisotopes are therefore present only because they are continually produced on Earth by natural processes. Natural processes which produce trace radioisotopes include [[cosmic ray]] bombardment of stable nuclides, ordinary [[alpha decay|alpha]] and [[beta decay]] of the long-lived heavy nuclides, [[Thorium Series|thorium-232]], [[Radium series#Radium series .28aka Uranium series.29|uranium-238]], and [[Decay chain#Actinium series|uranium-235]], [[spontaneous fission]] of [[uranium-238]], and [[nuclear transmutation]] reactions induced by [[natural radioactivity]], such as the production of [[plutonium-239]]&lt;ref name = &quot;Cigar&quot;&gt;

'''''Ad gentes''''' is the [[Second Vatican Council|Second Vatican Council's]] decree on missionary activity. The title is [[Latin]] for &quot;To the Nations,&quot; and is from the first line of the decree, as is customary with [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] documents.  It establishes [[evangelization]] as one of the fundamental missions of the Catholic Church and reaffirms the tie between evangelization and charity for the [[Poverty|poor]]. Ad Gentes also calls for the formation of strong Christian communities as well as strong relations with other Christians. Finally, it lays out guidelines for the training and actions of the missionaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ad Gentes (Decree on the Mission Activity of the Church)|newspaper=Berkley Center for Religion, Peace &amp; World Affairs, Georgetown University|url=https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/publications/ad-gentes-decree-on-the-mission-activity-of-the-church|access-date=2018-04-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413190437/https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/publications/ad-gentes-decree-on-the-mission-activity-of-the-church|archive-date=2018-04-13|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conciliar vote==
Passed by assembled bishops by a vote of 2,394 to 5, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965.

==Inculturation==
{{main|Inculturation}}
''Ad gentes'' focused on the factors involved in mission work. It called for the continued development of missionary acculturation. It encourages missionaries to live with the people they are attempting to convert, to absorb their ways and culture. It encourages the coordination of mission work through agencies and the cooperation with other groups and organizations within the Catholic Church and other denominations.

==Contents==
''The numbers given correspond to the section numbers within the text.''

=== Preface (1) ===
* &quot;Divinely sent to the nations of the world to be unto them “a universal sacrament of salvation,” the Church, driven by the inner necessity of her own catholicity, and obeying the mandate of her Founder (cf. Mark 16:16), strives ever to proclaim the Gospel to all men. The Apostles themselves, on whom the Church was founded, following in the footsteps of Christ, “preached the word of truth and begot churches.” It is the duty of their successors to make this task endure “so that the word of God may run and be glorified (2 Thess. 3:1) and the kingdom of God be proclaimed and established throughout the world.&quot;
=== 1. Principles of Doctrine (2-9) ===
* &quot;The pilgrim Church is missionary by her very nature, since it is from the mission of the Son and the mission of the Holy Spirit that she draws her origin, in accordance with the decree of God the Father.&quot; (Para 2)
* &quot;The chief means of the planting referred to is the preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. To preach this Gospel the Lord sent forth His disciples into the whole world, that being reborn by the word of God (cf. 1 Peter 1:23), men might be joined to the Church through baptism—that Church which, as the body of the Word Incarnate, is nourished and lives by the word of God and by the eucharistic bread (cf. Acts 2:43)&quot; (6)
* &quot;And so the time for missionary activity extends between the first coming of the Lord and the second, in which latter the Church will be gathered from the four winds like a harvest into the kingdom of God. For the Gospel must be preached to all nations before the Lord shall come (cf. Mark 13:10).&quot; (Para 9)

=== 2. Mission Work Itself 10-18) ===
&quot;The Church, sent by Christ to reveal and to communicate the love of God to all men and nations, is aware that there still remains a gigantic missionary task for her to accomplish.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Ad Gentes 10: Decree on the Mission Activity of the Church: Ad Gentes. In Vatican II Documents Libreria Editrice Vaticana, Vatican City, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;
==== Christian Witness (11-12) ====
==== Presenting the Gospel and Gathering Together the People of God (13-14) ====
==== Forming a Christian Community (15-18) ====

The Holy Spirit gathers the people of God to be &quot;a chose race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a purchased people&quot; (1 Peter 2:9)).

Christian community is a sign of God's presence in the world.

Nourished by the Word of God and the Eucharist, Christian community bears witness to Christ, walks in charity and is fervent with apostolic spirit.

Christian community exists in the context of family, parish and diocese as well as in the religious life.

=== 3. Particular Churches (19-22) ===
* &quot;The church has not been really founded, and is not yet fully alive, nor is it a perfect sign of Christ among men, unless there is a laity worthy of the name working along with the hierarchy.&quot; (21)

The church is not first the clergy; it is first of all the whole people of God. Believers share a oneness and a baptismal equality that precedes the distinctions among different roles in the community.&lt;ref&gt;
Hahnenberg, Edward P. . A Concise Guide to the Documents of Vatican II (Kindle Locations 878-881). St. Anthony Messenger Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 4. Missionaries (23-27) ===

=== 5. Planning Missionary Activity (28-34) ===
=== 6. Cooperation (35-41) ===
This chapter's asserts that every member of the Body of Christ has an obligation to help the body grow.  Bishops (AG 38), priests (AG 39), religious (AG 40), and laity (AG 41) all play a role. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hahnenberg|first1=Edward P|title=A Concise Guide to the Documents of Vatican II|date=2011|publisher=St. Anthony Messenger Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later documents==
Since the time of the Council, there have been concerns of the part of Church authorities that the missional spirit of the Church has been fading away because of the acceptance of [[anonymous Christianity]], a teaching of [[Karl Rahner]] that all human beings have an implicit knowledge of Jesus Christ. As a result, several Church documents have been written in order to encourage more [[evangelism]].

''[[Evangelii nuntiandi]]'' is an [[apostolic exhortation]] issued on 8 December 1975 by Pope [[Paul VI]] following the work of the synod on the theme (of 7 September 1974 to 26 October 1980) . It deals with evangelism, and affirms the role of every Christian (and not only ordained priests) in spreading the Catholic religion.

''[[Redemptoris Missio]]'', subtitled &quot;On the permanent validity of the Church's missionary mandate&quot;, is a [[papal encyclical]] by Pope John Paul II published on 7 December 1990, devoted to the subject of &quot;the urgency of missionary activity&quot; and in which he wished &quot;to invite the Church to renew her missionary commitment.  

In 2007, the Holy See reaffirmed the duty of Catholics to evangelize members of other religions, and this was largely interpreted as a clarification of ''[[Lumen gentium]]'', against the statements of liberals and others claiming that Christian proselytism had become historically and politically outmoded.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20071203_nota-evangelizzazione_en.html Doctrinal note on some aspects of evangelization, The Vatican, Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Pope Francis]] published ''[[Evangelii gaudium]]'' as an [[apostolic exhortation]] and challenged the faithful to live in accordance with &quot;missionary impulse&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://focusoncampus.org/content/a-summary-of-evangelii-gaudium-joy-of-the-gospel-pope-francis-first-apostolic-exhortation-5e45c0fa-331b-48dd-a872-22a27bb48a51 A Summary of Evangelii Gaudium (Joy of the Gospel): Pope Francis' First Apostolic Exhortation]&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of [[Lumen Gentium]], [[Ad Gentes]] and later documents has been the Church initiative for [[New Evangelization]] in the [[3rd millennium|Third Millennium]].

George was born on 24 May in the Old Style [[Julian calendar]] used in Great Britain until 1752.}}{{spnd}}29 January 1820) was [[List of British monarchs|King of Great Britain]] and [[King of Ireland]] from 25 October 1760 until [[Acts of Union 1800|the union of the two countries]] on 1 January 1801, after which he was King of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] until his death in 1820. He was concurrently Duke and [[Prince-elector]] of [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Brunswick-Lüneburg (&quot;Hanover&quot;)]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] before becoming [[King of Hanover]] on 12 October 1814. He was a monarch of the [[House of Hanover]], but unlike his two predecessors, he was born in Great Britain, spoke English as his first language,&lt;ref name=&quot;rh&quot;&gt;{{cite web|website=Official website of the British monarchy|publisher=Royal Household|accessdate=18 April 2016|title=George III|url=https://www.royal.uk/george-iii-r-1760-1820|date=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and never visited Hanover.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 314; Fraser, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;

George's life and reign, which were longer than those of any of his predecessors, were marked by a series of military conflicts involving his kingdoms, much of the rest of Europe, and places farther afield in Africa, the Americas, and Asia. Early in his reign, Great Britain defeated France in the [[Seven Years' War]], becoming the dominant European power in North America and India. However, many of Britain's American colonies were soon lost in the [[American War of Independence]]. Further wars against [[French Revolution|revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic France]] from 1793 concluded in the defeat of [[Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815.

In the later part of his life, George had recurrent, and eventually permanent, [[mental illness]]. Although it has since been suggested that he had [[bipolar disorder]] or the blood disease [[porphyria]], the cause of his illness remains unknown. After a final relapse in 1810, a [[Regency era|regency]] was established. His eldest son, [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George, Prince of Wales]], ruled as [[Prince Regent]] until his father's death, when he succeeded as George IV. Historical analysis of George III's life has gone through a &quot;kaleidoscope of changing views&quot; that have depended heavily on the prejudices of his biographers and the sources available to them.&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

George was born in London at [[Norfolk House]] in [[St James's Square]]. He was the grandson of [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]], and the eldest son of [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]], and [[Augusta of Saxe-Gotha]]. As he was born two months prematurely and thought unlikely to survive, he was baptised the same day by [[Thomas Secker]], who was both Rector of [[St James's Church, Piccadilly|St James's]] and [[Bishop of Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
One month later, he was publicly baptised at Norfolk House, again by Secker. His godparents were King [[Frederick I of Sweden]] (for whom [[Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore|Lord Baltimore]] stood proxy), his uncle [[Frederick III, Duke of Saxe-Gotha]] (for whom [[Henry Brydges, 2nd Duke of Chandos|Lord Carnarvon]] stood proxy), and his great-aunt [[Sophia Dorothea, Queen in Prussia]] (for whom [[James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton#Marriage and issue|Lady Charlotte Edwin]] stood proxy).&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=7712|date=20 June 1738|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince George grew into a healthy, reserved and shy child. The family moved to [[Leicester Square]], where George and his younger brother [[Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany]], were educated together by private tutors. Family letters show that he could read and write in both English and German, as well as comment on political events of the time, by the age of eight.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, pp. 23–41&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first British monarch to study science systematically. Apart from chemistry and physics, his lessons included astronomy, mathematics, French, Latin, history, music, geography, commerce, agriculture and constitutional law, along with sporting and social accomplishments such as dancing, fencing, and riding. His religious education was wholly [[Anglican]].&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, pp. 42–44, 55&lt;/ref&gt; At age 10, George took part in a family production of [[Joseph Addison]]'s play ''[[Cato, a Tragedy|Cato]]'' and said in the new prologue: &quot;What, tho' a boy! It may with truth be said, A boy in ''England'' born, in England bred.&quot;&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Historian [[Romney Sedgwick]] argued that these lines appear &quot;to be the source of the only historical phrase with which he is associated&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sedgwick, pp. ix–x&lt;/ref&gt;

King George II disliked the Prince of Wales and took little interest in his grandchildren. However, in 1751 the Prince died unexpectedly from a lung injury at the age of 44, and his son George became [[heir apparent]] to the throne and inherited his father's title of [[Duke of Edinburgh]]. Now more interested in his grandson, three weeks later the King created George [[Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=9050|date=16 April 1751|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 3–15&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1756, as George approached his eighteenth birthday, the King offered him a grand establishment at [[St James's Palace]], but George refused the offer, guided by his mother and her confidant, [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]], who would later serve as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, pp. 51–52; Hibbert, pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; George's mother, now the [[Dowager]] Princess of Wales, preferred to keep George at home where she could imbue him with her strict moral values.&lt;ref&gt;Bullion, John L.

==Marriage==
In 1759, George was smitten with [[Lady Sarah Lennox]], sister of [[Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond]], but Lord Bute advised against the match and George abandoned his thoughts of marriage. &quot;I am born for the happiness or misery of a great nation,&quot; he wrote, &quot;and consequently must often act contrary to my passions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 54; Brooke, pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, attempts by the King to marry George to [[Princess Sophie Caroline of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]] were resisted by him and his mother;&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 36–37; Brooke, p. 49; Hibbert, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Sophie married [[Frederick, Margrave of Bayreuth]], instead.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, at the age of 22, George succeeded to the throne when his grandfather, George II, died suddenly on 25 October 1760, two weeks before his 77th birthday. The search for a suitable wife intensified. On 8 September 1761 in the [[Chapel Royal]], [[St James's Palace]], the King married Princess [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]], whom he met on their wedding day.{{efn|George was falsely said to have married a [[Quakers|Quakeress]] named [[Hannah Lightfoot]] on 17 April 1759, prior to his marriage to Charlotte, and to have had at least one child by her. However, Lightfoot had married Isaac Axford in 1753, and had died in or before 1759, so there could have been no legal marriage or children. The jury at the 1866 trial of [[Lavinia Ryves]], the daughter of imposter [[Olivia Serres]] who pretended to be &quot;Princess Olive of Cumberland&quot;, unanimously found that a supposed marriage certificate produced by Ryves was a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C5895849 Documents relating to the case]. [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]. Retrieved 14 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}} A fortnight later on 22 September, both were crowned at [[Westminster Abbey]]. George remarkably never took a mistress (in contrast with his grandfather and his sons), and the couple enjoyed a happy marriage until his mental illness struck.&lt;ref name=&quot;rh&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{cite ODNB|first=John|last=Cannon|title=George III (1738–1820)|date=September 2004|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10540|accessdate=29 October 2008|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/10540}} (Subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; They had 15 children—nine sons and six daughters. In 1762, George purchased Buckingham House (on the site now occupied by [[Buckingham Palace]]) for use as a family retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 85–87&lt;/ref&gt; His other residences were [[Kew Palace]] and [[Windsor Castle]]. St James's Palace was retained for official use. He did not travel extensively and spent his entire life in southern England. In the 1790s, the King and his family took holidays at [[Weymouth, Dorset]],&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 378; Cannon and Griffiths, p. 518&lt;/ref&gt; which he thus popularised as one of the first seaside resorts in England.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 549&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early reign==
{{further|Great Britain in the Seven Years' War}}
George, in his accession speech to Parliament, proclaimed: &quot;Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name of Britain.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 612&lt;/ref&gt; He inserted this phrase into the speech, written by [[Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke|Lord Hardwicke]], to demonstrate his desire to distance himself from his German forebears, who were perceived as caring more for Hanover than for Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 156; Simms and Riotte, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Optical axis en.png|thumb|300px|Optical axis (coincides with red ray) and rays symmetrical to optical axis (pair of blue and pair of green rays) propagating through different lenses.]]
An '''optical axis''' is a line along which there is some degree of [[rotational symmetry]] in an [[optics|optical]] system such as a [[camera lens]] or [[microscope]]. 

The optical axis is an imaginary line that defines the path along which light propagates through the system, up to first approximation. For a system composed of simple [[lens (optics)|lenses]] and [[mirror]]s, the axis passes through the center of curvature of each surface, and coincides with the axis of [[rotational symmetry]]. The optical axis is often coincident with the system's mechanical axis, but not always, as in the case of [[off-axis optical system]]s.

For an [[optical fiber]], the optical axis is along the center of the [[fiber core]], and is also known as the ''fiber axis''.

{{Optical disc authoring}}
In [[computing]] and [[optical disc recording technologies]], an '''optical disc''' ('''OD''') is a flat, usually circular &lt;!-- don't forget business card CDs or whatever they are called before you go deleting this --&gt; disc that encodes binary data ([[bit]]s) in the form of [[Compact disk#Physical details|pit]]s and lands (where a change from pit to land or from land to pit corresponds to a binary value of ''1''; while no change, regardless whether in land or pit area, corresponds to binary value of ''0'') on a special material (often [[aluminum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adedeji|first=Dr. Adewole|title=COMBATING PIRACY THROUGH OPTICAL DISC PLANT REGULATION IN NIGERIA: PROSPECTS AND CHALLENGES|url=http://www.nials-nigeria.org/journals/Wole%20Adedejinjip.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822161652/http://www.nials-nigeria.org/journals/Wole%20Adedejinjip.pdf|archive-date=2013-08-22|access-date=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) on one of its flat surfaces. 

== Design and technology ==
The encoding material sits atop a thicker substrate (usually [[polycarbonate]]) that makes up the bulk of the disc and forms a dust defocusing layer. The encoding pattern follows a continuous, spiral path covering the entire disc surface and extending from the innermost track to the outermost track. 

The data are stored on the disc with a [[laser]] or stamping machine, and can be accessed when the data path is illuminated with a [[laser diode]] in an [[optical disc drive]] that spins the disc at speeds of about 200 to 4,000 [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]] or more, depending on the drive type, disc format, and the distance of the read head from the center of the disc (outer tracks are read at a higher data speed due to higher [[constant linear velocity|linear velocities]] at the same [[constant angular velocity|angular velocities]]). 

Most optical discs exhibit a characteristic [[iridescence]] as a result of the [[diffraction grating]] formed by its grooves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kinoshita-2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kinoshita|first1=edited by Shuichi|title=Pattern formations and oscillatory phenomena|date=2013|publisher=Elsevier|location=Waltham|isbn=978-0-12-397014-5|page=240|edition=Online-Ausg.|doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-397014-5.00006-7|chapter=6.5.2 Diffraction Grating}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornwall-1993&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cornwall|first1=Malcolm G|title=CD means Colourful Diffraction|journal=Physics Education|date=January 1993|volume=28|issue=1|pages=12–14|doi=10.1088/0031-9120/28/1/002|bibcode=1993PhyEd..28...12C}}&lt;/ref&gt; This side of the disc contains the actual data and is typically coated with a transparent material, usually [[lacquer]]. 

The reverse side of an optical disc usually has a printed label, sometimes made of paper but often printed or stamped onto the disc itself. Unlike the 3{{frac|1|2}}-inch [[floppy disk]], most optical discs do not have an integrated protective casing and are therefore susceptible to data transfer problems due to scratches, fingerprints, and other environmental problems. Blu-rays have a coating called [[durabis]] that mitigates these problems. 

Optical discs are usually between 7.6 and 30 cm (3 to 12 in) in diameter, with 12 cm (4.75 in) being the most common size. The so-called ''program area'' that contains the data commonly starts 25 millimetres away from the center point.&lt;ref name=OD-Diameter&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docplayer.es/74808946-Fundamentos-de-hardware.html|title=FUNDAMENTOS DE HARDWARE. - PDF Free Download|website=docplayer.es}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical disc is about 1.2 mm (0.05 in) thick, while the track pitch (distance from the center of one track to the center of the next) ranges from 1.6 [[micrometre|μm]] (for [[Compact disc|CDs]]) to 320 [[nanometre|nm]] (for [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray discs]]).

=== Recording types ===
An optical disc is designed to support one of three recording types: read-only (e.g.: CD and [[CD-ROM]]), recordable (write-once, e.g. [[CD-R]]), or re-recordable (rewritable, e.g. [[CD-RW]]). Write-once optical discs commonly have an organic dye (may also be a ([[Phthalocyanine]]) [[Azo dye]], mainly used by [[Verbatim (brand)|Verbatim]], or an oxonol dye, used by [[Fujifilm]]&lt;ref name=&quot;auto4&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.fujifilm.com/products/storage/pdf/fujifilm_datamedia_catalog_dvd_01.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2020-04-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180714050219/http://www.fujifilm.com/products/storage/pdf/fujifilm_datamedia_catalog_dvd_01.pdf |archive-date=2018-07-14 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;) recording layer between the substrate and the reflective layer. Rewritable discs typically contain an [[alloy]] recording layer composed of a [[phase change material]], most often [[AgInSbTe]], an alloy of [[silver]], [[indium]], [[antimony]], and [[tellurium]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pctechguide.com/33CDR-RW_CD-RW.htm Guides/Storage/CD-R/CD-RW – PC Technology Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330222151/http://www.pctechguide.com/33CDR-RW_CD-RW.htm |date=2009-03-30 }}. Pctechguide.com (1999-02-22). Retrieved on 2011-10-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Azo dyes were introduced in 1996 and phthalocyanine only began to see wide use in 2002. The type of dye and the material used on the reflective layer on an optical disc may be determined by shining a light through the disc, as different dye and material combinations have different colors. 

[[Blu-ray Disc recordable]] discs do not usually use an organic dye recording layer, instead using an inorganic recording layer. Those that do are known as low-to-high (LTH) discs and can be made in existing CD and DVD production lines, but are of lower quality than traditional Blu-ray recordable discs.

=== Usage ===
Optical discs are most commonly used for [[digital preservation]], storing music (e.g. for use in a [[Compact Disc player|CD player]]), video (e.g. for use in a [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] player), or data and programs for [[personal computer]]s (PC). The [[Optical Storage Technology Association]] (OSTA) promotes standardized [[optical storage]] formats. Although optical discs are more durable than earlier audio-visual and data storage formats, they are susceptible to environmental and daily-use damage. Libraries and archives enact [[optical media preservation]] procedures to ensure continued usability in the computer's optical disc drive or corresponding disc player.

For computer data backup and physical data transfer, optical discs such as CDs and [[DVD]]s are gradually being replaced with faster, smaller solid-state devices, especially the [[USB flash drive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NyXU3KBCdMcC&amp;q=For+computer+data+backup+and+physical+data+transfer,+optical+discs+such+as+CDs+and+DVDs+are+gradually+being+replaced+with+faster,+smaller+solid-state+devices,+especially+the+USB+flash+drive&amp;pg=PA193|title=An Introduction to Lasers Theory and Applications|last=Avadhanulu|first=M.

Additionally, music, movies, games, software and TV shows purchased, shared or streamed over the Internet has significantly reduced the number of audio CDs, video DVDs and Blu-ray discs sold annually. However, audio CDs and Blu-rays are still preferred and bought by some, as a way of supporting their favorite works while getting something tangible in return and also since audio CDs (alongside [[vinyl record]]s and [[cassette tape]]s) contain uncompressed audio without the artifacts introduced by [[lossy compression]] algorithms like [[MP3]],&lt;!--and FLAC files are hard to find--&gt; and Blu-rays offer better image and sound quality than streaming media, without visible compression artifacts, due to higher bitrates and more available storage space. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.reviewgeek.com/6416/is-it-better-to-watch-a-4k-movie-on-blu-ray-or-through-streaming/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200412125930/https://www.reviewgeek.com/6416/is-it-better-to-watch-a-4k-movie-on-blu-ray-or-through-streaming/ |date=2020-04-12 }} (For streaming 4K content, streaming media provider Netflix recommends a 25Mbps internet connection, suggesting a 25Mbit/s bitrate. https://help.netflix.com/en/node/306 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200411122511/https://help.netflix.com/en/node/306 |date=2020-04-11 }} The 2018 [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]] optical disc specification, in comparison, allows for bitrates from 72 to 144Mbit/s for 4K content http://www.blu-raydisc.com/Assets/Downloadablefile/White_Paper_General_5th_20180216.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; However, Blu-rays may sometimes be [[BitTorrent|torrented]] over the internet, but torrenting may not be an option for some, due to restrictions put in place by [[ISP]]s on legal or copyright grounds, low download speeds or not having enough available storage space, since the content may weigh up to several dozen gigabytes. Blu-rays may be the only option for those looking to play large games without having to download them over an unreliable or slow internet connection, which is the reason why they are still (as of 2020) widely used by gaming consoles, like the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One X]]. As of 2020, it is unusual for PC games to be available in a physical format like Blu-ray.

Discs should not have any stickers and should not be stored together with paper; papers must be removed from the jewel case before storage. Discs should be handled by the edges to prevent scratching, with the thumb on the inner edge of the disc. The ISO Standard 18938:2008 is about best optical disc handling techniques. Optical disc cleaning should never be done in a circular pattern, to avoid concentric cirles from forming on the disc. Improper cleaning can scratch the disc. Recordable discs should not be exposed to light for extended periods of time. Optical discs should be stored in dry and cool conditions to increase longevity, with temperatures between -10 and 23°C, never exceeding 32°C, and with humidity never falling below 10%, with recommended storage at 20 to 50% of humidity without fluctuations of more than ±10%.

[[Image:Lichttonorgelversuchsscheibe.jpg|thumb|An earlier analog optical disc recorded in 1935 for [[:de:Lichttonorgel|Lichttonorgel]] (sampling organ)]]
{{Original research|date=July 2009}} &lt;!-- those &quot;generations&quot; are very dubious and can probably not be found in any other reference work --&gt;

The first recorded historical use of an optical disc was in 1884 when [[Alexander Graham Bell]], [[Chichester Bell]] and [[Charles Sumner Tainter]] recorded sound on a glass disc using a beam of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsdesk.si.edu/releases/playback-130-year-old-sounds-revealed|title=Playback: 130-Year-Old Sounds Revealed - Newsdesk|website=newsdesk.si.edu|access-date=3 May 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930085522/http://newsdesk.si.edu/releases/playback-130-year-old-sounds-revealed|archive-date=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Optophonie is a very early (1931) example of a recording device using light for both recording and playing back sound signals on a transparent photograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.radiomuseum.org/forumdata/users/5100/Funkschau_4Jg_0131_1v1_v20.pdf|title=Das Photo als Schalplatte|language=de|access-date=2020-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An early optical disc system existed in 1935, named [[:de:Lichttonorgel|Lichttonorgel]].{{fact|date=November 2016}}

An early analog optical disc used for video recording was invented by [[David Paul Gregg]] in 1958&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milster|first=Tom D. |title=Optical Data Storage|citeseerx = 10.1.1.92.6992|publisher=The Pennsylvania State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; and patented in the US in 1961 and 1969. This form of optical disc was a very early form of the DVD  &lt;!--the DVD was developed from Greggs version rather than the earlier optical discs --&gt;({{US Patent|3,430,966}}). It is of special interest that {{US Patent|4,893,297}}, filed 1989, issued 1990, generated [[royalty income]] for Pioneer Corporation's DVA until 2007 —then encompassing the CD, [[DVD]], and Blu-ray systems. In the early 1960s, the Music Corporation of America bought Gregg's patents and his company, [[Gauss Electrophysics]].

American inventor [[James Russell (inventor)|James T. Russell]] has been credited with inventing the first system to record a digital signal on an optical transparent foil that is lit from behind by a high-power halogen lamp. Russell's patent application was first filed in 1966 and he was granted a patent in 1970. Following litigation, Sony and Philips licensed Russell's patents (then held by a Canadian company, Optical Recording Corp.) in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dudley|first=Brier|date=2004-11-29|title=Scientist's invention was let go for a song|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|url=https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=20041129&amp;slug=cdman29|url-status=live|access-date=2014-07-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810225444/http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2002103322_cdman29.html|archive-date=2014-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=2000 |publisher=Reed College public affairs office |title=INVENTOR AND PHYSICIST JAMES RUSSELL '53 WILL RECEIVE VOLLUM AWARD AT REED'S CONVOCATION |access-date=2014-07-24 |url=http://reed.edu/news_center/press_releases/2000-2001/288.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009170700/http://www.reed.edu/news_center/press_releases/2000-2001/288.html |archive-date=2013-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/russell.html |title=Inventor of the Week - James T.

Both Gregg's and Russell's disc are floppy media read in transparent mode, which imposes serious drawbacks. In the [[Netherlands]] in 1969, [[Philips]] Research [[physicist]], Pieter Kramer invented an optical [[videodisc]] in reflective mode with a protective layer read by a focused [[laser]] beam {{US Patent|5,068,846}}, filed 1972, issued 1991. Kramer's physical format is used in all optical discs. In 1975, Philips and MCA began to work together, and in 1978, commercially much too late, they presented their long-awaited [[Laserdisc]] in [[Atlanta]]. MCA delivered the discs and Philips the players. However, the presentation was a commercial failure, and the cooperation ended.

In Japan and the U.S., [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]] succeeded with the Laserdisc until the advent of the DVD. In 1979, Philips and [[Sony]], in consortium, successfully developed the [[Compact Disc|audio compact disc]].

In 1979, Exxon STAR Systems in Pasadena, CA built a computer controlled WORM drive that utilized thin film coatings of Tellurium and Selenium on a 12&quot; diameter glass disk. The recording system utilized blue light at 457nm to record and red light at 632.8nm to read. STAR Systems was bought by Storage Technology Corporation (STC) in 1981 and moved to Boulder, CO.  Development of the WORM technology was continued using 14&quot; diameter aluminum substrates. Beta testing of the disk drives, originally labeled the Laser Storage Drive 2000 (LSD-2000), was only moderately successful. Many of the disks were shipped to RCA Laboratories (now David Sarnoff Research Center) to be used in the Library of Congress archiving efforts. The STC disks utilized a sealed cartridge with an optical window for protection {{US Patent|4,542,495}}.

The [[CD-ROM]] format was developed by Sony and [[Philips]], introduced in 1984, as an extension of [[Compact Disc Digital Audio]] and adapted to hold any form of digital data. The same year, Sony demonstrated a [[LaserDisc]] data storage format, with a larger data capacity of 3.28 GB.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbh1XP4kCT4 Japanese PCs (1984)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707091011/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbh1XP4kCT4 |date=2017-07-07 }} (14:24), ''[[Computer Chronicles]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Optex, Inc. of Rockville, MD, built an erasable optical digital video disc system {{US Patent|5,113,387}} using Electron Trapping Optical Media (ETOM){{US Patent|5,128,849}}. Although this technology was written up in Video Pro Magazine's December 1994 issue promising &quot;the death of the tape&quot;, it was never marketed.

In the mid-1990s, a consortium of manufacturers (Sony, Philips, [[Toshiba]], [[Panasonic]]) developed the second generation of the optical disc, the [[DVD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=HAWAN KIM|first=SUNG|title=June 2004|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/17865/56611707.pdf|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204001454/http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/17865/56611707.pdf|archive-date=2013-12-04|year=2004|type=Thesis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnetic disks found limited applications in storing the data in large amount. So, there was the need of finding some more data storing techniques. As a result, it was found that by using optical means large data storing devices can be made that in turn gave rise to the optical discs. The very first application of this kind was the Compact Disc (CD), which was used in audio systems.

Sony and Philips developed the first generation of the CDs in the mid-1980s with the complete specifications for these devices. With the help of this kind of technology the possibility of representing the analog signal into digital signal was exploited to a great level. For this purpose, the 16-bit samples of the analog signal were taken at the rate of [[44,100 Hz|44,100 samples per second]]. This sample rate was based on the [[Nyquist rate]] of 40,000 samples per second required to capture the audible frequency range to 20 kHz without aliasing, with an additional tolerance to allow the use of less-than-perfect analog audio pre-filters to remove any higher frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;Hass, J. ''Introduction to Computer Music'', Indiana University CECM (retrieved 8 October 2014), Volume One, Chapter Five: Digital Audio.{{cite web|title=Chapter Five: Principles of Digital Audio|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~emusic/etext/digital_audio/chapter5_rate.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140608134439/http://www.indiana.edu/%7Eemusic/etext/digital_audio/chapter5_rate.shtml|archive-date=2014-06-08|access-date=2014-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first version of the standard allowed up to 75 minutes of music, which required 650MB of storage.

The [[DVD]] disc appeared after the CD-ROM had become widespread in society.

The third generation optical disc was developed in 2000–2006 and was introduced as Blu-ray Disc. First movies on Blu-ray Discs were released in June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drawbaugh|first=Ben|date=June 19, 2006|title=HD DVD and Blu-ray movies released on June 20th 2006|url=https://www.engadget.com/2006/06/19/hd-dvd-and-blu-ray-movies-released-on-june-20th-2006/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411111451/https://www.engadget.com/2006/06/19/hd-dvd-and-blu-ray-movies-released-on-june-20th-2006/|archive-date=2018-04-11|publisher=Engadget International Editions}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Blu-ray eventually prevailed in a [[high definition optical disc format war]] over a competing format, the [[HD DVD]]. A standard Blu-ray disc can hold about 25 GB of data, a DVD about 4.7 GB, and a CD about 700 MB.

[[File:Comparison CD DVD HDDVD BD.svg|thumb|300px|Comparison of various optical storage media&lt;!-- parameters: track pitch (p), pit width (w) and minimum length (l), and laser spot size (&amp;#8960;) and wavelength (&amp;#955;). --&gt;]]

===First-generation===
Initially, optical discs were used to store broadcast-quality analog video, and later digital media such as music or computer software. The [[LaserDisc]] format stored [[analog video]] signals for the distribution of [[home video]], but commercially lost to the [[VHS]] [[Videocassette#Cassette formats|videocassette]] format, due mainly to its high cost and non-re-recordability; other first-generation disc formats were designed only to store digital data and were not initially capable of use as a [[digital video]] medium.

Most first-generation disc devices had an infrared laser reading head. The minimum size of the laser spot is proportional to the [[wavelength]] of the laser, so wavelength is a limiting factor upon the amount of information that can be stored in a given physical area on the disc. The infrared range is beyond the long-wavelength end of the visible light spectrum, so it supports less density than shorter-wavelength visible light. One example of high-density data storage capacity, achieved with an infrared laser, is 700 MB of net user data for a 12 cm compact disc.

Other factors that affect data storage density include: the existence of multiple layers of data on the disc, the method of rotation ([[Constant linear velocity]] (CLV), [[Constant angular velocity]] (CAV), or zoned-CAV), the composition of lands and pits, and how much margin is unused is at the center and the edge of the disc.

===Second-generation===
Second-generation optical discs were for storing great amounts of data, including broadcast-quality digital video. Such discs usually are read with a visible-light laser (usually red); the shorter wavelength and greater [[numerical aperture]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Crutchfield Advisor&quot;&gt;[http://www.crutchfieldadvisor.com/S-UNO5yLxzuZf/learningcenter/home/hd_blu.html?page=2 Format War Update: Blu-ray Wins Over HD DVD] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110072357/http://www.crutchfieldadvisor.com/S-UNO5yLxzuZf/learningcenter/home/hd_blu.html?page=2 |date=2008-01-10 }}.

In the DVD format, this allows 4.7 GB storage on a standard 12 cm, single-sided, single-layer disc; alternatively, smaller media, such as the [[DataPlay]] format, can have capacity comparable to that of the larger, standard compact 12 cm disc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Optical Carriers|url=http://webworld.unesco.org/safeguarding/en/pdf/txt_opti.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151214233640/http://webworld.unesco.org/safeguarding/en/pdf/txt_opti.pdf|archive-date=2015-12-14|access-date=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third-generation===
Third-generation optical discs are used for distributing [[HDTV|high-definition video]] and videogames and support greater data storage capacities, accomplished with short-wavelength visible-light lasers and greater numerical apertures. Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD uses blue-violet lasers and focusing optics of greater aperture, for use with discs with smaller pits and lands, thereby greater data storage capacity per layer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crutchfield Advisor&quot; /&gt;
In practice, the effective multimedia presentation capacity is improved with enhanced video [[data compression]] [[codec]]s such as [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] and [[VC-1]].

==Recordable and writable optical discs==
{{main|Optical disc recording technologies}}
There are numerous formats of optical [[direct to disk recording]] devices on the market, all of which are based on using a laser to change the [[reflectivity]] of the [[digital recording]] medium in order to duplicate the effects of the pits and lands created when a commercial optical disc is pressed.
Formats such as [[CD-R]] and [[DVD-R]] are &quot;[[Write once read many]]&quot; or write-once, while [[CD-RW]] and [[DVD-RW]] are rewritable, more like a [[magnetic recording]] [[hard disk drive]] (HDD).
Media technologies vary, [[M-DISC]] uses a different recording technique &amp; media versus DVD-R and BD-R.

== Surface error scanning ==
{{expand section|date=July 2020}}
Optical media can [[Predictive_failure_analysis|predictively]] be scanned for errors and [[disc rot|media deterioation]] well before any data becomes unreadable.&lt;ref name=qpx&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://qpxtool.sourceforge.io/faq.html|title=QPxTool - check the quality|website=qpxtool.sourceforge.io}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A higher rate of errors may indicates deteriorating and/or low quality media, physical damage, an unclean surface and/or media written using a defective optical drive. Those errors can be compensated by [[error correction]] to some extent.

Error scanning software includes ''[[Nero DiscSpeed]]'', ''k-probe'', ''Opti Drive Control'' (formerly ''&quot;CD speed 2000&quot;'') and ''DVD info Pro'' for [[Windows]], and [[QPxTool]] for [[cross-platform]].

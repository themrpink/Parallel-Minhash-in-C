A deeply religious person, Church was a lifelong member of the [[Presbyterian]] church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction Alonzo Church: Life and Work |url=https://www.math.ucla.edu/~hbe/church.pdf |accessdate=6 June 2012 |page=4 |quote=A deeply religious person, he was a lifelong member of the Presbyterian church. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901152639/http://www.math.ucla.edu/~hbe/church.pdf |archivedate=1 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 1995 and was buried in [[Princeton Cemetery]].

==Mathematical work==
Church is known for the following significant accomplishments:
*His proof that the [[Entscheidungsproblem]], which asks for a [[decision procedure]] to determine the truth of arbitrary propositions in a first-order mathematical [[theory (mathematical logic)|theory]], is [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]]. This is known as [[Church's theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. |last=Church |author-link=Alonzo Church |title=An unsolvable problem of elementary number theory |journal=American Journal of Mathematics |volume=58 |number=2 |year=1936 |pages=345–363 |doi=10.2307/2371045 |jstor=2371045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*His proof that [[Peano arithmetic]] is undecidable.  
*His articulation of what has come to be known as the [[Church–Turing thesis]].
*He was the founding editor of the ''[[Journal of Symbolic Logic]]'', editing its reviews section until 1979.
*His invention of the [[lambda calculus]].

The lambda calculus emerged in his 1936 paper showing the unsolvability of the Entscheidungsproblem.  This result preceded [[Alan Turing]]'s work on the [[halting problem]], which also demonstrated the existence of a problem unsolvable by mechanical means. Church and Turing then showed that the lambda calculus and the [[Turing machine]] used in Turing's halting problem were equivalent in capabilities, and subsequently demonstrated a variety of alternative &quot;mechanical processes for computation.&quot; This resulted in the Church–Turing thesis.

The efforts for automatically generating a controller implementation from specifications originates from his ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdl.cs.mcgill.ca/people/levi/30_publications/files/paper_NFM_2017.pdf  Just Formal Enough? Automated Analysis of EARS Requirements]&lt;/ref&gt;

The lambda calculus influenced the design of the [[LISP programming language]] and [[functional programming]] languages in general. The [[Church encoding]] is named in his honor.

In his honor the Alonzo Church Award for Outstanding Contributions to Logic and Computation was established in 2015 by the Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Group for Logic and Computation ([[ACM SIGLOG]]), the [[European Association for Theoretical Computer Science]] (EATCS), the European Association for Computer Science Logic ([[EACSL]]), and the [[Kurt Gödel Society]] (KGS). The award
is for an outstanding contribution to the field published within the past 25 years and must not yet have received recognition via another major award, such as the [[Turing Award]], the [[Paris Kanellakis Award]], or the [[Gödel Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eatcs.org/index.php/church-award Alonzo Church Award]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://siglog.acm.org/alonzo-church-award-for-outstanding-contributions-to-logic-and-computation-2019/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==
{{Quote|Church’s elaboration of a methodology involving the logistic method, his philosophical criticisms of nominalism and his defense of realism, his argumentation leading to conclusions about the theory of meaning, and the detailed construction of the Fregean and Russellian [[Modal logic|intensional logics]], are more than sufficient to place him high up among the most important philosophers of this century.|[[C. Anthony Anderson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Anderson|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Australia Group''' is a [[multilateral export control regime]] (MECR) and an informal group of countries (now joined by the [[European Commission]]) established in 1985 (after the use of [[chemical weapon]]s by [[Iraq]] in 1984) to help member countries to identify those exports which need to be controlled so as not to contribute to the spread of [[chemical weapon|chemical]] and [[biological weapon|biological]] [[weapon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiagroup.net/en/origins.html|title=The Australia Group - Origins|website=www.australiagroup.net|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group, initially consisting of 15 members, held its first meeting in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], in June 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Australia Group - Origins |url=https://australiagroup.net/en/origins.html |website=www.australiagroup.net |accessdate=23 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the incorporation of India on January 19, 2018, it now has 43 members,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiagroup.net/en/india_statement.html|title=The Australia Group - Membership|website=www.australiagroup.net|access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Australia]], the [[European Commission]], all 27 [[member states of the European Union]], [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[India]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Argentina]]. The name comes from Australia's initiative to create the group. Australia manages the secretariat.

The initial members of the group had different assessments of which [[chemical precursor]]s should be subject to [[export control]]. Later adherents initially had no such controls. Today, members of the group maintain export controls on a uniform list of 87&lt;ref name=&quot;AG&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://costanziresearch.com/cw-nonproliferation/cw-control-lists/ag-chemicals/|title=Australia Group Chemical Weapons Precursors List

In 2002, the group took two important steps to strengthen export control. The first was the &quot;no-undercut&quot; requirement, which stated that any member of the group considering making an export to another state that had already been denied an export by any other member of the group must first consult with that member state before approving the export. The second was the &quot;catch-all&quot; provision, which requires member states to halt all exports that could be used by importers in chemical or biological weapons programs, regardless of whether the export is on the group's control lists.&lt;ref&gt;Arms Control Association, &quot;The Australia Group at a Glance&quot;, September 2003, available at www.armscontrol.org/factssheets/australiagroup.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Delegations representing the members meet every year in [[Paris]], [[France]].&lt;ref name = &quot;croddy&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first = Eric | last = Croddy | title = Chemical and Biological Weapons: A Comprehensive Study for the Concerned Citizen | publisher = Copernicus Books | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-387-95076-1 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/chemicalbiologic00crod/page/180 180–1] | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/chemicalbiologic00crod/page/180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{performing arts}}

'''Ballet''' ({{IPA-fr|balɛ|lang}}) is a type of [[performance dance]] that originated during the [[Italian Renaissance]] in the fifteenth century and later developed into a [[concert dance]] form in France and Russia. It has since become a widespread, highly technical form of dance with its own [[Glossary of ballet|vocabulary based on French terminology]]. It has been globally influential and has defined the foundational [[ballet technique|techniques]] used in many other dance genres and cultures. Ballet has been taught in various schools around the world, which have historically incorporated their own cultures and as a result, the art has evolved in a number of distinct ways. See [[glossary of ballet]].

A '''''ballet''''', a [[work of art|work]], consists of the [[choreography (dance)|choreography]] and [[music]] for a ballet production. Ballets are choreographed and performed by trained [[ballet dancer]]s. Traditional [[classical ballet]]s are usually performed with [[classical music]] accompaniment and use elaborate costumes and staging, whereas modern ballets, such as the [[Neoclassical ballet|neoclassical]] works of American choreographer [[George Balanchine]], are often performed in simple costumes (e.g., leotards and tights) and without the use of elaborate sets or scenery.

==Etymology==
Ballet is a French word which had its origin in Italian ''balletto'', a [[diminutive]] of ''ballo'' (dance) which comes from [[Latin]] ''ballo'', ''ballare'', meaning &quot;to dance&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;chantrell&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;perseus&quot; /&gt; which in turn comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] &quot;βαλλίζω&quot; (''ballizo''), &quot;to dance, to jump about&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;perseus&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;harper&quot; /&gt; The word came into English usage from the French around 1630.

==History==
{{Main|History of ballet|Timeline of ballet}}
[[File:Ballet de la nuit 1653.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] as Apollo in the ''[[Ballet Royal de la Nuit]]'' (1653)]]

Ballet originated in the [[Italian Renaissance]] courts of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Under [[Catherine de' Medici]]'s influence as Queen, it spread to France, where it developed even further.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Apollo's Angels: A History of Ballet|last=Homans|first=Jennifer|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4000-6060-3|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/apollosangelshis00homa_0/page/n30 1]–4|url=https://archive.org/details/apollosangelshis00homa_0|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dancers in these early [[Ballets de cour|court ballets]] were mostly noble amateurs.  Ornamented costumes were meant to impress viewers, but they restricted performers' freedom of movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ballet: An Illustrated History|last=Clarke|first=Mary|last2=Crisp|first2=Clement|publisher=[[Hamish Hamilton]]|year=1992|isbn=978-0-241-13068-1|location=Great Britain|pages=17–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ballets were performed in large chambers with viewers on three sides.  The implementation of the [[proscenium]] arch from 1618 on distanced performers from audience members, who could then better view and appreciate the technical feats of the professional dancers in the productions.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

French court ballet reached its height under the reign of King [[Louis XIV]]. Louis founded the [[Académie Royale de Danse]] (Royal Dance Academy) in 1661 to establish standards and certify dance instructors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/93297/art-power-how-louis-xiv-ruled-france-ballet|title=The Art of Power: How Louis XIV Ruled France ...

Together their partnership would drastically influence the development of ballet, as evidenced by the credit given to them for the creation of the five major positions of the feet.  By 1681, the first &quot;ballerinas&quot; took the stage following years of training at the Académie.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Ballet started to decline in France after 1830, but it continued to develop in Denmark, Italy, and Russia. The arrival in Europe of the [[Ballets Russes]] led by [[Sergei Diaghilev]] on the eve of the [[World War I|First World War]] revived interest in the ballet and started the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ballet 101: A Complete Guide to Learning and Loving the Ballet|last=Greskovic|first=Robert|publisher=[[Hachette Books|Hyperion Books]]|year=1998|isbn=978-0-7868-8155-0|location=New York, New York|pages=46–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the twentieth century, ballet had a wide influence on other dance genres,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nyfa.edu/student-resources/ballet-and-modern-dance/|title=Ballet And Modern Dance: Using Ballet As The Basis For Other Dance Techniques|date=2014-08-05|work=Student Resources|access-date=2017-07-26|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002220627/https://www.nyfa.edu/student-resources/ballet-and-modern-dance/|archive-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in the twentieth century, ballet took a turn dividing it from classical ballet to the introduction of [[modern dance]], leading to modernist movements in several countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;wulff&quot; /&gt;

Famous dancers of the twentieth century include [[Anna Pavlova]], [[Galina Ulanova]], [[Rudolf Nureyev]], [[Maya Plisetskaya]], [[Margot Fonteyn]], [[Rosella Hightower]], [[Maria Tall Chief]], [[Erik Bruhn]], [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]], [[Suzanne Farrell]], [[Gelsey Kirkland]], [[Natalia Makarova]], and [[Arthur Mitchell (dancer)|Arthur Mitchell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/periods-genres/ballet/greatest-ballet-dancers/|title=The ten greatest ballet dancers of the twentieth century|work=Classic FM|access-date=2017-10-02|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002221516/http://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/periods-genres/ballet/greatest-ballet-dancers/|archive-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles==
[[File:MarieSalle.jpg|thumb|[[Marie Sallé]], classical ballet dancer]]
Stylistic variations and subgenres have evolved over time. Early, classical variations are primarily associated with geographic origin. Examples of this are [[Russian ballet]], [[French ballet]], and [[Italian ballet]]. Later variations, such as contemporary ballet and neoclassical ballet, incorporate both classical ballet and non-traditional technique and movement. Perhaps the most widely known and performed ballet style is late [[Romantic ballet]] (or [[Ballet blanc]]).

=== Classical ballet ===
{{main|Classical ballet}}
[[File:Swanlake015.jpg|thumb|The ''Valse des cygnes'' from Act II of the Ivanov/Petipa edition of ''Swan Lake'']]
Classical ballet is based on traditional ballet [[Glossary of ballet|technique and vocabulary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technical Manual and Dictionary of Classical Ballet|last=Grant|first=Gail|publisher=[[Dover Publications]]|year=1982|isbn=978-0-486-21843-4|location=New York, US|url=https://archive.org/details/technicalmanuald00gail}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different styles have emerged in different countries, such as [[French ballet]], [[Italian ballet]], [[English ballet]], and [[Russian ballet]]. Several of the classical ballet styles are associated with specific training methods, typically named after their creators (see below).  The [[Royal Academy of Dance|Royal Academy of Dance method]] is a ballet technique and training system that was founded by a diverse group of ballet dancers. They merged their respective dance methods (Italian, French, Danish and Russian) to create a new style of ballet that is unique to the organization and is recognized internationally as the English style of ballet.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; Some examples of classical ballet productions are: ''[[Swan Lake]]'', ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' and ''[[The Nutcracker]].''

===Romantic ballet===
{{main|Romantic ballet}}
[[File:Giselle -Carlotta Grisi -1841 -2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Carlotta Grisi]], the original [[Giselle]], 1841, wearing the romantic tutu]]
Romantic ballet was an artistic movement of classical ballet and several productions remain in the classical repertoire today. The Romantic era was marked by the emergence of [[Pointe technique|pointe]] work, the dominance of female dancers, and longer, flowy tutus that attempt to exemplify softness and a delicate aura.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; This movement occurred during the early to mid-nineteenth century (the [[Romantic era]]) and featured themes that emphasized intense emotion as a source of [[aesthetic]] experience. The plots of many romantic ballets revolved around spirit women (sylphs, wilis, and ghosts) who enslaved the hearts and senses of mortal men. The 1827 ballet ''[[La Sylphide]]'' is widely considered to be the first, and the 1870 ballet ''[[Coppélia]]'' is considered to be the last.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Famous ballet dancers of the Romantic era include [[Marie Taglioni]], [[Fanny Elssler]], and [[Jules Perrot]]. Jules Perrot is also known for his choreography, especially that of ''[[Giselle]]'', often considered to be the most widely celebrated romantic ballet.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

===Neoclassical ballet===
{{main|Neoclassical ballet}}
Neoclassical ballet is usually abstract, with no clear plot, costumes or scenery. Music choice can be diverse and will often include [[Neoclassicism (music)|music that is also neoclassical]] (e.g. [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], [[Albert Roussel|Roussel]]). Tim Scholl, author of ''From Petipa to Balanchine'', considers [[George Balanchine]]'s ''[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollo]]'' in 1928 to be the first neoclassical ballet. ''Apollo'' represented a return to form in response to [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s abstract ballets. Balanchine worked with modern dance choreographer [[Martha Graham]], and brought modern dancers into his company such as [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)|Paul Taylor]], who in 1959 performed in Balanchine's ''[[Episodes (ballet)|Episodes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Petipa to Balanchine: Classical Revival and the Modernization of Ballet|last=Scholl|first=Tim|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1994|isbn=978-0415756211|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Balanchine is widely considered the face of neoclassical ballet, there were others who made significant contributions. [[Frederick Ashton]]’s ''[[Symphonic Variations (ballet)|Symphonic Variations]]'' (1946) is a seminal work for the choreographer. Set to [[César Franck]]’s score of the same title, it is a pure-dance interpretation of the score.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Another form, [[Modern ballet|Modern Ballet]], also emerged as an offshoot of neoclassicism. Among the innovators in this form were [[Glen Tetley]], [[Robert Joffrey]] and [[Gerald Arpino]]. While difficult to parse modern ballet from neoclassicism, the work of these choreographers favored a greater athleticism that departed from the delicacy of ballet. The physicality was more daring, with mood, subject matter and music more intense. An example of this would be Joffrey's ''Astarte'' (1967), which featured a rock score and sexual overtones in the choreography.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;

===Contemporary ballet===
{{main|Contemporary ballet}}
[[File:Grace in winter, contemporary ballet.jpg|thumb|A ballet leap performed with modern, non-classical form in a contemporary ballet]]
This ballet style is often performed barefoot. Contemporary ballets may include [[Mime artist|mime]] and [[acting]], and are usually set to music (typically orchestral but occasionally vocal). It can be difficult to differentiate this form from neoclassical or modern ballet. Contemporary ballet is also close to [[contemporary dance]] because many contemporary ballet concepts come from the ideas and innovations of twentieth-century modern dance, including floor work and turn-in of the legs. The main distinction is that ballet technique is essential to perform a contemporary ballet.

George Balanchine is considered to have been a pioneer of contemporary ballet. Another early contemporary ballet choreographer, [[Twyla Tharp]], choreographed ''Push Comes To Shove'' for the [[American Ballet Theatre]] in 1976, and in 1986 created ''In The Upper Room'' for her own company. Both of these pieces were considered innovative for their melding of distinctly modern movements with the use of pointe shoes and classically trained dancers.

Today there are many contemporary ballet companies and choreographers. These include [[Alonzo King]] and his company [[Alonzo King LINES Ballet|LINES Ballet]]; [[Matthew Bourne]] and his company [[New Adventures]]; [[Complexions Contemporary Ballet]]; [[Nacho Duato]] and his [[Compañia Nacional de Danza]]; William Forsythe and [[The Forsythe Company]]; and [[Jiří Kylián]] of the [[Nederlands Dans Theater]]. Traditionally &quot;classical&quot; companies, such as the Mariinsky (Kirov) Ballet and the Paris Opera Ballet, also regularly perform contemporary works.

The term ''ballet'' has evolved to include all forms associated with it. Someone training as a ballet dancer will now be expected to perform neoclassical, modern and contemporary work. A ballet dancer is expected to be able to be stately and regal for classical work, free and lyrical in neoclassical work, and unassuming, harsh or pedestrian for modern and contemporary work. In addition, there are several modern varieties of dance that fuse classical ballet technique with contemporary dance, such as [[Hiplet (dance style)|Hiplet]], that require dancers to be practised in non-Western dance styles.&lt;ref name=kourlas&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/04/arts/dance/hiplet-an-implausible-hybrid-plants-itself-on-pointe.html|title=Hiplet: An Implausible Hybrid Plants Itself on Pointe|last=Kourlas|first=Gia|date=2016-09-02|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-03|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221165024/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/04/arts/dance/hiplet-an-implausible-hybrid-plants-itself-on-pointe.html|archive-date=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical methods of ballet instruction ==
There are six widely used, internationally recognized methods to teach or study ballet. These methods are the [[French ballet|French School]], the [[Vaganova method|Vaganova Method]], the [[Cecchetti method|Cecchetti Method]], the [[Bournonville method]], the [[Royal Academy of Dance|Royal Academy of Dance method]] (English style), and the [[Balanchine method]] (American style). Many more schools of technique exist in various countries.

Although preschool-age children are a lucrative source of income for a ballet studio, ballet instruction is generally not an age-appropriate for young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kaufman|first=Sarah L. Kaufman|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater_dance/parents-youre-enrolling-your-little-ones-in-the-wrong-kind-of-dance-class/2019/10/09/158aaaa6-e935-11e9-bafb-da248f8d5734_story.html|title=Parents, you're enrolling your little ones in the wrong kind of dance class|date=10 October 2019|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial instruction requires standing still and concentrating on posture, rather than dancing. Because of this, many ballet programs have historically not accepted students until approximately age 8. Creative movement and non-demanding pre-ballet classes are recommended as alternatives for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Paskevska|first=Anna|url=https://archive.org/details/gettingstartedin0000pask|url-access=registration|title=Getting Started in Ballet : A Parent's Guide to Dance Education: A Parent's Guide to Dance Education|date=1997-10-20|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-802773-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/gettingstartedin0000pask/page/30 30]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Medova|first=Marie-Laure|url=https://books.google.com/?id=J_-TYAg4FWsC&amp;pg=PP11|title=Ballet for Beginners|date=2004|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4027-1715-4|pages=11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

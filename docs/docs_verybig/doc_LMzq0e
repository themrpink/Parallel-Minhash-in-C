This is an approximate equation that is derived from the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] (written in [[spherical coordinate system]]) and describes the motion of the radius of the bubble ''R'' as a function of time ''t''. Here, ''μ'' is the [[viscosity]], ''p'' the [[pressure]], and ''γ'' the [[surface tension]]. The over-dots represent time derivatives. This equation, though approximate, has been shown to give good estimates on the motion of the bubble under the [[acoustics|acoustically]] driven field except during the final stages of collapse. Both simulation and experimental measurement show that during the critical final stages of collapse, the bubble wall velocity exceeds the speed of sound of the gas inside the bubble.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10046927&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barber BP, Putterman SJ | title = Light scattering measurements of the repetitive supersonic implosion of a sonoluminescing bubble | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 69 | issue = 26 | pages = 3839–3842 | date = December 1992 | pmid = 10046927 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.69.3839 | bibcode = 1992PhRvL..69.3839B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a more detailed analysis of the bubble's motion is needed beyond Rayleigh–Plesset to explore the additional energy focusing that an internally formed shock wave might produce.

==Mechanism of phenomenon==
{{main|Mechanism of sonoluminescence}}
The mechanism of the phenomenon of sonoluminescence is unknown. [[Hypothesis|Hypotheses]] include: hotspot, [[Bremsstrahlung|bremsstrahlung radiation]], collision-induced radiation and [[corona discharge]]s, [[nonclassical light]], [[Quantum tunnelling|proton tunneling]], [[electrodynamic]] [[Jet (fluid)|jets]] and [[fractoluminescence|fractoluminescent jets]] (now largely discredited due to contrary experimental evidence).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[Image:Sonoluminescence.png|center|600px|thumb|From left to right: apparition of bubble, slow expansion, quick and sudden contraction, emission of light]]

In 2002, M. Brenner, S. Hilgenfeldt, and D. Lohse published a 60-page review that contains a detailed explanation of the mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brenner MP, Hilgenfeldt S, Lohse D | title = Single-bubble sonoluminescence. | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | date = May 2002 | volume = 74 | issue = 2 | pages = 425–484 | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.74.425 | url = https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/single-bubble-sonoluminescence(ef18245b-e923-4f90-a6be-7b1189c34232).html | bibcode = 2002RvMP...74..425B }}&lt;/ref&gt; An important factor is that the bubble contains mainly inert noble gas such as argon or xenon (air contains about 1% argon, and the amount dissolved in water is too great; for sonoluminescence to occur, the concentration must be reduced to 20–40% of its equilibrium value) and varying amounts of [[water vapor]]. Chemical reactions cause [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] to be removed from the bubble after about one hundred expansion-collapse cycles. The bubble will then begin to emit light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Matula TJ, Crum LA | title = Evidence for gas exchange in single-bubble sonoluminescence. | journal = Physical Review Letters | date = January 1998 | volume = 80 | issue = 4 | pages = 865–868 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.80.865 | bibcode = 1998PhRvL..80..865M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The light emission of highly compressed noble gas is exploited technologically in the [[argon flash]] devices.

During bubble collapse, the inertia of the surrounding water causes high pressure and high temperature, reaching around 10,000 kelvins in the interior of the bubble, causing the ionization of a small fraction of the noble gas present. The amount ionized is small enough for the bubble to remain transparent, allowing volume emission; surface emission would produce more intense light of longer duration, dependent on [[wavelength]], contradicting experimental results. Electrons from ionized atoms interact mainly with neutral atoms, causing thermal bremsstrahlung radiation. As the wave hits a low energy trough, the pressure drops, allowing electrons to [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombine]] with atoms and light emission to cease due to this lack of free electrons. This makes for a 160-picosecond light pulse for argon (even a small drop in temperature causes a large drop in ionization, due to the large [[ionization energy]] relative to photon energy). This description is simplified from the literature above, which details various steps of differing duration from 15 microseconds (expansion) to 100 picoseconds (emission).

Computations based on the theory presented in the review produce radiation parameters (intensity and duration time versus wavelength) that match experimental results{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} with errors no larger than expected due to some simplifications (e.g., assuming a uniform temperature in the entire bubble), so it seems the phenomenon of sonoluminescence is at least roughly explained, although some details of the process remain obscure.

Any discussion of sonoluminescence must include a detailed analysis of metastability. Sonoluminescence in this respect is what is physically termed a bounded phenomenon meaning that the sonoluminescence exists in a bounded region of parameter space for the bubble; a coupled magnetic field being one such parameter. The magnetic aspects of sonoluminescence are very well documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Young JB, Schmiedel T, Kang W | title = Sonoluminescence in high magnetic fields. | journal = Physical Review Letters | date = December 1996 | volume = 77 | issue = 23 | pages = 4816–4819 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.4816 | pmid = 10062638 | bibcode = 1996PhRvL..77.4816Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other proposals===

====Quantum explanations====
An unusually exotic hypothesis of sonoluminescence, which has received much popular attention, is the Casimir energy hypothesis suggested by noted physicist [[Julian Schwinger]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Julian | last = Schwinger | name-list-style = vanc |url=http://www.infinite-energy.com/iemagazine/issue1/colfusthe.html |title= Cold Fusion: A History of Mine |publisher=Infinite-energy.com |date=1989-03-23 |access-date=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more thoroughly considered in a paper by [[Claudia Eberlein]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eberlein C | title = Theory of quantum radiation observed as sonoluminescence. | journal = Physical Review A | date = April 1996 | volume = 53 | issue = 4 | pages = 2772–2787 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.53.2772| pmid = 9913192 | url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/27f5/25c6fca3f8eff0605a6f71c75ce2a677ce7e.pdf | bibcode = 1996PhRvA..53.2772E | arxiv = quant-ph/9506024 | s2cid = 10902274 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[University of Sussex]]. Eberlein's paper suggests that the light in sonoluminescence is generated by the vacuum within the bubble in a process similar to [[Hawking radiation]], the radiation generated at the [[event horizon]] of [[black hole]]s. According to this vacuum energy explanation, since quantum theory holds that vacuum contains [[virtual particle]]s, the rapidly moving interface between water and gas converts virtual photons into real photons. This is related to the [[Unruh effect]] or the [[Casimir effect]]. The argument has been made that sonoluminescence releases too large an amount of energy and releases the energy on too short a time scale to be consistent with the vacuum energy explanation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv | vauthors = Milton KA | title = Dimensional and Dynamical Aspects of the Casimir Effect: Understanding the Reality and Significance of Vacuum Energy | page = preprint hep-th/0009173 | date = September 2000 | eprint = hep-th/0009173 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although other credible sources argue the vacuum energy explanation might yet prove to be correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv | vauthors = Liberati S, Belgiorno F, Visser M | title = Comment on &quot;Dimensional and dynamical aspects of the Casimir effect: understanding the reality and significance of vacuum energy&quot; | page = hep-th/0010140v1 | eprint = hep-th/0010140 | year = 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nuclear reactions====
{{main|Bubble fusion}}
Some have argued that the Rayleigh–Plesset equation described above is unreliable for predicting bubble temperatures and that actual temperatures in sonoluminescing systems can be far higher than 20,000 kelvins. Some research claims to have measured temperatures as high as 100,000 kelvins, and speculates temperatures could reach into the millions of kelvins.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18851095&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen W, Huang W, Liang Y, Gao X, Cui W | title = Time-resolved spectra of single-bubble sonoluminescence in sulfuric acid with a streak camera | journal = Physical Review E | volume = 78 | issue = 3 Pt 2 | pages = 035301 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18851095 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevE.78.035301 | lay-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131212070822/http://www.nature.com/nchina/2008/081015/full/nchina.2008.241.html | lay-source = Nature China | bibcode = 2008PhRvE..78c5301C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Temperatures this high could cause [[thermonuclear fusion]]. This possibility is sometimes referred to as [[bubble fusion]] and is likened to the implosion design used in the fusion component of [[thermonuclear weapon]]s.

On January 27, 2006, researchers at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] claimed to have produced fusion in sonoluminescence experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.rpi.edu/luwakkey/1322 |title=RPI: News &amp; Events – New Sonofusion Experiment Produces Results Without External Neutron Source |publisher=News.rpi.edu |date=2006-01-27 |access-date=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/01/060130155542.htm |title=Using Sound Waves To Induce Nuclear Fusion With No External Neutron Source |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=2006-01-31 |access-date=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments in 2002 and 2005 by [[Rusi Taleyarkhan|R. P. Taleyarkhan]] using deuterated [[acetone]] showed measurements of [[tritium]] and neutron output consistent with fusion. However, the papers were considered low quality and there were doubts cast by a report about the author's scientific misconduct. This made the report lose credibility among the scientific community.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes&quot;&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-sci-misconduct19-2008jul19,0,1765099.story Purdue physicist found guilty of misconduct], Los Angeles Times, July 19, 2008, Thomas H.

==Biological sonoluminescence==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Optical phenomenon]] --&gt;
[[Alpheidae|Pistol shrimp]] (also called ''snapping shrimp'') produce a type of cavitation luminescence from a collapsing bubble caused by quickly snapping its claw. The animal snaps a specialized claw shut to create a cavitation bubble that generates acoustic pressures of up to 80 kPa at a distance of 4&amp;nbsp;cm from the claw. As it extends out from the claw, the bubble reaches speeds of 60 miles per hour (97&amp;nbsp;km/h) and releases a sound reaching 218 decibels. The pressure is strong enough to kill small fish. The light produced is of lower intensity than the light produced by typical sonoluminescence and is not visible to the naked eye. The light and heat produced may have no direct significance, as it is the shockwave produced by the rapidly collapsing bubble which these shrimp use to stun or kill prey. However, it is the first known instance of an animal producing light by this effect and was whimsically dubbed &quot;shrimpoluminescence&quot; upon its discovery in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lohse D, Schmitz B, Versluis M | title = Snapping shrimp make flashing bubbles | journal = Nature | volume = 413 | issue = 6855 | pages = 477–8 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11586346 | doi = 10.1038/35097152 | bibcode = 2001Natur.413..477L | s2cid = 4429684 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has subsequently been discovered that another group of crustaceans, the [[mantis shrimp]], contains species whose club-like forelimbs can strike so quickly and with such force as to induce sonoluminescent cavitation bubbles upon impact.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patek and Caldwell&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Patek SN, Caldwell RL | title = Extreme impact and cavitation forces of a biological hammer: strike forces of the peacock mantis shrimp Odontodactylus scyllarus | journal = The Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 208 | issue = Pt 19 | pages = 3655–64 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16169943 | doi = 10.1242/jeb.01831 | url = https://works.bepress.com/sheila_patek/3/download/ | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A mechanical device with 3D printed snapper claw at five times the actual size was also reported to emit light in a similar fashion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Emily | last = Conover | name-list-style = vanc | date = 15 March 2019 | title = Some shrimp make plasma with their claws.

The '''University of Cologne''' ({{lang-de|Universität zu Köln}}) is a university in [[Cologne]], Germany. It was the sixth university to be established in [[Central Europe]]&lt;ref&gt;Prague (1348), Kraków (1364), Vienna (1365), Pécs (1367), Heidelberg (1386), Cologne (1388)&lt;/ref&gt; and, although it closed in 1798 before being re-established in 1919, it is now one of the largest universities in [[Germany]] with more than 48,000 students. The University of Cologne is a [[German Excellence University]].

==History==
[[File:Fachhochschule Köln - Campus Südstadt, GWZ-2984.jpg|thumb|First building of the new university]]

===1388–1798===
The University of [[Cologne]] was established in 1388 as the fourth university in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], after the [[Charles University of Prague]] (1348), the [[University of Vienna]] (1365) and the [[Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg]] (1386). The charter was signed by [[Pope]] [[Urban VI]]. The university began teaching on 6 January 1389.

In 1798, the university was abolished by the [[French people|French]], who had invaded Cologne in 1794, because under the new French constitution, many universities were abolished all over France. The last rector [[Ferdinand Franz Wallraf]] was able to preserve the university's [[Great Seal of the University of Cologne|Great Seal]], now once more in use.

===1919–today===
[[File:Hauptgebäude der Universität zu Köln-5634.jpg|thumb|Main building, by architect Adolf Abel, 1934]]
In 1919, the [[Prussia (state)|Prussian]] government endorsed a decision by the [[Cologne City Council]] to re-establish the university. This was considered to be a replacement for the loss of the [[University of Strasbourg]] on the west bank of the [[Rhine]], which contemporaneously reverted to France with the rest of Alsace. On 29 May 1919, the [[List of mayors of Cologne|Cologne Mayor]] [[Konrad Adenauer]] signed the charter of the modern university.

At that point, the new university was located in [[Neustadt-Süd]], but relocated to its current campus in [[Lindenthal, Cologne|Lindenthal]] on 2 November 1934. The old premises are now being used for the [[Cologne University of Applied Sciences]].

Initially, the university was composed of the Faculty of Business, Economics and Social Sciences (successor to the Institutes of Commerce and of Communal and Social Administration) and the Faculty of Medicine (successor to the Academy of Medicine). In 1920, the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Arts were added, from which latter the School of Mathematics and Natural Sciences was split off in 1955 to form a separate Faculty. In 1980, the two Cologne departments of the Rhineland School of Education were attached to the university as the Faculties of Education and of Special Education. In 1988, the university became a founding member of the [[Community of European Management Schools and International Companies]] (CEMS), today's [[Global Alliance in Management Education]].

The University is a leader in the area of economics and is regularly placed in top positions for law and business, both for national and international rankings.

==Organization==
[[File:Alphons-Silbermann-Weg, Köln, Juni 2008.jpg|thumb|University campus between main building and [[Cafeteria|mensa]] (the university canteen)]]
The University of Cologne is a statutory corporation (Körperschaft des öffentlichen Rechts), operated by the Federal State of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].

===Faculties===
The university is divided into six faculties, which together offer 200 fields of study. The faculties are those of Management, Economics and Social Sciences, Law, Medicine (with the affiliated University clinic), [[Art]]s, Mathematics and Natural Sciences and [[Human science|Human Sciences]].

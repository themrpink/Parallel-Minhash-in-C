'''Latvian'''  ({{lang|lv|latviešu valoda}} {{IPA-lv|ˈlatviɛʃu ˈvaluɔda|}}&lt;!-- short vowels do not take tones --&gt;), also known as '''Lettish'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Prauliņš |first=Dace |date=March 6, 2012 |title=Latvian: An Essential Grammar |location=London |publisher=Routeledge |page=1 |isbn=9780415576925}}&lt;/ref&gt;, is an [[Eastern Baltic languages|Eastern Baltic language]] spoken in the [[Baltic region]]. It is the language of [[Latvians]] and the official language of [[Latvia]] as well as one of the official languages of the [[European Union]]. There are about 1.3 million native Latvian speakers in Latvia and 100,000 abroad.

As a [[Baltic languages|Baltic language]], Latvian is most closely related to neighboring [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]; however Latvian has followed a more rapid development.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The circum-Baltic languages.|last=Dahl, Osten Dahl, Östen, ed.

Latvian first appeared in Western print in the mid-16th century with the reproduction of the Lord's Prayer in Latvian in [[Sebastian Münster]]'s {{lang|la|[[Cosmographia (Sebastian Münster)|Cosmographia universalis]]}} (1544), in [[Latin script]].

== Classification ==
Latvian belongs to the [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family. It is one of two living Baltic languages with an official status (the other being [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]). The Latvian and Lithuanian languages have retained many features of the nominal morphology of the proto-language, though, in matters of phonology and verbal morphology, they show many innovations{{Clarify|reason=Is 'innovation' a linguistic term, or is this a value judgement?  It would be nice if there were greater context to aid readers who are not linguists|date=July 2014}}, with Latvian being considerably more innovative than Lithuanian.

== History ==
[[File:Baltic Tribes c 1200.svg|thumb|200px|Distribution of the Baltic tribes, circa 1200 (boundaries are approximate).]]
[[File:Curonians kursenieki in 1649.png|thumb|right|200px|In 1649 settlement of the Latvian speaking [[Kursenieki]] spanned from [[Klaipėda|Memel (Klaipėda)]] to [[Gdańsk|Danzig (Gdańsk)]].]]

According to some [[glottochronology|glottochronological]] speculations, the Eastern Baltic languages split from Western [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] (or, perhaps, from the hypothetical [[proto-Baltic]] language) between 400 and 600 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lithuania taxation laws and regulations handbook.|last=International Business Publications, Usa.|date=2008|publisher=Intl Business Pubns Usa|isbn=978-1433080289|location=|pages=28|oclc=946497138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The differentiation between [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and Latvian started after 800 CE, with a long period of being one language but different dialects{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}. At a minimum, transitional dialects existed until the 14th century or 15th century, and perhaps as late as the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Indo-European Languages|last=Ramat|first=Anna Giacalone|last2=Ramat|first2=Paolo|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|isbn=9781134921867|location=|pages=454–479|chapter=The Baltic Languages|oclc=908192063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latvian as a distinct language emerged over several centuries from the language spoken by the ancient Latgalian tribe assimilating the languages of other neighbouring Baltic tribes — [[Curonian language|Curonian]], [[Semigallian language|Semigallian]] and [[Selonian (language)|Selonian]] — which resulted in these languages gradually losing their most distinct characteristics. This process of consolidation started in the 13th century after the [[Livonian Crusade]] and forced [[christianization]]. These tribes came under [[Terra Mariana|Livonian]] rule thus forming a unified political, economic and religious space.&lt;ref name=&quot;lnvm.lv&quot;&gt;[http://lnvm.lv/en/?page_id=942 Livonia. 13th-16th Century]&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest known examples of written Latvian are from a 1530 translation of a hymn made by Nikolaus Ramm, a German pastor in [[Riga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vīksniņš |first1=Nicholas |year=1973 |title=The Early History of Latvian Books |url=http://www.lituanus.org/1973/73_3_02.htm#Ref |journal=[[Lituanus]] |volume=19 |issue=3 |accessdate=3 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest preserved book in Latvian is a 1585 Catholic catechism of [[Petrus Canisius]] currently located at the [[Uppsala University Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://eng.lsm.lv/article/society/society/national-treasure-the-oldest-latvian-language-book-in-riga.a197919/ |title=National treasure: The oldest Latvian-language book in Rīga |date=25 August 2016 |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting of Latvia]] |accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first one to [[Bible translations into Latvian|translate the Bible]] into Latvian was the German [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] pastor [[Johann Ernst Glück]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rozenberga |first1=Māra |last2=Sprēde |first2=Antra |title=National treasure: The first Bible in Latvian |url=https://eng.lsm.lv/article/culture/culture/national-treasure-the-first-bible-in-latvian.a197713/ |accessdate=27 October 2017 |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting of Latvia]] |date=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[The New Testament]] in 1685 and [[The Old Testament]] in 1691). The Lutheran pastor [[Gotthard Friedrich Stender]] was a founder of the Latvian secular literature. He wrote the first illustrated Latvian [[alphabet book]] (1787) and the first encyclopedia “The Book of High Wisdom of the World and Nature” ({{lang|lv|Augstas gudrības grāmata no pasaules un dabas}}; 1774), the Grammar books and the Latvian–German and German–Latvian dictionaries.

Until the 19th century, the Latvian written language was influenced by [[German Lutherans|German Lutheran]] pastors and the [[German language]], because the upper class of local society was formed by [[Baltic Germans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; In the middle of the 19th century [[the First Latvian National Awakening]] was started, led by “[[Young Latvians]]” who popularized the use of Latvian language. Participants in this movement laid the foundations for standard Latvian and also popularized the Latvianization of loan words. However, in the 1880s, when Czar Alexander III came into power, [[Russification]] started. During this period, some Latvian scholars{{who|date=March 2014}} suggested adopting [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] for use in Latvian.

According to the [[1897 Imperial Russian Census]], there were 505,994 (75.1%) speakers of Latvian in the [[Governorate of Courland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_lan_97_uezd_eng.php?reg=638|title=The First General Census of the Russian Empire of 1897 – Courland governorate|publisher=Demoscope Weekly|accessdate=December 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 563,829 (43.4%) speakers of Latvian in the [[Governorate of Livonia]], making Latvian-speakers the largest linguistic group in each of the governorates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_lan_97_uezd_eng.php?reg=725|title=The First General Census of the Russian Empire of 1897 – Governorate of Livonia|publisher=Demoscope Weekly|accessdate=December 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the czar's death, around the start of the 20th century, nationalist movements re-emerged. In 1908, Latvian linguists [[Kārlis Mīlenbahs]] and [[Jānis Endzelīns]] elaborated the modern Latvian alphabet, which slowly replaced the old orthography used before. Another feature of the language, in common with its sister language Lithuanian, that was developed at that time is that proper names from other countries and languages are [[orthographic transcription|altered phonetically]] to fit the phonological system of Latvian, even if the original language also uses the Latin alphabet. Moreover, the names are modified to ensure that they have noun declension endings, declining like all other nouns. For example, a place such as [[Lecropt]] (a Scottish parish) is likely to become Lekropta; the Scottish village of [[Tillicoultry]] becomes Tilikutrija.

During the [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet time]] (1940–1991), the policy of [[Russification]] greatly affected the Latvian language. Throughout this period, many Latvians and Latvia's other ethnicities faced deportation and persecution. Massive immigration from the Soviet republics of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and others followed, largely as a result of Stalin's plan to integrate Latvia and the other Baltic republics into the Soviet Union by means of Russian colonization. As a result, the proportion of the ethnic Latvian population within the total population was reduced from 80% in 1935 to 52% in 1989. In Soviet Latvia, most of the immigrants who settled in the country did not learn Latvian. According to the 2011 [[census]] Latvian was the language spoken at home by 62% of the country's population.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;62%&quot;/&gt;

After the re-establishment of independence in 1991, a new policy of language education was introduced. The primary declared goal was the integration of all inhabitants into the environment of the official state language while protecting the languages of Latvia's ethnic minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Minority Protection in Latvia |date=2001 |publisher=Open Society Institute |url=http://providus.lv/article_files/1500/original/Min-LatviaEN.pdf?1331720008 |accessdate=3 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government-funded bilingual education was available in primary schools for ethnic minorities until 2019 when Parliament decided on educating only in Latvian. Minority schools are available for [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and [[Romany language|Roma]] schools. Latvian is taught as a second language in the initial stages too, as is officially declared, to encourage proficiency in that language, aiming at avoiding alienation from the Latvian-speaking linguistic majority and for the sake of facilitating academic and professional achievements. Since the mid-1990s, the government may pay a student's tuition in public universities only provided that the instruction is in Latvian. Since 2004, the state mandates Latvian as the language of instruction in public secondary schools (Form 10–12) for at least 60% of class work (previously, a broad system of education in Russian existed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Latvian Centre for Human Rights and Ethnic Studies |title=Analytical Report PHARE RAXEN_CC - Minority Education |date=2004 |publisher=Minority Education in Latvia |location=Vienna |url=https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/275-edu-latvia-final.pdf |accessdate=3 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Official Language Law was adopted on 9 December 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://likumi.lv/ta/en/en/id/14740-official-language-law|title=Official Language Law|website=[[likumi.lv]]|access-date=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several regulatory acts associated with this law have been adopted. Observance of the law is monitored by the State Language Centre run by the Ministry of Justice.

To counter the influence of [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[English language|English]], government organizations (namely the Terminology Commission of the Latvian Academy of Science and the State Language Center) popularize the use of Latvian terms. A debate arose over the Latvian term for [[euro]]. The Terminology Commission suggested {{lang|lv|eira}} or {{lang|lv|eirs}}, with their Latvianized and declinable ending, would be a better term for [[euro]] than the widely used {{lang|lv|eiro}}, while [[European Central Bank]] insisted that the original name ''euro'' be used in all languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/11051/ |title=No 'eira' - but 'eiro' will do |date=6 October 2004 |publisher=[[The Baltic Times]] |accessdate=28 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; New terms are Latvian derivatives, [[calque]]s or new loanwords. For example, Latvian has two words for &quot;telephone&quot; — {{lang|lv|tālrunis}} and {{lang|lv|telefons}}, the former being a direct translation into Latvian of the latter international term. Still, others are older or more euphonic loanwords rather than Latvian words. For example, &quot;computer&quot; can be either {{lang|lv|dators}}, {{lang|lv|kompjūters}}. Both are loanwords; the native Latvian word for &quot;computer&quot; is {{lang|lv|skaitļotājs}}, which is also an official term. However, now {{lang|lv|dators}} has been considered an appropriate translation, {{lang|lv|skaitļotājs}} is also used.

There are several contests held annually to promote the correct use of Latvian. One of them is &quot;Word of the year&quot; ({{lang|lv|Gada vārds}}) organized by the [[Riga Latvian Society]] since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://latviansonline.com/glabejsilite-is-word-of-the-year/|title='Glābējsilīte' is word of the year|date=18 January 2010|publisher=Latvians Online|accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features categories such as the &quot;Best word&quot;, &quot;Worst word&quot;, &quot;Best saying&quot; and &quot;[[Word salad]]&quot;. In 2018 the word {{lang|lv|zibmaksājums}} ([[instant payment]]) won the category of &quot;Best word&quot; and {{lang|lv|influenceris}} ([[influencer]]) won the category of &quot;Worst word&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://eng.lsm.lv/article/society/society/best-and-worst-words-of-2018-underlined.a307541/|title=Best and worst words of 2018 underlined|date=28 January 2019|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting of Latvia]]|accessdate=28 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word pair of {{lang|lv|straumēt}} ([[stream]]) and {{lang|lv|straumēšana}} (streaming) were named the best words of 2017, while {{lang|lv|transporti}} as an unnecessary plural of the name for [[transport]] was chosen as the worst word of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://eng.lsm.lv/article/culture/culture/best-and-worst-words-of-2017-underlined.a266259/|title=Best and worst words of 2017 underlined|date=31 January 2018|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting of Latvia]]|accessdate=28 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dialects ==
There are three [[dialect]]s in Latvian: the Livonian dialect, High Latvian and the Middle dialect. Latvian dialects and their varieties should not be confused with the [[Livonian language|Livonian]], [[Curonian language|Curonian]], [[Semigallian language|Semigallian]] and [[Selonian language|Selonian]] languages.

=== Livonian dialect ===
[[File:Latvaldialekti.svg|450 px|thumb|Map showing geographical distribution of the dialects in Latvia. Varieties of the Livonian dialect (''Lībiskais dialekts'') are in blue, the Middle dialect (''Vidus dialekts'') in green, the Upper dialect (''Augšzemnieku dialekts'') in yellow.]]

The Livonian dialect of Latvian was more affected by the [[Livonian language]] [[substratum]] than Latvian in other parts of Latvia. It is divided into the [[Vidzeme]] [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] and the [[Courland]] variety (also called ''tāmnieku''). There are two syllable [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonations]] in the Livonian dialect, extended and broken. In the Livonian dialect, short vowels in the endings of words are discarded, while long vowels are shortened. In all genders and numbers, only one form of the [[verb]] is used. [[Personal name]]s in both genders are derived with endings&amp;nbsp;– els, -ans. In [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]]es ''ie'' is changed to ''e''. Due to migration and the introduction of a standardised language this dialect has declined. It arose from assimilated [[Livonians]], who started to speak in Latvian and assimilated Livonian grammar into Latvian.

=== Middle dialect ===
The Middle dialect spoken in central and Southwestern Latvia is the basis of standard Latvian. The dialect is divided into the Vidzeme variety, the Curonian variety and the Semigallian variety. The Vidzeme variety and the Semigallian variety are closer to each other than to the Curonian variety, which is more archaic than the other two. There are three syllable intonations in some parts of Vidzeme variety of the Middle dialect, extended, broken and falling. The Curonian and Semigallian varieties have two syllable intonations, extended and broken, but some parts of the Vidzeme variety has extended and falling intonations. In the Curonian variety, ''ŗ'' is still used. The [[Kursenieki language]], which used to be spoken along [[Curonian Spit]], is closely related to the varieties of the Middle dialect spoken in [[Courland]].

=== Upper Latvian dialect ===
Upper Latvian dialect is spoken in Eastern Latvia. It is set apart from the rest of the Latvian by a number of phonetic differences. The dialect has two main varieties – Selonian (two syllable intonations, falling and rising) and Non-Selonian (falling and broken syllable intonations). There is a [[standard language]], the [[Latgalian language]], which is based on deep non-Selonian varieties spoken in the south of [[Latgale]]. The term &quot;Latgalian&quot; is sometimes also applied to all non-Selonian varieties or even the whole dialect. However, it is unclear if it is accurate to use the term for any varieties besides the standard language. While the term may refer to varieties spoken in [[Latgale]] or by [[Latgalians (modern)|Latgalians]], not all speakers identify as speaking Latgalian, for example, speakers of deep Non-Selonian varieties in [[Vidzeme]] explicitly deny speaking Latgalian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Markus|first=Dace|date=2012|title=The deep Latgalian variants of the High Latvian dialect in North-East Vidzeme (so-called Malenia)|journal=Baltistica|publisher=Vilnius University|issue=8 priedas|language=Latvian|url=http://www.baltistica.lt/index.php/baltistica/article/view/2114/2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-native speakers ==
The history of the Latvian language (see below) has placed it in a peculiar position for a language of its size whereby it is spoken by a large number of non-native speakers as compared to native speakers. The immigrant and minority population in Latvia is 700,000 people: [[Russians]], [[Belarusians]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Poles]], and others. The majority of immigrants came to Latvia between 1940 and 1991; supplementing pre-existing ethnic minority communities ([[Latvian Germans]], [[Latvian Jews]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} The trends show that the proficiency of Latvian among its non-native speakers is gradually increasing. In a 2009 survey by [[Latvian Language Agency]] 56% percent of respondents with Russian as their native language described having a good knowledge of Latvian, whereas for the younger generation (from 17 to 25 years) the number was 64%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://valoda.lv/en/wp-content/uploads/monitorings%20eng.pdf|title=Language situation in Latvia: 2004–2010|publisher=[[Latvian Language Agency]]|date=2012|isbn=978-9984-815-81-7|pages=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased adoption of Latvian by minorities was brought about by its status as the only official language of the country and other changes in the society after the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] that mostly shifted linguistic focus away from [[Russian language|Russian]]. As an example, in 2007, universities and colleges for the first time received applications from prospective students who had a bilingual secondary education in schools for minorities. Fluency in Latvian is expected in a variety of professions and careers.

== Grammar ==
{{main|Latvian grammar}}
Latvian grammar represents a classic Indo-European (Baltic) system with well-developed inflection and derivation. Primary word stress, with some exceptions in derivation and inflection, is on the first [[syllable]]. There are no articles in Latvian; definiteness is expressed by an inflection of adjectives. Basic word order in Latvian is [[subject–verb–object]]; however, word order is relatively free.

=== Nouns ===
{{main|Latvian declension}}
There are two [[grammatical gender]]s in Latvian (masculine and feminine) and two [[grammatical number|numbers]], singular and plural. Nouns, adjectives, and declinable participles [[declension|decline]] into seven cases: [[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Genitive case|genitive]], [[Dative case|dative]], [[Accusative case|accusative]], [[Instrumental case|instrumental]], [[Locative case|locative]], and [[Vocative case|vocative]]. There are six declensions for nouns.

=== Verbs ===
{{main|Latvian grammar#Verb conjugation}}
There are three conjugation classes in Latvian. Verbs are conjugated for person, tense, mood and voice.

== Orthography ==
{{main|Latvian alphabet|Latvian Braille|Latvian orthography}}

Latvian in [[Latin script]] was first based upon the [[German alphabet]], while the alphabet of the Latgalian dialect was based on the [[Polish alphabet]]. At the beginning of the 20th century, this was replaced by a more phonetically appropriate alphabet.

=== Standard orthography ===
Today, the Latvian standard alphabet consists of 33 letters:

{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center
|-
|bgcolor=&quot;#EFEFEF&quot; colspan=&quot;33&quot; | '''[[Capital letters|Majuscule forms]]''' (also called '''uppercase''' or '''capital letters''')
|-

|f ||g ||ģ ||h ||i ||ī ||j ||k ||ķ
|l ||ļ ||m ||n ||ņ ||o ||p ||r
|s ||š ||t ||u ||ū ||v ||z ||ž
|}

The modern standard Latvian alphabet uses 22 unmodified letters of the Latin alphabet (all except ''[[Q]]'', ''[[W]]'', ''[[X]]'' and ''[[Y]]''). It adds a further eleven letters by modification. The vowel letters ''[[A]]'', ''[[E]]'', ''[[I]]'' and ''[[U]]'' can take a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] to show length, unmodified letters being short; these letters are not differentiated while sorting (e.g. in dictionaries). The letters ''[[C]]'', ''[[S]]'' and ''[[Z]]'', that in unmodified form are pronounced {{IPA|[ts]}}, {{IPA|[s]}} and {{IPA|[z]}} respectively, can be marked with a [[caron]]. These marked letters, ''Č'', ''Š'' and ''Ž'' are pronounced {{IPA|[tʃ]}}, {{IPA|[ʃ]}} and {{IPA|[ʒ]}} respectively. The letters ''Ģ'', ''[[Ķ]]'', ''Ļ'' and ''Ņ'' are written with a [[cedilla]] or little 'comma' placed below (or above the lowercase ''g''). They are modified ([[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]]) versions of ''G'', ''K'', ''L'' and ''N'' and represent the sounds {{IPA|[ɟ]}}, {{IPA|[c]}}, {{IPA|[ʎ]}} and {{IPA|[ɲ]}}. Non-standard varieties of Latvian add extra letters to this standard set.

Latvian spelling has almost perfect correspondence between graphemes and phonemes. Every [[phoneme]] has its letter so that a reader doesn't need to learn how a word is pronounced and a writer doesn't need to learn how a word is written. There are only two exceptions to this, which could cause mispronunciation. The first problem is that the letters ''E''/''Ē'' represent two different sounds: {{IPA|[ɛ]/[ɛː]}} and {{IPA|[æ]/[æː]}}. The second problem is that letter ''O'' indicates both the short and long {{IPA|[ɔ]}}, and the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|[uɔ]}}. These three sounds are written as ''O'', ''Ō'' and ''Uo'' in [[Latgalian language|Latgalian]], and some Latvians campaign for the adoption of this system in standard Latvian. However, the majority of Latvian linguists argue that ''o'' and ''ō'' are found only in loanwords, with the ''Uo'' sound being the only native Latvian phoneme. The digraph ''Uo'' was discarded in 1914, and the letter ''Ō'' has not been used in the official Latvian language since 1946. Likewise, the letters ''Ŗ'' and ''Ch'' were discarded in 1957, although they are still used in some varieties and by many Latvians living beyond the borders of Latvia. The letter ''Y'' is used only in the standard Latgalian written language, where it is used to represent {{IPA|/{{IPA link|ɘ|ɨ}}/}}, which is not used in other dialects. Latvian orthography allows nine digraphs, which are written ''Ai'', ''Au'', ''Ei'', ''Ie'', ''Iu'', ''Ui'', ''Oi'', ''Dz'' and ''Dž''.

=== Old orthography ===
[[File:Old latvian bible.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Latvian [[Lutheran]] [[hymnbook]] in old orthography.]]
The old orthography was based on that of German and did not represent the Latvian language phonemically. At the beginning, it was used to write religious texts for German priests to help them in their work with Latvians. The first writings in Latvian were chaotic: there were twelve variations of writing ''Š''. In 1631 the German priest [[Georg Mancelius]] tried to systematize the writing. He wrote long vowels according to their position in the word&amp;nbsp;– a short vowel followed by ''h'' for a radical vowel, a short vowel in the suffix and vowel with a [[diacritic]] mark in the ending indicating two accents. Consonants were written following the example of German with multiple letters. The old orthography was used until the 20th century when it was slowly replaced by the modern orthography.

=== Latvian on computers ===
[[File:Latvian Ergonomic Keyboard Layout.png|450 px|thumb|The rarely used Latvian ergonomic keyboard layout]]

In late 1992 the official Latvian computing standard LVS 8-92 took effect. It was followed by LVS 24-93 (Latvian language support for computers) that also specified the way Latvian language (alphabet, numbers, currency, punctuation marks, date and time) should be represented on computers. A Latvian ergonomic keyboard standard LVS 23-93 was also announced several months later, but it didn't gain popularity due to its need for a custom-built keyboard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gross&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Gross |first=Arnis |url=https://latviansonline.com/the-next-challenge-for-the-latvian-language/ |title=The Next Challenge for the Latvian Language |date=July 4, 2015 |publisher=Latvians Online |accessdate=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays standard [[QWERTY]] or the US keyboards are used for writing in Latvian; diacritics are entered by using a [[dead key]] (usually ', occasionally ~).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gross&quot;/&gt; Some keyboard layouts use the [[modifier key]] [[AltGr key|AltGr]] (most notably the Windows 2000 and XP built-in layout (Latvian QWERTY), it is also default modifier in X11R6, thus a default in most Linux distributions).

In the 1990s, lack of software support of diacritics caused an unofficial style of orthography, often called ''[[Transliteration|translits]]'', to emerge for use in situations when the user is unable to access Latvian diacritic marks (e-mail, newsgroups, web user forums, chat, [[SMS]] etc.). It uses the [[List of Latin letters|basic Modern Latin alphabet]] only, and letters that are not used in standard orthography are usually omitted. In this style, diacritics are replaced by digraphs&amp;nbsp;– a doubled letter indicates a long vowel (as in Finnish and Estonian); a following ''j'' indicates palatalisation of consonants, i.e., a cedilla; and the postalveolars ''Š'', ''Č'' and ''Ž'' are written with ''h'' replacing the [[caron|háček]], as in English. Sometimes the second letter, the one used instead of a diacritic, is changed to one of two other diacritic letters (e.g. š is written as ss or sj, not sh), and since many people may find it difficult to use these unusual methods, they write without any indication of missing diacritic marks, or they use digraphing only if the diacritic mark in question would make a semantic difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politika.lv/ |title=Latviešu valodas izmaiņas un funkcijas interneta vidē |website=politika.lv |accessdate=2007-07-28 |year=2001 |first=Linda |last=Veinberga |language=Latvian |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120524124909/http://politika.lv/ |archivedate=2012-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes an apostrophe is used before or after the character that would properly need to be diacriticised.  Also, digraph diacritics are often used and sometimes even mixed with diacritical letters of standard orthography. Although today there is software support available, diacritic-less writing is still sometimes used for financial and social reasons. As ''š'' and ''ž'' are part of the [[Windows-1252]] coding, it is possible to input those two letters using a [[numerical keypad]]. Latvian language code for cmd and .bat files - 1257

=== Comparative orthography ===
For example, the [[Lord's Prayer]] in Latvian written in different styles:

Consonants in consonant sequences [[Consonant voicing and devoicing#Voicing assimilation|assimilate to the voicing of the subsequent consonant]], e.g. a'''p'''gabals {{IPA|[ˈa'''b'''ɡabals]}} or la'''b'''s {{IPA|[ˈla'''p'''s]}}. Latvian does not feature [[final-obstruent devoicing]].

Consonants can be long (written as double consonants) {{lang|lv|mamma}} {{IPA|[ˈmamːa]}}, or short. Plosives and fricatives occurring between two short vowels are lengthened: {{lang|lv|upe}} {{IPA|[ˈupːe]}}. Same with 'zs' that is pronounced as {{IPA|/sː/}}, šs and žs as {{IPA|/ʃː/}}.

=== Vowels ===
Latvian has six vowels, with [[Vowel length|length]] as distinctive feature:

| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
|}
{{IPA|/ɔ ɔː/}}, and the diphthongs involving it other than {{IPA|/uɔ/}}, are confined to loanwords.

Latvian also has 10 [[diphthong]]s, four of which are only found in loanwords ({{IPA|/ai ui ɛi au iɛ uɔ iu (ɔi) ɛu (ɔu)/}}), although some diphthongs are mostly limited to proper names and interjections.

=== Syllable accent ===
Standard Latvian and, with some exceptions in derivation and inflection, all of the Latvian dialects have fixed initial stress. Long vowels and diphthongs have a tone, regardless of their position in the word. This includes the so-called &quot;mixed diphthongs&quot;, composed of a short vowel followed by a [[sonorant]].

== Loanwords ==

During the period of [[Livonia]] many [[Middle Low German]] words such as ''amats'' (profession), ''dambis'' (dam), būvēt (to build) and ''bikses'' (trousers) were borrowed into Latvian, while the period of [[Swedish Livonia]] brought loanwords like ''skurstenis'' (chimney) from [[Swedish language|Swedish]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Veips&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Veips |first=Lauris |url=https://eng.lsm.lv/article/features/features/from-the-language-of-serfs-to-official-eu-communication-the-journey-of-latvian.a236321/ |title=From the language of serfs to official EU communication - the journey of Latvian |date=13 May 2017 |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting of Latvia]] |accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

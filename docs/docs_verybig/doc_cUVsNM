The conquest of the Iberian Peninsula was complete two centuries after the Roman arrival, when they defeated the remaining Cantabri, Astures and Gallaeci in the [[Cantabrian Wars]] in the time of Emperor [[Augustus]] (19 BC). In 74 AD, [[Vespasian]] granted [[Latin Rights]] to most municipalities of Lusitania. In 212 AD, the [[Constitutio Antoniniana]] gave [[Roman citizenship]] to all free subjects of the empire and, at the end of the century, the emperor [[Diocletian]] founded the province of [[Gallaecia]], which included modern-day [[Norte Region, Portugal|northern Portugal]], with its capital at Bracara Augusta (now [[Braga]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;infopedia&quot; /&gt; As well as mining, the Romans also developed agriculture, on some of the best agricultural land in the empire. In what is now [[Alentejo]], vines and cereals were cultivated, and fishing was intensively pursued in the coastal belt of the [[Algarve]], [[Póvoa de Varzim]], [[Matosinhos]], Troia and the coast of Lisbon, for the manufacture of [[garum]] that was exported by Roman trade routes to the entire empire. Business transactions were facilitated by coinage and the construction of an extensive road network, bridges and aqueducts, such as Trajan's bridge in [[Aquae Flaviae]] (now [[Chaves Municipality, Portugal|Chaves]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portugalromano.com/|title=HugeDomains.com – PortugalRomano.com is for sale (Portugal Romano)|website=www.portugalromano.com|access-date=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman rule brought geographical mobility to the inhabitants of Portugal and increased their interaction with the rest of the world as well as internally. Soldiers often served in different regions and eventually settled far from their birthplace, while the development of mining attracted migration into the mining areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; The Romans founded numerous cities, such as [[Olisipo]] (Lisbon), [[Bracara Augusta]] (Braga), [[Aeminium]] (Coimbra) and [[Pax Julia]] (Beja),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portugalromano.com/category/cidades-romanas-em-portugal/|title=HugeDomains.com – PortugalRomano.com is for sale (Portugal Romano)|website=www.portugalromano.com|access-date=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and left important cultural legacies in what is now Portugal. [[Vulgar Latin]] (the basis of the Portuguese language) became the dominant language of the region, and Christianity spread throughout [[Lusitania]] from the third century.

In 409, with the decline of the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Iberian Peninsula]] was occupied by [[Germanic tribes]] that the Romans referred to as [[barbarians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UoryGn9o4x0C&amp;lpg=PP1 | title = The History of Portugal | isbn = 978-0-313-31106-2 | last1 = Anderson | first1 = James Maxwell | year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 411, with a federation contract with [[Emperor Honorius]], many of these people settled in [[Hispania]]. An important group was made up of the [[Suebi]] and [[Vandals]] in [[Gallaecia]], who founded a [[Kingdom of the Suebi|Suebi Kingdom]] with its capital in [[Braga]]. They came to dominate [[Aeminium]] ([[Coimbra]]) as well, and there were [[Visigoths]] to the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aGc2GwyvuEgC&amp;q=KOLLER%2C%20Erwin%2C%20Hugo%20Laitenberger&amp;pg=PR1 | title = Schwaben | isbn = 978-3-8233-5091-0 | last1 = Koller | first1 = Erwin | last2 = Laitenberger | first2 = Hugo | year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Suebi]] and the Visigoths were the Germanic tribes who had the most lasting presence in the territories corresponding to modern Portugal. As elsewhere in Western Europe, there was a sharp decline in urban life during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYn_f1jxNDoC&amp;lpg=PA138 | title = The Rise &amp; Fall of World Orders | isbn = 978-0-7190-4058-0 | last1 = Knutsen | first1 = Torbjörn L | year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman institutions disappeared in the wake of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] invasions with the exception of [[ecclesiastical]] organizations, which were fostered by the Suebi in the fifth century and adopted by the Visigoths afterwards. Although the Suebi and Visigoths were initially followers of [[Arianism]] and [[Priscillianism]], they adopted [[Catholicism]] from the local inhabitants. St. [[Martin of Braga]] was a particularly influential evangelist at this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google&quot; /&gt;

In 429, the Visigoths moved south to expel the [[Alans]] and [[Vandals]] and founded a kingdom with its capital in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. From 470, conflict between the Suebi and Visigoths increased. In 585, the Visigothic King [[Liuvigild]] conquered Braga and annexed Gallaecia. From that time, the [[Iberian Peninsula]] was unified under a [[Visigothic Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google&quot; /&gt;

With the Visigoths settled in the newly formed kingdom, a new class emerged that had been unknown in Roman times: a [[nobility]], which played a tremendous social and political role during the [[Middle Ages]]. It was also under the [[Visigoths]] that the Church began to play a very important part within the state. Since the Visigoths did not learn Latin from the local people, they had to rely on Catholic bishops to continue the Roman system of governance. The laws established during the Visigothic monarchy were thus made by councils of bishops, and the [[clergy]] started to emerge as a high-ranking class.

== Al Andalus (711–868) ==
{{Main|Al-Andalus}}
[[File:Map Iberian Peninsula 750-en.svg|thumb|Portugal part of [[Al-Andalus|Al-Andalus Province]] of [[Ummayad caliphate]] in 750.]]

During the caliphate of the Umayyad Caliph [[Al-Walid I]], the Berber commander [[Tariq ibn-Ziyad]] led a small force that landed at [[Gibraltar]] on 30 April 711, ostensibly to intervene in a [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] civil war. After a decisive victory over King [[Roderic]] at the [[Battle of Guadalete]] on 19 July 711, Tariq ibn-Ziyad, joined by the Arab governor [[Musa ibn Nusayr]] of [[Ifriqiya]], brought most of the Visigothic kingdom under Muslim occupation in a seven-year campaign. The Visigothic resistance to this invasion was ineffective, though sieges were required to sack a couple of cities. This is in part because the ruling Visigoth population is estimated at a mere 1 to 2% of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Características generales del poblamiento y la arqueología funeraria visigoda de Hispania |work=Espacio, Tiempo y Forma, S.

Indeed, it may have been equally welcome to the Hispano-Roman peasants who—as D.W. Lomax claims—were disillusioned by the prominent legal, linguistic and social divide between them and the 'barbaric' and 'decadent' Visigoth royal family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lomax|first=D.W.|title=The Reconquest of Spain|year=1978|publisher=Longman|pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Visigothic territories included what is today Spain, Portugal, Andorra, Gibraltar, and the southwestern part of France known in ancient times as [[Septimania]]. The invading Moors wanted to conquer and convert all of Europe to Islam, so they crossed the [[Pyrenees]] to use Visigothic [[Septimania]] as a base of operations. Muslims called their conquests in Iberia '[[al-Andalus]]' and in what was to become Portugal, they mainly consisted of the old Roman province of [[Lusitania]] (the central and southern regions of the country), while [[Gallaecia]] (the northern regions) remained unsubdued. Until the Berber revolt in the 730s, al-Andalus was treated as a dependency of Umayyad North Africa. Subsequently, links were strained until the caliphate was overthrown in the late 740s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Disney|2009|pp=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invading [[Medieval]] [[Muslim]] [[Moors]], who conquered and destroyed the Christian Visigothic kingdom in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], were mainly [[Berber people|Berbers]] from [[North Africa]], but they were joined by [[Arab]]s from the [[Middle East]].

By 714 [[Évora]], [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]] and [[Coimbra]] had been conquered, and two years later [[Lisbon]] was in Muslim control. By 718 most of today's Portuguese territory was under Umayyad rule. The Umayyads [[Battle of Tours|eventually stopped in Poitiers]] but [[Timeline of Muslim presence in Iberia|Muslim rule in Iberia]] would last until 1492 with the fall of the [[Granada|Kingdom of Granada]]. For the next several centuries, much of the Iberian Peninsula remained under Umayyad rule. Much of the populace was allowed to remain Christian, and many of the lesser feudal rulers worked out deals where they would submit to Umayyad rule in order to remain in power. They would pay a [[jizya]] tax, kill or turn over rebels, and in return receive support from the central government. But some regions, including Lisbon, [[Gharb Al-Andalus]], and the rest of what would become Portugal, rebelled, succeeded in freeing themselves by the early 10th century

== Reconquista ==
{{Main|Reconquista|History of Portugal (1139–1279)}}
[[File:Estatua de Don Pelayo en Covadonga, Asturias.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Monument of Pelagius at Covadonga where he won the [[Battle of Covadonga]] and initiated the Christian [[Reconquista]] of [[Iberia]] from the Islamic [[Moors]].]]

In 718 AD, a Visigothic noble named [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelagius]] was elected leader by many of the ousted [[Visigoth]] nobles. Pelagius called for the remnant of the Christian Visigothic armies to rebel against the Moors and re-group in the unconquered northern [[Asturias|Asturian]] highlands, better known today as the [[Cantabrian Mountains]], a mountain region in modern northwestern [[Spain]] adjacent to the [[Bay of Biscay]]. He planned to use the Cantabrian Mountain range as a place of refuge and protection from the invaders and as a springboard to reconquer lands from the Moors. After defeating the Moors in the [[Battle of Covadonga]] in 722 AD, Pelagius was proclaimed king to found the Christian [[Kingdom of Asturias]] and start the war of reconquest known in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) as the ''[[Reconquista]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Livermore|1969|pp=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, historians and archaeologists generally agree that northern Portugal between the Minho and the Douro rivers kept a significant share of its population, a social and political Christian area that until the late 9th century had no acting state powers. However, in the late 9th century, the region became part of a complex of powers, the [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galician]]-[[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturian]], [[Kingdom of Leon|Leonese]] and [[County of Portugal|Portuguese]] power structures.&lt;ref name=&quot;earlyportugal&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= O Norte de Portugal ente os séculos VIII e X: balanço e perspectivas de investigação | url= http://pt.scribd.com/doc/47457052/O-Norte-de-Portugal-ente-os-seculos-VIII-e-X-balanco-e-perspectivas-de-investigacao-Luis-Fontes-Unidade-de-Arqueologia-da-Universidade-do-Minho | access-date=April 19, 2013 | publisher = Archaeology Unit of the Minho University | author= Fontes, Luís|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Creation of the County of Portugal ===
At the end of the 9th century, a small minor county based in the area of [[Portus Cale]] was established by [[Vímara Peres]] on the orders of King [[Alfonso III of Asturias|Alfonso III]] of León, Galicia and Asturias. After annexing the County of Portugal into one of the several counties that made up its realms, King Alfonso III named Vímara Peres as its first count. Since the rule of Count [[Diogo Fernandes (count)|Diogo Fernandes]], the county increased in size and importance and, from the 10th century onward, with Count [[Gonçalo Mendes]] as ''Magnus Dux Portucalensium'' (Grand Duke of the Portuguese), the Portuguese counts started using the title of duke, indicating even larger importance and territory. The region became known simultaneously as ''Portucale'', ''Portugale'', and ''Portugalia''—the [[County of Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ribeiro|Hermano|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kingdom of Asturias was later divided as a result of dynastic disputes; the northern region of Portugal became part of the [[Kingdom of Galicia]] and later part of the [[Kingdom of León]].

Suebi-Visigothic arts and architecture, in particular sculpture, had shown a natural continuity with the Roman period. With the Reconquista, new artistic trends took hold, with Galician-Asturian influences more visible than the Leonese. The Portuguese group was characterized by a general return to classicism. The county courts of [[Viseu]] and [[Coimbra]] played a very important role in this process. Mozarabic architecture was found in the south, in Lisbon and beyond, while in the Christian realms Galician-Portuguese and Asturian architecture prevailed.&lt;ref name=&quot;earlyportugal&quot; /&gt;

In 968, the Vikings appeared in the rías of Galicia. They killed the bishop of Compostela in battle, but his successor St [[Rudesind]] rallied the forces of the region and finally killed the Viking leader, [[Gunrod]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Livermore |first1=H. V. |title=A New History of Portugal |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a vassal of the Kingdom of León, Portugal grew in power and territory and occasionally gained ''de facto'' independence during weak Leonese reigns; Count Mendo Gonçalves even became regent of the Kingdom of Leon between 999 and 1008. In 1070, the Portuguese Count [[Nuno Mendes (count)|Nuno Mendes]] desired the Portuguese title and fought the [[Battle of Pedroso]] on 18 February 1071 with [[Garcia II of Galicia]], who gained the Galician title, which included Portugal, after the 1065 partition of the Leonese realms. The battle resulted in Nuno Mendes' death and the declaration of Garcia as [[King of Portugal]], the first person to claim this title.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ribeiro|Hermano|2004|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garcia styled himself as &quot;King of Portugal and Galicia&quot; (''Garcia Rex Portugallie et Galleciae''). Garcia's brothers, [[Sancho II of Castile]] and [[Alfonso VI of Leon]], united and annexed Garcia's kingdom in 1071 as well. They agreed to split it among themselves; however, Sancho was killed by a noble the next year. Alfonso took Castile for himself and Garcia recovered his kingdom of Portugal and Galicia. In 1073, Alfonso VI gathered all power, and beginning in 1077, styled himself ''Imperator totius Hispaniæ'' (Emperor of All Hispania). When the emperor died, the Crown was left to his daughter [[Urraca of León|Urraca]], while his illegitimate daughter [[Teresa of León, Countess of Portugal|Teresa]] inherited the [[County of Portugal]]; in 1095, Portugal broke away from the [[Kingdom of Galicia]]. Its territories, consisting largely of mountains, moorland and forests, were bounded on the north by the Minho River, and on the south by the [[Mondego River]].

=== Foundation of the Kingdom of Portugal ===

At the end of the 11th century, the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] knight [[Henry, count of Portugal|Henry]] became count of Portugal and defended its independence by merging the [[County of Portugal]] and the [[County of Coimbra]]. His efforts were assisted by a civil war that raged between [[Kingdom of León|León]] and [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and distracted his enemies. Henry's son [[Afonso I of Portugal|Afonso Henriques]] took control of the county upon his death. The city of Braga, the unofficial Catholic centre of the Iberian Peninsula, faced new competition from other regions. Lords of the cities of [[Coimbra]] and [[Porto]] fought with [[Braga]]'s clergy and demanded the independence of the reconstituted county.

Portugal traces its national origin to 24 June 1128, the date of the [[Battle of São Mamede]]. Afonso proclaimed himself ''Prince of Portugal'' after this battle and in 1139, he assumed the title ''King of Portugal''. In 1143, the Kingdom of León recognised him as King of Portugal by the [[Treaty of Zamora]]. In 1179, the papal bull [[Manifestis Probatum]] of [[Pope Alexander III]] officially recognised Afonso I as king. After the [[Battle of São Mamede]], the first capital of Portugal was [[Guimarães]], from which the first king ruled. Later, when Portugal was already officially independent, he ruled from Coimbra.

=== Affirmation of Portugal ===
{{Main|History of Portugal (1279–1415)}}
The [[Algarve]], the southernmost region of Portugal, was finally conquered from the [[Moors]] in 1249, and in 1255 the capital shifted to [[Lisbon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Livermore|1969|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neighboring Spain would not complete its ''Reconquista'' [[Granada War|until 1492]], almost 250 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hallett|1970|pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portugal's land boundaries have been notably stable for the rest of the country's history. The border with Spain has remained almost unchanged since the 13th century. The [[Treaty of Windsor (1386)]] created an alliance between Portugal and [[Kingdom of England|England]] that remains in effect to this day. Since early times, fishing and overseas commerce have been the main economic activities.

[[File:Portuguese discoveries and explorationsV2en.png|thumb|500px|Portuguese discoveries and explorations: first arrival places and dates; main Portuguese [[spice trade]] routes in the [[Indian Ocean]] (blue); territories of the [[Portuguese Empire]] under [[King John III of Portugal|King John III]] rule (1521–1557) (green). The [[Theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia|disputed discovery of Australia]] is not shown.]]

During the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal became a leading European power that ranked with [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[France]] and [[Spain]] in terms of economic, political and cultural influence. Though not dominant in European affairs, Portugal did have an extensive colonial trading empire throughout the world backed by a powerful [[thalassocracy]].

The beginnings of the [[Portuguese Empire]] can be traced to 25 July 1415, when the Portuguese [[wikt:armada#Portuguese|Armada]] set sail for the rich [[Islamic]] trading center of [[Ceuta]] in [[North Africa]]. The Armada was accompanied by King [[John I of Portugal|John I]], his sons Prince [[Duarte of Portugal|Duarte]] (a future king), Prince [[Peter, Duke of Coimbra|Pedro]], and Prince [[Henry the Navigator]], and the legendary Portuguese hero [[Nuno Álvares Pereira]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Livermore|1969|pp=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 August 1415, [[Conquest of Ceuta|Ceuta was conquered by Portugal]], and the long-lived Portuguese Empire was founded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livermore_108&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Livermore|1969|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conquest of Ceuta was facilitated by a major civil war that had been engaging the Muslims of the [[Maghreb]] (North Africa) since 1411.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livermore_108&quot; /&gt; This civil war prevented a re-capture of Ceuta from the Portuguese, when the king of [[Granada]] [[Muhammed IX, Sultan of Granada|Muhammed IX]], the Left-Handed, laid siege to Ceuta and attempted to coordinate forces in Morocco and attract aid and assistance for the effort from Tunis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livermore_109&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Livermore|1969|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslim attempt to retake Ceuta was ultimately unsuccessful and Ceuta remained the first part of the new Portuguese Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livermore_109&quot; /&gt; Further steps were taken that would soon expand the Portuguese Empire much further.

In 1418, two of Prince [[Henry the Navigator]]'s captains, [[João Gonçalves Zarco]] and [[Tristão Vaz Teixeira]], were driven by a storm to an island that they called [[Porto Santo island|Porto Santo]] (&quot;Holy Port&quot;) in gratitude for their rescue from the shipwreck. In 1419, [[João Gonçalves Zarco]] disembarked on the [[Madeira Island|Island of Madeira]]. Uninhabited Madeira was colonized by the Portuguese in 1420.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livermore_109&quot; /&gt;

Between 1427 and 1431, most of the [[Azores Islands|Azores]] were discovered and these uninhabited islands were colonized by the Portuguese in 1445. Portuguese expeditions may have attempted to colonize the [[Canary Islands#Castilian conquest|Canary Islands]] as early as 1336, but the [[Crown of Castile]] objected to any Portuguese claim to them. Castile began its own conquest of the Canaries in 1402. Castile expelled the last Portuguese from the Canary islands in 1459, and they would eventually become part of the Spanish Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hallett|1970|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1434, [[Gil Eanes]] passed [[Cape Bojador]], south of [[Morocco]]. The trip marked the beginning of the Portuguese exploration of [[Africa]]. Before this event, very little was known in Europe about what lay beyond the cape. At the end of the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th, those who tried to venture there became lost, which gave birth to legends of [[sea monster]]s. Some setbacks occurred: in 1436 the [[Canary Islands#Castilian conquest|Canaries]] were officially recognized as Castilian by the pope—earlier they had been recognized as Portuguese; in 1438, the Portuguese were defeated in a military expedition to [[History of Tangier|Tangier]].

These setbacks did not deter the Portuguese from pursuing their exploratory efforts. In 1448, on the small island of [[Arguim]] off the coast of [[Mauritania]], an important castle was built to function as a ''[[Factory (trading post)|feitoria]]'', or trading post, for commerce with inland Africa. Some years before, the first African [[gold]] was brought to Portugal that circumvented the Arab caravans that crossed the Sahara. Some time later, the [[caravel]]s explored the [[Gulf of Guinea]], which led to the discovery of several uninhabited islands: [[Cape Verde]], [[São Tomé Island|São Tomé]], [[Principe Island|Príncipe]] and [[Annobón]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hallett|1970|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 November 1460, Prince Henry the Navigator died.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hallett_164&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Hallett|1970|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been the leading patron of maritime exploration by Portugal and immediately following his death, exploration lapsed. Henry's patronage had shown that profits could be made from the trade that followed the discovery of new lands. Accordingly, when exploration commenced again, private merchants led the way in attempting to stretch trade routes further down the African coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hallett_164&quot; /&gt;

In the 1470s, Portuguese trading ships reached the [[Portuguese Gold Coast|Gold Coast]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hallett_164&quot; /&gt; In 1471, the Portuguese captured Tangier, after years of attempts. Eleven years later, the fortress of [[São Jorge da Mina]] in the town of [[Elmina]] on the Gold Coast in the Gulf of Guinea was built. [[Christopher Columbus]] set sail aboard the fleet of ships taking materials and building crews to Elmina in December 1481. In 1483, [[Diogo Cão]] reached and explored the [[Congo River]].

=== Discovery of the sea route to India and the Treaty of Tordesillas ===
[[File:Vascodagama.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Vasco da Gama landing in [[Kerala, India]].]]
In 1484, Portugal officially rejected Columbus' idea of reaching [[India]] from the west, because it was seen as unfeasible. Some historians have claimed that the Portuguese had already performed fairly accurate calculations concerning the size of the world and therefore knew that sailing west to reach the Indies would require a far longer journey than navigating to the east. However, this continues to be debated. Thus began a long-lasting dispute that eventually resulted in the signing of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] with Castile in 1494. The treaty divided the (largely undiscovered) [[New World]] equally between the Portuguese and the Castilians, along a north–south [[prime meridian|meridian line]] 370 leagues (1770&amp;nbsp;km/1100 miles) west of the [[Cape Verde]] islands, with all lands to the east belonging to Portugal and all lands to the west to Castile.

[[File:Brazil-16-map.jpg|thumb|upright|Map of Brazil issued by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[explorer]]s in 1519.]]
With the expedition beyond the [[Cape of Good Hope]] by [[Bartolomeu Dias]] in 1487,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Livermore|1969|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; the richness of [[India]] was now accessible. Indeed, the cape takes its name from the promise of rich trade with the east. Between 1498 and 1501, [[Pêro de Barcelos]] and [[João Fernandes Lavrador]] explored [[North America]]. At the same time, [[Pêro da Covilhã]] reached [[Ethiopia]] by land. [[Vasco da Gama]] sailed for India and arrived at [[History of Kozhikode|Calicut]] on 20 May 1498, returning in glory to Portugal the next year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hallett_164&quot; /&gt; The [[Monastery of Jerónimos]] was built, dedicated to the discovery of the route to India.

At the end of the 15th century, Portugal [[Expulsion of Jews and Muslims from Portugal|expelled]] some local [[Sephardim|Sephardic Jews]], along with those refugees who had come from [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] after 1492. In addition, many Jews were forcibly converted to Catholicism and remained as ''[[converso]]s''. Many Jews remained [[Crypto-Jew|secretly Jewish]], in danger of persecution by the [[Portuguese Inquisition]]. In 1506, 3,000 [[New Christians]] were massacred in Lisbon.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Weiner, [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Portugal.html The Virtual Jewish History Tour Portugal]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1500, [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] set sail from Cape Verde with 13 ships and crews and nobles such as [[Nicolau Coelho]]; the explorer [[Bartolomeu Dias]] and his brother Diogo; [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] (author of the ''Esmeraldo''); nine chaplains; and some 1,200 men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livermore_138_139&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Livermore|1969|pp=138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Cape Verde, they sailed southwest across the Atlantic. On 22 April 1500, they caught sight of land in the distance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livermore_138_139&quot; /&gt; They disembarked and claimed this new land for Portugal. This was the coast of what would later become the Portuguese colony of [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Livermore_138_139&quot; /&gt;

The real goal of the expedition, however, was to open sea trade to the empires of the east. Trade with the east had effectively been cut off since the [[Conquest of Constantinople]] in 1453. Accordingly, Cabral turned away from exploring the coast of the new land of Brazil and sailed southeast, back across the Atlantic and around the Cape of Good Hope. Cabral reached [[Sofala]] on the east coast of Africa in July 1500.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livermore_138_139&quot; /&gt; In 1505, a Portuguese fort was established here and the land around the fort would later become the [[Portuguese Mozambique|Portuguese colony of Mozambique]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hallett|1970|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabral's fleet then sailed east and landed in [[Calicut]] in [[India]] in September 1500.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Livermore|1969|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here they traded for pepper and, more significantly, opened European sea trade with the empires of the east. No longer would the Muslim [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupation of [[Constantinople]] form a barrier between Europe and the east. Ten years later, in 1510, [[Afonso de Albuquerque]], after attempting and failing to capture and occupy [[Zamorin]]'s Calicut militarily, conquered [[Goa]] on the west coast of India.&lt;ref&gt;[[Percival Spear]], India: A Modern History (University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor, 1961) pp. 162–163.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[João da Nova]] discovered [[Ascension Island]] in 1501 and [[Saint Helena]] in 1502; [[Tristão da Cunha]] was the first to sight the archipelago still known by his name in 1506. In 1505, [[Francisco de Almeida]] was engaged to improve Portuguese trade with the far east. Accordingly, he sailed to East Africa. Several small Islamic states along the coast of [[Mozambique]]—[[Kilwa (district)|Kilwa]], [[Brava, Cape Verde|Brava]] and [[Mombasa]]—were destroyed or became subjects or allies of Portugal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livermore_140&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Livermore|1969|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almeida then sailed on to [[Kingdom of Cochin|Cochin]], made peace with the ruler and built a stone fort there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livermore_140&quot; /&gt;

{{Further|Portuguese Empire}}

By the 16th century, the two million people who lived in the original Portuguese lands ruled a vast empire with many millions of inhabitants in the Americas, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. From 1514, the Portuguese had reached [[China]] and [[Japan]]. In the [[Indian Ocean]] and [[Arabian Sea]], one of Cabral's ships discovered [[Madagascar]] (1501), which was partly explored by [[Tristão da Cunha]] (1507); [[Mauritius]] was discovered in 1507, [[Socotra]] occupied in 1506, and in the same year, [[Lourenço de Almeida]] visited [[Ceylon]].

In the [[Red Sea]], [[Massawa]] was the most northerly point frequented by the Portuguese until 1541, when a fleet under [[Estêvão da Gama (16th century)|Estevão da Gama]] penetrated as far as [[Suez]]. [[Hormuz Island|Hormuz]], in the [[Persian Gulf]], was seized by [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] in 1515, who also entered into diplomatic relations with [[Iran|Persia]]. In 1521, a force under [[António Correia (admiral)|Antonio Correia]] conquered [[Bahrain]] and ushered in a period of almost 80 years of Portuguese rule of the Persian Gulf archipelago&lt;ref&gt;Juan Cole, Sacred Space and Holy War, IB Tauris, 2007 p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Asiatic mainland, the first trading stations were established by [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] at Cochin and Calicut (1501). More important were the conquests of [[Portuguese conquest of Goa|Goa]] (1510) and [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|Malacca]] (1511) by [[Afonso de Albuquerque]], and the acquisition of [[Diu, India|Diu]] (1535) by [[Martim Afonso de Sousa]]. East of Malacca, Albuquerque sent [[Duarte Fernandes]] as envoy to Siam (now [[Thailand]]) in 1511 and dispatched to the Moluccas two expeditions (1512, 1514), which founded the Portuguese dominion in [[Maritime Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Livermore|1969|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese established their base in the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] on the island of [[Ambon Island|Ambon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brown|2003|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fernão Pires de Andrade]] visited [[Guangzhou|Canton]] in 1517 and opened up trade with China, where, in 1557, the Portuguese were permitted to occupy [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]]. [[Japan]], accidentally reached by three Portuguese traders in 1542, soon attracted large numbers of merchants and missionaries. In 1522, one of the ships in the expedition that [[Ferdinand Magellan]] organized in the Spanish service completed the first [[circumnavigation]] of the globe.

One of the claimants to the throne, [[António, Prior of Crato]], a bastard son of [[Infante Louis, Duke of Beja]], and only grandson through the male line of king [[Manuel I of Portugal]], lacked support from the clergy and most of the nobility, but was acclaimed as king in Santarém and in some other towns in June 1580.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztTaanw3B2UC&amp;pg=PA120|title=Castro|first=António|last=Ferreira|date=14 April 1987|publisher=UC Biblioteca Geral 1|access-date=14 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7nVIBhrRb9AC&amp;pg=PA90|title=The Making of an Enterprise: The Society of Jesus in Portugal, Its Empire, and Beyond, 1540–1750|first=Dauril|last=Alden|date=14 April 1996|publisher=Stanford University Press|access-date=14 April 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780804722711}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip II of Spain]], through his mother [[Isabella of Portugal]], also a grandson of Manuel I, claimed the Portuguese throne and did not recognize António as king of Portugal. The king appointed [[Fernando Alvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba]], as captain general of his army.&lt;ref&gt;Disposition of Philip II about giving the duke the control of the army, op. cit., [https://archive.org/details/coleccindedocu32madruoft vol.

'''Ecological selection''' (or '''environmental selection''' or '''survival selection''' or '''individual selection''' or '''asexual selection''') refers to [[natural selection]] without [[sexual selection]], i.e. strictly ecological processes that operate on a [[species]]' inherited traits without reference to mating or secondary sex characteristics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  The variant names describe varying circumstances where sexual selection is wholly suppressed as a mating factor.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Ecologists often study ecological selection when examining the abundance of individuals per population across regions, and what governs such abundances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCoughlin|first1=Phillip D.|last2=Morris|first2=Douglas W.|last3=Fortin|first3=Daniel|last4=Vander Wal|first4=Eric|last5=Contasti|first5=Adrienne L.|title=Considering ecological dynamics in resource selection functions|journal=Journal of Animal Ecology|date=January 1, 2010|volume=79|issue=1|pages=4–12|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01613.x|pmid=19732211}}{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Circumstances in which it occurs==
Ecological selection can be said to be taking place in any circumstance where inheritance of specific traits is determined by ecology alone without direct sexual competition, when e.g. sexual competition is strictly ecological or economic, there is little or no mate choice, females do not resist any male who wishes to mate, all traits will be equally propagated regardless of mating, or the species is hermaphroditic or asexually reproducing, an ecological selection is taking place. For example, environmental pressures are largely responsible for the evolution of different life history strategies between the African honey bee, [[African honey bee|''A. m. scutellata'']], and the [[Western honey bee|European honey bee]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fewell and Bertram, 2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fewell|first=Jennifer H.|author2=Susan M. Bertram|title=Evidence for genetic variation in worker task performance by African and European honeybees|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|year=2002|volume=52|issue=4|pages=318–25|doi=10.1007/s00265-002-0501-3|s2cid=22128779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]] species, it is applicable mostly to situations where ecological pressures prevent most competitors from reaching maturity, or where crowding or pair-bonding or an extreme suppression of sexual selection factors prevents the normal sexual competition rituals and selection from taking place, but which also prevent [[artificial selection]] from operating, e.g. arranged marriages, where parents rather than the young select the mate based on economic or even astrological factors, and where the sexual desires of the mated pair are often subordinated to these factors, are artificial unless ''wholly'' based on an ecological factor such as control of land which is held by their own force.

In forests, ecological selection can be witnessed involving many factors such as available sunlight, soil quality, and the surrounding [[biota (ecology)|biota]].  During forest growth, tree seedlings in particular, are ecosystem pioneers, and different tree seedlings can often react to a number of members in their ecological community in completely different ways, thus providing a spectrum of ecological occupations.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marks|first1=C.O.|last2=Conti|first2=E.|title=The causes of variation in tree seedling traits: the roles of environmental selection versus chance|journal=Evolution|date=2007|volume=61|issue=2|pages=455–469|doi=10.1111/j.1742-4658.2007.00021.x|pmid=17348954|s2cid=23528064}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, adult trees can heavily impact their ecological communities, reversing the roles of ecological selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=B.V.|last2=Spurr|first2=S.H.|title=Forest Ecology|date=1980|publisher=Wiley|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elements of the soil are an extremely influential selective factor in forest growth.  Throughout time, every species of tree has evolved to grow under specific soil conditions, whether it is dependent on the [[pH]] levels, the mineral contents, or the drainage levels.  Each of these is a vehicle for ecological selection to do its work in the course of [[evolution]].  However, ecological selection can be much more specific, not only working within species but within populations, even populations in the same region.  For example, scientists in [[Quebec]] recently examined how tree seedlings react to different nitrate levels.  What they found was that areas with higher nitrate levels contained plants that could much more efficiently metabolize nitrogen.  Such plants could perform [[photosynthesis]] and [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] at a much faster rate than their nitrogen lacking peers, and also had longer root lengths on average, giving them an evolutionary advantage for their [[habitat]].  Nitrogen levels that are unexpectedly too high could harm some tree species, but these particular specimens created a [[Ecological niche|niche]] for themselves, and could outcompete others around them.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; A site of tree growth can also be influenced by slope, rockiness, climate, and available sunlight.  Space is initially available to everything, but seedlings that can most quickly inhabit the soil and take advantage of the available nutrients are usually most successful.  Generally, one of the first factors to control which species grow best in the soil is the amount of sunlight.  Soil and water themselves are both very important (For instance, a dry hardwood such as a white oak will not grow in a swamp), but sunlight is the initial decider in forest succession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Park|first1=A.|last2=Van|first2=B.M.|last3=Ashton|first3=M.S.|last4=Wishnie|first4=M.|last5=Mariscal|first5=E.|last6=Deago|first6=J.|last7=Ibarra|first7=D.|last8=Hall|first8=J.S.|title=Local and regional environmental variation influences the growth of tropical trees in selection trials in the Republic of Panama|doi=10.1016/j.foreco.2010.03.021 |journal=Forest Ecology and Management|date=2012|volume=260|issue=1|pages=12–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shade intolerant trees can immediately grow impressively.  They need the sunlight that is offered by an open canopy found in a bare environment.  Selection weeds out the seedlings that can not handle full sun, thus tall, straight trees will eventually grow and develop a full, lush canopy.  However, these behaviors will soon be reversed.  [[Seedlings]] that were once removed by ecological selection now become favored, because the shaded forest floor has become ideal for such shade tolerant species.  This is a great example of how ecological selection can create niches for different species by performing the same function with different outcomes.

==Vs. sexual selection==
In cases where ecological and sexual selection factors are strongly at odds, simultaneously encouraging and discouraging the same traits, it may also be important to distinguish them as sub-processes within natural selection.

For instance, ''Ceratogaulus'', the [[Oligocene]] [[horned gopher]], left in the fossil record a series of individuals with successively longer and longer horns, that seemed to be unrelated or maladaptive to its ecological niche.  Some modern scientists have theorized that the horns were useful or impressive in mating rituals among males (although other scientists dispute this theory, pointing out that the horns were not [[sexually dimorphic]]) and that it was an example of [[runaway evolution]].  The species seems to have suddenly died out when horns reached approximately the body length of the animal itself, possibly because it could no longer run or evade predators—thus ecological selection seems to have ultimately trumped sexual. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

It is also important to distinguish ecological selection in cases of extreme ecological abundance, e.g. the human [[built environment]], cities or zoos, where [[sexual selection]] must generally predominate, as there is no threat of the species or individuals losing their [[ecological niche]].  Even in these situations, however, where survival is not in question, the variety and the quality of food, e.g. as presented by male to female monkeys in exchange for sex in some species, still influences reproduction, however it becomes a sexual selection factor. Similar phenomena can be said to exist in humans e.g. the &quot;[[mail order bride]]&quot; who primarily mates for economic advantage.

Differentiating ecological selection from sexual is useful especially in such extreme cases;  Above examples demonstrate exceptions rather than a typical selection in the wild.  In general, ecological selection is assumed to be the dominant process in [[natural selection]], except in highly cognitive species that do not, or do not always, pair bond, e.g. [[walrus]], [[gorilla]], [[human]].  But even in these species, one would distinguish cases where isolated populations had no real choice of mates, or where the vast majority of individuals died before sexual maturity, leaving only the ecologically selected survivor to mate—regardless of its sexual fitness under normal [[sexual selection]] processes for that species.

For example, if only a few closely related males survive a natural disaster, and all are able to mate very widely due to lack of males, sexual selection has been suppressed by an ecological selection (the disaster).  Such situations are usually temporary, characteristic of populations under extreme stress, for relatively short terms.  However, they can drastically affect populations in that short time, sometimes eliminating all individuals susceptible to a [[pathogen]], and thereby rendering all survivors immune.  A few such catastrophic events where ecological selection predominates can lead to a population with specific advantages, e.g. in [[colonization]] when invading populations from more crowded disease-prone conditions arrive with antibodies to diseases, and the diseases themselves, which proceed to wipe out natives, clearing the way for the colonists.

In humans, the intervention of artificial devices such as ships or blankets may be enough to make some consider this an example of [[artificial selection]].  However it is clearly observed in other species, it seems unreasonable to differentiate colonization by ship from colonization by walking, and even the word &quot;colony&quot; is not specific to humans but refers generically to an intrusion of one species on an ecology to which it has not wholly adapted.  So, despite the potential controversy, it may be better to consider all examples of colonist-borne diseases to be ecological selection.

For another example, in a region devastated by [[nuclear radiation]], such as the [[Bikini Atoll]], capacity to survive [[gamma ray]]s to sexual maturity and (for the female) to term is a key ecological selection factor, although it is neither &quot;[[natural selection|natural]]&quot; nor sexual.  Some would call this too [[artificial selection]], not natural or ecological, as the radiation does not enter the ecology as a factor save due to man's effort.  Ambiguous artificial-plus-ecological factors may reasonably be called &quot;[[Environment (biophysical)|environmental]]&quot;, and the term '''environmental selection''' may be preferable in these cases.

'''Magnus Maximus''' ({{IPA-la|ˈmaŋnus ˈmaksimus|lang}}; {{lang-cy|Macsen Wledig}} {{IPA-cy|ˈmaksɛn ˈwlɛdɪɡ|}}; {{circa|lk=no|335}}{{ndash}}28 August 388) was [[Roman emperor]] in the western portion of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] from 383 to 388. He usurped the throne from emperor [[Gratian]] in 383, through negotiation with emperor [[Theodosius I]].

He was made emperor in [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] and [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]] the next year while Gratian's brother [[Valentinian II]] retained [[Roman Italy|Italy]], [[Pannonia]], [[Hispania]], and [[Africa Province|Africa]]. In 387, Maximus's ambitions led him to invade Italy, resulting in his defeat by [[Theodosius I]] at the [[Battle of Poetovio]] in 388. In the view of some historians, his death marked the end of direct imperial presence in Northern Gaul and Britain.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The New Cambridge Medieval History: {{circa|lk=no|500}}{{ndash}}{{circa|lk=no|700}}&quot; by Paul Fouracre, Rosamond McKitterick, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Maximus was born {{circa|lk=no|335}} in [[Gallaecia]], on the estates of [[Count Theodosius]] (the Elder), to whom he claimed to be related.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Cambridge Medieval History 1924 p. 238&quot;&gt;J B Bury ed., ''The Cambridge Medieval History'' (Cambridge 1924) p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; Maximus was the son of the general [[Flavius Julius Eucherius]] and the brother of Marcellinus. Near contemporaries described his dignity as offended when lesser men were promoted to high positions.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Maximus was a distinguished general; he served under Count Theodosius in Africa in 373, and on the [[Danube]] in 376, where his behaviour was however described as greedy and reckless.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''The Later Roman Empire''(Penguin 1986) p. 417&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely he was a junior officer in Britain in 368, during the quelling of the [[Great Conspiracy]]. Assigned to [[Roman Britain|Britain]] in 380, he defeated an incursion of the [[Picts]] and [[Gaels|Scots]] in 381.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Cambridge Medieval History 1924 p. 238&quot;/&gt;

The Western emperor [[Gratian]] had become unpopular because of perceived favouritism toward [[Alans]]{{mdash}}an [[Indo-Iranian languages|Iranian]] speaking people (see also [[Sarmatians]] and [[Ossetians]]) who were early adopters of [[Christianity]] and migrated both east and west from their homeland{{mdash}}over Roman citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Cambridge Medieval History 1924 p. 238&quot;/&gt;

In 383 Maximus was proclaimed emperor by his troops. He went to [[Gaul]] to pursue his imperial ambitions, taking a large portion of the British garrison with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Cambridge Medieval History 1924 p. 238&quot;/&gt;

Following his landing in Gaul, Maximus went out to meet Gratian, whom he defeated after five days skirmishing near [[Paris]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Cambridge Medieval History 1924 p. 238&quot;/&gt; Gratian fled and was killed at [[Lyon]] on 25 August 383. Continuing his campaign into [[Italy]], Maximus was stopped from overthrowing [[Valentinian II]], who was only twelve, when [[Theodosius I]], the Emperor in the East, sent [[Flavius Bauto]] with a powerful force to forestall him. Negotiations followed in 384 including the intervention of [[Ambrose]], Bishop of Milan, leading to an accord with Valentinian II and Theodosius I in which Maximus was recognized as [[Augustus (rank)|Augustus]] in the West.&lt;ref&gt;D Divine, ''The North-West Frontier of Rome'' (London 1969) p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

Maximus made his capital at [[History of Trier#Roman Empire|Augusta Treverorum]] (Treves, [[Trier]]) in Gaul, and ruled Britain, Gaul, Spain and Africa. He issued coinage and a number of edicts reorganising Gaul's system of provinces. Some scholars believe Maximus may have founded the office of the [[Comes Britanniarum]] as well.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} He became a popular emperor; [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus]] delivered a [[panegyric]] on Maximus's virtues. He used ''foederati'' forces such as the [[Alamanni]] to great effect. He was also a stern persecutor of [[heresy|heretics]].

It was on his orders that [[Priscillian]] and six companions were executed for [[heresy]], in this case of [[Priscillianism]], although the actual civil charges laid by Maximus himself were for the practice of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. These executions went ahead despite protests against the involvement of the secular power by prominent men such as [[Ambrose|St. Ambrose]] and [[St. Martin of Tours]].&lt;ref&gt;A Momigliano, ''Essays in Ancient and Modern Historiography'' (Oxford 1977) p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Maximus thereby not only established his credentials as an upholder of orthodoxy, but also strengthened his financial resources in the ensuing confiscations.&lt;ref&gt;K Cooper ed., ''Making Early Medieval Societies'' (2016) p. 34 and p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Maximus's edict of 387 or 388, which censured Christians at Rome for burning down a Jewish [[synagogue]], was condemned by bishop [[Ambrose]], who said people exclaimed, ‘the emperor has become a Jew’.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, Patrologia Latina, 16–17 (1845), nos. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

In 387 Maximus managed to force emperor [[Valentinian II]] out of [[Milan]], after which he fled to [[Theodosius I]].
Theodosius and Valentinian then invaded from the east, and campaigned against Maximus in July–August 388, their troops being led by [[Richomeres]] and other generals. Maximus was defeated in the [[Battle of Poetovio]],&lt;ref&gt;Pan. Lat. II.34&lt;/ref&gt; and retreated to [[Aquileia]]. Meanwhile, the [[Franks]] under [[Marcomer]] had taken the opportunity to invade northern Gaul, at the same time further weakening Maximus's position.

[[Andragathius]], ''[[magister equitum]]'' of Maximus and the killer of Emperor Gratian, was defeated near [[Siscia]], while Maximus's brother, Marcellinus, fell in battle at [[Poetovio]].&lt;ref&gt;Pan. Lat. II.35-6&lt;/ref&gt; Maximus surrendered in Aquileia, and although he pleaded for mercy was executed. The Senate passed a decree of ''[[Damnatio memoriae]]'' against him. However, his mother and at least two daughters were spared.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, Ep. 40.32&lt;/ref&gt; Theodosius's trusted general [[Arbogast (magister militum)|Arbogast]] strangled Maximus's son, [[Flavius Victor]], at Trier in the fall of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Wise Bauer, &quot;The History of the Medieval World: From the Conversion of Constantine to the First Crusade&quot;, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 22 Feb 2010 (p.68)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fate of family===

What exactly happened to Maximus's family after his downfall is not recorded. He is known to have had a wife, who is recorded as having sought spiritual counsel from [[St. Martin of Tours]] during his time at Trier. Her ultimate fate, and even her name (but see the Welsh tradition below), have not been preserved in definitive historic records. The same is true of Maximus's mother and daughters, other than that they were spared by Theodosius I.

One of Maximus's daughters may have been married to Ennodius,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Drinkwater |first1=John (ed.) |last2=Elton |first2=Hugh (ed.) |title=Fifth-Century Gaul: A Crisis of Identity? |date=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-41485-7 |page=118 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lHGOvpQfFqcC&amp;pg=PA118 |access-date=Jan 13, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; proconsul Africae (395). Ennodius's grandson was [[Petronius Maximus]], another ill-fated emperor, who ruled in Rome for only 77 days before he was stoned to death while fleeing from the Vandals on 24 May 455. Other descendants of Ennodius, and thus possibly of Maximus, included [[Olybrius|Anicius Olybrius]], emperor in 472, but also several consuls and bishops such as [[Magnus Felix Ennodius|St. Magnus Felix Ennodius]] (Bishop of [[Pavia]] {{circa|lk=no|514}}-21).  We also encounter an otherwise unrecorded daughter of Magnus Maximus, [[Sevira]], on the [[Pillar of Eliseg]], an early medieval inscribed stone in Wales which claims her marriage to [[Vortigern]], king of the Britons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Laycock |first1=Stuart |title=Warlords: The Struggle for Power in Post-Roman Britain |date=2011 |publisher=The History Press |isbn=978-0-7524-7560-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RrkTDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT65 |access-date=Jan 13, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in British and Breton history ==
Maximus's bid for imperial power in 383 coincides with the last date for any evidence of a Roman military presence in Wales, the western [[Pennines]], and the fortress of [[Chester|Deva]]. Coins dated later than 383 have been found in excavations along [[Hadrian's Wall]], suggesting that troops were not entirely stripped from it, as was once thought.&lt;ref name=Frere1&gt;{{Citation

Having left with the troops and senior administrators, and planning to continue as the ruler of Britain in the future, his practical course was to transfer local authority to local rulers. Welsh legend supports that this happened, with stories such as ''Breuddwyd Macsen Wledig'' (English: The Dream of Emperor Maximus), where he not only marries a wondrous British woman (thus making British descendants probable), but also gives her father sovereignty over Britain (thus formally transferring authority from Rome back to the Britons themselves).

The earliest Welsh genealogies give Maximus (referred to as ''Macsen/Maxen Wledig'', or ''Emperor Maximus'') the role of founding father of the dynasties of several medieval Welsh kingdoms, including those of [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]] and [[Kingdom of Gwent|Gwent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is given as the ancestor of a Welsh king on the [[Pillar of Eliseg]], erected nearly 500 years after he left Britain, and he figures in lists of the [[Fifteen Tribes of Wales]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rachel Bromwich 2006&quot;&gt;Rachel Bromwich, editor and translator. Trioedd Ynys Prydein: The Welsh Triads. Cardiff: [[University of Wales Press]], Third Edition, 2006. 441-444&lt;/ref&gt;

After he became emperor of the West, Maximus returned to Britain to campaign against the [[Picts]] and Scots (i.e., Irish), probably in support of Rome's long-standing allies the [[Damnonii]], [[Votadini]], and [[Novantae]] (all located in modern [[Scotland]]). While there he likely made similar arrangements for a formal transfer of authority to local chiefs&amp;mdash;the later rulers of [[Galloway]], home to the Novantae, claimed Maximus as the founder of their line, the same as did the Welsh kings.&lt;ref name=Frere1/&gt;

The ninth century ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' gives another account of Maximus and assigns him an important role:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The seventh emperor was Maximianus, He withdrew from Britain with all its military force, slew Gratianus the king of the Romans, and obtained the sovereignty of all Europe. Unwilling to send back his warlike companions to their wives, families, and possessions in Britain, he conferred upon them numerous districts from the lake on the summit of Mons Iovis, to the city called Cant Guic, and to the western Tumulus, that is Cruc Occident. These are the Armoric Britons, and they remain there to the present day. In consequence of their absence, Britain being overcome by foreign nations, the lawful heirs were cast out, till God interposed with his assistance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Modern historians believe that this idea of mass British troop settlement in [[Brittany]] by Maximus may very well reflect some reality, as it accords with archaeological and other historical evidence and later Breton traditions.

[[Armorica]] declared independence from the Roman Empire in 407 CE, but contributed archers for [[Flavius Aetius]]'s defence against [[Attila]] the Hun, and its king [[Riothamus]] was subsequently mentioned in contemporary documents as an ally of Rome's against the [[Goths]]. Despite its continued usage of two distinct languages, Breton and Gallo, and extensive invasions and conquests by Franks and Vikings, Armorica retained considerable cultural cohesion into the 13th century.

Maximus also established a military base in his native [[Gallaecia]], i.e., [[Galicia (Spain)]], which persisted as a cultural entity despite occupation by the [[Suebi]] in 409, see [[Kingdom of Galicia]]. This kingdom successfully resisted the Moors and subsequently initiated the Spanish [[Reconquista]].{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Aetius sent large numbers of [[Alans]] to both Armorica and Galicia following the defeat of Attila at the [[Battle of the Catalunian Plains]]. The Alans evidently assimilated quickly into the local Celtic cultures, contributing their own legends, e.g., to the Arthurian Cycle of romances.

==Welsh legend==
Legendary versions of Maximus's career in which he marries the Welsh princess [[Elen Luyddog|Elen]] may have circulated in popular tradition in Welsh-speaking areas from an early date. Although the story of Helen and Maximus's meeting is almost certainly fictional, there is some evidence for the basic claims. He is certainly given a prominent place in the earliest version of the [[Welsh Triads]] which are believed to date from {{circa|lk=no|1100}} and which reflect older traditions in some cases. Welsh poetry also frequently refers to Macsen as a figure of comparison with later Welsh leaders. These legends come down to us in two separate versions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rachel Bromwich 2006&quot;/&gt;

=== Geoffrey of Monmouth ===

{{wikisource|History of the Kings of Britain/Book 5}}
According to [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s fictional ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' ({{circa|lk=no|1136}}), the basis for many English and Welsh legends, Maximianus, as he calls him, was a Roman senator, a nephew of [[Coel Hen]] through Coel's brother Ioelinus, and king of the [[Celtic Britons|Britons]] following the death of Octavius ([[Eudaf Hen]]). Geoffrey writes this came about because Octavius wanted to wed his daughter to just such a powerful half-Roman-half-Briton and to give the kingship of Britain, as a dowry, to that husband, so he sent a message to Rome offering his daughter to Maximian.&lt;ref&gt;G Monmouth, ''The History of the Kings of Britain'' (Penguin 1966) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caradocus]], the [[List of legendary rulers of Cornwall|Duke of Cornwall]], had suggested and supported the marriage between Octavius's daughter and Maximian. Maximian accepted the offer and left Rome for Britain. Geoffrey claims further that Maximian gathered an army as he sacked [[Franks|Frankish]] towns along the way. He invaded Clausentum (modern [[Southampton]]) unintentionally and nearly fought the army of the Britons under [[Conan Meriadoc]] before agreeing to a truce. Following further negotiations, Maximian was given the kingship of Britain and Octavius retired. Five years into his kingship, Magnus Maximus assembled a vast fleet and invaded [[Gaul]], leaving Britain in the control of Caradocus.&lt;ref&gt;G Monmouth, ''The History of the Kings of Britain'' (Penguin 1966) p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Upon reaching the kingdom of [[Armorica]] (historically, the region between the Loire and Seine rivers, later comprising Brittany, Normandy, Anjou, Maine and Touraine), he defeated the king and killed thousands of inhabitants. Before departing to Rome, he summoned [[Conan Meriadoc|Conanus]], the rebellious nephew of Octavius, and asked him to rule as king of the land, which was renamed [[Brittany]]. Conan's men married native women after cutting out their tongues to preserve the purity of their language. [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] presents this legend to explain the Welsh name for Brittany, Llydaw, as originating from ''lled-taw'' or &quot;half-silent&quot;. Given that Conan was well established in genealogies as the founder of Brittany, this account is certainly connected to an older tradition than Geoffrey.

Following the death of Caradocus, rule of Britain as regent passed to [[Dionotus]], who &amp;ndash; facing a foreign invasion &amp;ndash; appealed to Maximus, who finally sent a man named [[Gracianus Municeps]] with two legions to stop the attack. He killed many thousands before the invaders fled to [[Ireland]]. Maximus died in [[Rome]] soon after and Dionotus became the official king of the Britons. Unfortunately, before he could begin his reign, Gracianus took hold of the crown and made himself king over Dionotus.

While a broadly positive account of Maximian, the ''History'' concludes with the success of the barbarian invaders, and laments, &quot;Alas for the absence of so many warlike soldiers through the madness of Maximianus!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;G Monmouth, ''The History of the Kings of Britain'' (Penguin 1966) p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Dream of Macsen Wledig===
{{wikisource|The Mabinogion/The Dream of Maxen Wledig|The Dream of Maxen Wledig}}
{{main|The Dream of Macsen Wledig}}

Although the ''[[Mabinogion]]'' tale ''The Dream of Macsen Wledig'' is written in later manuscripts than Geoffrey's version, the two accounts are so different that scholars agree the Dream cannot be based purely on Geoffrey's version. The Dream's account also seems to accord better with details in the Triads, so it perhaps reflects an earlier tradition.

Macsen Wledig, the Emperor of Rome, dreams one night of a lovely maiden in a wonderful, far-off land. Awakening, he sends his men all over the earth in search of her. With much difficulty they find her in a rich castle in Wales, daughter of a chieftain based at [[Segontium Roman Fort|Segontium]] ([[Caernarfon]]), and lead the Emperor to her. Everything he finds is exactly as in his dream. The maiden, whose name is [[Helen of the Hosts|Helen]] or Elen, accepts and loves him. Because Elen is found a virgin, Macsen gives her father sovereignty over the island of Britain and orders three castles built for his bride.&lt;ref&gt;S Davies trans, ''Mabinogion'' (Oxford 2007) p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

In Macsen's absence, a new emperor seizes power and warns him not to return. With the help of men from Britain led by Elen's brother [[Conan Meriadoc|Conanus]] (''[[Welsh language|Welsh]]'': Cynan Meriadoc, ''[[Breton language|Breton]]'': Conan Meriadeg), Macsen marches across Gaul and Italy and recaptures Rome. In gratitude to his British allies, Macsen rewards them with a portion of Gaul that becomes known as Brittany.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

His love Helen (Elen) was travelling along the Roman roads in a Snowdonian valley when she was given grevious news over her husband. Near a well she bent to her knees and cried &quot;croes awr I mi yw hon&quot; translated &quot;a cross hour for me is this&quot;, and laid down and died. The village was named Croesor, a Snowdonian village nestled on the knees of the Welsh [[Matterhorn]], Y Cnicht. This is why the village was called Croesor, and although it is close in a sense to Caernarfon, it is a fair way onto the valleys and mountains of Snowdonia. Croesor Primary School had the full fable drawn by the children in the 70's in a pottery tile mural spanning the length of the small school; this was there from when it was made until the school was sold for private use, the school was closed to the lack of pupils, but the story of Helen, or Elen, lived on through each child that passed through this school and village.

=== Performance ===
PICA has presented works from performance artists and musicians such as [[Philip Glass]], [[Laurie Anderson]], [[Karen Finley]], [[Spalding Gray]], [[Marina Abramović]], [[Miranda July]], [[Mike Daisey]], and [[Reggie Watts]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pica.org/artists/|title=PICA Artists Archive|website=Portland Institute for Contemporary Art (PICA)|access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, PICA has programmed both performances and exhibitions, while also hosting educational events such as lectures, public conversations, and artist-led workshops. Its first performance series ran from 1995-1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pica.org/event/1995-1996-performance-season/|title=1995–1996 Performance Season - PICA|newspaper=PICA|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; PICA ceased its seasonal performance series when it began presenting the [[Time-Based Art Festival]] in 2003, though still presents some performances during other parts of the year.

=== Visual Art ===
PICA has presented work by renowned visual artists such as [[William Pope.L]], [[Matthew Day Jackson]], [[Francis Alÿs]], [[Emily Roysdon]], [[A.L. Steiner]], [[Erika Vogt]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pica.org/artists/|title=Artist Index|website=Portland Institute for Contemporary Art|access-date=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2005, PICA's visual art programming has been curated by [[Kristan Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pnca.edu/people/meet/kristan-kennedy-1|title=Kristan Kennedy – Assistant Professor|website=[[Pacific Northwest College of Art]]|language=en|access-date=January 16, 2019|quote=Kennedy has been curating programming, artist residencies, publishing, lecturing and teaching since 2005 when she started programming visual art, multidisciplinary, performance and music for the TBA Festival and returned PICA to full program of year round exhibitions and public programming in 2012.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with PICA's itinerant model to performance presentation, the organization has not had a single exhibition space for most of its history. From 2000–2004, PICA did run a year-round gallery out of a corner of the [[Wieden+Kennedy]] Building in Northwest Portland's [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], designed by early PICA supporter [[Brad Cloepfil]]. During that time, visual art curator Stuart Horodner presented work from artists such as [[Janine Antoni]], [[Dana Schutz]], and [[Melanie Manchot]] in the space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.portlandart.net/archives/2012/04/picas_new_headq.html|title=PORT: portlandart.net - Portland art + news + reviews|website=www.portlandart.net|access-date=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horodner left the organization in 2004.

The [[Time-Based Art Festival]] has included visual art curated by Kennedy as part of its artistic program since 2006 under the &quot;On Sight&quot; program strand. On Sight exhibition programs often include performance-based or otherwise non-conventional visual art modes in addition to traditional gallery spaces. The exhibition-based visual art projects are generally exhibited for two to four weeks after the conclusion of each year's TBA. In 2016, the On Sight exhibition was titled &quot;Makeup on Empty Space&quot; and included a multi-channel video installation by [[A.K. Burns]], a performance art piece by Keijaun Thomas, a performance by Dylan Mira, and an exhibition-turned-artist-residency by [[Bunny Brains]] and collaborators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pica.org/event/makeup-empty-space/|title=Makeup on Empty Space - PICA|newspaper=PICA|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Community Engagement, Education and Public Programs ==
PICA offers a variety of education, outreach, contextual and public programs, often presented in tandem with its artistic programs but sometimes independent of them. As part of the annual TBA Festival, PICA offers an education, engagement, and public programs strand called the &quot;Institute&quot; that brings festival artists, guest scholars, and writers into dialogue. Institute programming includes workshops, discussions, panels, lectures, and (since 2013) the Field Guide series, in which expert facilitates engage in focused workshops and dialogues with members of the public about a particular performance or program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pica.org/programs/institute/|title=Institute - PICA|newspaper=PICA|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Precipice Fund ===
In 2011, PICA announced that the organization had received money from the [[Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts]]' Regional Regranting Program to create a regranting program for small, artist-led visual art projects that do not otherwise qualify for project support through traditional granting mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pica.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/130122_PrecipiceFund_PR.pdf|title=PICA LAUNCHES THE PRECIPICE FUND, A NEW REGIONAL VISUAL ART GRANT, WITH SUPPORT FROM THE ANDY WARHOL FOUNDATION FOR THE VISUAL ARTS|last=Leonard|first=Patrick|date=January 22, 2013|website=PICA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dubbed the Precipice Fund, PICA began distributing its first round of grants in 2013. As of 2016, $225,000 has been redistributed over three grant periods to 57 projects in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pica.org/precipice-fund/2013-grant-recipients/|title=2013 Grant Recipients - PICA|newspaper=PICA|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resource Room ===
Since 2000, PICA's offices have included a public reference library known as the Resource Room. The PICA Resource Room collects a variety of art publications, housing over 4,000 books and periodicals on its shelves. The Resource Room also collects video documentation from the organization's 20-year history of artistic presentation. From 2012–2015, the Resource Room Residency gave artists the opportunity to engage with the space and collection of archival materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pica.org/programs/resource-room/|title=Resource Room - PICA|newspaper=PICA|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SoftICE''' is a [[kernel mode]] [[debugger]] for [[DOS]] and [[Windows]] up to Windows XP. Crucially, it is designed to run underneath Windows such that the [[operating system]] is unaware of its presence. Unlike an application debugger, SoftICE is capable of suspending all operations in Windows when instructed. For driver debugging this is critical due to how hardware is accessed and the kernel of the operating system functions. Because of its low-level capabilities, SoftICE is also popular as a [[software cracking]] tool.

Microsoft offers two [[kernel (computing)|kernel]]-mode debuggers, [[WinDbg]] and [[KD (debugger)|KD]], for no charge. However, the full capabilities of WinDbg and KD are available only when two interlinked computers are used. SoftICE therefore is an exceptionally useful tool for difficult driver related development. The last released version was for Windows XP.

Older versions exist for [[DOS]] and compatible operating systems. SoftICE was originally produced by a company called [[NuMega]], and was subsequently acquired by [[Compuware]] in 1997, which in turn sold the property to [[Micro Focus]] in 2009.  Currently, Micro Focus owns the source code and patents, but is not actively maintaining SoftICE.

== Naming ==
&quot;Soft&quot; refers to software, and the &quot;ICE&quot; part of the name is an [[allusion]] to [[in-circuit emulator]].

== History ==
The original '''SoftICE for DOS''' was written in 1987 by NuMega founders [[Frank Grossman]] and [[Jim Moskun]]. The program, written in [[80386]] [[assembly language]], played the role of an operating system and ran software in [[virtual 8086 mode]]. It sold for $386.

'''SoftICE/W (for Windows)''' was developed in the 1990s, and was instrumental in the Writing of &quot;Undocumented Windows&quot;, by [[Andrew Schulman]], [[David Maxey]] and [[Matt Pietrek]]. SoftICE/W was derived from an earlier, lesser known product, '''SoftICE for NetWare''' (32-bit protected mode). One of the key advantages it had over Microsoft's debuggers is that it enabled single machine debugging, rather than requiring a second machine to be connected over a serial port.

The principal developers of SoftICE were Dom Basile ('Mr. SoftICE'), Tom Guinther (Kitchen Sink, Symbol Engine), Gerald Ryckman (Video drivers and ''Kitchen Sink''), Ray Hsu (Video drivers for Windows 95), and Dan Babcock ('''SoftICE/NT''' 3.1/3.5: Universal video driver, symbol engine), with contributions by a variety of NuMega developers including Frank Grossman, Jim Moskun and Matt Pietrek.

In 1998 the codebase for '''SoftICE/95''' was ported to run on the Windows NT platform.

Newer versions of SoftICE patch deep into Microsoft Windows. As such, old versions of SoftICE are rarely compatible with new versions of Windows. Compuware therefore offered SoftICE as a subscription so that it could be kept up to date and in sync with the latest Microsoft Windows version.

It used to be offered as part of Compuware's [[DriverStudio]] package but was discontinued in April 2006.

=== Termination ===
As of April 3, 2006 the DriverStudio product family has been discontinued because of &quot;a variety of technical and business issues as well as general market conditions&quot;. Maintenance support was offered until March 31, 2007.

==== Anti-SoftICE measures ====
Software vendors have put in place a wide range of countermeasures to protect themselves from people employing SoftICE as a tool to analyse software.

For example, here is code some vendors used to detect the presence of SoftICE running in the same machine as an early countermeasure:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 mov eax, dword ptr [pIDT+2]; eax -&gt; IDT
 add eax, 8                 ; eax -&gt; int 1 vector
 mov ebx, [eax]             ; ebx == int 1 vector
 add eax, 16                ; eax -&gt; int 3 vector
 mov eax, [eax]             ; eax == int 3 vector
 and eax, 0FFFFh            ; strip the selector
 and ebx, 0FFFFh            ; part of it
 sub eax, ebx               ; find displacement
 cmp eax, 10h
jne  HackedVector           ; not equal, then chances are
                            ; SoftICE had tampered with these vectors
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

More and better such measures have evolved since. While most of them can only deter the less experienced and determined hackers, SoftICE is no longer a tool of choice for someone new to analysing software.

Today vendor's defenses are based on more sophisticated packers/protectors, e.g. [[Themida]], [[Armadillo Protector|Armadillo]] or [[ASProtect]] which pack the program code and tamper with entry point addresses so it is hard to find the program's original entry point ([[Entry point|OEP]]). That is also true for the program's [[Import Address Table|import address table]] (IAT). However tools for hiding SoftICE are also available, such as IceStealth and IceExt for Windows NT, or Icedump and IcePatch for Windows 9x.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woodmann.com/collaborative/tools/index.php/Category:SoftICE_Extensions |title=Category:SoftICE Extensions - Collaborative RCE Tool Library |publisher=Woodmann.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''[[BYTE]]'' in 1989 listed Soft-ICE as among the &quot;Distinction&quot; winners of the BYTE Awards, stating that &quot;If you're developing 8086-based applications on an 80386 machine, this is an essential and affordable tool&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;byte198901&quot;&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=January 1989 |title=The BYTE Awards |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1989-01/1989_01_BYTE_14-01_PC_Communications_and_Annual_Awards_and_Digitizing_Tablets#page/n371/mode/2up |magazine=BYTE |page=327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{Anchor|RR0D}}Alternatives ==
A commercial kernel-level debugger called [[Syser]] claims to continue where SoftICE left off.

A shareware debugger, but free to use, [[OllyDbg]] is a 32-bit assembler-level debugger from Oleh Yuschuk. However, it can only be used for user-mode debugging.

An open source kernel debugger similar to SoftICE named ''Rasta Ring 0 Debugger'' (RR0D) is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.droids-corp.org/articles/r/r/0/RR0D/Presentation.html |title=RR0D/Presentation |publisher=Wiki.droids-corp.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woodmann.com/collaborative/tools/index.php/Rasta_Ring_0_Debugger_%28RR0D%29 |title=Rasta Ring 0 Debugger (RR0D) - Collaborative RCE Tool Library |publisher=Woodmann.com |date=2007-10-18 |accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides low-level debugging for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], [[OpenBSD]], [[NetBSD]], and [[FreeBSD]]. This project does not seem to be actively maintained. {{As of|2016|6}}, the last change in its [[GitHub]] source code repository occurred in December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=joe |url=https://github.com/ice799/rr0d |title=ice799/rr0d |publisher=Github.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[LinICE]] is another kernel-level debugger with a SoftICE look and feel. {{As of|2015}}, it also has not been updated for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/linicetool/ |title=LinICE Debugger |publisher=sites.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[HyperDBG]] is a kernel-level debugger leveraging hardware-assisted virtualization. {{As of|2011}}, it was last updated in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code.google.com/p/hyperdbg/ |title=hyperdbg - A kernel debugger that leverages hardware-assisted virtualization |publisher=Code.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A debugger called [[BugChecker]] is a 32-bit single-host kernel debugger for Windows 2000 and XP, developed and made available as open source for educational purposes. BugChecker allows users to trace into both user and kernel code, both on uniprocessor and multiprocessor versions of Windows 2000 and XP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bugchecker.com |title=BugChecker |publisher=BugChecker |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many hypervisors allow debugging the kernel running in the virtual machine through exposing some kind of debugger interface that can control the virtualized processor directly. This allows debugging even if a kernel does not have native debugging facilities.

The '''mail''' or '''post''' is a system for physically transporting [[postcard]]s, [[letter (message)|letters]], and [[parcel (package)|parcels]].&lt;ref&gt;In Australia, Canada, and the U.S., the term &quot;mail&quot; is commonly used for the postal system and for the letters, postcards, and parcels it carries; in New Zealand, &quot;post&quot; is more common for the postal system and &quot;mail&quot; for the material delivered; in the UK, &quot;post&quot; prevails in both senses. However, the British, American, Australian, and Canadian national postal services are called, respectively, the &quot;[[Royal Mail]]&quot;, the &quot;[[United States Postal Service]]&quot;, &quot;[[Australia Post]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Canada Post]]&quot;; in addition, such fixed phrases as &quot;[[post office]]&quot; or &quot;[[Advertising mail|junk mail]]&quot; are found throughout the English-speaking world.&lt;/ref&gt; A postal service can be private or public, though many governments place restrictions on private systems. Since the mid-19th century, national postal systems have generally been established as a [[government monopoly]], with a fee on the article prepaid. Proof of payment is usually in the form of an adhesive [[postage stamp]], but a [[postage meter]] is also used for bulk mailing.

Postal authorities often have functions aside from transporting letters. In some countries, a [[Postal Telegraph and Telephone|postal, telegraph and telephone]] (PTT) service oversees the postal system, in addition to telephone and telegraph systems. Some countries' postal systems allow for [[savings account]]s and handle applications for [[passport]]s.

The [[Universal Postal Union]] (UPU), established in 1874, includes 192 member countries and sets the rules for international mail exchanges.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Mail_Sample_(back_to_back).jpg|thumb|Mail envelope (back to back)]]
The word ''mail'' comes from the [[Medieval English]] word ''male'', referring to a travelling bag or pack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=mail, ''n.''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|encyclopedia=Dictionary.com|year=2007|edition=Unabridged (v 1.1)|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mail|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219051534/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mail|archive-date=2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was spelled in that manner until the 17th century and is distinct from the word [[male]]. The French have a similar word, {{Lang|fr|malle}}, for a trunk or large box, and {{Lang|ga|mála}} is the Irish term for a bag. In the 17th century, the word ''mail'' began to appear as a reference for a bag that contained letters: &quot;bag full of letter&quot; (1654). Over the next hundred years the word ''mail'' began to be applied strictly to the letters themselves and the sack as the ''mailbag''. In the 19th century, the British typically used ''mail'' to refer to letters being sent abroad (i.e. on a ship) and ''post'' to refer to letters for domestic delivery. The word ''Post'' is derived from Medieval French ''poste'', which ultimately stems from the past participle of the Latin verb ''ponere'' (&quot;to lay down or place&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary'', G. &amp; C. Merriam Company, 1963, pp. 662–63.&lt;/ref&gt; So in the U.K., the [[Royal Mail]] delivers the ''post'', whilst in North America both the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]] and [[Canada Post]] deliver the ''mail''.

The term ''[[email]]'' (short for &quot;''e''lectronic ''mail''&quot;) first appeared in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=OED Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|chapter=email, n.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ray-Tomlinson|title=Ray Tomlinson|last=Bauer|first=Patricia|date=31 December 2018|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''snail-mail'' is a [[retronym]] to distinguish it from the quicker email. Various dates have been given for its first use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lx7UAniLfJwC&amp;q=surface%20mail&amp;pg=PA4|title=Cognitive English Grammar|first1=Günter|last1=Radden|first2=René|last2=Dirven|date=1 January 2007|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|page=4|isbn=978-1556196638|access-date=March 1, 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ZUtAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=lady+%22take+a+bath+%22+maid&amp;pg=PA662 |title=Fraser's Magazine for Town and Country |page=662 |website=Books.google.co.uk |year=1843 |access-date=2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-VMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=%22snail+mail%22%3B&amp;pg=PA112-IA5|title=LIFE|first=Time|last=Inc|date=November 22, 1968|publisher=Time Inc|page=111|access-date=March 1, 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|history of postal systems}}&lt;!-- linked --&gt;
[[File:Houttakin postitalo.jpg|thumb|right|Many early post systems consisted of fixed courier routes. Here, a post house on a postal route in the 19th century [[Finland]]]]
The practice of communication by written documents carried by an intermediary from one person or place to another almost certainly dates back nearly to the invention of [[writing]]. However, the development of formal postal systems occurred much later. The first documented use of an organized [[courier]] service for the dissemination of written documents is in [[Egypt]], where [[Pharaoh]]s used couriers for the dissemination of their decrees in the territory of the State (2400 BCE). The earliest surviving piece of mail is also Egyptian, dating to 255 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Universal Postal Union. &quot;[http://www.upu.int/en/the-upu/history/about-history.html History]&quot;. Accessed 2 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Persia (Iran) ===

The first credible claim for the development of a real postal system comes from [[Ancient Persia]]. The best-documented claim ([[Xenophon]]) attributes the invention to the Persian King [[Cyrus the Great]] (550 BCE), who mandated that every province in his kingdom would organize reception and delivery of post to each of its citizens. He also negotiated with neighboring countries to do the same and had roads built from the city of [[Post, Iran|Post]] in Western Iran all the way up to the city of [[Hakha]] in the East. Other writers credit his successor [[Darius I of Persia]] (521 BCE). Other sources claim much earlier dates for an Assyrian postal system, with credit given to [[Hammurabi]] (1700 BCE) and [[Sargon II of Assyria|Sargon II]] (722 BCE). Mail may not have been the primary mission of this postal service, however. The role of the system as an intelligence gathering apparatus is well documented, and the service was (later) called ''angariae'', a term that in time came to indicate a tax system. The [[Old Testament]] ([[Esther]], VIII) makes mention of this system: [[Xerxes I|Ahasuerus]], king of [[Medes]], used couriers for communicating his decisions.

The [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] system worked using stations (called [[Chapar Khaneh|Chapar-Khaneh]]), whence the message carrier (called [[Chapar Khaneh|Chapar]]) would ride to the next post, whereupon he would swap his horse with a fresh one for maximum performance and delivery speed. [[Herodotus]] described the system in this way: &quot;''It is said that as many days as there are in the whole journey, so many are the men and horses that stand along the road, each horse and man at the interval of a day's journey; and these are stayed neither by snow nor rain nor heat nor darkness from accomplishing their appointed course with all speed''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, Herodotus, trans. A.D. Godley, vol. 4, book 8, verse 98, pp. 96–97 (1924).&lt;/ref&gt; The verse prominently features on New York's [[James Farley Post Office]], although it has been slightly rephrased to ''Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds''.

{{main|Postal history of India}}
The economic growth and political stability under the [[Mauryan empire]] (322–185 BCE) stimulated sustained development of civil infrastructure in ancient [[India]]. The Mauryans developed early Indian mail service as well as public wells, rest houses, and other facilities for the public.&lt;ref&gt;Dorn 2006: 145&lt;/ref&gt; Common chariots called ''Dagana'' were sometimes used as mail chariots in ancient India.&lt;ref&gt;Prasad 2003: 104&lt;/ref&gt; Couriers were used militarily by kings and local rulers to deliver information through runners and other carriers. The postmaster, the head of the intelligence service, was responsible for ensuring the maintenance of the courier system. Couriers were also used to deliver personal letters.&lt;ref&gt;Mazumdar 1990: 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet censorship and surveillance===

There are generally no restrictions on access to the Internet, or reports that the de facto government monitors [[e-mail]] or Internet [[chat rooms]]. However, the de facto minister of communication made several statements throughout 2012 about restricting the Internet.&lt;ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-Madagascar-2012&gt;[https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2012&amp;dlid=204137 &quot;Madagascar&quot;], ''Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012'', Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 22 March 2013. Retrieved 15 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political groups, parties, and activists use the Internet extensively to advance their agendas, share news, and criticize other parties. Although there have been allegations of technical sabotage of some Web sites, the Internet is considered among the more reliable sources of information, as many Internet servers were outside the country and cannot be regulated by the regime.&lt;ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-Madagascar-2012/&gt;

The constitution and law provide for [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press|press]], but the de facto regime and military actors actively and systematically impeded the exercise of freedoms of expression and of the press. The law prohibits arbitrary Interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence, but homes and workplaces of opposition groups are subject to arbitrary searches without warrants. Regime security personnel also punished family members for alleged offenses committed by individuals.&lt;ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-Madagascar-2012/&gt;

In 2010, [[Madagascar]] had approximately {{convert|7,617|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} of paved roads, {{convert|854|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} of railways and {{convert|432|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} of navigable waterways.&lt;ref&gt;Bradt (2011), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Railways==
[[File:Railways on Madagascar.svg|thumb|200px]] {{main|Rail transport in Madagascar}}
There are several rail lines and [[Railway stations in Madagascar|stations]] in Madagascar. [[Antananarivo]] is connected to [[Toamasina]], [[Ambatondrazaka]] and [[Antsirabe]] by rail, and another rail line connects [[Fianarantsoa]] to [[Manakara]]. 

The northern railway (TCE) is concessioned to [[Madarail]]. The southern line, [[Fianarantsoa-Côte Est railway|Fianarantsoa-Côte-Est railway]] (FCE), is a [[State-owned enterprise|parastatal]] line.

==Highways==
The majority of roads in Madagascar are unpaved, with many becoming impassable in the rainy season. Largely paved national routes connect the six largest regional towns to Antananarivo, with minor paved and unpaved routes providing access to other population centers in each district.&lt;ref name=&quot;LOC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last = Metz |first = Helen Chapin |year = 1994 |title = Library of Congress Country Studies: Madagascar |url=http://countrystudies.us/madagascar/ |accessdate =1 February 2011 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051109090930/http://countrystudies.us/madagascar/ |url-status = dead |archivedate = 9 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Waterways==
The relatively short rivers of Madagascar are typically of local importance only; isolated streams and small portions of Lakandranon' Ampangalana ([[Canal des Pangalanes]]) are navigated by [[pirogue]]. Coastal inter-city transport routes are found along the west coast.

==Ports and harbors==
The most important seaport in Madagascar is located on the east coast at Toamasina. Ports at [[Toliara]], [[Mahajanga]], and [[Antsiranana]] are significantly less used because of their remoteness.&lt;ref name=&quot;LOC&quot;/&gt; The island's newest port at [[Port d'Ehola]], constructed in 2008 and privately managed by [[Rio Tinto (corporation)|Rio Tinto]], will come under state control upon completion of the company's mining project near Tôlanaro around 2038.&lt;ref name = RioTinto&gt;{{cite web |title= About QMM |publisher= Rio Tinto |year= 2009 |accessdate= 19 September 2012 |url= http://www.sherritt.com/Operations/Metals/Ambatovy-Joint-Venture|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120213230732/http://www.sherritt.com/Operations/Metals/Ambatovy-Joint-Venture |url-status= live |archivedate = 13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's principal cargo port is [[Toamasina Autonomous Port]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://madagascar.ictsi.com/about_us.htm Madagascar International Container Terminal Services, About us] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126125156/http://madagascar.ictsi.com/about_us.htm |date=2009-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Airports==
{{seealso|List of airports in Madagascar}}
The main international airport in Madagascar is [[Ivato International Airport]] in Antananarivo. [[Air Madagascar]] services the island's many small regional airports, which offer the only practical means of access to many of the more remote regions during rainy season road washouts.&lt;ref name=&quot;LOC&quot;/&gt; There are 29 airports with paved runways, and 104 airports with unpaved runways.

The '''Madagascar People's Armed Forces''' ({{lang-fr|Forces armées de Madagascar}}, {{lang-mg|Tafika Malagasy}}) is the national military of [[Madagascar]].  The [[IISS]] detailed the armed forces in 2012 as including an Army of 12,500+, a Navy of 500, and a 500-strong Air Force.&lt;ref name=IISS_2012_442 /&gt;  An alternate report (seemingly from [[CIA World Factbook]] data) describes the People's Armed Forces as consisting of the Intervention Force, Development Force, and Aeronaval Force, which is the navy and air force.&lt;ref name=CIA_Factbook_Oct_2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Madagascar|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ma.html|work=The World Factbook|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The armed forces were involved in the [[2009 Malagasy political crisis]]. During [[World War II]], Malagasy troops fought in [[France]], [[Morocco]], and [[Syria]].

==History==
The rise of centralized kingdoms among the [[Sakalava people|Sakalava]], [[Merina people|Merina]] and other ethnic groups produced the island's first standing armies, first equipped with spears, but later with muskets, cannons and other firearms. King Ralambo (1575–1612) raised the first standing army in the highland Kingdom of Imerina with a handful of guns, although for at least two centuries the armies of the Sakalava were much larger and better equipped, possessing thousands of muskets obtained principally through trade with European partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Barendse | first = R.

Merina Queen Ranavalona, like her predecessors, utilized the tradition of ''fanampoana'' (service due to the sovereign in lieu of taxes) to conscript a large portion of the population of Imerina into military service, enabling the queen to raise a standing army that was estimated at 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers.&lt;ref name = &quot;army&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last = Freeman | first = Joseph John |author2=Johns, David | title = A narrative of the persecution of the Christians in Madagascar: with details of the escape of six Christian refugees now in England | publisher = J. Snow | location = Berlin | year = 1840 |url = https://archive.org/details/anarrativeperse01johngoog | accessdate = February 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By the late 19th century French plans to colonize Madagascar were gaining momentum, leading British mercenaries to provide training to the queen's army in an unsuccessful bid to repel the French troops. [[French Madagascar|Madagascar was colonized]] in 1896, and during World War II over 46,000 Malagasy soldiers were drafted to fight with the Allies, over 2,000 of whom lost their lives fighting for France.&lt;ref name = BDT&gt;Bradt (2010), pp. 7-10&lt;/ref&gt;

Madagascar regained political independence and sovereignty over its military in 1960. Since this time Madagascar has never engaged in an armed conflict, whether against another state or within its own borders. As such the armed forces of Madagascar have primarily served a peace-keeping role. However, the military has occasionally intervened to restore order during periods of political unrest. When President Philibert Tsiranana was forced to step down in 1972, a military directorate ensured an interim government before appointing one of its own, Admiral Didier Ratsiraka, to lead the country into its socialist Second Republic. He launched a strategy of obligatory national armed or civil service for all young citizens regardless of gender. The majority were channeled into civil service, including agriculture and education programs for rural development based on the socialist Soviet model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Strakes | first = Jason | contribution = Armed Forces of the People | year = 2006 | title = Encyclopedia of the developing world | editor-last = Leonard | editor-first = Thomas M. | volume = 1 | page = 86 | place = New York | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | isbn = 978-1-57958-388-0 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3mE04D9PMpAC |accessdate = April 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ratsiraka would also mobilize elements of the military to pacify unarmed protesters, occasionally using violent means. His order to fire upon unarmed protesters in 1989 was the catalyst for transition to the democratic Third Republic in 1992. The military remained largely neutral during the protracted standoff between incumbent Ratsiraka and challenger Marc Ravalomanana in the disputed 2001 presidential elections. By contrast, in 2009 a segment of the army defected to the side of Andry Rajoelina, then-mayor of Antananarivo, in support of his attempt to force President Ravalomanana from power. It is widely believed that payoffs were involved in persuading these military personnel to change camps in support of the ''coup d'etat''.&lt;ref name = BDT/&gt;

As of 2010, the military of Madagascar is composed of the 8,100 paramilitary of the National [[Gendarmerie]] and the 13,500 members of the People's Armed Forces. According to the International Institute of Strategic Studies' Military Balance 2010, the latter includes an Army of 12,500, a Navy of 500 and a 500-strong Air Force,&lt;ref&gt;[[IISS]] Military Balance 2010, p.314-315&lt;/ref&gt; while the CIA Factbook describes the People's Armed Forces as consisting of the Intervention Force, Aeronaval Force (navy and air) and the Development Force. Military service is voluntary and limited to males aged 18 to 25; every citizen of either gender is required to have perform either military or civil service for a minimum of 18 months. However, because of a lack of up-to-date census data, this requirement is not currently enforced. The Gendarmerie recruits Malagasy citizens between the ages of 20 and 30 (or 35 if the recruit has prior military service). Military expenses constituted just over one percent of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |title=The World Factbook: Madagascar |date=April 1, 2011 |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ma.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406121115/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ma.html |archivedate=April 6, 2011 |accessdate=April 1, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Ravalomanana, military expenditure doubled from 54 million USD in 2006 to 103 million USD in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;IISS Military Balance 2010, p.467&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|Defunct functional commission within the overall framework of the United Nations}}
The '''United Nations Commission on Human Rights''' ('''UNCHR''') was a functional commission within the [[United Nations System|overall framework]] of the [[United Nations]] from 1946 until it was replaced by the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] in 2006. It was a subsidiary body of the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|UN Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC), and was also assisted in its work by the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (UNOHCHR). It was the UN's principal mechanism and international forum concerned with the promotion and protection of [[human rights]].

On 15 March 2006, the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] voted overwhelmingly to replace UNCHR with the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN Human Rights Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4810538.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=15 March 2006|title=UN creates new human rights body}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Eleanor Roosevelt at United Nations for Human Rights Commission meeting in Lake Success, New York - NARA - 196772.jpg|thumb|upright|Eleanor Roosevelt at United Nations for Human Rights Commission meeting in Lake Success, New York in 1947]]

The UNCHR was established in 1946 by [[ECOSOC]], and was one of the first two &quot;Functional Commissions&quot; set up within the early UN structure (the other being the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women|Commission on the Status of Women]]). It was a body created under the terms of the [[United Nations Charter]] (specifically, under ''Article 68'') to which all [[Member states of the United Nations|UN member states]] are signatories.

It met for the first time in January 1947 and established a drafting committee for the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], which was adopted by the [[United Nations]] on December 10, 1948.

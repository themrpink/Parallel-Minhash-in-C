Bold, flat lines define and contain areas of flat colour.]]

Early ukiyo-e artists brought with them a sophisticated knowledge of and training in the composition principles of classical [[Chinese painting]]; gradually these artists shed the overt Chinese influence to develop a native Japanese idiom.  The early ukiyo-e artists have been called &quot;Primitives&quot; in the sense that the print medium was a new challenge to which they adapted these centuries-old techniques—their image designs are not considered &quot;primitive&quot;.{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|pp=9–11}}  Many ukiyo-e artists received training from teachers of the Kanō and other painterly schools.{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=9}}

A defining feature of most ukiyo-e prints is a well-defined, bold, flat line.{{sfnm|1a1=Bell|1y=2004|1p=xiv|2a1=Michener|2y=1959|2p=11}}  The earliest prints were monochromatic, and these lines were the only printed element; even with the advent of colour this characteristic line continued to dominate.{{sfn|Michener|1959|pp=11–12}}  In ukiyo-e composition forms are arranged in flat spaces{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=90}} with figures typically in a single plane of depth.  Attention was drawn to vertical and horizontal relationships, as well as details such as lines, shapes, and patterns such as those on clothing.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=xvi}}  Compositions were often asymmetrical, and the viewpoint was often from unusual angles, such as from above.  Elements of images were often [[Cropping (image)|cropped]], giving the composition a spontaneous feel.{{sfn|Sims|1998|p=298}}  In colour prints, contours of most colour areas are sharply defined, usually by the linework.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=34}}  The aesthetic of flat areas of colour contrasts with the modulated colours expected in Western traditions{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=90}} and with other prominent contemporary traditions in Japanese art patronized by the upper class, such as in the subtle monochrome [[Ink wash painting|ink brushstrokes]] of [[zenga]] brush painting or tonal colours of the [[Kanō school]] of painting.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=34}}

[[File:Black Raku Tea Bowl.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photo of a tea bowl, dark-coloured, humble, and asymmetric|''[[Wabi-sabi]]'' aesthetic in a 16th-century tea bowl]]

The colourful, ostentatious, and complex patterns, concern with changing fashions, and tense, dynamic poses and compositions in ukiyo-e are in striking contrast with many concepts in traditional [[Japanese aesthetics]].  Prominent amongst these, ''[[wabi-sabi]]'' favours simplicity, asymmetry, and imperfection, with evidence of the passage of time;{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=50–52}} and ''[[shibui]]'' values subtlety, humility, and restraint.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=53–54}}  Ukiyo-e can be less at odds with aesthetic concepts such as the racy, urbane stylishness of ''[[iki (aesthetics)|iki]]''.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=66}}

Ukiyo-e displays an unusual approach to graphical perspective, one that can appear underdeveloped when compared to European paintings of the same period.  Western-style geometrical perspective was known in Japan—practised most prominently by the [[Akita ranga]] painters of the 1770s—as were Chinese methods to create a sense of depth using a homogeny of parallel lines.  The techniques sometimes appeared together in ukiyo-e works, geometrical perspective providing an illusion of depth in the background and the more expressive Chinese perspective in the fore.{{sfn|Suwa|1998|pp=57–60}}  The techniques were most likely learned at first through Chinese Western-style paintings rather than directly from Western works.{{sfn|Suwa|1998|pp=62–63}}  Long after becoming familiar with these techniques, artists continued to harmonize them with traditional methods according to their compositional and expressive needs.{{sfn|Suwa|1998|pp=106–107}}  Other ways of indicating depth included the Chinese tripartite composition method&lt;!-- 三部構図法 --&gt; used in Buddhist pictures,&lt;!-- 仏画 --&gt; where a large form is placed in the foreground, a smaller in the midground, and yet a smaller in the background; this can be seen in Hokusai's ''Great Wave'', with a large boat in the foreground, a smaller behind it, and a small Mt Fuji behind them.{{sfn|Suwa|1998|pp=108–109}}

There was a tendency since early ukiyo-e to pose beauties in what art historian {{Interlanguage link multi|Midori Wakakura|ja|3=若桑みどり}} called a &quot;serpentine posture&quot;,{{efn|{{lang|ja|蛇体姿勢}} ''{{transl|ja|jatai shisei}}'', &quot;serpentine posture&quot;}} which involves the subjects' bodies twisting unnaturally while facing behind themselves.  Art historian {{Interlanguage link multi|Motoaki Kōno|ja|3=河野元昭}} posited that this had its roots in traditional [[buyō]] dance; {{Interlanguage link multi|Haruo Suwa|ja|3=諏訪春雄}} countered that the poses were artistic licence taken by ukiyo-e artists, causing a seemingly relaxed pose to reach unnatural or impossible physical extremes.  This remained the case even when realistic perspective techniques were applied to other sections of the composition.{{sfn|Suwa|1998|pp=101–106}}

===Themes and genres===

Typical subjects were female beauties (&quot;''[[bijin-ga]]''&quot;), kabuki actors (&quot;''[[yakusha-e]]''&quot;), and landscapes.  The women depicted were most often courtesans and geisha at leisure, and promoted the entertainments to be found in the pleasure districts.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=60}}  The detail with which artists depicted courtesans' fashions and hairstyles allows the prints to be dated with some reliability.  Less attention was given to accuracy of the women's physical features, which followed the day's pictorial fashions—the faces stereotyped, the bodies tall and lanky in one generation and petite in another.{{sfn|Hillier|1954|p=20}}  Portraits of celebrities were much in demand, in particular those from the kabuki and [[sumo]] worlds, two of the most popular entertainments of the era.{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=95, 98}}  While the landscape has come to define ukiyo-e for many Westerners, landscapes flourished relatively late in the ukiyo-e's history.{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=175}}

The wallpaper and other items in this [[nishiki-e|brocade print]] are extensively [[paper embossing|embossed]].&lt;br/&gt;''[[Evening Snow on the Nurioke]]'', [[Suzuki Harunobu|Harunobu]], 1766]]

Ukiyo-e prints grew out of book illustration—many of Moronobu's earliest single-page prints were originally pages from books he had illustrated.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=37}}  ''[[E-hon]]'' books of illustrations were popular{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=41}} and continued be an important outlet for ukiyo-e artists. In the late period, Hokusai produced the three-volume ''One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji'' and the fifteen-volume ''Hokusai Manga'', the latter a compendium of over 4000 sketches of a wide variety of realistic and fantastic subjects.{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=38, 41}}

Traditional Japanese religions do not consider sex or pornography a moral corruption in the [[Judaeo-Christian]] sense,{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=124}} and until the changing morals of the Meiji era led to its suppression, [[shunga]] erotic prints were a major genre.{{sfnm|1a1=Seton|1y=2010|1p=64|2a1=Harris|2y=2011|p=119}}  While the Tokugawa regime subjected Japan to strict censorship laws, pornography was not considered an important offence and generally met with the censors' approval.{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=224}}  Many of these prints displayed a high level a draughtsmanship, and often humour, in their explicit depictions of bedroom scenes, voyeurs, and oversized anatomy.{{sfn|Seton|2010|p=64}}  As with depictions of courtesans, these images were closely tied to entertainments of the pleasure quarters.{{sfn|Screech|1999|p=15}}  Nearly every ukiyo-e master produced shunga at some point.{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=128}}  Records of societal acceptance of shunga are absent, though [[Timon Screech]] posits that there were almost certainly some concerns over the matter, and that its level of acceptability has been exaggerated by later collectors, especially in the West.{{sfn|Screech|1999|p=15}}

Scenes from nature have been an important part of Asian art throughout history.  Artists have closely studied the correct forms and anatomy of plants and animals, even though depictions of human anatomy remained more fanciful until modern times.  Ukiyo-e nature prints are called ''[[kachō-e]]'', which translates as &quot;flower-and-bird pictures&quot;, though the genre was open to more than just flowers or birds, and the flowers and birds did not necessarily appear together.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=132}}  Hokusai's detailed, precise nature prints are credited with establishing ''kachō-e'' as a genre.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=134}}

The Tenpō Reforms of the 1840s suppressed the depiction of actors and courtesans.  Aside from landscapes and ''kachō-e'', artists turned to depictions of historical scenes, such as of ancient warriors or of scenes from legend, literature, and religion.  The 11th-century ''[[The Tale of Genji|Tale of Genji]]''{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=146}} and the 13th-century ''[[The Tale of the Heike|Tale of the Heike]]''{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=155–156}} have been sources of artistic inspiration throughout Japanese history,{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=146}} including in ukiyo-e.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=146}}  Well-known warriors and swordsmen such as [[Miyamoto Musashi]] (1584–1645) were frequent subjects, as were depictions of monsters, the supernatural, and heroes of [[Japanese mythology|Japanese]] and [[Chinese mythology]].{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=148, 153}}

From the 17th to 19th centuries [[Sakoku|Japan isolated itself]] from the rest of the world.  Trade, primarily with the Dutch and Chinese, was restricted to the island of [[Dejima]] near [[Nagasaki]].  Outlandish pictures called ''Nagasaki-e'' were sold to tourists of the foreigners and their wares.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=163}}  In the mid-19th century, [[Yokohama]] became the primary foreign settlement after 1859, from which Western knowledge proliferated in Japan.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=163–164}}  Especially from 1858 to 1862 ''[[Yokohama-e]]'' prints documented, with various levels of fact and fancy, the growing community of world denizens with whom the Japanese were now coming in contact;{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=166–167}} triptychs of scenes of Westerners and their technology were particularly popular.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=170}}

Specialized prints included ''[[surimono]]'', deluxe, limited-edition prints aimed at connoisseurs, of which a five-line [[kyōka]] poem was usually part of the design;{{sfn|King|2010|p=111}} and ''[[uchiwa-e]]'' printed [[hand fan]]s, which often suffer from having been handled.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=37}}

===Paintings===

{{Main|Nikuhitsu-ga}}

Ukiyo-e artists often made both prints and paintings; some specialized in one or the other.{{sfn|Fitzhugh|1979|p=27}}  In contrast with previous traditions, ukiyo-e painters favoured bright, sharp colours,{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=xii}} and often delineated contours with [[inkstick|sumi ink]], an effect similar to the linework in prints.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=236}}  Unrestricted by the technical limitations of printing, a wider range of techniques, pigments, and surfaces were available to the painter.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=235–236}}  Artists painted with pigments made from mineral or organic substances, such as [[safflower]], ground shells, lead, and [[cinnabar]],{{sfn|Fitzhugh|1979|pp=29, 34}} and later synthetic dyes imported from the West such as [[Paris green]] and Prussian blue.{{sfn|Fitzhugh|1979|pp=35–36}}  Silk or paper  ''[[kakemono]]'' hanging scrolls, ''makimono'' [[handscroll]]s, or ''[[byōbu]]'' folding screens were the most common surfaces.{{sfn|Fitzhugh|1979|p=27}}

[[File:Yoshiiku (1862) key block face b.jpg|thumb|alt=Carved woodblock for printing|Key block for ukiyo-e print, [[Utagawa Yoshiiku]], 1862]]

{{Main|Woodblock printing in Japan}}

Ukiyo-e prints were the works of teams of artisans in several workshops;{{sfn|Faulkner|Robinson|1999|p=27}} it was rare for designers to cut their own woodblocks.{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|p=21}}  Labour was divided into four groups: the publisher, who commissioned, promoted, and distributed the prints; the artists, who provided the design image; the woodcarvers, who prepared the woodblocks for printing; and the printers, who made impressions of the woodblocks on paper.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=11}}  Normally only the names of the artist and publisher were credited on the finished print.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=61}}

Ukiyo-e prints were impressed on [[Washi|hand-made paper]]{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=11}} manually, rather than by mechanical press as in the West.{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|p=1}}  The artist provided an ink drawing on thin paper, which was pasted{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=64}} to a block of cherry wood{{efn|Traditional Japanese woodblocks were cut along the grain, as opposed to the blocks of Western [[wood engraving]], which were cut across the grain.  In both methods, the dimensions of the woodblock was limited by the girth of the tree.{{sfn|Statler|1959|pp=34–35}}  In the 20th century, [[plywood]] became the material of choice for Japanese woodcarvers, as it is cheaper, easier to carve, and less limited in size.{{sfnm|1a1=Statler|1y=1959|1pp=34–35|2a1=Salter|2y=2001|1p=64}} }} and rubbed with oil until the upper layers of paper could be pulled away, leaving a translucent layer of paper that the block-cutter could use as a guide. The block-cutter cut away the non-black areas of the image, leaving raised areas that were inked to leave an impression.{{sfn|Faulkner|Robinson|1999|p=27}}  The original drawing was destroyed in the process.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=64}}

Prints were made with blocks face up so the printer could vary pressure for different effects, and watch as paper absorbed the water-based sumi ink,{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|p=1}} applied quickly in even horizontal strokes.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=225}}  Amongst the printer's tricks were [[Paper embossing|embossing]] of the image, achieved by pressing an uninked woodblock on the paper to achieve effects, such as the textures of clothing patterns or fishing net.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=246}}  Other effects included burnishing{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=247}} by rubbing with [[agate]] to brighten colours;{{sfn|Frédéric|2002|p=884}} [[varnish]]ing; [[overprinting]]; dusting with metal or [[mica]]; and sprays to imitate falling snow.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=247}}

The ukiyo-e print was a commercial art form, and the publisher played an important role.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=62}}  Publishing was highly competitive; over a thousand publishers are known from throughout the period.  The number peaked at around 250 in the 1840s and 1850s{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=180}}—200 in Edo alone{{sfn|Salter|2006|p=19}}—and slowly shrank following the opening of Japan until about 40 remained at the opening of the 20th century.  The publishers owned the woodblocks and copyrights, and from the late 18th century enforced copyrights{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=180}} through the Picture Book and Print Publishers Guild.{{efn|{{nihongo||地本問屋|Jihon Toiya}} &quot;Picture Book and Print Publishers Guild&quot;{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=10}} }}{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=10}}  Prints that went through several pressings were particularly profitable, as the publisher could reuse the woodblocks without further payment to the artist or woodblock cutter.  The woodblocks were also traded or sold to other publishers or pawnshops.{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=18}}  Publishers were usually also vendors, and commonly sold each other's wares in their shops.{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=10}}  In addition to the artist's seal, publishers marked the prints with their own seals—some a simple logo, others quite elaborate, incorporating an address or other information.{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=21}}

[[File:Tsutaya Jūzaburō seal.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A publisher's seal in the shape of a flower within a stylized mountain|The publisher's seal of [[Tsutaya Jūzaburō]], who published [[Utamaro]] and [[Sharaku]] in the 1790s]]

Print designers went through apprenticeship before being granted the right to produce prints of their own that they could sign with their own names.{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=13}}  Young designers could be expected to cover part or all of the costs of cutting the woodblocks.  As the artists gained fame publishers usually covered these costs, and artists could demand higher fees.{{sfn|Marks|2012|pp=13–14}}

In pre-modern Japan, people could go by numerous names throughout their lives, their childhood ''{{transl|ja|yōmyō}}'' personal name different from their ''zokumyō'' name as an adult.  An artist's name consisted of a ''{{transl|ja|gasei}}'' artist surname followed by an ''{{transl|ja|azana}}'' personal art name.  The ''{{transl|ja|gasei}}'' was most frequently taken from the school the artist belonged to, such as Utagawa or Torii,{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=22}} and the ''{{transl|ja|azana}}'' normally took a Chinese character from the master's art name—for example, many students of Toyokuni (豊国) took the &quot;kuni&quot; (国) from his name, including Kunisada (国貞) and Kuniyoshi (国芳).{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=13}}  The names artists signed to their works can be a source of confusion as they sometimes changed names through their careers;{{sfn|Merritt|1990|pp=ix–x}}  Hokusai was an extreme case, using over a hundred names throughout his seventy-year career.{{sfn|Link|Takahashi|1977|p=32}}

The prints were mass-marketed{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=62}} and by the mid-19th century total circulation of a print could run into the thousands.{{sfn|Ōkubo|2008|pp=153–154}}  Retailers and travelling sellers promoted them at prices affordable to prosperous townspeople.{{sfnm|1a1=Harris|1y=2011|1p=62|2a1=Meech-Pekarik|2y=1982|2p=93}}  In some cases the prints advertised [[kimono]] designs by the print artist.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=62}}  From the second half of the 17th century, prints were frequently marketed as part of a series,{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=21}} each print stamped with the series name and the print's number in that series.{{sfn|King|2010|pp=48–49}}  This proved a successful marketing technique, as collectors bought each new print in the series to keep their collections complete.{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=21}}  By the 19th century, series such as Hiroshige's ''Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō'' ran to dozens of prints.{{sfn|King|2010|pp=48–49}}

====Colour print production====

While [[colour printing]] in Japan dates to the 1640s, early ukiyo-e prints used only black ink.  Colour was sometimes added by hand, using a red lead ink in ''tan-e'' prints, or later in a pink safflower ink in ''beni-e'' prints.  Colour printing arrived in books in the 1720s and in single-sheet prints in the 1740s, with a different block and printing for each colour.  Early colours were limited to pink and green; techniques expanded over the following two decades to allow up to five colours.{{sfn|Faulkner|Robinson|1999|p=27}}  The mid-1760s brought full-colour ''nishiki-e'' prints{{sfn|Faulkner|Robinson|1999|p=27}} made from ten or more woodblocks.{{sfnm|1a1=Ishizawa|1a2=Tanaka|1y=1986|1p=38|2a1=Merritt|2y=1990|2p=18}}  To keep the blocks for each colour aligned correctly [[Printing registration|registration marks]] called ''kentō'' were placed on one corner and an adjacent side.{{sfn|Faulkner|Robinson|1999|p=27}}

[[File:Pigment Berliner Blau.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Photo of a dish of deep blue powder|[[Prussian blue]] was a prominent synthetic dye in the 19th century.]]

Printers first used [[Natural dye|natural colour dyes]] made from mineral or vegetable sources.  The dyes had a translucent quality that allowed a variety of colours to be mixed from [[Primary color|primary]] red, blue, and yellow pigments.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=26}}  In the 18th century, [[Prussian blue]] became popular, and was particularly prominent in the landscapes of Hokusai and Hiroshige,{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=26}} as was ''[[bokashi (printing)|bokashi]]'', where the printer produced gradations of colour or the blending of one colour into another.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=31}}  Cheaper and more consistent synthetic [[aniline]] dyes arrived from the West in 1864.  The colours were harsher and brighter than traditional pigments.  The [[Government of Meiji Japan|Meiji government]] promoted their use as part of broader policies of Westernization.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=234}}

On 27 February 1670 Michael I married Austrian princess [[Eleanor of Austria, Queen of Poland|Eleanor]], and the ceremony was celebrated by Papal Nuncio, Cardinal [[Galeazzo Marescotti]], as Primate Prazmowski refused to attend. The reception took place at the Denhoff Palace in [[Kruszyna, Silesian Voivodeship|Kruszyna]].

=== Internal conflicts ===
[[File:Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as a fief of the Ottoman Empire 1672-1676.PNG|thumb|right|240px|Poland-Lithuania as a fief of the Ottoman Empire between 1672 and 1676]]
Following the 1669 election, the Commonwealth was divided between two camps – pro-French, and royal. The pro-French camp had several influential members, including Primate Prazmowski, Hetman Sobieski, [[Andrzej Morsztyn]], Voivode of Kraków [[Aleksander Michał Lubomirski (d. 1677)|Aleksander Michał Lubomirski]], Voivode of [[Ruthenia]] [[Stanisław Jan Jabłonowski]], Voivode of [[Poznań]] [[Krzysztof Grzymultowski]], and Bishop of Kraków [[Andrzej Trzebicki]].

In November 1669, the French camp broke the Coronation [[Sejm]], hoping to dethrone Michael and elect Count Charles-Paris d'Orléans-Longueville. In 1670, the internal struggle moved to the local [[sejmik]]s, during which the nobility demanded to bring a Sejm lawsuit against Hetman Sobieski. To defend their commander, Sobieski's soldiers formed a [[Confederation (Poland)|Confederation]] near [[Trembowla]].

To make matters worse, the divided Commonwealth was under constant Turkish threat. In 1671, the king supported a rebellion of a unit of Stanisław Wyżycki, who, against the explicit order of Sobieski, abandoned Volhynia, leaving the province defenceless. King Michael ordered Wyżycki and his men to spend the winter of 1671/72 in the wealthy ''[[starostwo]]'' of [[Samborzec|Sambor]], and paid them their salaries, while Sobieski and his soldiers did not receive any money.

In 1672, the Ottoman Empire declared war on the Commonwealth, and the [[Polish–Ottoman War (1672–76)|Polish–Ottoman War of 1672–76]] began. Despite this, the situation in the Polish Crown was still chaotic, with the danger of a civil war. The nobility formed a confederation near [[Gołąb, Puławy County|Gołąb]], demanding the removal of Primate Prazmowski. Its members looted real estate owned by Hetman Sobieski and his family. On 22 November 1672 Lithuanian soldiers formed their own confederation in [[Kobryń]], declaring their support for the Gołąb confederation. In response, soldiers under Sobieski formed a confederation in [[Szczebrzeszyn]]. John Sobieski, together with his troops, headed to [[Łowicz]], to meet Primate Prazmowski.

Negotiations between the two factions were carried out by Papal Nuncio Francesco Buonvisi and Bishop of Kraków [[Andrzej Trzebicki]]. Furthermore, Sultan [[Mehmed IV]] of the Ottoman Empire sent an offensive letter to Warsaw, demanding complete subordination of the Commonwealth. This greatly enraged the Poles but due to chaotic internal situation of the Commonwealth, both sides of the conflict reached an agreement in March 1672.

=== War with the Ottoman Empire ===
In June 1672, a 100,000-strong Ottoman army, under Mehmed IV, besieged the city of [[Kamieniec Podolski]], which capitulated after 26 days. The invaders then approached [[Lwów]], which paid a ransom. Mounted [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] units penetrated as far as [[Hrubieszów]], [[Jasło]] and [[Biecz]].

In October 1672, Hetman John Sobieski, upon request of the senators, tried to stop the invaders, defeating them in the [[Battle of Niemirów]], [[Battle of Komarno]], and Battle of Petranka. Meanwhile, the [[Treaty of Buchach]] was signed on 18 October, in which the king ceded [[Podolia]] to the Ottomans and agreed to pay a yearly tribute. Under these terms, the once mighty Polish Commonwealth was humbled by the Turks.

Soon afterwards, Michael I began preparation for a new military campaign against the Ottomans. On 8 October 1673 at Skwarzawa near [[Złoczów]], some 40,000 Polish soldiers concentrated, with 50 cannons. Due to poor health, the king handed the command of the army to Sobieski, and the Poles marched southwards, to [[Chocim]].

=== Death, funeral, and legacy ===
[[File:Kraków 090.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Tomb of King Michael inside [[Wawel Cathedral]]]]
King Michael I Korybut died in the Palace of the Archbishops of Lwów, on 10 November 1673. His early demise seems to have been brought about by a severe case of food poisoning, although rumours persisted that he had been actually murdered by traitorous generals angered at the declining power of the Commonwealth.

The day after his death, John Sobieski won the  [[Battle of Chocim (1673)|Battle of Chocim]], which reversed some of the losses under Michael I's reign. On 19 May 1674 Hetman John Sobieski was elected the new monarch after the [[1674 Free election|Free election of 1674]].

After the funeral, the heart of the king was buried at a Camedule Monastery in the [[Bielany]] district of Warsaw. The bowels were placed in a wall of the [[Latin Cathedral, Lviv|Latin Cathedral]] in Lwów, while the body was buried in [[Wawel Cathedral]] in Kraków on 31 January 1676, the same day that John Sobieski was crowned as John III.

Michael's reign was considered to be less than successful as his ability to be a capable monarch were greatly hurt by Poland's quarrelling factions. His father's military fame notwithstanding, Michael lost the first phase of the [[Polish–Ottoman War (1672–1676)|Polish–Ottoman War of 1672–1676]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poczet.com/korybut.htm Poczet.com], Michał Korybut Wisniowiecki.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marburg''' is a [[college town|university town]] in the [[States of Germany|German federal state]] (''Bundesland'') of [[Hesse]], capital of the [[Marburg-Biedenkopf]] [[Districts of Germany|district]] (''Landkreis''). The town area spreads along the valley of the river [[Lahn]] and has a population of approximately 72,000.

Having been awarded [[town privileges]] in 1222, Marburg served as capital of the [[Landgrave|landgraviate]] of [[Hessen-Marburg]] during periods of the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries. The [[University of Marburg]] was founded in 1527 and dominates the public life in the town to this day.

== History ==
=== Founding and early history ===
Like many settlements, Marburg developed at the crossroads of two important early medieval highways: the trade route linking [[Cologne]] and [[Prague]] and the trade route from the [[North Sea]] to the [[Alps]] and on to [[Italy]], the former crossing the river [[Lahn]] here. The settlement was protected and customs were raised by a small castle built during the ninth or tenth century by the Giso. Marburg has been a town since 1140, as proven by coins. From the Gisos, it fell around that time to the [[Graf|Landgraves]] of [[Thuringia]], residing on the [[Wartburg]] above [[Eisenach]].

=== St. Elizabeth of Hungary ===
In 1228, the widowed princess-landgravine of Thuringia, [[Elizabeth of Hungary]], chose Marburg as her dowager seat, as she did not get along well with her brother-in-law, the new landgrave. The countess dedicated her life to the sick and would become after her early death in 1231, aged 24, one of the most prominent female saints of the era. She was canonized in 1235.

[[File:Elisabethkirche Marburg.jpg|thumb|[[St. Elizabeth Church (Marburg)]]]]

=== Capital of Hessen ===
In 1264, St Elizabeth's daughter [[Sophie of Thuringia, Duchess of Brabant|Sophie of Brabant]], succeeded in winning the [[Landgraviate of Hessen]], hitherto connected to [[Thuringia]], for her son [[Henry I, Landgrave of Hesse|Henry]]. Marburg (alongside [[Kassel]]) was one of the capitals of Hessen from that time until about 1540. Following the first division of the landgraviate, it was the capital of [[Hessen-Marburg]] from 1485 to 1500 and again between 1567 and 1605. Hessen was one of the more powerful second-tier principalities in Germany. Its &quot;old enemy&quot; was the [[Electorate of Mainz|Archbishopric of Mainz]], one of the [[prince-elector]]s, who competed with Hessen in many wars and conflicts for coveted territory, stretching over several centuries.
[[File:Marburg Braun-Hogenberg.jpg|thumb|left|Marburg from [[Georg Braun]] and Frans Hogenberg's atlas ''[[Civitates orbis terrarum]]'', 1572]]

After 1605, Marburg became just another provincial town, known mostly for the [[University of Marburg]]. It became a virtual backwater for two centuries after the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48), when it was fought over by [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hessen-Darmstadt]] and [[Landgraviate of Hessen-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]]. The Hessian territory around Marburg lost more than two-thirds of its population, which was more than in any later wars (including [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]) combined.

=== Reformation ===
Marburg is the seat of the oldest [[Protestantism|Protestant]]-founded [[university]] in the world, the [[University of Marburg]] (Philipps-Universität-Marburg), founded in 1527. It is one of the smaller &quot;university towns&quot; in Germany: [[Greifswald]], [[Erlangen]], [[Jena]], and [[Tübingen]], as well as the city of [[Gießen]], which is located 30&amp;nbsp;km south of Marburg.

In 1529, [[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse|Philipp I of Hesse]] arranged the [[Marburg Colloquy]], to propitiate [[Martin Luther]] and [[Huldrych Zwingli]].

[[File:Marburg an der Lahn.jpg|thumb|Marburg on the Lahn]]

=== Romanticism ===
Owing to its neglect during the entire eighteenth century, Marburg – like [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]] or [[Chartres]] – survived as a relatively intact [[Gothic art|Gothic]] town, simply because there was no money spent on any new [[architecture]] or expansion. When [[Romanticism]] became the dominant cultural and artistic paradigm in Germany, Marburg became interesting once again, and many of the leaders of the movement lived, taught, or studied in Marburg. They formed a circle of friends that was of great importance, especially in [[literature]], [[philology]], [[folklore]], and [[law]]. 

The group included [[Friedrich Karl von Savigny]], the most important [[jurist]] of his day and father of the [[Roman Law]] adaptation in Germany; the poets, writers, and social activists [[Achim von Arnim]], [[Clemens Brentano]], and especially the latter's sister and the former's later wife, [[Bettina von Arnim]]. Most famous internationally, however, were the [[Brothers Grimm]], who collected many of their [[fairy tales]] here. The original building inspiring his drawing ''[[Rapunzel]]'s Tower'' stands in Amönau near Marburg. Across the Lahn hills, in the area called Schwalm, the costumes of little girls included a red hood.

=== Prussian town ===
In the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866, the [[Prince-elector]] of Hessen had backed [[Austria]]. Prussia won and took the opportunity to invade and annex the [[Electorate of Hessen]] (as well as [[Hanover]], the city of [[Frankfurt]], and other territories) north of the [[Main (river)|Main]] River. However, the pro-Austrian [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse-Darmstadt]] remained independent. For Marburg, this turn of events was very positive, because Prussia decided to make Marburg its main administrative centre in this part of the new province [[Hessen-Nassau]] and to turn the [[University of Marburg]] into the regional academic centre. Thus, Marburg's rise as an administrative and university city began. As the Prussian university system was one of the best in the world at the time, Marburg attracted many respected scholars. However, there was hardly any industry to speak of, so students, professors, and civil servants – who generally had enough but not much money and paid very little in taxes – dominated the town, which tended to be very conservative.

=== Twentieth century ===
{{update|section|date=August 2013}}
[[File:Marburg 30.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Wettergasse in the Old City]]
[[Franz von Papen]], vice-chancellor of Germany in 1934, delivered [[Marburg speech|an anti-Nazi speech]] at the University of Marburg on 17 June.

From 1942 to 1945, the whole city of Marburg was turned into a hospital with schools and government buildings turned into wards to augment the existing hospitals. By the spring of 1945, there were over 20,000 patients – mostly wounded German soldiers. As a result of its being designated a hospital city, there was not much damage from bombings except along the railroad tracks.

In 1945, the [[St. Elisabeth's Church (Marburg)|Elisabethkirche]] in Marburg became the final resting place of Field Marshal and President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] (1847-1934). He is also an honorary citizen of the town.

== Politics ==
As a larger mid-sized city, Marburg, like six other such cities in Hessen, has a special status as compared to the other municipalities in the district. This means that the city takes on tasks more usually performed by the district so that in many ways it is comparable to an [[Urban districts of Germany|urban district]] (''kreisfreie Stadt'').

The [[List of mayors of Marburg|mayor of Marburg]], Thomas Spies, in office since December 2015, and his predecessor [[Egon Vaupel]] (directly elected in January 2005), are from the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]. His deputy, the head of the building and youth departments, Dr. Franz Kahle, is from [[Alliance '90/The Greens]]. The majority in the 59-seat city parliament is held by a coalition of SPD (22 seats) and Green (13 seats) members. Also represented are the factions of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (14 seats), [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] (4 seats), the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (2 seats), a CDU splinter group MBL (''Marburger Bürgerliste'' – 2 seats), the BfM (''Bürger für Marburg'' – 1 seat) and the [[Pirate Party Germany|Pirate Party]] (1 seat).

Among the left wing groups are [[Association pour la taxation des transactions pour l'aide aux citoyens|ATTAC]], the [[Worldshop]] movement, an [[Autonomism|autonomist]]-[[Anarchism|anarchist]] scene, and a few groups engaged in ecological or human-rights concerns.

The city of Marburg, similar to the cities of [[Heidelberg]], [[Tübingen]] and [[Göttingen]], has a rich history of student fraternities or ''[[Studentenverbindung|Verbindungen]]'' of various sorts, including Corps, Landsmannschaften, Burschenschaften, Turnierschaften, etc.

==Coat of arms==
Marburg's coat of arms shows a Hessian landgrave riding a white horse with a flag and a shield on a red background. The shield shows the red-and-white-striped Hessian lion, also to be seen on Hessen's state arms, and the flag shows a stylized M, blue on gold (or yellow). The arms are also the source of the city flag's colors. The flag has three horizontal stripes colored, from top to bottom, red (from the background), white (from the horse) and blue (from the shield).

The coat of arms, which was designed in the late nineteenth century, is based on a landgrave seal on a municipal document. It is an example of a very prevalent practice of replacing forgotten coats of arms, or ones deemed not to be representative enough, with motifs taken from seals.

== Marburg virus ==
{{Main|Marburg virus}}
The city's name is connected to a [[filovirus]], the [[Marburg virus]], because this [[Marburg virus disease|disease]], a [[viral hemorrhagic fever]] resembling [[ebola]], was first recognized and described during an outbreak in the city. In 1967, workers were accidentally exposed to infected [[green monkey]] tissue at the city's former industrial plant, the Behring-Werke, then part of Hoechst and today of [[CSL Behring]], founded by Marburg citizen and first [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Medicine]] winner, [[Emil Adolf von Behring]]. During the outbreak, 31 people became infected and seven of them died. The virus is named after the city following the custom of naming viruses after the location of their first recorded outbreak.

== Green city ==
Many homes have solar panels and in 2008 a law was passed to make the installation of solar systems on new buildings or as part of renovation projects mandatory. 20 percent of heating system requirements ought to have been covered by solar energy in new buildings. Anyone who fails to install solar panels would have been fined €1,000. The new law, approved on 20 June 2008, should have taken effect in October 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/06/21/europe/EU-GEN-Germany-Solar.php German college town Marburg becomes first in the nation to require solar panels on new buildings, International Herald Tribune]&lt;/ref&gt; however, this law was stopped by the Regierungspräsidium Giessen in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.faz.net/s/Rub5785324EF29440359B02AF69CB1BB8CC/Doc~EA619A3ED4C284B459E1CBD529351BAF5~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html Marburger Solarsatzung vor dem aus (in german)]&lt;/ref&gt;

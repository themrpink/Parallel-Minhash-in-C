[[File:Alexander's Ragtime Band - Billy Murray.ogg|thumb|&quot;Alexander's Ragtime Band&quot;, performed by [[Billy Murray (singer)|Billy Murray]], Edison Amberol cylinder, 1911]]
'''Irving Berlin''' (born '''Israel Beilin'''; {{lang-yi|ישראל ביילין}}; May 11, 1888&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Irving Berlin|url=https://www.irvingberlin.com/biography|website=Irving Berlin| language=en-US| access-date=2020-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; – September 22, 1989) was an American [[composer]] and [[lyricist]], widely considered one of the greatest songwriters in American history. His music forms a great part of the [[Great American Songbook]]. Born in [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], Berlin arrived in the United States at the age of five. He published his first song, &quot;Marie from Sunny Italy&quot;, in 1907, receiving 33 cents for the publishing rights,&lt;ref name=&quot;Starr 2009, pg. 64&quot;&gt;Starr, Larry and Waterman, Christopher, American Popular Music: From Minstrelsy to MP3, Oxford University Press, 2009, pg. 64&lt;/ref&gt;   and had his first major international hit, &quot;[[Alexander's Ragtime Band]]&quot;, in 1911. He also was an owner of the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. It is commonly believed that Berlin could not read sheet music, and was such a limited piano player that he could only play in the key of F-sharp using his custom piano equipped with a transposing lever.&lt;ref name=Guitar&gt;{{cite book| last=Marcus| first=Gary| title=Guitar Zero| url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Guitar_Zero/7Y14qFrDKb8C?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=berlin| publisher=Penguin Press| date=January 19, 2012| page=164| isbn=978-1101552285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Alexander's Ragtime Band&quot; sparked an international dance craze in places as far away as Berlin's native Russia, which also &quot;flung itself into the ragtime beat with an abandon bordering on mania.&quot; Over the years he was known for writing music and lyrics in the American vernacular: uncomplicated, simple and direct, with his stated aim being to &quot;reach the heart of the average American,&quot; whom he saw as the &quot;real soul of the country.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt; In doing so, said [[Walter Cronkite]], at Berlin's 100th birthday tribute, he &quot;helped write the story of this country, capturing the best of who we are and the dreams that shape our lives.&quot;&lt;ref name=birthday&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uV4frZIkIQ Carnegie Hall, May 27, 1988], Irving Berlin's 100th birthday celebration&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote hundreds of songs, many becoming major hits, which made him famous before he turned thirty. During his 60-year career he wrote an estimated 1,500 songs, including the scores for 20 original Broadway shows and 15 original [[Hollywood]] films, with his songs nominated eight times for [[Academy Awards]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt; Many songs became popular themes and anthems, including &quot;[[Alexander's Ragtime Band]]&quot;, &quot;[[Easter Parade (song)|Easter Parade]]&quot;, &quot;[[Puttin' on the Ritz]]&quot;, &quot;[[Cheek to Cheek]]&quot;, &quot;[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]&quot;, &quot;[[Happy Holiday (song)|Happy Holiday]]&quot;, &quot;[[Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better)]]&quot;, and &quot;[[There's No Business Like Show Business]]&quot;. His Broadway musical and 1943 film ''[[This is the Army]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=This Is the Army (1943)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036430/|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Ronald Reagan]], had [[Kate Smith]] singing Berlin's &quot;[[God Bless America]]&quot; which was first performed in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEJo7x9y3D4 &quot;Kate Smith, &quot;God Bless America&quot;], 5 min.&lt;/ref&gt;

Berlin's songs have reached the top of the charts 25 times and have been extensively re-recorded by numerous singers including [[The Andrews Sisters]], [[Perry Como]], [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]], [[Al Jolson]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Ethel Merman]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Rosemary Clooney]], [[Cher]], [[Diana Ross]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Ruth Etting]], [[Fanny Brice]], [[Marilyn Miller]], [[Rudy Vallée]], [[Nat King Cole]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Doris Day]], [[Jerry Garcia]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Michael Bublé|Michael Buble]], [[Lady Gaga]], and [[Christina Aguilera]].

Berlin died in 1989 at [[centenarian|the age of 101]]. Composer [[Douglas Moore]] sets Berlin apart from all other contemporary songwriters, and includes him instead with [[Stephen Foster]], [[Walt Whitman]], and [[Carl Sandburg]], as a &quot;great American minstrel&quot;—someone who has &quot;caught and immortalized in his songs what we say, what we think about, and what we believe.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt;  Composer [[George Gershwin]] called him &quot;the greatest songwriter that has ever lived&quot;,&lt;ref name=Gershwin/&gt;{{rp|117}} and composer [[Jerome Kern]] concluded that &quot;Irving Berlin has no ''place'' in American music—he ''is'' American music.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYT-87/&gt;

==Early life==

===Jewish immigrant===

====Life in Russia====

Berlin was born '''Israel Beilin'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Irving Berlin| url=https://www.irvingberlin.com/| website=Irving Berlin| language=en-US| access-date=2020-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; on May 11, 1888, in the [[Russian Empire]]. Although his family came from the [[shtetl]] of [[Talachyn|Tolochin]] (today in Belarus), documents say that he was born in [[Tyumen]], Siberia.&lt;ref name=&quot;FuriaWood1998&quot;/&gt; He was one of eight children of Moses (1848–1901) and Lena Lipkin Beilin (1850–1922). His father, a [[Hazzan|cantor]] in a [[synagogue]], uprooted the family to America, as did many other Jewish families in the late 19th century. 

On September 14, 1893,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ancestry.com/search/collections/russianarrivalsimmigrationdatafile/?name=_Beilin&amp;arrival=1893-9&amp;arrival_x=0-0-0&amp;count=50&amp;name_x=_1| website=Ancestry.com| title=Passenger list of the Beilin family| url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; the family arrived at [[Ellis Island]] in New York City. When they arrived, Israel was put in a pen with his brother and five sisters until immigration officials declared them fit to be allowed into the city.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7C-rR_ihoOw&amp;t=1m39s &quot;Irving Berlin - The Voice of the City&quot;], BBC Bristol and A&amp;E network's 1988 broadcast&lt;/ref&gt; 

After their arrival, the name &quot;Beilin&quot; was changed to &quot;Baline&quot;. According to biographer [[Laurence Bergreen]], as an adult Berlin admitted to no memories of his first five years in Russia except for one: &quot;he was lying on a blanket by the side of a road, watching his house burn to the ground. By daylight the house was in ashes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Bergreen&gt;{{cite book| last=Bergreen| first=Laurence| title=As Thousands Cheer| url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/As_Thousands_Cheer/8ZgJu3UKRfIC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=as+thousands+cheer&amp;printsec=frontcover| edition=reprint| publisher=Hachette Books| date=March 22, 1996| isbn=978-0306806759}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}}  As an adult, Berlin said he was unaware of being raised in abject poverty since he knew no other life.&lt;ref name=Whitcomb&gt;{{cite book| last=Whitcomb| first=Ian| title=Irving Berlin and Ragtime America| publisher=Century| year=1987| isbn=9780712616645}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}}

The Berlins were one of hundreds of thousands of other Jewish families who emigrated to the United States in the late 1800s and early 1900s, escaping discrimination, poverty and brutal [[pogrom]]s. Other such families included those of [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]], [[Al Jolson]], [[Sophie Tucker]], [[L. Wolfe Gilbert]], [[Jack Yellen]], [[Louis B. Mayer]] (of [[MGM]]), and the [[Warner Bros.|Warner brothers]].&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;{{rp|14}}

====Settling in New York City====
[[File:LES, 1910.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Lower East Side in the early 1900s]]
After their arrival in New York City, the Baline family lived briefly in a basement flat on Monroe Street, and then moved to a three-room tenement at 330 [[Cherry Street (Manhattan)|Cherry Street]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; His father, unable to find comparable work as a cantor in New York, took a job at a [[kosher]] meat market and gave Hebrew lessons on the side to support his family. He died a few years later when Irving was thirteen years old.&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;

Now, with only a few years of schooling, eight-year-old Irving began helping to support his family.&lt;ref name=NYT-obit&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/23/obituaries/irving-berlin-nation-s-songwriter-dies.html “Irving Berlin, Nation's Songwriter, Dies”], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 23, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; He became a newspaper boy, hawking ''The Evening Journal.'' One day while delivering newspapers, according to Berlin's biographer and friend, [[Alexander Woollcott]], he stopped to look at a ship departing for China and became so entranced that he did not see a swinging crane, which knocked him into the river. When he was fished out after going down for the third time, he was still holding in his clenched fist the five pennies he earned that day.&lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Woollcott&gt;{{cite book| last=Woollcott| first=Alexander| title=The Story of Irving Berlin| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ez7DAAAQBAJ&amp;q=the+story+of+irving+berlin| publisher=Read Books Ltd|date=September 26, 2016| isbn=978-1473359604| access-date=June 5, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His mother took a job as a [[midwife]], and three of his sisters worked wrapping cigars, common for immigrant girls. His older brother worked in a sweatshop assembling shirts. Each evening, when the family came home from their day's work, Bergreen writes, &quot;they would deposit the coins they had earned that day into Lena's outspread apron.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergreen&quot;/&gt; {{rp|11}}

Music historian [[Philip Furia]] writes that when &quot;Izzy&quot; began to sell newspapers in the [[Bowery]], he was exposed to the music and sounds coming from saloons and restaurants that lined the crowded streets. Young Berlin sang some of the songs he heard while selling papers, and people would toss him some coins. He confessed to his mother one evening that his newest ambition in life was to become a singing waiter in a saloon.&lt;ref name=Furia-Poets&gt;{{cite book| last=Furia| first=Philip| title=The Poets of Tin Pan Alley| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZNsc1AnOnSkC&amp;q=the+poets+of+tin+pan+alley| publisher=Oxford Univ. Press| date=June 25, 1992| isbn=978-0198022886}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|48}}

However, before Berlin was fourteen his meager income was still adding less than his sisters' to the family's budget, which made him feel worthless.&lt;ref name=Woollcott/&gt; He then decided to leave home and join the city's ragged army of other young immigrants.&lt;ref name=Bergreen/&gt;{{rp|15}} He lived in the Bowery, taking up residence in one of the lodging houses that sheltered the thousands of other homeless boys in the [[Lower East Side]]. Bergreen describes them as being uncharitable living quarters, &quot;[[Charles Dickens|Dickensian]] in their meanness, filth, and insensitivity to ordinary human beings.&quot;&lt;ref name=Bergreen/&gt;{{rp|15}}

===Early jobs===
[[File:Irving Berlin 1906.jpg|thumb|left|Berlin at his first job with a music publisher, aged 18]]
Having left school around the age of thirteen,&lt;ref name=&quot;FuriaWood1998&quot; /&gt; Berlin had few survival skills and realized that formal employment was out of the question. His only ability was acquired from his father's vocation as a singer, and he joined with several other youngsters who went to saloons on the Bowery and sang to customers. Itinerant young singers like them were common on the Lower East Side. Berlin would sing a few of the popular ballads he heard on the street, hoping people would pitch him a few pennies. From these seamy surroundings, he became streetwise, with real and lasting education. Music was his only source of income and he picked up the language and culture of the ghetto lifestyle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Early Career of Irving Berlin&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Maslon |first1=Laurence |title=Early Career and Tin Pan Alley |url=http://www.irvingberlin.com/early-career-and-tin-pan-alley |website=Irving Berlin |publisher=The Irving Berlin Music Company |access-date=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berlin learned what kind of songs appealed to audiences, writes Begreen: &quot;well-known tunes expressing simple sentiments were the most reliable.&quot;&lt;ref name=Bergreen/&gt;{{rp|17}} He soon began [[Song-plugger|plugging songs]] at [[Tony Pastor]]'s Music Hall in [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]] and in 1906, when he was 18, got a job as a singing waiter at the Pelham Cafe in [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]]. Besides serving drinks, he sang made-up &quot;blue&quot; parodies of hit songs to the delight of customers.

Biographer Charles Hamm writes that in Berlin's free time after hours, he taught himself to play the piano.&lt;ref name=Hamm&gt;Hamm, Charles. ''Irving Berlin: Songs from the Melting Pot'', Oxford Univ. Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Never having lessons, after the bar closed for the night, young Berlin would sit at a piano in the back and begin improvising tunes.&lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt; His first attempt at actual songwriting was &quot;Marie From Sunny Italy,&quot; written in collaboration with the Pelham's resident pianist, Mike Nicholson, from which he earned 37 cents in royalties.&lt;ref name=&quot;FuriaWood1998&quot; /&gt; A spelling error on the sheet music to the published song included the spelling of his name as &quot;I. Berlin.&quot;&lt;ref name=Freedland&gt;Freedland, Michael. 'Irving Berlin', Stein and Day, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

Berlin continued writing and playing music at Pelham Cafe and developing an early style. He liked the words to other people's songs but sometimes the rhythms were &quot;kind of boggy,&quot; and he might change them. One night he delivered some hits composed by his friend, [[George M. Cohan]], another kid who was getting known on Broadway with his own songs. When Berlin ended with Cohan's &quot;Yankee Doodle Boy,&quot; notes Whitcomb, &quot;everybody in the joint applauded the feisty little fellow.&quot;

===Recognition as songwriter===
Max Winslow (c. 1883–1942), a staff member at music publisher [[Harry Von Tilzer]] Company, noticed Berlin's singing on many occasions and became so taken with his talent that he tried to get him a job with his firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1942/06/09/archives/max-winslow-dead-music-publisher-59-official-of-irving-berlin-inc.html |title=Max Winslow Dead; Music Publisher, 59| newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 9, 1942 |access-date=June 5, 2020 |url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Tilzer said that Max claimed to have &quot;discovered a great kid,&quot; and raved about him so much that Von Tilzer hired Berlin.&lt;ref name=Hamm/&gt;{{rp|viii}}

Later, in 1908, when he was 20, Berlin took a new job at a saloon named Jimmy Kelly's in the Union Square neighborhood.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; There, he was able to collaborate with other young songwriters, such as [[Edgar Leslie]], [[Ted Snyder]], [[Al Piantadosi]], and [[George A. Whiting]]. In 1909, the year of the premiere of [[Israel Zangwill]]'s ''[[The Melting Pot (play)|The Melting Pot]]'', he got another big break as a staff lyricist with the [[Ted Snyder Company]].

==Songwriting career==
===Before 1920===
====&quot;Alexander's Ragtime Band&quot; (1911)====
{{quote box|title=Ragtime a Form of Insanity|align=right|width=25em|bgcolor = LightCyan|quote='Alexander's Ragtime Band' is a public menace....Hysteria is the form of insanity that an abnormal love for ragtime seems to produce. It is as much a mental disease as acute mania—it has the same symptoms. When there is nothing done to check this form it produces idiocy.|source= — Dr. Ludwig Gruener&lt;br /&gt;German newspaper story&lt;ref name=Leopold&gt;Leopold, David. ''Irving Berlin's Show Business'', Harry Abrams (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}}}}

Berlin rose as a songwriter in [[Tin Pan Alley]] and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. In 1911, [[Emma Carus]] introduced his first world-famous hit, &quot;[[Alexander's Ragtime Band]]&quot;, followed by a performance from Berlin himself at the Friars' Frolic of 1911.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; He became an instant celebrity, and the featured performer later that year at [[Oscar Hammerstein I|Oscar Hammerstein]]'s vaudeville house, where he introduced dozens of other songs. The ''New York Telegraph'' described how two hundred of his street friends came to see &quot;their boy&quot; on stage: &quot;All the little writer could do was to finger the buttons on his coat while tears ran down his cheeks—in a vaudeville house!&quot;&lt;ref name=Hamm/&gt;{{rp|ix}}

[[File:Irving Berlin - Ragtime.JPG|thumb|left|Berlin with film stars [[Alice Faye]], [[Tyrone Power]] and [[Don Ameche]] singing chorus from ''Alexander's Ragtime Band'' (1938)]]

[[Richard Corliss]], in a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' profile of Berlin, described &quot;Alexander's Ragtime Band&quot; as a march, not a [[ragtime|rag]], &quot;its savviest musicality comprised quotes from a [[bugle call]] and &quot;[[Swanee River (song)|Swanee River]].&quot; The tune revived the [[ragtime]] fervor that [[Scott Joplin]] had begun a decade earlier, and made Berlin a songwriting star.&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt; From its first and subsequent releases, the song was near the top of the charts as others sang it: [[Bessie Smith]], in 1927, and [[Louis Armstrong]], in 1937; no. 1 by [[Bing Crosby]] and Connee Boswell; [[Johnny Mercer]] in 1945; [[Al Jolson]], in 1947 and [[Nellie Lutcher]] in 1948. Add [[Ray Charles]]'s [[big-band]] version in 1959, and &quot;Alexander&quot; had a dozen hit versions in just under a half century.&lt;ref name=Corliss&gt;Corliss, Richard (December 24, 2001). [http://www.time.com/time/sampler/article/0,8599,189846,00.html &quot;That Old Christmas Feeling: Irving America: Richard Corliss remembers Irving Berlin&quot;] ''Time''. &lt;/ref&gt;

Initially the song was not recognized as a hit, however; Broadway producer [[Jesse Lasky]] was uncertain about using it, although he did include it in his &quot;Follies&quot; show. It was performed as an instrumental but did not impress audiences, and was soon dropped from the show's score. Berlin regarded it as a failure. He then wrote lyrics to the score, played it again in another Broadway Review, and this time ''Variety'' news weekly called it &quot;the musical sensation of the decade.&quot;&lt;ref name=Bergreen/&gt;{{rp|68}} Composer [[George Gershwin]], foreseeing its influence, said it was &quot;the first real American musical work,&quot; adding, &quot;Berlin had shown us the way; it was now easier to attain our ideal.&quot;&lt;ref name=Gershwin/&gt;{{rp|117}}

====Sparking a national dance craze====
[[File:Irving Berlin in New York City, circa 1911.jpg|thumb|upright|Enjoying early success in New York, c. 1911]]
Berlin was &quot;flabbergasted&quot; by the sudden international popularity of the song, and wondered why it became a sudden hit. He decided it was partly because the lyrics, &quot;silly though it was, was fundamentally right...[and] the melody... started the heels and shoulders of all America and a good section of Europe to rocking.&quot;&lt;ref name=Bergreen/&gt;{{rp|69}} In 1913, Berlin was featured in the London revue Hello Ragtime, where he introduced &quot;[[That International Rag]]&quot;, a song he had written for the occasion.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

;&quot;Watch Your Step&quot;
Furia writes that the international success of &quot;Alexander's Ragtime Band&quot;  gave [[ragtime]] &quot;new life and sparked a national dance craze.&quot; Two dancers who expressed that craze were [[Vernon and Irene Castle]]. In 1914, Berlin wrote a ragtime revue, &quot;[[Watch Your Step (musical)|Watch Your Step]],&quot; which starred the couple and showcased their talents on stage. That musical revue became Berlin's first complete score with songs that &quot;radiated musical and lyrical sophistication.&quot; Berlin's songs signified [[modernism]], and they signified the cultural struggle between [[Victorian era|Victorian]] gentility and the &quot;purveyors of liberation, indulgence, and leisure,&quot; says Furia. The song &quot;[[Play a Simple Melody]]&quot; became the first of his famous &quot;double&quot; songs in which two different melodies and lyrics are [[counterpoint]]ed against one another.&lt;ref name=Furia-Poets/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;audio: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaGkvhxcOWI &quot;Play A Simple Melody&quot;, with Bing and Gary Crosby]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Variety'' called &quot;Watch Your Step&quot; the &quot;first syncopated musical,&quot; where the &quot;sets and the girls were gorgeous.&quot; Berlin was then twenty-six, and the success of the show was riding on his name alone. ''Variety'' said the show was a &quot;terrific hit&quot; from its opening night. It compared Berlin's newfound status as a composer with that of the Times building: &quot;That youthful marvel of syncopated melody is proving things in &quot;Watch Your Step&quot;, firstly that he is not alone a rag composer, and that he is one of the greatest lyric writers America has ever produced.&quot;&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;{{rp|173}}

Whitcomb also points out the irony that Russia, the country Berlin's family was forced to leave, flung itself into &quot;the ragtime beat with an abandon bordering on mania.&quot; For example, Prince [[Felix Yusupov]], a recent Oxford undergraduate of Russian noble lineage and heir to the largest estate in Russia, was described by his dance partner as &quot;wriggling around the ballroom like a demented worm, screaming for 'more ragtime and more champagne'.&quot;&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;{{rp|183}}

====Simple and romantic ballads====

Some of the songs Berlin created came out of his own sadness. For instance, in 1912 he married [[Dorothy Goetz]], the sister of songwriter [[E. Ray Goetz]]. She died six months later of [[typhoid fever]] contracted during their honeymoon in [[Havana]]. The song he wrote to express his grief, &quot;When I Lost You,&quot; was his first ballad. It was an immediate popular hit and sold more than a million copies.&lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt;

He began to realize that ragtime was not a good musical style for serious romantic expression, and over the next few years adapted his style by writing more love songs.&lt;ref name=Furia-Poets/&gt; In 1915 he wrote the hit &quot;I Love a Piano&quot;, a comical and erotic ragtime love song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/I-Love-A-Piano-lyrics-Irving-Berlin/61706587FB23D96F48256970000E8508 |title=I Love A Piano Lyrics – Irving Berlin |publisher=Sing365.com |access-date=January 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1918 he had written hundreds of songs, mostly topical, which enjoyed brief popularity. Many of the songs were for the new dances then appearing, such as the [[Grizzly Bear (dance)|grizzly bear]], [[Chicken walks|chicken walk]], or [[foxtrot]]. After a Hawaiian dance craze began, he wrote &quot;That Hula-Hula&quot;, and then did a string of southern songs, such as &quot;When the Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves for Alabam&quot;. During this period, he was creating a few new songs every week, including songs aimed at the various immigrant cultures arriving from Europe. On one occasion, Berlin, whose face was still not known, was on a train trip and decided to entertain the fellow passengers with some music. They asked him how he knew so many hit songs, and Berlin modestly replied, &quot;I wrote them.&quot;&lt;ref name=Furia-Poets/&gt;{{rp|53}}

An important song that Berlin wrote during his transition from writing ragtime to lyrical ballads was &quot;[[A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody]],&quot; which became one of Berlin's &quot;first big guns,&quot; says historian [[Alec Wilder]]. The song was written for [[Ziegfeld]]'s ''Follies of 1919'' and became the musical's lead song. Its popularity was so great that it later became the theme for all of Ziegfeld's revues, and the theme song in the 1936 film ''[[The Great Ziegfeld]]''.&lt;ref&gt;video: [http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3ick8_a-pretty-girl-is-like-a-melody-the_shortfilms &quot;A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Wilder puts it on the same level as [[Jerome Kern]]'s &quot;pure melodies,&quot; and in comparison with Berlin's earlier music, says it's &quot;extraordinary that such a development in style and sophistication should have taken place in a single year.&quot;&lt;ref name=Furia-Poets/&gt;{{rp|53}}

====World War I====
On April 1, 1917, after President [[Woodrow Wilson]] declared that America would enter [[World War I]], Berlin felt that [[Tin Pan Alley]] should do its duty and support the war with inspirational songs. Berlin wrote the song, &quot;For Your Country and My Country&quot;, stating that &quot;we must speak with the sword not the pen to show our appreciation to America for opening up her heart and welcoming every immigrant group.&quot; He also co-wrote a song aimed at ending ethnic conflict, &quot;Let's All Be Americans Now.&quot;&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;{{rp|197}}

In 1917, Berlin was drafted into the [[United States Army]], and his induction became headline news, with one paper headline reading, &quot;Army Takes Berlin!&quot; But the Army wanted Berlin, now aged 30, to do what he knew best: write songs. While stationed with the [[152nd Depot Brigade]] at [[Camp Upton]], he then composed an all-soldier musical revue titled &quot;[[Yip Yip Yaphank]]&quot;, written to be patriotic tribute to the [[United States Army]]. By the following summer, the show was taken to Broadway where it also included a number of hits, including &quot;[[Mandy (Irving Berlin song)|Mandy]]&quot; and &quot;[[Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning]]&quot;, which he performed himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-obit&quot; /&gt;

The shows earned $150,000 for a camp service center. One song he wrote for the show but decided not to use, he would introduce twenty years later: &quot;God Bless America.&quot;&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

Berlin returned to [[Tin Pan Alley]] after the war and in 1921 created a partnership with Sam Harris to build the [[Music Box Theater]]. He maintained an interest in the theater throughout his life, and even in his last years was known to call the [[Shubert Organization]], his partner, to check on the receipts. In its early years, the theater was a showcase for revues by Berlin. As theater owner, producer and composer, he looked after every detail of his shows, from the costumes and sets to the casting and musical arrangements.&lt;ref name=NYT-Dreaming&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2D71430F930A15751C1A9639C8B63 &quot;Dreaming of Irving Berlin In the Season That He Owned&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 23, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Berlin biographer David Leopold, the theater, located at 239 West 45th St., was the only Broadway house built to accommodate the works of a songwriter. It was the home of Berlin's &quot;Music Box Revue&quot; from 1921 to 1925 and &quot;As Thousands Cheer&quot; in 1933 and today includes an exhibition devoted to Berlin in the lobby.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, David.

====Various hit songs by Berlin====
By 1926, Berlin had written the scores to two editions of the ''Ziegfeld Follies'' and four &quot;Music Box Revues.&quot; Berlin's &quot;Music Box Revues&quot; spanned the years of 1921-1926, premiering songs such as &quot;Say It With Music&quot;, &quot;Everybody Step&quot;, and &quot;Pack Up Your Things and Go to the Devil&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt; ''Life magazine'' called him the &quot;Lullaby Kid&quot;, noting that &quot;couples at country-club dances grew misty-eyed when the band went into &quot;Always&quot;, because they were positive that Berlin had written it just for them. When they quarreled and parted in the bitter-sweetness of the 1920s, it was Berlin who gave eloquence to their heartbreak by way of &quot;[[What'll I Do]]&quot; and &quot;Remember&quot; and &quot;All Alone.&quot;&lt;ref name=Life/&gt;

;&quot;[[What'll I Do?]]&quot; (1924)
This ballad of love and longing was a hit record for [[Paul Whiteman]] and had several other successful recordings in 1924. Twenty-four years later, the song went to no. 22 for [[Nat Cole]] and no. 23 for [[Frank Sinatra]].&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt;

;&quot;[[Always (Irving Berlin song)|Always]]&quot; (1925)
Written when he fell in love with Ellin Mackay, who later became his wife. The song became a hit twice (for [[Vincent Lopez]] and [[George Olsen]]) in its first incarnation. There were four more hit versions in 1944–45. In 1959, [[Sammy Turner]] took the song to no. 2 on the R&amp;B chart. It became [[Patsy Cline]]'s postmortem anthem and hit no. 18 on the country chart in 1980, 17 years after her death, and a tribute musical called &quot;Always... Patsy Cline&quot;, played a two-year [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] run that ended in 1995.&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt; [[Leonard Cohen]] included a cover of this song on his 1992 release ''[[The Future (Leonard Cohen album)]]''.

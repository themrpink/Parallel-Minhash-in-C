The Russians began exploration in their territory around the same time, encouraged by their success in the [[Timan-Pechora Basin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dore1995&quot;/&gt;  They drilled their first wells in the early 1980s, and some very large gas fields were discovered throughout this decade.  The [[Shtokman field]] was discovered in 1988 and is classed as a [[Giant oil and gas fields|giant]] gas field: currently the [[List of natural gas fields|5th-largest gas field in the world]].  Similar practical difficulties Barents Sea resulted in a decline in Russian exploration, aggravated by the nation's political instability of the 1990s.

===Fishing===
[[File:Honningsvåg 2013 06 09 3495 (10319135545).jpg|thumb|[[Honningsvåg]] is the most northerly fishing village in Norway]]
The Barents Sea contains the world's largest remaining cod population,&lt;ref name=&quot;WWF1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = The Barents Sea Cod – the last of the large cod stocks | publisher = [[World Wildlife Foundation]] | url = http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/all_publications/?12982/The-Barents-Sea-Cod-the-last-of-the-large-cod-stocks| access-date = 4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as important stocks of haddock and capelin.  Fishing is managed jointly by Russia and Norway in the form of the [[Joint Norwegian–Russian Fisheries Commission]], established in 1976, in an attempt to keep track of how many fish are leaving the ecosystem due to fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fni.no/projects/norwegian_russian_fisheries_commission.html|title=The History of the Joint Norwegian-Russian Fisheries Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Joint Norwegian-Russian Fisheries Commission sets Total Allowable Catches (TACs) for multiple species throughout their migratory tracks.  Through the Commission, Norway and Russia also exchange fishing quotas and catch statistics to ensure the TACs are not being violated.  

But there are problems with reporting under this system, and researchers believe that they do not have accurate data for the effects of fishing on the Barents Sea ecosystem. Cod is one of the major catches. A large portion of catches are not reported when the fishing boats land, in order to account for profits that are being lost to high taxes and fees.  Since many fishermen do not strictly follow the TACs and rules set forth by the Commission, the amount of fish being extracted annually from the Barents Sea is underestimated.

===Barents Sea biodiversity and marine bioprospecting===
The Barents Sea, where temperate waters from the Gulf Stream and cold waters from the Arctic meet, is home to an enormous diversity of organisms, which are well adapted to the extreme conditions of their marine habitats. This makes these arctic species very attractive for marine [[bioprospecting]]. Marine bioprospecting may be defined as the search for bioactive molecules and compounds from marine sources having new, unique properties and the potential for commercial applications. Amongst others, applications include medicines, food and feed, textiles, cosmetics and the process industry.

The Norwegian government strategically supports the development of marine bioprospecting as it has the potential to contribute to new and sustainable wealth creation. Tromsø and the northern areas of Norway play a central role in this strategy. They have excellent access to unique Arctic marine organisms, existing marine industries, and R&amp;D competence and infrastructure in this region. Since 2007, science and industry have cooperated closely on bioprospecting, and the development and commercialization of new products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nasjonal Strategi 2009|title=Marin bioprospektering – en kilde til ny og bærekraftig verdiskaping|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/upload/FKD/Vedlegg/Diverse/2009/Marin_bioprospektering_080909_lavoppl.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Institutions and industry supporting marine bioprospecting in Barents Sea====
[[File:Mar de Barents, Noruega, 2019-09-03, DD 09-14 PAN.jpg|thumb|Panoramic view of the Barents sea near Honningsvåg, Norway.]]
MabCent-SFI is one of fourteen Research-Based Innovation Centers initiated by the Research Council of Norway. It is the only one within the field of “bioactive compounds and drug discovery” that is based on bioactives from marine organisms. MabCent-SFI maintains a focus on bioactives from Arctic and sub-Arctic organisms. By the end of 2011, MabCent had tested about 200,000 extracts, finding several hundred &quot;hits&quot;.  Through further research and development, some of these hits will become valuable &quot;leads&quot;, i.e. characterized compounds known to possess biological effects of interest.

The commercial partners in MabCent-SFI are Biotec Pharmacon ASA and its subsidiary ArcticZymes AS, ABC BioScience AS, Lytix Biopharma AS and Pronova BioPharma ASA.  ArcticZymes is also a partner in MARZymes, a project financed by the Research Council of Norway to find marine enzymes which are adapted to the extreme conditions in the Arctic. The science partners in MabCent-SFI are Marbank, a national marine biobank located in Tromsø; Marbio, a medium/high-throughput platform for screening and identification of bioactive compounds; and Norstruct, a protein structure determination platform. Mabcent-SFI is hosted by the [[University of Tromsø]].

[http://www.biotechnorth.no/ BioTech North] is an emerging biotechnology cluster of enterprises and R&amp;D organizations, which cooperate closely with regional funding and development actors (triple helix). As bioactive molecules and compounds from Arctic marine resources form the basis of activities for the majority of the cluster members, BioTech North serves as a marine biotech cluster. The majority of BioTech North’s enterprises are active within life science applications and markets. To date the cluster contains around thirty organizations from both the private and public sector. It has received Arena status and is funded through the [ Arena] programme financed by [http://www.innovasjonnorge.no/ Innovation Norway], [http://siva.no/ SIVA] and [[The Research Council of Norway]].

A '''convulsion''' is a medical condition where body [[muscles]] contract and relax rapidly and repeatedly, resulting in uncontrolled actions of the body.&lt;ref name=MedlinePlusEncyclopedia003200&gt;{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|003200|Seizures}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because [[epileptic seizure|epileptic seizures]] typically include convulsions, the term ''convulsion'' is sometimes used as a synonym for ''seizure''. However, not all epileptic seizures lead to convulsions, and not all convulsions are caused by epileptic seizures. Convulsions are also consistent with an [[electric shock]] and improper enriched air scuba diving. For non-epileptic convulsions, see [[non-epileptic seizure]]s.

The word &quot;fit&quot; is sometimes used to mean a convulsion or epileptic seizure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fit%5B3%5D Merriam-Webster: Fit].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
{{how-to|section|date=August 2019}}
When a person is having a convulsion, they may experience several different symptoms. These may include: a brief blackout, confusion, drooling, loss of bowel/bladder control, sudden shaking of entire body, uncontrollable [[muscle spasm]]s, temporary cessation of breathing, and many more. Symptoms usually last from a few seconds to around 15 minutes. If someone has a fit like this, it is advised to make sure they do not fall and injure themselves, cushion their head and loosen any restricting clothing/jewelry, and also call for medical help. This should be done whether or not they have fallen, the helper should make sure that if they fall the helper does not 1)try to pin/hold them in place, as this could possibly cause harm or injury to the individual 2)does not cushion their head for this may cause the subject to hurt their neck when undergoing any sort of spasm and 3)does not place any body part in-between the person's teeth during a seizure (including any fingers) to stop the chattering and or clenching of teeth, if wanting to protect the subject from injuring themselves (involving fracturing of the teeth and or chewing on cheeks inner lining causing more pain and bleeding) through the clenching of their teeth, the helper may place a leather object like a belt or wallet (without any cards in it), between their teeth.&lt;ref name=MedlinePlusEncyclopedia003200/&gt;

===Generalized seizures===
{{main|Tonic-clonic seizures}}

The most common type of seizure is called a generalized seizure, also known as a generalized convulsion. This is characterized by a loss of consciousness which may lead to the person collapsing. The body stiffens for about a minute and then jerks uncontrollably for the next minute. During this, the patient may fall and injure themselves or bite their tongue and lose control of their bladder. A familial history of this puts a person at a greater risk for developing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/guide/types-of-seizures-their-symptoms |title=Epilepsy Seizure Types and Symptoms |website=WebMD}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/grand-mal-seizure/basics/causes/con-20021356 |title=Grand mal seizure causes |publisher=Mayo Clinic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Convulsions are the result of abnormal electrical activity in the [[brain]]. The specific cause is often not clear. Convulsions can be caused by specific chemicals in the blood, as well as infections like [[meningitis]] or [[encephalitis]]. A common cause in children is [[febrile seizures]]. Other possibilities include [[celiac disease]],&lt;ref name='&quot;NIDDK-CD2016&quot;'&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition &amp; Facts for Celiac Disease. What are the complications of celiac disease?|url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/celiac-disease/definition-facts|publisher=[[National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases|NIDDK]]|date=June 2016|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[head trauma]], [[stroke]] or lack of oxygen to the brain. Sometimes the convulsion can be caused by genetic defects or [[brain tumor]]s.&lt;ref name=MedlinePlusEncyclopedia003200/&gt; Convulsions can also occur when the [[hypoglycemia|blood sugar is too low]] and deficiency of [[vitamin B6]] (pyridoxine).
In Nigeria, [[malaria]]&lt;ref name='&quot;PublicHealthNigeria&quot;'&gt;{{cite web|title=Management of Convulsion in Children, a Health concern in Nigeria|url=https://publichealthng.com/management-of-convulsion-in-children-a-health-concern-in-nigeria/|publisher=[[Public Health Nigeria]]|date=October 2018|accessdate=18 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181018054917/https://publichealthng.com/management-of-convulsion-in-children-a-health-concern-in-nigeria/|archive-date=18 October 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a very important cause of convulsions among children under 5 years of age.

{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2012}}
[[File:Ill-2 O3.jpg|thumb|X-rays start at ~0.008 nm and extend across the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] to ~8 nm, over which the [[Earth's atmosphere]] is [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]].]]
'''X-ray astronomy''' is an observational branch of [[astronomy]] which deals with the study of [[X-ray]] observation and detection from [[astronomical object]]s. [[X-radiation]] is absorbed by the [[Earth's atmosphere]], so instruments to detect X-rays must be taken to high altitude by [[Balloon-borne telescope|balloons]], [[sounding rocket]]s, and [[X-ray astronomy satellite|satellites]]. X-ray astronomy is the [[space science]] related to a type of [[space telescope]] that can see farther than standard light-absorption telescopes, such as the [[Mauna Kea Observatories]], via x-ray radiation.

[[X-ray generation|X-ray emission]] is expected from astronomical objects that contain extremely hot gases at temperatures from about a million [[kelvin]] (K) to hundreds of millions of kelvin (MK). Moreover, the maintenance of the E-layer of ionized gas high in the Earth's [[thermosphere]] also suggested a strong extraterrestrial source of X-rays. Although theory predicted that the [[Sun]] and the stars would be prominent X-ray sources, there was no way to verify this because Earth's atmosphere blocks most extraterrestrial X-rays. It was not until ways of sending instrument packages to high altitude were developed that these X-ray sources could be studied.

The existence of solar X-rays was confirmed early in the [[rocket age]] by [[V-2 sounding rocket|V-2s converted to sounding rocket]] purpose, and the detection of extraterrestrial X-rays has been the primary or secondary mission of multiple satellites since 1958.&lt;ref name=SP100&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |date=1966 |title=Significant Achievements in Solar Physics 1958-1964 |url= |location=Washington D.C. |publisher=NASA |pages=49–58 |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first cosmic (beyond the solar system) X-ray source was discovered by a sounding rocket in 1962. Called [[Scorpius X-1]] (Sco X-1) (the first X-ray source found in the [[constellation]] [[Scorpius (constellation)|Scorpius]]), the X-ray emission of Scorpius X-1 is 10,000 times greater than its visual emission, whereas that of the Sun is about a million times less. In addition, the energy output in X-rays is 100,000 times greater than the total emission of the [[Sun]] in all [[wavelength]]s.

Many thousands of X-ray sources have since been discovered. In addition, the space between [[galaxy|galaxies]] in [[galaxy clusters]] is filled with a very hot, but very dilute gas at a temperature between 100 and 1000 megakelvins (MK). The total amount of hot gas is five to ten times the total mass in the visible galaxies.

==Sounding rocket flights==
{{main|Sounding rocket}}
The first sounding rocket flights for X-ray research were accomplished at the [[White Sands Missile Range]] in [[New Mexico]] with a [[V-2 rocket]] on January 28, 1949. A detector was placed in the [[nose cone]] section and the rocket was launched in a suborbital flight to an altitude just above the atmosphere.

X-rays from the Sun were detected by the U.S. [[Naval Research Laboratory]] Blossom experiment on board.&lt;ref name=&quot;rockooni&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Chronology – Quarter 1 1949 |url=http://www.astronautix.com/chrono/19491.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408082333/http://www.astronautix.com/chrono/19491.htm |archivedate=April 8, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Aerobee]] 150 rocket was launched on June 12, 1962 and it detected the first X-rays from other celestial sources (Scorpius X-1).&lt;ref name=Giacconi&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Giacconi R |title=Nobel Lecture: The dawn of x-ray astronomy |journal=Rev Mod Phys|date=2003 |volume=75|issue=3|page=995|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.75.995 |bibcode=2003RvMP...75..995G|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now known that such X-ray sources as Sco X-1 are [[compact star]]s, such as [[neutron star]]s or [[black hole]]s. Material falling into a black hole may emit X-rays, but the black hole itself does not. The energy source for the X-ray emission is [[gravity]]. Infalling gas and dust is heated by the strong [[gravitational fields]] of these and other celestial objects.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Scorpius-X-1|title=Scorpius X-1|access-date=January 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on discoveries in this new field of X-ray astronomy, starting with Scorpius X-1, [[Riccardo Giacconi]] received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 2002.&lt;ref name=giacconibio&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2002/giacconi/biographical/|title=Riccardo Giacconi|access-date=January 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest drawback to rocket flights is their very short duration (just a few minutes above the atmosphere before the rocket falls back to Earth) and their limited [[field of view]]. A rocket launched from the United States will not be able to see sources in the southern sky; a rocket launched from Australia will not be able to see sources in the northern sky.

===X-ray Quantum Calorimeter (XQC) project===
[[File:Nike-Black Brant VC XQC launch.gif|thumb|right|A launch of the Black Brant 8 Microcalorimeter (XQC-2) at the turn of the century is a part of the joint undertaking by the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] and [[NASA]]'s [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] known as the X-ray Quantum Calorimeter (XQC) project.]]
In astronomy, the [[interstellar medium]] (or '''ISM''') is the gas and [[cosmic dust]] that pervade interstellar space: the [[matter]] that exists between the [[star system]]s within a galaxy. It fills interstellar space and blends smoothly into the surrounding [[intergalactic medium]]. The interstellar medium consists of an extremely dilute (by terrestrial standards) mixture of [[ion]]s, [[atom]]s, [[molecule]]s, larger dust grains, [[cosmic ray]]s, and (galactic) magnetic fields.&lt;ref name=Spitzer&gt;{{Cite book|author=Spitzer L |date=1978 |title=Physical Processes in the Interstellar Medium |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-471-29335-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy that occupies the same volume, in the form of [[electromagnetic radiation]], is the '''interstellar radiation field'''.

Of interest is the hot ionized medium (HIM) consisting of a [[coronal cloud]] ejection from star surfaces at 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; K which emits X-rays. The ISM is [[turbulence|turbulent]] and full of structure on all spatial scales. [[Star formation|Stars are born]] deep inside large complexes of [[molecular clouds]], typically a few [[parsec]]s in size. During their lives and deaths, [[star]]s interact physically with the ISM. [[Stellar wind]]s from young clusters of stars (often with giant or supergiant [[HII region]]s surrounding them) and [[shock wave]]s created by [[supernova]]e inject enormous amounts of energy into their surroundings, which leads to hypersonic turbulence. The resultant structures are [[stellar wind bubble]]s and [[superbubble]]s of hot gas. The Sun is currently traveling through the [[Local Interstellar Cloud]], a denser region in the low-density [[Local Bubble]].

To measure the spectrum of the diffuse X-ray emission from the interstellar medium over the energy range 0.07 to 1 keV, [[NASA]] launched a [[Black Brant (rocket)|Black Brant 9]] from White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico on May 1, 2008.&lt;ref name=McCammon&gt;{{cite web|author=Wright B |title=36.223 UH MCCAMMON/UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN |url=http://sites.wff.nasa.gov/code810/news/story83.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511111524/http://sites.wff.nasa.gov/code810/news/story83.html |archivedate=May 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Principal Investigator for the mission is Dr. Dan McCammon of the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]].

==Balloons==
{{main|Balloons for X-ray astronomy}}
Balloon flights can carry instruments to altitudes of up to 40&amp;nbsp;km above sea level, where they are above as much as 99.997% of the Earth's atmosphere. Unlike a rocket where data are collected during a brief few minutes, balloons are able to stay aloft for much longer. However, even at such altitudes, much of the X-ray [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] is still absorbed. X-rays with energies less than 35 keV (5,600 aJ) cannot reach balloons. On July 21, 1964, the [[Crab Nebula]] supernova remnant was discovered to be a hard X-ray (15–60 keV) source by a scintillation counter flown on a balloon launched from [[Palestine, Texas]], United States. This was likely the first balloon-based detection of X-rays from a discrete cosmic X-ray source.&lt;ref name=headates1&gt;{{cite web|author=Drake SA |title=A Brief History of High-Energy Astronomy: 1960–1964 |url=http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/headates/1960.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High-energy focusing telescope===
[[File:800crab.png|thumb|The [[Crab Nebula]] is a remnant of an exploded star. This image shows the Crab Nebula in various energy bands, including a hard X-ray image from the HEFT data taken during its 2005 observation run. Each image is 6′ wide.]]
The high-energy focusing telescope (HEFT) is a balloon-borne experiment to image astrophysical sources in the hard X-ray (20–100 keV) band.&lt;ref name=Harrison&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Harrison FA|title=Development of the High-Energy Focusing Telescope (HEFT) balloon experiment|date=2000 |journal=Proc SPIE|volume=4012 |page=693 |doi=10.1117/12.391608|series=X-Ray Optics, Instruments, and Missions III|editor1-last=Truemper|editor1-first=Joachim E|last2=Boggs|first2=Steven E.|last3=Bolotnikov|first3=Aleksey E.|last4=Christensen|first4=Finn E.|last5=Cook Iii|first5=Walter R.|last6=Craig|first6=William W.|last7=Hailey|first7=Charles J.|last8=Jimenez-Garate|first8=Mario A.|last9=Mao|first9=Peter H.|bibcode=2000SPIE.4012..693H|display-authors=8|editor2-last=Aschenbach|editor2-first=Bernd|url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/84233/1/693.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its maiden flight took place in May 2005 from Fort Sumner, New Mexico, USA. The angular resolution of HEFT is c. 1.5'. Rather than using a grazing-angle [[X-ray telescope]], HEFT makes use of a novel [[tungsten]]-silicon multilayer coatings to extend the reflectivity of nested grazing-incidence mirrors beyond 10 keV. HEFT has an energy resolution of 1.0 keV [[full width at half maximum]] at 60 keV. HEFT was launched for a 25-hour balloon flight in May 2005.

==Rockoons==
{{main|Rockoon}}
[[File:Deacon Rockoon.jpg|thumb|Navy Deacon rockoon photographed just after a shipboard launch in July 1956.]]
The [[rockoon]], a blend of ''rocket'' and ''balloon'', was a [[solid fuel rocket]] that, rather than being immediately lit while on the ground, was first carried into the upper atmosphere by a gas-filled balloon. Then, once separated from the balloon at its maximum height, the rocket was automatically ignited. This achieved a higher altitude, since the rocket did not have to move through the lower thicker air layers that would have required much more chemical fuel.

The original concept of &quot;rockoons&quot; was developed by Cmdr. Lee Lewis, Cmdr. G. Halvorson, S. F. Singer, and [[James A. Van Allen]] during the Aerobee rocket firing cruise of the {{USS|Norton Sound|AVM-1|6}} on March 1, 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;rockooni&quot;/&gt;

From July 17 to July 27, 1956, the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] (NRL) shipboard launched eight [[Deacon (rocket)|Deacon]] rockoons for solar [[ultraviolet]] and X-ray observations at ~30° N ~121.6° W, southwest of [[San Clemente Island]], apogee: 120&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=nrl10&gt;{{cite web |title=Chronology – Quarter 3 1956 |url=http://www.astronautix.com/chrono/19563.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==X-ray astronomy satellite==
{{main| X-ray astronomy satellite}}
X-ray astronomy satellites study X-ray emissions from celestial objects. Satellites, which can detect and transmit data about the X-ray emissions are deployed as part of branch of space science known as X-ray astronomy. Satellites are needed because X-radiation is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, so instruments to detect X-rays must be taken to high altitude by balloons, sounding rockets, and satellites.

==X-ray telescopes and mirrors==

{{main|X-ray telescope}}
[[File:Xrtlayout.gif|thumb|The [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission]] contains a grazing incidence Wolter I telescope (XRT) to focus X-rays onto a state-of-the-art CCD.]]
X-ray telescopes (XRTs) have varying directionality or imaging ability based on glancing angle reflection rather than refraction or large deviation reflection.&lt;ref name=swift&gt;{{cite web |title=SWIFT X-ray mirrors |url=http://swift.sonoma.edu/about_swift/instruments/xrt.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chandra&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chandra.harvard.edu/about/telescope_system.html |title=Chandra X-ray focusing mirrors}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This limits them to much narrower fields of view than visible or UV telescopes. The mirrors can be made of ceramic or metal foil.&lt;ref name=xrayoptics&gt;{{cite web |url=http://astrophysics.gsfc.nasa.gov/xrays/MirrorLab/xoptics.html |title=X-ray optics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first X-ray telescope in astronomy was used to observe the Sun. The first X-ray picture (taken with a grazing incidence telescope) of the Sun was taken in 1963, by a rocket-borne telescope. On April 19, 1960 the very first X-ray image of the sun was taken using a pinhole camera on an Aerobee-Hi rocket.&lt;ref name=Blake&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blake|first=R. L.|author2=Chubb, T. A. |author3=Friedman, H. |author4=Unzicker, A. E. |title=Interpretation of X-Ray Photograph of the Sun|journal=Astrophysical Journal|date=January 1963|volume=137|page=3|doi=10.1086/147479|bibcode = 1963ApJ...137....3B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The utilization of X-ray mirrors for extrasolar X-ray astronomy simultaneously requires:
* the ability to determine the location at the arrival of an X-ray photon in two dimensions and
* a reasonable detection efficiency.

==X-ray astronomy detectors==
{{main|X-ray astronomy detectors}}
[[File:Proportional Counter Array RXTE.jpg|thumb|right|Proportional Counter Array on the [[Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer]] (RXTE) satellite.]]
X-ray astronomy detectors have been designed and configured primarily for energy and occasionally for wavelength detection using a variety of techniques usually limited to the technology of the time.

X-ray detectors collect individual X-rays (photons of X-ray electromagnetic radiation) and count the number of photons collected (intensity), the energy (0.12 to 120 keV) of the photons collected, wavelength (c. 0.008–8&amp;nbsp;nm), or how fast the photons are detected (counts per hour), to tell us about the object that is emitting them.

==Astrophysical sources of X-rays==

Several types of astrophysical objects emit, fluoresce, or reflect X-rays, from [[galaxy cluster]]s, through black holes in [[active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] (AGN) to galactic objects such as [[supernova remnant]]s, stars, and [[binary star]]s containing a [[white dwarf]] ([[cataclysmic variable star]]s and [[super soft X-ray source]]s), neutron star or black hole ([[X-ray binaries]]). Some [[solar system]] bodies emit X-rays, the most notable being the [[Moon]], although most of the X-ray brightness of the Moon arises from reflected solar X-rays. A combination of many unresolved X-ray sources is thought to produce the observed [[X-ray background]]. The X-ray continuum can arise from [[bremsstrahlung]], [[Thermal radiation|black-body radiation]], [[synchrotron radiation]], or what is called [[Compton scattering#Inverse Compton scattering|inverse Compton scattering]] of lower-energy photons by relativistic electrons, knock-on collisions of fast protons with atomic electrons, and atomic recombination, with or without additional electron transitions.&lt;ref name=Morrison&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Morrison P |title=Extrasolar X-ray Sources |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics|date=1967 |volume=5 |issue=1 |page=325 |doi=10.1146/annurev.aa.05.090167.001545 |bibcode=1967ARA&amp;A...5..325M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[intermediate-mass X-ray binary]] (IMXB) is a binary star system where one of the components is a neutron star or a black hole. The other component is an intermediate mass star.&lt;ref name=Podsiadlowski&gt;{{cite journal |author=Podsiadlowski P |author2=Rappaport S |author3=Pfahl E |title=Evolutionary Binary Sequences for Low- and Intermediate-Mass X-ray Binaries |date=2001 |doi=10.1086/324686 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=565 |issue=2 |pages=1107 |arxiv=astro-ph/0107261|bibcode = 2002ApJ...565.1107P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hercules X-1]] is composed of a neutron star accreting matter from a normal star (HZ Herculis) probably due to Roche lobe overflow. X-1 is the prototype for the massive X-ray binaries although it falls on the borderline, {{Solar mass|~2|link=y}}, between high- and low-mass X-ray binaries.&lt;ref name=Priedhorsky&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Priedhorsky WC|author2= Holt SS |title=Long-term cycles in cosmic X-ray sources |journal=Space Science Reviews|volume=45|date=1987|issue=3–4 |page=291|doi=10.1007/BF00171997 |bibcode=1987SSRv...45..291P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2020, astronomers reported the observation of a &quot;[[Tidal disruption event|hard tidal disruption event candidate]]&quot; associated with ASASSN-20hx, located near the nucleus of galaxy NGC 6297, and noted that the observation represented one of the &quot;very few tidal disruption events with [[X-ray#Soft and hard X-rays|hard powerlaw X-ray spectra]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AT-20200725&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Lin |first=Dacheng |title=ATel #13895: ASASSN-20hx is a Hard Tidal Disruption Event Candidate |url=http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=13895 |date=25 July 2020 |work=[[The Astronomer's Telegram]] |accessdate=25 July 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AT-20200724&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=Hinkle, J.T. |display-authors=et al. |title=Atel #13893: Classification of ASASSN-20hx as a Tidal Disruption Event Candidate |url=http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=13893 |date=24 July 2020 |work=[[The Astronomer's Telegram]] |accessdate=24 July 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celestial X-ray sources==
{{main|Astrophysical X-ray source}}
The [[celestial sphere]] has been divided into 88 constellations. The [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) constellations are areas of the sky. Each of these contains remarkable X-ray sources. Some of them have been identified from astrophysical modeling to be [[galaxies]] or black holes at the centers of galaxies. Some are [[pulsar]]s. As with sources already successfully modeled by X-ray astrophysics, striving to understand the generation of X-rays by the apparent source helps to understand the Sun, the [[universe]] as a whole, and how these affect us on [[Earth]]. Constellations are an astronomical device for handling observation and precision independent of current physical theory or interpretation. Astronomy has been around for a long time. Physical theory changes with time. With respect to celestial X-ray sources, X-ray astrophysics tends to focus on the physical reason for X-ray brightness, whereas X-ray astronomy tends to focus on their classification, order of discovery, variability, resolvability, and their relationship with nearby sources in other constellations.

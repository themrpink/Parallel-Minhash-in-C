The bishop's predecessor in medieval chess, [[shatranj]] (originally [[chaturanga]]), was the [[alfil]], meaning &quot;[[elephant]]&quot;, which could leap two squares along any diagonal, and could jump over an intervening piece. As a consequence, each fil was restricted to eight squares, and no fil could attack another. The modern bishop first appeared shortly after 1200 in [[Courier chess]].&lt;ref&gt;Murray 1913, p. 483&lt;/ref&gt; A piece with this move, called a {{lang|es|cocatriz}} or crocodile, is part of the Grande Acedrex in the {{lang|es|[[Libro de los juegos]]}} compiled in 1283 for King [[Alfonso X of Castile]]. The game is attributed to &quot;India&quot;, then a very vague term.&lt;ref&gt;Murray 1913, p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; About half a century later Muḥammad ibn Maḥmud al-Āmulī, in his ''Treasury of the Sciences'', describes an expanded form of chess with two pieces moving &quot;like the rook but obliquely&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Murray 1913, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; The bishop was also independently invented in Japan at about the same time (the 13th&amp;nbsp;century), where it formed part of [[sho shogi]] and [[dai shogi]]; it remains present in modern [[shogi]] as the direct descendant of sho shogi.

Derivatives of ''alfil'' survive in the languages of the two countries where chess was first introduced within Western Europe—Italian ({{lang|it|alfiere}}) and Spanish ({{lang|es|alfil}}).&lt;ref&gt;The Spanish {{lang|es|alfil}} is simply a loanword of the Persian term, without any other meaning; while the Italian form became {{lang|it|alfiere}}—an already existing Germanic- or Arabian-derived word for &quot;standard-bearer&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; It was known as the {{lang|fr|aufin}} in French,&lt;ref&gt;Yalom, Marilyn. ''Birth of the Chess Queen''. New York: Perennial, 2004. p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; or the aufin, alphin, or archer in early English.&lt;ref name=&quot;etymonline&quot;&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bishop Piececlopedia: Bishop] from Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest references to bishops on the chessboard are two 13th-century Latin texts, {{lang|la|De Vetula}} and {{lang|la|Quaedam moralitas de scaccario}}.&lt;ref&gt;Archaeologia, Or, Miscellaneous Tracts Relating to Antiquity, Volume 11 [https://books.google.no/books?id=5bdJAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA404&amp;lpg=PA404&amp;dq=vetula+episcopus+pmoem&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MFXZhyE7r6&amp;sig=CVT70eCsqYLOf2jJfmC-Ud4Tfkg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vhMWTrzdL4GM-wbZg4Qy&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vetula%20episcopus%20poem&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murray, H. J. R. (1913). A History of Chess, Oxford University Press. p.507[https://archive.org/details/AHistoryOfChess/page/n533], p.521[https://archive.org/details/AHistoryOfChess/page/n545] p.530-533[https://archive.org/details/AHistoryOfChess/page/n553].&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;bishop&quot; first entered the English language in the 16th century, with the first known written example dating back to 1560s.&lt;ref name=&quot;etymonline&quot;/&gt; In all other Germanic languages, except for [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], it is called various names, all of which directly translate to English as &quot;runner&quot; or &quot;messenger&quot;. In Icelandic, however, it is called &quot;{{lang|is|biskup}}&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvariants.org/piececlopedia.dir/bishop.html Piececlopedia: Bishop] from chessvariants.org&lt;/ref&gt; with the same meaning as in English. The use of the term in Icelandic predates that of the English language, as the first mentioning of &quot;{{lang|is|biskup}}&quot; in Icelandic texts dates back to the early part of the 14th&amp;nbsp;century, while the 12th-century [[Lewis Chessmen]] portray the bishop as an unambiguously ecclesiastical figure. In the ''Saga of Earl Mágus'', which was written in Iceland somewhere between 1300–1325, it is described how an emperor was checkmated by a bishop. This has led to some speculations as to the origin of the English use of the term &quot;bishop&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/09/arts/09lewis.html Reopening History of Storied Norse Chessmen] from nytimes.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fiske 1905&lt;/ref&gt;

The canonical chessmen date back to the [[Staunton chess set]] of 1849. The piece's deep groove symbolizes a bishop's (or abbot's) [[mitre]]. Some have written that the groove originated from the original form of the piece, an [[elephant]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Oxford Companion to Chess]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Everything Chess Basic Book'', by the [[US Chess Federation]] and Peter Kurzdorfer, 2003, pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; with the groove representing the elephant's [[Elephant tusk|tusks]].&lt;ref&gt;Golombek, 1976, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; The English apparently chose to call the piece a bishop because the projections at the top resembled a mitre.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt; This groove was interpreted differently in different countries as the game moved to Europe; in France, for example, the groove was taken to be a [[jester]]'s cap, hence in France the bishop is called &quot;{{lang|fr|fou}}&quot;, the &quot;jester&quot;&lt;ref&gt;the word can also mean madman or gannet&lt;/ref&gt; and in Romania the {{lang|ro|nebun}} (madman).&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

In some Slavic languages (e.g. Czech/Slovak) the bishop is called ''střelec/strelec'', which directly translates to English as a &quot;shooter&quot; meaning an [[Archery|archer]], while in others it is still known as &quot;elephant&quot; (e.g. Russian {{transl|ru|slon}}). In [[South Slavic languages]] it is usually known as ''lovac'', meaning &quot;hunter&quot;, or ''laufer'', taken from the German name for the same piece (''laufer'' is also a co-official Polish name for the piece alongside ''goniec''). An alternative name for bishop in Russian is ''officer'' ({{lang-ru|офицер}}); it is also called {{lang|el|αξιωματικός}} ({{transl|el|axiomatikos}}) in Greek, {{lang|be|афіцэр}} ({{transl|be|afitser}}) in Belarusian and ''oficeri'' in Albanian.

In [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] and several Indian languages it is called the ''[[Camel cavalry|camel]]''.

In Lithuanian it is the ''{{lang|lt|rikis}}'', a kind of military commander in [[medieval Lithuania]].

[[Image:JaquesCookStaunton.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|&lt;center&gt;Original [[Staunton chess set|Staunton chess pieces]] &lt;br /&gt;''Left to right:'' pawn, rook, knight, bishop, queen, king&lt;/center&gt;]]
A '''chess piece''', or '''chessman''', is any of the six different types of movable objects used on a [[chessboard]] to play the game of [[chess]].

==Number of pieces==
{{table chess pieces}}
Each player begins with a total of sixteen pieces.  The pieces that belong to each player are [[White and Black in chess|distinguished by color]].  The lighter colored pieces are referred to as &quot;white,&quot; and the player that owns them, &quot;White&quot;. The darker colored pieces are referred to as &quot;black&quot;, and the player that owns them, &quot;Black&quot;.  The word &quot;piece&quot; has three meanings, depending on the context. Context should make the intended meaning clear {{harvcol|Burgess|2009|p=523}} {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992|p=307}}.
# It may mean any of the physical pieces of the set, including the pawns. When used this way, &quot;piece&quot; is synonymous with &quot;chessman&quot; {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992|p=307}} or simply &quot;man&quot; {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1987|p=200}}. [[Chess set]]s have been made in a variety of styles, sometimes for decorative or artistic purposes rather than practical play, but the [[Staunton chess set|Staunton pattern]] is standard for competition.
# In play, the term is usually used to exclude pawns, referring only to a queen, rook, bishop, knight, or king. In this context, the pieces can be broken down into three groups: {{chessgloss|major pieces}} (queen and rook), {{chessgloss|minor pieces}} (bishop and knight), and the king {{harvcol|Brace|1977|p=220}}.
# In phrases such as &quot;winning a piece&quot;, &quot;losing a piece&quot; or &quot;sacrificing a piece&quot; and other related contexts, it refers only to minor pieces (bishops or knights). The queen, rook, and pawn are specified by name in these cases—for example, &quot;winning a queen&quot;, &quot;losing a rook&quot;, or &quot;sacrificing a pawn&quot; {{harvcol|Just|Burg|2003|p=5}}.

In the first context, each of the two players begins with the following sixteen pieces in a standard game:
* 1 [[King (chess)|king]]
* 1 [[Queen (chess)|queen]]
* 2 [[Rook (chess)|rooks]]
* 2 [[Bishop (chess)|bishops]]
* 2 [[Knight (chess)|knights]]
* 8 [[Pawn (chess)|pawns]]

|Chess starting position. Squares are referenced using [[algebraic notation (chess)|algebraic notation]].}}

The [[rules of chess]] prescribe the types of move a player can make with each type of chess piece.  Each piece type moves in a different way.  During play, the players take turns moving one of their own chess pieces.
* The '''rook''' moves any number of vacant squares forwards, backwards, left, or right in a straight line. It also takes part, along with the king, in a special move called [[castling]].
* The '''bishop''' moves any number of vacant squares diagonally in a straight line. Consequently, a bishop stays on squares of the same color throughout a game. The two bishops each player starts with move on squares of opposite colors.
* The '''queen''' moves any number of vacant squares in any direction: forwards, backwards, left, right, or diagonally, in a straight line.
* The '''king''' moves exactly one vacant square in any direction: forwards, backwards, left, right, or diagonally; however, it cannot move to a square that is under attack by an opponent, nor can a player make a move with another piece if it will leave the king in check. It also has a special move called castling, in which the king moves two squares towards one of its own rooks and in the same move, the rook jumps over the king to land on the square on the king's other side.  Castling may only be performed if the king and rook involved have never previously been moved in the game, if the king is not in check, if the king would not travel through or into check, and if there are no pieces between the rook and the king.
* The '''knight''' moves on an extended diagonal from one corner of any 2×3 rectangle of squares to the furthest opposite corner. Consequently, the knight alternates its square color each time it moves. Other than the castling move described above where the rook jumps over the king, the knight is the only piece permitted to routinely jump over any intervening piece(s) when moving.
* The '''pawn''' moves forward exactly one square, or optionally, two squares when on its starting square, toward the opponent's side of the board. When there is an enemy piece one square diagonally ahead of a pawn, either left or right, then the pawn may capture that piece. A pawn can perform a special type of capture of an enemy pawn called ''[[en passant]]''. If the pawn reaches a square on the {{chessgloss|back rank}} of the opponent, it [[Promotion (chess)|promotes]] to the player's choice of a queen, rook, bishop, or knight {{harvcol|Just|Burg|2003|pp=13–16}}.

Pieces other than pawns capture in the same way that they move, except for castling. A capturing piece replaces the opponent piece on its square, except for an ''en passant'' capture. Captured pieces are immediately removed from the game. A square may hold only one piece at any given time. Except for castling and the knight's move, no piece may jump over another piece {{harvcol|Just|Burg|2003|pp=13–16}}.

==Relative value==
{{Main|Chess piece relative value}}
The value assigned to a piece attempts to represent the potential strength of the piece in the game. As the game develops, the relative values of the pieces will also change. A bishop [[Chess strategy#Positioning|positioned]] to control long, open diagonal spaces is usually more valuable than a knight stuck in a corner. Similar ideas apply to placing rooks on [[open file]]s and knights on active, {{chessgloss|center|central squares}}. The standard valuation is one point for a pawn, three points for a knight or bishop, five points for a rook, and nine points for a queen {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992|pp=438–39}}. These values are reliable in endgames, particularly with a limited number of pieces. But these values can change dramatically depending on the position, the phase of the game (opening, middle game, endings). A {{chessgloss|bishop pair}} for example, is worth a half a pawn on average {{harvcol|Soltis|2004|p=183}}. In specific circumstances, the values may be quite different: a knight can be more valuable than a queen in a particular decisive attack.

==Historical illustration==
[[Courier Chess]], a predecessor of modern chess, used all six chess piece types plus a courier, [[Mann (chess)|man]] (or rath or sage), and jester.
[[File:Illustration of Chess Pieces by Gustav Selenus (1616).jpg|thumb|upright=2.2|left|Illustration of chess pieces used in Courier chess by Gustav Selenus from the book &quot;Das Schach-Oder Königs-Spiel&quot; (1616). Depicted are the king, queen, rook, archer (or bishop), knight, pawn (or soldier), courier, [[Mann (chess)|man]] (or rath or sage), and jester.]]
{{clear left}}

==Piece names==
{{wiktionary|Appendix:Chess pieces}}
The characters implied by pieces' names vary between languages. For example, in many languages, the piece known in English as the &quot;knight&quot; frequently translates as &quot;horse&quot;, and the English &quot;bishop&quot; frequently translates as &quot;elephant&quot;.{{chess names}}

The '''knight''' (♘,♞) is a [[Chess piece|piece]] in the game of [[chess]] and is represented by a [[horse]]'s head and neck. Each player starts with two knights, which are located between the [[Rook (chess)|rooks]] and [[Bishop (chess)|bishops]] in the standard starting position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Are the Rules of Chess? - A Step-By-Step Guide to Learning the Chess Rules |url=https://www.ichess.net/blog/rules-of-chess/ |website=iChess.net |accessdate=12 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The knight, along with the [[king (chess)|king]] and the [[rook (chess)|rook]], has the oldest defined movement of any chess piece, its movement being unchanged since the invention of [[chaturanga]] in India around the 6th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvariants.com/piececlopedia.dir/knight.html Piecelopedia - Knight], chessvariants.com&lt;/ref&gt; Similar pieces are found in almost all games of the chess family. The ''ma'' of [[xiangqi]] and [[janggi]] are slightly more restricted; conceptually, the piece is considered to pass through the adjacent orthogonal square, which must be unoccupied, rather than &quot;jumping&quot;. Another related piece is the ''keima'' of [[shogi]], which moves like a knight but may only move two squares forward followed by one square sideways, restricting its movement to two possible squares.

===Names===
The knight is colloquially sometimes referred to as a &quot;horse&quot;, which is also the translation of the piece's name in several languages. Some languages refer to it as the &quot;jumper&quot;, reflecting the knight's ability to move over pieces in its path: Polish ''skoczek'', Danish/Norwegian ''springer'', Swedish ''springare'', German ''Springer'', Luxembourgish ''Sprénger'', Slovene ''skakač''. In [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] it is called ''sceccu'', a slang term for a [[donkey]], derived from the Arabic ''[[sheikh]]'', who during the [[Emirate of Sicily#Sicily under Islamic rule|Islamic period]] rode from village to village on donkeys collecting taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Did you know? Sceccu|first=Sebastian|last=Agricola|url=http://tsaa.net.au/uploads/3/4/1/3/34139585/edition_13_summer13-14.pdf|magazine=The Sicilian Association of Australia Newsletter|date=Summer 2013-14|issue=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movement==
Compared to other chess pieces, the knight's movement is unique: it may move two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically (with both forming the shape of an ''L''). While moving, the knight can jump over pieces to reach its destination.&lt;ref&gt;Because of this, the move can also be described in other ways, such as one square diagonally and one square orthogonally &quot;outward&quot; (not ending adjacent to its starting square), or one square orthogonally followed by one square diagonally outward. The latter describes the move of the horse in [[xiangqi]], which cannot jump.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [https://www.fide.com/fide/handbook.html?id=208&amp;view=article FIDE Laws of Chess] use a different but equivalent definition where the knight moves to one of the eight nearest squares that are not on its starting rank, file, or diagonal.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Knight in Chess |url=https://www.masterclass.com/articles/what-is-the-knight-in-chess |website=MasterClass |accessdate=13 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knights capture in the same way, replacing the enemy piece on the square and removing it from the board. Knights and [[Pawn (chess)|pawns]] are the only pieces that can be moved in the initial position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Knight in Chess |url=https://www.masterclass.com/articles/what-is-the-knight-in-chess |website=MasterClass |accessdate=13 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Value==
{{Further|Chess piece relative value}}
Knights and bishops, also known as {{chessgloss|minor pieces}}, are considered approximately equal in value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lawrence |first1=Al |title=Chess and the Art of War |date=2016 |publisher=Chartwell Books |location=New York, USA |isbn=978-0-7858-3281-2 |page=16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bishops utilize a longer range, but can only move to squares of one color.

|A knight occupying a {{chessgloss|hole}} (d5) in the enemy pawn structure
|}}
Enemy pawns are very effective at harassing knights because a pawn attacking a knight is not itself attacked by the knight. For this reason, a knight is most effective when placed in a weakness in the opponent's [[pawn structure]], i.e. a square which cannot be attacked by enemy pawns. In the diagram, White's knight on d5 is very powerful&amp;nbsp;– more powerful than Black's bishop on g7.

Whereas two bishops cover each other's weaknesses, two knights tend not to cooperate with each other as efficiently. As such, a pair of bishops is usually considered better than a pair of knights {{harvcol|Flear|2007|p=135}}. [[World Chess Championship|World Champion]] [[José Raúl Capablanca]] considered that a queen and a knight is usually a better combination than a queen and a bishop. However, [[Glenn Flear]] found no game of Capablanca's that supported his statement; statistics do not support the statement, either {{harvcol|Flear|2007|p=135}}. In an [[endgame (chess)|endgame]] without other pieces or pawns, two knights generally have a better chance against a queen than two bishops or a bishop and a knight (see [[Fortress (chess)]]).

}}
Compared to a bishop, a knight is often not as good in an endgame. A knight can only exert control over one part of the board at a time and often takes multiple moves to reposition to a new location, which often makes it less suitable in endgames with pawns on both sides of the board. This limitation is less important, however, in endgames with pawns on only one side of the board. Knights are superior to bishops in an endgame if all the pawns are on one side of the board. Furthermore, knights have the advantage of being able to control squares of either color, unlike a lone bishop. Nonetheless, a disadvantage of the knight (compared to the other pieces) is that by itself it cannot lose a move to put the opponent in [[zugzwang]] (see [[Triangulation (chess)|triangulation]] and [[Tempo (chess)|tempo]]), while a bishop can. In this position, if the knight is on a white square and it is White's turn to move, White cannot win. Similarly, if the knight were on a black square and it were Black's turn to move, White cannot win. In the other two cases, White would win. If instead of the knight, White had a bishop on either color of square, White would win with either side to move {{harvcol|Mednis|1993|pp=7–8}}.

|Knight trapped by an enemy bishop; knight trapped by a king
|}}
In an [[Chess endgame|endgame]] where one side has only a king and a knight while the other side has only a king, the game is a [[Draw (chess)|draw]] since a [[checkmate]] is impossible. When a bare king faces a king and two knights, a checkmate can never be forced; checkmate can occur only if the opponent commits a blunder by moving their king to a square where it can be checkmated on the next move. Checkmate can be forced with a bishop and knight, however, or with two bishops, even though the bishop and knight are in general about equal in value. Paradoxically, checkmate with two knights sometimes ''can'' be forced if the weaker side has a single extra pawn, but this is a curiosity of little practical value (see [[two knights endgame]]). [[pawnless chess endgame|Pawnless endings]] are a rarity, and if the stronger side has even a single pawn, an extra knight should give them an easy win. A bishop can trap (although it cannot then capture) a knight on the rim (see diagram), especially in the endgame.

===Stamma's mate===

In a few rare endgame positions where the opposing king is trapped in a corner in front of its own pawn, it is possible to force mate with only a king and knight in a pattern known as [[Philipp Stamma|Stamma]]'s mate, which has occasionally been seen in practice. In the position below, from [[Jesus Nogueiras|Nogueiras]]–Gongora, Cuban championship 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jesus Nogueiras vs. Maikel Gongora Reyes, ch-CUB (2001) |url=https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1218922 |website=[[Chessgames.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Black played 75...Nxf6??, incorrectly assuming that the ending would be drawn following the capture of the last white pawn on a2. (Correct was 75...Ne3! 76.Kg6 Ng4 77.Kg7 and now 77...Nxf6! may be safely played, the king being sufficiently distant). Play continued 76.Nxf6 Ke5 77.Nd7+ Kd4 78.Kf4 Kc3 79.Ke3 Kb2 80.Kd2 Kxa2 81.Kc2 Ka1 82.Nc5 Ka2 83.Nd3 Ka1 84.Nc1 and Black resigned, as 84...a2 85.Nb3 is mate.

With a grateful heart, the Church of Christ acknowledges that, according to God's saving design, the beginnings of her faith and her election were already among the patriarchs, Moses, and the prophets. She professes that all who believe in Christ—Abraham's sons according to faith—were included in the same patriarch's call, likewise that her salvation is mystically foreshadowed by the chosen people's exodus from the land of bondage.

The Church, therefore, cannot forget that she received the revelation of the Old Testament from the people with whom God in His ineffable mercy concluded the Ancient Covenant. Nor can she forget that she feeds upon the root of that cultivated olive tree into which the wild shoots of the Gentiles have been grafted (cf. Rom. 11, 17–24). Indeed, the Church believes that by His cross Christ our Peace reconciled the Jews and Gentiles, making both one (cf. Eph. 2, 14, 16).

The Church keeps ever in mind the words of the Apostle about his kinsmen: &quot;Theirs is the sonship, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises. Theirs are the patriarchs, and of them is the Christ according to the flesh,&quot; the Son of Mary the Virgin (Rom. 9, 4–5). No less does she recall that the Apostles, the Church's foundation stones and pillars, as well as most of the early disciples who proclaimed Christ's Gospel to the world, sprang from the Jewish people.

Even though a large part of the Jews did not accept the Gospel, they remain most dear to God, according to the Apostle, for the sake of the patriarchs, since Gods gifts and call are irrevocable (cf. Rom. 11, 28 f.). In company with the prophets and the same Apostle, the Church awaits that day, known to God alone, on which all peoples will address the Lord in a single voice and &quot;serve Him shoulder to shoulder&quot; (Soph. 3, 9; cf. Is. 66, 3, 9; cf. Is. 66, 23; Ps. 65, 4; Rom. 11, 11–32).

Since the spiritual patrimony common to Christians and Jews is of such magnitude, this Sacred Synod wants to foster and recommend that mutual knowledge and respect that are, above all, the fruit of biblical and theological studies as well as of fraternal dialogues. Moreover, this Synod, in her rejection of injustices of whatever kind and wherever inflicted upon people, and recalling our common patrimony, deplores and condemns hatred and persecutions of Jews, whether they arose in former or in our own days.

May all, then, see to it that in their catechetical work or in their preaching of the word of God they do not teach anything that could give rise to hatred or contempt of Jews in the hearts of Christians. May they never present the Jewish people as one rejected, cursed, or guilty of deicide. All that happened to Christ in His passion cannot be attributed to the whole people then alive, much less to that of today. Besides, the Church has always held and holds now that Christ underwent His passion and death freely, because of the sins of all people and out of infinite love. Therefore, Christian preaching is to proclaim the Cross of Christ as a sign of God's all-embracing love and as the fountain from which every grace flows.}}

== ''Nostra aetate'' ==
The document begins by stating:&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

{{Quote|text=In our time, when day by day mankind is being drawn closer together, and the ties between different peoples are becoming stronger, the Church examines more closely her relationship to non-Christian religions. In her task of promoting unity and love among men, indeed among nations, she considers above all in this declaration what men have in common and what draws them to fellowship.|sign=|source=}}

The key observation about other faiths reads: &quot;The Catholic Church rejects nothing that is true and holy in these religions. She regards with sincere reverence those ways of conduct and of life, those precepts and teachings, which though different in many aspects from the ones she holds and sets forth, nonetheless often reflect a ray of truth which enlightens all men.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

''Nostra aetate'' examined, among other belief systems, Hinduism and Buddhism, and stated that the Church &quot;rejects nothing that is true and holy&quot; in other religions.&lt;ref&gt;Clooney, Francis X. &quot;Nostra Aetate and the Catholic Way of Openness to Other Religions.&quot; ''Nostra Aetate'', edited by Pim Valkenberg and Anthony Cirelli, Catholic University of America Press, Washington, D.C., 2016, pp. 58–75. ''JSTOR'', www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1g69zbs.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

As regards to the Jewish people, the declaration contradicted the common teaching of the time that the Jews were guilty of deicide for the death of Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/nostra-aetate-proves-change-possible|title=Nostra Aetate proves that change is possible|last=Fiedler|first=Maureen}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ruled out anti-Semitism for Christians and [[dual-covenant theology|called God's covenant with the Hebrew people eternal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/11/01/453448972/nostra-aetate-opened-up-catholic-jewish-relations-50-years-ago|title='Nostra Aetate' Opened Up Catholic, Jewish Relations 50 Years Ago|last=Poggioli|first=Sylvia|date=1 November 2015|website=National Public Radio|access-date=18 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious freedom became a new part of Catholic teaching with Vatican II and this declaration. ''Nostra aetate'' declared that there are positive elements in other religions and religious stereotypes and prejudices can be overcome through interreligious dialogue. Pope Francis said, &quot;From indifference and opposition, we've turned to cooperation and goodwill. From enemies and strangers, we've become friends and brothers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

The final paragraph calls on Catholics to enter into &quot;dialogue and collaboration&quot; with those of other faiths.&lt;ref&gt;Fredericks, James L. &quot;Nostra Aetate and Pope Francis: Reflections on the Next Fifty Years of Catholic Dialogue with Buddhists.&quot; ''Nostra Aetate'', edited by Pim Valkenberg and Anthony Cirelli, Catholic University of America Press, Washington, D.C., 2016, pp. 43–57. ''JSTOR'', www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1g69zbs.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

It describes the eternal questions which have dogged men since the beginning, and how the various religious traditions have tried to answer them.

It mentions some of the answers that some [[Hindus]], [[Buddhists]]{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}, and members of other faiths have suggested for such philosophical questions. It notes the willingness of the Catholic Church to accept some truths present in other religions in so much as they reflect Catholic teaching and may lead souls to Christ.

Part three goes on to say that the [[Catholic Church]] regards the Muslims with esteem, and then continues by describing some of the things [[Islam]] has in common with [[Christianity]] and Catholicism: worship of One God, the Creator of Heaven and Earth, Merciful and Omnipotent, Who has spoken to men; the [[Muslims]]' respect for [[Abraham]] and [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], and the great respect they have for [[Jesus]], whom they consider to be a Prophet and not God. The synod urged all [[Catholics]] and [[Muslims]] to forget the hostilities and differences of the past and to work together for mutual understanding and benefit.

Part four speaks of the bond that ties the people of the 'New Covenant' ([[Christians]]) to Abraham's stock ([[Jew]]s). It states that even though some Jewish authorities and those who followed them called for [[Jesus]]' death, the blame for this cannot be laid at the door of all those Jews present at that time, nor can the Jews in our time be held as guilty, thus repudiating an indiscriminate charge of [[Jewish deicide]]; 'the Jews should not be presented as rejected or accursed by God'. The Declaration also decries all displays of [[antisemitism]] made at any time by anyone.

{{quote|The Church keeps ever in mind the words of the Apostle about his kinsmen: &quot;theirs is the sonship and the glory and the covenants and the law and the worship and the promises; theirs are the fathers and from them is the Christ according to the flesh&quot; (Rom. 9:4–5), the Son of the Virgin Mary. She also recalls that the Apostles, the Church's main-stay and pillars, as well as most of the early disciples who proclaimed Christ's Gospel to the world, sprang from the Jewish people.

True, the Jewish authorities and those who followed their lead pressed for the death of Christ; still, what happened in His passion cannot be charged against all the Jews, without distinction, then alive, nor against the Jews of today. The Jews should not be presented as rejected or accursed by God, as if this followed from the Holy Scriptures. All should see to it, then, that in catechetical work or in the preaching of the word of God they do not teach anything that does not conform to the truth of the Gospel and the spirit of Christ. Furthermore, in her rejection of every persecution against any man, the Church, mindful of the patrimony she shares with the Jews and moved not by political reasons but by the Gospel's spiritual love, decries hatred, persecutions, displays of anti-Semitism, directed against Jews at any time and by anyone.}}

The fifth part states that all men are created in God's image, and that it is contrary to the mind of Christ to discriminate against, show hatred towards or harass any person or people on the basis of colour, race, religion, and condition of life.

== Post-Conciliar developments ==
''Nostra aetate'' was one of Vatican II's three declarations, the other documents consisting of nine decrees and four constitutions. It was the shortest of the documents and contained few, if any, references to the debates and the rationale that had gone into its making; therefore,  the changes to be brought about by the declaration on the Church's Relations with non-Christian Religions, ''Nostra aetate'', carried implications not fully appreciated at the time.

To flesh out these implications and ramifications, the Vatican's Commission on Interreligious Relations with the Jews issued its ''Guidelines and Suggestions for Implementing the Conciliar Declaration Nostra Aetate'' in late 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/relations-jews-docs/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_19741201_nostra-aetate_en.html|title=Guidelines and Suggestions for Implementing the Conciliar Declaration Nostra Aetate|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=2018-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was followed by that same body's ''Notes on the Correct Way to Present Jews and Judaism in the Teaching and Catechesis of the Roman Catholic Church'' in 1985. These developments were paralleled by accompanying statements from the U.S. bishops.

The above-referenced statements by the Vatican's [[Pontifical Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews|Commission for Interreligious Relations with the Jews]], as well as other developments, including the establishment of more than two dozen centers for Christian–Jewish understanding at Catholic institutions of higher learning in the United States along with the participation by rabbis in seminarian formation training, demonstrate how the church has embraced ''Nostra aetate''.

The significance of ''Nostra aetate'' as a new starting point  in the Church's relations with Judaism, in light of the foregoing, can be appreciated from the vantage point of the passage of forty years. The U.S. Congress passed a resolution acknowledging ''Nostra aetate'' at forty,&lt;ref&gt;US House Concurrent Resolution 260 {{USBill|109|HConRes|260|pipe=Recognizing the 40th anniversary of the Second Vatican Council's Declaration on the Relation of the Church to Non-Christian Religions, ''Nostra aetate'', and the continuing need for mutual interreligious respect and dialogue.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] in Washington D.C. also noted this anniversary. This is in addition to the marking of the occasion at the [[Holy See|Vatican]]'s [[Gregorian University]] itself and at major centers of Christian–Jewish understanding around the United States.

The Vatican's Commission for Religious Relations with Jews released a new document exploring the unresolved theological questions at the heart of Christian–Jewish dialogue. Entitled ''The Gifts and Calling of God are Irrevocable'', it marked the 50th anniversary of the ground-breaking declaration ''Nostra Aetate''.&lt;ref name=&quot;document&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Pontifical Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews|Vatican Commission for Religious Relations with Jews]] |date=10 December 2015 |title=''The Gifts and Calling of God are irrevocable''|location=Holy See|url=http://www.news.va/en/news/vatican-issues-new-document-on-christian-jewish-di|accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the fiftieth anniversary of the document, [[Sayyid Syeed]], national director of the [[Islamic Society of North America]]'s Office for Interfaith and Community Alliances, pointed out that ''Nostra Aetate'' came during the 1960s [[civil rights movement]] in the United States when Islamic centers and student groups were arising on university campuses, and from these humble beginnings the  &quot;Catholic church acted as a big brother&quot; in its understanding of a religious minority, a sentiment that has continued since the terrorist attacks of [[9/11]] when the Church opened its doors to them amidst growing Islamophobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ncronline.org/news/world/muslim-leader-praises-50-year-old-church-document-religious-dialogue|title=Muslim leader praises 50-year-old church document on religious dialogue|last=Zimmermann|first=Carol|date=21 May 2015|work=National Catholic Reporter|access-date=23 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phil Cunningham of [[Saint Joseph's University]] in Philadelphia has summed up the deeper impact of the decree: &quot;There's a tendency to think we've got it all figured out and we've got the fullness of truth. We have to remember God is bigger than our ability to conceive of God, and interreligious relations bring that out.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/services/englishnews/2015/in-50-years-since-nostra-aetate-church-has-built-strong-interreligious-ties.cfm|title=In 50 years since 'Nostra Aetate,' church has built strong interreligious ties|last=Sadowski|first=Dennis|date=13 October 2015|website=Catholic News Service|access-date=18 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gravissimum educationis''''' is the [[Second Vatican Council]]'s '''Declaration on Christian Education'''.  It was promulgated on 28 October 1965 by [[Pope Paul VI]], following approval by the assembled bishops by a vote of 2,290 to 35.

==Description==
The document is generally referred to, not by its English-language title, &quot;Declaration on Christian Education&quot;, but by the [[incipit|opening words]] of its original Latin text, which mean &quot;extremely important education&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651028_gravissimum-educationis_lt.html original Latin text]&lt;/ref&gt;

The document quotes at length from ''[[Divini illius Magistri]]'' (''That divine teacher'', 1929) by [[Pope Pius XI]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_31121929_divini-illius-magistri.html ''Divini illius magistri'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parents As Primary Educators==
&quot;Since parents have given children their life, they are bound by the most serious obligation to educate their offspring and therefore must be recognized as the primary and principal educators. This role in education is so important that only with difficulty can it be supplied where it is lacking. Parents are the ones who must create a family atmosphere animated by love and respect for God and man, in which the well-rounded personal and social education of children is fostered. Hence the family is the first school of the social virtues that every society needs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gravissimum educationis 3&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Gravissimum Educationis'' Foundation ==
On October 28, 2015, [[Pope Francis]] founded the ''Gravissimum Educationis'' Foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/letters/2015/documents/papa-francesco_20151028_chirografo-gravissimum-educationis.html|title=Chirograph of the Holy Father for the establishment of the “Gravissimum educationis” Foundation (28 October 2015) {{!}} Francis|website=w2.vatican.va|access-date=2019-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; intended to further scientific and cultural objectives aimed at promoting Catholic education in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fondazionege.org/en/chi-siamo/la-fondazione/|title=Statute - art. 3|website=Gravissimum Educationis Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation consists of:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=[6]|first=|date=|title=Statute - Article 7|url=https://www.fondazionege.org/en/fondazione/statuto/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the President and the Vice President; the Board of Directors; the Secretary-General; the Treasurer; the Scientific Committee; the Assembly of Sponsors; the Board of Auditors.

The Foundation is a not-for-profit, and pursues scientific and cultural aims to promote Catholic education in the world. In particular, the Foundation is committed to: the promotion of research, studies and publications on the thought of the Church as it concerns Catholic education and culture at the school and university levels; the support and organization of conferences and international scientific events on specific issues and projects; to award institutions and scholars who have distinguished themselves in their scientific activity and/or research as it relates to Catholic education and culture; networking and collaboration between educational institutions with regard to management training and qualification and to communication of new scientific discoveries and research; the strengthening of relationships and cooperation between international organizations and institutions dedicated to education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=[7]|first=|date=|title=Statute - Article 3|url=https://www.fondazionege.org/en/fondazione/statuto/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

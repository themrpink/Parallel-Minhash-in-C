[[Image:Cotton gin EWM 2007.jpg|thumb|300px|A model of a 19th-century cotton gin on display at the [[Eli Whitney Museum]] in [[Hamden, Connecticut]]]] 

A '''cotton gin''' &amp;ndash; meaning &quot;cotton engine&quot; &amp;ndash; is a machine that quickly and easily separates [[cotton]] fibers from their seeds, enabling much greater productivity than manual cotton separation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roe1916&quot;&gt;{{citation | last = Roe | first = Joseph Wickham | title = English and American Tool Builders | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1916 | location = New Haven, Connecticut | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ | lccn = 16011753}}. Reprinted by McGraw-Hill, New York and London, 1926 ({{LCCN|27024075}}); and by Lindsay Publications, Inc., Bradley, Illinois, ({{ISBN|978-0-917914-73-7}}).&lt;/ref&gt; The fibers are then processed into various cotton goods such as [[calico]], while any undamaged cotton is used largely for textiles like clothing. The separated seeds may be used to grow more cotton or to produce [[cottonseed oil]]. 
 
Handheld roller gins had been used in the [[Indian subcontinent]] since at earliest AD 500 and then in other regions.&lt;ref name=LakGin/&gt; The Indian worm-gear roller gin, invented sometime around the 16th century,&lt;ref name=india&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K8kO4J3mXUAC&amp;q=Worm-Gear+Gin+India&amp;pg=PA53|title=Economic History of Medieval India, 1200-1500|first=Irfan|last=Habib|date=February 3, 2018|publisher=Pearson Education India|via=Google Books|isbn=9788131727911}}&lt;/ref&gt; has, according to Lakwete, remained virtually unchanged up to the present time. A modern mechanical cotton gin was created by American inventor [[Eli Whitney]] in 1793 and patented in 1794. 

Whitney's gin used a combination of a wire screen and small wire hooks to pull the cotton through, while brushes continuously removed the loose cotton lint to prevent jams. It revolutionized the cotton industry in the United States, but also led to the [[Slavery in the United States|growth of slavery]] in the [[Confederate States of America|American South]] as the demand for cotton harvesting rapidly increased. The invention has thus been identified as an inadvertent contributing factor to the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name=WarCause/&gt; Modern automated cotton gins use multiple powered cleaning cylinders and saws, and offer far higher productivity than their hand-powered precursors.&lt;ref name=AboutGin&gt;[http://inventors.about.com/od/cstartinventions/a/cotton_gin_2.htm inventors.about.com]; &quot;Background on the Cotton Gin&quot;, retrieved October 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eli Whitney with the help of [[Catharine Littlefield Greene|Catharine Greene]] invented his cotton gin in 1793. He began to work on this project after moving to Georgia in search of work, given that farmers were desperately searching for a way to make cotton farming profitable.

==History==
[[Image:Cotton gin harpers.jpg|thumb|&quot;The First Cotton Gin&quot;, an engraving from ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', 1869. This carving depicts a roller gin being used by enslaved Americans, which preceded Eli Whitney's invention.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lakwete|Lakwete]], 182.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A single-roller cotton gin came into use in India by the 5th century. An improvement invented in India was the two-roller gin, known as the &quot;churka&quot;, &quot;charki&quot;, or &quot;wooden-worm-worked roller&quot;.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cambridgeblog.org/2013/06/making-cotton-the-tools-of-the-trade/|title=Making Cotton – The Tools of The Trade|last=|first=|date=2013-06-05|website=Fifteeneightyfour – Academic Perspectives from Cambridge University Press|access-date=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purpose===
Cotton fibers are produced in the seed pods (&quot;bolls&quot;) of the [[cotton plant]] where the fibers (&quot;lint&quot;) in the bolls are tightly interwoven with seeds. To make the fibers usable, the seeds and fibers must first be separated, a task which had been previously performed manually, with production of cotton requiring hours of labor for the separation. Many simple seed-removing devices had been invented, but until the innovation of the cotton gin, most required significant operator attention and worked only on a small scale.&lt;ref&gt;Bellis, Mary. [http://inventors.about.com/od/cstartinventions/a/cotton_gin.htm inventors.about.com]; &quot;The Cotton Gin and Eli Whitney&quot;, retrieved March 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early cotton gins===
The earliest versions of the cotton gin consisted of a single roller made of iron or wood and a flat piece of stone or wood. The earliest evidence of the cotton gin is found in the fifth century, in the form of [[Buddhist]] paintings depicting a single-roller gin in the [[Ajanta Caves]] in western [[India]].&lt;ref name=LakGin/&gt; These early gins were difficult to use and required a great deal of skill. A narrow single roller was necessary to expel the seeds from the cotton without crushing the seeds. The design was similar to that of a [[metate|mealing stone]], which was used to grind grain. The early history of the cotton gin is ambiguous, because archeologists likely mistook the cotton gin's parts for other tools.&lt;ref name=LakGin&gt;[[#Lakwete|Lakwete]], 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the 12th and 14th centuries, dual-roller gins appeared in India and China. The Indian version of the dual-roller gin was prevalent throughout the Mediterranean cotton trade by the 16th century. This mechanical device was, in some areas, driven by water power.&lt;ref name=Baber1&gt;Baber, Zaheer (1996). ''The Science of Empire: Scientific Knowledge, Civilization, and Colonial Rule in India''. Albany: State University of New York Press. p. 57. {{ISBN|0-7914-2919-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mughal India===
{{Main|Mughal Empire}}

The [[worm gear]] roller gin, which was invented in the [[Indian subcontinent]] during the early [[Delhi Sultanate]] era of the 13th to 14th centuries, came into use in the [[Mughal Empire]] sometime around the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;[[Irfan Habib]] (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=K8kO4J3mXUAC&amp;pg=PA53 ''Economic History of Medieval India, 1200–1500'', p. 53], [[Pearson Education]]&lt;/ref&gt; and is still used in the Indian subcontinent through to the present day.&lt;ref name=LakGin/&gt; Another innovation, the incorporation of the [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] handle in the cotton gin, first appeared sometime during the late Delhi Sultanate or the early Mughal Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[Irfan Habib]] (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=K8kO4J3mXUAC&amp;pg=PA53 ''Economic History of Medieval India, 1200–1500'', pp. 53–54], [[Pearson Education]]&lt;/ref&gt; The incorporation of the worm gear and crank handle into the roller cotton gin led to greatly expanded Indian cotton textile production during the Mughal era.&lt;ref&gt;[[Irfan Habib]] (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=K8kO4J3mXUAC&amp;pg=PA54 ''Economic History of Medieval India, 1200–1500'', p. 54], [[Pearson Education]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that, with an Indian cotton gin, which is half machine and half tool, one man and one woman could clean 28 pounds of cotton per day. With a modified Forbes version, one man and a boy could produce 250 pounds per day. If oxen were used to power 16 of these machines, and a few people's labour was used to feed them, they could produce as much work as 750 people did formerly.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Marx]] (1867). Chapter 16: &quot;Machinery and Large-Scale Industry&quot;. ''[[Das Kapital]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The Indian roller cotton gin, known as the ''churka'' or ''charkha'', was introduced to the United States in the mid-18th century, when it was adopted in the [[southern United States]]. The device was adopted for cleaning [[long-staple cotton]], but was not suitable for the [[short-staple cotton]] that was more common in certain states such as [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Several modifications were made to the Indian roller gin by Mr. Krebs in 1772 and Joseph Eve in 1788, but their uses remained limited to the long-staple variety, up until Eli Whitney's development of a short-staple cotton gin in 1793.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hargrett|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Dobbs|first2=Chris|title=Cotton Gins|url=https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/cotton-gins|website=[[New Georgia Encyclopedia]]|date=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eli Whitney's patent===
[[Image:Patent for Cotton Gin (1794) - hi res.jpg|thumb|Eli Whitney's original cotton gin patent, dated March 14, 1794]]
[[Eli Whitney]] (1765–1825) applied for a [[patent]] of his cotton gin on October 28, 1793; the patent was granted on March 14, 1794, but was not validated until 1807. Whitney's patent was assigned patent number 72X.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/cstartinventions/ss/patent_X72.htm|title=Who Invented the Cotton Gin and How Did it Impact History?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is slight controversy over whether the idea of the modern cotton gin and its constituent elements are correctly attributed to Eli Whitney. The popular image of Whitney inventing the cotton gin is attributed to an article on the subject written in the early 1870s and later reprinted in 1910 in ''The Library of Southern Literature''. In this article, the author claimed [[Catharine Littlefield Greene]] suggested to Whitney the use of a brush-like component instrumental in separating out the seeds and cotton. To date, Greene's role in the invention of the gin has not been verified independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findingdulcinea.com/features/profiles/l/catharine-littlefield-greene.html|title=Catharine Littlefield Greene, Brain Behind the Cotton Gin|publisher=Finding Dulcinea|date=March 4, 2010|accessdate=November 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitney's cotton gin model was capable of cleaning {{convert|50|lb|kg}} of lint per day. The model consisted of a wooden cylinder surrounded by rows of slender spikes, which pulled the lint through the bars of a comb-like grid.&lt;ref name=harr&gt;Harr, M. E. (1977). ''Mechanics of particulate media: A probabilistic approach''. McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; The grids were closely spaced, preventing the seeds from passing through. Loose cotton was brushed off, preventing the mechanism from jamming.

Many contemporary inventors attempted to develop a design that would process [[short staple cotton]], and Hodgen Holmes, Robert Watkins, [[William Longstreet]], and John Murray had all been issued patents for improvements to the cotton gin by 1796.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lakwete|Lakwete]], 64–76.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the evidence indicates Whitney did invent the saw gin, for which he is famous. Although he spent many years in court attempting to enforce his patent against planters who made unauthorized copies, a change in patent law ultimately made his claim legally enforceable – too late for him to make much money from the device in the single year remaining before the patent expired.&lt;ref&gt;''The American Historical Review'' by Henry Eldridge Bourne, Robert Livingston Schuyler

===McCarthy's gin===
While Whitney's gin facilitated the cleaning of seeds from short-staple cotton, it damaged the fibers of extra-long staple cotton (''[[Gossypium barbadense]]''). In 1840 Fones McCarthy received a patent for a &quot;Smooth Cylinder Cotton-gin&quot;, a roller gin. McCarthy's gin was marketed for use with both short-staple and extra-long staple cotton, but was particularly useful for processing long-staple cotton. After McCarthy's patent expired in 1861, McCarthy type gins were manufactured in Britain and sold around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lakwete|first1=Angela|title=Fones McCarthy|url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1028|website=Encyclopedia of Alabama|publisher=Auburn University|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCarthy's gin was adopted for cleaning the Sea Island variety of extra-long staple cotton grown in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. It cleaned cotton several times faster than the older gins, and, when powered by one horse, produced 150 to 200 pounds of lint a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shofner|first1=Jerrel H.|last2=Rogers|first2=William Warren|title=Sea Island Cotton in Ante-Bellum Florida|journal=The Florida Historical Quarterly|date=April 1962|volume=40|issue=4|pages=378–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The McCarthy gin used a reciprocating knife to detach seed from the lint. Vibration caused by the reciprocating motion limited the speed at which the gin could operate. In the middle of the 20th Century gins using a rotating blade replaced ones using a reciprocating blade. These descendants of the McCarthy gin are the only gins now used for extra-long staple cotton in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gillum|first1=Marvis M.|last2=Van Doorn|first2=D.

===Munger System Gin===
[[File:Nation's Oldest Cotton Gin -- Burton, Texas.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The diesel-powered gin in Burton, Texas is one of the oldest in the United States that still functions.]]
For a decade and a half after the end of the Civil War in 1865, a number of innovative features became widely used for ginning in the United States. They included steam power instead of animal power, an automatic feeder to assure that the gin stand ran smoothly, a condenser to make the clean cotton coming out of the gin easier to handle, and indoor presses so that cotton no longer had to be carried across the gin yard to be baled.&lt;ref&gt;Aiken, Charles S. (April 1973). &quot;The Evolution of Cotton Ginning in the Southeastern United States&quot;. Geographical Review. 63 (2): 205.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 1879, while he was running his father's gin in [[Rutersville, Texas]], [[Robert S. Munger]] invented additional system ginning techniques. Robert and his wife, Mary Collett, later moved to [[Mexia, Texas]], built a system gin, and obtained related patents.&lt;ref&gt; Mann, Sally (2016). Hold still : a memoir with photographs. Little, Brown and Company. pp. 314–317. {{ISBN|978-0-316-24775-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Munger System Ginning Outfit (or system gin) integrated all the ginning operation machinery, thus assuring the cotton would flow through the machines smoothly. Such system gins use air to move cotton from machine to machine.&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, Edward (June 1, 1880). &quot;Report on the Cotton Manufacturers of the United States&quot;. In Department of Interior, Census Office. Report on the Manufacturers of the United States at the Tenth Census. Government Printing Office. pp. 937–984.&lt;/ref&gt; Munger's motivation for his inventions included improving employee working conditions in the gin. However, the selling point for most gin owners was the accompanying cost savings while producing cotton both more speedily and of higher quality.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Sally (2016). Hold still : a memoir with photographs. Little, Brown and Company. p. 318. {{ISBN|978-0-316-24775-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s, many other advances had been made in ginning machinery, but the manner in which cotton flowed through the gin machinery continued to be the Munger system.&lt;ref&gt;Aiken, Charles S. (April 1973). &quot;The Evolution of Cotton Ginning in the Southeastern United States&quot;. Geographical Review. 63 (2): 205–206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic Historian William H. Phillips referred to the development of system ginning as &quot;The Munger Revolution&quot; in cotton ginning.&lt;ref&gt; Phillips, William (1994). &quot;Making a Business of It: The Evolution of Southern Cotton Gin Patenting, 1831-1890&quot;. Agricultural History. 68 (2): 88, 90.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote,

&quot;[The Munger] innovations were the culmination of what geographer Charles S. Aiken has termed the second ginning revolution, in which the privately owned plantation gins were replaced by large-scale public ginneries. This revolution, in turn, led to a major restructuring of the cotton gin industry, as the small, scattered gin factories and shops of the nineteenth century gave way to a dwindling number of large twentieth-century corporations designing and constructing entire ginning operations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Phillips, William (1994). &quot;Making a Business of It: The Evolution of Southern Cotton Gin Patenting, 1831-1890&quot;. Agricultural History. 68 (2): 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the few (and perhaps only) examples of a Munger gin left in existence is on display at [[Frogmore Plantation]] in Louisiana.

===Effects in the United States===
[[Image:17 09 024 jarrell.jpg|thumb|left|Cotton gin at [[Jarrell Plantation]]]]

Prior to the introduction of the mechanical cotton gin, cotton had required considerable labor to clean and separate the fibers from the seeds.&lt;ref&gt;Hamner, Christopher. [http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24411 teachinghistory.org], &quot;The Disaster of Innovation&quot;, retrieved July 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; With Eli Whitney's gin, cotton became a tremendously profitable business, creating many fortunes in the [[History of the United States (1789–1849)|Antebellum South]]. Cities such as [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]; [[Mobile, Alabama]]; [[Charleston, South Carolina]]; and [[Galveston, Texas]] became major shipping ports, deriving substantial economic benefit from cotton raised throughout the South. Additionally, the greatly expanded supply of cotton created strong demand for textile machinery and improved machine designs that replaced wooden parts with metal. This led to the invention of many [[machine tool]]s in the early 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roe1916&quot;/&gt;

The invention of the cotton gin caused massive growth in the production of cotton in the United States, concentrated mostly in the South. Cotton production expanded from 750,000 bales in 1830 to 2.85 million bales in 1850.  As a result, the region became even more dependent on [[plantations in the American South|plantations]] that used enslaved American labor, with plantation agriculture becoming the largest sector of its economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pierson, Parke |url=http://www.historynet.com/seeds-of-conflict.htm|title=Seeds of conflict|journal=America's Civil War|date=September 2009|volume=22|issue= 4|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it took a single slave about ten hours to separate a single pound of fiber from the seeds, a team of two or three slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in just one day.&lt;ref&gt;Woods, Robert (September 1, 2009). &quot;A Turn of the Crank Started the Civil War.&quot; ''Mechanical Engineering''.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of slaves rose in concert with the increase in cotton production, increasing from around 700,000 in 1790 to around 3.2 million in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith, N.

[[Image:Lummus Cotton Gin Advertisement.JPG|thumb|right|An 1896 advertisement for the Lummus cotton gin]]

Because of its inadvertent effect on American slavery, and on its ensuring that the South's economy developed in the direction of plantation-based agriculture (while encouraging the growth of the textile industry elsewhere, such as in the North), the invention of the cotton gin is frequently cited as one of the indirect causes of the American Civil War.&lt;ref name=WarCause&gt;Kelly, Martin.

==Modern cotton gins==
{{refimprove|section|date=March 2017}}
[[Image:ginplant.jpg|thumb|left|Diagram of a modern cotton gin plant, displaying numerous stages of production]]
[[File:Cotton jins in use.jpg|thumb|right|Modern cotton gins]]

In modern cotton production, cotton arrives at industrial cotton gins either in trailers, in compressed rectangular &quot;[[cotton module builder|modules]]&quot; weighing up to 10 [[metric ton]]s each or in polyethylene wrapped round modules similar to a bale of hay produced during the picking process by the most recent generation of cotton pickers. Cotton arriving at the gin is sucked in via a pipe, approximately {{convert|16|in|cm}} in diameter, that is swung over the cotton. This pipe is usually manually operated, but is increasingly automated in modern cotton plants. The need for trailers to haul the product to the gin has been drastically reduced since the introduction of modules. If the cotton is shipped in modules, the module feeder breaks the modules apart using spiked rollers and extracts the largest pieces of foreign material from the cotton. The module feeder's loose cotton is then sucked into the same starting point as the trailer cotton.

The cotton then enters a dryer, which removes excess moisture. The cylinder cleaner uses six or seven rotating, spiked cylinders to break up large clumps of cotton.  Finer foreign material, such as soil and leaves, passes through rods or screens for removal.  The stick machine uses [[centrifugal force]] to remove larger foreign matter, such as sticks and burrs, while the cotton is held by rapidly rotating saw cylinders.

The gin stand uses the teeth of rotating saws to pull the cotton through a series of &quot;ginning ribs&quot;, which pull the fibers from the seeds which are too large to pass through the ribs. The cleaned seed is then removed from the gin via an [[auger conveyor]] system. The seed is reused for planting or is sent to an [[oil mill]] to be further processed into cottonseed oil and cottonseed meal. The lint cleaners again use saws and grid bars, this time to separate immature seeds and any remaining foreign matter from the fibers.  The bale press then compresses the cotton into bales for storage and shipping. Modern gins can process up to {{convert|15|t|lb}} of cotton per hour.

Modern cotton gins create a substantial amount of cotton gin residue (CGR) consisting of sticks, leaves, dirt, immature bolls, and cottonseed. Research is currently under way to investigate the use of this waste in producing [[ethanol]]. Due to fluctuations in the chemical composition in processing, there is difficulty in creating a consistent ethanol process, but there is potential to further maximize the utilization of waste in the cotton production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biotechnology for Fuels and Chemicals|first1=Foster A.|last1=Agblevor|first2=Sandra|last2=Batz|first3=Jessica|last3=Trumbo|date=February 3, 2018|publisher=Humana Press, Totowa, NJ|pages=219–230|doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-0057-4_17|chapter = Composition and Ethanol Production Potential of Cotton Gin Residues|isbn = 978-1-4612-6592-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AboutGin/&gt;

'''FreeCell''' is a [[Patience (game)|solitaire]] [[card game]] played using the [[standard 52-card deck]]. It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few [[Card_game#Deal|deals]] are unsolvable,&lt;ref name=&quot;Leonhard2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BjhFgc4DdjIC&amp;pg=PA293 |title=Windows 7 All-in-One for Dummies |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |first=Woody |last=Leonhard |page=293 |year=2009 |isbn=9780470487631}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all cards are dealt face-up from the very beginning of the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;FCFAQ&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solitairelaboratory.com/fcfaq.html |title=FreeCell -- Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) |website=Solitaire Laboratory |last=Keller |first=Michael |date=August 4, 2015 |accessdate=February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the seed value used by the [[pseudorandom number generator|random number generator]] to shuffle the cards).&lt;ref name=&quot;FCFAQ&quot; /&gt;

Microsoft has included a [[Microsoft FreeCell|FreeCell computer game]] with every release of the Windows operating system since 1995, greatly contributing to the game's popularity among users of personal computers, even leading to the creation of several websites devoted to FreeCell.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, Jim and Denton, Carey.  ''The Treasury of Family Games'' (page 105). Reader's Digest, 2003 ({{ISBN|9780762104314}})&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft FreeCell is so definitive for many FreeCell players that many other software implementations strive for compatibility with its [[pseudorandom number generator|random number generator]] in order to replicate its numbered hands.&lt;ref name=&quot;FCFAQ&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pysolfc.sourceforge.net/doc/rules/freecell.html |title=PySol - Rules for Freecell |website=PySolFC documentation |accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rules ==

=== Construction and layout ===
*One standard 52-card deck is used.
*There are four open [[Solitaire terminology#Game layout|cell]]s and four open [[Solitaire terminology#Foundation|foundation]]s.  Some alternate rules use between one and ten cells.
*Cards are dealt face-up into eight [[Solitaire terminology#Deal|cascade]]s, four of which comprise seven cards each and four of which comprise six cards each.  Some alternate rules will use between four and ten cascades.

=== Building during play ===
*The top card of each cascade begins a [[Solitaire terminology#Game layout|tableau]].
*Tableaux must be [[Solitaire terminology#Building|built]] down by alternating colors.
*Foundations are built up by suit.

=== Moves ===
*Any cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.
*Complete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. Computer implementations often show this motion, but players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.

The number of cards a player can move is equivalent to number of empty cells plus one, with that number doubling based on how many empty cascades there are. The mathematical equation for the number of cards that can be moved is (2&lt;sup&gt;M&lt;/sup&gt;)×(N + 1), where M is the number of empty cascades and N is the number of empty cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=solitaire - FreeCell: How many cards can be moved at once? |url=https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/a/45157 |website=Board &amp; Card Games Stack Exchange}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Victory ===
*The game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.

It is estimated that 99.999% of possible deals are solvable.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} Deal number 11982 from the Windows version of FreeCell is an example of an unsolvable FreeCell deal, the only deal among the original &quot;Microsoft 32,000&quot; which is unsolvable.&lt;ref name=&quot;FCFAQ&quot; /&gt;

== History &amp; Variants ==
One of the oldest ancestors of FreeCell is '''[[Eight Off]]'''. In the June 1968 edition of ''[[Scientific American]]'', [[Martin Gardner]] described in his &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; column a game by C. L. Baker that is similar to FreeCell, except that cards on the tableau are built by suit rather than by alternate colors. Gardner wrote, &quot;The game was taught to Baker by his father, who in turn learned it from an Englishman during the 1920s.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mathematical Games |journal=Scientific American |first=Martin |last=Gardner |date=June 1968 |volume=218 |issue=6 |page=114 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0668-112}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This variant is now called '''[[Baker's Game]]'''. FreeCell's origins may date back even further to 1945 and to a Scandinavian game called Napoleon in St. Helena (not the solitaire game Napoleon at St. Helena, also known as [[Forty Thieves (card game)|Forty Thieves]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;FCFAQ&quot; /&gt;

Paul Alfille changed Baker's Game by making cards build according to alternate colors, thus creating FreeCell. He implemented the first computerised version as a medical student at the University of Illinois,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of FreeCell Solitaire |url=https://solitaired.com/freecell#historyoffreecellsolitaire |website=Solitaired |accessdate=4 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[TUTOR (programming language)|TUTOR programming language]] for the [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO]] educational computer system in 1978. Alfille was able to display easily recognizable graphical images of playing cards on the {{nowrap|512 × 512}} monochrome display on the PLATO systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E6DE143DF934A25753C1A9649C8B63 |title=One Down, 31,999 to Go: Surrendering to a Solitary Obsession |work=New York Times |last=Kaye |first=Ellen |date=October 17, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This original FreeCell environment allowed games with 4–10 columns and 1–10 cells in addition to the standard {{nowrap|8 × 4}} game. For each variant, the program stored a ranked list of the players with the longest winning streaks.  There was also a tournament system that allowed people to compete to win difficult hand-picked deals.  Paul Alfille described this early FreeCell environment in more detail in an interview from 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freecell.net/f/c/alfille.html |title=Interview with Paul Alfille |work=Freecell.net |first=Dennis |last=Cronin |date=May 4, 2000 |accessdate=March 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, researchers used [[evolutionary computation]] methods to create winning FreeCell players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.genetic-programming.org/hc2013/Sipper-Paper.pdf |title=Evolutionary Design of FreeCell Solvers |journal=IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games |first1=Achiya |last1=Elyasaf |first2=Ami |last2=Hauptman |first3=Moshe |last3=Sipper |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=270-281 |date=December 2012 |doi=10.1109/TCIAIG.2012.2210423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

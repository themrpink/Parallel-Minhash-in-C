The punning [[nickname]] ''Colossus of Roads'' was given to Telford by his friend, the eventual [[Poet Laureate]], [[Robert Southey]]. Telford's reputation as a man of letters may have preceded his fame as an engineer: he had published poetry between 1779 and 1784, and an account of a tour of Scotland with Southey. His will left bequests to Southey (who would later write Telford's biography), the poet [[Thomas Campbell (poet)|Thomas Campbell]] (1777–1844) and to the publishers of the ''[[Edinburgh Encyclopædia]]'' (to which he had been a contributor).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1821, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

==The 'Telford Church'==
[[File:Telfordchurchulva.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A 'Telford church' on [[Ulva]] (1827/8) in the [[Inner Hebrides]]]]
An Act of Parliament in 1823 provided a grant of £50,000 for the building of up to 40 churches and manses in communities without any church buildings (hence the alternative name: 'Parliamentary Church' or 'Parliamentary Kirk').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Edinburgh Review |volume=70 |pages=25 |date=October 1839 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total cost was not to exceed £1500 on any site and Telford was commissioned to undertake the design. He developed a simple church of T-shaped plan and two manse designs – a single-storey and a two-storey, adaptable to site and ground conditions, and to brick or stone construction, at £750 each. Of the 43 churches originally planned, 32 were eventually built around the Scottish highlands and islands (the other 11 were achieved by redoing existing buildings). The last of these churches was built in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121020151435/http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/images/l/DP016489/ Telford Church Design]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.geograph.org.uk/article/Thomas-Telfords-Parliamentary-Kirks |title= Thomas Telford's Parliamentary Kirks |author= Anne Burgess |publisher= [[Geograph Britain and Ireland]] |id= licence: cc |date= March 2014 |accessdate= 5 March 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170305200058/http://www.geograph.org.uk/article/Thomas-Telfords-Parliamentary-Kirks |archive-date= 5 March 2017 |url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have been restored and/or converted to private use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rias.org.uk/awards/rias-awards/rias-awards-2013/ |title= RIAS Awards 2013 |work= The Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland |accessdate= 5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- [[RIAS Andrew Doolan Best Building in Scotland Award]] --&gt;

==Late career==
Other works by Telford include the [[St Katharine Docks]] (1824–28) close to [[Tower Bridge]] in central London, where he worked with the architect [[Philip Hardwick]], the Gloucester and Berkeley Ship Canal (today known as the [[Gloucester and Sharpness Canal]]), [[Over Bridge]] near Gloucester, the second [[Harecastle Tunnel#Telford Tunnel|Harecastle Tunnel]] on the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]] (1827), and the [[Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal]] (today part of the [[Shropshire Union Canal]]) – started in May 1826 but finished, after Telford's death, in January 1835. At the time of its construction in 1829, [[Galton Bridge]] was the longest single span in the world. Telford surveyed and planned the [[Macclesfield Canal]], which was completed by William Crosley (or Crossley)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=History of the Macclesfield Canal|url=http://www.penninewaterways.co.uk/macclesfield/mac2.htm#:~:text=Canal-,History%20of%20the%20Macclesfield%20Canal,high%20moorland%20to%20the%20east.|access-date=2020-07-17|website=www.penninewaterways.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He also built [[Whitstable]] harbour in Kent in 1832, in connection with the [[Canterbury and Whitstable Railway]] with an unusual system for flushing out mud using a tidal reservoir. He also completed the ''[[Trent and Mersey Canal|Grand Trunk]]'' after [[James Brindley]] died due to being over-worked.

In 1820, Telford was appointed the first President of the recently formed [[Institution of Civil Engineers]], a post he held until his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Civils&quot;&gt;

==Freemasonry==
He was Initiated into Freemasonry in Antiquity Lodge, No. 26, (Portsmouth, England) in 1770. This lodge no longer exists. He was a founder member of Phoenix Lodge, No. 257 (also in Portsmouth). Telford designed a room within the George Inn for the lodge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glover&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Glover |first1=Julian |title=Man of Iron: Thomas Telford and the Building of Britain |date=2017 |isbn=9781408837467 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1786 he became an affiliate member of Salopian Lodge, No. 262 (Shrewsbury, England).&lt;ref&gt;Famous Scottish Freemasons.

==Telford's death==
Telford's young draughtsman and clerk 1830–34 [[George Turnbull (civil engineer)|George Turnbull]] in his diary states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''On the 23rd'' [August 1834] ''Mr Telford was taken seriously ill of a bilious derangement to which he had been liable … he grew worse and worse'' … [surgeons] ''attended him twice a day, but it was to no avail for he died on the 2nd September, very peacefully at about 5pm. … His old servant James Handscombe and I were the only two in the house'' [24 Abingdon Street, London] ''when he died. He was never married. Mr [[Alexander Milne (civil servant)|Milne]] and Mr [[John Rickman|Rickman]] were, no doubt, Telford's most intimate friends. … I went to Mr Milne and under his direction … made all the arrangements about the house and correspondence. … Telford had no blood relations that we knew of. The funeral took place on the 10th September'' [in [[Westminster Abbey]]]. … Mr Telford was of the most genial disposition and a delightful companion, his laugh was the heartiest I ever heard; it was a pleasure to be in his society.''&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Diaries of George Turnbull (Chief Engineer, [[East Indian Railway Company]]) held at the [[Centre of South Asian Studies]] at [[Cambridge University]], England&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pages 15 to 18 of ''George Turnbull, C.E.'' the 437-page memoirs published privately 1893: scanned copy held in the British Library, London on compact disk since 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thomas Telford was buried in the nave of Westminster Abbey; a statue was erected to him nearby, in St Andrew's Chapel adjoining the north transept.&lt;ref&gt;'The Abbey Scientists' Hall, A.R. p41: London; Roger &amp; Robert Nicholson; 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his life Telford had a great affection for his birthplace of Eskdale and its people and in his will left legacies to the two local libraries at Westerkirk and Langholm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.langholm-online.co.uk/pages/content.asp?pageid=514 &quot;Thomas Telford 1757-1854&quot; in Langholm Online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514064714/https://www.langholm-online.co.uk/pages/content.asp?pageid=514 |date=14 May 2018 }}, retrieved 12 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
In 2011 he was one of seven inaugural inductees to the [[Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.engineeringhalloffame.org/listing-1.html |title=Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame |work=engineeringhalloffame.org |year=2012 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Telford the poet==

[[George Turnbull (civil engineer)|George Turnbull]] states that Telford wrote and gave him a poem:&lt;ref&gt;Diaries of [[George Turnbull (civil engineer)|George Turnbull]] (Chief Engineer, [[East Indian Railway Company]]) held at the [[Centre of South Asian Studies]] at [[Cambridge University]], England&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pages 19 to 21 of ''George Turnbull, C.E.'' the 437-page memoirs published privately 1893: scanned copy held in the British Library, London on compact disk since 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

{{poemquote|
''On reading an account of the death of [[Robert Burns|ROBERT BURNS]], the SCOT POET''

CLAD in the sable weeds of woe,
The Scottish genius mourns,
As o'er your tomb her sorrows flow,
The &quot;narrow house&quot; of Burns.'

Each laurel round his humble urn,
She strews with pious care,
And by soft airs to distance borne,
These accents strike the ear.

Farewell my lov'd, my favourite child,
A mother's pride farewell!
The muses on thy cradle smiled,
Ah! now they ring thy knell.

''---- ten verses and then ----''

And round the tomb the plough shall pass,
And yellow autumn smile;
And village maids shall seek the place,
To crown thy hallowed pile.

While yearly comes the opening spring,
While autumn wan returns ;
Each rural voice shall grateful sing,
And SCOTLAND boasts of BURNS.

''22nd August, 1796. T.T.''
}}

(Turnbull includes notes that explain nine references to Burns's life in the poem.)

Turnbull also states:&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page 18 of ''George Turnbull, C.E.'' the 437-page memoirs published privately 1893: scanned copy held in the British Library, London on compact disk since 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;His ability and perseverance may be understood from various literary compositions of after life, such as the articles he contributed to the ''[[Edinburgh Encyclopædia]]'', such as Architecture, Bridge-building, and Canal-making. Singular to say the earliest distinction he acquired in life was as a poet. Even at 30 years of age he reprinted at Shrewsbury a poem called &quot;Eskdale&quot;, … Some others of his poems are in my possession.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Khajuraho7.jpg|thumb|300px|upright|Erotic sculptures from [[Khajuraho Group of Monuments|Khajuraho temple complex]], [[India]].]]
The views of religions and religious believers range widely, from giving sex and sexuality a rather negative connotation to believing that sex is the highest expression of the divine. Some religions distinguish between sexual activities that are practised for biological reproduction (sometimes allowed only when in formal marital status and at a [[age of consent|certain age]]) and those practised only for sexual pleasure in evaluating relative morality.

==Overview==
[[Sexual ethics|Sexual morality]] has varied greatly over time and between cultures. A society's [[sexual norm]]s—standards of sexual conduct—can be linked to [[religion|religious]] beliefs, or social and environmental conditions, or all of these. Sexuality and reproduction are fundamental elements in human interaction and societies worldwide. Furthermore, &quot;sexual restriction&quot; is one of the [[cultural universal|universals]] of culture peculiar to all human societies.&lt;ref&gt;[[George P. Murdock]]. &quot;On the universals of culture&quot;. In: Linton (ed), ''The Science of Man in the World Crisis'' (1945).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alice Ann Cleaveland, Jean Craven, Maryanne Danfelser. ''Universals of Culture''. Center for Global Perspectives, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, most religions have seen a need to address the question of a &quot;proper&quot; role for sexuality. Religions have differing codes of sexual morality, which regulate sexual activity or assign normative values to certain sexually charged actions or ideas. Each major religion has developed a [[moral code]] covering issues of [[human sexuality|sexuality]], [[morality]], [[ethics]] etc. These moral codes seek to regulate the situations that can give rise to sexual interest and to influence people's [[human sexual activity|sexual activities]] and practices.

==Abrahamic faiths==
{{See also|Abrahamic religion}}

===Baháʼí faith===
{{Expand section|date=August 2018}}
In the [[Baháʼí Faith]], sexual relationships are permitted only between a husband and wife. [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, forbids extramarital sexual intercourse in his book of laws, the [[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author = Universal House of Justice |year = 1992 |title = The Kitáb-i-Aqdas |publisher = Baháʼí Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 978-0-85398-999-8 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-53.html | page = 191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kiq&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author = Bahá'u'lláh |authorlink = Bahá'u'lláh |origyear = 1873 |year = 1992 |title = The Kitáb-i-Aqdas |publisher = Baháʼí Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 978-0-85398-999-8 | page = 26 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-4.html#gr19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Baháʼí consideration of sex is that [[chastity]] should be practised by both sexes before marriage because it is commendable ethically and leads to a happy and successful marital life. The Baháʼí Faith recognizes the value of the sex impulse, but judges that its proper expression is within the [[Baháʼí marriage|institution of marriage]]: Baháʼís do not believe in suppression of the sex impulse but in its regulation and control.&lt;ref name=&quot;log&quot;&gt;Letter written on behalf of [[Shoghi Effendi]] September 5, 1938.

====New Testament====
[[Paul the Apostle]] stated in [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] that it is good for the unmarried to remain this way, but if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, &quot;To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as I am. But if they are not practising self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to be aflame with passion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|1 Corinthians|7:8–9|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, Paul's view of sex is also that it is actually unnecessary for those with certain gifts&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%207 1 Corinthians 7:7]&lt;/ref&gt; (presumably [[Celibacy#Christianity|&quot;celibacy&quot;]]).

New Testament scholar [[N. T. Wright]] asserts that Paul absolutely forbade fornication, irrespective of a new Christian's former cultural practices. Wright notes &quot;If a Corinthian were to say, 'Because I'm a Corinthian, I have always had a string of girl-friends I sleep with, that's part of our culture,' Paul would respond, 'Not now you're a Christian you don't.'... When someone disagreed with Paul's clear rules on immorality or angry disputes, the matters he deals with in Colossians 3.5–10, he is... firm, as we see dramatically in 1 Corinthians 5 and 6. There is no place in the Christian fellowship for such practices and for such a person.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Communion_Koinonia.htm |title=Communion and Koinonia: Pauline Reflections on Tolerance and Boundaries |website=Ntwrightpage.com |date= |accessdate=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have suggested that Paul's treatment of sex was influenced by his conviction that the [[Christian eschatology|end of the world]] was imminent. Under this view, Paul, believing that the world would soon end, took it as a corollary that all earthly concerns,&lt;ref name=&quot;biblegateway1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%207 |title=1 Corinthians 7 - Concerning Married Life - Now for the |publisher=Bible Gateway |date= |accessdate=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; including sex, should hold little interest for Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brundage|1987|pp=59–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pauline epistles|Paul's letters]] show far greater concern with sexual issues than the gospel writers attributed to Jesus, since Paul was building Christian communities over decades and responding to various issues that arose.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In [[telecommunication]]s, the term '''attenuation constant''', also called '''attenuation parameter''' or '''[[attenuation coefficient]]''', is the attenuation of an electromagnetic wave propagating through a [[Transmission medium|medium]] per unit distance from the source. It is the real part of the propagation constant and is measured in [[neper]]s per metre.  A neper is approximately 8.7&amp;nbsp;[[decibel|dB]].  Attenuation constant can be defined by the amplitude ratio

:&lt;math&gt;\left|\frac{A_0}{A_x}\right|=e^{\alpha x}&lt;/math&gt;

The propagation constant per unit length is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the sending end current or voltage to the receiving end current or voltage.

===Copper lines===

The attenuation constant for copper lines (or ones made of any other conductor) can be calculated from the primary line coefficients as shown above.  For a line meeting the [[Heaviside condition|distortionless condition]], with a conductance ''G'' in the insulator, the attenuation constant is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\sqrt{RG}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

however, a real line is unlikely to meet this condition without the addition of [[loading coils]] and, furthermore, there are some frequency dependent effects operating on the primary &quot;constants&quot; which cause a frequency dependence of the loss.  There are two main components to these losses, the metal loss and the dielectric loss.

The loss of most transmission lines are dominated by the metal loss, which causes a frequency dependency due to finite conductivity of metals, and the [[skin effect]] inside a conductor. The skin effect causes R along the conductor to be approximately dependent on frequency according to

:&lt;math&gt;R \propto \sqrt{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;

Losses in the dielectric depend on the [[loss tangent]] (tan&amp;nbsp;''δ'') of the material divided by the wavelength of the signal. Thus they are directly proportional to the frequency.

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_d={{\pi}\sqrt{\varepsilon_r}\over{\lambda}}{\tan \delta}&lt;/math&gt;

===Optical fibre===

The attenuation constant for a particular [[propagation mode]] in an [[optical fiber]] is the real part of the axial propagation constant.

==Phase constant==
In [[electromagnetic theory]], the '''phase constant''', also called '''phase change constant''', '''parameter''' or '''coefficient''' is the imaginary component of the propagation constant for a plane wave.  It represents the change in phase per unit length along the path travelled by the wave at any instant and is equal to the [[real part]] of the [[wavenumber#In wave equations|angular wavenumber]] of the wave.  It is represented by the symbol ''β'' and is measured in units of radians per unit length.

From the definition of (angular) wavenumber for TEM waves:

:&lt;math&gt;k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} = \beta&lt;/math&gt;

For a [[transmission line]], the [[Heaviside condition]] of the [[telegrapher's equation]] tells us that the wavenumber must be proportional to frequency for the transmission of the wave to be undistorted in the [[time domain]].  This includes, but is not limited to, the ideal case of a lossless line.  The reason for this condition can be seen by considering that a useful signal is composed of many different wavelengths in the frequency domain.  For there to be no distortion of the [[waveform]], all these waves must travel at the same velocity so that they arrive at the far end of the line at the same time as a [[group velocity|group]].  Since wave [[phase velocity]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;v_p=\frac{\lambda}{T}=\frac{f}{\tilde{\nu}}=\frac{\omega}{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

it is proved that ''β'' is required to be proportional to ''ω''. In terms of primary coefficients of the line, this yields from the telegrapher's equation for a distortionless line the condition

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \omega \sqrt{LC}&lt;/math&gt;

However, practical lines can only be expected to approximately meet this condition over a limited frequency band.

In particular, the phase constant  &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is not always equivalent to the [[wavenumber]]  &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Generally speaking, the following relation

:&lt;math&gt; \beta=k &lt;/math&gt;

is tenable to the [[Transverse mode|TEM]] wave (transverse electromagnetic wave) which travels in free space or TEM-devices such as the [[coaxial cable]] and [[Twin-lead|two parallel wires transmission lines]]. Nevertheless, it is invalid to the [[Transverse mode|TE]] wave (transverse electric wave) and [[Transverse mode|TM]] wave  (transverse magnetic wave). For example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Pozar |year=2012 |title=Microwave Engineering |edition=4th |publisher=John Wiley &amp;Sons |isbn=978-0-470-63155-3 |pages=62–164 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a hollow [[waveguide]] where the TEM wave cannot exist but TE and TM waves can propagate,

:&lt;math&gt;k=\frac{\omega}{c} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta=k\sqrt{1-\frac{\omega_c^2}{\omega^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt; \omega_{c} &lt;/math&gt;  is the [[cutoff frequency]]. In a rectangular waveguide, the cutoff frequency is

:&lt;math&gt;
  \omega_{c} = c \sqrt{\left(\frac{n \pi}{a}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{m \pi}{b}\right) ^2}, 
&lt;/math&gt;

where the integers &lt;math&gt;n,m \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; are the mode numbers, and ''a'' and ''b'' the lengths of the sides of the rectangle. For TE modes, &lt;math&gt; n,m \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; (but &lt;math&gt; n = m = 0&lt;/math&gt; is not allowed), while for TM modes &lt;math&gt; n, m \ge 1 &lt;/math&gt;. The phase velocity equals

:&lt;math&gt;v_p=\frac{\omega}{\beta}=\frac{c}{\sqrt{1-\frac{\omega_\mathrm{c}^2}{\omega^2}}}&gt;c &lt;/math&gt;

The phase constant is also an important concept in [[quantum mechanics]] because the [[momentum]]  &lt;math&gt; p&lt;/math&gt; of a [[quantum]] is directly proportional to it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wang,Z.Y.|title=Generalized momentum equation of quantum mechanics|journal=Optical and Quantum Electronics|volume=48|pages=1–9|date=2016|doi=10.1007/s11082-015-0261-8|issue=2|s2cid=124732329}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv | author= Tremblay,R., Doyon,N., Beaudoin-Bertrand,J. | title = TE-TM Electromagnetic modes and states in quantum physics |eprint =1611.01472 | year = 2016 | class = quant-ph }}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e.

:&lt;math&gt; p= \hbar \beta&lt;/math&gt;

where  {{math| ''ħ''}} is called the [[reduced Planck constant]] (pronounced &quot;h-bar&quot;).  It is equal to the [[Planck constant]] divided by {{math|2''π''}}.

==Filters and two-port networks==
The term propagation constant or propagation function is applied to [[Electronic filters|filters]] and other [[two-port network]]s used for [[signal processing]].  In these cases, however, the attenuation and phase coefficients are expressed in terms of nepers and radians per [[Electronic filter topology#Passive topologies|network section]] rather than per unit length.  Some authors&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei et al, p49&lt;/ref&gt; make a distinction between per unit length measures (for which &quot;constant&quot; is used) and per section measures (for which &quot;function&quot; is used).

The propagation constant is a useful concept in filter design which invariably uses a cascaded section [[Electronic filter topology|topology]].  In a cascaded topology, the propagation constant, attenuation constant and phase constant of individual sections may be simply added to find the total propagation constant etc.

===Cascaded networks===
[[Image:Adding propagation constant of filters.svg|center|thumb|750px|Three networks with arbitrary propagation constants and impedances connected in cascade.  The ''Z&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' terms represent [[image impedance]] and it is assumed that connections are between matching image impedances.]]

The ratio of output to input voltage for each network is given by&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei et al pp51-52&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_1}{V_2}=\sqrt{\frac{Z_{I1}}{Z_{I2}}}e^{\gamma_1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_2}{V_3}=\sqrt{\frac{Z_{I2}}{Z_{I3}}}e^{\gamma_2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_3}{V_4}=\sqrt{\frac{Z_{I3}}{Z_{I4}}}e^{\gamma_3}&lt;/math&gt;

The terms &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{Z_{In}}{Z_{Im}}}&lt;/math&gt; are impedance scaling terms&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei et al pp37-38&lt;/ref&gt; and their use is explained in the [[Image impedance#Transfer function|image impedance]] article.

The overall voltage ratio is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_1}{V_4}=\frac{V_1}{V_2}\cdot\frac{V_2}{V_3}\cdot\frac{V_3}{V_4}=\sqrt{\frac{Z_{I1}}{Z_{I4}}}e^{\gamma_1+\gamma_2+\gamma_3}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus for ''n'' cascaded sections all having matching impedances facing each other, the overall propagation constant is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_\mathrm{total}=\gamma_1 + \gamma_2 + \gamma_3 + \cdots + \gamma_n&lt;/math&gt;

      <text bytes="750" xml:space="preserve">In [[telecommunication]], a '''propagation path obstruction''' is a man-made or natural physical feature that lies near enough to a [[radio]] path to cause a measurable effect on [[path loss]], exclusive of [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] effects. An obstruction may lie to the side, above, or below the path. Ridges, bridges, cliffs, buildings, and trees are examples of obstructions. If the clearance from the nearest anticipated path position, over the expected range of Earth radius [[Line-of-sight propagation#Earth bulge and atmosphere effect|''k''-factor]], exceeds 0.6 of the first [[Fresnel zone]] radius, the feature is not normally considered an obstruction.

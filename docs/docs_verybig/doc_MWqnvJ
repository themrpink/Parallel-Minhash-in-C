The middle reaches of the Congo remained unexplored from either the east or west, until [[Henry Morton Stanley]]'s expedition of 1876–77.
At the time one of the last open questions of the [[exploration of Africa]] (or indeed of the [[Age of exploration|world]])
whether the Lualaba River fed the [[Nile]] (Livingstone's theory), the Congo&lt;ref&gt;Jeal, 2007 pp. 188–219.&lt;/ref&gt; or even the [[Niger River|Niger]].
Financed in 1874, [[Henry Morton Stanley's first trans-Africa exploration|Stanley's first trans-Africa exploration]]
started in [[Zanzibar]], and reached the Lualaba on October 17, 1876.
Overland he reached [[Nyangwe]], the centre of a lawless area containing cannibal tribes at which [[Tippu Tip]] based his trade in slaves. Stanley managed to hire a force from Tippu Tip, to guard him for the next {{convert|150|km|mi|sigfig=1}} or so, for 90 days. The party left Nyangwe overland through the dense Matimba forest. On November 19 they reached the Lualaba again. Since the going through the forest was so heavy, Tippu Tip turned around with his party on December 28, leaving Stanley on his own, with 143 people, including 8 children and 16 women. They had 23 canoes. His first encounter with a local tribe was with the cannibal Wenya. In total Stanley would report 32 unfriendly meetings on the river, some violent, even though he attempted to negotiate a peaceful thoroughfare. But the tribes were wary as their only experience of outsiders was of slave traders.

On January 6, 1877, after {{convert|400|mi|km|order=flip}}, they reached [[Boyoma Falls]] (called Stanley Falls for some time after), consisting of seven cataracts spanning {{convert|60|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} which they had to bypass overland. It took them to February 7 to reach the end of the falls. Here Stanley learned that the river was called ''Ikuta Yacongo'',&lt;ref&gt;Jeal, 2007 p. 199; February 7, 1877&lt;/ref&gt; proving to him that he had reached the Congo, and that the Lualaba did not feed the Nile.

From this point, the tribes were no longer cannibals{{what?|date=May 2020}}, but possessed firearms, apparently as a result of Portuguese influence{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}. Some four weeks and {{convert|1200|mi|km|order=flip}} later he reached Stanley Pool (now [[Pool Malebo]]), the site of the present day cities [[Kinshasa]] and [[Brazzaville]]. Further downstream were the [[Livingstone Falls]], misnamed as Livingstone had never been on the Congo: a series of 32 falls and rapids with a fall of {{convert|900|ft|m|order=flip}} over {{convert|220|mi|km|order=flip}}.
On 15 March they started the descent of the falls, which took five months and cost numerous lives. From the Isangile Falls, five falls from the foot, they beached the canoes and ''Lady Alice'' and left the river, aiming for the Portuguese outpost of [[Boma, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Boma]] via land. On August 3 they reached the hamlet Nsada. From there Stanley sent four men with letters forward to Boma, asking for food for his starving people. On August 7 relief came, being sent by representatives from the [[Liverpool]] trading firm Hatton &amp; Cookson. On August 9 they reached Boma, 1,001 days since leaving Zanzibar on November 12, 1874. The party then consisted of 108 people, including three children born during the trip. Most probably (Stanley's own publications give inconsistent figures), he lost 132 people through disease, hunger, drowning, killing and desertion.&lt;ref&gt;Jeal, 2007 p. 217. {{cite book | title=Through the Dark Continent| last=Stanley| first=Henry M.| year=1988| pages=432 pages| publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-25667-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kinshasa]] was founded as a trading post by [[Henry Morton Stanley|Stanley]] in 1881 and named [[Léopoldville]] in honour of [[Leopold II of Belgium]]. The Congo basin was claimed by Leopold II as [[Congo Free State]] in 1885.

The [[Congo basin|Congo river basin]] is notable for the lack of [[bridge]]s [[List of crossings of the Congo River|crossing]] the main rivers, although there are a number of ferries available for crossing the Congo river and the major [[tributary|tributaries]]. The main reasoning is the mere width of the Congo river and main rivers, and the second is the lack of funds to set up permanent river crossings.

===Bridges on the Congo proper and Lualaba===
There are only two bridges on the Congo river proper and main [[tributary|tributaries]], which both are found in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo|DR Congo]]:
* The [[Matadi Bridge]], 148 km from the [[rivermouth]], at the port of [[Matadi]] in the [[Kongo Central]] province.

===Bridges on the Uele and Kibali rivers ===
There is one bridge on the [[Uele River]], and two on the [[Kibali River]], which all lies in the northern province [[Haut-Uele]] of [[Democratic Republic of Congo|DR Congo]]:

* The [[Dungu Bridge]] on the Kibali, some 2,050 km along the tributary from the rivermouth, near the town [[Dungu, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Dungu]], at the [[confluence]] of [[Dungu River, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Dungu]] and  [[Kibali River|Kibali rivers]], where the [[Uele River|Uele river]] is formed.
* The [[Kalimva Bridge]] on the Kibali, some 2,250 km along the tributary from the rivermouth, near the town [[Kalimva, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Kalimva]].

===Bridges on the Lulua river===
There are at least four bridges on the [[Lulua River]] in the province of [[Kasai Province|Kasai]] of [[Democratic Republic of Congo|DR Congo]]:
* Between the towns of [[Luebo]] and [[Tshimpumpu]].
* Near the town of [[Kananga]].
* At the town of [[Sanduwa]].
* West of the town of [[Diongo]] (also the location of a railway bridge on the [[Benguela Railway]]).

===Bridges on the Kwango river===
There is at least one bridge on the [[Kwango river]] in the province of [[Kwango Province|Kwango]] of [[Democratic Republic of Congo|DR Congo]]:

[[Image:Wiens law.svg|thumb|upright=1.45|[[Black-body radiation]] as a function of wavelength for various temperatures. Each temperature curve peaks at a different wavelength and Wien's law describes the shift of that peak.]]

'''Wien's displacement law''' states that the [[black-body radiation]] curve for different temperatures will peak at different [[wavelengths]] that are inversely proportional to the temperature. The shift of that peak is a direct consequence of the [[Planck's law|Planck radiation law]], which describes the spectral brightness of black-body radiation as a function of wavelength at any given temperature. However, it had been discovered by [[Wilhelm Wien]] several years before [[Max Planck]] developed that more general equation, and describes the entire shift of the spectrum of black-body radiation toward shorter wavelengths as temperature increases.

Formally, Wien's displacement law states that the [[Radiant flux#units|spectral radiance]] of black-body radiation per unit wavelength, peaks at the wavelength ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;peak&lt;/sub&gt; given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_\text{peak} = \frac{b}{T}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''T'' is the absolute temperature. ''b'' is a [[proportionality constant|constant of proportionality]] called ''Wien's displacement constant'', equal to {{physconst|bwien|after=,}} or {{nowrap|''b'' ≈ 2898 μm⋅K}}. This is an inverse relationship between wavelength and temperature. So the higher the temperature, the shorter or smaller the wavelength of the thermal radiation. The lower the temperature, the longer or larger the wavelength of the thermal radiation. For visible radiation, hot objects emit bluer light than cool objects. If one is considering the peak of black body emission per unit frequency or per proportional bandwidth, one must use a different proportionality constant. However, the form of the law remains the same: the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature, and the peak frequency is directly proportional to temperature.

Wien's displacement law may be referred to as &quot;Wien's law&quot;, a term which is also used for the [[Wien approximation]].

==Examples==
Wien's displacement law is relevant to some everyday experiences:

*A piece of metal heated by a [[blow torch]] first becomes &quot;red hot&quot; as the very longest [[visible wavelength]]s appear red, then becomes more orange-red as the temperature is increased, and at very high temperatures would be described as &quot;white hot&quot; as shorter and shorter wavelengths come to predominate the black body emission spectrum. Before it had even reached the red hot temperature, the thermal emission was mainly at longer [[infrared]] wavelengths, which are not visible; nevertheless, that radiation could be felt as it warms one's nearby skin.
*One easily observes changes in the color of an [[incandescent light bulb]] (which produces light through thermal radiation) as the temperature of its filament is varied by a [[light dimmer]]. As the light is dimmed and the filament temperature decreases, the distribution of color shifts toward longer wavelengths and the light appears redder, as well as dimmer.
*A wood fire at 1500&amp;nbsp;K puts out peak radiation at about 2000&amp;nbsp;nm. 98% of its radiation is at wavelengths longer than 1000&amp;nbsp;nm, and only a tiny proportion at [[Visible spectrum|visible wavelengths]] (390–700&amp;nbsp;nm). Consequently, a campfire can keep one warm but is a poor source of visible light.
*The effective temperature of the [[Sun]] is 5778&amp;nbsp;K. Using Wien's law, one finds a peak emission per nanometer (of wavelength) at a wavelength of about 500&amp;nbsp;nm, in the green portion of the spectrum near the peak sensitivity of the human eye.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, J. Fundamentals of Physics, 8th ed., John Wiley and Sons, 2008, p. 891. {{ISBN|9780471758013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feynman, R; Leighton, R; Sands, M. The Feynman Lectures on Physics, vol. 1, pp. 35-2 – 35-3. {{ISBN|0201510030}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in terms of power per unit optical frequency, the Sun's peak emission is at 343&amp;nbsp;THz or a wavelength of 883&amp;nbsp;nm in the near infrared. In terms of power per percentage bandwidth, the peak is at about 635&amp;nbsp;nm, a red wavelength. Regardless of how one wants to plot the spectrum, about half of the sun's radiation is at wavelengths shorter than 710&amp;nbsp;nm, about the limit of the human vision. Of that, about 12% is at wavelengths shorter than 400&amp;nbsp;nm, ultraviolet wavelengths, which is invisible to an unaided human eye. It can be appreciated that a rather large amount of the Sun's radiation falls in the fairly small [[visible spectrum]].

[[File:Orion 3008 huge.jpg|thumb|upright|The color of a star is determined by its temperature, according to Wien's law. In the constellation of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], one can compare [[Betelgeuse]] (''T''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;3300&amp;nbsp;K, upper left), [[Rigel]] (''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;12100&amp;nbsp;K, bottom right), [[Bellatrix]] (''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;22000&amp;nbsp;K, upper right), and [[Mintaka]] (''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;31800&amp;nbsp;K, rightmost of the 3 &quot;belt stars&quot; in the middle).]]
*The preponderance of emission in the visible range, however, is not the case in most [[stars]]. The hot supergiant [[Rigel]] emits 60% of its light in the ultraviolet, while the cool supergiant [[Betelgeuse]] emits 85% of its light at infrared wavelengths. With both stars prominent in the constellation of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], one can easily appreciate the color difference between the blue-white Rigel (''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;12100&amp;nbsp;K) and the red Betelgeuse (''T''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;3300&amp;nbsp;K). While few stars are as hot as Rigel, stars cooler than the sun or even as cool as Betelgeuse are very commonplace.
*[[Mammals]] with a skin temperature of about 300&amp;nbsp;K emit peak radiation at around 10&amp;nbsp;μm in the far infrared. This is therefore the range of infrared wavelengths that [[pit viper]] snakes and [[Thermographic camera|passive IR cameras]] must sense.
*When comparing the apparent color of lighting sources (including [[fluorescent lights]], [[LED lighting]], [[computer monitor]]s, and [[photoflash]]), it is customary to cite the [[color temperature]]. Although the spectra of such lights are not accurately described by the black-body radiation curve, a color temperature is quoted for which black-body radiation would most closely match the subjective color of that source. For instance, the blue-white fluorescent light sometimes used in an office may have a color temperature of 6500&amp;nbsp;K, whereas the reddish tint of a dimmed incandescent light may have a color temperature (and an actual filament temperature) of 2000&amp;nbsp;K. Note that the informal description of the former (bluish) color as &quot;cool&quot; and the latter (reddish) as &quot;warm&quot; is exactly opposite the actual temperature change involved in black-body radiation.

==Discovery==
The law is named for [[Wilhelm Wien]], who derived it in 1893 based on a thermodynamic argument.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wien considered [[adiabatic]] expansion of a cavity containing waves of light in thermal equilibrium. He showed that, under slow expansion or contraction, the energy of light reflecting off the walls changes in exactly the same way as the frequency. A general principle of thermodynamics is that a thermal equilibrium state, when expanded very slowly, stays in thermal equilibrium. 

Wien himself deduced this law theoretically in 1893, following Boltzmann’s thermodynamic reasoning. It had previously been observed, at least semi-quantitatively, by an American astronomer, Langley. This upward shift in νmax with T is familiar to everyone—when an iron is heated in a fire, the first visible radiation (at around 900 K) is deep red, the lowest frequency visible light. Further increase in T causes the color to change to orange then yellow, and finally blue at very high temperatures (10,000 K or more) for which the peak in radiation intensity has moved beyond the visible into the ultraviolet.&lt;ref&gt;https://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/Pacific_Union_College/Quantum_Chemistry/01%3A_The_Dawn_of_the_Quantum_Theory/1.01%3A_Blackbody_Radiation_Cannot_Be_Explained_Classically&lt;/ref&gt;


The adiabatic principle allowed Wien to conclude that for each mode, the adiabatic invariant energy/frequency is only a function of the other adiabatic invariant, the frequency/temperature. A modern variant of Wien's derivation can be found in the textbook by Wannier&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The consequence is that the shape of the black-body radiation function (which was not yet understood) would shift proportionally in frequency (or inversely proportionally in wavelength) with temperature. When [[Max Planck]] later formulated the correct [[Planck's law|black-body radiation function]] it did not explicitly include Wien's constant ''b''. Rather, [[Planck's constant]] ''h'' was created and introduced into his new formula. From Planck's constant ''h'' and the [[Boltzmann constant]] ''k'', Wien's constant ''b'' can be obtained.

==Frequency-dependent formulation==
For spectral flux considered per unit [[frequency]] &lt;math&gt;d\nu&lt;/math&gt; (in [[hertz]]), Wien's displacement law describes a peak emission at the optical frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu_\text{peak}&lt;/math&gt; given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\nu_\text{peak} = { \alpha \over h} kT  \approx  (5.879 \times 10^{10} \ \mathrm{Hz/K}) \cdot T  &lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently

:&lt;math&gt;h \nu_\text{peak} = \alpha k T \approx  (2.431 \times 10^{-4} \ \mathrm{eV/K}) \cdot T  &lt;/math&gt;

where {{nowrap|''α'' ≈ 2.8214391...}} is a constant resulting from the numerical solution of the maximization equation, ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]], ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]], and ''T'' is the temperature (in [[kelvin]]s). With the emission now considered per unit frequency, this peak now corresponds to a wavelength 70% longer than the peak considered per unit wavelength. The relevant math is detailed in the next section.

==Derivation from Planck's law==
{{unsourced|section|date=October 2019}}
[[Planck's law]] for the spectrum of black body radiation predicts the Wien displacement law and may be used to numerically evaluate the constant relating temperature and the peak parameter value for any particular parameterization. Commonly a wavelength parameterization is used and in that case the black body spectral radiance (power per emitting area per solid angle) is:

:&lt;math&gt;u_{\lambda}(\lambda,T) = {2 h c^2\over \lambda^5}{1\over e^{h c/\lambda kT}-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating ''u''(λ,''T'') with respect to λ and setting the derivative equal to zero gives:
:&lt;math&gt;{ \partial u \over \partial \lambda } = 2 h c^2\left( {hc\over kT \lambda^7}{e^{h c/\lambda kT}\over \left(e^{h c/\lambda kT}-1\right)^2} - {1\over\lambda^6}{5\over e^{h c/\lambda kT}-1}\right)=0,&lt;/math&gt;
which can be simplified to give:
:&lt;math&gt;{hc\over\lambda kT }{e^{h c/\lambda kT}\over e^{h c/\lambda kT} -1} - 5 = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

By defining:
:&lt;math&gt;x\equiv{hc\over\lambda kT },&lt;/math&gt;
the equation becomes one in the single variable ''x'':
:&lt;math&gt;{x e^x \over e^x - 1}-5=0.&lt;/math&gt;
which is equivalent to:
:&lt;math&gt;(x-5) e^x +5=0.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is easily numerically solved using [[Newton's method]] yielding {{refn|group=note|The equation &lt;math&gt;x e^x /(e^x - 1) = n&lt;/math&gt; cannot be solved in terms of elementary functions. It can be solved in terms of [[Lambert W function|Lambert's product log function]] as &lt;math&gt;x = n+W(-ne^{-n})&lt;/math&gt;, but the exact solution is not important in this derivation.}} ''x'' = 4.965114231744276 to double precision floating point accuracy.  Solving for the wavelength ''λ'' in milimetres, and using kelvins for the temperature yields:

::&lt;math&gt;\lambda_\text{peak} = \frac{hc}{x}\frac{1}{kT} = \frac{2.897771955185172 \text{mm}{\cdot}\text{K}}{T}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1119/1.1466547|doi = 10.1119/1.1466547|title = Obtaining Wien's displacement law from Planck's law of radiation|year = 2002|last1 = Das|first1 = Biman|journal = The Physics Teacher|volume = 40|issue = 3|pages = 148–149|bibcode = 2002PhTea..40..148D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parameterization by frequency===
Another common parameterization is by ''frequency''. The derivation yielding peak parameter value is similar, but starts with the form of [[Planck's law]] as a function of frequency ν:

:&lt;math&gt;u_{\nu}(\nu,T) = {2 h \nu^3\over c^2}{1\over e^{h \nu/ kT}-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

The preceding process using this equation yields:
:&lt;math&gt;-{h\nu\over kT }{e^{h\nu / kT}\over e^{h \nu /kT} -1} + 3 = 0. &lt;/math&gt;
The net result is:
:&lt;math&gt;(x-3) e^x +3=0.&lt;/math&gt;
This is similarly solved with [[Newton's method]] yielding {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 2.8214393721220787}} to double precision floating point accuracy. Solving for ''ν'' produces:
::&lt;math&gt;\nu_\text{peak} = \frac{xk}{h}T = ({0.05878923811360855 ~\text{THz}{\cdot}\text{K}^{-1}}) \cdot {T}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Maxima differ according to parameterization===
Notice that for a given temperature, parameterization by frequency implies a different maximal wavelength than parameterization by wavelength.

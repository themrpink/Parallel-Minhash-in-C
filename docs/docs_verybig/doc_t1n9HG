Like other members of the Commonwealth, a [[justice of the peace#Canada|justice of the peace]] is addressed as &quot;Your Worship,&quot; and a [[Master (judiciary)#Canada|Master of a Superior Court]] is referred to as “Master”. As of December 7, 2018, Ontario Court Masters are addressed in English as “Your Honour” and in French as “Votre Honneur” and no longer as “Master”.

In many [[U.S. state|states]] throughout the [[United States]], a judge is addressed as &quot;Your Honor&quot; or &quot;Judge&quot; when presiding over the court. &quot;Judge&quot; may be more commonly used by attorneys and staff, while either may be commonly used by the plaintiff or defendant. Notably, the [[Superior Court of Los Angeles County]], the largest unified trial court in the United States, has a rule that the judge shall be addressed only as &quot;Your Honor&quot; while in court, and never as &quot;Judge,&quot; &quot;Judge (name),&quot; &quot;ma'am,&quot; or &quot;sir.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rule 3.95, Los Angeles Superior Court Rules.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is somewhat unusual as &quot;Judge&quot; and &quot;Judge (name)&quot; or similar forms of address are considered appropriate and respectful in many other courts.

The judges of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], and the judges of the [[state supreme court|supreme courts]] of several [[US states]] and other countries are called &quot;justices&quot;.  Justices of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] and Justices of other courts are addressed as &quot;Justice (name).&quot; The Chief Justice of the United States is formally addressed as &quot;Mr. or Madam Chief Justice&quot; but also may be identified and addressed as &quot;Chief Justice (name)&quot;.

The justices of the supreme courts usually hold higher offices than any other judges in a jurisdiction, including a [[justice of the peace]], a judge who holds police court in some [[jurisdiction]]s and who may also try [[small claims court|small claims]] and [[misdemeanor]]s. However, the [[New York judiciary|State of New York]] inverts this usual order. The initial trial court in this state is called the Supreme Court of New York, and its judges are called &quot;justices&quot;.  The next highest appellate court is the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, whose judges are also called &quot;justices&quot;.  However, the highest court in New York is called the New York Court of Appeals, whose members are called &quot;judges&quot;.

Judges in certain jurisdictions, such as New York and New Jersey, who deal with guardianships, trusts and estates are known as &quot;[[Surrogate Court|surrogate]]s.&quot;

A ''[[senior status|senior judge]],'' in US practice, is a retired judge who handles selected cases for a governmental entity while in retirement, on a [[Part-time job|part-time]] basis.

Subordinate or inferior jurisdiction judges in US legal practice are sometimes called [[magistrate]]s, although in the federal court of the United States, they are called [[United States magistrate judge|magistrate judges]]. Subordinate judges in US legal practice who are appointed on a case-by-case basis, particularly in cases where a great deal of detailed and tedious evidence must be reviewed, are often called &quot;masters&quot; or &quot;special masters&quot; and have authority in a particular case often determined on a case by case basis.

Judges of courts of specialized jurisdiction (such as [[bankruptcy court]]s or [[juvenile court]]s) were sometimes known officially as &quot;[[referee]]s,&quot; but the use of this title is in decline. Judges sitting in courts of equity in [[common law]] systems (such as judges in the equity courts of [[Delaware]]) are called &quot;[[chancellor]]s.&quot;

Individuals with judicial responsibilities who report to an executive branch official, rather than being a part of the judiciary, are often called &quot;[[administrative law judge]]s&quot; in US practice. They were previously known as hearing examiners. They commonly make initial determinations regarding matters such as [[workers' compensation]], eligibility for government benefits, regulatory matters, and immigration determinations.

Judges who derive their authority from a contractual agreement of the parties to a dispute, rather than a governmental body, are called [[arbitrator]]s. They typically do not receive the honorific forms of address nor do they bear the symbolic trappings of a publicly appointed judge. However, it is now common for many retired judges to serve as arbitrators, and they will often write their names as if they were still judges, with the parenthetical &quot;(Ret.)&quot; for &quot;Retired.&quot;

Unlike many civil law countries which have some courts on which panels of judges with nearly equal status composed of both legally trained professional judges and lay judges who lack legal training and are not career judges, the United States legal system (like most Anglo-American legal systems) makes a clear distinction between professional judges and laypeople involved in deciding a case who are jurors who are part of a [[jury]]. Most but not all US judges have professional credentials as lawyers. Non-lawyer judges in the United States are often elected, and are typically either justices of the peace or part-time judges in rural limited jurisdiction [[courts]]. A non-lawyer judge typically has the same rights and responsibilities as a lawyer who is a judge holding the same office and is addressed in the same manner.

[[File:Susan Kiefel 2011.jpg|thumb|[[Susan Kiefel]], Chief Justice of Australia]]
In [[Australia]] judges and, since 2007, magistrates, of all jurisdictions including the [[High Court of Australia]] are now addressed as &quot;Your Honour&quot;. In legal contexts, they are referred to as &quot;His/Her Honour&quot; and &quot;the Honourable Justice Surname&quot; (for judges of superior courts) or &quot;his/her Honour Judge Surname&quot; (for inferior courts). Outside legal contexts, the formal terms of address are &quot;Judge&quot; (for puisne justices) or &quot;Chief Justice&quot; (for chief justices).

The title for most puisne judges is &quot;Justice&quot;, which is abbreviated in law reports to a postnominal &quot;J&quot;, in the form &quot;Surname J&quot;. Chief Justices of the High Court and of state Supreme Courts are titled &quot;Chief Justice&quot;, which is abbreviated in law reports to a postnomial &quot;CJ&quot;. Judges in State Supreme Courts with a separate Court of Appeal division (New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia) are referred to as Justices/Judges of the Appeal (abbreviated &quot;Surname JA&quot;), while the President of the Court of Appeal is referred to as &quot;President&quot; (abbreviated &quot;Surname P&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;New South Wales Supreme Court, [http://www.supremecourt.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/supremecourt/judicialcontacts/addressing_judicial_officers.html Addressing Judicial Officers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818100909/http://www.supremecourt.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/supremecourt/judicialcontacts/addressing_judicial_officers.html |date=2013-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biblical and Israeli judges ==
The Biblical [[Book of Judges]] revolves around a succession of leaders who were known as [[Biblical judges|&quot;judges&quot;]] ([[Hebrew]] shoftim שופטים) but who – aside from their judicial function – were also tribal war leaders. The same word is, however, used in contemporary [[Israel]] to denote judges whose function and authority is similar to that in other modern countries. The same word is also used in modern Hebrew for [[referee]]s in any kind of contest and in particular in sport. To distinguish them from judicial judges and from each other, the kind of the contest is added after the word &quot;shofet&quot; in the [[Construct state]] (e.g. &quot;shofet kaduregel&quot; שופט כדורגל, literally &quot;judge of soccer&quot;).

[[File:Jury box cropped.jpg|thumb|An empty jury box at an American courtroom in [[Pershing County, Nevada]]]]

A '''jury''' is a sworn body of people (the '''jurors''') convened to render an [[impartiality|impartial]] [[verdict]] (a [[Question of fact|finding of fact]] on a question) officially submitted to them by a [[court]], or to set a [[sentence (law)|penalty]] or [[Judgment (law)|judgment]]. Juries developed in [[England]] during the Middle Ages, and are a hallmark of the [[Common law|Anglo common law]] legal system. They are still commonly used today in [[Great Britain]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and other countries whose legal systems are descended from England's legal traditions. 

Most trial juries are &quot;petit juries&quot;, and usually consist of twelve people. A larger jury known as a [[grand jury]] was used to investigate potential crimes and render indictments against suspects, but all common law countries except the United States and [[Liberia]] have phased these out. The modern criminal court jury arrangement has evolved out of the medieval juries in England. Members were supposed to inform themselves of crimes and then of the details of the crimes. Their function was therefore closer to that of a grand jury than that of a [[trial by jury|jury in a trial]].

==Etymology==
The word ''jury'' derives from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] ''juré'' (&quot;sworn&quot;). Juries are most common in [[common law]] [[Adversarial system|adversarial-system]] [[jurisdiction]]s. In the modern system, juries act as [[Trier of fact|triers of fact]], while judges act as triers of law (but see [[#Jury nullification|nullification]]). A trial without a jury (in which both questions of fact and [[Question of law|questions of law]] are decided by a judge) is known as a [[bench trial]].

==Types of jury==

===Petit jury===
{{main|Petit jury}}
The &quot;petit jury&quot; (or &quot;trial jury&quot;, sometimes &quot;petty jury&quot;) hears the [[evidence]] in a [[trial]] as presented by both the [[plaintiff]] (petitioner) and the [[defendant]] (respondent). After hearing the evidence and often [[jury instructions]] from the [[judge]], the group retires for [[deliberation]], to consider a verdict. The majority required for a verdict varies. In some cases it must be unanimous, while in other jurisdictions it may be a majority or [[supermajority]]. A jury that is unable to come to a verdict is referred to as a [[hung jury]]. The size of the jury varies; in [[Criminal law|criminal cases]] involving serious felonies there are usually 12 jurors.

In [[Civil law (common law)|civil cases]] many trials require fewer than twelve jurors.

===Grand jury===
{{main|Grand jury}}
A grand jury, a type of jury now confined almost exclusively to federal courts and some state jurisdictions in the United States, determines whether there is enough evidence for a [[Criminal procedure|criminal trial]] to go forward. Grand juries carry out this duty by examining evidence presented to them by a [[prosecutor]] and issuing [[indictment]]s, or by investigating alleged [[crime]]s and issuing [[Wiktionary:presentment|presentments]]. A grand jury is traditionally larger than and distinguishable from the petit jury used during a trial, usually with 12 jurors. It is not required that a suspect be notified of grand jury proceedings.  Grand juries can also be used for filing charges in the form of a [[sealed indictment]] against unaware suspects who are arrested later by a surprise police visit.

In addition to their primary role in screening criminal prosecutions and assisting in the investigation of crimes, grand juries in California, Florida,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamisao.com/publications/grandjuryreports.htm |title=CURRENT GRAND JURY REPORTS – Miami Dade Office of the State Attorney |publisher=Miamisao.com |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some other U.S. states are sometimes utilized to perform an investigative and policy audit function similar to that filled by the [[Government Accountability Office]] in the United States federal government and legislative state auditors in many U.S. states.

===Coroner's jury===
{{main|Coroner's jury}}
A third kind of jury, known as a coroner's jury can be convened in some common law jurisdiction in connection with an [[inquest]] by a [[coroner]].  A coroner is a public official (often an elected local government official in the United States), who is charged with determining the circumstances leading to a death in ambiguous or suspicious cases.  A coroner's jury is generally a body that a coroner can convene on an optional basis in order to increase public confidence in the coroner's finding where there might otherwise be a controversy.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Section 1245.1 of Pennsylvania's codified laws regarding coroners. http://www.pacoroners.org/Laws.php&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice, coroner's juries are most often convened in order to avoid the appearance of impropriety by one governmental official in the criminal justice system toward another if no charges are filed against the person causing the death, when a governmental party such as a law enforcement officer is involved in the death.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Inquest Schedule, Jury Findings and Vedicts (2013) of British Columbia. http://www.pssg.gov.bc.ca/coroners/schedule/index.htm (retrieved March 8, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
Serving on a jury is normally compulsory for individuals who are qualified for jury service. A jury is intended to be an impartial panel capable of reaching a verdict. Procedures and requirements may include a fluent understanding of the language and the opportunity to test jurors' neutrality or otherwise exclude jurors who are perceived as likely to be less than neutral or partial to one side. Juries are initially chosen randomly, usually from the eligible population of adult citizens residing in the court's jurisdictional area. [[Jury selection]] in the United States usually includes organized questioning of the prospective jurors (jury pool) by the lawyers for the plaintiff and the defendant and by the judge—[[voir dire]]—as well as rejecting some jurors because of bias or inability to properly serve (&quot;challenge for cause&quot;), and the discretionary right of each side to reject a specified number of jurors without having to prove a proper cause for the rejection (&quot;peremptory challenge&quot;), before the jury is [[wikt:impanel|impaneled]].

A head juror is called the &quot;foreperson&quot;, &quot;foreman&quot; or &quot;presiding juror&quot;. The foreperson may be chosen before the trial begins, or at the beginning of the jury's deliberations. The foreperson may be selected by the judge or by vote of the jurors, depending on the jurisdiction. The foreperson's role may include asking questions (usually to the judge) on behalf of the jury, [[Facilitator|facilitating]] jury discussions, and announcing the verdict of the jury.

Since there is always the possibility of jurors not completing a trial for health or other reasons, often one or more alternate jurors are selected. Alternates are present for the entire trial but do not take part in deliberating the case and deciding the verdict unless one or more of the impaneled jurors are removed from the jury.  In Connecticut, alternate jurors are dismissed before the panel of sworn jurors begin deliberation.  Connecticut General Statutes 51–243(e) and 54-82h do not allow alternate jurors to be segregated from the regular sworn jurors. In civil cases in Connecticut, C.G.S. 51–243(e) provides that alternate jurors &quot;shall be dismissed.&quot; This differs from the power given to the court in criminal trials under C.G.S. 54-82h, permitting the court not to dismiss the alternate jurors, and to have the regular jury panel begin deliberations.

When an insufficient number of summoned jurors appear in court to handle a matter, the law in many jurisdictions empowers the jury commissioner or other official convening the jury to involuntarily impress bystanders in the vicinity of the place where the jury is to be convened to serve on the jury.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Sections 13-71-112 and 30-10-607, Colorado Revised Statutes&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical roots==
[[File:The Jury by John Morgan.jpg|thumb|''The Jury'', an 1861 painting of a British jury]]

The modern jury evolved out of the ancient custom of many ancient [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes whereby a group of men of good character was used to investigate crimes and judge the accused. The same custom evolved into the [[vehmic court]] system in medieval Germany. In Anglo-Saxon England, juries investigated crimes. After the [[Norman Conquest]], some parts of the country preserved juries as the means of investigating crimes. The use of ordinary members of the community to consider crimes was unusual in ancient cultures, but was nonetheless also found in ancient Greece.

The modern [[jury trial]] evolved out of this custom in the mid-12th century during the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]].&lt;ref&gt;W.L. Warren, &quot;Henry II&quot; University of California Press,(1973)&lt;/ref&gt;  Juries, usually 6 or 12 men, were an &quot;ancient institution&quot; even then in some parts of England, at the same time as Members consisted of representatives of the basic units of local government—[[hundred (county subdivision)|hundred]]s (an administrative sub-division of the [[shire]], embracing several vills) and villages. Called juries of presentment, these men testified under oath to crimes committed in their neighbourhood.  The [[Assize of Clarendon]] in 1166 caused these juries to be adopted systematically throughout the country.  The jury in this period was &quot;self-informing,&quot; meaning it heard very little evidence or testimony in court. Instead, jurors were recruited from the locality of the dispute and were expected to know the facts before coming to court.  The source of juror knowledge could include first-hand knowledge, investigation, and less reliable sources such as rumour and hearsay.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Klerman, [http://lawweb.usc.edu/users/dklerman/documents/Klerman.Self-informing.pdf &quot;Was the Jury Every Self-Informing&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719013900/http://lawweb.usc.edu/users/dklerman/documents/Klerman.Self-informing.pdf |date=2011-07-19 }} Southern California Law Review 77: (2003), 123.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Between 1166 and 1179 new procedures including a division of functions between the sheriff, the jury of local men, and the royal justices ushered in the era of the [[English Common Law]].  Sheriffs prepared cases for trial and found jurors with relevant knowledge and testimony.  Jurors 'found' a verdict by witnessing as to fact, even assessing and applying information from their own and community memory—little was written at this time and what was, such as deeds and writs, were subject to fraud.  Royal justices supervised trials, answered questions as to law, and announced the court's decision which was then subject to appeal.  Sheriffs executed the decision of the court. These procedures enabled Henry II to delegate authority without endowing his subordinates with too much power. (&quot;Henry II&quot; 293)

In 1215 the [[Catholic Church]] removed its sanction from all forms of the ordeal—procedures by which suspects up to that time were 'tested' as to guilt (e.g., in the ordeal of hot metal, molten metal was sometimes poured into a suspected thief's hand.  If the wound healed rapidly and well, it was believed God found the suspect innocent, and if not then the suspect was found guilty).  With trial by ordeal banned, establishing guilt would have been problematic had England not had forty years of judicial experience.  Justices were by then accustomed to asking jurors of presentment about points of fact in assessing indictments; it was a short step to ask jurors if they concluded the accused was guilty as charged. (&quot;Henry II&quot; 358)

An early reference to a jury type group in England is in a decree issued by Aethelred at Wantage (997), which provided that in every Hundred &quot;the twelve leading [[thegn]]s together with the [[Reeve (England)|reeve]] shall go out and swear on the [[relic]]s which are given into their hands, that they will not accuse any innocent man nor shield a guilty one.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Oxford History of England, 2nd ed 1955, vol III Domesday Book to Magna Carta, A l Poole, pp.397–398.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting [[Æthelred the Unready#Origin of the jury|Wantage Code]] formally recognized legal customs that were part of the [[Danelaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wantage.com/museum/Local_History/Wantage%20Church%20History.pdf|title=Wantage Church History|last=Garnish|first=Lis|year=1995|work=Local History Series|publisher=[[Vale and Downland Museum]]|accessdate=2009-09-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925045004/http://www.wantage.com/museum/Local_History/Wantage%20Church%20History.pdf|archive-date=2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The testimonial concept can also be traced to [[Normandy]] before 1066 when a jury of nobles was established to decide land disputes. In this manner, the Duke, being the largest land owner, could not act as a judge in his own case.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, discussions of the Brunner theory of testimonial, rather than judicial participation as jury origin, explored in MacNair, [http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/17.3/macnair.html ''Vicinage and the Antecedents of the Jury – I. Theories''], in Law and History Review, Vol. 17 No 3, 1999, pp. 6–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest antecedents of modern jury systems is the jury in [[ancient Greece]], including the [[Polis|city-state]] of [[Athens]], where records of jury courts date back to 500 [[BCE]]. These juries voted by [[secret ballot]] and were eventually granted the power to annul [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] laws, thus introducing the practice of [[judicial review]]. In modern justice systems, the law is considered &quot;self-contained&quot; and &quot;distinct from other coercive forces, and perceived as separate from the political life of the community,&quot; but &quot;all these barriers are absent in the context of classical Athens. In practice and in conception the law and its administration are in some important respects indistinguishable from the life of the community in general.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carey, Christopher. &quot;Legal Space in Classical Athens.&quot; ''Greece &amp; Rome'' 41(2): October 1994, pp. 172–186.&lt;/ref&gt;

In juries of the [[Justice in Eyre|Justices in Eyre]], the [[bailiff]] of the hundred would choose 4 electors who in turn chose 12 others from their hundred, and from these were selected 12 jurors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= A History of English Law | volume= 1 | first= William Searle | last= Holdsworth | author-link= William Searle Holdsworth | pages= 268–269 | year= 1922 | publisher= [[Little, Brown and Company|Little, Brown]] | edition= 3 | oclc= 48555551 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DQF-ASQE7xAC&amp;pg=PA268 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century England===
In 1730, the British Parliament passed the Bill for Better Regulation of Juries.&lt;ref&gt;Dowlen, Oliver. Sorted: Civic Lotteries and the Future of Public Participation. (MASS LBP: Toronto, 2008) pp 38&lt;/ref&gt; The Act stipulated that the list of all those liable for jury service was to be posted in each parish and that jury panels would be selected by lot, also known as [[sortition]], from these lists. Its aim was to prevent middle-class citizens from evading their responsibilities by financially putting into question the neutrality of the under-sheriff, the official entrusted with impaneling juries.

Prior to the Act, the main means of ensuring impartiality was by allowing legal challenges to the sheriff's choices. The new provisions did not specifically aim at establishing impartiality but had the effect of reinforcing the authority of the jury by guaranteeing impartiality at the point of selection.

The example of early 18th century England legal reform shows how civic lotteries can be used to organize the duties and responsibilities of the citizen body in relation to the state. It established the impartiality and neutrality of juries as well as reiterating the dual nature of the citizen-state relationship. The need for a leader/organizer in a jury is very important, in order to get a proper and agreed verdict.

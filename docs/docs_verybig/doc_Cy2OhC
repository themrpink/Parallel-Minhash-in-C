[[File:金饼 海昏侯国遗址.JPG|thumb|Gold Coins of the Eastern Han dynasty]]

The Han dynasty inherited the ''[[Ancient Chinese coinage#Ban Liang coins|ban liang]]'' coin type from the Qin. In the beginning of the Han, Emperor Gaozu closed the [[Mint (coin)|government mint]] in favor of private minting of coins. This decision was reversed in 186 BC by his widow [[Empress Lü Zhi|Grand Empress Dowager Lü Zhi]] (d. 180 BC), who abolished private minting.{{sfnp|Nishijima|1986|p=586}} In 182 BC, Lü Zhi issued a bronze coin that was much lighter in weight than previous coins. This caused widespread [[inflation]] that was not reduced until 175 BC when Emperor Wen allowed private minters to manufacture coins that were precisely 2.6&amp;nbsp;g (0.09&amp;nbsp;oz) in weight.{{sfnp|Nishijima|1986|p=586}}

In 144 BC Emperor Jing abolished private minting in favor of central-government and commandery-level minting; he also introduced a new coin.{{sfnp|Nishijima|1986|pp=586–587}} Emperor Wu introduced another in 120 BC, but a year later he abandoned the ''ban liangs'' entirely in favor of the ''[[Ancient Chinese coinage#Western Han and the Wu Zhu coins|wuzhu]]'' (五銖) coin, weighing 3.2&amp;nbsp;g (0.11&amp;nbsp;oz).{{sfnp|Nishijima|1986|p=587}} The ''wuzhu'' became China's standard coin until the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907 AD). Its use was interrupted briefly by several new currencies introduced during Wang Mang's regime until it was reinstated in 40 AD by Emperor Guangwu.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ebrey|1986|p=609}}; {{harvp|Bielenstein|1986|pp=232–233}}; {{harvp|Nishijima|1986|pp=587–588}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since commandery-issued coins were often of inferior quality and lighter weight, the central government closed commandery mints and monopolized the issue of coinage in 113 BC. This Central government issuance of coinage was overseen by the [[Government of the Han dynasty#Superintendent of Waterways and Parks|Superintendent of Waterways and Parks]], this duty being transferred to the Minister of Finance during Eastern Han.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nishijima|1986|pp=587–588}}; {{harvp|Bielenstein|1980|pp=47, 83}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxation and property===

Aside from the landowner's [[Land value tax#History|land tax]] paid in a portion of their [[crop yield]], the [[Tax per head|poll tax]] and [[property tax]]es were paid in coin cash.{{sfnp|Nishijima|1986|pp=600–601}} The annual poll tax rate for adult men and women was 120 coins and 20 coins for minors. Merchants were required to pay a higher rate of 240 coins.{{sfnp|Nishijima|1986|p=598}} The poll tax stimulated a money economy that necessitated the minting of over 28,000,000,000 coins from 118 BC to 5 AD, an average of 220,000,000 coins a year.{{sfnp|Nishijima|1986|p=588}}

The widespread circulation of coin cash allowed successful merchants to invest money in land, empowering the very social class the government attempted to suppress through heavy commercial and property taxes.{{sfnp|Nishijima|1986|p=601}} Emperor Wu even enacted laws which banned registered merchants from owning land, yet powerful merchants were able to avoid registration and own large tracts of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nishijima|1986|p=577}}; {{harvp|Ch'ü|1972|pp=113–114}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The small landowner-cultivators formed the majority of the Han tax base; this revenue was threatened during the latter half of Eastern Han when many peasants fell into debt and were forced to work as farming tenants for wealthy [[landlord]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nishijima|1986|pp=558–601}}; {{harvp|Ebrey|1974|pp=173 174}}; {{harvp|Ebrey|1999|pp=74–75}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Han government enacted reforms in order to keep small landowner-cultivators out of debt and on their own farms. These reforms included reducing taxes, temporary remissions of taxes, granting loans and providing landless peasants temporary lodging and work in [[Tuntian|agricultural colonies]] until they could recover from their debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ebrey|1999|p=75}}; {{harvp|Ebrey|1986|pp=619–621}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 168 BC, the land tax rate was reduced from one-fifteenth of a farming household's crop yield to one-thirtieth,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Loewe|1986|pp=149–150}}; {{harvp|Nishijima|1986|pp=596–598}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and later to a one-hundredth of a crop yield for the last decades of the dynasty. The consequent loss of government revenue was compensated for by increasing property taxes.{{sfnp|Nishijima|1986|pp=596–598}}

The labor tax took the form of [[Conscription|conscripted labor]] for one month per year, which was imposed upon male commoners aged fifteen to fifty-six. This could be avoided in Eastern Han with a commutable tax, since hired labor became more popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nishijima|1986|p=599}}; {{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=564–565}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private manufacture and government monopolies===
[[File:Iron ji and knife, Han Dynasty.JPG|thumb|A Han-dynasty iron [[Ji (halberd)]] and [[Chinese swords|iron dagger]]]]

In the early Western Han, a wealthy salt or iron industrialist, whether a semi-autonomous king or wealthy merchant, could boast funds that rivaled the imperial [[treasury]] and amass a peasant workforce of over a thousand. This kept many peasants away from their farms and denied the government a significant portion of its land tax revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Needham|1986c|p=22}}; {{harvp|Nishijima|1986|pp=583–584}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To eliminate the influence of such private entrepreneurs, Emperor Wu nationalized the salt and iron industries in 117 BC and allowed many of the former industrialists to become officials administering the state monopolies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nishijima|1986|p=584}}; {{harvp|Wagner|2001|pp=1–2}}; {{harvp|Hinsch|2002|pp=21–22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By Eastern Han times, the central government monopolies were repealed in favor of production by commandery and county administrations, as well as private businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nishijima|1986|p=584}}; {{harvp|Wagner|2001|pp=15–17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Liquor]] was another profitable private industry nationalized by the central government in 98 BC. However, this was repealed in 81 BC and a property tax rate of two coins for every 0.2&amp;nbsp;L (0.05 gallons) was levied for those who traded it privately.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nishijima|1986|p=600}}; {{harvp|Wagner|2001|pp=13–14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By 110 BC Emperor Wu also interfered with the profitable trade in grain when he eliminated [[speculation]] by selling government-stored grain at a lower price than demanded by merchants.{{sfnp|Ebrey|1999|p=75}} Apart from Emperor Ming's creation of a short-lived Office for Price Adjustment and Stabilization, which was abolished in 68 AD, central-government price control regulations were largely absent during the Eastern Han.{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|p=605}}

The Han dynasty was a unique period in the development of premodern Chinese science and technology, comparable to the level of [[Technology of the Song dynasty|scientific and technological growth]] during the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jin|Fan|Liu|1996|pp=178–179}}; {{harvp|Needham|1972|p=111}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing materials===
In the 1st millennium BC, typical ancient Chinese writing materials were [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|bronzewares]], [[Oracle bone script|animal bones]], and [[bamboo slip]]s or wooden boards. By the beginning of the Han dynasty, the chief writing materials were [[clay tablet]]s, silk cloth, hemp [[History of paper#Paper in China|paper]],&lt;ref name =cnpaper /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li, Hui-Lin 1974.  An archeological and historical account of cannabis in China.  ''Economic Botany'' 28(4): 437–448.&lt;/ref&gt; and rolled scrolls made from bamboo strips sewn together with hempen string; these were passed through drilled holes and secured with clay stamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Loewe|1968|pp=89, 94–95}}; {{harvp|Tom|1989|p=99}}; {{harvp|Cotterell|2004|pp=11–13}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest known Chinese piece of hempen paper dates to the 2nd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Buisseret|1998|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =cnpaper&gt;Tsien, Tsuen-Hsuin (1985). &quot;Paper and Printing&quot;.

Evidence suggests that [[blast furnace]]s, that convert raw [[iron ore]] into [[pig iron]], which can be remelted in a [[cupola furnace]] to produce [[cast iron]] by means of a [[cold blast]] and [[hot blast]], were operational in China by the late [[Spring and Autumn period]] (722–481 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wagner|2001|pp=7, 36–37, 64–68, 75–76}}; {{harvp|Pigott|1999|pp=183–184}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[bloomery]] was nonexistent in ancient China; however, the Han-era Chinese produced [[wrought iron]] by injecting excess [[oxygen]] into a furnace and causing [[decarburization]].{{sfnp|Pigott|1999|pp=177, 191}} Cast iron and pig iron could be converted into wrought iron and [[steel]] using a [[finery forge|fining]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wang|1982|p=125}}; {{harvp|Pigott|1999|p=186}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Han dynasty Chinese used bronze and iron to make a range of weapons, culinary tools, carpenters' tools and domestic wares.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wagner|1993|p=336}}; {{harvp|Wang|1982|pp=103–105, 122–124}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A significant product of these improved iron-smelting techniques was the manufacture of new agricultural tools. The three-legged iron [[seed drill]], invented by the 2nd century BC, enabled farmers to carefully plant crops in rows instead of [[Sowing|casting seeds out by hand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Greenberger|2006|p=12}}; {{harvp|Cotterell|2004|p=24}}; {{harvp|Wang|1982|pp=54–55}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy moldboard iron [[plow]], also invented during the Han dynasty, required only one man to control it, two oxen to pull it. It had three [[plowshare]]s, a seed box for the drills, a tool which turned down the soil and could sow roughly 45,730 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (11.3 acres) of land in a single day.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nishijima|1986|pp=563–564}}; {{harvp|Ebrey|1986|pp=616–617}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

To protect crops from wind and drought, the grain intendant Zhao Guo (趙過) created the alternating fields system (''daitianfa'' 代田法) during Emperor Wu's reign. This system switched the positions of [[Ridge and furrow|furrows and ridges]] between growing seasons.{{sfnp|Nishijima|1986|pp=561–563}} Once experiments with this system yielded successful results, the government officially sponsored it and encouraged peasants to use it.{{sfnp|Nishijima|1986|pp=561–563}} Han farmers also used the pit field system (''aotian'' 凹田) for growing crops, which involved heavily fertilized pits that did not require plows or oxen and could be placed on sloping terrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hinsch|2002|pp=67–68}}; {{harvp|Nishijima|1986|pp=564–566}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In southern and small parts of central Han-era China, [[paddy field]]s were chiefly used to grow rice, while farmers along the [[Huai River]] used [[Transplanting|transplantation]] methods of rice production.{{sfnp|Nishijima|1986|pp=568–572}}

[[Timber]] was the chief building material during the Han dynasty; it was used to build palace halls, multi-story residential towers and halls and single-story houses.{{sfnp|Ebrey|1999|p=76}} Because wood decays rapidly, the only remaining evidence of Han wooden architecture is a collection of scattered ceramic roof tiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ebrey|1999|p=76}}; {{harvp|Wang|1982|pp=1–40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest surviving wooden halls in China date to the [[Tang dynasty]] (AD 618–907).{{sfnp|Steinhardt|2004|pp=228–238}} Architectural historian Robert L. Thorp points out the scarcity of Han-era archaeological remains, and claims that often unreliable Han-era literary and artistic sources are used by historians for clues about lost Han architecture.{{sfnp|Thorp|1986|pp=360–378}}

Though Han wooden structures decayed, some Han-dynasty ruins made of brick, stone, and [[rammed earth]] remain intact. This includes stone pillar-gates, brick tomb chambers, rammed-earth [[Chinese city wall|city walls]], rammed-earth and brick [[beacon]] towers, rammed-earth sections of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]], rammed-earth platforms where elevated halls once stood, and two rammed-earth [[castle]]s in [[Gansu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wang|1982|pp=1, 30, 39–40, 148–149}}; {{harvp|Chang|2007|pp=91–92}}; {{harvp|Morton|Lewis|2005|p=56}}; see also {{harvp|Ebrey|1999|p=76}}; see {{harvp|Needham|1972|loc=Plate V, Fig. 15, for a photo of a Han-era fortress in Dunhuang, Gansu province that has rammed earth ramparts with defensive crenallations at the top}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ruins of rammed-earth walls that once surrounded the capitals Chang'an and Luoyang still stand, along with their [[Sewage collection and disposal|drainage systems]] of brick arches, ditches, and ceramic [[water pipe]]s.{{sfnp|Wang|1982|pp=1–39}} [[Que (tower)|Monumental stone pillar-gates]], twenty-nine of which survive from the Han period, formed entrances of walled enclosures at shrine and tomb sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Steinhardt|2005a|p=279}}; {{harvp|Liu|2002|p=55}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These pillars feature artistic imitations of wooden and ceramic building components such as roof tiles, eaves, and [[balustrades]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Steinhardt|2005a|pp=279–280}}; {{harvp|Liu|2002|p=55}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[courtyard house]] is the most common type of home portrayed in Han artwork.{{sfnp|Ebrey|1999|p=76}} Ceramic architectural [[Architectural model|models of buildings]], like houses and towers, were found in Han tombs, perhaps to provide lodging for the dead in the afterlife. These provide valuable clues about lost wooden architecture. The artistic designs found on ceramic roof tiles of tower models are in some cases exact matches to Han roof tiles found at archaeological sites.{{sfnp|Steinhardt|2005b|pp=283–284}}

Over ten Han-era underground tombs have been found, many of them featuring [[arch]]ways, [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] chambers, and [[dome]]d roofs.{{sfnp|Wang|1982|pp=175–178}} Underground vaults and domes did not require buttress supports since they were held in place by earthen pits.{{sfnp|Watson|2000|p=108}} The use of brick vaults and domes in aboveground Han structures is unknown.{{sfnp|Watson|2000|p=108}}

From Han literary sources, it is known that wooden-trestle [[beam bridge]]s, [[arch bridge]]s, [[simple suspension bridge]]s, and floating [[pontoon bridge]]s existed in Han China.{{sfnp|Needham|1986d|pp=161–188}} However, there are only two known references to arch bridges in Han literature,{{sfnp|Needham|1986c|pp=171–172}} and only a single Han relief sculpture in Sichuan depicts an arch bridge.{{sfnp|Liu|2002|p=56}}

===Mechanical and hydraulic engineering===

Han-era mechanical engineering comes largely from the choice observational writings of sometimes-disinterested Confucian scholars who generally considered scientific and engineering endeavors to be far beneath them.{{sfnp|Fraser|2014|p=370}} Professional artisan-engineers (''jiang'' 匠) did not leave behind detailed records of their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Needham|1986c|pp=2, 9}}; see also {{harvp|Barbieri-Low|2007|p=36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Han scholars, who often had little or no expertise in mechanical engineering, sometimes provided insufficient information on the various technologies they described.{{sfnp|Needham|1986c|p=2}} Nevertheless, some Han literary sources provide crucial information. 

For example, in 15 BC the philosopher and writer [[Yang Xiong (author)|Yang Xiong]] described the invention of the [[Belt (mechanical)|belt drive]] for a [[quilling]] machine, which was of great importance to early textile manufacturing.{{sfnp|Needham|1988|pp=207–208}} The inventions of mechanical engineer and craftsman [[Ding Huan]] are mentioned in the ''Miscellaneous Notes on the Western Capital''.{{sfnp|Barbieri-Low|2007|p=197}} Around AD 180, Ding created a manually operated rotary fan used for [[air conditioning]] within palace buildings.{{sfnp|Needham|1986c|pp=99, 134, 151, 233}} Ding also used [[gimbal]]s as pivotal supports for one of his incense burners and invented the world's first known [[zoetrope]] lamp.{{sfnp|Needham|1986b|pp=123, 233–234}}

[[File:Winnowing machine and tilt hammer.JPG|thumb|A Han-dynasty pottery model of two men operating a [[Fengshanche|winnowing machine]] with a [[Crank (mechanism)|crank handle]] and a [[Trip hammer|tilt hammer]] used to pound grain.]]
Modern archaeology has led to the discovery of Han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in Han literary sources. As observed in Han miniature tomb models, but not in literary sources, the [[Crank (mechanism)|crank handle]] was used to operate the [[Fan (mechanical)|fans]] of [[Fengshanche|winnowing machines]] that separated grain from [[chaff]].{{sfnp|Needham|1986c|pp=116–119, Plate CLVI}} The [[odometer]] cart, invented during Han, measured journey lengths, using mechanical figures banging drums and gongs to indicate each distance traveled.{{sfnp|Needham|1986c|pp=281–285}} This invention is depicted in Han artwork by the 2nd century, yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until the 3rd century.{{sfnp|Needham|1986c|pp=283–285}} 

Modern archaeologists have also unearthed specimens of devices used during the Han dynasty, for example a pair of sliding metal [[caliper]]s used by craftsmen for making minute measurements. These calipers contain inscriptions of the exact day and year they were manufactured. These tools are not mentioned in any Han literary sources.{{sfnp|Loewe|1968|pp=195–196}}

The [[waterwheel]] appeared in Chinese records during the Han. As mentioned by Huan Tan about AD 20, they were used to turn gears that lifted iron [[trip hammer]]s, and were used in pounding, [[threshing]] and polishing grain.{{sfnp|Needham|1986c|pp=183–184, 390–392}} However, there is no sufficient evidence for the [[watermill]] in China until about the 5th century.{{sfnp|Needham|1986c|pp=396–400}} The [[Nanyang Commandery]] Administrator and mechanical engineer [[Du Shi]] (d.&amp;nbsp;38 AD) created a waterwheel-powered [[Reciprocating motion|reciprocator]] that worked the [[bellows]] for the smelting of iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|p=184}}; {{harvp|Needham|1986c|pp=370}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Waterwheels were also used to power [[chain pump]]s that lifted water to raised [[irrigation]] ditches. The chain pump was first mentioned in China by the philosopher Wang Chong in his 1st-century ''[[Lunheng|Balanced Discourse]]''.{{sfnp|Needham|1986c|pp=89, 110, 342–344}}

The [[armillary sphere]], a three-dimensional representation of the movements in the [[celestial sphere]], was invented in Han China by the 1st century BC.{{sfnp|Needham|1986a|p=343}} Using a [[water clock]], waterwheel and a series of gears, the Court Astronomer [[Zhang Heng]] (AD 78–139) was able to mechanically rotate his metal-ringed armillary sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|p=1050}}; {{harvp|Needham|1986c|pp=30, 479 footnote e}}; {{harvp|Morton|Lewis|2005|p=70}}; {{harvp|Bowman|2000|p=595}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To address the problem of slowed [[timekeeping]] in the [[pressure head]] of the inflow water clock, Zhang was the first in China to install an additional tank between the reservoir and inflow vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|p=1050}}; {{harvp|Needham|1986c|p=479 footnote e}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhang also invented a device he termed an &quot;earthquake weathervane&quot; (''houfeng didong yi'' 候風地動儀), which the British biochemist, sinologist, and historian [[Joseph Needham]] described as &quot;the ancestor of all [[seismographs]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in {{harvp|Fraser|2014|p=375}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This device was able to detect the exact [[Cardinal direction|cardinal]] or ordinal direction of [[earthquake]]s from hundreds of kilometers away.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|p=1050}}; {{harvp|Fraser|2014|p=375}}; {{harvp|Morton|Lewis|2005|p=70}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It employed an [[inverted pendulum]] that, when disturbed by ground tremors, would trigger a set of gears that dropped a metal ball from one of eight dragon mouths (representing all eight directions) into a metal toad's mouth.{{sfnp|Needham|1986a|pp=626–631}}  

The account of this device in the ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'' describes how, on one occasion, one of the metal balls was triggered without any of the observers feeling a disturbance.  Several days later, a messenger arrived bearing news that an earthquake had struck in Longxi Commandery (in modern [[Gansu Province]]), the direction the device had indicated, which forced the officials at court to admit the efficacy of Zhang's device.{{sfnp|Fraser|2014|p=376}}

Three Han mathematical treatises still exist. These are the ''[[Book on Numbers and Computation]]'', the ''[[Zhoubi Suanjing|Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon and the Circular Paths of Heaven]]'' and the ''[[Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]''. Han-era mathematical achievements include solving problems with [[Triangle#Types of triangle|right-angle triangles]], [[square root]]s, [[cube root]]s, and [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix methods]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dauben|2007|p=212}}; {{harvp|Liu|Feng|Jiang|Zheng|2003|pp=9–10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; finding more accurate [[Chronology of computation of π|approximations for pi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Needham|1986a|pp=99–100}}; {{harvp|Berggren|Borwein|Borwein|2004|p=27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; providing [[mathematical proof]] of the [[Pythagorean theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dauben|2007|pp=219–222}}; {{harvp|Needham|1986a|p=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; use of the [[Fraction (mathematics)|decimal fraction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Needham|1986a|pp=84–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gaussian elimination]] to solve [[System of linear equations|linear equations]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Shen|Crossley|Lun|1999|p=388}}; {{harvp|Straffin|1998|p=166}}; {{harvp|Needham|1986a|p=24–25, 121}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and continued fractions to find the [[root of a function|roots of equations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Needham|1986a|pp=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

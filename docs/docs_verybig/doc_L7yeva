The Vltava river is {{convert|430.3|km}} long and drains an area {{convert|28,090|km2}} in size, over half of Bohemia and about a third of the Czech Republic's entire territory.{{GeoQuelle|DE-BY|GV}}&lt;ref name=ceskyKrumlovInfo&gt;{{cite web|title=The Vltava River – Historical Communication Link in the Český Krumlov Region|url=http://www.ckrumlov.info/docs/en/region_histor_vltava.xml|website=Český Krumlov – UNESCO World Heritage|accessdate=19 June 2015|quote=The length of its flow to the mouth of the river to the Labe river near Mělnik is 430.2 km.

The Podolí water processing plant is on standby for such cases with the long section of the river upstream of the Podolí plant under the stricter, second degree of pollution prevention regulations.

The height difference from source to mouth is about {{convert|1016|m}} and the largest stream at the source is named Černý Potok (Black Brook) or Teplá Vltava (Warm Vltava). The Vltava itself originates by a confluence of two streams, the Warm Vltava (''{{Interlanguage link multi|Teplá Vltava|cs}}''), which is longer, and the Cold Vltava (''[[Kalte Moldau|Studená Vltava]]''), sourcing in [[Bavaria]]. Along its course, Vltava receives many tributaries, the biggest being [[Otava (river)|Otava]] and [[Berounka]] from the left and [[Lužnice (river)|Lužnice]] and [[Sázava River|Sázava]] from the right side.

Between the confluence with the [[Elbe]] at [[Mělník]] and [[Prague]], the river is navigable by vessels of up to {{convert|1000|tonnes}} displacement. Most of the river upstream of Prague as far as [[České Budějovice]] is currently navigable by craft of up to {{convert|300|tonnes}} displacement, but such vessels cannot pass the dams at [[Orlík dam|Orlík]] and [[Slapy dam|Slapy]], and are also restricted by a low bridge at [[Týn nad Vltavou]]. Work is planned to complete [[boat lift]]s, planned for but never completed, at the two dams, and to rebuild the bridge, in order for them to navigate throughout. Much smaller craft, of up to {{convert|3.5|tonnes}} displacement and under {{convert|3|m}} beam and {{convert|3|m}} air draft, can avoid these obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inlandwaterwaysinternational.org/downloads/Newsletter0717.pdf |title=Upper Vltava navigation inaugurated in May |work=IWI news |publisher=Inland Waterways International |date=July 2017 |accessdate=3 March 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200303173706/http://www.inlandwaterwaysinternational.org/downloads/Newsletter0717.pdf |archivedate=3 March 2020 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upstream of České Budějovice, the river's section around [[Český Krumlov]] (specifically from [[Vyšší Brod]] to [[Boršov nad Vltavou]]) is a very popular destination for [[water tourism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vltava-river.com/en/trip/along-the-river-branna-nove-spoli-xindtj2dy8 Along the River Branna Nove Spoli - vltava-river.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180709162858/http://americaninprague.eu/Prague/Czech-Republic/Vltava-River.shtml American in Prague (2018 webpage)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine hydroelectric dams have been built on the Vltava south of Prague to regulate the water flow and generate [[hydroelectric power]], starting in the 1950s. Beginning at the headwaters, these are: [[Lipno Dam|Lipno]], [[Lipno II Dam|Lipno II]], [[Hněvkovice Dam|Hněvkovice]], [[Kořensko Dam|Kořensko]], [[Orlík Dam|Orlík]], [[Kamýk Dam|Kamýk]], [[Slapy Dam|Slapy]], [[Štěchovice Reservoir|Štěchovice]] and [[Vrané Dam|Vrané]]. The Orlík dam supports the largest reservoir on the Vltava by volume, while the Lipno dam retains the largest reservoir by area. The [[Štěchovice Reservoir]] is built over the site of the [[St John's Rapids]].

The river also features numerous [[weirs]] that help mitigate its flow from {{convert|1172|m}} in elevation at its source near the German border to {{convert|155|m}} at its mouth in Mělník.

==Floods==
The Vltava basin has flooded multiple times throughout recorded history. Markers have been created along the banks denoting the water line for notable floods in 1784, 1845, 1890, 1940, and the highest of all in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Papadaniil|first1=Sofia|last2=Schütze|first2=Susann|last3=Alukwe|first3=Isaac|title=I.

In August of that year, the basin was heavily affected by the [[2002 European floods]] when the flooded river killed several people and caused massive damage and disruption along its length, including in Prague. It left the oldest bridge in Prague, Charles Bridge, seriously weakened, requiring years of work to repair.&lt;ref name=&quot;floodingInPrague&quot;/&gt;

Prague was again [[2013 European floods#Vltava river|flooded in 2013]]. Many locations within the Vltava and Elbe basins were left under water, including the [[Prague Zoo]], but metal barriers were erected along the banks of the Vltava to help protect the historic city centre.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot; &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22752544|title=Thousands flee as central Europe flood waters rise|date=3 June 2013|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RadioPraha&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=News|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/news-2013-06-03|accessdate=3 June 2013|newspaper=Radio Praha|date=3 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804231911/http://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/news-2013-06-03|archive-date=2013-08-04|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==References in culture and science==
One of the best-known works of [[classical music]] by a Czech composer is [[Bedřich Smetana]]'s ''[[Má vlast#Vltava|Vltava]]'', sometimes called ''The Moldau'' in English. It is from the [[Romantic music|Romantic era]] of classical music and is a musical description of the river's course through Bohemia ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdtLuyWuPDs listen]).

A [[minor planet]] [[2123 Vltava]] discovered in 1973 by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astronomer [[Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh]] is named after the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schmadel | first = Lutz D. | title = Dictionary of Minor Planet Names | page = 172 | edition = 5th  | year = 2003 | publisher = Springer Verlag | location = New York | url = https://books.google.com/books?q=2123+Vltava+1973 | isbn = 3-540-00238-3 | accessdate = 2009-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smetana's symphonic poem also inspired a song of the same name by [[Bertolt Brecht]].  An English version of it, by [[John Willett]], features the lyrics ''Deep down in the Moldau the pebbles are shifting'' / ''In Prague three dead emperors moulder away.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antiwarsongs.org/canzone.php?lang=en&amp;id=5159#agg117930 |title=The song of the Moldau  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=21 August 2012 |website=Anti War Songs |accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:QAPFsyenite.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|[[QAPF diagram]] that shows the [[quartz]] (Q), [[alkali feldspar]] (A), and [[plagioclase]] (P) composition of syenite]]
[[Image:Nepheline-syenite-2005.jpg|thumb|[[leucocratic]] variety of [[nepheline]] syenite from [[Sweden]] ([[särnaite]])]]
'''Syenite''' is a coarse-grained [[Intrusion|intrusive]] [[igneous rock]] with a general composition similar to that of [[granite]], but deficient in [[quartz]], which, if present at all, occurs in relatively small concentrations (&lt; 5%). Some syenites contain larger proportions of [[mafic]] components and smaller amounts of [[felsic]] material than most granites; those are classed as being of [[intermediate composition]]. The volcanic equivalent of syenite is [[trachyte]].

==Composition of syenites==
The [[feldspar]] component of syenite is predominantly [[alkaline]] in character (usually [[orthoclase]]). [[Plagioclase]] feldspars may be present in small proportions, less than 10%. Such feldspars often are interleaved as [[perthite|perthitic]] components of the rock.

When [[Mafic|ferromagnesian]] minerals are present in syenite at all, they usually occur in the form of [[hornblende]], [[amphibole]] and [[clinopyroxene]]. [[Biotite]] is rare, because in a syenite magma the formation of feldspar consumes nearly all the aluminium, however less Al rich [[phyllosilicates]] may be included such as [[annite]].

Other common accessory minerals are [[apatite]], [[titanite]], [[zircon]] and opaques.

Most syenites are either [[peralkaline]] with high proportions of alkali elements relative to aluminum, or [[peraluminous]] with a higher concentration of aluminum relative to [[Alkali metal|alkali]] and [[Alkaline earth metal|earth-alkali]] elements (predominantly K, Na, Ca).

==Formation of syenites==
Syenites are products of alkaline igneous activity, generally formed in thick [[continental crust]]al areas, or in Cordilleran [[subduction]] zones. To produce a syenite, it is necessary to melt a granitic or igneous [[protolith]] to a fairly low degree of [[partial melting]]. This is required because potassium is an incompatible element and tends to enter a melt first, whereas higher degrees of partial melting will liberate more calcium and sodium, which produce plagioclase, and hence a [[granite]], adamellite or [[tonalite]].

At very low degrees of partial melting a [[silica]] undersaturated melt is produced, forming a [[nepheline syenite]], where orthoclase is replaced by a [[feldspathoid]] such as [[leucite]], [[nepheline]] or [[analcime]].

Conversely in certain conditions, large volumes of [[anorthite]] crystals may precipitate from thoroughly molten magma in a [[cumulate rock|cumulate]] process as it cools. This leaves a drastically reduced concentration of silica in the remainder of the melt. The segregation of the silica from the melt leaves it in a state that may favour syenite formation.

==Occurrence of syenites==
[[File:Bulletin 426 Plate XVI B Bowlder Outcrop of Syenite.jpg|thumb|right|Boulders of syenite near [[Concord, North Carolina|Concord]], North Carolina, c. 1910.]]
Syenite is not a common rock. Regions where it occurs in significant quantities include the following.
*In the [[Kola Peninsula]] of Russia two giant [[nepheline]] syenite bodies exists making up the [[Lovozero Massif]] and the [[Khibiny Mountains]]. These syenites are part of the [[Kola Alkaline Province]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Downes |first1=Hilary |last2=Balaganskaya |first2=Elena |last3=Beard |first3=Andrew|last4=Liferovich |first4=Ruslan |last5=Demaiffe |first5=Daniel |date=2005 |title=Petrogenetic processes in the ultramafic, alkaline and carbonatitic magmatism in the Kola Alkaline Province: a review  |url=http://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/157/1/Downes4_Figs2-12.pdf |journal=Lithos |volume=85 |issue= 1–4|pages=48–75 |doi= 10.1016/j.lithos.2005.03.020|bibcode=2005Litho..85...48D |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Paatusoq]] and [[Kangerluluk]] fjords in southeastern [[Greenland]], where a bay within the latter ''(Syenitbugt)'' and a headland ''(Syenitnæs)'' are named after the rock.&lt;ref name=&quot;mapcarta&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mapcarta.com/19184706|title=Syenitnaes|work=Mapcarta|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term syenite was originally applied to hornblende granite like that of [[Syene]] (now Aswan) in [[Egypt]], from which the name is derived.

==Episyenite==
''Episyenite'' (or ''epi-syenite'') is a term used in [[petrology]] to describe the depletion of [[silicon dioxide]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in rock rich in silicon dioxide.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLemore-2016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McLemore |first1=Virginia T. |title=Episyenites in the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, Socorro County, New Mexico: preliminary results |journal=New Mexico Geological Society Field Conference Series |date=2016 |volume=67 |pages=255–262 |url=https://nmgs.nmt.edu/publications/guidebooks/downloads/67/67_p0255_p0262.pdf |accessdate=11 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A process that results in depletion often is termed ''episyenitization''. The term refers only to the [[macroscopic]] effect of relative depletion in a rock; it does not imply anything about the nature of the physical processes leading to the depletion in any particular case. Many different [[Metamorphism|metamorphic]] processes can lead to episyenitization. For example:
* chemical components in a stagnant melt can diffuse under the influence of chemical [[potential gradient]]s that cause their segregation from low- SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; components when the melt begins to solidify
* a SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-undersaturated fluid may dissolve [[quartz]] from rock and remove it by [[advection]], thus leaving the parent rock depleted of silica. 
* a marginally molten rock mass may retain its unmolten silica-rich components, while the molten, silica-depleted fluid cools to form a syenite.
* on beginning to cool, a fully molten silica-rich melt might precipitate its silica-containing components, leaving the silica-depleted melt to form a syenite afterwards.

A '''drumlin''', from the [[Irish Gaelic|Irish]] word ''droimnín'' (&quot;littlest ridge&quot;), first recorded in 1833, in the classical sense is an elongated [[hill]] in the shape of an inverted spoon or half-buried egg&lt;ref&gt;Menzies(1979) quoted in Benn, D.I. &amp; Evans, D.J.A. 2003 ''Glaciers &amp; Glaciation'', Arnold, London (p431) {{ISBN|0-340-58431-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; formed by [[glacier|glacial]] ice acting on underlying unconsolidated [[till]] or ground [[moraine]]. Clusters of drumlins create a landscape which is often described as having a 'basket of eggs topography'.&lt;ref&gt;http://geoschol.com/counties/CAVAN_GEOLOGY.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphology==

Drumlins occur in various shapes and sizes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=|title=The planar shape of drumlins|doi=10.1016/j.sedgeo.2010.01.008|volume=232|issue=3–4|pages=119–129|journal=Sedimentary Geology|df=|bibcode=2010SedG..232..119S|year=2010|last1=Spagnolo|first1=Matteo|last2=Clark|first2=Chris D.|last3=Hughes|first3=Anna L.C.|last4=Dunlop|first4=Paul|last5=Stokes|first5=Chris R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; including symmetrical (about the long axis), spindle, parabolic forms, and transverse asymmetrical forms. Generally, they are elongated, oval-shaped hills, with a long axis parallel to the orientation of ice flow and with an up-ice (stoss) face that is generally steeper than the down-ice (lee) face.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Menzies|first=|date=1979|title=A review of the literature on the formation and location of drumlins|url=|journal=Earth Science Review|volume=|pages=315-359|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drumlins are typically 250 to 1,000 meters long and between 120 and 300 meters wide.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark, Hughes, Greenwood, Spagnolo|first=|date=2009|title=Size and shape characteristics of drumlins, derived from a large sample, and associated scaling laws|url=|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drumlins generally have a length:width ratio of between 1.7 and 4.1&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; and it has been suggested that this ratio can indicate the velocity of the glacier. That is, since ice flows in laminar flow, the resistance to flow is frictional and depends on area of contact; thus, a more elongated drumlin would indicate a lower velocity and a shorter one would indicate a higher velocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nye|first=J|date=1952|title=The Mechanics of Glacier Flow|url=|journal=Journal of Glaciology|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==
Drumlins and drumlin clusters are glacial landforms composed primarily of glacial [[till]].

== Composition ==

Drumlins may comprise layers of [[clay]], [[silt]], sand, [[gravel]] and [[boulder]]s in various proportions; perhaps indicating that material was repeatedly added to a core, which may be of [[rock (geology)|rock]] or [[glacial till]]. Alternatively, drumlins may be residual, with the landforms resulting from erosion of material between the landforms. The [[Dilatancy (granular material)|dilatancy]] of glacial till was invoked as a major factor in drumlin formation.&lt;ref&gt;Smalley, I.J., Unwin, D.J. 1968. The formation and shape of drumlins and their distribution and orientation in drumlin fields. Journal of Glaciology 7, 377-390&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, drumlin fields include drumlins made up entirely of hard bedrock (e.g. [[granite]] or well-[[Limestone|lithified limestone]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;Lesemann, J., Brennand, T.A., 2009.

Quaternary Science Reviews 28, 2420–2444.&lt;/ref&gt; These drumlins cannot be explained by the addition of soft sediment to a core. Thus, accretion and erosion of soft sediment by processes of subglacial deformation do not present unifying theories for all drumlins—some are composed of residual bedrock.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

== Formation ==
There are two main theories of drumlin formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=|title=Automated drumlin shape and volume estimation using high resolution LiDAR imagery (Curvature Based Relief Separation): A test from the Wadena Drumlin Field, Minnesota|doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2015.07.020|volume=246|pages=589–601|journal=Geomorphology|archivedate=2015-09-24|df=|bibcode=2015Geomo.246..589Y|year=2015|last1=Yu|first1=Peter|last2=Eyles|first2=Nick|last3=Sookhan|first3=Shane}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first, ''constructional'', suggests that they form as sediment is deposited from subglacial waterways laden with till including gravel, clay, silt, and sand. As the drumlin forms, the scrape and flow of the glacier continues around it and the material deposited accumulates, the [http://www.antarcticglaciers.org/glacial-geology/techniques/clast-shape-till-fabrics-and-striae/#SECTION_2 clasts]  align themselves with direction of flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hermanowski, Piotrowski, Duda|first=|date=2020|title=Till kinematics in the Stargard drumlin field, NW Poland constrained by microstructural proxies|url=|journal=Journal of Quaternary Science|volume=35|pages=920-934|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is because of this process that geologists are able to determine how the drumlin formed using till fabric analysis, the study of the orientation and dip of particles within a till matrix. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andrews|first=JT|date=1971|title=Techniques of Till Fabric Analysis|url=http://uregina.ca/~sauchyn/geog411/till_fabric.html|journal=Technical Bulleting, British Geomorphological Society|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By examining the till particles and plotting their orientation and dip on a stereonet, scientists are able to see if there is a correlation between each clast and the overall orientation of the drumlin: the more similar in orientation and dip of the clasts throughout the drumlin, the more likely it is that they had been deposited during the formation process. If the opposite is true, and there doesn't seem to be a link between the drumlin and the till, it suggests that the other main theory of formation could be true.

The second theory proposes that drumlins form by erosion of material from an unconsolidated bed. Erosion under a glacier in the immediate vicinity of a drumlin can be on the order of a meter's depth of sediment per year, depending heavily on the [[shear stress]] acting on the ground below the glacier from the weight of the glacier itself, with the eroded sediment forming a drumlin as it is repositioned and deposited.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark2007&quot; /&gt;  

A hypothesis that catastrophic sub-glacial floods form drumlins by deposition or erosion challenges conventional explanations for drumlins.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, J., 2002. The meltwater hypothesis for subglacial bedforms. Quaternary International 90, 5-22.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes deposition of glaciofluvial sediment in cavities scoured into a glacier bed by subglacial meltwater, and remnant ridges left behind by erosion of soft sediment or hard rock by turbulent meltwater. This hypothesis requires huge, subglacial meltwater floods, each of which would raise sea level by tens of centimetres in a few weeks. Studies of erosional forms in bedrock at French River, Ontario, Canada provide evidence for such floods.

These formed through a progression of subglacial depositional and erosional processes, with each horizontal till bed within the drumlin created by an individual surge of the glacier.&lt;ref name=B&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1130/G31371.1 | last1 = Johnson | first1 = M.

However, it does not provide a unifying explanation of all drumlins. For example, drumlin fields including drumlins composed entirely of hard bedrock cannot be explained by deposition and erosion of unconsolidated beds.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;  Furthermore, hairpin scours around many drumlins are best explained by the erosive action of horseshoe vortices around obstacles in a turbulent boundary layer.&lt;ref&gt;Paik, J., Escauriaza, C.,  Sotiropoulos, F., 2007.

==Soil development on drumlins==
Recently formed drumlins often incorporate a thin &quot;A&quot; [[soil horizon]] (often referred to as  &quot;'topsoil'&quot; which accumulated after formation) and a thin &quot;Bw&quot; horizon (commonly referred to as &quot;'subsoil'&quot;). The &quot;C&quot; horizon, which shows little evidence of being affected by soil forming processes (weathering), is close to the surface, and may be at the surface on an eroded drumlin. Below the C horizon the drumlin consists of multiple beds of till deposited by lodgment and bed deformation. On drumlins with longer exposure (e.g. in the Lake Ontario drumlin field in New York State) soil development is more advanced, for example with the formation of clay-enriched &quot;Bt&quot; horizons.&lt;ref name=B/&gt;

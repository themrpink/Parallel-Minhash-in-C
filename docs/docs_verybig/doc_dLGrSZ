'''''The Great Hunt''''' is a [[fantasy]] novel by [[United States|American]] author [[Robert Jordan]], the second book of ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' series. It was published by [[Tor Books]] and released on November 15, 1990. ''The Great Hunt'' consists of a [[prologue]] and 50 [[chapter (books)|chapter]]s. In 2004 ''The Great Hunt'' was re-released as two separate books, ''The Hunt Begins'' and ''New Threads in the Pattern''.

The story features young heroes [[Rand al'Thor]], [[Mat Cauthon]], and [[Perrin Aybara]], who join [[Shienar]]en soldiers in a quest to retrieve the [[Horn of Valere]]. At the same time, [[Egwene al'Vere]], [[Nynaeve al'Meara]], and [[Elayne Trakand]] go to the White Tower in [[Tar Valon]] to learn [[Aes Sedai]] ways. Finally, an exotic army invades the western coast.

==Plot summary==

===Prologue===
[[Ba'alzamon]] presides over a clandestine meeting. In addition to Forsaken and Darkfriends (the [[antagonist]]'s known subordinates), the meeting includes two [[Aes Sedai]].

===The Hunt Begins===
At Fal Dara in Shienar, following the events in ''[[The Eye of the World]]'', the protagonists are visited by the [[Amyrlin Seat]], [[Siuan Sanche]], who identifies [[Rand al'Thor]] as the Dragon Reborn. Mat's condition worsens through his psychic attachment to a parasitic dagger.  [[Lan Mandragoran]] instructs Rand in sword fighting.  Darkfriend [[Padan Fain]] is imprisoned but subsequently freed by Darkforces, stealing the [[Horn of Valere]] and the tainted dagger. Rand, [[Perrin Aybara]], and Mat accompany a Shienaran party southbound in pursuit, under the leadership of Lord Ingtar and guided by a tracker named Hurin. [[Nynaeve al'Meara]] and [[Egwene al'Vere]] accompany Moraine to Tar Valon for Aes Sedai training, where they befriend [[Elayne Trakand]] and the clairvoyant Min. There, Nynaeve passes the test to become Accepted, a rank in the White Tower below Aes Sedai and above a Novice.

[[Image:Thehuntbegins.jpg|thumb|left|Cover of ''The Hunt Begins'']]
Rand, [[Loial]], and Hurin are separated from the Shienaran party and transported to an alternate world; similar to their own, but deserted and distorted. Rand suspects that he activated the portal stone by unconsciously channeling ''[[saidin]]'' in his sleep, although Egwene dreams that a mysterious woman (later identified as [[Lanfear]]) is responsible. Rand's struggle to accept his channeling ability is a recurring element in the novel. In this alternate world, Rand meets [[Ba'alzamon]] and has a [[heron]]'s image (the crest of his sword) branded into his palm in a fight. Later, with the help of Selene (Lanfear in disguise), they return to their own world, ahead of Fain's and Ingtar's groups. This done, they recover the Horn and dagger. At a loss to explain Rand's disappearance, Lord Ingtar's group pursue Padan Fain with the aid of Perrin, who uses a telepathic ability to communicate with wolves.

Rand's party journeys to Cairhien, where Rand finds gleeman [[Thom Merrilin]], whom he thought dead in ''[[The Eye of the World]]''. Rand and Loial are attacked by Trollocs (the Dark One's bestial foot-soldiers) and, during their escape, destroy the Chapter House of the Illuminator's Guild, a society retaining knowledge of [[fireworks]]. The [[Horn of Valere|Horn]] and [[dagger]] are again lost. Later, Thom's apprentice Dena is murdered for Thom's involvement with Rand.

===To Toman Head===
With the aid of Perrin, Ingtar's group is reunited with Rand, and they learn that the Horn has been taken to Toman Head, at the port city of Falme. To gain time, Rand tries to lead them through an alternate world; but instead loses time. Meanwhile, the invading [[Seanchan]] and their exotic beasts have occupied Falme.  Geofram Bornhald, leader of the zealous religious group [[Children of the Light (The Wheel of Time)|Children of the Light]], is preparing to attack the Seanchan. At the White Tower, Liandrin lures Egwene and Nynaeve, along with Elayne and Min, to Toman Head, where Min is captured by the Seanchan and Egwene is collared with an ''[[Items of the One Power#A'dam|a'dam]]'': a device used by the Seanchan to control channelers. Nynaeve and Elayne escape.

At Falme, Rand slays High Lord Turak of the [[Seanchan]] before escaping with the Horn and dagger. Ingtar reveals himself as a Darkfriend, but redeems himself when he dies fighting for Rand's group. Elayne and Nynaeve rescue Egwene from the Seanchan and attempt to flee the city. At this moment the [[Whitecloaks]] also attack, leaving the heroes trapped between the Seanchan and the Whitecloaks; whereupon Mat blows the [[Horn of Valere]], resurrecting dead heroes including [[Artur Hawkwing]], which overcome the Seanchan and vanish. Rand himself vanquishes [[Ba'alzamon]], but is himself wounded, and in doing so projects an image of their duel to numerous peoples.

'''''Winter's Heart'''''  a [[fantasy literature|fantasy]] novel   by American author [[Robert Jordan]],  the ninth book of his series ''[[The Wheel of Time|Wheel of Time]]''. It was published by [[Tor Books]] and released on November 7, 2000. Upon its release, it immediately rose to the #1 position on the ''[[New York Times]]'' hardcover fiction [[New York Times bestseller list|bestseller list]], making it the second ''Wheel of Time'' book to reach the #1 position on that list. It remained on the list for the next two months. ''Winter's Heart'' consists of a [[prologue]] and 35 [[chapter (books)|chapter]]s.

The book's title is a reference to the increasing coldness of [[Rand al'Thor]]'s personality and to the return of [[winter]] following the reversal in the previous book, ''[[The Path of Daggers]]'', of the unnatural heat caused by the [[Dark One (Wheel of Time)|Dark One]]'s manipulation of [[climate]].

''Winter's Heart'' was the first ''Wheel of Time'' book for which the prologue, entitled &quot;Snow&quot;, was first sold as an [[ebook]] in advance of the physical release of the book. &quot;Snow&quot; was released by the Scribner [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in September 2000, two months before the publication of ''Winter's Heart''.

==Plot summary==
Many of the events of ''Winter's Heart'' take place simultaneously with the events of the next book, ''[[Crossroads of Twilight]]''. [[Perrin Aybara]] and his followers pursue the Shaido [[Aiel]] who [[kidnap]]ped his wife, [[Faile Bashere]], while [[Elayne Trakand]] attempts to suppress rebellious nobles.

[[Mat Cauthon]] is trapped in the city of [[Ebou Dar]] in [[Altara]], under [[Seanchan]] occupation. His escape is disrupted by a Seanchan noblewoman named [[Tuon Athaem Kore Paendrag|Tuon]], the heir to the Seanchan [[Crystal Throne]]; and Mat, having heard a prophecy of his own marriage to the [[Daughter of the Nine Moons]], referring to Tuon herself, kidnaps her.

[[Rand al'Thor]] is appointed a [[Warder (Wheel of Time)|Warder]] by [[Elayne Trakand]], [[Aviendha]], and [[Min Farshaw]]; and later kills most of the [[Asha'man]] traitors in [[Places in the Wheel of Time series#Far Madding|Far Madding]]. Lan also kills Toram Riatin in a duel. Caught by guards, he is imprisoned for a short time but is set free by [[Cadsuane]] and the other Aes Sedai. Rand and [[Nynaeve al'Meara]] Travel to [[Shadar Logoth]]. There, defended by [[Cadsuane Melaidhrin]]'s [[Aes Sedai]] and loyal [[Asha'man]] against the [[Forsaken (Wheel of Time)|Forsaken]], Rand and Nynaeve use the [[Choedan Kal]] to cleanse ''[[saidin]]'' of the [[Dark One (Wheel of Time)|Dark One]]'s influence.

'''Mrs. Miniver''' is a fictional character created by [[Jan Struther]] in 1937 for a series of newspaper columns for ''[[The Times]]'', later adapted into [[Mrs. Miniver|a film of the same name]].

==Origin==
In the 1930s [[Jan Struther]] started to write for ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine, and this brought her to the attention of ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, where [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter Fleming]] asked her to write a series of columns for the paper, about &quot;an ordinary sort of woman who leads an ordinary sort of life – rather like yourself&quot;. The resulting character that she created, Mrs. Kay Miniver, proved a huge success from the character's inception in 1937, and the columns were subsequently published in book form in 1939. On the outbreak of war, this book became the basis for a patriotic and sentimental American film, ''[[Mrs. Miniver]]'', released in 1942, which won six [[Academy Awards]], including Best Picture.

''The Times'' columns were short reflections on everyday life, based in part on Struther's own family and experiences. While the columns started out as lighthearted domestic scenes where the outside world barely intruded, the approach of [[World War II]] slowly brought darker global concerns into Mrs. Miniver's world. One of the more memorable pieces appears near the middle of the series, where the Minivers get gas masks.

==Book publication==
The columns were first published in book form in 1939, shortly after the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Struther stopped the regular newspaper columns that year, but wrote a series of letters from Mrs. Miniver, expanding on the character's wartime experiences. These were published in later editions.

The book became an enormous success, especially in the United States, where Struther went on a lecture tour shortly after the book's release.

The U.S. was still officially neutral, but as war with [[Nazi Germany]] intensified in Europe, the tribulations of the Miniver family engaged the sympathy of the American public sufficiently that President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] credited it for hastening America's involvement in the war. [[Winston Churchill]] is said to have claimed that it had done more for the Allied cause than a flotilla of battleships.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Yellin, ''Our Mothers' War'', p 100 {{ISBN|0-7432-4514-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill is further quoted by Bernard Wasserstein in his book, &quot;Barbarism and Civilization,&quot; as saying that the book (and later the film) was worth &quot;six divisions of war effort.&quot;

In 1942, when the film came out, Roosevelt ordered it rushed to theaters.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Yellin, ''Our Mothers' War'', p 99-100 {{ISBN|0-7432-4514-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film adaptations==
{{main|Mrs. Miniver}}

The film adaptation of ''Mrs. Miniver'' was produced by [[MGM]] in [[1942 in film|1942]] with [[Greer Garson]] in the leading role and [[William Wyler]] directing. Under the influence of the American [[Office of War Information]], the film attempted to undermine Hollywood's prewar depiction of Britain as a glamorous bastion of social privilege, anachronistic habits and snobbery in favour of more democratic, modern images. To this end, the social status enjoyed by the Miniver family in the print version was downgraded and increased attention was given to the erosion of class barriers under the pressures of wartime.
In 1942, the film won an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in the Best Picture category and both Greer Garson and [[Teresa Wright]] won an Oscar in the Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress categories, respectively.
The film grossed $5,358,000 ({{inflation|US-GDP|5358000|1942|fmt=eq}}) in [[North America]] (the highest for any MGM film at the time) and $3,520,000 abroad {{inflation|US-GDP|3520000|1942|fmt=eq}}. In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], it was named the top box office attraction of 1942. 555 of the 592 film critics polled by American magazine ''[[Film Daily]]'' named it the best film of 1942.

A sequel to ''Mrs. Miniver'', ''[[The Miniver Story]]'' was made by the same studio in [[1950 in film|1950]] with Greer Garson and [[Walter Pidgeon]] reprising their original roles. The characters were based on those in the original film, but their creator, Jan Struther, did not participate in the sequel.

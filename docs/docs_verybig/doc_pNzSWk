'''Pope Leo XIII''' ({{lang-it|Leone XIII}}; born '''Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi Pecci''';{{efn|{{IPAc-it|v|i|n|ˈ|c|E|n|z|o|_|gi|o|a|q|ˈ|ch|i|ː|n|o|_|r|a|ff|a|ˈ|E|ː|l|e|_|l|u|ˈ|i|ː|g|i|_|ˈ|p|e|cc|i|}} English: '''Vincent Joachim Raphael Lewis Pecci'''}} 2 March 1810 – 20 July 1903) was the head of the [[Catholic Church]] from 20 February 1878 to his death in 1903. He was the [[List of ages of popes|oldest]] pope (reigning until the age of 93), with the exception of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] as emeritus pope, and had the [[List of popes by length of reign|third-longest confirmed pontificate]], behind those of [[Pius IX]] (his immediate predecessor) and [[John Paul II]].

He is well known for his intellectualism and his attempts to define the position of the Catholic Church with regard to modern thinking. In his famous 1891 encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]'', Pope Leo outlined the rights of workers to a fair wage, safe working conditions, and the formation of [[trade unions]], while affirming the rights of property and free enterprise, opposing both [[socialism]] and [[laissez-faire]] [[capitalism]]. He influenced [[Mariology of the Catholic Church]] and promoted both the [[rosary]] and the [[scapular]].

Leo XIII issued a record of eleven papal encyclicals on the [[rosary]], earning him the title as the &quot;'''Rosary Pope'''&quot;. In addition, he approved two new Marian [[scapular]]s and was the first pope to fully embrace the concept of Mary as [[Mediatrix]]. He was the first pope to have never held any control over the [[Papal States]], after they had been dissolved by 1870. He was briefly buried in the grottos of Saint Peter's Basilica before his remains were later transferred to the [[Basilica of Saint John Lateran]].

== Early life and education, 1810–1836 ==
[[File:Carpineto italiano paolucci.jpg|thumb|left|170px|The house in [[Carpineto Romano]] in which the Pecci brothers grew up]]
Born in [[Carpineto Romano]], near Rome, he was the sixth of the seven sons of Count Ludovico Pecci and his wife, Anna Prosperi Buzzi. His brothers included [[Giuseppe Pecci|Giuseppe]] and Giovanni Battista Pecci. Until 1818, he lived at home with his family &quot;in which religion counted as the highest grace on earth, as through her, salvation can be earned for all eternity.&quot;{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=7}} Together with Giuseppe, he studied in the Jesuit College in [[Viterbo]], where he stayed until 1824.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=12}} He enjoyed [[Latin]] and was known to write his own Latin poems at the age of eleven.

In 1824, he and Giuseppe were called to Rome, where their mother was dying. Count Pecci wanted his children near him after the loss of his wife and so they stayed with him in Rome and attended the Jesuit [[Collegium Romanum]].

In 1828, the 18-year-old Vincenzo decided in favour of [[secular clergy]], and Giuseppe entered the Jesuit order.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=20}} Vincenzo studied at the [[Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy|Academia dei Nobili]], mainly diplomacy and law. In 1834, he gave a student presentation, attended by several [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], on papal judgments. For his presentation, he received awards for academic excellence and gained the attention of Vatican officials.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=23}} [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Luigi Lambruschini]] introduced him to Vatican congregations. During a cholera epidemic in Rome, he assisted [[Giuseppe Antonio Sala|Cardinal Sala]] in his duties as overseer of all the city hospitals.&lt;ref name=Benigni&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09169a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Pope Leo XIII|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1836, he received his doctorate in theology and doctorates of civil and [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] in Rome.

==Provincial administrator, 1837–1843==
[[File:Carpineto romano illustration 1878.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the [[Carpineto Romano]] as seen in 1860]]
On 14 February 1837, [[Pope Gregory XVI]] appointed the 27-year-old Pecci as personal [[prelate]] even before he was ordained a priest on 31 December 1837 by the [[Cardinal Vicar|Vicar of Rome]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Carlo Odescalchi]]. He celebrated his first Mass with his priest brother Giuseppe.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=24}} Shortly thereafter, [[Gregory XVI]] appointed Pecci as legate (provincial administrator) to [[Benevento]], the smallest papal province, with a population of about 20,000.&lt;ref name=Benigni /&gt;

The main problems facing Pecci were a decaying local economy, insecurity from widespread bandits, and pervasive [[Camorra|Mafia or Camorra]] structures, which were often allied with aristocratic families. Pecci arrested the most powerful aristocrat in Benevento and his troops captured others, who were either killed or imprisoned by him. With public order restored, he turned to the economy and a reform of the tax system to stimulate trade with the neighboring provinces.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=31}}

Pecci was first destined for [[Spoleto]], a province of 100,000. On 17 July 1841, he was sent to [[Perugia]] with 200,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name=Benigni /&gt; His immediate concern was to prepare the province for a papal visitation in the same year. Pope Gregory XVI visited hospitals and educational institutions for several days, asking for advice and listing questions. The fight against corruption continued in Perugia, where Pecci investigated several incidents. When it was claimed that a bakery was selling bread below the prescribed pound weight, he personally went there, had all bread weighed and confiscated it if below legal weight. The confiscated bread was distributed to the poor.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=37}}

==Nuncio to Belgium, 1843==
[[File:Leo13nuncio.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Archbishop Pecci as [[Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium|Nuncio]] in [[Brussels]]]]
In 1843, Pecci, at only 33, was appointed [[Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium]],&lt;ref name=Miranda&gt;[http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1853-ii.htm#Pecci Miranda, Salvador. &quot;Pecci, Gioacchino&quot;, ''The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church'']&lt;/ref&gt; a position that guaranteed the Cardinal's hat after completion of the tour.

On 27 April 1843, Pope Gregory XVI appointed Pecci [[Archbishop]] and asked his Cardinal Secretary of State Lambruschini to consecrate him.&lt;ref name=Miranda /&gt; Pecci developed excellent relations with the royal family and used the location to visit neighboring Germany, where he was particularly interested in the resumed construction of the [[Cologne Cathedral]].

In 1844, upon his initiative, a [[Belgian college (Rome)|Belgian College]] in Rome was opened; 102 years later, in 1946, the future [[Pope John Paul II]] would begin his Roman studies there. He spent several weeks in England with Bishop [[Nicholas Wiseman]], carefully reviewing the condition of the [[Catholic Church in England#Nineteenth century|Catholic Church in that country]].{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=52}}

In Belgium, the school question was sharply debated between the Catholic majority and the liberal minority. Pecci encouraged the struggle for Catholic schools, but he was able to win the good will of the Court not only of the pious [[Louise-Marie of France|Queen Louise]] but also of [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]], who was strongly liberal in his views. The new nuncio succeeded in uniting Catholics. At the end of his mission, the King granted him the Grand Cordon in the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]].&lt;ref&gt;Laatste Nieuws (Het) 1 January 1910&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archbishop-Bishop of Perugia, 1846–1878==

===Papal assistant===
[[File:Leo entryperugia.jpg|thumb|Archbishop Pecci enters [[Perugia]] in 1846]]
In 1843, Pecci had been named [[Assistant at the Pontifical Throne|papal assistant]]. From 1846 to 1877, he was considered a popular and successful [[Archbishop of Perugia|Archbishop-Bishop of Perugia]]. In 1847, after [[Pope Pius IX]] granted unlimited freedom for the press in the Papal States,&lt;ref&gt;Kühne 62&lt;/ref&gt; Pecci, who had been highly popular in the first years of his episcopate, became the object of attacks in the media and at his residence.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=66}} In 1848, [[revolutions of 1848|revolutionary movements]] developed throughout Western Europe, including France, Germany and Italy. Austrian, French and Spanish troops reversed the revolutionary gains but at a price for Pecci and the Catholic Church, who could not regain their former popularity.

===Provincial council===
Pecci called a provincial council{{when|date=July 2017}} to reform the religious life in his dioceses. He invested in enlarging the seminary for future priests and in hiring new and prominent professors, preferably [[Thomist]]s. He called on his brother [[Giuseppe Pecci]], a noted Thomist scholar, to resign his professorship in Rome and to teach in Perugia instead.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=76}} His own residence was next to the seminary, which facilitated his daily contacts with the students.

===Charitable activities===
[[File:Leopoor.jpg|thumb|Archbishop Pecci aids the poor in Perugia]]
Pecci developed several activities{{when|date=July 2017}} in support of [[Catholic charities]]. He founded [[homeless shelter]]s for boys, girls and elderly women. Throughout his dioceses, he opened branches of a ''Bank, Monte di Pietà'', which focused on low-income people and provided [[low-interest loan]]s.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=78}} He created [[soup kitchen]]s, which were run by the Capuchins. In the consistory of 19 December 1853, he was elevated to the [[College of Cardinals]], as [[Cardinal-Priest]] of [[San Crisogono|S. Crisogono]].&lt;ref name=Miranda /&gt; In light of continuing earthquakes and floods, he donated all resources for festivities to the victims. Much of the public attention turned on the conflict between the [[Papal States]] and Italian nationalism, which aimed at the Papal States' annihilation to achieve the [[Unification of Italy]].

===Defending papacy===
Pecci defended the papacy and its claims. When Italian authorities expropriated convents and monasteries of Catholic orders, turning them into administration or military buildings, Pecci protested but acted moderately. When the Italian state took over Catholic schools, Pecci, fearing for his theological seminary, simply added all secular topics from other schools and opened the seminary to nontheologians.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=102}} The new government also levied taxes on the Church and issued legislation{{when|date=July 2017}} according to which all episcopal or papal utterances were to be approved by the government before their publication.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=105}}

===Organizing First Vatican Council===
On 8 December 1869, an [[Catholic Ecumenical Councils|ecumenical council]], which became known as the [[First Vatican Council]], was to take place in the Vatican per Pope Pius IX. Pecci was likely well informed since the Pope named his brother Giuseppe to help prepare the event.

During the 1870s, in his last years in Perugia, Pecci addressed the role of the Church in modern society several times, defining the Church as ''the mother of material civilization'' because it upheld human dignity of working people, opposed the excesses of industrialization and developed large-scale charities for the needy.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=129}}

In August 1877, on the death of Cardinal [[Filippo de Angelis]], Pope Pius IX appointed him [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Camerlengo]], which required him to reside in Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oreilly&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=BERNARD O'REILLY|first=D. D.|url=http://archive.org/details/lifepopeleoxiii00ldgoog|title=Life of Pope Leo XIII|date=1886|others=unknown library|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1878 papal conclave===
{{Main|1878 papal conclave}}
Pope Pius IX died on 7 February 1878,&lt;ref name=Oreilly /&gt; and during his closing years the liberal press had often insinuated that the [[Kingdom of Italy]] should take a hand in the [[Papal conclave|conclave]] and occupy the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} However the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]] and the sudden death of [[Victor Emmanuel II]] (9 January 1878) distracted the government's attention.

In the conclave, the cardinals faced varied questions and discussed issues like [[church-state relations (Catholic Church)|church–state relations]] in Europe, specifically Italy; divisions in the church and the status of the First Vatican Council. It was also debated that the conclave be moved elsewhere, but Pecci decided otherwise. On 18 February 1878, the conclave assembled in Rome. Cardinal Pecci was elected on the third ballot and chose the name Leo XIII.&lt;ref name=Oreilly /&gt; He was announced to the people and later crowned on 3 March 1878.

He retained the administration of the Perugia see until 1880.

==Papacy, 1878–1903==
{{Social teachings of the popes}}

[[File:XIII.Leopápa1.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Photograph of Leo XIII in his later years.]]

As soon as he was elected to the papacy, Leo XIII worked to encourage understanding between the Church and the modern world. When he firmly reasserted the [[scholasticism|scholastic]] doctrine that science and religion coexist, he required the study of [[Thomas Aquinas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/pope0256dd.htm |title=Aeterni Patris&amp;nbsp;– On the Restoration of Christian Philosophy |publisher=Catholic forum |type=encyclical |date=4 August 1879 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225040233/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/pope0256dd.htm |archivedate=25 February 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and opened the [[Vatican Secret Archives]] to qualified researchers, among whom was the noted historian of the Papacy [[Ludwig von Pastor]]. He also refounded the [[Vatican Observatory]]
&quot;so that everyone might see clearly that the Church and her Pastors are not opposed to true and solid science, whether human or divine, but that they embrace it, encourage it, and promote it with the fullest possible devotion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Pecci |first=Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi |author-link=Pope Leo XIII |title=Ut Mysticam |language=Latin |date=14 March 1891}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leo XIII was the first Pope of whose voice a [[sound recording]] was made. The recording can be found on a compact disc of [[Alessandro Moreschi]]'s singing; a recording of his praying of the [[Ave Maria (musical settings)|Ave Maria]] is available on the Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://archive.org/details/PopeLeoXIII1810-1903 |publisher=Archive |title=Pope Leo XIII, 1810–1910}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the first Pope to be filmed by a motion picture camera. He was filmed by its inventor, [[W. K. Dickson]], and blessed the camera while being filmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Encyclopedia of early cinema |first=Richard |last=Abel |isbn=978-0-415-23440-5 |page=266 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cc71Uekc_EC&amp;pg=PA266|date=2004-08-01}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leo XIII brought normality back to the Church after the tumultuous years of Pius IX. Leo's intellectual and diplomatic skills helped regain much of the prestige lost with the fall of the Papal States. He tried to reconcile the Church with the working class, particularly by dealing with the social changes that were sweeping Europe. The new economic order had resulted in the growth of an impoverished working class who had increasing anticlerical and socialist sympathies. Leo helped reverse that trend.

Although Leo XIII was no radical in either theology or politics, his papacy moved the Catholic Church back to the mainstream of European life. Considered a great diplomat, he managed to improve relations with Russia, Prussia, Germany, France, Britain and other countries.

Pope Leo XIII was able to reach several agreements in 1896 that resulted in better conditions for the faithful and additional appointments of bishops. During the [[fifth cholera pandemic]] in 1891, he ordered the construction of a [[hospice]] inside the Vatican. That building would be torn down in 1996 to make way for construction of the [[Domus Sanctae Marthae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/HolySee/Interregnum/domus.asp |title=Domus Sanctae Marthae &amp; The New Urns Used in the Election of the Pope |publisher=EWTN |date=22 February 1996 |accessdate=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leo was a drinker of the [[cocaine]]-infused wine tonic [[Vin Mariani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Poison Pills: The Untold Story of the Vioxx Drug Scandal|last=Nesi|first=Thomas|date=2008|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|isbn=9780312369590|edition=1st|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/poisonpillsuntol0000nesi/page/53 53]|oclc=227205792|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/poisonpillsuntol0000nesi/page/53}}&lt;/ref&gt; He awarded a [[Vatican City|Vatican]] gold medal to the wine's creator, [[Angelo Mariani (chemist)|Angelo Mariani]], and also appeared on a poster endorsing it.&lt;ref name=inciardi&gt;{{cite book |last=Inciardi |first=James A. |title=The War on Drugs II |publisher=Mayfield Publishing Company |year=1992 |page=6 |isbn=978-1-55934-016-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leo XIII was a [[semi-vegetarianism|semi-vegetarian]]. In 1903, he attributed his longevity to the sparing use of meat and the consumption of eggs, milk and vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;[https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84020558/1903-03-09/ed-1/seq-2/ ''The Elusive Secret of Long Life'']. ''Arizona Republican''. (March 9, 1903). p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

His favourite poets were [[Virgil]] and [[Dante]].&lt;ref name=&quot;centurymag&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WngAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA596  &quot;Pope Leo XIII and his Household&quot;] in ''The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine'', p. 596&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign relations===

====Russia====
{{Main |Pope Leo XIII and Russia|Pope Leo XIII and Poland}}
Pope Leo XIII began his pontificate with a friendly letter to Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] in which he reminded the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] monarch of the millions of Catholics living in his empire who would like to be good Russian subjects if their dignity were respected.

After the assassination of Alexander II, the Pope sent a high ranking representative to the coronation of his successor, [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]], who was grateful and asked for all religious forces to unify. He asked the Pope to ensure that his bishops abstain from political [[agitator|agitation]]. Relations improved further when Pope Leo XIII, because of Italian considerations, distanced the Vatican from the Rome-Vienna-Berlin alliance, and helped to facilitate a rapprochement between Paris and St. Petersburg.

====Germany====
Under [[Otto von Bismarck]], the [[anti-Catholic]] ''[[Kulturkampf]]'' in Prussia led to significant restrictions on the Catholic Church in Imperial Germany, including the [[Jesuits Law (1872)|Jesuits Law of 1872]]. During Leo's papacy, compromises were informally reached and the anti-Catholic attacks subsided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ronald J. |last=Ross |title=The failure of Bismarck's Kulturkampf: Catholicism and state power in imperial Germany, 1871–1887 |year=1998 |location= Washington |publisher= Catholic University of America Press |isbn= 978-0-81320894-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] in Germany represented Catholic interests and was a force for social change. It was encouraged by Leo's support for social welfare legislation and the rights of working people. Leo's forward-looking approach encouraged Catholic Action in other European countries, where the social teachings of the Church were incorporated into the agenda of Catholic parties, particularly the [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] parties, which became an acceptable alternative to socialist parties. Leo's social teachings were reiterated throughout the 20th century by his successors.

In his ''Memoirs''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywZoAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=kaiser+%22My+Memoirs |title=Memoirs |pages=204–07 |accessdate=2013-06-23 |last1=Emperor) |first1=William I.I. (German |year=1922}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] discussed the &quot;friendly, trustful relationship that existed between me and Pope Leo XIII.&quot; During Wilhelm's third visit to Leo: &quot;It was of interest to me that the Pope said on this occasion that Germany must be the sword of the Catholic Church. I remarked that the old Roman Empire of the German nation no longer existed, and that conditions had changed. But he adhered to his words.&quot;

====France====
Leo XIII was the first pope to come out strongly in favour of the [[French Republic]], upsetting many French [[monarchist]]s.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Count Vincenzo Pecci Elected Pope|url=https://worldhistoryproject.org/1878/2/20/count-vincenzo-pecci-leo-xiii-elected-pope|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Italy====
In the light of a climate hostile to the Church, Leo continued the policies of Pius IX towards Italy without major modifications.{{Sfn|Schmidlin|1934|p=409}} In his relations with the Italian state, Leo continued the Papacy's self-imposed [[prisoner in the Vatican|incarceration in the Vatican]] stance and continued to insist that Italian Catholics should not vote in Italian elections or hold any elected office. In his first [[papal consistory|consistory]] in 1879, he elevated his older brother, [[Giuseppe Pecci|Giuseppe]], to the cardinalate. He had to defend the freedom of the Church against what Catholics considered Italian persecutions and attacks in the area of education, expropriation and violation of Catholic Churches, legal measures against the Church and brutal attacks, culminating in anticlerical groups attempting to throw the body of the deceased Pope Pius IX into the [[Tiber]] on 13 July 1881.{{Sfn|Schmidlin|1934|p=413}} The Pope even considered moving his residence to [[Trieste]] or [[Salzburg]], two cities in [[Austria]], an idea that Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] gently rejected.{{Sfn|Schmidlin|1934|p=414}}

====United Kingdom====
Among the activities of Leo XIII that were important for the English-speaking world, he [[eestoration of the Scottish hierarchy|restored the Scottish hierarchy]] in 1878. The following year, on 12 May 1879, he raised to the rank of [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] the convert clergyman [[John Henry Newman]],&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Martire |first=Egilberto |date=1951 |title=Enciclopedia Cattolica |trans-title=Catholic Encyclopedia |language=Italian|location=Firenze |publisher=Casa Editrice G. C. Sansoni |volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; who would eventually be [[beatification|beatified]] by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2010 and [[canonization|canonized]] by [[Pope Francis]] in 2019. In [[British India]], too, Leo established a Catholic hierarchy in 1886 and regulated some longstanding conflicts with the Portuguese authorities. A Papal Rescript (20 April 1888) condemned the Irish [[Plan of Campaign#Papal Encyclical 1888|Plan of Campaign]] and all clerical involvement in it as well as boycotting, followed in June by the papal encyclical &quot;Saepe Nos&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Pecci |first=Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi |author-link=Pope Leo XIII |publisher=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_le13sn.htm |title=Sæpe nos |language=Latin}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that was addressed to all the Irish bishops. Of outstanding significance, not least for the English-speaking world, was Leo's encyclical ''[[Apostolicae curae]]'' on the invalidity of the Anglican orders, published in 1896. In 1899, he declared St [[Bede]] the Venerable a [[Doctor of the Church]].

====Bulgaria====
Leo XIII welcomed the elevation of Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg to the Bulgarian Principality in 1886. A fellow Catholic, whose wife is a member the Italian house of Bourbon-Parma, the two had a lot in common. However, relations between the two greatly soured when Ferdinand expressed his intentions to convert his eldest son Crown Prince Boris (later [[Tsar Boris III]]) to Orthodoxy, the majority religion of Bulgaria. Leo strongly condemned the action, and when Ferdinand went through with the conversion anyway, Leo excommunicated him.

====United States====
[[File:PapaleoXIII.jpg|thumb|right|170px|In 1889, Pope Leo XIII authorized the founding of [[The Catholic University of America]] in Washington, DC, and granted it Papal degrees in theology]]
The United States frequently attracted his attention and admiration. He confirmed the decrees of the [[Third Plenary Council of Baltimore]] (1884) and raised [[James Gibbons]], the archbishop of that city, to the cardinalate in 1886.

On 10 April 1887, a pontifical charter from Pope Leo XIII founded The Catholic University of America, establishing the national university of the Catholic Church in the United States.

American newspapers criticized Pope Leo because they claimed that he was attempting to gain control of American public schools.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} One cartoonist drew Leo as a fox unable to reach grapes that were labeled for American schools; the caption read &quot;Sour grapes!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criaimages.com/detail.aspx?img=0000037708c|title=CRIA: Commercial Research Image Archives|first=CRIA|last=LLC|website=www.criaimages.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brazil====
Pope Leo XIII is also remembered for the ''First Plenary Council of Latin America'' held at Rome in 1899, and for his encyclical of 1888 to the bishops of [[Brazil]], ''[[In plurimis]]'', on the [[slavery in Brazil|abolition of slavery]]. In 1897 he published the [[Apostolic Letter]] ''Trans Oceanum'', which dealt with the privileges and ecclesiastical structure of the Catholic Church in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/apost_letters/documents/hf_l-xiii_apl_18970418_trans-oceanum_lt.html |language=Latin |trans-title=Over the Ocean, Apostolic letter on Latin American privileges |title=Trans Oceanum, Litterae apostolicae, De privilegiis Americae Latinae |last=Pecci |first=Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi |author-link=Pope Leo XIII |publisher=Vatican |date=1897-04-18 |place=Rome, IT |accessdate= 23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chile====
During the [[War of the Pacific]], he gave the papal blessing to the [[Chile|Chilean]] troops on the eve of the [[Battle of Chorrillos]] in January 1881; after the battle, in the resulting chaos, there was extensive looting in the city from Chilean troops as well as Peruvians, with the Chileans carrying many old Bibles to their churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Tomas |last=Caivano |title=Historia de la guerra de América entre Chile, Perú y Bolivia |year=1907 |language=Spanish|trans-title=History of the American war between Chile, Peru and Bolivia}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, one year later, Chilean President [[Domingo Santa María]], a member of the [[Liberal Party (Chile, 1849)|Liberal Party]] in defiance of the opposition, the fiercely-Catholic [[Conservative Party (Chile)|Conservative Party]], issued the ''Leyes Laicas'' (Laic Laws), which reduced the faculties of the church over state and society, though it was not until 1925 that President [[Arturo Alessandri]], also from the Liberal Party separated the church from the state.
====India====
Pope Leo XIII urged  &quot;Filii tui India, administri tibi salutis&quot; (Your own sons, O India, will be the heralds of your salvation)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/articleDetail?nodeId=NODE06363041&lt;/ref&gt; and founded the national seminary, called [[Papal Seminary]]. He entrusted this task to the then Apostolic Delegae to Indian [[Ladislaus Michael Zaleski]], who founded the Seminary in 1893.

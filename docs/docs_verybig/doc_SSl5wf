==Solid electrolytes==
Solid electrolytes can be mostly divided into four groups:
* Gel electrolytes - closely resemble liquid electrolytes. In essence, they are liquids in a flexible [[crystal structure|lattice framework]]. Various [[Food additive|additive]]s are often applied to increase the [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]] of such systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kamil Perzyna, Regina Borkowska, Jaroslaw Syzdek, Aldona Zalewska, Wladyslaw Wieczorek 2011 58–65&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dry&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evworld.com/article.cfm?storyid=933 |title=The Roll-to-Roll Battery Revolution |publisher=Ev World |date= |accessdate=2010-08-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710210351/http://www.evworld.com/article.cfm?storyid=933 |archive-date=10 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dry polymer electrolytes - differ from liquid and gel electrolytes in the sense that salt is dissolved directly into the solid medium. Usually it is a relatively high [[dielectric]] constant [[polymer]] ([[polyethylene oxide|PEO]], [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|PMMA]], [[Polyacrylonitrile|PAN]], [[polyphosphazene]]s, [[siloxane]]s, etc.) and a salt with low [[lattice energy]]. In order to increase the [[mechanical strength]] and conductivity of such electrolytes, very often [[composite material|composites]] are used, and inert ceramic phase is introduced. There are two major classes of such electrolytes: polymer-in-ceramic, and ceramic-in-polymer.&lt;ref name=&quot;SyzdekBorkowska2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Syzdek J, Borkowska R, Perzyna K, Tarascon JM, Wieczorek W|title=Novel composite polymeric electrolytes with surface-modified inorganic fillers|journal=Journal of Power Sources|volume=173|issue=2|year=2007|pages=712–720|issn=0378-7753|doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.05.061|bibcode=2007JPS...173..712S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SyzdekArmand2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Syzdek J, Armand M, Marcinek M, Zalewska A, Żukowska G, Wieczorek W|title=Detailed studies on the fillers modification and their influence on composite, poly(oxyethylene)-based polymeric electrolytes|journal=Electrochimica Acta|volume=55|issue=4|year=2010|pages=1314–1322|issn=0013-4686|doi=10.1016/j.electacta.2009.04.025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SyzdekArmand2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Syzdek J, Armand M, Gizowska M, Marcinek M, Sasim E, Szafran M, Wieczorek W|title=Ceramic-in-polymer versus polymer-in-ceramic polymeric electrolytes—A novel approach|journal=Journal of Power Sources|volume=194|issue=1|year=2009|pages=66–72|issn=0378-7753|doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.070|bibcode=2009JPS...194...66S}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Solid ceramic electrolytes - [[ion]]s migrate through the ceramic phase by means of vacancies or [[interstitial compound|interstitials]] within the [[Crystal lattice|lattice]]. There are also glassy-ceramic electrolytes.
* Organic ionic plastic crystals - are a type [[salt (chemistry)|organic salts]] exhibiting [[mesophase]]s (i.e. a [[state of matter]] intermediate between liquid and solid), in which mobile ions are orientationally or rotationally disordered while their centers are located at the ordered sites in the crystal structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;1,2,4-Triazolium perfluorobutanesulfonate as an archetypal pure protic organic ionic plastic crystal electrolyte for all-solid-state fuel cells&quot;/&gt; They have various forms of disorder due to one or more solid–solid [[phase transition]]s below the [[melting point]] and have therefore [[Plasticity (physics)|plastic]] properties and good mechanical flexibility as well as improved electrode|electrolyte interfacial contact.

'''Caterpillars''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|t|ər|ˌ|p|ɪ|l|ər}} are the [[larva|larval stage]] of members of the order [[Lepidoptera]] (the insect order comprising [[butterfly|butterflies]] and [[moth]]s).

As with most common names, the application of the word is arbitrary, since the larvae of [[sawfly|sawflies]] are commonly called caterpillars as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ormerod1892&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Eleanor Anne Ormerod|title=A Text-Book of Agricultural Entomology: Being a Guide to Methods of Insect Life and Means of Prevention of Insect Ravage for the Use of Agriculturists and Agricultural Students|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2KUcAQAAMAAJ|year=1892|publisher=Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson1960&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger Fabian Anderson|title=Forest and Shade Tree Entomology|url=https://archive.org/details/forestshadetreee0000ande|url-access=registration|date=January 1960|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-471-02739-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both lepidopteran and symphytan larvae have [[eruciform]] body shapes.

Caterpillars of most species are [[herbivore|herbivorous]] ([[Folivore|folivorous]]), but not all; some (about 1%) are [[insectivore|insectivorous]], even cannibalistic. Some feed on other animal products; for example, [[clothes moth]]s feed on wool, and [[Ceratophaga vastella|horn moths]] feed on the hooves and horns of dead [[ungulate]]s.

Caterpillars are typically voracious feeders and many of them are among the most serious of [[Agriculture|agricultural]] [[Pest (organism)|pests]]. In fact many moth [[species]] are best known in their caterpillar stages because of the damage they cause to fruits and other agricultural produce, whereas the moths are obscure and do no direct harm. Conversely, various species of caterpillar are valued as sources of silk, as human or animal food, or for biological control of pest plants.

== Etymology ==

The origins of the word &quot;caterpillar&quot; date from the early 16th century. They derive from [[Middle English]] ''catirpel'', ''catirpeller'', probably an alteration of [[Old French|Old North French]] ''catepelose'': ''cate'', cat (from Latin ''cattus'') + ''pelose'', hairy (from Latin ''pilōsus'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/caterpillar &quot;Caterpillar&quot;]. Dictionary.com. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004. (accessed: March 26, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

The inchworm, or looper caterpillars from the family [[Geometridae]] are so named because of the way they move, appearing to measure the earth (the word ''geometrid'' means ''earth-measurer'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]);&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Geometridae.&quot; Merriam-Webster.com. Merriam-Webster, n.d. Web. 19 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; the primary reason for this unusual locomotion is the elimination of nearly all the [[proleg]]s except the clasper on the terminal segment.[[File:Geometridae.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Geometridae|geometrid]] caterpillar or inchworm]]

== Description ==
[[File:Crochets.jpg|thumb|upright|Crochets on a caterpillar's prolegs]]
[[File:Craesus septentrionalis.jpg|thumb|Larvae of ''[[Craesus septentrionalis]]'', a [[sawfly]] showing six pairs of prolegs.]]

Caterpillars have soft bodies that can grow rapidly between moults. Their size varies between species and [[instar]]s (moults) from as small as 1&amp;nbsp;mm up to 14&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/bfly/regal_moth.htm|title=Featured Creatures: hickory horned devil, ''Citheronia regalis''|last=Hall|first=Donald W.|date=September 2014|website=University of Florida, Entomology and Nematology Department|access-date=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some larvae of the order [[Hymenoptera]] (ants, bees and wasps) can appear like the caterpillars of the Lepidoptera. Such larvae are mainly seen in the [[sawfly]] suborder. However while these larvae superficially resemble caterpillars, they can be distinguished by the presence of [[proleg]]s on every abdominal segment, an absence of crochets or hooks on the prolegs (these are present on lepidopteran caterpillars), one pair of prominent [[ocelli]] on the head capsule, and an absence of the upside-down Y-shaped [[suture (anatomical)|suture]] on the front of the head.&lt;ref name=&quot;scoble&quot;&gt;Scoble, MJ. 1995.

Lepidopteran caterpillars can be differentiated from sawfly larvae by:
* the numbers of pairs of pro-legs; sawfly larvae have 6 or more pairs while caterpillars have a maximum of 5 pairs.
* the number of [[Simple eye in invertebrates#Stemmata|stemmata]] (simple eyes); the sawfly larvae have only two,&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer-Rochow 1974&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meyer-Rochow |first=Victor Benno |title=Structure and function of the larval eye of the sawfly Perga |journal=[[Journal of Insect Physiology]] |year=1974 |volume=20 |issue=8 |pages=1565–1591 |doi=10.1016/0022-1910(74)90087-0 |pmid=4854430}}&lt;/ref&gt; while caterpillars usually have twelve (six each side of the head).
* the presence of crochets on the prolegs; these are absent in the sawflies.
* sawfly larvae have an invariably smooth head capsule with no cleavage lines, while lepidopterous caterpillars bear an inverted &quot;Y&quot; or &quot;V&quot; (adfrontal suture).

== Defenses ==

[[File:Acharia stimulea 0795036.jpg|thumb|left|The [[saddleback caterpillar]] has [[urticating hair]] and [[aposematism|aposematic colouring]].]]

Many animals feed on caterpillars as they are rich in protein. As a result, caterpillars have evolved various means of defense.

Caterpillars have evolved defenses against physical conditions such as cold, hot or dry environmental conditions. Some Arctic species like ''[[Gynaephora groenlandica]]'' have special basking and aggregation behaviours&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kukal, O. |author2=B. Heinrich |author3=J. G. Duman  |name-list-style=amp |year=1988|title=Behavioral thermoregulation in the freeze-tolerant arctic caterpillar, ''Gynaeophora groenlandica''|journal=J. Exp. Biol.|volume=138|pages=181–193|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/abstract/138/1/181|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; apart from physiological adaptations to remain in a dormant state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bennett, V.

=== Appearance ===

[[File:Hairy caterpillar (Costa Rica).jpg|thumb|[[Costa Rica]]n hairy caterpillar. The spiny bristles are a self-defense mechanism]]

The appearance of a caterpillar can often repel a predator: its markings and certain body parts can make it seem poisonous, or bigger in size and thus threatening, or non-edible. Some types of caterpillars are indeed poisonous or distasteful and their bright coloring is [[Aposematism|aposematic]]. Others may [[Mimicry|mimic]] dangerous caterpillars or other animals while not being dangerous themselves. Many caterpillars are [[crypsis|cryptically]] colored and resemble the plants on which they feed. An example of caterpillars that use camouflage for defence is the species ''[[Nemoria arizonaria]]''. If the caterpillars hatch in the spring and feed on oak catkins they appear green. If they hatch in the summer they appear dark colored, like oak twigs. The differential development is linked to the tannin content in the diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greene|first1=E|year=1989|title=A Diet-Induced Developmental Polymorphism in a Caterpillar|journal=Science|volume=243|issue=4891|pages=643–646|bibcode=1989Sci...243..643G|doi=10.1126/science.243.4891.643|pmid=17834231|url=http://courses.biology.utah.edu/feener/5445/Readings/Lecture%2018/Greene%201989.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.462.1931|s2cid=23249256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caterpillars may even have spines or growths that resemble plant parts such as thorns. Some look like objects in the environment such as bird droppings. Some [[Geometridae]] cover themselves in plant parts, while [[bagworm]]s construct and live in a bag covered in sand, pebbles or plant material.

=== Chemical defenses ===

More aggressive self-defense measures are taken by some caterpillars. These measures include having spiny bristles or long fine hair-like [[seta]]e with detachable tips that will irritate by lodging in the skin or mucous membranes.&lt;ref name=&quot;scoble&quot;/&gt; However some birds (such as [[cuckoo]]s) will swallow even the hairiest of caterpillars. Other caterpillars acquire toxins from their host plants that render them unpalatable to most of their predators. For instance, [[Utetheisa ornatrix|ornate moth]] caterpillars utilize [[pyrrolizidine alkaloids]] that they obtain from their food plants to deter predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dussourd | first1 = D. E. | year = 1988 | title = Biparental Defensive Endowment of Eggs with Acquired Plant Alkaloid in the Moth ''Utetheisa ornatrix'' | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 85 | issue = 16| pages = 5992–996 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.85.16.5992 | pmid = 3413071 | pmc = 281891 | bibcode = 1988PNAS...85.5992D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most aggressive caterpillar defenses are bristles associated with [[venom]] glands. These bristles are called [[urticating hair]]s. A venom which is among the most potent defensive chemicals in any animal is produced by the South American [[Saturniidae|silk moth]] genus ''[[Lonomia]]''. Its venom is an [[anticoagulant]] powerful enough to cause a human to [[hemorrhage]] to death (See [[Lonomia]]sis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Malaque, Ceila M. S. |author2=Lúcia Andrade |author3=Geraldine Madalosso |author4=Sandra Tomy |author5=Flávio L. Tavares |author6=Antonio C.

Most urticating hairs range in effect from mild irritation to [[dermatitis]]. Example: [[brown-tail moth]].

[[File:Papilio cresphontes larva defensive.JPG|thumb|left|[[Giant swallowtail]] caterpillar everting its [[osmeterium]] in defense]]

Plants contain toxins which protect them from herbivores, but some caterpillars have evolved countermeasures which enable them to eat the leaves of such toxic plants. In addition to being unaffected by the poison, the caterpillars [[wikt:sequester|sequester]] it in their body, making them highly toxic to predators. The chemicals are also carried on into the adult stages. These toxic species, such as the [[cinnabar moth]] (''Tyria jacobaeae'') and monarch (''[[Danaus plexippus]]'') caterpillars, usually advertise themselves with the danger colors of red, yellow and black, often in bright stripes (see [[aposematism]]). Any predator that attempts to eat a caterpillar with an aggressive defense mechanism will learn and avoid future attempts.

Some caterpillars regurgitate acidic digestive juices at attacking enemies. Many [[Papilionidae|papilionid]] larvae produce bad smells from extrudable glands called [[osmeterium|osmeteria]].

=== Defensive behaviors ===
[[File:Chenilles_processionnaires_(14).JPG|thumb|Caterpillars linked together into a &quot;train&quot;]]
Many caterpillars display feeding behaviors which allow the caterpillar to remain hidden from potential predators. Many feed in protected environments, such as enclosed inside silk galleries, rolled leaves or by [[leaf miner|mining]] between the leaf surfaces.

Some caterpillars, like early instars of the [[tomato hornworm]] and [[tobacco hornworm]], have long &quot;whip-like&quot; organs attached to the ends of their body. The caterpillar wiggles these organs to frighten away flies and predatory wasps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Darby|first = Gene|title = What is a Butterfly|publisher = Benefic Press|location = Chicago|year = 1958|page = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some caterpillars can evade predators by using a silk line and dropping off from branches when disturbed. Many species thrash about violently when disturbed to scare away potential predators. One species (''[[Amorpha juglandis]]'') even makes high pitched whistles that can scare away birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bura | first1 = V. L. | last2 = Rohwer | first2 = V.

=== Social behaviors and relationships with other insects ===

Some caterpillars obtain protection by associating themselves with [[ant]]s. The [[Lycaenidae|Lycaenid]] butterflies are particularly well known for this. They communicate with their ant protectors by vibrations as well as chemical means and typically provide food rewards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://australian.museum/learn/animals/insects/lycaenid-butterflies-and-ants/ Lycaenid butterflies and ants]. Australian museum (2009-10-14). Retrieved on 2012-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some caterpillars are [[gregarious]]; large aggregations are believed to help in reducing the levels of parasitization and predation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Entry, Grant L. G. |author2=Lee A. Dyer.|s2cid=14389136|year=2002|title=On the Conditional Nature Of Neotropical Caterpillar Defenses against their Natural Enemies|jstor=3071846|journal= Ecology|volume=83|issue=11|pages=3108–3119|doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[3108:OTCNON]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clusters amplify the signal of aposematic coloration, and individuals may participate in group regurgitation or displays. [[Pine processionary]] (''Thaumetopoea pityocampa'') caterpillars often link into a long train to move through trees and over the ground. The head of the lead caterpillar is visible, but the other heads can appear hidden.&lt;ref name=&quot;fitzgerald&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.cortland.edu/fitzgerald/PineProcessionary.html|title=Pine Processionary Caterpillar|author=Terrence Fitzgerald|publisher=Web.cortland.edu|access-date=2013-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Forest tent caterpillar moth|Forest tent caterpillars]] cluster during periods of cold weather.

=== Predators ===

Caterpillars suffer predation from many animals. The [[European pied flycatcher]] is one species that preys upon caterpillars. The flycatcher typically finds caterpillars among oak foliage. [[Paper wasp]]s, including those in the genus'' [[Polistes]]'' and ''[[Polybia]]'' catch caterpillars to feed their young and themselves.

== Behavior ==
[[File:Pasture day moth caterpillar closeup.jpg|thumb|A [[pasture day moth]] caterpillar feeding on capeweed]]

Caterpillars have been called &quot;eating machines&quot;, and eat leaves voraciously. Most species shed their [[skin]] four or five times as their bodies grow, and they eventually enter a [[pupa]]l stage before becoming adults.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scienceprojectlab.com/monarch-butterfly.html Monarch Butterfly]. Scienceprojectlab.com. Retrieved on 2012-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Caterpillars grow very quickly; for instance, a [[tobacco hornworm]] will increase its weight ten-thousandfold in less than twenty days. An adaptation that enables them to eat so much is a mechanism in a specialized midgut that quickly transports ions to the lumen (midgut cavity), to keep the potassium level higher in the midgut cavity than in the [[hemolymph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Chamberlin, M.E.  |author2=M.E.

Most caterpillars are solely [[herbivore|herbivorous]]. Many are restricted to feeding on one species of plant, while others are polyphagous. Some, including the [[clothes moth]], feed on [[detritus]]. Some are predatory, and may prey on other species of caterpillars (e.g. Hawaiian ''[[Eupithecia]]''). Others feed on eggs of other insects, aphids, scale insects, or ant larvae. A few are parasitic on cicadas or leaf hoppers ([[Epipyropidae]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;pierce&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pierce, N.E.|year=1995|title=Predatory and parasitic Lepidoptera: Carnivores living on plants|url=http://images.peabody.yale.edu/lepsoc/jls/1990s/1995/1995-49(4)412-Pierce.pdf|journal=Journal of the Lepidopterists' Society|volume= 49|issue=4|pages= 412–453}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Hawaiian caterpillars (''[[Hyposmocoma molluscivora]]'') use silk traps to capture snails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1110397|pmid=16040699|year=2005|last1=Rubinoff|first1=Daniel|last2=Haines|first2=William P.|title=Web-spinning caterpillar stalks snails|volume=309|issue=5734|page=575|journal=Science|s2cid=42604851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many caterpillars are nocturnal. For example, the &quot;cutworms&quot; (of the family [[Noctuidae]]) hide at the base of plants during the day and only feed at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=USGS|url=http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/insects/catnw/ecol.htm|title=Caterpillars of Pacific Northwest Forests and Woodlands}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as gypsy moth ([[Lymantria dispar]]) larvae, change their activity patterns depending on density and larval stage, with more diurnal feeding in early instars and high densities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2311.1987.tb01005.x|title=Behaviour of late-instar gypsy moth larvae in high and low density populations|year=1987|last1=Lance|first1=D.

Caterpillars cause much damage, mainly by eating leaves. The propensity for damage is enhanced by [[monoculture|monocultural]] farming practices, especially where the caterpillar is specifically adapted to the host plant under cultivation. The [[cotton bollworm]] causes enormous losses. Other species eat food crops. Caterpillars have been the target of [[pest control]] through the use of [[pesticide]]s, [[biological control]] and [[agronomy|agronomic]] practices. Many species have become resistant to [[pesticide]]s. Bacterial toxins such as those from ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' which are evolved to affect the gut of Lepidoptera have been used in sprays of bacterial spores, toxin extracts and also by incorporating genes to produce them within the host plants. These approaches are defeated over time by the evolution of resistance mechanisms in the insects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/7111.html Tent Caterpillars and Gypsy Moths]. Dec.ny.gov. Retrieved on 2012-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants evolve mechanisms of resistance to being eaten by caterpillars, including the evolution of chemical toxins and physical barriers such as hairs. Incorporating [[Plant defense against herbivory|host plant resistance]] (HPR) through plant breeding is another approach used in reducing the impact of caterpillars on crop plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Transgenic Host Plant Resistance to Insects—Some Reservations|author1=van Emden |author2=H.

Some caterpillars are used in industry. The [[silk]] industry is based on the [[bombyx mori|silkworm]] caterpillar.

Caterpillar hair can be a cause of human health problems. Caterpillar hairs sometimes have venoms in them and species from approximately 12 families of moths or butterflies worldwide can inflict serious human injuries ranging from [[urticaria]]l dermatitis and [[atopic]] [[asthma]] to [[osteochondritis]], consumption [[coagulopathy]], [[kidney failure]], and [[brain]] [[hemorrhage|bleeding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Diaz, HJ|year=2005|title=The evolving global epidemiology, syndromic classification, management, and prevention of caterpillar envenoming|pmid=15772333|journal=Am.

Caterpillar hair has also been known to cause [[keratin|kerato]]-[[conjunctivitis]]. The sharp barbs on the end of caterpillar hairs can get lodged in soft tissues and [[mucous membrane]]s such as the eyes. Once they enter such tissues, they can be difficult to extract, often exacerbating the problem as they migrate across the membrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Patel RJ, Shanbhag RM |title= Ophthalmia nodosa – (a case report)|url=http://www.ijo.in/article.asp?issn=0301-4738;year=1973;volume=21;issue=4;spage=208;epage=208;aulast=Patel|journal= Indian J Ophthalmol|year=1973|volume=21|page=208|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

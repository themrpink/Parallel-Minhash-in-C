After the launching of two new satellites and maintenance of two others, the full capacity of the satellite group was restored.

=== Accuracy ===
The GLONASS accuracy is up to 2.8 metres, in comparison with GPS using the L5, which has accuracy of within {{cvt|30|cm}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/9/25/16362296/gps-accuracy-improving-one-foot-broadcom|title=GPS will be accurate within one foot in some phones next year|publisher=The Verge|access-date=2018-01-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118113646/https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/9/25/16362296/gps-accuracy-improving-one-foot-broadcom|archive-date=18 January 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/design/superaccurate-gps-chips-coming-to-smartphones-in-2018|title=Superaccurate GPS Chips Coming to Smartphones in 2018|website=IEEE Spectrum: Technology, Engineering, and Science News|access-date=2018-01-17|date=2017-09-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118011412/https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/design/superaccurate-gps-chips-coming-to-smartphones-in-2018|archive-date=18 January 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Russian System of Differentional Correction and Monitoring's data, {{as of|2010|lc=on}}, precision of GLONASS navigation definitions (for p=0.95) for latitude and longitude were {{cvt|4.46|–|7.38|m}} with mean number of navigation space vehicles (NSV) equals 7—8 (depending on station). In comparison, the same time precision of GPS [[navigation]] definitions were {{cvt|2.00|–|8.76|m}} with mean number of NSV equals 6—11 (depending on station). Civilian GLONASS used alone is therefore very slightly less accurate than [[GPS]]. On high latitudes (north or south), GLONASS' accuracy is better than that of GPS due to the orbital position of the satellites.&lt;ref name=&quot;mt_swepos&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/first-foreign-firm-embraces-glonass/434850.html|title=First Foreign Firm Embraces Glonass|newspaper=The Moscow Times|date=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern receivers are able to use both GLONASS and GPS satellites together, providing greatly improved coverage in urban canyons and giving a very fast time to fix due to over 50 satellites being available. In indoor, urban canyon or mountainous areas, accuracy can be greatly improved over using GPS alone. For using both navigation systems simultaneously, precision of GLONASS/GPS navigation definitions were {{cvt|2.37|–|4.65|m}} with mean number of NSV equals 14—19 (depends on station).

In May 2009, [[Anatoly Perminov]], then director of the [[Roscosmos]], stated that actions were undertaken to expand GLONASS's constellation and to improve the [[ground segment]] to increase the navigation definition of GLONASS to an accuracy of {{cvt|2.8|m}} by 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;pr_rianscience&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rian.ru/science/20090512/170848130.html|title=Роскосмос обещает повысить точность работы ГЛОНАСС с 10 до 5,5 метров|publisher=РИА Новости|access-date=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the latest satellite design, [[GLONASS-K]] has the ability to double the system's accuracy once introduced. The system's ground segment is also to undergo improvements. As of early 2012, sixteen positioning ground stations are under construction in [[Russia]] and in the [[Antarctic]] at the [[Bellingshausen Station |Bellingshausen]] and [[Novolazarevskaya Station|Novolazarevskaya]] bases. New stations will be built around the southern hemisphere from [[Brazil]] to [[Indonesia]]. Together, these improvements are expected to bring GLONASS' accuracy to 0.6 m or better by 2020.&lt;ref name=&quot;kramnik_feb2012&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rbth.ru/articles/2012/02/16/glonass_benefits_worth_the_extra_expense_14862.html|title=GLONASS benefits worth the extra expense|last1=Kramnik|first1=Ilya|newspaper=Russia Beyond the Headlines|date=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The setup of a GLONASS receiving station in the [[Philippines]] is also now under negotiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DOST Finalizes MOU with Russian Space Agency|url=https://www.dfa.gov.ph/dfa-news/news-from-our-foreign-service-postsupdate/17790-dost-finalizes-mou-with-russian-space-agency|access-date=24 September 2018|publisher=Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|date=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inception and design ===
[[File:Glonass.gif|thumb|290px|A GLONASS satellite]]

The first satellite-based radio [[navigation system]] developed in the Soviet Union was [[Tsiklon (satellite)|Tsiklon]], which had the purpose of providing [[ballistic missile submarine]]s a method for accurate positioning. 31 Tsiklon satellites were launched between 1967 and 1978. The main problem with the system was that, although highly accurate for stationary or slow-moving ships, it required several hours of observation by the receiving station to fix a position, making it unusable for many navigation purposes and for the guidance of the new generation of ballistic missiles.&lt;ref name=&quot;astronautix_tsiklon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/tsiklon.htm|title=Tsiklon|publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628182723/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/tsiklon.htm|archive-date=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968–1969, a new navigation system, which would support not only the navy, but also the air, land and space forces, was conceived. Formal requirements were completed in 1970; in 1976, the government made a decision to launch development of the &quot;Unified Space Navigation System GLONASS&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;astronautix_glonass&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/glonass.htm|title=Glonass|publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129132654/http://astronautix.com/craft/glonass.htm|archive-date=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The task of designing GLONASS was given to a group of young specialists at [[Information Satellite Systems Reshetnev|NPO PM]] in the city of Krasnoyarsk-26 (today called [[Zheleznogorsk, Krasnoyarsk Krai|Zheleznogorsk]]). Under the leadership of [[Vladimir Cheremisin]], they developed different proposals, from which the institute's director [[Grigory Chernyavsky]] selected the final one. The work was completed in the late 1970s; the system consists of 24 satellites operating at an altitude of {{cvt|20000|km}} in medium circular orbit. It would be able to promptly fix the receiving station's position based on signals from four satellites, and also reveal the object's speed and direction. The satellites would be launched three at a time on the heavy-lift [[Proton (rocket family)|Proton]] rocket. Due to the large number of satellites needed for the program, NPO PM delegated the manufacturing of the satellites to [[Production Corporation Polyot|PO Polyot]] in [[Omsk]], which had better production capabilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;iss_glonass_history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iss-reshetnev.com/images/File/magazin/2007/m2-screen_en.pdf|title=Start of GLONASS|publisher=ISS Reshetnev|year=2007|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713063606/http://www.iss-reshetnev.com/images/File/magazin/2007/m2-screen_en.pdf|archive-date=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;iss_magazine8&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iss-reshetnev.com/images/File/magazin/2009/m8-screen_en.pdf|title=Satellite Navigation of the 21st Century|publisher=ISS Reshetnev|year=2009|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121215653/http://www.iss-reshetnev.com/images/File/magazin/2009/m8-screen_en.pdf|archive-date=21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, GLONASS was designed to have an accuracy of {{cvt|65|m}}, but in reality it had an accuracy of {{cvt|20|m}} in the civilian signal and {{cvt|10|m}} in the military signal.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvey_military&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=Brian|title=The Rebirth of the Russian Space Program|publisher=Springer|location=Germany|year=2007|edition=1st|chapter=Military programs|isbn=978-0-387-71354-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[GLONASS (satellite)|first generation]] GLONASS satellites were {{cvt|7.8|m}} tall, had a width of {{cvt|7.2|m}}, measured across their solar panels, and a mass of {{cvt|1260|kg}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvey_military&quot;/&gt;

=== Achieving full orbital constellation ===
In the early 1980s, [[Information Satellite Systems Reshetnev|NPO PM]] received the first prototype satellites from [[Production Corporation Polyot|PO Polyot]] for ground tests. Many of the produced parts were of low quality and NPO PM engineers had to perform substantial redesigning, leading to a delay.&lt;ref name=&quot;iss_glonass_history&quot;/&gt; On 12 October 1982, three satellites, designated [[Kosmos-1413]], [[Kosmos-1414]], and [[Kosmos-1415]] were launched aboard a [[Proton (rocket family)|Proton]] [[launch vehicle]]. As only one GLONASS satellite was ready in time for the launch instead of the expected three, it was decided to launch it along with two mock-ups. The United States media reported the event as a launch of one satellite and &quot;two secret objects&quot;. For a long time, the United States could not find out the nature of those &quot;objects&quot;. The [[TASS|Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union]] (TASS) covered the launch, describing GLONASS as a system &quot;created to determine the positioning of civil aviation aircraft, navy transport and fishing-boats of the Soviet Union&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;iss_glonass_history&quot;/&gt;

From 1982 to April 1991, the Soviet Union successfully launched a total of 43 GLONASS-related satellites plus five test satellites. When the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union disintegrated]] on 25 December 1991, twelve GLONASS satellites in two planes were operational; enough to allow limited use of the system (to cover the entire territory of the Union, 18 satellites would have been necessary). The [[Russia|Russian Federation]] took over control of the constellation and continued its development.&lt;ref name=&quot;iss_magazine8&quot;/&gt; GLONASS became operational in the year 1993 with 12 satellites in 2 orbits at the height of 19,130 km. The United States [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] system has achieved full operation а year later. In December 1995, the GLONASS constellation was increased to 24 satellites. At present, there are a total of 27 satellites in orbit, and all are operational.

=== Economic crisis ===
Since the first generation satellites operated for three years each, to keep the system at full capacity, two launches per year would have been necessary to maintain the full network of 24 satellites. However, in the financially difficult period of 1989–1999, the space program's funding was cut by 80% and Russia consequently found itself unable to afford this launch rate. After the full complement was achieved in December 1995, there were no further launches until December 1999. As a result, the constellation reached its lowest point of just six operational satellites in 2001. As a prelude to demilitarisation, responsibility of the program was transferred from the [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)|Ministry of Defence]] to Russia's civilian space agency [[Roscosmos]].&lt;ref name=&quot;harvey_military&quot;/&gt;

=== Renewed efforts and modernization ===
[[File:Putin Glonass navigator.jpg|thumb|290px|right|President [[Vladimir Putin]] inspects a GLONASS car navigation device. As President, Putin paid special attention to the development of GLONASS.]]

In the 2000s, the Russian economy recovered and state finances improved considerably. [[Vladimir Putin]] took a special interest in GLONASS&lt;ref name=&quot;harvey_military&quot;/&gt; and the system's restoration was made one of the government's top priorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;moskvitch&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8595704.stm|title=Glonass: Has Russia's sat-nav system come of age?|publisher=BBC News|date=2010-04-02 |first=Katia|last=Moskvitch}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this purpose, in August 2001, the Federal Targeted Program &quot;Global Navigation System&quot; 2002–2011 (Government Decision No.587) was launched. The program was given a budget of US$420 million&lt;ref&gt;[http://rt.com/news/sci-tech/glonass-wants-system-gps/ Glonass still wants to be &quot;the other guy in the sky] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213050452/http://rt.com/news/sci-tech/glonass-wants-system-gps/|date=13 February 2011}}, RT, 6 December 2010, Retrieved on 6 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and aimed at restoring the full constellation by 2009.

On 10 December 2003, the second generation satellite design, [[GLONASS-M]], was launched for the first time. It had a slightly larger mass than the baseline GLONASS, standing at {{cvt|1415|kg}}, but it had seven years lifetime, four years longer than the lifetime of the original GLONASS satellite, decreasing the required replacement rate. The new satellite also had better accuracy and ability to broadcast two extra civilian signals.

In 2006, Defense Minister [[Sergei Ivanov]] ordered one of the signals (with an accuracy of {{cvt|30|m}}) to be made available to civilian users. Putin, however, was not satisfied with this, and demanded that the whole system should be made fully available to everyone. Consequently, on 18 May 2007, all restrictions were lifted.&lt;ref name=&quot;rian_made_available&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rian_2006&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20061113/55588641.html|title=Russia to lift Glonass restrictions for accurate civilian use|publisher=RIA Novosti|date=2006-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accurate, formerly military-only signal with a precision of {{cvt|10|m}}, has since then been freely available to civilian users.

During the middle of the first decade of the 21st century, the Russian economy boomed, resulting in substantial increases in the country's space budget. In 2007, the financing of the GLONASS program was increased considerably; its budget was more than doubled. While in 2006 the GLONASS had received US$181 million from the federal budget, in 2007 the amount was increased to US$380 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;rian_made_available&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/science/20070518/65725503.html|title=Putin makes Glonass navigation system free for customers|publisher=RIA Novosti|date=2007-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, 140.1 billion rubles (US$4.7 billion) were spent on the program 2001–2011, making it Roscosmos' largest project and consuming a third of its 2010 budget of 84.5 billion rubles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rbth.ru/articles/2010/12/07/glonass_hits_a_snag05184.html GLONASS hits a snag], ''Russia Beyond The Headlines'', 7 December 2010, Retrieved on 6 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

For the period of 2012 to 2020 320 billion rubles (US$10 billion) were allocated to support the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iss-reshetnev.ru/images/File/newspaper/2012/318.pdf|title=Работа в интересах развития ГЛОНАСС|trans-title=Work for the development of GLONASS|date=2012-09-14|issue=No.30(318)|publisher=Сибирский спутник [Siberian Satellite]|page=3|access-date=2013-05-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021015044/http://www.iss-reshetnev.ru/images/File/newspaper/2012/318.pdf|archive-date=21 October 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Restoring full capacity ===
In June 2008, the system consisted of 16 satellites, 12 of which were fully operational at the time. At this point, Roscosmos aimed at having a full constellation of 24 satellites in orbit by 2010, one year later than previously planned.&lt;ref name=&quot;rian_june2008&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20080607/109483418.html|title=Russia's Glonass satellite system to be fully operational in 2010|publisher=RIA Novosti|date=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]] signed a decree allocating additional 67 billion rubles (US$2.6 billion) to GLONASS from the federal budget.&lt;ref name=&quot;rian_september2008&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20080912/116749330.html|title=Putin orders additional $2.6 bln on Glonass development|publisher=RIA Novosti|date=2008-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Promoting commercial use ====
Although the GLONASS constellation has reached global coverage, its commercialisation, especially development of the user segment, has been lacking compared to the American GPS. For example, the first commercial Russian-made GLONASS navigation device for cars, [[Glospace SGK-70]], was introduced in 2007, but it was much bigger and costlier than similar GPS receivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;moskvitch&quot;/&gt; In late 2010, there were only a handful of GLONASS receivers on the market, and few of them were meant for ordinary consumers. To improve the situation, the Russian government has been actively promoting GLONASS for civilian use.&lt;ref name=&quot;rt_dec2010&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rt.com/news/sci-tech/glonass-wants-system-gps/|title=Glonass still wants to be &quot;the other guy in the sky&quot;|publisher=Russia Today|date=2010-12-07|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213050452/http://rt.com/news/sci-tech/glonass-wants-system-gps/|archive-date=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To improve development of the user segment, on 11 August 2010, [[Sergei Ivanov]] announced a plan to introduce a 25% import duty on all GPS-capable devices, including mobile phones, unless they are compatible with GLONASS. The government also planned to force all car manufacturers in Russia to support GLONASS starting from 2011. This would affect all car makers, including foreign brands like [[Ford]] and [[Toyota]], which have car assembly facilities in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://top.rbc.ru/economics/27/10/2010/488865.shtml|script-title=ru:Сотовые и навигаторы без ГЛОНАСС обложат пошлиной в 25%|trans-title=Non-GLONASS-capable mobiles and satnavs will incur 25% duty|publisher=RBC Information Systems|date=2010-10-27|access-date=2010-10-27|language=Russian|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028114025/http://top.rbc.ru/economics/27/10/2010/488865.shtml|archive-date=28 October 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Sweden's [[SWEPOS]] — a national network of satellite reference stations that provides real-time positioning data with metre accuracy — became the first known foreign company to use GLONASS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/11/us-russia-sweden-glonass-idUSTRE73A1S320110411|title=Swedish firm starts using Russian satnav|agency=Reuters|date=2011-04-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102000852/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/11/us-russia-sweden-glonass-idUSTRE73A1S320110411|archive-date=2 January 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Smartphone|Smartphones]] and [[Tablet computer|tablets]] also saw implementation of GLONASS support in 2011 with devices released that year from [[Xiaomi|Xiaomi Tech Company]] ([[Xiaomi Phone 2]]), [[Sony Ericsson]], [[Samsung]] ([[Samsung Galaxy Note series|Galaxy Note]], [[Samsung Galaxy Note II]], [[Samsung Galaxy S II|Galaxy SII]], [[Samsung Galaxy S III Mini|Galaxy SIII mini]], the [[Google]] [[Nexus 10]] in late 2012), [[Asus]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] ([[iPhone 4S]] and [[iPad Mini]] in late 2012), [[HTC]] and [[Sony Mobile]] adding support for the system allowing increased accuracy and lock on speed in difficult conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://developer.sonyericsson.com/wp/2012/01/19/glonass-support-in-our-latest-xperia-phones/ GLONASS support in our latest Xperia™ phones – Developer World] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124011342/http://developer.sonyericsson.com/wp/2012/01/19/glonass-support-in-our-latest-xperia-phones/|date=24 January 2012}}, developer.sonyericsson.com, Retrieved on 2 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samsung.com/global/microsite/galaxynote/note/spec.html Samsung GALAXY Note], samsung.com, Retrieved on 2 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.apple.com/iphone/specs.html iPhone 5 - View all the technical specifications], apple.com, Retrieved on 2 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Finishing the constellation ====
Russia's aim of finishing the constellation in 2010 suffered a setback when a December 2010 launch of three GLONASS-M satellites failed. The [[Proton-M]] rocket itself performed flawlessly, but the upper stage [[Blok D]]-M3 (a new version that was to make its maiden flight) was loaded with too much fuel due to a sensor failure. As a result, the upper stage and the three satellites crashed into the Pacific Ocean. [[Kommersant]] estimated that the launch failure cost up to US$160 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;rbth_glonass&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rbth.ru/articles/2010/12/07/glonass_hits_a_snag05184.html|title=GLONASS hits a snag |newspaper=Kommersant|date=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russian President]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] ordered a full audit of the entire program and an investigation into the failure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fred Weir&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Weir|first=Fred|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2010/1206/Russia-s-2-billion-project-to-rival-America-s-GPS-suffers-setback|title=Russia's US$2 billion project to rival America's GPS suffers setback|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|date=6 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the mishap, [[Roscosmos]] activated two reserve satellites and decided to make the first improved [[GLONASS-K]] satellite, to be launched in February 2011, part of the operational constellation instead of mainly for testing as was originally planned. This would bring the total number of satellites to 23, obtaining almost complete worldwide coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Perminov|first=Anatoly

In 2010, President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] ordered the government to prepare a new federal targeted program for GLONASS, covering the years 2012–2020; the original 2001 program was scheduled to end in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;rbth_glonass&quot;/&gt; 

On 22 June 2011, Roscosmos revealed that the agency was looking for a funding of 402 billion rubles (US$14.35 billion) for the program. The funds would be spent on maintaining the satellite constellation, on developing and maintaining navigational maps as well as on sponsoring supplemental technologies to make GLONASS more attractive to users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/glonass-asks-for-1435bln/439306.html|title=Glonass Asks for US$14.35Bln|newspaper=The Moscow Times|date=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 October 2011, the 24th satellite of the system, a GLONASS-M, was successfully launched from [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]] and is now in service.&lt;ref name=ntv&gt;[http://www.ntv.ru/novosti/241055/ GLONASS finally becomes global] [[NTV (Russia) |NTV]], 3 October 2011, {{in lang|ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made the GLONASS constellation fully restored, for the first time since 1995.&lt;ref name=ruvr&gt;[http://english.ruvr.ru/2011/10/03/58065478.html Russia restores its orbital GLONASS group – official], ''The Voice of Russia'', 3 October 2011, {{in lang|ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 November 2011, the [[Proton-M]] booster successfully put three GLONASS-M units in final orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itar-tass.com/en/c32/264486.html|title=TASS: Archive - 3 GLONASS satellites in final orbit|agency=TASS|access-date=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 November 2011, a [[Soyuz (rocket family) |Soyuz]] launch vehicle, launched from the [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]], placed a single GLONASS-M satellite into orbit into Plane 3.

On 26 April 2013, a single GLONASS-M satellite was delivered to the orbit by Soyuz rocket from Plesetsk Cosmodrome, restoring the constellation to 24 operational satellites, the minimum to provide global coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1304/26soyuz/|title=Third Soyuz launch in a week bolsters Glonass system|date=2013-04-26|access-date=2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 July 2013, a Proton-M rocket, carrying 3 GLONASS-M satellites, crashed during takeoff from Baikonur Cosmodrome. It veered off the course just after leaving the pad and plunged into the ground nose first. The rocket employed a DM-03 booster, for the first time since the December 2010 launch, when the vehicle had also failed, resulting in a loss of another 3 satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/proton_glonass49.html|title=Russia's Proton crashes with a trio of navigation satellites|date=2013-07-02|access-date=2013-07-02|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812040530/http://www.russianspaceweb.com/proton_glonass49.html|archive-date=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as of 2014, while the system was completed from technical point of view, the operational side was still not closed by the Ministry of Defense and its formal status was still &quot;in development&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;izvestia&quot;/&gt;

On 7 December 2015, the system was officially completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lenta.ru/news/2015/12/07/glonass/|title=Разработчики объявили о завершении создания ГЛОНАСС}}&lt;/ref&gt;

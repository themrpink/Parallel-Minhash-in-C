{{main|List of airport people mover systems}}

Many large international airports around the world feature people mover systems to transport passengers between terminals or within a terminal itself. Some people mover systems at airports connect with other [[public transport]]ation systems to allow passengers to travel into the airport's city.

A '''  ferry''' is a [[merchant vessel]] used to carry passengers, and sometimes vehicles and cargo, across a body of water. A passenger ferry with many stops, such as in [[Venice]], [[Italy]], is sometimes called a [[water bus]] or [[water taxi]].

Ferries form a part of the [[public transport]] systems of many waterside cities and islands, allowing direct transit between points at a [[capital cost]] much lower than [[bridge]]s or [[tunnel]]s. Ship connections of much larger distances (such as over long distances in water bodies like the [[Mediterranean Sea]]) may also be called ferry services, especially if they carry vehicles.

==History==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
===In ancient times===
The profession of the ferryman is embodied in [[Greek mythology]] in [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], the boatman who transported souls across the [[River Styx]] to the [[Greek underworld|Underworld]].

Speculation that a pair of [[ox]]en propelled a ship having a water wheel can be found in 4th century Roman literature &quot;''Anonymus De Rebus Bellicis''&quot;.  Though impractical, there is no reason why it could not work and such a ferry, modified by using horses, was used in Lake Champlain in 19th-century America.  See [[Experiment (horse powered boat)]].

==Notable services==
===Africa===
[[File:Bridge and deck of Gullbritt.jpg|alt=|thumb|M/S ''Gullbritt'' in the [[Gullmarn|Gullmar Fjord]] close to [[Lysekil]], [[Sweden]]. Sweden has a lot of these yellow ferries that are run by the [[Swedish Transport Administration]]. Almost all of them are free of charge.]]
{{Empty section|date=November 2019}}

===Europe===
The busiest seaway in the world, the [[English Channel]], connects Great Britain and mainland Europe, with ships sailing from the UK ports of [[Dover]], [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]], Poole,&lt;ref&gt; https://www.phc.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portsmouth]] and [[Plymouth]] to French ports, such as [[Calais]], [[Dunkirk]], [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], [[Roscoff]], [[Cherbourg-Octeville]], [[Caen]], [[St Malo]] and [[Le Havre]]. The busiest ferry route to France is the Dover to Calais crossing with approximately 9,168,000 passengers using the service in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.franceferrybooker.co.uk/news/ferry-to-france-statistics Ferry to France Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt; Ferries from Great Britain also sail to Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Ireland. Some ferries carry mainly tourist traffic, but most also carry freight, and some are exclusively for the use of freight lorries. In Britain, car-carrying ferries are sometimes referred to as [[RORO]] (roll-on, roll-off) for the ease by which vehicles can board and leave.

[[File:Silja Symphony Kustaanmiekka.jpg|thumb|{{MS|Silja Symphony}} leaving [[Helsinki]] via the Kustaanmiekka strait to the [[Baltic Sea]].]]
The busiest single ferry route in terms of the number of departures is across the northern part of [[Øresund]], between [[Helsingborg]], [[Scania]], [[Sweden]] and [[Elsinore]], [[Denmark]]. Before the [[Øresund bridge]] was opened in July 2000, car and &quot;car and train&quot; ferries departed up to seven times every hour. This has since been reduced, but a car ferry still departs from each harbor every 15 minutes during daytime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hhferries.se |title=in Swedish, &quot;Vi seglar var 15:e minut&quot; means &quot;We sail every 15 minutes&quot;|website=Hhferries.se|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The route is around {{convert|2.2|nmi}} and the crossing takes 22 minutes. Today, all ferries on this route are constructed so that they do not need to turn around in the harbors. This also means that the ferries lack stems and sterns, since the vessels sail in both directions. Starboard and port-side are dynamic, depending on the direction the ferry sails. Despite the short crossing, the ferries are equipped with restaurants (on three out of four ferries), cafeterias, and kiosks. Passengers without cars often make a double or triple return journey in the restaurants; for this, a single journey ticket is sufficient. Passenger and bicycle passenger tickets are inexpensive compared with longer routes.

Large [[cruiseferry|cruiseferries]] sail in the [[Baltic Sea]] between [[Finland]], [[Åland]], [[Sweden]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]] and from [[Italy]] to [[Sardinia]], [[Corsica]], [[Spain]] and [[Greece]]. In many ways, these ferries are like [[cruise ship]]s, but they can also carry hundreds of cars on car decks. Besides providing passenger and car transport across the sea, [[Baltic Sea cruise-ferries]] are a popular tourist destination unto themselves, with multiple restaurants, nightclubs, bars, shops and entertainment on board. Also many smaller ferries operate on domestic routes in Finland, Sweden and Estonia.

The south-west and southern parts of the Baltic Sea has several routes mainly for heavy traffic and cars. The ferry routes of [[Trelleborg]]-[[Rostock]], [[Trelleborg]]-[[Travemünde]], [[Trelleborg]]-[[Świnoujście]], [[Gedser]]-[[Rostock]], [[Gdynia]]-[[Karlskrona]], and [[Ystad]]-[[Świnoujście]] are all typical ''transports'' ferries. On the longer of these routes, simple cabins are available. The [[Rødby]]-[[Puttgarden]] route also transports day passenger trains between [[Copenhagen]] and [[Hamburg]], and on the [[Trelleborg]]-[[Sassnitz]] route, it also has capacities for the daily night trains between [[Berlin]] and [[Malmö]].

In [[Istanbul]], ferries connect the European and Asian shores of [[Bosphorus]], as well as [[Princes Islands]] and nearby coastal towns. In 2014, [[İDO]] transported 47 million passengers, the largest ferry system in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/may/28/istanbul-ferries-future-transport-new-york-london|title=Istanbul shows ferries have a future|first=Stephen|last=Starr|date=28 May 2015|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's shortest ferry line is the [[Ferry Lina]] In [[Töreboda]], [[Sweden]]. It takes around 20–25 seconds and is hand powered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2018-05-22|title=Göta Canal {{!}} 190 kilometres of boats, bikes and shrimp sandwiches|url=https://scanmagazine.co.uk/gota-canal-2/|access-date=2020-07-04|website=Scan Magazine|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Martinez|first=Helena|title=Färjan Lina|url=https://toreboda.se/Toreboda-kommun/Kultur--fritid/Turism/Farjan-Lina.html|access-date=2020-07-04|website=toreboda.se – Töreboda kommun|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

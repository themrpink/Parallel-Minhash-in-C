Organizations and companies typically manage employee performance over a formal 12-month period (otherwise known as the formal company performance period).

The results of performance management exercises are used in:
* Employee development planning to select the most appropriate and suitable development intervention to improve employees' knowledge, skills and behavior
* Factual basis for compensation and rewards (pay raise &amp; bonuses being the most common)
* Factual basis in consideration with other factors for mobility (Example: transfers and promotions)
Each year companies spend millions on their performance management systems. In order for performance management to be successful, businesses must continue to adapt their system to correct their current deficiencies. Some aspects may resonate more with employees compared to others (e.g., goal setting or performance bonuses)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kakkar|first=Shiva|last2=Dash|first2=Sanket|last3=Vohra|first3=Neharika|last4=Saha|first4=Surajit|date=2020-04-23|title=Engaging employees through effective performance management: an empirical examination|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/bij-10-2019-0440|journal=Benchmarking: An International Journal|volume=27|issue=5|pages=1843–1860|doi=10.1108/bij-10-2019-0440|issn=1463-5771}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Effective management will set up a performance management system that is distinctive and consistent. The goal is to continue to alter the system to have higher employee engagement and increase their employees’ performance at work. In turn, companies hope this results in less turnover and creates a better workplace environment.

In [[telecommunication]], '''performance measurement period''' is the period during which performance parameters are measured.  

A performance measurement period is determined by required confidence limits and may vary as a function of the observed parameter values. [[User (telecommunications)|User]] [[time]] is divided into consecutive performance measurement periods to enable measurement of user [[information transfer]] [[Reliability engineering|reliability]].

In [[telecommunication]], a '''periscope antenna''' is an [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]] configuration in which the transmitting antenna is oriented to produce a vertical [[radiation pattern]], and a flat or off-axis [[parabolic reflector]], mounted above the transmitting antenna, is used to direct the [[wikt:beam|beam]] in a horizontal [[Course (navigation)|path]] toward the receiving antenna.  

A periscope antenna facilitates increased terrain clearance without long [[transmission line]]s, while permitting the active equipment to be located at or near ground level for ease of [[repair and maintenance|maintenance]].

      <text bytes="7682" xml:space="preserve">In [[telecommunication]] and [[electrical engineering]], a '''phantom circuit''' is an [[electrical circuit]] derived from suitably arranged wires with one or more conductive paths being a circuit in itself and at the same time acting as one conductor of another circuit. 

==Phantom group==
[[Image:Phantom 1.svg|thumb|400px|Phantom circuit derived from two subscriber circuits]]

A '''phantom group''' is composed of three circuits that are derived from two single-channel circuits to form a ''phantom circuit''. Here the phantom circuit is a third circuit derived from two suitably arranged pairs of wires, called side circuits, with each pair of wires being a circuit in itself and at the same time acting as one conductor of the third circuit.  The &quot;side circuits&quot; within phantom circuits can be coupled to their respective [[voltage drop]]s by [[transformer|center-tapped transformer]]s, usually called &quot;[[repeating coil]]s&quot;. The center taps are on the line side of the side circuits. Current from the phantom circuit is split evenly by the center taps. This cancels [[crosstalk]] from the phantom circuit to the side circuits. 
[[Image:Phantom 2.svg|thumb|left|250px|Diagram showing how the phantom currents (red) cancel in the transformer. Side circuit currents (blue) do not cancel and are transmitted through the transformer.]]
Phantom working increased the number of circuits on long distance routes in the early 20th century without putting up more wires.  Phantoming declined with the adoption of [[carrier system]]s.  

It is theoretically possible to create a phantom circuit from two other phantom circuits and so on up in a pyramid with a maximum 2n-1 circuits being derived from n original circuits.  However, more than one level of phantoming is usually impractical.  Isolation between the phantom circuit and the side circuits relies on accurate [[Balanced circuit|balance]] of the line and transformers.  Imperfect balance results in crosstalk between the phantom and side circuits and this effect accumulates as each level of phantoms is added.  Even small levels of crosstalk are unacceptable on analogue telecommunications circuits since speech crosstalk is still intelligible down to quite low levels.

==Phantom microphone powering==
{{main|Phantom power}}

[[Condenser microphones]] have impedance converter ([[current amplifier]]) circuitry that requires powering; in addition, the capsule of any non-[[electret]], non-[[RF]] condenser microphone requires a polarizing [[voltage]] to be applied. Since the mid- to late 1960s most [[balanced]], professional condenser microphones for recording and broadcast have used phantom powering. It can be provided by outboard AC or battery supplies, but nowadays is most often built into the mixing console, recorder or [[microphone preamplifier]] to which the microphones are connected.

By far the most common circuit uses +48 V DC fed through a matched pair of 6.8 k&amp;Omega; [[resistor]]s for each input channel. This arrangement has been standardized by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] and [[ISO]], along with a less-commonly-used arrangement with +12 V DC and 680 &amp;Omega; feed resistors.

As a practical matter, phantom powering allows the same two-conductor shielded cables to be used for both [[dynamic microphones]] and condenser microphones, while being harmless to balanced microphones that aren't designed to consume it, since the circuit balance prevents any substantial DC from flowing through the output circuit of those microphones.

==DC phantom==
{{main|simplex signaling}}
Simple DC signalling can be achieved on a telecommunications line in a similar way to phantom powering of microphones.  A switch connected to the transformer centre-tap at one end of the line can operate a similarly connected relay at the other end.  The return path is through the ground connection.  This arrangement can be used for remotely controlling equipment.

==Carrier circuit phantoms==
From the 1950s to around the 1980s, using phantoms on [[Balanced line#Star-quad|star-quad]] trunk carrier circuits was a popular method of deriving a high quality broadcast audio circuit.  The multiplexed [[Frequency division multiplexing|FDM]] telecommunications carrier system usually did not use the [[baseband]] of the cable because it was inconvenient to separate low frequencies with filters.  On the other hand, a one-way audio phantom could be formed from the two pairs (go and return signals) making up the star-quad cable.

==Unloaded phantom==
[[Image:Unloaded phantom.svg|thumb|600px|center|Unloaded phantom configuration. The windings of the loading coil are wound such that the magnetic flux induced in the core is normally in the same direction for both windings.  However, in the phantom configuration the flux cancels.]]
 
'''Unloaded phantom''' is a phantom configuration of loaded lines (a circuit fitted with [[loading coil]]s).  The idea here is not to create additional circuits.  Rather, the purpose is to cancel or greatly reduce the effect of the loading coils fitted to a line.  The reason for doing this is that loaded lines have a definite [[cut-off frequency]] and it may be desired to [[Equalization (communications)|equalise]] the line to a frequency which is higher than this, for example to make a circuit suitable for use by a broadcaster.  Ideally, the loading would be removed or reduced for a permanent connection, but this is not feasible for temporary arrangements such as a requirement for [[outside broadcast]].  Instead, two circuits in a phantom configuration can be used to greatly reduce the [[inductance]] being inserted by the loading coils, and hence the loading effect.

[[Image:Phantom flux.svg|thumb|250px|Diagram showing how the flux due to the phantom currents (red) is cancelled in the load coil. Flux due to normal line currents (blue) is additive.]]
It works because the loading coils used on balanced lines have two windings, one for each leg of the circuit.  They are both wound on a common core and the windings are so arranged that the magnetic flux induced by both of them is in the same direction.  Both windings induce an [[Electromotive force|emf]] in each other as well as their own [[electromagnetic induction|self-induction]].  This effect greatly increases the inductance of the coil and hence its loading effectiveness.  By contrast, when the circuit is in the phantom configuration the currents in the two wires of each pair are in the same direction and the magnetic flux is being cancelled.  This has precisely the opposite effect and the inductance is greatly reduced.

This configuration is most commonly used on the two pairs of a [[star quad cable|star-quad cable]].  It is not so successful with other pairs of wires.  The difference in the path of the two pairs can easily destroy the balance and results in [[crosstalk]] and [[interference (communication)|interference]].

This configuration can also be called &quot;bunched pairs&quot;.  However, &quot;bunched pairs&quot; can also refer to the straightforward connection of two lines in parallel which is not a phantom circuit and will not reduce the loading.

It consists of an array of antenna elements ''(A)'' powered by a [[transmitter]] ''(TX)''.  The feed current for each antenna passes through a [[phase shifter]] ''(φ)'' controlled by a computer ''(C)''.  The moving red lines show the wavefronts of the radio waves emitted by each element.  The individual wavefronts are spherical, but they combine ([[Superposition principle|superpose]]) in front of the antenna to create a [[plane wave]], a beam of radio waves travelling in a specific direction.  The phase shifters delay the radio waves progressively going up the line so each antenna emits its wavefront later than the one below it.  This causes the resulting plane wave to be directed at an angle ''θ'' to the antenna's axis.  By changing the phase shifts the computer can instantly change the angle ''θ'' of the beam.  Most phased arrays have two-dimensional arrays of antennas instead of the linear array shown here, and the beam can be steered in two dimensions.  The velocity of the radio waves is shown slowed down enormously.]]

In a simple [[array antenna]], the radio frequency current from the [[transmitter]] is fed to the individual antennas with the correct [[phase (waves)|phase]] relationship so that the radio waves from the separate antennas add together to increase the radiation in a desired direction and cancel to suppress radiation in undesired directions.  In a phased array, the power from the transmitter is fed to the antennas through devices called ''[[phase shifter]]s'', controlled by a computer system, which can alter the phase electronically, thus steering the beam of radio waves to a different direction.  Since the array must consist of many small antennas (sometimes thousands) to achieve high gain, phased arrays are mainly practical at the high [[frequency]] end of the radio spectrum, in the [[ultrahigh frequency|UHF]] and [[microwave]] bands, in which the antenna elements are conveniently small.

Phased arrays were invented for use in military [[radar]] systems, to steer a beam of radio waves quickly across the sky to detect planes and missiles. These systems are now widely used and have spread to civilian applications. The phased array principle is also used in [[acoustics]], and phased arrays of [[transducer|acoustic transducers]] are used in medical [[ultrasound imaging]] scanners ([[phased array ultrasonics]]), [[hydrocarbon exploration|oil and gas prospecting]] ([[reflection seismology]]), and military [[sonar]] systems.

The term &quot;phased array&quot; is also used to a lesser extent for unsteered [[array antenna]]s in which the phase of the feed power and thus the radiation pattern of the antenna array is fixed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Visser&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{FS1037C MS188}} [http://glossary.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-027/_3979.htm Definition of Phased Array] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041021132428/http://glossary.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-027/_3979.htm |date=2004-10-21 }}. Accessed 27 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, AM broadcast radio antennas consisting of multiple [[mast radiator]]s fed so as to create a specific radiation pattern are also called &quot;phased arrays&quot;.

Phased arrays take multiple forms. However, the four most common are the passive phased array (PESA), active electronically scanned array (AESA), hybrid beam forming phased array, and digital beam forming (DBF) array.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sturdivant, Quan, Chang |title=Systems Engineering of Phased Arrays |date=2018 |publisher=Artech House |isbn=978-1630814885 |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1630814881/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''passive phased array'' or ''[[passive electronically scanned array]]'' (PESA) is a phased array in which the antenna elements are connected to a single [[transmitter]] and/or [[radio receiver|receiver]], as shown in the animation at top{{clarify|reason=there are 2 animations and it's not clear which one is referred to here|date=September 2019}}.  PESAs are the most common type of phased array. Generally speaking, a PESA uses one receiver/exciter for the entire array.

An ''active phased array'' or ''[[active electronically scanned array]]'' (AESA) is a phased array in which each antenna element has an analog transmitter/receiver (T/R) module&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sturdivant, Harris |title=Transmit Receive Modules for Radar and Communication Systems |date=2015 |publisher=Artech House |location=Norwood, MA |isbn=978-1608079797 |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1608079791/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which creates the phase shifting required to electronically steer the antenna beam.  Active arrays are a more advanced, second-generation phased-array technology which are used in military applications; unlike PESAs they can radiate several beams of radio waves at multiple frequencies in different directions simultaneously. However, the number of simultaneous beams is limited by practical reasons of electronic packaging of the beam former(s) to approximately three simultaneous beams for an AESA. Each beam former has a receiver/exciter connected to it.

A ''hybrid beam forming phased array'' can be thought of as a combination of an AESA and a digital beam forming phased array. It uses subarrays that are active phased arrays (for instance, a subarray may be 64, 128 or 256 elements and the number of elements depends upon system requirements). The subarrays are combined together to form the full array. Each subarray has its own digital receiver/exciter. This approach allows clusters of simultaneous beams to be created.

A ''digital beam forming (DBF) phased array'' has a digital receiver/exciter at each element in the array. The signal at each element is digitized by the receiver/exciter. This means that antenna beams can be formed digitally in a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or the array computer. This approach allows for multiple simultaneous antenna beams to be formed.

One possible physical implementation of a phased array is called a ''[[conformal antenna]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot; Pandey&quot;&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a phased array in which the individual antennas, instead of being arranged in a flat plane, are mounted on a curved surface.  The phase shifters compensate for the different path lengths of the waves due to the antenna elements' varying position on the surface, allowing the array to radiate a plane wave.  Conformal antennas are used in aircraft and missiles, to integrate the antenna into the curving surface of the aircraft to reduce aerodynamic drag.

== History ==
[[Image:Braun phased array antenna 1905.png|thumb|[[Ferdinand Braun]]'s 1905 directional antenna which used the phased array principle, consisting of 3 monopole antennas in an equilateral triangle. A quarter-wave delay in the feedline of one antenna caused the array to radiate in a beam. The delay could be switched manually into any of the 3 feeds, rotating the antenna beam by 120°.]]

Phased array transmission was originally shown in 1905 by [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureate [[Karl Ferdinand Braun]] who demonstrated enhanced transmission of [[radio]] waves in one direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1909/braun-lecture.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-22 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706075759/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1909/braun-lecture.pdf |archivedate=2008-07-06 }} Braun's Nobel Prize lecture.

In 2007, [[DARPA]] researchers announced a 16 element phased array radar antenna which was also integrated with all the necessary circuits on a single silicon chip and operated at 30–50&amp;nbsp;GHz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/science/10-07PhasedArrayChipDK-L.asp World’s Most Complex Silicon Phased Array Chip Developed at UC San Diego] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225084723/http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/science/10-07PhasedArrayChipDK-L.asp |date=2007-12-25 }} in UCSD News (reviewed 2 November 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative [[amplitude]]s of—and constructive and destructive [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] effects among—the signals radiated by the individual antennas determine the effective [[radiation pattern]] of the array. A phased array may be used to point a fixed radiation pattern, or to [[wikt:scan|scan]] rapidly in [[azimuth]] or elevation. Simultaneous electrical scanning in both azimuth and elevation was first demonstrated in a phased array antenna at [[Hughes Aircraft Company]], California in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;See Joseph Spradley, &quot;A Volumetric Electrically Scanned Two-Dimensional Microwave Antenna Array,&quot; IRE National Convention Record, Part I{{Snd}} Antennas and Propagation; Microwaves, New York: The Institute of Radio Engineers, 1958, 204–212.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Broadcasting ===
In [[broadcast engineering]], phased arrays are used by many [[AM broadcasting|AM broadcast]] [[radio stations]] to enhance [[signal strength]] and therefore coverage in the [[city of license]], while minimizing [[Interference (communication)|interference]] to other areas. Due to the differences between daytime and nighttime [[ionosphere|ionospheric]] [[radio propagation|propagation]] at [[mediumwave]] frequencies, it is common for AM broadcast stations to change between day ([[groundwave]]) and night ([[skywave]]) radiation patterns by switching the [[phase (waves)|phase]] and power levels supplied to the individual antenna elements ([[mast radiator]]s) daily at [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]]. For [[shortwave]] broadcasts many stations use arrays of horizontal dipoles. A common arrangement uses 16 dipoles in a 4×4 array. Usually this is in front of a wire grid reflector. The phasing is often switchable to allow [[Beam steering]] in azimuth and sometimes elevation.

More modest phased array longwire antenna systems may be employed by private radio enthusiasts to receive longwave, mediumwave (AM) and shortwave radio broadcasts from great distances.

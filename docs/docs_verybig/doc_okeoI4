'''Howard County''' is a [[county]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Maryland]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 287,085.&lt;ref name=&quot;QF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=State &amp; County QuickFacts |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/24/24001.html |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=September 12, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606163146/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/24/24001.html |archive-date=June 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[county seat]] is [[Ellicott City, Maryland|Ellicott City]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GR6&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |accessdate=June 7, 2011 |title=Find a County |publisher=National Association of Counties |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531210815/http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |archive-date=May 31, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard County is included in the [[Baltimore metropolitan area|Baltimore-Columbia-Towson, MD Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which is also included in the [[Washington metropolitan area|Washington-Baltimore-Arlington, DC-MD-VA-WV-PA Combined Statistical Area]]. 

Recent south county development has led to some realignment towards the [[Washington, D.C.]] media and employment markets. The county is home to [[Columbia, Maryland|Columbia]], a major [[planned community]] of approximately 100,000 founded by developer [[James Rouse]] in 1967.

Howard County is frequently cited for its affluence, quality of life, and excellent schools. Its estimated 2016 median household income of $120,194 raised it to the [[Highest-income counties in the United States|second-highest median household income]] of any U.S. county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/ACS/12_1YR/DP03/0100000US.05000.003| archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212082420/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/ACS/12_1YR/DP03/0100000US.05000.003| url-status=dead| archive-date=February 12, 2020| title=Selected Economic Characteristics: 2012 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates (DP03): All Counties Within United States| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the most affluent communities in the area, such as [[Clarksville, Maryland|Clarksville]], [[Dayton, Maryland|Dayton]], [[Glenelg, Maryland|Glenelg]], [[Glenwood, Howard County, Maryland|Glenwood]],  and [[West Friendship, Maryland|West Friendship]], are located along the [[Maryland Route 32|Route 32]] corridor in Howard County.

==History==
[[File:Martenet's Map of Howard County, Maryland - drawn entirely from actual surveys LOC 2002624032.jpg|thumb|1860 Martenet's Map of Howard County, Maryland]]

The lands of prehistoric Howard County were populated by Native Americans. The [[Maryland Historical Trust]] has documented sites along the Patapsco, Patuxent, Middle and Little Patuxent River valleys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Archaeology In Howard County and Beyond|author=M. Lee Preston, Jr.|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1652, the [[Susquehannock]] tribes signed a peace treaty with Maryland, giving up their provenance over the territory that is now Howard County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Maryland|author=Ethan Allen, Libertus Van Bokkelen|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1800, the [[mean center of U.S. population]] as calculated by the [[US Census Bureau]] was found in what is now Howard County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mean Center of Population of the United States|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/censusdata/files/popctr.pdf|accessdate=October 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1838, Dr. William Watkins of [[Richland Farm (Clarksville, Maryland)|Richland Manor]] proposed the &quot;Howard District&quot; of [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland|Anne Arundel County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Howard's Roads to the Past|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several adjournments, the area of western Anne Arundel County was designated the Howard District in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|title=Maryland Legislature|date=January 19, 1839}}&lt;/ref&gt; The district had the same status as a county except that it was not separately represented in the [[Maryland General Assembly]]. In 1841, the county built its first courthouse in Ellicott City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Howard County Buildings| url=http://archives.ubalt.edu/gbc/pdf/4-18.pdf| accessdate=April 7, 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002427/http://archives.ubalt.edu/gbc/pdf/4-18.pdf| archive-date=December 3, 2013| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the January 1851 constitutional convention, [[Thomas Beale Dorsey]] submitted a petition led by James Sykes. A committee was formed with Dorsey, Bowie, Smith, Harbine and Ricaud. After several postponements, the district was erected officially as Howard County on March 7, 1851.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The founders of Anne Arundel and Howard Counties, Maryland|author=Joshua Dorsey Warfield|page=522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plantations of modern Howard County used [[slavery in the United States|slave labor]] as early as 1690. At the time of the [[Underground Railroad]], some Howard County residents assisted slaves who were escaping to freedom. This was particularly risky, as many prominent plantation families were [[Confederate sympathizers]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], contributing militiamen to the South to protect local interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seeking Freedom The History of the Underground Railroad in Howard County|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maryland was exempt from the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], later abolishing slavery in the update of the Maryland Constitution in November 1864.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

On May 1, 1883 Howard County joined Anne Arundel County and Harford County in liquor prohibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|magazine=Christian Advocate|title=Prohibition in Maryland|date=May 17, 1883|page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1899, Howard County contained {{convert|400|mi}} of dirt and {{convert|48|mi}} of stone roads, including three paid turnpikes maintained by 118 men. Most traffic consisted of loads delivered to rail crossings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Maryland Geological Survey Report on the Highways of Maryland| year=1899| page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909, County Commissioners Hess, Werner and O'Neil were charged with malfeasance regarding contract bids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Times Dispatch|date=September 15, 1907|title=Commissioners are Indicted}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, a deadly [[1918 flu pandemic|flu pandemic]] swept the county starting with an early outbreak in [[Fort Meade, Maryland|Camp Meade]] in adjacent Anne Arundel County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jim Clark Soldier Farmer Legislator|page=11|author=James A.

By 1939 wheat harvesting fell to just {{convert|18800|acre}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=From Greater Production to More Efficiency| date=March 31, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, local newspaper owner [[Paul Griffith Stromberg]] led a five-county commission to study a superhighway between Baltimore and Washington through Howard County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/howard/clarksville/ph-ho-n-history-matters-0305-20150225-story.html|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|title=Doctor receives distinct honor in 1970|first1=Louise|last1=Vest|date=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]] eventually led to the construction of [[Interstate 70]] across northern Howard County and [[Interstate 95]] across the eastern part of the county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weingroff |first=Richard F. |title=Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, Creating the Interstate System |url=http://www.nationalatlas.gov/articles/transportation/a_highway.html |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111232433/http://www.nationalatlas.gov/articles/transportation/a_highway.html |archive-date=November 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sparsely populated county hosted population centers in Ellicott City, Elkridge, Savage, North Laurel and Lisbon with W.R. Grace and Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab as the largest new employers. Residents elected officials that campaigned to keep the county rural while planners prepared public works to support a quarter million residents by the year 2000. Race relations and desegregation became major issues of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New City Upon a Hill|author=Joseph Rocco Mitchell, David L Stebenne|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1963 to 1966 the [[Rouse Company]] bought {{convert|14000|acre}} of land and rezoned it for the Columbia Development. In 1972, the Marriott company proposed to build a regional theme park on Rouse-owned land but was denied zoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| newspaper=The Washington Post| title=Recreation Park Planners Woo Howard County| date=June 14, 1972| author=Edward Walsh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The county has a number of properties on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Howard County, Maryland|National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|2008a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|253|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|251|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|2.7|sqmi}} (1.0%) is water.&lt;ref name=&quot;GR1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_24.txt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913171515/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_24.txt |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 13, 2014 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=September 12, 2014 |date=August 22, 2012 |title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the second-smallest county in Maryland by land area and smallest by total area.

Howard County is located in the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont Plateau]] region of Maryland, with rolling hills making up most of the landscape. It is bounded on the north and northeast by the [[Patapsco River]], on the southwest by the [[Patuxent River]], and on the southeast by a land border with Anne Arundel County. Both the Patapsco and Patuxent run largely through publicly accessible parkland along the county borders. The Patuxent border includes the [[Triadelphia Reservoir|Triadelphia]] and [[Rocky Gorge Reservoir|Rocky Gorge]] [[reservoir]]s.

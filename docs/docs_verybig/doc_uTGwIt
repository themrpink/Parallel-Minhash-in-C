[[3rd bridge|Third bridge]] is a plucking method where the player ''frets'' a string and strikes the side opposite the bridge. The technique is mainly used on electric instruments because these have a pickup that amplifies only the local string vibration. It is possible on acoustic instruments as well, but less effective. For instance, a player might press on the seventh [[fret]] on a guitar and pluck it at the head side to make a tone resonate at the opposed side. On electric instruments, this technique generates multitone sounds reminiscent of a clock or bell.

Electric string instruments, such as the [[electric guitar]], can also be played without touching the strings by using [[audio feedback]]. When an electric guitar is plugged into a loud, powerful guitar amplifier with a [[loudspeaker]] and a high level of [[distortion (music)|distortion]] is intentionally used, the guitar produces sustained high-pitched sounds. By changing the proximity of the guitar to the speaker, the guitarist can produce sounds that cannot be produced with standard plucking and picking techniques. This technique was popularized by [[Jimi Hendrix]] and others in the 1960s. It was widely used in [[psychedelic rock]] and [[heavy metal music]].

==Changing the pitch of a vibrating string==
{{main|Mersenne's laws}}

There are three ways to change the pitch of a [[vibrating string]]. String instruments are tuned by varying the strings' tension because adjusting length or mass per unit length is impractical. Instruments with a [[fingerboard]] are then played by adjusting the length of the vibrating portion of the strings. The following observations all apply to a string that is infinitely flexible (a theoretical assumption, because in practical applications, strings are not infinitely flexible) strung between two fixed supports. Real strings have finite curvature at the bridge and nut, and the bridge, because of its motion, are not exactly nodes of vibration. Hence the following statements about proportionality are approximations.

===Length===
[[File:Proportional string fingering.png|thumb|200px|right|String fingering is proportional and not fixed,&lt;ref&gt;Piston, Walter (1955). ''Orchestration'', p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; as on the piano]]

Pitch can be adjusted by varying the [[length]] of the string.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Oxford Music Online by subscription|url = http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/|website = www.oxfordmusiconline.com|accessdate = 2015-09-17|url-status = live|archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110224031012/http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com|archivedate = 2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A longer string results in a lower pitch, while a shorter string results in a higher pitch. The frequency is inversely proportional to the length:

:&lt;math&gt;
f \propto \frac{1}{l}
&lt;/math&gt;

A string twice as long produces a tone of half the frequency (one octave lower).

===Tension===

Pitch can be adjusted by varying the [[Tension (physics)|tension]] of the string. A string with less tension (looser) results in a lower pitch, while a string with greater tension (tighter) results in a higher pitch. A homemade [[washtub bass]] made out of a length of rope, a broomstick and a washtub can produce different pitches by increasing the tension on the rope (producing a higher pitch) or reducing the tension (producing a lower pitch). The frequency is proportional to the square root of the tension:

:&lt;math&gt;
f \propto \sqrt{T}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Linear density ===

The pitch of a string can also be varied by changing the [[linear density]] (mass per unit length) of the string. In practical applications, such as with [[double bass]] strings or bass [[piano]] strings, extra weight is added to strings by winding them with metal. A string with a heavier metal winding produces a lower pitch than a string of equal length without a metal winding. This can be seen on a 2016-era set of gut strings for double bass. The higher-pitched G string is often made of synthetic material, or sometimes animal intestine, with no metal wrapping. To enable the low E string to produce a much lower pitch with a string of the same length, it is wrapped with many wrappings of thin metal wire. This adds to its mass without making it too stiff. The frequency is inversely proportional to the square root of the linear density:

:&lt;math&gt;
f \propto {1 \over \sqrt{\mu}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Given two strings of equal length and tension, the string with higher mass per unit length produces the lower pitch.

== String length or scale length ==
The length of the string from [[Nut (instrumental)|nut]] to [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]] on bowed or plucked instruments ultimately determines the distance between different notes on the instrument. For example, a double bass with its low range needs a [[scale length (string instruments)|scale length]] of around {{convert|42|in|cm}}, whilst a violin scale is only about {{convert|13|in|cm}}. On the shorter scale of the violin, the left hand may easily reach a range of slightly more than two octaves without [[shifting position]], while on the bass' longer scale, a single octave or a ninth is reachable in lower positions.

== Contact points along the string ==

[[File:DuplexScaling.jpg|thumb|300px|The strings of a [[piano]]]]
In bowed instruments, the bow is normally placed perpendicularly to the string, at a point halfway between the end of the fingerboard and the bridge.  However, different bow placements can be selected to change [[timbre]].  Application of the bow close to the bridge (known as ''[[sul ponticello]]'') produces an intense, sometimes harsh sound, which acoustically emphasizes the upper [[harmonics]].  Bowing above the fingerboard (''[[sul tasto]]'') produces a purer tone with less overtone strength, emphasizing the [[Fundamental frequency|fundamental]], also known as ''flautando'', since it sounds less reedy and more flute-like.

Bowed instruments pose a challenge to instrument builders, as compared with instruments that are only plucked (e.g., guitar), because on bowed instruments, the musician must be able to play one string at a time if they wish. As such, a bowed instrument must have a curved bridge that makes the &quot;outer&quot; strings lower in height than the &quot;inner&quot; strings. With such a curved bridge, the player can select one string at a time to play. On guitars and [[lute]]s, the bridge can be flat, because the strings are played by plucking them with the fingers, fingernails or a pick; by moving the fingers or pick to different positions, the player can play different strings. On bowed instruments, the need to play strings individually with the bow also limits the number of strings to about six or seven strings; with more strings, it would be impossible to select individual strings to bow. (Note: bowed strings can also play two bowed notes on two different strings at the same time, a technique called a [[double stop]].) Indeed, on the orchestral [[string section]] instruments, four strings are the norm, with the exception of five strings used on some [[double bass]]es. In contrast, with stringed keyboard instruments, 88 courses are used on a [[piano]], and even though these strings are arranged on a flat bridge, the mechanism can play any of the notes individually.

Similar timbral distinctions are also possible with plucked string instruments by selecting an appropriate plucking point, although the difference is perhaps more subtle.

In keyboard instruments, the contact point along the string (whether this be hammer, tangent, or plectrum) is a choice made by the instrument designer.  Builders use a combination of experience and acoustic theory to establish the right set of contact points.

In harpsichords, often there are two sets of strings of equal length.  These &quot;choirs&quot; usually differ in their plucking points.  One choir has a &quot;normal&quot; plucking point, producing a canonical harpsichord sound; the other has a plucking point close to the bridge, producing a reedier &quot;nasal&quot; sound rich in upper harmonics.

== Production of multiple notes ==
[[File:Ottoman musical string instrument at the Debbane Palace museum.jpg|thumb|Arab string musical instrument on display at the [[Debbane Palace]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;museum, [[Lebanon]].]]
A single string at a certain tension and length only produces one note. To produce multiple notes, string instruments use one of two methods. One is to add enough strings to cover the required range of different notes (e.g., as with the [[piano]], which has sets of 88 strings to enable the performer to play 88 different notes). The other is to provide a way to ''stop'' the strings along their length to shorten the part that vibrates, which is the method used in guitar and violin family instruments to produce different notes from the same string. The piano and harp represent the first method, where each note on the instrument has its own string or [[Course (music)|course]] of multiple strings tuned to the same note. (Many notes on a piano are strung with a &quot;choir&quot; of three strings tuned alike, to increase the volume.) A guitar represents the second methodâ€”the player's fingers push the string against the fingerboard so that the string is pressed firmly against a metal fret. Pressing the string against a fret while plucking or strumming it shortens the vibrating part and thus produces a different note.

Some zithers combine stoppable (melody) strings with a greater number of &quot;open&quot; harmony or chord strings. On instruments with stoppable strings, such as the violin or guitar, the player can shorten the vibrating length of the string, using their fingers directly (or more rarely through some mechanical device, as in the [[nyckelharpa]] and the hurdy-gurdy). Such instruments usually have a fingerboard attached to the neck of the instrument, that provides a hard flat surface the player can stop the strings against. On some string instruments, the fingerboard has [[fret]]s, raised ridges perpendicular to the strings, that stop the string at precise intervals, in which case the fingerboard is also called a ''fretboard''.

Moving frets during performance is usually impractical. The bridges of a [[Koto (musical instrument)|koto]], on the other hand, may be moved by the player occasionally in the course of a single piece of music. Many modern Western harps include levers, either directly moved by fingers (on Celtic harps) or controlled by foot pedals (on orchestral harps), to raise the pitch of individual strings by a fixed amount. The Middle Eastern zither, the [[Kanun (instrument)|qanun]], is equipped with small levers called ''mandal'' that let each course of multiple strings be incrementally retuned &quot;on the fly&quot; while the instrument is being played. These levers raise or lower the pitch of the string course by a microtone, less than a half step.

==Sympathetic strings==
{{main|Sympathetic string}}
Some instruments are employed with [[sympathetic string]]sâ€”which are additional strings not meant to be plucked. These strings [[resonance|resonate]] with the played notes, creating additional tones. Sympathetic strings vibrate naturally when various intervals, such as the [[unison]]s or the [[octave]]s of the notes of the sympathetic strings are plucked, bowed or struck. This system is used on the [[sarangi]], the [[grand piano]], the [[hardanger fiddle]] and the [[Rubab (instrument)|rubab]].

== Sound production ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Violin]] --&gt;

=== Acoustic instruments ===
{{See also|Musical acoustics}}

A vibrating string strung on a very thick log, as a hypothetical example, would make only a very quiet sound, so string instruments are usually constructed in such a way that the vibrating string is coupled to a hollow resonating chamber, a soundboard, or both. On the violin, for example, the four strings pass over a thin wooden bridge resting on a hollow box (the body of the violin). The normal force applied to the body from the strings is supported in part by a small cylinder of wood called the [[soundpost]]. The violin body also has two &quot;f-holes&quot; carved on the top. The strings' vibrations are distributed via the bridge and soundpost to all surfaces of the instrument, and are thus made louder by matching of the [[acoustic impedance]]. The correct technical explanation is that they allow a better match to the [[acoustic impedance]] of the air.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

It is sometimes said that the sounding board or soundbox &quot;amplifies&quot; the sound of the strings. In reality, no power amplification occurs, because all of the [[energy]] to produce [[sound]] comes from the vibrating string. The mechanism is that the sounding board of the instrument provides a larger surface area to create [[sound wave]]s than that of the string and therefore acts a matching element between the acoustic impedance of the string and that of the surrounding air. . A larger vibrating surface can sometimes produce better matching; especially at lower frequencies.

All [[lute]] type instruments traditionally have a bridge, which holds the string at the proper action height from the fret/finger board at one end of the strings. On acoustic instruments, the bridge performs an equally important function of transmitting string energy into the &quot;sound box&quot; of the instrument, thereby increasing the sound volume. The specific design, and materials the used in the construction of the bridge of an instrument, have a dramatic impact upon both the sound and responsiveness of the instrument.

Achieving a tonal characteristic that is effective and pleasing to the player's and listener's ear is something of an art and craft, as well as a science, and the makers of string instruments often seek very high quality woods to this end, particularly [[spruce]] (chosen for its lightness, strength and flexibility) and [[maple]] (a very hard wood). Spruce is used for the sounding boards of instruments from the violin to the piano. Instruments such as the banjo use a drum, covered in natural or synthetic skin as their soundboard.

Acoustic instruments can also be made out of artificial materials, such as [[carbon fiber]] and [[fiberglass]] (particularly the larger, lower-pitched instruments, such as cellos and basses).

In the early 20th century, the [[Stroh violin]] used a diaphragm-type [[resonator]] and a metal horn to project the string sound, much like early mechanical gramophones. Its use declined beginning about 1920, as electronic amplification through [[power amplifier]]s and [[loudspeaker]]s was developed and came into use. String instrument players can electronically amplify their instruments by connecting them to a [[PA system]] or a [[guitar amplifier]].

=== Electronic amplification ===
Most string instruments can be fitted with [[piezoelectric]] or magnetic [[Pick up (music technology)|pickup]]s to convert the string's vibrations into an electrical signal that is amplified and then converted back into sound by loudspeakers. Some players attach a pickup to their traditional string instrument to &quot;electrify&quot; it. Another option is to use a solid-bodied instrument, which reduces unwanted [[Audio feedback|feedback]] howls or squeals.

Amplified string instruments can be much louder than their acoustic counterparts, so musicians can play them in relatively loud rock, blues, and jazz ensembles. Amplified instruments can also have their amplified tone modified by using electronic effects such as distortion, reverb, or [[wah-wah (music)|wah-wah]].

Bass-register string instruments such as the double bass and the electric bass are amplified with [[bass instrument amplification|bass instrument amplifiers]] that are designed to reproduce low-frequency sounds. To modify the tone of amplified bass instruments, a range of electronic [[bass effects]] are available, such as distortion and chorus.

==Symphonic strings==

The string instruments usually used in the [[orchestra]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jorge |last=Aguilar |title=String Instruments |url=http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/spring03/aguilar/TchaiConSo.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190130141956/http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/spring03/aguilar/TchaiConSo.htm |archive-date=January 30, 2019 |publisher=[[University of Florida]] |date=2003 |accessdate=February 1, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; and often called the &quot;symphonic strings&quot; or [[string section]] are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music|url=https://archive.org/details/conciseoxforddic00scho|year=1964|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-311302-3|pages=[https://archive.org/details/conciseoxforddic00scho/page/412 412]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Violins]] (divided into two sectionsâ€”first violins and second violins; these sections play exactly the same instruments; the difference is that the first violins play higher-register lines and the second violins play lower-register parts, [[accompaniment]] parts or [[countermelody|countermelodies]])
* [[Violas]]
* [[Cello]]s
* [[Double bass]]es

When orchestral instrumentation specifies &quot;strings,&quot; it often means this combination of string parts. Orchestral works rarely omit any of these string parts, but often include additional string instruments, especially the [[concert harp]] and piano.  In the [[Baroque orchestra]] from the 1600sâ€“1750 (or with modern groups playing [[early music]]) harpsichord is almost always used to play the [[basso continuo]] part (the written-out [[bass line]] and improvised chords), and often a [[theorbo]] or [[lute]] or a [[pipe organ]]. In some classical music, such as the [[string quartet]], the double bass is not typically used; the cello plays the bass role in this literature.

The '''Pulitzer Prize for History''', administered by [[Columbia University]], is one of the seven American [[Pulitzer Prizes]] that are annually awarded for Letters, Drama, and Music. It has been presented since 1917 for a distinguished book about the [[history of the United States]]. Thus it is one of the original Pulitzers, for the program was inaugurated in 1917 with seven prizes, four of which were awarded that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1917 &quot;1917 Winners&quot;]. The Pulitzer Prizes (pulitzer.org). Retrieved 2013-12-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pulitzer Prize program has also recognized some historical work with its [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography|Biography prize]], from 1917, and its [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction|General Non-Fiction prize]], from 1962.

Finalists have been announced from 1980, ordinarily two others beside the winner.&lt;ref name=prize/&gt;

==Winners==
In its first 97 years to 2013, the History Pulitzer was awarded 95 times. Two prizes were given in 1989; none in 1919, 1984, and 1994.&lt;ref name=prize/&gt; Four people have won two each, [[Margaret Leech]], [[Bernard Bailyn]], [[Paul Horgan]] and [[Alan Taylor (historian)|Alan Taylor]].

Investigations have shown that there are hundreds of unreported biosafety accidents, with laboratories self-policing the handling of biohazardous materials and lack of reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Young A|author2=Penzenstadler N, TODAY|title= Inside America's secretive biolabs|work=USA Today|date=May 28, 2015|url=https://www.usatoday.com/longform/news/2015/05/28/biolabs-pathogens-location-incidents/26587505/|accessdate=September 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor record keeping, improper disposal, and mishandling biohazardous materials result in increased risks of biochemical contamination for both the public and environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White House issues report on improving biosafety at federal labs|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-whitehouse-biosafety-idUSKCN0SN34F20151029|date=October 29, 2015|accessdate=September 3, 2016|first=Julie|last=Steenhuysen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the precautions taken during the handling process of biohazardous materials, the World Health Organization recommends:
Staff training should always include information on safe methods for highly hazardous procedures that are commonly encountered by all laboratory personnel and which involve:&lt;ref name=CDCMan/&gt;
#Inhalation risks (i.e. aerosol production) when using loops, streaking agar plates,
#pipetting, making smears, opening cultures, taking blood/serum samples, centrifuging, etc.
#Ingestion risks when handling specimens, smears and cultures
#Risks of [[percutaneous]] exposures when using syringes and needles
#Bites and scratches when handling animals
#Handling of blood and other potentially hazardous pathological materials
#Decontamination and disposal of infectious material.

==Policy and practice in the United States==

===Legal information===
In June 2009, the Trans-Federal Task Force On Optimizing Biosafety and Biocontainment Oversight recommended the formation of an agency to coordinate high safety risk level labs (3 and 4), and voluntary, non-punitive measures for incident reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ars.usda.gov/is/br/bbotaskforce/biosafety-FINAL-REPORT-092009.pdf |title=Report of the Trans-Federal Task Force on Optimizing Biosafety and Biocontainment Oversight  |date=July 2009  |publisher=ars.usda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unclear as to what changes may or may not have been implemented following their recommendations.

====United States Code of Federal Regulations====

The United States [[Code of Federal Regulations]] is the [[codification (law)]], or collection of laws specific to a specific to a [[jurisdiction]] that represent broad areas subject to federal regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDsys - Browse Code of Federal Regulations (Annual Edition)|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collectionCfr.action?collectionCode=CFR|accessdate=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations]] addresses laws concerning Public Health issues including biosafety which can be found under the citation 42 CFR 73 to 42 CFR 73.21 by accessing the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) website.&lt;ref name=E-CFR&gt;{{cite web|title=E-CFR: TITLE 42—Public Health. Vol TITLE 42—Public Health|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=868d2d34fe582976da6e893468fa7eb6&amp;pitd=20150101&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title42/42cfr73_main_02.tpl|accessdate=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:International Biohazard Warning Symbol.svg|thumb|International Biohazard Warning Symbol]]
Title 42 Section 73 of the CFR addresses specific aspects of biosafety including [[Occupational safety and health]], transportation of biohazardous materials and safety plans for laboratories using potential biohazards. While [[biocontainment]], as defined in the Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories&lt;ref name=CDCbiosafety&gt;{{cite web|title=Biosafety Publications and Forms|publisher=CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/index.htm|accessdate=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Primary Containment for Biohazards: Selection, Installation and Use of Biosafety Cabinets&lt;ref name=CDCbiosafety /&gt; manuals available at the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] website much of the design, implementation and monitoring of protocols are left up to state and local authorities.&lt;ref name=E-CFR /&gt;
 
The United States CFR states  &quot;An individual or entity required to register [as a user of biological agents] must develop and implement a written biosafety plan that is commensurate with the risk of the select agent or toxin&quot;&lt;ref name=E-CFR /&gt; which is followed by 3 recommended sources for laboratory reference.

#The CDC/NIH publication, &quot;Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories.&quot;&lt;ref name=E-CFR /&gt;
#The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations in 29 CFR parts 1910.1200 and 1910.1450.&lt;ref name=E-CFR /&gt;
#The &quot;NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules,&quot; (NIH Guidelines).&lt;ref name=E-CFR /&gt;

While clearly the needs of [[biocontainment]] and biosafety measures vary across government, academic and private industry laboratories, [[biological agents]] pose similar risks independent of their locale.&lt;ref name=TIAN2014&gt;Tian D, Zheng T. Comparison and Analysis of Biological Agent Category Lists Based On Biosafety and Biodefense. PLoS One. 2014;9(6). {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0101163}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Laws relating to biosafety are not easily accessible and there are few federal regulations that are readily available for a potential trainee to reference outside of the publications recommended in 42 CFR 73.12.&lt;ref name=E-CFR /&gt;&lt;ref name=CDCbiosafety /&gt; Therefore, training is the responsibility of lab employers&lt;ref name=E-CFR /&gt; and is not consistent across various laboratory types thereby increasing the risk of accidental release of [[biological hazards]] that pose serious health threats to the humans, animals and the [[ecosystem]] as a whole.

====Agency guidance====

Many government agencies have made guidelines and recommendations in an effort to increase biosafety measures across laboratories in the United States.  Agencies involved in producing policies surrounding biosafety within a hospital, pharmacy or clinical research laboratory include: the CDC, [[FDA]], [[USDA]], [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|DHHS]], DoT, [[EPA]] and potentially other local organizations including public health departments.  The federal government does set some standards and recommendations for States to meet their standards, most of which fall under the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act (United States)|Occupational Safety and Health Act]] of 1970.&lt;ref name=&quot;osha.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dcsp/osp/|title=Directorate of Cooperative and State Programs - State Plans|publisher=Occupational Safety and Health Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; but currently, there is no single federal regulating agency directly responsible for ensuring the safety of biohazardous handling, storage, identification, clean-up and disposal.  In addition to the CDC, the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] has some of the most accessible information on ecological impacts of biohazards, how to handle spills, reporting guidelines and proper disposal of agents dangerous to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/regulatory-information-topic/regulatory-information-topic-waste#hazardous|title=Regulatory Information by Topic: Waste|first=US|last=EPA, OEI, OIAA, IAD|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these agencies have their own manuals and guidance documents relating to training and certain aspects of biosafety directly tied to their agency's scope, including transportation, storage and handling of blood borne pathogens. (OSHA,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/osha3186.pdf |title=Model Plans and Programs for the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens and Hazard Communications Standards |year=2003 |publisher=Occupational Safety and Health Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IATA]]).  The American Biological Safety Association (ABSA) has a list of such agencies and links to their websites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.absa.org/resbslinks.html|title=ABSA - Biosafety Links|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with links to publications and guidance documents to assist in risk assessment, lab design and adherence to laboratory exposure control plans. Many of these agencies were members of the 2009 Task Force on BioSafety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/legal/boards/biosafetytaskforce/Pages/taskforcemembership.aspx|title=BioSafety Task Force Membership - PHE|access-date=2016-11-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103173822/https://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/legal/boards/biosafetytaskforce/Pages/taskforcemembership.aspx|archive-date=2017-01-03|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a formation of a [[Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense]], but this is more concernend with national defense programs and biosecurity.

Ultimately states and local governments, as well as private industry labs, are left to make the final determinants for their own biosafety programs, which vary widely in scope and enforcement across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.triumvirate.com/State-by-state-Biosafety-Regulations|title=State-by-state Biosafety Regulations - Resource Page|first=Triumvirate|last=Environmental|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all state programs address biosafety from all necessary perspectives, which should not just include personal safety, but also emphasize an full understanding among laboratory personnel of quality control and assurance, exposure potential impacts on the environment, and general public safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/laboratory/OSHA3404laboratory-safety-guidance.pdf |title=Laboratory Safety Guidance |year=2011 |publisher=Occupational Safety and Health Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Toby Ord]] puts into question whether the current international conventions regarding biotechnology research and development regulation, and self-regulation by biotechnology companies and the scientific community are adequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Ord|first=Toby|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/06/worst-case-thinking-prevent-pandemics-coronavirus-existential-risk|title=Why we need worst-case thinking to prevent pandemics|date=2020-03-06|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-11|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State occupational safety plans are often focused on transportation, disposal, and risk assessment, allowing caveats for safety audits, but ultimately leaves the training in the hands of the employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/migrate/uploads/AAAS-Biosafety-report.pdf |title=Biological Safety Training Programs as a Component of Personnel Reliability |type=Workshop Report |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |author1=Kavita Marfatia Berger |author2=Kathryn A.

Sta.Ana |year=2009 |access-date=2016-11-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230195019/https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/migrate/uploads/AAAS-Biosafety-report.pdf |archive-date=2017-12-30 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;  22 states have approved Occupational Safety plans by OSHA that are audited annually for effectiveness.&lt;ref name=&quot;osha.gov&quot;/&gt; These plans apply to private and public sector workers, and not necessarily state/ government workers, and not all specifically have a comprehensive program for all aspects of biohazard management from start to finish.  Sometimes biohazard management plans are limited only to workers in transportation specific job titles.  The enforcement and training on such regulations can vary from lab to lab based on the State's plans for occupational health and safety.  With the exception of DoD lab personnel, CDC lab personnel, First responders, and DoT employees, enforcement of training is inconsistent, and while training is required to be done, specifics on the breadth and frequency of refresher training does not seem consistent from state to state; penalties may never be assessed without larger regulating bodies being aware of non-compliance, and enforcement is limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.councilforresponsiblegenetics.org/pageDocuments/T6CQ5HCITM.pdf |title=Biological Laboratories: Risks and Regulations |last=Buyon |first=Lucas |publisher=Council for Responsible Genetics |access-date=2016-11-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527192522/http://www.councilforresponsiblegenetics.org/pageDocuments/T6CQ5HCITM.pdf |archive-date=2016-05-27 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Medical waste management in the United States ====
{{see also|Medical Waste Tracking Act}}
[[Medical waste]] management was identified as an issue in the 1980s; with the [[Medical Waste Tracking Act]] of 1988&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulated Biohazard Waste Regulations|url=http://biohazardwasteregulations.com/|website=Biohazard Waste Regulations|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the new standard in biohazard [[waste disposal]].

Although the Federal Government, EPA &amp; DOT provide some oversight of regulated medical waste storage, transportation, and disposal the majority of biohazard medical waste is regulated at the state level.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt; Each state is responsible for regulation and management of their own bioharzardous waste with each state varying in their regulatory process. Record keeping of biohazardous waste also varies between states.

Medical healthcare centers, hospitals veterinary clinics, clinical laboratories and other facilities generate over one million tons of waste each year.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt; Although the majority of this waste is as harmless as common household waste, as much as 15 percent of this waste poses a potential infection hazard, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt; Medical waste is required to be rendered non-infectious before it can be disposed of.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt; There are several different methods to treat and dispose of biohazardous waste. In the United States, the 
primary methods for treatment and disposal of biohazard, medical and sharps waste may include:&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt;
* [[Incineration]]
* Microwave
* [[Autoclaves]]
* Mechanical/Chemical Disinfection
*[[Irradiation]]

Different forms of biohazardous wasted required different treatments for their proper waste management. This is determined largely be each states regulations. Currently, there are several contracted companies that focus on medical, sharps and biological hazard disposal. Stericycle and Daniels Health&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.danielshealth.com/|title=Daniels Health {{!}} Clinically Designed Healthcare Waste Solutions|website=Daniels Health|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; are two national  leaders in medical waste and pharmaceutical disposal in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stericycle.com/about-us|title=About - Stericycle|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incidents of non-compliance and reform efforts===

The United States Government has made it clear that biosafety is to be taken very seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/biosafety-and-biosecurity-united-states|title=Biosafety and Biosecurity in the United States - Homeland Security|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, incidents with Anthrax and Ebola pathogens in CDC laboratories (&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2015/s0204-ebola-lab.html|title=CDC Press Releases|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/news-multimedia/lab-incident/|title=CDC Lab Incident: Anthrax, June 2014 - Anthrax - CDC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), prompted the CDC director [[Tom Frieden]] to issue a [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] for research with these types of [[select agent]]s.  An investigation concluded that there was a lack of adherence to safety protocols and &quot;inadequate safeguards&quot; in place.  This indicated a lack of proper training or reinforcement of training and supervision on regular basis for lab personnel.

Following these incidents, the CDC established an ''External Laboratory Safety Workgroup'' (ELSW),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/about/lab-safety/laboratory-safety-workgroup/workgroup.html|title=Laboratory Safety at CDC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggestions have been made to reform effectiveness of the Federal Select Agent Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selectagents.gov/|title=Federal Select Agent Program|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White House issued a report on national biosafety priorities in 2015, outlining next steps for a national biosafety and security program, and addressed biological safety needs for health research, national defense, and public safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/10-2015_biosafety_and_biosecurity_memo.pdf |title=Biosafety and biosecurity memo |date=October 29, 2015 |publisher=www.whitehouse.gov |access-date=2016-11-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120141923/https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/10-2015_biosafety_and_biosecurity_memo.pdf |archive-date=2017-01-20 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) had a presentation at their annual meeting focused on improving biosafety culture.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aphl.org/conferences/proceedings/Documents/2016_Annual_Meeting/23Monroe{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This same year, The UPMC Center for Health Security issued a case study report including reviews of ten different nations' current biosafety regulations, including the United States.  Their goal was to &quot;provide a foundation for identifying national‐level biosafety norms and enable initial assessment of biosafety priorities necessary for developing effective national biosafety regulation and oversight.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.upmchealthsecurity.org/our-work/pubs_archive/pubs-pdfs/2016/Combined%20Biosafety%20Case%20Studies%20final%20draft%20062116.pdf |title=NATIONAL BIOSAFETY SYSTEM |author1=Gigi Kwik Gronvall |author2=Matthew P Shearer |author3=Hannah Collins |date=July 2016 |publisher=UPMC Center for Health Security |access-date=2016-11-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109085425/http://www.upmchealthsecurity.org/our-work/pubs_archive/pubs-pdfs/2016/Combined%20Biosafety%20Case%20Studies%20final%20draft%20062116.pdf |archive-date=2016-11-09 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Safe trade''''' is a slogan advocated by [[Greenpeace]] in its desire to &quot;[[Green movement|green]]&quot; the [[World Trade Organization]] and the [[Doha Development Round]].  It is designed to compete with &quot;[[free trade]]&quot; as a concept.

Safe trade is generally seen as a single framework of rules worldwide to drastically inhibit the flow of alien [[organism]]s (e.g. [[Genetically modified organism]]s, [[imported animals]]) across the borders of [[ecoregion]]s, to preserve their natural wild [[biodiversity]].  It seeks to prevent [[ecological]] disasters caused by imported organisms or untested [[genetics|genetic]] [[technologies]], and to augment and increase local [[natural capital]] by encouraging soil remediation, [[precision agriculture]], and [[local consumption]] of the [[Endemic (ecology)|native]] [[species]], rather than imported organisms and heavy use of [[pesticide]]s.

==Proposal==
An important achievement of safe [[trade]] [[advocacy]] is the [[Biosafety Protocol]] agreed in [[Montreal]] in January 2000.  Although it relied on the weaker legal principle of [[Informed Consent]] and not the much stronger [[Precautionary Principle]] language sought by advocates, the [[Protocol (treaty)|protocol]] was considered by most to be a victory that could enhance both [[biosafety]] and [[biosecurity]].

Other safe trade reforms seek to advance [[sustainability]] by reducing reliance on [[energy]] [[subsidies]] and [[Petroleum|oil]]-based [[transport]], and (indirectly) improves [[Equity (economics)|equity]] in [[economic]] affairs - that is, it promotes a safer [[political economy]] which is more respectful of [[life]] in general.

Safe trade is a major goal of systems of [[Bioregional democracy]] and is often advocated alongside it, e.g. by [[Green movement|Greens]].  Both are also implicitly related to [[Community-Based Economics]], as local trade in local goods with no reliance on [[Alien (biology)|alien]] organisms presents no ecological risk to its [[genome]]s, [[soil]], or [[drainage basin]]s.  Accordingly, some advocates argue, local trade in any native species within an ecoregion's borders should not be taxed at all, as it presents little or no ecological risk compared to imported goods, and so requires little or no [[regulation]], labelling, [[inspection]], or other expenses.

The assumption that imports carry [[moral hazard]]s, and that [[tax, trade, tariff]] measures should compensate for harms done, is shared by advocates of [[fair trade]] whose programs address, in addition, more overt [[social justice]] concerns of [[human]] beings, such as the maintenance of the &quot;[[human capital]]&quot; of a region.  Both initiatives are alternatives to [[free trade]], which has no such controls, and generally permits and encourages free [[transport|transit]] in goods (but not, in general, labour) across ecological and social borders.

A broader understanding of [[biosecurity]] that is emerging under threat of [[biological warfare]], and the fear that such economically devastating events as the [[mad cow disease]] epidemic could recur, either deliberately (as an act of [[bioterrorism]]) or by accident due to unrestricted imports, is causing some nations, notably [[New Zealand]], to adopt relatively harsh restrictions against imported organisms.  As one objective of [[asymmetric warfare]] is to cause attacks to appear initially as accidents, or blame slow responses on apparently incompetent governments, there is some concern that spreading a virulent organism among animals would be an effective way to attack humans, damage economies, and discredit governments who are lax on [[biosecurity]].  Technologies for scanning for dangerous organisms at ports and markets are also becoming more reliable and less expensive.  However, no [[bio-defense]] solution seems to be able to compete with a simple reduction of import volumes, and its corresponding reduction in risk of any accidents.

==Reception==
===Opposition===
Critics of safe trade argue that the [[military]] and [[agriculture]] aspects of [[biosecurity]] are dissimilar, unlikely to converge in the form of an attack disguised as an accident, and require such differential prevention and response measures that there is little risk reduced in altering the [[fundamental structure]] of trade relationships to accommodate a robust regime of [[biosecurity]].  Such critics usually argue instead that emergency services' [[biodefense]] measures are sufficient to handle outbreaks of any diseases or alien organisms, and that such outbreaks are unlikely to be long sustained or deliberately masked as agricultural accidents.  This, to the advocates, seems like wishful thinking.

===Support===
Advocates point to the costs of emergency measures such as burning over one million cows suspected of having [[foot-and-mouth disease]] in the UK, smoke from which they calculated (based on [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]] levels) was to be expected to kill several hundred Britons from cancers in this generation.  Safe trade, they argue, would have removed the need for any such measures, as [[vaccination]] of British beef cattle would have been possible (the burning was to prevent British exports of beef from being rejected by its trade partners, who would not have been able to tell vaccinated from infected beef), and the foot-and-mouth disease was not so dangerous to humans that it could have justified dooming so many fellow citizens to die of the dioxin-caused cancers.  The burning, they argue, was justified only by bad trade rules that spread infection and advise dangerous cures that are worse than the ailment itself.

Another argument supporting safe trade rules is that there are links between [[primate]] extinction and [[deforestation]] in the regions where primates are abundant, i.e. the [[Amazon rainforest]], [[African rainforest]], and [[Sumatran rainforest]].  Fail to prevent devastating logging in these regions, advocates claim, and a [[Great Ape]] species will likely become extinct, causing a critical link to the human past to be permanently lost.  Accordingly, preventing logs from these forests from reaching foreign markets has been a major focus of [[Greenpeace]] actions, especially in 2002.

{{Distinguish|Biosafety}}

'''Biosecurity''' refers to measures aimed at preventing the introduction and/or spread of harmful [[organism]]s (e.g. [[virus]]es, [[bacteria]], etc.) to [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s in order to minimize the risk of transmission of [[infectious disease]]. In [[agriculture]], these measures are aimed at protecting [[food crop]]s and [[livestock]] from [[pest (organism)|pests]], [[invasive species]], and other organisms not conducive to the welfare of the [[human population]]. The term includes [[Biological pest control|biological threats]] to people, including those from [[pandemic]] diseases and [[bioterrorism]]. The definition has sometimes been broadened to embrace other concepts, and it is used for different purposes in different contexts.

The [[COVID-19 pandemic]] is a recent example of a threat for which biosecurity measures have been needed in all countries of the world.

==Background and terminology==
The term &quot;biosecurity&quot; has been defined differently by various disciplines. The term was first used by the [[agricultural]] and [[environmental science|environmental]] communities to describe preventative measures against threats from naturally occurring diseases and pests, later expanded to [[introduced species]]. Australia and New Zealand, among other countries, had incorporated this definition within their legislation by 2010.&lt;ref name=koblentz2010&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koblentz|first= Gregory D. |title=Biosecurity Reconsidered: Calibrating Biological Threats and Responses |journal=International Security |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=96–132 |year=2010 |doi=10.1162/isec.2010.34.4.96|s2cid= 57560210 }} [https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/isec.2010.34.4.96 Full text]&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand was the earliest adopter of a comprehensive approach with its [[Biosecurity Act 1993]]. In 2001, the US [[National Association of State Departments of Agriculture]] (NASDA) defined biosecurity as &quot;the sum of risk management practices in defense against biological threats&quot;, and its main goal as &quot;protect[ing] against the risk posed by disease and organisms&quot;.&lt;ref name=bioscience&gt;{{cite journal|journal=BioScience|volume=52|issue=7|date=July 2002|title=Biosecurity: Moving toward a Comprehensive Approach: A comprehensive approach to biosecurity is necessary to minimize the risk of harm caused by non-native organisms to agriculture, the economy, the environment, and human health|pages= 593–600|doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2002)052[0593:BMTACA]2.0.CO;2|first1=Laura A.|last1=Meyerson|first2=Jamie K. |last2=Reaser|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/52/7/593/248011|access-date=22 May 2020|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) provided an information note describing biosecurity as a strategic and integrated approach to analysing and managing relevant risks to human, animal and plant life and health and associated risks for the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Biosecurity: An integrated approach to manage risk to human, animal and plant life and health | website=WHO.int | date=3 March 2010 | url=https://www.who.int/foodsafety/fs_management/No_01_Biosecurity_Mar10_en.pdf | access-date=13 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another document, it describes the aim of biosecurity being &quot;to enhance the ability to protect [[human health]], agricultural production systems, and the people and industries that depend on them&quot;, with the overarching goal being &quot;to prevent, control and/or manage risks to life and health as appropriate to the particular biosecurity sector&quot;.&lt;ref name=infosan&gt;{{cite document|url=https://www.who.int/foodsafety/fs_management/No_01_Biosecurity_Mar10_en.pdf|title=Biosecurity: An integrated approach to manage risk to human, animal and plant life and health |publisher=World Health Organization &amp; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|author=International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN)|date=3 March 2010|series=INFOSAN Information Note No. 1/2010 - Biosecurity|access-date=23 May 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Measures taken to counter biosecurity risks typically include compulsory terms of [[quarantine]], and are put in place to minimise the risk of [[Invasive species in Australia|invasive pests]] or [[disease]]s arriving at a specific location that could damage crops and [[livestock]] as well as the wider environment.&lt;ref name=fitt2013&gt;{{cite web | last=Fitt | first=Gary | title=Explainer: why Australia needs biosecurity | website=The Conversation | date=15 November 2013 | url=http://theconversation.com/explainer-why-australia-needs-biosecurity-20105 | access-date=21 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the term is today taken to include managing [[Biological pest control|biological threats]] to people, industries or environment. These may be from foreign or [[endemic]] organisms, but they can also extend to [[pandemic]] diseases and the threat of [[bioterrorism]], both of which pose threats to [[public health]].&lt;ref name=fitt2013/&gt;

The definition has sometimes been broadened to embrace other concepts, and it is used for different purposes in different contexts. A 2016 draft handbook on biosecurity education produced by the Bradford Disarmament Research Centre at [[Bradford University]] in the UK, where the focus is on the dangers of &quot;dual-use&quot; research, defines the term as meaning &quot;successful minimising of the risks that the biological sciences will be deliberately or accidentally misused in a way which causes harm for humans, animals, plants or the environment, including through awareness and understanding of the risks&quot;.&lt;ref name=handbook&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.bradford.ac.uk/bioethics/Handbook_complete-draft.pdf|title= Biological Security Education Handbook: The Power of Team-Based Learning|first=Tatyana| last=Novossiolova |isbn=978-1-85143-278-3|date=January 2016|publisher=Bradford Disarmament Research Centre|access-date=22 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 1990s, in response to the threat of [[biological terrorism]], the term started to include the prevention of the theft of biological materials from [[research laboratories]], called &quot;laboratory biosecurity&quot; by WHO.&lt;ref name=koblentz2010/&gt; The term [[laboratory biosafety]] refers to the measures taken &quot;to reduce the risk of accidental release of or exposure to infectious disease agents&quot;, whereas laboratory biosecurity is usually taken to mean &quot;a set of systems and practices employed in legitimate bioscience facilities to reduce the risk that dangerous that dangerous biological agents will be stolen and used maliciously&quot;.&lt;ref name=labbio/&gt; Joseph Kanabrocki (2017) source elaborates: &quot;Biosafety focuses on protection of the researcher, their contacts and the environment via accidental release of a pathogen from containment, whether by direct release into the environment or by a laboratory-acquired infection. Conversely, biosecurity focuses on controlling access to pathogens of consequence and on the reliability of the scientists granted this access (thereby reducing the threat of an intentional release of a pathogen) and/or access to sensitive information related to a pathogen’s virulence, host-range, transmissibility, resistance to medical countermeasures, and environmental stability, among other things&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document|url=https://sites.nationalacademies.org/cs/groups/pgasite/documents/webpage/pga_176433.pdf|title=Biosafety and Biosecurity in the Realm of Dual-Use Research of Concern|first=Joseph|last= Kanabrocki|date=20 January 2017|page=2|access-date=23 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Dual Use Research of Concern in the Life Sciences: Current Issues and Controversies|chapter=3.

In the US, the National Science Advisory Board on Biosecurity was created in 2004 to provide biosecurity oversight of &quot;[[Dual-use technology|dual-use research]]&quot;, defined as &quot;biological research with legitimate scientific purpose that may be misused to pose a biological threat to [[public health]] and/or [[national security]]&quot;. In 2006, the [[National Academy of Sciences]] defined biosecurity as &quot;security against the inadvertent, inappropriate, or intentional malicious or malevolent use of potentially dangerous biological agents or [[biotechnology]], including the development, production, stockpiling, or use of biological weapons as well as outbreaks of newly emergent and epidemic disease&quot;.&lt;ref name=koblentz2010/&gt;

A number of nations have developed [[biological weapons]] for military use, and many civilian research projects in medicine have the potential to be used in military applications (dual-use research), so biosecurity [[protocol (science)|protocol]]s are used to prevent dangerous biological materials from falling into the hands of malevolent parties.&lt;ref name=koblentz2010/&gt;

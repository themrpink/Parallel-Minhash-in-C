====Flooding by dams====
Construction of dams has produced ghost towns that have been left underwater. Examples include the settlement of [[Loyston, Tennessee]], U.S., inundated by the creation of [[Norris Dam]]. The town was reorganised and reconstructed on nearby higher ground. Other examples are [[The Lost Villages]] of [[Ontario]] flooded by [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] construction in 1958, the hamlets of [[Nether Hambleton]] and [[Middle Hambleton]] in [[Rutland]], England, which were flooded to create [[Rutland Water]], and the villages of [[Ashopton]] and [[Derwent, Derbyshire|Derwent]], England, flooded during the construction of the [[Ladybower Reservoir]]. [[Mologa]] in Russia was flooded by the creation of [[Rybinsk reservoir]], and in France the [[Tignes Dam]] flooded the village of Tignes, displacing 78 families.{{Citation needed|reason=The wiki page for this dam does not mention and therefore does not cite the number of displaced families|date=June 2019}} Many ancient villages had to be abandoned during construction of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China, leading to the displacement of many rural people. In the Costa Rican province of Guanacaste, the town of [[Lake Arenal|Arenal]] was rebuilt to make room for the man-made [[Lake Arenal]]. The old town now lies submerged below the lake. [[Old Adaminaby]] was flooded by a dam of the [[Snowy River Scheme]]. Construction of the [[Aswan Dam|Aswan High Dam]] on the [[Nile River]] in Egypt submerged archaeological sites and ancient settlements such as [[Buhen]] under [[Lake Nasser]]. Another example of towns left underwater is [[Tehri]]; by the construction of the [[Tehri Dam]] in the Indian state of [[Uttarakhand]].

====Massacres====
[[File:Aghdam_6.jpg|thumb|left|Nature slowly reclaiming the ruins in [[Agdam]] (2010)]]
Some towns become deserted when their populations are [[massacre]]d. The original French village at [[Oradour-sur-Glane]] was destroyed on [[Oradour-sur-Glane massacre|10 June 1944]] when 642 of its 663 inhabitants were killed by a German [[Waffen-SS]] company. A new village was built after the war on a nearby site, and the ruins of the original have been maintained as a memorial.
Another example is [[Agdam]] city of [[Azerbaijan]]. Armenian forces occupied [[Agdam]] in July 1993 during the First Nagorno-Karabakh War. The heavy fighting forced the entire population to flee. Upon seizing the city, Armenian forces destroyed much of the town to discourage Azerbaijanis from returning. More damage occurred in the following decades when locals looted the abandoned town for building materials. It is currently almost entirely ruined and uninhabited.

===Disasters, actual and anticipated===
[[File:Craco0001.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Craco]], Italy, was abandoned due to a landslide in 1963. It has since become a popular film set.]]
Natural and man-made disasters can create ghost towns. For example, after being flooded more than 30 times since their town was founded in 1845, residents of [[Pattonsburg, Missouri]], decided to relocate after two floods in 1993. With government help, the whole town was rebuilt {{convert|3|mi}} away.

[[Craco]], a medieval village in the Italian region of [[Basilicata]], was evacuated after a landslide in 1963. Nowadays it is a famous filming location for many movies, including ''[[The Passion of The Christ]]'' by [[Mel Gibson]], ''[[Christ Stopped at Eboli (film)|Christ Stopped at Eboli]]'' by [[Francesco Rosi]], ''[[The Nativity Story]]'' by [[Catherine Hardwicke]] and ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'' by [[Marc Forster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/search/title?locations=Craco,%20Matera,%20Basilicata,%20Italy&amp;ref_=ttloc_loc_14|title=Most Popular Titles With Location Matching &quot;Craco, Matera, Basilicata, Italy&quot;|website=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, [[Centralia, Pennsylvania]] was abandoned due to an uncontainable [[mine fire]], which began in 1962 and still rages to this day; eventually the fire reached an abandoned mine underneath the nearby town of [[Byrnesville, Pennsylvania]], which caused that mine to catch on fire too and forced the evacuation of that town as well.

[[File:Pripyat-today.jpg|thumb|[[Prypiat|Pripyat]], Ukraine, was abandoned after the [[Chernobyl disaster]].]]
Ghost towns may also occasionally come into being due to an ''anticipated'' natural disaster – for example, the Canadian town of [[Lemieux, Ontario]] was abandoned in 1991 after soil testing revealed that the community was built on an unstable bed of [[Leda clay]]. Two years after the last building in Lemieux was demolished, a landslide swept part of the former town-site into the [[South Nation River]]. Two decades earlier, the Canadian town of [[Saint-Jean-Vianney, Quebec|Saint-Jean-Vianney]], Québec, also constructed on a Leda clay base, had been abandoned after a landslide on 4 May 1971, which swept away 41 homes, killing 31 people.

Following the [[Chernobyl disaster]] of 1986, dangerously high levels of nuclear contamination escaped into the surrounding area, and nearly 200 towns and villages in [[Ukraine]] and neighbouring [[Belarus]] were evacuated, including the cities of [[Pripyat]] and [[Chernobyl]]. The area was so contaminated that many of the evacuees were never permitted to return to their homes. Pripyat is the most famous of these abandoned towns; it was built for the workers of the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] and had a population of almost 50,000 at the time of the disaster.&lt;ref name=chernobyl&gt;{{cite book|last=Mould|first=R.

===Disease and contamination===

Significant fatality rates from epidemics have produced ghost towns. Some places in eastern [[Arkansas]] were abandoned after more than 7,000 Arkansans died during the [[Spanish flu]] epidemic of 1918 and 1919.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/14/8/1193.htm |volume=14 |issue= 8 |date=August 2008 |title=Deaths from Bacterial Pneumonia during 1918–19 Influenza Pandemic |last= Brundage |first=John F. |first2=G.

Catastrophic environmental damage caused by long-term contamination can also create a ghost town. Some notable examples are [[Times Beach, Missouri]], whose residents were exposed to a high level of [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]], and [[Wittenoom, Western Australia|Wittenoom]], [[Western Australia]], which was once Australia's largest source of [[blue asbestos]], but was shut down in 1966 due to health concerns. [[Treece, Kansas|Treece]] and [[Picher, Oklahoma|Picher]], twin communities straddling the [[Kansas]]–[[Oklahoma]] border, were once one of the United States' largest sources of [[zinc]] and [[lead]], but over a century of unregulated disposal of [[mine tailings]] led to groundwater contamination and lead poisoning in the town's children, eventually resulting in a mandatory [[Environmental Protection Agency]] buyout and evacuation. Contamination due to [[ammunition]] caused by military use may also lead to the development of ghost towns. [[Tyneham]], in [[Dorset]], was requisitioned for military exercises during the [[Second World War]], and remains unpopulated, being littered with unexploded munitions from regular shelling.

A few ghost towns get a second life, often due to [[heritage tourism]] generating a new economy able to support residents.

[[Alexandria]], the second-largest city of Egypt, was a flourishing city in the Ancient era, but declined during the Middle Ages. It underwent a dramatic revival during the 19th century; from a population of 5,000 in 1806, it grew into a city of more than 200,000 inhabitants by 1882,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ágoston |first1=Gábor |last2=Masters |first2=Bruce |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&amp;pg=PA33 |title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire |publisher=Infobase Publishing |page=33 |isbn=1438110251}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is now home to more than four million people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html The World Factbook – Egypt]. Central Intelligence Agency. Retrieved 13 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Algeria, many cities became hamlets after the end of [[Late Antiquity]]. They were revived with shifts in population during and after [[French Algeria|French colonization of Algeria]]. [[Oran]], currently the nation's second-largest city with 1 million people, was a village of only a few thousand people before colonization.

[[Foncebadón]], a village in [[province of León|León]], Spain that was mostly abandoned and only inhabited by a mother and son, is slowly being revived owing to the ever-increasing stream of pilgrims on the road to [[Santiago de Compostela]].

===Africa===

Wars and rebellions in some African countries have left many towns and villages deserted. Since 2003, when President [[François Bozizé]] came to power, thousands of citizens of the [[Central African Republic]] have been forced to flee their homes as a result of the escalating conflict between armed rebels and government troops. Villages accused of supporting the rebels, such as Beogombo Deux near [[Paoua]], are ransacked by government soldiers. Those who are not killed have no choice but to escape to refugee camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Thompson |first=Mike | title=Deserted villages and abandoned lives | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7779000/7779890.stm |work=BBC News |date=15 December 2008 |accessdate=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instability in the region also leaves organized and well-equipped bandits free to terrorize the populace, often leaving villages abandoned in their wake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Thompson |first=Mike | title=Massacre haunts CAR villagers | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7788626.stm |work=BBC News |date=18 December 2008 |accessdate=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere in Africa, the town of [[Lukangol]] was burnt to the ground during [[South Sudan internal conflict (2011–present)|tribal clashes in South Sudan]].

Many of the ghost towns in mineral-rich Africa are former mining towns. Shortly after the start of the 1908 [[diamond rush]] in [[German South-West Africa]], now known as [[Namibia]], the German Imperial government claimed sole mining rights by creating the ''[[Sperrgebiet]]'' (''forbidden zone''),&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;&gt;{{cite book|year=2001|title=Namibia Handbook: The Travel Guide &lt;!-- accessdate=24 May 2008 (deprecated)  --&gt;

The small mining towns of this area, among them [[Pomona, Namibia|Pomona]], [[Elizabeth Bay, Namibia|Elizabeth Bay]] and [[Kolmanskop]], were exempt from this ban, but the denial of new land claims soon rendered all of them ghost towns.

Many abandoned towns and settlements in the former [[Soviet Union]] were established near [[Gulag]] concentration camps to supply necessary services. Since most of these camps were abandoned in the 1950s, the towns were abandoned as well. One such town is located near the former Gulag camp called [[Butugychag]] (also called Lower Butugychag). Other towns were deserted due to deindustrialisation and the economic crises of the early 1990s attributed to [[post-Soviet conflicts]] – one example being [[Tkvarcheli]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], a coal mining town that suffered a drastic population decline as a result of the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–1993)|War in Abkhazia]] in the early 1990s.

===Antarctica===
[[File:Deception-Base.jpg|thumb|The derelict British base in Whalers Bay, [[Deception Island]], destroyed by a volcanic eruption]]
The oldest ghost town in [[Antarctica]] is on [[Deception Island]], where in 1906, a Norwegian-Chilean company set up a whaling station at Whalers Bay, which they used as a base for their factory ship, the ''Gobernador Bories''. Other whaling operations followed suit, and by 1914 there were thirteen factory ships based there. The station ceased to be profitable during the [[Great Depression]], and was abandoned in 1931. In 1969, the station was partially destroyed by a volcanic eruption. There are also many abandoned scientific and military bases in Antarctica, especially in the [[Antarctic Peninsula]].

The Antarctic island of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]] used to have several thriving whaling settlements during the first half of the 20th century, with a combined population exceeding 2,000 in some years. These included [[Grytviken]] (operating 1904–64), [[Leith Harbour]] (1909–65), [[Ocean Harbour]] (1909–20), [[Husvik]] (1910–60), [[Stromness (South Georgia)|Stromness]] (1912–61) and [[Prince Olav Harbour]] (1917–34). The abandoned settlements have become increasingly dilapidated, and remain uninhabited nowadays except for the Museum curator's family at [[Grytviken]]. The jetty, the church, dwellings and industrial buildings at [[Grytviken]] have recently been renovated by the South Georgian Government, becoming a popular tourist destination. Some historical buildings in the other settlements are being restored as well.

[[Urbanization]] – the migration of a country's rural population into the cities – has left many European towns and villages deserted. An increasing number of settlements in Bulgaria are becoming ghost towns for this reason; at the time of the 2011 census, the country had 181 uninhabited settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sofiaecho.com/2011/07/21/1126999_bulgarias-population-is-73-million-official-2011-census-results |title=Bulgaria's population is 7.3 million – official 2011 census results |newspaper=The Sofia Echo |date=21 July 2011 |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hungary, dozens of villages are also threatened with abandonment. The first village officially declared as &quot;dead&quot; was [[:hu:Gyűrűfű|Gyűrűfű]] in the late 1970s, but later it was repopulated as an eco-village. Some other depopulated villages were successfully saved as small rural resorts, such as [[Kán, Hungary|Kán]], [[Tornakápolna]], [[Szanticska]], [[Gorica, Hungary|Gorica]], and [[Révfalu]].

In Spain, large zones of the mountainous [[Iberian System]] and the [[Pyrenees]] have undergone heavy depopulation since the early 20th century, leaving a string of ghost towns in areas such as the [[Solana Valley]]. Traditional agricultural practices such as sheep and goat rearing, on which the mountain village economy was based, were not taken over by the local youth, especially after the lifestyle changes that swept over rural Spain during the second half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diariodeteruel.net/comarcas/30412-sos-mundo-rural-aragones-alerta-de-la-despoblacion-de-los-pueblos.html |title=Sos Mundo Rural Aragonés alerta de la despoblación de los pueblos |publisher=Diario de Teruel |language=Spanish |date=12 March 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315150215/http://www.diariodeteruel.net/comarcas/30412-sos-mundo-rural-aragones-alerta-de-la-despoblacion-de-los-pueblos.html |archive-date=15 March 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, thousands of villages were abandoned during the Middle Ages, as a result of [[Black Death]], climate change, revolts, and [[enclosure]], the process by which vast amounts of farmland became privately owned. Since there are rarely any visible remains of these settlements, they are not generally considered ghost towns; instead, they are referred to in archaeological circles as [[deserted medieval village]]s.

Sometimes, wars and genocide end a town's life. In 1944, occupying German Waffen-SS troops murdered almost the entire population of the French village [[Oradour-sur-Glane]]. A new settlement was built nearby after the war, but the old town was left depopulated on the orders of President [[Charles de Gaulle]], as a permanent memorial. In Germany, numerous smaller towns and villages in the [[former eastern territories of Germany|former eastern territories]] were completely destroyed in the last two years of the war. These territories later became part of [[Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union]], and many of the smaller settlements were never rebuilt or repopulated, for example [[Kłomino]] (''Westfalenhof''), [[Pstrąże]] (''Pstransse''), and [[Janowa Góra]] (''Johannesberg''). Some villages in England were also abandoned during the war, but for different reasons. [[Imber]], on [[Salisbury Plain]], and  several villages in the [[Stanford Battle Area]], were commandeered by the [[War Office]] for use as training grounds for British and US troops. Although this was intended to be a temporary measure, the residents were never allowed to return, and the villages have been used for military training ever since. Three miles southeast of Imber is [[Copehill Down]], a deserted village purpose-built for training in [[urban warfare]].

Disasters have played a part in the abandonment of settlements within Europe. After the [[Chernobyl disaster]] of 1986, the cities of [[Pripyat]] and [[Chernobyl]] were evacuated due to dangerous radiation levels within the area. As of today, Pripyat remains completely abandoned, and Chernobyl has around 500 remaining inhabitants.

====Canada====
{{See also|Lists of ghost towns in Canada}}
There are ghost towns in parts of [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]], [[Ontario]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], and [[Quebec]]. Some were logging towns or dual mining and logging sites, often [[company town|developed at the behest of the company]]. In Alberta and Saskatchewan, most ghost towns were once farming communities that have since died off due to the removal of the railway through the town or the bypass of a highway. The ghost towns in British Columbia were predominantly mining towns and prospecting camps as well as canneries and, in one or two cases, large smelter and pulp mill towns. British Columbia has more ghost towns than any other jurisdiction on the North American continent, with one estimate at the number of abandoned and semi-abandoned towns and localities upwards of 1500.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, Bruce (1963–1975). ''Ghost Towns of British Columbia&quot;. Vancouver: Mitchell Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most notable are [[Anyox]], [[Kitsault]], and [[Ocean Falls]].

Some ghost towns have revived their economies and populations due to historical and eco-tourism, such as [[Barkerville, British Columbia|Barkerville]]. Barkerville, once the largest town north of [[Kamloops]], is now a year-round provincial museum. In Quebec, [[Val-Jalbert, Quebec|Val-Jalbert]] is a well-known tourist ghost town; founded in 1901 around a mechanical [[pulp mill]] that became obsolete when [[paper mill]]s began to break down [[wood fibre]] by chemical means, it was abandoned when the mill closed in 1927 and re-opened as a park in 1960.

Many ghost towns or abandoned [[unincorporated area|communities]] exist in the American [[Great Plains]], the rural areas of which have lost a third of their population since 1920. Thousands of communities in the northern plains states of [[Montana]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]], and [[South Dakota]] became railroad ghost towns when a rail line failed to materialize. Hundreds of towns were abandoned as the [[Interstate highway system]] replaced the railroads as the favored means of transportation. Ghost towns are common in mining or [[mill town]]s in all the western states, and many eastern and southern states as well. Residents are compelled to leave in search of more productive areas when the resources that had created an employment boom in these towns were eventually exhausted. Some unincorporated towns become ghost towns due to flooding caused by dam projects that created man{{endash}}made lakes, such as [[Oketeyeconne, Georgia|Oketeyeconne]].

Sometimes a ghost town consists of many abandoned buildings as in [[Bodie, California]], or standing ruins as in [[Rhyolite, Nevada]], while elsewhere only the foundations of former buildings remain as in [[Graysonia, Arkansas]]. Old mining camps that have lost most of their population at some stage of their history such as [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]], [[Oatman, Arizona|Oatman]], [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]] and [[Virginia City, Montana|Virginia City]] are sometimes referred to as ghost towns although they are presently active towns and cities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Many U.S. ghost towns, such as [[South Pass City, Wyoming|South Pass City in Wyoming]]&lt;ref&gt;Weis, Norman D.

Some of the earliest settlements in the US, though they no longer exist in any tangible sense, once had the characteristics of a ghost town. In 1590, mapmaker [[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]] arrived at the [[Roanoke Colony]], North Carolina to find it deserted, its inhabitants having vanished without a trace. The [[Zwaanendael Colony]] became a ghost town when every one of the colonists was massacred by Indians in 1632. [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], the first permanent English settlement in the Americas, was abandoned when [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] became the new capital of the colony in 1699. &lt;!-- Consider removing this paragraph, off topic --&gt;

Starting in 2002, an attempt to declare an official ghost town in California stalled when the adherents of the town of [[Bodie, California|Bodie]] and those of [[Calico, San Bernardino County, California|Calico]], in [[Southern California]], could not agree on the most deserving settlement for the recognition. A compromise was eventually reached–Bodie became the official state [[gold rush]] ghost town, while Calico was named the official state [[silver rush]] ghost town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netstate.com/states/symb/towns/ca_gold_rush_ghost_town.htm |title=California State Gold Rush Ghost Town |publisher=NetState |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a wave of European immigrants arrived in Brazil and settled in the cities, which offered jobs, education, and other opportunities that enabled newcomers to enter the middle class. Many also settled in the growing small towns along the expanding railway system. Since the 1930s, many rural workers have moved to the big cities. Other ghost towns were created in the aftermath of dinosaur fossil rushes.

In [[Colombia]], a [[Armero tragedy|volcano erupted]] in 1985, where the city of Armero was engulfed by lahars, which killed approximately 23000 people in total. The city of Armero was never rebuilt (its inhabitants being diverted to nearby cities, and thus becoming a ghost town), but still stands today as &quot;holy land&quot;, as dictated by Pope John Paul II.

A number of ghost towns throughout South America were once mining camps or lumber mills, such as the many [[sodium nitrate|saltpeter]] mining camps that prospered in Chile from the end of the [[War of the Pacific|Saltpeter War]] until the invention of synthetic saltpeter during World War I. Some of these towns, such as the [[Humberstone and Santa Laura Saltpeter Works]] in the [[Atacama Desert]], have been declared [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]s. Another former mining town, [[Real de Catorce]] in Mexico, has been used as a backdrop for Hollywood movies such as ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' (1948), ''[[The Mexican]]'' (2001), and ''[[Bandidas]]'' (2006).

===Oceania===
The boom and bust of gold rushes and the mining of other ores has led to a number of ghost towns in both Australia and New Zealand. Other towns have become abandoned whether due to natural disasters, the weather, or the drowning of valleys to increase the size of lakes.

In Australia, the [[Victoria gold rush]] led to numerous ghost towns (such as [[Cassilis, Victoria|Cassilis]] and [[Moliagul]]), as did the hunt for gold in [[Western Australia]] (for example, the towns of [[Ora Banda]] and [[Kanowna, Western Australia|Kanowna]]). The mining of iron and other ores has also led to towns thriving briefly before dwindling.

In New Zealand, the [[Otago gold rush]] similarly led to several ghost towns (such as [[Macetown]]). New Zealand's ghost towns also include numerous coal mining areas in the South Island's [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast Region]], including [[Denniston, New Zealand|Denniston]] and [[Stockton, New Zealand|Stockton]]. Natural disasters have also led to the loss of some towns, notably [[Te Wairoa (village)|Te Wairoa]], &quot;The Buried Village&quot;, destroyed in the [[1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera]], and the Otago town of [[Kelso, New Zealand|Kelso]], abandoned after it was flooded repeatedly after heavy rainstorms. Early settlements on the rugged southwest coast of the South Island at [[Martins Bay]] and [[Port Craig]] were also abandoned, mainly due to the inhospitable terrain.

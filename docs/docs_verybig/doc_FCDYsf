The relationship between the two gives the sign meaning. The relationship can be explained further by considering what we mean by &quot;meaning.&quot; In pragmatics, there are two different types of meaning to consider: '''semantic-referential meaning''' and '''indexical meaning.''' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Treanor|first=Fergal|title=Pragmatics and Indexicality - A very short overview|url=https://www.academia.edu/20180760|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;Semantic-referential meaning refers to the aspect of meaning, which describes events in the world that are independent of the circumstance they are uttered in. An example would be propositions such as:

:''&quot;Santa Claus eats cookies.&quot;''

In this case, the proposition is describing that Santa Claus eats cookies. The meaning of the proposition does not rely on whether or not Santa Claus is eating cookies at the time of its utterance. Santa Claus could be eating cookies at any time and the meaning of the proposition would remain the same. The meaning is simply describing something that is the case in the world. In contrast, the proposition, &quot;Santa Claus is eating a cookie right now,&quot; describes events that are happening at the time the proposition is uttered.

Semantic-referential meaning is also present in meta-semantical statements such as:

:''Tiger: carnivorous, a mammal''

If someone were to say that a tiger is a carnivorous animal in one context and a mammal in another, the definition of tiger would still be the same. The meaning of the sign tiger is describing some animal in the world, which does not change in either circumstance.

[[Indexical]] meaning, on the other hand, is dependent on the context of the utterance and has rules of use. By rules of use, it is meant that indexicals can tell you when they are used, but not what they actually mean.

:''Example'': &quot;I&quot;

Whom &quot;I&quot; refers to depends on the context and the person uttering it.

As mentioned, these meanings are brought about through the relationship between the signified and the signifier. One way to define the relationship is by placing signs in two categories: '''referential indexical signs,''' also called &quot;shifters,&quot; and '''pure indexical signs.'''

Referential indexical signs are signs where the meaning shifts depending on the context hence the nickname &quot;shifters.&quot; 'I' would be considered a referential indexical sign. The referential aspect of its meaning would be '1st person singular' while the indexical aspect would be the person who is speaking (refer above for definitions of semantic-referential and indexical meaning). Another example would be:

:''&quot;This&quot;''
:''Referential: singular count''
:''Indexical: Close by''

A pure indexical sign does not contribute to the meaning of the propositions at all. It is an example of a &quot;non-referential use of language.&quot;

A second way to define the signified and signifier relationship is [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.S. Peirce]]'s '''Peircean Trichotomy'''. The components of the trichotomy are the following:

:1. '''Icon''': the signified resembles the signifier (signified: a dog's barking noise, signifier: bow-wow)&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cs.indiana.edu/~port/teach/103/sign.symbol.short.html|title=Icon, Index and Symbol: Types of Signs|website=www.cs.indiana.edu|access-date=2019-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:2. '''Index''': the signified and signifier are linked by proximity or the signifier has meaning only because it is pointing to the signified&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;
:3. '''Symbol''': the signified and signifier are arbitrarily linked (signified: a cat, signifier: the word cat)&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

These relationships allow us to use signs to convey what we want to say. If two people were in a room and one of them wanted to refer to a characteristic of a chair in the room he would say &quot;this chair has four legs&quot; instead of &quot;a chair has four legs.&quot; The former relies on context (indexical and referential meaning) by referring to a chair specifically in the room at that moment while the latter is independent of the context (semantico-referential meaning), meaning the concept chair.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

==Nonreferential uses of language==
===Silverstein's &quot;pure&quot; indexes===
[[Michael Silverstein]] has argued that &quot;nonreferential&quot; or &quot;pure&quot; indices do not contribute to an utterance's referential meaning but instead &quot;signal some particular value of one or more contextual variables.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Silverstein 1976&lt;/ref&gt; Although nonreferential indexes are devoid of semantico-referential meaning, they do encode &quot;pragmatic&quot; meaning.

The sorts of contexts that such indexes can mark are varied. Examples include:
* '''Sex indexes''' are affixes or inflections that index the sex of the speaker, e.g. the verb forms of female [[Koasati language|Koasati]] speakers take the suffix &quot;-s&quot;.
* '''Deference indexes''' are words that signal social differences (usually related to status or age) between the speaker and the addressee. The most common example of a deference index is the V form in a language with a [[T-V distinction]], the widespread phenomenon in which there are multiple second-person pronouns that correspond to the addressee's relative status or familiarity to the speaker. [[Honorific]]s are another common form of deference index and demonstrate the speaker's respect or esteem for the addressee via special forms of address and/or self-humbling first-person pronouns.
* An '''Affinal taboo index''' is an example of [[avoidance speech]] that produces and reinforces sociological distance, as seen in the Aboriginal [[Dyirbal language]] of Australia. In that language and some others, there is a social taboo against the use of the everyday lexicon in the presence of certain relatives (mother-in-law, child-in-law, paternal aunt's child, and maternal uncle's child). If any of those relatives are present, a Dyirbal speaker has to switch to a completely separate lexicon reserved for that purpose.

In all of these cases, the semantico-referential meaning of the utterances is unchanged from that of the other possible (but often impermissible) forms, but the pragmatic meaning is vastly different.

===The performative===
{{main article|Performative utterance|Speech act theory}}

[[J.L. Austin]] introduced the concept of the [[Performative utterance|performative]], contrasted in his writing with &quot;constative&quot; (i.e. descriptive) utterances. According to Austin's original formulation, a performative is a type of utterance characterized by two distinctive features:

* It is not [[logical value|truth-evaluable]] (i.e. it is neither true nor false)
* Its uttering ''performs'' an action rather than simply describing one

Examples:
* &quot;I hereby pronounce you man and wife.&quot;
* &quot;I accept your apology.&quot;
* &quot;This meeting is now adjourned.&quot;

To be performative, an utterance must conform to various conditions involving what Austin calls [[felicity conditions|felicity]]. These deal with things like appropriate context and the speaker's authority. For instance, when a couple has been arguing and the husband says to his wife that he accepts her apology even though she has offered nothing approaching an apology, his assertion is infelicitous: because she has made neither expression of regret nor request for forgiveness, there exists none to accept, and thus no act of accepting can possibly happen.

===Jakobson's six functions of language===
{{main article|Jakobson's functions of language}}
[[File:Roma jakobson theory.png|right|thumb|The six factors of an effective verbal communication. To each one corresponds a communication function (not displayed in this picture).&lt;ref name=&quot;Middleton&quot;&gt;Middleton, Richard (1990/2002). ''Studying Popular Music'', p. 241. Philadelphia: Open University Press. {{ISBN|0-335-15275-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Roman Jakobson]], expanding on the work of [[Karl Bühler]], described six &quot;constitutive factors&quot; of a [[speech act|speech event]], each of which represents the privileging of a corresponding function, and only one of which is the referential (which corresponds to the '''context''' of the speech event). The six constitutive factors and their corresponding functions are diagrammed below.

'''The six constitutive factors of a speech event'''

:::Context
:::Message
Addresser---------------------Addressee
:::Contact
:::Code
&lt;br /&gt;
'''The six functions of language'''

:::Referential
:::Poetic
Emotive-----------------------Conative
:::Phatic
:::Metalingual

* The Referential Function corresponds to the factor of Context and describes a situation, object or mental state. The descriptive statements of the referential function can consist of both definite descriptions and [[deixis|deictic]] words, e.g. &quot;The autumn leaves have all fallen now.&quot;
* The Expressive (alternatively called &quot;emotive&quot; or &quot;affective&quot;) Function relates to the Addresser and is best exemplified by [[interjections]] and other sound changes that do not alter the [[denotation|denotative meaning]] of an utterance but do add information about the Addresser's (speaker's) internal state, e.g. &quot;Wow, what a view!&quot;
* The Conative Function engages the Addressee directly and is best illustrated by [[vocative]]s and [[imperative mood|imperatives]], e.g. &quot;Tom! Come inside and eat!&quot;
* The Poetic Function focuses on &quot;the message for its own sake&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Duranti 1997&quot;&gt;Duranti 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and is the operative function in poetry as well as slogans.
* The [[Phatic]] Function is language for the sake of interaction and is therefore associated with the Contact factor. The Phatic Function can be observed in greetings and casual discussions of the weather, particularly with strangers.
* The Metalingual (alternatively called &quot;metalinguistic&quot; or &quot;reflexive&quot;) Function is the use of language (what Jakobson calls &quot;Code&quot;) to discuss or describe itself.

==Related fields==
There is considerable overlap between pragmatics and [[sociolinguistics]], since both share an interest in [[linguistic meaning]] as determined by usage in a speech community. However, sociolinguists tend to be more interested in variations in language within such communities.

Pragmatics helps anthropologists relate elements of language to broader social phenomena; it thus pervades the field of [[linguistic anthropology]]. Because pragmatics describes generally the forces in play for a given utterance, it includes the study of power, gender, race, identity, and their interactions with individual speech acts. For example, the study of [[Code-switching|code switching]] directly relates to pragmatics, since a switch in code effects a shift in pragmatic force.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duranti 1997&quot;/&gt;

According to [[Charles W. Morris]], pragmatics tries to understand the relationship between signs and their users, while [[semantics]] tends to focus on the actual objects or ideas to which a word refers, and [[syntax]] (or &quot;syntactics&quot;) examines relationships among signs or symbols. Semantics is the literal meaning of an idea whereas pragmatics is the implied meaning of the given idea.

[[Speech act|Speech Act Theory]], pioneered by [[J.L. Austin]] and further developed by [[John Searle]], centers around the idea of the [[performative]], a type of utterance that performs the very action it describes. Speech Act Theory's examination of [[Illocutionary act|Illocutionary Acts]] has many of the same goals as pragmatics, as outlined [[Pragmatics#Areas of interest|above]].

Computational Pragmatics, as defined by [[Victoria Fromkin]], concerns how humans can communicate their intentions to computers with as little ambiguity as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Language|last=Fromkin|first=Victoria|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|year=2014|isbn=978-1133310686|location=Boston, Ma.|pages=508}}&lt;/ref&gt; That process, integral to the science of [[natural language processing]] (seen as a sub-discipline of [[artificial intelligence]]), involves providing a computer system with some database of knowledge related to a topic and a series of algorithms, which control how the system responds to incoming data, using contextual knowledge to more accurately approximate natural human language and information processing abilities. Reference resolution, how a computer determines when two objects are different or not, is one of the most important tasks of computational pragmatics. 

==Formalization==

There has been a great amount of discussion on the boundary between semantics and pragmatics &lt;ref&gt;[http://web.stanford.edu/group/cslipublications/cslipublications/site/9781575866673.shtml see for instance F.Domaneschi. C. Penco, What is Said and What is Not, CSLI Publication, Stanford]&lt;/ref&gt; and there are many different formalizations of aspects of pragmatics linked to context dependence. Particularly interesting cases are the discussions on the semantics of indexicals and the problem of referential descriptions, a topic developed after the theories of [[Keith Donnellan]].&lt;ref&gt;see for instance S. Neale, Descriptions, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; A proper logical theory of formal pragmatics has been developed by [[Carlo Dalla Pozza]], according to which it is possible to connect classical semantics (treating propositional contents as true or false) and intuitionistic semantics (dealing with illocutionary forces). The presentation of a formal treatment of pragmatics appears to be a development of the Fregean idea of assertion sign as formal sign of the act of assertion.

==In literary theory==

Pragmatics (more specifically, [[Speech act|Speech Act Theory]]'s notion of the [[performative]]) underpins [[Judith Butler]]'s theory of [[gender performativity]]. In ''[[Gender Trouble]]'', she claims that gender and sex are not natural categories, but socially constructed roles produced by &quot;reiterative acting.&quot;

In [[Judith Butler#Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative|''Excitable Speech'']] she extends her theory of [[performativity]] to [[hate speech]] and [[censorship]], arguing that censorship necessarily strengthens any discourse it tries to suppress and therefore, since the state has sole power to define hate speech legally, it is the state that makes hate speech performative.

[[Jacques Derrida]] remarked that some work done under Pragmatics aligned well with the program he outlined in his book ''[[Of Grammatology]]''.

[[Émile Benveniste]] argued that the [[pronouns]] &quot;I&quot; and &quot;you&quot; are fundamentally distinct from other pronouns because of their role in creating the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]].

[[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] discuss linguistic pragmatics in the fourth chapter of ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (&quot;November 20, 1923--Postulates of Linguistics&quot;). They draw three conclusions from Austin: (1) A [[performative utterance]] does not communicate information about an act second-hand, but it is the act; (2) Every aspect of language (&quot;semantics, syntactics, or even phonematics&quot;) functionally interacts with pragmatics; (3) There is no distinction between language and speech. This last conclusion attempts to refute [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure's]] division between [[langue and parole|''langue'' and ''parole'']] and [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky's]] distinction between [[deep structure and surface structure]] simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze, Gilles]] and [[Félix Guattari]] (1987) [1980].

'''Luchino Visconti di Modrone''', Count of [[Lonate Pozzolo]] ({{IPA-it|luˈkiːno visˈkonti di moˈdroːne|lang}}; 2 November 1906 – 17 March 1976), was an Italian theatre, opera and cinema director, as well as a screenwriter. Visconti was one of the fathers of [[Italian neorealism]] in film, but later moved towards luxurious-looking films obsessed with beauty, death and European history – especially the decay of aristocracy. Among his best-known films are ''[[Ossessione]]'' (1943), ''[[Senso (film)|Senso]]'' (1954), ''[[Rocco and His Brothers]]'' (1960), ''[[The Leopard (1963 film)|The Leopard]]&lt;ref&gt;'THE LEOPARD' IN ITS ORIGINAL LAIR: Care and Authenticity Mark screen Version of Modern Classic

The configuration of the early village was strongly influenced by geography. As early as 1799 a bridge was constructed across the Winooski River to [[Berlin, Vermont|Berlin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.montpelier-vt.org/552/About-Montpelier|title=About Montpelier {{!}} Montpelier, VT|website=www.montpelier-vt.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Town's Charter was reissued on February 6, 1804, to include a boundary description of the lands granted to the Town's inhabitants and proprietors.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The confluence of the Winooski, North Branch and Dog Rivers provided a central point for the local population and commerce.

By 1805 the town had a population of 1,200. In that year the state legislature sought a permanent home. Montpelier was selected because of its central location and accessibility, and because local residents provided land and money. A humble State House was soon constructed on State Street.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

In 1825, the [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]] visited Montpelier on a triumphal tour of the United States, 50 years after the Revolutionary War.

The town developed into a center for manufacturing, especially after the [[Central Vermont Railway]] opened in Montpelier on June 20, 1849. In response to Montpelier's growth and changing demographics, on November 9, 1848, the General Assembly divided the original Town into two district municipal corporations. The towns of East Montpelier and Montpelier were created. Later on, in an attempt to modernize its form of government, the town was reconstituted as the Village of Montpelier.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

By 1858, the layout of the main streets paralleling the rivers was in place. The downtown street pattern has changed very little since that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

Ten thousand people turned out to greet Major General [[Philip Sheridan]] when he visited to address the fourth annual meeting of Vermont former Union officers. He particularly thanked Vermont veterans of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] for their performance at the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DUjDdl0YyzUC&amp;q=sheridan+address+vermont+October+30+1867+montpelier&amp;pg=PT589|title=Something Abides: Discovering the Civil War in Today's Vermont|last=Coffin|first=Howard|date=6 May 2013|publisher=The Countryman Press|isbn=9781581577778|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huegenin|first=Joan|date=May 18, 2016|title=Reunion Society of Vermont Officers|journal=Journal of the Northeast Kingdom Civil War Roundtable|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875, a large fire destroyed many downtown buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;!---tertiary citation. Would prefer secondary---&gt;

The village had the first municipal water driven hydro system in Vermont in 1884. Water pressure generated sufficient electricity for streetlights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Power from the plumbing|last=Barg|first=Lori|date=9 August 2009|work==Burlington Free Press|location=Burlington, Vermont|pages=5D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first charter of Montpelier was granted in 1894, and was amended shortly thereafter in 1898, and again in 1900 and 1912. The first amendment permitted the city to annex a part of the Town of Berlin; the latter enactments amended the 1898 charter to deal with such matters as water works, the relationship between the city and the Washington County Grammar School, and composition of the City Council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The state proclaimed October 12, 1899, as &quot;Dewey Day&quot; to honor native son [[George Dewey]], the hero of [[Battle of Manila Bay]] in the [[Spanish–American War]]. Thousands turned out from the state to his hometown of Montpelier for the celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vermonthistory.org/documents/findaid/dewey.pdf |title=George Dewey (1837–1917) Family Papers, 1844–1901 MS 125 |accessdate=April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---doubtless the ONLY day the state has ever celebrated a living person---&gt;&lt;!--plenty of footnotes available BTW if you don't like this one---&gt; In 1899, [[Hubbard Park (Montpelier, Vermont)|Hubbard Park]] was established with a donation of land, known as &quot;Hubbard Hill&quot;, bequeathed to the City of Montpelier by John Erastus Hubbard (1847–1899) with the intent to &quot;preserve wilderness&quot; for future generations. In 1911, additional land was donated and from 1915 to 1930 an observation tower was constructed on this donated land.

In 1927, after a particularly wet summer and fall, heavy rains began on the evening of November 2 that continued until the morning of November 4. The heaviest rain fell on November 3, when more than seven inches fell in a six-hour period. The prolonged heavy rains on top of the already saturated soil from the summer and fall proved to be more than the watercourses could handle. Brooks and rivers overflowed carrying trees and logs in their wake. Dams, bridges and embankments were destroyed. Buildings were submerged, farm animals drowned, and homes and barns were swept away. Rivers reached 13 feet or more above their normal depths. Flood waters gradually receded, leaving behind silt, gravel and debris. At least a foot of mud was left on the floors of downtown stores.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vermonthistory.org/research/research-resources-online/green-mountain-chronicles/the-flood-of-27-1927|title=The Flood of '27, 1927 - Vermont Historical Society|website=vermonthistory.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time only two stores in Montpelier carried flood insurance. The staggering loss represented an average of $400 for every man, woman, and child in town &amp;ndash; equivalent to roughly $5,760 in 2018 dollars. In the days following the flood, Vermont was widely praised for its recovery efforts. President [[Calvin Coolidge]], in particular, hailed the “indomitable spirit” of Vermonters, of whom he was one.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

In response to the damage suffered by Montpelier and surrounding communities in the [[Great Vermont Flood of 1927|Great Flood of 1927]], the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] built the Wrightsville Dam during a period from 1933 to 1935. The resulting reservoir, [[Wrightsville Reservoir]], required the disbandment and flooding of the village of Wrightsville, which contained at least 30 built structures at the time.

The City of Montpelier grew slowly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries during the period of intensive out-migration from the state to new lands in the West, or to industrial centers elsewhere in New England. Montpelier was already established as a government, market, service and industrial center in the region. When the automobile arrived, new state highways were routed to the city limits, and traffic then circulated through the original streets of the city. In 1954, a new bridge was constructed at Bailey Avenue which linked to an extension of Winooski Avenue, now Memorial Drive, and diverted some of the traffic from the downtown area.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

An early spring thaw in March 1992 caused an ice jam to form in the Winooski River downstream of the Bailey Avenue bridge in Montpelier.  In less than an hour, water levels in the Winooski and North Branch rivers rose upstream of the ice jam and flooded downtown Montpelier.  The damage shut down 120 businesses, left 50 residents without homes, disrupted the operations the state government, and caused upwards of $5 million in damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vermont's capital braces for possible river flooding |url=http://archive.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/03/12/vermonts_capital_braces_for_possible_river_flooding/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

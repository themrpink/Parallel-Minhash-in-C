=== [[Oligopoly]] ===

In an oligopoly market structure, the market is supplied by a small number of firms (more than 2). Moreover, there are so few firms that the actions of one firm can influence the actions of the other firms. Under this market structure, the differentiation of products may or may not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=3 Different Forms of Imperfect Competition |url=http://www.economicsdiscussion.net/imperfect-competition/forms/3-different-forms-of-imperfect-competition-market-situation/13773 |website=Economics discussion |publisher=Saqib Shaikh |accessdate=1 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The product they sell may or may not be differentiated and there are barriers to entry: natural, cost, market size,... or dissuasive strategies.

In an oligopoly, barriers to market entry and exit are high. The major barriers are:

* [[Patents]]; 
* Technology;
* [[Economies of scale]];
* Government regulation (e.g. limiting the issuance of licences); and 
* Firm name recognition. &lt;ref&gt; Kifle, T. (2020). ''Lecture 6: Competitors and Competition (Part II) [PowerPoint Slides]'' . ''Unpublished Manuscript, ECON2410, University of Queensland, St Lucia, Australia''. &lt;/ref&gt;

If two firms collude, they form a [[cartel]] to reduce output and increase their firms' profitability. Oil companies, grocery stores and some telecommunication companies are examples of oligopolies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Perfect vs. Imperfect Competition: What's the Difference? |url=https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032515/what-difference-between-perfect-and-imperfect-competition.asp |website=Investopedia |publisher=GREG DEPERSIO |accessdate=5 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Duopoly]] ===

A special type of Oligopoly, where two firms have exclusive power and control in a market. It is a particular case of oligopoly, so it can be said that it is an intermediate situation between monopoly and perfect competition economy. Hence, it is the most basic form of oligopoly. &lt;ref&gt; Kifle, T. (2020). ''Lecture 5: Competitors and Competition (Part I) [PowerPoint Slides]'' . ''Unpublished Manuscript, ECON2410, University of Queensland, St Lucia, Australia''. &lt;/ref&gt;


=== [[Monopoly]] ===

In a monopoly market, there is only one offerer and there is a plurality of buyers; it is a firm with no competitors in its industry. The monopolist has market power, that is, it can influence the price of the good. Moreover, a monopoly is the sole provider of a good or service and thus, faces no competition in the output market. Hence, there are significant barriers to market entry, such as, patents, market size, control of some raw material. Examples of monopolies include public utilities (water, electricity) and [[Australia Post]]. 
&lt;ref name=&quot;123a&quot;&gt;Robert Pindyck and Daniel Rubinfeld. (2013). Microeconomics. United States: PEARSON INDIA; Edición: 8th (2017)&lt;/ref&gt; A monopolist faces a downward sloping demand curve. Thus, as the monopolist raises its price, it sells fewer units. 

Hence, a monopolist's:

* '''Output''' is below the level of a [[perfectly competitive market]]; but 
* '''Price''' is above [[marginal cost]]. &lt;ref&gt; Kifle, T. (2020). ''Lecture 6: Competitors and Competition (Part II) [PowerPoint Slides]'' . ''Unpublished Manuscript, ECON2410, University of Queensland, St Lucia, Australia''. &lt;/ref&gt;

Another feature of monopolies is [[rent seeking]], whereby monopoly firms engage in spending money to maintain and exercise its monopoly power. This is undertaken through advertising, lobbying and building excess capacity to deter competitors from entering the market. 

A firm is a [[monopsonist]] if it faces small levels, or no competition in '''ONE''' of its output markets. A [[natural monopoly]] occurs when it is cheaper for a single firm to provide all of the market's output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Economics of the Public Sector |publisher=Joseph E. Stiglitz |location=New York, USA |isbn=0-393-96651-8 |page=78 |edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


== Intensity of price competition ==

The intensity of [[price competition]] is another good measure of how much control a firm within a market structure has over price. The '''Herfindahl Index''' provides a measure of firm concentration within a market and is the '''sum of the squared market shares of all the firms in the market''' (Herfindahl Index = (S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = market share of firm i) . The value of the index ranges from 1/N to 1 (where ''N'' is the number of firms in the market). Thus, the more concentrated the market is, the larger the value of the Herfindahl Index will be. &lt;ref&gt; Kifle, T. (2020). ''Lecture 5: Competitors and Competition (Part I) [PowerPoint Slides]'' . ''Unpublished Manuscript, ECON2410, University of Queensland, St Lucia, Australia''. &lt;/ref&gt; The table below provides an overview of price competition and intensity in the four main classes of market structure. 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-
! Market Structure !! Range of Herfindahls !! Intensity of Price Competition

'''Political ecology''' is the study of the relationships between political, economic and social factors with environmental issues and changes. Political ecology differs from apolitical ecological studies by politicizing environmental issues and phenomena.

The academic discipline offers wide-ranging studies integrating ecological social sciences with [[political economy]]&lt;ref&gt;Peet and Watts, 1996, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; in topics such as degradation and marginalization, environmental conflict, conservation and control, and environmental identities and social movements.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

The term &quot;political ecology&quot; was first coined by Frank Thone in an article published in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Nature Rambling: We Fight for Grass,&quot; ''The Science Newsletter'' 27, 717, Jan. 5: 14.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been widely used since then in the context of [[human geography]] and [[human ecology]], but with no systematic definition. Anthropologist [[Eric R. Wolf]] gave it a second life in 1972 in an article entitled &quot;Ownership and Political Ecology&quot;, in which he discusses how local rules of ownership and inheritance &quot;mediate between the pressures emanating from the larger society and the exigencies of the local ecosystem&quot;, but did not develop the concept further&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, 1972, p.202.&lt;/ref&gt; Other origins include other early works of [[Eric R. Wolf]], [[Michael J. Watts]], [[Susanna Hecht]], and others in the 1970s and 1980s.

The origins of the field in the 1970s and 1980s were a result of the development of [[development geography]] and [[cultural ecology]].,&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, 1998, p.80.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the work of [[Piers Blaikie]] on the sociopolitical origins of soil erosion.&lt;ref&gt;Piers Blaikie, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, political ecology has focused on phenomena in and affecting the developing world; since the field's inception, &quot;research has sought primarily to understand the political dynamics surrounding material and discursive struggles over the environment in the third world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, 1998, p.89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars in political ecology are drawn from a variety of academic disciplines, including geography, anthropology, development studies, political science, economics, sociology, forestry, and environmental history.

[[Petra Kelly]] is one of the founding figures of political ecologist parties throughout [[Germany]] and [[Europe]].

==Overview==
Political ecology's broad scope and interdisciplinary nature lends itself to multiple definitions and understandings. However, common assumptions across the field give the term relevance. [[Raymond L. Bryant]] and Sinéad Bailey developed three fundamental assumptions in practising political ecology:

* First, changes in the environment do not affect society in a homogenous way: political, social, and economic differences account for uneven distribution of costs and benefits.
* Second,  &quot;any change in environmental conditions must affect the political and economic status quo.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bryant and Bailey, 1997, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Third, the unequal distribution of costs and benefits and the reinforcing or reducing of pre-existing inequalities has political implications in terms of the altered power relationships that then result.

In addition, political ecology attempts to provide critiques and alternatives in the interplay of the environment and political, economic and social factors. Paul Robbins asserts that the discipline has a &quot;normative understanding that there are very likely better, less coercive, less exploitative, and more sustainable ways of doing things&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Robbins, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

From these assumptions, political ecology can be used to:
* inform policymakers and organizations of the complexities surrounding environment and development, thereby contributing to better environmental governance.
* understand the decisions that communities make about the natural environment in the context of their political environment, economic pressure, and societal regulations
* look at how unequal relations in and among societies affect the natural environment, especially in context of government policy.

==Scope and influences==

Political ecology's movement as a field since its inception in the 1970s has complicated its scope and goals. Through the discipline's history, certain influences have grown more and less influential in determining the focus of study. Peter A. Walker traces the importance of the ecological sciences in political ecology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker-2005-74&quot;&gt;Walker, 2005, p.74.&lt;/ref&gt;  He points to the transition, for many critics, from a ‘structuralist’ approach through the 1970s and 1980s, in which ecology maintains a key position in the discipline, to a 'poststructuralist' approach with an emphasis on the 'politics' in political ecology.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, 2005, p.74-75.&lt;/ref&gt; This turn has raised questions as to the differentiation with environmental politics as well as the field's use of the term of 'ecology'. Political ecological research has shifted from investigating political influence on the [[earth's surface]] to the focus on spatial-ecological influences on politics and power—a scope reminiscent of [[environmental politics]].

Much has been drawn from cultural ecology, a form of analysis that showed how culture depends upon, and is influenced by, the material conditions of society (political ecology has largely eclipsed cultural ecology as a form of analysis according to Walker.)&lt;ref&gt;Walker, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; As Walker states, &quot;whereas cultural ecology and systems theory emphasize[s] adaptation and homeostasis, political ecology emphasize[s] the role of political economy as a force of maladaptation and instability&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker-2005-74&quot;/&gt;

Political ecologists often use [[political economy]] frameworks to analyze environmental issues. Early and prominent examples of this were ''Silent Violence: Food, Famine and Peasantry in Northern Nigeria'' by [[Michael Watts]] in 1983, which traced the famine in northern Nigeria during the 1970s to the effects of colonialism, rather than an inevitable consequence of the drought in the Sahel, and ''The Political Economy of Soil Erosion in Developing Countries'' by [[Piers Blaikie]] in 1985, which traced [[land degradation]] in Africa to colonial policies of [[Original appropriation|land appropriation]], rather than [[over-exploitation]] by African farmers.

==Relationship to anthropology and geography==

Originating in the 18th and 19th centuries with philosophers such as Adam Smith, Karl Marx, and Thomas Malthus, [[political economy]] attempted to explain the relationships between economic production and political processes.&lt;ref&gt;Ritzer, 2008: 28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry, 2003: 123&quot;&gt;Perry, 2003: 123.&lt;/ref&gt; It tended toward overly structuralist explanations, focusing on the role of individual economic relationships in the maintenance of social order.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, 1997: 7-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Wolf used political economy in a neo-Marxist framework which began addressing the role of local cultures as a part of the world capitalist system, refusing to see those cultures as &quot;primitive isolates&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, 1997: 13.&lt;/ref&gt; But environmental effects on political and economic processes were under-emphasised.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry, 2003: 123&quot;/&gt;

Conversely, [[Julian Steward]] and [[Roy Rappaport]]'s theories of cultural ecology are sometimes credited with shifting the functionalist-oriented anthropology of the 1950s and 1960s and incorporating ecology and environment into ethnographic study.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, 2003: 154-157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geographers and anthropologists worked with the strengths of both to form the basis of political ecology.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watts, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blaikie, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hecht &amp; Cockburn, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peluso, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg &amp; Park, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hershkovitz, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; PE focuses on issues of power, recognizing the importance of explaining environmental impacts on cultural processes without separating out political and economic contexts.

The application of political ecology in the work of anthropologists and geographers differs. While any approach will take both the political/economic and the ecological into account, the emphasis can be unequal. Some, such as geographer Michael Watts, focus on how the assertion of power impacts on access to environmental resources. His approach tends to see environmental harm as both a cause and an effect of “social [[marginalization]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, 2003: 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political ecology has strengths and weaknesses. At its core, it contextualizes political and ecological explanations of human behavior. But as Walker&lt;ref&gt;Walker, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; points out, it has failed to offer “compelling counter-narratives” to “widely influential and popular yet deeply flawed and unapologetic neo-Malthusian rants such as [[Robert D. Kaplan|Robert Kaplan]]'s (1994) 'The coming anarchy' and [[Jared Diamond]]'s (2005) ''Collapse'' (385). Ultimately, applying political ecology to policy decisions – especially in the US and Western Europe – will remain problematic as long as there is a resistance to Marxist and neo-Marxist theory.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, 2006: 388-389.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew P. Vayda|Andrew Vayda]] and Bradley Walters (1999) criticize political ecologists for pre-supposing “the importance ... of certain kinds of political factors in the explanation of environmental changes” (167). Vayda and Walter's response to overly political approaches in political ecology is to encourage what they call “event ecology”,&lt;ref&gt;Vayda &amp; Walters, 1999: 169.&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on human responses to environmental events without presupposing the impact of political processes on environmental events. The critique has not been taken up widely. One example of work that builds on event ecology, in order to add a more explicit focus on the role of power dynamics and the need for including local peoples' voices is Penna-Firme (2013) &quot;Political and Event Ecology: critiques and opportunities for collaboration&quot;.

==Relationship to conservation==

There is a divergence of ideas between conservation science and political ecology. With conservationists establishing [[protected areas]] to conserve [[biodiversity]], &quot;political ecologists have devoted some energy to the study of protected areas, which is unsurprising given political ecology's overall interest in forms of access to, and control over resources&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna, et al., 2004: 203.&lt;/ref&gt; The arguments against enclosure of land for conservation is that it harms local people and their livelihood systems, by denying them access. As Dove and Carpenter state, &quot;indigenous people have important environmental knowledge which could contribute to conservation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dove &amp; Carpenter, 2008: 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The objection by political ecologists is that land use regulations are made by [[NGOs]] and the government, denying access, denying the ability of local people to conserve species and areas themselves, and rendering them more vulnerable through dispossession.

{{Quotation|In a few cases, perhaps especially tragic local groups have been displaced to create national parks and reserves to ‘conserve’ the forest. Fortunately, most conservation bodies are now aware that, if a group has been using and managing a forest for several thousand years, throwing it off the land is more apt to destroy the forest ecosystem than to preserve it. (Sutton 2004: 302)}}

At this time, the standard publication size and space of newspaper comics was sharply reduced; for example, the ''Dick Tracy'' [[Sunday strip]], which had traditionally been a full-page episode containing 12 panels, was cut in size to a half-page format that offered, at most, eight panels—these new restrictions created challenges for all comic artists.

===Plenty family===
The Plenty family was a group of goofy [[Redneck (stereotype)|redneck]] yokels headed by the former villain Bob Oscar (&quot;B.O.&quot;), along with Gertrude (&quot;Gravel Gertie&quot;) Plenty. Gravel Gertie was introduced as the unwitting dupe (accessory) of the villain the Brow, who was on the run from Dick Tracy. The family provided a humorous counterpoint to Tracy's adventures. The Plenty sub-story was decades long, and saw Sparkle Plenty grow from an infant to a young married lady, eventually becoming a beautiful fashion model. Sparkle Plenty's 30 May 1947 birth became a significant mainstream media event, with spinoff merchandising and magazine coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cartoonician.com/big-deals-comics-highest-profile-moments/ |title=&quot;Big Deals: Comics’ Highest-Profile Moments,&quot; ''Hogan's Alley'' #17, 1999 |access-date=January 15, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630083743/http://cartoonician.com/big-deals-comics-highest-profile-moments/ |archive-date=June 30, 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Plenty family appeared with Tracy in a story that occurred in a bank, where &quot;B.O.&quot; found a way to prevent thieves from snatching an envelope of money from a counter.

In the 24 April 2011 strip, B.O. and Gertie had a second child, Attitude,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gocomics.com/dicktracy/2011/04/24 Dick Tracy comic strip] (via GoComics), April 24, 2011. Retrieved October 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; a boy who is as ugly as Sparkle is beautiful. His face has yet to be shown.

===Crimestoppers' Textbook===
Beginning September 11, 1949, the Sunday strip included a frame devoted to a page from the &quot;Crimestoppers' Textbook&quot;, a series of handy illustrated hints for the amateur crime-fighter.&lt;ref name=Holtz&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holtz |first1=Allan |title=American Newspaper Comics: An Encyclopedic Reference Guide |date=2012 |publisher=The University of Michigan Press |location=Ann Arbor |isbn=9780472117567 |page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was named after a short-lived youth group seen in the strip during the late 1940s, led by Junior Tracy, called &quot;Dick Tracy's Crimestoppers.&quot; This feature ended when Gould retired from the strip in 1977, but Max Allan Collins reinstated it, and it is still part of the comic strip. After Gould's retirement, Collins initially replaced the Textbook with &quot;Dick Tracy's Rogues Gallery,&quot; a salute to memorable ''Tracy'' villains of the past.

===Later years===
Chester Gould retired from comics in 1977; his last ''Dick Tracy'' strip appeared in print on Sunday, December 25 (Christmas Day) of that same year. The following Monday, ''Dick Tracy'' was taken over by [[Max Allan Collins]] and longtime Gould assistant [[Rick Fletcher]]. Gould's name remained in the byline for a few years after his retirement as a story consultant.

In one of Collins' first stories as the strip's writer, the gangster known as [[Alphonse &quot;Big Boy&quot; Caprice|&quot;Big Boy&quot;]] learned that he was dying and had less than a year to live. Big Boy was still seeking revenge on the plainclothesman who sent him up the river, and he wanted to live just long enough to see Tracy's death. He put out an open contract on Tracy's head worth one million dollars, knowing that every small-time hood in the City would take a crack at the famous cop for that amount of money. One of the would-be collectors rigged Tracy's car to explode, but inadvertently killed Moon Maid instead of Tracy in the explosion. A funeral strip for Moon Maid explicitly stated that this officially severed all ties between Earth and the Moon in the strip,&lt;ref&gt;''Dick Tracy'', 13 August 1978. Strip reprinted in ''Dick Tracy – The Official Biography'' by Jay Maeder, 1990 (color plate #12).&lt;/ref&gt; thus eliminating the last remnants of the Space Period. Honeymoon received a new hairstyle that covered her antennae, and she was ultimately phased out of the strip. Junior later married Sparkle Plenty (the daughter of B.O. and Gravel Gertie Plenty), and had a daughter named Sparkle Plenty Jr. Sparkle had been divorced by her cartoonist husband Vera Aldid ,who was thus also removed from the cast. Collins felt that their original marriages were a mistake on Gould's part. In the 1990s, Tracy's son Joseph Flintheart Tracy took on a role similar to Junior's in the earlier strips.

In addition, Collins removed other Gould creations of the 1960s and 1970s (including Groovy Grove, who was gravely wounded in the line of duty and later died in the hospital; Lizz married him before his death). On a more philosophical level, Collins took a generally less cynical view of the [[justice system]] than Gould; Tracy came to accept its limitations and requirements as a normal part of the process which he could manage. Extreme technology was phased out, such as the Space Coupe, in favor of more realistic advanced tools such as the 2-Way Wrist Computer in 1987.

New semi-regular characters introduced by Collins and Fletcher included: Dr. Will Carver, a [[plastic surgery|plastic surgeon]] with underworld ties who often worked on known felons; Wendy Wichel, a smarmy newspaper reporter/editorialist with a strong anti-Tracy bias in her articles; and Lee Ebony, an African-American female detective. Vitamin Flintheart reappeared occasionally as a comic-relief figure, the aged ham actor created by Gould in 1944 who had not been seen in the strip for almost three decades. The Plenty family (B.O., Gravel Gertie, and Sparkle) were also brought back as semi-regulars; Junior and Sparkle were married following the death of Moon Maid, and soon gave birth to their own daughter Sparkle Plenty, Jr.

Original villains seen during this period included Angeltop (the revenge-seeking, [[psychopathic]] daughter of the slain Flattop), Torcher (whose scheme was arson-for-profit), and Splitscreen (a video pirate). Collins brought back at least one &quot;classic&quot; Gould villain or revenge-seeking family member per year. The revived Gould villains were often provided with full names, and marriages, children, and other family connections were developed, bringing more humanity to many of the originally grotesque brutes. &quot;Flattop&quot;, particularly, had a number of relatives, all with his characteristic head structure and facial attributes, who turned up one by one to avenge their ancestor on Tracy.

Rick Fletcher died in 1983 and was succeeded by editorial cartoonist [[Dick Locher]], who had assisted Gould on the strip in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Locher was assisted by his son John, who died in 1986.

Max Allan Collins was fired from the strip in 1992, following a financial reorganization of their comic strip holdings, and ''Tribune'' staff writer and columnist [[Mike Kilian]] took over the writing. Kilian was paid less than half of what Collins was making per strip {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, but continued until his death on October 27, 2005. Locher was both author and artist for over three years, beginning on January 9, 2006. On March 16, 2009, [[Jim Brozman]] began collaborating with Locher, taking over the drawing duties while Locher continued to write the strip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailycartoonist.com/index.php/2009/03/17/jim-brozman-working-with-locher-on-dick-tracy/ Jim Brozman working with Locher on Dick Tracy The Daily Cartoonist]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Tracy was a guest at Blondie and Dagwood's 75th anniversary party in the comic strip ''[[Blondie (comic strip)|Blondie]]''. Later, Dick Tracy appeared in the comic strip ''[[Gasoline Alley]]''.

On January 19, 2011, [[Tribune Media Services]] announced that Locher was retiring from the strip and handing the reins to artist [[Joe Staton]] and writer [[Mike Curtis (writer)|Mike Curtis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/towerticker/2011/01/dick-locher-passes-tms-dick-tracy-to-new-artist-writer.html Chicago Tribune: Dick Locher passes 'Dick Tracy' to new artist, writer]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025142512/http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/towerticker/2011/01/dick-locher-passes-tms-dick-tracy-to-new-artist-writer.html |date=October 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rosenthal |first=Phil |authorlink=Phil Rosenthal |title=Dick Locher passes TMS' 'Dick Tracy' to new artist, writer |work=Tower Ticker |publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=January 19, 2011 |url=http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/towerticker/2011/01/dick-locher-passes-tms-dick-tracy-to-new-artist-writer.html |accessdate=January 16, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025142512/http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/towerticker/2011/01/dick-locher-passes-tms-dick-tracy-to-new-artist-writer.html |archivedate=October 25, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new creative team has previously worked together on ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Richie Rich (comics)|Richie Rich]]'', and'' [[Casper the Friendly Ghost]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcj.com/blog/dick-locher-hangs-up-his-fedora/ The Comics Journal: Dick Locher Hangs Up His Fedora]&lt;/ref&gt; Their first Dick Tracy strip was published March 14, 2011. Staton and Curtis are assisted by Shelley Pleger, who inks and letters Staton's drawings, along with Shane Fisher, who provides the coloring on the Sunday strips.  Chicago-area police sergeant Jim Doherty provided &quot;Crimestopper&quot; captions for the Sunday strips and acted as the feature's [[technical advisor]].  Doherty also introduced a new feature, &quot;Tracy's Hall of Fame&quot; (which replaces the &quot;Crimestopper&quot; panel approximately once each month), in which a real-life police officer is profiled and honored. Doherty was replaced in 2016 by police lieutenant Walter Reimer, who introduced the &quot;First Responders Roll of Honor&quot;, which honors real-life police officers, firefighters and paramedics who died on duty.

Staton and Curtis reintroduced many of the characters of the forties through the sixties, including a second Mr. Crime and a reformed Mole, while introducing more deformed and grotesque villains such as Abner Kadaver, Panda, and The Jumbler. They have also brought back all the gadgets and plot elements of the 1960s space era, starting in early 2013, although the reintroduced Moon Maid is not the same as the original; rather, she is a human genetically modified to resemble the original Moon Maid and thus, is christened Mysta Chimera and placed under Diet Smith's care.

==In other media==
===Radio===
{{Main|Dick Tracy (radio series)}}

''Dick Tracy'' had a long run on radio, from 1934 weekdays on NBC's New England stations to the ABC network in 1948. Bob Burlen was the first radio Tracy in 1934, and others heard in the role during the 1930s and 1940s were Barry Thomson, [[Ned Wever]] and [[Matt Crowley]]. The early shows all had 15-minute episodes.

On CBS, with Sterling Products as sponsor, the serial aired four times a week from February 4, 1935 to July 11, 1935, moving to Mutual from September 30, 1935 to March 24, 1937 with Bill McClintock doing the sound effects. NBC's weekday afternoon run from January 3, 1938 to April 28, 1939 had sound effects by Keene Crockett and was sponsored by Quaker Oats, which brought ''Dick Tracy'' into primetime (Saturdays at 7&amp;nbsp;pm and, briefly, Mondays at 8&amp;nbsp;pm) with 30-minute episodes from April 29, 1939 to September 30, 1939. The series returned to 15-minute episodes on the ABC Blue Network from March 15, 1943 to July 16, 1948, sponsored by [[Tootsie Roll]], which used the music theme of &quot;Toot Toot, Tootsie&quot; for its 30-minute Saturday ABC series from October 6, 1945 to June 1, 1946. Sound effects on ABC were supplied by Walt McDonough and Al Finelli.

On February 15, 1945, ''[[Command Performance (radio series)|Command Performance]]'' broadcast the musical comedy ''[[Dick Tracy in B-Flat]]'' with [[Bing Crosby]] as Tracy, [[Bob Hope]] as Flattop, [[Dinah Shore]] as Tess Trueheart, among the cast. Dick Tracy's wedding is repeatedly interrupted as Tracy chases after one villain after another. In the strip, his marriage wasn't until 1950 and his honeymoon was disrupted by his going after [[List of Dick Tracy villains#1940s|Wormy]].

===Recordings===
[[Jim Ameche]] portrayed Tracy in a two-record set recorded by [[Mercury Records]] in 1947. The record sleeves were illustrated with [[Sunday strip]]s reprinted in black-and-white for children to color.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dgwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT16&amp;dq=martin+block&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=skXzTMPxKc-mnQel_cD0Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=martin%20block&amp;f=false ''Billboard'', July 26, 1947.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comic books===
[[File:Gould1947.jpg|upright|thumb|Chester Gould's cover for 1947 Quaker [[Puffed Wheat]] giveaway comic book reprinting early 1940s ''Dick Tracy'' strips.]]
Tracy made his first comic book appearance in 1936 as one of the features included in the first issue of [[Dell Comics|Dell's]] ''Popular Comics''. These were reprints from the newspaper strip, reconfigured to fit the pages of a comic book, as was the case with most Tracy comic book appearances. Tracy remained a regular feature in ''Popular Comics'' through the publication's 21st issue.

The first comic book to feature Tracy exclusively was the ''Dick Tracy Feature Book'', published in May 1937 by [[David McKay Publications]]. McKay's Feature Books were magazines that rotated several popular characters from comics strips through 1938. Three more of McKay's Feature Books starred Tracy in the following months.

In 1939, Dell started a comic magazine series called &quot;Black and White Comics,&quot; essentially identical to McKay's &quot;Feature Books.&quot; Six of the 15 issues featured Tracy. In 1941, Dell's &quot;Black and White&quot; series was replaced by the &quot;Large Feature Books,&quot; the third issue of which featured Tracy. As with the McKay series, the Dell &quot;Black and White&quot; and &quot;Large Feature&quot; series were abridged reprints of the strip.

In 1938, ''Tracy'' became one of several regular newspaper strips featured in Dell's regular monthly ''Super Comics'', remaining a regular part of that publication until 1948. In 1939, ''Tracy'' was the sole feature in the very first issue of Dell's ''[[Four Color|Four-Color Comics]]'', which put out more than 1,300 issues starring hundreds of characters between 1939 and 1962. Tracy was featured in seven more ''Four-Color'' issues throughout the 1940s.

Tracy was frequently featured in comic books used as promotional items by various companies. In 1947, for example, Sig Feuchtwanger produced a comic book that was a giveaway prize in boxes of [[Quaker Oats Company|Quaker]] Puffed Wheat cereal, sponsor of the popular ''Dick Tracy'' radio series.

In January 1948, Dell began the first regular ''Dick Tracy'' comic book series, ''Dick Tracy Monthly''. This series ultimately ran for 145 issues, the first 24 of which were published by Dell, after which it was picked up by [[Harvey Comics]]. Continuing the same numbering, Harvey published the series until 1961. As with most previous Tracy comic book incarnations, these were, with the exception of the last few Dell issues which featured original material, slightly abridged and reconfigured reprints of the newspaper strips.

''Dick Tracy'' was revived in 1986 by [[Blackthorne Publishing]] which began as a monthly series (also called ''Dick Tracy Monthly'') but became a weekly one (''Dick Tracy Weekly'') with issue 25 and lasted 99 issues. [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] produced a series of three issues as a tie-in for their 1990 film. This miniseries, ''True Hearts and Tommy Guns'', was drawn by [[Kyle Baker]] and edited by [[Len Wein]]. The third issue was a direct adaptation of the film.

In 2018, [[IDW Publishing]] announced a new ''Dick Tracy'' comic book by [[Mike Allred]] (co-writer/cover artist/inker), Lee Allred (co-writer), Rich Tommaso (penciller) and [[Laura Allred]] (colorist).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbr.com/dick-tracy-mike-allred-idw-comic-book/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books===
Over the years, many reprints of ''Dick Tracy'' newspaper strips have been published. Beginning in 2006, [[IDW Publishing]] started the series ''[[The Complete Chester Gould's Dick Tracy]]'', reprinting the complete strip in hardcover volumes, eventually being done under their [[The Library of American Comics]] imprint.

===Film===
====Film serials====
Dick Tracy made his film debut in ''[[Dick Tracy (serial)|Dick Tracy]]'' (1937), a 15-chapter [[serial (film)|movie serial]] by [[Republic Pictures]] starring [[Ralph Byrd]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DTM-20150218&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Dick Tracy Museum - February 18, 2015 |url=http://www.dicktracymuseum.com/headquarters/at-the-movies/ |date=February 18, 2015 |work=[[Old McHenry County Courthouse#Chester Gould-Dick Tracy Museum|Chester Gould Dick Tracy Museum]] |accessdate=February 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218203242/http://www.dicktracymuseum.com/headquarters/at-the-movies/ |archive-date=February 18, 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spider Gang was on the loose, tired of Dick Tracy's cunning skills. Through the 15-chapter serial, 15 different cases were solved, all plots by the Spider Gang. Dick Tracy was also in search of his missing brother, Gordon Tracy ([[Carleton Young]]). The Dick Tracy character proved very popular, and a second serial, ''[[Dick Tracy Returns]]'', appeared in 1938 (reissued in 1948). ''[[Dick Tracy's G-Men]]'' was released in 1939 (reissued in 1955). The last was ''[[Dick Tracy vs. Crime Inc.]]'' in 1941 (reissued as ''Dick Tracy vs. the Phantom Empire'' in 1952).

The sequels were produced under an interpretation of the contract for the first ''Dick Tracy'' serial, which gave license for &quot;a series or serial&quot;. As a result, Chester Gould received no further money for the sequel serials.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In these serials, Dick Tracy is portrayed as an [[FBI]] agent, or &quot;[[G-Man (slang)|G-Man]]&quot;, based in California rather than as a detective in the police force of a [[Midwestern]] city resembling Chicago, and, aside from himself and Junior, no characters from the strip appear in any of the four films.

However, comic relief sidekick &quot;Mike McGurk&quot; bears some resemblance to Tracy's partner from the strip, Pat Patton; Tracy's secretary, Gwen Andrews (played by several actresses in the course of the series, including [[Jennifer Jones (actor)|Jennifer Jones]] under a variation of her real name, Phyllis Isley), provides the same kind of feminine interest as Tess Trueheart; and FBI Director Clive Anderson ([[Francis X. Bushman]] and others) is the same kind of avuncular superior as Chief Brandon.

The first serial, ''Dick Tracy'', is now in the [[public domain]].

====Early feature films====
Six years after the release of the final Republic serial, Dick Tracy headlined four feature films, produced by [[RKO Radio Pictures]]. ''[[Dick Tracy (1945 film)|Dick Tracy]]'' (a.k.a. ''Dick Tracy, Detective'') (1945) was followed by ''[[Dick Tracy vs. Cueball]]'' in 1946, both with [[Morgan Conway]] as Tracy. Ralph Byrd returned for the last two features, both released in 1947: ''[[Dick Tracy's Dilemma]]'' and ''[[Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome]]''. ''Gruesome'' is probably the best known of the four, with the villain portrayed by [[Boris Karloff]]. All four movies had many of the visual features associated with [[film noir]]: dramatic, shadowy photographic compositions, with many exterior scenes filmed at night (at the RKO Encino [[movie ranch]]). Lyle Latell co-starred in all four films as Pat Patton. [[Anne Jeffreys]] played Tess Trueheart in the first two, succeeded by Kay Christopher and finally [[Anne Gwynne]]; [[Ian Keith]] joined the cast as the actor Vitamin Flintheart for two films; Joseph Crehan played Chief Brandon. RKO stocked the films with familiar faces, creating a veritable rogues' gallery of characters: [[Mike Mazurki]] as Splitface, [[Dick Wessel]] as Cueball, [[Esther Howard]] as Filthy Flora, [[Jack Lambert (American actor)|Jack Lambert]] as hook-handed villain The Claw; baldheaded, pop-eyed Milton Parsons, mild-mannered [[Byron Foulger]], dangerous [[Trevor Bardette]] and pockmarked, gently sinister [[Skelton Knaggs]].

====1990 film====
{{Main|Dick Tracy (1990 film)}}
In 1990, [[Warren Beatty]] directed and starred as the title character in a live action [[ensemble cast|all-star-cast]] film along with [[Al Pacino]], [[Dustin Hoffman]], and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].

[[Ralph Byrd]], who had played the square-jawed sleuth in all four Republic movie serials, and in two of the RKO feature-length films, reprised his role in a short-lived live-action ''[[Dick Tracy (TV series)|Dick Tracy]]'' series that ran on ABC from 1950 to 1951. Additional episodes intended for first-run [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] continued to be produced into 1952. Produced by P. K. Palmer, who also wrote many of the scripts, the series often featured Gould-created villains such as [[Flattop Jones|Flattop]], Shaky, the Mole, Breathless Mahoney, Heels Beals, and Influence, all of whom appeared on film for the first time on this series. Other cast members included Joe Devlin as Sam Catchem, Angela Greene as Tess Tracy (née Trueheart), Martin Dean as Junior, and [[Pierre Watkin]] as Chief Patton. Criticized for its violence, the series remained popular. It ended, not in response to criticism, but because of Byrd's unexpected, premature death in 1952. The series was filmed on a low budget, with many long hours and a rushed shooting schedule. Many episodes of this series have been released on various public domain TV detective DVD sets.

====Animated cartoons====

The first cartoon series was produced from 1960 to 1961 by [[United Productions of America|UPA]]. Tracy employed a series of cartoon-like subordinate flatfoots to fight crime each week, contacting them on his two-way wrist radio. [[Everett Sloane]] voiced Tracy and supporting characters and villains were voiced by Jerry Hausner, [[Mel Blanc]], [[Benny Rubin]], Johnny Coons, [[Paul Frees]] and others. These subordinates included &quot;Go-Go&quot; Gomez, [[Joe Jitsu (Dick Tracy)|Joe Jitsu]], Hemlock Holmes and the Retouchables, and Officer Heap O'Calorie. 130 five-minute cartoons were designed and packaged for syndication, usually intended for local children's shows.

UPA was also the production company behind the [[Mr. Magoo]] cartoons, so it was possible for them to arrange a meeting between Tracy and Magoo in a 1965 episode of the season-long TV series ''[[The Famous Adventures of Mr. Magoo]]''. In the episode ''Dick Tracy and the Mob'', Tracy persuades Magoo (a well-known actor in the context of the ''Famous Adventures'' series) to impersonate an international hit man named Squinty Eyes, who he resembles, and infiltrate a gang of criminals made up of Flattop, Pruneface, Itchy, Mumbles and others. Unlike the earlier animated Tracy shorts, this longer episode was played relatively straight, with Tracy getting much more screen time. Pitting Tracy against a coalition of several of his foes was adopted more than two decades later in the [[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|1990 film]].

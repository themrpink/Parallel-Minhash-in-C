In 1912 Tianjin had 17 Chinese-language newspapers and 5 daily newspapers in other languages; none of the newspapers in the Tianjin district were trade papers.

===Censorship capital===
More and more, China's leading Internet information providers (usually located in Beijing), including social network [[Sina Weibo]], [[Douban]] and the online video website [[Sohu]], tend to relocate their censorship departments to Tianjin, where labor costs are cheaper than Beijing, as censorship is a kind of [[labor-intensive]] work. In fact, Tianjin has become the censorship capital of Chinese Internet.&lt;ref name=ChinaManhattan2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=At Sina Weibo's censorship hub, China's Little Brothers cleanse online chatter|journal=Reuters|date=September 11, 2013|url=http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUKBRE98A18Z20130911?irpc=932|accessdate=January 29, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204065454/http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUKBRE98A18Z20130911?irpc=932|archive-date=February 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism==
[[File:天津名流茶馆的相声表演.jpg|thumb|Crosstalk in Tianjin]]
The city has many sights; its streetscapes – an assemblage of historic nineteenth – and early twentieth-century [[European architecture]], juxtaposed with the concrete and glass monoliths of contemporary China – are its most engrossing attraction. Though wide swaths of the city are being redeveloped, much of the [[colonial architecture]] has been placed under protection, and the shopping opportunities, especially for antiques, just about justify a day-trip from the capital, an hour away by train.

In the nineteenth century, the port city caught the attention of the seafaring Western powers, who used the boarding of a British ship by Chinese troops as an excuse to declare war. With well-armed gunboats, they were assured of victory, and the [[Treaty of Tianjin]], signed in 1856, gave the Europeans the right to establish nine [[Concessions in Tianjin|concessionary bases]] on the mainland, from which they could conduct trade and sell opium. These concessions, along the banks of the [[Hai River]], were self-contained European fantasy worlds: the French built elegant [[château]]x and towers, while the Germans constructed red-tiled Bavarian villas. Tensions between the indigenous population and the foreigners exploded in the [[Tianjin massacre|Tianjin Incident]] of 1870, when a Chinese mob attacked a French-run orphanage, and again during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in 1900, after which the foreigners leveled the walls surrounding the old Chinese city to enable them to keep an eye on its residents.

The dense network of ex-concession streets south and west of the central train station, and south of the Hai River, now constitute the areas of most interest to visitors. Unmistakably remarkable are the châteaux of the French concession, which now make up the downtown district just south of the river, as well as the imposing mansions the British built east of here. Farther east, also south of the river, the architecture of an otherwise unremarkable district has a sprinkling of austere German construction.

People from Tianjin speak the [[Tianjin dialect]] of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], from which it is derived. Despite its proximity to Beijing, the Tianjin dialect sounds quite different from the [[Beijing dialect]], which provides the basis for [[Putonghua]] or Standard Chinese.

Tianjin is a respected home base of [[Beijing opera]], one of the most prestigious forms of [[Chinese opera]].

Tianjin is famous for its stand-up comedy and comedians including [[Guo Degang]] and [[Ma Sanli]]. [[Ma Sanli]] (1914–2003), an ethnic [[Hui people|Hui]] and longtime resident of Tianjin, is renowned for his ''[[xiangsheng]]'', a hugely popular form of Chinese entertainment akin to comedy. Ma Sanli delivered some of his ''xiangsheng'' in the [[Tianjin dialect]]. Tianjin, along with Beijing, is a center for the art of ''xiangsheng''. Tianjin's style of stand-up also includes the use of rhythmic bamboo clappers, ''kuaiban''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McDougall|first=Bonnie S.|title=Popular Chinese literature and performing arts in the People's Republic of China, 1949–1979|year=1984|publisher=University of California Press|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were over 900 bus lines in the city {{As of|2005|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tjbus.com/frontpage/index.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 25, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304141924/https://www.tjbus.com/frontpage/index.aspx |archivedate=March 4, 2010  }} Tianjin Bus Company official website. {{in lang|zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roads and expressways===
Some roads and bridges have retained names that hark back to the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] era (1912–1949) such as [[Three Principles of the People|Minquan]] Gate and [[Beiyang]] Road. Like with most cities in China, many roads in Tianjin are named after Chinese provinces and cities. Also, Tianjin is unlike Beijing, in that very few roads run parallel to the major four [[cardinal direction]]s.

Tianjin has three ring roads. The Inner and Middle Ring Roads are not closed, traffic-controlled roadways and some often have traffic light intersections. The Outer Ring Road is the closest thing to a highway-level ring road, although traffic is often chaotic.
* [[Inner Ring Road (Tianjin)|Inner Ring Road ''(neihuan)'']]
* [[Middle Ring Road (Tianjin)|Middle Ring Road ''(zhonghuan)'']]
* [[Outer Ring Road (Tianjin)|Outer Ring Road ''(waihuan)'']]

Tianjin's roads often finish in ''dao'' ({{zh|s=道|l=avenue|links=no}}), ''xian'' ({{zh|s=线|t=線|l=line|links=no}}). These are most often used for highways and through routes. The terms ''lu'' ({{zh|s=路|l=road|links=no}}). ''Jie'' ({{zh|s=街|l=street|links=no}}) are rare. As Tianjin's roads are rarely in a cardinal compass direction, ''jing'' ({{zh|s=经|t=經|l=avenue|links=no}}) roads and ''wei'' ({{zh|s=纬|t=緯|l=avenue|links=no}}) roads often appear, which attempt to run more directly north–south and east–west, respectively.

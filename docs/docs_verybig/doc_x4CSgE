{{quote|I find the construction and the interrelation of the languages an aesthetic pleasure in itself, quite apart from ''The Lord of the Rings'', of which it was/is in fact independent.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; group=T&gt;Tolkien wrote in a letter to a reader, published in [[Parma Eldalamberon]] 17, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the early 30s Tolkien decided that the proto-language of the Elves was [[Valarin]], the tongue of the gods or Valar: &quot;The language of the Elves derived in the beginning from the Valar, but they change it even in the learning, and moreover modified and enriched it constantly at all times by their own invention.&quot;&lt;ref group=T&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien, &quot;Lambion Ontale: Descent of Tongues&quot;, Tengwesta Qenderinwa 1, Parma Eldalamberon 18, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Comparative Tables''&lt;ref group=T&gt;[[Parma Eldalamberon]], 19, pp. 18–28&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien describes the mechanisms of sound change in the following daughter languages: ''Qenya, Lindarin'' (a dialect of Qenya), ''Telerin, Old Noldorin'' (or ''Fëanorian''), ''Noldorin'' (or ''Gondolinian''), ''Ilkorin'' (esp. of [[Doriath]]), ''Danian of Ossiriand, East Danian, [[Taliska]], West Lemberin, North Lemberin, and East Lemberin''.

In his lifetime J.R.R. Tolkien never ceased to experiment on his constructed languages, and they were subjected to many revisions. They had many grammars with substantial differences between different stages of development. After the publication of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1954–1955), the grammar rules of his major Elvish languages Quenya, Telerin and Sindarin went through very few changes (this is '''late Elvish''' 1954–1973).

=== Publication of Tolkien's linguistic papers ===

Two magazines (''[[Vinyar Tengwar]]'', from its issue 39 in July 1998, and ''[[Parma Eldalamberon]]'', from its issue 11 in 1995) are exclusively devoted to the editing and publishing of J.R.R. Tolkien's gigantic mass of previously unpublished linguistic papers (including those not published by Christopher Tolkien in &quot;[[The History of Middle-earth]]&quot;). Almost each year, new Elvish words are published and further grammar rules of the Elvish languages are disclosed. Access to the unpublished documents is severely limited, and the editors have yet not published a comprehensive catalogue of the documents they are working on.

==Internal history==
[[File:Elvish languages.svg|thumb|center|900px|Internal history of the Elvish languages.]]

The Elvish languages are a [[language family|family]] of several related languages and dialects. Here is set briefly the story of the Elvish languages as conceived by Tolkien around 1965. They all originated from:

*'''[[Primitive Quendian]]''', also called '''Quenderin''', the proto-language of all the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]], who awoke together in the far east of Middle-earth, [[Cuiviénen]], and began &quot;naturally&quot; to make a language.

: All the Elvish languages are presumed to be descendants of this common ancestor.

Tolkien invented two subfamilies (subgroups) of the Elvish languages. &quot;The language of the Quendelie (Elves) was thus very early sundered into the branches Eldarin and Avarin&quot;.&lt;ref group=T&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien, &quot;Tengwesta Qenderinwa&quot;, ''Parma Eldalamberon'' 18, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Avari (Middle-earth)|Avari]]n''' is the language of various Elves of the Second and Third Clans, who refused to come to [[Valinor]].
**Avarin developed into at least six '''Avarin languages'''.
*'''[[Common Eldarin]]''' is the language of the three clans of the [[Eldar (Middle-earth)|Eldar]] during the Great March to Valinor.  It developed into:
**'''[[Quenya]]''', the language of the Elves in [[Eldamar]] beyond the Sea; it divided into:
***'''Vanyarin Quenya''' (also '''Quendya'''), colloquial speech of the [[Vanyar]], the Elves of the First Clan;
***'''Noldorin Quenya''' (and later '''Exilic Quenya'''), colloquial speech of the [[Noldor]], the Elves of the Second Clan.
**'''[[Common Telerin]]''', the early language of all the [[Teleri]]
***'''Telerin''', the language of the [[Teleri]], Elves of the Third Clan, living in [[Tol Eressëa]] and [[Alqualondë]].
***'''[[Nandorin]]''', the language of the [[Nandor (Middle-earth)|Nandor]], a branch of the Third Clan.
****Nandorin developed into various Nandorin and [[Silvan Elves|Silvan]] languages.
***'''[[Sindarin]]''' is the language of the [[Sindar]], a branch of the Third Clan, who dwelt in [[Beleriand]].  Its dialects include:
****'''[[Doriathrin]]''', in [[Doriath]];
****'''[[Falathrin]]''', in the [[Falas]] of Beleriand;
****'''[[North Sindarin]]''', in Dorthonion and [[Hithlum]];
****'''[[Sindarin#Noldorin Sindarin|Noldorin Sindarin]]''', spoken by the Exiled Noldor.

The [[acute accent]] (á, é, í, ó, ú) or [[circumflex]] accent (â, ê, î, ô, û, ŷ) marks long vowels in the Elvish languages. When writing Common Eldarin forms, Tolkien often used the [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] to indicate long vowels. The [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] (ä, ë, ö) is normally used to show that a short vowel is to be separately pronounced, that it is not silent or part of a [[diphthong]]. For example, the last four letters of ''[[Ainulindalë]]'' represent two syllables, rather than the English word ''dale'', and the first three letters of ''[[Eärendil]]'' represent two syllables rather than the English word ''ear''.

===Internal development of the Elvish word for &quot;Elves&quot;===

Below is a family tree of the Elvish languages, showing how the Primitive Quendian word ''kwendī'' &quot;people&quot; (later meaning &quot;Elves&quot;) was altered in the descendant languages.&lt;ref group=T&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien, &quot;Quendi and Eldar&quot;, ''[[The War of the Jewels]]'', pp. 372–377&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fictional philology===
There is a tradition of philological study of Elvish languages within the fiction. Elven philologists are referred to by the Quenya term ''Lambengolmor''. In Quenya, ''lambe'' means spoken language or verbal communication.

{{quote|The older stages of Quenya were, and doubtless still are, known to the loremasters of the Eldar. It appears from these notices that besides certain ancient songs and compilations of lore that were orally preserved, there existed also some books and many ancient inscriptions.&lt;ref group=T&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien, &quot;Outline of Phonology&quot;, ''Parma Eldalamberon'' 19, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Known members of the Lambengolmor were Rúmil, who invented the first Elvish script (the [[Sarati]]), [[Fëanor]] who later enhanced and further developed this script into his [[Tengwar]], which later was spread to Middle-earth by the Exiled [[Noldor]] and remained in use ever after, and Pengolodh, who is credited with many works, including the ''[[Osanwe-kenta]]'' and the ''[[Lhammas]]'' or &quot;The 'Account of Tongues' which Pengolodh of Gondolin wrote in later days in Tol-eressëa&quot;.&lt;ref group=T&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien, &quot;The Lhammas&quot;, ''The Lost Road'', p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

Independently of the Lambengolmor, Daeron of [[Doriath]] invented the [[Cirth]] or Elvish-runes. These were mostly used for inscriptions, and later were replaced by the Tengwar, except among the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]].

==Pronunciation of Quenya and Sindarin ==

'''Consonants''' (differing from English)
* The letter ''c'' always denotes {{IPA|[k]}}, even before ''i'' and ''e''; for instance, ''[[Celeborn]]'' is pronounced ''Keleborn'', and [[Cirth]] is pronounced ''Kirth''; thus, it never denotes the soft ''c'' {{IPA|[*s]}} in ''cent''.
* The letter ''g'' always denotes the hard {{IPA|[ɡ]}}, as in ''give'', rather than the soft form {{IPA|[*d͡ʒ]}}, as in ''gem''.
* The letter ''r'' denotes an [[alveolar trill]] {{IPA|[r]}}, similar to Spanish ''rr''.
* The [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''dh'', as in ''[[Caradhras]]'', denotes {{IPA|[ð]}} as in English ''th''is.
* The digraph ''ch'', as in ''Orch'', denotes {{IPA|[χ]}} as in Welsh ''bach'', and never like the ''ch'' {{IPA|[*t͡ʃ]}} in English ''chair''.
* The digraph ''lh'' denotes {{IPA|[ɬ]}} as in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''ll''.

==Elvish scripts==
Most samples of the Elvish language done by Tolkien were written out with the Latin alphabet, but within the fiction Tolkien imagined many writing systems for his Elves. The best-known are the &quot;[[tengwar]] of Fëanor&quot;, but the first system he created, c. 1919, is the &quot;tengwar of Rúmil&quot;, also called the [[sarati]].

=== Elvish scripts devised by Tolkien ===

In chronological order:
# Tengwar of Rúmil or [[Sarati]]
# [[Cirth#Gondolinic Runes|Gondolinic Runes]] (Runes used in the city of [[Gondolin]])
# Valmaric script
# Andyoqenya
# Qenyatic
# [[Tengwar]] of Fëanor
# The [[Cirth]] of Daeron

=== Internal history of the scripts===

Prior to their exile, the Elves of the Second Clan (the Noldor) used first the [[sarati]] of Rúmil to record their tongue, Quenya. In Middle-earth, Sindarin was first recorded using the &quot;Elvish runes&quot; or [[cirth]], named later ''certar'' in Quenya. A runic inscription in Quenya was engraved on the sword of [[Aragorn]] (II), [[Andúril]]. The swords inscriptions were not revealed in the movie trilogy, nor in the book.

It is one of Italy's main [[law enforcement]] agencies, alongside the [[Polizia di Stato]] and the [[Guardia di Finanza]]. As with the Guardia di Finanza but in contrast to the Polizia di Stato, the Carabinieri are a military force. As the fourth branch of the [[Italian Armed Forces]], they come under the authority of the [[Ministry of Defence (Italy)|Ministry of Defence]]; for activities related to inland public order and security, they functionally depend on the [[Ministry of the Interior (Italy)|Ministry of the Interior]]. In practice, there is a significant overlap between the jurisdiction of the Polizia di Stato and Carabinieri, who are contacted on separate emergency telephone numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28254297|work=BBC News|title=It's 200 years old, but what is Italy's carabinieri?|date=13 July 2014|accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Polizia di Stato, the Carabinieri have responsibility for policing the military, and a number of members regularly participate in military missions abroad.

They were originally founded as the police force of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], the forerunner of the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. During the process of [[Italian unification]], the Carabinieri were appointed as the &quot;First Force&quot; of the new national military organisation. Although the Carabinieri assisted in the suppression of opposition during the rule of [[Benito Mussolini]], they were also responsible for his downfall and many units were disbanded during [[World War II]] by [[Nazi Germany]], which resulted in large numbers of Carabinieri joining the [[Italian resistance movement]].

In 2001, they were separated from the Army to become a separate branch of the [[Italian Armed Forces]]. Carabinieri have policing powers that can be exercised at any time and in any part of the country, and they are always permitted to carry their assigned weapon as personal equipment ([[Beretta 92]]FS pistols).

The Carabinieri are often referred to as &quot;La Benemerita&quot; (The Reputable or The Meritorious) as they are a trusted and prestigious law enforcement institution in Italy. The first official account of the use of this term to refer to the Carabinieri dates back to June 24, 1864.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.carabinieri.it/arma/curiosita/non-tutti-sanno-che/b/benemerita|title=Benemerita|website=www.carabinieri.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Inspired by the French [[Gendarmerie]], the corps was created by King [[Victor Emmanuel I of Savoy]] with the aim of providing the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] with a police corps. Previously, police duties were managed by the ''Dragoni di Sardegna Corps,'' created in 1726 and composed of volunteers. After French soldiers had occupied [[Turin]] at the end of the 18th century and later abandoned it to the [[Kingdom of Piedmont]], the Royal Carabinieri Corps was instituted under the Royal Patents of 13 July 1814.&lt;ref name=cab /&gt;

The name derives from the French word ''carabinier'', meaning &quot;[[soldier]] armed with a [[carbine]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Origin and meaning of carabinieri| website=Online Etymology Dictionary | url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/carabinieri | access-date=2019-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new force was divided into divisions on the scale of one division for each province. The divisions were further divided into companies and subdivided into lieutenancies, which commanded and coordinated the local police stations and were distributed throughout the national territory in direct contact with the public.&lt;ref name=cab /&gt;

In 1868, the ''[[Corazzieri]]'' (mounted division) was formed – initially as an escort of honour for the sovereign, and since 1946 for the President of the Republic.&lt;ref name=cab /&gt; The Italian unification saw the number of divisions increased,&lt;ref name=cab /&gt; and on 24 January 1861 the ''Carabinieri'' were appointed the &quot;First Force&quot; of the new national military organization.&lt;ref name=cab /&gt;

In May 1915 Italian troops marched to encompass [[South Tyrol]], territory of their former allies the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]], in the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Fronte italiano]] campaign. The defenders had sufficient time to prepare strong fortifications there, and in the [[Carso]] [[Theater (warfare)|theatre]] to the east, and the Italian regiments, under overall command of [[Luigi Cadorna|General Cadorna]], found themselves repeatedly repulsed in harsh fighting. The role of the Carabinieri was to act as [[barrier troops]], setting up machine gun posts to control the rear of the attacking regiments and prevent desertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Mark|title=The White War|year=2009|publisher=Faber|location=London|isbn=978-0-571-22334-3|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1930s and 1940s ===
During the [[Italian Fascism|fascist]] regime of [[Benito Mussolini]] (1922–1943), the Carabinieri were one of the police forces entrusted with suppressing opposition in Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;collab&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yZQlNLN3YXQC&amp;pg=PA274 |title=The Oxford illustrated history of Italy – Google Books |accessdate=2009-09-19|isbn=978-0-19-820527-2|year=1997|last1=Holmes |first1=George |last2=Holmes |first2=Chichele|page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period, while part of the [[Italian African Police]] (mainly in the late 1930s), they were involved in atrocities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Massacres and Atrocities of WWII in the Axis Countries | website=members.iinet.net.au | url=http://members.iinet.net.au/~gduncan/massacres_axis.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194232/http://members.iinet.net.au/~gduncan/massacres_axis.html | archive-date=2016-03-03 | url-status=live | access-date=2019-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dacb.org/stories/ethiopia/petros2_abuna.html |title=Pétros, Ethiopia, Orthodox |publisher=Dacb.org |date= |accessdate=2009-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228190751/http://www.dacb.org/stories/ethiopia/petros2_abuna.html |archive-date=2010-12-28 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adejumobi|first=Saheed A.|title=The History of Ethiopia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-U7aydmefrgC&amp;pg=PA78| year=2007| publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group| isbn=978-0-313-32273-0|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mockler|first=Anthony|title=Haile Selassie's War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vCb_nQEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA175|year=2003|publisher=Signal Books|isbn=978-1-902669-53-3|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linkethiopia.org/guide/pankhurst/ethiopian_patriots/ethiopian_patriots_4.html |title=The Pankhurst History Library |publisher=[[Link Ethiopia]] |accessdate=2009-09-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706001537/http://www.linkethiopia.org/guide/pankhurst/ethiopian_patriots/ethiopian_patriots_4.html |archivedate=2010-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in colonial [[Italian East Africa]] during the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]]. During [[World War II]] they fought in their function as military police against the Allied forces, and against [[Yugoslav partisans]] as part of the Italian occupation force in [[Yugoslavia]].

After [[Fall of the Fascist regime in Italy|Mussolini was voted out of office]] on 25 July 1943, on the orders of the king he was arrested by the Carabinieri as he left the [[Villa Ada|king's private residence]] in Rome and subsequently imprisoned on [[Campo Imperatore]] by Carabinieri forces. After the [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|armistice between Italy and the Allies on 3 September 1943]] and the country's split into the fascist [[Italian Social Republic]] in the north and the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in the south, the Carabinieri split into two groups. In southern Italy the Carabinieri Command for Liberated Italy was founded in Bari, mobilizing new units for the Italian war of liberation. These units were attached to the Italian Liberation Corps and the six Italian Combat Groups of the [[Italian Co-Belligerent Army]], fighting with the Allied forces. In northern Italy the fascist regime organized the [[Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana]] (composed of Carabinieri, former colonial policemen, [[Guardia di Finanza]] and customs police), to employ it as a military police and rapid-deployment anti-guerilla force. GNR was later joined (but not taken over) by the [[Black Brigades]] which represented a new militant incarnation of the Fascist party.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

Due to the role the Carabinieri had played in the downfall of Mussolini, and since one of the few units which fought the German occupation of Rome were the [[Granatieri di Sardegna Mechanized Brigade|Granatieri di Sardegna]] regiments and the II Carabinieri cadet battalion, the Germans did not view the Carabinieri as loyal to the fascist cause, They disarmed the force and began the deportation of 8,000 officers to Germany for [[forced labour]] on 6 October 1943; the Italian Colonial Police took over their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Paehler |first=Katrin |title=The Third Reich's Intelligence Services|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KphUDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA202 |year=2017 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-15719-4 |page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, large numbers of Carabinieri joined the [[Italian resistance movement]] to fight German and Italian fascists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Friesendorf |first=Cornelius|title=How Western Soldiers Fight: Organizational Routines in Multinational Missions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EgpaDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83|year=2018 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-108-42910-8 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, some 45,000 officers remained on the job and as of March 1944, this group was the only national security force in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Battistelli |first1=Pier Paolo|last2=Crociani|first2=Piero|title=World War II Partisan Warfare in Italy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zECXCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14 |year=2015 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-1-4728-0894-3|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war the Carabinieri counted at least 2,735 fallen and 6,500 wounded, out of approximately 14,000 who had joined the Resistance in northern and central Italy. In Yugoslavia the Carabinieri formed a battalion of the Italian partisan [[Garibaldi Division]], which fought alongside the Yugoslav partisans against [[Wehrmacht|German]] and [[Ustaše|Croatian Ustaše Forces]]. The battalion lost over 80% of its members in combat and was awarded the [[Silver Medal of Military Valor]] to commemorate the fallen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Arma/Curiosita/Non+tutti+sanno+che/R/21+R.htm |title=Arma dei Carabinieri – Home – L'Arma – Curiosità – Non tutti sanno che... - R |publisher=Carabinieri.it |date= |accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;milhist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Multilingua/EN/MilitaryOperations/ |title=Arma dei Carabinieri – Home - &gt; – EN – Military Operations |publisher=Carabinieri.it |date= |accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One notable act of heroism in this era came from Vice [[Brigadier#Italy|Brigadiere]] [[Salvo D'Acquisto]], who was executed by the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] in Palidoro (near [[Rome]]) during World War II. D'Acquisto exchanged his life for the lives of citizens due to be executed in retaliation for the killing of a German soldier; instead, he claimed responsibility and was executed for the offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Italy Justice System and National Police Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qnL4EMUhaSEC&amp;pg=PA196|date=22 April 2018|publisher=Int'l Business Publications|isbn=978-1-4387-2542-0|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 March 2000, they were separated to become the fourth branch of the Italian Armed Forces.&lt;ref name=cab /&gt; [[Interpol]] summarizes this force (part of the Ministry of Defence) as having a &quot;nationwide remit for crime investigations. It also serves as the military police for the Italian armed forces and can be called upon for national defence action.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Italy | website=INTERPOL | url=https://www.interpol.int/en/Who-we-are/Member-countries/Europe/ITALY | access-date=2019-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [[Europol]] (the EU's law enforcement agency), the Carabinieri Corps' military duties include &quot;contributing to national defense, participating in military operations in Italy and abroad, executing military police functions and ensuring the security of Italian diplomatic and consular representations&quot;. As a national police force, it &quot;carries out public order and security policing, as well as investigative activities on its own initiative or at the request of the judicial authorities&quot;. Europol also states that the force is &quot;supplemented by the Specialized Carabinieri Commands, responsible for safeguarding the primary interests of the community: from the protection of the environment, health, work and national cultural heritage, to the observance of community and agri-food regulations, to the suppression of forgery [of] currency&quot;.

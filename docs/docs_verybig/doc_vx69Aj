'''Reading education in the United States''' teaches American students to derive and understand literary patterns. Students that lack proficiency in reading after third grade may face obstacles for the rest of their academic career unless they are able to get extra assistance, such as [[remedial education]]. Fourth-graders encounter a broad range of literary topics, making the third grade a crucial checkpoint for American students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsba.org/-/media/NSBA/File/cpe-learning-to-read-reading-to-learn-white-paper-2015.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=8E0E470C3E263C66E4491EC035224DC9018C6D5F|title=Center for public education, March 2015, NSBA.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Alice-gorham-burt-1905.png|upright|thumb|1905 edition cover of ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland retold in words of one syllable'']]
In colonial times, reading instruction was simple and straightforward: teach children the code then let them read. At that time, reading material was not written specifically for children but consisted primarily of the Bible and some patriotic essays; the most influential early textbook was ''[[The New England Primer]]'' published in the late 1680s. There was little consideration for how to best teach children to read and assess reading comprehension.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams, 1990&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Adams, Marilyn Jager |title=Beginning to read: thinking and learning about print |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1990 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/beginningtoreadt00adam/page/21 21–25] |isbn=0-262-01112-3 |oclc=256731826 |doi= |accessdate= |url=https://archive.org/details/beginningtoreadt00adam/page/21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading education changed significantly in the middle of the 19th century. Educators, in particular [[Horace Mann]], began to advocate for changes in reading instructional methods. He observed that children were bored and &quot;death-like&quot; at school, and insisted that instruction needed to engage children's interest in the reading material by teaching them to read whole words.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams, 1990&quot; /&gt; The [[McGuffey Readers]] (1836) were the most popular of these [[graded reader]]s. [[Kate Harrington (Poet)|Rebecca Smith Pollard]] developed a sequential reading program of intensive synthetic phonics, complete with a separate teacher's manual and spelling and reading books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.k12academics.com/reading-education-united-states/history-reading-education-us|title=History of Reading Education in the U.S. {{!}} K12 Academics|last=Glavin|first=Chris|date=2014-02-06|website=www.k12academics.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1890s to at the latest 1910, [[A. L. Burt]] and other publishing companies published a series of books aimed at young readers that used simple language to retell longer classics. J. C. Gorham produced three works: ''Gulliver's Travels in words of one syllable'' (1896), ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland retold in words of one syllable]]'' (1905), and ''Black Beauty retold in words of one syllable'' (1905). In the UK, Routledge published a similar series between 1900 and 1910.

The meaning-based curriculum did not dominate reading instruction until the second quarter of the 20th century. By the 1930s and 1940s, reading programs became very focused on comprehension and taught children to read whole words by sight. [[Phonics]] were taught sparingly used as a last resort.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams, 1990&quot;/&gt;

In the 1950s, [[Rudolf Flesch]] wrote a book called ''[[Why Johnny Can't Read]]'' addressed to American parents,&lt;ref name=&quot;Flesch, R&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Flesch, Rudolf Franz |title=[[Why Johnny Can't Read|Why Johnny can't read: and what you can do about it]] |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=San Francisco |year=1986 |pages= |isbn=0-06-091340-1 |oclc=12837722 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a passionate argument in favor of teaching children to read using phonics.&lt;ref name=&quot; Adams, 1990&quot;/&gt; He hurled severe criticism at publishers' decisions that he claimed were motivated by profit and questioned the honesty and intelligence of experts, schools, and teachers.&lt;ref name=&quot; Adams, 1990&quot;/&gt; The book was on the bestseller list for 30 weeks and spurred a movement in the general population. It also polarized the reading debate among educators, researchers, and parents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams, 1990&quot;/&gt;

This polarization continues to the present time. In the 1970s, an instructional policy called the [[whole language]] method, which de-emphasized teaching phonics out of context, was introduced and became the primary method of reading instruction in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.helpingeverychildtoread.com/index.php/causes-of-difficulty/reading-theories/whole-word-method|title=Whole Word Method|website=www.helpingeverychildtoread.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, researchers at the [[National Institute of Health]] conducted studies that showed early [[Learning to read|reading acquisition]] depends on the understanding of the connection between sounds and letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Adams, Marilyn Jager |title=Beginning to read: thinking and learning about print |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=0-262-51076-6 |oclc=256731826 |doi= |accessdate= |url=https://archive.org/details/beginningtoread00mari }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Whole Word method was invented by [[Thomas H. Gallaudet]], the director of the American Asylum at Hartford, in the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sightwords.com/sight-words/lessons/|title=Sight Words Teaching Strategy {{!}} Sight Words: Teach Your Child to Read|website=www.sightwords.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed to educate deaf people by juxtaposing a word with a picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/topics/reverend-thomas-hopkins-gallaudet.htm|title=Reverend Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet|last=Vicars|first=William|website=www.lifeprint.com|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1830, Gallaudet described his method to the American Annals of Education, which included teaching children to recognize a total of 50 sight words written on cards, and by 1837 the method was adopted by the Boston Primary School Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/gallaudet-thomas-hopkins3.htm|title=Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet American Sign Language (ASL)|website=www.lifeprint.com|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horace Mann]], the Secretary of the Board of Education of Massachusetts, USA, favored the method, and it soon became the dominant method statewide.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs.org&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/onlyateacher/horace.html|title=PBS Online: Only A Teacher: Schoolhouse Pioneers|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1844 the defects of the new method became so apparent to [[Boston]] schoolmasters that they urged the Board to return to the intensive, [[Phonics#Systematic phonics|systematic phonics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs.org&quot;/&gt; Dr. [[Samuel Orton]], a [[neuropathologist]] in [[Iowa]] in 1929, sought the cause of children's reading problems and concluded that their problems were being caused by the new sight method of reading. His findings were published in the February 1929 issue of the ''Journal of Educational Psychology'' in the article &quot;The [[Sight reading|Sight Reading]] Method of Teaching Reading as a Source of [[Dyslexia|Reading Disability]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Glavin|first=Chris|date=2014-02-06|title=Instructional Methods {{!}} K12 Academics|url=https://www.k12academics.com/reading-education-united-states/instructional-methods|access-date=2020-06-12|website=www.k12academics.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government-funded research on reading and reading instruction in the [[United States]] began in the 1960s. In the 1970s and 1980s, researchers began publishing findings based on converging evidence from multiple studies. However, these findings have been slow to move into typical classroom practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/jameskim/publications/research-and-reading-wars-0|title=Research and the reading wars|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competencies for proficient reading ==

Proficient reading is equally dependent on two critical skills: the ability to understand the language in which the text is written and the ability to recognize and process text. Each of these competencies is dependent on lower-level skills and cognitive abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sedl.org/reading/framework/overview.html |author1=Hoover, Wesley A. |author2=Gough, Philip B. |title=Overview - The Cognitive Foundations of Learning to Read: A Framework |work=The Cognitive Foundations of Learning to Read: A Framework |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children who readily understand spoken language and are able to fluently and easily recognize printed words do not usually have difficulty with [[reading comprehension]]. However, students must be proficient in both competencies to read well; difficulty in either domain undermines the overall reading process. After reading, children should be able to retell the story in their own words, including characters, setting, and the events of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sedl.org/reading/framework/framework.pdf |author=Wren, Sebastian  |title=The Cognitive Foundations of Learning to Read: A Framework |website= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reading researchers define a skilled reader as one who can understand the written text as well as understand the same passage if spoken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

There is some debate as to whether print recognition requires the ability to perceive printed text and translate it into spoken language, or rather to translate printed text directly into meaningful symbolic models and relationships. The existence of speed reading and its typically high comprehension rate would suggest that the translation into verbal form as an intermediate to understanding is not a prerequisite for effective reading comprehension. This aspect of reading is the crux of much of the reading debate.

The purpose of reading is to have access to the literature of a specific language. Reading materials have traditionally been chosen from literary texts that represent 'higher' forms of culture. According to many traditional approaches, the learner aims to study vocabulary items, grammar, and sentence structures, with a concern for learning the syntax of these 'higher' cultures. These approaches assume that authentic reading material is limited to the work or experience of great authors.

== Instructional methods ==

A variety of different methods of teaching reading have been advocated in [[English-speaking countries]]. In the United States, the debate is often more political than objective.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams, MJ 13&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Adams, Marilyn Jager |title=Beginning to read: thinking and learning about print |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1995 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/beginningtoread00mari/page/13 13] |isbn=0-262-51076-6 |oclc=469305891 |doi= |accessdate= |url=https://archive.org/details/beginningtoread00mari/page/13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parties often divide into two camps{{Clarify|reason=What are these two camps?|date=August 2020}} which refuse to accept each other's terminology or frame of reference. Despite this, both camps often incorporate aspects of the other's methods.

In 2000, the [[National Reading Panel]] (NRP) issued a report based on a meta-analysis of published research on effective reading instruction. The report found varying evidence-based support for some common approaches to teaching reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the National Reading Panel: Teaching Children to Read|url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/findings.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phonemic awareness====
The NRP called phonemic awareness (PA) instruction &quot;impressive&quot;:&lt;blockquote&gt;Overall, the findings showed that teaching children to manipulate phonemes in words was highly effective under a variety of teaching conditions with a variety of learners across a range of grade and age levels and that teaching phonemic awareness to children significantly improves their reading more than instruction that lacks any attention to PA.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The report singles out PA instruction based on teaching children to manipulate phonemes with letters as highly effective. Phonemic awareness instruction also improved spelling in grade-level students, although it did not improve spelling in disabled readers.

===Lexical reading===
Lexical reading involves acquiring words or phrases without attention to the characters or groups of characters that compose them or by using [[whole language]] learning and teaching methodology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ventral and Dorsal Streams&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name='Neural Representations'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Chinese Ventral and Dorsal Streams'/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Changes Reading Strategies&quot; /&gt; Sometimes argued to compete with phonics methods, and that the whole language approach tends to impair learning how to spell.

Historically, the two camps have been called [[Whole Language]] and [[Phonics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jan.ucc.nau.edu/jar/Reading_Wars.html|title=Reading Wars: Phonics vs. Whole Language|last=Reyhner|first=Jon|website=jan.ucc.nau.edu|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the whole language instructional method has also been referred to as a &quot;literature-based reading program&quot; and &quot;integrated language arts curriculum&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Chall, Jeanne S. and Helen M.

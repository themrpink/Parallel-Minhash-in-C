After its Roman, [[Vandals|Vandal]], [[Ostrogoth]], [[Byzantine]] and (from 827) [[Emirate of Sicily|Arab]] conquests, Trapani was taken by the [[Italo-Normans|Normans]] of [[Roger I of Sicily|Roger I]] in 1077, flourishing under their dominations and having also a role in the [[Crusades]] as one of the most important ports in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In the 17th century, the city decayed due to revolts, plagues, and famines, but in the following century, it grew from 16,000 to 30,000 inhabitants; commerce remained of local importance, while its military position in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Kingdom of Naples]] remained notable.

The city was badly damaged during [[World War II]], when it was subjected to intense Allied bombardments. It has grown greatly since the end of the war, sprawling out virtually to the foot of [[Monte San Giuliano]]. Tourism has grown in recent years due to the city's proximity to popular destinations such as [[Erice]], [[Segesta]], and the [[Egadi Islands]].

==Government and demographics==
{{See also|List of mayors of Trapani|Boroughs of Trapani}}
The ''comune'' of Trapani consists of two discontiguous parts separated by the ''comune'' of [[Paceco]]. The northern part includes much of the city and some rural area; the much larger southern part includes the area of Marausa, half of [[Vincenzo Florio Airport Trapani-Birgi|Trapani-Birgi Airport]] and a large rural area. The ''comune'' does not include the north-eastern suburbs of the urban area, such as Casa Santa, which are part of the ''comune'' of [[Erice]]. The ''comune'' of Trapani has a population of 70,000, less than the 80,000 of [[Marsala]], the most populous ''comune'' in the province. The entire urban area of Trapani, including those parts in the ''comune'' of Erice, has over 90,000 residents.

==Economy==
Much of Trapani's economy still depends on the sea. [[Fishing]] and [[canning]] are the main local industries, with fishermen using the ''mattanza'' technique to catch [[tuna]]. Coral is also an important export, along with [[salt]], [[marble]], and [[marsala wine]]. The nearby coast is lined with numerous salt-pans. These saltpans were formed by the evaporation of seawater and are situated majestically along the coast road between Trapani and Marsala.

The city is also an important ferry port, with links to the Egadi Islands, [[Pantelleria]], [[Sardinia]], and [[Tunisia]]. It also has its own airport, the [[Trapani-Birgi Airport]].

==Main sights==

Much of the old city of Trapani dates from the later medieval or early modern periods; there are no extant remains of the ancient city. Many of the city's historic buildings are designed in the [[Baroque]] style. Notable monuments include:
[[File:Trapani-PiazzaGaribaldi.JPG|thumb|right|Piazza [[Garibaldi]]]]

* The Church of ''Sant'Agostino'' (14th century), with the splendid rose-window
* The Church of ''Santa Maria di Gesù ''(15th–16th centuries)
* The magnificent [[Basilica-Sanctuary of Maria Santissima Annunziata]] (also called &quot;Madonna di Trapani&quot;) originally built in 1315–1332 and rebuilt in 1760. It houses a marble statue of the Madonna of Trapani, which might be the work of [[Nino Pisano]], and the [[Museo regionale Agostino Pepoli]].
* ''Fontana di Tritone'' (&quot;[[Triton (mythology)|Triton's]] Fountain&quot;)
* The Baroque ''Palazzo della [[Giudecca or Judeca (Medieval Italy's Jewish quarters)|Giudecca]] '' or ''Casa Ciambra''.
* The Cathedral (built in 1421, but restored to the current appearance in the 18th century by Giovanni Biagio Amico). It includes an ''Annunciation'' attributed to [[Anthony van Dyck]].
* Church of ''Maria SS. dell'Intria'', another notable example of Sicilian Baroque.
* Church of ''Badia Nuova'', a small Baroque church.
* [[Castello di Terra]], a ruined 12th-century castle.
* [[Ligny Tower]], a 17th-century watchtower housing an archaeological museum.

Monte [[Erice]] is a cable car ride from the city and aside from the cobbled streets and medieval castle, there are views of Tunisia and Africa from up there on clear days.

Several beaches run along the coast of Trapani, the best of which are at Marausa about {{convert|9|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the city.

==Culture==

The city is renowned for its [[Easter]] related [[Holy Week]] activities and traditions, culminating between [[Good Friday]] and [[Holy Saturday]] in the [[Processione dei Misteri di Trapani]], colloquially simply the ''Misteri di Trapani'' (in English the Procession of the Mysteries of Trapani or the Mysteries of Trapani), a day-long passion procession organized and sponsored by the city's guilds, featuring twenty floats of wood, canvas and glue sculptures, mostly from the 17th and 18th centuries, of individual scenes of the events of the Passion.[[File:Trapani Misteri.jpg|thumb|right| More details [[Easter|Easter procession]], The Misteri]]

The ''Misteri'' are among the oldest continuously running religious events in [[Europe]], having been played every Good Friday since before the Easter of 1612. Running for at least 16 continuous hours, but occasionally well beyond the 24 hours, they are the longest religious festival in Sicily and in Italy. Important also to the cult of the [[Madonna of Trapani]].

The city gives its name to a variety of [[pesto]] – ''[[pesto alla trapenese]]'' – made using [[almond]]s instead of the traditional [[pine nut]]s in Ligurian pesto.

==Transport==

[[Vincenzo Florio Airport Trapani-Birgi|Trapani-Birgi Airport]] is a military-civil joint use airport (third for traffic on the island). Recently the airport has seen an increase of traffic thanks to low-cost carriers from all parts of Europe (i.e. London-Stansted and London-Luton, Paris Beauvais, Dublin, Bruxelles, Munich, Frankfurt, Eindhoven, Stockholm, Malta).

==Sport==
From 28 September to 9 October 2005 Trapani was the location of Acts 8 and 9 of the [[Louis Vuitton Cup]]. This sailing race featured, among other entrants, all the boats that took part in the 2007 [[America's Cup]].

The town is also the base for the local football team [[Trapani Calcio]]. Founded in 1905, they are nicknamed the Granata (the Maroons) after their kit colour. In [[2010]], [[Trapani Calcio]] was admitted into the [[2010–11 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione]] (formerly Serie C2), ending the club's 13-year absence from the professional ranks. Subsequently, it made debut in [[Serie B]] in the 2013–14 season. It currently plays in [[Serie B]] with the coach [[Fabrizio Castori]].

==Climate==
Trapani has a [[Mediterranean climate#Hot-summer mediterranean climate|hot-summer mediterranean climate]] with hot and dry summers coupled with moderately wet and mild winters. Summer lows are cooler than in other places of Sicily and Calabria, while at the same time remaining significantly warm for several months.

'''Wilfred Ruprecht Bion''' [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] ({{IPAc-en|b|iː|ˈ|ɒ|n}}; 8 September 1897 – 8 November 1979) was an influential English [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]], who became president of the [[British Psychoanalytical Society]] from 1962 to 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wilfred Bion|url=http://psychoanalysis.org.uk/our-authors-and-theorists/wilfred-bion|website=Institute of Psychoanalysis|publisher=[[British Psychoanalytical Society]]|accessdate=10 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and military service==

[[File:Wilfred Bion 1916.jpg|thumb|right|Wilfred Bion in uniform in 1916]]
Bion was born in [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], [[North-Western Provinces]], [[British India|India]], and educated at [[Bishop's Stortford College]] in England.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;Malcolm Pines, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/51057 'Bion, Wilfred Ruprecht (1897–1979)'], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], September 2004; online edition, May 2007. {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/51057}}.

{{quote|Awarded the Distinguished Service Order.

[...]

T./2nd Lt, Wilfred Ruprecht Bion, Tank Corps.

For conspicuous gallantry, and devotion to duty. When in command of his tank in an attack he engaged a large number of enemy machine guns in strong positions, thus assisting the infantry to advance. When his tank was put out of action by a direct hit he occupied a section of trench with his men and machine guns and opened fire on the enemy. He moved about in the open, giving directions to other tanks when they arrived, and at one period fired a Lewis gun with great effect from the top of his tank. He also got a captured machine gun into action against the enemy, and when reinforcements arrived he took command of a company of infantry whose commander was killed. He showed magnificent courage and initiative in a most difficult situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30801 |supp=y|page=8439|date=16 July 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Education and early career==

After World War I, Bion studied history at [[The Queen's College, Oxford]], earning a bachelor of arts degree in 1922, before studying medicine at [[University College London]].

Initially attracted to London by the &quot;strange new subject called psychoanalysis&quot;, he met and was impressed by [[Wilfred Trotter]], an outstanding brain surgeon who published the famous ''[[Instincts of the Herd in Peace and War]]'' in 1916, based on the horrors of the First World War. This was to prove an important influence on Bion's interest in group behavior. Having qualified in medicine by means of the [[Conjoint|Conjoint Diploma]] (MRCS England, LRCP London) in 1930&lt;ref&gt;The Medical Directory, 125th edition, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; Bion spent seven years in psychotherapeutic training at the Tavistock Clinic, an experience he regarded, in retrospect, as having had some limitations. It did, however, bring him into fruitful contact with [[Samuel Beckett]]. He wanted to train in Psychoanalysis and in 1938 he began a [[training analysis (psychotherapy)|training analysis]] with [[John Rickman (psychoanalyst)|John Rickman]], but this was brought to an end by the advent of the Second World War.

Bion was recommissioned in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] as a lieutenant on 1 April 1940,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34843 |supp=y|pages=2703–2704|date=3 May 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; and worked in a number of military hospitals including [[Northfield Hospital|Northfield Military Hospital]] (Hollymoor Hospital, Birmingham) where he initiated the first Northfield Experiment. These ideas on the psychoanalysis of groups were then taken up and developed by others such as [[S. H. Foulkes]], Rickman, Bridger, Main and [[Patrick De Mare]]. The entire group at Tavistock had in fact been taken into the army, and were working on new methods of treatment for psychiatric casualties (those suffering post-traumatic stress, or &quot;shell shock&quot; as it was then known.) Out of this his pioneering work in [[group dynamics]], associated with the &quot;Tavistock group&quot;, Bion's papers describing his work of the 1940s were compiled much later and appeared together in 1961 in his influential book, ''Experiences in Groups and other papers.'' It was less a guide for the therapy of individuals within or by the group, than an exploration of the processes set off by the complex experience of being in a group. The book quickly became a touchstone work for applications of group theory in a wide variety of fields.

In 1945, during the Second World War, Bion's wife [[Betty Jardine]] gave birth to a daughter, but Betty died a few days afterwards. His daughter, Parthenope, became a psychoanalyst in Italy, and often lectured and wrote about her father's work. Parthenope died, together with her 18-year-old daughter Patrizia, in a car crash in Italy in July 1998.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=bjp.015.0368a&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
Returning to the Tavistock Clinic Bion chaired the Planning Committee that reorganized the Tavistock into the new [[Tavistock Institute]] of Human Relations, alongside a new Tavistock Clinic which was part of the newly launched [[National Health Service]]. As his interest in psychoanalysis increased, he underwent training analysis, between 1946 and 1952, with [[Melanie Klein]]. He met his second wife, Francesca, at the Tavistock in 1951. He joined a research group of Klein's students (including [[Hanna Segal]] and Herbert Rosenfeld), who were developing Klein's theory of the paranoid-schizoid and the depressive positions, for use in the analysis of patients with psychotic disorders. He produced a series of highly original and influential papers (collected as &quot;''Second Thoughts''&quot;, 1967) on the analysis of schizophrenia, and the specifically cognitive, perceptual, and identity problems of such patients. To this he added a valuable final section called Commentary, showing how some of his views on clinical and theoretical matters had changed.

Bion's theories, which were always based in the phenomena of the analytic encounter, revealed both correspondences and expansions of core ideas from both Sigmund Freud and Melanie Klein.&lt;ref&gt;Symington J. &amp; Symington N.. ''The Clinical Thinking of Wilfred Bion'' (London 1996) pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, he attempted to understand thoughts and thinking from an 'algebraic', 'geometric' and  'mathematised' point of view, believing there to be too little precision in the existing vocabulary, a process culminating in &quot;The Grid&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psyche.com/psyche/mt/archives/000021.html Bion: Basic Assumptions &amp; The Grid]&lt;/ref&gt; Later he abandoned the complex, abstract applications of mathematics, and the Grid, and developed a more intuitive approach, epitomised in ''Attention and Interpretation'' (1970).

In 1968, Bion moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]],&lt;ref&gt;Bion W.R. (1985). All My Sins Remembered: Another Part of a Life and the Other Side of Genius ‐ Family Letters by Wilfred R. Bion. London : Karnac Books.&lt;/ref&gt; where he remained until 1977. During those years he mentored a number of psychoanalysts interested in Kleinian approaches, including [[James Gooch]] and other founding members of the [[Psychoanalytic Center of California]]. Shortly before his death, he returned to Oxfordshire.&lt;ref&gt;Culbert‐Koehn, J. (2011), An analysis with Bion: an interview with James Gooch. Journal of Analytical Psychology, 56: 76-91. doi:10.1111/j.1468-5922.2010.01891.x&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and stature==
Bion left a reputation which has grown steadily both in Britain and internationally.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} Some commentators consider that his writings are often gnomic and irritating, but never fail to stimulate. He defies categorisation as a follower of Klein or of Freud. While Bion is most well known outside of the psychoanalytic community for his work on group dynamics, the psychoanalytic conversation that explores his work is mainly concerned with his theory of thinking, and his model of the development of a capacity for thought.

Wilfred Bion was a potent and original contributor to psychoanalysis. He was one of the first to analyse patients in psychotic states using an unmodified analytic technique; he extended existing theories of projective processes and developed new conceptual tools. The degree of collaboration between [[Hanna Segal]], Wilfred Bion and [[Herbert Rosenfeld]] in their work with psychotic patients during the late 1950s, and their discussions with [[Melanie Klein]] at the time, means that it is not always possible to distinguish their exact individual contributions to the developing theory of splitting, projective identification, unconscious phantasy and the use of countertransference. As Donald Meltzer (1979, 1981), Denis Carpy (1989, p.&amp;nbsp;287), and Michael Feldman (2009, pp.&amp;nbsp;33, 42) have pointed out, these three pioneering analysts not only sustained Klein’s clinical and theoretical approach, but through an extension of the concept of projective identification and countertransference they deepened and expanded it. In Bion’s clinical work and supervision the goal remains insightful understanding of psychic reality through a disciplined experiencing of the transference–countertransference, in a way that promotes the growth of the whole personality.

'Bion's ideas are highly unique', so that he 'remained larger than life to almost all who encountered him'.&lt;ref&gt;James T. Grotstein, ''A Beam of Intense Darkness'' (London 2007). pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; He has been considered by [[Neville Symington]] as possibly &quot;the greatest psychoanalytic thinker...after [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 2003). p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Group experiments==
Bion performed a lot of group experiments when he was put in charge of the training wing of a military hospital.&lt;ref&gt;W.R. Bion. Experiences in Groups - and other papers. (2001). Bruner-Routledge, New York. Page 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides observing the basic assumptions recurring in these groups, he also has observed some very interesting phenomena to which he believed may well apply to society.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, pg. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

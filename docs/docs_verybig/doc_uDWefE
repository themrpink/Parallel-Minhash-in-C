In ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', it is revealed that Voldemort murdered his father and grandparents, leaving himself the only surviving member of the Riddle family.

In the film adaptation of ''The Goblet of Fire'', Voldemort's grandparents were given the names Thomas and Mary Riddle.

=== Gaunt family ===
Most of the [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] of the '''House of Gaunt'''{{'}}s background occurs in ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', through the medium of Dumbledore's [[Pensieve]]. The Gaunts were once a powerful and influential family, and are the last known descendants of [[Salazar Slytherin]]. However, a vein of mental instability and violence within the family, reinforced through [[cousin marriage]]s intended to preserve the pureblood line, had reduced them to poverty and squalor, as shown in the Pensieve's &quot;memory&quot; that Harry and Dumbledore witnessed. Like Salazar Slytherin, the Gaunts spoke Parseltongue. At the time of the story, the Gaunts' only material asset is a ramshackle shanty in Little Hangleton, that stood in a thicket in a valley opposite the Riddle House. Like the Riddles, the Gaunts were also unpopular with the local residents, with a reputation for being vulgar and intimidating.&lt;ref name=&quot;{{HP6}}ch10&quot;&gt;{{HPref|book=6|chapter=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marvolo''' Gaunt was the last Gaunt family patriarch. He was sentenced to a short term in [[Azkaban]] for his and his son's assault upon a [[Ministry of Magic]] official; this affected his health and he died soon after returning home. His [[Seal (device)#Signet rings|signet ring]] passed to his son, '''Morfin''' Gaunt, who was convicted of assaulting a Muggle, and later died in [[Azkaban]], convicted this time as a party to the murder of Tom Riddle Jr. and Riddle's parents.&lt;ref name=&quot;{{HP6}}ch17&quot;&gt;{{HPref|book=6|chapter=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dumbledore discovers the real culprit while visiting Morfin in Azkaban to gather information about Voldemort. After Dumbledore successfully extracts Morfin's memory of his encounter with his nephew, he tries to use the evidence to have Morfin released, but Morfin dies before the decision can be made. The House of Gaunt ended with Morfin's death.

'''Merope''' Gaunt ({{IPAc-en|m|ɛ|ˈ|r|oʊ|p|i}}) was the daughter of Marvolo, sister of Morfin. Harry's first impression of her was that she looked &quot;like the most defeated person he had ever seen&quot;. She married Tom Riddle Jr and became pregnant within three months of the wedding.&lt;ref name=&quot;{{HP6}}ch10&quot; /&gt; It is suggested that she tricked her husband into loving her by using a [[Magic in Harry Potter#Magic and love|love potion]], but when she became pregnant, she chose to stop administering the potion. It is implied that Merope had grown tired of living the lie and thought that her husband might have grown to love her, or that he might have stayed for the sake of their unborn child; however, he left her. Desperate, Merope wandered through the streets of London. The only thing she had left was the heavy gold locket that had once belonged to Salazar Slytherin, one of her family's most treasured items, which she sold for a small amount. When she was due to give birth, she stumbled into a [[Muggle]] orphanage, where she gave birth to her only son, '''Tom Marvolo Riddle'''. She died within the next hour.

'''Gormlaith''' Gaunt was a 17th-century descendant of [[Salazar Slytherin]], and like Salazar, a Parselmouth. Her wand was that which once belonged to Salazar himself. Educated at Hogwarts, Gormlaith lived in Ireland in the early 1600s. In about 1608, Gormlaith killed her estranged unnamed sister, and her sister's husband, William Sayre (a descendant of the Irish witch Morrigan), and kidnapped their five-year-old daughter, Isolt Sayre, raising her in the neighbouring valley of Coomcallee, or &quot;Hag's Glen&quot;, because she felt that her parents' association with Muggles would badly influence Isolt. Fanatical and cruel, Gormlaith used Dark magic to isolate Isolt from others, forbade her a wand, and did not allow her to attend Hogwarts as she herself had, disgusted that it was now filled with Muggle-borns. After twelve years with Gormlaith, Isolt stole Gormlaith's wand and fled to the [[British America|Colonies]] and settled in [[Massachusetts]], where she founded the Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. When Gormlaith learned of the school, she pursued her niece in Massachusetts, where she was killed by Isolt's friend, William the [[Pukwudgie]], with a venom-tipped arrow.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rowling, J.K.]] (28 June 2016).

The Gaunts, including Voldemort, are distantly related to Harry because they are descendants of the [[Peverell brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=TIME Person of The Year Runner-up: J.K.

Voldemort has also been compared with other characters within fiction, for example [[Sauron]] from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''; they are, during the time when the main plot takes place, seeking to recover their lost power after having been considered dead or at least no longer a threat, and are also so feared that they are sometimes unnamed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=GreenBooks.

== In popular culture ==
Several campaigns have used Voldemort to compare his evil to the influence of politicians, large media and corporations. &quot;Lord Voldemort&quot; is a nickname sometimes used for [[Peter Mandelson]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' page 23, 20 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Voldemort is also a recurring theme among wizard rock bands. ''[[Voldemort Can't Stop the Rock!]]'' is the second album from [[Harry and the Potters]], and the character is mentioned in songs such as &quot;The Dark Lord Lament&quot; and &quot;Flesh, Blood, and Bone&quot;.

Voldemort has been parodied in various venues. In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' 13th season's premiere, &quot;[[Treehouse of Horror XII]]&quot;, [[Montgomery Burns]] appears as &quot;Lord Montymort&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snpp.com/episodes/CABF19 &quot;Treehouse of Horror XII&quot; episode capsule at The Simpsons Archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715090012/http://www.snpp.com/episodes/CABF19 |date=15 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A parody of Voldemort appears in ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy]]'' as &quot;Lord Moldybutt&quot;, an enemy of [[List of characters in The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy#Nigel Planter|Nigel Planter]] (a parody of Harry).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weird Al Yankovic Biography (1959–)|publisher=.filmreference.com|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/90/Weird-Al-Yankovic.html |access-date=10 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voldemort also appears in the ''[[The Potter Puppet Pals|Potter Puppet Pals]]'' sketches by [[Neil Cicierega]].

[[File:Madeira Wine.jpg|thumb|right|Madeira wine]]

'''Madeira''' is a [[fortified wine]] made on the Portuguese [[Madeira Islands]], off the coast of Africa. Madeira is produced in a variety of styles ranging from [[dry wine]]s which can be consumed on their own as an [[aperitif]] to sweet wines usually consumed with [[dessert]]. Cheaper cooking versions are often flavoured with [[salt]] and [[Black pepper|pepper]] for use in cooking, but these are not fit for consumption as a beverage.

The islands of Madeira have a long [[winemaking]] history, dating back to the [[Age of Exploration]] (approximately from the end of the 15th century) when Madeira was a standard [[Port#Port of call|port of call]] for ships heading to the [[New World]] or [[East Indies]]. To prevent the wine from spoiling, neutral [[grape spirit]]s were added. On the long sea voyages, the wines would be exposed to excessive heat and movement which transformed the flavour of the wine. This was discovered by the wine producers of Madeira when an unsold shipment of wine returned to the islands after a round trip. 

Today, Madeira is noted for its unique winemaking process which involves oxidizing the wine through heat and aging. The younger blends (three and five years old) are produced with artificial methods that heat and accelerate the aging process and the older blends, colheitas and frasqueiras are produced by the canteiro method. Because of these methods of production these wines are very long lived and those produced by the canteiro method will survive for decades and even centuries, even after being opened. Wines that have been in barrels for many decades are often removed and stored in [[demijohn]]s where they may remain unharmed indefinitely. 

Some wines produced in small quantities in [[Crimea]], [[California]] and [[Texas]] are also referred to as &quot;Madeira&quot; or &quot;Madera&quot;; however, most countries conform to the [[European Union|EU]] [[Protected designation of origin|PDO]] regulations and limit the use of the term ''Madeira'' or ''Madère'' to only those wines that come from the [[Madeira Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/consumers/product_labelling_and_packaging/l21303_en.htm | title = Labeling of wine and certain other wine sector products | publisher = Europa: Summaries of EU legislation | date = 20 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of Madeira ==

===Development and success (15th – 18th centuries)===
[[File:MadeiraLocation.png|thumb|Madeira's location made it an ideal stopping location for voyages to the [[East Indies]].]]
The roots of Madeira's wine industry date back to the [[Age of Exploration]], when Madeira was a regular port of call for ships travelling to the [[East Indies]]. By the 16th century, records indicate that a well-established wine industry on the island supplied these ships with wine for the long voyages across the sea. The earliest examples of Madeira were unfortified and had the habit of spoiling at sea. However, following the example of [[Port (wine)|Port]], a small amount of [[distilled alcohol]] made from [[cane sugar]] was added to [[stabilize the wine]] by boosting the alcohol content (the modern process of fortification using [[brandy]] did not become widespread until the 18th century). The [[Dutch East India Company]] became a regular customer, picking up large (112 [[gallon|gal]]/423 [[liter|l]]) casks of wine known as &quot;pipes&quot; for their voyages to [[India]].

The intense heat in the holds of the ships had a transforming effect on the wine, as discovered by Madeira producers when one shipment was returned to the island after a long trip. The customer was found to prefer the taste of this style of wine, and Madeira labeled as ''vinho da roda'' (wines that have made a round trip) became very popular. Madeira producers found that [[aging the wine]] on long sea voyages was very costly, so began to develop methods on the island to produce the same aged and heated style. They began storing the wines on trestles at the winery or in special rooms known as ''estufas'', where the heat of island sun would age the wine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford pg 416-419&quot;&gt;{{Citation | title =The Oxford Companion to Wine | editor-last =Robinson | editor-first =J. | edition =Third | year =2006 | publisher =Oxford University Press | isbn =0-19-860990-6 | url =https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00janc }}. Pages 416-419.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th century was the &quot;[[golden age]]&quot; for Madeira. The wine's popularity extended from the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] and [[Brazil]] in the New World to [[Great Britain]], [[Russia]], and [[Northern Africa]]. The American colonies, in particular, were enthusiastic customers, consuming as much as 95% of all wine produced on the island each year.

=== Early American history (17th – 18th centuries) ===

Madeira was a very important wine in the history of the United States of America.

Pages 719-720.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major events on the road to the [[American revolution]] in which Madeira played a key role was the British seizure of [[John Hancock]]'s [[sloop]] {{HMS|Liberty|1768|2}} on 9 May 1768. Hancock's boat was seized after he had unloaded a cargo of 25 pipes (3,150 gallons) of Madeira, and a dispute arose over import duties.

Madeira was a favorite of [[Thomas Jefferson]], and it was used to toast the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford pg 416-419&quot;/&gt; [[George Washington]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[John Adams]] are also said to have appreciated the qualities of Madeira. The wine was mentioned in Benjamin Franklin's autobiography. On one occasion, Adams wrote to his wife, Abigail, of the great quantities of Madeira he consumed while a Massachusetts delegate to the [[Continental Congress]]. A bottle of Madeira was used by visiting Captain James Server to christen {{USS|Constitution}} in 1797. Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] was also known to appreciate Madeira, as were his cohorts on the early U.S. Supreme Court.

===Modern era (19th century – present)===
The mid-19th century ushered an end to the industry's prosperity. First came the 1851 discovery of [[powdery mildew]], which severely reduced production over the next three years. Just as the industry was recovering through the use of the [[copper]]-based [[Bordeaux mixture]] fungicide, the [[phylloxera epidemic]] that had plagued [[France (wine)|France]] and other European [[wine region]]s reached the island. By the end of the 19th century, most of the island's vineyards had been uprooted, and many were converted to sugar cane production. The majority of the vineyards that did replant chose to use American vine varieties, such as ''[[Vitis labrusca]], [[Vitis riparia]] and [[Vitis rupestris]]'' or [[hybrid grape]] varieties rather than replant with the ''[[Vitis vinifera]]'' varieties that were previously grown.
 
By the turn of the 20th century, sales started to slowly return to normal, until the industry was rocked again by the [[Russian Civil War]] and [[American Prohibition]], which closed off two of Madeira's biggest markets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford pg 416-419&quot;/&gt; After the repeal of Prohibition, improved shipping technology meant that ships no longer needed to stop off in Madeira, the island which was directly in the trade winds between Europe and America. The wine became known as The Forgotten Island Wine. The rest of the 20th century saw a downturn for Madeira, both in sales and reputation, as low quality &quot;[[cooking wine]]&quot; became primarily associated with the island—much as it had for [[Marsala (wine)|Marsala]].

In 1988, the Symington family of Portugal invested in the Madeira Wine Company which owned many of the Madeira brand names. They asked [[Bartholomew Broadbent]] to re-launch Madeira and create a market for it again in America, which he did in 1989, establishing a firm rebirth of Madeira.

Towards the end of 20th century, some producers started a renewed focus on quality—ripping out the hybrid and American vines and replanting with the &quot;noble grape&quot; varieties of [[Sercial]], [[Verdelho]], [[Bual]] and [[Malvasia]]. The &quot;workhorse&quot; varieties of [[Tinta Negra Mole]] now known officially as just Tinta Negra, and [[Complexa]] are still present and in high use, but hybrid grapes were officially banned from wine production in 1979. Today, Madeira's primary markets are in the [[Benelux]] countries, France, where it is entirely used for cooking, salt and pepper having been added prior to bottling, and Germany; emerging markets are growing in Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford pg 416-419&quot;/&gt;

===Climate and geography===
[[File:Vinice Madeira Santana.JPG|thumb|left|Vineyard growing among other cultures in the [[tropical climate|tropical influenced]] climate near Santana, Madeira.]]

The island of Madeira has an [[oceanic climate]] with some [[tropical climate|tropical influences]]. With high rainfall and average mean temperature of 66&amp;nbsp;°F (19&amp;nbsp;°C), the threats of [[fungal]] [[grape diseases]] and [[botrytis cinerea|botrytis]] rot are constant [[viticultural]] hazards. To combat these threats, Madeira vineyards are often planted on low [[trellises (vine)|trellises]], known as ''latada'', that raise the [[canopy (grape)|canopy]] of the vine off the ground similar to a style used in the [[Vinho Verde]] region of Portugal. The terrain of the mountainous volcanic island is difficult to cultivate, so vineyards are planted on man-made [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraces]] of red and brown [[basalt]]ic [[bedrock]]. These terraces, known as ''poios'', are very similar to the terraces of the [[Douro]] that make Port wine production possible. The use of mechanical [[harvest (wine)|harvesting]] and vineyard equipment is near impossible, making wine grape growing a costly endeavor on the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford pg 416-419&quot;/&gt; Many vineyards have in the past been ripped up for commercial tourist developments or replanted with such products as bananas for commercial concerns. Some replanting is taking place on the island; however, the tourist trade is generally seen as a more lucrative business than wine-making.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sotheby pg 340-341&quot;&gt;{{Citation | first=T. |last=Stevenson | title =The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia | publisher = Dorling Kindersley | date = 2005 | isbn= 0-7566-1324-8}}. Pages 340-341.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the grapes, grown by around 2100 grape growers are from vines planted on small plots of land off of which the grape growers survive by making an income from a variety of different inter-grown crops.

=== Grape varieties ===
[[File:Malvasia roja.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Malvasia]] (also known as Malmsey or Malvazia) grape variety.]]

Approximately 85% of Madeira is produced with the red grape, [[Tinta Negra Mole|Negra Mole]]. The four major white grape varieties used for Madeira production are (from sweetest to driest) [[Malvasia]], [[Bual]], [[Verdelho]] and [[Sercial]]. These varieties also lend their names to Madeira labeling, as discussed below. Occasionally one sees [[Terrantez]], [[Bastardo grape|Bastardo]] and [[Moscatel]] varieties, although these are now increasingly rare on the island because of [[Uncinula necator|oidium]] and [[phylloxera]]. After the phylloxera epidemic, many wines were &quot;mislabeled&quot; as containing one of these noble grape varieties, which were reinterpreted as &quot;wine styles&quot; rather than true varietal names. Since the epidemic, Tinta Negra (or Negra Mole) and [[Complexa]] are the workhorse varieties on the island, and are found in various concentrations in many blends and vintage wines. Bastardo, Complexa and Tinta Negra are red grape varieties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sotheby pg 340-341&quot;/&gt;

Regulations enacted recently by the [[European Union]] have applied the rule that 85% of the grapes in the wine must be of the variety on the label. Thus, wines from before the late 19th century (pre-phylloxera) and after the late 20th century conform to this rule. Many &quot;varietally labelled&quot; madeiras, from most of the 20th century, do not. Modern Madeiras which do not carry a varietal label are generally made from Negra Mole.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sotheby pg 340-341&quot;/&gt;

Other varieties planted on the island, though not legally permitted for Madeira production, include [[Arnsburger]], [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], and the American hybrids [[Cunningham (grape)|Cunningham]] and [[Jacquet (grape)|Jacquet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford pg 416-419&quot;/&gt;

=== Winemaking ===
[[File:Sercial Maderia.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A dry Madeira made from the Sercial grape.]]
The initial [[winemaking]] steps of Madeira start out like most other wines: grapes are harvested, crushed, [[pressed (wine)|pressed]], and then [[fermentation (wine)|fermented]] in either stainless steel or [[oak (wine)|oak]] casks. The grape varieties destined for sweeter wines – Bual and Malvasia – are often fermented on their skins to [[maceration (wine)|leach]] more [[Phenolic content in wine|phenol]]s from the grapes to balance the sweetness of the wine. The more dry wines – made from Sercial, Verdelho, and Negra Mole – are separated from their skins prior to fermentation. Depending on the level of sweetness desired, fermentation of the wine is halted at some point by the addition of neutral grape spirits.

The wines undergo the ''estufagem'' aging process to produce Madeira's distinctive flavor.

Colourings such as [[caramel coloring]] have been used in the past to give some consistency (see also [[whiskey]]), although this practice is decreasing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford pg 416-419&quot;/&gt;

=== &quot;Estufagem&quot; process ===
[[File:MadeiraWinery.jpg|right|thumb|Barrels of Madeira in the sun: the unique ''estufagem'' process in ''Canteiro'' helped protect the wine for long sea voyages through tropical climates.]] What makes Madeira wine production unique is the ''estufagem'' aging process, meant to duplicate the effect of a long sea voyage on the [[aging barrel]]s through tropical climates. Three main methods are used to heat age the wine, used according to the quality and cost of the finished wine:
*''Cuba de Calor'': The most common, used for low cost Madeira, is bulk aging in low stainless steel or concrete tanks surrounded by either heat coils or piping that allow hot water to circulate around the container. The wine is heated to temperatures as high as 130&amp;nbsp;°F (55&amp;nbsp;°C) for a minimum of 90 days as regulated by the Madeira Wine Institute. However, the Madeira is most commonly heated to approximately 115&amp;nbsp;°F
*''Armazém de Calor'': Only used by the Madeira Wine Company, this method involves storing the wine in large wooden casks in a specially designed room outfitted with steam-producing tanks or pipes that heat the room, creating a type of [[sauna]]. This process more gently exposes the wine to heat, and can last from six months to over a year.
*''Canteiro'': Used for the highest quality Madeiras, these wines are aged without the use of any artificial heat, being stored by the winery in warm rooms left to age by the heat of the sun. In cases such as [[vintage]] Madeira, this heating process can last from 20 years to 100 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford pg 416-419&quot;/&gt; This process is used by many of the top Madiera brands, including Broadbent and Justino's. Justino's produces more than 50% of all Madeira. Adding in the other brands owned by Justino's, such as Henriques&amp;Henriques, the family which owns Justino's is responsible for producing over 70% of all the Madeira on the island.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The '''guar''' or ''' cluster bean''', with the botanical name '''''Cyamopsis tetragonoloba''''', is an annual [[legume]] and the source of [[guar gum]]. It is also known as gavar, gawar, or guvar bean.

The origin of ''Cyamopsis tetragonoloba'' is unknown, since it has never been found in the wild.&lt;ref name=Whistler&gt;Whistler R.L. and Hymowitz T. 1979. Guar: agronomy, production, industrial use and nutrition. Purdue University Press, West Lafayette&lt;/ref&gt; It is assumed to have developed from the African species ''[[Cyamopsis senegalensis]]''. It was further domesticated in [[South Asia]], where it has been cultivated for centuries.&lt;ref name=Mudgil&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mudgil | first1 = D. | last2 = Barak | first2 = S. | last3 = Khatkar | first3 = B. S. | doi = 10.1007/s13197-011-0522-x | title = Guar gum: Processing, properties and food applications—A Review | journal = Journal of Food Science and Technology | year = 2011 | pmid =  24587515| pmc = 3931889 | volume=51 | issue = 3 | pages=409–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Guar grows well in semiarid areas, but frequent rainfall is necessary.

This legume is a valuable plant in a crop rotation cycle, as it lives in symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.&lt;ref name=Undersander&gt;Undersander D.J., Putnam D.H., Kaminski A.R., Doll J.D., Oblinger E.S. and Gunsolus J.L. 1991. Guar. University of Wisconsin-Madison, University of Minnesota [http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/afcm/guar.html] Accessed November 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Agriculturists in semi-arid regions of Rajasthan follow [[crop rotation|crop-rotation]] and use guar to replenish the soil with essential fertilizers and [[nitrogen fixation]], before the next crop. Guar has many functions for human and animal nutrition, but the gelling agent in its seeds (guar gum) are the most important use.&lt;ref name=Mudgil/&gt; Demand is rising due to the use of guar gum in hydraulic fracturing ([[oil shale gas]]).&lt;ref name=Mudgil/&gt; About 80% of world production occurs in [[India]], but due to strong demand, the plant is being introduced elsewhere.

==Biology==
''Cyamopsis tetragonoloba'' grows upright, reaching a maximum height of up to 2–3 m. 
It has a main single stem with either basal branching or fine branching along the stem. 
Guar taproots can access soil moisture in low soil depths.&lt;ref name=Undersander/&gt; This [[legume]] develops root nodules with nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria [[rhizobia]] in the surface part of its rooting system.
Its leaves and stems are mostly hairy, depending on the cultivar. Its fine leaves have an elongated oval shape (5 to 10&amp;nbsp;cm length) and of alternate position. Clusters of flowers grow in the plant axil and are white to blueish in color. The developing pods are rather flat and slim containing 5 to 12 small oval seeds of 5&amp;nbsp;mm length (TGW = 25-40 g). Usually mature seeds are white or gray, but with excess moisture they can turn black and lose germination capacity. The chromosome number of guar seeds is 2n=14.&lt;ref name=Uni&gt;[http://bibd.uni-giessen.de/gdoc/2000/uni/p000003/guarbohn.htm &quot;Guarbohne (Cyamopsis tetragonolobus &amp;#91;L.&amp;#93; Taub. &amp;#91;=C. psoralioides DC.&amp;#93;)&quot;] Accessed November 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
The seeds of guar beans have a remarkable characteristic. Its kernel consists of a protein-rich germ (43-46%) and a relatively large endosperm (34-40%), containing large amounts of the galactomannan.&lt;ref name=Mudgil/&gt; This is a polysaccharide containing polymers of [[mannose]] and [[galactose]] in a ratio of 2:1 with many branches.&lt;ref name=Garti&gt;Garti N. and Leser M.E 2001. Emulsification properties of hydrocolloids. Polymers for Advanced Technologies 12: 123-135.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it exhibits a great hydrogen bonding activity &lt;ref name=Whistler/&gt; having a viscosifying effect in liquids.

==Cultivation==
===Climate requirements===
Guar is drought-tolerant and sun-loving, but it is susceptible to frost.&lt;ref name=Whistler/&gt; Although it can cope with little but regular rainfall, it requires sufficient soil moisture before planting and during maturation of seeds.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson E. 1949. Endosperm mucilages of legumes: occurrences and composition. Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research 41:2887-2890.&lt;/ref&gt; Frequent drought periods can lead to delayed maturation.&lt;ref name=Undersander/&gt; On the contrary, excessive moisture during the early growth phase and after maturation lead to lower seed quality.&lt;ref name=Whistler/&gt; Guar is also produced near to coastal areas in the Gandhidham region of Kutch, Gujarat, India.

===Soil Requirements===
''Cyamopsis tetragonoloba'' (L.) can grow on a wide range of soil types. Preferably in fertile, medium-textured and sandy [[loam]] soils that are well-drained, since waterlogging decreases plant performance. Guar grows best in moderate alkaline conditions (pH 7-8) and is tolerant of salinity. Its taproots are inoculated with rhizobia nodules, thus it produces nitrogen-rich biomass and improves soil quality.&lt;ref name=Undersander/&gt;

===Cultural practices===

===Cultivation Areas===
Guar is grown principally in north-western India and Pakistan&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.midwestherbs.com/herbs/guargum.htm&quot; Guar Gum&quot;. Midwest Herbs]&lt;/ref&gt; with smaller crops grown in the semiarid areas of the high plains of Texas in the [[United States|US]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://juniper.tamu.edu/Agronomy/guar_production.htm &quot;Guar Production&quot;] Vernon Agricultural Research &amp; Extension Center, Texas A&amp;M Univ. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia and Africa. The most important growing area centres on Jodhpur in Rajasthan, India where demand for guar for fractionation produced an agricultural boom as in 2012.&lt;ref name=NYT71612&gt;{{cite news|title=In Tiny Bean, India's Dirt-Poor Farmers Strike Gas-Drilling Gold|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/17/world/asia/fracking-in-us-lifts-guar-farmers-in-india.html|accessdate=July 17, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 16, 2012|author=Gardiner Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Currently, India is the main producers of cluster bean, accounting for 80% production of the world's total, while Rajasthan, Gujarat, Kutch region occupies the largest area (82.1%) under guar cultivation in the country. In addition to its cultivation in India, the crop is also grown as a cash crop in other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pathak | first1 = R. | last2 = Singh | first2 = S.

===Varieties===
Pusa Naubahar and Pusa Sadabahar. Seeds at the rate of 30 kilograms/hectare (9–11&amp;nbsp;lb/acre) are planted at a spacing of 45-60 x 20–30&amp;nbsp;cm (18–24 x 8–12 in) in February–March and June–July. During the rainy season, seeds are sown 2–3&amp;nbsp;cm (~1 in) deep on ridges and in furrows during summer months. FYM is applied at the rate of 25 tonnes/ha (11.1 tons/acre). N, P2O5 and K2O recommendation for the crop is 20:60:80&amp;nbsp;kg/ha (18:53:71&amp;nbsp;lb/acre). Average yield is 5 to 6 tonnes/ha (2.2–2.6 tons/acre).

==Uses==

===Guar plant===
Agriculture
* [[Forage]]: Guar plants can be used as cattle feed, but due to hydrocyanic acid in its beans, only mature beans can be used.&lt;ref name=Whistler/&gt;
* [[Green manure]]: Guar plantings increase the yield of subsequent crops as this legume conserves soil nutrient content.&lt;ref name=Whistler/&gt;

Domestic use
* [[Vegetable]]: Guar leaves can be used like spinach, and the pods are prepared like salad or vegetables.&lt;ref name=Uni/&gt; Its beans are nutritious, but guar protein is not usable by humans unless toasted to destroy the [[trypsin inhibitor]].

===Guar gum===
{{Main|Guar gum}}
The seeds of the guar bean contain a large endosperm. This endosperm consists of a large polysaccharide of galactose and mannose. This polymer is water-soluble and exhibits a viscosifying effect in water. Guar gum has a multitude of different applications in food products, industrial products, and extractive industry.

====Food====
In several food and beverages guar gum is used as additive to change its viscosity or as fiber source.

'''Partially hydrolyzed guar gum''' (PHGG) is produced by the partial enzymatic [[hydrolysis]] of guaran, the [[galactomannan]] of the endosperm of guar seeds ([[guar gum]]). It is a neutral [[polysaccharide]] consisting of a [[mannose]] backbone chain with single [[galactose]] side units occurring on almost two out of every three mannose units. The average [[molecular weight]] is about 25,000 [[Atomic mass unit|Daltons]]. This gives a PHGG that still assays and functions as a soluble dietary fiber.

PHGG as sold commercially is completely soluble, acid and heat stable, unaffected by ions, and will not gel at high concentrations. Commercial PHGG is approximately 75% dietary fiber and has minimal effect on taste and texture in food and beverage items. PHGG is fully fermentable in the large bowel, with a high rate of volatile fatty acid formation. The pH of the feces is lowered along with an increase in fecal bulk that mainly consists of bacterial cell mass and water. Clinical studies have demonstrated a [[prebiotic (nutrition)|prebiotic]] effect of PHGG. Studies have shown that PHGG can be used to maintain regularity. PHGG is used in foods for particulate suspension, emulsification, anti[[staling]], ice crystal control, and reduced fat baked goods.

====Industry====
Derivatives of guar gum that have been further reacted are used in industrial applications, such as the paper and textile industries, ore flotation, the manufacture of explosives and [[hydraulic fracturing]] (fracking) of oil and gas formations.&lt;ref name=NYT71612/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/17/world/asia/fracking-in-us-lifts-guar-farmers-in-india.html?smid=go-share NY Times]&lt;/ref&gt; Guar gum is often crosslinked with boron or chromium ions to make it more stable and heat-resistant. The crosslinking of guar with metal ions results in a gel that does not block the formation and helps efficiently in formation cleaning process. 
Guar and its derivatives make gel complexes with ions of Aluminium, Zirconium, Titanium, Chromium and Boron.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guar derivatives in Fracturing Fluids&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chemtotal.com/guar-gum-derivatives-as-fracturing-fluids.html |title=Guar gum derivatives |publisher=Chemtotal |accessdate=3 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225174108/http://www.chemtotal.com/guar-gum-derivatives-as-fracturing-fluids.html |archive-date=25 February 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The borate&amp;ndash;guar reaction is reversible, and depends on the pH (hydrogen ion concentration) of the solution. Crosslinking of guar with borate occurs at high pH (approximately 9&amp;ndash;10) of the solution. Guar gum has proven as useful substitute for [[locust bean gum]] (made from [[carob]] seeds).

====Feeds====
Guar meal korma and Guar meal Churi are widely used as raw material for Producing various kinds of Cattle feeds, Aqua feeds, Fish feeds, Poultry Feeds, Dairy feeds, Swine feeds etc.

====Fracking agent====
The use of guar gum in the [[hydraulic fracturing]] (fracking) extraction of oil and shale gas has increased demand substantially. Only 10% of Indian production is used domestically. The remaining 90% is exported for shale gas and oil industries. Consequently, many former cotton or wheat fields are converted into guar fields as production costs are lower. The increase of guar gum prices also has other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.downtoearth.org.in/content/guar-mine] Accessed November 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;!--But since prices are lower the farmers stop harvesting the Guar and returned to cotton &amp; cumin and sesame crops sowing.  &lt;&lt;  ??  --&gt;

'''''Lady Audley's Secret''''' is a [[sensation novel]] by [[Mary Elizabeth Braddon]] published in 1862.&lt;ref name=sutherland&gt;[[John Sutherland (author)|John Sutherland]]. &quot;Lady Audley's Secret&quot; in ''The Stanford Companion to Victorian Fiction'', 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Braddon's most successful and well-known novel. Critic [[John Sutherland (author)|John Sutherland]] (1989) described the work as &quot;the most sensationally successful of all the sensation novels&quot;.&lt;ref name=sutherland/&gt; The plot centres on &quot;accidental [[bigamy]]&quot; which was in literary fashion in the early 1860s.&lt;ref name=sutherland/&gt; The plot was summarised by literary critic [[Elaine Showalter]] (1982): &quot;Braddon's bigamous heroine deserts her child, pushes husband number one down a well, thinks about poisoning husband number two and sets fire to a hotel in which her other male acquaintances are residing&quot;.&lt;ref name=sutherland2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Elaine Showalter]] (1977). ''Literature of Their Own: British Women Novelists from Brontė to Lessing'', p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of the novel mirror themes of the real-life [[Constance Kent case]] of June 1860 which gripped the nation for years.&lt;ref name=summerscale&gt;{{cite book | author=Summerscale, Kate | title=The Suspicions of Mr Whicher, Or the murder at Road Hill House | publisher=Bloomsbury | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-7475-8215-1 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780747582151 }}. Ppg. 217-18&lt;/ref&gt; A follow-up novel, ''[[Aurora Floyd]]'', appeared in 1863. Braddon set the story in [[Ingatestone Hall]], Essex, inspired by a visit there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.blackmorehistory.co.uk/ingatestone.html |title=History of Ingatestone, Essex |access-date=30 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115080048/http://www.blackmorehistory.co.uk/ingatestone.html |archive-date=15 November 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been three silent film adaptations, one UK television version in 2000, and three minor stage adaptations.

==History==
''Lady Audley's Secret'' was partly serialised in ''[[Robin Goodfellow (magazine)|Robin Goodfellow]]'' magazine July–September 1861, then entirely serialised in ''[[Sixpenny Magazine]]'' January–December 1862 and once again serialised in ''[[London Journal]]'' March–August 1863. It was published in 1862 in [[Three-volume novel|three volumes]] by [[William Tinsley (publisher)|William Tinsley]].&lt;ref name=sutherland2/&gt;

Braddon initially sold the rights to the Irish publisher [[John Maxwell (1824–1895)|John Maxwell]], with whom Braddon also lived and had children. Maxwell published it in his ailing magazine ''Robin Goodfellow'', but Braddon did not labour much, writing the final third in less than two weeks. Not until it was published as a three-volume novel by William Tinsley did it become a success and allow Braddon to be financially independent for the remainder of her life. It also enriched her publisher William Tinsley, who went on to build a [[villa]] at Barnes, &quot;Audley Lodge&quot;, with the profits.&lt;ref name=sutherland2&gt;[[John Sutherland (author)|John Sutherland]]. &quot;Braddon&quot; in ''The Stanford Companion to Victorian Fiction'', 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably – given the theme of bigamy in the novel's plot – Maxwell himself was married to another woman, and so Braddon was unable to marry him until his wife died in 1874. When it became public that Maxwell and Braddon had been living in an &quot;irregular&quot; arrangement all those years, it caused a minor scandal during which all their servants [[wikt:give notice|gave notice]].&lt;ref name=sutherland2/&gt;

== Plot ==
The novel opens with the marriage in June 1857, of Lucy Graham, a beautiful, childlike blonde who enchants almost all who meet her, to Sir Michael Audley, a middle-aged, rich, and kind widower. Lucy was a governess for the local doctor, Mr. Dawson, until her marriage. Previous to that Lucy was in service with Mrs. Vincent, but very little is known about her past before this. Around the time of the marriage, Sir Michael's nephew, the barrister Robert Audley, welcomes his old friend George Talboys back to England, after three years of gold prospecting in Australia.

George is anxious to get news of his wife, Helen, whom he left three years ago when their financial situation became desperate, to seek gold in Australia. He reads in the newspaper that she has died, and, after visiting her home to confirm this, he becomes despondent. Robert Audley cares for his friend, and, hoping to distract him, offers to take him to his wealthy uncle's country manor. George had a child, Georgey, who was left under the care of Lieutenant Maldon, George's father-in-law. Robert and George set off to visit Georgey, and George decides to make Robert little Georgey's guardian and trustee of £20,000 put into the boy's name. After settling the matter of the boy's guardianship, the two set off to visit Sir Michael.

While at the country manor Audley Court, Lady Audley avoids meeting George. When the two seek an audience with the new Lady Audley, she makes many excuses to avoid their visit, but he and Robert are shown a portrait of her by Alicia Audley, Robert's cousin. George appears greatly struck by the portrait, unbeknownst to Robert (who credits the unfavourable reaction to that evening's storm). Shortly thereafter, George disappears during a visit to Audley Court, much to Robert's consternation. Unwilling to believe that George has simply left suddenly and without notice, Robert begins to look into the circumstances around the strange disappearance.

While searching for his friend, Robert begins to take notes of the events as they unfold. His notes indicate the involvement of Lady Audley, much to his chagrin, and he slowly begins to collect evidence against her. One night, he reveals the evidence and notes that George was in possession of many letters that his former wife wrote. Lady Audley immediately sets off to London, where the letters were kept, and Robert follows after her. However, by the time he arrives, he discovers that George's possessions have been broken into with the help of a local locksmith and that the letters have vanished. One possession, however, remains – a book with a note written by George's wife that matches Lady Audley's handwriting. This confirms Robert's suspicion that Lady Audley is implicated in George's disappearance; it also leads Robert to conclude that Lady Audley is actually George's supposedly dead wife.

Suspecting the worst of Lady Audley and being afraid for little Georgey's life, Robert travels to Lieutenant Maldon's house and demands possession of the boy. Once Robert has Georgey under his control, he places the boy in a school run by Mr. Marchmont. Afterwards, Robert visits George's father, Mr. Harcourt Talboys, and confronts the Squire with his son's death. Mr. Harcourt listens dispassionately to the story. In the course of his visit to the Talboys' manor, Robert is entranced by George's sister Clara, who looks startlingly like George. Clara's passion for finding her brother spurs Robert on.

In February 1859, Robert continues searching for evidence. He receives a notice that his uncle is ill, and he quickly returns to Audley Court. While there, Robert speaks with Mr. Dawson and receives a brief description of all that is known about Lucy's background. He hears that Lucy was employed by Mrs. Vincent at her school since 1852, and, to verify this claim, Robert tracks down Mrs. Vincent, who is in hiding because of debts. According to Miss Tonks, a teacher at Mrs. Vincent's school, Lucy actually arrived at the school in August 1854 and was secretive about her past. Miss Tonks gives Robert a travel box that used to belong to Lucy, and upon examining stickers on the box, Robert discovers both the name Lucy Graham and the name Helen Talboys.

Robert realises that Helen Talboys faked her death before creating her new identity. When Robert confronts Lucy, she tells him that he has no proof, and he leaves to find more evidence, heading to Castle Inn, which is run by Luke Marks. During the night, Lucy forces Luke's wife Phoebe to let her into the inn and Lucy sets the place on fire, with the intention of killing Robert. However, Robert survives and returns to Audley Court and again confronts Lucy. This time, she says she is insane and confesses her life's story to Robert and Sir Michael, claiming that George abandoned her originally and she had no choice but to abandon her old life and child to find another, wealthier husband.

Sir Michael is unhappy and leaves with Alicia to travel through Europe. Robert invites a Dr. Mosgrave to make a more astute judgment regarding Lucy's sanity, and he proclaims that she is indeed victim to latent insanity, which overpowers her in times of stress and makes her very dangerous to any and all. Lucy, under the name of Madame Taylor, enters a mental institution located somewhere in Belgium along the route between Brussels and Paris. While being committed, Lucy confesses to Robert that she killed George by pushing him down a deserted well in the garden of Audley Court.

Robert grieves for his friend George until Luke Marks, who was fatally injured in the fire, manages, before dying, to tell Robert that George survived Lady Audley's attempted murder and that George, with Luke's help, left intending to return to Australia. Robert is overjoyed, and he asks Clara to marry him and go with him to Australia to find George. Clara accepts, but before they set out, George returns and reveals that he actually visited New York instead. The narrative ends with the death of Lucy abroad, and Clara and Robert happily married and living in a country cottage with George and his son. Robert's formerly infatuated cousin Alicia marries her once-spurned suitor, Sir Harry Towers, and Audley Court is left abandoned along with all of its unhappy memories.

== Analysis and themes ==
''Lady Audley's Secret'' plays on [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] anxieties about the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]]. The home was supposed to be a refuge from the dangers of the outside world, but in the novel, the seemingly perfect domestic lady turns out to be a violent criminal who has not only tried to commit murder but who has also committed bigamy and abandoned her child. This unsettled Victorian readers because it indicated that the concepts of &quot;the perfect lady/mother&quot; and &quot;domestic bliss&quot; were more idealistic than realistic. In addition, anxieties about the increasing urbanisation of Britain abound; the city gives Lady Audley the power to change her identity because it renders its citizens effectively anonymous. The small town of Audley is no longer a refuge where everyone knows the life story of every neighbour; the residents of Audley must accept Lucy Graham's account of herself since they have no other information about her past. Other anxieties about unstable identity appear throughout the novel: Lady Audley's maid, Phoebe, resembles Lady Audley, thus banishing the idea of physical distinction between the upper and lower classes and therefore of any inherent superiority of the former.

''Lady Audley's Secret'' is, furthermore, a story about gender and class, and Lady Audley's objectionable upward mobility suggests a threat to the paradigm of social class. Madness is also a key issue. Lady Audley and others often converse about the meaning of this word, but many readers believe that Lady Audley is not mad. In fact, many critics view Lady Audley's deception as a feminist act in which a woman takes control of the direction of her own life.&lt;ref&gt;See Jennifer M.

A time of relative quiet descended thereafter on the western Transvaal. February 1902 saw the next major battle in that region. On 25 February, [[Koos De La Rey]] attacked a British column under Lieutenant-Colonel [[Stanley Brenton von Donop|S. B. von Donop]] at Ysterspruit near [[Wolmaransstad]]. De La Rey succeeded in capturing many men and a large amount of ammunition. The Boer attacks prompted Lord Methuen, the British second-in-command after [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], to move his column from Vryburg to Klerksdorp to deal with De La Rey. On the morning of 7 March 1902, the Boers attacked the rear guard of Methuen's moving column at [[Battle of Tweebosch|Tweebosch]]. Confusion reigned in British ranks and Methuen was wounded and captured by the Boers.

The Boer victories in the west led to stronger action by the British. In the second half of March 1902, large British reinforcements were sent to the Western Transvaal under the direction of Ian Hamilton. The opportunity the British were waiting for arose on 11 April 1902 at [[Battle of Rooiwal|Rooiwal]], where a commando led by General [[Jan Kemp (South African)|Jan Kemp]] and Commandant Potgieter attacked a superior force under Kekewich. The British soldiers were well positioned on the hillside and inflicted severe casualties on the Boers charging on horseback over a large distance, beating them back. This was the end of the war in the Western Transvaal and also the last major battle of the war.

=== Eastern Transvaal ===
[[File:Afrikaner Commandos2.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Boer Commando|Boer commandos]]]]
Two Boer forces fought in this area, one under Botha in the south east and a second under Ben Viljoen in the north east around Lydenburg. Botha's forces were particularly active, raiding railways and British supply convoys, and even mounting a renewed invasion of Natal in September 1901. After defeating British mounted infantry in the [[Battle of Blood River Poort]] near [[Dundee, KwaZulu-Natal|Dundee]], Botha was forced to withdraw by heavy rains that made movement difficult and crippled his horses. Back on the Transvaal territory around his home district of Vryheid, Botha attacked a British raiding column at [[Battle of Bakenlaagte|Bakenlaagte]], using an effective mounted charge. One of the most active British units was effectively destroyed in this engagement. This made Botha's forces the target of increasingly large and ruthless drives by British forces, in which the British made particular use of native scouts and informers. Eventually, Botha had to abandon the high veld and retreat to a narrow enclave bordering [[Swaziland]].

To the north, Ben Viljoen grew steadily less active. His forces mounted comparatively few attacks and as a result, the Boer enclave around [[Lydenburg]] was largely unmolested. Viljoen was eventually captured.

=== Cape Colony ===
In parts of Cape Colony, particularly the Cape Midlands district where Boers formed a majority of the white inhabitants, the British had always feared a general uprising against them. In fact, no such uprising took place, even in the early days of the war when Boer armies had advanced across the Orange. The cautious conduct of some of the elderly Orange Free State generals had been one factor that discouraged the Cape Boers from siding with the Boer republics. Nevertheless, there was widespread pro-Boer sympathy.  Some of the Cape Dutch volunteered to help the British, but a much larger number volunteered to help the other side. The political factor was more important than the military: the Cape Dutch controlled the provincial legislature. Milner said 90 percent favoured the rebels.{{sfn|Marsh|1994|pages=483–85}}

After he escaped across the Orange in March 1901, [[Christiaan de Wet]] had left forces under Cape rebels [[Pieter Hendrik Kritzinger|Kritzinger]] and Scheepers to maintain a guerrilla campaign in the Cape Midlands. The campaign here was one of the least chivalrous of the war, with intimidation by both sides of each other's civilian sympathizers. In one of many skirmishes, Commandant Lotter's small commando was tracked down by a much-superior British column and wiped out at [[Battle of Groenkloof|Groenkloof]]. Several captured rebels, including Lotter and Scheepers, who was captured when he fell ill with appendicitis, were executed by the British for treason or for capital crimes such as the murder of prisoners or of unarmed civilians. Some of the executions took place in public, to deter further disaffection. Since the Cape Colony was Imperial territory, its authorities forbade the British Army to burn farms or to force Boers into concentration camps.

Fresh Boer forces under [[Jan Christiaan Smuts]], joined by the surviving rebels under Kritzinger, made another attack on the Cape in September 1901. They suffered severe hardships and were hard pressed by British columns, but eventually rescued themselves by routing some of their pursuers at the [[Battle of Elands River (1901)|Battle of Elands River]] and capturing their equipment. From then until the end of the war, Smuts increased his forces from among Cape rebels until they numbered 3,000. However, no general uprising took place, and the situation in the Cape remained stalemated.

In January 1902, Boer leader [[Manie Maritz]] was implicated in the [[Leliefontein massacre]] in the far [[Northern Cape]].

=== Boer foreign volunteers ===
{{Main|Boer foreign volunteers}}
While no other government actively supported the Boer cause, individuals from several countries volunteered and formed Foreign Volunteer Units. These primarily came from [[Europe]], particularly the [[Netherlands]], [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Union between Sweden and Norway|Sweden-Norway]]. Other countries such as [[French Fourth Republic|France]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Ireland]] (then part of the United Kingdom), and restive areas of the [[Russian Empire]], including [[Poland]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], also formed smaller volunteer corps. Finns fought in the Scandinavian Corps. Two volunteers, [[George Henri Anne-Marie Victor de Villebois-Mareuil]] of France and [[Yevgeny Maximov]] of Russia became ''veggeneraals'' (fighting generals) of the South African Republic.{{sfn|Davidson &amp; Filatova|1998|p=80}}

== Nonwhite roles ==
The policy on both sides was to minimise the role of nonwhites but the need for manpower continuously stretched those resolves.  At the battle of Spion Kop in Ladysmith, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] with 300 free burgher Indians and 800 indentured Indian labourers started the Ambulance Corps serving the British side.  As the war raged across African farms and their homes were destroyed, many became refugees and they, like the Boers, moved to the towns where the British hastily created internment camps. Subsequently, the &quot;Scorched Earth&quot; policy was ruthlessly applied to both Boers and Africans. Although most black Africans were not considered by the British to be hostile, many tens of thousands were also forcibly removed from Boer areas and also placed in concentration camps. Africans were held separately from Boer internees. Eventually there were a total of 64 tented camps for Africans. Conditions were as bad as in the camps for the Boers, but even though, after the Fawcett Commission report, conditions improved in the Boer camps, &quot;improvements were much slower in coming to the black camps.&quot; 20,000 died there.{{sfn|Warwick|1983|p={{page needed|date=February 2017}} }}

About 10,000 black men were attached to Boer units where they performed camp duties; a handful unofficially fought in combat.  The British Army employed over 14,000 Africans as wagon drivers. Even more had combatant roles as spies, guides, and eventually as soldiers. By 1902 there were about 30,000 armed Africans in the British Army.{{sfn|Pretorius|2011|p={{page needed|date=February 2017}} }}

== Concentration camps ==
{{Main|British concentration camps}}
[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-215-94-Derivative01.jpg|thumb|Tents in the [[Bloemfontein]] concentration camp]]

The term &quot;[[concentration camp]]&quot; was used to describe camps operated by the British in South Africa during this conflict in the years 1900–1902, and the term grew in prominence during this period.

The camps had originally been set up by the British Army as &quot;[[refugee camps]]&quot; to provide refuge for civilian families who had been forced to abandon their homes for whatever reason related to the war. However, when Kitchener took over in late 1900, he introduced new tactics in an attempt to break the [[Boer Commando|guerrilla campaign]] and the influx of civilians grew dramatically as a result. Disease and starvation killed thousands.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hasian | first=Marouf | title=The &quot;hysterical&quot; Emily Hobhouse and Boer War concentration camp controversy | journal=Western Journal of Communication | publisher=Informa UK Limited | volume=67 | issue=2 | year=2003 | issn=1057-0314 | doi=10.1080/10570310309374764 | pages=138–163| s2cid=152156450 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/black-concentration-camps-during-anglo-boer-war-2-1900-1902|title=Black Concentration Camps during the Anglo-Boer War 2, 1900–1902|date=2011-03-21|website=South African History Online|language=en|access-date=2019-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kitchener initiated plans to

&lt;blockquote&gt;flush out guerrillas in a series of systematic drives, organised like a sporting shoot, with success defined in a weekly 'bag' of killed, captured and wounded, and to sweep the country bare of everything that could give sustenance to the guerrillas, including women and children&amp;nbsp;... It was the clearance of civilians—uprooting a whole nation—that would come to dominate the last phase of the war.{{sfn|Pakenham|1979|p=493}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:LizzieVanZyl.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lizzie van Zyl]], a [[Boer]] child, visited by [[Emily Hobhouse]] in a British [[concentration camp]]]]

As Boer farms were destroyed by the British under their &quot;[[Scorched Earth]]&quot; policy—including the systematic destruction of crops and slaughtering of livestock, the burning down of homesteads and farms —to prevent the Boers from resupplying from a home base, many tens of thousands of women and children were forcibly moved into the concentration camps. This was not the first appearance of internment camps, as the Spanish had used internment in Cuba in the [[Ten Years' War]], but the Boer War concentration camp system was the first time that a whole nation had been systematically targeted, and the first in which whole regions had been depopulated.

Eventually, there were a total of 45 tented camps built for Boer internees and 64 for black Africans. Of the 28,000 Boer men captured as [[prisoners of war]], 25,630 were sent overseas and either freed or enslaved within civil societies. The vast majority of Boers remaining in the local camps were women and children. Over 27,000 women and children were to perish in these concentration camps.{{sfn|Wessels|2010|p=32}}

The camps were poorly administered from the outset and became increasingly overcrowded when Kitchener's troops implemented the internment strategy on a vast scale. Conditions were terrible for the health of the internees, mainly due to neglect, poor hygiene and bad sanitation. The supply of all items was unreliable, partly because of the constant disruption of communication lines by the Boers. The food [[ration]]s were meager and there was a two-tier allocation policy, whereby families of men who were still fighting were routinely given smaller rations than others.{{sfn|Pakenham|1979|p=505}} The inadequate shelter, poor diet, bad hygiene and overcrowding led to malnutrition and endemic contagious diseases such as [[measles]], [[typhoid]], and [[dysentery]], to which the children were particularly vulnerable. {{sfn|Judd|Surridge|2013|p=195}} Coupled with a shortage of modern medical facilities, many of the internees died. [[Emily Hobhouse]] was instrumental in bringing relief to the concentration camps, as well as raising public awareness in Europe of the atrocities.

== The end of the war ==
[[File:Resa del bacino del Brandewater.jpg|thumb|The end result of the Boer War was the [[annexation]] of the [[Boer Republics]] to the British Empire in 1902]]
[[File:Kitchener at the Peace Conference that ended the Second Boer War.png|thumb|Peace conference at Vereeniging]]
[[File:Company C returns from Boer War.jpg|thumb|C Company returns from Boer War, pictured here in [[King Street (Toronto)|King Street]], [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada.]]
Towards the end of the war, British tactics of containment, denial, and harassment began to yield results against the guerrillas. The sourcing and co-ordination of intelligence became increasingly efficient with regular reporting from observers in the blockhouses, from units patrolling the fences and conducting &quot;sweeper&quot; operations, and from native Africans in rural areas who increasingly supplied intelligence, as the Scorched Earth policy took effect and they found themselves competing with the Boers for food supplies. Kitchener's forces at last began to seriously affect the Boers' fighting strength and freedom of manoeuvre, and made it harder for the Boers and their families to survive. Despite this success, almost half the Boer fighting strength, 15,000 men were still in the field fighting. Kitchener's tactics were very costly: Britain was running out of time and money and needed to change tack.{{sfn|O'Brien|1988|p={{page needed|date=February 2017}} }}

The Boers and the British both feared the consequences of arming Africans. The memories of the Zulu and other tribal conflicts were still fresh, and they recognised that whoever won would have to deal with the consequences of a mass militarisation of the tribes. There was therefore an unwritten agreement that this war would be a &quot;white man's war.&quot; At the outset, British officials instructed all white magistrates in the Natal Colony to appeal to Zulu amakhosi (chiefs) to remain neutral, and President Kruger sent emissaries asking them to stay out of it. However, in some cases there were old scores to be settled, and some Africans, such as the [[Swazi people|Swazis]], were eager to enter the war with the specific aim of reclaiming land won by the Boers. As the war went on there was greater involvement of Africans, and in particular large numbers became embroiled in the conflict on the British side, either voluntarily or involuntarily. By the end of the war, many blacks had been armed and had shown conspicuous gallantry in roles such as scouts, messengers, watchmen in blockhouses, and auxiliaries.

And there were more flash-points outside of the war. On 6 May 1902 at [[Battle of Holkrans|Holkrantz]] in the southeastern Transvaal, a Zulu faction had their cattle stolen and their people mistreated by the Boers as a punishment for helping the British. The local Boer officer then sent an insulting message to the tribe, challenging them to take back their cattle. The Zulus attacked at night, and in a mutual bloodbath, the Boers lost 56 killed and 3 wounded, while the Africans suffered 52 killed and 48 wounded.{{sfn|Pakenham|1979|p=601}}

The British offered terms of peace on various occasions, notably in March 1901, but were rejected by Botha and the &quot;Bitter-enders&quot; among the commandos. They pledged to fight until the bitter end and rejected the demand for compromise made by the &quot;Hands-uppers.&quot;  Their reasons included hatred of the British, loyalty to their dead comrades, solidarity with fellow commandos, an intense desire for independence, religious arguments, and fear of captivity or punishment. On the other hand, their women and children were dying every day and independence seemed impossible.{{sfn|Grundlingh|1980|pp=258–78}} The last of the Boers surrendered in May 1902 and the war ended with the [[Treaty of Vereeniging]] signed on 31 May 1902. The British had won and offered generous terms to regain the support of the Boers. The Boers were given £3,000,000 for reconstruction and were promised eventual limited self-government, which was granted in 1906 and 1907. The treaty ended the existence of the [[South African Republic]] and the [[Orange Free State]] as independent Boer republics and placed them within the [[British Empire]]. The [[Union of South Africa]] was established as a [[dominion]] of the [[British Empire]] in 1910.

=== Cost of the war ===
It is estimated that the total cost of the war to the British government was £211,156,000&lt;ref name=&quot;CostofWar&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|''Cost of the war''|loc={{Unreliable source?|date=February 2017}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; (equivalent to £202,000,000,000 in 2014).{{sfn|Measuringworth|2015}}

== Aftermath and analysis ==
[[File:Boer War memorial Quebec City.jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial to soldiers from [[Quebec]] who fell in the Second Boer War, [[Quebec City]]]]
The Second Boer War cast long shadows over the history of the South African region. The predominantly agrarian society of the former [[Boer]] republics was profoundly and fundamentally affected by the [[scorched earth]] policy of Roberts and Kitchener. The devastation of both Boer and black African populations in the concentration camps and through war and exile were to have a lasting effect on the demography and quality of life in the region. Many exiles and prisoners were unable to return to their farms at all; others attempted to do so but were forced to abandon the farms as unworkable given the damage caused by farm burning in the course of the scorched earth policy. Destitute Boers and black Africans swelled the ranks of the unskilled urban poor competing with the &quot;uitlanders&quot; in the mines.{{sfn|Onselen|1982|p={{page needed|date=February 2017}} }}

The postwar reconstruction administration was presided over by [[Lord Milner]] and his largely Oxford trained [[Milner's Kindergarten]]. This small group of civil servants had a profound effect on the region, eventually leading to the [[Union of South Africa]].
{{quote|In the aftermath of the war, an imperial administration freed from accountability to a domestic electorate set about reconstructing an economy that was by then predicated unambiguously on gold. At the same time, British civil servants, municipal officials, and their cultural adjuncts were hard at work in the heartland of the former [[Boer]] Republics helping to forge new identities—first as 'British South Africans' and then, later still, as 'white South Africans'.&quot;}}

Some scholars, for good reasons, identify these new identities as partly underpinning the act of union that followed in 1910. Although challenged by a [[Maritz Rebellion|Boer rebellion]] only four years later, they did much to shape South African politics between the two world wars and right up to the present day&quot;.{{sfn|Onselen|2003|pp=483–526}}

[[File:Lord Milner.jpg|thumb|upright|Alfred, Lord Milner, was the British [[High Commissioner]] of Southern Africa. He was involved from the start of the war and had a role in the peace process and the creation of the [[Union of South Africa]].]]
The counterinsurgency techniques and lessons (the restriction of movement, the containment of space, the ruthless targeting of anything, everything and anyone that could give sustenance to guerrillas, the relentless harassment through sweeper groups coupled with rapid reaction forces, the sourcing and co-ordination of intelligence, and the nurturing of native allies) learned during the Boer War were used by the British (and other forces) in future guerrilla campaigns including to counter [[Federation of Malaya|Malayan]] communist rebels during the [[Malayan Emergency]]. In World War II the British also adopted some of the concepts of raiding from the Boer commandos when, after the [[Battle of France|fall of France]], they set up their special raiding forces, and in acknowledgement of their erstwhile enemies, chose the name [[British Commandos]].

Many of the Boers referred to the war as the second of the ''Freedom Wars''. The most resistant of Boers wanted to continue the fight and were known as &quot;''[[Bittereinder]]s''&quot; (or ''irreconcilables'') and at the end of the war a number of Boer fighters such as [[Deneys Reitz]] chose exile rather than sign an oath, such as the following, to pledge allegiance to Britain:{{sfn|Swardt|1998|p=97}}
{{Quote box|width=50%|align=none|quote=The bearer, ''&amp;lt;prisoner name&amp;gt;'' has been released from prison of war camp ''&amp;lt;Camp name&amp;gt;'' on signing that he acknowledge terms of surrender and becomes a British subject.
}}
Over the following decade, many returned to South Africa and never signed the pledge. Some, like Reitz, eventually reconciled themselves to the new ''status quo'', but others could not.

=== Union of South Africa ===
{{Main|Union of South Africa}}
One of the most important events in the decade after the end of the war was the creation of the [[Union of South Africa]] (later the [[Republic of South Africa]]). It proved a key ally to Britain as a [[British Dominions|Dominion]] of the [[British Empire]] during the World Wars. At the start of the First World War a crisis ensued when the South African government led by [[Louis Botha]] and other former Boer fighters, such as [[Jan Smuts]], declared support for Britain and agreed to send troops to take over the German colony of [[German South-West Africa]] (Namibia).

Many Boers were opposed to fighting for Britain, especially against Germany, which had been sympathetic to their struggle. A number of ''bittereinders'' and their allies took part in a revolt known as the [[Maritz Rebellion]]. This was quickly suppressed, and in 1916 the leading Boer rebels in the Maritz Rebellion escaped lightly (especially compared with the fate of leading Irish rebels of the [[Easter Rising#Arrests and executions|Easter Rising]]), with terms of imprisonment of six and seven years and heavy fines. Two years later, they were released from prison, as Louis Botha recognised the value of reconciliation. Thereafter the ''bittereinders'' concentrated on political organisation within the constitutional system and built up what later became the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], which took power in 1948 and dominated the politics of South Africa from the late 1940s until the early 1990s, under the [[apartheid]] system.

Much of the Irish public sympathised with the Boer side, rather than the British side on which fought the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1684–1922)|Royal Irish Regiment]].]]
Many [[Irish nationalist]]s sympathised with the Boers, viewing them to be a people oppressed by British [[imperialism]], much like themselves. Irish miners already in the Transvaal at the start of the war formed the nucleus of two [[Irish commandos]]. The Second Irish Brigade was headed up by an Australian of Irish parents, Colonel [[Arthur Lynch (politician)|Arthur Lynch]]. In addition, small groups of Irish volunteers went to South Africa to fight with the Boers—this despite the fact that there were many Irish troops fighting in the British army, including the [[Royal Dublin Fusiliers]].{{efn|&quot;Although some 30,000 Irishmen served in the British Army under Irish General Lord Frederick Roberts, who had been Commander of Chief of British Forces in Ireland prior to his transfer to South Africa, some historians argue that the sympathies of many of their compatriots lay with the Boers. Nationalist-controlled local authorities passed pro-Boer resolutions and there were proposals to confer civic honours on Boer leader, Paul Kruger.&quot; (Irish Ambassador Daniel Mulhall [http://www.promuda-prodigy.com/archives/000083.html written] for ''History Ireland'', 2004.)}} In Britain, the &quot;Pro-Boer&quot; campaign expanded,{{efn|[[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] and [[Keir Hardie]] were members of the [[Stop the War Committee]] (See the founder's biography: [http://www.attackingthedevil.co.uk/worksabout/bairns.php William T. Stead's].) Many British authors gave their &quot;Pro-Boer&quot; opinions in British press, such as [[G. K. Chesterton]]'s writing to 1905 – (see [[Rice University]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20000605083501/http://www.cs.rice.edu:80/~ssiyer/minstrels/poems/228.html Chesterton's poetry analysis)]}} with writers often idealising the Boer society.

The war also highlighted the dangers of Britain's policy of non-alignment and deepened her isolation. The [[1900 United Kingdom general election|1900 UK general election]], also known as the &quot;[[Khaki election]]&quot;, was called by the Prime Minister, [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], on the back of recent British victories. There was much enthusiasm for the war at this point, resulting in a victory for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government.

However, public support quickly waned as it became apparent that the war would not be easy and it dragged on, partially contributing to [[1906 United Kingdom general election|the Conservatives' spectacular defeat in 1906]]. There was public outrage at the use of scorched earth tactics and at the conditions in the concentration camps. It also became apparent that there were serious problems with public health in Britain since up to 40% of recruits in Britain were unfit for [[conscription|military service]] and suffered from medical problems such as [[rickets]] and other poverty-related illnesses. That came at a time of increasing concern for the state of the poor in Britain.

Having taken the country into a prolonged war, the Conservative government was rejected by the electorate at the first general election after the war was over.  Balfour succeeded his uncle, Lord Salisbury in 1903, immediately after the war, took over a Conservative Party that had won two successive landslide majorities but led it to a landslide defeat in 1906.

=== Horses ===
[[File:Horses on board ship - a guide to their management-page69.jpg|thumb|A horse destined to serve in the war, being off-loaded in [[Port Elizabeth]]]]
The number of horses killed in the war was at the time unprecedented in modern warfare. For example, in the [[Siege of Kimberley|Relief of Kimberley]], French's cavalry rode 500 horses to their deaths in a single day. The wastage was particularly heavy among British forces for several reasons: overloading of horses with unnecessary equipment and saddlery, failure to rest and acclimatise horses after long sea voyages and, later in the war, poor management by inexperienced mounted troops and distant control by unsympathetic staffs.{{sfn|McElwee|1974|pp=223–29}} The average life expectancy of a British horse, from the time of its arrival in Port Elizabeth, was around six weeks.{{sfn|Hayes|1902|pp=213–14}}

Horses were slaughtered for their meat when needed. During the [[Siege of Kimberley]] and [[Siege of Ladysmith]], horses were consumed as food once the regular sources of meat were depleted.{{sfn|Davis|1900|p=34}} The besieged British forces in Ladysmith also produced ''chevril'', a [[Bovril]]-like paste, by [[boiling down]] the horse meat to a jelly paste and serving it like beef tea.{{sfn|Watt|1982}}{{sfn|Jacson|1908|p=88}}

The [[Horse Memorial]] in Port Elizabeth is a tribute to the 300,000 horses that died during the conflict.{{sfn|Pocock|1917|p=viii fn. 11}}

[[File:Gandhi Boer War.jpg|thumb|right|Stretcher-bearers of the Indian Ambulance Corps during the war, including the future leader [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] (Middle row, 5th from left)]]
The vast majority of troops fighting for the British army came from Great Britain. Yet a significant number came from other parts of the [[British Empire]]. These countries had their own internal disputes over whether they should remain tied to London, or have full independence, which carried over into the debate around the sending of forces to assist the war. Though not fully independent on foreign affairs, these countries did have local say over how much support to provide, and the manner it was provided. Ultimately, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and British South African Company-administered Rhodesia all sent volunteers to aid the United Kingdom. Canada provided the largest number of troops, followed by Australia. Troops were also raised to fight with the British from the [[Cape Colony]] and the [[Colony of Natal]]. Some Boer fighters, such as [[Jan Smuts]] and Louis Botha, were technically British subjects as they came from the Cape Colony and Colony of Natal, respectively.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

There were also many volunteers from the Empire who were not selected for the official contingents from their countries and travelled privately to South Africa to form private units, such as the Canadian Scouts and Doyle's Australian Scouts. There were also some European volunteer units from [[British Raj|British India]] and [[British Ceylon]], though the British Government refused offers of non-white troops from the Empire. Some [[Cape Coloureds]] also volunteered early in the war, but later some of them were effectively conscripted and kept in segregated units. As a community, they received comparatively little reward for their services. In many ways, the war set the pattern for the Empire's later involvement in the two [[World war|World Wars]]. Specially raised units, consisting mainly of volunteers, were dispatched overseas to serve with forces from elsewhere in the British Empire.

The United States stayed neutral in the conflict, but some American citizens were eager to participate. Early in the war Lord Roberts cabled the American [[Frederick Russell Burnham]], a veteran of both Matabele wars but at that very moment prospecting in the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Klondike]], to serve on his personal staff as Chief of Scouts. Burnham went on to receive the highest awards of any American who served in the war, but American mercenaries participated on both sides.{{sfn|Farwell|1976}}

From 1899 to 1901 the six separate [[self-governing colony|self-governing colonies]] in Australia sent their own contingents to serve in the Boer War. That much of the population of the colonies had originated from [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] explains a general desire to support Britain during the conflict. After the colonies formed the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] in 1901, the new [[Government of Australia]] sent &quot;Commonwealth&quot; contingents to the war.{{sfn|Wilcox|2002|p={{page needed|date=August 2019}} }} The Boer War was thus the first war in which the Commonwealth of Australia fought. A few Australians fought on the Boer side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/atwar/boer.htm|title=Boer War}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous and colourful character was Colonel [[Arthur Alfred Lynch]], formerly of [[Ballarat]], Victoria, who raised the Second Irish Brigade.

The Australian [[Climate of Australia|climate]] and [[Geography of Australia|geography]] were far closer to that of South Africa than most other parts of the empire, so Australians adapted quickly to the environment, with troops serving mostly among the army's &quot;mounted rifles.&quot; Enlistment in all official Australian contingents totalled 16,463.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Australian War Memorial |year=2008|title=Australian Military Statistics|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/atwar/statistics/1885_1973.asp|publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another five to seven thousand Australians served in &quot;irregular&quot; regiments raised in South Africa. Perhaps five hundred Australian irregulars were killed. In total 20,000 or more Australians served and about 1,000 were killed. A total of 267 died from disease, 251 were killed in action or died from wounds sustained in battle. A further 43 men were reported missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Australian War Memorial |year=2008|title=Australia and the Boer War, 1899–1902|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/atwar/boer.asp|publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the war began some Australians, like some Britons, opposed it. As the war dragged on some Australians became disenchanted, in part because of the sufferings of Boer civilians reported in the press. In an interesting twist (for Australians), when the British missed capturing President Paul Kruger, as he escaped Pretoria during its fall in June 1900, a ''[[Melbourne Punch]]'', 21 June 1900, cartoon depicted how the War could be won, using the [[Kelly Gang]].{{sfn|Wilcox|2002|p=103}}

The convictions and executions of two Australian lieutenants, [[Breaker Morant|Harry Harbord Morant]], colloquially known as 'The Breaker' for his skill with horses, and [[Peter Handcock]] in 1902, and the imprisonment of a third, [[George Witton]], had little impact on the Australian public at the time despite later legend. The controversial [[court-martial]] saw the three convicted of executing [[Boer]] prisoners under their authority. After the war, though, Australians joined an empire-wide campaign that saw Witton released from jail. Much later, some Australians came to see the execution of Morant and Handcock as instances of wrongfully executed Australians, as illustrated in the 1980 Australian film [[Breaker Morant (film)|''Breaker Morant'']].

Over 7,000 Canadian soldiers and support personnel were involved in the second Boer war from October 1899 to May 1902.{{sfn|Webb|2010|pp=75–90}} With approximately 7,368&lt;ref name=&quot;Boer War Remembered&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Marshall|first=Robert|title=Boer War Remembered|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/macleans/boer-war-remembered|work=Maclean's}}&lt;/ref&gt; soldiers in a combat situation, the conflict became the largest military engagement involving Canadian soldiers from the time of Confederation until the [[Great War]].{{sfn|Webb|2010|pp=75–90}} Eventually, 270 of these soldiers died in the course of the Boer War.{{sfn|Webb|2010|pp=75–90}}

The Canadian public was initially divided on the decision to go to war as some citizens did not want Canada to become Britain's 'tool' for engaging in armed conflicts. Many [[English Canadian|Anglophone]] citizens were pro-[[Empire]], and wanted the [[Prime Minister]], [[Sir Wilfrid Laurier]], to support the British in their conflict. On the other hand, many [[Francophone]] citizens felt threatened by the continuation of British [[imperialism]] to their national [[sovereignty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;South African War&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Miller|first=Carman|title=South African War|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/south-african-war|encyclopedia=Canadian Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Delivery days====

From 1810, mail was delivered seven days a week. In 1828, local religious leaders noticed a decline in Sunday-morning church attendance because of local post offices' doubling as gathering places. These leaders appealed to the government to intervene and close post offices on Sundays. The government, however, declined, and mail was delivered 7 days a week until 1912.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://atheism.about.com/b/a/242048.htm About.com, &quot;Sunday Mail Service in a Christian Nation&quot;, Austin Cline, February 19, 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906100319/http://atheism.about.com/b/a/242048.htm |date=September 6, 2008 }}.

Saturday delivery was temporarily suspended in April 1957, because of lack of funds, but quickly restored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onthisday.com/events/april/13 Historyorb.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102035351/http://www.onthisday.com/events/april/13 |date=2016-01-02 }}, events April 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onthisday.com/events/april/15 Historyorb.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102035351/http://www.onthisday.com/events/april/15 |date=2016-01-02 }}, events April 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Budget problems prompted consideration of dropping Saturday delivery starting around 2009. This culminated in a 2013 announcement that regular mail services would be cut to five days a week, which was reversed by Congress before it could take effect. (See the section [[#Revenue decline and planned cuts|Revenue decline and planned cuts]].)

====Direct delivery vs. customer pickup====

Originally, mail was not delivered to homes and businesses, but to post offices. In 1863, &quot;city delivery&quot; began in urban areas with enough customers to make this economical. This required streets to be named, houses to be numbered, with sidewalks and lighting provided, and these street addresses to be added to envelopes.&lt;ref name=&quot;city delivery&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=City Delivery |website=Postal History |publisher=USPS |url=http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/city-delivery.pdf |access-date=2016-01-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305100057/http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/city-delivery.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-05 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of routes served expanded over time. In 1891, the first experiments with [[Rural Free Delivery]] began in less densely populated areas. There is currently an effort to reduce direct delivery in favor of mailbox clusters.

To compensate for high mail volume and slow long-distance transportation which saw mail arrive at post offices throughout the day, deliveries were made multiple times a day. This ranged from twice for residential areas to up to seven times for the central business district of [[Brooklyn]], New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;deliveries per day&quot;&gt;[http://www.usps.com/postalhistory/_pdf/DeliveriesperDay.pdf Deliveries per Day] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509022313/http://www.usps.com/postalhistory/_pdf/DeliveriesperDay.pdf |date=May 9, 2009 }}. (PDF) . Retrieved on July 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century, mail boxes were encouraged, saving carriers the time it took to deliver directly to the addressee in person; in the 1910s and 1920s, they were phased in as a requirement for service.&lt;ref name=&quot;city delivery&quot;/&gt; In the 1940s, multiple daily deliveries began to be reduced, especially on Saturdays. By 1990, the last twice-daily deliveries in New York City were eliminated.

Today, mail is delivered once a day on-site to most private homes and businesses. The USPS still distinguishes between city delivery (where carriers generally walk and deliver to mailboxes hung on exterior walls or porches, or to commercial reception areas) and rural delivery (where carriers generally drive).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usps.com/receive/businesssolutions/cityruralandgeneraldelivery.htm?from=receiveyourmail&amp;page=homedelivery Home Delivery]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723225613/http://www.usps.com/receive/businesssolutions/cityruralandgeneraldelivery.htm?from=receiveyourmail&amp;page=homedelivery |date=July 23, 2011 }}.

Some customers choose to use [[post office box]]es for an additional fee, for privacy or convenience. This provides a locked box at the post office to which mail is addressed and delivered (usually earlier in the day than home delivery). Customers in less densely populated areas where there is no city delivery and who do not qualify for rural delivery may receive mail only through post office boxes. High-volume business customers can also arrange for special pick-up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faq.usps.com/eCustomer/iq/usps/request.do?create=kb:USPSFAQ&amp;view()=c{15ca7f10-57e2-11dc-51b6-000000000000} USPS FAQ – Caller Service], multiple pickups for a fee{{Dead link|date=January 2016}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://faq.usps.com/eCustomer/iq/usps/request.do?create=kb:USPSFAQ&amp;view()=c{1624ad00-57e2-11dc-51b6-000000000000} USPS FAQ – Firm Holdout Service], free pickup once a day{{Dead link|date=January 2016}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another option is the old-style [[general delivery]], for people who have neither post office boxes nor street addresses. Mail is held at the post office until they present identification and pick it up.

Some customers receive free post office boxes if the USPS declines to provide door-to-door delivery to their location or a nearby box.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faq.usps.com/eCustomer/iq/usps/request.do?create=kb:USPSFAQ&amp;view()=c{0d389670-57e2-11dc-51b6-000000000000} USPS FAQ – Do I qualify for free box service?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324134730/http://faq.usps.com/eCustomer/iq/usps/request.do?create=kb%3AUSPSFAQ&amp;view%28%29=c%7B0d389670-57e2-11dc-51b6-000000000000%7D |date=2012-03-24 }}.

====Special delivery====

From 1885 to 1997, a service called [[special delivery (postal service)|special delivery]] was available, which caused a separate delivery to the final location earlier in the day than the usual daily rounds.

====Same-day trials====

In December 2012, the USPS began a limited one-year trial of same-day deliveries directly from retailers or distribution hubs to residential addresses in the same local area, a service it dubbed &quot;Metro Post&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=Post office tests same-day delivery|date=2012-11-23|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2012/11/23/cash-strapped-post-office-tests-same-day-delivery/EeG60PN9dhT9N7cdfMyj7J/story.html|access-date=2017-06-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629183904/http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2012/11/23/cash-strapped-post-office-tests-same-day-delivery/EeG60PN9dhT9N7cdfMyj7J/story.html|archive-date=2017-06-29|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Target |url=https://www.usps.com/metropost/ |title=USPS.com® – Metro Post |publisher=Usps.com |date=2011-03-28 |access-date=2013-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613090157/https://www.usps.com/metropost/ |archive-date=2013-06-13 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial was initially limited to San Francisco and the only retailer to participate in the first few weeks was [[1-800-FLOWERS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=EcommerceBytes.com|date=2013-01-14|first=Kenneth|last=Corbin|title=USPS Adding Retailers to Same Day Delivery Trial&amp;#124;http://www.ecommercebytes.com/cab/abn/y13/m01/i14/s04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other competition in this area includes [[online grocer]]s such as [[AmazonFresh]], [[Webvan]], and delivery services operated by grocery stores like [[Peapod]] and [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]].

====Forwarding and holds====

Residential customers can fill out a form to forward mail to a new address, and can also send pre-printed forms to any of their frequent correspondents. They can also put their mail on &quot;hold&quot;, for example, while on vacation. The Post Office will store mail during the hold, instead of letting it overflow in the mailbox. These services are not available to large buildings and customers of a [[commercial mail receiving agency]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://faq.usps.com/eCustomer/iq/usps/request.do?create=kb:USPSFAQ&amp;view()=c{11d2df10-57e2-11dc-51b6-000000000000} USPS FAQ – Commercial Mail Receiving Agency (CMRA)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324134758/http://faq.usps.com/eCustomer/iq/usps/request.do?create=kb%3AUSPSFAQ&amp;view%28%29=c%7B11d2df10-57e2-11dc-51b6-000000000000%7D |date=2012-03-24 }}.

==Financial services==

Postal [[money order]]s provide a safe alternative to sending [[cash]] through the mail, and are available in any amount up to $1,000. Like a bank [[cheque]], money orders are cashable only by the recipient. Unlike a personal bank check, they are prepaid and therefore cannot be returned because of insufficient funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usps.com/money/sendingmoney/moneyorders/welcome.htm Domestic Money Orders]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723222824/http://www.usps.com/money/sendingmoney/moneyorders/welcome.htm |date=July 23, 2011 }}.

From 1911 to 1967, the Postal Service also operated the [[United States Postal Savings System]], not unlike a [[savings and loan association]] with the amount of the deposit limited.&lt;ref name=&quot;postal savings system&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/postal-savings-system.pdf |title=Postal Savings System by HISTORIAN, UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE, JULY 2008 |format=PDF |access-date=2012-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114081647/http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/postal-savings-system.pdf |archive-date=2012-01-14 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A January 2014 report by the inspector general of the USPS suggested that the agency could earn $8.9&amp;nbsp;billion per year in revenue by providing financial services, especially in areas where there are no local banks but there is a local post office, and to customers who currently do not have bank accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uspsoig.gov/sites/default/files/document-library-files/2015/rarc-wp-14-007_0.pdf|title=Providing Non-Bank Financial Services for the Underserved|date=2014-01-17|access-date=2014-05-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016081958/https://www.uspsoig.gov/sites/default/files/document-library-files/2015/rarc-wp-14-007_0.pdf|archive-date=2015-10-16|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trade union|Labor unions]] representing USPS employees include: The [[American Postal Workers Union]] (APWU), which represents postal clerks and maintenance, motor vehicle, mail equipment shops, material distribution centers, and operating services and facilities services employees, postal nurses, and IT and accounting;&lt;ref&gt;Collective Bargaining Agreement between APWU and USPS&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Association of Letter Carriers]] (NALC), which represents city letter carriers; the [[National Rural Letter Carriers' Association]] (NRLCA), which represents rural letter carriers; and the [[National Postal Mail Handlers Union]] (NPMHU).

USPS employees are divided into major crafts according to the work they engage in:

* '''[[Mail carrier|Letter carriers]]''', also referred to as mailmen or mail carriers, prepare and deliver mail and parcels. They are divided into two categories: '''City Letter Carriers''', who are represented by the NALC, and '''[[Rural Letter Carrier]]s''', who are represented by the NRLCA. City Carriers are paid hourly with automatic overtime paid after 8 hours or 40 hours a week of duty. City Carriers are required to work in any kind of weather, daylight or dark and carry three bundles of mail (letters in one hand with magazines and other larger mail pieces) on the forearm carrying the mail. Advertisement mail, Every door direct (EDD) and smaller parcels all go in the carriers satchel). Larger parcels, up to a total of 70&amp;nbsp;lbs. may be delivered at various times of the day or with the mail. Mail routes are outfitted with a number of scanpoints (mailbox barcodes) on random streets every 30 to 40 minutes apart to keep track of the carriers whereabouts in real-time.
* '''Rural carriers''' are under a form of salary called &quot;evaluated hours&quot;, usually with overtime built into their pay. The evaluated hours are created by having all mail counted for a period of two or four weeks, and a formula used to create the set dollar amount they will be paid for each day worked until the next time the route is counted.
* '''Mail handlers and processors''', prepare, separate, load and unload mail and parcels, by delivery ZIP code and station, for the clerks. They work almost exclusively at the plants or larger mail facilities now after having their duties excessed and reassigned to clerks in Post Offices and Station branches.
* '''Clerks''', have a dual function by design of where their assignment is. Window clerks directly handle customer service needs at the counter, sort box mail and also sort first-class letters, standard and bulk-rate mail for the carriers on the work floor. Clerks may also work alongside mail handlers in large sorting facilities, outside of the public view, sorting mail. Data Conversion Operators, who encode address information at Remote Encoding Centers, are also members of the clerk craft. Mail handlers and Clerks are represented by the NPMHU and the APWU, respectively.

Other non-managerial positions in the USPS include:
* '''Maintenance and custodians''', who see to the overall operation and cleaning of mail sorting machines, work areas, public parking and general facility operations.
* '''City Carrier Assistants'''. (CCAs) With the Das Arbitration award the designation of PTF City Carrier has been abolished. TE City Carriers will have the opportunity to become CCAs. A CCA is a non-career employee who is hired for a 360-day term, similar to what TEs had. CCAs earn annual leave. CCAs, unlike TEs do have a direct path to becoming career employees. When excess City Carrier positions exist the CCA in that work installation with the highest &quot;relative standing&quot; will be promoted to a career employee and be assigned to the vacant position.
* '''Career, Part Time Flexible and Transitional employees''' (Career, PTF &amp; TE) There are a variety of other non-managerial positions in such crafts as accounting, information technology, and the remote encoding center. These are under a different contract than plant workers or letter carriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.apwu.org/issues/itasc-os-employees | publisher=APWU | title=IT/ASC &amp; OS Employees | access-date=2016-04-25 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212072133/https://www.apwu.org/issues/itasc-os-employees | archive-date=2016-02-12 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Contractors''' are not USPS employees, but work for the USPS under a written contract and usually paid per mile. They do not get benefits including health insurance, leave, life insurance, and pension. They must use their own vehicle and pay any cost to maintain, insure, or replace. Contractors generally make less than employees. Just like regular carriers they deliver packages and letters to mailboxes and doors.

Though the USPS employs many individuals, as more Americans send information via email, fewer postal workers are needed to work dwindling amounts of mail. Post offices and mail facilities are constantly downsizing, replacing craft positions with new machines and consolidating mail routes through the MIARAP (Modified Interim Alternate Route Adjustment Process) agreement. A major round of job cuts, early retirements, and a construction freeze were announced on March 20, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/03/20/post.office.cuts/index.html | publisher=CNN | title=Postal service to slash more than 3,000 jobs, offer early retirements | date=March 20, 2009 | access-date=May 26, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410184821/http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/03/20/post.office.cuts/index.html | archive-date=April 10, 2010 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workplace violence===

In the early 1990s, widely publicized [[Workplace violence|workplace shootings]] by disgruntled employees at USPS facilities led to a Human Resource effort to provide care for stressed workers and resources for coworker conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://about.usps.com/postal-bulletin/2012/pb22341/html/info_003.htm#ep1440011 |title=Human Resources |publisher=About.usps.com |access-date=2013-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627021829/http://about.usps.com/postal-bulletin/2012/pb22341/html/info_003.htm#ep1440011 |archive-date=2013-06-27 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to media coverage, postal employees gained a reputation among the general public as more likely to be [[Mental disorder|mentally ill]].

Also, in the opening sequence of ''[[Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult|Naked Gun {{frac|33|1|3}}: The Final Insult]]'', a yell of &quot;Disgruntled postal workers&quot; is heard, followed by the arrival of postal workers with machine guns. In an episode of ''[[Seinfeld]]'', the mailman character, [[Newman (Seinfeld)|Newman]], explained in a dramatic monologue that postal workers &quot;go crazy and kill everyone&quot; because the mail never stops. In ''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[Sunday, Cruddy Sunday]],&quot; [[Nelson Muntz]] asks Postmaster Bill if he has &quot;ever gone on a killing spree&quot;; Bill replies, &quot;The day of the gun-toting, disgruntled postman shooting up the place went out with the [[Macarena (song)|Macarena]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/view_episode_scripts.php?episode=s10e12 |title=The Simpsons Episode Scripts: AABF08 – Sunday, Cruddy Sunday |publisher=Springfieldspringfield.co.uk |access-date=2015-06-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725221410/http://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/view_episode_scripts.php?episode=s10e12 |archive-date=2015-07-25 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series of massacres led the USPS to issue a rule prohibiting the possession of any type of firearms (except for those issued to Postal Inspectors) in all designated USPS facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pe.usps.com/text/pub52/pub52c4_008.htm|title=43 Firearms {{!}} Postal Explorer|website=pe.usps.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126012648/https://pe.usps.com/text/pub52/pub52c4_008.htm|archive-date=2018-01-26|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, video footage was released showing a group of police officers from the [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD) arresting a USPS worker while he was in the middle of his deliveries. The footage showed that the officers were dressed in civilian clothing. The NYPD is reportedly investigating alleged [[disorderly conduct]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/postal-worker-speaks-out-on-controversial-arrest-by-nypd-captured-on-video/|title=Postal worker speaks out on controversial NYPD arrest caught on video|date=28 March 2016|access-date=29 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329022832/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/postal-worker-speaks-out-on-controversial-arrest-by-nypd-captured-on-video/|archive-date=29 March 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}
* In the film ''[[Miracle on 34th Street]]'' (1947), the identity of [[Santa Claus|Kris Kringle]] (played by [[Edmund Gwenn]]) as the one and only &quot;[[Santa Claus]]&quot; was validated by a state court, based on the delivery of 21 bags of mail (famously carried into the courtroom) to the character in question. The contention was that it would have been illegal for the United States Post Office to deliver mail that was addressed to &quot;Santa Claus&quot; to the character &quot;Kris Kringle&quot; unless he were, in fact, the one and only Santa Claus. Judge Henry X. Harper (played by [[Gene Lockhart]]) ruled that since the U.S. Government had demonstrated through the delivery of the bags of mail that Kris Kringle was Santa Claus, the [[State of New York]] did not have the authority to overrule that decision.
* The novel ''[[Post Office (novel)|Post Office]]'' (1971), written by poet and novelist [[Charles Bukowski]], is a semi-autobiographical account of his life over the years as a letter carrier. Bukowski would, under duress, quit and years later return as a mail clerk. His personal account would detail the work at lengths as frustrating, menial, boring, and degrading.
* [[David Brin]]'s novel ''[[The Postman]]'' (1985) portrays the USPS and its returned services as a staple to revive the United States government in a post-apocalyptic world. It was [[The Postman (film)|adapted as a film]] starring [[Kevin Costner]] and [[Larenz Tate]] in 1997.
* The comedy film ''[[Dear God (film)|Dear God]]'' (1996), starring [[Greg Kinnear]] and [[Laurie Metcalf]], portrays a group of quirky postal workers in a [[dead letter office]] that handle letters addressed to the [[Easter Bunny]], [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]], and even God himself.
* In 2015, ''[[The Inspectors (TV series)|The Inspectors]]'', which depicts a group of postal inspectors investigating postal crimes, debuted on [[CBS]]. The series uses the USPIS seal and features messages and tips from the Chief Postal Inspector at the end of each episode.
*[[Signed, Sealed, Delivered (TV series)|''Signed, Sealed, Delivered'']] (original title: ''Dead Letters''), also known as Lost Letter Mysteries, is an American-Canadian drama/romantic comedy television series that aired on the [[Hallmark Channel]] from April 20 through June 22, 2014.
* In the [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Cheers]]'', [[Cliff Clavin]] (played by [[John Ratzenberger]]) was a [[know-it-all]] bar regular and [[letter carrier]].

'''Hyperlexia''' is a [[syndrome]] characterized by a [[child]]'s [[wiktionary:precocious|precocious]] [[Literacy|ability to read]]. It was initially identified by [[Norman E.|Norman E. Silberberg]] and [[Margaret C. Silberberg]] (1967), who defined it as the precocious ability to read words without prior training in learning to read, typically before the age of 5. They indicated that children with hyperlexia have a significantly higher word-decoding ability than their [[reading comprehension]] levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richman|first=Lynn, C.|author2=Wood, K.M.|title=Learning disability subtypes: classification of high functioning hyperlexia|journal=Brain and Language|year=2002|volume=82|issue=1|pages=10–21|doi=10.1016/S0093-934X(02)00007-X|pmid=12174811|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f4c99948e19f04d69a7f697605842d5caeb1accd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children with hyperlexia also present with an intense fascination for written material at a very early age.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Hyperlexia: Systematic review, neurocognitive modelling, and outcome|last=Ostrolenk|first=Alexia|date=May 2017|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2017.04.029|pmid=28478182|volume=79|journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|pages=134–149|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

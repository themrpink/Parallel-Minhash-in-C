The '''ecliptic coordinate system''' is a [[celestial coordinate system]] commonly used for representing the [[apparent place|apparent positions]] and [[orbit]]s of [[Solar System]] objects. Because most [[planet]]s (except [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]) and many [[Small Solar System body|small Solar System bodies]] have orbits with only slight [[inclination]]s to the [[ecliptic]], using it as the [[fundamental plane (spherical coordinates)|fundamental plane]] is convenient. The system's [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] can be the center of either the [[Sun]] or [[Earth]], its primary direction is towards the [[March equinox|vernal]] (March) [[equinox (celestial coordinates)|equinox]], and it has a [[right-hand rule|right-hand convention]]. It may be implemented in [[spherical coordinate system|spherical]] or [[Cartesian coordinate system|rectangular coordinates]].&lt;ref&gt;

{{see also|Axial precession|Astronomical nutation}}

The [[celestial equator]] and the [[ecliptic]] are slowly moving due to [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbing forces]] on the [[Earth]], therefore the [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]] of the primary direction, their intersection at the [[Northern Hemisphere]] vernal [[equinox]], is not quite fixed. A slow motion of Earth's axis, [[Axial precession|precession]], causes a slow, continuous turning of the coordinate system westward about the poles of the [[ecliptic]], completing one circuit in about 26,000 years. Superimposed on this is a smaller motion of the [[ecliptic]], and a small oscillation of the Earth's axis, [[astronomical nutation|nutation]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to reference a coordinate system which can be considered as fixed in space, these motions require specification of the [[equinox]] of a particular date, known as an [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]], when giving a position in ecliptic coordinates. The three most commonly used are:
;Mean equinox of a standard epoch: (usually the [[Epoch (astronomy)|J2000.0 epoch]], but may include B1950.0, B1900.0, etc.) is a fixed standard direction, allowing positions established at various dates to be compared directly.
;Mean equinox of date: is the intersection of the [[ecliptic]] of &quot;date&quot; (that is, the ecliptic in its position at &quot;date&quot;) with the ''mean'' equator (that is, the equator rotated by [[Axial precession|precession]] to its position at &quot;date&quot;, but free from the small periodic oscillations of [[astronomical nutation|nutation]]). Commonly used in planetary [[orbit]] calculation.
;True equinox of date: is the intersection of the [[ecliptic]] of &quot;date&quot; with the ''true'' equator (that is, the mean equator plus [[astronomical nutation|nutation]]). This is the actual intersection of the two planes at any particular moment, with all motions accounted for.
A position in the ecliptic coordinate system is thus typically specified ''true equinox and ecliptic of date'', ''mean equinox and ecliptic of J2000.0'', or similar. Note that there is no &quot;mean ecliptic&quot;, as the ecliptic is not subject to small periodic oscillations.&lt;ref&gt;

;Ecliptic longitude
:''Ecliptic longitude'' or ''celestial longitude'' (symbols: heliocentric {{mvar|l}}, geocentric {{mvar|λ}}) measures the angular distance of an object along the [[ecliptic]] from the primary direction. Like [[right ascension]] in the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the primary direction (0° ecliptic longitude) points from the Earth towards the Sun at the vernal [[equinox]] of the Northern Hemisphere. Because it is a right-handed system, ecliptic longitude is measured positive eastwards in the fundamental plane (the ecliptic) from 0° to 360°. Because of [[axial precession]], the ecliptic longitude of most &quot;fixed stars&quot; (referred to the equinox of date) increases by about 50.3 [[arcsecond]]s per year, or 83.8 [[arcminute]]s per century, the speed of general precession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=N.

''Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics'' '''58''', pp. 1-16&lt;/ref&gt; However, for stars near the ecliptic poles, the rate of change of ecliptic longitude is dominated by the slight movement of the ecliptic (that is, of the plane of the earth's orbit), so the rate of change may be anything from minus infinity to plus infinity depending on the exact position of the star.
;Ecliptic latitude
:''Ecliptic latitude'' or ''celestial latitude'' (symbols: heliocentric {{mvar|b}}, geocentric {{mvar|β}}), measures the angular distance of an object from the [[ecliptic]] towards the north (positive) or south (negative) [[ecliptic pole]]. For example, the [[Ecliptic pole|north ecliptic pole]] has a celestial latitude of +90°. Ecliptic latitude for &quot;fixed stars&quot; is not affected by precession.
;Distance
:''Distance'' is also necessary for a complete spherical position (symbols: heliocentric {{mvar|r}}, geocentric {{mvar|Δ}}). Different distance units are used for different objects. Within the [[Solar System]], [[astronomical unit]]s are used, and for objects near the [[Earth]], [[Earth radius|Earth radii]] or [[kilometer]]s are used.

=== Historical use ===
From antiquity through the 18th&amp;nbsp;century, ecliptic longitude was commonly measured using twelve [[Astrological sign|zodiacal signs]], each of 30°&amp;nbsp;longitude, a practice that continues in modern [[astrology]]. The signs approximately corresponded to the [[constellation]]s crossed by the ecliptic. Longitudes were specified in signs, degrees, minutes, and seconds. For example, a longitude of {{nowrap|♌ 19°&amp;thinsp;55′&amp;thinsp;58″}} is 19.933°&amp;nbsp;east of the start of the sign [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]]. Since Leo begins 120°&amp;nbsp;from the vernal [[equinox]], the longitude in modern form is {{nowrap|139°&amp;thinsp;55′&amp;thinsp;58″}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/acompleatsystem01leadgoog |title=A Compleat System of Astronomy |first=Charles |last=Leadbetter |year=1742 |publisher=J. Wilcox, London |page=[https://archive.org/details/acompleatsystem01leadgoog/page/n102 94]}}; numerous examples of this notation appear throughout the book.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|solar term}}

In China, ecliptic longitude is measured using 24&amp;nbsp;[[Solar term]]s, each of 15°&amp;nbsp;longitude, and are used by [[Chinese calendar|Chinese lunisolar calendars]] to stay synchronized with the seasons, which is crucial for agrarian societies.

==Rectangular coordinates==
[[File:Heliocentric rectangular ecliptic.png|thumb|[[heliocentrism|Heliocentric]] ecliptic coordinates. The [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] is the [[Sun]]'s center, the [[plane of reference]] is the [[ecliptic]] plane, and the primary direction (the {{mvar|x}}-axis) is the vernal [[equinox (celestial coordinates)|equinox]]. A [[right-handed rule]] specifies a {{mvar|y}}-axis 90° to the west on the fundamental plane. The {{mvar|z}}-axis points toward the north [[ecliptic pole]]. The reference frame is relatively stationary, aligned with the vernal equinox.]]

A [[Cartesian coordinate system|rectangular variant]] of ecliptic coordinates is often used in [[orbit]]al calculations and simulations. It has its [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] at the center of the [[Sun]] (or at the [[barycenter]] of the [[Solar System]]), its [[fundamental plane (spherical coordinates)|fundamental plane]] on the [[ecliptic]] plane, and the {{mvar|x}}-axis toward the vernal [[equinox (celestial coordinates)|equinox]]. The coordinates have a [[right-handed rule|right-handed convention]], that is, if one extends their right thumb upward, it simulates the {{mvar|z}}-axis, their extended index finger the {{mvar|x}}-axis, and the curl of the other fingers points generally in the direction of the {{mvar|y}}-axis.&lt;ref&gt;
''Explanatory Supplement'' (1961), pp. 20, 27&lt;/ref&gt;

These rectangular coordinates are related to the corresponding spherical coordinates by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
x &amp;= r \cos b \cos l \\
y &amp;= r \cos b \sin l \\
z &amp;= r \sin b \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Eudoxus of Cnidus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|juː|d|ə|k|s|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc|Εὔδοξος ὁ Κνίδιος}}, ''Eúdoxos ho Knídios''; {{circa|408|355&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Eudoxus-Oxford-Dict-Philosophy&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eudoxus-St-Andrew&quot; /&gt;) was an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[astronomer]], [[mathematician]], scholar, and student of [[Archytas]] and [[Plato]]. All of his works are lost, though some fragments are preserved in [[Hipparchus]]' commentary on [[Aratus]]'s poem on [[astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Lasserre, François (1966) ''Die Fragmente des Eudoxos von Knidos'' (de Gruyter: Berlin)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Sphaerics]]'' by [[Theodosius of Bithynia]] may be based on a work by Eudoxus.

==Life==

Eudoxus was born and died in [[Cnidus]] (also spelled [[Knidos]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Eudoxus-St-Andrew&quot; /&gt; which was a city on the southwest coast of modern day [[Turkey]]. The years of Eudoxus' birth and death are not fully known but the range may have been {{circa|408|355&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}},&lt;ref name=&quot;Eudoxus-Oxford-Dict-Philosophy&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackburn|first=Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy|year=2008|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=[[Oxford, United Kingdom]]|isbn=9780199541430|edition=revised 2nd|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095800103|access-date=30 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eudoxus-St-Andrew&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Eudoxus of Cnidus|last1=O'Connor|first1=J. J.|last2=Robertson|first2=E. F.|work=[[University of St Andrews]]|url=https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Eudoxus/|access-date=30 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; or {{circa|390|337&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}}.  
His name Eudoxus means &quot;honored&quot; or &quot;of good repute&quot; ({{lang|grc|εὔδοξος}}, from ''eu'' &quot;good&quot; and ''doxa'' &quot;opinion, belief, fame&quot;). It is analogous to the Latin name [[wikt:Benedictus|Benedictus]].

Eudoxus's father, Aeschines of [[Cnidus]], loved to watch stars at night. Eudoxus first traveled to [[Taranto|Tarentum]] to study with [[Archytas]], from whom he learned [[mathematics]]. While in [[Italy]], Eudoxus visited [[Sicily]], where he studied medicine with [[Philistion of Locri|Philiston]].

At the age of 23, he traveled with the physician [[Theomedon]]—who (according to [[Diogenes Laërtius]]) some believed was his lover&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius; VIII.87&lt;/ref&gt;—to [[Athens]] to study with the followers of [[Socrates]]. He eventually attended lectures of [[Plato]] and other philosophers for several months, but due to a disagreement they had a falling-out. Eudoxus was quite poor and could only afford an apartment at the [[Piraeus]]. To attend Plato's lectures, he walked the {{convert|7|mi|km}} in each direction each day. Due to his poverty, his friends raised funds sufficient to send him to [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], to pursue his study of astronomy and mathematics. He lived there for 16 months. From Egypt, he then traveled north to [[Cyzicus]], located on the south shore of the Sea of Marmara, the [[Propontis]]. He traveled south to the court of [[Mausolus]]. During his travels he gathered many students of his own.

Around 368 BC, Eudoxus returned to Athens with his students. According to some sources, around 367 he assumed headship of the Academy during Plato's period in Syracuse, and taught [[Aristotle]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} He eventually returned to his native Cnidus, where he served in the city assembly. While in Cnidus, he built an observatory and continued writing and lecturing on [[theology]], astronomy, and [[meteorology]]. He had one son, Aristagoras, and three daughters, Actis, Philtis, and Delphis.

In mathematical astronomy, his fame is due to the introduction of the [[concentric spheres]], and his early contributions to understanding the movement of the [[planet]]s.

His work on [[Proportion (mathematics)|proportion]]s shows insight into [[real number]]s; it allows rigorous treatment of continuous quantities and not just [[Integer|whole numbers]] or even [[rational number]]s. When it was revived by [[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia|Tartaglia]] and others in the 16th century, it became the basis for quantitative work in science for a century, until it was replaced by [[Richard Dedekind]].

[[Impact crater|Craters]] on [[List of craters on Mars#E|Mars]] and the [[Eudoxus (lunar crater)|Moon]] are named in his honor. An [[algebraic curve]] (the [[Kampyle of Eudoxus]]) is also named after him.

==Mathematics&lt;!--Linked from 'Galileo Galilei'--&gt;==
Eudoxus is considered by some to be the greatest of [[Classical Greece|classical Greek]] mathematicians, and in all [[Ancient Greece|Antiquity]] second only to [[Archimedes]].&lt;ref name=calinger&gt;{{Cite book |last=Calinger |first=Ronald |title=Classics of Mathematics |publisher=Moore Publishing Company, Inc. |year=1982 |location=Oak Park, Illinois |page=75 |isbn=0-935610-13-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eudoxus was probably the source for most of book V of [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's {{em|Elements}}]].{{sfn|Ball|1908|p=54}}  He rigorously developed [[Sophistic works of Antiphon|Antiphon]]'s [[method of exhaustion]],  a precursor to the [[integral calculus]] which was also used in a masterly way by Archimedes in the following century.  In applying the method, Eudoxus proved such mathematical statements as: areas of circles are to one another as the squares of their radii, volumes of spheres are to one another as the cubes of their radii, the volume of a pyramid is one-third the volume of a [[Prism (geometry)|prism]] with the same base and altitude, and the volume of a cone is one-third that of the corresponding cylinder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kline&quot;&gt;Morris Kline, ''Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times'' Oxford University Press, 1972 pp. 48–50&lt;/ref&gt;  

Eudoxus introduced the idea of non-quantified mathematical [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] to describe and work with continuous geometrical entities such as lines, angles, areas and volumes, thereby avoiding the use of [[irrational number]]s. In doing so, he reversed a [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] emphasis on number and arithmetic, focusing instead on geometrical concepts as the basis of rigorous mathematics. Some Pythagoreans, such as Eudoxus's teacher [[Archytas]], had believed that only arithmetic could provide a basis for proofs. Induced by the need to understand and operate with [[Communicability (mathematics)|incommensurable]] quantities, Eudoxus established what may have been the first deductive organization of mathematics on the basis of explicit [[axiom]]s. The change in focus by Eudoxus stimulated a divide in mathematics which lasted two thousand years. In combination with a Greek intellectual attitude unconcerned with practical problems, there followed a significant retreat from the development of techniques in arithmetic and algebra.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kline&quot; /&gt;

The Pythagoreans had discovered that the diagonal of a square does not have a common unit of measurement with the sides of the square; this is the famous discovery that the [[square root of 2]] cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers. This discovery had heralded the existence of incommensurable quantities beyond the integers and rational fractions, but at the same time it threw into question the idea of measurement and calculations in geometry as a whole. For example, [[Euclid]] provides an elaborate proof of the Pythagorean theorem (''Elements'' I.47), by using addition of areas and only much later (''Elements'' VI.31) a simpler proof from similar triangles, which relies on ratios of line segments.

Ancient Greek mathematicians calculated not with quantities and equations as we do today, but instead they used proportionalities to express the relationship between quantities. Thus the ratio of two similar quantities was not just a numerical value, as we think of it today; the ratio of two similar quantities was a primitive relationship between them.

Eudoxus was able to restore confidence in the use of proportionalities by providing an astounding definition for the meaning of the equality between two ratios. This definition of proportion forms the subject of Euclid's Book V.

In Definition 5 of Euclid's Book V we read:

{{Quote|Magnitudes are said to be in the same ratio, the first to the second and the third to the fourth when, if any equimultiples whatever be taken of the first and third, and any equimultiples whatever of the second and fourth, the former equimultiples alike exceed, are alike equal to, or alike fall short of, the latter equimultiples respectively taken in corresponding order.}}

By using modern-day notation, this is clarified as follows. If we take four quantities: ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', and ''d'', then the first and second have a ratio &lt;math&gt;a/b&lt;/math&gt;; similarly the third and fourth have a ratio &lt;math&gt;c/d&lt;/math&gt;.

Now to say that &lt;math&gt;a/b = c/d&lt;/math&gt; we do the following:
For any two arbitrary integers, ''m'' and ''n'', form the equimultiples
''m''·''a'' and ''m''·''c'' of the first and third; likewise form the equimultiples ''n''·''b'' and ''n''·''d'' of the second and fourth.

If it happens that ''m''·''a'' &gt; ''n''·''b'', then we must also have ''m''·''c'' &gt; ''n''·''d''.
If it happens that ''m''·''a'' = ''n''·''b'', then we must also have ''m''·''c'' = ''n''·''d''. Finally, if it happens that ''m''·''a'' &lt; ''n''·''b'', then we must also have ''m''·''c'' &lt; ''n''·''d''.

Notice that the definition depends on comparing the similar quantities ''m''·''a'' and ''n''·''b'', and the similar quantities ''m''·''c'' and ''n''·''d'', and does not depend on the existence of a common unit of measuring these quantities.

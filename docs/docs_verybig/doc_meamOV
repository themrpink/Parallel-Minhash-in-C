===Polish-Yotvingian vocabulary===
Until the 1970s, Yotvingian was chiefly known from toponyms and medieval Russian sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kapović|2008|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in 1978, a monument with Yotvingian writing was discovered by accident. In [[Belarus]], a young man named Vyacheslav Zinov,&lt;ref&gt;http://ukrainianweek.com/History/65799&lt;/ref&gt; an amateur collector, bought a book of Catholic prayers from an old man from {{ill|Novy Dvor|ru|Новый Двор (Брестская область)}} village in the depths of [[Białowieża Forest]], which held a small manuscript titled ''Pogańskie gwary z Narewu'' (&quot;Pagan Speeches of [[Narew]]&quot;). It was written partly in [[Polish language|Polish]], and partly in an unknown, &quot;pagan&quot; language. Unfortunately, Zinov's parents threw away the book. However, before the manuscript was destroyed, Zinov had made notes of it which he sent to [[Vilnius University]] in 1983. Even though Zinov's notes were riddled with errors, it has been proven beyond doubt that the notes are indeed a copy of an authentic Yotvingian text.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kapović|2008|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zink&gt;Зинкявичюс З. &quot;Польско-ятвяжский словарик?&quot;, Балто-славянские исследования, 1983. — Moscow, Наука, 1984, pp. 3—29.

Concerning the language, Zinkevičius put forth three possible versions: (1) a Yotvingian dialect under a heavy influence of Lithuanian (2) Lithuanian words over a strong Yotvingian substratum (3) the compiler of the dictionary could not tell Lithuanian from Yotvingian clearly, and may have included words from both. The latter version is indirectly supported by the name of the document: &quot;Speeches&quot;, rather than &quot;Speech&quot; &lt;ref name=zink/&gt; Some scholars did not rule out the possibility of forgery, but there are strong indications it was not.&lt;ref&gt;Krzysztof Tomasz Witczak, &quot;“The Pagan dialects from Narew” in the light of Yatvingian onomastic remnants&quot; in: ''Baltic from an Indo-European perspective''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="6182" xml:space="preserve">{{about|a [[bidding system]] for contract bridge|the &quot;standard&quot; American English accent|General American}}

'''Standard American''' is a  bidding system for the game of [[Contract bridge|bridge]] widely used in North America and elsewhere. Owing to the popularization of the game by [[Charles Goren]] in the 1940s and 1950s, its early versions were sometimes referred to simply as 'Goren'.  With the addition and evolution of various {{gcb|treatment|treatments}} and {{gcb|conventions|conventions}}, it is now more generally referred to as Standard American. It is a bidding system based on [[five-card majors]] and a strong notrump; players may add conventions and refine the meanings of bids through partnership agreements summarized in their {{gcb|conventioncard|convention card}}. One standardised version, SAYC (Standard American Yellow Card), is widely used by casual partnerships and in online bridge.

==Role of bidding systems==

The purpose of bidding during the auction phase of each deal is to disclose information which one's partner may employ in order to arrive at an [[Optimum contract and par contract|optimal contract]] while concurrently contending with the opponents' attempts to do likewise. A bidding system is a set of agreements about the meanings of the different bids that the players use.  Each bid provides information about the hand's high-card strength and suit distribution based on [[hand evaluation]] techniques.

==History==

&quot;Standard American&quot; was the label given to the bridge bidding system developed by [[Charles Goren]] and his contemporaries in the 1940s.  This system employed the 1915 point-count method to evaluate the strength of a bridge hand.  Most bids had fairly specific requirements regarding hand strength and suit distribution.  This point-count system became so popular that most bridge players, social and tournament players alike, used it.  American bridge teams in the late 1930s and 1940s won world championships using Standard American.

Modifications began to appear from the 1950s forward.  Before the year 2000, new bidding systems evolved, including &quot;[[2/1 Game Forcing]]&quot; which are otherwise substantial departures from early Standard American methods.  Most tournament pairs now assemble their own system from a variety of new treatments and conventions that have evolved.  The nearest thing to a common system in tournament play is the &quot;Standard American Yellow Card&quot; (SAYC) promulgated by the [[American Contract Bridge League]].  SAYC is widely used in internet bridge play, but only rarely in on-site tournament play.

==Most common elements==

The essential common elements of modern Standard American systems are:
* Hand evaluation based on the 4-3-2-1 [[Milton Work#Work Point Count System|point count system]] (Ace = 4, King = 3, Queen = 2 and Jack = 1) with adjustments for the location of honors and suit distribution.
* A hand-strength requirement of at least 12-13 points to open 1-of-a-suit. 
* [[Five-card majors]]: opening a major suit promises at least a five-card holding in that suit.
* [[Weak two bid]]s: Two diamond, heart or spade openers are made with a sound six-card suit in a hand without enough overall strength to open 1 of the suit.
* [[Strong two clubs]]: All unbalanced hands too strong to open at the one-level are opened with an artificial 2{{Clubs}} call, as well as balanced hands stronger than 21 HCP.
* [[Preempt|Pre-emptive opening bids]]: Suit openings above the two level are pre-emptive, promising a long and strong suit.
* Limit Raises: A jump-raise of the opener's suit by responder, in the absence of opponent interference, is invitational to game. In Goren's system, this was a strong game-forcing raise.
* Notrump openers show a balanced hand, with the following common high card point (HCP) ranges:
** 1NT = 15-17 HCP
** 2NT = 20-21 HCP
** 3NT = 25-27 HCP
* Common notrump follow-up conventions include [[Stayman]], [[Jacoby transfers]] and [[Gerber convention|Gerber]].

==SAYC==
{{redirect|SAYC|Mitsubishi's S-AYC (Super Active Yaw Control) technology|Active yaw control}}

The Standard American Yellow Card (SAYC) is a set of partnership agreements summarized in a [[convention card]] created by the [[American Contract Bridge League]] (ACBL) to be used as the required bidding system in specified events or as a base for a casual or online partnerships. Some of the specific agreements in Standard American Yellow Card (SAYC) that elaborate on or depart from more current Standard American bidding are:
* A 2{{Clubs}} response to a 1NT opening is specified as the &quot;non-forcing&quot; version of the [[Stayman convention]].
* A 2{{Spades}} response to a 1NT is a relay to the minors when responder holds a long (at least six card length) minor suit and a weak hand; opener bids 3{{Clubs}} and responder either passes or corrects to 3{{Diamonds}} which opener is expected to pass.
* Straight [[Blackwood convention|Blackwood]] is used and not the [[Blackwood convention#Roman Key Card Blackwood|Roman Key Card Blackwood]] or other variation.
* In response to a 2{{Clubs}} opening, the 2{{Diamonds}} response is the &quot;waiting&quot; version of that response.
* In response to a weak-two opening, RONF (&quot;Raise Only Non-Force&quot;) is used.
* The [[Jacoby 2NT]] is used to show a game-forcing raise of a major suit with four-card support.
* [[Negative double]]s are used through the level of 2{{Spades}}.
* [[Fourth suit forcing]] is used.
* [[Michaels cuebid]] and [[Unusual notrump]] are used.
* Conventions are specified as being &quot;off&quot; in response to a 1NT overcall, except that 2{{Clubs}} is still Stayman.

'''Data mining''' is a process of discovering patterns in large [[data set]]s involving methods at the intersection of [[machine learning]], [[statistics]], and [[database system]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;acm&quot; /&gt; Data mining is an [[interdisciplinary]] subfield of [[computer science]] and [[statistics]] with an overall goal to extract information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transform the information into a comprehensible structure for further use.&lt;ref name=&quot;acm&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kdd.org/curriculum/index.html |title=Data Mining Curriculum |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[SIGKDD]] |date=2006-04-30 |access-date=2014-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brittanica&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Clifton |first=Christopher |title=Encyclopædia Britannica: Definition of Data Mining |year=2010 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1056150/data-mining |access-date=2010-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;elements&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hastie|first1=Trevor|author-link1=Trevor Hastie|last2=Tibshirani|first2=Robert|author-link2=Robert Tibshirani|last3=Friedman|first3=Jerome|author-link3=Jerome H.

The term &quot;data mining&quot; is a [[misnomer]], because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, not the extraction (''mining'') of data itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;han-kamber&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Data mining: concepts and techniques|last1=Han|first1=Jiawei|last2=Kamber|first2=Micheline|date=2001|publisher=[[Morgan Kaufmann]]|isbn=978-1-55860-489-6|page=5|quote=Thus, data mining should have been more appropriately named &quot;knowledge mining from data,&quot; which is unfortunately somewhat long|author-link1=Jiawei Han}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also is a [[buzzword]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.okairp.org/documents/2005%20Fall/F05_ROMEDataQualityETC.pdf OKAIRP 2005 Fall Conference, Arizona State University] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201170452/http://www.okairp.org/documents/2005%20Fall/F05_ROMEDataQualityETC.pdf|date=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is frequently applied to any form of large-scale data or [[information processing]] ([[Data collection|collection]], [[information extraction|extraction]], [[Data warehouse|warehousing]], analysis, and statistics) as well as any application of [[Decision support system|computer decision support system]], including [[artificial intelligence]] (e.g., machine learning) and [[business intelligence]].

Witten}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which covers mostly machine learning material) was originally to be named just ''Practical machine learning'', and the term ''data mining'' was only added for marketing reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Bouckaert, Remco R.|author2=Frank, Eibe|author3=Hall, Mark A.|author4=Holmes, Geoffrey|author5=Pfahringer, Bernhard|author6=Reutemann, Peter|author7=Witten, Ian H.|author-link7=Ian H.

The term &quot;data mining&quot; was [added] primarily for marketing reasons.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the more general terms (''large scale'') ''[[data analysis]]'' and ''[[analytics]]''—or, when referring to actual methods, ''artificial intelligence'' and ''machine learning''—are more appropriate.

The actual data mining task is the semi-automatic or automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records ([[cluster analysis]]), unusual records ([[anomaly detection]]), and dependencies ([[association rule mining]], [[sequential pattern mining]]). This usually involves using database techniques such as [[spatial index|spatial indices]]. These patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine learning and [[predictive analytics]]. For example, the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data, which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a [[decision support system]]. Neither the data collection, data preparation, nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step, but do belong to the overall KDD process as additional steps.

The difference between [[data analysis]] and data mining is that data analysis is used to test models and hypotheses on the dataset, e.g., analyzing the effectiveness of a marketing campaign, regardless of the amount of data; in contrast, data mining uses machine learning and statistical models to uncover clandestine or hidden patterns in a large volume of data.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, D. L. (2007). Data mining in business services. ''Service Business'', ''1''(3), 181–193. {{doi|10.1007/s11628-006-0014-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The related terms ''[[data dredging]]'', ''data fishing'', and ''data snooping'' refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are (or may be) too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered. These methods can, however, be used in creating new hypotheses to test against the larger data populations.

==Etymology==
In the 1960s, statisticians and economists used terms like ''data fishing'' or ''data dredging'' to refer to what they considered the bad practice of analyzing data without an a-priori hypothesis. The term &quot;data mining&quot; was used in a similarly critical way by economist [[Michael Lovell]] in an article published in the ''[[Review of Economic Studies]]'' in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lovell|first=Michael C.|date=1983|title=Data Mining|journal=The Review of Economics and Statistics|volume=65|issue=1|pages=1–12|doi=10.2307/1924403|jstor=1924403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Wojciech W. |last1=Charemza |first2=Derek F. |last2=Deadman |title=New Directions in Econometric Practice |location=Aldershot |publisher=Edward Elgar |year=1992 |chapter=Data Mining |pages=14–31 |isbn=1-85278-461-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovell indicates that the practice &quot;masquerades under a variety of aliases, ranging from &quot;experimentation&quot; (positive) to &quot;fishing&quot; or &quot;snooping&quot; (negative).

The term ''data mining'' appeared around 1990 in the database community, generally with positive connotations. For a short time in 1980s, a phrase &quot;database mining&quot;™, was used, but since it was trademarked by HNC, a San Diego-based company, to pitch their Database Mining Workstation;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mena&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Mena |first=Jesús |year=2011 |title=Machine Learning Forensics for Law Enforcement, Security, and Intelligence |location=Boca Raton, FL |publisher=CRC Press (Taylor &amp; Francis Group) |isbn=978-1-4398-6069-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; researchers consequently turned to ''data mining''. Other terms used include ''data archaeology'', ''information harvesting'', ''information discovery'', ''knowledge extraction'', etc. [[Gregory I. Piatetsky-Shapiro|Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro]] coined the term &quot;knowledge discovery in databases&quot; for the first workshop on the same topic [http://www.kdnuggets.com/meetings/kdd89/ (KDD-1989)] and this term became more popular in [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] and [[machine learning]] community. However, the term data mining became more popular in the business and press communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Piatetsky-Shapiro |first1=Gregory |author-link1=Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro |last2=Parker |first2=Gary |url=http://www.kdnuggets.com/data_mining_course/x1-intro-to-data-mining-notes.html |title=Lesson: Data Mining, and Knowledge Discovery: An Introduction |publisher=KD Nuggets |year=2011 |work=Introduction to Data Mining |access-date=30 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the terms ''data mining'' and ''knowledge discovery'' are used interchangeably.

In the academic community, the major forums for research started in 1995 when the First International Conference on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery ([[KDD-95]]) was started in Montreal under [[AAAI]] sponsorship. It was co-chaired by [[Usama Fayyad]] and Ramasamy Uthurusamy. A year later, in 1996, Usama Fayyad launched the journal by Kluwer called [[Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery]] as its founding editor-in-chief. Later he started the [[SIGKDD]] Newsletter SIGKDD Explorations.&lt;ref name=SIGKDD-explorations&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fayyad|first1=Usama|title=First Editorial by Editor-in-Chief|journal=SIGKDD Explorations|date=15 June 1999|volume=13|issue=1|pages=102|doi=10.1145/2207243.2207269|s2cid=13314420|url=http://www.kdd.org/explorations/view/june-1999-volume-1-issue-1|access-date=27 December 2010|ref=SIGKDD-explorations}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KDD International conference became the primary highest quality conference in data mining with an acceptance rate of research paper submissions below 18%. The journal ''Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery'' is the primary research journal of the field.

==Background==
The manual extraction of patterns from [[data]] has occurred for centuries. Early methods of identifying patterns in data include [[Bayes' theorem]] (1700s) and [[regression analysis]] (1800s). The proliferation, ubiquity and increasing power of computer technology have dramatically increased data collection, storage, and manipulation ability. As [[data set]]s have grown in size and complexity, direct &quot;hands-on&quot; data analysis has increasingly been augmented with indirect, automated data processing, aided by other discoveries in computer science, specially in the field of machine learning, such as [[neural networks]], [[cluster analysis]], [[genetic algorithms]] (1950s), [[decision tree learning|decision trees]] and [[decision rules]] (1960s), and [[support vector machines]] (1990s). Data mining is the process of applying these methods with the intention of uncovering hidden patterns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kantardzic&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Kantardzic |first=Mehmed |title=Data Mining: Concepts, Models, Methods, and Algorithms |year=2003 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-471-22852-3 |oclc=50055336 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/dataminingconcep0000kant }}&lt;/ref&gt; in large data sets. It bridges the gap from [[applied statistics]] and artificial intelligence (which usually provide the mathematical background) to [[database management]] by exploiting the way data is stored and indexed in databases to execute the actual learning and discovery algorithms more efficiently, allowing such methods to be applied to ever-larger data sets.

==Process==
The ''knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) process'' is commonly defined with the stages:

# Selection
# Pre-processing
# Transformation
# ''Data mining''
# Interpretation/evaluation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fayyad&quot; /&gt;

It exists, however, in many variations on this theme, such as the [[Cross-industry standard process for data mining]] (CRISP-DM) which defines six phases:

# Business understanding
# Data understanding
# Data preparation
# Modeling
# Evaluation
# Deployment

or a simplified process such as (1) Pre-processing, (2) Data Mining, and (3) Results Validation.

Polls conducted in 2002, 2004, 2007 and 2014 show that the CRISP-DM methodology is the leading methodology used by data miners.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro]] (2002) [http://www.kdnuggets.com/polls/2002/methodology.htm ''KDnuggets Methodology Poll''], [[Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro]] (2004) [http://www.kdnuggets.com/polls/2004/data_mining_methodology.htm ''KDnuggets Methodology Poll''], [[Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro]] (2007) [http://www.kdnuggets.com/polls/2007/data_mining_methodology.htm ''KDnuggets Methodology Poll''], [[Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro]] (2014) [http://www.kdnuggets.com/polls/2014/analytics-data-mining-data-science-methodology.html ''KDnuggets Methodology Poll'']&lt;/ref&gt; The only other data mining standard named in these polls was [[SEMMA]]. However, 3–4 times as many people reported using CRISP-DM. Several teams of researchers have published reviews of data mining process models,&lt;ref name=&quot;kurgan&quot;&gt;Lukasz Kurgan and Petr Musilek: [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=451120 &quot;A survey of Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining process models&quot;].

===Pre-processing===
Before data mining algorithms can be used, a target data set must be assembled. As data mining can only uncover patterns actually present in the data, the target data set must be large enough to contain these patterns while remaining concise enough to be mined within an acceptable time limit. A common source for data is a [[data mart]] or [[data warehouse]]. Pre-processing is essential to analyze the [[Multivariate statistics|multivariate]] data sets before data mining. The target set is then cleaned. Data cleaning removes the observations containing [[statistical noise|noise]] and those with [[missing data]].

===Data mining===
Data mining involves six common classes of tasks:&lt;ref name=&quot;Fayyad&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fayyad |first1=Usama |author-link1=Usama Fayyad |last2=Piatetsky-Shapiro |first2=Gregory|author-link2=Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro |last3=Smyth |first3=Padhraic |title=From Data Mining to Knowledge Discovery in Databases |year=1996 |url=http://www.kdnuggets.com/gpspubs/aimag-kdd-overview-1996-Fayyad.pdf |access-date = 17 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Anomaly detection]] (outlier/change/deviation detection) – The identification of unusual data records, that might be interesting or data errors that require further investigation.
* [[Association rule learning]] (dependency modeling) – Searches for relationships between variables. For example, a supermarket might gather data on customer purchasing habits. Using association rule learning, the supermarket can determine which products are frequently bought together and use this information for marketing purposes. This is sometimes referred to as market basket analysis.
* [[Cluster analysis|Clustering]] – is the task of discovering groups and structures in the data that are in some way or another &quot;similar&quot;, without using known structures in the data.
* [[Statistical classification|Classification]] – is the task of generalizing known structure to apply to new data. For example, an e-mail program might attempt to classify an e-mail as &quot;legitimate&quot; or as &quot;spam&quot;.
* [[Regression analysis|Regression]] – attempts to find a function that models the data with the least error that is, for estimating the relationships among data or datasets.
* [[Automatic summarization|Summarization]] – providing a more compact representation of the data set, including visualization and report generation.

===Results validation===
[[File:Spurious correlations - spelling bee spiders.svg|thumb|An example of data produced by [[data dredging]] through a bot operated by statistician Tyler Vigen, apparently showing a close link between the best word winning a spelling bee competition and the number of people in the United States killed by venomous spiders. The similarity in trends is obviously a coincidence.]]{{Missing information|section|non-classification tasks in data mining. It only covers [[machine learning]]|date=September 2011}}
Data mining can unintentionally be misused, and can then produce results that appear to be significant; but which do not actually predict future behavior and cannot be [[Reproducibility|reproduced]] on a new sample of data and bear little use. Often this results from investigating too many hypotheses and not performing proper [[statistical hypothesis testing]]. A simple version of this problem in [[machine learning]] is known as [[overfitting]], but the same problem can arise at different phases of the process and thus a train/test split—when applicable at all—may not be sufficient to prevent this from happening.&lt;ref name=&quot;hawkins&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawkins | first1 = Douglas M | year = 2004 | title = The problem of overfitting | journal = Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 1–12 | doi=10.1021/ci0342472| pmid = 14741005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final step of knowledge discovery from data is to verify that the patterns produced by the data mining algorithms occur in the wider data set. Not all patterns found by data mining algorithms are necessarily valid. It is common for data mining algorithms to find patterns in the training set which are not present in the general data set. This is called [[overfitting]]. To overcome this, the evaluation uses a [[test set]] of data on which the data mining algorithm was not trained. The learned patterns are applied to this test set, and the resulting output is compared to the desired output. For example, a data mining algorithm trying to distinguish &quot;spam&quot; from &quot;legitimate&quot; emails would be trained on a [[training set]] of sample e-mails. Once trained, the learned patterns would be applied to the test set of e-mails on which it had ''not'' been trained. The accuracy of the patterns can then be measured from how many e-mails they correctly classify. Several statistical methods may be used to evaluate the algorithm, such as [[Receiver operating characteristic|ROC curves]].

If the learned patterns do not meet the desired standards, subsequently it is necessary to re-evaluate and change the pre-processing and data mining steps. If the learned patterns do meet the desired standards, then the final step is to interpret the learned patterns and turn them into knowledge.

==Research==
The premier professional body in the field is the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]'s (ACM) Special Interest Group (SIG) on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining ([[SIGKDD]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.research.microsoft.com/?SearchDomain=2&amp;SubDomain=7&amp;entitytype=2|title=Microsoft Academic Search: Top conferences in data mining | publisher=[[Microsoft Academic Search]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.de/citations?view_op=top_venues&amp;hl=en&amp;vq=eng_datamininganalysis|title=Google Scholar: Top publications - Data Mining &amp; Analysis|publisher=[[Google Scholar]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1989, this ACM SIG has hosted an annual international conference and published its proceedings,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kdd.org/conferences.php Proceedings] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430120252/http://www.kdd.org/conferences.php |date=2010-04-30 }}, International Conferences on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, ACM, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; and since 1999 it has published a biannual [[academic journal]] titled &quot;SIGKDD Explorations&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kdd.org/explorations/about.php SIGKDD Explorations], ACM, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer science conferences on data mining include:

* [[CIKM Conference]] – ACM [[Conference on Information and Knowledge Management]]
* [[European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases]]
* [[KDD Conference]] – ACM SIGKDD [[Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining]]

Data mining topics are also present on many [[List of computer science conferences#Data Management|data management/database conferences]] such as the ICDE Conference, [[SIGMOD|SIGMOD Conference]] and [[International Conference on Very Large Data Bases]]

==Standards==
There have been some efforts to define standards for the data mining process, for example, the 1999 European [[Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining]] (CRISP-DM 1.0) and the 2004 [[Java Data Mining]] standard (JDM 1.0). Development on successors to these processes (CRISP-DM 2.0 and JDM 2.0) was active in 2006 but has stalled since. JDM 2.0 was withdrawn without reaching a final draft.

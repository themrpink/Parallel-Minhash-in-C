Through use of the land trade along the [[Silk Road]] and [[maritime history|maritime trade]] by sail at sea, the Tang were able to acquire and gain many new technologies, cultural practices, rare luxury, and contemporary items. From Europe, the Middle East, Central and South Asia, the Tang dynasty were able to acquire new ideas in fashion, new types of ceramics, and improved silver-smithing techniques.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|pp=118–119}} The Tang Chinese also gradually adopted the foreign concept of stools and chairs as seating, whereas the Chinese beforehand always sat on mats placed on the floor.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=119}} People of the Middle East coveted and purchased in bulk Chinese goods such as silks, [[lacquerware]]s, and [[porcelain]] wares.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=112}} Songs, dances, and musical instruments from foreign regions became popular in China during the Tang dynasty.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=114}}{{sfn|Whitfield|2004|p=255}} These musical instruments included [[oboe]]s, [[flute]]s, and small lacquered drums from [[Kucha]]&lt;!--Weren't some of the foreign instruments and musicians in Chang'an also from [[Sogdiana]]?--&gt; in the [[Tarim Basin]], and percussion instruments from India such as [[cymbal]]s.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=114}} At the court there were nine musical ensembles (expanded from seven in the Sui dynasty) that played ecletic Asian music.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=134}}

There was great interaction with India, a hub for Buddhist knowledge, with famous travelers such as [[Xuanzang]] (d. 664) visiting the South Asian state. After a 17-year-long trip, Xuanzang managed to bring back valuable [[Sanskrit]] texts to be translated into Chinese. There was also a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]–Chinese dictionary available for serious scholars and students, while Turkic folk songs gave inspiration to some Chinese poetry.{{sfn|Schafer|1985|p=28}}{{sfn|Eberhard|2005|p=182}} In the interior of China, trade was facilitated by the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] and the Tang government's rationalization of the greater canal system that reduced costs of transporting grain and other commodities.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=7}} The state also managed roughly {{convert|32100|km|mi|abbr=on}} of [[Postal administration|postal service]] routes by horse or boat.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=90}}

===Silk Road===

Although the [[Silk Road]] from China to [[Western civilization|Europe and the Western World]] was initially formulated during the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu]] (141–87&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}) during the [[Han dynasty|Han]], it was reopened by the Tang in 639 when [[Hou Junji]] ({{abbr|d.|Died}}&amp;nbsp;643) conquered the West, and remained open for almost four decades. It was closed after the Tibetans captured it in 678, but in 699, during Empress Wu's period, the Silk Road reopened when the Tang reconquered the [[Four Garrisons of Anxi]] originally installed in 640,{{sfn|Twitchett|2000|p=118}} once again connecting China directly to the West for land-based trade.{{sfn|Eberhard|2005|p=179}}

The Tang captured the vital route through the [[Gilgit|Gilgit Valley]] from Tibet in 722, lost it to the Tibetans in 737, and regained it under the command of the Goguryeo-Korean General Gao Xianzhi.{{sfn|Sen|2003|pp=30–32}} When the An Lushan Rebellion ended in 763, the Tang Empire withdrew its troops from its western lands, allowing the Tibetan Empire to largely cut off China's direct access to the Silk Road.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=11}} An internal rebellion in 848 ousted the Tibetan rulers, and Tang China regained its northwestern prefectures from Tibet in 851. These lands contained crucial grazing areas and pastures for raising horses that the Tang dynasty desperately needed.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=11}}{{sfn|Whitfield|2004|pp=57, 228}}

Despite the many expatriate European travelers coming into China to live and trade, many travelers, mainly religious monks and missionaries, recorded China's stringent immigrant laws . As the monk Xuanzang and many other monk travelers attested to, there were many Chinese government [[border checkpoint|checkpoints]] along the Silk Road that examined travel permits into the Tang Empire. Furthermore, [[outlaw|banditry]] was a problem along the checkpoints and [[oasis]] towns, as Xuanzang also recorded that his group of travelers were assaulted by bandits on multiple occasions.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=112}}

The [[Silk Road]] also affected [[Tang dynasty paintings|Tang dynasty art]]. Horses became a significant symbol of prosperity and power as well as an instrument of military and diplomatic policy. Horses were also revered as a relative of the dragon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Birmingham Museum of Art]]|title=Birmingham Museum of Art : guide to the collection|year=2010|publisher=Birmingham Museum of Art|location=[Birmingham, AL]|isbn=978-1-904832-77-5|page=25|url=http://artsbma.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Tang dynasty, thousands of foreign expatriate merchants came and lived in numerous Chinese cities to do business with China, including [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Arabs]], [[Hindu]] Indians, [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], [[Bengalis]], [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]], [[Khmer people|Khmers]], [[Cham (Asia)|Chams]], [[History of the Jews in China|Jews]] and [[Nestorianism|Nestorian Christians]] of the [[Near East]], among many others.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=46}}{{sfn|Schafer|1985|p=20}} In 748, the Buddhist monk Jian Zhen described [[Guangzhou]] as a bustling mercantile business center where many large and impressive foreign ships came to dock. He wrote that &quot;many large ships came from [[Borneo]], Persia, Qunglun ([[Indonesia]]/[[Java]])...with...spices, pearls, and jade piled up mountain high&quot;,{{sfn|Tang|1991|p=61}}{{sfn|Schafer|1985|p=15}} as written in the ''Yue Jue Shu'' (Lost Records of the State of Yue). Relations with the Arabs were often strained: When the imperial government was attempting to quell the [[An Lushan Rebellion]], Arab and Persian [[pirate]]s burned and looted Canton on October 30, 758. {{sfn|Benn|2002|p=11}} The Tang government reacted by shutting the port of Canton down for roughly five decades; thus, foreign vessels docked at [[Hanoi]] instead.{{sfn|Schafer|1985|p=16}} However, when the port reopened, it continued to thrive. In 851 the Arab merchant [[Sulaiman al-Tajir]] observed the manufacturing of Chinese [[porcelain]] in Guangzhou and admired its transparent quality.{{sfn|Shen|1996|p=163}} He also provided a description of Guangzhou's landmarks, granaries, local government administration, some of its written records, treatment of travelers, along with the use of [[ceramic]]s, rice, wine, and tea.{{sfn|Woods|1996|p=143}} Their presence [[Guangzhou massacre|came to an end]] under the revenge of Chinese rebel Huang Chao in 878, who purportedly slaughtered thousands regardless of ethnicity.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=108}}{{sfn|Schafer|1985|pp=10, 16}}{{sfn|Eberhard|2005|p=190}} Huang's rebellion was eventually suppressed in 884.

Vessels from neighboring East Asian states such as Silla and [[Balhae]] of Korea and the [[Hizen Province]] of Japan were all involved in the [[Yellow Sea]] trade, which Silla dominated.{{sfn|Schafer|1985|p=11}} After Silla and Japan reopened renewed hostilities in the late 7th century, most Japanese maritime merchants chose to set sail from [[Nagasaki Prefecture|Nagasaki]] towards the mouth of the [[Huai River]], the Yangtze River, and even as far south as the [[Hangzhou Bay]] in order to avoid Korean ships in the Yellow Sea.{{sfn|Schafer|1985|p=11}}{{sfn|Reischauer|1940|p=157}} In order to sail back to Japan in 838, the Japanese embassy to China procured nine ships and sixty Korean sailors from the Korean wards of Chuzhou and Lianshui cities along the Huai River.{{sfn|Reischauer|1940|p=162}} It is also known that Chinese trade ships traveling to Japan set sail from the various ports along the coasts of [[Zhejiang]] and [[Fujian]] provinces.{{sfn|Reischauer|1940|pp=155–156}}

The Chinese engaged in large-scale production for overseas export by at least the time of the Tang. This was proven by the discovery of the [[Belitung shipwreck]], a silt-preserved shipwrecked Arabian [[dhow]] in the [[Gaspar Strait]] near [[Belitung]], which had 63,000 pieces of Tang ceramics, silver, and gold (including a [[Changsha]] bowl inscribed with a date: &quot;16th day of the seventh month of the second year of the Baoli reign&quot;, or 826, roughly confirmed by [[radiocarbon dating]] of [[star anise]] at the wreck).&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc news&quot;&gt;{{Citation |access-date=October 21, 2008 |date=October 18, 2008 |title=The treasure trove making waves: Simon Worrall explains why a recent discovery on the seabed of the Indian Ocean will revolutionise our understanding of two ancient civilisations |newspaper=BBC News   |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/7675866.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 785, the Chinese began to call regularly at [[Sufala]] on the East African coast in order to cut out Arab middlemen,{{sfn|Shen|1996|p=155}} with various contemporary Chinese sources giving detailed descriptions of trade in Africa. The official and geographer [[Jia Dan]] (730–805) wrote of two common sea trade routes in his day: one from the coast of the [[Bohai Sea]] towards Korea and another from Guangzhou through [[Malacca]] towards the [[Nicobar Islands]], Sri Lanka and India, the eastern and northern shores of the Arabian Sea to the Euphrates River.{{sfn|Hsu|1988|p=96}} In 863 the Chinese author [[Duan Chengshi]] (d. 863) provided a detailed description of the [[slave trade]], [[ivory trade]], and [[ambergris]] trade in a country called [[Bobali]], which historians suggest was [[Berbera]] in Somalia.{{sfn|Levathes|1994|p=38}} In [[Fustat]] (old [[Cairo]]), Egypt, the fame of Chinese ceramics there led to an enormous demand for Chinese goods; hence Chinese often traveled there (this continued into later periods such as [[Fatimid]] Egypt).{{sfn|Shen|1996|p=158}}{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=80}} From this time period, the Arab merchant Shulama once wrote of his admiration for Chinese seafaring [[Junk (ship)|junks]], but noted that their draft was too deep for them to enter the Euphrates River, which forced them to ferry passengers and cargo in small boats.{{sfn|Liu|1991|p=178}} Shulama also noted that Chinese ships were often very large, with capacities up to 600–700 passengers.{{sfn|Hsu|1988|p=96}}{{sfn|Liu|1991|p=178}}

Both the Sui and Tang Dynasties had turned away from the more [[feudal]] culture of the preceding Northern Dynasties, in favor of staunch civil [[Confucianism]].{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}} The governmental system was supported by a large class of Confucian intellectuals selected through either civil service examinations or recommendations. In the Tang period, [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]] were commonly practiced ideologies that played a large role in people's daily lives. The Tang Chinese enjoyed feasting, drinking, holidays, sports, and all sorts of entertainment, while [[Chinese literature]] blossomed and was more widely accessible with new [[printing]] methods.

===Chang'an, the Tang capital===
{{main|Chang'an}}

[[File:Prince Yide's tomb, towers.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A mural depicting a [[Chinese city wall|corner tower]], most likely one of [[Chang'an]], from the tomb of [[Li Chongrun|Prince Yide]] (d. 701) at the [[Qianling Mausoleum]], dated 706]]

Although Chang'an was the capital of the earlier Han and Jin dynasties, after subsequent destruction in warfare, it was the Sui dynasty model that comprised the Tang era capital. The roughly square dimensions of the city had six miles (10&amp;nbsp;km) of outer walls running east to west, and more than five miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) of outer walls running north to south.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=93}} The royal palace, the Taiji Palace, stood north of the city's central axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McMullen|first=David L.|title=State and court ritual in China|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-62157-1|page=166|editor=McDermott, Joseph P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the large Mingde Gates located mid-center of the main southern wall, a wide city avenue stretched from there all the way north to the central administrative city, behind which was the Chentian Gate of the royal palace, or Imperial City. Intersecting this were fourteen main streets running east to west, while eleven main streets ran north to south. These main intersecting roads formed 108 rectangular wards with walls and four gates each, and each ward filled with multiple [[city block]]s. The city was made famous for this checkerboard pattern of main roads with walled and gated districts, its layout even mentioned in one of Du Fu's poems.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=103}} During the [[Heian period]], the city of [[Heian kyō]] (present-day [[Kyoto]]) of Japan like many cities was arranged in the checkerboard street grid pattern of the Tang capital and in accordance with traditional geomancy following the model of Chang'an.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=92}} Of these 108 wards in Chang'an, two of them (each the size of two regular city wards) were designated as government-supervised markets, and other space reserved for temples, gardens, ponds, etc.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=93}} Throughout the entire city, there were 111 Buddhist monasteries, 41 Taoist abbeys, 38 family shrines, 2 official temples, 7 churches of foreign religions, 10 city wards with provincial transmission offices, 12 major inns, and 6 graveyards.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=xiii}} Some city wards were literally filled with open public playing fields or the backyards of lavish mansions for playing horse polo and [[cuju]] (Chinese soccer).{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=xiv, xv, xvi, xvii, xviii}} In 662, [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Emperor Gaozong]] moved the imperial court to the [[Daming Palace]], which became the political center of the empire and served as the royal residence of the Tang emperors for more than 220 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Journey into China's Antiquity|year=1997|publisher=Morning Glory Publishers|location=Beijing|isbn=978-7-5054-0507-3|page=56|editor=Yu, Weichao}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chang'an of Tang.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|Map of Chang'an in Tang Dynasty]]

The Tang capital was the largest city in the world at its time, the population of the city wards and its suburban countryside reaching two million inhabitants.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=93}} The Tang capital was very cosmopolitan, with ethnicities of [[Persia]], Central Asia, Japan, Korea, [[Vietnam]], Tibet, India, and many other places living within. Naturally, with this plethora of different ethnicities living in Chang'an, there were also many different practiced religions, such as [[Buddhism]], [[Nestorianism|Nestorian Christianity]], and [[Zoroastrianism]], among others.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=79}} With the open access to China that the [[Silk Road]] to the west facilitated, many foreign settlers were able to move east to China, while the city of Chang'an itself had about 25,000 foreigners living within.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=112}} Exotic green-eyed, blond-haired [[Tocharians|Tocharian ladies]] serving wine in [[agate]] and [[amber]] cups, singing, and dancing at taverns attracted customers.{{sfn|Schafer|1985|p=21}} If a foreigner in China pursued a Chinese woman for marriage, he was required to stay in China and was unable to take his bride back to his homeland, as stated in a law passed in 628 to protect women from temporary marriages with foreign envoys.{{sfn|Schafer|1985|p=25}} Several laws enforcing segregation of foreigners from Chinese were passed during the Tang dynasty. In 779 the Tang dynasty issued an edict which forced [[Uyghur people|Uighurs]] in the capital, Chang'an, to wear their ethnic dress, stopped them from marrying Chinese females, and banned them from passing off as Chinese.{{sfn|Schafer|1985|p=22}}

[[File:Jingyun Bell.JPG|thumb|left|The bronze Jingyun Bell cast 711, height 247 cm high, weight 6,500&amp;nbsp;kg, now in the Xi'an Bell Tower]]
Chang'an was the center of the central government, the home of the imperial family, and was filled with splendor and wealth. However, incidentally it was not the economic hub during the Tang dynasty. The city of [[Yangzhou]] along the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] and close to the [[Yangtze River]] was the greatest economic center during the Tang era.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=46}}{{sfn|Schafer|1985|pp=17–18}}

Yangzhou was the headquarters for the Tang government's salt monopoly, and was the greatest industrial center of China. It acted as a midpoint in shipping of foreign goods that would be organized and distributed to the major cities of the north.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=46}}{{sfn|Schafer|1985|pp=17–18}} Much like the seaport of [[Guangzhou]] in the south, Yangzhou boasted thousands of foreign traders from all across Asia.{{sfn|Schafer|1985|pp=17–18}}{{sfn|Reischauer|1940|pp=143–144}}

There was also the secondary capital city of [[Luoyang]], which was the favored capital of the two by [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wu]]. In the year 691 she had more than 100,000 families (more than 500,000 people) from around the region of Chang'an move to populate Luoyang instead. With a population of about a million, Luoyang became the second largest city in the empire, and with its close proximity to the Luo River it benefited from southern agricultural fertility and trade traffic of the Grand Canal. However, the Tang court eventually demoted its capital status and did not visit Luoyang after the year 743, when Chang'an's problem of acquiring adequate supplies and stores for the year was solved.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=46}} As early as 736, granaries were built at critical points along the route from Yangzhou to Chang'an, which eliminated shipment delays, spoilage, and pilfering.{{sfn|Schafer|1985|pp=18–19}} An artificial lake used as a transshipment pool was dredged east of Chang'an in 743, where curious northerners could finally see the array of boats found in southern China, delivering tax and tribute items to the imperial court.{{sfn|Schafer|1985|pp=19–20}}

Over 48,900 poems penned by some 2,200 Tang authors have survived to the present day.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=120}}{{sfn|Harper|2005|p=33}} Skill in the composition of poetry became a required study for those wishing to pass imperial examinations,{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=259}} while poetry was also heavily competitive; poetry contests amongst guests at banquets and courtiers were common.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=137}} Poetry styles that were popular in the Tang included [[Shi (poetry)#Gushi|''gushi'']] and [[Shi (poetry)#Jintishi|''jintishi'']], with the renowned poet [[Li Bai]] (701–762) famous for the former style, and poets like [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]] (701–761) and [[Cui Hao (poet)|Cui Hao]] (704–754) famous for their use of the latter. ''Jintishi'' poetry, or regulated verse, is in the form of eight-line [[stanza]]s or seven [[Chinese characters|characters]] per line with a fixed pattern of tones that required the second and third couplets to be antithetical (although the [[antithesis]] is often lost in translation to other languages).{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=102}} Tang poems remained popular and great emulation of Tang era poetry began in the Song dynasty; in that period, Yan Yu (嚴羽; active 1194–1245) was the first to confer the poetry of the High Tang (c. 713–766) era with &quot;canonical status within the classical poetic tradition.&quot; Yan Yu reserved the position of highest esteem among all Tang poets for [[Du Fu]] (712–770), who was not viewed as such in his own era, and was branded by his peers as an anti-traditional rebel.{{sfn|Yu|1998|pp=75–76}}

The [[Classical Prose Movement]] was spurred in large part by the writings of Tang authors [[Liu Zongyuan]] (773–819) and [[Han Yu]] (768–824). This new prose style broke away from the poetry tradition of the ''piantiwen'' ({{lang|zh-hant|騙體文}}, &quot;parallel prose&quot;) style begun in the Han dynasty. Although writers of the Classical Prose Movement imitated ''piantiwen'', they criticized it for its often vague content and lack of colloquial language, focusing more on clarity and precision to make their writing more direct.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=106}} This ''guwen'' (archaic prose) style can be traced back to Han Yu, and would become largely associated with [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] [[Neo-Confucianism]].{{sfn|Huters|1987|p=52}}

Short story fiction and tales were also popular during the Tang, one of the more famous ones being ''Yingying's Biography'' by [[Yuan Zhen]] (779–831), which was widely circulated in his own time and by the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1279–1368) became the basis for plays in [[Chinese opera]].{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|pp=104–105}}{{sfn|Wong|1979|p=97}} Timothy C. Wong places this story within the wider context of Tang love tales, which often share the plot designs of quick passion, inescapable societal pressure leading to the abandonment of romance, followed by a period of [[Melancholia|melancholy]].{{sfn|Wong|1979|pp=95–100}} Wong states that this scheme lacks the undying vows and total self-commitment to love found in Western romances such as ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', but that underlying traditional Chinese values of inseparableness of self from one's environment (including human society) served to create the necessary fictional device of romantic tension.{{sfn|Wong|1979|pp=98–99}}

There were large [[encyclopedia]]s published in the Tang. The ''[[Yiwen Leiju]]'' encyclopedia was compiled in 624 by the chief editor [[Ouyang Xun]] (557–641) as well as [[Linghu Defen]] (582–666) and [[Chen Shuda]] (d. 635). The encyclopedia ''[[Treatise on Astrology of the Kaiyuan Era]]'' was fully compiled in 729 by [[Gautama Siddha]] (fl. 8th century), an ethnic Indian astronomer, astrologer, and scholar born in the capital Chang'an.

[[History of geography#China|Chinese geographers]] such as [[Jia Dan]] wrote accurate descriptions of places far abroad. In his work written between 785 and 805, he described the sea route going into the mouth of the [[Persian Gulf]], and that the medieval [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]] (whom he called the people of Luo-He-Yi) had erected 'ornamental pillars' in the sea that acted as [[lighthouse]] beacons for ships that might go astray.{{sfn|Needham|1986c|p=661}} Confirming Jia's reports about lighthouses in the Persian Gulf, Arabic writers a century after Jia wrote of the same structures, writers such as [[al-Mas'udi]] and [[al-Muqaddasi]]. The Tang dynasty Chinese diplomat [[Wang Xuance]] traveled to [[Magadha]] (modern northeastern [[India]]) during the 7th century.{{sfn|Sen|2003|pp=9, 22–24}} Afterwards he wrote the book ''Zhang Tianzhu Guotu'' (Illustrated Accounts of Central India), which included a wealth of geographical information.{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=511}}

Many histories of previous dynasties were compiled between 636 and 659 by court officials during and shortly after the reign of [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]]. These included the ''[[Book of Liang]]'', ''[[Book of Chen]]'', ''[[Book of Northern Qi]]'', ''[[Book of Zhou]]'', ''[[Book of Sui]]'', ''[[Book of Jin]]'', ''[[History of Northern Dynasties]]'' and the ''[[History of Southern Dynasties]]''. Although not included in the official ''[[Twenty-Four Histories]]'', the ''[[Tongdian]]'' and ''[[Tang Huiyao]]'' were nonetheless valuable written historical works of the Tang period. The ''[[Shitong]]'' written by [[Liu Zhiji]] in 710 was a meta-history, as it covered the history of [[Chinese historiography]] in past centuries until his time. The ''[[Great Tang Records on the Western Regions]]'', compiled by [[Bianji]], recounted the journey of [[Xuanzang]], the Tang era's most renowned [[Buddhist monk]].

Other important literary offerings included [[Duan Chengshi]]'s (d. 863) ''[[Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang]]'', an entertaining collection of foreign legends and hearsay, reports on natural phenomena, short [[anecdote]]s, mythical and mundane tales, as well as notes on various subjects. The exact literary category or classification that Duan's large informal narrative would fit into is still debated amongst scholars and historians.{{sfn|Reed|2003|p=121}}

Since ancient times, some Chinese had believed in [[Chinese folk religion|folk religion]] and [[Taoism]] that incorporated many deities. Practitioners believed the [[Tao]] and the afterlife was a reality parallel to the living world, complete with its own bureaucracy and afterlife currency needed by dead ancestors.{{sfn|Whitfield|2004|p=333}} Funerary practices included providing the deceased with everything they might need in the afterlife, including animals, servants, entertainers, hunters, homes, and officials. This ideal is reflected in [[Tang dynasty art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Birmingham Museum of Art]]|title=Birmingham Museum of Art : guide to the collection|year=2010|publisher=Birmingham Museum of Art|location=[Birmingham, AL]|isbn=978-1-904832-77-5|page=26|url=http://artsbma.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also reflected in many short stories written in the Tang about people accidentally winding up in the realm of the dead, only to come back and report their experiences.{{sfn|Whitfield|2004|p=333}}

[[Buddhism]], originating in India around the time of [[Confucius]], continued its influence during the Tang period and was accepted by some members of imperial family, becoming thoroughly sinicized and a permanent part of Chinese traditional culture. In an age before [[Neo-Confucianism]] and figures such as [[Zhu Xi]] (1130–1200), Buddhism had begun to flourish in China during the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]], and became the dominant ideology during the prosperous Tang. Buddhist monasteries played an integral role in Chinese society, offering lodging for travelers in remote areas, schools for children throughout the country, and a place for urban literati to stage social events and gatherings such as going-away parties.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=121}} Buddhist monasteries were also engaged in the economy, since their land property and serfs gave them enough revenues to set up mills, oil presses, and other enterprises.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=122}}{{sfn|Eberhard|2005|p=181}}{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=86}} Although the monasteries retained 'serfs', these monastery dependents could actually own property and employ others to help them in their work, including their own slaves.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=126}}

The prominent status of Buddhism in Chinese culture began to decline as the dynasty and central government declined as well during the late 8th century to 9th century. Buddhist [[convent]]s and [[List of Buddhist temples|temples]] that were exempt from state taxes beforehand were targeted by the state for taxation. In 845 [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang]] finally shut down 4,600 Buddhist monasteries along with 40,000 temples and shrines, forcing 260,000 Buddhist monks and nuns to return to [[secular]] life;{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=96}}{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=86}} this episode would later be dubbed one of the [[Four Buddhist Persecutions in China]]. Although the ban would be lifted just a few years after, Buddhism never regained its once dominant status in Chinese culture.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=96}}{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=86}}{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=124}}{{sfn|Harper|2005|p=34}} This situation also came about through a revival of interest in native Chinese philosophies such as Confucianism and Taoism. [[Han Yu]] (786–824)—who [[Arthur F. Wright]] stated was a &quot;brilliant [[polemicist]] and ardent [[Xenophobia|xenophobe]]&quot;—was one of the first men of the Tang to denounce Buddhism.{{sfn|Wright|1959|p=88}} Although his contemporaries found him crude and obnoxious, he would foreshadow the later persecution of Buddhism in the Tang, as well as the revival of Confucian theory with the rise of Neo-Confucianism of the Song dynasty.{{sfn|Wright|1959|p=88}} Nonetheless, [[Zen|Chán Buddhism]] gained popularity amongst the educated elite.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=96}} There were also many famous Chan monks from the Tang era, such as [[Mazu Daoyi]], [[Baizhang]], and [[Huangbo Xiyun]]. The sect of [[Pure Land Buddhism]] initiated by the Chinese monk [[Huiyuan (Buddhist)|Huiyuan]] (334–416) was also just as popular as Chan Buddhism during the Tang.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=123}}

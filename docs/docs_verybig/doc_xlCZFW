=== Competitions and records ===

It has become a custom at mass gatherings in the [[Valencian Community|Valencia region]] (festivals, political campaigns, protests, etc.) to prepare enormous paellas, sometimes to win a place in the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' book. Chefs use gargantuan ''paelleras'' for these events.

[[Valencia]] restaurateur Juan Galbis claims to have made the world's largest ''paella'' with help from a team of workers on 2 October 2001. This ''paella'' fed about 110,000 people according to Galbis' former website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paellagigante.com/|title=Paellas gigantes – Catering y paellas para eventos – Comidas gigantes|work=Paellas Gigantes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galbis says this ''paella'' was even larger than his earlier world-record ''paella'' made on 8 March 1992 which fed about 100,000 people. Galbis' record-breaking 1992 ''paella'' is listed in ''Guinness World Records''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2007/10/071030.aspx |title=Galbis's 1992 record listed on the Guinness website |publisher=Guinnessworldrecords.com |access-date=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversial representations ===
Some non-Spanish [[chef]]s include chorizo in their paellas along with other ingredients which Valencia people believe do not belong in ''paella'' of any type. The alternative name proposed for these dishes, although pejorative, is {{lang|es|arroz con cosas}} ('rice with things'). Famous cases are [[Jamie Oliver]]'s ''paella'' recipe (which included [[chorizo]])&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, Jamie. (16 September 2015) [http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/rice-recipes/chicken-chorizo-paella/ Chicken &amp; chorizo paella | Rice Recipes]. Jamie Oliver.

However, in an article for [[El País]], Spanish food writer Ana Vega 'Biscayenne', citing historical references, showed that traditional Valencian paella did indeed include chorizo, exclaiming, &quot;Ah Jamie, we'll have to invite you to the [[Falles]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vega|first1=Ana|title=La paella sí llevaba chorizo|url=https://elcomidista.elpais.com/elcomidista/2016/10/13/articulo/1476372723_268242.html|access-date=13 June 2018|work=[[El País]]|issue=El Comidista|date=14 October 2016|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Noto Emoji Pie 1f958.svg|thumb|''Paella'' UNICODE emoji]]

===Emoji===
In 2015, an [[emoji]] for ''paella'' was proposed to [[Unicode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2015/15055-paella-emoji.pdf|title=ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2/WG 2 PROPOSAL SUMMARY FORM TO ACCOMPANY SUBMISSIONS FOR ADDITIONS TO THE REPERTOIRE OF ISO/IEC 10646 1|last=Gonzalez Capella|first=Antonio|date=1 February 2015|work=[[Unicode]]|access-date=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[emoji]] was approved for Unicode 9.0 as {{code|U+1F958 &quot;SHALLOW PAN OF FOOD&quot;}} in June 2016. Although it is generally rendered as paella, [[Samsung]] has rendered the symbol as a Korean [[hot pot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emojipedia.org/shallow-pan-of-food/|title=Paella Emoji|publisher=[[Emojipedia]]|access-date=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional [[Valencian cuisine|Valencia cuisine]] offers recipes similar to ''paella valenciana'' and ''paella de marisco'' such as ''[[arròs negre]]'', ''arròs al forn'', ''arròs a banda'' and ''arròs amb fesols i naps'', since rice is the base of much of the local cuisine.

[[Fideuà]] is a [[pasta]] noodle dish variation cooked in a similar fashion in a ''paella''. It may be served with [[aioli|allioli]] sauce.

'''Khazaran''' was a city in the [[Khazaria|Khazar kingdom]], located on the eastern bank of the lower [[Volga River]]. It was connected to [[Atil, Khazaria|Atil]] by a [[pontoon bridge]].

Khazaran was later inhabited primarily by [[Muslims]] and featured numerous [[mosque]]s, minarets, and madrasas. It was a bustling trade center easily reachable by ship from the [[Caspian Sea]] and [[Volga|Volga River]], and many of its inhabitants were crafters, fishers, and traders. The leader of the city was a Muslim official known as the [[Khazz]]; in Arab sources the title given is sometimes [[vizier]].

The '''Falles''' ({{lang-ca-valencia|Falles}}; {{lang-es|Fallas}}) is a traditional celebration held in commemoration of [[Saint Joseph]] in the city of [[Valencia]], Spain. The term ''Falles'' refers to both the celebration and the [[Falla monument|monuments]] (''Falla'', singular; ''Falles'', plural) burnt during the celebration.&lt;ref name=Martin1973&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=Charles B.|title=The Fallas: A Folk Festival of Valencia|journal=The Journal of Popular Culture|date=March 1973|volume=6|issue=4|page=854|doi=10.1111/j.0022-3840.1973.00854.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of towns in the [[Valencian Community]] have similar celebrations inspired by the original Falles de València celebration. The Falles festival was added to [[UNESCO]]'s [[intangible cultural heritage]] of humanity list on 30 November 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPA2016&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Valencia Fallas festivity included in UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage list |url=http://www.epa.eu/arts-culture-and-entertainment-photos/customs-traditions-photos/valencia-fallas-festivity-included-in-unesco-s-intangible-cultural-heritage-list-photos-53141867 |access-date=1 December 2016 |work=EPA European Pressphoto Agency b.v. |agency=European Pressphoto Agency |date=November 30, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201033534/http://www.epa.eu/arts-culture-and-entertainment-photos/customs-traditions-photos/valencia-fallas-festivity-included-in-unesco-s-intangible-cultural-heritage-list-photos-53141867 |archive-date=December 1, 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each neighbourhood of the city has an organised group of people, the ''Casal faller'', that works all year long holding fundraising parties and dinners, usually featuring the noted dish [[paella]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AndrewsLeopold2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hazel Andrews|author2=Teresa Leopold|title=Events and the Social Sciences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LMBhsx_NadYC&amp;pg=PA11|date=8 February 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-60560-1|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; a specialty of the region. Each ''casal faller'' produces a construction known as a ''falla'' which is eventually burned.  A ''casal faller'' is also known as a ''comissió fallera'' and currently there are approximately 400 registered in Valencia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martí1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Gil-Manuel Hernàndez i Martí|title=Falles i franquisme a València|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JzTgAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22comissi%C3%B3%20fallera%22|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Afers|isbn=978-84-86574-36-9|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fallas.com/index.php/es/main-jcf-es/main-comisiones-es/827-numero-de-falla|title=Fallas - Comisiones por número de censo|date=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name of the festival is the plural of the [[Valencian language|Valencian]] word ''falla''.  The word's derivation is as follows:
:[[Latin]] ''[[wiktionary:fax#Latin|fax]]'' (accusative ''facem''), &quot;torch&quot; → [[Latin]] ''[[wiktionary:facula#Latin|facula]]'' (diminutive; accusative ''faculam'') → [[Vulgar Latin]] *''faclam'' → [[Valencian language|Valencian]] ''falla''.

==''Falles'' and ''ninots''==
&lt;gallery widths=&quot;200px&quot; heights=&quot;200px&quot;&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Formerly, much time would be spent by the ''casal faller'' preparing the ''ninots'' ([[Valencian]]  for puppets or dolls).&lt;ref name=&quot;ArweckKeenan2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Xavier Costa|editor1=Elisabeth Arweck|editor2=William J. F. Keenan|title=Materializing Religion: Expression, Performance and Ritual|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BXt2s8XhoBcC&amp;pg=PA65|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-5094-2|pages=64–65|chapter=Festivity and the Sacred: The Symbolic Universe in the Festival of the 'Fallas' of Saint Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the four days leading up to 19 March, each group takes its ''ninot'' out for a grand parade, and then mounts it, each on its own elaborate [[firecracker]]-filled [[Paperboard|cardboard]] and [[paper-mâché]] artistic monument, in a street of the given neighbourhood.  This whole assembly is a ''[[Falla monument|falla]]''.

The ''ninots'' and their ''falles'' are constructed according to an agreed-upon theme that has traditionally been a satirical jab at whatever draws the attention of the ''fallers'' (the registered participants of the ''casals'').&lt;ref name=&quot;ArweckKeenan2006&quot; /&gt; In modern times, the two-week-long festival has spawned a substantial local industry, to the point that an entire suburban area has been designated the ''Ciutat fallera'' (Falles City). Here, crews of artists and artisans, sculptors, painters, and other craftsmen, all spend months producing elaborate constructions of paper and wax, wood and [[polystyrene|polystyrene foam]] tableaux towering up to five stories, composed of fanciful figures, often caricatures, in provocative poses arranged in a gravity-defying manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;El País2014&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=El atractivo turístico de la Ciutat Fallera|url=http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2013/03/05/valencia/1362506634_651316.html|work=El País|issue=València|publisher=Ediciones El País, S.L.|date=5 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031180703/http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2013/03/05/valencia/1362506634_651316.html|archive-date=October 31, 2015|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of them is produced under the direction of one of the many individual neighbourhood ''casals fallers'' who vie with each other to attract the best artists, and then to create the most outrageous allegorical monument to their target. There are about 750 of these neighbourhood associations in Valencia,&lt;ref name=&quot;ArweckKeenan2006&quot; /&gt; with over 200,000 members, or a quarter of the city's population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richards2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Greg Richards|editor=Greg Richards|title=Cultural Tourism: Global and Local Perspectives|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZfhAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA271|date=7 March 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-79234-2|page=271|chapter=The Festivalization of Society or the Socialization of Festivals?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Falles, many people wear their ''casal faller'' dress of regional and historical costumes from different eras of València's history. The ''[[dulzaina|dolçaina]]'' (an [[oboe]]-like reed instrument) and ''[[drum|tabalet]]'' (a kind of Valencian drum) are frequently heard,&lt;ref name=&quot;Villarroya1992&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Antonio Ariño Villarroya|title=La ciudad ritual: la fiesta de las Fallas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aUzLVON2UdMC&amp;pg=PA13|date=1 January 1992|publisher=Anthropos Editorial|isbn=978-84-7658-368-5|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; as most of the different casals fallers have their own traditional bands.

Although the ''Falles'' is a very traditional event and many participants dress in medieval clothing, the ''ninots'' for 2005 included such modern characters as [[Shrek]] and [[George W. Bush]], and the 2012 ''Falles'' included characters like [[Barack Obama]] and [[Lady Gaga]].

==Events during ''Falles''==
[[Image:Fallers marching band.jpg|thumb|''La despertà'': a band of wind instruments marches through a small street in the early morning.]]
[[Image:mascleta 2004a.jpg|thumb|The crowd gathers in the main square, Valencia, Spain]]

The five days and nights of ''Falles'' might be described as a continuous street party. There are a multitude of processions: historical, religious, and comedic. Crowds in the restaurants spill out into the streets. Explosions can be heard all day long and sporadically through the night. Everyone from small children to elderly people can be seen throwing fireworks and noisemakers in the streets, which are littered with pyrotechnical debris. The timing of the events is fixed, and they fall on the same date every year, though there has been discussion about holding some events on the weekend preceding the Falles, to take greater advantage of the tourist potential of the festival&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.es/20120320/sociedad/rc-fiesta-unas-fallas-perfectas-201203200131.html Fin de fiesta de unas Fallas perfectas], ABC.es, 20 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; or changing the end date in years where it is due to occur in midweek.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.levante-emv.com/fallas/2012/03/20/hosteleros-quieren-fallas/891058.html Los hosteleros quieren ´más´ Fallas], ''Levante'', 20 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===La Despertà===
Each day of Falles begins at 8:00 am with ''La Despertà'' (&quot;the wake-up call&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;García2014&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Encarnación Galindo García|title=Las fallas de Valencia: Mucho más que un sueño|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RqyTBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44|date=30 July 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-84-9848-049-8|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brass bands appear from the casals and begin to march down every street playing lively music. Close behind them are the ''fallers'', throwing large firecrackers in the street as they go.[[File:Falleras.jpg|thumb|Falleras during the &quot;replegà&quot;]]

[[File:Parade_in_historical_Valencian_costumes.jpg|thumb|Falleres in their costumes march with the band]]

===La Mascletà===
{{main|Mascletà}}
The ''Mascletà'', an explosive barrage of coordinated firecracker and [[fireworks]] displays, takes place at 2:00&amp;nbsp;pm every day of the festival;&lt;ref name=&quot;García2014&quot; /&gt; the main event is the municipal Mascletà in the ''Plaça de l'Ajuntament'' where the pyrotechnicians compete for the honour of providing the final Mascletà of the ''festes'' (on 19 March). At 2:00 pm the clock chimes and the Fallera Major, dressed in her ''fallera'' finery,  will call from the balcony of [[City Hall]], ''Senyor/a pirotècnic/a, pot començar la mascletà!'' (&quot;Mr./Ms. Pyrotechnic, you may commence the Mascletà!&quot;), and the Mascletà begins.

The Mascletà is almost unique to the [[Valencian Community]], and very popular with the Valencian people. Smaller neighbourhoods often hold their own mascletà for saints' days, weddings and other celebrations.

A nighttime variant runs in the evening hours by the same pyrotechnicans that were present in the afternoon. In some days, women pyrotechnicians are selected to compete. The event is televised regionwide.

===La Plantà===
{{main|Plantà}}
On the day of the 15th, all of the ''falles infantils'' are to be finished being constructed, and later that night all of the ''falles majors'' (big Falles) are to be completed.&lt;ref name=&quot;García2014&quot; /&gt; If not, they face disqualification.

===L'Ofrena de flors===
In this event, the flower offering, each of the casals fallers takes an offering of flowers to the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] as ''Our Lady of the Forsaken.''&lt;ref name=&quot;García2014&quot; /&gt; This occurs all day during 17–18 March. A statue of the Virgin Mary and its large pedestal are then covered with all the flowers.

===Els Castells and La Nit del Foc===
On the nights of the 15, 16, 17, and 18th there are firework displays in the old riverbed in València. Each night is progressively grander and the last is called ''La Nit del Foc'' (the Night of Fire).&lt;ref name=&quot;García2014&quot; /&gt;

===Cavalcada del Foc===
On the final evening of Falles, at 7:00 pm on March 19, a parade known in Valencian as the ''Cavalcada del Foc'' (the Fire Parade) takes place along Colon street and Porta de la Mar square. This spectacular celebration of fire, the symbol of the fiesta's spirit, is the ''grand finale'' of Falles and a colourful, noisy event featuring exhibitions of the varied rites and displays from around the world which use fire; it incorporates floats, giant mechanisms, people in costumes, rockets, gunpowder, street performances and music.

===Traditional Dressing===
The traditional dress worn by &quot;falleros&quot; (males) has changed from black trousers and black jacket with white shirt and other motives, to colorful and a more traditional and historic custom with many decorations. These dresses can be very expensive but not as much as the dresses by the &quot;reinas falleras&quot; (queens of the festival). Prices of female traditional dresses can vary from 2,000 Euros to more than 20,000 Euros. Some of them are astonishing in beauty. They are accompanied with traditional hair style and jewelry.

===La Cremà===

On the final night of Falles, around midnight on March 19,&lt;ref name=&quot;CarvajalHorwood2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carol Styles Carvajal|author2=Jane Horwood|author3=Nicholas Rollin|title=Concise Oxford Spanish Dictionary: Spanish-English/English-Spanish|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780198609773|url-access=registration|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-860977-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780198609773/page/293 293]}}&lt;/ref&gt; these ''falles'' are burnt as huge bonfires. This is known as ''La Cremà'' (the Burning), the climax of the whole event,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ariño1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Antonio Ariño|title=El Teatre en la festa valenciana|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uo5dAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22La%20Crem%C3%A0%22%20%22falles%22d=uo5dAAAAMAAJ|year=1999|publisher=Generalitat Valenciana|isbn=978-84-482-2333-5|page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the reason why the constructions are called ''falles'' (&quot;torches&quot;).  Traditionally, the falla in the ''Plaça de l'Ajuntament'' is burned last.

All ''casals'' have a ''falla infantil'' (a children's ''falla'', smaller and without satirical themes), which is held a few metres away from the main one. This is burnt first, at 10:00 pm. The main neighbourhood ''falles'' are burnt closer to midnight; the burning of the ''falles'' in the city centre often starts later. For example, in 2005, the fire brigade delayed the burning of the Egyptian funeral ''falla'' in ''Carrer del Convent de Jerusalem'' until 1:30 am, when they were sure all safety concerns were addressed.

Each ''falla'' is laden with fireworks which are lit first. The construction itself is lit either after or during the explosion of these fireworks. ''Falles'' burn quite quickly, and the heat given off is felt by all around. The heat from the larger ones often drives the crowd back a couple of metres, even though they are already behind barriers that the fire brigade has set several metres from the construction. In narrower streets, the heat scorches the surrounding buildings, and the firemen douse the fronteres, window blinds, street signs, etc. with their hoses to stop them catching fire or melting, from the beginning of the ''cremà'' until it cools down.

Away from the ''falles'', people frolic in the streets, the whole city resembling an open-air dance party, except that instead of music there is the incessant (and occasionally deafening) sound of people throwing fireworks around randomly. There are many stalls selling trinkets and snacks such as the typical fried ''porres'', ''churros'' and ''bunyols'', as well as roasted chestnuts.

While the smaller fallas dotted around the streets are burned at approximately the same time, the last falla to be burned is the main one, which is saved until last so that everybody can watch it. This main falla is found outside the ''Ajuntament'' – the city hall building. People arrive a few hours before the scheduled burning time to get a front row view. This final falla is burned in public after the signal from the Fallera Major to officially commence.

There are different conjectures regarding the origin of the Falles festival. One suggests that the Falles started in the [[Middle Ages]], when artisans disposed of the broken artefacts and pieces of wood they saved during the winter by burning them to celebrate the [[spring equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|spring equinox]]. Valencian carpenters used planks of wood called ''parots'' to hang their candles on during the winter, as these were needed to provide light to work by. With the coming of the spring, they were no longer necessary, so they were burned.&lt;ref name=&quot;RodgersRodgers2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Eamonn Rodgers|title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Spanish Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6KKFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA174|date=11 March 2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-78858-3|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, and with the intervention of the Church, the date of the burning of these ''parots'' was made to coincide with the celebration of the festival of [[Saint Joseph]], the patron saint of carpenters.&lt;ref name=&quot;AltmanLow2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Irwin Altman|author2=Setha M.

This tradition continued to evolve. The ''parot'' was dressed with clothing so that it looked like a person; features identifiable with some well-known person from the neighbourhood were often added as well. To collect these materials, children went from house to house asking for ''una estoreta velleta'' (an old rug) to add to the ''parot''. This became a popular song that the children sang as they gathered all sorts of old flammable furniture and utensils to burn in the bonfire with the ''parot''. These ''parots'' were the first ''ninots''. Over the years, people of the neighbourhoods began to organise the building of the ''falles'', and thus the typically intricate constructions, including their various figures, were born.

Until the beginning of the 20th century, the ''falles'' were tall boxes with three or four wax dolls dressed in fabric clothing. This changed when the creators began to use cardboard. The fabrication of the ''falles'' continues to evolve in modern times, when the largest displays are made of [[polystyrene]] and soft cork easily molded with hot saws. These techniques have allowed the creation of ''falles'' over 30 metres high.

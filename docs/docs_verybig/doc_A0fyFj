== Verner's law in Gothic==
Whereas the [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] and [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] languages clearly show the effects of Verner's law, those patterns seldom appear in [[Gothic language|Gothic]], the representative of [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]]. This is usually thought to be because Gothic eliminated most Verner's law variants through [[Analogy (linguistics)|analogy]] with the unaffected consonants.&lt;ref&gt;R.D.  Fulk, ''[https://www.jbe-platform.com/content/books/9789027263131 A Comparative Grammar  of the Early Germanic Languages]'', Studies in Germanic Linguistics, 3 (Amsterdam: Benjamins, 2018), {{DOI|10.1075/sigl.3}}, {{ISBN|978 90 272 6312 4}}, p. 108-9. {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==
Karl Verner published his discovery in the article &quot;{{lang|de|Eine Ausnahme der ersten Lautverschiebung}}&quot; (an exception to the first sound shift) in Kuhn's ''[[Historische Sprachforschung|Journal of Comparative Linguistic Research]]'' in 1877,&lt;ref&gt;Verner, K. 1877. Eine Ausnahme der ersten Lautverschiebung. ''Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprach-forschung auf dem Gebiete der indo-germanischen Sprachen'', 23.97–130.&lt;/ref&gt; but he had already presented his theory on 1 May 1875 in a comprehensive personal letter to his friend and mentor, [[Vilhelm Thomsen]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}

A letter shows that [[Eduard Sievers]] had hit on the same explanation by 1874, but did not publish it.&lt;ref&gt;R.D.  Fulk, ''[https://www.jbe-platform.com/content/books/9789027263131 A Comparative Grammar  of the Early Germanic Languages]'', Studies in Germanic Linguistics, 3 (Amsterdam: Benjamins, 2018), {{DOI|10.1075/sigl.3}}, {{ISBN|978 90 272 6312 4}}, p. 110, n. 1. {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Verner's theory was received with great enthusiasm by the young generation of comparative philologists, the so-called {{lang|de|Junggrammatiker}}, because it was an important argument in favour of the [[Neogrammarian]] dogma that the [[sound laws]] were without exceptions (&quot;{{lang|de|die Ausnahmslosigkeit der Lautgesetze}}&quot;).

== Dating the change described by Verner's law ==
The change in pronunciation described by Verner's Law must have occurred before the shift of stress to the first syllable: the voicing of the new consonant in Proto-Germanic is conditioned by which syllable is stressed in Proto-Indo-European, yet this syllabic stress has disappeared in Proto-Germanic, so the change in the consonant must have occurred at a time when the syllabic stress in earlier Proto-Germanic still conformed to the Indo-European pattern. However, the syllabic stress shift erased the conditioning environment, and made the variation between voiceless fricatives and their voiced alternants look mysteriously haphazard.

=== Which applied first: Grimm's law or Verner's law? ===
Until recently it was assumed that Verner's law was productive after Grimm's Law, and this remains the standard account: [[R. D. Fulk]]'s 2018 ''Comparative Grammar of the Early Germanic Languages'', for example, finds that 'Grimm's law should be assumed to antecede Verner's law'.&lt;ref&gt;R.D.  Fulk, ''[https://www.jbe-platform.com/content/books/9789027263131 A Comparative Grammar  of the Early Germanic Languages]'', Studies in Germanic Linguistics, 3 (Amsterdam: Benjamins, 2018), {{DOI|10.1075/sigl.3}}, {{ISBN|978 90 272 6312 4}}, p. 111. {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But it has been pointed out that, even if the sequence is reversed, the result can be just the same given certain conditions, and the thesis that Verner's Law might have been valid before Grimm's Law—maybe long before it—has been finding more and more acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Vennemann 1984:21, Kortlandt 1988:5–6, Euler and Badenheuer 2009:54-55 and 61-64.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, this order now would have to be assumed:

# Verner's law (possible boundary for Indo-European/Germanic)
# Grimm's law/First Sound Shift in the late 1st century BC (does '''not''' mark the formation of Germanic accordingly)
# Appearance of initial stress (third possible boundary for Indo-European/Germanic)

This chronological reordering would have far-reaching implications for the shape and development of the Proto-Germanic language. If Verner's law operated before Grimm's law, one would expect the voicing of Proto-Indo-European ''{{PIE|*p}}'', ''{{PIE|*t}}'', ''{{PIE|*k}}'', and {{lang|gem-x-proto|*kʷ}}  to produce ''{{PIE|*b}}'', ''{{PIE|*d}}'', ''{{PIE|*g}}'', and {{lang|gem-x-proto|*gʷ}}, which would have been identical with the existing Proto-Indo-European voiced stops. Yet it is clear that consonants affected by Verner's law merged with the descendants of the Proto-Indo-European voiced aspirate stops, not of the plain voiced stops. The usual proposed explanation for this is to postulate aspiration in the voiceless stops of the dialect of Indo-European that gave rise to Proto-Germanic.

Here is a table describing the sequence of changes in this alternative ordering:

|}
(This can however be bypassed in the [[glottalic theory]] framework, where the voiced aspirate stops are replaced with plain voiced stops, and plain voiced stops with glottalized stops.)

Having Verner's law act before Grimm's law may help explain the little evidence that there is for the earliest Germanic phonology. There is some evidence for dating Grimm's law changes only to the end of the first century BCE. In particular, the tribal name recorded as [[Cimbri]] by the Romans and the river-name recorded as ''Vaculus'' (now known as the [[Waal (river)|Waal]]) suggest that the change from ''k'' to ''h'' had still not happened around the first century BCE, when Romans were rendering those words into Latin (unless they were rendering the early Germanic {{lang|gem-x-proto|*h}} ({{IPA|/x/}}) sound as a {{IPA|/k/}} because their own {{IPA|/h/}} did not often occur between vowels and was at any rate already in the process of going silent). If Grimm's law ''was'' operative only in the first century BCE and Verner's law applied after it (followed in turn by the shift of stress to initial syllables), then three dramatic changes would have had to happen in quick succession. Such a rapid set of language changes seems implausible to some scholars.

Meanwhile, Noske (2012) argues that Grimm's Law and Verner's Law must have been part of a single bifurcating chain shift.

==Areal connections==
An exact parallel to Verner's law is found in the neighboring [[Finnic languages]], where it forms a part of the system of [[consonant gradation]]: a single voiceless consonant (*p, *t, *k, *s) becomes weakened (*b, *d, *g; *h &lt; *z) when occurring after an unstressed syllable. As word stress in Finnic is predictable (primary stress on the initial syllable, secondary stress on odd-numbered non-final syllables), and has remained so since [[Proto-Uralic]], this change did not produce any alternation in the shape of word roots. However, it manifests in the shape of numerous inflectional or derivational suffixes, and is therefore called &quot;suffixal gradation&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}

Lauri Posti argued that suffixal gradation in Finnic represents Germanic influence, in particular reflecting the pronunciation of Proto-Finnic by a hypothetical Germanic-speaking [[superstrate]] (often assumed to account for the great number of Germanic loanwords already in Proto-Finnic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Posti|first=Lauri|date=1953|title=From Pre-Finnic to Late Proto-Finnic|url=|journal=Finnisch-Ugrische Forschungen|volume=XXXI|pages=1–91 (74–82)|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, consonant gradation has also been viewed as inheritance from [[Proto-Uralic]], as it occurs also in other Uralic languages. In particular, suffixal gradation under identical conditions also exists in [[Nganasan language|Nganasan]]. The possibility of the opposite direction of influence – from Finnic to Germanic – has also been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Petri |last=Kallio |year=2000 |chapter=Posti's Superstrate Theory at the Threshold of a New Millennium |editor-first=Johanna |editor-last=Laakso |title=Facing Finnic: Some Challenges to Historical and Contact Linguistics |series=Castrenianumin toimitteita |volume=59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{transport}}

[[File:Transperth 2018 Volgren Optimus bodied Volvo B7RLE diesel Rt. 502.jpg|thumb|A public transport [[bus]] in [[Perth, Western Australia]]]]
'''Road transport''' or '''road transportation''' is a type of transport by using [[road]]s. Transport on roads can be roughly grouped into the transportation of goods and transportation of people. In many countries licensing requirements and safety regulations ensure a separation of the two industries. Movement along roads may be by [[Bicycle|bike]] or [[Car|automobile]], [[truck]], or by [[Pack animal|animal]] such as [[horse]] or [[ox]]en. Standard networks of roads were adopted by [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Persians]], [[Aztec]], and other early [[empire]]s, and may be regarded as a feature of empires. [[Cargo]] may be transported by [[Truck driver|trucking companies]], while passengers may be transported via [[Public transport|mass transit]]. Commonly defined features of modern roads include defined [[lanes]] and [[Traffic sign|signage]]. Various classes of road exist, from two-lane local roads with at-grade [[Intersection (road)|intersection]]s to [[controlled-access highway]]s with all cross traffic grade-separated.

The nature of road transportation of goods depends on, apart from the degree of development of the local infrastructure, on the distance the goods are transported by road, the weight and volume of an individual shipment, and the type of goods transported. For short distances and light, small shipments a [[van]] or [[pickup truck]] may be used. For large shipments even if less than a full truckload a truck is more appropriate. (Also see Trucking and Hauling below). In some countries [[cargo]] is transported by road in horse-drawn carriages, donkey [[cart]]s or other non-motorized mode. Delivery services are sometimes considered a separate category from cargo transport. In many places fast food is transported on roads by various types of [[vehicle]]s. For inner city delivery of small packages and documents [[bike courier]]s are quite common.

People are transported on roads. Special modes of individual transport by road such as [[cycle rickshaw]]s may also be locally available. There are also specialist modes of road transport for particular situations, such as ambulances.

==History==
{{main|History of road transport}}

===Early roads===
[[Image:Metopa Columna lui Traian Constructie drum.jpg|thumb|right|Road construction, depicted on [[Trajan's Column]].]]
The first methods of road transport were [[horse]]s, [[ox]]en or even humans carrying goods over [[Soil|dirt]] tracks that often followed [[Game (food)|game]] [[trail]]. The [[Persian Empire|Persians]] later built a network of [[Royal Road]]s across their empire.

With the advent of the [[Roman Empire]], there was a need for armies to be able to travel quickly from one region to another, and the roads that existed were often muddy, which greatly delayed the movement of [[Roman army|large masses of troops]]. To resolve this issue, the Romans built solid and lasting roads. The [[Roman road]]s used deep roadbeds of crushed stone as an underlying layer to ensure that they kept dry, as the water would flow out from the crushed stone, instead of becoming mud in clay soils. The Islamic [[Caliphate]] later built [[Tarmacadam|tar-paved]] roads in [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanautomove.com/information/road-transportation-a-history-and-how-we-use-it-today/|title=Road Transportation – A History and How We Use it Today|date=30 August 2012|publisher=American Auto Move|accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New road networks===
As states developed and became richer, especially with the [[Renaissance]], new roads and bridges began to be built, often based on Roman designs. Although there were attempts to rediscover Roman methods, there was little useful innovation in road building before the 18th century.
[[File:Highgate wide.jpg|thumb|The [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]] near High gate on the approach to London before [[turnpiking]].  The highway was deeply rutted and spread onto adjoining land.]]

Starting in the early 18th century, the [[British Parliament]] began to pass a series of [[Act of Parliament|acts]] that gave the local justices powers to erect toll-gates on the roads, in exchange for professional upkeep.&lt;ref name=webb157 &gt;Webb. English Local Government. pp. 157-159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Statute, 15 Car. II, c.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The toll-gate erected at Wade's Mill became the first effective toll-gate in England. The first scheme that had trustees who were not justices was established through a Turnpike Act in 1707, for a section of the London-[[Chester, England|Chester]] road between Foothill and [[Stony Stafford]]. The basic principle was that the trustees would manage resources from the several parishes through which the highway passed, augment this with tolls from users from outside the parishes and apply the whole to the maintenance of the main highway. This became the pattern for the turnpiking of a growing number of highways, sought by those who wished to improve flow of commerce through their part of a county.&lt;ref name=webb157 /&gt;

The quality of early turnpike roads was varied.&lt;ref&gt;''Parliamentary Papers'', 1840, Vol 256 xxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Although turnpiking did result in some improvement to each highway, the technologies used to deal with geological features, drainage, and the effects of weather were all in their infancy. [[Road construction]] improved slowly, initially through the efforts of individual surveyors such as [[John Metcalf (civil engineer)|John Metcalf]] in [[Yorkshire]] in the 1760s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoolshistory.org.uk/IndustrialRevolution/transport/roads.htm The Turnpike Trust] Schools History.org, Accessed July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; British turnpike builders began to realize the importance of selecting clean stones for surfacing while excluding vegetable material and clay, resulting in more durable roads.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lay 1992, p72&quot;&gt;Lay (1992), p72{{full|date=October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oxford|first=Robert|title=How old is that route?|publisher=[[Institution of Civil Engineers]]|date=3 September 2003|url=http://www.ice.org.uk/downloads//BS-History_of_Routes.pdf|accessdate=2007-01-19|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213746/http://www.ice.org.uk/downloads//BS-History_of_Routes.pdf|archive-date=27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial civil engineering===
[[File:ThomasTelford.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thomas Telford]], the &quot;Colossus of the Roads&quot; in early 19th century Britain.]] 
By the late 18th and early 19th centuries, new methods of highway construction had been pioneered by the work of three British engineers, [[John Metcalf (civil engineer)|John Metcalf]], [[Thomas Telford]] and [[John Loudon McAdam]], and by the French road engineer [[Pierre-Marie-Jérôme Trésaguet]].

The first professional road builder to emerge during the [[Industrial Revolution]] was [[John Metcalf (civil engineer)|John Metcalf]], who constructed about {{convert|180|mi|km}} of [[turnpike trust|turnpike road]], mainly in the north of England, from 1765. He believed a good road should have good foundations, be well drained and have a smooth [[convex geometry|convex]] surface to allow [[Rain|rainwater]] to drain quickly into ditches at the side. He understood the importance of good drainage, knowing it was rain that caused most problems on the roads.

[[Pierre-Marie-Jérôme Trésaguet]] established the first [[scientific method|scientific approach]] to [[road building]] in France at the same time. He wrote a memorandum on his method in 1775, which became general practice in France. It involved a layer of large rocks, covered by a layer of smaller gravel.  The lower layer improved on Roman practice in that it was based on the understanding that the purpose of this layer (the sub-base or [[base course]]) is to transfer the weight of the road and its traffic to the ground, while protecting the ground from deformation by spreading the weight evenly. Therefore, the sub-base did not have to be a self-supporting structure. The upper running surface provided a smooth surface for vehicles while protecting the large stones of the sub-base.

The surveyor and engineer [[Thomas Telford]] also made substantial advances in the engineering of new roads and the construction of bridges. His method of road building involved the digging of a large trench in which a foundation of heavy rock was set. He also designed his roads so that they sloped downwards from the centre, allowing drainage to take place, a major improvement on the work of Trésaguet. The surface of his roads consisted of broken stone. He also improved on methods for the building of roads by improving the selection of stone based on thickness, taking into account traffic, alignment and slopes. During his later years, Telford was responsible for rebuilding sections of the [[Watling Street|London to Holyhead road]], a task completed by his assistant of ten years, [[John Benjamin Macneill|John MacNeill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mary|last=Bellis|title=Thomas Telford|work=About: inventors|publisher=About, Inc, [[New York Times]]|year=2007|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/tstartinventors/a/Thomas_Telford.htm|accessdate=2007-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Rakeman – First American Macadam Road.jpg|thumb|Construction of the first macadamized road in the United States (1823). In the foreground, workers are breaking stones &quot;so as not to exceed 6 ounces in weight or to pass a two-inch ring&quot;.&lt;ref name=rakemanPainting&gt;[http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/rakeman/1823.htm &quot;1823 - First American Macadam Road&quot;] ''(Painting - [[Carl Rakeman]])'' US Department of Transportation - Federal Highway Administration (Accessed 2008-10-10)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
It was another Scottish engineer, [[John Loudon McAdam]], who designed the first modern roads. He developed an inexpensive paving material of soil and stone aggregate (known as [[macadam]]). His road building method was simpler than Telford's, yet more effective at protecting roadways: he discovered that massive foundations of rock upon rock were unnecessary, and asserted that native soil alone would support the road and traffic upon it, as long as it was covered by a road crust that would protect the soil underneath from water and wear.&lt;ref name=ColossusofRoads&gt;{{citation |author=Craig, David|title=The Colossus of Roads|work=Palimpsest|publisher=Strum.co.uk|url=http://www.strum.co.uk/palimps/macadam.htm|accessdate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also unlike Telford and other road builders, McAdam laid his roads as level as possible. His {{convert|30|ft|m|0|adj=mid|-wide}} road required only a rise of three inches from the edges to the center. Cambering and elevation of the road above the water table enabled rainwater to run off into ditches on either side.&lt;ref name=McAdam1824p38&gt;McAdam (1824), p.38&lt;/ref&gt; Size of stones was central to the McAdam's road building theory. The lower {{convert|200|mm|in|0|adj=on}} road thickness was restricted to stones no larger than {{convert|75|mm|in}}. The upper {{convert|50|mm|in|0|adj=on}} layer of stones was limited to {{convert|20|mm|in|0}} size and stones were checked by supervisors who carried scales. A workman could check the stone size himself by seeing if the stone would fit into his mouth. The importance of the 20&amp;nbsp;mm stone size was that the stones needed to be much smaller than the 100&amp;nbsp;mm width of the iron [[carriage]] [[tyres]] that traveled on the road. Macadam roads were being built widely in the United States and Australia in the 1820s and in Europe in the 1830s and 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;Lay (1992), p83{{full|date=October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
Macadam roads were adequate for use by horses and carriages or coaches, but they were very dusty and subject to erosion with heavy rain. The [[Good Roads Movement]] occurred in the United States between the late 1870s and the 1920s. Advocates for improved roads led by bicyclists turned local agitation into a national political movement.

Outside cities, roads were dirt or gravel; mud in the winter and dust in the summer. Early organizers cited Europe where [[road construction]] and maintenance was supported by national and local governments. In its early years, the main goal of the movement was education for road building in [[Rural America|rural areas]] between cities and to help rural populations gain the social and economic benefits enjoyed by cities where citizens benefited from railroads, trolleys and paved streets. Even more than traditional vehicles, the newly invented bicycles could benefit from good country roads. Later on, they did not hold up to higher-speed motor vehicle use. Methods to stabilise [[Macadam|macadam roads]] with tar date back to at least 1834 when John Henry Cassell, operating from ''Cassell's Patent Lava Stone Works'' in [[Millwall]], patented &quot;Pitch Macadam&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=46514 From: 'Northern Millwall: Tooke Town', Survey of London: volumes 43 and 44: Poplar, Blackwall and Isle of Dogs (1994), pp. 423-433] Date accessed: 24 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
This method involved spreading tar on the [[subgrade]], placing a typical macadam layer, and finally sealing the macadam with a mixture of tar and sand. Tar-grouted macadam was in use well before 1900 and involved scarifying the surface of an existing macadam pavement, spreading tar, and re-compacting. Although the use of tar in road construction was known in the 19th century, it was little used and was not introduced on a large scale until the motorcar arrived on the scene in the early 20th century.

Modern tarmac was patented by British civil engineer [[Edgar Purnell Hooley]], who noticed that spilled tar on the roadway kept the dust down and created a smooth surface.&lt;ref name=Morton2002&gt;{{citation |year=2002 |author=Ralph Morton|title=Construction UK: Introduction to the Industry| place=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell Science|page=51 |isbn=0-632-05852-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cW4CRawd1TgC&amp;q=%22Edgar+Hooley%22&amp;pg=PA51|accessdate=22 June 2010}}. (Details of this story vary a bit, but the essence of is the same, as are the basic facts).&lt;/ref&gt; He took out a patent in 1901 for tarmac.&lt;ref name=Harrison2004&gt;{{citation |year=2004 |author=Harrison, Ian|title=The Book of Inventions |place=Washington, DC |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |page=277 |isbn=978-0-7922-8296-9  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n4NGAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Tarmac+1902+Edgar+Purnell+Hooley+(England)+Patent+no:+GB+7796/1902+%26+US%22|accessdate=23 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trucking companies (AE) or haulage companies / hauliers (BE) accept [[cargo]] for road transport. [[Truck driver]]s operate either independently – working directly for the client – or through freight carriers or shipping agents. Some big companies (e.g. grocery store chains) operate their own internal trucking operations. The market size for general freight trucking was nearly $125 billion in 2010.

In the U.S. many truckers own their [[truck]] (rig), and are known as [[owner-operator]]s. Some road transportation is done on regular routes or for only one [[consignee]] per run, while others transport goods from many different loading stations/shippers to various consignees. On some long runs only cargo for one leg of the route (to) is known when the cargo is loaded. Truckers may have to wait at the destination for a [[Backhaul (trucking)|backhaul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transport-bbhandel.de/en/road-freight/blog/truck-freight-nothing-easier-than|title=What is a backhaul?|last=Brown|first=Dennis|publisher=Freight Broker Bootcamp|accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[bill of lading]] issued by the shipper provides the basic document for road freight. On cross-[[border]] transportation the trucker will present the cargo and documentation provided by the shipper to [[customs]] for inspection (for EC see also [[Schengen Agreement]]). This also applies to shipments that are transported out of a [[List of free ports|free port]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freightbrokerbootcamp.com/blog/what-is-a-backhaul/|title=Truck freight - nothing easier than|last=Bartsch|first=Frank|date=4 June 2013|publisher=BB Handel|accessdate=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hours of service===
To avoid accidents caused by fatigue, truckers have to adhere to strict rules for drive time and required rest periods. In the United States and Canada, these regulations are known as [[hours of service]], and in the European Union as [[drivers working hours]]. One such regulation is the [[Hours of Work and Rest Periods (Road Transport) Convention, 1979]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/transport/road/index_en.htm|title=What do we want to achieve ?|date=19 June 2012|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=11 September 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315230823/http://ec.europa.eu/transport/road/index_en.htm|archive-date=15 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tachograph]]s or [[Electronic on-board recorder]]s record the times the vehicle is in motion and stopped. Some companies use two drivers per truck to ensure uninterrupted transportation; with one driver resting or sleeping in a bunk in the back of the cab while the other is driving.

===Licenses===
Truck drivers often need special licenses to drive, known in the U.S. as a [[commercial driver's license]]. In the U.K. a [[large goods vehicle]] licence is required. For transport of hazardous materials (see [[dangerous goods]]) truckers need a licence, which usually requires them to pass an exam (e.g. in the EU). They have to make sure they affix proper labels for the respective hazard(s) to their vehicle. Liquid goods are transported by road in [[tank truck]]s (AE) or tanker lorries (BE) (also road-tankers) or special tank containers for [[Intermodal freight transport|intermodal transport]]. For transportation of live animals special requirements have to be met in many countries to prevent cruelty to animals (see [[animal rights]]). For fresh and frozen goods [[refrigerator truck]]s or [[reefer (container)|reefers]] are used.

===Weights===
Some loads are weighed at the point of origin and the driver is responsible for ensuring [[Gross vehicle weight rating|weights]] conform to maximum allowed standards. This may involve using on-board weight gauges (load pressure gauges), knowing the empty weight of the transport vehicle and the weight of the load, or using a commercial weight scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catscale.com/about/|title=About CAT Scale|publisher=CAT Scale|accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In route [[weigh station]]s check that gross vehicle weights do not exceed the maximum weight for that particular jurisdiction and will include individual axle weights. This varies by country, states within a country, and may include federal standards. The [[United States]] uses [[Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration|FMCSA federal standards]] that include [[bridge law]] [[Federal Bridge Gross Weight Formula|formulas]]. Many states, not on the national road system, use their own road and bridge standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freight/policy/rpt_congress/truck_sw_laws/index.htm|title=Freight Management and Operations|last=Foxx|first=Anthony R.|date=2012-10-01|publisher=US Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration|accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enforcement scales may include portable scales, scale houses with low speed scales or [[Weigh in motion|weigh-in-motion]] (WIM) scales.

The [[European Union]] uses the ''International Recommendation'', OIML R 134-2 (2009). The process may involve a scale house and low-speed scales or higher speed WIM road or bridge scales with the goal of public safety, as well as road and bridge safety, according to the [[Bridges Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oiml.org/en/files/pdf_r/r134-2-e09.pdf|title=International Recommendation (OIML R 134-2|date=2009|publisher=International Organization of Legal Metrology|accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern roads==

Today, roadways are primarily [[asphalt]] or [[concrete]]. Both are based on McAdam's concept of stone aggregate in a binder, asphalt cement or [[Portland cement]] respectively. Asphalt is known as a flexible [[Pavement (material)|pavement]], one which slowly will &quot;flow&quot; under the pounding of traffic. Concrete is a rigid pavement, which can take heavier loads but is more expensive and requires more carefully prepared subbase. So, generally, major roads are concrete and local roads are asphalt. Concrete roads are often covered with a thin layer of asphalt to create a wearing surface.

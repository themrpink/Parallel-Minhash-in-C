'''''Notes on Muscovite Affairs''''' (''Rerum Moscoviticarum Commentarii'') (1549) was a [[Latin]] book by Baron [[Sigismund von Herberstein]] on the geography, history and customs of [[Muscovy]] (the 16th century Russian state). The book was the main early source of knowledge about Russia in Western Europe.

==Background==

Herberstein was an Austrian diplomat who was twice sent to Russia as [[Austria]]n ambassador, in 1517 and 1526. Born in [[Vipava, Slovenia|Vipava]] ([[German language|German]] ''Wippach''), [[Carniola]], he was familiar with [[Slovene language|Slovene]], a [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] language, which became important later on his mission in Russia, when he was able to communicate with ordinary [[Russians]] in [[Slovene language|Slovene]], another [[Slavic languages|Slavic language]].

These visits occurred at a time when very little was known about Russia outside the region. The few published descriptions of Russia were in some cases wildly inaccurate.

==Historical note on Muscovy and Russia==

''[[Muscovy]]'' in the 16th century was the Russian state which separated itself from the [[Kievan Rus']] after it fell apart. It evolved into the [[Russian Empire]] under [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] starting at the end of the 17th century. Russia was the region, Muscovy was the state until it no longer included just Moscow. Muscovy was then ruled by the Muscovite monarchy, starting with [[Ivan III]] (1462–1505), who expanded Muscovy, and ending with [[Ivan IV]], who claimed the title &quot;Tsar of Russia&quot;.

In this article, ''Russia'' and ''Muscovy'' are treated as similar entities. In land area there is not much difference between Muscovy and Russia west of the [[Ural Mountains]]. Herberstein wrote about ''Muscovy'' (region based on Moscow) because that is what it was known as in the West then. We know the area as ''Russia'', so that is how it is referred to here.

==Research==

Herberstein developed a keen interest in all things Russian, and researched in several ways:
* using his knowledge of Slavic, he questioned a variety of people on a wide range of topics.
* careful review of existing publications on Russia, comparing what he read with his own observations. He viewed most publications skeptically, because he knew that most of the authors had not been able to actually visit Russia.
* corroboration. He was careful to make sure not to accept anything that was not well corroborated. As he wrote, he ''&quot;did not rely upon this or that man's account, but trusted only to the unvarying statements of many.&quot;''
* investigation of Russian written publications, which provided him with information on Russian culture completely unavailable at the time in Europe.

==The Book==

As a result, Herberstein was able to produce the first detailed eyewitness ethnography of Russia, encyclopedic in its scope, providing an accurate (very accurate for the time) view of trade, religion, customs, politics, history, even a theory of Russian political culture.

The book contributed greatly to a European view held for several centuries of Russia as a despotic absolute monarchy. This view was not new, but previous writers presented an idealized view. Herberstein influenced the development of this view in two ways:
* he accentuated the absolute power of the monarchy even more than previous works had done. Writing about the Russian Tsar, Herberstein wrote that ''&quot;in the power he holds over his people the ruler of Muscovy surpasses all the monarchs of the world.&quot;'' 
* he presented a view of Russian political culture quite opposite to that argued by other writers. Where others claimed Russians were fanatically loyal to their ruler and treated in return with great fairness, Herberstein saw and wrote differently.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Gontsyutromvkremle.jpg|thumb|250px|''Arrival of heralds to the Kremlin''.]] --&gt;
His investigations made it clear that Muscovy, contrary to the view of fanatical loyalty, had suffered a violent political struggle and that Muscovy had emerged only very recently as the dominant power in the region. What's more, the man who achieved the unification of Muscovy, [[Ivan III]] was characterized by Herberstein as a cruel tyrant, drunk, and a misogynist; far from being a ruler of great fairness and equity.

His description of Ivan's unification campaign was a series of banishments and forced relocations of whole populations to break the power of regional rulers. This culminated in, as Herberstein wrote, Ivan's ''&quot;plan of ejecting all princes and others from the garrisons and fortified places&quot;'' all the formerly independent princes of Russia, ''&quot;being either moved by the grandeur of his achievements or stricken with fear, became subject to him.&quot;'' All very much at odds with previous perceived reality, but much closer to currently understood Russian history. Similarly the previously touted ideal of the fairness of the Muscovy monarchy was contrasted with Herberstein's depiction of peasants as being in ''&quot;a very wretched condition, for their goods are exposed to plunder from the nobility and soldiery&quot;''.

==Tsar vs Czar==

One final thing for which Herberstein and his book was noted, though not widely understood, was his contribution to a spelling confusion which did not emerge until the end of the 19th century and still causes disagreement: he recorded the spelling of &quot;[[tsar]]&quot; (Russian ''царь'', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|pronounced]] [t͡sɑrʲ]) as ''czar''. This may cause confusion nowadays because the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] &lt;cz&gt; is today only used in the [[Polish language]] and is there pronounced as [t͡ʃ]. However, [[Early Modern German|early modern German]] (as Herberstain spoke and wrote it) and furthermore also pre-20th century [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] or the '[[Mazurzenie|mazurizing]]' dialects of Polish used &lt;cz&gt; for [t͡s]. Contrary to what the &lt;cz&gt; might suggest, all [[Slavonic languages]] pronounce the title &quot;tsar&quot; with [t͡s], which is always written with a simple &lt;c&gt;, in Latin-writing Slavic languages as well as in the transliterations of Cyrillic-writing ones. English and French moved from the &lt;cz&gt; spelling to the &lt;ts&gt; spelling in the 19th century.

==English translations==

[[Marshall Poe]], who has written extensively on Herberstein and Russian history generally, uses the English title ''Notes on the Muscovites'' consistently when translating the Latin title. A slightly more precise English translation of the Latin title would be ''Notes on Muscovite Affairs'', as used for this article. There are one partial and two complete English translations of this work, the most recent one, by J. B. C. Grundy, based itself on a German version.

{{History of Portugal}}

The '''history of Portugal''' can be traced from circa 400,000 years ago, when the region of present-day [[Portugal]] was inhabited by [[Homo heidelbergensis]]. The oldest human fossil is the skull discovered in the [[Cave of Aroeira]] in [[Almonda]]. Later [[Neanderthal]]s roamed the northern Iberian peninsula. [[Homo sapiens]] arrived in Portugal around 35,000 years ago.

Pre-Celtic tribes such as [[Lusitanians]], [[Turduli]] and [[Oestriminis]] lived in the centre and north. In the south the [[Cynetes]] lived in the Algarve and Lower Alentejo regions before the 6th century BC, developed the city of [[Tartessos]] and the written [[Tartessian language]], and left many [[stelae]] in the south of the country. Early in the first millennium BC, waves of [[Celts]] from [[Central Europe]] invaded and intermarried with the local populations to form several ethnic groups and many tribes. 
Their presence is traceable, in broad outline, through archaeological and linguistic evidence. They dominated the northern and central area, while the south retained much of its [[Tartessos|Tartessian]] character, combined with the [[Celtici]] until the Roman conquest. Some small, semi-permanent trading settlements were founded by Phoenician-Carthaginians on the southern coast of the Algarve.

The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] invasion in the 3rd century BC lasted several centuries, and developed the Roman provinces of [[Lusitania]] in the south and [[Gallaecia]] in the north. Numerous Roman sites include works of engineering, baths, temples, bridges, roads, circuses, theatres, layman's homes, coins, sarcophagi, and ceramics. As elsewhere in [[Western Europe]], there was a sharp decline in urban life during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] following the fall of Rome. 
Germanic tribes (that the Romans referred to as [[Barbarian]]s) controlled the territory between the 5th and 8th centuries. These included the [[Kingdom of the Suebi]] centred in Braga and the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] in the south. Eventually the Visigoths seized power in the whole of Iberia.
Under the [[Visigoths]] a new class emerged, a [[nobility]], which played a tremendous social and political role during the [[Middle Ages]], and also began to play a very important part within the state, but since the Visigoths did not know Latin, the Catholic bishops continued the Roman system of governance. The [[clergy]] started to emerge as a high-ranking class.

In 711-716 an invasion by the Islamic [[Umayyad Caliphate]], comprising [[Berber people|Berbers]] from [[North Africa]] and [[Arab|Arabs]] from the [[Middle East]] plus other Muslims from all around the Islamic world, conquered the Visigoth Kingdom and founded the Islamic State of [[Al-Andalus]]. The Umayyads reigned supreme and advanced through Iberia and France until the [[Battle of Tours]] (732) and endured in the south until the final reconquista of the [[Algarve]]([[Gharb Al-Andalus]]) in 1294. 
Lisbon and the rest of what would become Portugal, was reconquered by the early 12th century. At the end of the 9th century, a county based in the area of [[Portus Cale]] was established under King [[Alfonso III of Asturias]], and by the 10th century, the Counts were known as the ''Magnus Dux Portucalensium'' (Grand Duke of the Portuguese). (''Portucale'', ''Portugale'', ''Portugalliæ'') The [[Kingdom of Asturias]] was later divided so that northern &quot;Portugal&quot; became part of the [[Kingdom of León]].

Initially a vassal of the Kingdom of León, Portugal grew in power and territory and gained ''de facto'' independence during weak Leonese reigns. In 1071 Garcia II of Galicia was declared [[King of Portugal]] and in 1095, Portugal broke away from the [[Kingdom of Galicia]]. At the end of the 11th century, the Burgundian knight [[Henry, count of Portugal|Henry]] became count of Portugal and defended its independence by merging the [[County of Portugal]] and the [[County of Coimbra]]. Henry's son [[Afonso I of Portugal|Afonso Henriques]] proclaimed himself ''Prince of Portugal'' on 24 June 1128 and King of Portugal in 1139 with Guimarães (Vimarens) as capital. In 1179 a papal bull officially recognised Afonso I as king. The Algarve was conquered from the [[Moors]] in 1249, and in 1255 [[Lisbon]] became the capital. Portugal's land boundaries have remained almost unchanged since then. 

During the reign of King [[John I of Portugal|John I]], the Portuguese defeated the [[Castilians]] in a war over the throne (1385) and established a political alliance with [[Kingdom of England|England]] (by the [[Treaty of Windsor (1386)|Treaty of Windsor]] in 1386) that has endured and continued to the present day. This is the world's oldest military agreement between two sovereign nations.

From the late [[Middle Ages]], in the 15th and 16th centuries, [[Portugal]] ascended to the status of a [[Great power|world power]] during Europe's &quot;[[Age of Discovery]]&quot; as it [[Portuguese Empire|built up a vast empire]], including possessions in South America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. Over the following two centuries, Portugal kept most of its colonies, but gradually lost much of its wealth and status as the Dutch, English, and French took an increasing share of the [[Spice trade|spice]] and [[History of slavery|slave trades]] by surrounding or conquering the widely scattered Portuguese trading posts and territories. Signs of military decline began with two disastrous battles: the [[Battle of Alcácer Quibir]] in Morocco in 1578 and Spain's abortive attempt to conquer England in 1588 by means of the [[Spanish Armada]] – Portugal was then in an uncomfortable [[Iberian Union|dynastic union with Spain]] and contributed ships to the Spanish invasion fleet. The country was further weakened by the destruction of much of its capital city in an [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|earthquake in 1755]], occupation during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the loss of its largest colony, [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]], in 1822. From the middle of the 19th century to the late 1950s, nearly two
million [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] left Portugal to live in Brazil and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?ID=77 |title=Portugal Seeks Balance of Emigration, Immigration |publisher=Migrationinformation.org |date=2002-08-09 |access-date=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, there was a revolution that deposed the monarchy. Amid corruption, repression of the church, and the near-bankruptcy of the state, a military coup in 1926 installed a dictatorship that remained until another coup in 1974. The new government instituted sweeping [[democracy|democratic]] reforms and granted independence to all of Portugal's African colonies in 1975. Portugal is a founding member of the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), and the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA). It entered the [[European Economic Community]] (now the [[European Union]]) in 1986.

== Etymology ==&lt;!--linked--&gt;

The word Portugal derives from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]-[[Celts|Celtic]] place name '''''[[Portus Cale]]'''''. Cale or [[Cailleach]] was the name of a Celtic deity&lt;ref&gt;Cale, the mother goddess of the Celtic people, the one who armed with a hammer formed mountains and valleys. She hides in the rocks. She is Mother Nature. Her other name is Cailleach (Gallaecia/Galiza)&lt;/ref&gt; and the name of an early settlement located at the mouth of the [[Douro River]] (present-day [[Vila Nova de Gaia]]), which flows into the Atlantic Ocean in the north of what is now Portugal. Around 200 BC, the Romans took the [[Iberian Peninsula]] from the Carthaginians during the [[Second Punic War]], and in the process conquered Cale and renamed it ''Portus Cale'' (''Port of Cale''). During the [[Middle Ages]], the region around ''Portus Cale'' became known by the [[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]] as '''''Portucale'''''.

The name ''Portucale'' evolved into '''''Portugale''''' during the 7th and 8th centuries, and by the 9th century, that term was used extensively to refer to the region between the rivers Douro and [[Minho River|Minho]], the Minho flowing along what would become the northern [[Portugal–Spain border]]. By the 11th and 12th centuries, ''Portugale'' was already referred to as '''Portugal'''.

The etymology of ''Cale'' points to Cale&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=apcmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=lisbon+etymology&amp;pg=PA160 |title=Local etymology: a derivative ... – Google Books |access-date=2010-08-22|year=1859|last1=Charnock |first1=Richard Stephen }}&lt;/ref&gt; being a [[Celts|Celtic]] name, like many others found in the region. The word ''cale'' or ''cala'' meant &quot;port&quot;, an &quot;inlet&quot; or &quot;harbour&quot;, referring to an older Celtic harbour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=POGEbFpGHigC&amp;q=celtic+cale+harbour&amp;pg=RA1-PA270 |title=Celtic Linguistics |access-date=2010-08-22|isbn=978-0-415-20479-8|year=1706|last1=Pezron |first1=Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today's Gaelic word for harbour is still ''cala''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faclair.com/?txtSearch=Cala|title=Am Faclair Beag – Scottish Gaelic Dictionary|first=William Robertson, Michael Bauer, Edward|last=Dwelly|website=www.faclair.com|access-date=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue it is the stem of Gallaecia, again of Celtic derivation. Another theory claims it derives from the word ''Caladunum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/dictionarygreek08smitgoog |page=[https://archive.org/details/dictionarygreek08smitgoog/page/n501 477] |quote=Cale,  name  Porto greek. |title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography |publisher=Walton and Maberly |access-date=2010-08-22|year=1856|last1=Smith |first1=Sir William }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, the particle ''Portu'' in the word ''Portucale'' was used as the basis of ''[[Porto]]'', the modern name for the city located on the site of the ancient city of Cale at the mouth of the Douro River. And ''[[port wine|port]]'' became the English name of the wine actually produced further inland, in the Upper Douro Valley region, but exported through Porto. The name ''Cale'' is today reflected in ''Gaia'' ([[Vila Nova de Gaia]]), a city on the south bank of the river.

Pre-Celtic tribes inhabited Portugal leaving a remarkable cultural footprint. The [[Cynetes]] developed a written language, leaving many stelae, which are mainly found in the south of Portugal.

Early in the first millennium BC, several waves of [[Celts]] invaded Portugal from Central Europe and intermarried with the local populations to form several different ethnic groups, with many tribes. The Celtic presence in Portugal is traceable, in broad outline, through archaeological and linguistic evidence. They dominated much of northern and central Portugal; but in the south, they were unable to establish their stronghold, which retained its non-Indo-European character until the Roman conquest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Disney|2009|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In southern Portugal, some small, semi-permanent commercial coastal settlements were also founded by Phoenician-Carthaginians.

Numerous [[pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula]] inhabited the territory when a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] invasion occurred in the 3rd century BC. The [[Romanization of Hispania]] took several centuries. The Roman provinces that covered present-day Portugal were [[Lusitania]] in the south and [[Gallaecia]] in the north.

Numerous Roman sites are scattered around present-day Portugal. Some of the urban remains are quite large, such as [[Conímbriga]] and [[Miróbriga]]. Several works of engineering, such as baths, temples, bridges, roads, circuses, theatres, and layman's homes are preserved throughout the country. Coins, sarcophagi, and ceramics are also numerous.

Following the fall of Rome, the [[Kingdom of the Suebi]] and the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] controlled the territory between the 5th and 8th centuries.

== Romanization ==
{{Further|Roman conquest of Hispania|Romanization of Hispania}}
[[File:Portugalliaingallaeciaetlusitania.png|thumb|The Roman Provinces [[Lusitania]] and [[Gallaecia]], after the reorganization of [[Diocletian]] AD 298]]

Romanization began with the arrival of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] army in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in 218 BC during the [[Second Punic War]] against [[Carthage]]. The Romans sought to conquer [[Lusitania]], a territory that included all of modern Portugal south of the [[Douro]] river and Spanish [[Extremadura]], with its capital at [[Emerita Augusta]] (now [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;infopedia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infopedia.pt/$romanizacao-da-peninsula-iberica|title=Artigo de apoio Infopédia – Romanização da Península Ibérica|last=Infopédia|website=Infopédia – Dicionários Porto Editora|access-date=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mining was the primary factor that made the Romans interested in conquering the region: one of Rome's strategic objectives was to cut off Carthaginian access to the Iberian copper, tin, gold, and silver mines. The Romans intensely exploited the [[Aljustrel]] (Vipasca) and [[Santo Domingo]] mines in the [[Iberian Pyrite Belt]] which extends to [[Seville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portugalromano.com/category/tema-exploracao-mineira/|title=HugeDomains.com – PortugalRomano.com is for sale (Portugal Romano)|website=www.portugalromano.com|access-date=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the south of what is now Portugal was relatively easily occupied by the Romans, the conquest of the north was achieved only with difficulty due to resistance from [[Serra da Estrela]] by [[Celts]] and [[Lusitanians]] led by [[Viriatus]], who managed to resist [[Roman expansion]] for years.&lt;ref name=&quot;infopedia&quot; /&gt; Viriatus, a shepherd from Serra da Estrela who was expert in [[guerrilla tactics]], waged relentless war against the Romans, defeating several successive Roman generals, until he was assassinated in 140 BC by traitors bought by the Romans. Viriatus has long been hailed as the first truly heroic figure in proto-Portuguese history. Nonetheless, he was responsible for raids into the more settled Romanized parts of Southern Portugal and Lusitania that involved the victimization of the inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;infopedia&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Disney|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

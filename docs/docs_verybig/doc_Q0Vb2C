====Relationship with medical conditions====
There is evidence that certain medical conditions (normally only neurological conditions) can impact dreams. For instance, some people with [[synesthesia]] have never reported entirely black-and-white dreaming, and often have a difficult time imagining the idea of dreaming in only black and white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Synaesthesia: The Strangest Thing |last=Harrison |first=John E. |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-263245-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
{{Main|Dream interpretation}}
[[File:Taras Shevchenko painting 0019.jpg|thumb|right|An artist's painting of a dream.]]

=== Common interpretations ===
Dream interpretation can be a result of subjective ideas and experiences. One study&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; found that most people believe that &quot;their dreams reveal meaningful hidden truths&quot;. In one study&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 2009. Vol 96, No 2, 249–264&lt;/ref&gt; conducted in the United States, South Korea and India, they found that 74% of Indians, 65% of South Koreans and 56% of Americans believed their dream content provided them with meaningful insight into their unconscious beliefs and desires. This Freudian view of dreaming was believed by the largely non-scientific public significantly more than theories of dreaming that attribute dream content to memory consolidation, problem-solving, or random brain activity.

=== Importance ===
In the paper, Morewedge and Norton (2009) also found that people attribute more importance to dream content than to similar thought content that occurs while they are awake. In one study, Americans were more likely to report that they would miss their flight if they dreamt of their plane crashing than if they thought of their plane crashing the night before flying (while awake), and that they would be as likely to miss their flight if they dreamt of their plane crashing the night before their flight as if there was an actual plane crash on the route they intended to take.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Not all dream content was considered equally important. Participants in their studies were more likely to perceive dreams to be meaningful when the content of dreams was in accordance with their beliefs and desires while awake. People were more likely to view a positive dream about a friend to be meaningful than a positive dream about someone they disliked, for example, and were more likely to view a negative dream about a person they disliked as meaningful than a negative dream about a person they liked.

=== Other ===
Therapy for recurring [[nightmare]]s (often associated with [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]) can include imagining alternative scenarios that could begin at each step of the dream.&lt;ref name=&quot;npr&quot;/&gt;

==Other associated phenomena==

===Incorporation of reality===
During the night, many external stimuli may bombard the senses, but the brain often interprets the stimulus and makes it a part of a dream to ensure continued sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=1993 |title=Characteristics of Dreams |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Sleep and Dreaming |last=Antrobus |first=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dream incorporation is a phenomenon whereby an actual sensation, such as environmental sounds, is incorporated into dreams, such as hearing a phone ringing in a dream while it is ringing in reality or dreaming of [[urination]] while [[Nocturnal enuresis|wetting]] the bed. The mind can, however, awaken an individual if they are in danger or if trained to respond to certain sounds, such as a baby crying.

The term &quot;dream incorporation&quot; is also used in research examining the degree to which preceding daytime events become elements of dreams. Recent studies suggest that events in the day immediately preceding, and those about a week before, have the most influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;day-residue&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Geneviève Alain, MPs |author2=Tore A. Nielsen, PhD |author3=Russell Powell, PhD |author4=Don Kuiken, PhD |url=http://www.asdreams.org/2003/abstracts/genevieve_alain.htm |title=Replication of the Day-residue and Dream-lag Effect |date=July 2003 |work=20th Annual International Conference of the Association for the Study of Dreams |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030416200751/http://www.asdreams.org/2003/abstracts/genevieve_alain.htm |archive-date=2003-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Alan Fine and Laura Fischer Leighton argue that “dreams are external to the individual mind” because “1) dreams are not willed by the individual self; 2) dreams reflect social reality; 3) dreams are public rhetoric; and 4) dreams are collectively interpretable.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Fine|first1=Gary Alan|last2=Leighton|first2=Laura Fischer|date=1993-01-01|title=Nocturnal Omissions: Steps Toward a Sociology of Dreams|jstor=10.1525/si.1993.16.2.95|journal=Symbolic Interaction|volume=16|issue=2|pages=95–104|doi=10.1525/si.1993.16.2.95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apparent precognition of real events===
{{Main|Precognition}}

According to surveys, it is common for people to feel their dreams are predicting subsequent life events.&lt;ref name=&quot;hines&quot;/&gt; Psychologists have explained these experiences in terms of [[List of memory biases|memory biases]], namely a selective memory for accurate predictions and distorted memory so that dreams are retrospectively fitted onto life experiences.&lt;ref name=&quot;hines&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Hines |first= Terence |title=Pseudoscience and the Paranormal |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=2003 |pages=78–81 |isbn=978-1-57392-979-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The multi-faceted nature of dreams makes it easy to find connections between dream content and real events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilovich |first=Thomas |title=How We Know What Isn't So: the fallibility of human reason in everyday life |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |year=1991 |pages= 177–180 |isbn=978-0-02-911706-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;veridical dream&quot; has been used to indicate dreams that reveal or contain truths not yet known to the dreamer, whether future events or secrets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.llewellyn.com/encyclopedia/term/Veridical+Dream|title=Llewellyn Worldwide – Encyclopedia: Term: Veridical Dream|website=www.llewellyn.com|access-date=2016-10-16|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018202429/http://www.llewellyn.com/encyclopedia/term/Veridical+Dream|archive-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one experiment, subjects were asked to write down their dreams in a diary. This prevented the selective memory effect, and the dreams no longer seemed accurate about the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alcock |first=James E. |title=Parapsychology: Science or Magic?: a psychological perspective |publisher=Pergamon Press |location=Oxford |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-08-025773-0}} via {{cite book |last=Hines |first=Terence |title= Pseudoscience and the Paranormal |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=2003 |pages=78–81 |isbn=978-1-57392-979-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another experiment gave subjects a fake diary of a student with apparently precognitive dreams. This diary described events from the person's life, as well as some predictive dreams and some non-predictive dreams. When subjects were asked to recall the dreams they had read, they remembered more of the successful predictions than unsuccessful ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Madey |first=Scott |author2=Thomas Gilovich |title=Effects of Temporal Focus on the Recall of Expectancy-Consistent and Expectancy-Inconsistent Information |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=65 |issue=3 |year=1993 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.65.3.458 |pages=458–468 |pmid=8410650}} via {{cite book |last=Kida |first=Thomas |title=Don't Believe Everything You Think: The 6 Basic Mistakes We Make in Thinking |year=2006 |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-1-59102-408-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/dontbelieveevery00kida }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lucid dreaming===
{{Main|Lucid dreaming}}

Lucid dreaming is the conscious perception of one's state while dreaming. In this state the dreamer may often have some degree of control over their own actions within the dream or even the characters and the environment of the dream. Dream control has been reported to improve with practiced deliberate lucid dreaming, but the ability to control aspects of the dream is not necessary for a dream to qualify as &quot;lucid&quot; — a lucid dream is any dream during which the dreamer knows they are dreaming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychwww.com/asc/ld/faq.html Lucid dreaming FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313100513/http://www.psychwww.com/asc/ld/faq.html |date=2007-03-13 }} by [[The Lucidity Institute]] at Psych Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The occurrence of lucid dreaming has been scientifically verified.&lt;ref name= Watanabe2003&gt;{{cite journal |author=Watanabe, T. |year=2003 |title=Lucid Dreaming: Its Experimental Proof and Psychological Conditions |journal=J Int Soc Life Inf Sci |volume=21 |issue=1 |issn=1341-9226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Oneironaut]]'' is a term sometimes used for those who lucidly dream.

====Communication through lucid dreaming====
In 1975, psychologist Keith Hearne successfully recorded a communication from a dreamer experiencing a lucid dream. On April 12, 1975, after agreeing to move his eyes left and right upon becoming lucid, the subject and Hearne's co-author on the resulting article, Alan Worsley, successfully carried out this task.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lucid dream communication&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.keithhearne.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/RECHTSCHAFFEN.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-10-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426081653/http://www.keithhearne.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/RECHTSCHAFFEN.pdf |archive-date=2012-04-26 }}, Lucid Dream Communication&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, psychophysiologist Stephen LaBerge conducted similar work including:
* Using eye signals to map the subjective sense of time in dreams.
* Comparing the electrical activity of the brain while singing awake and while dreaming.
* Studies comparing in-dream sex, arousal, and orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;LaBerge, S. (2014). Lucid dreaming: Paradoxes of dreaming consciousness. In E. Cardeña, S. Lynn, S. Krippner (Eds.), Varieties of anomalous experience: Examining the scientific evidence (2nd ed.) (pp. 145–173). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. {{DOI|10.1037/14258-006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Communication between two dreamers has also been documented. The processes involved included [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] monitoring, ocular signaling, incorporation of reality in the form of red light stimuli and a coordinating website. The website tracked when both dreamers were dreaming and sent the stimulus to one of the dreamers where it was incorporated into the dream. This dreamer, upon becoming lucid, signaled with eye movements; this was detected by the website whereupon the stimulus was sent to the second dreamer, invoking incorporation into this dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2012/11/08/saying-hi-through-a-dream-how-the-internet-could-make-sleeping-more-social/#2eb99101590c|title=Saying 'Hi' Through A Dream: How The Internet Could Make Sleeping More Social|last=Olson|first=Parmy|website=Forbes|access-date=2016-04-24|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531010710/http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2012/11/08/saying-hi-through-a-dream-how-the-internet-could-make-sleeping-more-social/#2eb99101590c|archive-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Absent-minded transgression===
Dreams of absent-minded transgression (DAMT) are dreams wherein the dreamer absentmindedly performs an action that he or she has been trying to stop (one classic example is of a quitting smoker having dreams of lighting a cigarette). Subjects who have had DAMT have reported waking with intense feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. One study found a positive association between having these dreams and successfully stopping the behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hajek P, Belcher M |title=Dream of absent-minded transgression: an empirical study of a cognitive withdrawal symptom |journal=J Abnorm Psychol |volume=100 |issue=4 |pages= 487–91 |year=1991 |pmid=1757662 |doi=10.1037/0021-843X.100.4.487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recall===
The recollection of dreams is extremely unreliable, though it is a skill that can be trained. Dreams can usually be recalled if a person is awakened while dreaming.&lt;ref name=&quot;npr&quot;/&gt; Women tend to have more frequent dream recall than men.&lt;ref name=&quot;npr&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15778923 |title=The Science Behind Dreams and Nightmares |publisher=Npr.org |access-date=April 4, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822180530/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15778923 |archive-date=August 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dreams that are difficult to recall may be characterized by relatively little [[affect (psychology)|affect]], and factors such as [[salience (neuroscience)|salience]], [[arousal]], and interference play a role in dream recall. Often, a dream may be recalled upon viewing or hearing a random trigger or stimulus. The ''salience hypothesis'' proposes that dream content that is salient, that is, novel, intense, or unusual, is more easily remembered. There is considerable evidence that vivid, intense, or unusual dream content is more frequently recalled.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0191-8869(02)00114-9|title=To dream, perchance to remember: Individual differences in dream recall|year=2003|last1=Watson|first1=David|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=34|issue=7|pages=1271–1286}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[dream journal]] can be used to assist dream recall, for personal interest or [[psychotherapy]] purposes.

For some people, sensations from the previous night's dreams are sometimes spontaneously experienced in falling asleep. However they are usually too slight and fleeting to allow dream recall. At least 95% of all dreams are not remembered. Certain brain chemicals necessary for converting short-term memories into long-term ones are suppressed during REM sleep. Unless a dream is particularly vivid and if one wakes during or immediately after it, the content of the dream is not remembered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hobson | first1 = J.A. | last2 = McCarly | first2 = R.W. | s2cid = 10396934 | year = 1977 | title = The brain as a dream-state generator: An activation-synthesis hypothesis of the dream process | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 134 | issue = 12| pages = 1335–1348 | pmid = 21570 | doi=10.1176/ajp.134.12.1335| url = http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f1af/886bfac2ee058ddaf1a6fb61dabe08e19b08.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recording or reconstructing dreams may one day assist with dream recall.

====Individual differences====
In line with the salience hypothesis, there is considerable evidence that people who have more vivid, intense or unusual dreams show better recall. There is evidence that continuity of consciousness is related to recall. Specifically, people who have vivid and unusual experiences during the day tend to have more memorable dream content and hence better dream recall. People who score high on measures of personality traits associated with creativity, imagination, and fantasy, such as [[openness to experience]], [[daydream]]ing, [[fantasy prone personality|fantasy proneness]], [[absorption (psychology)|absorption]], and [[hypnotic susceptibility]], tend to show more frequent dream recall.&lt;ref name= Watson/&gt; There is also evidence for continuity between the bizarre aspects of dreaming and waking experience. That is, people who report more bizarre experiences during the day, such as people high in [[schizotypy]] (psychosis proneness) have more frequent dream recall and also report more frequent [[nightmare]]s.&lt;ref name= Watson/&gt;

===Déjà vu===
{{Main|Déjà vu}}

One theory of déjà vu attributes the feeling of having previously seen or experienced something to having dreamed about a similar situation or place, and forgetting about it until one seems to be mysteriously reminded of the situation or the place while awake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Dream Directory: The Comprehensive Guide to Analysis and Interpretation |last=Lohff |first=David C. |year=2004 |publisher=Running Press |isbn=978-0-7624-1962-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/davidclohffsdrea0000lohf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Daydreaming===
{{Main|Daydream}}

A daydream is a visionary [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]], especially one of happy, pleasant thoughts, hopes or ambitions, imagined as coming to pass, and experienced while awake.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klinger&quot;&gt;Klinger, Eric (October 1987). ''[[Psychology Today]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different types of daydreams, and there is no consistent definition amongst [[psychologists]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Klinger&quot;/&gt; The general public also uses the term for a broad variety of experiences. Research by Harvard psychologist [[Deirdre Barrett]] has found that people who experience vivid dreamlike [[mental image]]s reserve the word for these, whereas many other people refer to milder imagery, realistic future planning, review of past memories or just &quot;spacing out&quot;—i.e. one's mind going relatively blank—when they talk about &quot;daydreaming.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barrett | first1 = D.L. | year = 1979 | title = The Hypnotic Dream: Its Content in Comparison to Nocturnal Dreams and Waking Fantasy | journal = Journal of Abnormal Psychology | volume = 88 | issue = 5| pages = 584–591 | doi=10.1037/0021-843x.88.5.584}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, D.L. &quot;Fantasizers and Dissociaters: Two types of High Hypnotizables, Two Imagery Styles&quot;. in R. Kusendorf, N. Spanos, &amp; B. Wallace (Eds.) ''Hypnosis and Imagination''.

''Hypnosis and Hypnotherapy'', (2 vol.): Vol. 1: ''History, theory and general research'', Vol. 2: ''Psychotherapy research and applications'', New York: Praeger/Greenwood, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;'

While daydreaming has long been derided as a lazy, non-productive pastime, it is now commonly acknowledged that daydreaming can be constructive in some contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Tierney |author-link=John Tierney (journalist) |title=Discovering the Virtues of a Wandering Mind |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/29/science/29tier.html?src=me&amp;ref=general |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 28, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421104306/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/29/science/29tier.html?src=me&amp;ref=general |archive-date=April 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous examples of people in [[creativity|creative]] or artistic careers, such as [[composer]]s, [[novelist]]s and [[filmmaker]]s, developing new ideas through daydreaming. Similarly, research [[scientist]]s, [[mathematician]]s and [[physicist]]s have developed new ideas by daydreaming about their subject areas.

===Hallucination===
{{Main|Hallucination}}

A hallucination, in the broadest sense of the word, is a [[perception]] in the absence of a [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]]. In a stricter sense, hallucinations are perceptions in a conscious and awake state, in the absence of external stimuli, and have qualities of real perception, in that they are vivid, substantial, and located in external objective space. The latter definition distinguishes hallucinations from the related phenomena of dreaming, which does not involve wakefulness.

===Nightmare===
{{Main|Nightmare}}
[[File:A perturbed young woman fast asleep Wellcome V0016638.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An artist's depiction of a woman having a nightmare.]]
A nightmare is an unpleasant dream that can cause a strong negative emotional response from the mind, typically [[fear]] or [[horror and terror|horror]], but also [[despair]], [[anxiety]] and great [[sadness]]. The dream may contain situations of danger, discomfort, psychological or physical terror. Sufferers usually awaken in a state of distress and may be unable to return to [[sleep]] for a prolonged period of time.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association (2000), Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed, TR, p. 631&lt;/ref&gt;

===Night terror===
{{Main|Night terror}}

A night terror, also known as a sleep terror or ''pavor nocturnus'', is a [[parasomnia]] [[sleep disorder|disorder]] that predominantly affects children, causing feelings of terror or dread. Night terrors should not be confused with [[nightmare]]s, which are bad dreams that cause the feeling of horror or fear.

More specifically, given two elements &lt;math&gt; a,b \in S &lt;/math&gt;, &quot;&lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; b &lt;/math&gt; are equivalent up to &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;&quot; means that &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; b &lt;/math&gt; are equivalent, if criterion &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;, such as [[Rotation_(mathematics)|rotation]] or [[permutation]], is considered. In which case, the elements of &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; can be arranged in subsets known as &quot;[[Equivalence class|equivalence classes]]&quot;, sets whose elements are equivalent to each other up to &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;. In some cases, this might mean that &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; b &lt;/math&gt; can be transformed into one another—if a transformation corresponding to &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; (e.g., rotation, permutation) is applied.

If &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is some property or process, then the phrase &quot;up to &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;&quot; can be taken to mean &quot;disregarding a possible difference in &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;&quot;. For instance, the statement &quot;an integer's prime factorization is unique ''up to ordering''&quot; means that the prime factorization is unique—when we disregard the order of the factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~jan.nekovar/co/en/en.pdf|title=Mathematical English (a brief summary)|last=Nekovář|first=Jan|date=2011|website=Institut de mathématiques de Jussieu – Paris Rive Gauche|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; One might also say &quot;the solution to an [[indefinite integral]] is &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, ''up to addition [[constant of integration|by a constant]]''&quot;, meaning that the focus is on the solution &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; rather than the added constant, and that the addition of a constant is to be regarded as background information.  Further examples include &quot;up to isomorphism''&quot;'', &quot;up to permutations''&quot;,'' and &quot;up to rotations''&quot;,'' which are described in the [[Up to#Examples|Examples section]].

In informal contexts, mathematicians often use the word ''[[modulo (jargon)|modulo]]'' (or simply &quot;mod&quot;) for similar purposes, as in &quot;modulo isomorphism&quot;.

==Examples==
===Tetris===
[[File:Tetrominoes IJLO STZ Worlds.svg|thumb|Tetris pieces I, J, L, O, S, T, Z]]
A simple example is &quot;there are seven reflecting [[tetromino|tetrominoe]]s, up to rotations&quot;, which makes reference to the seven possible contiguous arrangements of tetrominoes (collections of four [[Unit square|unit squares]] arranged to connect on at least one side) and which are frequently thought of as the seven [[Tetris]] pieces (O, I, L, J, T, S, Z). This could also be written as &quot;there are five tetrominoes, up to reflections and rotations&quot;, which would then take into account the perspective that L and J (as well as S and Z) can be thought of as the same piece when reflected. The Tetris game does not allow reflections, so the former notation is likely to seem more natural.

To add in the exhaustive count, there is no formal notation for the number of pieces of tetrominoes. However, it is common to write that &quot;there are seven reflecting tetrominoes (= 19 total&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Tetromino.html|title=Tetromino|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;) up to rotations&quot;.  Here, Tetris provides an excellent example, as one might simply count 7 pieces × 4 rotations as 28, where some pieces (such as the 2×2 O) obviously have fewer than four rotation states.

===Eight queens===

[[File:Skak 8dronning.png|thumb|A solution of the eight queens problem]]
In the [[eight queens puzzle]], if the eight queens are considered to be distinct, then there are 3709440 distinct solutions. Normally, however, the queens are considered to be identical, and one usually says &quot;there are 92 ({{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;=\tfrac{3 709 440}{8!}&lt;/math&gt;)}} unique solutions ''up to'' [[permutation]]s of the queens&quot;, or that &quot;there are 92 solutions ''mod'' the names of the queens&quot;, signifying that two different arrangements of the queens are considered equivalent if the queens have been permuted, but the same squares on the [[chessboard]] are occupied by them.

If, in addition to treating the queens as identical, [[rotation]]s and [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]s of the board were allowed, we would have only 12 distinct solutions ''up to [[symmetry]] and the naming of the queens'', signifying that two arrangements that are symmetrical to each other are considered equivalent (for more, see [[Eight queens puzzle#Solutions]]).

===Polygons===

The [[regular polygon|regular ''n''-gon]], for given ''n'', is unique up to [[similarity (geometry)|similarity]]. In other words, if all similar ''n''-gons are considered instances of the same ''n''-gon, then there is only one regular ''n''-gon.

===Group theory===

In [[group theory]], one may have a [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' [[Group action (mathematics)|acting]] on a set ''X'', in which case, one might say that two elements of ''X'' are equivalent &quot;up to the group action&quot;—if they lie in the same [[Group action (mathematics)|orbit]].

Another typical example is the statement that &quot;there are two different [[group (mathematics)|groups]] of order 4 ''up to'' [[isomorphism]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; or &quot;''modulo'' isomorphism, there are two groups of order 4&quot;. This means that there are two equivalence classes of groups of order 4—assuming that one considers groups to be equivalent if they are [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]].

===Nonstandard analysis===
A [[hyperreal number|hyperreal]] ''x'' and its [[standard part function|standard part]] st(''x'') are equal up to an [[infinitesimal]] difference.

==Etymology==

The [[Sanskrit]] word &quot;[[wikt:हरि#Sanskrit|हरि]]&quot; (Hari) is derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] root &quot;*''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/ǵʰelh₃-|ǵʰel-]]'' to shine; to flourish; green; yellow&quot;  which also gave rise to the [[Persian language|Persian]] terms ''zar'' 'gold', Greek ''khloros'' 'green', Slavic ''zelen'' 'green' and ''zolto'' 'gold', as well as the English words ''yellow'' and ''gold''.

The same root occurs in other Sanskrit words like ''[[wikt:हरिद्रा#Sanskrit|haridrā]]'', '[[turmeric]]', named for its yellow color.

===Other names of Hari===

There are multiple names of Lord Hari mentioned in the holy scriptures of [[Hinduism]] such as the [[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagwad Gita]] and [[Mahabharata]]. A few names which are used quite frequently,

A '''pension''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɛ|n|ʃ|ə|n}}, from [[Latin]] ''pensiō'', &quot;payment&quot;) is a fund into which a sum of money is added during an employee's employment years and from which payments are drawn to support the person's [[retirement]] from work in the form of periodic payments. A pension may be a &quot;defined benefit plan&quot;, where a fixed sum is paid regularly to a person, or a &quot;defined contribution plan&quot;, under which a fixed sum is invested that then becomes available at retirement age.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas P. Lemke|first1=Gerald T. Lins|title=ERISA for Money Managers|date=2010|publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]]|isbn=9780314627056|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=af-_YgEACAAJ|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pensions should not be confused with [[Severance package|severance pay]]; the former is usually paid in regular installments for life after retirement, while the latter is typically paid as a fixed amount after involuntary termination of employment prior to retirement.

The terms &quot;retirement plan&quot; and &quot;superannuation&quot; tend to refer to a pension granted upon retirement of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=superannuation|title=WordNet Search - 3.1|work=princeton.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retirement plans may be set up by employers, insurance companies, the government, or other institutions such as employer associations or trade unions. Called ''retirement plans'' in the [[United States]], they are commonly known as ''pension schemes'' in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] and ''superannuation plans'' (or ''super''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industrysuper.com/ |title=Industry SuperFunds - Home |publisher=industrysuper.com |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in [[Superannuation in Australia|Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. Retirement pensions are typically in the form of a guaranteed [[life annuity]], thus insuring against the [[Longevity risk|risk of longevity]].

A pension created by an employer for the benefit of an employee is commonly referred to as an occupational or employer pension. [[Labor union]]s, the government, or other organizations may also fund pensions. Occupational pensions are a form of [[deferred compensation]], usually advantageous to employee and employer for [[tax]] reasons. Many pensions also contain an additional [[insurance]] aspect, since they often will pay benefits to survivors or disabled beneficiaries. Other vehicles (certain [[lottery]] payouts, for example, or an [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]]) may provide a similar stream of payments.

The common use of the term ''pension'' is to describe the payments a person receives upon retirement, usually under pre-determined legal or contractual terms. A recipient of a retirement pension is known as a ''[[pensioner]]'' or ''retiree''.

==Types of pensions==

===Employment-based pensions===
A retirement plan is an arrangement to provide people with an income during retirement when they are no longer earning a steady income from employment. Often retirement plans require both the employer and employee to contribute money to a fund during their employment in order to receive defined benefits upon retirement.  It is a tax deferred savings vehicle that allows for the tax-free accumulation of a fund for later use as a retirement income.  Funding can be provided in other ways, such as from labor unions, government agencies, or self-funded schemes. Pension plans are therefore a form of &quot;deferred compensation&quot;. A [[Small Self Administered Scheme|SSAS]] is a type of employment-based Pension in the UK. The [[401(k)]] is the iconic self-funded retirement plan that many Americans rely on for much of their retirement income; these sometimes include money from an employer, but are usually mostly or entirely funded by the individual using an elaborate scheme where money from the employee's paycheck is withheld, at their direction, to be contributed by their employer to the employee's plan. This money can be tax-deferred or not, depending on the exact nature of the plan.

Some countries also grant pensions to military veterans. Military pensions are overseen by the government; an example of a standing agency is the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]]. ''[[Ad hoc]]'' committees may also be formed to investigate specific tasks, such as the U.S. [[Commission on Veterans' Pensions]] (commonly known as the &quot;Bradley Commission&quot;) in 1955–56.  Pensions may extend past the death of the veteran himself, continuing to be paid to the widow.

==={{anchor|State pension}}&lt;!-- [[State pension]] redirects here--&gt;Social and state pensions===
Many countries have created funds for their citizens and residents to provide income when they retire (or in some cases become disabled). Typically this requires payments throughout the citizen's working life in order to qualify for benefits later on. A basic state pension is a &quot;contribution based&quot; benefit, and depends on an individual's contribution history. For examples, see [[National Insurance]] in the UK, or [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] in the United States of America.

Many countries have also put in place a &quot;[[social pension]]&quot;. These are regular, tax-funded non-contributory cash transfers paid to older people. Over 80 countries have social pensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pension-watch.net/country-fact-file/|title=Country map|work=pension-watch.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some are universal benefits, given to all older people regardless of income, assets or employment record. Examples of universal pensions include [[New Zealand]] Superannuation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/individuals/a-z-benefits/nz-superannuation.html|title=New Zealand Superannuation|author=webcoordinator@msd.govt.nz|work=workandincome.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Basic Retirement Pension of [[Mauritius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Larry |last=Willmore|title=Universal Pensions in Mauritius|date=April 2003|ssrn=398280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most social pensions, though, are means-tested, such as [[Supplemental Security Income]] in the United States of America or the &quot;older person's grant&quot; in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Old age pension|url=http://www.services.gov.za/services/content/Home/ServicesForPeople/Socialbenefits/oldagegrant/en_ZA|publisher=GCIS|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disability pensions===
{{Main|Disability pension}}
Some pension plans will provide for members in the event they suffer a [[disability]].  This may take the form of early entry into a retirement plan for a disabled member below the normal retirement age.

==Benefits==
Retirement plans may be classified as ''defined benefit'', ''defined contribution'' or ''defined ambition'' / ''target benefit'' according to how the benefits are determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/0/49/38356329.pdf |title=Private Pensions/Les pensions privées |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A defined benefit plan guarantees a certain payout at retirement, according to a fixed formula which usually depends on the member's salary and the number of years' membership in the plan.  A defined contribution plan will provide a payout at retirement that is dependent upon the amount of money contributed and the performance of the investment vehicles utilized. Hence, with a defined contribution plan the risk and responsibility lies with the employee that the funding will be sufficient through retirement, whereas with the defined benefit plan the risk and responsibility lies with the employer or plan managers.

Some types of retirement plans, such as ''cash balance'' plans, combine features of both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.  They are often referred to as ''hybrid'' plans. Such plan designs have become increasingly popular in the US since the 1990s.  Examples include Cash Balance and Pension Equity plans.

==Defined benefit plans==
{{Main|Defined benefit pension plan}}
A Defined Benefit (DB) pension plan is a plan in which workers accrue pension rights during their time at a firm and upon retirement the firm pays them a benefit that is a function of that worker's tenure at the firm and of their earnings.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, J. (2010) Public Finance and Public Policy, Worth Publishers. G-3 (Glossary)&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a DB plan is a plan in which the benefit on retirement is determined by a set formula, rather than depending on investment returns. Government pensions such as [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] in the United States are a type of defined benefit pension plan. Traditionally, defined benefit plans for employers have been administered by institutions which exist specifically for that purpose, by large businesses, or, for [[government]] workers, by the government itself. A traditional form of defined benefit plan is the ''final salary'' plan, under which the pension paid is equal to the number of years worked, multiplied by the member's salary at retirement, multiplied by a factor known as the ''accrual rate''. The final accrued amount is available as a monthly pension or a lump sum, but usually monthly.

The benefit in a defined benefit pension plan is determined by a formula that can incorporate the employee's pay, years of employment, age at retirement, and other factors. A simple example is a Dollars Times Service plan design that provides a certain amount per month based on the time an employee works for a company. For example, a plan offering $100 a month per year of service would provide $3,000 per month to a retiree with 30 years of service. While this type of plan is popular among unionized workers, Final Average Pay (FAP) remains the most common type of defined benefit plan offered in the United States. In FAP plans, the average salary over the final years of an employee's career determines the benefit amount.

Averaging salary over a number of years means that the calculation is averaging different dollars. For example, if salary is averaged over five years, and retirement is in 2006, then salary in 2001 dollars is averaged with salary in 2002 dollars, etc., with 2001 dollars being worth more than the dollars of succeeding years. The pension is then paid in first year of retirement dollars, in this example 2006 dollars, with the lowest value of any dollars in the calculation. Thus inflation in the salary averaging years has a considerable impact on purchasing power and cost, both being reduced equally by inflation.

This effect of inflation can be eliminated by converting salaries in the averaging years to first year of retirement dollars, and then averaging.

In the US, {{uscsub|26|414|j}} specifies a defined benefit plan to be any pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan (see below) where a defined contribution plan is any plan with individual accounts. A traditional pension plan that ''defines'' a ''benefit'' for an employee upon that employee's retirement is a defined benefit plan.  In the U.S., corporate defined benefit plans, along with many other types of defined benefit plans, are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).&lt;ref&gt;Lemke and Lins, ''ERISA for Money Managers'', §1:2 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], benefits are typically indexed for inflation (known as [[Retail Prices Index (United Kingdom)|Retail Prices Index]] (RPI)) as required by law for registered pension plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk/Pension_Rights/Pension_Increases/ |title=The Pensions Advisory Service |publisher=The Pensions Advisory Service |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inflation during an employee's retirement affects the purchasing power of the pension; the higher the inflation rate, the lower the purchasing power of a fixed annual pension. This effect can be mitigated by providing annual increases to the pension at the rate of inflation (usually capped, for instance at 5% in any given year). This method is advantageous for the employee since it stabilizes the purchasing power of pensions to some extent.

If the pension plan allows for early retirement, payments are often reduced to recognize that the [[retiree]]s will receive the payouts for longer periods of time. In the United States, under the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act|Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974]], any reduction factor less than or equal to the [[actuarial]] early retirement reduction factor is acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Early Retirement Provisions in Defined Benefit Pension Plans|first=Ann C.|last=Foster|url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/cwc/archive/winter1996art3.pdf|website=bls.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many DB plans include early retirement provisions to encourage employees to retire early, before the attainment of normal retirement age (usually age 65). Companies would rather hire younger employees at lower wages. Some of those provisions come in the form of additional ''temporary'' or ''supplemental benefits'', which are payable to a certain age, usually before attaining normal retirement age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Qualified Domestic Relations Order Handbook|first=Gary A.|last=Shulman|pages=199–200|publisher=Aspen Publishers Online|year=1999|isbn=978-0-7355-0665-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to changes in pensions over the years, many pension systems, including those in [[Retirement Systems of Alabama|Alabama]], [[CalPERS|California]], [[Indiana Public Retirement System|Indiana]], and [[New York State Common Retirement|New York]], have shifted to a tiered system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bauer|first=Elizabeth|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ebauer/2019/06/07/more-cautionary-tales-from-illinois-tier-ii-pensions-and-why-actuaries-matter/|title=More Cautionary Tales From Illinois: Tier II Pensions (And Why Actuaries Matter)|work=Forbes|date=7 June 2019|access-date=19 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a simplified example, suppose there are three employees that pay into a state pension system: Sam, Veronica, and Jessica. The state pension system has three tiers: Tier I, Tier II, and Tier III. These three tiers are based on the employee's hire date (i.e. Tier I covers 1 January 1980 (and before) to 1 January 1995, Tier II 2 January 1995 to 1 January 2010, and Tier III 1 January 2010 to present) and have different benefit provisions (e.g. Tier I employees can retire at age 50 with 80% benefits or wait until 55 with full benefits, Tier II employees can retire at age 55 with 80% benefits or wait until 60 for full benefits, Tier III employees can retire at age 65 with full benefits). Therefore, Sam, hired in June 1983, would be subject to the provisions of the Tier I scheme, whereas Veronica, hired in August 1995, would be permitted to retire at age 60 with full benefits and Jessica, hired in December 2014, would not be able to retire with full benefits until she became 65.  

===DB funding===
{{Main|Defined benefit pension plan#Funding}}
Defined benefit plans may be either ''funded'' or ''unfunded''.

In an ''unfunded'' defined benefit pension, no assets are set aside and the benefits are paid for by the employer or other pension sponsor as and when they are paid. Pension arrangements provided by the state in most countries in the world are unfunded, with benefits paid directly from current workers' contributions and taxes.  This method of financing is known as ''pay-as-you-go''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=5310|title=Unfunded Pension Plans|work= [[OECD]] Glossary of Statistical Terms|accessdate=26 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social security systems of many European countries are unfunded,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/18502013 &quot;Falling Short&quot;] ''The Economist'' 7 April 2011. Retrieved 30 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; having benefits paid directly out of current taxes and social security contributions, although several countries have hybrid systems which are partially funded. Spain set up the Social Security Reserve Fund and France set up the [[Pensions Reserve Fund (France)|Pensions Reserve Fund]]; in Canada the [[Canada Pension Plan|wage-based retirement plan]] (CPP) is partially funded, with assets managed by the [[CPP Investment Board]] while the U.S. [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] system is partially funded by investment in special U.S. Treasury Bonds.

In a ''funded'' plan, contributions from the employer, and sometimes also from plan members, are invested in a fund towards meeting the benefits.  All plans must be funded in some way, even if they are pay-as-you-go, so this type of plan is more accurately known as ''pre-funded''.  The future returns on the investments, and the future benefits to be paid, are not known in advance, so there is no guarantee that a given level of contributions will be enough to meet the benefits.  Typically, the contributions to be paid are regularly reviewed in a valuation of the plan's assets and liabilities, carried out by an [[actuary]] to ensure that the pension fund will meet future payment obligations.  This means that in a defined benefit pension, investment risk and investment rewards are typically assumed by the sponsor/employer and not by the individual.  If a plan is not well-funded, the plan sponsor may not have the financial resources to continue funding the plan.

===DB criticisms===
{{refimprove section|date=October 2015}}
Traditional defined benefit plan designs (because of their typically flat accrual rate and the decreasing time for interest discounting as people get closer to retirement age) tend to exhibit a J-shaped accrual pattern of benefits, where the present value of benefits grows quite slowly early in an employee's career and accelerates significantly in mid-career: in other words it costs more to fund the pension for older employees than for younger ones (an &quot;age bias&quot;). Defined benefit pensions tend to be less [[Portability (social security)|portable]] than defined contribution plans, even if the plan allows a lump sum cash benefit at termination. Most plans, however, pay their benefits as an annuity, so retirees do not bear the risk of low investment returns on contributions or of outliving their retirement income. The open-ended nature of these risks to the employer is the reason given by many employers for switching from defined benefit to defined contribution plans over recent years. The risks to the employer can sometimes be mitigated by discretionary elements in the benefit structure, for instance in the rate of increase granted on accrued pensions, both before and after retirement.

The age bias, reduced [[Portability (social security)|portability]] and open ended risk make defined benefit plans better suited to large employers with less mobile workforces, such as the public sector (which has open-ended support from taxpayers). This coupled with a lack of foresight on the employers part means a large proportion of the workforce are kept in the dark over future investment schemes.

Defined benefit plans are sometimes criticized as being paternalistic as they enable employers or plan trustees to make decisions about the type of benefits and family structures and lifestyles of their employees. However they are typically more valuable than defined contribution plans in most circumstances and for most employees (mainly because the employer tends to pay higher contributions than under defined contribution plans), so such criticism is rarely harsh.

The &quot;cost&quot; of a defined benefit plan is not easily calculated, and requires an actuary or actuarial software. However, even with the best of tools, the cost of a defined benefit plan will always be an estimate based on economic and financial assumptions. These assumptions include the average retirement age and lifespan of the employees, the returns to be earned by the pension plan's investments and any additional taxes or levies, such as those required by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation in the U.S. So, for this arrangement, the benefit is relatively secure but the contribution is uncertain even when estimated by a professional.  This has serious cost considerations and risks for the employer offering a pension plan.

One of the growing concerns with defined benefit plans is that the level of future obligations will outpace the value of assets held by the plan.  This &quot;underfunding&quot; dilemma can be faced by any type of defined benefit plan, private or public, but it is most acute in governmental and other public plans where political pressures and less rigorous accounting standards can result in excessive commitments to employees and retirees, but inadequate contributions.  Many states and municipalities across the United States of America and Canada now face chronic pension crises.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 =Tufts| first1 =William| last2 =Fairbanks| first2 =Lee| title =Pension Ponzi: How Public-sector Unions are Bankrupting Canada's Health Care, Education and Your Retirement| place =Mississauga, Ontario| publisher =Wiley| year =2011| pages =210| url =http://fairpensionsforall.net/book/| isbn =978-1118098738}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===DB examples===
Many countries offer state-sponsored retirement benefits, beyond those provided by employers, which are funded by [[payroll tax|payroll]] or other taxes. In the United States, the Social Security system is similar in function to a defined benefit pension arrangement, albeit one that is constructed differently from a pension offered by a private employer; however, Social Security is distinct in that there is no legally guaranteed level of benefits derived from the amount paid into the program.

Individuals that have worked in the UK and have paid certain levels of national insurance deductions can expect an income from the state pension scheme after their normal retirement. The state pension is currently divided into two parts: the basic state pension, State Second [tier] Pension scheme called S2P. Individuals will qualify for the basic state pension if they have completed sufficient years contribution to their national insurance record.  The S2P pension scheme is earnings related and depends on earnings in each year as to how much an individual can expect to receive. It is possible for an individual to forgo the S2P payment from the state, in lieu of a payment made to an appropriate pension scheme of their choice, during their working life.  For more details see [[UK pension provision]].

==Defined contribution plans==
{{Main|Defined contribution plan}}
A defined contribution (DC) plan, is a pension plan where employers set aside a certain proportion (i.e. contributions) of a worker's earnings (such as 5%) in an investment account, and the worker receives this savings and any accumulated investment earnings upon retirement.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, J. Public Finance and Public Policy, Worth Publishers. G-3 (Glossary)&lt;/ref&gt; These contributions are paid into an individual account for each member. The contributions are invested, for example in the stock market, and the returns on the investment (which may be positive or negative) are credited to the individual's account.  On retirement, the member's account is used to provide retirement benefits, sometimes through the purchase of an annuity which then provides a regular income.  Defined contribution plans have become widespread all over the world in recent years, and are now the dominant form of plan in the private sector in many countries.  For example, the number of defined benefit plans in the US has been steadily declining, as more and more employers see pension contributions as a large expense avoidable by disbanding the defined benefit plan and instead offering a defined contribution plan.

Money contributed can either be from employee salary deferral or from employer contributions. The [[Portability (social security)|portability]] of defined contribution pensions is legally no different from the [[Portability (social security)|portability]] of defined benefit plans.  However, because of the cost of administration and ease of determining the plan sponsor's liability for defined contribution plans (you do not need to pay an actuary to calculate the lump sum equivalent that you do for defined benefit plans) in practice, defined contribution plans have become generally [[Portability (social security)|portable]].

In a defined contribution plan, investment risk and investment rewards are assumed by each individual/employee/retiree and not by the sponsor/employer, and these risks may be substantial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cannon|first=Edmund|author2=Ian Tonks|title=The Value and Risk of Defined Contribution Pension Schemes: International Evidence|journal=Journal of Risk and Insurance|volume=80|pages=95–119|year=2012|doi=10.1111/j.1539-6975.2011.01456.x|hdl=10036/86956|s2cid=7975555|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/efm/media/workingpapers/working_papers/pdffiles/dp09610.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, participants do not necessarily purchase annuities with their savings upon retirement, and bear the risk of outliving their assets. (In the United Kingdom, for instance, it is a legal requirement{{outdated-inline|date=April 2020}} to use the bulk of the fund to purchase an annuity.)

The &quot;cost&quot; of a defined contribution plan is readily calculated, but the benefit from a defined contribution plan depends upon the account balance at the time an employee is looking to use the assets.  So, for this arrangement, the ''contribution is known'' but the ''benefit is unknown'' (until calculated).

Despite the fact that the participant in a defined contribution plan typically has control over investment decisions, the plan sponsor retains a significant degree of fiduciary responsibility over investment of plan assets, including the selection of investment options and administrative providers.

A defined contribution plan typically involves a number of service providers, including in many cases:
* Trustee
* Custodian
* Administrator
* Recordkeeper
* Auditor
* Legal counsel&lt;ref&gt;Lemke and Lins, ''ERISA for Money Managers'' §2:26 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

===DC examples===
In the United States, the legal definition of a defined contribution plan is a plan providing for an individual account for each participant, and for benefits based solely on the amount contributed to the account, plus or minus income, gains, expenses and losses allocated to the account (see {{uscsub|26|414|i}}). Examples of defined contribution plans in the United States include [[individual retirement account]]s (IRAs) and [[401(k)|401(k) plans]]. In such plans, the employee is responsible, to one degree or another, for selecting the types of [[investment]]s toward which the funds in the retirement plan are allocated.  This may range from choosing one of a small number of pre-determined [[mutual fund]]s to selecting individual [[stock]]s or other [[security (finance)|securities]].  Most self-directed retirement plans are characterized by certain [[tax advantage]]s, and some provide for a portion of the employee's contributions to be matched by the employer.  In exchange, the funds in such plans may not be withdrawn by the investor prior to reaching a certain age—typically the year the employee reaches 59.5 years old-- (with a small number of exceptions) without incurring a substantial penalty.

Advocates of defined contribution plans point out that each employee has the ability to tailor the investment portfolio to his or her individual needs and financial situation, including the choice of how much to contribute, if anything at all.  However, others state that these apparent advantages could also hinder some workers who might not possess the financial savvy to choose the correct investment vehicles or have the discipline to voluntarily contribute money to retirement accounts.

In the US, defined contribution plans are subject to [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] limits on how much can be contributed, known as the section 415 limit.  In 2009, the total deferral amount, including employee contribution plus employer contribution, was limited to $49,000 or 100% of compensation, whichever is less.  The employee-only limit in 2009 was $16,500 with a $5,500 catch-up. These numbers usually increase each year and are indexed to compensate for the effects of inflation.  For 2015, the limits were raised to $53,000 and $18,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/IRS-Announces-2015-Pension-Plan-Limitations;-Taxpayers-May-Contribute-up-to-$18,000-to-their-401(k)-plans-in-2015|title=IRS Announces 2015 Pension Plan Limitations; Taxpayers May Contribute up to $18,000 to their 401(k) plans in 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively.

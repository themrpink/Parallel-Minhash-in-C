[[File:ForbiddenCity MaoZedongPortrait (pixinn.net).jpg|thumb|Despite falling out of favor within the [[Communist Party of China]] by 1978, Mao is still revered, with Deng's famous &quot;70% right, 30% wrong&quot; line]]
Maoism has fallen out of favour within the Communist Party of China, beginning with Deng Xiaoping's reforms in 1978. Deng believed that Maoism showed the dangers of &quot;ultra-leftism&quot;, manifested in the harm perpetrated by the various mass movements that characterized the Maoist era. In Chinese communism, the term &quot;left&quot; can be taken as a euphemism for Maoist policies. However, Deng stated that the revolutionary side of Maoism should be considered separate from the governance side, leading to his famous epithet that Mao was &quot;70% right, 30% wrong&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ips-journal.eu/in-focus/the-politics-of-memory/article/show/70-per-cent-good-30-per-cent-bad-2216/|title=70 per cent good, 30 per cent bad}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese scholars generally agree that Deng's interpretation of Maoism preserves the legitimacy of Communist rule in China, but at the same time criticizes Mao's brand of economic and political governance.

Critic Graham Young says that Maoists see [[Joseph Stalin]] as the last true socialist leader of the Soviet Union, but allows that the Maoist assessments of Stalin vary between the extremely positive and the more ambivalent.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Young, ''On Socialist Development and the Two Roads'', The Australian Journal of Chinese Affairs, No. 8 (July 1982), pp. 75–84, {{doi|10.2307/2158927}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some political philosophers, such as Martin Cohen, have seen in Maoism an attempt to combine [[Confucianism]] and [[socialism]]—what one such called &quot;a third way between communism and capitalism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Political Philosophy from Plato to Mao, by Martin Cohen, p. 206, published 2001 by Pluto Press, London and Sterling VA {{ISBN|0-7453-1603-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Enver Hoxha]] critiqued Maoism from a Marxist–Leninist perspective, arguing that New Democracy halts class struggle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hoxha/works/imp_rev/imp_ch6.htm|title=Enver Hoxha: Imperialism and the Revolution (1979)|website=Marxists Internet Archive|accessdate=19 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows unrestricted capitalist exploitation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hoxha/works/imp_rev/imp_ch6.htm|title=Enver Hoxha: Imperialism and the Revolution (1979)|website=Marxists Internet Archive|accessdate=19 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; the theory of the three worlds is &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hoxha/works/imp_rev/imp_ch4.htm|title=Enver Hoxha: Imperialism and the Revolution (1979)|website=Marxists Internet Archive|accessdate=19 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and questioned Mao's guerilla warfare methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hoxha/works/imp_rev/imp_ch3.htm|title=Enver Hoxha: Imperialism and the Revolution (1979)|website=Marxists Internet Archive|accessdate=19 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some say Mao departed from Leninism not only in his near-total lack of interest in the urban working class, but also in his concept of the nature and role of the party. For Lenin, the party was sacrosanct because it was the incarnation of the &quot;proletarian consciousness&quot; and there was no question about who were the teachers and who were the pupils. On the other hand, for Mao this question would always be virtually impossible to answer.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

The implementation of Maoist thought in China was arguably responsible for as many as 70 million deaths during peacetime,&lt;ref&gt;Jung Chang and Jon Halliday,'' Mao: The Untold Story'' (Jonathan Cape, 2005) p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cis.org.au/Policy/autumn06/autumn06_10.pdf policy autumn 06_Edit5.indd&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216200515/http://www.cis.org.au/Policy/autumn06/autumn06_10.pdf|date=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Cultural Revolution]], [[Anti-Rightist Campaign]] of 1957–1958&lt;ref&gt;Teiwes, Frederick C., and Warren Sun. 1999. 'China's road to disaster: Mao, central politicians, and provincial leaders in the unfolding of the great leap forward, 1955-1959''.'' Contemporary China papers. Armonk, N.Y.: M.E. Sharpe. pp. 52–55.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Great Leap Forward]]. Some historians have argued that because of Mao's [[land reform]]s during the Great Leap Forward which resulted in [[famine]]s, thirty million perished between 1958 and 1961. By the end of 1961, the birth rate was nearly cut in half because of malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar, Roderick. 1974. The origins of the Cultural Revolution. London: Published for Royal Institute of International Affairs, East Asian Institute of Columbia University and Research Institute on Communist Affairs of Columbia by Oxford University Press. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Active campaigns, including party purges and &quot;reeducation&quot; resulted in imprisonment and/or the execution of those deemed contrary to the implementation of Maoist ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/17/AR2007071701486.html|work=The Washington Post|first=Perry|last=Link|title=Legacy Of a Maoist Injustice|date=18 July 2007|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incidents of destruction of cultural heritage, religion and art remain controversial. Some Western scholars saw Maoism specifically engaged in a battle to dominate and subdue nature and was a catastrophe for the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Shapiro, ''Mao's War Against Nature: Politics and the Environment in Revolutionary China'', 2001, Cambridge University Press, p. 306, {{ISBN|0521786800}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Populism ===
Mao also believed strongly in the concept of a unified people. These notions were what prompted him to investigate the peasant uprisings in Hunan while the rest of China's communists were in the cities and focused on the orthodox Marxist proletariat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 43&quot;&gt;Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the pillars of Maoism such as the distrust of intellectuals and the abhorrence of occupational specialty are typical populist ideas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 44&quot;/&gt; The concept of &quot;[[people's war]]&quot; which is so central to Maoist thought is directly populist in its origins. Mao believed that intellectuals and party cadres had to become first students of the masses to become teachers of the masses later. This concept was vital to the strategy of the aforementioned &quot;people's war&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 44&quot;/&gt;

=== Nationalism ===
Mao's nationalist impulses also played a crucially important role in the adaption of Marxism to the Chinese model and in the formation of Maoism.&lt;ref&gt;Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Mao truly believed that China was to play a crucial preliminary role in the socialist revolution internationally. This belief, or the fervor with which Mao held it, separated Mao from the other Chinese communists and led Mao onto the path of what [[Leon Trotsky]] called &quot;Messianic Revolutionary Nationalism&quot;, which was central to his personal philosophy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 43&quot;/&gt; German post–World War II far-right activist [[Michael Kühnen]], himself a former Maoist, once praised Maoism as being a Chinese form of [[Nazism]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Martin A. ''The Beast Reawakens: Fascism's Resurgence from Hitler's Spymasters to Today'', 2013. p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mao-Spontex ===
[[Mao-Spontex]] refers to a Maoist interpretation in western Europe which stresses the importance of the cultural revolution and overthrowing hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/levy-benny/1971/investigation.htm|title=Investigation into the Maoists in France, Benny Lévy 1971|website=marxists.org|accessdate=11 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.''' is an American publishing firm that is owned by [[News Corp (2013–present)|News Corp]] and led by CEO [[Almar Latour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dowjones.com/team/almar-latour/|title=ALMAR LATOUR Chief Executive Officer, Dow Jones|website=dowjones.com|accessdate=May 15, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company publishes ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[Barron%27s (newspaper)|Barron's]]'', ''[[MarketWatch]]'', ''Mansion Global'', ''[[Financial News]]'' and ''[[Private Equity News]]''.

==History==
The company was founded in 1882 by three reporters: [[Charles Dow]], [[Edward Jones (statistician)|Edward Jones]], and [[Charles Bergstresser]]. Charles Dow was widely known for being able to convey and break down what was often considered very convoluted financial information and news to the general public. This is one of the reasons why Dow Jones &amp; Company is well known for their publications and transferring of important and sometimes difficult to understand financial information to people all across the globe. Nevertheless, the three reporters were joined in control of the organization by [[Thomas F. Woodlock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33335280/the_wall_street_journal/| title=Notice| newspaper=The Wall Street Journal| location=New York, NY| date=January 9, 1899| page=1| via=Newspapers.com}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dow Jones was acquired in 1902 by [[Clarence Barron]], the leading financial journalist of the day, after the death of co-founder Charles Dow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dow Jones History&quot;/&gt;  Upon Barron's death in 1928, control of the company passed to his stepdaughters Jane and Martha Bancroft. The company was led by the [[Bancroft family]], which effectively controlled 64% of all voting stock, until 2007 when an extended takeover battle saw [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]] acquire the business. The company became a subsidiary of News Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/13/business/media/13cnd-dow.html?_r=1&amp;ref=media&amp;oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | title=Shareholders Back Dow Jones Sale | first=Richard | last=Pérez-Peña | date=December 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported on August 1, 2007, that the bid had been successful&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6923474.stm|title=Murdoch wins fight for Dow Jones|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/media/article2178165.ece|title=Login|website=Business.timesonline.co.uk|accessdate=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; after an extended period of uncertainty about shareholder agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/media/article2095347.ece|title=Login|website=Business.timesonline.co.uk|accessdate=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transaction was completed on December 13, 2007. It was worth US$5 billion or $60 a share, giving [[News Corp (2013–present)|News Corp]] control of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and ending the Bancroft family's 105 years of ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aokdSQYhMOgo&amp;refer=home | work=Bloomberg | title=Murdoch's News Corp.

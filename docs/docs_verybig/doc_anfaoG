103 species of [[phytoplankton]] have been recorded in the lake including [[cyanobacteria]], [[flagellate]]s, [[diatom]]s, [[green algae]], and [[brown algae]]. 36 species of [[zooplankton]] have also been recorded including [[Rotatoria]], [[Cladocera]], and [[Copepoda]] in the lake.&lt;ref&gt;Selçuk 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, researchers reported the discovery of {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall [[microbialites]] in the lake. These are solid towers on the lake bed formed by coccoid [[cyanobacteria]] (''[[Pleurocapsaceae|Pleurocapsa]]'' group) these create mats of [[aragonite]] that combine with [[calcite]] precipitating out of the lake water.{{sfn|Kempe|Kazmierczak|Landmann|Konuk|1991}}

The region hosts the rare [[Van Cat]] breed of cat, having &amp;ndash; among other things &amp;ndash; an unusual fascination with water. The lake is mainly surrounded by fruit orchards and [[cereal|grain]] fields, interspersed by some non-agricultural trees.

==Legend or story==
{{main|Lake Van Monster}}
According to legend, the lake hosts the mysterious [[Lake Van Monster]] that lurks below the surface, 30 to 40&amp;nbsp;ft long with brown scaly skin, an elongated reptilian head and flippers. Apart from some amateur photographs and videos, there is no physical evidence to prove its existence. The profile resembles an extinct [[mosasaurus]] or [[basilosaurus]].

==History==
[[File:Lake Van in Maunsell&amp;#039;s map, Pre-World War I British Ethnographical Map of eastern Turkey in Asia, Syria and western Persia 03.png|thumb|Ethnographical map of Lake Van, just prior to World War I &amp;ndash; the dark green zone surrounding the lake represents [[Armenians]].]]
{{further|Urartu}}
[[Tushpa]], the capital of [[Urartu]], near the shores, on the site of what became medieval Van's castle, west of present-day [[Van (Turkey)|Van city]].{{sfn|Cottrell|1960|p=488}} The ruins of the medieval city of Van are still visible below the southern slopes of the rock on which [[Van Castle]] stands.

In 2017, archaeologists from [[Van Yüzüncü Yıl University|Van Yüzüncü Yil University]] and a team of independent divers who were exploring Lake Van reported the discovery of a large underwater fortress spanning roughly one kilometer.{{sfn|Gibbens|2017}} The team estimates that this fortress was constructed during the Urartian period, based on their visual assessments. The archaeologists believe that the fortress, along with other parts of the ancient city that surrounded it at the time, had slowly become submerged over the millennia by the gradually rising lake.{{sfn|Ancient castle studied...|2017}}

===Armenian kingdoms===
[[Image:Armenian gravestones. Lake Van.JPG|thumb|[[Armenians|Armenian]] medieval [[khachkar]] near Lake Van]]

The lake was the centre of the [[Armenians|Armenian]] kingdom of [[Urartu|Ararat]] from about 1000 BC, afterwards of the [[Satrapy of Armenia|Satrapy of Armina]], [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Greater Armenia]], and the Armenian Kingdom of [[Vaspurakan]].

Along with [[Lake Sevan]] in today's [[Armenia]] and [[Lake Urmia]] in today's [[Iran]], Van was one of the three great lakes of the Armenian Kingdom, referred to as ''the seas of [[Armenia]]'' (in ancient Assyrian sources: &quot;tâmtu ša mât Nairi&quot; (Upper Sea of [[Nairi]]), the Lower Sea being [[Lake Urmia]]).{{sfn|Ebeling|Meissner|1997|p=2}} Over time, the lake was known by various Armenian names, including {{lang-hy|Վանա լիճ (Lake of Van), Վանա ծով (Sea of Van), Արճեշի ծով (Sea of Arčeš), Բզնունեաց ծով (Sea of Bznunik),{{sfn|Hewsen|1997|p=9}} Ռշտունեաց ծով (Sea of Rshtunik),{{sfn|Hewsen|1997|p=9}} and Տոսպայ լիճ (Lake of Tosp)}}.

===East Roman Empire===
By the 11th century the lake was on the border between the [[East Roman Empire]], with its capital at [[Constantinople]], and the [[Seljuk Empire|Turko-Persian Seljuk Empire]], with its capital at [[Isfahan]]. In the uneasy peace between the two empires, local Armenian-Byzantine landowners employed [[Turkmen people|Turcoman]] [[gazi]]s and Byzantine [[akritai]] for protection. The Greek-speaking Byzantines called the lake ''Thospitis limne'' ({{lang-gkm|Θωσπῖτις λίμνη}}).

In the second half of the 11th century Emperor [[Romanus IV Diogenes]] launched a campaign to re-conquer Armenia and head off growing Seljuk control. Diogenes and his large army crossed the [[Euphrates]] and confronted a much smaller Seljuk force led by [[Alp Arslan]] at the [[Battle of Manzikert]], north of Lake Van on 26 August 1071. Despite their greater numbers, the cumbersome Byzantine force was defeated by the more mobile Turkish horsemen and Diogenes was captured.

===Seljuk Empire===

[[File:Vue du lac de Van du ferry-boat.jpg|thumb|View of the lake from aboard the [[train ferry]] ''Van'' of the [[Turkish State Railways]] in 1987. In December 2015 the new generation of train ferries, the largest of their kind in Turkey, entered service in Lake Van.{{sfn|Mina|2015}}]]

[[Alp Arslan]] divided the conquered eastern portions of the Byzantine empire among his Turcoman generals, with each ruled as a hereditary [[bey]]lik, under overall sovereignty of the [[Seljuq Empire]]. Alp Arslan gave the region around Lake Van to his commander [[Sökmen el-Kutbî]], who set up his capital at Ahlat on the western side of the lake. The dynasty of [[Shah-Armens]], also known as ''Sökmenler'', ruled this area from 1085 to 1192.

The Ahlatshahs were succeeded by the [[Ayyubid dynasty]].

===Ottoman Empire===
Following the disintegration of the Seljuq-ruled [[Sultanate of Rum]], Lake Van and its surroundings were conquered by the [[Ilkhanate]] Mongols, and later switched hands between the Ottoman Empire and [[Safavid Iran]] until Sultan [[Selim I]] took control for good.

Reports of the [[Lake Van Monster]] surfaced in the late 1800s and gained popularity. A news article was published by ''Saadet Gazetesi'' issue number 1323, dated 28 Shaban 1306 [[Hijri year]], corresponding to 29 April 1889 during the reign of Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mynet.com/van-golu-canavari-gercek-mi-131-yil-once-osmanli-gazetesinde-manset-olmus-110106500572 Van Gölü canavarı gerçek mi? 131 yıl önce Osmanlı gazetesinde manşet olmuş] mynet. 22 April 2020.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
{{main|Armenian architecture}}
Near [[Van Fortress]] and the southern shore, on [[Akdamar Island]] lies the 10th century [[Cathedral of the Holy Cross, Aghtamar]] ({{lang-hy|Սուրբ Խաչ}}, Surb Khach), which served as a royal church to the kingdom of [[Vaspurakan]]. The ruins of Armenian monasteries also exist on the other three islands of Lake Van: Lim, Arter, and Ktuts. The area around Lake Van was also the home to a large number Armenian monasteries, among the most prominent of these being the 10th century [[Narekavank]] and the 11th century [[Varagavank]], the former now destroyed.

The Ahlatshahs left a large number of historic [[headstones]] in and around the town of [[Ahlat]]. Local administrators are currently trying to have the tombstones included in [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage List]], where they are currently listed tentatively.{{sfn|Oktay|2007}}{{sfn|UNESCO|n.d.}}

==Transportation==
The railway connecting Turkey and [[Iran]] was built in the 1970s, sponsored by [[CENTO]]. It uses a [[train ferry]] (ferry for decanted passengers) across between the cities [[Tatvan]] and [[Van (Turkey)|Van]], rather than building tracks around rugged terrain. This limits passenger capacity. In May 2008 talks started between Turkey and Iran to replace the ferry with a double-track electrified railway.{{sfn|APA|2007}}

In December 2015 the new generation of [[train ferry|train ferries]] operated by the [[Turkish State Railways]], the largest of their kind in Turkey, entered service in Lake Van.{{sfn|Mina|2015}}

[[Van Ferit Melen Airport|Ferit Melen Airport]] abuts [[Van, Turkey|Van]]. [[Turkish Airlines]], [[AnadoluJet]], [[Pegasus Airlines]], and [[SunExpress]] are the airlines which have regular flights.

==Sports==
[[File:IOC Offshore Van Grand Prix 2010.JPG|thumb|An image from the 2010 UIM-IOC Van Grand Prix in Lake Van.]]
Lake Van occasionally hosts several [[water sports]], [[sailing]], and [[inshore powerboat racing]] events, such as the [[Union Internationale Motonautique|UIM]] [[World Offshore Championship, Turkey|World Offshore 225 Championship]]'s IOC Van Grand Prix, and the Van Lake Festival.

'''Fanorona''' ({{IPA-mg|fə̥ˈnurnə̥}}) is a [[Abstract strategy game|strategy]] [[board game]] for two players. The game is indigenous to [[Madagascar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;montgomery&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author = W.

==Introduction==
Fanorona has three standard versions: Fanoron-Telo, Fanoron-Dimy, and Fanoron-Tsivy. The difference between these variants is the size of board played on. Fanoron-Telo is played on a 3×3 board and the difficulty of this game can be compared to the game of tic-tac-toe. Fanoron-Dimy is played on a 5×5 board and Fanoron-Tsivy is played on a 9×5 board—Tsivy being the most popular. Black and white pieces, twenty-two each, are arranged on all points but the center. The objective of the game is to capture all the opponents pieces. The game is a draw if neither player succeeds in this. Capturing is done by either approaching or withdrawing from opponent's pieces.

Fanorona is very popular in Madagascar. According to one version of a popular legend, an astrologer had advised King [[Ralambo]] to choose his successor by selecting a time when his sons were away from the capital to feign sickness and urge their return; his kingdom would be given to the first son who returned home to him. When the king's messenger reached Ralambo's elder son Prince Andriantompokondrindra, he was playing fanorona and trying to win a ''telo noho dimy'' (3 against 5) situation, one that is infamously difficult to resolve.  As a result, his younger brother Prince [[Andrianjaka]] was the first to arrive and inherited the throne.&lt;ref name=&quot;standing&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author = H.F Standing | year = 1887 | title = The Tribal Divisions of the Hova Malagasy | journal = [[The Antananarivo Annual and Madagascar Magazine]]| volume = 11 | pages = 354–363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Board==
The Fanorona board consists of lines and intersections, creating a grid with 5 rows and 9 columns subdivided diagonally to form part of the [[tetrakis square tiling]] of the plane. A line represents the path along which a stone can move during the game. There are weak and strong intersections. At a weak intersection it is only possible to move a stone horizontally and vertically, while on a strong intersection it is also possible to move a stone diagonally. A stone can only move from one intersection to an adjacent intersection.

==Rules==
There exist variations of the rules; this is the main variant.

* Players alternate turns, starting with White.
* There are two kinds of moves: non-capturing and capturing. A non-capturing move is called a ''paika'' move.
* A paika move consists of moving one stone along a line to an adjacent intersection.
* Capturing moves are obligatory and have to be played in preference to paika moves.
* Capturing implies removing one or more pieces of the opponent, in one of two ways:
** Approach—moving the capturing stone to a point adjacent to an opponent's stone, which must be on the continuation of the capturing stone's movement line.
** Withdrawal—the capturing stone moves from a point adjacent to the opponent's stone, away from the stone along the continuation of the line between them.
* When an opponent stone is captured, all opponent pieces in line beyond that stone (as long as there is no interruption by an empty point or an own stone) are captured as well.
* An approach capture and a withdrawal capture cannot be made at the same time – the player must choose one or the other.
* As in [[checkers]], the capturing piece is allowed to continue making successive captures, with these restrictions:
** The piece is not allowed to arrive at the same position twice.
** It is not permitted to move twice consecutively in the same direction (first to make a withdrawal capture, and then to make an approach capture) as part of a capturing sequence.
* However, unlike in checkers, continuing the capturing sequence is optional.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boardspace.net/fanorona/english/rules.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* The game ends when one player captures all stones of the opponent. If neither player can achieve this—for instance if the game reaches a state where neither player can attack the other without overly weakening their own position—then the game is a draw.

==Analysis==
Using 10,000 games with [[Alpha-beta pruning]] players, the [[Game complexity#Game-tree complexity|game-tree complexity]] and [[Game complexity#State-space complexity|state-space complexity]] can be computed. It turns out that Fanorona has a [[Game complexity#Game-tree complexity|game-tree complexity]] of 10&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt; and a [[Game complexity#State-space complexity|state-space complexity]] of 10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;.

In 2007, the game of Fanorona and smaller variants was [[solved game|solved weakly]]. It turns out that this game is a draw. Both the moves f2-e3A and d3-e3A lead to a draw.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schadd2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M.P.D. Schadd |author2=M.H.M. Winands |author3=J.W.H.M.

{{transport}}
'''Human-powered transport''' is the [[transport]] of person(s) and/or goods using [[human]] [[muscle]] power. Like [[animal-powered transport]], human-powered transport has existed since [[time immemorial]] in the form of [[walking]], [[running]] and [[human swimming|swimming]]. Modern [[technology]] has allowed [[machine]]s to enhance human-power.

Although [[Automobile|motorization]] has increased speed and load capacity, many forms of human-powered transport remain popular for reasons of cost, convenience, leisure, physical exercise, and [[environmentalism]]. Human-powered transport is sometimes the only type available, especially in underdeveloped or inaccessible regions.

==Available muscle power==

In the 1989 [[Race Across America]], one team ([[Team Strawberry]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventurecorps.com/when/raam/1989raam.html &quot;The 1989 HPV Race Across America, A Test Of Machine and Man&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; used an experimental device comprising a rear wheel hub, a sensor, and a handlebar mounted processor, to measure each cyclist's power output.

In lab experiments an average &quot;in-shape&quot; cyclist can produce about 3 watts/kg for more than an hour (e.g., around 200 watts for a {{convert|70|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} rider), with top amateurs producing 5 watts/kg and elite athletes achieving 6 watts/kg for similar lengths of time. Elite track sprint cyclists are able to attain an instantaneous maximum output of around 2,000 watts, or in excess of 25 watts/kg; elite road cyclists may produce 1,600 to 1,700 watts as an instantaneous maximum in their burst to the finish line at the end of a five-hour-long road race.

====Coevolution favouring mutualism====
[[File:Wolbachia.png|thumb|left|''[[Wolbachia]]'' bacteria within an insect cell]]

Long-term coevolution sometimes leads to a relatively stable relationship tending to [[commensalism]] or [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], as, all else being equal, it is in the evolutionary interest of the parasite that its host thrives. A parasite may evolve to become less harmful for its host or a host may evolve to cope with the unavoidable presence of a parasite—to the point that the parasite's absence causes the host harm. For example, although animals parasitised by [[helminth|worms]] are often clearly harmed, such infections may also reduce the prevalence and effects of [[Autoimmunity|autoimmune]] disorders in animal hosts, including humans.&lt;ref name=Rook2007&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rook, G.

[[Lynn Margulis]] and others have argued, following [[Peter Kropotkin]]'s 1902 ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'', that natural selection drives relationships from parasitism to mutualism when resources are limited. This process may have been involved in the [[symbiogenesis]] which formed the [[eukaryote]]s from an intracellular relationship between archaea and bacteria, though the sequence of events remains largely undefined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Margulis, Lynn |author1link=Lynn Margulis |author2=Sagan, Dorion |author2link=Dorion Sagan |author3=Eldredge, Niles |author3link=Niles Eldredge |year=1995 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4IIpAQAAMAAJ |title=What Is Life? |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0684810874}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sarkar |first1=Sahotra |last2=Plutynski |first2=Anya |title=A Companion to the Philosophy of Biology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iN7UYNjbxsYC&amp;pg=PA358 |year=2008 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-470-69584-5 |page=358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Competition favoring virulence====

Competition between parasites can be expected to favour faster reproducing and therefore more [[Virulence|virulent]] parasites, by [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name=MasseyBuckling2004&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Massey |first1=R.

[[File:Pink Flamingos with Duck - Camargue, France - April 2007 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Biologists long suspected [[cospeciation]] of [[flamingo]]s and [[duck]]s with their parasitic [[louse|lice]], which were similar in the two families. Cospeciation did occur, but it led to flamingos and [[grebe]]s, with a later [[host switch]] of flamingo lice to ducks.]]

Among competing parasitic insect-killing bacteria of the genera ''[[Photorhabdus]]'' and ''[[Xenorhabdus]]'', virulence depended on the relative potency of the antimicrobial [[toxin]]s ([[bacteriocins]]) produced by the two strains involved. When only one bacterium could kill the other, the other strain was excluded by the competition. But when [[caterpillar]]s were infected with bacteria both of which had toxins able to kill the other strain, neither strain was excluded, and their virulence was less than when the insect was infected by a single strain.&lt;ref name=MasseyBuckling2004/&gt;

====Cospeciation====

A parasite sometimes undergoes [[cospeciation]] with its host, resulting in the pattern described in [[Fahrenholz's rule]], that the phylogenies of the host and parasite come to mirror each other.&lt;ref name=Page&gt;{{cite book | last=Page | first=Roderic D. M. | publisher=John Wiley | date=27 January 2006 | isbn=978-0-470-01617-6 | doi=10.1038/npg.els.0004124| title=Encyclopedia of Life Sciences | chapter=Cospeciation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example is between the [[simian foamy virus]] (SFV) and its primate hosts. The phylogenies of SFV polymerase and the mitochondrial [[cytochrome c oxidase subunit II]] from African and Asian primates were found to be closely congruent in branching order and divergence times, implying that the simian foamy viruses cospeciated with Old World primates for at least 30&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref name=&quot;SwitzerSalemi2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Switzer |first1=William M. |last2=Salemi |first2=Marco |last3=Shanmugam |first3=Vedapuri |last4=Gao |first4=Feng |last5=Cong |first5=Mian-er |last6=Kuiken |first6=Carla |last7=Bhullar |first7=Vinod |last8=Beer |first8=Brigitte E. |last9=Vallet |first9=Dominique |last10=Gautier-Hion |first10=Annie |last11=Tooze |first11=Zena |last12=Villinger |first12=Francois |last13=Holmes |first13=Edward C. |last14=Heneine |first14=Walid |title=Ancient co-speciation of simian foamy viruses and primates |journal=Nature |volume=434 |issue=7031 |year=2005 |pages=376–380 |doi=10.1038/nature03341|pmid=15772660 |bibcode=2005Natur.434..376S |s2cid=4326578 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1233279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presumption of a shared evolutionary history between parasites and hosts can help elucidate how host taxa are related. For instance, there has been a dispute about whether [[Phoenicopteriformes|flamingos]] are more closely related to [[Ciconiiformes|storks]] or [[Anseriformes|ducks]]. The fact that flamingos share parasites with ducks and geese was initially taken as evidence that these groups were more closely related to each other than either is to storks. However, evolutionary events such as the duplication, or the extinction of parasite species (without similar events on the host phylogeny) often erode similarities between host and parasite phylogenies. In the case of flamingos, they have similar lice to those of [[grebe]]s. Flamingos and grebes do have a common ancestor, implying cospeciation of birds and lice in these groups. Flamingo lice then [[host switch|switched hosts]] to ducks, creating the situation which had confused biologists.&lt;ref name=JohnsonKennedy2006&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Johnson| first1=K.

[[File:Toxoplasma gondii (2).jpg|thumb|The protozoan ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'' facilitates its transmission by [[Behavior-altering parasites|inducing behavioral changes]] in rats through infection of neurons in their [[central nervous system]].]]

Parasites infect [[sympatry|sympatric]] hosts (those within their same geographical area) more effectively, as has been shown with [[Digenea|digenetic trematodes]] infecting lake snails.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lively00&quot; /&gt; This is in line with the [[Red Queen's Hypothesis|Red Queen hypothesis]], which states that interactions between species lead to constant natural selection for coadaptation. Parasites track the locally common hosts' phenotypes, so the parasites are less infective to [[allopatric speciation|allopatric]] hosts, those from different geographical regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lively00&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lively, C. M. |author2=Dybdahl, M. F. |url= https://public.wsu.edu/~dybdahl/nature00.pdf | title=Parasite adaptation to locally common host genotypes | journal=Nature | volume=405 | issue=6787 | pages=679–81 | year=2000 | pmid=10864323 | doi=10.1038/35015069 |bibcode=2000Natur.405..679L |s2cid=4387547 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modifying host behaviour===
{{further|Behavior-altering parasites}}

Some parasites [[Behavior-altering parasites|modify host behaviour]] in order to increase their transmission between hosts, often in relation to predator and prey ([[parasite increased trophic transmission]]). For example, in the [[California coastal salt marsh]], the fluke ''[[Euhaplorchis californiensis]]'' reduces the ability of its [[killifish]] host to avoid predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lafferty |first1=K. D. |last2=Morris |first2=A. K. | year=1996 |url= http://parasitology.msi.ucsb.edu/sites/parasitology.msi.ucsb.edu/files/docs/publications/Altered%20Behavior.pdf | title=Altered behavior of parasitized killifish increases susceptibility to predation by bird final hosts | journal=Ecology | volume=77 |issue=5 |pages=1390–1397 | doi=10.2307/2265536 |jstor=2265536 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This parasite matures in [[egret]]s, which are more likely to feed on infected killifish than on uninfected fish. Another example is the protozoan ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', a parasite that matures in [[Felis silvestris catus|cats]] but can be carried by many other [[Mammalia|mammals]]. Uninfected [[Rattus rattus|rats]] avoid cat odors, but rats infected with ''T. gondii'' are drawn to this scent, which may increase transmission to feline hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berdoy |first1=M. |last2=Webster |first2=J.

[[File:Bed bug, Cimex lectularius.jpg|thumb|Trait loss: bed bug, ''[[Cimex lectularius]]'', is flightless, like many insect ectoparasites.]]

===Trait loss===

Parasites can exploit their hosts to carry out a number of functions that they would otherwise have to carry out for themselves. Parasites which lose those functions then have a selective advantage, as they can divert resources to reproduction. Many insect ectoparasites including [[Bed bug (insect)|bedbugs]], [[Polyctenidae|batbugs]], [[lice]] and [[flea]]s have lost their [[insect flight|ability to fly]], relying instead on their hosts for transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alexander |first=David E. |title=On the Wing: Insects, Pterosaurs, Birds, Bats and the Evolution of Animal Flight |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H6xUCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT119 |year=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-999679-7 |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trait loss more generally is widespread among parasites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Poulin |first1=Robert |authorlink=Robert Poulin (zoologist) |url= http://faculty.uml.edu/rhochberg/hochberglab/Courses/Parasite/PDF%20Papers/Parasitology%20Papers/Myths-Realities%20Parasite%20life%20histories.pdf |title=Evolution of parasite life history traits: myths and reality |journal=Parasitology Today |date=September 1995 |volume=11 |issue=9 |pages=342–345 |pmid=15275316 |doi=10.1016/0169-4758(95)80187-1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216194337/http://faculty.uml.edu/rhochberg/hochberglab/Courses/Parasite/PDF%20Papers/Parasitology%20Papers/Myths-Realities%20Parasite%20life%20histories.pdf |archive-date=16 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An extreme example is the [[myxosporea]]n ''[[Henneguya zschokkei]]'', an ectoparasite of fish and the only animal known to have lost the ability to respire aerobically: its cells lack [[mitochondria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PNAS&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Yahalom |first1=Dayana |last2=Atkinson |first2=Stephen D.|last3=Neuhof|first3=Moran |last4=Chang |first4=E.

===Host defences===

Hosts have evolved a variety of defensive measures against their parasites, including physical barriers like the skin of vertebrates,&lt;ref name=Colorado/&gt; the immune system of mammals,&lt;ref name=Maizels2009/&gt; insects actively removing parasites,&lt;ref name=Jeanne1979/&gt; and defensive chemicals in plants.&lt;ref name=Runyon2010/&gt;

The evolutionary biologist [[W. D. Hamilton]] suggested that [[sexual reproduction]] could have evolved to help to defeat multiple parasites by enabling [[genetic recombination]], the shuffling of genes to create varied combinations. Hamilton showed by mathematical modelling that sexual reproduction would be evolutionarily stable in different situations, and that the theory's predictions matched the actual ecology of sexual reproduction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamilton1990&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hamilton | first1=W.

This is because the male hormone [[testosterone]] encourages the growth of secondary sex characteristics, favouring such males in [[sexual selection]], at the price of reducing their immune defences.&lt;ref name=&quot;FolstadKarter1992&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Folstad |first1=Ivar |last2=Karter |first2=Andrew John |url= https://www.academia.edu/17248251 |title=Parasites, Bright Males, and the Immunocompetence Handicap |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=139 |issue=3 |year=1992 |pages=603–622 |doi=10.1086/285346|s2cid=85266542 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vertebrates====
[[File:Short Horned Lizard (4457945238).jpg|thumb|left|The dry [[skin]] of vertebrates such as the [[short-horned lizard]] prevents the entry of many parasites.]]

The physical barrier of the tough and often dry and waterproof [[skin]] of reptiles, birds and mammals keeps invading microorganisms from entering the body. [[Human skin]] also secretes [[sebum]], which is toxic to most microorganisms.&lt;ref name=Colorado&gt;{{cite web |title=Host–Parasite Interactions Innate Defenses of the Host |publisher=University of Colorado |url=http://www.colorado.edu/outreach/BSI/k12activities/interactive/innatedefenses.pdf |access-date=7 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000852/http://www.colorado.edu/outreach/BSI/k12activities/interactive/innatedefenses.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, larger parasites such as [[trematode]]s detect chemicals produced by the skin to locate their hosts when they enter the water. Vertebrate [[saliva]] and tears contain [[lysozyme]], an enzyme that breaks down the [[Bacterial cell structure#Cell wall|cell walls]] of invading bacteria.&lt;ref name=Colorado/&gt; Should the organism pass the mouth, the [[stomach]] with its [[hydrochloric acid]], toxic to most microorganisms, is the next line of defence.&lt;ref name=Colorado/&gt; Some intestinal parasites have a thick, tough outer coating which is digested slowly or not at all, allowing the parasite to pass through the stomach alive, at which point they enter the intestine and begin the next stage of their life. Once inside the body, parasites must overcome the [[immune system]]'s [[serum proteins]] and [[pattern recognition receptors]], intracellular and cellular, that trigger the adaptive immune system's [[lymphocytes]] such as [[T cells]] and antibody-producing [[B cells]]. These have receptors that recognise parasites.&lt;ref name=Maizels2009&gt;{{cite journal | author=Maizels, R. M. | title=Parasite immunomodulation and polymorphisms of the immune system | journal=J.

====Insects====
[[File:Leaf Spot on Oak in Gunnersbury Triangle.jpg|thumb|[[Leaf spot]] on [[oak]]. The spread of the parasitic fungus is limited by defensive chemicals produced by the tree, resulting in circular patches of damaged tissue.]]

Insects often adapt their nests to reduce parasitism. For example, one of the key reasons why the wasp ''[[Polistes canadensis]]'' nests across multiple [[honeycomb|combs]], rather than building a single comb like much of the rest of its genus, is to avoid infestation by [[Tineidae|tineid moths]]. The tineid moth lays its eggs within the wasps' nests and then these eggs hatch into larvae that can burrow from cell to cell and prey on wasp pupae. Adult wasps attempt to remove and kill moth eggs and larvae by chewing down the edges of cells, coating the cells with an oral secretion that gives the nest a dark brownish appearance.&lt;ref name=Jeanne1979&gt;{{cite journal | author=Jeanne, Robert L. | year=1979 |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226226828 | title=Construction and Utilization of Multiple Combs in Polistes canadensis in Relation to the Biology of a Predaceous Moth | journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume=4 | issue=3| pages=293–310 | doi=10.1007/bf00297649| s2cid=36132488 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plants====

Plants respond to parasite attack with a series of chemical defences, such as [[polyphenol oxidase]], under the control of the [[jasmonic acid|jasmonic acid-insensitive]] (JA) and [[salicylic acid]] (SA) signalling pathways.&lt;ref name=Runyon2010&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Runyon, J.

===Ecology and parasitology===

Parasitism and parasite evolution were until the twenty-first century studied by [[parasitology|parasitologists]], in a science dominated by medicine, rather than by [[ecology|ecologists]] or [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]]. Even though parasite–host interactions were plainly ecological and important in evolution, the history of parasitology caused what the evolutionary ecologist Robert Poulin called a &quot;takeover of parasitism by parasitologists&quot;, leading ecologists to ignore the area. This was in his opinion &quot;unfortunate&quot;, as parasites are &quot;omnipresent agents of natural selection&quot; and significant forces in evolution and ecology.{{sfn|Poulin|2007|pages=x, 1–2}} In his view, the long-standing split between the sciences limited the exchange of ideas, with separate conferences and separate journals. The technical languages of ecology and parasitology sometimes involved different meanings for the same words. There were philosophical differences, too: Poulin notes that, influenced by medicine, &quot;many parasitologists accepted that evolution led to a decrease in parasite virulence, whereas modern evolutionary theory would have predicted a greater range of outcomes&quot;.{{sfn|Poulin|2007|pages=x, 1–2}}

[[File:Condor in flight.JPG|thumb|upright|The rescuing from extinction of the [[California condor]] was a successful if very expensive project, but its [[ectoparasite]], the [[louse]] ''[[Colpocephalum californici]]'', was made extinct.]]

Their complex relationships make parasites difficult to place in food webs: a trematode with multiple hosts for its various life cycle stages would occupy many positions in a [[food web]] simultaneously, and would set up loops of energy flow, confusing the analysis.  Further, since nearly every animal has (multiple) parasites, parasites would occupy the top levels of every food web.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sukhdeo2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sukhdeo | first=Michael V.K. | title=Where are the parasites in food webs? | journal=Parasites &amp; Vectors | volume=5 | issue=1 | year=2012 | doi=10.1186/1756-3305-5-239 | pmid=23092160 | pmc=3523981 | page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parasites can play a role in the proliferation of non-native species. For example, invasive green crabs are minimally affected by native trematodes on the Eastern Atlantic coast. This helps them outcompete native crabs such as the rock and Jonah crabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blakeslee |first1=April M.

Ecological parasitology can be important to attempts at control, like during the [[Eradication of dracunculiasis|campaign for eradicating the Guinea worm]]. Even though the parasite was eradicated in all but four countries, the worm began using frogs as an intermediary host before infecting dogs, making control more difficult than it would have been if the relationships had been better understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eberhard |first=M.

===Rationale for conservation===
{{further|Conservation biology of parasites}}

Although parasites are widely considered to be harmful, the eradication of all parasites would not be beneficial. Parasites account for at least half of life's diversity; they perform important ecological roles; and without parasites, organisms might tend to asexual reproduction, diminishing the diversity of traits brought about by sexual reproduction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holt2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Holt, R.

The presence of parasites thus indicates that an ecosystem is healthy.&lt;ref name=&quot;HudsonDobson2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hudson |first1=Peter J. |last2=Dobson |first2=Andrew P. |last3=Lafferty |first3=Kevin D. |url= http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/p/j/pjh18/downloads/184_Hudson_2006_Healthy_ecosystem_is_infected_TREE.pdf |title=Is a healthy ecosystem one that is rich in parasites? |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=21 |issue=7 |year=2006 |pages=381–385 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2006.04.007|pmid=16713014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810105426/http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/p/j/pjh18/downloads/184_Hudson_2006_Healthy_ecosystem_is_infected_TREE.pdf |archive-date=10 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ectoparasite, the California condor louse, ''[[Colpocephalum californici]]'', became a well-known conservation issue. A major and very costly captive breeding program was run in the United States to rescue the [[Californian condor]]. It was host to a louse, which lived only on it. Any lice found were &quot;deliberately killed&quot; during the program, to keep the condors in the best possible health. The result was that one species, the condor, was saved and returned to the wild, while another species, the parasite, became extinct.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stringer2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stringer |first1=Andrew Paul |last2=Linklater |first2=Wayne |title=Everything in Moderation: Principles of Parasite Control for Wildlife Conservation |journal=BioScience |date=2014 |volume=64 |issue=10 |pages=932–937 |doi=10.1093/biosci/biu135 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although parasites are often omitted in depictions of [[food web]]s, they usually occupy the top position. Parasites can function like [[keystone species]], reducing the dominance of superior competitors and allowing [[competition (biology)|competing species]] to co-exist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sukhdeo2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LaffertyAllesina2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lafferty |first1=Kevin D. |last2=Allesina |first2=Stefano |last3=Arim |first3=Matias |last4=Briggs |first4=Cherie J. |display-authors=etal |title=Parasites in food webs: the ultimate missing links |journal=Ecology Letters |volume=11 |issue=6|year=2008 |pages=533–546 |doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2008.01174.x|pmid=18462196 |pmc=2408649 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chase2013&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chase |first1=Jonathan |title=Parasites in Food Webs: Untangling the Entangled Bank |journal=PLOS Biology |volume=11 |issue=6 |year=2013 |pages=e1001580 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001580|pmid=23776405 |pmc=3678997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aggregated distribution of parasites on hosts.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Parasites are [[Aggregated distribution|distributed very unevenly]] among their hosts, most hosts having no parasites, and a few hosts harbouring most of the parasite population. This distribution makes sampling difficult and requires careful use of statistics.]]

===Quantitative ecology===
{{further|Aggregated distribution}}

A single parasite species usually has an aggregated distribution across host animals, which means that most hosts carry few parasites, while a few hosts carry the vast majority of parasite individuals. This poses considerable problems for students of parasite ecology, as it renders [[parametric statistics]] as commonly used by biologists invalid. [[Data transformation (statistics)#Logarithmic transformation|Log-transformation]] of data before the application of parametric test, or the use of [[non-parametric statistics]] is recommended by several authors, but this can give rise to further problems, so quantitative parasitology is based on more advanced biostatistical methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10780537&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rózsa |first1=L. |last2=Reiczigel |first2=J. |last3=Majoros |first3=G. |url= http://www.zoologia.hu/list/quant_large.pdf | title=Quantifying parasites in samples of hosts | journal=J.

===Ancient===
{{further|Human parasite}}

[[Human parasite]]s including roundworms, the [[Guinea worm]], [[Pinworm (parasite)|threadworms]] and tapeworms are mentioned in Egyptian papyrus records from 3000 BC onwards; the [[Ebers papyrus]] describes [[hookworm]]. In [[ancient Greece]], parasites including the [[bladder worm]] are described in the [[Hippocratic Corpus]], while the comic playwright [[Aristophanes]] called tapeworms &quot;hailstones&quot;. The Roman physicians Celsus and [[Galen]] documented the roundworms ''[[Ascaris lumbricoides]]'' and ''[[Enterobius vermicularis]]''.&lt;ref name=Cox2004&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cox, Francis E.

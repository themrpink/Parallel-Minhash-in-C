The first stage in the British plan was a preparatory attack on the German positions south of Ypres at Messines Ridge. The Germans on the ridge had observation over Ypres and unless it was captured, observed [[enfilade]] artillery-fire could be fired against a British attack from the salient further north.{{sfn|Sheldon|2007|p=1}} Since mid-1915, the British had been [[Mining (military)|mining]] under the German positions on the ridge and by June 1917, [[Mines in the Battle of Messines (1917)|21 mines]] had been filled with nearly {{cvt|1000000|lb|t|0}} of explosives.{{sfn|Hart|Steel|2001|pp=41–44}} The Germans knew the British were mining and had taken counter-measures but they were surprised at the extent of the British effort.{{sfn|Sheldon|2007|p=23}} Two of the mines failed to detonate but {{nowrap|19 went}} off on 7 June, at {{nowrap|3:10 a.m.}} [[British Summer Time]]. The final objectives were largely gained before dark and the British had fewer losses than the expected {{nowrap|50 per cent in}} the initial attack. As the infantry advanced over the far edge of the ridge, German artillery and machine-guns east of the ridge opened fire and the British artillery was less able to suppress them.{{sfn|Hart|Steel|2001|p=55}} The attack removed the Germans from the dominating ground on the southern face of the Ypres salient, which the 4th Army had held since the First Battle of Ypres in 1914.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=87}}

Haig selected Gough to command the offensive on 30 April, and on 10 June Gough and the Fifth Army headquarters took over the Ypres salient north of Messines Ridge. Gough planned an offensive based on the ''GHQ 1917'' plan and the instructions he had received from Haig.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=127}} Gough held meetings with his corps commanders on 6 and 16 June, where the third objective, which included the {{lang|de|Wilhelmstellung}} (third line), a second-day objective in earlier plans, was added to the two objectives due to be taken on the first day. A fourth objective, the red line was also given for the first day, to be attempted by fresh troops, at the discretion of divisional and corps commanders, in places where the German defence had collapsed.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=126–127, 431–432}} The attack was not planned as a breakthrough operation and {{lang|de|Flandern I Stellung}}, the fourth German defensive position, lay {{cvt|10000|–|12000|yd|mi+km}} behind the front line and was not an objective on the first day.{{sfn|Prior|Wilson|1996|pp=72–75}}

The Fifth Army plan was more ambitious than the plans devised by Rawlinson and Plumer, which had involved an advance of {{cvt|1000|–|1750|yd|m}} on the first day, by compressing their first three attacks into one day instead of three.{{sfn|Prior|Wilson|1996|pp=72–75}} Major-General [[John Humphrey Davidson|John Davidson]], Director of Operations at GHQ, wrote in a memorandum that there was &quot;ambiguity as to what was meant by a step-by-step attack with limited objectives&quot; and suggested reverting to a {{cvt|1750|yd|m}} advance on the first day to increase the concentration of British artillery.{{sfn|Davidson|2010|p=29}} Gough stressed the need to plan to exploit opportunities to take ground left temporarily undefended, more likely in the first attack, which would have the benefit of long preparation. This had not been done in earlier battles and vacant ground, there for the taking, had been re-occupied by the Germans. At the end of June, Haig added a division to II Corps (Lieutenant-General [[Claud Jacob]]) from the Second Army and next day, after meeting with Gough and General [[Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer|Herbert Plumer]], the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] commander, Haig endorsed the Fifth Army plan.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=440}}

====Battle of Pilckem Ridge====

{{main|Battle of Pilckem Ridge}}

[[File:The Battle of Passchendaele, July-november 1917 Q5726.jpg|thumb|{{centre|German prisoners and British wounded cross the Yser Canal near Boesinghe, 31 July 1917. (Q5726)}}]]
The British attack began at {{nowrap|3:50 a.m.}} on 31 July; the attack was to commence at dawn but a layer of unbroken low cloud meant that it was still dark when the infantry advanced.{{sfn|Prior|Wilson|1996|p=89}} The main attack, by [[II Corps (United Kingdom)|II Corps]] across the Ghelveult Plateau to the south, confronted the principal German defensive concentration of artillery, ground-holding divisions ({{lang|de|Stellungsdivisionen}}) and {{lang|de|Eingreif}} divisions. The attack had most success on the northern flank, on the fronts of [[XIV Corps (United Kingdom)|XIV Corps]] and the French First Army, both of which advanced {{cvt|2500|–|3000|yd|mi+km}} to the line of the Steenbeek river. In the centre, [[XVIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XVIII Corps]] and [[XIX Corps (United Kingdom)|XIX Corps]] pushed forward to the line of the Steenbeek (black line) to consolidate and sent fresh troops towards the green line and on the XIX Corps front to the red line, for an advance of about {{cvt|4000|yd|m}}. Group Ypres counter-attacked the flanks of the British break-in, supported by every artillery piece and aircraft within range, around noon. The Germans were able to drive the three British brigades back to the black line with {{nowrap|70 percent}} casualties; the German advance was stopped at the black line by mud, artillery and machine-gun fire.{{sfn|Prior|Wilson|1996|pp=90–95}}

====Capture of Westhoek====

{{main|Capture of Westhoek}}

[[File:German defensive system, Flanders, mid-1917.jpg|thumb|{{centre|German defensive system, Flanders, mid-1917}}]]
After rain delays from 2 August, II Corps attacked again on 10 August, to capture the rest of the black line (second objective) on the Gheluvelt plateau. The infantry advance succeeded but German artillery-fire and infantry counter-attacks isolated the infantry of the 18th (Eastern) Division in Glencorse Wood. At about {{nowrap|7:00 p.m.,}} German infantry attacked behind a smokescreen and recaptured all but the north-west corner of the wood; only the 25th Division gains on Westhoek Ridge to the north were held.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=185–187}} Lieutenant-Colonel [[Albrecht von Thaer]], Chief of Staff of {{lang|de|Gruppe Wijtschate}} (Group Wytschaete, the headquarters of the [[IX Reserve Corps (German Empire)|IX Reserve Corps]]), noted that casualties after {{nowrap|14 days}} in the line averaged {{nowrap|1,500–2,000 men,}} compared to {{nowrap|4,000 men}} on the Somme in 1916 and that German troop morale was higher than the year before.{{sfn|Liddle|1997|pp=45–58}}

====Battle of Hill 70====

{{Main|Capture of Oppy Wood|Battle of Hill 70}}

Attacks to threaten Lens and Lille were to be made by the [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] in late June near Gavrelle and Oppy, along the Souchez river. The objective was to eliminate a German salient between Avion and the west end of [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]], by taking reservoir Hill (Hill 65) and Hill 70. The attacks were conducted earlier than planned to use heavy and siege artillery before it was transferred to Ypres, the Souchez operation being cut back and the attack on Hill 70 postponed.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=112–113}} The Battle of Hill 70, {{cvt|30|mi|km}} south of Ypres, eventually took place from 15 to 25 August. The [[Canadian Corps]] fought four divisions of the German [[6th Army (German Empire)|6th Army]] in the operation. The capture of Hill 70 was a costly success in which three Canadian divisions inflicted many casualties on the German divisions opposite and pinned down troops reserved for the relief of tired divisions in Flanders.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=219–230}} [[Hermann von Kuhl]], chief of staff of Army Group Crown Prince Rupprecht, wrote later that it was a costly defeat and wrecked the plan for relieving fought-out (exhausted) divisions in Flanders.{{sfn|Terraine|1977|p=234}}

====Battle of Langemarck====

{{main|Battle of Langemarck (1917)|Operation Hush}}

The Battle of Langemarck was fought from {{nowrap|16–18 August;}} the Fifth Army headquarters was influenced by the effect that delay would have on Operation Hush, which needed the high tides due at the end of August or it would have to be postponed for a month. Gough intended that the rest of the green line, just beyond the {{lang|de|Wilhelmstellung}} (German third line), from Polygon Wood to Langemarck, was to be captured and the Steenbeek crossed further north.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=189–202}} In the II Corps area, the disappointment of 10 August was repeated, with the infantry managing to advance, then being isolated by German artillery and forced back to their start line by German counter-attacks, except in the 25th Division area near Westhoek. Attempts by the German infantry to advance further were stopped by British artillery-fire with many casualties.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=194}} The advance further north in the XVIII Corps area retook and held the north end of St Julien and the area south-east of Langemarck, while XIV Corps captured Langemarck and the {{lang|de|Wilhelmstellung}} north of the Ypres–Staden railway, near the Kortebeek stream. The French First Army conformed, pushing up to the Kortebeek and St Jansbeck stream west of the northern stretch of the {{lang|de|Wilhelmstellung}}, where it crossed to the east side of the Kortebeek.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=201}}

====Local attacks====

[[File:AAGunMorbecque29August1917-2.jpeg|thumb|{{centre|British anti-aircraft gun at Morbecque, 29 August 1917}}]]
On the higher ground, the Germans continued to inflict many losses on the British divisions beyond Langemarck but on 19 August, after two fine dry days, XVIII Corps conducted a novel infantry, tank, aircraft and artillery operation. German strongpoints and pillboxes along the St Julien–Poelcappelle road in front of the {{lang|de|Wilhelmstellung}} were captured. On 22 August, more ground was gained by XIX and XVIII corps but the tactical disadvantage of being overlooked by the Germans continued.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=203}} A II Corps attack on the Gheluvelt Plateau from 22 to 24 August, to capture Nonne Bosschen, Glencorse Wood and Inverness Copse, failed in fighting that was costly to both sides.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=202–205}} Gough laid down a new infantry formation of skirmish lines to be followed by &quot;worms&quot; on 24 August and Cavan noted that pillboxes should be attacked on a broad front, to engage them simultaneously.{{sfn|Simpson|2001|pp=130–134}} Another general offensive intended for 25 August, was delayed by the failure of the preliminary attacks and then postponed due to more bad weather.{{sfn|Rogers|2010|pp=162–167}} On 27 August, II Corps tried a combined tank and infantry attack but the tanks bogged, the attack failed and Haig called a halt to operations until the weather improved.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=208}}

====Weather====
[[File:The Battle of Passchendaele, July-november 1917 Q6236.jpg|thumb|left|{{centre|Royal Field Artillery gunners hauling an 18-pounder field gun out of the mud near Zillebeke, 9 August 1917}}]]
In ''Field Marshal Earl Haig'' (1929), Brigadier-General [[John Charteris]], the BEF Chief of Intelligence from 1915 to 1918, wrote that

{{quote|Careful investigation of records of more than eighty years showed that in Flanders the weather broke early each August with the regularity of the Indian monsoon: once the Autumn rains set in difficulties would be greatly enhanced....Unfortunately, there now set in the wettest August for thirty years.|Charteris{{sfn|Charteris|1929|pp=272–273}}}}

only the first part of which was quoted by Lloyd George (1934), Liddell Hart (1934) and Leon Wolff (1959); in a 1997 essay, John Hussey called the passage by Charteris &quot;baffling&quot;.{{sfn|Hussey|1997|p=155}} The BEF had set up a Meteorological Section under [[Ernest Gold (meteorologist)|Ernest Gold]] in 1915, which by the end of 1917 had {{nowrap|16 officers}} and {{nowrap|82 men.}} The section predicted the warm weather and thunderstorms of 7 to 14 June; in a letter to the press of 17 January 1958, Gold wrote that the facts of the Flanders climate contradicted Charteris.{{sfn|Hussey|1997|p=153}} In 1989, Philip Griffiths examined August weather in Flanders for the thirty years before 1916 and found that,

{{quote|...there is no reason to suggest that the weather broke early in the month with any regularity.|Griffiths{{sfn|Hussey|1997|pp=147–148}}}}

From 1901 to 1916, records from a weather station at [[Cap Gris Nez]] showed that {{nowrap|65 percent}} of August days were dry and that from 1913 to 1916, there were {{nowrap|26, 23, 23 and 21}} rainless days and monthly rainfall of {{cvt|17|,|28|,|22|and| 96|mm|in}};

{{quote|...during the summers preceding the Flanders campaign August days were more often dry than wet.|Griffiths{{sfn|Hussey|1997|p=148}}}}

There were {{cvt|127|mm|in|0}} of rain in August 1917 and {{cvt|84|mm|in|0}} of the total fell on {{nowrap|1, 8, 14, 26 and}} {{nowrap|27 August.}} The month was overcast and windless, which much reduced evaporation. Divided into two ten-day and an eleven-day period, there were {{cvt|53.6|,|32.4|and|41.3|mm|in|0}} of rain; in the {{nowrap|61 hours}} before {{nowrap|6:00 p.m.}} on 31 July, {{cvt|12.5|mm|in|0}} fell. From {{nowrap|6:00 p.m.}} on 31 July to {{nowrap|6:00 p.m.}} on 4 August, there was another {{cvt|63|mm|in|0}} of rain. August 1917 had three dry days and {{nowrap|14 days}} with less than {{cvt|1|mm|in|0}} of rain. Three days were sunless and one had six minutes of sunshine; from 1 to 27 August there were {{nowrap|178.1 hours}} of sunshine, an average of {{nowrap|6.6 hours}} per day. Hussey wrote that the wet weather in August 1917 was exceptional, Haig had been justified in expecting little rain, swiftly dried by sunshine and breezes.{{sfn|Hussey|1997|pp=149–151}}

====Verdun====

{{main|Battle of Verdun#French counter-offensives in late 1916 and August 1917|l1=Verdun, August 1917}}

Petain had committed the French Second Army to an attack at Verdun in mid-July, in support of the Flanders offensive. The attack was delayed, partly due to mutinies in the French army after the failure of the [[Nivelle Offensive]] and because of a German attack at Verdun from 28 to 29 June, which captured some of the French jumping-off points. A French counter-attack on 17 July re-captured the ground, the Germans regained it on 1 August, then took ground on the east bank on 16 August.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|pp=380–383}} The French attack on 20 August and by 9 September had taken {{nowrap|10,000 prisoners.}} Sporadic fighting continued into October, adding to the German difficulties on the Western Front and elsewhere. Ludendorff wrote

{{quote|On the left bank, close to the Meuse, one division had failed&amp;nbsp;... and yet both here and in Flanders everything possible had been done to avoid failure&amp;nbsp;... The French army was once more capable of the offensive. It had quickly overcome its depression.|Ludendorff: ''Memoirs''{{sfn|Terraine|1977|p=235}}}}

No German counter-attack was possible because the local {{lang|de|Eingreif}} divisions had been transferred to Flanders.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=230}}

===September–October===

{{main|Western Front tactics, 1917#The British set-piece attack in late 1917|l1=The British set-piece attack in late 1917}}

[[File:The Battle of Passchendaele, July-november 1917 Q6416.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Derelict tank used as the roof of a dug out, Zillebeke, 20 September 1917 (Q6416)}}]]
The [[4th Army (German Empire)|4th Army]] had held on to the Gheluvelt Plateau in August but its casualties worsened the German manpower shortage.{{sfn|Sheldon|2007|pp=119–120}} Haig transferred the main offensive effort to the Second Army on 25 August and moved the northern boundary of the Second Army closer to the Ypres–Roulers railway. More heavy artillery was sent to Flanders from the armies further south and placed opposite the Gheluvelt Plateau.{{sfn|Nicholson|1964|p=308}} Plumer continued the tactical evolution of the Fifth Army during its slow and costly progress in August. After a pause of about three weeks, Plumer intended to capture the plateau in four steps, with six-day intervals to bring forward artillery and supplies.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=237}} The Second Army attacks were to remain limited and infantry brigade tactics were changed to attack the first objective with a battalion each and the final one with two battalions, the opposite of the Fifth Army practice on 31 July, to adapt to the dispersed defences being encountered between the {{lang|de|Albrechtstellung}} and the {{lang|de|Wilhelmstellung}}.{{sfn|Marble|2003|loc=App 22}}

Plumer arranged for the medium and heavy artillery reinforcements reaching Flanders to be added to the creeping bombardment, which had been impossible with the amount of artillery available to the Fifth Army.{{sfn|Marble|2003|loc=App 22}} The tactical changes ensured that more infantry attacked on narrower fronts, to a shallower depth than on 31 July, like the Fifth Army attacks in August. The shorter and quicker advances possible once the ground dried, were intended to be consolidated on tactically advantageous ground, especially on any reverse slopes in the area, with the infantry still in contact with the artillery and aircraft, ready to repulse counter-attacks.{{sfn|Nicholson|1964|p=308}} The faster tempo of operations was intended to add to German difficulties in replacing tired divisions through the railway bottlenecks behind the German front.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=236–242}} The pause in British attacks misled the some of the German commanders and Thaer, the Chief of Staff of {{lang|de|Gruppe Wijtschate}}, wrote that it was ''almost boring''.{{sfn|Liddle|1997|pp=45–58}} Kuhl doubted that the offensive had ended but had changed his mind by 13 September; two divisions, thirteen heavy artillery batteries, twelve field batteries, three fighter squadrons and four other units of the {{lang|de|Luftstreitkräfte}} were transferred from the 4th Army.{{sfn|Terraine|1977|p=257}}

====German tactical changes====

{{main|Western Front tactics, 1917#German defensive changes: late 1917|l1=German defensive changes: late 1917}}

After setting objectives {{cvt|1|–|2|mi|km}} distant on 31 July, the British attempted shorter advances of approximately {{cvt|1500|yd|m}} in August but were unable to achieve these lesser objectives on the south side of the battlefield, because the rain soaked ground and poor visibility were to the advantage of the defenders. After the dry spell in early September, British advances had been much quicker and the final objective was reached a few hours after dawn, which confounded the German counter-attack divisions. Having crossed {{cvt|2|mi|km}} of mud, the {{lang|de|Eingreif}} divisions found the British already dug in, with the German forward battle zone and its weak garrison gone beyond recapture.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|p=303}} In August, German front-line divisions had two regiments deployed in the front line, with the third regiment in reserve. The front battalions had needed to be relieved much more frequently than expected, due to the power of British attacks, constant artillery-fire and the weather. Replacement units became mixed up with ones holding the front and reserve regiments had failed to intervene quickly, leaving front battalions unsupported until {{lang|de|Eingreif}} divisions arrived some hours later.{{sfn|Rogers|2010|p=168}}

In July and August, German counter-attack ({{lang|de|Eingreif}}) divisions had conducted an &quot;advance to contact during mobile operations&quot;, which had given the Germans several costly defensive successes.{{sfn|Sheldon|2007|p=184}} After the [[Battle of the Menin Road Ridge]], German tactics were changed.{{sfn|Rogers|2010|p=168}} After another defeat on 26 September, the German commanders made more tactical changes to counter the more conservative form of limited attacks adopted by the British.{{sfn|Sheldon|2007|p=184}} German counter-attacks in September had been &quot;assaults on reinforced field positions&quot;, due to the restrained nature of British infantry advances. The fine weather in early September had greatly eased British supply difficulties, especially in ammunition and the British made time to establish a defence in depth on captured ground, protected by standing artillery barrages. The British attacked in dry, clear conditions, with more aircraft over the battlefield for counter-attack reconnaissance, contact patrol and ground-attack operations. Systematic defensive artillery-fire was forfeited by the Germans, due to uncertainty over the position of their infantry, just when the British infantry benefited from the opposite. German counter-attacks were costly failures and on 28 September, Thaer wrote that the experience was &quot;awful&quot; and that he did not know what to do.{{sfnm|1a1=Edmonds|1y=1991|1pp=294–295|2a1=Liddle|2y=1997|2pp=45–58}}

Ludendorff ordered the {{lang|de|Stellungsdivisionen}} (ground holding divisions) to reinforce their front garrisons; all machine-guns, including those of the support and reserve battalions were sent into the forward zone, to form a cordon of four to eight guns every {{cvt|250|yd|m}}.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|pp=307–308}} The {{lang|de|Stellungsdivisionen}} were reinforced by the {{lang|de|Stoß}} regiments of {{lang|de|Eingreif}} divisions, which were moved into the artillery protective line behind the forward battle zone, to counter-attack sooner. The other regiments of the {{lang|de|Eingreif}} divisions were to be held back and used for a methodical counter-attack ({{lang|de|Gegenangriff}}) a day or two after and for spoiling attacks as the British reorganised.{{sfnm|1a1=Sheldon|1y=2007|1pp=190–191|2a1=Wynne|2y=1976|2p=307}}{{efn|The [[4th Guards Infantry Division (German Empire)|4th Guards Division]], [[4th Royal Bavarian Division|4th Bavarian Division]], [[6th Royal Bavarian Division|6th Bavarian Division]], [[10th Ersatz Division (German Empire)|10th Ersatz Division]], [[16th Division (German Empire)|16th Division]], [[19th Reserve Division (German Empire)|19th Reserve Division]], [[20th Division (German Empire)|20th Division]], 187th Division, 195th Division and [[45th Reserve Division (German Empire)|45th Reserve Division]] took part in the battle.{{sfn|USWD|1920|nopp=y}}}} More tactical changes were ordered on 30 September; operations to increase British infantry losses were to continue and gas bombardments were to be increased, weather permitting. Every effort was to be made to induce the British to reinforce their forward positions with infantry for the German artillery to bombard them.{{sfn|Sheldon|2007|pp=184–186}} Between 26 September and 3 October, the Germans attacked at least {{nowrap|24 times}} and Operation High Storm {{lang|de|Unternehmen Hohensturm}}, a {{lang|de|Gegenangriff}} (methodical counter-attack), to recapture the area around Zonnebeke was planned for 4 October.{{sfnm|1a1=Terraine|1y=1977|1p=278|2a1=Prior|2a2=Wilson|2y=1996|2p=135}}

====Battle of the Menin Road Ridge====

{{Main|Battle of the Menin Road Ridge}}

[[File:Battle of Menin Road - wounded at side of the road.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Wounded men at the side of a road after the Battle of Menin Road}}]]
The British plan for the battle fought from {{nowrap|20–25 September,}} included more emphasis on the use of heavy and medium artillery to destroy German concrete pill-boxes and machine-gun nests, which were more numerous in the battle zones being attacked, than behind the original July front line and to engage in more counter-battery fire. The British had {{nowrap|575 heavy}} and medium and {{nowrap|720 field}} guns and howitzers, more than double the quantity of artillery available at the Battle of Pilckem Ridge.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=238–239}} Aircraft were to be used for systematic air observation of German troop movements to avoid the failures of previous battles, where too few aircrews had been burdened with too many duties and had flown in bad weather, which multiplied their difficulties.{{sfn|Jones|2002|p=181}}

On 20 September, the Allies attacked on a {{cvt|14500|yd|mi+km}} front and by mid-morning, had captured most of their objectives, to a depth of about {{cvt|1500|yd|m}}.{{sfn|Terraine|1977|p=261}} The Germans made many hasty counter-attacks ({{lang|de|Gegenstoße}}), beginning around {{nowrap|3:00 p.m.}} until early evening, all of which failed to gain ground or made only a temporary penetration of the new British positions. The German defence had failed to stop a well-prepared attack made in good weather.{{sfn|Harris|2008|p=366}} Minor attacks took place after 20 September, as both sides jockeyed for position and reorganised their defences. A mutually-costly attack by the Germans on 25 September, recaptured pillboxes at the south western end of Polygon Wood. Next day, the German positions near the wood were swept away in the Battle of Polygon Wood.{{sfn|Sheldon|2007|p=165}}

====German counter-attack, 25 September====

{{main|Action of 25 September 1917}}

Two regiments of the German [[50th Reserve Division (German Empire)|50th Reserve Division]] attacked on a {{cvt|1800|yd|m}} front, either side of the Reutelbeek, supported by aircraft and {{nowrap|44 field}} and {{nowrap|20 heavy}} batteries of artillery, four times the usual amount for a division. The German infantry managed to advance on the flanks, about {{cvt|100|yd|m}} near the Menin road and {{cvt|600|yd|m}} north of the Reutelbeek. The infantry were supported by artillery-observation and ground-attack aircraft; a box-barrage was fired behind the British front-line, which isolated the British infantry from reinforcements and ammunition. Return-fire from the [[33rd Division (United Kingdom)|33rd Division]] and the [[15th Brigade (Australia)|15th Australian Brigade]] of the [[5th Division (Australia)|5th Australian Division]] along the southern edge of Polygon Wood to the north, forced the attackers under cover around some of the {{lang|de|Wilhelmstellung}} pillboxes, near Black Watch Corner, at the south-western edge of Polygon Wood. German attempts to reinforce the attacking troops failed, due to British artillery observers isolating the advanced German troops with artillery barrages.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=282–284}}

Plumer ordered the attack due on 26 September to go ahead but reduced the objectives of the 33rd Division. The 98th Brigade was to advance and cover the right flank of the 5th Australian Division and the 100th Brigade was to re-capture the lost ground further south. The 5th Australian Division advance the next day began with uncertainty as to the security of its right flank; the attack of the depleted 98th Brigade was delayed and only managed to reach Black Watch Corner, {{cvt|1000|yd|m}} short of its objectives. Reinforcements moved into the 5th Australian Division area and attacked south-westwards at noon as a silent (without artillery support) frontal attack was made from Black Watch Corner, because British troops were known to be holding out in the area. The attack succeeded by {{nowrap|2:00 p.m.}} and later in the afternoon, the 100th Brigade re-took the ground lost north of the Menin road. Casualties in the 33rd Division were so great that it was relieved on 27 September by the 23rd Division, which had only been withdrawn on the night of {{nowrap|24/25 September.}}{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=286–287}}

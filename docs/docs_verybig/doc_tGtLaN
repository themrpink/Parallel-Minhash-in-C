===History of the Rose Festival===
The first rose festival first took place in 1976, when council members decided that hosting such a festival was appropriate, given the area's name. In 1976 the events spanned over a few days and included activities related to roses in the [[Sanlam]] Plaza. Since then, the rose festival has expanded and grown to meet the needs and interests of the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;internext.co.za&quot;/&gt;

===Activities===

==Transport==

===Road===

Bloemfontein's national and regional roads are as follows: The [[N1 road (South Africa)|N1]], a major highway running roughly SE to NW from [[Cape Town]] to [[Johannesburg]] and [[Zimbabwe]] largely bypasses this city to the west. The [[N8 road (South Africa)|N8]] runs east/west connecting Bloemfontein to [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] and [[Maseru]], the capital of [[Lesotho]]. Bloemfontein is also the northern end of the [[N6 road (South Africa)|N6 road]] heading roughly southwards to the port of [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]]. At a T-junction just before the city, the N6 becomes the M30, and the intersecting road is designated the N6. This road ends in an interchange with the N1.

There are also two two-digit R routes: the [[R64 road (South Africa)|R64]], which is the old road to Kimberley, via [[Dealesville]] and [[Boshof]]. It ends at the N1. The [[R30 road (South Africa)|R30]] ends at the N1 north of the town. It is the road to [[Welkom]].

Three other three-digit R routes have their origin in Bloemfontein. The [[R706 road (South Africa)|R706]] takes origin from the N8 in the city centre, and heads south-west towards [[Jagersfontein]] and [[Fauresmith]]. The [[R702 road (South Africa)|R702]] also originates from the N8 in the city centre, but heads south-east towards the towns of [[Dewetsdorp]] and [[Wepener]]. The third road, the [[R700 road (South Africa)|R700]], starts south of the city centre from the M30 and heads north crossing the N8 and N1 towards [[Bultfontein]]

Below that level, Bloemfontein has a number of metropolitan or [[Metropolitan routes in Bloemfontein|M roads]]. These roads are numbered independently of m roads in other South African cities.

===Rail===

Bloemfontein is well connected with rail. It is located on the most important rail junction between [[Johannesburg]] and [[Cape Town]], with daily trains to [[Port Elizabeth]], [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]] and [[Johannesburg]].

===Air===
Bloemfontein has two airports [[New Tempe Aerodrome]] and [[Bram Fischer International Airport]]. [[New Tempe Aerodrome]] has no scheduled flights, it is used as a training facility for aviators and schools.

== Reception ==
In January 2009, IGN named ''Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends'' as the 59th best in the Top 100 Animated Series.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN Top 100&quot; /&gt;

== Comics ==
=== Adaptation ===
The first comic book that directly referenced the ''Amazing Friends'' show was ''Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends'' #1 (December 1981), a [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] that adapted the [[pilot episode]], &quot;The Triumph of the Green Goblin&quot;. Though the comic version altered the story to bring it in line with established [[Marvel Universe]] continuity (such as making the Green Goblin identity a costume as in the comics, rather than a physical transformation as in the episode), it was not considered part of said continuity. It is notable as the first appearance of Firestar in a Marvel Comics story, though the version of Firestar that exists within Marvel continuity would not appear until ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #193 (May 1985).

The story was reprinted in England in late 1983 in the weekly [[Marvel UK]] title ''[[Spider-Man Comics Weekly|Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]''. It was reprinted in the U.S. as ''Marvel Action Universe'' #1 (January 1989), released to coincide with the airing of ''Amazing Friends'' reruns on the [[Marvel Action Universe|television series of the same name]] and on the 2017 [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] ''X-Men Origins: Firestar''.

In the Marvel mainstream continuity, Spider-Man, Firestar and Iceman have made sporadic team-ups in ''Amazing X-Men'' #7 (July 2014) and ''Iceman'' #3 (November 2018).

=== Firestar ===
After her aforementioned initial appearance, the Marvel Comics version of Firestar debuted in the pages of ''Uncanny X-Men'' #193 as part of [[Emma Frost]]'s Hellions team. Firestar was given an origin story in a [[Firestar (limited series)|self-titled mini-series]] (March – June 1986). The character went on to be a founding member of the [[New Warriors]], and later a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

One change to Firestar from the TV show to the comic books was her powers.  In the cartoon, they were fire based.  However, Marvel had a number of characters who could control/create fire, so they changed her mutant ability to the power to emit and control microwave energy.

=== ''Amazing Friends'' 2006 ===
To commemorate the 25th anniversary of the show, Marvel released ''Spider-Man Family: Amazing Friends'' #1 on August 9, 2006. The comic starts with an all-new story, &quot;Opposites Attack&quot;, which is officially set before ''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'' #75. After that is a Mini Marvel tale, &quot;Spider-Man And His Amazing &lt;del&gt;Friends&lt;/del&gt; Co-Workers&quot; (note that the [[strikethrough]] of &quot;Friends&quot; was a deliberate inclusion in the title). Both stories were written by [[Sean McKeever]].

The remainder of the one-shot is composed of reprints of ''[[Untold Tales of Spider-Man]]'' #2 and ''[[Spider-Man 2099]]'' #2.

=== ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' ===
An arc in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' is titled &quot;Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends&quot; and issue #118's cover, showing Spider-Man, Iceman and Firestar, is a homage to the series title screen. [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]] and [[Shadowcat (comics)|Kitty Pryde]] are also said to be members of the team. However, instead of Angelica Jones, Firestar is [[Liz Allan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/marveldatabase/images/thumb/b/b7/Ultimate_Spider-Man_Vol_1_118.jpg/300px-Ultimate_Spider-Man_Vol_1_118.jpg ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #118 cover]&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, in ''[[Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man]]'', Spidey, Iceman, and the Human Torch have begun living together at Aunt May's house and have been working as a team as another homage to the series (because Liz, as Firestar, was a member of the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men in this continuity]]; this team roster also reflects the original intent of ''Amazing Friends'' to use the Human Torch before licensing issues forced the creation of Firestar).

=== ''Amazing Friends'' in-continuity? ===
In 2007's ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe—Spider-Man: Back in Black'' one-shot, the villain Videoman is given a brief biography from his &quot;retcon&quot; appearance in the ''Spider-Man Family'' one-shot. There is also an annotation describing an &quot;Earth 8107&quot;, where an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] Videoman was created by Electro to battle that world's Spider-Man. Later, in the same reality, Francis Byte is mutated by an exploding arcade console to become a new Videoman, and later &quot;possibly&quot; join the X-Men. Essentially, this places the events of ''Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends'' — or at the very least, the episodes &quot;Videoman&quot; and &quot;The Education of a Superhero&quot; — in an alternate-Earth continuity of the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Marvel Comics Multiverse]].

=== Spider-Verse ===
The Spider-Friends of Earth-1983 (described as a &quot;kinder, gentler than most&quot; world), except for Ms. Lion, are apparently killed by a dimension-hopping [[Morlun]], set on draining the life out of every variation of Spider-Man across the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 3 #7&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Iceman'' 2018 ===
At the &quot;Street Cart Named Desire Festival&quot;, Peter sees Angelica but doesn't seem to recognize her when explaining to Mary Jane that she's the only redhead that he's interested in. Bobby and Angelica briefly catch up before returning to their dates which are then interrupted by an ice monster attack. Iceman, Firestar, and Spider-Man suit up and defeat the attacker together. The team-up is called &quot;Iceman and His amazing Friends&quot; both on the issue's cover and by Iceman in the story. Afterward, the trio chat and Angelica and Bobby commiserate about men on dating apps.&lt;ref&gt;''Iceman'' Vol. 4 #3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Series notes ==
* The series was an attempt by NBC to replicate some of the success ABC enjoyed with the [[Super Friends]] franchise.&lt;ref name=seriously&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.animationmagazine.net/top-stories/rick-hobergs-seriously-amazing-friends/ | title= Rick Hoberg's Seriously 'Amazing Friends'| website= AnimationMagazine.net| first= Michael |last= Mallory |date= October 4, 2012| accessdate= March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The makers of the show had originally intended the stars to be Spider-Man, Iceman, and the [[Human Torch]].&lt;ref name=seriously /&gt; However, legal issues about the rights to the Human Torch character (which had also plagued Marvel once before for the [[Fantastic Four (1978 TV series)|1978 ''Fantastic Four'' cartoon]]) led to the Human Torch being replaced by a new character, Firestar, who had similar powers, but was a mutant like Iceman. Due to Firestar's popularity with fans, she has since become a part of the mainstream Marvel Universe (see '''Comics''' above). In pre-production, Firestar's codename changed frequently; the unused names include Firefly, Starblaze, and Heatwave.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}
* Ms. Lion was actually Firestar's puppy, as Angelica introduced Peter to the dog before she and Bobby knew Peter's secret identity or vice versa (as former teammates in the X-Men, Iceman and Firestar knew each other's secret identities before meeting Peter/Spider-Man). However, Aunt May ended up taking care of her most of the time, with Angelica leading the busy life of a superhero and college student. Strangely enough, Ms. Lion actually saved the day in the episode &quot;Seven Little Superheroes&quot;, in which The Chameleon was the main enemy; with her canine sense of smell, Ms. Lion was able to distinguish the shape-changing villain from the heroes he was impersonating. This episode was also notable for including Marvel heroes [[Doctor Strange]], [[Namor]], [[Shanna the She-Devil]] and [[Captain America]].
* Some of the sound effects used in the series originated from Universal Television's ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' and ''[[Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (TV series)|Buck Rogers in the 25th Century]]''. Adding Ms. Lion, a pet, as a character was another attempt to emulate the ''Super Friends''&lt;ref name=seriously /&gt; ([[Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog|Wonder Dog]], [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]]).
* In her civilian identity, Angelica Jones resembles Peter's girlfriend from the comic books, [[Mary Jane Watson]].  This was played up in issues of ''[[Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane]]'' in which Firestar appeared.
* In the 1984 film ''[[Missing in Action (film)|Missing in Action]]'' starring [[Chuck Norris]], an episode of ''Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends'' can be seen on a television. The title of that episode is called &quot;Along Came Spidey&quot;.
* In 2020, [[Disney +]] placed a warning on the 3rd episode (entitled &quot;Sunfire&quot;) for a racially insensitive portrayal of &quot;[[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]]&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.cbr.com/spider-man-his-amazing-friends-sunfire-content-warning/ | title= A Problematic Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends Episode Carries a Warning on Disney+ | website=cbr.com |first=Nick | last=Pearl| date= Nov 22, 2020 | accessdate= Nov 27, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode, Sunfire is portrayed as speaking [[English language|English]] with a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] accent.

'''Firestar''' ('''Angelica''' &quot;'''Angel'''&quot; '''Jones''') is a [[fictional]] [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Debuting in 1981 on the [[NBC]] animated television series, ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' (as Fire-Star), she has the ability to generate and manipulate [[microwave]] radiation, allowing her to fly and create intense heat and flames. In the comics, she has acted as a solo hero and as a member of the [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]], the [[New Warriors]], the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and the [[X-Men]].

==Development and publication history==

===''Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends''===
[[File:Firestar.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Fire-Star as she originally appeared in ''Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends''.]]
Firestar - spelled as Fire-Star - was originally created for the [[NBC]] [[List of animated television series|animated series]] ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Spider-Man on TV | work=[[IGN]] | url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/785/785521p3.html | accessdate=2010-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Kathy Garver]] providing her voice.

The creators had originally wanted to use the [[Human Torch]], but the rights to the character were tied up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | quote = The network originally wanted the series to feature the Fantastic Four's Human Torch, but he was off-limits due to licensing conflicts.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fire-Star's pre-production names included Heatwave, Starblaze, and Firefly. [[Dennis Marks (screenwriter)|Dennis Marks]], one of the original writers of ''Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends'', stated in a 2002 interview that he had come up with the name of Fire-Star's alias, Angelica Jones, taken from one of his old girlfriends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.spider-friends.com/Credits/writers/InterviewDM.html | title=An Interview with Dennis Marks | work=spider-friends.com | date=June 2002 | accessdate=June 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the series, Fire-Star is identified as a former member of the [[X-Men]]&lt;!--source: series explanation by her character several times when the X-Men appear--&gt;, along with [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] with whom she occasionally appears to have a playful flirtation and sometimes dates. At times, she dates Peter Parker ([[Spider-Man]]) as well, resulting in a relaxed [[love triangle]] of sorts (though Iceman states that &quot;fire and ice don't really mix&quot;&lt;ref&gt;'' Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends''. Season 1, Episode 8: &quot;The Prison Plot&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; despite having feelings for each other). Fire-Star also has a one-episode romance with [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]].

Her origin is explained in &quot;A Fire-Star is Born&quot;: Young Angelica Jones was subject to constant bullying by another girl named Bonnie who called her &quot;Miss Angelica Jinx&quot; due mainly to events mysteriously happening (triggered by her powers) whenever Angelica was around. It was during this time that she became aware of her powers, once saving her father from an accident while disguised.

Early in her senior year of high school, Bonnie and her boyfriend framed Angelica for the theft of a trophy, causing Dean Wilmer to temporarily suspend Angelica from school. A strong need to correct this situation led Angelica to become Fire-Star for the first time. She found proof of Bonnie's deception, retrieved the missing trophy, and compelled Bonnie to confess, which justified their expulsion from school. She was later approached by [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], and Iceman to join the X-Men. She accepted and was seen helping them against [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] and the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]].

The animated series and the [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends'' comic book&lt;ref&gt;Later reprinted as ''Marvel Action Universe'' #1.&lt;/ref&gt; (which adapted an episode for print) are not considered part of standard [[Marvel Universe]] [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]]. However, the 2006 one-shot comic ''Spider-Man Family: Amazing Friends'' (August 2006) features an in-continuity story, &quot;[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends#Opposites Attack!|Opposites Attack!]]&quot;, in which the three superheroes work as a short-lived team. This story takes place shortly after the up-and-coming hero Firestar becomes a founding member of the [[New Warriors]].

===Firestar mini-series===
{{Main|Firestar (limited series)}}
Firestar's first in-continuity comic book appearance was in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #193.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; She next appeared in her own mini-series, which presented her definitive, in-continuity origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Firestar'' four issue mini-series depicts events both before and after Firestar's appearance in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #193, showing her development from a shy, insecure girl afraid of her developing powers to a confident young woman capable of easily defeating [[Emma Frost]].

The mini-series also established that Firestar's powers were microwave-based, rather than the more common fire-generation power that her animated counterpart displayed; the comic-book Firestar essentially harnesses ambient microwave radiation from her environment, making her powers far stronger in an environment such as space, where the concentration of microwaves is much greater than within a planetary atmosphere.

===Established character===
Despite the mini-series' efforts to flesh out the character, Firestar was not featured in any stories for a few years and seemed destined to fade into obscurity until she joined the New Warriors. She would go on to appear as a regular character in ''Avengers'', and the informal all-female team &quot;Marvel Divas&quot;.

After the special ''Firestar'' one-shot issue (April 2010), Firestar returned to full-time superheroics as a character in the short-lived comic series ''Young Allies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=14718 | title=''Firestar'' #1 (2010) | work=Marvel Catalog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/Young-Allies-McKeever-100309.html | last=Rogers | first=Vaneta | title=''Young Allies'' Joins Marvel's Summer Youth Movement | work=[[Newsarama]] | date=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firestar appears as a main character in the ''I Am an Avenger'' comic book mini-series.

Firestar was one of the feature characters in the 2011 six-issue limited series ''Fear Itself: Youth in Revolt''.

At the 2013 San Diego Comic Con, Firestar was announced &quot;to take her place as a major X-Men character for the first time&quot; starring in the new comic book ''Amazing X-Men'' in November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/07/21/amazing-x-men-1-from-jason-aaron-and-ed-mcguinness-features-wolverine-storm-beast-firestar-iceman-northstar-and-nightcrawler/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing X-Men&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsarama.com/18459-the-amazing-x-men-search-for-nightcrawler-in-new-series.html |title= The AMAZING X-MEN Search for Nightcrawler in New Series|date=22 July 2013 |publisher=[[Newsarama.com]] |accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==

===Hellions===
A lonely girl raised by her single father Bartholomew and paternal grandmother, Angelica Jones discovered that she possessed [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] powers. After her grandmother's death by heart failure and her revelation that she was a mutant, her father sent Angelica to the [[Massachusetts Academy (comics)|Massachusetts Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Firestar'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]'s original White Queen [[Emma Frost]] began training Angelica in the use of her powers for the Hellfire Club's [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|team of young mutants]]. She was never sent on field missions with the other Hellions, however, because of her lack of control over her lethal powers and because the White Queen wished to instill cruelty and callousness in Firestar's personality, and befriending other young mutants would work against that goal. The White Queen manipulated Angelica into perceiving Frost as a loving mother figure, unaware that Frost was secretly grooming her to be a potential assassin and bodyguard. Angelica did meet the [[New Mutants]] at an Academy dance and, with the White Queen's telepathic prompting, formed a crush on [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]].&lt;ref&gt;''Firestar'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

Firestar was later emotionally manipulated by [[Empath (comics)|Empath]], and accompanied the [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]] [[Warpath (comics)|Thunderbird]], Empath and [[Roulette (Marvel Comics)|Roulette]] on a mission against the [[X-Men]], in which Thunderbird sought revenge on Xavier, thinking him responsible for his [[John Proudstar|brother]]'s death. Angelica felt terrible guilt over the incident once she was free of Empath's power, however. Professor Xavier offered her a place at the Xavier School, but although she declined out of loyalty to the White Queen, she was touched and pleased by the offer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uncanny X-Men 193&quot;&gt;''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #193&lt;/ref&gt;

While a student of the Massachusetts Academy, Angelica had Hellfire mercenary Randall Chase assigned to her as a bodyguard. Growing close to Angelica, Randall eventually began to suspect the White Queen's true motives and was to be terminated. He escaped, mortally wounded, and managed to warn Angelica of Frost's duplicity just before he died. In retaliation, Jones attacked and defeated the White Queen, and decimated the hidden training complex beneath Frost's Massachusetts Academy. Afterwards, she returned to living with her father (as she was still a minor at the time) but kept the unique costume and identity of Firestar given to her by Frost.&lt;ref name=&quot;Firestar #4&quot;&gt;''Firestar'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

Firestar was later to become one of the few surviving original Hellions after most members were murdered by [[Trevor Fitzroy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #281&lt;/ref&gt; She, Warpath and Empath were the only members of the team not present during the massacre. Firestar and Warpath (accompanied by Warpath's X-Force teammate and Firestar's former love interest Cannonball), travelled to [[Nova Roma (comics)|Nova Roma]] in [[Brazil]] to inform Empath and former New Mutant [[Magma (comics)|Magma]] of their teammates' deaths. The trio then went to the Massachusetts Academy where they removed the few remaining files on record of the Hellions' existence.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Warriors #31&quot;&gt;''New Warriors'' #31&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Warriors===
Shortly after her resignation from the Massachusetts Academy, Firestar became a founding member of the [[New Warriors]] when she was invited (or rather blackmailed) by [[Night Thrasher]] into joining, and helped them battle [[Terrax]].&lt;ref&gt;''New Warriors'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; She also aided Night Thrasher against [[Midnight's Fire]].&lt;ref&gt;''New Warriors'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; She also helped [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] defeat the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] alongside the New Warriors.&lt;ref&gt;''Thor'' #411-412&lt;/ref&gt; The team battled the [[Mad Thinker]] and [[Primus (Marvel Comics)#Primus I|Primus]],&lt;ref&gt;''New Warriors'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; and then battled [[Psionex]].&lt;ref&gt;''New Warriors'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

The team battled the second [[Star Thief]] and [[Iron Monger|Stane International]]'s [[Mandroid]]s. With teammates [[Vance Astrovik|Marvel Boy]] and [[Namorita]], and the Star Thief, she launched into space aboard a Stane rocket.&lt;ref&gt;''New Warriors'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; They encountered the [[Inhumans]] and the [[Uatu|Watcher]] on the Moon. With the help of [[Black Bolt]] and the Star Thief, she destroyed the Stane rocket containing hazardous waste.&lt;ref&gt;''New Warriors'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

Back on Earth, the New Warriors battled the [[Force of Nature (comics)|Force of Nature]] in a Brazilian jungle, and rescued teammate [[Robbie Baldwin|Speedball]]'s mother.&lt;ref&gt;''New Warriors'' #7-9&lt;/ref&gt; The New Warriors also battled the [[Emma Frost|White Queen]] and her Hellions.&lt;ref&gt;''New Warriors'' #10&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, she fell in love and became engaged to teammate Vance Astrovik (also known as [[Vance Astrovik|Justice]], formerly [[Marvel Boy#Others|Marvel Boy]]).{{Issue|date=April 2009}} She later discovered that using her microwave powers could eventually render her [[infertility|infertile]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

During a revenge scheme by a gang of thugs called the Poison Memories, Firestar's father was shot in the chest.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} He nearly died but recovered.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Firestar also faced a time without Vance, as he had to serve a prison term for the involuntary slaying of his own abusive father.&lt;ref&gt;''New Warriors'' #20-26&lt;/ref&gt;

Firestar also provided vital assistance in helping Spider-Man tackle [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] during &quot;[[Maximum Carnage]]&quot;, when he was also forced to ally himself with [[Eddie Brock|Venom]], [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] and [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]] to stop Carnage's reign of slaughter. Her microwave power proved the only weapon truly effective against Carnage following his 'upgrade' - his vulnerability to sonics having been weakened - but she still refused to kill Carnage, even to stop his murders.&lt;ref&gt;''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #202&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, she was briefly attracted to Spider-Man's clone, [[Ben Reilly]], when he joined the New Warriors under the identity of the Scarlet Spider,{{issue|date=March 2015}} but their relationship never went beyond an interest due to Firestar's engagement to Justice and Reilly's secrecy causing him to avoid revealing his identity.{{issue|date=March 2015}}

Firestar and Justice eventually left the New Warriors together.{{Issue|date=August 2010}} Some time later the two joined the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] after an alternate-universe adventure and a struggle against [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' vol. 3, #1-3&lt;/ref&gt; Firestar helped demonstrate her fitness for the position when she and Vance took down [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]], a villain that had foiled most of the other Avengers at once.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' vol. 3, #4&lt;/ref&gt;

Firestar demonstrated a more restrained fashion sense, refusing to wear a cleavage-baring costume designed by the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]. Though she is seen wearing exactly that costume in an Avengers promo poster and in some early Avengers appearances, she quickly altered the costume to be more modest, which was consistent with her personality.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' vol. 3, #5-6&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, [[Henry Pym]] determined that the cause of her potential infertility was her natural immunity to the effects of her own powers (which all mutants possess) had never fully developed. He designed a costume for her that would siphon off the excess radiation, give her natural immunity the opportunity to manifest fully and heal the damage already done.&lt;ref name=&quot;Avengers vol. 3 #12&quot;&gt;''Avengers'' vol. 3, #12&lt;/ref&gt; After a distinguished tenure with the Avengers, including going undercover in a bizarre cult,{{Issue|date=April 2009}} facing a horde of [[Ultron]] robots,&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' vol. 3, #19-23&lt;/ref&gt; and struggling against [[Kang the Conqueror]]'s takeover of modern-day Earth,{{Issue|date=April 2009}} she and Justice left the Avengers{{Issue|date=April 2009}}. She also made a tentative peace with Emma Frost during this time.&lt;ref&gt;''Generation X'' #59&lt;/ref&gt;

Angelica started college and enjoyed a &quot;normal life&quot;, but she abandoned wedding preparations, leaving Vance with all of the responsibility. When Vance confronted her about this, she confessed that she needed more life experience before settling into married life. Vance left in anger and presumably ended their engagement.&lt;ref&gt;''I &quot;Heart&quot; Marvel: Masked Intentions'' (one-shot)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement===
Firestar is one of the few mutants left on the planet with her powers intact, after the [[Scarlet Witch]] altered reality and [[Decimation (comics)|decimated]] the mutant population.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Firestar was not among the New Warriors who died in the catastrophe that sparked the events of ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]''. She was presumed to be among the Warriors who confronted the operator of an anti-Warriors hate site created in the wake of the catastrophe, revealed to be former Warriors member Carlton LaFroyge ([[Hindsight (comics)|Hindsight Lad]]).&lt;ref&gt;''[[She-Hulk]]'' vol. 2, #8 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; She is seen flying in the background, above the confrontation.

Firestar has responded to the [[Registration Acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]] by effectively retiring from her career as a costumed hero.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Civil War: Front Line]]'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; She was seen as part of a New Warriors reunion of sorts with Nova and Justice, with whom she seems to be on good terms again. She also began attending college.&lt;ref&gt;''Nova'' vol. 4, #20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marvel Divas===
In the limited series, ''[[Marvel Divas]]'' (which was originally pitched as &quot;''Sex and the City'' in the Marvel Universe&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;marveldivas&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendId=92159514&amp;blogId=482150960 |title=MyCup o' Joe Tea, Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning |date=April 9, 2009 |work=MySpace Comic Books |accessdate=2009-04-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413195242/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendId=92159514&amp;blogId=482150960 |archive-date=2009-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is revealed Angelica's closest friends are [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]] and [[Monica Rambeau|Photon]]. At the very end of the first issue, Firestar announces she has been diagnosed with cancer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marvel Divas #1&quot;&gt;''Marvel Divas'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; She's later diagnosed by [[Doctor Strange]] and the [[Night Nurse (comics)|Night Nurse]] as being in the earlier stages of the illness, provoked seemingly by the same inability to shield herself from her microwave emission powers that's making her infertile.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Divas'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her bravery in dealing with the illness (she asks Patsy to write a book and a blog to relay her experience to other cancer survivors, strongly believing in her ability to heal), and [[Henry Pym]] offering her a second opinion (despite Pym actually being a [[biochemist]], and not a [[physician]]), she is still in visible distress; enough for [[Daimon Hellstrom]] to approach his ex-wife Patsy, ensuring her fast healing in exchange for Patsy remarrying him (and giving him her soul in the process).&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Divas'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; Learning about Patsy's brave move to help in her recovery, Angelica and her supportive friends travelled to Hellstrom's dimension to rescue her, thereby rejecting his 'healing' help for Hellcat's freedom and taking her chances against the cancer. After returning to Earth, Angelica had a follow-up exam that revealed her cancer to be in complete remission. During this series, she is a New York University graduate student in art history, specializing in Medieval European art. Due to her chemotherapy, Angelica began to lose her hair. Initially opting for a wig, she decided to cut her hair short instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marvel Divas #4&quot;&gt;''Marvel Divas'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

===One-shot and Young Allies===
Firestar continues her education while engaging in super heroics part-time. In her one-shot issue, she is wearing a long-haired red wig as her natural hair has not grown back yet.{{Issue|date=March 2011}}

'''Trout''' is  the common name for a number of [[species]] of [[freshwater]] [[fish]] belonging to the genera ''[[Oncorhynchus]]'', ''[[Salmo]]'' and ''[[Salvelinus]]'', all of the  [[subfamily (biology)|subfamily]] [[Salmoninae]] of the family [[Salmonidae]].  The word ''trout'' is also used as part of the name of some non-salmonid fish such as ''Cynoscion nebulosus'', the [[spotted seatrout]] or speckled trout.

Trout are closely related to [[salmon]] and [[Salvelinus|char (or charr)]]: species termed salmon and char occur in the same genera as do fish called trout (''Oncorhynchus'' – Pacific salmon and trout,  ''Salmo'' – Atlantic salmon and various trout, ''Salvelinus'' – char and trout).

[[Lake trout]] and most other trout live in freshwater lakes and rivers exclusively, while there are others, such as the [[Steelhead trout|steelhead]], a form of the coastal [[rainbow trout]], that can spend two or three years at sea before returning to fresh water to [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] (a habit more typical of [[salmon]]). Arctic char and brook trout are part of the char family. Trout are an important food source for humans and wildlife, including [[brown bear]]s, [[birds of prey]] such as [[eagle]]s, and other animals. They are classified as [[oily fish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/faq/oilyfishfaq/oilyfishqa02|title=What are oily fish?|date=June 23, 2004|publisher=[[Food Standards Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anatomy==
Trout that live in different environments can have dramatically different colorations and patterns. Mostly, these colors and patterns form as [[camouflage]], based on the surroundings, and will change as the fish moves to different habitats. Trout in, or newly returned from the sea, can look very silvery, while the same fish living in a small stream or in an alpine lake could have pronounced markings and more vivid coloration; it is also possible that in some species, this signifies that they are ready to mate. In general, trout that are about to breed have extremely intense coloration and can look like an entirely different fish outside of spawning season. It is virtually impossible to define a particular color pattern as belonging to a specific breed; however, in general, wild fish are claimed to have more vivid colors and patterns.

Trout have fins entirely without spines, and all of them have a small [[adipose]] fin along the back, near the tail. The pelvic fins sit well back on the body, on each side of the anus. The [[swim bladder]] is connected to the [[esophagus]], allowing for gulping or rapid expulsion of air, a condition known as [[physostome]]. Unlike many other physostome fish, trout do not use their bladder as an auxiliary device for [[oxygen]] uptake, relying solely on their [[gills]].

There are many species, and even more populations, that are isolated from each other and morphologically different. However, since many of these distinct populations show no significant genetic differences, what may appear to be a large number of species is considered a much smaller number of distinct species by most [[Ichthyology|ichthyologists]]. The trout found in the eastern [[United States]] are a good example of this. The [[brook trout]], the [[aurora trout]], and the (extinct) [[silver trout]] all have physical characteristics and colorations that distinguish them, yet [[gene]]tic analysis shows that they are one species, ''Salvelinus fontinalis''.

[[Lake trout]] (''Salvelinus namaycush''), like brook trout, belong to the char genus. Lake trout inhabit many of the larger lakes in North America, and live much longer than [[rainbow trout]], which have an average maximum lifespan of 7 years. Lake trout can live many decades, and can grow to more than {{convert|30|kg}}.

==Habitat==
[[File:Forel farm Sochi.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|A trout farm in [[Sochi]], [[Russia]]]]
Trout are usually found in cool ({{convert|50|-|60|F|C|disp=or}}), clear streams and lakes, although many of the species have [[Fish migration|anadromous]] strains as well. Young trout are referred to as troutlet, troutling or fry. They are distributed naturally throughout [[North America]], northern [[Asia]] and [[Europe]]. Several species of trout were introduced to [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] by amateur fishing enthusiasts in the 19th century, effectively displacing and endangering several [[Upland and lowland (freshwater ecology)|upland]] native fish species. The introduced species included [[brown trout]] from England and [[rainbow trout]] from [[California]]. The rainbow trout were a steelhead strain, generally accepted as coming from [[Sonoma Creek]]. The rainbow trout of New Zealand still show the steelhead tendency to run up rivers in winter to spawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/S0165-7836(98)00215-X|title = Spawning of anadromous rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum): A threat to sea trout, Salmo trutta L., populations?|journal = Fisheries Research|volume = 40|pages = 55–63|year = 1999|last1 = Landergren|first1 = Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia the rainbow trout was introduced in 1894 from New Zealand and is an extremely popular gamefish in recreational angling.&lt;ref name=&quot;fishes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gomon|first1=Martin|last2=Bray|first2=Dianne|title=Rainbow Trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss|url=http://www.fishesofaustralia.net.au/home/species/2083|website=Fishes of Australia|access-date=August 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite severely impacting the distribution and abundance of native Australian fish, such as the [[climbing galaxias]], millions of rainbow and other trout species are released annually from government and private hatcheries.&lt;ref name=&quot;fishes&quot; /&gt;

The closest resemblance of seema trout and other trout family can be found in the [[Himalayas|Himalayan Region]] of India, Nepal, Bhutan, Pakistan and in [[Tian Shan]] mountains of [[Kyrgyzstan]].{{clarify|date=November 2019}}

==Diet==
[[File:Truite doree.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Golden trout]], ''Oncorhynchus aguabonita'']]
Trout generally feed on other fish, and soft bodied aquatic [[invertebrate]]s, such as [[Diptera|flies]], [[mayfly|mayflies]], [[Trichoptera|caddisflies]], [[Plecoptera|stoneflies]], [[mollusk]]s and [[Odonata|dragonflies]]. In lakes, various species of [[Plankton|zooplankton]] often form a large part of the diet. In general, trout longer than about {{convert|300|mm}} prey almost exclusively on fish, where they are available. Adult trout will devour smaller fish up to 1/3 their length. Trout  may feed on [[shrimp]], [[mealworm]]s, [[Chironomidae|bloodworms]], [[insect]]s, small animal parts, and [[eel]].

Trout who swim the streams love to feed on land animals, aquatic life, and flies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.streamexplorers.org/fish-facts/trout-food|title=Trout Food {{!}} Stream Explorers|website=www.streamexplorers.org|access-date=2020-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of their diet comes from macroinvertebrates, or animals that do not have a backbone like snails, worms’ insects, etc. they also eat flies, most people who try to use lures to fish trout mimic flies because they are one of trout’s most fed on meals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.streamexplorers.org/fish-facts/trout-food|title=Trout Food {{!}} Stream Explorers|website=www.streamexplorers.org|access-date=2020-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trout also love some land animals who make their way into the water. Insects like grasshoppers are a meal trout love; they also eat small animals like mice that fall in. Only very big trout have mouths capable of eating mice. They have their diet of aquatic life like minnows or crawfish. Trout have a diverse diet they follow; they have plenty of different oppositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.streamexplorers.org/fish-facts/trout-food|title=Trout Food {{!}} Stream Explorers|website=www.streamexplorers.org|access-date=2020-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As food==
[[File:Baked trout.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Baked trout]]
As a group, trout are somewhat bony, but the flesh is generally considered to be tasty.  The flavor of the flesh is heavily influenced by the diet of the fish. For example, trout that have been feeding on crustaceans tend to be more flavorful than those feeding primarily on insect life.  Additionally, they provide a good fight when caught with a [[Fish hook|hook]] and [[Fishing line|line]], and are sought after [[Sport fishing|recreationally]].  Because of their popularity, trout are often raised on [[fish farm]]s and planted into heavily fished waters, in an effort to mask the effects of [[overfishing]]. Farmed trout and [[Arctic char|char]] are also sold commercially as [[Seafood|food fish]]. Trout is sometimes prepared by [[Smoking (cooking)|smoking]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HKPF_S849O0C&amp;pg=PA27 Trout - S. G. B. Tennant, Jr., Arie De Zanger&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[British Nutrition Foundation]], trout contain one of the lowest amounts of [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]] (a type of environmental contaminant) of all oily fishes.

==Trout fishing==
===River fishing===
While trout can be caught with a normal rod and [[Fishing reel|reel]], [[fly fishing]] is a distinctive method developed primarily for trout, and now extended to other species. Understanding how moving water shapes the stream channel makes it easier to find trout. In most streams, the current creates a riffle-run-pool pattern that repeats itself over and over. A deep pool may hold a big [[brown trout]], but rainbows and smaller browns are likely found in runs. [[Riffle]]s are where fishers will find small trout, called troutlet, during the day and larger trout crowding in during morning and evening feeding periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cotrout.org/|title=Cotrout - The Outdoor Resources|website=Cotrout|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Riffles have a fast current and shallow water. This gives way to a bottom of gravel, rubble or boulder. Riffles are morning and evening feeding areas. Trout usually spawn just above or below riffles, but may spawn right in them.
* Runs are deeper than riffles with a moderate current and are found between riffles and pools. The bottom is made up of small gravel or rubble. These hot spots hold trout almost anytime, if there is sufficient cover.
* Pools are smoother and look darker than the other areas of the stream. The deep, slow-moving water generally has a bottom of silt, sand, or small gravel. Pools make good midday resting spots for medium to large trout.&lt;ref&gt;Troutlet.com: [http://www.troutlet.com/How-to-Read-a-River-when-Trout-Fishing-W26C54.aspx How to Read a River when Trout Fishing]&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is recommended that when fishing for trout, that the fisher(s) should use line in the 4–8&amp;nbsp;lb test for streamfish, and stronger line with the same diameter for trout from the sea or from a large lake, such as Lake Michigan. It is also recommended to use a hook size 8-5 for trout of all kind. Trout, especially farm-raised ones, tend to like [[salmon roe]]s, [[worm]]s, [[minnow]]s, cut bait, [[maize]], or [[marshmallow]]s.

===Ice fishing===
Fishing for trout under the ice generally occurs in depths of 4 to 8 feet. Because trout are cold water fish, during the winter they move from up-deep to the shallows, replacing the small fish that inhabit the area during the summer. Trout in winter constantly cruise in shallow depths looking for food, usually traveling in groups, although bigger fish may travel alone and in water that's somewhat deeper, around 12 feet. Rainbow, Brown, and Brook trout are the most common trout species caught through the ice.&lt;ref&gt;Straw, Matt (December 5, 2012) [http://www.in-fisherman.com/trout-salmon/trout/ice-fishing-trout/ &quot;Ice Fishing Trout&quot;] ''In-Fisherman''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Declines in native trout populations ==
Salmonid populations in general have been declining due to numerous factors. Non-native, [[invasive species]], hybridization, wildfires, and climate change are just a few examples. Native salmonid fish in the western and southwestern United States are threatened by non-native species that were introduced decades ago. Non-native salmonids were introduced to enrich recreational fishing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quist|first=Michael|date=2004|title=Bioinvasive species and the preservation of cutthroat trout in the western United States: ecological, social, and economic issues|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Policy|volume=7|issue=4|pages=303–313|doi=10.1016/j.envsci.2004.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;, however, they quickly started outcompeting and displacing native salmonids upon their arrival. Non-native, invasive species are quick to adapt to their new environment and learn to outcompete any native species, making them a force the native salmon and trout have to reckon with. Not only do the non-native fish drive the native fish to occupy new niches, but they also try to hybridize with them, contaminating the native gene construction. As more hybrids between native and non-native fish are formed, the lineage of the pure fish is continuously being contaminated by other species and soon may no longer represent the sole native species. The Rio Grande Cutthroat trout ([[Rio Grande cutthroat trout|Oncorhynchus clarki virginalis]]) are susceptible to hybridization with other salmonids such as rainbow trout ([[Rainbow trout|Oncorhynchus mykiss]]) and yield a new “cut-bow” trout, which is a contamination of both lineages’ genes. One solution to this issue is implemented by New Mexico Game and Fish hatcheries: stock only sterile fish in river streams. Hatcheries serve as a reservoir of fish for recreational activities but growing and stocking non-sterile fish would worsen the hybridization issue on a quicker, more magnified time scale. By stocking sterile fish, the native salmonids can’t share genes with the non-native hatchery fish, thus, preventing further gene contamination of the native trout in New Mexico. Fire is also a factor in deteriorating Gila trout ([[Oncorhynchus gilae gilae|Oncorhynchus gilae]]) populations because of the ash and soot that can enter streams following fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wildlife.state.nm.us/fishing/native-new-mexico-fish/gila-trout-recovery-angling/|title=Gila Trout Recovery and Angling|website=New Mexico Department of Game and Fish|access-date=Dec 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ash lowers water quality, making it more difficult for the Gila trout to survive. In some New Mexico streams, the native Gila trout will be evacuated from streams that are threatened by nearby fires and be reintroduced after the threat is resolved. Again, climate change is also dwindling native salmonid populations. [[Climate change]] continually affects various cold-water fish, including trout. With an increase of temperature along with changes in spawning river flow, an abundance of trout species are effected negatively. In the past, a mere 8° F increase was predicted to eliminate half of the native brook trout in the Southern Appalachian Mountains&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Climate Change and Cold Water Fish|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Trout prefer cold water (50-60° F) streams to spawn and live, but warming water temperatures are altering this ecosystem and further deteriorative native populations. See also {{portal|Food}}

[[File:Trolling for bluefish2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|&quot;Trolling for blue fish&quot; [[lithograph]] by [[Currier &amp; Ives]], 1866.]] '''Trolling''' is a method of [[fishing]] where one or more [[fishing line]]s, baited with [[fishing lure|lures]] or [[bait fish]], are drawn through the water. This may be behind a moving boat, or by slowly winding the line in when fishing from a static position, or even sweeping the line from side-to-side, e.g. when fishing from a [[jetty]]. Trolling is used to catch [[pelagic fish]] such as salmon, [[mackerel]] and [[King mackerel|kingfish]].

Trolling can be phonetically confused with [[trawling]], a different method of fishing where a [[Fishing net|net]] (trawl) is drawn through the water instead of lines. Trolling is used both for [[recreational fishing|recreational]] and [[commercial fishing]] whereas trawling is used mainly for commercial fishing.

Trolling from a moving boat involves moving quite slowly through the water. This can be accomplished with the use of a special [[trolling motor]]. Multiple lines are often used, and [[outrigger]]s can be used to spread the lines more widely and reduce their chances of tangling. [[Downrigger]]s can also be used to keep the lures or baits trailing at a desired depth.

==Line-spreading trolling devices==
===Outriggers===
[[Outrigger]]s are poles which allow a boat to troll several lines in the water without tangling. A boat which trolls enough lines can simulate a [[Shoaling and schooling|school of fish]].&lt;ref&gt;Ettingshausen A (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=OSmNuxANbV8C&amp;pg=PA143 ''Fishing for Beginners''] Page 143. Pan Macmillan Australia. {{ISBN|978-1-4050-3749-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slatter SO [http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6668745.html Outrigger assembly] United States Patent 6668745, issued 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis ER [http://www.google.co.nz/patents?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;vid=USPAT4858370&amp;id=rFE3AAAAEBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;dq=+school|schooling|shoal|shoaling+outrigger++troll|trolling++&amp;printsec=abstract#v=onepage&amp;q=school|schooling|shoal|shoaling%20outrigger%20%20troll|trolling&amp;f=false Fishing lure for simulated feeding] Patent number: 4858370, issued 22 August 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Downrigger===
[[File:Trolling drawing.jpg|thumb|200px|Artist's conception of tuna trolling operation, using outriggers to tow multiple trolling lines and give the appearance of [[Shoaling and schooling|schooling]] fish]]
[[Downrigger]] are devices used while trolling to keep a bait or lure at the desired depth. In practice, fish swim at different depths according to factors such as the temperature and amount of light in the water, and the speed and direction of water currents.&lt;ref name=Moritz&gt;Moritz AJL [http://www.google.co.nz/patents?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;vid=USPAT3897648&amp;id=_kc2AAAAEBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;dq=troll|trolling+fish|fishing&amp;printsec=abstract#v=onepage&amp;q=troll|trolling%20fish|fishing&amp;f=false Trolling line sinkers] Patent number: 2645053, Issued: July 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; A downrigger consists of a one or two metre horizontal pole which supports a weight, typically about three kilograms of lead, on a steel cable. A clip called a &quot;line release&quot; attaches the fishing line to the weight, and the bait or lure is attached to the release. The fishing line is reeled in by a spool powered either by manual cranking or by an electric motor.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz 2009, p. 219–220.&lt;/ref&gt; Using a downrigger can be hazardous. For example, man-made reservoirs can contain submerged trees and other structures beneath the surface which downriggers can snag.

===Paravanes===
[[Paravanasis (water kite)|Paravanes]] (underwater kites) are sometimes used as depth controlling devices,&lt;ref&gt;Larson W [http://www.google.co.nz/patents?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;vid=USPAT4486970&amp;id=82wzAAAAEBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;dq=troll|trolling+fish|fishing&amp;printsec=abstract#v=onepage&amp;q=troll|trolling%20fish|fishing&amp;f=false Trolling depth controller] Patent number 4486970, issued 11 December 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in commercial tuna fishing operations. These kites have various shapes, such as arrowhead paravanes, flexi-wing paravanes, and bi-wing paravanes.&lt;ref name=&quot;fishing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fishing.sh/htmfiles/seabirds/danielsolander.html |title=Tuna Fishing an Underwater Bait Setting Device |publisher=fishing.sh|accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The devices can place the lure or bait at designated depths and positions; and in this way multiple devices can be towed at the same time without the devices and bait interfering with each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=sYBHAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=2914884 |title=Patent US2914884 - Trolling device - Google Patents |accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spreaders===
&quot;Spreaders&quot; allow multiple baited hooks or lures to be trolled from a single line. There are many inventive spreader designs, such as devices which cause the baited hooks or lures to move in [[Helix|helical]] patterns, in a sophisticated emulation of the schooling behaviour of a group of fish.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett OL [http://www.google.co.nz/patents?lr&amp;vid=USPAT4920687&amp;dq=troll|trolling%20fish|fishing&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;id=GZQeAAAAEBAJ&amp;output=text&amp;pg=PA4 Rotating fishing lure spreader for use while trolling] Patent number 4920687, Issued 1 May 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planer boards===
[[Planer board]]s are trolled devices designed to spread fishing lures out away from the fishing vessel. They allow multiple lines to be trolled. They come in dual board and inline board designs. Dual board designs consist of two boards that are spaced apart and attached by a line to a mast near the front of the boat with a separate fishing line in a spring tension release clip that separates when the fishing line is set. Inline boards are attached directly to the fishing line and a spring tension clip that releases upon setting or tripping the planer board so it slides down the fishing line to a swivel tied several feet in front of the lure. Inlines are popular with [[walleye]] [[fishermen]]. Once tripped they offer much less resistance when reeling in a fish.&lt;ref name=&quot;walleyecentral&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walleyecentral.com/articles/?a=192|title=Tips For Using Inline Planer Boards by Julia (Juls) Davis|publisher=walleyecentral.com|accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;howstuffworks&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adventure.howstuffworks.com/outdoor-activities/fishing/freshwater-tips/walleye/walleye-fishing-techniques2.htm|title=Walleye Fishing with a Planer Board - HowStuffWorks|publisher=adventure.howstuffworks.com|accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;planerboard&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planerboard.com/how-to-use-a-planer-board-for-trolling/|title=How to Use a Planer Board for Trolling &amp;#124; Planer Board|publisher=planerboard.com|accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baits and lures==

To be effective, trolling [[Fishing bait|baits]] and [[Fishing lure|lures]] must have the visual ability to attract fish and intrigue them with the way they move through the water.&lt;ref&gt;LeBoeuf KP [http://www.google.co.nz/patents?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;vid=USPAT4215506&amp;id=xNQrAAAAEBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;dq=troll|trolling+fish|fishing&amp;printsec=abstract#v=onepage&amp;q=troll|trolling%20fish|fishing&amp;f=false Trolling lure and method of making same] Patent number: 4215506, issued 5 August 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Most trolling lures are designed to look and behave like dying, injured, or fast moving fish. They include:
* [[Surface lure]]s, also known as top water lures. They float and resemble prey that is on top of the water. They can make a popping sound from a concave-cut head, a burbling sound from &quot;side fins&quot; or scoops or a buzzing commotion from one or several propellers.
* [[Plugs (fishing)|Plugs]] are also known as crankbaits. These lures have a fishlike body shape and as they troll through the water they make various movements caused by instability due to a scoop under their heads.
* [[Swimbait]], a minnow-like soft plastic bait that is reeled like a plug. Some have swimming tails.
* [[Spoon lures]] resemble the inside of a table spoon. They flash in the light while randomly wobbling or darting due to their shape.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, Dick {2003} [https://books.google.com/books?id=4Bwc3bjwj7UC&amp;pg=PA264&amp;lpg=PA264&amp;dq=jigging&amp;source=web&amp;ots=5fQo3tYWW0&amp;sig=abkY3VycyrFHOEhlj_PbMDgIitk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=12&amp;ct=result ''The Ultimate Guide to Freshwater Fishing.''] Publishing Solutions, Page 264. {{ISBN|0-9725580-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Spinnerbait]], pieces of wire bent at about a 60 degree angle with a hook on the lower end and a flashy spinner mechanism on the upper end.

Trolling baits and lures are either tied with a knot, such as the [[improved clinch knot]], or connected with a tiny safety pin-like device called a &quot;snap&quot; onto the fishing line which is in turn connected to the reel. The reel is attached to a rod. The motion is of the lure is made by winding line back on to the [[reel]], by sweeping the fishing rod, jigging movements with the [[fishing rod]], or by trolling behind a moving boat. Lures can be contrasted with [[Artificial fly|artificial flies]], commonly called ''flies'' by [[Fly fishing|fly fishers]], which either float on the water surface, slowly sink or float underwater, in imitation some form of insect fish food. However some flies, such as the [[trolling tandem streamer fly]], are designed for trolling behind a moving boat.

As an example, [[marlin]] lures are typically 7-14 inches or more long with a shaped plastic or metal head and a plastic skirt. The design of the lure head, particularly its face, gives the lure its individual action when trolled through the water. Lure actions range from an active side-to-side swimming pattern to pushing water aggressively on the surface to, most commonly, tracking along in a straight line with a regular surface pop and bubble trail. Besides the shape, weight and size of the lure head, the length and thickness of skirting, the number and size of hooks and the length and size of the leader used in lure rigging all influence the action of the lure: how actively it will run and how it will respond to different sea conditions. Experienced anglers fine tune their lures to get the action they want.

Specialized lures made specifically for trolling [[swordfish]] use plastic [[glow sticks]].

A pattern of four or more lures can be trolled at varying distances behind the boat. Lures may be fished either straight from the rod tip (&quot;flat lines&quot;), or from outriggers.

In addition to attaching a lure to the fishing line, an oval piece of metal (often hammered or curved for reflective purposes) called a dodger is often used to attract fish from greater distances. Lures designed for trolling with downriggers include metal &quot;spoons&quot; that are often decorated with colour tape, and plastic or rubber &quot;squids&quot; with various colours.

A [[Daisy chain (fishing)|daisy chain]] is a chain of plastic lures which have no hooks. Their purpose is to function as teasers which attract a school of fish closer to the lures that do have hooks.&lt;ref name=&quot;alltackle&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alltackle.com/MCSquidDaisyChain.jpg|title=Image: MCSquidDaisyChain.jpg, (191 × 223 px)|publisher=alltackle.com|accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trolling speed==
[[Image:bassboat1.jpg|thumb|right|Aluminium [[bass boat]] with [[trolling motor]]&lt;ref&gt;Matthews CL et al [http://www.google.co.nz/patents?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;vid=USPAT4386918&amp;id=tG04AAAAEBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;dq=troll|trolling+fish|fishing&amp;printsec=abstract#v=onepage&amp;q=troll|trolling%20fish|fishing&amp;f=false Trolling motor steering device] Patent number 4386918, issued 7 June 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Baits and lures are typically trolled at speeds up to 9 [[knot (unit)|knots]], though speeds up to 15 knots can be used, particularly when boats are travelling to different fishing areas. The speed at which the lure is pulled through the water impacts on the fishing success. The optimum trolling speed varies with different species of fish, with weather conditions and the time of year, and other conditions. [[Chinook salmon]] can be successfully trolled at higher speeds than more docile [[lake trout]]. For these reasons fishermen use devices that accurately track speed.&lt;ref name=Moritz /&gt; [[Trolling motor]]s calibrate speed more accurately than large outboard motors. Trolling plates are also used with larger motors to slow the boat to the desired speed, although some anglers experience mixed results with plates.

Trolling can be effective at surprisingly low speeds. [[Kayak fishing|Kayaks]] fitted with a deck-mounted bracket for holding a rod can be paddled to troll effectively for salmon.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, L (1997) [https://books.google.com/books?id=he0A_psGKuoC&amp;pg=PA79 ''Kayak Cookery: A Handbook of Provisions and Recipes''] Page 79, Edition 2.

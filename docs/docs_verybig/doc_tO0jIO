In October 1985, Hollings and Republicans [[Phil Gramm]] and [[Warren Rudman]] sponsored an amendment to establish a budget deficit ceiling that would decline to zero by 1991 that was attached to a bill raising the [[debt limit]] of the federal government by more than $250{{nbs}}billion. The amendment was approved by a vote of 75 to 24 and was stated as a possible prelude to a balanced budget in five years without a tax increase by [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[James Baker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/14/us/treasury-head-defends-plan-for-ending-deficit.html|title=Treasury Head Defends Plan for Ending Deficit|date=October 14, 1985|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 Presidential primaries]], Hollings endorsed [[Jesse Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=55210|title=Our Campaigns - US President - D Primaries Race - Feb 01, 1988|website=www.ourcampaigns.com|access-date=November 24, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111013847/http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=55210|archive-date=November 11, 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1989, Hollings announced from his Washington office that he would request the [[General Accounting Office]] investigate efforts by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] to provide timely assistance and funds to victims of [[Hurricane Hugo]] the previous month. Hollings charged FEMA with &quot;stonewalling, fretting and filling out forms&quot; and called on the federal government to become more active in trying to relieve areas devastated by Hurricane Hugo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1989/10/03/Hollings-calls-for-FEMA-investigation/4897623390400/|title=Hollings calls for FEMA investigation|date=October 3, 1989|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1990, Hollings planned the compiling of the Senate Budget Committee to vote on a cut in [[Social Security tax]]es, an idea initially forwarded at the end of the previous year by fellow Democratic senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] as a way of making Congress address what he considered to be a serious problem in the management of the Social Security trust funds. Hollings sought a revenue figure which reflected the $36{{nbs}}billion tax cut through a rollback of Social Security payroll taxes increases that were scheduled to take effect January{{nbs}}1 and confirmed he would ask his colleagues on the budget committee to remove the trust funds from the budget deficit calculation and vote on the 1991 budget including a $300{{nbs}}billion deficit. Hollings's plan included a five percent [[value-added tax]] on goods and services in addition to a ten percent oil import fee as well as an increase in the top income tax rate to thirty-three percent among wealthiest taxpayers. The goal was considered an uphill battle where Hollings could be outmaneuvered in committee with parliamentary tactics that would result in the precluding of a straight up-or-down vote on the Social Security tax cut. Acknowledging this, Hollings said, &quot;They may try to block me. But we will find a bill by God to cut Social Security taxes. There will be a vote.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/24/us/decision-is-urged-on-social-security.html|title=DECISION IS URGED ON SOCIAL SECURITY|date=April 24, 1990|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1991, Hollings joined most Democratic senators in voting against a resolution authorizing war against Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/01/12/Senate-vote-authorizing-military-force-against-Iraq/3439806032531/|title=Senate vote authorizing military force against Iraq|date=January 12, 1991|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Hollings told reporters he attended international summits because, &quot;Everybody likes to go to [[Geneva]]. I used to do it for the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea conferences]] and you'd find those potentates from down in [[Africa]], you know, rather than eating each other, they'd just come up and get a good square meal in Geneva.&quot;&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Hollings had previously caused controversy when responding to [[Yoshio Sakurauchi]]'s commentary that Americans are lazy and illiterate. Hollings replied, &quot;You should draw a mushroom cloud and put underneath it, 'Made in America by lazy and illiterate Americans and tested in Japan'.&quot;&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Hollings remained very popular in South Carolina over the years, even as the state became increasingly friendly to Republicans at the national level. In his first three bids for a full term, he never dropped below sixty percent of the vote. In [[United States Senate election in South Carolina, 1992|the 1992 election]], however, he faced an unexpectedly close race against former Congressman [[Tommy Hartnett]] in what was otherwise a very good year for Democrats nationally. Hartnett had represented the Charleston area in Congress from 1981 to 1987, thus making him Hollings's congressman. His appeal in the [[Lowcountry]]{{snd}}traditionally a swing region at the state level{{snd}}enabled him to hold Hollings to only fifty percent of the vote.

In his last [[United States Senate election in South Carolina, 1998|Senate race in 1998]], Hollings faced [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] congressman [[Bob Inglis]]. One of the more heated moments of the race was a newspaper interview in which Hollings referred to Inglis as a &quot;goddamn skunk&quot;. Hollings was re-elected 52%–45%.

On January 7, 2003, Hollings introduced the controversial Universal National Service Act of 2006, which would require all men and women aged 18–26 (with some exceptions) to perform a year of military service.

On August 4, 2003, he announced that he would not run for re-election in November 2004. Republican [[Jim DeMint]] succeeded him.

As a senator, Hollings supported legislation in the interests of the established media distribution industry (such as the proposed &quot;[[Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act]]&quot;). His hard-line support of various [[client-side]] computer restrictions such as [[Digital rights management|DRM]] and [[Trusted computing]] led the [[Fritz chip]] (a microchip that enforces such restrictions) to be nicknamed after him. Hollings also sponsored the [[Online Personal Privacy Act]].&lt;ref&gt;(S. 2201)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later career, Hollings was moderate politically but was supportive of many [[civil rights]] bills. He voted for re-authorizing the [[Voting Rights Act]] in 1982. However, in 1967 he was one of the 11 senators who voted against the confirmation of [[Thurgood Marshall]], the first black [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] justice.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/240_1967.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Hollings later voted in favor of the failed nomination of [[Robert Bork]] and also for the successful nomination of [[Clarence Thomas]].

On fiscal issues, he was generally conservative, and was one of the primary sponsors of the [[Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act]], an attempt to enforce limits on government spending.

Hollings and [[Howell Heflin]] of [[Alabama]] were the only two Democratic senators to vote against the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=103&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00011|title=U.S. Senate: U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 103rd Congress - 1st Session|website=www.senate.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post Senatorial life and death==

In retirement, Hollings wrote opinion editorials for newspapers in South Carolina and was a regular contributor to the [[Huffington Post]]. His opinion editorials were also published every week in EconomyInCrisis.org, an independent protectionist news blog. In 2008, [[the University of South Carolina Press]] published ''Making Government Work'', a book authored by Hollings with Washington, D.C., journalist Kirk Victor, imparting Hollings's view on the changes needed in Washington. Among other things, the book recommended a dramatic decrease in the amount of campaign spending. It also attacked [[free trade]] policies as inherently destructive, suggesting that certain protectionist measures built the United States and that only a few parties actually benefited from free trade, such as large manufacturing corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Making Government Work|url= https://archive.org/details/makinggovernment00holl|url-access= registration|year= 2008|publisher= University of South Carolina Press|location= Columbia, S.C. |author= Hollings, Ernest with Kirk Victor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hollings Cancer Center at the Medical University of South Carolina, in Charleston, was established in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollingscancercenter.org/leadership/index.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 7, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200607185404/https://www.hollingscancercenter.org/leadership/index.html |archive-date=June 7, 2020 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hollings started the Hollings Scholarship in 2005. It gave more than a hundred undergraduates from around the country a ten-week internship with the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] and a monetary scholarship for the school year.

Hollings helped to establish the [[Hollings Center|Hollings Center for International Dialogue]], an organization which promotes dialogue between the United States and [[Turkey]], the nations of the Middle East, North Africa, and Southwest Asia, and other countries with predominantly Muslim populations in order to open channels of communication, deepen cross-cultural understanding, expand people-to-people contacts, and generate new thinking on important international issues.

Hollings was also on the board of advisors as a distinguished visiting professor of Law with the [[Charleston School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charlestonlaw.edu/v.php?pg=20 |title=Board of Advisors webpage |publisher=Charleston School of Law.

On April 6, 2019, Hollings died at the age of 97 at his home in [[Isle of Palms, South Carolina]], following a period of declining health.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes obituary&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.postandcourier.com/politics/ernest-f-fritz-hollings/article_b8041de2-f44b-11e8-b33f-536d8d509c2c.html|title=Former SC Governor, U.S. Senator Ernest F.

'''Goliath''' ({{IPAc-en|ɡ|ə|ˈ|l|aɪ|ə|θ}} {{respell|gə|LY|əth}}){{efn|{{lang-he-n|גָּלְיָת}} ''Golyāṯ''; {{lang-ar|جُليات}} ''Ǧulyāt'' &lt;small&gt;(Christian term)&lt;/small&gt; or {{lang|ar|جَالُوت}} {{transl|ar|Ǧālūt}} &lt;small&gt;(Quranic term)&lt;/small&gt;.}} is described in the biblical [[Book of Samuel]] as a [[Philistines|Philistine]] [[giant]] defeated by the young [[David]] in [[single combat]]. The story signified [[Saul]]'s unfitness to rule, as Saul himself should have fought for [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Israel]].{{sfn|Nelson|2000|p=519}} Scholars today believe that the original listed killer of Goliath was [[Elhanan, son of Jair]], and that the authors of the [[Deuteronomist#Deuteronomistic history|Deuteronomic history]] changed the original text to credit the victory to the more famous character, David.{{sfn|Halpern|2003|p=8}}

The phrase &quot;[[Goliath#Modern usage of &quot;David and Goliath&quot;|David and Goliath]]&quot; has taken on a more popular meaning, denoting an [[Underdog (term)|underdog]] situation, a contest where a smaller, weaker opponent faces a much bigger, stronger adversary.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/american_english/david-and-goliath | title=David and Goliath | encyclopedia=Oxford Advanced American Dictionary | accessdate=11 February 2015}} &quot;used to describe a situation in which a small or weak person or organization tries to defeat another much larger or stronger opponent: ''The game looks like it will be a David and Goliath contest.''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical account==
===The Goliath narrative in 1 Samuel 17===
[[File:071A.David Slays Goliath.jpg|thumb|upright|David hoists the severed head of Goliath as illustrated by [[Gustave Doré]] (1866).]]
[[Saul]] and the [[Israelites]] are facing the [[Philistines]] in the [[Valley of Elah]]. Twice a day for 40 days, morning and evening, Goliath, the [[champion]] of the Philistines, comes out between the lines and challenges the Israelites to send out a champion of their own to decide the outcome in [[Single combat#Single combat|single combat]], but Saul is afraid. David accepts the challenge. Saul reluctantly agrees and offers his armor, which David declines, taking only his staff, sling and five stones from a brook.

David and Goliath confront each other, Goliath with his armor and javelin, David with his staff and sling. &quot;The Philistine cursed David by his gods&quot;, but David replies: &quot;This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down; and I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel, and that all this assembly may know that God saves not with sword and spear; for the battle is God's, and he will give you into our hand.&quot;

David hurls a stone from his sling and hits Goliath in the center of his forehead, Goliath falls on his face to the ground, and David cuts off his head. The Philistines flee and are pursued by the Israelites &quot;as far as [[Gath (city)|Gath]] and the gates of [[Ekron]]&quot;. David puts the armor of Goliath in his own tent and takes the head to [[Jerusalem]], and Saul sends [[Abner]] to bring the boy to him. The king asks whose son he is, and David answers, &quot;I am the son of your servant [[Jesse]] the [[Bethlehem]]ite.&quot;

===Composition of the Book of Samuel and the Goliath narrative===
The [[Books of Samuel]], together with the books of [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]], [[Book of Judges|Judges]] and [[Books of Kings|Kings]], make up a unified history of Israel which biblical scholars call the [[Deuteronomistic history]]. The first edition of the history was probably written at the court of Judah's King [[Josiah]] (late 7th century BCE) and a revised second edition during the exile (6th century BCE), with further revisions in the post-exilic period.{{sfn|Campbell|O'Brien|2000|p=2 and fn6}}{{sfn|Person|2010|p=10–11}} Traces of this can be seen in the contradictions and illogicalities of the Goliath story - to take a few examples, David turns from Saul's adult shield-bearer into a child herding sheep for his father, Saul finds it necessary to send for him when as the king's shield-bearer he should already be beside his royal master, and then has to ask who David is, which sits strangely with David's status at his court.{{sfn|Campbell|O'Brien|2000|p=262 fn62}} The Goliath story is made up of base-narrative with numerous additions made probably after the exile:{{sfn|Campbell|O'Brien|2000|p=259-260 fn58}}

==Textual considerations==

=== Goliath's height ===
[[File:Andrea Vaccaro - David with the Head of Goliath.jpg|thumb|upright|''David with the Head of Goliath'', circa 1635, by [[Andrea Vaccaro]]]]

The oldest manuscripts, namely the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] text of Samuel from the late 1st century BCE, the 1st-century CE historian [[Josephus]], and the major Septuagint manuscripts, all give it as &quot;four [[cubit]]s and a [[Span (unit)|span]]&quot; ({{convert|6|ft|9|in|disp=or}}), whereas the [[Masoretic Text]] has &quot;six cubits and a span&quot; ({{convert|9|ft|9|in|disp=or}}).&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, C. S. (1992). &quot;Goliath (Person)&quot;. In D. N. Freedman (ed.), ''The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary'' (Vol. 2, p. 1073). New York: Doubleday&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. Daniel |last=Hays |title=Reconsidering the Height of Goliath |journal=[[Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society]] |volume=48 |issue=4 |date=December 2005 |pages=701–2 |url=http://www.etsjets.org/files/JETS-PDFs/48/48-4/JETS_48-4_701-714.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars have suggested that the smaller number grew in the course of transmission (only a few have suggested the reverse, that an original larger number was reduced), possibly when a scribe's eye was drawn to the number six in line 17:7.{{sfn|Driesbach|2016|p=73}}

===Goliath and Saul===
The underlying purpose of the story of Goliath is to show that Saul is not fit to be king (and that David is). Saul was chosen to lead the Israelites against their enemies, but when faced with Goliath he refuses to do so; Saul is a head taller than anyone else in all Israel (1 Samuel 9:2), which implies he was over {{convert|6|ft|m}} tall and the obvious challenger for Goliath, yet David is the one who eventually defeated him. Also, Saul's armour and weaponry are apparently no worse than Goliath's (and David, of course, refuses Saul's armour in any case). &quot;David declares that when a lion or bear came and attacked his father's sheep, he battled against it and killed it, [but Saul] has been cowering in fear instead of rising up and attacking the threat to his sheep (i.e. Israel).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2005&quot;/&gt;

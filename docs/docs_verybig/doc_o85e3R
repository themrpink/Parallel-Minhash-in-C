==Early life==
Clarissa Harlowe Barton was born on December 25, 1821, in North Oxford, Massachusetts and was named after the titular character of Samuel Richardson's novel ''[[Clarissa]]''. Her father was Captain Stephen Barton, a member of the local militia and a selectman (politician) who inspired his daughter with patriotism and a broad humanitarian interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; He was a soldier under the command of General Anthony Wayne in his crusade against the Indians in the northwest. He was also the leader of progressive thought in the Oxford village area.&lt;ref name=Humanitarian&gt;Bacon-Foster, Corra. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40067108 ''Clara Barton, Humanitarian'']. Records of the Columbia Historical Society, Washington, D.C. 21 (1918): 278–356. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Barton's mother was Sarah Stone Barton.

When she was three years old, Barton was sent to school with her brother Stephen, where she excelled in reading and spelling. At school, she became close friends with Nancy Fitts; she is the only known friend Barton had as a child due to her extreme timidity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barton, Clara 1980&quot;&gt;Barton, Clara. ''The Story of My Childhood'' New York: Arno Press Inc, (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

When Barton was ten years old, she assigned herself the task of nursing her brother David back to health after he fell from the roof of a barn and received a severe head injury. She learned how to distribute the prescribed medication to her brother, as well as how to place leeches on his body to bleed him (a standard treatment at the time). She continued to care for David long after doctors had given up. He made a full recovery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barton, Clara 1980&quot;/&gt;

Her parents tried to help cure her timidity by enrolling her to Colonel Stones High School, but their strategy turned out to be a catastrophe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pryor, Elizabeth Brown 1987&quot;&gt;Pryor, Elizabeth Brown. Clara Barton: Professional Angel Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; Barton became more timid and depressed and would not eat. She was brought back home to regain her health.

Upon her return, her family relocated to help a family member; a paternal cousin of Clara's had died and left his wife with four children and a farm. The house that the Barton family was to live in needed to be painted and repaired.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barton, Clara 1980&quot;/&gt; Clara was persistent in offering assistance, much to the gratitude of her family. After the work was done, she was at a loss because there wasn’t anything else to help with, to not feel like a burden to her family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pryor, Elizabeth Brown 1987&quot;/&gt;

She began to play with her boy cousins and to their surprise, she was good at keeping up with such activities as horseback riding. It wasn’t until after she had injured herself that Clara’s mother began to question her playing with the boys. Her mother decided she should focus on more lady-like skills. She invited one of Clara's girl cousins over to help develop her femininity. From her cousin, she gained proper social skills as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pryor|first=Elizabeth Brown|title=Clara Barton: professional angel|year=1988|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-8122-1273-0|edition=1st pbk. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barton was beginning to be shy. To assist Barton with overcoming her shyness, her parents persuaded her to become a schoolteacher.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANB&quot;&gt;Pryor, Elizabeth Brown. Barton, Clara. [http://www.anb.org/articles/12/12-00054.html American National Biography, (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt; She achieved her first teacher's certificate in 1839, at only 17 years old. This profession interested Barton greatly and helped motivate her; she ended up conducting an effective redistricting campaign that allowed the children of workers to receive an education. Successful projects such as this gave Barton the confidence needed when she demanded equal pay for teaching.

==Early professional life==

Barton became an educator in 1838 and served for 12 years in schools in Canada and West Georgia. Barton fared well as a teacher; she knew how to handle rambunctious children, particularly the boys since as a child she enjoyed her boy cousins' and brothers' company. She learned how to act like them, making it easier for her to relate to and control the boys in her care.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pryor, Elizabeth Brown 1987&quot;/&gt; After her mother's death in 1851, the family home closed down. Barton decided to further her education by pursuing writing and languages at the [[Clinton Liberal Institute]] in New York. In this college, she developed many friendships that broadened her point of view on many issues concurring at the time. The principal of the institute recognized her tremendous abilities and admired her work. This friendship lasted for many years, eventually turning into a romance.&lt;ref name=Humanitarian/&gt; As a writer, her terminology was pristine and easy to understand. Her writings and bodies of work could instruct the local statesmen.&lt;ref name=Humanitarian/&gt;

While teaching in Hightstown, Barton learned about the lack of public schools in Bordentown, the neighboring city.&lt;ref name=Humanitarian/&gt; In 1852, she was contracted to open a [[free education|free school]] in Bordentown, which was the first ever free school in New Jersey.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of American Women's History, Vol. 696|last=Howard|first=Angela|last2=M.

Both women were making $250 a year. This accomplishment compelled the town to raise nearly $4,000 for a new school building. Once completed, though, Barton was replaced as principal by a man elected by the school board. They saw the position as head of a large institution to be unfitting for a woman. She was demoted to &quot;female assistant&quot; and worked in a harsh environment until she had a nervous breakdown along with other health ailments, and quit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spiegel, Allen D&quot;&gt;Spiegel, Allen D. &quot;The Role of Gender, Phrenology, Discrimination and Nervous Prostration in Clara Barton's Career&quot;. ''Journal of Community Health'' 20.6 (1995): 501–526.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1855, she moved to Washington D.C. and began work as a clerk in the [[US Patent Office]];&lt;ref name=&quot;uua&quot;&gt;[http://uudb.org/articles/clarabarton.html Clara Barton], Dictionary of Unitarian &amp; Universalist Biography&lt;/ref&gt; this was the first time a woman had received a substantial clerkship in the federal government and at a salary equal to a man's salary. For three years, she received much abuse and slander from male clerks.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Great American Women of the 19th Century: A Biographical Encyclopedia|last=E.

==American Civil War==
[[File:Clarabartonwcbbrady.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Clara Barton circa 1866.]]

On April 19, 1861, the [[Baltimore riot of 1861|Baltimore Riot]] resulted in the first bloodshed of the American Civil War. Victims within the Massachusetts regiment were transported to Washington D.C. after the violence, which happened to be Barton's home at the time. Wanting to serve her country, Barton went to the railroad station when the victims arrived and nursed 40 men.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Barton provided crucial, personal assistance to the men in uniform, many of whom were wounded, hungry and without any supplies other than what they carried on their backs. She began helping them by personally taking supplies to the unfinished Capitol Building where the young men of the [[6th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Militia|6th Massachusetts Militia]], who had been attacked in Baltimore, Maryland, were housed.

Barton quickly recognized them, as she had grown up with some of them, and some she had even taught. Barton, along with several other women, personally provided clothing, food, and supplies for the sick and wounded soldiers. She learned how to store and distribute medical supplies and offered emotional support to the soldiers by keeping their spirits high. She would read books to them, write letters to their families for them, talk to them, and support them.&lt;ref name=&quot;redcross.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org/about-us/history/clara-barton|title=Clara Barton {{!}} American Red Cross Founder {{!}} Who is Clara Barton|website=American Red Cross|access-date=December 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was on that day that she identified herself with army work and began her efforts towards collecting medical supplies for the Union soldiers. Prior to distributing provisions directly onto the battlefield and gaining further support, Barton used her own living quarters as a storeroom and distributed supplies with the help of a few friends in early 1862, despite opposition in the War Department and among field surgeons.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; [[Ladies' Aid Society|Ladies' Aid]] societies helped in sending bandages, food, and clothing that would later be distributed during the Civil War.  In August 1862, Barton finally gained permission from [[Quartermaster]] Daniel Rucker to work on the front lines.  She gained support from other people who believed in her cause.  These people became her patrons, her most supportive being [[Henry Wilson|Senator Henry Wilson]] of Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Woman of Valor |last=Oates |first=Stephen B. |authorlink=Stephen B.

After the [[First Battle of Bull Run]], Barton placed an ad in a Massachusetts newspaper for supplies; the response was a profound influx of supplies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tsui&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Tsui|first=Bonnie|title=She Went to the Field: Women Soldiers of the Civil War|location=Guilford|publisher=Two Dot|date=2006|isbn=978-0-7627-4384-1|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked to distribute stores, clean field hospitals, apply dressings, and serve food to wounded soldiers in close proximity to several battles, including [[Battle of Cedar Mountain|Cedar Mountain]], [[Second Battle of Bull Run|Second Bull Run]], [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]], and [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Woman of Valor |last=Oates |first=Stephen B. |authorlink=Stephen B.

In 1863 she began a romantic relationship with an officer, Colonel John J. Elwell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Woman of Valor |last=Oates |first=Stephen B. |authorlink=Stephen B.

In 1864, she was appointed by Union General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] as the &quot;lady in charge&quot; of the hospitals at the front of the [[Army of the James]]. Among her more harrowing experiences was an incident in which a bullet tore through the sleeve of her dress without striking her and killed a man to whom she was tending. She was known as the &quot;[[Florence Nightingale]] of America&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZW_aAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA115 |title=The Life of Clara Barton: Founder of the American Red Cross, Volume 2 |chapter=The Forerunners of the Red Cross |first=William Eleazar |last=Barton |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] |page=115 |year=1922 |access-date=February 4, 2019 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also known as the &quot;Angel of the Battlefield&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;redcross.org&quot;/&gt; after she came to the aid of the overwhelmed surgeon on duty following the battle of Cedar Mountain in Northern Virginia in August 1862.  She arrived at a field hospital at midnight with a large number of supplies to help the severely wounded soldiers. This naming came from her frequent timely assistance as she served troops at the battles of Fairfax Station, Chantilly, Harpers Ferry, South Mountain, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Charleston, Petersburg and Cold Harbor.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WDL&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7315/ |title = The Story of My Childhood |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1907 |accessdate = October 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post American Civil War==
After the end of the American Civil War, Barton discovered that thousands of letters from distraught relatives to the War Department were going unanswered because the soldiers they were questioning about were buried in unmarked graves. Many of these soldiers were labeled just as &quot;missing&quot;. Motivated to do more about the situation, Miss Barton contacted President Lincoln in hopes that she would be allowed to respond officially to these unanswered inquiries. She was given permission, and &quot;The Search for the Missing Men&quot; commenced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ida&quot;&gt;Harper, Ida H. &quot;The Life and Work of Clara Barton&quot;. ''The North American Review'' 195.678 
(1912): 701–712.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, she ran the Office of Missing Soldiers, at 437 ½ Seventh Street, [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.]] in the [[Gallery Place (WMATA station)|Gallery Place]] neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dcwriters.poetrymutual.org/Pages/barton.html Clara Barton] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305062748/http://dcwriters.poetrymutual.org/Pages/barton.html |date=March 5, 2016 }}. dcwriters.poetrymutual.org&lt;/ref&gt; The office's purpose was to find or identify soldiers killed or [[missing in action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilwarmed.org/clara-bartons-missing-soldiers-office-2/ |title=Clara Barton Missing Soldiers Office |publisher=National Museum of Civil War Medicine |accessdate=June 30, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221130043/http://www.civilwarmed.org/clara-bartons-missing-soldiers-office-2/ |archivedate=December 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barton and her assistants wrote 41,855 replies to inquiries and helped locate more than twenty-two thousand missing men. Barton spent the summer of 1865 helping find, identify, and properly bury 13,000 individuals who died in [[Andersonville National Historic Site|Andersonville prison camp]], a Confederate prisoner-of-war camp in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Clara Barton and Andersonville |url=http://www.nps.gov/ande/learn/historyculture/clara_barton.htm |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=January 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued this task over the next four years, burying 20,000 more Union soldiers and marking their graves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ida&quot; /&gt; Congress eventually appropriated $15,000 toward her project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peck |first=Garrett |title=Walt Whitman in Washington, D.C.: The Civil War and America's Great Poet |year=2015 |publisher=The History Press |location=Charleston, SC |isbn=978-1-62619-973-6 |pages=76–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Red Cross==
[[File:Clara Barton cross monument at Antietam battlefield.TIF|thumb|Detail of Clara Barton monument at [[Antietam National Battlefield]], with red cross formed of a brick from the home where she was born.]]

Barton achieved widespread recognition by delivering lectures around the country about her war experiences in 1865–1868. During this time she met [[Susan B. Anthony]] and began an association with the woman's [[suffrage]] movement. She also became acquainted with [[Frederick Douglass]] and became an activist for [[civil rights]].  After her countrywide tour she was both mentally and physically exhausted and under doctor's orders to go somewhere that would take her far from her current work. She closed the Missing Soldiers Office in 1868 and traveled to Europe. In 1869, during her trip to [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], Barton was introduced to the [[International Red Cross|Red Cross]] and Dr. Appia; he later would invite her to be the representative for the American branch of the Red Cross and help her find financial benefactors for the start of the American Red Cross. She was also introduced to [[Henry Dunant]]'s book ''A Memory of Solferino'', which called for the formation of national societies to provide relief voluntarily on a neutral basis.

At the beginning of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], in 1870, she assisted the [[Princess Louise of Prussia|Grand Duchess of Baden]] in the preparation of military hospitals and gave the Red Cross society much aid during the war. At the joint request of the German authorities and the [[Strasbourg]] Comité de Secours, she superintended the supplying of work to the poor of Strasbourg in 1871, after the [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)|Siege of Paris]], and in 1871 had charge of the public distribution of supplies to the destitute people of Paris. At the close of the war, she received honorable decorations of the Golden Cross of [[Baden]] and the Prussian [[Iron Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Appletons'|wstitle=Barton, Clara|year=1900|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Barton returned to the United States, she inaugurated a movement to gain recognition for the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)]] by the United States government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Epler&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/lifeclarabarton00eplegoog |title=The Life of Clara Barton |first=Percy Harold |last=Epler |publisher=Macmillan |year=1915 |accessdate=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1873, she began work on this project.  In 1878, she met with President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], who expressed the opinion of most Americans at that time which was the U.S. would never again face a calamity like the Civil War. Barton finally succeeded during the administration of President [[Chester Arthur]], using the argument that the new [[American Red Cross]] could respond to crises other than war such as natural disasters like earthquakes, forest fires, and hurricanes.

Barton became President of the American branch of the society, which held its first official meeting at her I Street apartment in Washington, DC, May 21, 1881. The first local society was founded August 22, 1881 in [[Dansville, Livingston County, New York]], where she maintained a country home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History – Founder Clara Barton |last=Marks |first=Mary Jo |publisher=American Red Cross |url=http://www.redcross.org/about-us/history/clara-barton |accessdate=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCullough |first=David |authorlink=David McCullough |title=The Johnstown Flood |year=1968 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-0-671-39530-8 |page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clara Barton 1948 issue 3c.JPG|thumb|left|268px|Clara Barton was honored with a U.S. commemorative stamp, issued in 1948]]

The society's role changed with the advent of the [[Spanish–American War]] during which it aided refugees and prisoners of the civil war. Once the Spanish–American War was over the grateful people of Santiago built a statue in honor of Barton in the town square, which still stands there today. In the United States, Barton was praised in numerous newspapers and reported about Red Cross operations in person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dromi |first1=Shai M. |title=Above the fray: The Red Cross and the making of the humanitarian NGO sector |date=2020 |publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=9780226680101 |pages=102-106 |url=https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/A/bo46479924.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestically in 1884 she helped in the floods on the Ohio river, provided Texas with food and supplies during the famine of 1887 and took workers to Illinois in 1888 after a tornado and that same year to Florida for the yellow fever epidemic.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCullough 1968&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=McCullough |first=David |authorlink=David McCullough |title=The Johnstown Flood |year=1968 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-0-671-39530-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within days after the [[Johnstown Flood]] in 1889, she led her delegation of 50 doctors and nurses in response.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCullough 1968&quot; /&gt; In 1897, responding to the humanitarian crisis in the Ottoman Empire in the aftermath of the [[Hamidian massacres]], Barton sailed to [[Constantinople]] and after long negotiations with [[Abdul Hamid II]], opened the first American International Red Cross headquarters in the heart of Turkey. Barton herself traveled along with five other Red Cross expeditions to the Armenian provinces in the spring of 1896, providing relief and humanitarian aid. Barton also worked in hospitals in Cuba in 1898 at the age of seventy-seven.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Ardalan, &quot;Clara Barton's 1898 battles in Cuba: a reexamination of her nursing contributions.&quot; ''Florida Atlantic Comparative Studies Journal'' 12.1 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Barton's last field operation as President of the American Red Cross was helping victims of the [[Galveston Hurricane of 1900|Galveston hurricane]] in 1900. The operation established an orphanage for children.

As criticism arose of her mixing professional and personal resources, Barton was forced to resign as president of the American Red Cross in 1904, at the age of 83 because of her egocentric leadership style fitting poorly into the formal structure of an organizational charity.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; She had been forced out of office by a new generation of all-male scientific experts who reflected the realistic efficiency of the Progressive Era rather than her idealistic humanitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;David Henry Burton, ''Clara Barton: In the Service of Humanity'' (Greenwood, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; In memory of the courageous women of the civil war, the Red Cross Headquarters was founded.

Print.&lt;/ref&gt; After resigning, Barton founded the [[National First Aid Society]].

==Final years==
She continued to live in her [[Glen Echo, Maryland]] home which also served as the Red Cross Headquarters upon her arrival to the house in 1897. Barton published her autobiography in 1907, titled ''The Story of My Childhood''.&lt;ref name=&quot;WDL&quot;/&gt; On April 12, 1912 at the age of 90, she died in her home. The cause of death was [[pneumonia]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;My dear friend and sister:

Your belief that I am a Universalist is as correct as your greater belief that you are one yourself, a belief in which all who are privileged to possess it rejoice. In my case, it was a great gift, like St. Paul, I &quot;was born free&quot;, and saved the pain of reaching it through years of struggle and doubt.

My father was a leader in the building of the church in which Hosea Ballow preached his first dedication sermon. Your historic records will show that the old Huguenot town of Oxford, Mass. erected one of, if not the first Universalist Church in America. In this town I was born; in this church I was reared. In all its reconstructions and remodelings I have taken a part, and I look anxiously for a time in the near future when the busy world will let me once more become a living part of its people, praising God for the advance in the liberal faith of the religions of the world today, so largely due to the teachings of this belief.

Give, I pray you, dear sister, my warmest congratulations to the members of your society. My best wishes for the success of your annual meeting, and accept my thanks most sincerely for having written me.

Fraternally yours, (Signed) Clara Barton.&lt;/blockquote&gt; While she was not an active member of her parents' church, Barton wrote about how well known her family was in her hometown and how many relationships her father formed with others in their town through their church and religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pryor, Elizabeth Brown 1987&quot;/&gt;

==Clara Barton National Historic Site==
[[File:CBcolorizedhouse.jpg|thumb|right|&amp;nbsp;]]
In 1975, the [[Clara Barton National Historic Site]], located at 5801 Oxford Road, [[Glen Echo, Maryland]], was established as a unit of the [[National Park Service]] at Barton's home, where she spent the last 15 years of her life. As the first [[National Historical Park|National Historic Site]] dedicated to the accomplishments of a woman, it preserves the early history of the American Red Cross, since the home also served as an early headquarters of the organization.  [[Clara Barton Homestead|The North Oxford, Massachusetts, house in which she was born]] is now also a museum.

The National Park Service has restored eleven rooms, including the Red Cross offices, the parlors, and Barton's bedroom. Visitors to Clara Barton National Historic Site can gain a sense of how Barton lived and worked. Guides lead tourists through the three levels, emphasizing Barton's use of her unusual home. In 2018 the site was indefinitely closed due to repairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;nhshouse&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Clara Barton's Missing Soldiers Office==
In 1869, Barton closed the Missing Soldiers Office and headed to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nps.gov/clba/learn/kidsyouth/chron2.htm | title=Clara Barton Chronology 1861–1869 | publisher=National Park Service | accessdate=June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third floor of her old boardinghouse was boarded up in 1913, and the site forgotten. The site was &quot;lost&quot; in part because Washington, DC realigned its addressing system in the 1870s.

'''Computer engineering''' ('''CoE''' or '''CpE''') is a branch of [[engineering]] that integrates several fields of [[computer science]] and [[electronic engineering]] required to develop [[computer hardware]] and [[computer software|software]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer engineers usually have training in electronic engineering (or [[electrical engineering]]), [[software design]], and hardware-software integration instead of only [[software engineering]] or electronic engineering. Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of [[computing]], from the design of individual [[microcontroller]]s, [[microprocessor]]s, [[personal computers]], and [[supercomputer]]s, to [[circuit design]]. This field of engineering not only focuses on ''how'' computer systems themselves work but also how they integrate into the larger picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}, &quot;Computer engineers need not only to understand how computer systems themselves work but also how they integrate into the larger picture. Consider the car. A modern car contains many separate computer systems for controlling such things as the engine timing, the brakes, and the airbags. To be able to design and implement such a car, the computer engineer needs a broad theoretical understanding of all these various subsystems &amp; how they interact.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usual tasks involving computer engineers include [[Software programming|writing software]] and [[firmware]] for [[embedded system|embedded]] [[microcontroller]]s, designing [[Very-large-scale integration|VLSI]] [[Computer chip|chips]], designing [[analog device|analog]] [[sensor]]s, designing [[Mixed-signal integrated circuit|mixed signal]] [[circuit board]]s, and designing [[operating system]]s. Computer engineers are also suited for [[robotics]] research, which relies heavily on using [[digital systems]] to control and monitor [[electrical systems]] like [[Electric motor|motor]]s, [[Computer-mediated communication|communications]], and [[sensor]]s.

In many institutions of higher learning, computer engineering students are allowed to choose areas of in-depth study in their junior and senior year because the full breadth of knowledge used in the design and application of computers is beyond the scope of an [[undergraduate degree]]. Other institutions may require [[engineering student]]s to complete one or two years of [[Engineering|general engineering]] before declaring computer engineering as their primary focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Changing Majors @ Clemson| url=http://www.registrar.clemson.edu/html/changeMjr_Curr.htm |publisher=Clemson University |accessdate=September 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Declaring a College of Engineering Major |url=http://freshmanengineering.uark.edu/2041.php |publisher=University of Arkansas |accessdate=September 20, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012182736/http://freshmanengineering.uark.edu/2041.php |archive-date=October 12, 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Degree Requirements| url=http://www.cmu.edu/me/undergraduate/degree-requirements.html |publisher=Carnegie Mellon University |accessdate=September 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uca.edu.ar/index.php/site/index/es/uca/facultad-de-ciencias-fisicomatematicas-e-ingenieria/alumnos/programas-de-materias/cc1y2/ | title=Programas de Materias |language=Spanish |publisher=Universidad Católica Argentina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer engineering began in 1939 when [[John Vincent Atanasoff]] and [[Clifford Berry]] began developing the world's first electronic [[digital computer]] through [[physics]], [[mathematics]], and [[electrical engineering]]. John Vincent Atanasoff was once a physics and mathematics teacher for [[Iowa State University]] and Clifford Berry a former graduate under electrical engineering and physics. Together, they created the [[Atanasoff–Berry computer|Atanasoff-Berry computer]], also known as the ABC which took 5 years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~td2177/JVAtanasoff/JVAtanasoff.html|title=John Vincent Atanasoff - the father of the computer|website=www.columbia.edu|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While the original ABC was dismantled and discarded in the 1940s a tribute was made to the late inventors, a replica of the ABC was made in 1997 where it took a team of researchers and engineers four years and $350,000 to build.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.news.iastate.edu/news/2009/dec/abc|title=Iowa State replica of first electronic digital computer going to Computer History Museum - News Service - Iowa State University|website=www.news.iastate.edu|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern [[personal computer]] emerged in the 1970s, after several breakthroughs in [[semiconductor]] technology. These include the first working [[transistor]] by [[William Shockley]], [[John Bardeen]] and [[Walter Brattain]] at [[Bell Labs]] in 1947,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1947: Invention of the Point-Contact Transistor |url=https://www.computerhistory.org/siliconengine/invention-of-the-point-contact-transistor/ |website=The Silicon Engine |publisher=[[Computer History Museum]] |accessdate=9 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[silicon]] [[surface passivation]] process (via [[thermal oxidation]]) by [[Mohamed Atalla]] at Bell Labs in 1957,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lojek |first1=Bo |title=History of Semiconductor Engineering |date=2007 |publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]] |isbn=9783540342588 |pages=120 &amp; 321-323}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bassett46&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bassett |first1=Ross Knox |title=To the Digital Age: Research Labs, Start-up Companies, and the Rise of MOS Technology |date=2007 |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |isbn=9780801886393 |page=46 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UUbB3d2UnaAC&amp;pg=PA46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sah&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sah |first=Chih-Tang |author-link=Chih-Tang Sah |title=Evolution of the MOS transistor-from conception to VLSI |journal=[[Proceedings of the IEEE]] |date=October 1988 |volume=76 |issue=10 |pages=1280–1326 (1290) |doi=10.1109/5.16328 |url=http://www.dejazzer.com/ece723/resources/Evolution_of_the_MOS_transistor.pdf |issn=0018-9219 |bibcode=1988IEEEP..76.1280S |quote=Those of us active in silicon material and device research during 1956{{ndash}}1960 considered this successful effort by the Bell Labs group led by Atalla to stabilize the silicon surface the most important and significant technology advance, which blazed the trail that led to silicon integrated circuit technology developments in the second phase and volume production in the third phase.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[monolithic integrated circuit]] chip by [[Robert Noyce]] at [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] in 1959,&lt;ref name=&quot;Saxena140&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Saxena |first1=Arjun N. |title=Invention of Integrated Circuits: Untold Important Facts |date=2009 |publisher=[[World Scientific]] |isbn=9789812814456 |page=140 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-3lpDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA140}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor]] (MOSFET, or MOS transistor) by Mohamed Atalla and [[Dawon Kahng]] at Bell Labs in 1959,&lt;ref name=&quot;computerhistory&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.computerhistory.org/siliconengine/metal-oxide-semiconductor-mos-transistor-demonstrated/|title=1960 - Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) Transistor Demonstrated|journal=The Silicon Engine|publisher=[[Computer History Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;computerhistory-transistor&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Who Invented the Transistor? |url=https://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/who-invented-the-transistor/ |website=[[Computer History Museum]] |date=4 December 2013 |accessdate=20 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;triumph&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Triumph of the MOS Transistor |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6fBEjf9WPw |website=[[YouTube]] |publisher=[[Computer History Museum]] |accessdate=21 July 2019 |date=6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the single-chip [[microprocessor]] ([[Intel 4004]]) by [[Federico Faggin]], [[Marcian Hoff]], [[Masatoshi Shima]] and [[Stanley Mazor]] at [[Intel]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerhistory1971&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=1971: Microprocessor Integrates CPU Function onto a Single Chip |url=https://www.computerhistory.org/siliconengine/microprocessor-integrates-cpu-function-onto-a-single-chip/ |website=[[Computer History Museum]] |accessdate=22 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History of computer engineering education ===
The first computer engineering degree program in the United States was established in 1971 at [[Case Western Reserve University]] in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History |url=https://engineering.case.edu/about/history |website=engineering.case.edu |publisher=Case School of Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2015}}, there were 250 [[ABET]]-accredited computer engineering programs in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Find an ABET-Accredited Program {{!}} ABET|url = http://main.abet.org/aps/accreditedprogramsearch.aspx|website = main.abet.org|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, accreditation of computer engineering schools is done by a variety of agencies part of the [[EQANIE]] network. Due to increasing job requirements for engineers who can concurrently design hardware, [[Computer software|software]], firmware, and manage all forms of computer systems used in industry, some tertiary institutions around the world offer a [[bachelor's degree]] generally called computer engineering.  Both computer engineering and [[electronic engineering]] programs include analog and digital circuit design in their curriculum. As with most engineering disciplines, having a sound knowledge of [[mathematics]] and science is necessary for computer engineers.

==Education==
Computer engineering is referred to as [[computer science and engineering]] at some universities. Most entry-level computer engineering jobs require at least a bachelor's degree in computer engineering (or computer science and engineering). Typically one must learn an array of [[mathematics]] such as [[calculus]], [[algebra]] and [[trigonometry]] and some [[computer science]] classes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} Sometimes a degree in [[electronic engineering]] is accepted, due to the similarity of the two fields. Because hardware engineers commonly work with computer software systems, a strong background in computer programming is necessary. According to BLS, &quot;a computer engineering major is similar to electrical engineering but with some computer science courses added to the curriculum&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CHE&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/computer-hardware-engineers.htm|title=Computer Hardware Engineers|date=January 8, 2014|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some large firms or specialized jobs require a master's degree.

It is also important for computer engineers to keep up with rapid advances in technology. Therefore, many continue learning throughout their careers. This can be helpful, especially when it comes to learning new skills or improving existing ones. For example, as the relative cost of fixing a bug increases the further along it is in the software development cycle, there can be greater cost savings attributed to developing and testing for quality code as soon as possible in the process, and particularly before release.&lt;ref name=&quot;The cost of fixing a bug&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feabhas.com/sites/default/files/uploads/News/Feabhas_Infographic_FINAL.pdf|title=Feabhas_Infographic_FINAL|website=feabhas|publisher=Feabhas|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two major focuses in computer engineering: hardware and software.

===Computer hardware engineering===
According to the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics|BLS]], Job Outlook employment for computer hardware engineers, the expected ten-year growth from 2014 to 2024 for computer hardware engineering was an estimated 3% and there was a total of 77,700 jobs that same year.

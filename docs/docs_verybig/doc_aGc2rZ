The '''Rhodes piano''' (also known as the '''Fender Rhodes piano''' or simply '''Fender Rhodes''' or '''Rhodes''') is an [[electric piano]] invented by [[Harold Rhodes (inventor)|Harold Rhodes]], which became popular in the 1970s. Like a conventional [[piano]], the Rhodes generates sound with keys and hammers, but instead of strings, the hammers strike thin metal [[tuning fork|tines]], which vibrate between an electromagnetic [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]]. The signal is then sent through a cable to an external [[keyboard amplifier and speaker]].

The instrument evolved from Rhodes's attempt to manufacture pianos while teaching recovering soldiers during [[World War II]]. Development continued after the war and into the following decade. In 1959, [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] began marketing the Piano Bass, a cut-down version; the full-size instrument did not appear until after Fender's sale to [[CBS]] in 1965. CBS oversaw mass production of the Rhodes piano in the 1970s, and it was used extensively through the decade, particularly in [[jazz]], [[pop music|pop]], and [[soul music]]. It was less used in the 1980s because of competition with [[Polyphony and monophony in instruments|polyphonic]] and digital [[Synthesizer|synthesizers]] such as the [[Yamaha DX7]] and an inconsistent quality control caused by [[cost reduction|cost-cutting]].

In 1987, the company was sold to [[Roland Corporation|Roland]], which manufactured digital versions of the Rhodes without authorization from Harold Rhodes. In the 1990s, the instrument experienced a resurgence in popularity, resulting in Rhodes re-obtaining the rights to the piano in 1997. Although Harold Rhodes died in 2000, the Rhodes piano has since been reissued, and his teaching methods are still in use.

The Rhodes piano's keyboard is laid out like a traditional acoustic piano, but some models contain 73 keys instead of 88.{{sfn|Vail|2000|p=266}} The 73-key model weighs around {{convert|130|lb|kg}}.{{sfn|Lenhoff|Robertson|2019|p=212}} The keyboard's touch and action is designed to be like an acoustic piano. Pressing a key results in a hammer striking a thin metal rod called a tine connected to a larger &quot;tone bar&quot;. The tone generator assembly acts as a [[tuning fork]] as the tone bar reinforces and extends the tine's vibrations. A [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]] sits opposite the tine, inducing an [[electric current]] from the vibrations like an electric guitar.{{sfn|Baerman|2003|p=52}} Simply hitting tines does not need an external [[power supply]], and a Rhodes will make sound even when not plugged into an [[amplifier]],{{sfn|Brice|2001|p=104}} though like an unplugged electric guitar, the volume level and tone will be weak.&lt;ref name=&quot;logic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://documentation.apple.com/en/logicstudio/instruments/index.html#chapter=9%26section=9%26tasks=true|title=Electric Piano Models Emulated by the EVP88|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Suitcase model Rhodes includes a built-in power amplifier and a [[tremolo]] feature that bounces the output signal from the piano across two speakers.{{sfn|Gibson|1997|p=114}} This feature is inaccurately labeled &quot;[[vibrato]]&quot; (which is a variation in pitch) on some models to be consistent with the labelling on [[Fender Amplifiers|Fender amplifiers]].{{sfn|Vail|2000|p=266}}

Although the Rhodes functions mechanically like a piano, its sound is very different.{{sfn|Gibson|1997|p=114}} Vibrating tines produce a mellower timbre,{{sfn|Gibson|1997|p=55}} and the sound changes with the tine's relative position to the pickup. Putting the two close together gives a characteristic &quot;bell&quot; sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;logic&quot;/&gt; The instrument has been compared with the [[Wurlitzer electric piano]], which uses a similar technology, but with the hammers striking metal reeds. The Rhodes has a better sustain, while the Wurlitzer produces significant [[harmonic]]s when the keys are played hard, giving it a &quot;bite&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/dec12/articles/arturia-wurlitzer-v.htm|title=Arturia Wurlitzer V|first=Gordon|last=Reid|magazine=[[Sound on Sound]]|date=December 2012|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Benjamin Love of Retro Rentals, an [[Equalization (audio)|EQ spectrum analysis]] of the instrument will have a gap where the frequency of a lead vocal can be. This means the instrument can easily support a voice performance without overpowering it.{{sfn|Lenhoff|Robertson|2019|p=212}}

==History==

===Early models===
[[File:Prepiano.png|thumb|An early version of the Rhodes piano, used for teaching]]
[[Harold Rhodes (inventor)|Harold Rhodes]] started teaching piano when he was 19. He dropped out of the [[University of Southern California]] in 1929 to support his family through the [[Great Depression]] by full-time teaching. He designed a method that combined [[classical music|classical]] and [[Jazz|jazz music]], which became popular across the United States,&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news
| title = Harold Rhodes, 89, Inventor of an Electronic Piano
| work = The New York Times
| first=Jon

| date=January 4, 2001
| accessdate=November 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led to an hour-long nationally syndicated radio show. Rhodes continued to teach piano throughout his lifetime, and his piano method continues to be taught today.&lt;ref name=&quot;rpm&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rhodespianomethod.org/history.html|title=History|publisher=Rhodes Piano Method|accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continually refined and updated the design of the instrument up to 1984.{{sfn|Lenhoff|Robertson|2019|p=212}}

By 1942, Rhodes was in the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]], where he created a piano teaching method to provide therapy for soldiers recovering from combat in hospital. From scrapped airplanes, he developed miniature pianos that could be played in bed.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hist&quot;&gt;{{cite web
| title = Rhodes Supersite: History
| publisher = Rhodes Supersite
| url = http://www.fenderrhodes.com/history/narrative.html}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Rhodes won a service award for his therapy achievements and put an electric model, the Pre-Piano, into production for home use during the late 1940s.{{sfn|Vail|2000|p=265}}

In 1959, Rhodes entered a joint venture with [[Leo Fender]] to manufacture instruments. Fender disliked the higher tones of the Pre-Piano, and decided to manufacture a [[keyboard bass]] using the bottom 32 notes (E-B), known as the Piano Bass.{{sfn|Lenhoff|Robertson|2019|p=218}} The instrument introduced the design that would become common to subsequent Rhodes pianos, with the same [[tolex]] body as Fender amplifiers and a [[fiberglass]] top. The tops came from a boat manufacturer who supplied whatever color happened to be available; consequently a number of different colored piano basses were produced.{{sfn|Vail|2000|p=266}}

===Under CBS===
[[File:6f 1.png|thumb|left|A pre-1969 &quot;Silvertop&quot; Fender Rhodes Electric Piano]]
Fender was bought by [[CBS]] in 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;DayBurns36&quot;&gt;{{cite book

| year = 1979 | page = 36 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhodes stayed with the company, and released the first Fender Rhodes piano, a 73-note model. The instrument comprised parts&amp;nbsp;— the piano, and a separate enclosure underneath containing the power amplifier and loudspeaker. Like the piano bass, it was finished in black tolex, and had a fiberglass top.{{sfn|Vail|2000|p=266}} During the late 1960s, two models of the Fender Rhodes Celeste also became available, which used the top three or four octaves, respectively, of the Fender Rhodes piano. The Celeste did not sell well and is now hard to find.{{sfn|Vail|2000|p=266}} In 1969, the fibreglass lid was replaced with vacuum-molded plastic; the earlier models became known retrospectively as &quot;silvertops&quot;.{{sfn|Lenhoff|Robertson|2019|p=218}}

The Student and Instructor models were introduced in 1965.{{sfn|Lenhoff|Robertson|2019|p=218}} They were designed to teach the piano in the classroom. By connecting the output of a network of student models, the teacher could listen to each student in isolation on the instructor model, and send an audio [[backing track]] to them. This allowed the teacher to monitor individual students' progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.magnetmagazine.com/2010/10/03/pete-yorn-is-thinking-of-fender-rhodes/|title=Fender Rhodes|first=Pete|last=Yorn|work=Magnet|date=October 3, 2010|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production of educational models ceased in 1974.{{sfn|Lenhoff|Robertson|2019|p=218}}

In 1970, the 73-note Stage Piano was introduced as a lighter and more portable alternative to the existing two-piece style, featuring four detachable legs (used in Fender steel pedal guitars), a sustain pedal derived from a Rogers [[hi-hat]] stand and a single output jack.{{sfn|Vail|2000|p=266-67}}{{sfn|Lenhoff|Robertson|2019|p=218}} Although the Stage could be used with any amplifier, catalogs suggested the use of the [[Fender Twin Reverb]].&lt;ref name=&quot;em&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|year=2002|title=Rhodes Piano|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a3IJAQAAMAAJ|publisher=Polyphony Publishing Company|volume=18|issue=1–4|work=Electronic Musician}}&lt;/ref&gt; The older style piano continued to be sold alongside the Stage and was renamed the Suitcase Piano.{{sfn|Vail|2000|p=266-67}} An 88-note model was introduced in 1971.{{sfn|Lenhoff|Robertson|2019|p=218}}

===Later models===
[[File:Rhodes Mark V.jpg|thumb|The Rhodes Mk V was the last model released by the original Rhodes corporation.|alt=]]
During the 1970s various changes were made to the Rhodes mechanics.{{sfn|Vail|2000|p=267}} In 1971 the hammer tips were changed to neoprene rubber instead of felt, to avoid the excessive need for regular maintenance, while in 1975 harp supports were changed from wood to aluminum. Although this made production cheaper, it changed the resonance of the instrument slightly. In 1977 the power amplifier design was changed from an 80 to a 100-watt model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicagoelectricpiano.com/rhodes/fender-rhodes-mark-i-vs-rhodes-mark-ii/|title=What is the difference between a Fender Rhodes Mark I and Rhodes Mark II?|publisher=Chicago Electric Piano Company|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mk II model was introduced in late 1979, which was simply a set of cosmetic changes over the most recent Mk I models. A 54-note model was added to the range.&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicagoelectricpiano.com/rhodes/the-ultimate-fender-rhodes-timeline/|title=The Ultimate Fender Rhodes Timeline|publisher=Chicago Electric Piano Company|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rhodes Mk III EK-10 was a combination electric piano and [[synthesizer]], introduced in 1980 before CBS bought [[ARP Instruments]] in 1981. It used [[Voltage-controlled oscillator|analog oscillators]] and [[Voltage-controlled filter|filters]] alongside the existing electromechanical elements. The overall effect was that of a Rhodes piano and a synthesizer being played simultaneously. The instrument was unreliable with a problematic production, particularly when a shipment of 150 units to Japan caused interference with local television reception. Compared to the new [[Polyphonic synthesizer|polyphonic synthesizers]] being marketed at the same time, it was limited in scope and sound, and very few units were sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.majorkey.com/cgi-bin/EK10.html|title=The EK-10|publisher=Major Key|accessdate=January 30, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216170429/http://www.majorkey.com/cgi-bin/EK10.html|archivedate=February 16, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final Rhodes produced by the original company was the Mk V in 1984. Among other improvements, it had a lighter plastic body and an improved action that varied the dynamics with each note. The Mark V is the easiest of the original Rhodes pianos for touring musicians to transport.&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot;/&gt; Rhodes pianos produced under the original run had an inconsistent quality as the company wanted to mass-produce the instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hammondhire.com/advice.htm|title=Advice on buying a Classic|publisher=The Hammond Hire Company|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1970s and 1980s, Chuck Monte manufactured an after-market modification to the Rhodes, known as Dyno My Piano.&lt;ref name=&quot;em&quot; /&gt; It included a lever that moved the relative position of the tines to the pickups, modifying the sound, and fed the output signal through additional electronics.{{sfn|Vail|2000|p=267}} This sound was emulated by the [[Yamaha DX7]] with a patch known as the DX7 Rhodes that was popular during the 1980s, and caused several players to abandon the Rhodes in favor of the DX7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Techno Primer: The Essential Reference for Loop-based Music Styles|last=Verderosa|first=Tony|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|year=2002|isbn=978-0-634-01788-9|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After CBS===
In 1983, Rhodes was sold to CBS boss William Schultz,&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;/&gt; who closed the main factory in 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.majorkey.com/mk2/about.html|title=About us|publisher=Major Key|accessdate=January 30, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321072609/http://www.majorkey.com/mk2/about.html|archivedate=March 21, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sold the business to the Japanese corporation [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] in 1987. Roland manufactured [[digital piano]]s under the Rhodes name, but Harold Rhodes disapproved of the instruments, which were made without his consultation.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Rhodes Mark 7 (rear), Expomusic 2010.jpg|thumb|The Rhodes Mark 7 was released in 2007.]]
Rhodes re-acquired the rights to the Rhodes piano in 1997. By then, he was in ill health and died in December 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;/&gt; In 2007, a re-formed Rhodes Music Corporation introduced a reproduction of the original electric piano, the Rhodes Mark 7, housed in a molded plastic enclosure.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAMM&quot;&gt;{{cite web

[[The Doors|Doors]] keyboardist [[Ray Manzarek]] began using Rhodes instruments when the group formed in 1965. He played basslines on a Piano Bass with his left hand, while playing organ with his right.{{sfn|Shepherd|2003|p=301}} He also played a full-sized Rhodes in the studio, such as a Mark I Stage 73 on &quot;[[Riders on the Storm]]&quot;.{{sfn|Lenhoff|Robertson|2019|p=234}} According to Manzarek, &quot;If Mr. Rhodes hadn't created the keyboard bass, the Doors would never have existed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1435932/inventor-of-fender-rhodes-piano-dies/|title=Inventor Of Fender Rhodes Piano Dies|first=Corey|last=Moss|publisher=MTV|date=January 4, 2001|accessdate=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rhodes piano became a popular instrument in [[jazz]] in the late 1960s, particularly for several sidemen who played with [[Miles Davis]]. [[Herbie Hancock]] first encountered the Rhodes in 1968 while booked for a session with Davis. He immediately became an enthusiast, noting that the amplification made him much more audible in groups when compared to the piano. Hancock continued to experiment with the Rhodes over the following years, including playing it through a [[Wah-wah pedal|wah wah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Birds of Fire: Jazz, Rock, Funk, and the Creation of Fusion|first=Kevin|last=Fellezs|publisher=Duke University Press|pages=190–191|year=2011|isbn=978-0-8223-5047-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another former Davis sideman, [[Chick Corea]], started using the Rhodes prominently during the 1970s,{{sfn|Price|2010|p=471}} as did [[Weather Report]] founder [[Joe Zawinul]].&lt;ref name=&quot;castoff&quot;&gt;{{cite news

'''Sywell Aerodrome''' {{Airport codes|ORM|EGBK}} is the local aerodrome serving the town of [[Northampton]], [[Wellingborough]], [[Kettering]] and [[Rushden]], as well as wider Northamptonshire. The aerodrome is located {{Convert|5|NM|lk=in}} northeast of Northampton and was originally opened in 1928 on the edge of [[Sywell]] village.

The aerodrome caters for [[general aviation|private flying]], [[flight training]] and corporate flights. There is one fixed-wing flying school, one [[Ultralight aviation|microlight]] school and a helicopter school. The 1930s [[Art Deco]] hotel has bar and restaurant facilities. Aviation related industries and businesses are also located at the aerodrome.

Northampton (Sywell) Aerodrome has a [[United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority|CAA]] Ordinary Licence (Number P496) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee (Sywell Aerodrome Limited).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/375/srg_asd_ordinarylicences.pdf | format= PDF | publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|CAA]] SRG | title=  Aerodrome Ordinary Licences | accessdate= 23 June 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070628053955/http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/375/srg_asd_ordinarylicences.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 28 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A viewing area is provided for [[Aircraft spotting|aircraft spotters]].

==Second World War==
The aerodrome opened in 1928 and during the [[Second World War]] the aerodrome, as RAF Sywell, was used as a training facility ([[de Havilland Tiger Moth|Tiger Moth]]s) and later an important centre for the repair of [[Vickers Wellington|Wellington bombers]]; extensive sheds from this time still remain on the site. Among World War II pilots who underwent training at Sywell were [[Pierre Clostermann]]&lt;ref&gt;Clostermann, Pierre. The Big Show. London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2004. {{ISBN|0-297-84619-1}}, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paddy Finucane]], who soloed here.

Many aerial shots for the film [[Battle of Britain (film)|''Battle of Britain'']] were taken over the airport and nearby area.

==Expansion==
Since 1999, the aerodrome sought planning permission for a hard runway, which was intended to allow operations to continue over the winter, when the grass runways often become waterlogged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Plans to improve aerodrome site | work = [[BBC News]] |date = 26 April 2006 |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/northamptonshire/4937822.stm |accessdate = 24 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisations STARE (Stop The Aerodrome Runway Expansion) and CPRE ([[Campaign to Protect Rural England]]) campaigned against this change, arguing that it would lead to more and larger aircraft flying over the area and disturb its &quot;rural tranquility&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = £1m to sort out runway debate |work = Evening Telegraph |date = 14 August 2006 |url = http://www.ketteringtoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=661&amp;ArticleID=1695015 |accessdate = 24 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Permission was granted for the runway on 22 November 2007 by the [[Department for Transport]], and though campaigners vowed to fight the decision&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/Campaigners-fight-on-despite-Sywell39s.3513780.jp | date= 22 November 2007 | work= Northampton Chronicle &amp; Echo | title= Campaigners fight on despite Sywell's runway approval | accessdate= 22 November 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071125071429/http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/Campaigners-fight-on-despite-Sywell39s.3513780.jp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 25 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; they were unsuccessful and construction of the runway began in 2008. It opened during summer 2009 and enabled safe operations during the winter of 2009/2010 and onwards. In February 2010, the final inspection of the newly completed all-weather hard runway was carried out by the CAA who confirmed that it could be licensed for use.

== Operations ==
Sywell has three all-grass operational runways and a fourth all-weather concrete runway. The aerodrome's operational hours are 0900-1700 during winter and 0800-1700 during summer. The aerodrome offers an [[Flight Information Service|Aerodrome Flight Information Service]] to pilots.

===Sywell Aviation Museum===
The aerodrome also houses the [[Sywell Aviation Museum]] dedicated to telling the wartime history of the site and the airmen that used it.

===Brooklands Flying Club===
Brooklands Flying Club&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklandsflyingclub.co.uk|title=HOME|website=HOME}}&lt;/ref&gt; was based at Sywell, with a fleet of four [[Aero AT-3]] aircraft and a [[Cessna 172]]. The club offered training for a [[Private Pilot's Licence]] (PPL), night rating and IMC rating.

The club opened in 2005 under the same name of the previous company that had been located on the airfield.

===Training===
Other flight training organisations on the airfield include:
*Sloane Helicopters
*Flylight Airsports

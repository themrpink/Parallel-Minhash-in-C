After Goscinny's death, Uderzo began to write ''Asterix'' himself and continued the series, although at a much slower pace, until passing the series over in 2011 to writer [[Jean-Yves Ferri]] and illustrator [[Didier Conrad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/italy-beckons-for-gaul-comic-heros-asterix-and-obelix/|title=Italy beckons for Gaul comic heros Asterix and Obelix|first=Franck|last=Iovene|website=www.timesofisrael.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tabary similarly began to write ''Iznogoud'' himself, whereas Morris continued ''Lucky Luke'' with various other writers.

In a tribute to Goscinny, Uderzo gave his likeness to one of the characters in the 1981 ''L'Odyssée d'Astérix'' (&quot;[[Asterix and the Black Gold]]&quot;).

==Awards and honors==

'''''Clostridium botulinum''''' is a [[Gram-positive bacteria|Gram-positive]], [[Bacillus (shape)|rod-shaped]], [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]], [[endospore|spore-forming]], [[Motility|motile]] [[bacterium]] with the ability to produce the [[neurotoxin]] [[Botulinum toxin|botulinum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Peck&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Peck|first=MW|title=Biologycoat and genomic analysis of Clostridium botulinum|date=2009|volume=55|pages=183–265, 320|pmid=19573697|doi=10.1016/s0065-2911(09)05503-9|series=Advances in Microbial Physiology|isbn=978-0-12-374790-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindström&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lindström|first=M|author2=Korkeala, H|title=Laboratory diagnostics of botulism.|journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews|date=Apr 2006|volume=19|issue=2|pages=298–314|pmid=16614251|doi=10.1128/cmr.19.2.298-314.2006|pmc=1471988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The botulinum toxin can cause a severe [[Flaccid paralysis|flaccid paralytic]] disease in humans and other animals&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindström&quot; /&gt; and is the most potent toxin known to humankind, natural or synthetic, with a lethal dose of 1.3–2.1&amp;nbsp;ng/kg in humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;(2010).

''C. botulinum'' is a diverse group of [[pathogenic bacteria]] initially grouped together by their ability to produce botulinum toxin and now known as four distinct groups, ''C. botulinum'' groups I–IV, as well as some strains of ''Clostridium butyricum'' and ''Clostridium baratii'', are the bacteria responsible for producing botulinum toxin.&lt;ref name=Peck /&gt;

''C. botulinum'' is responsible for foodborne [[botulism]] (ingestion of preformed toxin), infant botulism (intestinal infection with toxin-forming ''C. botulinum''), and wound botulism (infection of a wound with ''C. botulinum'').  ''C. botulinum'' produces heat-resistant [[endospore]]s that are commonly found in soil and are able to survive under adverse conditions.&lt;ref name=Peck /&gt;

''C. botulinum'' is commonly associated with bulging [[canning (food)|canned]] food; bulging, misshapen cans are due to an internal increase in pressure caused by gas produced by the bacteria.&lt;ref name=&quot;IFAS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schneider|first1=Keith R.|last2=Silverberg|first2=Rachael|last3=Chang|first3=Alexandra|last4=Goodrich Schneider|first4=Renée M.|title=Preventing Foodborne Illness: Clostridium botulinum|url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/fs104|website=edis.ifas.ufl.edu|publisher=University of Florida IFAS Extension|accessdate=7 February 2017|language=en|date=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Microbiology==

''C. botulinum ''is a [[Gram-positive bacteria|Gram-positive]], rod-shaped, spore-forming [[bacterium]].  It is an [[obligate anaerobe]], meaning that [[oxygen]] is poisonous to the cells. However, ''C. botulinum'' tolerates traces of oxygen due to the enzyme [[superoxide dismutase]], which is an important antioxidant defense in nearly all cells exposed to oxygen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brock&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Doyle, Michael P. | title = Food Microbiology: Fundamentals and Frontiers | publisher = ASM Press| year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-55581-208-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''C. botulinum'' is only able to produce the neurotoxin during sporulation, which can only happen in an anaerobic environment.  Other bacterial species produce spores in an unfavorable growth environment to preserve the organism's viability and permit survival in a dormant state until the spores are exposed to favorable conditions.

''C. botulinum ''is divided into four distinct [[phenotypic]] groups (I-IV) and is also classified into seven [[serotype]]s (A-G) based on the [[antigenicity]] of the botulinum toxin produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peck | first1 = MW | last2 = Stringer | first2 = SC | last3 = Carter | first3 = AT. | year = 2011 | title = Clostridium botulinum in the post-genomic era | url = | journal = Food Microbiol | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 183–191 | doi = 10.1016/j.fm.2010.03.005 | pmid = 21315972 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shukla | first1 = HD | last2 = Sharma | first2 = SK. | year = 2005 | title = Clostridium botulinum: a bug with beauty and weapon | url = | journal = Crit Rev Microbiol | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 11–18 | doi = 10.1080/10408410590912952 | pmid = 15839401 | s2cid = 2855356 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Groups ===
The classification into groups is based on the ability of the organism to [[digestion|digest]] complex [[proteins]].&lt;ref&gt;L. V. Holdeman, J. B. Brooks. 1970. Variation among strains of Clostridium botulinum  and related clostridia. Protocols of the first U.S-Japan conference on Toxic Microorganisms. pp. 278–286&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. D. S. Smith, G. Hobbs. 1974. Genus III Clostridium Prazmowski 1880, 23. In R. E. Buchanan, N. E. gibbons (eds.), ''Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology'', 8th ed. William &amp; Wilkins, Baltimore. pp. 551–572. {{ISBN|978-0-683-00603-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies at the [[DNA]] and [[rRNA]] level support the subdivision of the species into groups I-IV. Most outbreaks of human [[botulism]] are caused by group I (proteolytic) or II (non-proteolytic) ''C. botulinum''. Group III organisms mainly cause diseases in animals. Group IV ''C. botulinum'' has not been shown to cause human or animal disease.

=== Botulinum toxin ===
{{Main|Botulinum toxin}}
[[Neurotoxin]] production is the unifying feature of the species. Eight types of [[toxins]] have been identified that are allocated a letter (A–H), several of which can cause disease in humans. They are resistant to degradation by enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract. This allows for ingested toxin to be absorbed from the intestines into the bloodstream.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;
However, all types of botulinum toxin are rapidly destroyed by heating to 100&amp;nbsp;°C for 15 minutes (900 seconds).
Botulinum toxin, one of the most poisonous biological substances known, is a neurotoxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. C. botulinum elaborates eight antigenically distinguishable exotoxins (A, B, C1, C2, D, E, F and G).

Most strains produce one type of [[neurotoxin]], but strains producing multiple toxins have been described. ''C. botulinum'' producing B and F toxin types have been isolated from human botulism cases in [[New Mexico]] and [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hatheway | first1 = C. L. | last2 = McCroskey | first2 = L. M. | year = 1987 | title = Examination of faeces for diagnosis of infant botulism in 336 patients | url = | journal = J. Clin.

Similarly, strains producing Ab and Af toxins have been reported.

Evidence indicates the neurotoxin genes have been the subject of [[horizontal gene transfer]], possibly from a viral ([[bacteriophage]]) source. This theory is supported by the presence of integration sites flanking the toxin in some strains of ''C. botulinum''. However, these integrations sites are degraded (except for the C and D types), indicating that the ''C. botulinum'' acquired the toxin genes quite far in the evolutionary past. Nevertheless, further transfers still happen via the plasmids and other mobile elements the genes are located on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Poulain |first1=B |last2=Popoff |first2=MR |title=Why Are Botulinum Neurotoxin-Producing Bacteria So Diverse and Botulinum Neurotoxins So Toxic? |journal=Toxins |date=11 January 2019 |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=34 |doi=10.3390/toxins11010034 |pmid=30641949|pmc=6357194 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Botulinum toxin types ====
Only [[botulinum toxin]] types A, B, E, F and H cause disease in humans.  Types A, B, and E are associated with food-borne illness, with type E specifically associated with fish products. Type C produces limber-neck in birds and type D causes botulism in other mammals.  No disease is associated with type G.&lt;ref&gt;(2013). Chapter 11.

(Eds), ''Jawetz, Melnick, &amp; Adelberg's Medical Microbiology'', 26th ed. {{ISBN|978-0-07-179031-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The &quot;gold standard&quot; for determining toxin type is a mouse bioassay, but the genes for types A, B, E, and F can now be readily differentiated using [[quantitative PCR]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Satterfield, B.

A few strains from organisms genetically identified as other ''Clostridium'' species have caused human botulism: ''C. butyricum'' has produced type E toxin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aureli | first1 = P. | last2 = Fenicia | first2 = L. | last3 = Pasolini | first3 = B. | last4 = Gianfrancesche | first4 = M. | last5 = Mccroskey | first5 = J.

====Laboratory isolation====
In the laboratory, ''C. botulinum'' is usually isolated in tryptose sulfite [[cycloserine]] (TSC) growth medium in an anaerobic environment with less than 2%  oxygen. This can be achieved by several [[Oxygen scavenger|commercial kits]] that use a chemical reaction to replace O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. ''C. botulinum'' is a [[lipase]]-positive microorganism that grows between [[pH]] of 4.8 and 7.0 and cannot use [[lactose]] as a primary carbon source, characteristics important for biochemical identification.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doyle&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Brock Biology of Microorganisms|edition=11th|editor1=Michael T. Madigan|editor2=John M. Martinko|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2005|isbn=978-0-13-144329-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''C. botulinum'' was first recognized and isolated in 1895 by [[Emile van Ermengem]] from home-cured [[ham]] implicated in a botulism outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = van Ergmengem | first1 = E. | year = 1897 | title = Über einen neuen anaeroben Bacillus und seine Beziehungen Zum Botulismus | url = | journal = Zentralbl. Hyg. Infektionskr | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 1–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The isolate was originally named ''Bacillus botulinus'', after the Latin word for sausage, ''botulus''. (&quot;Sausage poisoning&quot; was a common problem in 18th- and 19th-century Germany, and was most likely caused by botulism.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Erbguth | first1 = Frank J. | title = Historical notes on botulism, Clostridium botulinum, botulinum toxin, and the idea of the therapeutic use of the toxin | url = | journal = Movement Disorders | volume = 19 | issue = S8| pages = S2–S6 | doi = 10.1002/mds.20003 | pmid = 15027048 | date = March 2004 | s2cid = 8190807 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, isolates from subsequent outbreaks were always found to be [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] spore formers, so [[Ida A. Bengtson]] proposed that the organism be placed into the genus ''Clostridium'', as the genus ''[[Bacillus]]'' was restricted to [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] spore-forming rods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bengston | first1 = I. A. | year = 1924 | title = Studies on organisms concerned as causative factors in botulism | url = | journal = Hyg. Lab. Bull. | volume = 136 | issue = | page = 101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1959, all species producing the botulinum neurotoxins (types A-G) have been designated ''C. botulinum''. Substantial phenotypic and [[genotypic]] evidence exists to demonstrate [[heterogeneity]] within the [[species]]. This has led to the reclassification of ''C. botulinum'' type G strains as a new species, ''C. argentinense''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Suen | first1 = J.

==Pathology==

Botulism poisoning can occur due to preserved or home-canned, low-acid food that was not processed using correct preservation times and/or pressure.

'''Foodborne botulism'''
&quot;Signs and symptoms of foodborne botulism typically begin between 18 and 36 hours after the toxin gets into your body, but can range from a few hours to several days, depending on the amount of toxin ingested.&quot;&lt;ref name=mayosymptoms&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/botulism/basics/symptoms/con-20025875 |title=Botulism Symptoms |publisher=[[Mayo Clinic]] |date=June 13, 2015 |accessdate=January 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Double vision
* Blurred vision
* Dropping eyelids
* Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps
* Slurred speech
* Trouble breathing
* Difficulty in swallowing
* Dry mouth
* Muscle weakness
* Constipation
* Reduced or absent deep tendon reactions, such as in the knee.

'''Wound botulism'''
Most people who develop wound botulism inject drugs several times a day, so it's difficult to determine how long it takes for signs and symptoms to develop after the toxin enters the body. Most common in people who inject black tar heroin, wound botulism signs and symptoms include:&lt;ref  name=mayosymptoms/&gt;

* Difficulty swallowing or speaking
* Facial weakness on both sides of the face
* Blurred or double vision
* Dropping eyelids
* Trouble breathing
* Paralysis

'''Infant botulism'''
If infant botulism is related to food, such as honey, problems generally begin within 18 to 36 hours after the toxin enters the baby's body. Signs and symptoms include:

* Constipation (often the first sign)
* Floppy movements due to muscle weakness and trouble controlling the head
* Weak cry
* Irritability
* Drooling
* Dropping eyelids
* Tiredness
* Difficulty sucking or feeding
* Paralysis&lt;ref name=mayosymptoms/&gt;

'''Beneficial effects of botulinum toxin:'''
Purified botulinum toxin is diluted by a physician for treatment:
* Congenital pelvic tilt
* Spasmodic dysphasia (the inability of the muscles of the larynx)
* Achalasia (esophageal stricture)
* Strabismus (crossed eyes)
* Paralysis of the facial muscles
* Failure of the cervix
* Blinking frequently
* Anti-cancer drug delivery&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnon SS 2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Arnon SS, Schechter R, Inglesby TV, Henderson DA, Bartlett JG, Ascher MS, Eitzen E, Fine AD, Hauer J, Layton M, Lillibridge S, Osterholm MT, O'Toole T, Parker G, Perl TM, Russell PK, Swerdlow DL, Tonat K |title=Botulinum toxin as a biological weapon: medical and public health management |journal=JAMA |volume=285 |issue=8 |pages=1059–1070 |year=2001 |pmid=11209178 |doi=10.1001/jama.285.8.1059 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adult intestinal toxemia:'''
A very rare form of botulism that occurs by the same route as infant botulism but is among adults. Occurs rarely and sporadically. Signs and symptoms include:  
* Abdominal pain
* Blurred vision 
* Diarrhea
* [[Dysarthria]] 
* Imbalance 
* Weakness in arms and hand area

==''C. botulinum'' in different geographical locations==
A number of [[Numerical data|quantitative]] [[Statistical survey|surveys]] for ''C. botulinum'' [[spores]] in the environment have suggested a prevalence of specific toxin types in given geographic areas, which remain unexplained.

===North America===
Type A ''C. botulinum'' predominates the [[soil]] samples from the western regions, while type B is the major type found in eastern areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hauschild&quot;&gt;A. H. W. Hauschild. 1989. Clostridium botulinum. In M. P. Doyle (ed.), Food-borne Bacterial Pathogens. Marcel Dekker, New York. pp. 111–189&lt;/ref&gt; The type-B organisms were of the proteolytic type I. [[Sediments]] from the [[Great Lakes|Great Lake]]s region were surveyed after outbreaks of botulism among commercially reared [[fish]], and only type E spores were detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bott | first1 = T.

===Europe===
''C. botulinum'' type E is prevalent in aquatic sediments in Norway and Sweden,&lt;ref&gt;A. Johannsen. 1963. Clostridium botulinum  in Sweden and the adjacent waters. J. Appl. Bacteriol. 26:43–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huss | first1 = H. H. | year = 1980 | title = Distribution of Clostridium botulinum | journal = Appl. Environ.

As the land dried, the level of type E decreased and type B became dominant.

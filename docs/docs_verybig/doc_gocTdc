'''Glenn Hughes''' (born 21 August 1951) is an English bassist and singer, best known for playing bass and performing vocals for [[funk rock]] band [[Trapeze (band)|Trapeze]], the [[List of Deep Purple band members|Mk. III and IV line-ups]] of [[Deep Purple]],&lt;ref name=dpbio/&gt; as well as briefly fronting [[Black Sabbath]] in the mid-1980s. He is known by fans as &quot;The Voice of Rock&quot; due to his soulful and wide-ranging singing voice.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

In addition to being an active session musician, Hughes also maintains a notable solo career. He currently fronts the supergroups [[Black Country Communion]] and [[The Dead Daisies]], and fronted [[California Breed]] from 2013 to 2015. On 8 April 2016, Hughes was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of Deep Purple.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

==Early life==

Hughes was born in [[Cannock]], [[Staffordshire]], England, on 21 August 1951. He fronted [[Finders Keepers (band)|Finders Keepers]] in the 1960s as bassist/vocalist, as well as the British [[funk rock]] band [[Trapeze (band)|Trapeze]].&lt;ref name=amg/&gt; Hughes was recruited to replace [[Roger Glover]] as bassist in [[Deep Purple]] in 1973, though he considered himself more a vocalist than a bassist. He was reportedly uninterested in the Deep Purple job until some of the other members proposed that [[Paul Rodgers]] of [[Free (band)|Free]] be brought in as co-lead vocalist.&lt;ref name=&quot;HughesInterview&quot;/&gt;

Although the recruitment of Rodgers fell through, Hughes had now become interested in the &quot;two-lead-singer thing&quot;, and [[David Coverdale]] was later hired as [[Deep Purple]]'s lead vocalist.&lt;ref name=&quot;HughesInterview&quot;/&gt; The two would ultimately share lead vocal duties in the band for the next three albums, until the break-up of Deep Purple in 1976. Battling a severe [[cocaine]] addiction,&lt;ref name=film/&gt;&lt;ref name=nme/&gt; Hughes embarked on a solo career following his departure from the group, releasing his first solo album in 1977 called ''[[Play Me Out (Glenn Hughes album)|Play Me Out]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

== Career ==

===Hughes and Thrall===

In 1982, he joined with ex-[[Pat Travers]] guitarist [[Pat Thrall]] to form [[Hughes/Thrall]], and they released one [[Hughes/Thrall (album)|self-titled album]] which went virtually unnoticed at the time. Part of the reason for the album's obscurity was the inability to support it with a proper tour due to both parties suffering from drug addiction. As Hughes stated in a 2007 interview, &quot;The Hughes-Thrall album was a brilliant, brilliant album, but we only did 17 shows because we were too loaded.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HughesInterview&quot; /&gt;

===Gary Moore, Black Sabbath and ongoing health problems===

In the mid-1980s, Hughes recorded several different albums with bands and artists including [[Phenomena (band)|Phenomena]] (''Phenomena'', ''[[Phenomena II]]: Dream Runner''), [[Gary Moore]] (''[[Run for Cover (Gary Moore album)|Run for Cover]]''), and [[Black Sabbath]] (''[[Seventh Star]]''; originally a solo album by Sabbath guitarist [[Tony Iommi]] that was released as a Sabbath album due to record label pressure).&lt;ref name=ug/&gt;

Hughes' health problems due to overeating, drugs and alcohol began to seriously affect his musical projects and this contributed to very short stints with Gary Moore and Tony Iommi, as Hughes was unable to tour with them properly due to his bad health. In 1985 Black Sabbath reunited with original vocalist [[Ozzy Osbourne]] for their one-off [[Live Aid]] performance. While waiting for a break in Osbournes' career, Iommi decided to record a solo album and Hughes was brought in to provide the vocals. Due to the aforementioned contractual obligations with the record company, the album was released to generally positive critical reviews in 1986 as [[Seventh Star|''Black Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi'']]. While touring to promote the new album, Glenn was replaced by vocalist [[Ray Gillen]] after just six shows due to both injury from a confrontation with Black Sabbath's production manager John Downing that contributed to a degradation in his voice and his not being in good physical shape to complete the tour.&lt;ref name=dptree/&gt;

===Health recovery and career rejuvenation===

{{BLP unsourced section|date=May 2017}}
[[File:Glenn Hughes - 2011.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Hughes with his band Black Country Communion at Azkena rock festival, Spain, 2011]]
At the end of the decade, Hughes' realised his ongoing drug problem was derailing him and a clean, sober and fully rejuvenated Hughes returned by 1991 with the vocal for the hit &quot;[[What Time Is Love?|America: What Time Is Love?]]&quot; with [[The KLF|KLF]].  He also recorded all the vocals for former [[Europe (band)|Europe]] guitarist [[John Norum]]'s solo album ''[[Face the Truth (John Norum album)|Face the Truth]]''. He then re-embarked on a solo career that has been his primary focus to date. In 1999, Hughes did a short tribute tour to [[Tommy Bolin]] in Texas, with Tommy's brother Johnnie (of [[Black Oak Arkansas]]) on drums.

In 2005 Hughes released ''[[Soul Mover]]'' supporting it with a European tour.  He also collaborated with [[Black Sabbath]] guitarist [[Tony Iommi]] on the 2005 album ''[[Fused (Tony Iommi album)|Fused]]''. Hughes then released ''[[Music for the Divine]]'' in 2006, which featured [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] members [[Chad Smith]] and [[John Frusciante]]. Hughes toured in support of the album throughout Europe in autumn 2006.

''Live in Australia'', an acoustic CD and companion DVD of a performance at Sydney's famous &quot;Basement&quot; club was released via [[Edel Records]] on 17 November 2007. The album ''[[First Underground Nuclear Kitchen]]'' was released on 9 May 2008 in Europe and on 12 May in the rest of the world.

In 2009, Hughes formed [[Black Country Communion]] with [[Jason Bonham]] (drums), [[Joe Bonamassa]] (guitar) and [[Derek Sherinian]] (keyboards).  The band released three albums through 2012 and disbanded in March 2013 following the departure of guitarist Bonamassa. [[Black Country Communion]] reunited in 2016 and released a fourth album in 2017.

In July 2010 Hughes appeared as a guest vocalist (together with singer [[Jørn Lande]]) fronting Heaven &amp; Hell at the High Voltage Rock Festival in London as a tribute to the late [[Ronnie James Dio]].

===Autobiography===

Hughes' autobiography was published in May 2011 by British specialist limited edition publishers Foruli. The book, titled ''Deep Purple and Beyond: Scenes from the Life of a Rock Star'', was co-written with author [[Joel McIver]]&lt;ref name=&quot;roadrunner&quot; /&gt; and featured contributions by [[Tony Iommi]], [[David Coverdale]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], and [[Tom Morello]], as well as a foreword by [[Lars Ulrich]] of [[Metallica]]. An extended paperback edition, retitled ''Glenn Hughes: The Autobiography'', was published in late 2011 by Jawbone Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glennhughes.com/biography.html|title=g l e n n h u g h e s . c o m|last=Lab|first=Avalon Media|website=www.glennhughes.com|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other projects===
In 2003 Hughes made a guest appearance in the metal opera project &quot;AINA&quot;, alongside other guest vocalists like Michael Kiske, Tobias Sammet, Andre Matos, and Simone Simons in the debut album &quot;Days of Rising Doom&quot;.
On 13 September 2012, Hughes and [[Derek Sherinian]] met [[Bako Sahakyan]], the president of the breakaway [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]] and organised a concert in [[Stepanakert]].&lt;ref name=&quot;slaq&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;max&quot; /&gt;
In 2013, Hughes made a special guest appearance on the debut, self-titled album from [[Device (metal band)|Device]]. Hughes is featured on the song &quot;Through It All&quot; accompanying [[David Draiman]] on vocals.&lt;ref name=&quot;devicereview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Childers|first1=Chad|url=http://loudwire.com/device-album-review/ |title=Device, 'Device' – Album Review |publisher=Loudwire.com |date=2013-04-12 |accessdate=2013-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kings of Chaos and California Breed===

Hughes has been touring as a member of [[Kings of Chaos (band)|Kings of Chaos]], at lead vocals, backing vocals and acoustic guitars, since early 2013. In late 2013 he formed a new band called [[California Breed]] with drummer [[Jason Bonham]] and guitarist [[Andrew Watt (musician)|Andrew Watt]]. The group released one self-titled album in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classicrock.teamrock.com/news/2015-01-16/california-breed-are-no-more |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150116154439/http://classicrock.teamrock.com/news/2015-01-16/california-breed-are-no-more |archivedate=16 January 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; California Breed announced in 2015 that they had broken up. 

===Glenn Hughes solo tour===

During 2015, Hughes undertook a solo world tour, featuring guitarist [[Doug Aldrich]] and drummer Pontus Engborg.&lt;ref name=tour/&gt;&lt;ref name=msf2/&gt;

==History==

Cingulotomy was introduced in the 1940s as an alternative to [[lobotomy|standard prefrontal leucotomy/lobotomy]] in the hope of alleviating  symptoms of mental illness whilst reducing the undesirable effects of the standard operation (personality changes, etc.). It was suggested by American physiologist John Farquhar Fulton who, at a meeting of the Society of British Neurosurgeons in 1947, said &quot;were it feasible, cingulectomy in man would seem an appropriate place for limited leucotomy&quot;. This was derived from the hypothesis of [[James Papez]] who thought that the cingulum was a major component of an anatomic circuit believed to play a significant role in emotion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corkin&quot;&gt;S Corkin (1980) A prospective study of cingulotomy. In ES Valenstein (ed) ''The psychosurgery debate: scientific, legal, and ethical perspectives''. San Francisco, WH Freeman and Co: 164-204&lt;/ref&gt; The first reports of the use of cingulotomy on psychiatric patients came from J le Beau in Paris, [[Hugh Cairns (surgeon)|Hugh Cairns]] in Oxford, and Kenneth Livingston in Oregon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corkin&quot;/&gt;

==Target==
Bilateral cingulotomy targets the [[anterior cingulate cortex]], which is a part of the [[limbic system]]. This system is responsible for the integration of feelings and emotion in the human [[cortex (anatomy)|cortex]]. It consists of the [[cingulate gyrus]], [[parahippocampal gyrus]], [[amygdala]] and the [[hippocampal formation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kandel&quot;&gt;Kandel E., Schwartz J., Jessel T., .. (2000). Principles of Neural Science.4th edition, McGraw-Hill, New York, 853-857.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in patients that were a subject to bilateral cingulotomy, that involved [[fMRI]] analyses, showed that the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] has a key role in [[cognitive]] control and is highly likely to be involved in the control of attentional response, whereas the [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal]] part of that region of the brain was not identified to be involved in such a process, although this is still under dispute.&lt;ref name=&quot; Davis&quot;&gt;Davis et al.. (2000).  Human anterior cingulate cortex neurons modulated by attention-demanding tasks.  Journal of Neurophysiology, 83(6), 3575-2577.&lt;/ref&gt; The function of the dorsal part of the cingulate cortex was connected to the sorting out and processing of conflicting information signals. In addition, [[neuroimaging]] studies also indicated that the anterior cingulate cortex participates in the modulation of [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] regions that are of higher order as well as sensory processing areas.&lt;ref name=&quot; Menon&quot;&gt;Crottaz-Herbette S., Menon V.. (2006).  Where and when the anterior cingulate cortex modulates attentional response: combined fMRI and ERP evidence.  Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 18(5), 766-780.&lt;/ref&gt;

These findings have also been confirmed by [[stereotactic]] [[microelectrode]] analysis of single cortical [[neurons]] in a study, which involved nine patients undergoing bilateral cingulotomy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis&quot;/&gt; The study investigated the effect of performing attention demanding tasks on the activity of 36 neurons located in the [[anterior cingulate cortex]]. Upon analyzing of the results of the study it was concluded that the anterior cingulate cortex is indeed involved in the modification of [[cognitive]] tasks that require attention based on the fact that there was a change in the basal firing rate of neurons in that region during simulation of such tasks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis&quot;/&gt;

Neuroimaging also uncovered different sub-regions in the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] itself based on their function. These studies showed that the [[Caudal (anatomical term)|caudal]] part of the anterior cingulate cortex plays a more important function in cognitive activities that involve attention, salience, interference and response competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Menon&quot;/&gt; These results combined with [[electrophysiological]] investigation of the function of neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex have provided insights that can be used in the improvement of cingulotomy performed on patients treated for [[OCD]]. The basis behind this idea is the fact that a variation of certain tasks, Emotional Stroop tasks (ES), which have been particularly identified as exerting effects in [[OCD]] patients activate neurons in the more [[Anatomical terms of location#Anterior and posterior|rostral]] part of the anterior cingulate cortex. Thus, theoretically if bilateral cingulotomy is performed in such patient in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, better results should be obtained.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Menon&quot;/&gt;

Moreover, [[OCD]] has been associated with a malformation of the [[basal ganglia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jessel&quot;&gt;Kandel E., Schwartz J., Jessel T., .. (2000). Principles of Neural Science.4th edition, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1223-1224.&lt;/ref&gt; The function of this part of the human brain has been mapped to be composed of fiber tracks associated with numerous parallel cortico-striato-thalamocortical circuits (CSTC), which are involved in sensorimotor, [[motor system|motor]], [[oculomotor]] as well as the [[cognitive]] processes that are manifested by the [[limbic system]].&lt;ref name=&quot; Leckman &quot;&gt;Leckman. (2000). Tic Disorder.  Neuropsychopharmacology: The Fifth Generation of Progress&lt;/ref&gt; This pathway involves [[GABAergic]] [[inhibitory]] projections that serve as one of the means of communication between the different structures involved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jessel&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Leckman&quot;/&gt; It has been hypothesized that some forms of OCD are a result of disinhibition of one or several of the circuits that operate in the CSTC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leckman&quot;/&gt;  This is also indicated by a finding that showed a significant decrease in intracortical [[:wikt:inhibit|inhibition]] in OCD patients.&lt;ref name=&quot; Greenberg&quot;&gt;Greenberg.(2000).Altered Cortical excitability in obsessive-compulsive disorder. Neurology, (54), 142&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[lesions]] in the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] might contribute to the lessening of the disinhibition effect. This theory has been confirmed by another study which assessed the [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] inhibitory and excitatory mechanisms in OCD.&lt;ref name=&quot; Greenberg&quot;/&gt; The study measured the excitability of [[motor cortex]], as well as intracortical inhibition in OCD patients and a control of healthy individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenberg&quot;/&gt; The results showed a significant decrease in intracortical inhibition, which resulted in a slowdown of interstimulus intervals by 3&amp;nbsp;ms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenberg&quot;/&gt;
In addition to its proximity to and association with the limbic system and the [[amygdala]] in particular, which plays a key role in emotional experience, the anterior cingulate cortex shares [[afferent nerve fiber|afferent]] and [[efferent nerve fiber|efferent]] pathways with a number of [[thalamic nuclei]] as well as the [[posterior cingulate]] and part of some [[parietal lobe|parietal]], [[frontal lobe|frontal]] and supplementary motor cortex.&lt;ref name=&quot; Cohen&quot;&gt;Cohen et al. (1999). Alteration of Intention and Self-Initiated Action Associated With Bilateral Anterior Cingulotomy. J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci, (11), 444-453142&lt;/ref&gt; All these underline the high likelihood that the anterior cingulate cortex must be linked to OCD.

Functional [[MRI]] analyses of the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] have also led to the introduction of bilateral cingulotomy for the treatment of [[chronic pain]]. Such application was introduced since the anterior cingulate cortex has been found to be related to the processing [[nociceptive]] information input. In particular, the role of the anterior cingulate cortex is in the interpretation of how a [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] affects a person rather than its actual physical intensity.&lt;ref name=&quot; Lenz&quot;&gt;Lenz et al. (1998). Painful stimuli evoke potentials recorded from parasylvian cortex in humans. Journal of Neurophysiology, 80(4), 2077-2078&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot; Rolls&quot;&gt;Rolls et al. (2003). Representations of Pleasant and Painful Touch in the Human Orbitofrontal and Cingulate Cortices. Cerebral Cortex, 13(3), 308-317&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
A book published in 1992 described how the operation was carried out at that time. In most cases the procedure started with the medical team taking a number of [[X-ray computed tomography|CT]] scan [[X-ray]] images of the brain of the patient. This step ensured that the exact target, the [[cingulate cortex]] was mapped out, so that the surgeon could identify it. Then burr holes are created in the patient's [[human skull|skull]] using a drill. [[Lesions]] at the targeted tissue were made with the help of fine [[electrodes]] inserted at the right angle into the subject's brain based on plotting charts and making sure important [[arteries]] and [[blood vessels]] were intact. The electrode was placed in a [[Endoscope|probe]], or a holder, with only its tip projecting. Upon the correct insertion of the holder into the brain tissue, air was injected and more scan images were taken. Then, after the medical team had made sure they were on the right track, the tip of the electrode was advanced to the plane of the [[cingulate]] where it was heated to 75-90&amp;nbsp;°C. Once the first lesion was created it served as a center around which several other [[lesions]] were created.  In order to confirm whether lesions are made at the right place, [[Magnetic resonance imaging|scan]] images were taken postoperatively and analyzed.&lt;ref name=&quot; Rodgers&quot;&gt;Joann Rodgers. (1992).Psychosurgery: Damaging the Brain to Save the Mind, HarperCollins, New York, 350-378, {{ISBN|0-06-016405-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent technological advances, however, have made bilateral cingulotomy a more precise operation. For example, nowadays a [[neurosurgical]] team that performs the procedure can use an [[MRI]] to identify the location of the [[anterior]] and [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] [[commissure]]s. This approach allows neurosurgeons to obtain a number of [[Coronal plane|coronal]] images, which are then used to calculate the [[stereotactic]] coordinates of the place in the [[anterior cingulate cortex]], where lesions need to be created. Moreover, the MRI enables to differentiate more precisely the cell composition, and thus easily identify the [[gray matter]] in that region. This can then be further confirmed with the help of microelectrode recordings.&lt;ref name=&quot; Richter&quot;&gt;Richter et al. (2004). Cingulotomy for Psychiatric Disease: Microelectrode Guidance, a Callosal Reference System for Documenting Lesion Location, and Clinical Results, 54(3), 622-630&lt;/ref&gt;

==Side effects==
Patients usually recover from this operation over a period of four days.  However, there are cases of subjects released from hospital after as few as 48 hours after the operation. The mild shorter postoperative complications that are most commonly related to bilateral cingulotomy are typical of head interventions and include but are not limited to [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], and [[headaches]]. However, in some cases, patients exhibit [[seizures]] that sometimes appear up to two months after the surgical intervention.  It has been questioned whether this is relevant and can be attributed to cingulotomy because such seizures were observed in patients that already had a history of this condition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dougherty&quot;/&gt;

==Case studies==
A 2002 study conducted at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] analyzed the outcome of bilateral cingulotomy in 44 patients for the treatment of [[OCD]] in the period between 1965 and 1986. Patients were followed up over a long term and evaluated based on several criteria: 1) how many of them were responders after a period of six months, 2) how many cingulotomies a patient had undergone before the examination of the effectiveness of the procedure, 3) whether the patient showed any significant change after the most recent procedure, and 4) what the side effects related to the procedure were.&lt;ref name = &quot;Dougherty&quot;/&gt;

The follow-up of the patients produced contradictory results, which indicated that bilateral cingulotomy is not the optimal treatment for OCD.&lt;ref name = &quot;Dougherty&quot;/&gt; Of the 44 patients, only 32% both fit the &quot;responder&quot; criteria and showed significant improvement compared to the other subjects. Another 14% exhibited some signs of improvement. Multiple cingulotomies correlated with a higher likelihood of continuing to respond to follow-up inquiries (6% more often fit the full &quot;responder&quot; criteria, 11% more often fit the partial &quot;responder&quot; criteria. However, the side effects associated with the procedure were numerous. Among the complaints that patients had after the surgery were [[apathy]] and deficits in memory, although these were rarely reported. In addition, some subjects complained of some form of [[urinary]] disturbance, ranging from [[urinary retention]] to [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]]. [[Hydrocephalus]] (2%) and seizures (2%) were also observed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dougherty&quot;&gt;Dougherty et al. (2002). Prospective Long-Term Follow-Up of 44 Patients Who Received Cingulotomy for Treatment-Refractory Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, 159(2), 269-275&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1927, Barthelmess became engaged to Katherine Young Wilson, a Broadway actress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibdb.com/person.php?id=65239 Katherine Wilson's profile at IBDb]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19270824&amp;id=wJ0hAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zZkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4751,4434083 Barthelmess and Wilson's wedding announcement in ''The Reading Eagle'', August 24, 1927 (accessed 5 December 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the engagement was called off due to Wilson's stated desire to continue acting,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cBtbBAAAQBAJ&amp;q=richard+barthelmess+katherine+young+wilson&amp;pg=PT172|title=Bringing Up Oscar: The Story of the Men and Women Who Founded the Academy|last=Pawlak|first=Debra Ann|date=2012-01-12|publisher=Pegasus Books|isbn=978-1-60598-216-8|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; or possibly his affair around this time with the journalist [[Adela Rogers St. Johns]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott Eyman, ''The Speed of Sound,''1999, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''writer''' is a person who uses [[writing|written words]] in different styles and techniques to communicate ideas. Writers produce different forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, books, poetry, plays, screenplays, 
teleplays, songs, and essays as well as other [[report]]s and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express [[idea]]s well, often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Magill |first1=Frank N.|title=Cyclopedia of World Authors|edition=revised  |volume=vols. I, II, III |year=1974 |publisher=Salem Press |location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey |isbn= |pages=1â€“1973}} [A compilation of the bibliographies and short biographies of notable authors up to 1974.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;writer&quot; is also used elsewhere in the arts and music â€“ such as songwriter or a screenwriter â€“ but as a standalone &quot;writer&quot; normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an [[oral tradition]].

Writers can produce material across a number of genres, fictional or non-fictional. Other writers use multiple media â€“ for example, graphics or illustration â€“ to enhance the communication of their ideas. Another recent demand has been created by civil and government readers for the work of non-fictional technical writers, whose skills create understandable, interpretive documents of a practical or scientific kind. Some writers may use [[image]]s (drawing, painting, graphics) or [[multimedia]] to augment their writing. In rare instances, creative writers are able to communicate their ideas via music as well as words.&lt;ref&gt;Nobel prize winner [[Rabindranath Tagore]] is an example.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as producing their own written works, writers often write on ''how'' they write (that is, the process they use);&lt;ref name=Nicolson1&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicolson|first=Adam|title=When God Spoke English: The Making of the King James Bible|year=2011|publisher=Harper Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-00-743100-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''why'' they write (that is, their motivation);&lt;ref name=Blythe&gt;See, for example, {{cite book|title=Why I write: thoughts on the practice of fiction|year=c. 1998|publisher=Little, Brown|location=Boston|isbn=0316102296|editor=Will Blythe|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/whyiwritethought0000unse}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also comment on the work of other writers (criticism).&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Franzen]], for example, criticised [[John Updike]] for being &quot;exquisitely preoccupied with his own literary digestive processes ...&quot; and his &quot;lack of interest in the bigger postwar, postmodern, socio-technological picture&quot; {{cite journal|last=Franzen|first=Jonathan|title=Franzen on Kraus: Footnote 89|journal=The Paris Review|date=6 September 2013|issue=206|url=https://medium.com/slush-pile/franzen-on-kraus-footnote-89-92335fb9c2e?postPublishedType=initial|accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers work professionally or non-professionally, that is, for payment or without payment and may be paid either in advance (or on acceptance), or only after their work is published. Payment is only one of the motivations of writers and many are not paid for their work.

The term ''writer'' is often used as a synonym of ''author'', although the latter term has a somewhat broader meaning and is used to convey legal responsibility for a piece of writing, even if its composition is anonymous, unknown or collaborative.

Writers choose from a range of [[literary genre]]s to express their ideas. Most writing can be adapted for use in another medium. For example, a writer's work may be read privately or recited or performed in a play or film. Satire for example, may be written as a poem, an essay, a film, a comic play, or a part of journalism. The writer of a letter may include elements of criticism, biography, or journalism.

Many writers work across genres. The genre sets the parameters but all kinds of creative adaptation have been attempted: novel to film; poem to play; history to musical. Writers may begin their career in one genre and change to another. For example, historian [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]] began in the genre of [[travel literature]] and also writes as a journalist. Many writers have produced both fiction and non-fiction works and others write in a genre that crosses the two. For example, writers of [[historical romance]]s, such as [[Georgette Heyer]], create characters and stories set in historical periods. In this genre, the accuracy of the history and the level of factual detail in the work both tend to be debated. Some writers write both creative fiction and serious analysis, sometimes using other names to separate their work. [[Dorothy L. Sayers|Dorothy Sayers]], for example, wrote crime fiction but was also a playwright, essayist, translator, and critic.

&lt;poem&gt; '''I Will Write'''&lt;br /&gt;
He had done for her all that a man could,
And some might say, more than a man should,
Then was ever a flame so recklessly blown out
Or a last goodbye so negligent as this?
â€˜I will write to you,' she muttered briefly,
Tilting her cheek for a polite kiss;
Then walked away, nor ever turned about.  ...

Long letters written and mailed in her own head â€“
There are no mails in a city of the dead.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/poem&gt;
}}
Poets make maximum use of the language to achieve an emotional and sensory effect as well as a cognitive one. To create these effects, they use [[rhyme]] and rhythm and they also apply the properties of words with a range of other techniques such as [[alliteration]] and [[assonance]]. A common topic is love and its vicissitudes. [[Shakespeare]]'s best-known love story ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', for example, written in a variety of poetic forms, has been performed in innumerable theaters and made into at least eight cinematic versions.&lt;ref&gt;1936, 1954, 1955, 1966, 1968, 1978, 2013, 2014. [https://www.imdb.com/find?q=Romeo+and+Juliet&amp;s=all IMDb listing.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Donne]] is another poet renowned for his love poetry.

====Novelist====
{{Main|Novelist}}

Novelists write novels â€“ stories that explore many topics, both fiction and nonfiction. They create characters and plots in a narrative designed to be both credible and entertaining.
{{Quotation|''Every novel worthy of the name is like another planet, whether large or small, which has its own laws just as it has its own flora and fauna. Thus, [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]]'s technique is certainly the best one with which to paint Faulkner's world, and [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]]'s nightmare has produced its own myths that make it communicable. [[Benjamin Constant]], [[Stendhal]], [[EugÃ¨ne Fromentin]], [[Jacques RiviÃ¨re]], [[Raymond Radiguet|Radiguet]], all used different techniques, took different liberties, and set themselves different tasks.''&lt;br /&gt;[[FranÃ§ois Mauriac]], novelist&lt;ref name=&quot;Le Marchand&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Le Marchand|first=Jean|title=Interviews: FranÃ§ois Mauriac, The Art of Fiction No. 2|journal=The Paris Review|date=Summer 1953|issue= 2|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5197/the-art-of-fiction-no-2-franois-mauriac|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Satirist====
{{Main|Satire}}

A satirist uses wit to ridicule the shortcomings of society or individuals, with the intent of revealing stupidity. Usually, the subject of the satire is a contemporary issue such as ineffective political decisions or politicians, although human vices such as [[greed]] are also a common and prevalent subject. Philosopher [[Voltaire]] wrote a satire about optimism called ''[[Candide]]'', which was subsequently turned into an opera, and many well known lyricists wrote for it. There are elements of [[Absurdism]] in ''Candide'', just as there are in the work of contemporary satirist [[Barry Humphries]], who writes comic satire for his character [[Dame Edna Everage]] to perform on stage.

Satirists use different techniques such as [[irony]], [[sarcasm]], and [[hyperbole]] to make their point and they choose from the full range of genres â€“ the satire may be in the form of prose or poetry or dialogue in a film, for example. One of the most well-known satirists is [[Jonathan Swift]] who wrote the four-volume work ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and many other satires, including ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'' and ''[[The Battle of the Books]]''.

{{Quotation|''It is amazing to me that ... our age is almost wholly illiterate and has hardly produced one writer upon any subject.''&lt;br /&gt;[[Jonathan Swift]], satirist (1704)&lt;ref&gt;The Epistle Dedicatory of ''[[A Tale of a Tub]]''. For text at Wikisource, see [[s:A Tale of a Tub|''A Tale of a Tub'']]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Short story writer====
{{Main|Short story}}
A short story writer is a writer of short stories, works of fiction that can be read in a single sitting.

===Performative===
====Librettist====
[[File:Wagner Luzern 1868.jpg|thumb|Composer [[Richard Wagner]], who also wrote the libretti for his works]]
{{Main|Libretto}}
Libretti (the plural of libretto) are the texts for musical works such as operas. The Venetian poet and librettist [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]], for example, wrote the libretto for some of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s greatest operas. [[Luigi Illica]] and [[Giuseppe Giacosa]] were Italian librettists who wrote for [[Giacomo Puccini]]. Most opera composers collaborate with a librettist but unusually, [[Richard Wagner]] wrote both the music and the libretti for his works himself.
{{Quotation|''Chi son? Sono poeta. Che cosa faccio? Scrivo. E come vivo? Vivo.''
(&quot;Who am I? I'm a poet. What do I do? I write. And how do I live? I live.&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;Rodolpho, in [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s ''[[La bohÃ¨me]]''&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt of Rodolpho's aria in Act I of ''[[La bohÃ¨me]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Lyricist====
{{Main|Lyricist}}
Usually writing in verses and choruses, a lyricist specializes in writing [[lyrics]], the words that accompany or underscore a song or opera. Lyricists also write the words for songs. In the case of [[Tom Lehrer]], these were satirical. Lyricist [[NoÃ«l Coward]], who wrote musicals and songs such as &quot;[[Mad Dogs and Englishmen (song)|Mad Dogs and Englishmen]]&quot; and the recited song &quot;[[I Went to a Marvellous Party]]&quot;, also wrote plays and films and performed on stage and screen as well. Writers of lyrics, such as these two, adapt other writers' work as well as create entirely original parts.

====Playwright====

{{Main|Playwright}}

A playwright writes plays which may or may not be performed on a stage by actors. A play's narrative is driven by dialogue. Like novelists, playwrights usually explore a theme by showing how people respond to a set of circumstances. As writers, playwrights must make the language and the dialogue succeed in terms of the characters who speak the lines as well as in the play as a whole. Since most plays are performed, rather than read privately, the playwright has to produce a text that works in spoken form and can also hold an audience's attention over the period of the performance. Plays tell &quot;a story the audience should care about&quot;, so writers have to cut anything that worked against that.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sydneytheatre.com.au/magazine/posts/2015/november/feature-mike-bartlett-kciii?fptd_mode=validation|title=Mike Bartlett on writing King Charles III|last=Bartlett|first=Mike|date=18 November 2015|website=Sydney Theatre Company Magazine|publisher=Sydney Theatre Company|access-date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plays may be written in prose or verse. Shakespeare wrote plays in [[iambic pentameter]] as does [[Mike Bartlett (playwright)|Mike Bartlett]] in his play ''King Charles III'' (2014).&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Playwrights also adapt or re-write other works, such as plays written earlier or literary works originally in another genre. Famous playwrights such as [[Henrik Ibsen]] or [[Anton Chekhov]] have had their works adapted several times. The plays of early Greek playwrights [[Sophocles]], [[Euripides]], and [[Aeschylus]] are still performed. Adaptations of a playwright's work may be honest to the original or creatively interpreted. If the writers' purpose in re-writing the play is to make a film, they will have to prepare a screenplay. Shakespeare's plays, for example, while still regularly performed in the original form, are often adapted and abridged, especially for the [[filmmaking|cinema]]. An example of a creative modern adaptation of a play that nonetheless used the original writer's words, is [[Baz Luhrmann]]'s version of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. The amendment of the name to ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]'' indicates to the audience that the version will be different from the original. [[Tom Stoppard]]'s play ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' is a play inspired by Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'' that takes two of Shakespeare's most minor characters and creates a new play in which they are the protagonists.

{{Quotation|'''''Player''''': ''It's what the actors do best. They have to exploit whatever talent is given to them, and their talent is dying. They can die heroically, comically, ironically, slowly, suddenly, disgustingly, charmingly or from a great height.''&lt;br /&gt;[[Tom Stoppard]], [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]] (Act Two)&lt;ref name=Stoppard&gt;{{cite book|last=Stopppard|first=Tom|title=Rosencrantz and Guildentern Are Dead|year=1967|publisher=Faber and Faber|isbn=0-571-08182-7|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Screenwriter====
{{Main|Screenwriter}}

Screenwriters write a screenplay â€“ or script â€“ that provides the words for media productions such as films, television series and video games. Screenwriters may start their careers by writing the screenplay [[Spec script|speculatively]]; that is, they write a script with no advance payment, solicitation or contract. On the other hand, they may be employed or commissioned to adapt the work of a playwright or novelist or other writer. Self-employed writers who are paid by contract to write are known as [[freelancer]]s and screenwriters often work under this type of arrangement.

Screenwriters, playwrights and other writers are inspired by the classic [[Theme (arts)|themes]] and often use similar and familiar plot devices to explore them. For example, in Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'' is a &quot;play within a play&quot;, which the hero uses to demonstrate the king's guilt. Hamlet hives the co-operation of the actors to set up the play as a thing &quot;wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark/Act 2|The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark/Act 2]]'', (Act II, Sc.2, line 609)&lt;/ref&gt; [[teleplay]] writer [[Joe Menosky]] deploys the same &quot;play within a play&quot; device in an episode of the science fiction [[Television program#Seasons/series|television series]] ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]''. The bronze-age playwright/hero enlists the support of a ''Star Trek'' crew member to create a play that will convince the ruler (or &quot;patron&quot; as he is called), of the futility of war.&lt;ref&gt;See Season 6, Episode 22: [[Muse (Star Trek: Voyager)|&quot;Muse&quot;, ''(Star Trek: Voyager)'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Speechwriter====
{{Main|Speechwriter}}
A speechwriter prepares the text for a [[Public speaking|speech]] to be given before a group or crowd on a specific occasion and for a specific purpose. They are often intended to be persuasive or inspiring, such as the speeches given by skilled orators like [[Cicero]]; charismatic or influential political leaders like [[Nelson Mandela]]; or for use in a court of law or parliament. The writer of the speech may be the person intended to deliver it, or it might be prepared by a person hired for the task on behalf of someone else. Such is the case when speechwriters are employed by many senior-level elected officials and executives in both government and private sectors.

===Interpretive and academic===
====Biographer====
{{Main|List of biographers}}
Biographers write an account of another person's life. [[Richard Ellmann]] (1918â€“1987), for example, was an eminent and award-winning biographer whose work focused on the Irish writers [[James Joyce]], [[W. B. Yeats|William Butler Yeats]], and [[Oscar Wilde]]. For the Wilde biography, he won the 1989 [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography|Pulitzer Prize for Biography]].

====Critic====
{{Main|Critic}}
Critics consider and assess the extent to which a work succeeds in its purpose. The work under consideration may be literary, theatrical, musical, artistic, or architectural. In assessing the success of a work, the critic takes account of why it was done â€“ for example, why a text was written, for whom, in what style, and under what circumstances. After making such an assessment, critics write and publish their evaluation, adding the value of their scholarship and thinking to substantiate any opinion. The theory of criticism is an area of study in itself: a good critic understands and is able to incorporate the theory behind the work they are evaluating into their assessment.&lt;ref name=Habib&gt;For example, see {{cite book|last=Habib|first= M.A.R.|title=A History of Literary Criticism and Theory|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofliterar0000habi|url-access=registration|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=MA, USA; Oxford, UK; Victoria, Australia|isbn=978-0-631-23200-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics are already writers in another genre. For example, they might be novelists or essayists. Influential and respected writer/critics include the art critic [[Charles Baudelaire]] (1821â€“1867) and the literary critic [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]] (born 1965), both of whom have books published containing collections of their criticism. Some critics are poor writers and produce only superficial or unsubstantiated work. Hence, while anyone can be an uninformed critic, the notable characteristics of a good critic are understanding, insight, and an ability to write well.

{{Quotation|''We can claim with at least as much accuracy as a well-known writer claims of his little books, that no newspaper would dare print what we have to say. Are we going to be very cruel and abusive, then? By no means: on the contrary, we are going to be impartial. We have no friends â€“ that is a great thing â€“ and no enemies.''&lt;br /&gt;[[Charles Baudelaire]], introducing his Review of the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] of 1845&lt;ref name=Mayne&gt;{{cite book|last=Baudelaire|first=Charles|title=Baudelaire â€“ Art in Paris 1845â€“1862: Reviews of Salons and other exhibitions|year=1965|publisher=Phaidon Press|location=London|page=1|editor = Jonathan Mayne (editor and translator)|chapter=The Salon of 1845}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Editor====

An editor prepares literary material for publication. The material may be the editor's own original work but more commonly, an editor works with the material of one or more other people. There are different types of editor. [[Copy editing|Copy editors]] format text to a particular style and/or correct errors in grammar and spelling without changing the text substantively. On the other hand, an editor may suggest or undertake significant changes to a text to improve its readability, sense or structure. This latter type of editor can go so far as to excise some parts of the text, add new parts, or restructure the whole. The work of editors of ancient texts or [[manuscript]]s or collections of works results in differing editions. For example, there are many editions of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays by notable editors who also contribute original introductions to the resulting publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warner|first=Beverley Ellison|title=Famous Introductions to Shakespeare's Plays by the Notable Editors of the Eighteenth Century (1906)|date = 2012|publisher=HardPress|isbn=978-1290807081}}&lt;/ref&gt; Editors who work on journals and newspapers have varying levels of responsibility for the text â€“ they may write original material, in particular, editorials; select what is to be included from a range of items on offer; format the material; or check its accuracy.

====Encyclopaedist====

{{Main|Encyclopedia}}
Encyclopaedists create organised bodies of knowledge. [[Denis Diderot]] (1713â€“1784) is renowned for his contributions to the ''[[EncyclopÃ©die]]''. The encyclopaedist [[Bernardino de SahagÃºn]] (1499â€“1590) was a [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] whose ''Historia general de las cosas de Nueva EspaÃ±a'' is a vast encyclopedia of [[Mesoamerica]]n civilization, commonly referred to as the ''[[Florentine Codex]]'', after the Italian manuscript library which holds the best preserved copy.

====Essayist====
{{Main|List of essayists}}

Essayists write essays, which are original pieces of writing of moderate length in which the author makes a case in support of an opinion. They are usually in [[prose]], but some writers have used poetry to present their argument.

====Historian====
{{See also|List of historians}}
A historian is a person who studies and writes about the past and is regarded as an authority on it.&lt;ref name=&quot;wordnetprinceton&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=Historian |title= Historian |publisher=Wordnetweb.princeton.edu |accessdate=28 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of a historian is to employ [[Historiography|historical analysis]] to create coherent narratives that explain &quot;what happened&quot; and &quot;why or how it happened&quot;. Professional historians typically work in colleges and universities, archival centers, government agencies, museums, and as freelance writers and consultants.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Grafton and Robert B. Townsend, &quot;The Parlous Paths of the Profession&quot; [http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/issues/2008/0810/0810pro1.cfm ''Perspectives on History'' (Sept. 2008) online]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Gibbon]]'s six volume ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' influenced the development of [[historiography]].

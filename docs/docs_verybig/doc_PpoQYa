== Music ==
Some pieces of music use sound effects that are made by a musical instrument or by other means. An early example is the 18th century [[Toy Symphony]]. [[Richard Wagner]] in the opera ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' (1869) lets a choir of anvils introduce the scene of the dwarfs who have to work in the mines, similar to the introduction of the dwarfs in the 1937 Disney movie ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]]''. [[Klaus Doldinger]]s soundtrack for the 1981 movie ''[[Das Boot]]'' includes a title score with a sonar sound to reflect the U-boat setting. [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] integrated into the title song of ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' (1979) a sound representing the beep of a [[Sputnik 1|Sputnik]] like satellite.

== Recording ==
[[File:A man is recording sound effects, 1930s.jpg|thumbnail|A man recording the sound of a [[saw]] in the 1930s]]

The most realistic sound effects may originate from original sources; the closest sound to machine-gun fire could be an original recording of actual machine guns.

Despite this, real life and actual practice do not always coincide with theory. When recordings of real life do not sound realistic on playback, Foley and f/x are used to create more convincing sounds. For example, the realistic sound of bacon frying can be the crumpling of cellophane, while rain may be recorded as salt falling on a piece of tinfoil.

Less realistic sound effects are [[digital synthesizer|digitally synthesized]] or [[sampling (music)|sampled]] and sequenced (the same recording played repeatedly using a sequencer). When the producer or content creator demands high-fidelity sound effects, the [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]] usually must augment his available library with new sound effects recorded in the field.

When the required sound effect is of a small subject, such as scissors cutting, cloth ripping, or footsteps, the sound effect is best recorded in a studio, under controlled conditions a process known as [[Foley (filmmaking)|foley]]. Many sound effects cannot be recorded in a studio, such as explosions, gunfire, and automobile or aircraft maneuvers.  These effects must be recorded by a professional [[audio engineer]].

When such &quot;big&quot; sounds are required, the recordist will begin contacting professionals or technicians in the same way a producer may arrange a crew; if the recordist needs an explosion, he may contact a demolition company to see if any buildings are scheduled to be destroyed with explosives in the near future.  If the recordist requires a volley of [[cannon]] fire, he may contact [[historical re-enactors]] or gun enthusiasts.

Depending on the effect, recordists may use several [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]], [[hard disk]], or [[Nagra]] recorders and a large number of microphones.  During a [[cannon]]- and [[musket]]-fire recording session for the 2003 film ''[[The Alamo (2004 film)|The Alamo]]'', conducted by [[Jon Johnson]] and [[Charles Maynes]], two to three DAT machines were used.  One machine was stationed near the cannon itself, so it could record the actual firing.  Another was stationed several hundred yards away, below the trajectory of the ball, to record the sound of the cannonball passing by.  When the crew recorded musket-fire, a set of microphones were arrayed close to the target (in this case a [[pig|swine]] carcass) to record the musket-ball impacts.

A counter-example is the common technique for recording an automobile.  For recording &quot;Onboard&quot; car sounds (which include the car interiors), a three-[[microphone]] technique is common.  Two microphones record the engine directly: one is taped to the underside of the hood, near the engine block.  The second microphone is covered in a [[wind screen]] and tightly attached to the rear bumper, within an inch or so of the tail pipe.  The third microphone, which is often a [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] microphone, is stationed inside the car to get the car interior.

Having all of these tracks at once gives a [[sound designer]] or [[audio engineer]] a great deal of control over how he wants the car to sound.  In order to make the car more ominous or low, he can mix in more of the tailpipe recording; if he wants the car to sound like it is running full throttle, he can mix in more of the engine recording and reduce the interior perspective.  In cartoons, a pencil being dragged down a washboard may be used to simulate the sound of a sputtering engine.

What is considered today to be the first recorded sound effect was of [[Big Ben]] striking 10:30, 10:45, and 11:00. It was recorded on a brown [[wax cylinder]] by technicians at Edison House in London on July 16, 1890. This recording is currently in the public domain.

== Processing effects ==

As the car example demonstrates, the ability to make multiple simultaneous recordings of the same subject&amp;mdash;through the use of several DAT or [[multitrack recording|multitrack]] recorders&amp;mdash;has made sound recording into a sophisticated craft. The sound effect can be shaped by the [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]] or [[sound designer]], not just for realism, but for emotional effect.

Once the sound effects are recorded or captured, they are usually loaded into a [[computer]] integrated with an audio [[non-linear editing system]].  This allows a [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]] or [[sound designer]] to heavily manipulate a sound to meet his or her needs.

The most common sound design tool is the use of layering to create a new, interesting sound out of two or three old, average sounds.  For example, the sound of a bullet impact into a pig carcass may be mixed with the sound of a melon being gouged to add to the &quot;stickiness&quot; or &quot;gore&quot; of the effect.  If the effect is featured in a close-up, the designer may also add an &quot;impact sweetener&quot; from his or her library.  The sweetener may simply be the sound of a hammer pounding hardwood, [[Equalization (audio)|equalized]] so that only the low-end can be heard.  The low end gives the three sounds together added weight, so that the audience actually &quot;feels&quot; the weight of the bullet hit the victim.

If the victim is the villain, and his death is climactic, the sound designer may add [[reverberation|reverb]] to the impact, in order to enhance the dramatic beat.  And then, as the victim falls over in slow motion, the sound editor may add the sound of a broom whooshing by a microphone, pitch-shifted down and time-expanded to further emphasize the death.  If the film is science-fiction, the designer may [[phaser (effect)|phaser]] the &quot;whoosh&quot; to give it a more sci-fi feel. (For a list of many sound effects processes available to a sound designer, see the bottom of this article.)

== Aesthetics ==

When creating sound effects for films, sound recordists and editors do not generally concern themselves with the verisimilitude or accuracy of the sounds they present.  The sound of a bullet entering a person from a close distance may sound nothing like the sound designed in the above example, but since very few people are aware of how such a thing actually sounds, the job of designing the effect is mainly an issue of creating a conjectural sound which feeds the audience's expectations while still suspending disbelief.

In the previous example, the phased 'whoosh' of the victim's fall has no analogue in real life experience, but it is emotionally immediate. If a [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]] uses such sounds in the context of emotional climax or a character's subjective experience, they can add to the drama of a situation in a way visuals simply cannot.  If a [[special effects|visual effects]] artist were to do something similar to the 'whooshing fall' example, it would probably look ridiculous or at least excessively melodramatic.

The &quot;Conjectural Sound&quot; principle applies even to happenstance sounds, such as tires squealing, doorknobs turning or people walking.  If the sound editor wants to communicate that a driver is in a hurry to leave, he will cut the sound of tires squealing when the car accelerates from a stop; even if the car is on a dirt road, the effect will work if the audience is dramatically engaged.  If a character is afraid of someone on the other side of a door, the turning of the doorknob can take a second or more, and the mechanism of the knob can possess dozens of clicking parts.  A skillful [[Foley artist]] can make someone walking calmly across the screen seem terrified simply by giving the actor a different gait.

== Techniques ==

In music and film/television production, typical effects used in recording and amplified performances are:
* ''[[echo (phenomenon)|echo]]'' – to simulate the effect of reverberation in a large hall or cavern, one or several delayed signals are added to the original signal. To be perceived as echo, the delay has to be of order 35 milliseconds or above.  Short of actually playing a sound in the desired environment, the effect of echo can be implemented using either [[Analog (signal)|analog]] or [[digital delay|digital]] methods.  Analog echo effects are implemented using [[Delay (audio effect)|tape delay]]s and/or [[spring reverb]]s.  When large numbers of delayed signals are mixed over several seconds, the resulting sound has the effect of being presented in a large room, and it is more commonly called [[reverberation]] or reverb for short.
* ''[[flanging|flanger]]'' – to create an unusual sound, a delayed signal is added to the original signal with a continuously variable delay (usually smaller than 10 ms).  This effect is now done electronically using [[digital signal processing|DSP]], but originally the effect was created by playing the same recording on two synchronized tape players, and then mixing the signals together.  As long as the machines were synchronized, the mix would sound more-or-less normal, but if the operator placed his finger on the flange of one of the players (hence &quot;flanger&quot;), that machine would slow down and its signal would fall out-of-phase with its partner, producing a phasing effect.  Once the operator took his finger off, the player would speed up until its [[tachometer]] was back in phase with the master, and as this happened, the phasing effect would appear to slide up the frequency spectrum.  This phasing up-and-down the register can be performed rhythmically.
* ''[[phaser (effect)|phaser]]'' – another way of creating an unusual sound; the signal is split, a portion is [[audio filter|filtered]] with an [[all-pass filter]] to produce a phase-shift, and then the unfiltered and filtered signals are mixed. The phaser effect was originally a simpler implementation of the flanger effect since delays were difficult to implement with analog equipment.  Phasers are often used to give a &quot;synthesized&quot; or electronic effect to natural sounds, such as human speech.  The voice of [[C-3PO]] from ''[[Star Wars]]'' was created by taking the actor's voice and treating it with a phaser.
* ''[[chorus effect|chorus]]'' – a delayed signal is added to the original signal with a constant delay. The delay has to be short in order not to be perceived as echo, but above 5 ms to be audible.  If the delay is too short, it will destructively interfere with the un-delayed signal and create a [[flanging]] effect.  Often, the delayed signals will be slightly pitch shifted to more realistically convey the effect of multiple voices.
* ''[[equalization (audio)|equalization]]'' – different frequency bands are [[Attenuation|attenuated]] or boosted to produce desired spectral characteristics. Moderate use of equalization (often abbreviated as &quot;EQ&quot;) can be used to &quot;fine-tune&quot; the tone quality of a recording; extreme use of equalization, such as heavily cutting a certain frequency can create more unusual effects.
* ''[[audio filter|filtering]]'' – Equalization is a form of filtering.  In the general sense, frequency ranges can be emphasized or attenuated using [[Low-pass filter|low-pass]], [[High-pass filter|high-pass]], [[Band-pass filter|band-pass]] or [[Band-stop filter|band-stop]] filters.  Band-pass filtering of voice can simulate the effect of a telephone because telephones use band-pass filters.
* ''[[overdriven|overdrive]]'' effects such as the use of a [[Distortion (music)|fuzz box]] can be used to produce distorted sounds, such as for imitating robotic voices or to simulate distorted radiotelephone traffic (e.g., the radio chatter between starfighter pilots in the science fiction film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'').  The most basic overdrive effect involves ''clipping'' the signal when its [[absolute value]] exceeds a certain threshold.
* ''[[audio timescale-pitch modification|pitch shift]]'' – similar to pitch correction, this effect shifts a signal up or down in pitch. For example, a signal may be shifted an octave up or down.  This is usually applied to the entire signal, and not to each note separately.  One application of pitch shifting is [[pitch correction]].  Here a musical signal is tuned to the correct pitch using digital signal processing techniques.  This effect is ubiquitous in karaoke machines and is often used to assist pop singers who sing out of tune.  It is also used intentionally for aesthetic effect in such pop songs as [[Cher]]'s &quot;[[Believe (Cher song)|Believe]]&quot; and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s &quot;[[Die Another Day (song)|Die Another Day]]&quot;.
* ''[[audio timescale-pitch modification|time stretching]]'' – the opposite of pitch shift, that is, the process of changing the speed of an audio signal without affecting its pitch.
* ''[[resonators]]'' – emphasize harmonic frequency content on specified frequencies.
* ''[[robotic voice effects]]'' are used to make an actor's voice sound like a synthesized human voice.
* ''[[synthesizer]]'' – generate artificially almost any sound by either imitating natural sounds or creating completely new sounds.
* ''[[modulation]]'' – to change the frequency or amplitude of a carrier signal in relation to a predefined signal. [[ring modulator|Ring modulation]], also known as amplitude modulation, is an effect made famous by [[Doctor Who]]'s [[Dalek]]s and commonly used throughout sci-fi.
* ''[[Audio level compression|compression]]'' – the reduction of the dynamic range of a sound to avoid unintentional fluctuation in the dynamics.  Level compression is not to be confused with [[audio data compression]], where the amount of data is reduced without affecting the amplitude of the sound it represents.
* ''[[3D audio effect]]s'' – place sounds outside the stereo basis
* ''[[sound on sound (technique)|sound on sound]]'' – to record over a recording without erasing. Originally accomplished by disabling the tape erase magnet. This allowed an artist to make parts of the work sound like a duet. 
* ''[[reverse echo]]'' – a swelling effect created by reversing an audio signal and recording echo and/or delay whilst the signal runs in reverse. When played back forward the last echos are heard before the effected sound creating a rush like swell preceding and during playback.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jimmy Page]] of [[Led Zeppelin]] used this effect in the bridge of [[Whole Lotta Love]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reciprocal altruism summary.svg|thumb|upright=1.75&lt;!--fmt for very small text--&gt;|Diagram showing reciprocal altruism]]
In [[evolutionary biology]], '''reciprocal altruism''' is a behaviour whereby an organism acts in a manner that temporarily reduces its fitness while increasing another organism's fitness, with the expectation that the other organism will act in a similar manner at a later time. The concept was initially developed by [[Robert Trivers]] to explain the evolution of cooperation as instances of mutually altruistic acts. The concept is close to the strategy of &quot;[[tit for tat]]&quot; used in [[game theory]].

In 1987 Trivers told a symposium on reciprocity that he had originally submitted his article under the title &quot;The Evolution of Delayed Return Altruism&quot;, but reviewer W. D. Hamilton suggested that he change the title to &quot;The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism&quot;. Trivers changed the title, but not the examples in the manuscript, which has led to confusion about what were appropriate examples of reciprocal altruism for the  last 50 years.  In their contribution to that symposium, Rothstein and Pierotti (1988)&lt;ref name=&quot;rothstein and pierotti&quot; &gt; {{cite journal | last1 = Rothstein | first1 = S. I. | year = 1988 | title = Distinctions among reciprocal altruism and kin selection, and a model for the initial evolution of helping behavior | journal = Ethology and Sociobiology | volume = 9 |pages = 189–210 | doi = 10.1016/0162-3095(88)90021-0 }} &lt;/ref&gt;  addressed this issue and proposed new definitions concerning the topic of altruism, that clarified the issue created by Trivers and Hamilton. They proposed that Delayed Return Altruism was a superior concept and used the term pseudo-reciprocity in place of DRA. For some reason, the paper by Rothstein and Pierotti did not catch hold, but it remains one the best examinations of the relationship between altruism and kin selection.  Rothstein and Pierotti also explain why Trivers' examples of Reciprocal Altruism are actually examples of delayed return altruism.

==Theory==
The concept of &quot;reciprocal altruism&quot;, as introduced by Trivers, suggests that [[altruism]], defined as an act of helping another individual while incurring some cost for this act, could have evolved since it might be beneficial to incur this cost if there is a chance of being in a reverse situation where the individual who was helped before may perform an altruistic act towards the individual who helped them initially.&lt;ref name=&quot;trivers&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trivers | first1 = R.L. | year = 1971 | title = The evolution of reciprocal altruism | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4e671994e5b0c7aefbecd050e95fdb45272d7e12| journal = Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 35–57 | doi = 10.1086/406755 | s2cid = 19027999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept finds its roots in the work of [[W. D. Hamilton|W.D. Hamilton]], who developed mathematical models for predicting the likelihood of an altruistic act to be performed on behalf of one's kin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamilton|date=1964|title=The Genetical Evolution of Social Behavior II|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=7|issue=1|pages=17–52|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(64)90039-6|pmid=5875340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Putting this into the form of a strategy in a repeated [[prisoner's dilemma]] would mean to cooperate unconditionally in the first period and behave cooperatively (altruistically) as long as the other agent does as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;trivers&quot; /&gt; If chances of meeting another reciprocal altruist are high enough, or if the game is repeated for a long enough amount of time, this form of altruism can evolve within a population.

This is close to the notion of &quot;[[tit for tat]]&quot; introduced by [[Anatol Rapoport]],&lt;ref name=Dawkins06&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |title=The Selfish Gene |edition=30th Anniversary |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-19-929114-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although there still seems a slight distinction in that &quot;tit for tat&quot; cooperates in the first period and from thereon always replicates an opponent's previous action, whereas &quot;reciprocal altruists&quot; stop cooperation in the first instance of non-cooperation by an opponent and stay non-cooperative from thereon. This distinction leads to the fact that in contrast to reciprocal altruism, tit for tat may be able to restore cooperation under certain conditions despite cooperation having broken down.

Christopher Stephens shows a set of necessary and jointly sufficient conditions &quot;... for an instance of reciprocal altruism:&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stephens | first1 = C. | year = 1996 | title = Modelling Reciprocal Altruism | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f5dd281e9f59874a8ebea09c30e9bf2d5036de13| journal = British Journal for the Philosophy of Science | volume = 47 | issue = 4| pages = 533–551 | doi = 10.1093/bjps/47.4.533| s2cid = 1462394 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# the behaviour must reduce a donor's fitness relative to a selfish alternative;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;/&gt;
# the fitness of the recipient must be elevated relative to non-recipients;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;/&gt;
# the performance of the behaviour must not depend on the receipt of an immediate benefit;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;/&gt;
# conditions 1, 2, and 3 must apply to both individuals engaging in reciprocal helping.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;/&gt;

There are two additional conditions necessary &quot;...for reciprocal altruism to evolve:&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;/&gt;

* A mechanism for detecting 'cheaters' must exist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;/&gt;
* A large (indefinite) number of opportunities to exchange aid must exist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;/&gt;

The first two conditions are necessary for altruism as such, while the third is distinguishing reciprocal altruism from simple mutualism and the fourth makes the interaction reciprocal.
Condition number five is required as otherwise non-altruists may always exploit altruistic behaviour without any consequences and therefore evolution of reciprocal altruism would not be possible. However, it is pointed out that this &quot;conditioning device&quot; does not need to be conscious. Condition number six is required to avoid cooperation breakdown through backwards induction&amp;mdash;a possibility suggested by game theoretical models.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot; /&gt;

==Examples==
The following examples could be understood as altruism. 
However, showing reciprocal altruism in an unambiguous way requires more evidence as will be shown later.

===Cleaner fish===
{{further|Cleaning symbiosis}}
[[File:Cleaner station komodo.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Cleaning symbiosis]]: a small cleaner [[wrasse]] (''Labroides dimidiatus'') with [[Animal coloration|advertising coloration]] services a big eye squirrelfish (''[[Priacanthidae|Priacanthus hamrur]]'') in an apparent example of reciprocal altruism.]]

An example of reciprocal altruism is [[cleaning symbiosis]], such as between [[cleaner fish]] and their hosts, though cleaners include shrimps and birds, and clients include fish, turtles, octopuses and mammals.&lt;ref name=Grutter&gt;{{cite journal | title=Cleaning symbioses from the parasites' perspective | author=Grutter, Alexandra S. | journal=Parasitology | year=2002 | volume=124 | issue=7 | pages=S65–S81 | doi=10.1017/S0031182002001488| pmid=12396217 | s2cid=26816332 | url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d7bfed4ed0e1862fba7b5fd1d1e4d898f0d39ba0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Aside from the apparent [[symbiosis]] of the cleaner and the host during actual cleaning, which cannot be interpreted as altruism, the host displays additional behaviour that meets the criteria for delayed return altruism:

The host fish allows the cleaner fish free entrance and exit and does not eat the cleaner, even after the cleaning is done.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eibel-Eibesfeldt&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1439-0310.1955.tb01523.x | title = Über Symbiosen, Parasitismus und andere besondere zwischenartliche Beziehungen tropischer Meeresfische1 | year = 2010 | last1 = Eibi-Eibesfeldt | first1 = T | journal = Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 203–219 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidiger&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first=H. |last=Heidiger |title=Putzer-fische im aquarium |journal=Natur und Museum |volume=98 |pages=89–96 |year=1968 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Randall1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Randall | first1 = J. E. | year = 1958 | title = A review of the Labrid fish genus Labriodes with descriptions of two new species and notes on ecology | journal = Pacific Science | volume = 12 | issue =4 | pages = 327–347 |url=https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/7923/vol12n4-327-347.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Randall2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Randall | first1 = J. E. | year = 1962 | title = Fish service stations | journal = Sea Frontiers | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 40–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The host signals the cleaner it is about to depart the cleaner's locality, even when the cleaner is not in its body. The host sometimes chases off possible dangers to the cleaner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Randall2&quot; /&gt;

The following evidence supports the hypothesis:

The cleaning by cleaners is essential for the host. In the absence of cleaners the hosts leave the locality or suffer from injuries inflicted by ectoparasites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feder&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=H.M. |last=Feder |chapter=Cleaning symbioses in the marine environment |chapterurl= |editor-first=S.M. |editor-last=Henry |title=Symbiosis |publisher=Academic Press |year=1966 |isbn= |pages=327–380 |oclc=841865823 |volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is difficulty and danger in finding a cleaner. Hosts leave their element to get cleaned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Randall2&quot; /&gt; Others wait no longer than 30 seconds before searching for cleaners elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eibel-Eibesfeldt&quot; /&gt;

A key requirement for the establishment of reciprocal altruism is that the same two individuals must interact repeatedly, as otherwise the best strategy for the host would be to eat the cleaner as soon as cleaning was complete. This constraint imposes both a spatial and a temporal condition on the cleaner and on its host. Both individuals must remain in the same physical location, and both must have a long enough lifespan, to enable multiple interactions. There is reliable evidence that individual cleaners and hosts do indeed interact repeatedly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Randall1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Feder&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Limbaugh&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Limbaugh | first1 = C. | last2 = Pederson | first2 = H. | last3 = Chase | first3 = F. | year = 1961 | title = Shrimps that clean fishes | url =http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/umrsmas/bullmar/1961/00000011/00000001/art00011 | journal = Bull. Mar. Sci. Gulf Caribb. | volume = 11 | issue =1 | pages = 237–257 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This example meets some, but not all, of the criteria described in Trivers's model. In the cleaner-host system the benefit to the cleaner is always immediate. However, the evolution of reciprocal altruism is contingent on opportunities for future rewards through repeated interactions. In one study, nearby host fish observed &quot;cheater&quot; cleaners and subsequently avoided them.&lt;ref name=&quot;bshary&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bshary | first1 = R. | year = 2002 | title = Biting cleaner fish use altruism to deceive image-scoring client reef fish | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B | volume = 269 | issue = 1505 | pages = 2087–93 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2002.2084| pmid = 12396482 | pmc = 1691138 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these examples, true reciprocity is difficult to demonstrate since failure means the death of the cleaner. However, if Randall's claim that hosts sometimes chase off possible dangers to the cleaner is correct, an experiment might be constructed in which reciprocity could be demonstrated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Randall1&quot; /&gt;  In actuality this is one of Trivers' examples of Delayed Return Altruism as discussed by Rothstein and Pierotti 1988.

Warning calls, although exposing a bird and putting it in danger, are frequently given by birds. An explanation in terms of altruistic behaviors given by Trivers:&lt;ref name=&quot;trivers&quot;/&gt;

It has been shown that predators learn specific localities and specialize individually on prey types and hunting techniques.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murie&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Adolph |last=Murie |title=Fauna of the National Parks of the United States: Fauna series |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HO_aAAAAMAAJ |year=1944 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |series=Fauna of National Parks of the United States |volume=Faunal Series No. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Southern | first1 = H.

It is therefore disadvantageous for a bird to have a predator eat a conspecific, because the experienced predator may then be more likely to eat him. Alarming another bird by giving a warning call tends to prevent predators from specializing on the caller's species and locality. In this way, birds in areas in which warning calls are given will be at a selective advantage relative to birds in areas free from warning calls.

Nevertheless, this presentation lacks important elements of reciprocity. It is very hard to detect and ostracize cheaters. There is no evidence that a bird refrains from giving calls when another bird is not reciprocating, nor evidence that individuals interact repeatedly. Given the aforementioned characteristics of bird calling, a continuous bird emigration and immigration environment (true of many avian species) is most likely to be partial to cheaters, since selection against the [[Gene-centered view of evolution|selfish gene]]&lt;ref name=Dawkins06 /&gt; is unlikely.&lt;ref name=&quot;trivers&quot; /&gt;

Another explanation for warning calls is that these are not warning calls at all:
A bird, once it has detected a bird of prey, calls to signal to the bird of prey that it was detected, and that there is no use trying to attack the calling bird. Two facts support this hypothesis:

* The call frequencies match the hearing range of the predator bird.
* Calling birds are less attacked—predator birds attack calling birds less frequently than other birds.

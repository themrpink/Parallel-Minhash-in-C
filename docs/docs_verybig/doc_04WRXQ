Lithuania meanwhile formed a large dual state with [[Poland]], known as the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Renaissance influences grew stronger during the reign of the [[Grand Duke of Lithuania|Grand Dukes of Lithuania]] [[Sigismund I the Old]] and [[Sigismund II Augustus]]. The [[Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania]] (destroyed in 1801, a copy built in 2002–2009) show Italian influences. Several architects of Italian origin were active in the country, including [[Bernardino Zanobi de Gianotis]], [[Giovanni Cini]] and [[Giovanni Maria Mosca]].&lt;ref name=&quot;grove2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Campbell|first= Gordon (ed.)|authorlink= |title= The Grove Encyclopedia of Northern Renaissance Art |url= |year= 2009|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= |isbn= 9780195334661|volume=2|pages=486–487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bohemia===
{{main|Czech Renaissance architecture}}
[[File:Prague Praha 2014 Holmstad Belvedere flott.jpg|thumb|right|[[Queen Anne's Summer Palace|Royal Summer Palace]] in [[Prague]] is considered the purest Renaissance architecture outside of Italy.&lt;ref name=guide&gt;{{cite book|title=Prague : City Guidebook|date=2000|publisher=Kartografie|location=Prague|isbn=80-7011-597-1|page=40|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Renaissance style first appeared in the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Crown of Bohemia]] in the 1490s. Bohemia together with its incorporated lands, especially Moravia, thus ranked among the areas of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] with the earliest known examples of the Renaissance architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hamlin|first1=Alfred D.|title=History of architecture|date=2010|publisher=Salzwasser-Verlag|location=Bremen|isbn=9783861952503|page=338|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g89phgpRZOEC&amp;pg=PA338|access-date=19 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073634/https://books.google.cz/books?id=g89phgpRZOEC&amp;pg=PA338&amp;dq=|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lands of the Bohemian Crown were never part of the ancient [[Roman Empire]], thus they missed their own ancient classical heritage and had to be dependent on the primarily Italian models. As well as in other Central European countries the Gothic style kept its position especially in the church architecture. The traditional [[Gothic architecture]] was considered timeless and therefore able to express the sacredness. The Renaissance architecture coexisted with the Gothic style in Bohemia and Moravia until the late 16th century (e. g. the residential part of a palace was built in the modern Renaissance style but its chapel was designed with Gothic elements). The façades of Czech Renaissance buildings were often decorated with [[sgraffito]] (figural or ornamental).

During the reign of Holy Roman Emperor and Bohemian King [[Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolph II]], the city of Prague became one of the most important European centers of the late Renaissance art (so-called [[Northern Mannerism|Mannerism]]). Nevertheless, not many architecturally significant buildings have been preserved from that time.

===Croatia===
{{main|Renaissance in Croatia|Architecture of Croatia}}
[[File:SibenikFotoThalerTamas5.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral of St. James, Šibenik]]]]
In the 15th century, [[Croatia]] was divided into three states: the northern and central part of Croatia and [[Slavonia]] were in union with the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], while [[Dalmatia]], with the exception of independent [[Dubrovnik]], was under the rule of the [[Venetian Republic]]. The [[Cathedral of St. James, Šibenik|Cathedral of St.James]] in [[Šibenik]], was begun in 1441 in the Gothic style by [[Giorgio da Sebenico]] ''(Juraj Dalmatinac)''. Its unusual construction does not use mortar, the stone blocks, [[pilaster]]s and [[ribs]] being bonded with [[joints]] and [[Groove (engineering)|slots]] in the way that was usual in wooden constructions. In 1477 the work was unfinished, and continued under [[Niccolò di Giovanni Fiorentino]], who respected the mode of construction and the plan of the former architect, but continued the work which includes the upper windows, the vaults and the dome, in the Renaissance style. The combination of a high barrel vault with lower half-barrel vaults over the aisles the gives the façade its distinctive [[trefoil]] shape, the first of this type in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506013344/http://www.sibenik.hr/vodic-eng/sibenik/kulturno_povijesna_bastina2.asp |archivedate=6 May 2009 |url=http://www.sibenik.hr/vodic-eng/sibenik/kulturno_povijesna_bastina2.asp |title=St James's Cathedral}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cathedral was listed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]] in 2001.

===England===
[[File:Hardwick Hall 3 (7027835143).jpg|thumb|English Renaissance: [[Hardwick Hall]] (1590–1597).]]
{{main|Elizabethan architecture|Prodigy house}}
Renaissance architecture arrived in England during the reign of [[Elizabeth I]], having first spread through the [[Low countries]] where among other features it acquired versions of the [[Crow-stepped gable|Dutch gable]], and [[Flemish people|Flemish]] [[strapwork]] in geometric designs adorning the walls. The new style tended to manifest itself in large square tall houses such as [[Longleat House]].

The first great exponent of Italian Renaissance architecture in England was [[Inigo Jones]] (1573–1652), who had studied architecture in Italy where the influence of Palladio was very strong. Jones returned to England full of enthusiasm for the new movement and immediately began to design such buildings as the [[Queen's House]] at [[Greenwich]] in 1616 and the [[Banqueting House, Whitehall|Banqueting House]] at [[Whitehall]] three years later. These works, with their clean lines, and symmetry were revolutionary in a country still enamoured with mullion windows, crenellations and turrets.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Summerson, ''Architecture in Britain 1530–1830'', 1977 ed., Pelican, {{ISBN|0-14-056003-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
{{main|French Renaissance architecture}}
[[File:Chambord Castle Northwest facade.jpg|thumb|left|French Renaissance: [[Château de Chambord]] (1519–39)]]
During the early years of the 16th century the French were involved in wars in northern Italy, bringing back to France not just the Renaissance art treasures as their war [[Looting|booty]], but also stylistic ideas. In the [[Loire Valley]] a wave of building was carried and many Renaissance châteaux appeared at this time, the earliest example being the [[Château d'Amboise]] (c. 1495) in which [[Leonardo da Vinci]] spent his last years. The style became dominant under [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (See [[Châteaux of the Loire Valley]]).&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;&lt;ref name= W&amp;M /&gt;

===Germany===
{{main|German Renaissance}}
The Renaissance in Germany was inspired first by German philosophers and artists such as [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[Johannes Reuchlin]] who visited Italy. Important early examples of this period are especially the [[Landshut Residence]], the [[Heidelberg Castle|Castle]] in [[Heidelberg]], [[Schloss Johannisburg|Johannisburg Palace]] in [[Aschaffenburg]], [[Schloss Weilburg]], the [[Augsburg Town Hall|City Hall]] and [[Fuggerhäuser|Fugger Houses]] in [[Augsburg]] and [[St. Michael's Church, Munich|St. Michael]] in [[Munich]]. A particular form of Renaissance architecture in Germany is the [[Weser Renaissance]], with prominent examples such as the [[Town Hall of Bremen|City Hall]] of [[Bremen]] and the [[University of Helmstedt|Juleum]] in [[Helmstedt]].

[[File:Juleum Helmstedt.jpg|thumb|[[University of Helmstedt|Juleum]] in [[Helmstedt]], Germany (example of [[Weser Renaissance]])]]

In July 1567 the city council of [[Cologne]] approved a design in the Renaissance style by Wilhelm Vernukken for a two storied loggia for [[Cologne City Hall]]. [[Michaelskirche (München)|St Michael]] in [[Munich]] is the largest Renaissance church north of the Alps. It was built by [[William V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke William V]] of [[Bavaria]] between 1583 and 1597 as a spiritual center for the [[Counter Reformation]] and was inspired by the Church of [[il Gesù]] in Rome. The architect is unknown.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;&lt;ref name=A.M /&gt;&lt;ref name= W&amp;M /&gt; Many examples of [[Brick Renaissance]] buildings can be found in [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] old towns, such as [[Stralsund]], [[Wismar]], [[Lübeck]], [[Lüneburg]], [[Friedrichstadt]] and [[Stade]]. Notable German Renaissance architects include [[Friedrich Sustris]], [[Benedikt Rejt]], [[Abraham van den Blocke]], [[Elias Holl]] and [[Hans Krumpper]].

===Hungary===
{{main|Renaissance architecture in Central and Eastern Europe}}
One of the earliest places to be influenced by the Renaissance style of architecture was the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The style appeared following the marriage of King [[Matthias Corvinus]] and [[Beatrice of Naples]] in 1476. Many Italian artists, craftsmen and [[masonry|masons]] arrived at [[Buda]] with the new queen. Important remains of the Early Renaissance summer palace of King Matthias can be found in [[Visegrád]]. The Ottoman conquest of Hungary after 1526 cut short the development of Renaissance architecture in the country and destroyed its most famous examples. Today, the only completely preserved work of Hungarian Renaissance architecture is the Bakócz Chapel (commissioned by the Hungarian cardinal [[Tamás Bakócz]]), now part of the [[Esztergom Basilica]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hung-art.hu/kep/zmisc/faragvan/162_sz/bakocz01.jpg Image of Bakócz Chapel] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023123437/http://www.hung-art.hu/kep/zmisc/faragvan/162_sz/bakocz01.jpg |date=23 October 2006 }} (1506–08)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
{{main|Renaissance in the Netherlands}}
[[File:Antwerpen Stadhuis crop4 2006-05-28.jpg|thumb|[[Antwerp City Hall]] (finished in 1564)]]
As in [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting|painting]], Renaissance architecture took some time to reach the Netherlands and did not entirely supplant the Gothic elements. An architect directly influenced by the Italian masters was [[Cornelis Floris de Vriendt]], who designed the [[Antwerp City Hall|city hall of Antwerpen]], finished in 1564. The style sometimes known as [[Antwerp Mannerism]], keeping a similar overall structure to late-Gothic buildings, but with larger windows and much florid decoration and detailing in Renaissance styles, was widely influential across Northern Europe, for example in [[Elizabethan architecture]], and is part of the wider movement of [[Northern Mannerism]].

In the early 17th century [[Dutch Republic]], [[Hendrick de Keyser]] played an important role in developing the &quot;Amsterdam Renaissance&quot; style, which has local characteristics including the prevalence of tall narrow town-houses, the ''trapgevel'' or [[Crow-stepped gable|Dutch gable]] and the employment of decorative triangular pediments over doors and windows in which the apex rises much more steeply than in most other Renaissance architecture, but in keeping with the profile of the gable. Carved stone details are often of low profile, in [[strapwork]] resembling leatherwork, a stylistic feature originating in the [[School of Fontainebleau]]. This feature was exported to England.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;&lt;ref name= W&amp;M /&gt;

===Poland===
{{main|Renaissance in Poland|Renaissance architecture in Central Europe|Mannerist architecture and sculpture in Poland}}
[[File:Wawel dziedziniec1 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Courtyard of [[Wawel Castle]] exemplifies first period of Polish Renaissance]]
[[Polish Renaissance]] architecture is divided into three periods:
The first period (1500–50) is the so-called &quot;Italian&quot; as most of Renaissance buildings of this time were designed by Italian architects, mainly from [[Florence]], including [[Francesco Fiorentino]] and [[Bartolomeo Berrecci]]. Renowned architects from Southern Europe became sought-after during the reign of [[Sigismund I the Old]] and his Italian-born wife, Queen [[Bona Sforza]]. Notable examples from this period include [[Wawel Castle]] Courtyard and [[Sigismund's Chapel]].

In the second period (1550–1600), Renaissance architecture became more common, with the beginnings of [[Mannerist]] and under the influence of the Netherlands, particularly in northern Poland and [[Pomerania]], but also in parts of [[Lesser Poland]]. Buildings of this kind include the [[Sukiennice|Cloth Hall]] in Kraków and city halls of [[Tarnów]] and [[Sandomierz]]. The most famous example is the 16th-century [[Poznań Town Hall]], designed by [[Giovanni Battista di Quadro]].

In the third period (1600–50), the rising power of sponsored [[Jesuits]] and [[Counter Reformation]] gave impetus to the development of Mannerist architecture and Baroque.&lt;ref&gt;Harald Busch, Bernd Lohse, Hans Weigert, ''Baukunst der Renaissance in Europa. Von Spätgotik bis zum Manierismus'', Frankfurt af Main, 1960&lt;br /&gt;Wilfried Koch, ''Style w architekturze'', Warsaw 1996&lt;br /&gt;Tadeusz Broniewski, ''Historia architektury dla wszystkich'' Wydawnictwo Ossolineum, 1990&lt;br /&gt;Mieczysław Gębarowicz, ''Studia nad dziejami kultury artystycznej późnego renesansu w Polsce'', Toruń 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portugal===

{{main|Renaissance architecture in Portugal|Portuguese Renaissance}}
As in Spain, the adoption of the Renaissance style in Portugal was gradual. The so-called [[Manueline]] style (c. 1490–1535) married Renaissance elements to Gothic structures with the superficial application of exuberant ornament similar to the [[Isabelline Gothic]] of Spain. Examples of Manueline include the [[Belém Tower]], a defensive building of Gothic form decorated with Renaissance-style [[loggia]]s, and the [[Jerónimos Monastery]], with Renaissance ornaments decorating portals, columns and cloisters.

The first &quot;pure&quot; Renaissance structures appear under [[John III of Portugal|King John III]], like the Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Conceição in Tomar (1532–40), the ''Porta Especiosa'' of [[Old Cathedral of Coimbra|Coimbra Cathedral]] and the Graça Church at [[Évora]] (c. 1530–1540), as well as the cloisters of the Cathedral of [[Viseu]] (c. 1528–1534) and [[Convent of Christ]] in Tomar (John III Cloisters, 1557–1591). The [[Lisbon]] buildings of [[Igreja de São Roque (Lisbon)|São Roque Church]] (1565–87) and the Mannerist [[Monastery of São Vicente de Fora]] (1582–1629), strongly influenced religious architecture in both Portugal and its colonies in the next centuries.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

===Russia===
{{main|Russian architecture|Renaissance architecture in Eastern Europe}}
Prince [[Ivan III]] introduced Renaissance architecture to [[Russia]] by inviting a number of architects from [[Italy]], who brought new construction techniques and some Renaissance style elements with them, while in general following the traditional designs of the [[Russian architecture]]. In 1475 the Bolognese architect [[Aristotele Fioravanti]] came to rebuild the [[Cathedral of the Dormition]] in the [[Moscow Kremlin]], damaged in an earthquake. Fioravanti was given the 12th-century [[Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir|Vladimir Cathedral]] as a model, and produced a design combining traditional Russian style with a Renaissance sense of spaciousness, proportion and symmetry.

[[File:Московский Кремль. Грановитая палата.jpg|thumb|The [[Palace of Facets]] on the [[Cathedral Square, Moscow|Cathedral Square]] of the [[Moscow Kremlin]].]]

In 1485, Ivan III commissioned the building of a royal [[Terem Palace]] within the Kremlin, with [[Aloisio da Milano]] being the architect of the first three floors. Aloisio da Milano, as well as the other Italian architects, also greatly contributed to the construction of the [[Kremlin wall]]s [[Kremlin towers|and towers]]. The small banqueting hall of the [[Russian Tsar]]s, called the [[Palace of Facets]] because of its facetted upper story, is the work of two Italians, [[Marco Ruffo]] and [[Pietro Solario]], and shows a more Italian style.

In 1505, an Italian known in Russia as [[Aleviz Novyi]] built twelve churches for Ivan III, including the [[Cathedral of the Archangel]], a building remarkable for the successful blending of Russian tradition, Orthodox requirements and Renaissance style.

===Scandinavia===
{{main|Architecture of Denmark}}
[[File:Frederiksborg Castle and boat crop.jpg|thumb|left|Nordic Renaissance: [[Frederiksborg Palace]] (1602–20)]]
The Renaissance architecture that found its way to Scandinavia was influenced by the Flemish architecture, and included high gables and a castle air as demonstrated in the architecture of [[Frederiksborg Palace]]. Consequently, much of the Neo-Renaissance to be found in the Scandinavian countries is derived from this source.

In Denmark, Renaissance architecture thrived during the reigns of [[Frederick II of Denmark|Frederick II]] and especially [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]]. Inspired by the French castles of the times, Flemish architects designed masterpieces such as [[Kronborg Castle]] in Helsingør and Frederiksborg Palace in Hillerød. The Frederiksborg Palace (1602–1620) is the largest Renaissance palace in Scandinavia.

Elsewhere in Sweden, with [[Gustav Vasa]]'s seizure of power and the onset of the Protestant reformation, church construction and aristocratic building projects came to a near standstill. During this time period, several magnificent so-called &quot;Vasa castles&quot; appeared. They were erected at strategic locations to control the country as well as to accommodate the travelling royal court. [[Gripsholm Castle]], [[Kalmar Castle]] and [[Vadstena Castle]] are known for their fusion of medieval elements with Renaissance architecture.

The architecture of [[Norway]] was influenced partly by the occurrence of the plague during the Renaissance era. After the [[Black Death]], monumental construction in Norway came to a standstill. There are few examples of Renaissance architecture in Norway, the most prominent being renovations to the medieval [[Rosenkrantz Tower]] in Bergen, [[Barony Rosendal]] in Hardanger, and the contemporary [[Austrått|Austrat manor]] near Trondheim, and parts of [[Akershus Fortress]].

There is little evidence of Renaissance influence in Finnish architecture.

===Spain===
{{main|Spanish Renaissance architecture}}
[[File:Monasterio de El Escorial 03.jpg|thumb|left|[[El Escorial|The Escorial]] (1563–1584), [[Madrid]]]]
In Spain, Renaissance began to be grafted to Gothic forms in the last decades of the 15th century. The new style is called [[Plateresque]], because of the extremely decorated façade, that brought to the mind the decorative motifs of the intricately detailed work of [[silversmith]]s, the ''Plateros''. Classical orders and candelabra motifs (''a candelieri'') combined freely into symmetrical wholes.

From the mid-sixteenth century, under such architects as Pedro Machuca, [[Juan Bautista de Toledo]] and [[Juan de Herrera]] there was a closer adherence to the art of ancient Rome, sometimes anticipating [[Mannerism]], examples of which include the [[palace of Charles V]] in [[Granada]] and the [[Escorial]].&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;&lt;ref name=A.M /&gt;&lt;ref name= W&amp;M /&gt;

==Legacy==
{{main|Renaissance Revival architecture}}
During the 19th century there was a conscious revival of the style in [[Renaissance Revival architecture]], that paralleled the [[Gothic Revival]]. Whereas the Gothic style was perceived by architectural theorists&lt;ref&gt;[[John Ruskin]]&lt;br&gt;[[Cambridge Camden Society]]&lt;/ref&gt; as being the most appropriate style for Church building, the Renaissance palazzo was a good model for urban secular buildings requiring an appearance of dignity and reliability such as banks, gentlemen's clubs and apartment blocks.&lt;ref&gt;An influential example, The [[Reform Club]] in London (1841) by [[Charles Barry]] was closely inspired by the [[Palazzo Farnese]], discussed above [http://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/england/london/barry/reform.html Photos and commentary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111457/http://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/england/london/barry/reform.html |date=29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Buildings that sought to impress, such as the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Opera]], were often of a more Mannerist or Baroque style.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]]&lt;/ref&gt; Architects of factories, office blocks and department stores continued to use the Renaissance palazzo form into the 20th century, in [[Mediterranean Revival Style architecture]] with an Italian Renaissance emphasis.&lt;ref name= Pevs /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Sullivan]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the concepts and forms of Renaissance architecture can be traced through subsequent architectural movements—from Renaissance to High-Renaissance, to Mannerism, to Baroque (or [[Rococo]]), to [[Neo-Classicism]], and to [[Eclecticism]]. While Renaissance style and motifs were largely purged from [[Modernism]], they have been reasserted in some [[Postmodern architecture]]. The influence of Renaissance architecture can still be seen in many of the modern styles and rules of architecture today.

'''''Amadeus''''' is a play by [[Peter Shaffer]] which gives a fictional account of the lives of composers [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and [[Antonio Salieri]], first performed in 1979. It was inspired by [[Alexander Pushkin]]'s short 1830 play ''[[Mozart and Salieri (play)|Mozart and Salieri]]'', which [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] used in 1897 as the libretto for an [[Mozart and Salieri (opera)|opera of the same name]].

The play makes significant use of the music of Mozart, Salieri and other composers of the period. The premieres of Mozart's operas [[Die Entführung aus dem Serail|''The Abduction from the Seraglio'']], ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]],'' ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', and ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' are the settings for key scenes. It was presented at the [[Royal National Theatre]], London in 1979, then moved to [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] in the [[West End theatre|West End]] followed by a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production. It won the 1981 [[Tony Award for Best Play]] and Shaffer adapted it for [[Amadeus (film)|the 1984 film of the same name]].

==Plot==
[Since the play's original run, Shaffer extensively revised his play, including changes to plot details; the following is common to all revisions.]

The composer Salieri is an old man, having long outlived his fame. Speaking directly to the audience, he claims to have used poison to assassinate Mozart and promises to explain himself. The action then [[flashback (continuity)|flashes back]] to the eighteenth century, at a time when Salieri has not met Mozart but has heard of him and his music. He adores Mozart's compositions and is thrilled at the chance to meet him, during a [[salon (gathering)|salon]] at which some of Mozart's compositions will be played. When he finally does catch sight of Mozart he is deeply disappointed to find him lacking the grace and charm of his compositions. Mozart is crawling around on his hands and knees, engaging in profane talk with his future bride [[Constanze Weber]].

Salieri cannot reconcile Mozart's boorish behaviour with the genius that God has inexplicably bestowed upon him. A devout Catholic all his life, Salieri cannot believe that God would choose Mozart over him for such a gift. Salieri renounces God and vows to do everything in his power to destroy Mozart as a way of retaliating against his Creator. Salieri pretends to be Mozart's ally to his face while doing his utmost to destroy his reputation and any success his compositions may have. On more than one occasion, only the intervention of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]] allows Mozart to continue (interventions which Salieri opposes and then is all too happy to take credit for when Mozart assumes it was he who intervened). Salieri humiliates Mozart's wife when she comes to Salieri for aid. He [[smear campaign|smears]] Mozart's character with the Emperor and the court. A major theme in ''Amadeus'' is Mozart's repeated attempts to win over the aristocratic &quot;public&quot; with increasingly brilliant compositions, which are always frustrated either by Salieri or by the aristocracy's inability to appreciate Mozart's genius. Salieri attempts suicide with a razor in a last attempt to be remembered, leaving a confession of having murdered Mozart with [[arsenic]]. He survives and his confession is met with disbelief, leaving him to wallow once again in mediocrity.

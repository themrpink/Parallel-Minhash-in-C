The Java language is defined by the ''Java Language Specification'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/ The Java Language Specification]&lt;/ref&gt; a book which is published by Oracle.

The Java language continuously evolves via a process called the [[Java Community Process]], and the world's programming community is represented by a group of people and organizations - the Java Community members&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcp.org/en/participation/members The Java Community Process(SM) Program - Participation - JCP Members&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;—which is actively engaged into the enhancement of the language, by sending public requests - the Java Specification Requests - which must pass formal and public reviews before they get integrated into the language.

The lack of a firm standard for Java and the somewhat more volatile nature of its specifications have been a constant source of criticism by stake-holders wanting more stability and conservatism in the addition of new language and library features. In contrast, the C++ committee also receives constant criticism, for the opposite reason, i.e., being too strict and conservative, and taking too long to release new versions.

'''Pine''' is a [[freeware]], [[text-based]] [[email client]] which was developed at the [[University of Washington]]. The first version was written in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/pine/overview/project-history.html|title=Pine Project History|accessdate=2009-03-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217193232/http://www.washington.edu/pine/overview/project-history.html|archive-date=2009-02-17|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and announced to the public in March 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;announcement&quot;&gt;{{cite newsgroup |title = Announcing the Pine Mailer |author = University of Washington |date = 24 March 1992 |publication-date = 26 March 1992 |newsgroup = comp.mail.misc |message-id = 1992Mar26.021949.17772@u.washington.edu |url = https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.mail.misc/kqKQojTDVBM/kvYgyYbwfKoJ |accessdate = 25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Source code was available for only the [[Unix]] version under a license written by the [[University of Washington]]. Pine is no longer under development, and has been replaced by the [[Alpine (email client)|Alpine]] client, which is available under the [[Apache License]].

==Supported platforms==
There are [[Unix]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], and [[Linux]] versions of Pine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pine Information Center--Obtaining Pine software|url=http://www.washington.edu/pine/getpine/|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=2 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921003243/http://www.washington.edu/pine/getpine/|archive-date=21 September 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Unix/Linux version is [[text user interface]] based&amp;mdash;its message editor inspired the text editor [[Pico (text editor)|Pico]].  The Windows (and formerly DOS) version is called '''PC-Pine'''. '''WebPine''' was available to individuals associated with the University of Washington (students, [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]], etc.)&amp;mdash;a version of Pine implemented as a [[World Wide Web|web]] application. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pine Information Center--Obtaining Pine software|url=https://itconnect.uw.edu/connect/email/resources/uw-email/retirement//|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=23 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923162921/https://itconnect.uw.edu/connect/email/resources/uw-email/retirement/|archive-date=23 September 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most moved over to [[Alpine (email client)|Alpine]], however there are still many users of this software.

==Etymology==
Many people believe that Pine stands for &quot;'''P'''ine '''I'''s '''N'''ot [[Elm (email client)|'''E'''lm]]&quot;. One of its original authors, [[Laurence Lundblade]], insists this was never the case and that it started off simply as a word and not an acronym, and that his first choice of a [[backronym]] for pine would be &quot;Pine Is Nearly Elm&quot;. Over time, it was changed by the university to mean ''Program for Internet News and E-mail''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.island-resort.com/pine.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607212819/http://www.island-resort.com/pine.htm |archivedate=2011-06-07|accessdate=2012-11-03|title=Laurence's home page: Naming Pine}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original announcement said: &quot;Pine was originally based on Elm, but it has evolved much since, ('Pine Is No-longer Elm').&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;announcement&quot; /&gt;

==Licensing and clones==
Up to version 3.91, the Pine license was similar to [[BSD licenses|BSD]], and it stated that

:''Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its documentation for any purpose and without fee to the University of Washington is hereby granted …''

The University registered a [[trademark]] for the Pine name with respect to &quot;computer programs used in communication and electronic mail applications&quot; in March 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=74336887&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch|title=SN 74336887|website=Trademark Status &amp; Document Retrieval}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From version 3.92, the holder of the copyright, the University of Washington, changed the license so that even if the source code was still available, they did ''not'' allow modifications and changes to Pine  to be distributed by anyone other than themselves. They also claimed that even the old license never allowed distribution of modified versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite mailing list|url=https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2002/11/msg00138.html|first=Branden|last=Robinson|title=Re: DFSG vs Pine's legal notices: where exactly is the gotcha?|mailing-list=debian-legal|date=2002-11-12|accessdate=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trademark for the Pine name was part of their position in this matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://linuxmafia.com/~rick/faq/warez.html#pine|title=What's wrong with Pine|website=Rick's Rants|first=Rick|last=Moen|accessdate=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction, some developers [[Fork (software development)|forked]] version 3.91 under the name MANA (for ''Mail And News Agent'') to avoid the trademark issue and the [[GNU Project]] adopted it as GNU Mana.  [[Richard Stallman]] claims that the University of Washington threatened&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite mailing list|url=https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2000/09/msg00014.html|title=Re: Free Pine?|mailing-list=debian-legal|first=Richard|last=Stallman|date=2000-09-02|accessdate=2006-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; to sue the Free Software Foundation for distributing the modified Pine program, resulting in the development of MANA ceasing and no versions being released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/pooka_regent/ethics.html|title=The Golden Rule as Applied to Intellectual Property|accessdate=2006-07-17|date=2002-12-12|first=David|last=Ramsey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pico clone [[GNU nano]] was also written due to the change in licensing terms of Pine and Pico, as explained by nano's author in a blog post criticizing the license in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asty.org/archives/123|title=When Non-Free is “Free Enough”|website=asty.org|first=Chris|last=Allegretta|date=2001|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Washington later modified their license somewhat to allow unmodified distribution of Pine alongside collections of [[free software]], but the license still does not conform to the Open Source and the Free Software Guidelines so it is [[Proprietary software#semi-free|semi-free software]], effectively [[proprietary software]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Alpine==
{{main|Alpine (email client)}}
In 2006, the University of Washington announced that it stopped development of Pine with Pine 4.64, although Pine continues to be supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mailman1.u.washington.edu/pipermail/pine-info/2006-November/055017.html|title=Steve Hubert answers that Pine development is frozen in favour of Alpine|accessdate=2006-12-14|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101071238/http://mailman1.u.washington.edu/pipermail/pine-info/2006-November/055017.html|archivedate=2007-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its place is a new family of email tools based upon Pine, called [[Alpine (email client)|Alpine]] and licensed under the [[Apache License]], version 2. November 29, 2006 saw the first public [[Software release life cycle#Alpha|alpha release]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.mail.pine.general/3602|title=Announce of Alpine 0.8|accessdate=2006-12-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122062941/http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.mail.pine.general/3602|archive-date=2012-01-22|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/alpine/|title=Alpine FTP download directory|accessdate=2006-12-19}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; which forms a new approach, since the alpha test of Pine was always non-public.

Alpine 1.0 was publicly released on December 20, 2007. The most recent version 2.22 was released on January 19, 2020.

'''John of Damascus''' ({{lang-gr|Ἰωάννης ὁ Δαμασκηνός|Ioánnēs ho Damaskēnós}}, {{IPA-el|ioˈanis o ðamasciˈnos|IPA}}; {{lang-la|Ioannes Damascenus}}; {{lang-ar|يوحنا الدمشقي|Yūḥannā ad-Dimashqī}}), also known as '''John Damascene''' and as Χρυσορρόας / ''Chrysorrhoas'' (literally &quot;streaming with gold&quot;—i.e., &quot;the golden speaker&quot;), was a [[Christian monasticism#Eastern Orthodox tradition|Christian monk]] and [[Priesthood (Eastern Orthodox Church)|priest]]. Born and raised in [[Damascus]] c. 675 or 676, he died at his monastery, [[Mar Saba]], near [[Jerusalem]] on 4 December 749.&lt;ref&gt;M. Walsh, ed. ''Butler's Lives of the Saints'' (HarperCollins Publishers: New York, 1991), p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[polymath]] whose fields of interest and contribution included [[law]], [[Christian theology|theology]], [[Christian philosophy|philosophy]], and [[music]], he is said by some sources to have served as a Chief Administrator to the [[Islam|Muslim]] [[caliph]] of Damascus before his ordination.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Conklin Akbari, ''Idols in the East: European representations of Islam and the Orient, 1100–1450'', Cornell University Press, 2009 p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Richard Thomas, ''Syrian Christians under Islam: the first thousand years'', Brill 2001 p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote works expounding the Christian faith, and composed hymns which are still used both [[Liturgy|liturgically]] in [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] practice throughout the world as well as in western [[Lutheranism]] at Easter.&lt;ref&gt;''Lutheran Service Book'' (Concordia Publishing House, St. Louis, 2006), pp. 478, 487.&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of the Fathers of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and is best known for his strong defence of [[icon]]s.&lt;ref name=Aquilinap222&gt;{{Harvnb|Aquilina|1999|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catholic Church]] regards him as a [[Doctor of the Church]], often referred to as the ''Doctor of the Assumption'' due to his writings on the [[Assumption of Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rengers |first=Christopher |title=The 33 Doctors of the Church |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gC_bAAAACAAJ |year=2000 |publisher=Tan Books |isbn=978-0-89555-440-6 |page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common source of information for the life of John of Damascus is a work attributed to one John of Jerusalem, identified therein as the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=Sahas32&gt;{{Harvnb|Sahas|1972|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an excerpted translation into Greek of an earlier Arabic text. The Arabic original contains a prologue not found in most other translations, and was written by an Arab monk, Michael. Michael explained that he decided to write his biography in 1084 because none was available in his day. However, the main Arabic text seems to have been written by an earlier author sometime between the early 9th and late 10th centuries AD.&lt;ref name=Sahas32/&gt; Written from a hagiographical point of view and prone to exaggeration and some legendary details, it is not the best historical source for his life, but is widely reproduced and considered to contain elements of some value.&lt;ref name=Sahas35&gt;{{Harvnb|Sahas|1972|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hagiographic novel ''[[Barlaam and Josaphat]]'', traditionally attributed to John, is in fact a work of the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;R. Volk, ed., ''Historiae animae utilis de Barlaam et Ioasaph'' (Berlin, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family background==
John was born in [[Damascus]] in the third quarter of the 7th century AD, to a prominent Damascene Christian family known as &quot;Mansoūr&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Griffith|2001|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family was named after John's grandfather, Mansour ibn Sarjun, who had been responsible for the taxes of the region during the reign of Emperor [[Heraclius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brownp307&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Janosik25&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Janosik|2016|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mansur seems to have played a role in the capitulation of Damascus to the troops of [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] in 635 after securing favorable conditions of surrender.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brownp307&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2003|p=307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Janosik25&quot;/&gt; [[Patriarch Eutychius of Alexandria|Eutychius]], a 10th-century [[Melkite]] patriarch, mentions him as one high-ranking official involved in the surrender of the city to the Muslims.&lt;ref name=Sahas17&gt;{{Harvnb|Sahas|1972|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though information about the tribal background of the Mansour family are absent in contemporary sources, biographer Daniel Sahas speculates the name Mansour could have implied that they belonged to the [[Arab Christians|Arab Christian tribes]] of [[Banu Kalb|Kalb]] or [[Taghlib]].&lt;ref name=Sahas7&gt;{{Harvnb|Sahas|1972|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the family name was common among Syrian Christians of Arab origins, and Eutychius noted that the governor of Damascus, who was likely Mansour ibn Sarjun, was an Arab.&lt;ref name=Sahas7/&gt; However, Sahas also asserts that the name does not necessarily imply an Arab background and could have been used by non-Arab, Semitic Syrians.&lt;ref name=Sahas7/&gt; While Sahas and biographers F. H. Chase and Andrew Louth assert that ''Mansūr'' was an Arabic name, Raymond le Coz asserts that the &quot;family was without doubt of Syrian origin&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;Janosik26&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Janosik|2016|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, according to historian Daniel J. Janosik, &quot;Both aspects could be true, for if his family ancestry were indeed Syrian, his grandfather [Mansour] could have been given an Arabic name when the Arabs took over the government.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Janosik|2016|pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; John was raised in Damascus, and Arab Christian folklore holds that during his adolescence, John associated with the future [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliph [[Yazid I]] and the Taghlibi Christian court poet [[al-Akhtal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Griffith|2001|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Syria was conquered by the Muslim Arab]]s in the 630s, the court at Damascus retained its large complement of Christian civil servants, John's grandfather among them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brownp307&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sahas17/&gt; John's father, [[Sarjun ibn Mansur|Sarjun (Sergius)]], went on to serve the Umayyad [[caliph]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brownp307&quot;/&gt; According to John of Jerusalem and some later versions of his life, after his father's death, John also served as an official to the caliphal court before leaving to become a monk. This claim, that John actually served in a Muslim court, has been questioned since he is never mentioned in Muslim sources, which however do refer to his father Sarjun (Sergius) as a secretary in the caliphal administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoyland 1996 481&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hoyland|1996|p=481}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, John's own writings never refer to any experience in a Muslim court. It is believed that John became a monk at [[Mar Saba]], and that he was ordained as a priest in 735.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brownp307&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McEnhillNewlandsp154&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|McEnhill|Newlands|2004|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the ''vitae'' describes his father's desire for him to &quot;learn not only the books of the Muslims, but those of the Greeks as well.&quot; From this it has been suggested that John may have grown up bilingual.&lt;ref&gt;Valantasis, p. 455&lt;/ref&gt; John does indeed show some knowledge of the [[Quran]], which he criticizes harshly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoyland|1996|pp=487–489}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Christianity and Islam]].)

Other sources describe his education in Damascus as having been conducted in accordance with the principles of [[Paideia|Hellenic education]], termed &quot;secular&quot; by one source and &quot;classical Christian&quot; by another.&lt;ref name=&quot;Louthp284&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Louth|2002|p=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Butlerp36&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Butler|Jones|Burns|2000|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; One account identifies his tutor as a monk by the name of Cosmas, who had been kidnapped by Arabs from his home in [[Sicily]], and for whom John's father paid a great price. Under the instruction of Cosmas, who also taught John's orphan friend, [[Cosmas of Maiuma]], John is said to have made great advances in music, [[astronomy]] and theology, soon rivalling [[Pythagoras]] in arithmetic and [[Euclid]] in [[geometry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Butlerp36&quot;/&gt; As a refugee from Italy, Cosmas brought with him the scholarly traditions of [[Latin Christianity]].

==Career ==

John had at least one and possibly two careers: one (less well-documented) as a civil servant for the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Caliph]] in Damascus, and the other (better-attested) as a priest and monk at the [[Mar Saba]] monastery near Jerusalem. One source believes John left Damascus to become a monk around 706, when [[al-Walid I]] increased the Islamicisation of the Caliphate's administration.&lt;ref name=Louthp9&gt;{{Harvnb|Louth|2003|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Muslim sources only mention that his father Sarjun (Sergius) left the administration around this time, and fail to name John at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoyland 1996 481&quot;/&gt; During the next two decades, culminating in the [[Siege of Constantinople (717-718)]], the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] progressively occupied the borderlands of the Byzantine Empire. An editor of John's works, Father [[Michel Le Quien|Le Quien]], has shown that John was already a monk at Mar Saba before the dispute over iconoclasm, explained below.&lt;ref name=catholic/&gt;

In the early 8th century AD, [[Iconoclasm (Byzantine)|iconoclasm]], a movement opposed to the veneration of icons, gained acceptance in the [[Byzantine]] court. In 726, despite the protests of [[Patriarch Germanus I of Constantinople|Germanus]], [[List of Ecumenical Patriarchs of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] (who had forced his predecessor, [[Theodosius III]], to abdicate and himself assumed the throne in 717 immediately before the great siege) issued his first edict against the [[veneration]] of images and their exhibition in public places.&lt;ref name=cathen&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Connor|first=John Bonaventure|title=St. John Damascene|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08459b.htm|website=The Catholic Encyclopedia|publisher=New Advent|accessdate=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All agree that John of Damascus undertook a spirited defence of holy images in three separate publications. The earliest of these works, his ''Apologetic Treatises against those Decrying the Holy Images'', secured his reputation. He not only attacked the Byzantine emperor, but adopted a simplified style that allowed the controversy to be followed by the common people, stirring rebellion among the iconoclasts. Decades after his death, John's writings would play an important role during the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] (787), which convened to settle the icon dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cambridge Dictionary of Christian Theology|last=Cunningham|first=M.

S.|editor-last3=Kilby|editor-first3=K. |via=Credo Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John's biography recounts at least one episode deemed improbable or legendary.&lt;ref name=catholic/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jamesonp24&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Jameson|2008|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leo III reportedly sent forged documents to the caliph which implicated John in a plot to attack [[Damascus]]. The caliph then ordered John's right hand be cut off and hung up in public view. Some days afterwards, John asked for the restitution of his hand, and prayed fervently to the ''[[Theotokos]]'' before her icon: thereupon, his hand is said to have been miraculously restored.&lt;ref name=catholic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=66|title=St. John of Damascus|author=Catholic Online|website=catholic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In gratitude for this miraculous healing, he attached a silver hand to the icon, which thereafter became known as the &quot;Three-handed&quot;, or [[Trojeručica|''Tricheirousa'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Louth|2002|pp=17, 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; That icon is now located in the Helandarion monastery of the [[Mount Athos|Holy Mountain]].

==Last days==

John died in 749 as a revered Father of the Church, and is recognized as a [[saint]]. He is sometimes called the last of the [[Church Fathers]] by the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. In 1890 he was declared a [[Doctor of the Church]] by [[Pope Leo XIII]].

==Veneration==

When the name of John of Damascus was inserted in the [[General Roman Calendar]] in 1890, it was assigned to 27 March. The feast day was moved in 1969 to the day of John's death, 4 December, the day on which his feast day is celebrated also in the [[Byzantine Rite]] calendar,&lt;ref&gt;Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1969), pp. 109, 119; cf. [http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article?eu=393924 Britannica Concise Encyclopedia]
&lt;/ref&gt; Lutheran Commemorations,&lt;ref&gt;Kinnaman, Scot A. ''Lutheranism 101'' (Concordia Publish House, St. Louis, 2010) p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Anglican Communion and Episcopal Church.&lt;ref&gt;Lesser Feasts and Fasts, 2006 (Church Publishing, 2006), pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1884 choral work ''John of Damascus'' (&quot;A Russian Requiem&quot;), Op. 1, for four-part mixed chorus and orchestra, by Russian composer [[Sergei Taneyev]], is dedicated to Saint John.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Russian Romantics {{!}} Brightmusic Chamber Ensemble|url=https://www.brightmusic.org/concert/russian-romantics|access-date=2020-09-19|website=www.brightmusic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of works==
[[File:St john damascus.gif|thumb|right|upright|John of Damascus Greek [[icon]]]]
[[File:Ioannis Damasceni Opera.tif|thumb|upright|''Ioannis Damasceni Opera'' (1603)]]
Besides his purely textual works, many of which are listed below, John of Damascus also composed hymns, perfecting the [[Canon (hymnography)|canon]], a structured hymn form used in [[Byzantine Rite]] liturgies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shahidp195&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Shahîd|2009|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early works===
* Three ''[[Apologetic Treatises against those Decrying the Holy Images]]'' – These treatises were among his earliest expositions in response to the edict by the Byzantine Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]], banning the veneration or exhibition of holy images.&lt;ref&gt;''St. John Damascene on Holy Images, Followed by Three Sermons on the Assumption'' – Eng. transl. by Mary H. Allies, London, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teachings and dogmatic works===
* ''[[Fountain of Knowledge]]'' or ''The Fountain of Wisdom'', is divided into three parts:
*#''Philosophical Chapters'' (''Kefálea filosofiká'') – commonly called &quot;Dialectic&quot;, it deals mostly with logic, its primary purpose being to prepare the reader for a better understanding of the rest of the book.
*# ''Concerning Heresy'' (''Perì eréseon'') – the last chapter of this part (Chapter 101) deals with the ''Heresy of the Ishmaelites''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orthodoxinfo.com/general/stjohn_islam.aspx|title=St. John of Damascus: Critique of Islam|website=orthodoxinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike earlier sections devoted to other heresies, which are disposed of succinctly in just a few lines, this chapter runs into several pages. It constitutes one of the first Christian refutations of [[Islam]]. One of the most dominant translations is his polemical work ''Peri haireseon'' translated from Greek into Latin. His manuscript is one of the first Orthodox Christian refutations of Islam which has influenced the Western Catholic Church's attitude. It was among the first sources representing the Prophet of Islam [[Muhammad]] to the West as &quot;false prophet,&quot; and &quot;Antichrist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sbaihat, Ahlam (2015), &quot;Stereotypes associated with real prototypes of the prophet of Islam's name till the 19th century&quot;. Jordan Journal of Modern Languages and Literature Vol. 7, No. 1, 2015, pp. 21–38. http://journals.yu.edu.jo/jjmll/Issues/vol7no12015/Nom2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*# ''[[An Exact Exposition of the Orthodox Faith]]'' (''Ékdosis akribès tēs Orthodóxou Písteōs'') – a summary of the dogmatic writings of the [[Early Church Fathers]]. This writing was the first work of [[systematic theology]] in [[Eastern Christianity]] and an important influence on later Scholastic works.&lt;ref name=retrome&gt;{{cite book|last=Ines|first=Angeli Murzaku|title=Returning home to Rome: the Basilian monks of Grottaferrata in Albania|year=2009|publisher=Analekta Kryptoferri|location=00046 Grottaferrata (Roma) – Italy|isbn=978-88-89345-04-7|pages=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2EPFRL-XJQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Teaching on Islam====
As stated above, in the final chapter of ''Concerning Heresy,'' John mentions Islam. He is one of the first known Christian critics of Islam. John claims that Muslims were once worshipers of Aphrodite who followed after Mohammad because of his &quot;seeming show of piety,&quot; and that Mohammad himself read the Bible and, &quot;likewise, it seems,&quot; spoke to an Arian monk that taught him Arianism instead of Christianity. John also claims to have read the Quran, or at least parts of it, as he criticizes the Quran for saying that the Virgin Mary was the sister of Moses and Aaron and that Jesus was not crucified but brought alive into heaven. John further claims to have spoken to Muslims about Mohammad. He uses the [[Nosism|plural &quot;we&quot;]], whether in reference to himself, or to a group of Christians that he belonged to who spoke to the Muslims, or in reference to Christians in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=St. John of Damascus: Critique of Islam|url=http://orthodoxinfo.com/general/stjohn_islam.aspx|access-date=2020-07-21|website=orthodoxinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

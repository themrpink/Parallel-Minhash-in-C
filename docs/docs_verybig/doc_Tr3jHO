=== Aquifers versus aquitards ===
Aquifers are typically saturated regions of the subsurface that produce an economically feasible quantity of water to a well or [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] (e.g., sand and [[gravel]] or fractured [[bedrock]] often make good aquifer materials).

An aquitard is a zone within the Earth that restricts the flow of groundwater from one aquifer to another. A completely impermeable aquitard is called an ''aquiclude'' or ''aquifuge''. Aquitards comprise layers of either clay or non-porous rock with low [[hydraulic conductivity]].

In mountainous areas (or near rivers in mountainous areas), the main aquifers are typically unconsolidated [[alluvium]], composed of mostly horizontal layers of materials deposited by water processes (rivers and streams), which in cross-section (looking at a two-dimensional slice of the aquifer) appear to be layers of alternating coarse and fine materials. Coarse materials, because of the high energy needed to move them, tend to be found nearer the source (mountain fronts or rivers), whereas the fine-grained material will make it farther from the source (to the flatter parts of the basin or overbank areas—sometimes called the pressure area). Since there are less fine-grained deposits near the source, this is a place where aquifers are often unconfined (sometimes called the forebay area), or in hydraulic communication with the land surface.

{{see also|Hydraulic conductivity|Storativity}}

=== Confined versus unconfined ===
There are two end members in the spectrum of types of aquifers; ''confined'' and ''unconfined'' (with semi-confined being in between). ''Unconfined'' aquifers are sometimes also called ''water table'' or ''phreatic'' aquifers, because their upper boundary is the [[water table]] or phreatic surface. (See [[Biscayne Aquifer]].) Typically (but not always) the shallowest aquifer at a given location is unconfined, meaning it does not have a confining layer (an aquitard or aquiclude) between it and the surface. The term &quot;perched&quot; refers to ground water accumulating above a low-permeability unit or strata, such as a clay layer. This term is generally used to refer to a small local area of ground water that occurs at an elevation higher than a regionally extensive aquifer. The difference between perched and unconfined aquifers is their size (perched is smaller). Confined aquifers are aquifers that are overlain by a confining layer, often made up of clay. The confining layer might offer some protection from surface contamination.

If the distinction between confined and unconfined is not clear geologically (i.e., if it is not known if a clear confining layer exists, or if the geology is more complex, e.g., a fractured bedrock aquifer), the value of storativity returned from an [[aquifer test]] can be used to determine it (although aquifer tests in unconfined aquifers should be interpreted differently than confined ones). Confined aquifers have very low [[Specific storage|storativity]] values (much less than 0.01, and as little as {{10^|-5}}), which means that the aquifer is storing water using the mechanisms of aquifer matrix expansion and the compressibility of water, which typically are both quite small quantities. Unconfined aquifers have storativities (typically then called [[Specific storage|specific yield]]) greater than 0.01 (1% of bulk volume); they release water from storage by the mechanism of actually draining the pores of the aquifer, releasing relatively large amounts of water (up to the drainable [[Hydrogeology#Porosity|porosity]] of the aquifer material, or the minimum volumetric [[water content]]).
{{see also|Porosity|Storativity}}

=== Isotropic versus anisotropic ===
In [[Isotropy|isotropic]] aquifers or aquifer layers the hydraulic conductivity (K) is equal for flow in all directions, while in [[Anisotropy|anisotropic]] conditions it differs, notably in horizontal (Kh) and vertical (Kv) sense.

Semi-confined aquifers with one or more aquitards work as an anisotropic system, even when the separate layers are isotropic, because the compound Kh and Kv values are different (see [[Transmissibility (fluid)|hydraulic transmissivity]] and [[hydraulic conductivity#Resistance|hydraulic resistance]]).

===Porous versus karst===

To properly manage an aquifer its properties must be understood. Many properties must be known to predict how an aquifer will respond to rainfall, drought, pumping, and [[Pollution#Forms of pollution|contamination]]. Where and how much water enters the groundwater from rainfall and snowmelt? How fast and what direction does the groundwater travel? How much water leaves the ground as springs. How much water can be sustainably pumped out? How quickly will a contamination incident reach a well or spring? [[Groundwater model|Computer models]] can be used to test how accurately the understanding of the aquifer properties matches the actual aquifer performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;FieldMethodsGeoHydrogeo&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1= Assaad |first1= Fakhry |last2=LaMoreaux |first2=Philip |last3=Hughes |first3=Travis |date=2004 |title=Field methods for geologists and hydrogeologists |location=Berlin, Germany |publisher= Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg |isbn= 978-3-540-40882-6 |doi=10.1007/978-3-662-05438-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|192–193, 233–237}} Environmental regulations require sites with potential sources of contamination to demonstrate that the [[Hydrology#Groundwater|hydrology]] has been [[Environmental monitoring|characterized]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FieldMethodsGeoHydrogeo&quot; /&gt;{{rp|3}}

Porous aquifers typically occur in sand and [[sandstone]]. Porous aquifer properties depend on the [[depositional environment|depositional sedimentary environment]] and later natural cementation of the sand grains. The environment where a sand body was deposited controls the orientation of the sand grains, the horizontal and vertical variations, and the distribution of shale layers. Even thin shale layers are important barriers to groundwater flow.

====Karst====
[[File:MammothCaveNPS.jpg|thumb|left |alt=Several people in a jon boat on a river inside a cave. |Water in karst aquifers flows through open conduits where water flows as underground streams]]

[[Karst]] aquifers typically develop in [[limestone]]. Surface water containing natural [[carbonic acid]] moves down into small fissures in limestone. This carbonic acid gradually dissolves limestone thereby enlarging the fissures. The enlarged fissures allow a larger quantity of water to enter which leads to a progressive enlargement of openings. Abundant small openings store a large quantity of water. The larger openings create a conduit system that drains the aquifer to springs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dreybrodt |first=Wolfgang |date=1988 |title=Processes in karst systems: physics, chemistry, and geology |volume=4 |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer |pages=2–3 |isbn=978-3-642-83354-0 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-83352-6 |series=Springer Series in Physical Environment }}&lt;/ref&gt; Characterization of karst aquifers requires field exploration to locate [[sinkhole|sinkholes, swallets]], [[Losing stream|sinking streams]], and [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]] in addition to studying [[geologic map]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;DelineationGrdwtrBasinsTaylor&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Charles |date=1997 |title=Delineation of ground-water basins and recharge areas for municipal water-supply springs in a karst aquifer system in the Elizabethtown area, Northern Kentucky |url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/wri/1996/4254/report.pdf |location=Denver, Colorado |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |series=Water-Resources Investigations Report 96-4254 |doi=10.3133/wri964254 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} Conventional hydrogeologic methods such as aquifer tests and potentiometric mapping are insufficient to characterize the complexity of karst aquifers.

====Transboundary aquifer====

When an aquifer transcends international boundaries, the term ''transboundary aquifer'' applies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=International Waters |website=United Nations Development Programme |url=http://www.undp.org/gef/05/portfolio/iw.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090127055412/http://www.undp.org/gef/05/portfolio/iw.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Transboundariness is a concept, a measure and an approach first introduced in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sanchez |first1=Rosario |last2=Eckstein |first2=Gabriel |author-link2=Gabriel Eckstein|date=2017 |title=Aquifers Shared Between Mexico and the United States: Management Perspectives and Their Transboundary Nature |journal=Groundwater |volume=55 |number=4 |pages=495–505 |doi=10.1111/gwat.12533 |pmid=28493280 |url=https://transboundary.tamu.edu/media/1368/sanchez_et_al-2017-groundwater.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relevance of this approach is that the physical features of the aquifers become just additional variables among the broad spectrum of considerations of the transboundary nature of an aquifer: 

* social (population);
* economic (groundwater productivity);
* political (as transboundary);
* available research or data;
* water quality and quantity;
* other issues governing the agenda (security, trade, immigration and so on).

The discussion changes from the traditional question of “is the aquifer transboundary?” to “how transboundary is the aquifer?”.

The socio-economic and political contexts effectively overwhelm the aquifer's physical features adding its corresponding geostrategic value (its transboundariness)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://transboundary.tamu.edu/media/1385/2018_awras_impact.pdf|title = Transboundary Groundwater|journal = Water Resources Impact|date = May 2018|volume = 20|number = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criteria proposed by this approach attempt to encapsulate and measure all potential variables that play a role in defining the transboundary nature of an aquifer and its multidimensional boundaries.

== Groundwater in rock formations ==
[[File:Major US Aquifers by Rock Type.jpg|thumb|right|Map of major US aquifers by rock type]]
Groundwater may exist in ''underground rivers'' (e.g., [[cave]]s where water flows freely underground). This may occur in [[erosion|eroded]] [[limestone]] areas known as [[karst topography]], which make up only a small percentage of Earth's area. More usual is that the pore spaces of rocks in the subsurface are simply saturated with water—like a kitchen sponge—which can be [[pump]]ed out for agricultural, industrial, or municipal uses.

If a rock unit of low [[porosity]] is highly fractured, it can also make a good aquifer (via [[Fracture (geology)|fissure]] flow), provided the rock has a hydraulic conductivity sufficient to facilitate movement of water. Porosity is important, but, ''alone'', it does not determine a rock's ability to act as an aquifer. Areas of the [[Deccan Traps]] (a [[basalt]]ic lava) in west central India are good examples of rock formations with high porosity but low permeability, which makes them poor aquifers. Similarly, the micro-porous (Upper [[Cretaceous]]) [[Chalk Group]] of south east England, although having a reasonably high porosity, has a low grain-to-grain permeability, with its good water-yielding characteristics mostly due to micro-fracturing and fissuring.

== Human dependence on groundwater ==

[[File:Crops Kansas AST 20010624.jpg|thumb|right|[[center pivot irrigation|Center-pivot irrigated]] fields in [[Kansas]] covering hundreds of square miles watered by the [[Ogallala Aquifer]]]]
Most land areas on [[Earth]] have some form of aquifer underlying them, sometimes at significant depths. In some cases, these aquifers are rapidly being depleted by the human population.

Fresh-water aquifers, especially those with limited recharge by snow or rain, also known as [[meteoric water]], can be over-exploited and depending on the local [[hydrogeology]], may draw in non-potable water or saltwater intrusion from hydraulically connected aquifers or surface water bodies. This can be a serious problem, especially in coastal areas and other areas where aquifer pumping is excessive. In some areas, the ground water can become [[Arsenic contamination of groundwater|contaminated by arsenic]] and other mineral poisons.

Aquifers are critically important in human habitation and agriculture. Deep aquifers in arid areas have long been water sources for irrigation (see Ogallala below). Many villages and even large cities draw their water supply from wells in aquifers.

Municipal, irrigation, and industrial water supplies are provided through large wells. Multiple wells for one water supply source are termed &quot;wellfields&quot;, which may withdraw water from confined or unconfined aquifers. Using ground water from deep, confined aquifers provides more protection from surface water contamination. Some wells, termed &quot;collector wells&quot;, are specifically designed to induce infiltration of surface (usually river) water.

Aquifers that provide sustainable fresh groundwater to urban areas and for agricultural irrigation are typically close to the ground surface (within a couple of hundred metres) and have some recharge by fresh water. This recharge is typically from rivers or meteoric water (precipitation) that percolates into the aquifer through overlying unsaturated materials.

Occasionally, sedimentary or [[Fossil water|&quot;fossil&quot;]] aquifers are used to provide irrigation and drinking water to urban areas. In Libya, for example, [[Muammar Gaddafi|Muammar Gaddafi's]] [[Great Manmade River]] project has pumped large amounts of groundwater from aquifers beneath the Sahara to populous areas near the coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scholl&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Scholl |first=Adam |title=Map Room: Hidden Waters |url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/winter2012/map-room |publisher=World Policy journal |access-date=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though this has saved Libya money over the alternative, desalination, the aquifers are likely to run dry in 60 to 100 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scholl&quot;/&gt; Aquifer depletion has been cited as one of the causes of the food price rises of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Lester. [https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/01/10/the_great_food_crisis_of_2011 &quot;The Great Food Crisis of 2011.&quot;] ''[[Foreign Policy Magazine]]'', 10 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsidence ==
In unconsolidated aquifers, groundwater is produced from pore spaces between particles of gravel, sand, and silt. If the aquifer is confined by low-permeability layers, the reduced water pressure in the sand and gravel causes slow drainage of water from the adjoining confining layers. If these confining layers are composed of compressible silt or clay, the loss of water to the aquifer reduces the water pressure in the confining layer, causing it to compress from the weight of overlying geologic materials. In severe cases, this compression can be observed on the ground surface as [[subsidence]]. Unfortunately, much of the subsidence from groundwater extraction is permanent (elastic rebound is small). Thus, the subsidence is not only permanent, but the compressed aquifer has a permanently reduced capacity to hold water.

== Saltwater intrusion ==
{{main|Saltwater intrusion}}
Aquifers near the coast have a lens of freshwater near the surface and denser seawater under freshwater. Seawater penetrates the aquifer diffusing in from the ocean and is denser than freshwater. For porous (i.e., sandy) aquifers near the coast, the thickness of freshwater atop saltwater is about {{convert|40|ft|m|0|order=flip}} for every {{convert|1|ft|m|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} of freshwater head above [[sea level]]. This relationship is called the [[Ghyben-Herzberg equation]]. If too much ground water is pumped near the coast, salt-water may intrude into freshwater aquifers causing contamination of potable freshwater supplies. Many coastal aquifers, such as the [[Biscayne Aquifer]] near Miami and the New Jersey Coastal Plain aquifer, have problems with saltwater intrusion as a result of overpumping and sea level rise.

== Salination ==
[[File:aquifersalt.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram of a [[Hydrology (agriculture)|water balance]] of the aquifer]]
Aquifers in surface [[irrigation|irrigated]] areas in semi-arid zones with reuse of the unavoidable irrigation water losses [[Groundwater recharge|percolating]] down into the underground by supplemental irrigation from wells run the risk of [[soil salination|salination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=ILRI |title=Effectiveness and Social/Environmental Impacts of Irrigation Projects: a Review |series=In: Annual Report 1988 of the International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI) |year=1989 |pages=18–34 |location=Wageningen, The Netherlands |url=http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surface irrigation water normally contains salts in the order of {{val|0.5|u=g/l}} or more and the annual irrigation requirement is in the order of {{val|10000|u=m3/ha|fmt=commas}} or more so the annual import of salt is in the order of {{val|5000|u=kg/ha|fmt=commas}} or more.&lt;ref&gt;ILRI (2003), ''Drainage for Agriculture: Drainage and hydrology/salinity - water and salt balances''.

Download from : [http://www.waterlog.info/faqs.htm], or directly as PDF : [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/balances.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the influence of continuous evaporation, the salt concentration of the aquifer water may increase continually and eventually cause an [[Environmental impact of irrigation|environmental]] problem.

For [[Soil salinity control|salinity control]] in such a case, annually an amount of drainage water is to be discharged from the aquifer by means of a subsurface [[Drainage system (agriculture)|drainage system]] and disposed of through a safe outlet. The drainage system may be ''horizontal'' (i.e. using pipes, [[tile drainage|tile drains]] or ditches) or ''vertical'' ([[drainage by wells]]). To estimate the drainage requirement, the use of a [[groundwater model]] with an agro-hydro-salinity component may be instrumental, e.g. [[SahysMod]].

Aquifer depletion is a problem in some areas, and is especially critical in northern [[Africa]], for example the [[Great Manmade River]] project of [[Libya]]. However, new methods of groundwater management such as artificial recharge and injection of surface waters during seasonal wet periods has extended the life of many freshwater aquifers, especially in the United States.

The [[Ogallala Aquifer]] of the central United States is one of the world's great aquifers, but in places it is being rapidly [[overdrafting|depleted]] by growing municipal use, and continuing agricultural use. This huge aquifer, which underlies portions of eight states, contains primarily [[fossil water]] from the time of the last [[Quaternary glaciation|glaciation]]. Annual recharge, in the more arid parts of the aquifer, is estimated to total only about 10 percent of annual withdrawals. According to a 2013 report by research hydrologist Leonard F. Konikow&lt;ref name=KonikowUSGSjan2013&gt;{{cite report |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2013/5079/SIR2013-5079.pdf |title=Groundwater Depletion in the United States (1900–2008) |series=Scientific Investigations Report |number=2013–5079 |pages=63 |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey |location=Reston, [[Virginia|VA]] |first=Leonard F. |last=Konikow}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS), the depletion between 2001 and 2008, inclusive, is about 32 percent of the cumulative depletion during the entire 20th century (Konikow 2013:22).&quot;&lt;ref name=KonikowUSGSjan2013 /&gt; In the United States, the biggest users of water from aquifers include agricultural irrigation and oil and coal extraction.&lt;ref name=depletion&gt;{{cite news |title=Drop in U.S. underground water levels has accelerated: USGS |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/20/us-usa-water-idUSBRE94J0Y920130520 |location=Washington, DC |first=Deborah |last=Zabarenko |date=20 May 2013 |work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Cumulative total groundwater depletion in the United States accelerated in the late 1940s and continued at an almost steady linear rate through the end of the century.

An example of a significant and sustainable carbonate aquifer is the [[Edwards Aquifer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edwardsaquifer.org/ |title=Edwards Aquifer Authority |publisher=Edwardsaquifer.org |access-date=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in central [[Texas]]. This carbonate aquifer has historically been providing high quality water for nearly 2 million people, and even today, is full because of tremendous recharge from a number of area streams, rivers and [[lake]]s. The primary risk to this resource is human development over the recharge areas.

Discontinuous sand bodies at the base of the [[McMurray Formation]] in the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] region of northeastern [[Alberta]], Canada, are commonly referred to as the [[McMurray Formation#Hydrogeology|Basal Water Sand (BWS) aquifers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Total2005&quot;&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.total-ep-canada.com/upstream/documents/application/CR_4_Groundwater_Report.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222021/http://www.total-ep-canada.com/upstream/documents/application/CR_4_Groundwater_Report.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 December 2013 |title=Joslyn North Mine Project: Environmental Impact Assessment Hydrologeology |location=[[Edmonton]], Alberta |date=December 2005 |publisher=Deer Creek Energy |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saturated with water, they are confined beneath impermeable [[bitumen]]-saturated sands that are exploited to recover bitumen for [[synthetic crude]] oil production. Where they are deep-lying and recharge occurs from underlying [[Devonian]] [[formation (geology)|formations]] they are saline, and where they are shallow and recharged by [[meteoric water|surface water]] they are non-saline. The BWS typically pose problems for the recovery of bitumen, whether by [[open-pit mining]] or by ''in situ'' methods such as [[steam-assisted gravity drainage]] (SAGD), and in some areas they are targets for waste-water injection.&lt;ref name=Barson&gt;Barson, D., Bachu, S. and Esslinger, P. 2001.

'''Atmospheric pressure''', also known as '''barometric pressure''' (after the [[barometer]]), is the [[pressure]] within the [[atmosphere of Earth]]. The [[Atmosphere (unit)|standard atmosphere]] (symbol: atm) is a unit of pressure defined as {{convert|101325|Pa|hPa mbar|abbr=on|lk=on}}, which is equivalent to 760{{nbsp}}[[millimeter of mercury|mm Hg]], 29.9212{{nbsp}}[[inch of mercury|inches{{nbsp}}Hg]], or 14.696{{nbsp}}[[pounds per square inch|psi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;icao&quot;&gt;International Civil Aviation Organization. ''Manual of the [[International Standard Atmosphere|ICAO Standard Atmosphere]]'', Doc 7488-CD, Third Edition, 1993. {{ISBN|92-9194-004-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The atm unit is roughly equivalent to the mean sea-level atmospheric pressure on Earth, that is, the Earth's atmospheric pressure at sea level is approximately 1 atm.

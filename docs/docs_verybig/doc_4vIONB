'''Jean-Baptiste le Rond d'Alembert'''&lt;ref&gt;His last name is also written as '''D'Alembert''' in English.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|æ|l|ə|m|ˈ|b|ɛər}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/d'alembert &quot;Alembert, d'&quot;]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|ʒɑ̃ batist lə ʁɔ̃ dalɑ̃bɛːʁ|lang}}; 16 November 1717 – 29 October 1783) was a French mathematician, [[mechanics|mechanician]], [[physicist]], philosopher, and [[music theorist]]. Until 1759 he was, together with [[Denis Diderot]], a co-editor of the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''. [[D'Alembert's formula]] for obtaining solutions to the [[wave equation]] is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Alembert|1747a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Alembert|1747b}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Alembert|1750}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The wave equation is sometimes referred to as [[d'Alembert's equation]], and the [[Fundamental theorem of algebra]] is named after d'Alembert in French.

==Early years==
Born in Paris, d'Alembert was the [[illegitimate child|natural son]] of the writer [[Claudine Guérin de Tencin]] and the chevalier [[Louis-Camus Destouches]], an [[artillery]] officer. Destouches was abroad at the time of d'Alembert's birth. Days after birth his mother left him on the steps of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Saint-Jean-le-Rond de Paris|fr|3=Église Saint-Jean-le-Rond de Paris}} church. According to custom, he was named after the [[patron saint]] of the church. D'Alembert was placed in an [[orphanage]] for [[child abandonment|foundling]] children, but his father found him and placed him with the wife of a [[glazier]], Madame Rousseau, with whom he lived for nearly 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1906|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She gave him little encouragement. When he told her of some discovery he had made or something he had written she generally replied,

{{quote|You will never be anything but a philosopher - and what is that but an ass who plagues himself all his life, that he may be talked about after he is dead.&lt;ref&gt;''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge'', Vol I, London, Charles Knight, 1847, p.417.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Destouches secretly paid for the education of Jean le Rond, but did not want his [[Paternity (law)|paternity]] officially recognised.

==Studies and adult life==
D'Alembert first attended a private school. The chevalier Destouches left d'Alembert an [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]] of 1200 [[French livre|livres]] on his death in 1726. Under the influence of the Destouches family, at the age of 12 d'Alembert entered the [[Jansenism|Jansenist]] [[Collège des Quatre-Nations]] (the institution was also known under the name &quot;Collège Mazarin&quot;). Here he studied philosophy, law, and the arts, graduating as ''[[Bachelor of Arts|baccalauréat en arts]]'' in 1735.

In his later life, d'Alembert scorned the [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] principles he had been taught by the [[Jansenism|Jansenists]]: &quot;physical promotion, innate ideas and the vortices&quot;. The Jansenists steered d'Alembert toward an [[ecclesiastical]] career, attempting to deter him from pursuits such as poetry and [[mathematics]]. Theology was, however, &quot;rather unsubstantial fodder&quot; for d'Alembert. He entered law school for two years, and was nominated ''[[Lawyer|avocat]]'' in 1738.

He was also interested in medicine and mathematics. Jean was first registered under the name &quot;Daremberg&quot;, but later changed it to &quot;d'Alembert&quot;. The name &quot;d'Alembert&quot; was proposed by [[Frederick the Great| Frederick the Great of Prussia]] for a suspected (but non-existent) moon of Venus.&lt;ref&gt;Ley, Willy. 1952. Article &quot;Moon of Venus&quot; in ''Galaxy Science Fiction July 1952''. MDP Publishing Galaxy Science Fiction Digital Series, 2016. Retrieved from [https://books.google.com/books?id=ykikDQAAQBAJ  Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Alembert - Nouvelles expériences sur la résistance des fluides, 1777 - 14723.jpg|thumb|''Nouvelles expériences sur la résistance des fluides'']]
{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Scientists}}
In July 1739 he made his first contribution to the field of mathematics, pointing out the errors he had detected in ''[[Analyse démontrée]]'' (published 1708 by [[Charles-René Reynaud]]) in a communication addressed to the [[French Academy of Sciences|Académie des Sciences]]. At the time ''L'analyse démontrée'' was a standard work, which d'Alembert himself had used to study the [[foundations of mathematics]]. D'Alembert was also a [[Latin]] scholar of some note and worked in the latter part of his life on a superb translation of [[Tacitus]], for which he received wide praise including that of [[Denis Diderot]].

In 1740, he submitted his second [[science|scientific]] work from the field of [[fluid dynamics|fluid mechanics]] ''Mémoire sur la réfraction des corps solides'', which was recognised by [[Alexis Clairault|Clairaut]]. In this work d'Alembert theoretically explained [[refraction]].

In 1741, after several failed attempts, d'Alembert was elected into the Académie des Sciences.  He was later elected to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy]] in 1746&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hankins|1990|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1748.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27alembert%27%29| title= Library and Archive Catalogue| publisher = Royal Society| accessdate= 3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1743, he published his most famous work, ''Traité de dynamique'', in which he developed his own [[D'Alembert's principle|laws of motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Alembert|1743}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the ''Encyclopédie'' was organised in the late 1740s, d'Alembert was engaged as co-editor (for mathematics and science) with Diderot, and served until a series of crises temporarily interrupted the publication in 1757. He authored over a thousand articles for it, including the famous ''[[Preliminary Discourse]]''. D'Alembert &quot;abandoned the foundation of [[Materialism]]&quot;&lt;ref name=lange&gt;[[Friedrich Albert Lange]], ''[[History of Materialism and Critique of its Present Importance]]'', &quot;[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and Materialism&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; when he &quot;doubted whether there exists outside us anything corresponding to what we suppose we see.&quot;&lt;ref name=lange/&gt; In this way, d'Alembert agreed with the [[Idealism|Idealist]] [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] and anticipated the [[transcendental idealism]] of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In 1752, he wrote about what is now called [[D'Alembert's paradox]]: that the [[Drag (physics)|drag]] on a body immersed in an [[viscosity|inviscid]], [[incompressible]] [[fluid]] is zero.

In 1754, d'Alembert was elected a member of the [[Académie des sciences]], of which he became Permanent Secretary on 9 April 1772.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academie-francaise.fr/immortels/base/academiciens/fiche.asp?param=219 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531092038/http://www.academie-francaise.fr/immortels/base/academiciens/fiche.asp?param=219 |date=31 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1757, an article by d'Alembert in the seventh volume of the ''Encyclopedia'' suggested that the Geneva clergymen had moved from [[Calvinism]] to pure [[Socinianism]], basing this on information provided by [[Voltaire]]. The Pastors of Geneva were indignant, and appointed a committee to answer these charges. Under pressure from [[Jacob Vernes]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and others, d'Alembert eventually made the excuse that he considered anyone who did not accept the Church of Rome to be a Socinianist, and that was all he meant, and he abstained from further work on the encyclopaedia following his response to the critique.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith Richardson|1858|pages=8–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1781.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music theories==
D'Alembert's first exposure to music theory was in 1749 when he was called upon to review a ''Mémoire'' submitted to the Académie by [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]]. This article, written in conjunction with [[Diderot]], would later form the basis of Rameau's 1750 treatise ''Démonstration du principe de l'harmonie''. D'Alembert wrote a glowing review praising the author's deductive character as an ideal scientific model. He saw in Rameau's music theories support for his own scientific ideas, a fully systematic method with a strongly deductive synthetic structure.

Two years later, in 1752, d'Alembert attempted a fully comprehensive survey of Rameau's works in his ''Eléments de musique théorique et pratique suivant les principes de M. Rameau''.&lt;ref name=&quot;CT&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Christensen|1989|p=415}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Emphasizing Rameau's main claim that music was a mathematical science that had a single principle from which could be deduced all the elements and rules of musical practice as well as the explicit Cartesian methodology employed, d'Alembert helped to popularise the work of the composer and advertise his own theories.&lt;ref name=&quot;CT&quot;/&gt; He claims to have &quot;clarified, developed, and simplified&quot; the principles of Rameau, arguing that the single idea of the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|corps sonore|fr}}'' was not sufficient to derive the entirety of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernard|1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt; D'Alembert instead claimed that three principles would be necessary to generate the major [[musical mode]], the minor mode, and the identity of [[octaves]]. Because he was not a musician, however, d'Alembert misconstrued the finer points of Rameau's thinking, changing and removing concepts that would not fit neatly into his understanding of music.

Although initially grateful, Rameau eventually turned on d'Alembert while voicing his increasing dissatisfaction with [[J. J. Rousseau]]'s ''Encyclopédie'' articles on music.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', 2nd ed., s.v. &quot;Alembert, Jean le Rond d'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a series of bitter exchanges between the men and contributed to the end of d'Alembert and Rameau's friendship. A long preliminary discourse d'Alembert wrote for the 1762 edition of his ''Elémens'' attempted to summarise the dispute and act as a final rebuttal.

D'Alembert also discussed various aspects of the state of music in his celebrated ''Discours préliminaire'' of [[Diderot]]'s ''Encyclopédie''. D'Alembert claims that, compared to the other arts, music, &quot;which speaks simultaneously to the imagination and the senses,&quot; has not been able to represent or imitate as much of reality because of the &quot;lack of sufficient inventiveness and resourcefulness of those who cultivate it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Alembert|1995|p=38}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted musical expression to deal with all physical sensations rather than merely the passions alone. D'Alembert believed that modern ([[Baroque]]) music had only achieved perfection in his age, as there existed no classical [[Greeks|Greek]] models to study and imitate. He claimed that &quot;time destroyed all models which the ancients may have left us in this genre.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Alembert|1995|p=69}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He praises Rameau as &quot;that manly, courageous, and fruitful genius&quot; who picked up the slack left by [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] in the French musical arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Alembert|1995|p=100}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
D'Alembert was a participant in several Parisian [[Salon (gathering)|salons]], particularly those of [[Marie Thérèse Rodet Geoffrin]], of the [[Madame du Deffand|marquise du Deffand]] and of [[Julie de Lespinasse]]. D'Alembert became infatuated with [[Jeanne Julie Éléonore de Lespinasse|Mlle de Lespinasse]], and eventually took up residence with her.

==Death==
He suffered bad health for many years and his death was as the result of a [[urinary bladder]] illness. As a known [[Infidel|unbeliever]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Israel|2011|p=115}}: &quot;D'Alembert, though privately an atheist and materialist, presented the respectable public face of 'la philosophie' in the French capital while remaining henceforth uninterruptedly aligned with Voltaire.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Force|Popkin|1990|p=167}}: &quot;Unlike the French and English deists, and unlike the scientific atheists such as Diderot, d'Alembert, and d'Holbach, such English scientists as David Hartley and Joseph Priestley presented their scientific theories as evidence for their scriptural views.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Horowitz|1999|pages=52–53}}: &quot;In positive theory there was a wide divergence between Voltaire's panpsychic deism and Diderot's physiological materialism, or d'Alembert's agnostic positivism and Helvetius' sociological materialism.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; D'Alembert was buried in a common [[unmarked grave]].

==Legacy==
In France, the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] is known as the d'Alembert/[[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] theorem, as an error in d'Alembert's proof was caught by Gauss.

He also created his [[ratio test]], a test to see if a [[series (mathematics)|series]] converges.

The [[D'Alembert operator]], which first arose in D'Alembert's analysis of vibrating strings, plays an important role in modern theoretical physics.

While he made great strides in mathematics and physics, d'Alembert is also famously known for incorrectly arguing in ''Croix ou Pile'' that the [[probability]] of a coin landing heads increased for every time that it came up tails. In gambling, the strategy of decreasing one's bet the more one wins and increasing one's bet the more one loses is therefore called ''the [[D'Alembert system]]'', a type of [[Martingale (betting system)|martingale]].

In [[South Australia]], a small inshore island in south-western [[Spencer Gulf]] was named'' Ile d'Alembert'' by the French explorer, [[Nicolas Baudin]] during his [[Nicolas Baudin's expedition to Australia|expedition to New Holland]]. The island is better known by the alternative English name of [[Lipson Island]]. The island is a conservation park and seabird rookery.

==Fictional portrayal==
[[Diderot]] portrayed d'Alembert in ''Le rêve de D'Alembert'' (''[[D'Alembert's Dream]]''), written after the two men had become estranged. It depicts d'Alembert ill in bed, conducting a debate on materialist philosophy in his sleep.

''D'Alembert's Principle'', a 1996 novel by [[Andrew Crumey]], takes its title from [[D'Alembert's principle]] in physics. Its first part describes d'Alembert's life and his infatuation with [[Julie de Lespinasse]].

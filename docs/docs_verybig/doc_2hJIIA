The public [[Transport network|transportation system]] of the Katowice and [[Metropolitan Association of Upper Silesia|Upper Silesian Metropolis]] consists of four branches—buses, trams and [[Trolleybus]]es united in [[Zarząd Transportu Metropolitalnego]] (lit. ''Metropolitan Transport Authority'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.infokatowice.pl/2018/12/31/od-1-stycznia-nie-ma-po-co-zagladac-na-strone-kzk-gop-gdzie-szukac-nowego-rozkladu-jazdy/|title=Od 1 stycznia nie ma po co zaglądać na stronę KZK GOP.

Additional services are operated by private companies and [[Public ownership|state-owned]] railways.

===Roads===
*[[File:Katowice - ul. W. Roździeńskiego (Novotel i Gwiazdy).JPG|thumb|260x260px|National road 79 in Katowice]] [[European route E40]] (France–Belgium–Germany–Poland–[[Ukraine]]–Russia–[[Uzbekistan]]–[[Kazakhstan]])

Several important roads in neighbourhoods of Katowice ([[Upper Silesian Metropolitan Union|USMU]]):
*[[A1 autostrada (Poland)|Motorway A1]] ([[Gdańsk]] – [[Toruń]] – [[Łódź]] – [[Gliwice]] – Polish/Czech border)

===Airports===
The city and the area are served by the [[Katowice International Airport]], about {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city center. With 3 terminals and over 4,8&amp;nbsp;million passengers served in 2018, it is by far the biggest airport in Silesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.katowice-airport.com/en/airport/show-news/953698|title=Katowice Airport|website=www.katowice-airport.com|access-date=21 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421101041/https://www.katowice-airport.com/en/airport/show-news/953698|archive-date=21 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the long distance to the airport, there is a proposal to convert the much closer sport aviation [[Katowice-Muchowiec Airport]] into a city airport for smaller, business-oriented traffic.

[[Upper Silesian Railway]] reached the area in 1846. [[Katowice Central Station]] is one of the main railway nodes and exchange points in Poland. It has replaced the old [[Katowice historic train station]]. The city has direct connections among others with [[Warsaw]], [[Cracow]], [[Szczecin]] and [[Gdynia]].

      <text bytes="1847" xml:space="preserve">The '''''Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms''''' is a compendium of terminology used by the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DOD).

It sets forth standard US military and associated [[terminology]] to encompass the joint activity of the [[Armed Forces]] of the [[United States]] in both US joint and allied joint operations, as well as to encompass the Department of Defense (DOD) as a whole. These military and associated terms, together with their definitions, constitute approved DOD terminology for general use by all components of the Department of Defense. The [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], by DOD Directive 5025.12, 23 August 1989, Standardization of Military and Associated Terminology, has directed its use throughout the Department of Defense to ensure standardization of military and associated terminology.

This publication supplements standard English-language dictionaries with standard terminology for military and associated use. However, it is not the intent of this publication to restrict the authority of the joint force commander (JFC) from organizing the force and executing the mission in a manner the JFC deems most appropriate to ensure [[unity of effort]] in the accomplishment of the overall mission.

Vantaa has a rich history that dates back to the [[Stone Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Muinaisuutemme jäljet|last=Georg Haggren, Petri Halinen, Mika Lavento, Sami Raninen ja Anna Wessman|publisher=Gaudeamus|year=2015|isbn=978-952-495-363-4|location=Helsinki|pages=48, 62, 72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area was inhabited by [[Tavastians]] and [[Finns proper]] until the so-called [[Second Swedish Crusade|second crusade to Finland]] and Swedish colonisation of the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ruotsin itämaa|last=Tarkiainen|first=Kari|publisher=Svenska litteratursällskapet i Finland|year=2010|isbn=978-951-583-212-2|location=Helsinki|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the name ''Vantaa'' being taken into use in 1974, the area was known as ''Helsingin pitäjä'' ({{lang-sv|Helsinge}}; &quot;[[Socken]] of Helsinki&quot;). The earliest record of the area is as ''Helsinge'' in 1351 when king [[Magnus II of Sweden]] granted [[salmon]] fishing rights on the [[Vantaa (river)|river Vantaa]] to the [[Estonia]]n [[Padise Abbey]]. The rapids of river Vantaa were known as ''Helsingfors'', from which the current Swedish name of Helsinki derives. Early settlement in Vantaa was centered around the river, in [[Helsingin pitäjän kirkonkylä]], and from it the city's current [[coat of arms]] derived its imagery.

Since the 14th century, the road between [[Turku]] and [[Vyborg]], [[King's Road (Finland)|King's Road]], has run through Vantaa. The road brought significant attention to the city, and its location on the salmon rich river led to a permanent population.

[[Ore]] deposits in ''Helsingin Pitäjä'' had been discovered in the 1700s, but weren't utilized until Finland transferred to [[Russia]]n control in the early 1800s. Ore extraction and processing lead to rapid industrialization in the area, with communities forming around locations like [[Tikkurila]] and [[Kerava]]. The industrial community in Tikkurila included an [[expeller pressing]] plant, which currently operates in the area as the paint manufacturer [[Tikkurila (corporation)|Tikkurila Oyj]].

In 1862, the railway between Helsinki and [[Hämeenlinna]] was constructed, and one of its seven stations was built in Tikkurila, on its intersection with King's Road. The Swedish architect Carl Albert Edelfelt designed a [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival]] styled station building, which is the oldest extant station building in Finland and (as of 1978) has been adapted into the Vantaa City Museum. The railway brought industry and induced population growth.

''Helsingin Pitäjä'' gained municipality rights in 1865, after which it was named ''Helsingin maalaiskunta/Helsinge kommun'' (&quot;Rural Municipality of Helsinki&quot;).

In 1952, the new [[Helsinki Airport|international airport]] of Helsinki opened in Vantaa for the [[1952 Summer Olympics]].

In 1972, the municipality was renamed ''Vantaa'' ({{lang-sv|Vanda}}) and promoted to a [[köping]] ([[market town]]) (i.e. ''Vantaan kauppala/Vanda köping''). In 1974, the town got full city rights as ''Vantaan kaupunki/Vanda stad'' or &quot;City of Vantaa&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vantaa.fi/fi/tietoa_vantaasta/vantaan_historiaa|title=Vantaan kaupunki - Vantaan historiaa|website=Vantaa.fi|accessdate=16 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217013048/http://www.vantaa.fi/fi/tietoa_vantaasta/vantaan_historiaa|archive-date=2015-02-17|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city grew rapidly starting from 1960's and a railway line was built to the western side of the city in 1970's.

In 2015, an extension to the existing railway line, the [[Ring Rail Line]] opened, providing service to the airport and new residential and working districts. Along the ring road, new residential were constructed. The largest of these developments is the Kivistö suburb followed by the residential districts of Leinelä and Aviapolis.

To connect the municipality on the west–east, a new tramway is planned to open in 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vantaa.fi/ratikka|title=Vantaan ratikka}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tramway will run from the Helsinki-Vantaa airport through districts of Pakkala, Aviapolis and Koivuhaka to the administrative centre of Tikkurila and further onward to Hakkila and Länsimäki in the east. The tram will also provide a link to the Helsinki metro at Mellunmäki station. This tramline will be the first tram in Vantaa.

==Geography==
[[File:Vantaa-kartta-2.png|thumb|left|The districts and major regions of Vantaa]]

===Location===
Vantaa is located in southern Finland, in the [[Regions of Finland|region]] of [[Uusimaa]] and the [[Helsinki sub-region]]. It is separated from the [[Gulf of Finland]] by Helsinki. Prior to the abolition of [[Provinces of Finland|Finnish provinces]] in 2009, Vantaa was a part of the [[Southern Finland Province]].

The city borders [[Helsinki]], the Finnish capital, which is to the south and southwest. Other neighbouring municipalities are [[Espoo]] to the west; [[Nurmijärvi]], [[Kerava]], and [[Tuusula]] to the north; and [[Sipoo]] to the east. Vantaa is a part of the Finnish Capital Region, which is the inner core of the [[Greater Helsinki]] metropolitan area.

===Subdivision===
{{Main|Districts of Vantaa}}
Vantaa is divided into seven major regions ({{lang-fi|suuralueet}}, {{lang-sv|storområden}}): [[Tikkurila]] ''(Dickursby)'', [[Hakunila]] ''(Håkansböle)'', [[Koivukylä]] ''(Björkby)'', [[Korso]], [[Aviapolis]], [[Myyrmäki]] ''(Myrbacka)'', and [[Kivistö]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vantaa.fi/en/safety/major_regions|title=City of Vantaa - The Major Regions of Vantaa|website=Vantaa.fi|date=14 April 2011|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These major regions are then divided into a total of 60 city [[districts]], the most populated of which are [[Myyrmäki]], [[Martinlaakso]], [[Hakunila]], and [[Pakkala]].

===Features===
[[File:Vantaankoski2.jpg|thumb|left|Rapids of [[river Vantaa]]]]
Vantaa encompasses {{convert|{{#expr: {{Data Finland municipality/total area|Vantaa}}}}|km2}}, of which {{convert|{{#expr: {{Data Finland municipality/waters area|Vantaa}}}}|km2|abbr=on}} is water.&lt;ref name=&quot;total_area&quot; /&gt; The city is mostly [[suburb]]an and [[urban area]] with some rural landscape, notably in the districts of [[Sotunki]] and [[Seutula]]. Average population density is {{convert|{{#expr: {{Data Finland municipality/population density|Vantaa}} round 2}}|PD/km2|abbr=on}}, which rises above {{convert|5000|PD/km2}} in concentrated urban districts like Myyrmäki and Tikkurila.

The [[river Vantaa]] runs through western Vantaa, and its [[tributary]] [[Keravanjoki]] runs through eastern Vantaa.

For its area, Vantaa has relatively few lakes. The city encompasses two natural lakes: ''Kuusijärvi'' in [[Kuninkaanmäki]] and  ''Lammaslampi'' [[Pähkinärinne]], [[Hämeenkylä]]. In addition to these, there is an [[artificial lake]], ''Silvolan tekojärvi''. Vantaa shares two lakes with [[Espoo]]: ''Odilampi'' and ''Pitkäjärvi''.

Vantaa exhibits frequent exposed [[granite]] [[bedrock]] ground, which is common in Finland. Resulting from erosion in the [[last glacial period]] (about 10,000 years ago), elevated surfaces often lack soil ([[superficial deposits]]), revealing bare stone unsuitable for most plant life. Other geological impacts of the last Ice Age include a series of [[esker]]s running through central Vantaa.

'''Darius III''' (c. 380 – July 330 BC), originally named '''Artashata''' and called '''Codomannus''' by the Greeks,&lt;ref name=Heckel&gt;{{cite book |title=The Wars of Alexander the Great |last=Heckel |first=Waldemar |year=2002 |isbn=978-1841764733 |page=24 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p3D_QHiHdpAC&amp;q=dynastic+name&amp;pg=PA24 |accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the last king of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] of [[Persia]], from 336 BC to 330 BC. Artashata adopted ''Darius'' as a dynastic name.&lt;ref name=Heckel/&gt;

His empire was unstable, with large portions governed by jealous and unreliable [[satrap]]s and inhabited by disaffected and rebellious subjects.

In 334&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Alexander the Great]] began his invasion of the Persian Empire and subsequently defeated the Persians in a number of battles before looting and destroying their capital, [[Persepolis]], by fire in 330&amp;nbsp;BC. With the Persian Empire now effectively under Alexander's control, Alexander then decided to pursue Darius. Before Alexander reached him, however, Darius was killed by his cousin [[Bessus]], who was also the satrap of [[Bactria]].

==Early reign==
{{Hiero/1cartouche|align=left|era=lp|name=Darius&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen von Beckerath]], ''Handbuch der ägyptischen Königsnamen'' (= ''Münchner ägyptologische Studien'', vol 46), Mainz am Rhein: Verlag Philipp von Zabern, 1999. {{ISBN|3-8053-2310-7}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;230–31.&lt;/ref&gt;|nomen=&lt;hiero&gt;ini:V13-r-w-M8&lt;/hiero&gt;}}

Artashata was the son of Arsames, son of [[Ostanes (son of Darius II)|Ostanes]]; and [[Sisygambis]], daughter of [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes&amp;nbsp;II Mnemon]]. Prior to being appointed as a royal courier, he had served as a [[Satrapy of Armenia|satrap of Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kia|first1=Mehrdad|title=The Persian Empire: A Historical Encyclopedia|date=2016|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1610693912|page=160|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B5BHDAAAQBAJ&amp;q=darius+III+satrap+armenia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;iranicaonline.org&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | article = Darius v.

Diod. 17.6.1–2&lt;/ref&gt; and was serving at the time as a royal courier.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Alexander'' 18.7–8, First Oration on the Fortune or the Virtue of Alexander, 326.D.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he may have been promoted from his satrapy to the postal service after the ascension of [[Arses of Persia|Arses]], for he is referred to as one of the king's &quot;friends&quot; at court after that occasion.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranicaonline.org&quot;/&gt;

In 336&amp;nbsp;BC, he took the throne at the age of&amp;nbsp;43 after the death of [[Artaxerxes III]]  and Arses. According to Greek historian [[Diodorus of Sicily]], Artashata was installed by the [[vizier]] [[Bagoas]], after the latter had poisoned the king [[Artaxerxes III]] and subsequently his sons, including Arses, who had succeeded him on the throne. Artashata took the regnal name Darius&amp;nbsp;III,&lt;ref name=Heckel/&gt; and quickly demonstrated his independence from his possible assassin benefactor. Bagoas then tried to poison Darius as well, when he learned that even Darius couldn't be controlled, but Darius was warned and forced Bagoas to drink the poison himself.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus 17.5.6.&lt;/ref&gt; The new king found himself in control of an unstable empire, large portions of which were governed by jealous and unreliable [[satrap]]s and inhabited by disaffected and rebellious subjects, such as [[Khabash]] in Egypt and possibly [[Nidin-Bel]] in Babylon. Compared to his ancestors and his fellow heirs who had since perished, Darius had a distinct lack of experience ruling an empire, and a lack of any previous ambition to do so. Darius was a ruler of entirely average stamp, without the striking talents and qualities which the administration of a vast empire required during that period of crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Bengtson, ''History of Greece from the Beginnings to the Byzantine Era'', p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict with the Greeks==

=== Philip's campaign ===
In 336 BC [[Philip II of Macedon]] was authorized by the [[League of Corinth]] as its [[Hegemony|Hegemon]] to initiate a sacred war of vengeance against the Persians for desecrating and burning the [[Athens|Athenian]] temples during the [[Greco-Persian Wars#Later Conflicts|Second Persian War]], over a century before. He sent an advance force into [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] under the command of his generals [[Parmenion]] and [[Attalus (general)|Attalus]] to liberate the Greeks living under Persian control. After they took the Greek cities of Asia from [[Troy]] to the [[Büyük Menderes River|Maiandros river]], Philip was assassinated and his campaign was suspended while his heir consolidated his control of Macedonia and the rest of Greece.

=== Alexander's campaign ===
[[File:Battle of Issus mosaic - Museo Archeologico Nazionale - Naples.jpg|right|thumb|230px|Darius III portrayed (in the middle) in battle against Alexander in a Greek depiction; Possible illustration of either Battle of Issus or Battle of Gaugamela]]
[[File:Batalla de Gaugamela (M.A.N. Inv.1980-60-1) 02.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Darius's flight at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]] (18th-century ivory relief)]]

In the spring of 334 BC, Philip's heir, Alexander, who had himself been confirmed as [[Hegemon]] by the [[League of Corinth]], invaded Asia Minor at the head of an army of Macedonian and other Greek soldiers. This invasion, which marked the beginning of the [[Wars of Alexander the Great]], was followed almost immediately by the victory of Alexander over the Persians at [[Battle of the Granicus]]. Darius never showed up for the battle, because there was no reason for him to suppose that Alexander intended to conquer the whole of Asia, and Darius may well have supposed that the satraps of the ‘lower’ satrapies could deal with the crisis,&lt;ref&gt;[[George Cawkwell]], ''The Greek Wars: The Failure of Persia'', p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; so he instead decided to remain at home in Persepolis and let his satraps handle it. In the previous invasion of Asia Minor by the Spartan king [[Agesilaus II]], the Persians had pinned him in Asia Minor while fomenting [[Corinthian War|rebellion]] in Greece. Darius attempted to employ the same strategy, with the Spartans rebelling against the Macedonians, but the Spartans were defeated at [[Battle of Megalopolis|Megalopolis]].

Darius did not actually take the field against Alexander's army until a year and a half after Granicus, at the [[Battle of Issus]] in 333&amp;nbsp;BC. His forces outnumbered Alexander's soldiers by at least a 2 to&amp;nbsp;1 ratio, but Darius was still outflanked, defeated, and forced to flee. It is told by [[Arrian]] that at the Battle of Issus the moment the Persian left went to pieces under Alexander's attack and Darius, in his war-chariot, saw that it was cut off, he incontinently fled – indeed, he led the race for safety.&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''The Campaigns of Alexander''.&lt;/ref&gt; On the way, he left behind his chariot, his bow, and his royal mantle, all of which were later picked up by Alexander. Greek sources such as Diodorus Siculus' ''Library of History'' and Justin's ''Epitoma Historiarum Philippicarum'' recount that Darius fled out of fear at the Battle of Issus and again two years later at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]] despite commanding a larger force in a defensive position each time.&lt;ref&gt;John Prevas, ''Envy of the Gods: Alexander's Ill-fated Journey across Asia'' (Da Capo Press, 2004), 47.&lt;/ref&gt; At the Battle of Issus, Darius III even caught Alexander by surprise and failed to defeat Alexander's forces.&lt;ref&gt;Prevas 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Darius fled so far so fast that Alexander was able to capture Darius’ headquarters and take Darius’ family as prisoners in the process. Darius petitioned to Alexander through letters several times to get his family back, but Alexander refused to do so unless Darius would acknowledge him as the new emperor of Persia.

Circumstances were more in Darius’ favor at the Battle of Gaugamela in 331&amp;nbsp;BC. He had a good number of troops who had been organized on the battlefield properly, he had the support of the armies of several of his satraps, and the ground on the battlefield was almost perfectly even, so as not to impede movement of his scythed chariots. Despite all these beneficial factors, he still fled the battle before any victor had been decided and deserted his experienced commanders as well as one of the largest armies ever assembled.&lt;ref&gt;Prevas 48&lt;/ref&gt; Another source accounts that when Darius perceived the fierce attack of Alexander, as at Issus he turned his chariot around, and was the first to flee,&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Wilcken, ''Alexander the Great''.&lt;/ref&gt; once again abandoning all of his soldiers and his property to be taken by Alexander. Many Persian soldiers lost their lives that day, so many in fact that after the battle the casualties of the enemy ensured that Darius would never again raise an imperial army.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;N.G.L. Hammond, ''The Genius of Alexander the Great''.&lt;/ref&gt; Darius then fled to [[Ecbatana]] and attempted to raise a third army, while Alexander took possession of [[Babylon]], [[Susa]], and the Persian capital at [[Persepolis]]. Darius reportedly offered all of his empire west of the Euphrates River to Alexander in exchange for peace several times, each time denied by Alexander against the advice of his senior commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Prevas 52&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander could have declared victory after the capture of Persepolis, but he instead decided to pursue Darius.

The [[Battle of Gaugamela]], in which [[Alexander the Great]] defeated Darius III of Persia in 331 BC, took place approximately 100 kilometres (62&amp;nbsp;mi) west of [[Erbil]], [[Iraq]]. After the battle, Darius managed to flee to the city.  However, somewhat inaccurately, the confrontation is sometimes known as the &quot;Battle of Arbela.&quot;

==Flight, imprisonment, and death==
[[File:Murder of Darius and Alexander at the side of the dying king.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Murder of Darius and Alexander at the side of the dying king depicted in a 15th-century manuscript]]
Darius did attempt to restore his once great army after his defeat at the hands of Alexander, but he failed to raise a force comparable to that which had fought at Gaugamela, partly because the defeat had undermined his authority, and also because Alexander's liberal policy, for instance in Babylonia and in Persis, offered an acceptable alternative to Persian policies.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;

When at Ecbatana, Darius learned of Alexander's approaching army, he decided to retreat to [[Bactria]] where he could better use his cavalry and mercenary forces on the more even ground of the plains of Asia. He led his army through the Caspian Gates, the main road through the mountains that would work to slow a following army.&lt;ref&gt;Prevas 55&lt;/ref&gt; Persian forces became increasingly demoralized with the constant threat of a surprise attack from Alexander, leading to many desertions and eventually a coup led by [[Bessus]], a satrap, and Nabarzanes, who managed all audiences with the King and was in charge of the palace guard.&lt;ref&gt;Prevas 60&lt;/ref&gt; The two men suggested to Darius that the army regroup under Bessus and that power would be transferred back to the King once Alexander was defeated. Darius obviously did not accept this plan and his conspirators became more anxious to remove him for his successive failures against Alexander and his forces. Patron, a Greek mercenary, encouraged Darius to accept a bodyguard of Greek mercenaries rather than his usual Persian guard to protect him from Bessus and Nabarzanes, but the King could not accept for political reasons and grew accustomed to his fate.&lt;ref&gt;Prevas 64–65&lt;/ref&gt; Bessus and Nabarzanes eventually bound Darius and threw him in an ox-cart while they ordered the Persian forces to continue on. According to [[Quintus Curtius Rufus|Curtius']] ''History of Alexander'', at this point Alexander and a small, mobile force arrived and threw the Persians into a panic, leading Bessus and two other conspirators, [[Satibarzanes]] and Barsaentes, to wound the king with their javelins and leave him to die.&lt;ref&gt;Prevas 69&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Family of Darius before Alexander by Paolo Veronese 1570.jpg|thumb|''The Family of Darius before Alexander'', by [[Paolo Veronese]], 1570.]]
A Macedonian soldier found Darius either dead or dying in the wagon shortly thereafter—a disappointment to Alexander, who wanted to capture Darius alive. Alexander saw Darius’ dead body in the wagon, and took the signet ring off the dead king's finger. Afterwards he sent Darius's body back to Persepolis, gave him a magnificent funeral and ordered that he be buried, like all his royal predecessors, in the royal tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Prevas 71&lt;/ref&gt; Darius's tomb has not yet been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Siegfried Lauffer, ''Alexander der Große''. third edition, Dtv, Munich 1993, {{ISBN|3-423-04298-2}}, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander eventually married Darius' daughter [[Stateira II|Stateira]] at Susa in 324&amp;nbsp;BC.

With the old king defeated and given a proper burial, Alexander's rulership of Persia became official. This led to Darius being regarded by some historians as cowardly and inefficient,&lt;ref&gt;W.W. Tarn, ''Alexander the Great''.&lt;/ref&gt; as under his rulership, the entirety of the Persian Empire fell to a foreign invader. After killing Darius, [[Bessus]] took the regal name Artaxerxes V and began calling himself the King of Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; He was subsequently captured by Alexander, tortured, and executed.  Another of Darius' generals ingratiated himself to Alexander by giving the conqueror Darius' favored [[Catamite|companion]], [[Bagoas (courtier)|Bagoas]].&lt;ref&gt;This was a different Bagoas than the [[Bagoas|unfaithful minister]] mentioned above. Crompton, Louis.  ''Homosexuality &amp; Civilization'' (Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2003), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof '''Henry John Stephen Smith''' [[Royal Society of London|FRS]] [[FRSE]] [[Royal Astronomical Society|FRAS]] LLD (2 November 1826 – 9 February 1883) was a British [[mathematician]] and amateur astronomer remembered for his work in [[elementary divisors]], [[quadratic form]]s, and [[Smith–Minkowski–Siegel mass formula]] in [[number theory]]. In [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix theory]] he is visible today in having his name on the [[Smith normal form]] of a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].  Smith was also first to discover the [[Cantor set]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Henry J.S. | last=Smith | date=1874 | title=On the integration of discontinuous functions | journal=Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society | series=First series | volume=6 | pages=140–153| url=https://zenodo.org/record/1932560 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; https://andrescaicedo.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/julian-f-fleron-a-note-on-the-history-of-the-cantor-set-and-cantor-function.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/the-cantor-set-before-cantor-a-mini-primary-source-project-for-analysis-and-topology-students The Cantor Set Before Cantor] Mathematical Association of America&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Smith was born in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], the fourth child of John Smith (1792–1828), a [[barrister]], who died when Henry was two. His mother, Mary Murphy (d.1857) from [[Bantry Bay]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Smith.html |title = Henry Smith (1826-1883)}}&lt;/ref&gt; very soon afterwards moved the family to England. He had thirteen siblings, including [[Eleanor Smith (activist)|Eleanor Smith]], who became a prominent educational activist.  He lived in several places in England as a boy. His mother did not send him to school but educated him herself until age 11, at which point she hired private tutors. At age 15 Smith was admitted in 1841 to [[Rugby School]] in [[Warwickshire]], where [[Thomas Arnold]] was the school's [[headmaster]]. This came about because his tutor [[Henry Highton]] took up a [[housemaster]] position there.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=13250|title=Highton, Henry|first=Peter|last=Osborne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://archive.org/stream/collectedmathema01smituoft#page/n21/mode/2up | title=Biographical sketch | work=The Collected Mathematical Works of Henry John Stephen Smith | editor-first=J. W. L. | editor-last=Glaisher | year=1894 | accessdate=27 November 2012 | publisher=Oxford Clarendon Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 19 he won an entrance scholarship to [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. He graduated in 1849 with high honours in both mathematics and classics. Smith was fluent in French having spent holidays in [[France]], and he took classes in mathematics at the [[Collège de Sorbonne|Sorbonne]] in Paris during the 1846–7 academic year. He was unmarried and lived with his mother until her death in 1857. He then brought his sister, Eleanor Smith, to live with him as housekeeper at St Giles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Smith.html |title = Henry Smith (1826-1883)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henry John Stephen Smith.jpg|thumb|265px|Bust on display in the [[Oxford University Museum]].]]
Smith remained at Balliol College as a mathematics tutor following his graduation in 1849 and was soon promoted to [[Fellow (college)|Fellow]] status. 

In 1861, he was promoted to the [[Savilian Chair of Geometry]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. In 1873, he was made the beneficiary of a fellowship at [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]], and gave up teaching at Balliol.

In 1874 he became Keeper of the University Museum and moved (with his sister) to the Keeper's House on South Parks Road in Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Smith.html |title = Henry Smith (1826-1883)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On account of his ability as a man of affairs, Smith was in demand for academic administrative and committee work: he was [[Keeper (museum)|Keeper]] of the [[Oxford University Museum]]; a Mathematical Examiner for the [[University of London]]; a member of a Royal Commission to review scientific education practice; a member of the commission to reform [[University of Oxford]] governance; chairman of the committee of scientists overseeing the [[Meteorological Office]]; twice president of the [[London Mathematical Society]]; etc.

He died in Oxford on 9 February 1883. He is buried in [[St Sepulchre's Cemetery]] in Oxford.

==Work==

===Researches in number theory===

Smith's two earliest mathematical papers were on geometrical subjects, but the third concerned the theory of numbers. Following the example of Gauss, he wrote his first paper on the theory of numbers in Latin: &quot;De compositione numerorum primorum formæ &lt;math&gt;4n+1&lt;/math&gt; ex duobus quadratis.&quot; In it he proves in an original manner the theorem of Fermat---&quot;That every prime number of the form &lt;math&gt;4n+1&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; being an integer) is the sum of two square numbers.&quot; In his second paper he gives an introduction to the theory of numbers.

In 1858, Smith was selected by the [[British Association]] to prepare a report upon the Theory of Numbers. It was prepared in five parts, extending over the years 1859–1865. It is neither a history nor a treatise, but something intermediate. The author analyzes with remarkable clearness and order the works of mathematicians for the preceding century upon the theory of congruences, and upon that of binary quadratic forms. He returns to the original sources, indicates the principle and sketches the course of the demonstrations, and states the result, often adding something of his own.

During the preparation of the Report, and as a logical consequence of the researches connected therewith, Smith published several original contributions to the higher arithmetic. Some were in complete form and appeared in the ''Philosophical Transactions'' of the Royal Society of London; others were incomplete, giving only the results without the extended demonstrations, and appeared in the Proceedings of that Society. One of the latter, entitled &quot;On the orders and genera of quadratic forms containing more than three indeterminates,&quot; enunciates certain general principles by means of which he solves a problem proposed by [[Gotthold Eisenstein|Eisenstein]], namely, the decomposition of integer numbers into the sum of five squares; and further, the analogous problem for seven squares. It was also indicated that the four, six, and eight-square theorems of Jacobi, Eisenstein and Liouville were deducible from the principles set forth.

In 1868, Smith returned to the geometrical researches which had first occupied his attention. For a memoir on &quot;Certain cubic and biquadratic problems&quot; the Royal Academy of Sciences of Berlin awarded him the Steiner prize.

In February, 1882, Smith was surprised to see in the ''Comptes rendus'' that the subject proposed by the Paris Academy of Science
for the ''Grand prix des sciences mathématiques'' was the theory of the decomposition of integer numbers into a sum of five squares; and that the attention of competitors was directed to the results announced without demonstration by Eisenstein, whereas nothing was said about his papers dealing with the same subject in the Proceedings of the Royal Society. He wrote to M. Hermite calling his attention to what he had published; in reply he was assured that the members of the commission did not know of the existence of his papers, and he was advised to complete his demonstrations and submit the memoir according to the rules of the competition. According to the rules each manuscript bears a motto, and the corresponding envelope containing the name of the successful author is opened. There were still three months before the closing of the ''concours'' (1 June 1882) and Smith set to work, prepared the memoir and despatched it in time.

Two months after Smith's death, the [[Paris Academy]] made their award. Two of the three memoirs sent in were judged worthy of the prize. When
the envelopes were opened, the authors were found to be Smith and [[Hermann Minkowski|Minkowski]], a young mathematician of [[Königsberg]], [[Prussia]]. No notice was taken of Smith's previous publication on the subject, and M. Hermite on being written to, said that he forgot to bring the matter to the notice of the commission.

===Work on the Riemann integral===
In 1875 Smith published the important paper {{harv|Smith|1875}} on the integrability of [[discontinuous function]]s in [[Riemann integral|Riemann's sense]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|Letta|1994|p=154}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, while giving a rigorous definition of the Riemann integral as well as explicit rigorous proofs of many of the results published by Riemann,&lt;ref&gt;The Riemann integral was introduced in Bernhard Riemann's paper &quot;Über die Darstellbarkeit einer Function durch eine trigonometrische Reihe&quot; (On the representability of a function by a trigonometric series), submitted to the University of Göttingen in 1854 as Riemann's ''Habilitationsschrift'' (qualification to become an instructor). It was published in 1868 in ''Abhandlungen der Königlichen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen'' (Proceedings of the Royal Philosophical Society at Göttingen), vol. 13, pages 87–132 (freely available on-line from [[Google Books]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=PDVFAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA87  here]): Riemann's definition of the integral is given in section 4, &quot;Über der Begriff eines bestimmten Integrals und den Umfang seiner Gültigkeit&quot; (On the concept of a definite integral and the extent of its validity), pp. 101–103, and {{harvtxt|Smith|1875|p=140}} analyzes this paper.&lt;/ref&gt; he also gave an example of a [[meagre set]] which is not [[negligible set|negligible]] in the sense of [[measure theory]], since its measure is not zero:&lt;ref name=&quot;Letta156&quot;&gt;See {{harv|Letta|1994|p=156}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a function which is everywhere continuous except on this set is not Riemann integrable. Smith's example shows that the proof of sufficient condition for the Riemann integrability of a discontinuous function given earlier by [[Hermann Hankel]] was incorrect and the result does not hold:&lt;ref name=&quot;Letta156&quot; /&gt; however, his result remained unnoticed until much later, having no influence on successive developments.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|Letta|1994|p=157}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In an 1875 paper, he discussed a nowhere-dense set of positive measure on the real line, an early version of the Cantor set, now known as the [[Smith–Volterra–Cantor set]].

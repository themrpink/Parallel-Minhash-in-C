[[File:Disa cornuta00.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Disa cornuta]] (L.) Sw.'' by Margaret &amp; John Herschel]]

Declining an offer from the [[Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex|Duke of Sussex]] that they travel to South Africa on a Navy ship, Herschel and his wife paid £500 for passage on the S.S. ''Mountstuart Elphinstone'', which departed from Portsmouth on 13 November 1833.

The voyage to South Africa was made to catalogue the stars, nebulae, and other objects of the southern skies.&lt;ref name=HersNAH/&gt; This was to be a completion as well as extension of the survey of the northern heavens undertaken initially by his father [[William Herschel]]. He arrived in [[Cape Town]] on 15 January 1834 and set up a private {{convert|21|ft|m|abbr=on}} telescope at Feldhausen at [[Claremont, Cape Town|Claremont]], a suburb of Cape Town. Amongst his other observations during this time was that of the return of [[Comet Halley]]. Herschel collaborated with [[Thomas Maclear]], the Astronomer Royal at the Cape of Good Hope and the members of the two families became close friends. During this time, he also witnessed the Great Eruption of [[Eta Carinae]] (December 1837).

In addition to his astronomical work, however, this voyage to a far corner of the British empire also gave Herschel an escape from the pressures under which he found himself in London, where he was one of the most sought-after of all British men of science. While in southern Africa, he engaged in a broad variety of scientific pursuits free from a sense of strong obligations to a larger scientific community. It was, he later recalled, probably the happiest time in his life.

In an extraordinary departure from astronomy, Herschel combined his talents with those of his wife, Margaret, and between 1834 and 1838 they produced 131 botanical illustrations of fine quality, showing the Cape flora. Herschel used a [[camera lucida]] to obtain accurate outlines of the specimens and left the details to his wife. Even though their portfolio had been intended as a personal record, and despite the lack of floral dissections in the paintings, their accurate rendition makes them more valuable than many contemporary collections. Some 112 of the 132 known flower studies were collected and published as ''Flora Herscheliana'' in 1996.

As their home during their stay in the Cape, the Herschels had selected 'Feldhausen' (&quot;Field Houses&quot;), an old estate on the south-eastern side of [[Table Mountain]]. Here John set up his reflector to begin his survey of the southern skies.

Herschel, at the same time, read widely. Intrigued by the ideas of gradual formation of landscapes set out in [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''Principles of Geology'', he wrote to Lyell on 20 February 1836 praising the book as a work that would bring &quot;a complete revolution in [its] subject, by altering entirely the point of view in which it must thenceforward be contemplated&quot; and opening a way for bold speculation on &quot;that mystery of mysteries, the replacement of extinct species by others.&quot; Herschel himself thought [[catastrophism|catastrophic extinction and renewal]] &quot;an inadequate conception of the Creator&quot; and by analogy with other [[Physical law|intermediate causes]], &quot;the origination of fresh species, could it ever come under our cognizance, would be found to be a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process&quot;.{{sfn|van Wyhe|2007|p=197}}{{sfn|Babbage|1838|pp=225–227}} He prefaced his words with the couplet:

{{poemquote|He that on such quest would go must know not fear or failing
To coward soul or faithless heart the search were unavailing.}}

Taking a gradualist view of development and referring to evolutionary descent from a [[proto-language]], Herschel commented:

{{quote|Words are to the Anthropologist what rolled pebbles are to the Geologist – battered relics of past ages often containing within them indelible records capable of intelligent interpretation – and when we see what amount of change 2000 years has been able to produce in the languages of Greece &amp; Italy or 1000 in those of Germany France &amp; Spain we naturally begin to ask how long a period must have lapsed since the Chinese, the Hebrew, the Delaware &amp; the Malesass [Malagasy] had a point in common with the German &amp; Italian &amp; each other – Time! Time! Time! – we must not impugn the Scripture Chronology, but we ''must'' interpret it in accordance with ''whatever'' shall appear on fair enquiry to be the ''truth'' for there cannot be two truths. And really there is scope enough: for the lives of the Patriarchs may as reasonably be extended to 5000 or 50000 years apiece as the days of Creation to as many thousand millions of years.{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=214–215}}{{sfn|Darwin|1985b|loc=[http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/DCP-LETT-346.xml#mark-346.f5 Letter No. 346]}} }}

The document was circulated, and [[Charles Babbage]] incorporated extracts in his ninth and unofficial ''[[Bridgewater Treatise]]'', which postulated laws set up by a divine programmer.{{sfn|van Wyhe|2007|p=197}} When [[The Voyage of the Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']] called at [[Cape Town]], Captain [[Robert FitzRoy]] and the young naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] visited Herschel on 3 June 1836. Later on, Darwin would be influenced by Herschel's writings in developing his theory advanced in ''[[The Origin of Species]]''. In the opening lines of that work, Darwin writes that his intent is &quot;to throw some light on the origin of species – that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers,&quot; referring to Herschel.  However, Herschel ultimately rejected the theory of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;John Herschel, ''Physical Geography'' (1861), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herschel returned to England in 1838, was created a [[Herschel baronets|baronet]], of Slough in the County of Buckingham,&lt;ref name=HersNAH/&gt; and published ''Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope'' in 1847. In this publication he proposed the names still used today for the seven then-known satellites of [[Saturn]]: [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]], [[Enceladus]], [[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]], [[Dione (moon)|Dione]], [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], and [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]].{{sfn|Lassell|1848|p=}} In the same year, Herschel received his second Copley Medal from the Royal Society for this work.  A few years later, in 1852, he proposed the names still used today for the four then-known satellites of [[Uranus]]: [[Ariel (moon)|Ariel]], [[Umbriel (moon)|Umbriel]], [[Titania (moon)|Titania]], and [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]]. A stone obelisk, erected in 1842 and now in the grounds of [[Grove_Primary_School_(South_Africa)|The Grove Primary School]], marks the site where his 20-ft reflector once stood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ridpath |first1=Ian |title=The Herschel Monument in Cape Town |journal=Bulletin of the Society for the History of Astronomy |year=2017 |issue=27 |pages=34–37 |url=https://societyforthehistoryofastronomy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/reducedfinal27f.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Photography ==
[[File:Herschel first picture on glass 1839 3.jpg|thumb|Herschel's first glass-plate photograph, dated 9 September 1839, showing the [[40-foot telescope]]{{sfn|Evans|1970|p=84}}]]
Herschel made numerous important contributions to photography.  He made improvements in [[photographic processes]], particularly in inventing the [[cyanotype]]&lt;ref name=&quot;WDL1&quot; /&gt; process, which became known as [[blueprint]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;EncycBrit&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;columbia&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vernacu&quot;/&gt; and variations, such as the [[chrysotype]]. In 1839, he made a photograph on glass, which still exists, and experimented with some color reproduction, noting that rays of different parts of the spectrum tended to impart their own color to a photographic paper. Herschel made experiments using photosensitive emulsions of vegetable juices, called [[phytotype]]s, also known as [[anthotype]]s, and published his discoveries in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London in 1842.{{sfn|Herschel|1842|pp=182–214}}  He collaborated in the early 1840s with [[Henry Collen]], portrait painter to Queen Victoria.  Herschel originally discovered the platinum process on the basis of the light sensitivity of platinum salts, later developed by [[William Willis (inventor)|William Willis]].&lt;ref name= &quot;KNAW&quot; /&gt;

Herschel coined the term ''photography'' in 1839.{{sfn|Schaaf|1979|pp=47–60}}{{sfn|Peres|2008|p=}} Herschel was also the first to apply the terms ''negative'' and ''positive'' to photography.&lt;ref name=HersNAH/&gt;

Herschel discovered [[sodium thiosulfate]] to be a solvent of silver [[halide]]s in 1819,{{sfn|Herschel|1819|p=}} and informed [[Henry Fox Talbot|Talbot]] and [[Louis Daguerre|Daguerre]] of his discovery that this &quot;hyposulphite of soda&quot; (&quot;hypo&quot;) could be used as a [[photographic fixer]], to &quot;fix&quot; pictures and make them permanent, after experimentally applying it thus in early 1839.

Herschel's ground-breaking research on the subject was read at the Royal Society in London in March 1839 and January 1840.

Herschel wrote many papers and articles, including entries on meteorology, physical geography and the telescope for the eighth edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.&lt;ref name=HersNAH/&gt; He also translated the ''[[Iliad]]'' of Homer.
{{further|English translations of Homer#Herschel}}

In 1823, Herschel published his findings on the optical spectra of metal salts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herschel |first1=J.F.W. |title=On the absorption of light by coloured media, and on the colours of the prismatic spectrum exhibited by certain flames; with an account of a ready mode of determining the absolute dispersive power of any medium, by direct experiment |journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh |year=1823 |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=445–460 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hwhq76;view=1up;seq=529|doi=10.1017/S008045680003101X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herschel invented the [[actinometer]] in 1825 to measure the direct heating power of the sun's rays,{{sfn|Anon|1884|p=527}} and his work with the instrument is of great importance in the early history of [[photochemistry]].

Herschel proposed a correction to the Gregorian calendar, making years that are multiples of 4000 not leap years, thus reducing the average length of the [[calendar year]] from 365.2425 days to 365.24225.{{sfn|Herschel | 1876|p=712}} Although this is closer to the [[mean tropical year]] of 365.24219 days, his proposal has never been adopted because the Gregorian calendar is based on the mean time between vernal [[equinox]]es (currently {{gaps|365.242|374}} days).{{sfn|Steel|2000|p=185}}

Herschel was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1832,&lt;ref name=&quot;AAAS&quot; /&gt; and in 1836, a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

In 1835, the ''[[New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]'' newspaper wrote a series of satiric articles that came to be known as the [[Great Moon Hoax]], with statements falsely attributed to Herschel about his supposed discoveries of animals living on the Moon, including batlike winged humanoids.

The village of [[Herschel, Saskatchewan|Herschel in western Saskatchewan Canada]] (site of the discovery of  ''[[Dolichorhynchops herschelensis]], a type of [[Plesiosauria|short-necked plesiosaur]]'',) [[Mount Herschel]] Antarctica, the crater [[J. Herschel (crater)|J. Herschel]] on the Moon, and the [[Herschel Girls' School]] in [[Cape Town]] South Africa, are all named after him.

While it is commonly accepted that Herschel Island, in the Arctic Ocean, part of the [[Yukon Territory]], was named after him, the entries in the expedition journal of Sir [[John Franklin]] state that the latter wished to honour the Herschel family, of which John Herschel's father, Sir [[William Herschel]], and his aunt, [[Caroline Herschel]], are as notable as John.{{sfn|Burn|2009|pp=317–323}}

In [[law]] and [[government]], '''''de facto''''' ({{IPAc-en|d|eɪ|_|ˈ|f|æ|k|t|oʊ|,_|d|i|_|-}} {{respell|day|_|FAK|toh|,_|dee|_-}};&lt;ref&gt;''Random House Kernerman Webster's College Dictionary''. S.v. &quot;de facto.&quot; Retrieved January 12, 2018 from https://www.thefreedictionary.com/de+facto&lt;/ref&gt; {{Lang-la|de facto}} {{IPA-la|deː ˈfaktoː|}}, &quot;in fact&quot;) describes practices that exist in reality, even though they are not officially recognized by laws.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dictionary.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.Dictionary.com/browse/de-facto|title=de facto|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See I. 3. {{cite OED2|de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|de facto}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly used to refer to what happens in practice, in contrast with ''[[de jure]]'' (&quot;by law&quot;), which refers to things that happen according to law.

==Examples==
===Standards===
{{Main|De facto standard}}
&lt;!--::&lt;small&gt;''Summarized from [[De facto standard]]''.&lt;/small&gt;--&gt;

A [[de facto standard|{{dfn|de facto standard}}]] is a standard (formal or informal) that has achieved a dominant position by tradition, enforcement, or market dominance. It has not necessarily received formal approval by way of a standardisation process, and may not have an official standards document.

[[Technical standard|{{dfn|Technical standard}}]]s are usually voluntary, such as [[ISO 9000]] requirements, but may be obligatory, enforced by government norms, such as [[Water quality|drinking water quality]] requirements. The term &quot;de facto standard&quot; is used for both: to contrast obligatory standards (also known as &quot;de jure standards&quot;); or to express a dominant standard, when there is more than one proposed standard.

In [[social sciences]], a voluntary standard that is also a de facto standard, is a typical solution to a [[coordination problem]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ulmann&quot;&gt;Edna Ullmann-Margalit: ''The Emergence of Norms'', Oxford Un. Press, 1977. (or Clarendon Press 1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

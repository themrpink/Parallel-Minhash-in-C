Gravers come in a variety of shapes and sizes that yield different line types. The burin produces a unique and recognizable quality of line that is characterized by its steady, deliberate appearance and clean edges. Other tools such as mezzotint rockers, roulettes (a tool with a fine-toothed wheel) and burnishers (a tool used for making an object smooth or shiny by rubbing) are used for texturing effects.

To make a print, the engraved plate is inked all over, then the ink is wiped off the surface, leaving only ink in the engraved lines. The plate is then put through a high-pressure printing press together with a sheet of paper (often moistened to soften it). The paper picks up the ink from the engraved lines, making a print. The process can be repeated many times; typically several hundred impressions (copies) could be printed before the printing plate shows much sign of wear, except when [[drypoint]], which gives much shallower lines, is used.

In the 20th century, true engraving was revived as a serious art form by artists including [[Stanley William Hayter]] whose [[Atelier 17]] in Paris and New York City became the magnet for such artists as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[Mauricio Lasansky]] and [[Joan Miró]].

{{main|Etching}}
'''Etching''' is part of the [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] family. In pure etching, a metal plate (usually copper, zinc, or steel) is covered with a waxy or acrylic [[ground (etching)|ground]]. The artist then draws through the ground with a pointed etching needle, exposing the metal. The plate is then etched by dipping it in a bath of etchant (e.g. [[nitric acid]] or [[ferric chloride]]). The etchant &quot;bites&quot; into the exposed metal, leaving behind lines in the plate. The remaining ground is then cleaned off the plate, and the printing process is then just the same as for engraving. 

Although the first dated etching is by [[Albrecht Dürer]] in 1515, the process is believed to have been invented by [[Daniel Hopfer]] (c.1470&amp;ndash;1536) of Augsburg, Germany, who decorated armor in this way, and applied the method to printmaking.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Brian D. [http://artinprint.org/article/freedom-and-resistance-in-the-act-of-engraving-or-why-durer-gave-up-on-etching/ &quot;Freedom and Resistance in the Act of Engraving (or, Why Dürer Gave up on Etching),&quot;] ''Art in Print'' Vol. 7 No. 3 (September–October 2017), 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Etching soon came to challenge engraving as the most popular printmaking medium. Its great advantage was that, unlike engraving which requires special skill in metalworking, etching is relatively easy to learn for an artist trained in drawing.

Etching prints are generally linear and often contain fine detail and contours. [[Line art|Lines]] can vary from smooth to sketchy. An etching is opposite of a woodcut in that the raised portions of an etching remain blank while the crevices hold ink.

=== Mezzotint ===

&lt;/div&gt;
{{main|Mezzotint}}
An [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] variant of engraving in which the image is formed from subtle gradations of light and shade. Mezzotint—from the Italian mezzo (&quot;half&quot;) and tinta (&quot;tone&quot;)—is a &quot;dark manner&quot; form of printmaking, which requires artists to work from dark to light. To create a mezzotint, the surface of a copper printing plate is roughened evenly all over with the aid of a tool known as a rocker; the image is then formed by smoothing the surface with a tool known as a burnisher. When inked, the roughened areas of the plate will hold more ink and print more darkly, while smoother areas of the plate hold less or no ink, and will print more lightly or not at all. It is, however, possible to create the image by only roughening the plate selectively, so working from light to dark.

Mezzotint is known for the luxurious quality of its tones: first, because an evenly, finely roughened surface holds a lot of ink, allowing deep solid colors to be printed; secondly because the process of smoothing the texture with burin, burnisher and scraper allows fine gradations in tone to be developed.

The mezzotint printmaking method was invented by [[Ludwig von Siegen]] (1609–1680). The process was used widely in England from the mid-eighteenth century, to reproduce oil paintings and in particular portraits.

=== Aquatint ===

&lt;/div&gt;
[[File:Goya-Capricho-43.jpg|thumb|upright|&quot;The sleep of Reason creates monsters&quot;, etching and aquatint by [[Francisco Goya]]]]
{{main|Aquatint}}
A technique used in [[Intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio]] etchings. Like etching, aquatint technique involves the application of acid to make marks in a metal plate. Where the etching technique uses a needle to make lines that retain ink, aquatint relies on powdered [[rosin]] which is acid resistant in the ground to create a tonal effect. The rosin is applied in a light dusting by a fan booth, the rosin is then cooked until set on the plate. At this time the rosin can be burnished or scratched out to affect its tonal qualities. The tonal variation is controlled by the level of acid exposure over large areas, and thus the image is shaped by large sections at a time.

Goya used aquatint for most of his prints.

=== Drypoint===

&lt;/div&gt;
{{main|Drypoint}}
[[File:Rembrandt The Three Crosses 1653.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Three Crosses]]'', [[drypoint]] by [[Rembrandt]]]]
A variant of engraving, done with a sharp point, rather than a v-shaped [[Burin (engraving)|burin]]. While engraved lines are very smooth and hard-edged, drypoint scratching leaves a rough burr at the edges of each line. This burr gives drypoint prints a characteristically soft, and sometimes blurry, line quality. Because the pressure of printing quickly destroys the burr, drypoint is useful only for very small editions; as few as ten or twenty impressions. To counter this, and allow for longer print runs, electro-plating (here called steelfacing) has been used since the nineteenth century to harden the surface of a plate.

The technique appears to have been invented by the [[Housebook Master]], a south German fifteenth-century artist, all of whose prints are in drypoint only. Among the most famous artists of the old master print, Albrecht Dürer produced three drypoints before abandoning the technique; Rembrandt used it frequently, but usually in conjunction with etching and engraving.

&lt;/div&gt;
{{main|Lithography}}
[[File:Toulouse-Lautrec - Moulin Rouge - La Goulue.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[La Goulue]]'', Lithograph poster by [[Toulouse-Lautrec]].]]
[[Lithography]] is a technique invented in 1798 by [[Alois Senefelder]] and based on the [[Cohesion (chemistry)|chemical repulsion]] of [[oil]] and [[water]].
A porous surface, normally [[limestone]], is used; the image is drawn on the limestone with a greasy medium.
Acid is applied, transferring the grease-protected design to the limestone, leaving the image 'burned' into the surface. [[Gum arabic]], a water-soluble substance, is then applied, sealing the surface of the stone not covered with the drawing medium.
The stone is wetted, with water staying only on the surface not covered in grease-based residue of the drawing; the stone is then 'rolled up', meaning oil ink is applied with a roller covering the entire surface; since water repels the oil in the ink, the ink adheres only to the greasy parts, perfectly inking the image.
A sheet of dry paper is placed on the surface, and the image is transferred to the paper by the pressure of the printing press. Lithography is known for its ability to capture fine gradations in shading and very small detail.

A variant is [[photo-lithography]], in which the image is captured by photographic processes on metal plates; printing is carried out in the same way.

Another variant is [[halftone]] lithography, in which the image produced illustrates a gradient-like quality.

=== Screenprinting ===

[[Edward Ruscha]],
[[Andy Warhol]].
&lt;/div&gt;
{{main|Screenprinting}}
[[Screen printing]] (occasionally known as &quot;silkscreen&quot;, or &quot;serigraphy&quot;) creates prints by using a fabric stencil technique; ink is simply pushed through the stencil against the surface of the paper, most often with the aid of a squeegee. Generally, the technique uses a natural or synthetic 'mesh' fabric stretched tightly across a rectangular 'frame,' much like a stretched canvas. The fabric can be silk, nylon monofilament, multifilament polyester, or even stainless steel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://awt-gpi.com/product148.htm |title=Screen Fabric |website=A.W.T. World Trade Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While commercial screen printing often requires high-tech, mechanical apparatuses and calibrated materials, printmakers value it for the &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; approach, and the low technical requirements, high quality results. The essential tools required are a squeegee, a mesh fabric, a frame, and a stencil. Unlike many other printmaking processes, a printing press is not required, as screen printing is essentially stencil printing.

Screen printing may be adapted to printing on a variety of materials, from paper, cloth, and canvas to rubber, glass, and metal. Artists have used the technique to print on bottles, on slabs of granite, directly onto walls, and to reproduce images on textiles which would distort under pressure from printing presses.

=== Monotype ===
[[File:Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione - The Creation of Adam - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Monotype]] by the technique's inventor, [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]], ''The Creation of Adam'', c 1642]]
{{main|Monotyping}}
Monotyping is a type of printmaking made by drawing or painting on a smooth, non-absorbent surface. The surface, or matrix, was historically a copper etching plate, but in contemporary work it can vary from zinc or glass to acrylic glass. The image is then transferred onto a sheet of paper by pressing the two together, usually using a printing-press. Monotypes can also be created by inking an entire surface and then, using brushes or rags, removing ink to create a subtractive image, e.g. creating lights from a field of opaque color. The inks used may be oil based or water based. With oil based inks, the paper may be dry, in which case the image has more contrast, or the paper may be damp, in which case the image has a 10 percent greater range of tones.
[[File:Paul Gauguin, Arearea no Varua Ino (Words of the Devil) (recto), 1894, NGA 11586.jpg|alt=Watercolor monotype showing two women, one with her back to the viewer|left|thumb|[[Paul Gauguin]], ''Arearea no Varua Ino'' (Words of the Devil), [[Watercolor painting|watercolor]] monotype on Japan paper mounted on cardboard, 1894, [[National Gallery of Art|The National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C.]]
Unlike [[monoprinting]], monotyping produces a unique print, or monotype, because most of the ink is removed during the initial pressing. Although subsequent reprintings are sometimes possible, they differ greatly from the first print and are generally considered inferior. A second print from the original plate is called a &quot;ghost print&quot; or &quot;cognate&quot;. Stencils, watercolor, solvents, brushes, and other tools are often used to embellish a monotype print. Monotypes are often spontaneously executed and with no preliminary sketch.

Monotypes are the most painterly method among the printmaking techniques, a unique print that is essentially a printed painting. The principal characteristic of this medium is found in its spontaneity and its combination of printmaking, painting, and drawing media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://washingtonprintmakers.com/resources/techniques/monoprint Washington printmakers' gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228183408/http://washingtonprintmakers.com/resources/techniques/monoprint |date=2010-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monoprint ===
{{main|Monoprinting}}
Monoprinting is a form of printmaking that uses a matrix such as a woodblock, litho stone, or copper plate, but produces impressions that are unique. Multiple unique impressions printed from a single matrix are sometimes known as a variable edition. There are many techniques used in monoprinting, including [[collagraph]], [[collage]], hand-painted additions, and a form of tracing by which thick ink is laid down on a table, paper is placed on the ink, and the back of the paper is drawn on, transferring the ink to the paper. Monoprints can also be made by altering the type, color, and viscosity of the ink used to create different prints. Traditional printmaking techniques, such as lithography, woodcut, and intaglio, can be used to make monoprints.

=== Mixed-media prints ===
Mixed-media prints may use multiple traditional printmaking processes such as etching, woodcut, letterpress, silkscreen, or even monoprinting in the creation of the print. They may also incorporate elements of chine colle, collage, or painted areas, and may be unique, i.e. one-off, non-editioned, prints. Mixed-media prints are often experimental prints and may be printed on unusual, non-traditional surfaces.

=== Digital prints ===
&lt;div style=&quot;width:35%; float: right; margin: 10px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid #8888aa;&quot;&gt;Artists using this technique include
[[Istvan Horkay]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Enrique Chagoya]]
&lt;/div&gt;
{{main|Digital printing}}
Digital prints refers to images printed using digital printers such as [[Inkjet printing|inkjet printers]] instead of a traditional printing press. Images can be printed to a variety of substrates including paper, cloth, or plastic canvas.

====Dye-based inks====
Dye-based inks are [[organic compound|organic]] (not [[mineral]]) dissolved and mixed into a liquid. Although most are synthetic, derived from [[petroleum]], they can be made from vegetable or animal sources. Dyes are well suited for textiles where the liquid dye penetrates and chemically bonds to the fiber. Because of the deep penetration, more layers of material must lose their color before the fading is apparent. Dyes, however, are not suitable for the relatively thin layers of ink laid out on the surface of a print.

====Pigment-based inks====
Pigment is a finely ground, particulate substance which, when mixed or ground into a liquid to make ink or paint, does not dissolve, but remains dispersed or suspended in the liquid. Pigments are categorized as either [[inorganic]] (mineral) or organic (synthetic).&lt;ref name=&quot;MagnoliaFAQ&quot;&gt;[http://www.magnoliaeditions.com/pages/FAQs.htm Printmaking FAQ at Magnolia Editions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413021716/http://magnoliaeditions.com/pages/FAQs.htm |date=2009-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pigment-based inks have a much longer permanence than dye-based inks.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Carden, Digital Textile Printing, Bloomsbury Publishing - 2015, page 27&lt;/ref&gt;

====Giclée====
[[Giclée]] (pron.: /ʒiːˈkleɪ/ zhee-KLAY or /dʒiːˈkleɪ/), is a neologism coined in 1991 by printmaker Jack Duganne &lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Harald. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dq3Xj8zEYMIC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=giclee+prints+produced+on+epson#PPA11,M1 ''Mastering Digital Printing'', p.11] at Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; for digital prints made on inkjet printers. Originally associated with early dye-based printers it is now more often refers to pigment-based prints.&lt;ref&gt;Luong, Q.-Tuan. [http://www.largeformatphotography.info/digital-printing.html An overview of large format color digital printing] at largeformatphotography.info&lt;/ref&gt; The word is based on the French word gicleur, which means &quot;nozzle&quot;. Today fine art prints produced on large format ink-jet machines using the [[CcMmYK color model]] are generally called &quot;Giclée&quot;.

=== Foil imaging ===
In art, '''foil imaging''' is a printmaking technique made using the Iowa Foil Printer, developed by [[Virginia A. Myers]] from the commercial [[foil stamping]] process. This uses gold leaf and acrylic [[Foil (chemistry)|foil]] in the printmaking process.

== Color ==
[[File:Mishima Asa-Giri-東海道五十三次之内 三島 朝霧-Morning Mist MET DP123235.jpg|thumb|[[Hiroshige]], ''Morning Mist'']]
Printmakers apply color to their prints in many different ways. Some coloring techniques include positive surface roll, negative surface roll, and [[A la poupée]]. Often color in printmaking that involves etching, [[screen printing]], woodcut, or [[linocut]] is applied by either using separate plates, blocks or screens or by using a reductionist approach. In multiple plate color techniques, a number of plates, screens or blocks are produced, each providing a different color. Each separate plate, screen, or block will be inked up in a different color and applied in a particular sequence to produce the entire picture. On average about three to four plates are produced, but there are occasions where a printmaker may use up to seven plates. Every application of another plate of color will interact with the color already applied to the paper, and this must be kept in mind when producing the separation of colors. The lightest colors are often applied first, and then darker colors successively until the darkest.

The reductionist approach to producing color is to start with a lino or wood block that is either blank or with a simple etching. Upon each printing of color the printmaker will then further cut into the lino or woodblock removing more material and then apply another color and reprint. Each successive removal of lino or wood from the block will expose the already printed color to the viewer of the print. Picasso is often cited as the inventor of reduction printmaking, although there is evidence of this method in use 25 years before Picasso's linocuts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.printsandprintmaking.gov.au/catalogues/bibliography/136140/bunbury-alisa-not-picassos-invention--a-foray-into.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[subtractive color]] concept is also used in [[offset printing|offset]] or [[digital print]] and is present in bitmap or vectorial software in [[CMYK color model|CMYK]] or other color spaces.

== Registration ==
In printmaking processes requiring more than one application of ink or other medium, the problem exists as to how to line up properly areas of an image to receive ink in each application. The most obvious example of this would be a multi-color image in which each color is applied in a separate step. The lining up of the results of each step in a multistep printmaking process is called &quot;registration.&quot; Proper registration results in the various components of an image being in their proper place. But, for artistic reasons, improper registration is not necessarily the ruination of an image.

This can vary considerably from process to process. It generally involves placing the substrate, generally paper, in correct alignment with the printmaking element that will be supplying it with coloration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nontoxicprint.com/perfectregistration.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protective printmaking equipment ==
Protective clothing is very important for printmakers who engage in etching and lithography (closed toed shoes and long pants). Whereas in the past printmakers put their plates in and out of acid baths with their bare hands, today printmakers use rubber gloves.  They also wear industrial [[respirator]]s for protection from caustic vapors. Most acid baths are built with ventilation hoods above them.

Protective respirators and masks should have particle filters, particularly for aquatinting. As a part of the aquatinting process, a printmaker is often exposed to [[rosin]] powder.  Rosin is a serious health hazard, especially to printmakers who, in the past, simply used to hold their breath&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://smidgeonpress.wordpress.com/2014/09/08/printmaking-101-applying-rosin-for-aquatint-using-a-rosin-box/|title=Printmaking 101: Applying Rosin for Aquatint (Using a Rosin Box)|last=Smidgeon|date=2014-09-09|website=SMIDGEON PRESS|language=en|access-date=2019-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  using an aquatinting booth.

'''Curl''' is a [[reflection (computer science)|reflective]] [[object-oriented programming language]] for interactive [[web applications]] whose goal is to provide a smoother transition between formatting and programming. It makes it possible to embed complex objects in simple documents without needing to switch between programming languages or development platforms. The Curl implementation initially consisted of just an interpreter, but a compiler was added later.

Curl combines text markup (as in [[HTML]]), scripting (as in [[JavaScript]]), and heavy-duty computing (as in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], or [[C++]]) within one unified framework.  It is used in a range of internal enterprise, [[business-to-business|B2B]], and [[business-to-consumer|B2C]] applications.

Curl programs may be compiled into Curl applets, that are viewed using the Curl RTE, a [[runtime environment]] with a [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]] for [[web browser]]s. Currently, it is supported on [[Microsoft Windows]]. [[Linux]], and [[macOS]] was dropped on March 25, 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.curl.com/release/2019/20190325_1.html |publisher=SCSK Corporation |access-date=2020-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513081808/https://www.curl.com/release/2019/20190325_1.html |archive-date=2019-05-13 |url-status=live |title=Changes to Supported Operating Systems of Curl RTE Products }}&lt;/ref&gt; Curl supports [https://web.archive.org/web/20110708213458/http://developers.curl.com/userdocs/docs/en/dguide/detached.html &quot;detached applets&quot;], which is a web deployed applet which runs on the user's desktop independent of a browser window much as in [[Silverlight 3]] and [[Adobe AIR]].

SCSK announced on 2019-03-25 that Curl will stop new releases on Linux and MacOS, which means Curl will no longer run over Linux and MacOS from version 8.0.8.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.curl.com/release/2019/20190325_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The Curl language attempts to address a long-standing problem: the different building blocks that make up any modern web document most often require wildly different methods of implementation: different languages, different tools, different frameworks, often completely different teams. The final — and often most difficult — hurdle has been getting all of these blocks to communicate with each other in a consistent manner. Curl attempts to side-step these problems by providing a consistent syntactic and semantic interface at all levels of web content creation: from simple HTML to complex [[object-oriented programming]].

Curl is a [[markup language]] like HTML—that is, plain text is shown as text; at the same time, Curl includes an object-oriented programming language that supports [[multiple inheritance]]. Curl applications are not required to observe the separation of information, style, and behavior that HTML, [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS), and JavaScript have imposed, although that style of programming can be used in Curl if desired.

While the Curl language can be used as an HTML replacement for presenting formatted text, its abilities range all the way to those of a compiled, strongly typed, object-oriented system programming language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cag.lcs.mit.edu/curl/wwwpaper.html |title=Curl: A Gentle Slope Language for the Web |author1=M. Hostetter |author2=D. Kranz |author3=C. Seed |author4=C. Terman |author5=S. Ward |publisher=MIT Laboratory for Computer Science |access-date=2005-12-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224002953/http://www.cag.lcs.mit.edu/curl/wwwpaper.html |archive-date=2008-12-24 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the authoring (HTML-level) and programming constructs of Curl can be extended in user code. The language is designed so Curl applications can be compiled to native code of the client machine by a [[just-in-time compilation|just-in-time compiler]] and run at high speed. Curl applets can also be written so that they will run off-line when disconnected from the network ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100102031426/http://curl.com/solutions_computing.php occasionally connected computing]). In fact, the [http://www.curl.com/products/prod/ide/old_ide.html Curl IDE] is an application written in Curl.

==Articles and determiners==
{{main|French articles and determiners}}

[[Article (grammar)|Articles]] and [[determiner (linguistics)|determiners]] agree in gender and number with the noun they determine; unlike with nouns, this inflection is made in speech as well as in writing.

French has three articles: definite, indefinite, and partitive. The difference between the definite and indefinite articles is similar to that in English (definite: ''the''; indefinite: ''a'', ''an''), except that the indefinite article has a plural form (similar to ''some'', though English normally doesn't use an article before indefinite plural nouns). The partitive article is similar to the indefinite article but used for uncountable singular nouns.

==Adjectives==
An adjective must agree in gender and number with the noun it modifies. French adjectives therefore have four forms: masculine singular, feminine singular, masculine plural, and feminine plural. A few adjectives have a fifth form, viz. an additional masculine singular form for use in liaison before a noun beginning with a vowel or a &quot;mute h&quot;, e.g. un '''beau''' jardin, un '''bel''' homme, une '''belle''' femme, de '''beaux''' enfants, de '''belles''' maisons ''(a beautiful garden, a handsome man, a beautiful woman, beautiful children, beautiful houses)''. This fifth form, which is older, is sometimes used elsewhere in set phrases, e.g. Philippe le '''Bel''' ([[Philip the Fair]] or the Handsome of France, 1268&amp;ndash;1314) vs. Philippe le '''Beau''' ([[Philip the Handsome]] or the Fair of Castile, 1478&amp;ndash;1506).

The masculine singular, an adjective's basic form, is listed in dictionaries. The feminine singular is normally formed by adding ''-e'' to the basic form. This ''-e'' is mute, which makes many masculine and feminine forms [[homophone|homophonous]] (cf. ''civil &gt; civile'' 'civil', both pronounced /sivil/). However, the ending causes &quot;mute&quot; final sounds to be pronounced, whereby masculine-feminine pairs become distinguishable in pronunciation if the masculine form ends in a mute consonant, which is the case with a great deal of adjectives (cf. ''lourd'' {{IPA|[luʁ]}} ''&gt; lourde'' {{IPA|[luʁd]}} 'heavy'). Under certain circumstances, other minor changes occur in the formation of feminine forms, such as the placement of an accent, the doubling of a consonant, or its replacement with another, changes that often reflect the pronunciation of such endings (cf. ''bon'' [bɔ̃] &gt; ''bonne'' [bɔn] 'good'; ''heureux'' [øʁø] &gt; ''heureuse'' [øʁøːz] 'happy'). Irregular feminine forms include ''beau &gt; belle'' 'beautiful', ''blanc &gt; blanche'' 'white', and a limited number of others. If an adjective's basic form ends in ''-e'', it is left unchanged in the feminine (cf. ''riche &gt; riche'' 'rich').

The plural is normally formed by adding ''-s'' to the singular (masculine and feminine). This ''-s'' is usually mute, but pronounced {{IPA|[z]}} in [[liaison (French)|liaison]] with a following noun that begins with a vowel. Unlike liaison after plural nouns, liaison after plural adjectives is common and even obligatory in standard usage. If the basic form ends in ''-s, -x'', or ''-z'', an adjective is left unchanged in the masculine plural (cf. ''doux &gt; doux'' 'soft, gentle'). A few adjectives take the (also mute) ending ''-x'' in the masculine plural (cf. ''nouveau &gt; nouveaux'' 'new'). Plural forms that are distinguishable from the singular outside of liaison environments occur only with adjectives ending in ''-al''. These normally have ''-aux'' in the masculine plural (cf. ''central'' {{IPA|[sɑ᷉tʁal]}} ''&gt; centraux'' {{IPA|[sɑ᷉tʁo]}} 'central'). By contrast, the feminine plural is formed according to the general rule: ''centrale &gt; centrales''.

Due to the aforementioned rules, French adjectives might have four distinguished written forms which are all pronounced the same. This is the case if an adjective's masculine and feminine forms are homophonous and if there is no liaison between the adjective and a following noun.

|}

On the other hand, if the masculine and feminine forms have different pronunciations and liaison does occur, all four forms can be distinguishable in pronunciation. Adjective declension is therefore important in spoken French, though to a lesser extent than in writing. (All forms distinguished in pronunciation are also distinguished in writing, but not vice versa.)

Due to the peculiar [[French orthography|orthography of French]], which denotes mute final consonants, most feminine forms seem regular in terms of their spelling because they are formed by adding ''-e'' to the masculine form, e.g., ''grand &gt; grand'''e''', lent &gt; lent'''e''', persan &gt; persan'''e'''''. However, if we put this etymologic orthography aside and consider only current pronunciation, the formation of French female forms becomes quite irregular with several possible &quot;endings&quot;: {{IPA|[ɡʁɑ̃]}} &gt; {{IPA|[ɡʁɑ̃'''d''']}}, {{IPA|[lɑ̃]}} &gt; {{IPA|[lɑ̃'''t''']}}, {{IPA|[pɛʁsɑ̃]}} &gt; {{IPA|[pɛʁs'''an''']}}.

Most adjectives, when used attributively, appear after their nouns: ''le vin '''rouge''''' (&quot;the ''red'' wine&quot;). A number of adjectives (often having to do with beauty, age, goodness, or size, a tendency summarized by the acronym &quot;BAGS&quot;), come before their nouns: ''une '''belle''' femme'' (&quot;a ''beautiful'' woman&quot;). With a few adjectives of the latter type, there are two masculine singular forms: one used before consonants (the basic form), and one used before vowels. For example, the adjective ''beau'' (&quot;beautiful&quot;) changes form from ''un '''beau''' garçon'' (&quot;a ''handsome'' boy&quot;) to ''un '''bel''' homme'' (&quot;a ''handsome'' man&quot;). Some adjectives change position depending on their meaning, sometimes preceding their nouns and sometimes following them. For example, ''ancien'' means &quot;former&quot; when it precedes its noun, but &quot;ancient&quot; when it follows it. To give another example, ''un homme '''grand''''' means &quot;a ''tall'' man&quot;, whereas ''un '''grand''' homme'' means &quot;a ''great'' man&quot;.

Many compound words contain an adjective, such as ''une '''belle'''-mère'' &quot;a mother-in-law&quot;, which is distinct from ''une '''belle''' mère'' &quot;a beautiful mother&quot;. Some of them use an [[archaism|archaic]] form of the feminine adjective that lacks the final ''-e''. These used to be written with an apostrophe, but a hyphen is now (at least since 1960) considered more correct: ''&lt;s&gt;une '''grand'&amp;zwj;'''route&lt;/s&gt; une '''grand-'''route'' &quot;a main country road&quot;, which is distinct from ''une '''grande''' route'' &quot;a long way&quot;, and ''&lt;s&gt;une '''grand'&amp;zwj;'''-mère&lt;/s&gt; une '''grand-'''mère'' &quot;a grandmother&quot;, which is distinct from '''''une grande''' mère'' &quot;a tall mother&quot;.

==Adverbs==
{{main|French adverbs}}

As in English, [[adverb]]s in French are used to modify adjectives, other adverbs, verbs, or clauses. Most adverbs are derived from an adjective by adding the suffix ''-ment'', usually to its feminine form (''-ment'' is analogous to the English suffix ''-ly''): e.g. ''anciennement'' &quot;anciently&quot;, &quot;of old&quot;, &quot;in olden times&quot;; ''grandement'' &quot;greatly&quot;; ''lentement'' &quot;slowly&quot;; though there are some systematic deviations (e.g. ''patient'' → ''patiemment'' &quot;patiently&quot;, ''malaisé'' → ''malaisément'' &quot;uneasily&quot;), some adverbs are derived irregularly (''bon'' &quot;good&quot; → ''bien'' &quot;well&quot;) and others do not derive from adjectives at all.

Adverbs themselves are generally invariable. An exception to this is the adverb ''tout'' &quot;wholly, very&quot; which agrees in gender and number with the adjective it modifies when it is in the feminine and begins with a consonant (e.g. ''tout petit'' &quot;very small, m.s.&quot;, ''tous petits'' &quot;very small, m.pl.&quot; but ''toute petite'' &quot;very small, f.s.&quot;, ''toutes petites'' &quot;very small, f.pl.&quot; — when beginning with a vowel however: ''tout entier, tout entiers, tout entière, tout entières'' &quot;completely, as a whole&quot; (with [[liaison (French)|liaison]])).

==Prepositions==
French prepositions link two related parts of a sentence. In word order, they are placed in front of a noun in order to specify the relationship between the noun and the verb, adjective, or other noun that precedes it. Some common French prepositions are: ''à'' (to, at, in), ''à côté de'' (next to, beside), ''après'' (after), ''au sujet de'' (about, on the subject of), ''avant'' (before), ''avec'' (with), ''chez'' (at the home/office of, among), ''contre'' (against), ''dans'' (in), ''d'après'' (according to), ''de'' (from, of, about), ''depuis'' (since, for), ''derrière'' (in back of, behind), ''devant'' (in front of), ''durant'' (during, while), ''en'' (in, on, to), ''en dehors de'' (outside of), ''en face de'' (facing, across from), ''entre'' (between), ''envers'' (toward), ''environ'' (approximately), ''hors de'' (outside of), ''jusque'' (until, up to, even), ''loin de'' (far from), ''malgré'' (despite), ''par'' (by, through), ''parmi'' (among), ''pendant'' (during), ''pour'' (for), ''près de'' (near), ''quant à'' (as for, regarding), ''sans'' (without), ''selon'' (according to), ''sous'' (under), ''suivant'' (according to), ''sur'' (on), ''vers'' (toward).

==Pronouns==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Pronoun]] --&gt;
{{main|French pronouns}}

In French [[pronouns]] can be inflected to indicate their role in a clause (subject, direct object, etc.), as well as the person, gender, and number of their referent. Not all of these inflections may be present at once; for example, the [[relative pronoun]] ''que'' (''that'', ''which'', ''whom'') may have any referent, while the [[possessive pronoun]] ''le mien'' (''mine'') may have any role in a clause.

As noted above, French (like English) is a non-pro-drop (&quot;pronoun-dropping&quot;) language; therefore, pronouns feature prominently in the language. Impersonal verbs (e.g., ''pleuvoir'' – ''to rain'') use the impersonal pronoun ''il'' (analogous to English ''it'').

French object pronouns are all [[clitic]]s. Some appear so consistently – especially in everyday speech — that some{{Who|date=February 2012}} have commented that French could almost be considered to demonstrate [[polypersonal agreement]].

==Negation==
French usually expresses negation in two parts, with the [[Grammatical particle|particle]] ''ne'' attached to the verb, and one or more negative words ([[connegative]]s) that modify the verb or one of its [[Argument (linguistics)|arguments]]. Negation encircles a conjugated verb with ''ne'' after the subject and the connegative after verb, if the verb is [[finite verb|finite]] or a [[gerund]]. However, both parts of the negation come before the targeted verb when it is in its [[infinitive]] form. For example:
* ''Je les ai pris'' 'I took them' → ''Je '''ne''' les ai '''pas''' pris'' 'I did not take them'
* ''Je voudrais regarder un film et m'endormir'' 'I would like to watch a movie and fall asleep' &lt;br /&gt;→ ''Je voudrais regarder un film et '''ne''' '''pas''' m'endormir.'' 'I would like to watch a movie and '''not''' fall asleep'

Other negative words used in combination with ''ne'' are:
* negative adverbs
:''ne … plus'' — &quot;not anymore, no longer&quot;
:''ne … jamais'' — &quot;never&quot;
:''ne … nulle part'' — &quot;nowhere&quot;
:''ne … guère'' — &quot;not much, hardly&quot; (literary)
:''ne … point / aucunement / nullement'' — &quot;not, not at all&quot; (literary)
* negative pronouns
:''ne … rien'' — &quot;nothing&quot;
:''ne … personne'' — &quot;nobody&quot;
* others
:(determiner) ''ne … aucun'' — &quot;no/not any&quot; (also ''nul'', literary)
:(restrictive particle) ''ne … que'' — &quot;only&quot;

Examples:
* « Je '''ne''' sais '''pas'''. » — &quot;I do not know.&quot;
* « Il '''ne''' fume '''plus'''. » — &quot;He does not smoke anymore.&quot;
* « Nous '''n''''avons vu '''personne'''. » — &quot;We did not see anybody.&quot;
* « Elle '''n''''a '''rien''' bu. » — &quot;She didn't drink anything.&quot;
* « Je '''n''''ai '''aucune''' idée. » — &quot;I have no idea.&quot;
* « Vous '''ne''' mangez '''que''' des légumes ? » — &quot;You only eat vegetables?&quot;

The negative adverbs (and ''rien'') follow finite verbs but precede infinitives (along with ''ne''):
* « Il prétend ne pas/ne jamais/ne rien fumer. » — &quot;He claims not to smoke/to never smoke/to smoke nothing.&quot;

Moreover, it is possible for ''rien'' and ''personne'' to be used as the subject of a sentence, which moves them to the beginning of the sentence (before the ''ne''):
* « Rien n'est certain. » — &quot;Nothing is certain.&quot;
* « Personne n'est arrivé. » — &quot;Nobody came.&quot;

Several negative words (other than ''pas'') can appear in the same sentence, but the sentence is still usually interpreted as a simple negation. When another negative word occurs with ''pas'', a double negation interpretation usually arises, but this construction is criticised.
* « Elle n'a '''plus''' '''jamais''' '''rien''' dit à '''personne'''. » — &quot;She never said anything else to anybody.&quot;
* « Elle n'a '''pas''' vu '''personne'''.  — &quot;She did not see nobody (i.e., she saw somebody).&quot;

=== Colloquial usage ===
In colloquial French, it is common to drop the ''ne'', although this can create some ambiguity with the ''ne … plus'' construction when written down, as ''plus'' could mean either &quot;more&quot; or &quot;not anymore&quot;. Generally when ''plus'' is used to mean &quot;more&quot;, the final &quot;s&quot; is pronounced ([plys]) whereas it is never pronounced when used to mean &quot;not anymore&quot; ([ply]).

As an example, the informal sentence ''Il y en a plus'' could be pronounced with the final [s] ([il i ɑ̃n a plys, jɑ̃n a plys]) to mean &quot;There is more&quot;. Or it could be pronounced without it ([il i ɑ̃n a ply, jɑ̃n a ply]) to mean &quot;There is none left&quot;.

=== Independent ''ne'' ===
In certain, mostly literary constructions, ''ne'' can express negation by itself (without ''pas'' or another negative word). The four verbs that can use this construction are ''pouvoir'' (&quot;to be able to&quot;), ''savoir'' (&quot;to know&quot;), ''oser'' (&quot;to dare&quot;), and ''cesser'' (&quot;to cease&quot;).
* (standard, ''ne'' + ''pas'') « Je '''n''''ai '''pas''' pu venir. » — &quot;I was not able to come.&quot;
* (casual, ''pas'' only) « J'ai '''pas''' pu venir. » [same]
* (literary, ''ne'' only) « Je '''n''''ai pu venir. » [same];&lt;br /&gt;''cf.'' phrase « Je '''ne''' sais quoi » — &quot;I do not know what [it is]&quot; remaining in colloquial speech as a [[Fossilization (linguistics)|fossilized]] phrase

=== Expletive ''ne'' ===
In certain cases in formal French, the word ''ne'' can be used without signifying negation; the ''ne'' in such instances is known as expletive ''ne'' (French: ''ne explétif):

:« J'ai peur que cela '''ne''' se reproduise. » — &quot;I am afraid that it might happen again.&quot;
:« Il est arrivé avant que nous '''n''''ayons commencé. » — &quot;He arrived before we started.&quot;
:« Ils sont plus nombreux que tu '''ne''' le crois. » — &quot;There are more of them than you think.&quot;

Expletive ''ne'' is found in finite subordinate clauses (never before an infinitive). It is characteristic of literary rather than colloquial style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.lawlessfrench.com/grammar/ne-expletif/ | title = Ne explétif - French Negation | publisher = Lawless French | first = Laura K | last = Lawless | accessdate = 2007-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other registers French tends to not use any negation at all in such clauses, e.g., ''J'ai peur que cela se reproduise''.

The following contexts allow expletive ''ne''
* the complement clause of verbs expressing fear or avoidance: ''craindre'' (to fear), ''avoir peur'' (to be afraid), ''empêcher'' (to prevent), ''éviter'' (to avoid)
* the complement clause of verbs expressing doubt or denial: ''douter'' (to doubt), ''nier'' (to deny)
* [[adverbial clause]]s introduced by the following expressions: ''avant que'' (before), ''à moins que'' (unless), ''de peur/crainte que'' (for fear that)
* comparative constructions expressing inequality: ''autre'' (other), ''meilleur'' (better), ''plus fort'' (stronger), ''moins intelligent'' (less intelligent), etc.

==Existential clauses==
In French, the equivalent of the English [[existential clause]] &quot;there is&quot; is expressed with ''il y a'', literally, &quot;it there has&quot; or &quot;it has to it&quot;.  The verb may be conjugated to indicate tense, but always remains in the third person singular. For example
* « Il y a deux bergers et quinze moutons dans le pré. » - &quot;There are two shepherds and fifteen sheep in the meadow.&quot;
* « Il y aura beaucoup à manger. » - &quot;There will be a lot to eat.&quot;
* « Il y aurait deux morts et cinq blessés dans l'accident. » - &quot;There appears to have been (lit. would have) two dead and five injured in the accident.&quot; (as in news reporting)
* « Il n'y avait personne chez les Martin. » - &quot;There was nobody at the Martins' home.&quot;

This construction is also used to express the passage of time since an event occurred, like the English ''ago'' or ''it has been'':
* « Je l'ai vu il y a deux jours. » - &quot;I saw him two days ago.&quot;
* « Il y avait longtemps que je ne l'avais pas vu. » - &quot;It had been a long time since I had seen him.&quot;
* « Le langage d’il y a cent ans est très différent de celui d’aujourd’hui. » - &quot;The language/usage of one hundred years ago is very different from that of today.&quot;

In informal speech, ''il y'' is typically reduced to [j], as in:
* Y a [ja] deux bergers et quinze moutons dans le pré.
* Y aura [joʁa] beaucoup à manger.
* Y avait [javɛ] personne chez les Martin.
* Je l'ai vu y a deux jours.

== Word order ==
The components of a declarative clause are typically arranged in the following order (though not all components are always present):
# Adverbial(s)
# Subject
# ne (usually a marker for negation, though it has some other uses)
# First- and second-person object pronoun (me, te, nous, vous) or the third-person reflexive pronoun (se)
# Third-person direct-object pronoun (le, la, les)
# Third-person indirect-object pronoun (lui or leur)
# The pronoun y
# The pronoun en
# Finite verb (may be an auxiliary)
# Adverbial(s)
# (second marker for negation) The pronouns pas, rien, personne, aucun.e, peu, que (if not subject)
# Main verb (if the finite verb is an auxiliary)
# Adverbial(s) 
# Direct object
# Indirect object
# Adverbial(s)

:&lt;small&gt;Note that what is called in English (and above) an ''indirect object'' is in many cases called ''complément circonstanciel d'attribution'' according to French grammar conventions (e.g. in ''donner quelque chose à quelqu'un'' “to give sth. to s.o.” or “to give s.o. sth.”). What the French call ''complément d'objet indirect'' is a complement introduced by an essentially void ''à'' or ''de'' (at least in the case of a noun) required by some particular, otherwise intransitive, verbs: e.g. ''Les cambrioleurs ont profité de mon absence'' “the robbers took advantage of my absence” — but the essentially synonymous ''les cambrioleurs ont mis mon absence à profit'' has a direct object instead. Unlike in English, in French neither an indirect object nor a circumstantial can become the subject of the passive voice: ''He was given a book'' has no direct equivalent in French.&lt;/small&gt;

French basic word order is thus [[subject–verb–object]] (''Je lisais un livre'': I was reading a book) although, if the object is a [[clitic]] pronoun, it precedes the verb (''Je le lisais'': I was reading it). Some types of sentences allow for or require different word orders, in particular [[inversion (linguistics)|inversion]] of the subject and verb. For example, some adverbial expressions placed at the beginning of a sentence trigger inversion of pronominal subjects: ''Peut-être est-elle partie'' (Maybe she has left).

Word order can be an indicator of stylistic [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]]. For instance, inversion of nominal subjects is possible in many relative clauses.
* C'est le livre [que mon cousin lui a donné]. (Object–subject–verb)
* C'est le livre [que lui a donné mon cousin]. (Object–verb–subject)
:&quot;That's the book my cousin gave her.&quot;
The second version of the sentence, with inversion, is more formal.

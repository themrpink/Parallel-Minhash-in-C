=== University===
{{see also|University of Sassari}}
The University of Sassari is the oldest in Sardinia (founded by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in 1562), and has a high reputation, especially in Jurisprudence, Veterinary Medicine, Medicine, and Agriculture.  Its libraries contain a number of ancient documents, among them the [[condaghe]]s, Sardinia's first legal codes and the first documents written in the [[Sardinian language]] (11th century) and the famous [[Carta de Logu]] (the constitution issued by [[Marianus IV of Arborea]] and updated later by his daughter the ''Giudichessa'' [[Eleanor of Arborea]]) in the 14th century.

The University of Sassari gained first place in 2009 in the ranking for the best “medium-sized” Italian university, awarded by the Censis Research Institute.

===Language===
[[File:Dialetti corsi.png|thumb|right|The Sassarese compared to Corsican dialects]]
{{see also|Sassarese language}}

[[Sassarese]] (''Sassaresu'' or ''Turritanu'') is much closer to [[Corsican language|Corsican]] and [[Tuscan language]] than it is to [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]], although this fact has caused some political controversy. It originated as a [[lingua franca]] between the first [[Sardinians]], [[Corsicans]], [[Toscana|Tuscans]] and [[Liguria]]n people, during the period of the [[maritime republics]]. The original [[Tuscan language|Tuscan structure]] was influenced by the [[Logudorese dialect|Sardinian Logudorese]] spoken in the area, with a strong influence that can be felt in its phonetics and vocabulary, and by [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] in vocabulary.

Sassarese is spoken in Sassari and its immediate area by approximately 120,000 people out a total population of 175,000 inhabitants; it is also the language of the north-west of Sardinia, including [[Stintino]], [[Sorso]] and [[Porto Torres]]; in the mid-northern areas of Sardinia, its ''Castellanesi'' dialects of [[Castelsardo]], [[Tergu]] and [[Sedini]] are more similar to the [[Gallurese]].

===Festivals and traditions===
[[File:Discesacandelierisassari.jpg|thumb|right|''Faradda di li candareri'']]
* The ''[[Faradda di li candareri]]'' (''The Descent of the Candelieri''): it's a  devotional procession, in which enormous wooden candles are carried by members of the city [[guilds]] from the town centre to the church of Santa Maria of Betlem, in commemoration of the end of the plague in 1582, but it probably has older origins, from a cultural tradition from [[Pisa]] that as early as in the second half of the 13th century was practiced in some parts of Sardinia.
* The ''[[Cavalcata Sarda]]'' (the Sardinian Cavalcade), a main event in Sardinia. On the last Sunday of May thousands of people come from all over Sardinia to Sassari to parade through the city in their local folk costumes on foot and ride on hundreds of the best Sardinian horses.
* ''[[Sardinia Film Festival]]'' was founded in 2006. With 500 films, [[short subjects]], [[animated cartoons]] and  [[documentaries]] in 2009, it has become the most prominent [[film festival]] in Sardinia.

'''''Pane carasau''''' ({{IPA-srd|ˈpane ɣaɾaˈzau|lang}}, {{IPA-it|ˈpaːne karaˈzau|lang}}; &quot;toasted bread&quot; in [[Sardinian language]], from the past participle of the Sardinian verb {{lang|sc|carasare}} &quot;to toast&quot;, referring to the crust) is a traditional [[flatbread]] from [[Sardinia]]. It is also called {{lang|it|carta da musica}} in Italian, meaning &quot;[[music sheet]]&quot;, in reference to its large and paper-thin shape, which is said to be so thin before cooking that a sheet of music can be read through it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingarthurflour.com/blog/2010/06/21/steam-power-carta-di-musica/|title=Steam power! Carta di musica|last=Hamel|first=PJ|date=21 June 2010|publisher=King Arthur Flour|accessdate=6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bread is thin and crisp, usually in the form of a dish half a meter wide. It is made by taking baked flat bread (made of [[durum wheat]] flour, salt, [[Baker's yeast|yeast]], and water), then separating it into two sheets which are baked again. The recipe is very ancient and was conceived for [[shepherd]]s, who used to stay far from home for months at a time: ''pane carasau'' can last up to one year if it is kept dry. The bread can be eaten either dry or wet (with water, wine, or sauces). A similar, yeast-free bread, with added seasoning, is known as {{lang|sc|pane guttiau}} &quot;dripped bread&quot;.

Remains of the bread were found in archeological excavations of [[nuraghe]]s (traditional Sardinian stone buildings) and it was therefore already eaten on the island prior to 1000 BC.

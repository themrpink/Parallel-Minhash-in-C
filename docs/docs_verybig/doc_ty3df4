(Silhouette drawing by [[Otto Böhler (artist)|Otto Böhler]])]]

As a young man Bruckner sang in men's choirs and wrote music for them. [[Weltliche Chorwerke (Bruckner)|Bruckner's secular choral music]] was mostly written for choral societies. The texts are always in German. Some of these works were written specifically for private occasions such as weddings, funerals, birthdays or name-days, many of these being dedicated to friends and acquaintances of the composer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mwv.at/english/TextBruckner/Katalog/liederWelt.htm |title=Anton Bruckner's Critical Complete Edition – Songs and secular choral works |publisher=Mwv.at |access-date=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This music is rarely performed. Biographer Derek Watson characterizes the pieces for men's choir as being &quot;of little concern to the non-German listener&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Watson, ''Bruckner''. New York: Schuster &amp; Macmillan (1997): 72. &quot;They are of little concern to the non-German listener and do not represent important stages in Bruckner's creative unfolding.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Of about 30 such pieces, a most unusual and evocative composition is the song [[Abendzauber, WAB 57|''Abendzauber'']] (1878) for men's choir, man soloist, [[yodeler]]s and four [[Horn (instrument)|horns]].

Bruckner also composed 20 [[Lieder (Bruckner)|Lieder]], of which only a few have been published. The Lieder that Bruckner composed in 1861–1862 during his tuition by Otto Kitzler have not been WAB classified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abruckner.com/vocal_instrumental_music/php/index.php@pag=008.htm|title=Discography of Bruckner's secular choral music by Hans Roelofs |publisher=Brucknerdiskografie.nl. |access-date=19 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the [[Austrian National Library]] was able to acquire a facsimile of the [[Kitzler Study Book|''Kitzler-Studienbuch'']], the autograph manuscript hitherto unavailable to the public. The facsimile is edited by Paul Hawkshaw and Erich Wolfgang Partsch in Band XXV of Bruckner's ''{{lang|de|Gesamtausgabe}}''.&lt;ref name=&quot;MWV&quot;&gt;[http://www.mwv.at/english/TextBruckner/Katalog/kitzler_studybook.htm Kitzler Study Book – Facsimile] {{ISBN|978-3-900270-99-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruckner composed also five [[Cantatas (Bruckner)|name-day cantatas]], as well as two patriotic cantatas, ''[[Germanenzug]]'' and ''[[Helgoland (Bruckner)|Helgoland]]'', on texts by [[August Silberstein]]. ''Germanenzug'' (WAB 70), composed in 1863–1864, was Bruckner's first published work. ''Helgoland'' (WAB 71), for [[SATB|TTBB]] men's choir and large orchestra, was composed in 1893 and was Bruckner's last completed composition and the only secular vocal work that he thought worthy enough to bequeath to the Austrian National Library.

=== Other works ===
During his apprenticeship with Otto Kitzler, Bruckner composed [[Four Orchestral Pieces (Bruckner)#Three Orchestral Pieces|three short orchestral pieces]] and a [[Four Orchestral Pieces (Bruckner)#March in D minor|March in D minor]] as orchestration exercises. At that time he also wrote an [[Overture (Bruckner)|Overture in G minor]]. These works, which are occasionally included in recordings of the symphonies, show already hints of Bruckner's emerging style.

A [[String Quartet (Bruckner)|String Quartet]] in C minor and the additional [[Rondo in C minor (Bruckner)|Rondo in C minor]], also composed in 1862, were discovered decades after Bruckner's death. The later [[String Quintet (Bruckner)|String Quintet]] in F Major of 1879, contemporaneous with the Fifth and Sixth symphonies, has been frequently performed. The [[Intermezzo in D minor (Bruckner)|Intermezzo in D minor]], which was intended to replace its scherzo, is not frequently performed.

A ''[[Symphonic Prelude (Bruckner)|Symphonisches Präludium]]'' (Symphonic Prelude) in C minor was discovered by Mahler scholar Paul Banks in the Austrian National Library in 1974 in a piano duet transcription. Banks ascribed it to [[Gustav Mahler]], and had it orchestrated by Albrecht Gürsching. In 1985 Wolfgang Hiltl, who had retrieved the original score by Rudolf Krzyzanowski, had it published by Doblinger (issued in 2002). According to scholar [[Benjamin-Gunnar Cohrs]], the stylistic examination of this &quot;prelude&quot; shows that it is all Bruckner's. Possibly Bruckner had given a draft-score to his pupil Krzyzanowski, which already contained the string parts and some important lines for woodwind and brass, as an exercise in instrumentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abruckner.com/Data/articles/articlesEnglish/cohrsprelude/bg_cohrs_bruckner_symphonic_prelude_100817.pdf |title=Benjamin-Gunnar Cohrs: '&amp;#39;Symphonisches Präludium – Composed by Anton Bruckner?'&amp;#39;, 2006/rev.2010 |format=PDF |access-date=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Two Aequali (Bruckner)|Bruckner's Two Aequali]] of 1847 for three trombones are solemn, brief works. The [[Military march (Bruckner)|Military march]] of 1865 is an occasional work as a gesture of appreciation for the ''Militär-Kapelle der Jäger-Truppe'' of Linz. [[Abendklänge, WAB 110|''Abendklänge'']] of 1866 is a short [[character piece]] for violin and piano.

Bruckner also wrote a Lancer-Quadrille ({{circa|1850}}) and a few other [[Piano works (Bruckner)|small works for piano]]. Most of this music was written for teaching purposes. Sixteen other pieces for piano, which Bruckner composed in 1862 during his tuition by Kitzler, have not been WAB classified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brucknerdiskografie.nl/php/index.php?pag=012 |title=Discography of Bruckner's piano works by Hans Roelofs |publisher=Brucknerdiskografie.nl. |access-date=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A facsimile of these pieces is found in the ''Kitzler-Studienbuch''.&lt;ref name=&quot;MWV&quot;/&gt;

Bruckner was a renowned organist at the [[St. Florian Monastery|St Florian's Priory]], where he improvised frequently. Those improvisations were usually not transcribed, so that only a few of his [[Organ works (Bruckner)|works for organ]] has survived. The five Preludes in E-flat major (1836–1837), classified WAB 127 and WAB 128, as well as a few other WAB-unclassified works, which have been found in Bruckner's ''Präludienbuch'', are probably not by Bruckner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abruckner.com/vocal_instrumental_music/php/index.php@pag=011.htm|title=Bruckner's organ works listed and commented by Hans Roelofs |publisher=Brucknerdiskografie.nl. |access-date=19 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruckner never wrote an opera, and as much as he was a fan of Wagner's music dramas, he was uninterested in drama.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Watson, ''Bruckner''. New York: Schuster &amp; Macmillan (1997): 19. &quot;Studying ''Tristan'' Bruckner used a piano score without text – a sign of how unconcerned he was with opera as drama.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893 he thought about writing an opera called ''Astra'' based on a novel by [[Gertrud Bollé-Hellmund]].&lt;ref&gt;Derek Watson, ''Bruckner'' (1997) New York: Schuster &amp; Macmillan, p.s 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;
Although he attended performances of Wagner's operas, he was much more interested in the music than the plot. After seeing Wagner's ''[[Götterdämmerung]]'', he asked: &quot;Tell me, why did they burn the woman at the end?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Keith William Kinder, ''The Wind and Wind-chorus Music of Anton Bruckner''. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Publishing Group (2000): 51, note 14&lt;/ref&gt; Nor did Bruckner ever write an oratorio.

=== Bruckner Gesamtausgabe ===
{{main|Bruckner Gesamtausgabe}}

Published by Musikwissenschaftlicher Verlag in Vienna, the ''{{lang|de|Bruckner Kritische Gesamtausgabe}}'' (Bruckner's Critical Complete Edition) comprises three successive editions.
*The first edition (1934–1944, Editorial Head: Robert Haas) included 'hybrid' scores for Symphonies 2 and 8 and other similar conflations for some other revised works.
*In the second edition (1951–1989, Editorial Head: [[Leopold Nowak]]) Nowak ''et al.'' went about publishing several versions of some works, in the process correcting some mistakes of Haas. After Nowak's resignation, (1990 onwards, Editorial Head: Herbert Vogg) William Carragan, Paul Hawkshaw, [[Benjamin-Gunnar Cohrs]] ''et al.'' are in the process of reviewing and further correcting the work of Haas and Nowak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mwv.at/TextBruckner/BruckStart/BruckStart.htm |title=ANTON BRUCKNER (1824–1896) – KRITISCHE GESAMTAUSGABE |publisher=Mwv.at |access-date=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2011 it has been decided to issue a new edition (Editorial board: Paul Hawkshaw, Thomas Leibnitz, Andreas Lindner, Angela Pachovsky, Thomas Röder), which will include the content of the current edition and integrate the in the meantime retrieved sources.

== Reception in the 20th century ==
Because of the long duration and vast orchestral canvas of much of his music, Bruckner's popularity has greatly benefited from the introduction of long-playing media and from improvements in recording technology.

Decades after his death, the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazis]] strongly approved of Bruckner's music because they saw it as expressing the [[zeitgeist]] of the [[Germans|German]] [[volk]], and [[Hitler]] even consecrated a bust of Bruckner in a widely photographed ceremony in 1937 at [[Regensburg]]'s [[Walhalla temple]]. Bruckner's music was among the most popular in [[Nazi Germany]].

Near the end of World War II, [[Adolf Hitler]] became enamored of the music of Bruckner, and, as a result, planned to convert the monastery of St. Florian in Linz – where Bruckner had played the organ, and where he was buried – into a repository of Bruckner's manuscripts.  Hitler evicted the monks from the building and personally paid for the restoration of the organ and the institution of a Bruckner study center there.  He also paid for the Haas collection of Bruckner's works to be published, and himself purchased material for the proposed library. Additionally, Hitler caused the founding of the Bruckner Symphony Orchestra, which began presenting concerts in Fall 1943.  His plan for one of the bell towers in Linz to play a theme from Bruckner's Fourth Symphony never came to pass.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Evans|Evans, Richard J.]] (2008) ''[[The Third Reich at War]]''. New York: [[Penguin Books]]. p.579. {{isbn|978-0-14-311671-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Adagio from Bruckner's Seventh Symphony was broadcast by German radio (Deutscher Reichsrundfunk) when it announced the news of [[Hitler's death]] on 1 May 1945.

Today the [[Brucknerhaus]] in Linz, which opened in 1974, is named after him.

The approval by Hitler and the Nazis of his music did not hurt Bruckner's standing in the postwar media, and several movies and TV productions in Europe and the United States have used excerpts from his music ever since the 1950s, as they already did in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abruckner.com/downloads/brucknerinthemovie |title=Bruckner in the Movies, TV and Radio |publisher=Abruckner.com |access-date=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nor did the [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]] ever ban Bruckner's music as they have Wagner's, even recording the Eighth Symphony with [[Zubin Mehta]].

Bruckner's symphonic works, much maligned in Vienna in his lifetime, now have an important place in the tradition and musical repertoire of the [[Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra]].

===In popular culture===
The life of Bruckner was portrayed in [[Jan Schmidt-Garre]]'s 1995 film ''Bruckner's Decision'', which focuses on his recovery in an Austrian spa. [[Ken Russell]]'s TV movie ''The Strange Affliction of Anton Bruckner'', starring [[Peter Mackriel]], also fictionalizes Bruckner's real-life stay at a sanatorium because of [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (or 'numeromania' as it was then described).&lt;ref&gt;Charles P. Mitchell, ''The Great Composers Portrayed on Film: 1913 through 2002''. Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers (2004): 49 – 50&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, &quot;[[Luchino Visconti|Visconti]] used the music of Bruckner for his ''[[Senso (film)|Senso]]'' (1954), its plot concerned with the Austrian invasion of Italy in the 1860s.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;p. 437 (2008) Cooke&lt;/ref&gt; The score by [[Carl Davis]] for the restoration of the 1925 film ''[[Ben-Hur (1925 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' takes &quot;inspiration from Bruckner to achieve reverence in biblical scenes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;p. 39, Cooke (2008) Mervyn.

'''Henry Hudson''' ({{circa|1565}}&amp;nbsp;– disappeared 23 June 1611) was an English [[List of maritime explorers|sea explorer]] and [[navigator]] during the early 17th century, best known for his explorations of present-day [[Canada]] and parts of the [[northeastern United States]].

In 1607 and 1608, Hudson made two attempts on behalf of English merchants to find a rumoured [[Northeast Passage]] to [[Cathay]] via a route above the [[Arctic Circle]]. In 1609, he landed in North America on behalf of the [[Dutch East India Company]] and explored the region around the modern [[New York metropolitan area]]. Looking for a [[Northwest Passage]] to Asia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = De Laet|first = J.|date = 1625|title = Nieuvve wereldt, ofte, Beschrijvinghe van West-Indien|url = https://archive.org/details/nieuvvewereldtof00laetrich|language = nl|location = Leyden|publisher = Elzevier|page = [https://archive.org/details/nieuvvewereldtof00laetrich/page/83 83]|oclc = 65327738}}&lt;/ref&gt; on his ship  ''[[Halve Maen]]'' (&quot;Half Moon&quot;), he sailed up the [[Hudson River]], which was later named after him, and thereby laid the foundation for [[New Netherland|Dutch colonization of the region]].

On his final expedition, while still searching for the Northwest Passage, Hudson became the first European to see [[Hudson Strait]] and the immense [[Hudson Bay]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Rink|first = O. A.|date = 1986|title = Holland on the Hudson: an economic and social history of Dutch New York|location = Ithaca|publisher = [[Cornell University Press]]|page = 29|isbn = 9780801418662}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1611, after wintering on the shore of [[James Bay]], Hudson wanted to press on to the west, but most of his crew mutinied. The mutineers cast Hudson, his son, and seven others adrift; the Hudsons and their companions were never seen again.

== Exploration ==

=== Expeditions of 1607 and 1608 ===
In 1607, the [[Muscovy Company]] of England hired Hudson to find a northerly route to the Pacific coast of Asia. At the time, the English were engaged in an economic battle with the Dutch for control of northwest routes. It was thought that, because the [[Midnight sun|sun shone for three months]] in the northern latitudes in the summer, the ice would melt and a ship could make it across the &quot;top of the world&quot;.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

On 1 May 1607, Hudson sailed with a crew of ten men and a boy on the 80-ton ''Hopewell''.{{sfn|Asher|1860|pp=1–22}}{{sfn|Conway|1906|pp=23–30}} They reached the east coast of [[Greenland]] on 14&amp;nbsp;June, coasting it northward until the 22 June. Here the party named a headland &quot;Young's Cape&quot;, a &quot;very high mount, like a round castle&quot; near it &quot;Mount of God's Mercy&quot; and land at 73°&amp;nbsp;north latitude &quot;[[Hold with Hope]]&quot;. After turning east, they sighted &quot;Newland&quot;—i.e [[Spitsbergen]]—on the 27 May{{when|date=November 2020}}, near the mouth of the great bay Hudson later simply named the &quot;Great Indraught&quot; ([[Isfjorden (Svalbard)|Isfjorden]]).

On 13 July, Hudson and his crew estimated that they had sailed as far north as 80°&amp;nbsp;23'&amp;nbsp;N,{{efn|Observations made during this voyage were often wrong, sometimes greatly so. See Conway 1906.}} but more likely only reached 79°&amp;nbsp;23'&amp;nbsp;N. The following day they entered what Hudson later in the voyage named &quot;Whales Bay&quot; ([[Krossfjorden]] and [[Kongsfjorden]]), naming its northwestern point &quot;Collins Cape&quot; (Kapp Mitra) after his [[boatswain]], William Collins. They sailed north the following two days. On the 16 July, they reached as far north as Hakluyt's Headland (which [[Thomas Edge]] claims Hudson named on this voyage) at 79°&amp;nbsp;49'&amp;nbsp;N, thinking they saw the land continue to 82°&amp;nbsp;N ([[Svalbard]]'s northernmost point is 80°&amp;nbsp;49'&amp;nbsp;N) when really it trended to the east. Encountering ice packed along the north coast, they were forced to turn back south. Hudson wanted to make his return &quot;by the north of Greenland to Davis his Streights ([[Davis Strait]]), and so for Kingdom of England,&quot; but ice conditions would have made this impossible. The expedition returned to [[Tilbury|Tilbury Hope]] on the [[River Thames]] on 15&amp;nbsp;September.

Hudson reported large numbers of whales in Spitsbergen waters during this voyage. Many authors{{efn|Sandler 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;407.; Umbreit 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;1.; {{harvnb|Shorto|2004|p=21}}; Mulvaney 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;38.; Davis et al. 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;31.; Francis 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;30.; Rudmose-Brown 1920, p.&amp;nbsp;312.; Chisholm 1911, p.&amp;nbsp;942.}} credit his reports as the catalyst for several nations sending [[whaling]] expeditions to the islands. This claim is contentious- others have pointed to strong evidence that it was [[Jonas Poole]]'s reports in 1610, that led to the establishment of English whaling, and voyages of [[Nicholas Woodcock]] and [[Willem Cornelisz van Muyden]] in 1612, which led to the establishment of Dutch, French and Spanish whaling.&lt;ref&gt;Purchas 1625, p.&amp;nbsp;24.; Conway 1906, p.&amp;nbsp;53.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[History of whaling|whaling industry]] itself was built by neither Hudson nor Poole&amp;nbsp;– both were dead by 1612.

In 1608, English merchants of the [[East India Company|East India]] and Muscovy Companies again sent Hudson in the ''Hopewell'' to attempt to locate a passage to the Indies, this time to the east around northern Russia. Leaving London on 22&amp;nbsp;April, the ship travelled almost {{convert|2500|mi|abbr=on}}, making it to [[Novaya Zemlya]] well above the [[Arctic Circle]] in July, but even in the summer they found the ice impenetrable and turned back, arriving at [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]] on 26&amp;nbsp;August.{{sfn|Hunter|2009|pp=19–20}}

==== Alleged discovery of Jan Mayen ====
According to [[Thomas Edge]], &quot;William {{sic}} Hudson&quot; in 1608 discovered an island he named &quot;Hudson's Tutches&quot; (Touches) at 71°&amp;nbsp;N,&lt;ref&gt;Purchas 1625, p.&amp;nbsp;11.&lt;/ref&gt; the latitude of [[Jan Mayen]]. However, records of Hudson's voyages suggest that he could only have come across Jan Mayen in 1607 by making an illogical detour, and historians have pointed out that Hudson himself made no mention of it in his journal.{{efn|&quot;The above relation by Thomas Edge is obviously incorrect. Hudson's Christian name is wrongly given, and the year in which he visited the north coast of Spitsbergen was 1607, not 1608. Moreover, Hudson himself has given an account of the voyage and makes absolutely no mention of Hudson's Tutches. It would have been hardly possible indeed for him to visit Jan Mayen on his way home from Bear Island to the Thames.&quot; Wordie 1922, p.&amp;nbsp;182.}} There is also no cartographical proof of this supposed discovery.{{sfn|Hacquebord|2004|p=229}}

[[Jonas Poole]] in 1611 and [[Robert Fotherby]] in 1615 both had possession of Hudson's journal while searching for his elusive Hold-with-Hope—which is now believed to have been on the east coast of Greenland—but neither had any knowledge of any discovery of Jan Mayen, an achievement which was only later attributed to Hudson. Fotherby eventually stumbled across Jan Mayen, thinking it a new discovery and naming it &quot;Sir Thomas Smith's Island&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Purchas 1625, pp.&amp;nbsp;82–89.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hacquebord|2004|pp=230–231}} though the first verifiable records of the discovery of the island had been made a year earlier, in 1614.

=== Expedition of 1609 ===
[[File:Henry Hudson Map 26.png|thumb|Hudson's voyages to North America]]
In 1609, Hudson was chosen by merchants of the [[Dutch East India Company]] in the Netherlands to find an easterly passage to Asia. While awaiting orders and supplies in Amsterdam, he heard rumours of a northwest route to the Pacific through North America.&lt;ref name=empire&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/empireofthebay/profiles/hudson.html|title=Empire of the Bay: Henry Hudson|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hudson had been told to sail through the [[Arctic Ocean]] north of Russia, into the Pacific and so to the [[Far East]]. Hudson departed [[Amsterdam]] on 4&amp;nbsp;April, in command of the Dutch ship {{ship||Halve Maen||2}}.{{sfn|Hunter|2009|p=11}} He could not complete the specified (eastward) route because ice blocked the passage, as with all previous such voyages, and he turned the ship around in mid-May while somewhere east of Norway's [[North Cape (Norway)|North Cape]]. At that point, acting outside his instructions, Hudson pointed the ship west and decided to try to seek a westerly passage through North America.{{sfn|Hunter|2009|pp=56–57}}

They reached the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]] on 2&amp;nbsp;July, and in mid-July made landfall near the [[LaHave, Nova Scotia|LaHave area]] of [[Nova Scotia]].{{sfn|Hunter|2000|pp=92–94}} Here they encountered [[First Nations]] who were accustomed to trading with the French; they were willing to trade [[Beaver#Trapping|beaver pelts]], but apparently no trades occurred.{{sfn|Hunter|2009|p=98}}&lt;ref&gt;Juet 1609, entry of 19&amp;nbsp;July.&lt;/ref&gt; The ship stayed in the area about ten days, the crew replacing a broken mast and fishing for food. On the 25 July, a dozen men from the ''Halve Maen'', using muskets and small cannon, went ashore and assaulted the village near their anchorage. They drove the people from the settlement and took their boat and other property&amp;nbsp;– probably pelts and trade goods.{{sfn|Hunter|2009|pp=102–105}}&lt;ref&gt;Juet 1609, entry of 25&amp;nbsp;July.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Halve Maen front.jpg|thumb|Replica of the {{ship||Halve Maen||2}}]]
On 4 August, the ship was at [[Cape Cod]], from which Hudson sailed south to the entrance of the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. Rather than entering the Chesapeake he explored the coast to the north, finding [[Delaware Bay]] but continuing on north. On 3&amp;nbsp;September, he reached the estuary of the river that initially was called the &quot;North River&quot; or &quot;Mauritius&quot; and now carries his name. He was not the first European to discover the estuary, though, as it had been known since the voyage of [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] in 1524.

On 6 September 1609, [[John Colman]] of his crew was killed by [[Native Americans in the United States|natives]] with an arrow to his neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sam |last=Roberts |title=New York's Coldest Case: A Murder 400 Years Old |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=4 September 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/05/nyregion/05murder.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hudson sailed into the [[Upper New York Bay]] on 11&amp;nbsp;September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.insidetheapple.net/2008/09/new-yorks-many-911-anniversaries-staten.html Nevius, Michelle and James, &quot;New York's many 9/11 anniversaries: the Staten Island Peace Conference&quot;], ''Inside the Apple: A Streetwise History of New York City'', 8 September 2008. Retrieved 2009-05-31.&lt;/ref&gt; and the following day began a journey up what is now known as the Hudson River.&lt;ref&gt;Juet 1609.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next ten days his ship ascended the river, reaching a point about where the present-day capital of [[Albany, New York|Albany]] is located.{{sfn|Hunter|2009|pp=230–235}}

On 23 September, Hudson decided to return to Europe.{{sfn|Hunter|2009|p=235}} He put in at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]], England on 7&amp;nbsp;November, and was detained by authorities who wanted access to his log. He managed to pass the log to the Dutch ambassador to England, who sent it, along with his report, to Amsterdam.{{sfn|Shorto|2004|p=31}}

While exploring the river, Hudson had traded with several native groups, mainly obtaining furs. His voyage was used to establish Dutch claims to the region and to the [[fur trade]] that prospered there when a trading post was established at Albany in 1614. [[New Amsterdam]] on [[Manhattan#Manhattan Island|Manhattan Island]] became the capital of [[New Netherland]] in 1625.

=== Expedition of 1610–1611 ===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}
In 1610, Hudson obtained backing for another voyage, this time under the English flag. The funding came from the [[Virginia Company]] and the British [[East India Company]]. At the helm of his new ship, the {{ship||Discovery|1602 ship|2}}, he stayed to the north&amp;nbsp;— some claim he deliberately stayed too far south on his Dutch-funded voyage&amp;nbsp;— reached [[Iceland]] on 11&amp;nbsp;May, the south of Greenland on 4&amp;nbsp;June, and rounded the southern tip of Greenland.

On 25 June, the explorers reached what is now the [[Hudson Strait]] at the northern tip of [[Labrador]]. Following the southern coast of the strait on 2&amp;nbsp;August, the ship entered [[Hudson Bay]]. Excitement was very high due to the expectation that the ship had finally found the [[Northwest Passage]] through the continent. Hudson spent the following months mapping and exploring its eastern shores, but he and his crew did not find a passage to Asia. In November, however, the ship became trapped in the ice in [[James Bay]], and the crew moved ashore for the winter.

; Priority: Customers with high priority are served first.&lt;ref name=&quot;penttinen&quot;/&gt; Priority queues can be of two types, non-preemptive (where a job in service cannot be interrupted) and preemptive (where a job in service can be interrupted by a higher-priority job).

; Service facility
* Single server: customers line up and there is only one server
* Several parallel servers–Single queue: customers line up and there are several servers
* Several servers–Several queues: there are many counters and customers can decide going where to queue

; Unreliable server

Server failures occur according to a stochastic process (usually Poisson) and are followed by the setup periods during which the server is unavailable. The interrupted customer remains in the service area until server is fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dimitriou | first1 = I. | title = A Multiclass Retrial System With Coupled Orbits And Service Interruptions: Verification of Stability Conditions | journal = Proceedings of FRUCT 24 | volume = 7 | pages = 75–82 | year = 2019| pmid =  | pmc = | doi-access = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

; Customer's behavior of waiting
* Balking: customers deciding not to join the queue if it is too long
* Jockeying: customers switch between queues if they think they will get served faster by doing so
* Reneging: customers leave the queue if they have waited too long for service

Arriving customers not served (either due to the queue having no buffer, or due to balking or reneging by the customer) are also known as dropouts and the average rate of dropouts is a significant parameter describing a queue.

== Queueing networks ==

Networks of queues are systems in which a number of queues are connected by what's known as customer routing. When a customer is serviced at one node it can join another node and queue for service, or leave the network.

For networks of ''m'' nodes, the state of the system can be described by an ''m''–dimensional vector (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;) where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; represents the number of customers at each node.

The simplest non-trivial network of queues is called [[Jackson network|tandem queues]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~winkel/bs3a07l13-14.pdf#page=4&lt;/ref&gt; The first significant results in this area were [[Jackson network]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = J.

The [[normalizing constant]] can be calculated with the [[Buzen's algorithm]], proposed in 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;buzen-1973&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Buzen | first1 = J. P. | authorlink = Jeffrey P.

Networks of customers have also been investigated, [[Kelly network]]s where customers of different classes experience different priority levels at different service nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kelly | first1 = F. P. | authorlink1 = Frank Kelly (mathematician)| title = Networks of Queues with Customers of Different Types | journal = Journal of Applied Probability | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 542–554 | doi = 10.2307/3212869 | jstor = 3212869| year = 1975 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another type of network are [[G-networks]] first proposed by [[Erol Gelenbe]] in 1993:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3214781 | title = G-Networks with Triggered Customer Movement | first = Erol | last = Gelenbe | authorlink = Erol Gelenbe | journal = Journal of Applied Probability | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | date = Sep 1993 | pages = 742–748 | jstor = 3214781 }}&lt;/ref&gt; these networks do not assume exponential time distributions like the classic Jackson Network.

=== Routing algorithms ===

In discrete time networks where there is a constraint on which service nodes can be active at any time, the max-weight scheduling algorithm chooses a service policy to give optimal throughput in the case that each job visits only a single person &lt;ref name=&quot;Manuel&quot; /&gt; service node. In the more general case where jobs can visit more than one node, [[backpressure routing]] gives optimal throughput. A [[network scheduler]] must choose a [[queuing algorithm]], which affects the characteristics of the larger network{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}. See also [[Stochastic scheduling]] for more about scheduling of queueing systems.

=== Mean field limits ===

[[Mean field model]]s consider the limiting behaviour of the [[empirical measure]] (proportion of queues in different states) as the number of queues (''m'' above) goes to infinity. The impact of other queues on any given queue in the network is approximated by a differential equation. The deterministic model converges to the same stationary distribution as the original model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Bobbio | first1 = A. | last2 = Gribaudo | first2 = M. | last3 = Telek | first3 = M. S. | doi = 10.1109/QEST.2008.47 | chapter = Analysis of Large Scale Interacting Systems by Mean Field Method | title = 2008 Fifth International Conference on Quantitative Evaluation of Systems | pages = 215 | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7695-3360-5 | pmid =  | pmc = | s2cid = 2714909 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heavy traffic/diffusion approximations ===
{{Main|Heavy traffic approximation}}
In a system with high occupancy rates (utilisation near 1) a heavy traffic approximation can be used to approximate the queueing length process by a [[reflected Brownian motion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = H. | last2 = Whitt | first2 = W. | doi = 10.1007/BF01149260 | title = Diffusion approximations for open queueing networks with service interruptions | journal = [[Queueing Systems]]| volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 335 | year = 1993 | pmid =  | pmc = | s2cid = 1180930 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process]], or more general [[diffusion process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Yamada | first1 = K. | title = Diffusion Approximation for Open State-Dependent Queueing Networks in the Heavy Traffic Situation | doi = 10.1214/aoap/1177004602 | journal = The Annals of Applied Probability | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 958–982 | year = 1995 | jstor = 2245101| pmid =  | pmc = | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of dimensions of the Brownian process is equal to the number of queueing nodes, with the diffusion restricted to the non-negative [[orthant]].

=== Fluid limits ===
{{main|Fluid limit}}
Fluid models are continuous deterministic analogs of queueing networks obtained by taking the limit when the process is scaled in time and space, allowing heterogeneous objects. This scaled trajectory converges to a deterministic equation which allows the stability of the system to be proven. It is known that a queueing network can be stable, but have an unstable fluid limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bramson | first1 = M. | title = A stable queueing network with unstable fluid model | doi = 10.1214/aoap/1029962815 | journal = The Annals of Applied Probability | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 818–853 | year = 1999 | jstor = 2667284| pmid =  | pmc = | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The blue line is the polynomial &lt;math display=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;y(x) = 7x^3 - 8x^2 - 3x + 3&lt;/math&gt;, whose integral in {{math|[−1, 1]}} is {{math|{{frac|2|3}}}}.

In [[numerical analysis]], a '''quadrature rule''' is an approximation of the [[integral|definite integral]] of a [[function (mathematics)|function]], usually stated as a [[weighted sum]] of function values at specified points within the domain of integration. (See [[numerical integration]] for more on [[quadrature (mathematics)|quadrature]] rules.) An ''n''-point '''Gaussian quadrature rule''', named after [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]],&lt;ref&gt;''Methodus nova integralium valores per approximationem inveniendi.'' In: ''Comm. Soc. Sci. Göttingen Math.'' Band 3, 1815, S. 29–76, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2412190.r=Gauss.langEN Gallica], datiert 1814, auch in Werke, Band 3, 1876, S. 163–196.&lt;/ref&gt; is a quadrature rule constructed to yield an exact result for [[polynomial]]s of degree {{math|2''n'' − 1}} or less by a suitable choice of the nodes {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} and weights {{mvar|w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} for {{math|''i'' {{=}} 1, ..., ''n''}}. The modern formulation using orthogonal polynomials was developed by [[Carl Gustav Jacobi]] 1826.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi|C. G. J. Jacobi]]: ''Ueber Gauß' neue Methode, die Werthe der Integrale näherungsweise zu finden.'' In: ''Journal für Reine und Angewandte Mathematik.'' Band 1, 1826, S. 301–308, [http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?PPN=PPN243919689_0001&amp;DMDID=DMDLOG_0035 (online)], und Werke, Band 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common domain of integration for such a rule is taken as {{math|[−1, 1]}}, so the rule is stated as

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-1}^1 f(x)\,dx \approx \sum_{i=1}^n w_i f(x_i),&lt;/math&gt;

which is exact for polynomials of degree {{math|2''n'' − 1}} or less. This exact rule is known as the Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule. The quadrature rule will only be an accurate approximation to the integral above if {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is well-approximated by a polynomial of degree {{math|2''n'' − 1}} or less on {{math|[−1, 1]}}.

The Gauss-[[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]] quadrature rule is not typically used for integrable functions with endpoint [[singularity (math)|singularities]]. Instead, if the integrand can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \left(1 - x\right)^\alpha \left(1 + x\right)^\beta g(x),\quad \alpha,\beta &gt; -1,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''g''(''x'')}} is well-approximated by a low-degree polynomial, then alternative nodes &lt;math&gt;x_i'&lt;/math&gt; and weights &lt;math&gt;w_i'&lt;/math&gt; will usually give more accurate quadrature rules. These are known as [[Gauss-Jacobi quadrature]] rules, i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-1}^1 f(x)\,dx = \int_{-1}^1 \left(1 - x\right)^\alpha \left(1 + x\right)^\beta g(x)\,dx \approx \sum_{i=1}^n w_i' g\left(x_i'\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Common weights include &lt;math display=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}&lt;/math&gt; ([[Chebyshev–Gauss quadrature|Chebyshev–Gauss]]) and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1 - x^2}&lt;/math&gt;. One may also want to integrate over semi-infinite ([[Gauss-Laguerre quadrature]]) and infinite intervals ([[Gauss–Hermite quadrature]]).

It can be shown (see Press, et al., or Stoer and Bulirsch) that the quadrature nodes {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the [[Root of a function|roots]] of a polynomial belonging to a class of [[orthogonal polynomials]] (the class orthogonal with respect to a weighted inner-product). This is a key observation for computing Gauss quadrature nodes and weights.

== Gauss–Legendre quadrature == &lt;!-- The section &quot;Other forms of Gaussian quadrature&quot; below links to this section --&gt;
[[File:Legendrepolynomials6.svg|thumb|Graphs of Legendre polynomials (up to {{math|''n'' {{=}} 5)}}]]

For the simplest integration problem stated above, i.e., {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is well-approximated by polynomials on &lt;math&gt;[-1, 1]&lt;/math&gt;, the associated orthogonal polynomials are [[Legendre polynomials]], denoted by {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}}. With the {{mvar|n}}-th polynomial normalized to give {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(1) {{=}} 1}}, the {{mvar|i}}-th Gauss node, {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}, is the {{mvar|i}}-th root of {{mvar|P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the weights are given by the formula {{Harv|Abramowitz|Stegun|1972|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;887}}

:&lt;math&gt; w_i = \frac{2}{\left( 1 - x_i^2 \right) \left[P'_n(x_i)\right]^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Some low-order quadrature rules are tabulated below (over interval {{math|[−1, 1]}}, see the section below for other intervals).

== Change of interval ==
An integral over {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} must be changed into an integral over {{math|[−1, 1]}} before applying the Gaussian quadrature rule. This change of interval can be done in the following way:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = \frac{b-a}{2} \int_{-1}^1 f\left(\frac{b-a}{2}\xi + \frac{a+b}{2}\right)\,d\xi.&lt;/math&gt;

Applying &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; point Gaussian quadrature &lt;math&gt;(\xi, w)&lt;/math&gt; rule then results in the following approximation:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\,dx \approx \frac{b-a}{2} \sum_{i=1}^n w_i f\left(\frac{b-a}{2}\xi_i + \frac{a+b}{2}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

== Other forms ==
The integration problem can be expressed in a slightly more general way by introducing a positive [[weight function]] {{mvar|ω}} into the integrand, and allowing an interval other than {{math|[−1, 1]}}. That is, the problem is to calculate

:&lt;math&gt; \int_a^b \omega(x)\,f(x)\,dx &lt;/math&gt;

for some choices of {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|ω}}. For {{math|''a'' {{=}} −1}}, {{math|''b'' {{=}} 1}}, and {{math|ω(''x'') {{=}} 1}}, the problem is the same as that considered above. Other choices lead to other integration rules. Some of these are tabulated below. Equation numbers are given for [[Abramowitz and Stegun]] (A &amp; S).

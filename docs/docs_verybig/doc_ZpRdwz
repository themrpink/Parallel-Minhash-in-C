The report of the &quot;Swedish Government's Commission on New Religious Movements&quot; (1998) states that the great majority of members of new religious movements derive positive experiences from their subscription to ideas or [[doctrine]]s that correspond to their personal needs—and that withdrawal from these movements is usually quite undramatic, as these people leave feeling enriched by a predominantly positive experience. Although the report describes that there are a small number of withdrawals that require support (100 out of 50,000+ people), the report did not recommend that any special resources be established for their rehabilitation, as these cases are very rare.&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Swedish Government's Commission on New Religious Movements (1998)'', 1.6 The need for support  [http://www.regeringen.se/info_rosenbad/departement/social/sou98_113/s98_113.pdf (Swedish)]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [http://www.cesnur.org/testi/swedish.htm English translation] &lt;br /&gt;The great majority of members of the new religious movements derive positive experience from their membership. They have subscribed to an idea or doctrine that corresponds to their personal needs. Membership is of limited duration in most cases. After two years, the majority have left the movement. This withdrawal is usually quite undramatic, and the people withdrawing feel enriched by a predominantly positive experience. The Commission does not recommend that special resources be established for the rehabilitation of withdraws. The cases are too few in number and the problem picture too manifold for this: each individual can be expected to need help from several different care providers or facilitators.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Emotion}}

'''Lust''' is a psychological force producing intense [[desire]] for an object, or circumstance fulfilling the [[emotion]] while already having a significant other or amount of the desired object.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lazarus with Bernice N. Lazarus, ''Passion and Reason: Making Sense of Our Emotions''. New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 1994. {{ISBN|978-0-19-510461-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lust can take any form such as the lust for sexuality (see [[libido]]), love, money, or power. It can take such mundane forms as the lust for food (see [[gluttony]]) as distinct from the need for food.

==In religion==
{{See also|Religious views on pornography|Religious views on masturbation|Fornication}}

Religions tend to draw a distinction between passion and lust by further categorizing lust as an immoral desire and passion as morally accepted.

Lust is defined as immoral because its object or action of affection is improperly ordered according to [[natural law]] and/or the appetite for the particular object (eg sexual desire) is governing the person's intellect and will rather than the intellect and will governing the appetite for that object.

Whereas passion, regardless of its strength is maintained to be something God-given and moral, because the purpose, actions and intentions behind it are benevolent and ordered toward creation, while also being governed by the person's intellect and will. A primary school of thought on this is [[Thomism]], which speaks on the intellect, will and appetite, and draws from principles defined by [[Aristotle]]. However, the exact definitions assigned to what is morally definite and ordered toward creation depend on the [[religion]]. For example, differences between religions based in [[pantheism]] and [[theism]] will differ what is moral according to the nature of the &quot;God&quot; acknowledged or worshipped.

===Abrahamic religions===
====Judaism====
{{main|Yetzer hara#The evil inclination in Jewish tradition}}
In [[Judaism]], all evil inclinations and lusts of the flesh are characterized by ''[[Yetzer hara]]'' (Hebrew, יצר הרע, the evil inclination). Yetzer hara is not a demonic force; rather, it is man's misuse of the things which the physical body needs to survive, and is often contrasted with ''yetzer hatov'' (Hebrew, יצר הטוב, the positive desire).

''Yetzer HaRa'' is often identified with [[Satan]] and the angel of death,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bava Bathra|pages=16a}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is sometimes a tendency to give a personality and separate activity to the ''yetzer''. For the ''yetzer'', like Satan, misleads man in this world, and testifies against him in the world to come. The ''yetzer'' is, however, clearly distinguished from Satan, and on other occasions is made exactly parallel to sin. The [[Torah]] is considered the great antidote against this force. Though, like all things which God has made, the ''yetzer hara'' (evil inclination) can be manipulated into doing good: for without it, man would never marry, beget a child, build a house, or occupy himself in a trade.

====Christianity====
=====New Testament=====
In many translations of the [[New Testament]], the word &quot;lust&quot; translates the Greek word ἐπιθυμέω, particularly in [[Matthew 5:27-28]]:
{{&quot;|Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust (ἐπιθυμέω) after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.}}

In English-speaking countries, the term &quot;lust&quot; is often associated with [[sexual desire]], probably because of this verse. However, just as the English word was originally a general term for 'desire', the Greek word ἐπιθυμέω was also a general term for desire. The [[LSJ]] lexicon suggests &quot;set one's heart upon a thing, long for, covet, desire&quot; as glosses for ἐπιθυμέω, which is used in verses that clearly have nothing to do with sexual desire. In the [[Septuagint]], ''ἐπιθυμέω'' is the word used in the commandment to not covet:

{{&quot;|You shall not covet your neighbour's wife; you shall not covet your neighbour's house or his field or his male slave or his female slave or his ox or his draft animal or any animal of his or whatever belongs to your neighbour.|Exodus 20:17, New English Translation of the Septuagint}}

While coveting your neighbour's wife may involve sexual desire, it's unlikely that coveting a neighbour's house or field is sexual in nature. And in most New Testament uses, the same Greek word, ''ἐπιθυμέω'', does not have a clear sexual connotation. For example, from the [[American Standard Version]] the same word is used outside of any sexual connotation:

# [[Wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#13:17|Matthew 13:17]]: For verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous men ''desired'' to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not.
# [[Wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#22:15|Luke 22:15-16]]: And he said unto them, With ''desire'' I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer: for I say unto you, I shall not eat it, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
# [[Wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#20:33|Acts 20:33]]: I ''coveted'' no man's silver, or gold, or apparel. Ye yourselves know that these hands ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.
# [[Wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#15:14|Luke 15:14-16]]: And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want. And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he ''would fain'' have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.

=====Catholicism=====
[[File:Daemon.jpg|left|thumb|A demon [[masturbation|satiating his lust]] in a 13th-century manuscript]]
[[File:La Luxure dans l'art roman.JPG|thumb|[[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] representing lust]]

According to the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', a Christian's heart is lustful when &quot;venereal satisfaction is sought for either outside wedlock or, at any rate, in a manner which is contrary to the laws that govern marital intercourse&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Lust}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope John Paul II]] said that lust devalues the eternal attraction of male and female, reducing personal riches of the opposite sex to an object for gratification of sexuality.&lt;ref name=&quot;PopeJohn&quot;&gt;Pope John Paul II, ''Mutual Attraction Differs from Lust''. ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'', weekly edition in English, 22 September 1980, p. 11. Available at http://www.ewtn.com/library/papaldoc/jp2tb39.htm .&lt;/ref&gt;

Lust is considered by [[Catholicism]] to be a disordered desire for [[sexual pleasure]], where sexual pleasure is &quot;sought for itself, isolated from its procreative and unitive purposes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;'Catechism of the Catholic Church, n° 2351 sq.&lt;/ref&gt; In Catholicism, sexual desire in itself is good, and is considered part of God's plan for humanity. However, when sexual desire is separated from God's love, it becomes disordered and self-seeking. This is seen as lust.

St [[Thomas Aquinas]] differentiates between sexual intercourse within marriage, which is seen as meritorious through giving justice to one's spouse, and sins of lust which can themselves be differentiated in magnitude of immorality according to intention and action. For example, Aquinas and other medieval theologians would consider rape a greater sin than masturbation, because rape is a sin against justice, while masturbation is a sin against chastity; and justice is a supernatural property of God, making it a greater virtue than chastity, a property of man's human nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aquinas on Sexual Sin - The dangers of speaking formally |url=https://www.pathsoflove.com/blog/2009/06/aquinas-on-sexual-sins-dangers-of-speaking-formally/ |accessdate=19 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin for ''extravagance'' (Latin: ''luxuria'') was used by St [[Jerome]] to translate a variety of biblical sins, including drunkenness and sexual excess.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Jordan, ''The Invention of Sodomy'' (1994) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gregory the Great]] placed ''luxuria'' as one of the seven capital sins (it is often considered the least serious of the seven deadly sins), narrowing its scope to disordered desire,&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Jordan, ''The Invention of Sodomy'' (1994) pp. 39–40; [https://www.academia.edu/8268216/_Luxure_cléricale_gouvernement_de_l_Église_et_royauté_capétienne_au_temps_de_la_Bible_de_saint_Louis_Revue_Mabillon_25_2014_p._165-194 Julien Théry, &quot;Luxure cléricale, gouvernement de l’Église et royauté capétienne au temps de la 'Bible de saint Louis'&quot;, ''Revue Mabillon'', 25, 2014, pp. 165–194]&lt;/ref&gt; and it was in this sense that the Middle Ages generally took ''luxuria'', (although the [[Old French]] [[cognate]] was [[loan word|adopted]] into English as ''luxury'' without its sexual meaning by the 14th century{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}).
[[File:Sankt_Bartholomäus_(Reichenthal)_04.jpg|left|thumb|156x156px|Detail of ''Lust'' at the [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Sankt Bartholomäus]] church ([[Reichenthal]]), [[Pulpit]] (1894)]]
In [[Romanesque art]], the [[Anthropomorphism|personified]] Luxuria is generally feminine,&lt;ref&gt;J. Jerman/A. Weir, ''Images of Lust'' (2013) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; often represented by a [[siren (mythology)|siren]] or a naked woman with breasts being bitten by snakes. [[Prudentius]] in his ''[[Psychomachia]]'' or 'Battle of the Soul' had described&lt;ref&gt;Helen Waddell, ''The Wandering Scholars'' (1968) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; Luxury, lavish of her ruined fame, Loose-haired, wild-eyed, her voice a dying fall, Lost in delight....&lt;/blockquote&gt; For [[Dante]], Luxuria was both the first of the circles of incontinence (or self-indulgence) on the descent into hell, and the last of the cornices of Mount Purgatory, representing the excessive (disordered) love of individuals;&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''Hell'' (1975) p. 101; Dante, ''Purgatory'' (1971) p. 67 and p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; while for [[Edmund Spenser]], ''luxuria'' was synonymous with the power of desire.&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Berry, ''The Idea of Luxury'' (1994) pp. 97–8&lt;/ref&gt;

For Gregory and subsequent Thomists, the 'daughters' (by-products) of Luxuria included mental blindness, self-love, haste, and excessive attachment to the present.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Jordan, ''The Invention of Sodomy'' (1994) pp. 37–9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marianne Dashwood]] has been seen as embodying such characteristics for a later age – as a daughter of Luxuria.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Liddell, ''The Novels of Jane Austen'' (London 1963) p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Protestantism=====
The evangelical Melvin Tinker states that: &quot;The principle is clear isn't it, 'You shall not commit adultery'? How does the Pharisee handle it according to the minimum requirement method? He says, 'Sex outside marriage is OK for us because neither of us are really married. I am not sleeping with another man's wife, so it isn't adultery, she's my girlfriend'. Or it is also not adultery because 'I have not had sex with that woman.' to quote [[President Clinton]]'s plea in the [[Clinton–Lewinsky scandal|Monica Lewinski [''sic''] saga]]. So he can abuse his position as President by messing around with a girl who is hardly younger than his daughter, he can engage in all kinds of sexual activities with her, but because he technically doesn't have intercourse he can hold up his hands and say, 'I have not had sex with that woman.' That is a Pharisee speaking.

&quot;But the maximum application method says, adultery doesn't just happen when you have sexual intercourse, it happens in your heart. However, the mistranslation is unfortunate at this point. In the Greek it says, 'If anyone looks upon a woman in order to lust, has already committed adultery with her in his heart.' That is an important distinction. I need to point that out because sexual arousal, sexual interest, sexual attraction are essential for the continuation of the human species... It is about looking in order to lust. The striptease show, the dirty movie or video, the internet pornography. That is becoming a real problem... And if this is a difficulty for you, then do talk to someone about it in confidence. You see, it is the intending to look in order to have that arousal that Jesus has in his sights.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stjohnnewland.org.uk/sermtext.asp?id=273]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islam====
In [[Islam]], lust is considered as one of the primitive states of the self, called the [[nafs]]. Muslims are encouraged to overcome their baser instincts and intentional lascivious glances are [[haram|forbidden]]. Lascivious thoughts are [[makruh|disliked]], for they are the first step towards adultery, rape and other antisocial behaviors. [[Prophet]] [[Muhammad]] also stressed the magnitude of the &quot;second glance&quot;, as while the first glance towards an attractive member of the opposite sex could be just accidental or observatory, the second glance could be that gate into lustful thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jami' at-Tirmidhi]],2701 &quot;The Messenger of Allaah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: &quot;O Ali, do not follow a glance with another, for you will be forgiven for the first, but not for the second.&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian religions===
====Hinduism====
In the [[Bhagavad Gita]], Lord [[Krishna]], an [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]], declared in chapter 16, verse 21 that lust is one of the gates to [[Naraka (Hinduism)|Naraka]] or hell.

{{Quote|[[Arjuna]] said: O descendant of Vrsni, by what is one impelled to [[sin]]ful acts, even unwillingly, as if engaged by force? Then Krishna said: It is lust only, Arjuna, which is born of contact with the material mode of passion and later transformed into [[wrath]], and which is the all-devouring sinful enemy of this world. As fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror is covered by dust, or as the embryo is covered by the womb, the living entity is similarly covered by different degrees of this lust. Thus the wise living entity's pure [[consciousness]] becomes covered by his eternal enemy in the form of lust, which is never satisfied and which burns like fire. The [[senses]], the [[mind]] and the [[intelligence]] are the sitting places of this lust. Through them lust covers the real knowledge of the living entity and bewilders him. Therefore, O Arjuna, best of the Bharatas, in the very beginning curb this great symbol of [[sin]]—(lust) by regulating the senses, and slay this destroyer of [[knowledge]] and [[self-realization]]. The working [[senses]] are superior to dull [[matter]]; [[mind]] is higher than the [[senses]]; [[intelligence]] is still higher than the [[mind]]; and he [the soul] is even higher than the [[intelligence]]. Thus knowing oneself to be [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] to the material senses, mind and intelligence, O mighty-armed Arjuna, one should steady the mind by deliberate [[Spirituality|spiritual]] intelligence and thus—by spiritual strength—conquer this insatiable enemy known as lust. ([[Bhagavad-Gita]], 3.36–43)}}

In this ancient manuscript the idea behind the word 'Lust' is best comprehended as the psychological force called 'Wanting'.

====Buddhism====
{{Main|Taṇhā}}
Lust holds a critical position in the philosophical underpinnings of Buddhist reality. It is named in the second of the [[Four Noble Truths]], which are that 
# Suffering ([[dukkha]]) is inherent in all life.
# Suffering is caused by desire.
# There is a natural way to eliminate all suffering from one's life.
# The ending of desire eliminates all suffering from someones life.

Lust is the attachment to, identification with, and passionate desire for certain things in existence, all of which relate to the [[Five skandhas#The five skandhas|form, sensation, perception, mentality, and consciousness]] that certain combinations of these things engender within us. Lust is thus the ultimate cause of general imperfection and the most immediate ''root'' cause of a certain suffering.

The passionate desire for either non-existence or for freedom from lust is a common misunderstanding. For example, the headlong pursuit of lust (or other &quot;[[Seven deadly sins|deadly sin]]&quot;) in order to fulfill a [[death instinct|desire for death]] is followed by a reincarnation accompanied by a self-fulfilling [[karma]], resulting in an endless [[wheel of life]], until the right way to live, the right worldview, is somehow discovered and practiced. Beholding an [[endless knot]] puts one, symbolically, in the position of the one with the right worldview, representing that person who attains freedom from lust.

In existence are four kinds of things that engender the clinging: rituals, worldviews, pleasures, and the self.  The way to eliminate lust is to learn of its unintended effects and to pursue righteousness as concerns a worldview, intention, speech, behavior, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and concentration, in the place where lust formerly sat.

====Sikhism====
In [[Sikhism]], lust is counted among the five cardinal sins or sinful propensities, the others being [[wrath]], ego, [[greed (deadly sin)|greed]] and [[Attachment theory|attachment]]. Uncontrollable expression of sexual lust, as in rape or [[sexual addiction]], is an evil.

=== Indian spirituality ===

====Brahma Kumaris====
According to [[Brahma Kumaris]], a spiritual organization which is based on [[Hindu philosophy]], sexual lust is the greatest enemy to all mankind&lt;ref&gt;''Through open doors: a view of Asian cultures in Kenya''. Cynthia Salvadori, Andrew Fedders, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and the gateway to hell.&lt;ref&gt;''Exploring New Religions''. p. 196, George D. Chryssides, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

For this reason followers do not eat onions, garlic, eggs, or non-vegetarian food, as the &quot;sulphur&quot; in them can excite sexual lust in the body, otherwise bound to celibacy.

The physical act of sex is &quot;impure&quot;, leading to body-consciousness and other crimes. This impurity &quot;poisons&quot; the body and leads to many kinds of &quot;diseases&quot;.

The Brahma Kumaris teaches that sexuality is like foraging about in a dark sewer. Students at Spiritual University must conquer lust in order to find the [[Golden Age]], a heaven on earth, where children are conceived by an asexual power of mind, and lasting for 2,500 years in the peace and purity of a holy swan moving on earth, over water, and in air.&lt;ref&gt;Peace &amp; purity: the story of the Brahma Kumaris : a spiritual revolution By [[Liz Hodgkinson]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A history of celibacy'', p. 172.

The spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] described the differences between lust and love:

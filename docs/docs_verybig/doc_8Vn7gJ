== History ==
[[File:Coptic liturgic inscription.JPG|right|thumb|Fifth–sixth century Coptic liturgic inscription from [[Upper Egypt]].]]
The [[Egyptian language]] may have the longest documented history of any language, from [[Old Egyptian language|Old Egyptian]] that appeared just before 3200 BC&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Allen |first=James P. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lF78Max-h8MC&amp;pg=PA2 |title=Middle Egyptian: An Introduction to the Language and Culture of Hieroglyphs |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-139-48635-4 |edition=2nd |pages=1–2 |author-link=James Peter Allen |access-date=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to its final phases as Coptic in the [[Middle Ages]]. Coptic belongs to the Later Egyptian phase, which started to be written in the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]]. Later Egyptian represented colloquial speech of the later periods. It had analytic features like definite and [[indefinite article]]s and [[periphrasis|periphrastic]] verb conjugation. Coptic, therefore, is a reference to both the most recent stage of Egyptian after [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] and the new writing system that was adapted from the [[Greek alphabet]].

=== Pre-Islamic period ===
The earliest attempts to write the Egyptian language using the Greek alphabet are Greek transcriptions of Egyptian proper names, most of which date to the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]]. Scholars frequently refer to this phase as pre-Coptic. However, it is clear that by the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt]], demotic scribes regularly employed a more phonetic orthography, a testament to the increasing cultural contact between [[Egyptians]] and [[Greeks]] even before [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest of Egypt. Coptic itself, or Old Coptic, takes root in the first century. The transition from the older Egyptian scripts to the newly adapted Coptic alphabet was in part due to the decline of the traditional role played by the priestly class of [[ancient Egyptian religion]], who, unlike most ordinary Egyptians, were literate in the temple scriptoria. Old Coptic is represented mostly by non-Christian texts such as Egyptian pagan prayers and magical and [[astrological papyri]]. Many of them served as [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] to original [[hieratic]] and demotic equivalents. The glosses may have been aimed at non-Egyptian speakers.
[[File:coptic luke.jpg|right|thumb|Eighth century Coptic manuscript of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 5.5–9]] Under late [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman rule]], [[Diocletian]] persecuted many Egyptian converts to the new [[Christianity|Christian faith]], which forced new converts to flee to the Egyptian deserts. In time, the growth of these communities generated the need to write Christian Greek instructions in the Egyptian language. The early Fathers of the [[Coptic Church]], such as [[Anthony the Great]], [[Pachomius the Great]], [[Macarius of Egypt]] and [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], who otherwise usually wrote in Greek, addressed some of their works to the Egyptian monks in Egyptian. The Egyptian language, now written in the Coptic alphabet, flourished in the second and third centuries. However, it was not until [[Shenoute]] that Coptic became a fully standardised literary language based on the Sahidic dialect. Shenouda's native Egyptian tongue and knowledge of Greek and rhetoric gave him the necessary tools to elevate Coptic, in content and style, to a literary height nearly equal to the position of the Egyptian language in ancient Egypt.

=== Islamic period ===
[[File:Page from 19th century Coptic Language Grammar.png|thumb|Page from 19th century Coptic Language Grammar]]

The [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]] by [[Arabs]] came with the [[spread of Islam]] in the seventh century. At the turn of the eighth century, [[Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] decreed{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} that Arabic replace [[Koine Greek]] and Coptic as the sole [[administrative language]]. Literary Coptic gradually declined, and within a few hundred years, Egyptian bishop [[Severus Ibn al-Muqaffaʿ]] found it necessary to write his ''History of the Patriarchs'' in Arabic. However, ecclesiastically the language retained an important position, and many [[hagiography|hagiographic]] texts were also composed during this period. Until the 10th century, Coptic remained the spoken language of the native population outside the capital.

Coptic is thought to have completely given way to [[Egyptian Arabic]] around the 13th century,&lt;ref&gt;[https://journals.openedition.org/ema/1920 The Transition from Coptic to Arabic&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; though it may have survived in isolated pockets for a little longer. In the second half of the 19th century, [[Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria]] started a national Church-sponsored movement to revive Coptic. Several works of grammar were published, including a more comprehensive dictionary than had been formerly available. The scholarly findings of the field of [[Egyptology]] and the inauguration of the [[Institute of Coptic Studies]] further contributed to the renaissance. Efforts at language revitalisation continue to be undertaken, both inside and [[Liberal Egyptian Party|outside the Church]], and have attracted the interest of [[Copts]] and linguists in and outside of Egypt.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} In a 2016 research in Turkey by [[KONDA Research and Consultancy]], 0.01% of respondents claimed their native language to be Coptic (possibly confusing the words &quot;kıptice&quot; (Coptic language) and &quot;kipçak&quot; ([[Kipchak languages|Kipchak]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |url=http://www.konda.com.tr/tr/raporlar/2006_09_KONDA_Toplumsal_Yapi.pdf |title=Toplumsal Yapı Araştırması 2006 [Social Structure Research 2006] |date=September 2006 |publisher=KONDA |page=19 |chapter=Etnik Kimlikler: Anadil [Ethnic Identitites: Mother Tongue] |access-date=2019-07-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215004933/http://www.konda.com.tr/tr/raporlar/2006_09_KONDA_Toplumsal_Yapi.pdf |archive-date=2017-02-15 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing system ==
{{main|Coptic alphabet}}
[[File:Coptic.jpg|thumb|Stone with Coptic inscription]]

Coptic uses a writing system almost wholly derived from the [[Greek alphabet]], with the addition of a number of letters that have their origins in [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic Egyptian]]. This is comparable to the Latin-based [[Icelandic orthography|Icelandic alphabet]], which includes the runic letter [[thorn (letter)|thorn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Coptic Alphabet |url=https://www.suscopts.org/deacons/coptic/coptic_alphabet.pdf |website=www.suscopts.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some variation in the number and forms of these signs depending on the dialect. Some of the letters in the Coptic alphabet that are of Greek origin were normally reserved for words that are themselves Greek. Old Coptic texts employed several graphemes that were not retained in the literary Coptic orthography of later centuries.

In Sahidic, [[syllable]] boundary may have been marked by a supralinear stroke, or the stroke may have tied letters together in one word, since Coptic texts did not otherwise indicate word divisions. Some scribal traditions use a [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] over {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} at the beginning of a syllable or to mark a diphthong. Bohairic uses a superposed point or small stroke known as a ''djinkim''.

== Literature ==
{{Main|Coptic literature}}
The oldest Coptic writings date to the pre-Christian era (Old Coptic), though Coptic literature consists mostly of texts written by prominent saints of the Coptic Church such as Anthony the Great, Pachomius the Great and Shenoute. Shenoute helped fully standardise the Coptic language through his many sermons, treatises and homilies, which formed the basis of early Coptic literature.

== Vocabulary ==
The core [[lexicon]] of Coptic is [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], most closely related to the preceding [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] phase of the language. Up to 40% of the vocabulary of literary Coptic is drawn from [[Greek language|Greek]], but borrowings are not always fully adapted to the Coptic phonological system and may have [[Semantics|semantic]] differences as well. There are instances of Coptic texts having passages that are almost entirely composed from Greek lexical roots. However, that is likely due to the fact that the majority of Coptic religious texts are direct translations of Greek works.

{{quote|What invariably attracts the attention of the reader of a Coptic text, especially if it is written in the Sa'idic dialect, is the very liberal use which is made of Greek loan words, of which so few, indeed, are to be found in the Ancient Egyptian language. There Greek loan words occur everywhere in Coptic literature, be it Biblical, liturgical, theological, or non-literary, i.e. legal documents and personal letters. Though nouns and verbs predominate, the Greek loan words may come from any other part of speech except pronouns'&lt;ref&gt;Girgis, WA (1963–64). Greek loan words in Coptic. ''Bulletin de la Société d’archéologie copte'' 17:63–73.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Words or concepts for which no adequate Egyptian translation existed were taken directly from Greek to avoid altering the meaning of the religious message. In addition, other Egyptian words that would have adequately translated the Greek equivalents were not employed as they were perceived as having overt pagan associations. Old Coptic texts employ many such words, phrases and [[epithet]]s; for example, the word {{Coptic|ⲧⲃⲁⲓⲧⲱⲩ}} '(Who is) in (His) Mountain', is an epithet of [[Anubis]].&lt;ref&gt;Gignac, Francis Thomas, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; There are also traces of some archaic grammatical features, such as residues of the Demotic [[relative clause]], lack of an indefinite article and possessive use of suffixes.

Thus, the transition from the 'old' traditions to the new Christian religion also contributed to the adoption of Greek words into the Coptic religious lexicon. It is safe to assume that the everyday speech of the native population retained, to a greater extent, its indigenous Egyptian character, which is sometimes reflected in Coptic nonreligious documents such as letters and contracts.

== Phonology ==
Coptic provides the clearest indication of Later Egyptian [[phonology]] from its writing system, which fully indicates vowel sounds and occasionally stress pattern. The phonological system of Later Egyptian is also better known than that of the Classical phase of the language because of a greater number of sources indicating Egyptian sounds, including [[Amarna letters|cuneiform letters]] containing transcriptions of Egyptian words and phrases, and Egyptian renderings of [[Northwest Semitic languages|Northwest Semitic]] names. Coptic sounds, in addition, are known from a variety of Coptic-Arabic papyri in which Arabic letters were used to transcribe Coptic and vice versa. They date to the medieval Islamic period, when Coptic was still spoken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Sijpesteijn |first1=Petra |title=Papyrology and the History of Early Islamic Egypt |last2=Lennart Sundelin |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers |year=2004 |isbn=978-90-04-13886-5 |location=Leiden, Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vowels ===
There are some differences of opinion among Coptic language scholars on the correct phonetic interpretation of the writing system of Coptic. Differences centre on how to interpret the pairs of letters ε/η and ο/ω. In the [[Attic Greek|Attic dialect]] of [[Ancient Greek]] in the 5th century BC, the first member of each pair is a short closed vowel {{IPA|/e, o/}}, and the second member is a long open vowel {{IPA|/ɛː, ɔː/}}. In some interpretations of Coptic phonology,{{sfn|Plumley|1948}} it is assumed that the length difference is primary, with ε/η {{IPA|e/eː}} and ο/ω is {{IPA|o/oː}}. Other scholars&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg 1962/1990&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lambdin|1983|pp=xii-ix}} argue for a different analysis in which ε/η and ο/ω are interpreted as {{IPA|e/ɛ}} and {{IPA|o/ɔ}}.

These two charts show the two theories of Coptic vowel phonology:

Dialects vary in their realisation. The difference between [o] and [u] seems to be allophonic. Evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that these are distinct vowels, and if they are, the difference has a very low [[functional load]]. For dialects that use orthographic &lt;ει&gt; for a single vowel, there appears to be no phonetic difference from &lt;ι&gt;.

Double orthographic vowels are presumed here to be long, as that makes the morphology more straightforward. (Another common interpretation is that these represented glottal stop.)

Akhmimic is conservative, close to what is reconstructed for Old Coptic.

There is no length distinction in final stressed position, but only those vowels that occur long appear there: &lt;(ε)ι, ε, α, ο~ω, ου&gt;.

In Sahidic, the letter ''ε'' was used for short {{IPA|/e/}} before back fricatives, and also for unstressed schwa. It's possible there was also a distinction between short {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/a/}}, but if so the functional load was extremely low.

|-
! [[Open vowel|Open]]

|}

Again, length is neutralised in final stressed position: &lt;(ε)ι, η, ε, α, ο, ω~ου&gt;.

Bohairic did not have long vowels. {{IPA|/i/}} was only written &lt;ι&gt;. As above, it's possible that /u/ and /o/ were distinct vowels rather than just allophones.

| {{IPA|ɔ}} &lt;ο&gt;
|-
! [[Open vowel|Open]]
| colspan=2| {{IPA|a}} &lt;α&gt;
|}

In Late Coptic (that is, Late Bohairic), the vowels were reduced to those found in Egyptian Arabic, {{IPA|/a, i, u/}}. &lt;ω, ο&gt; became /u/, &lt;ε&gt; became /a/, and &lt;η&gt; became either /i/ or /a/. It is difficult to explain &lt;η&gt;. However, it generally became /a/ in stressed monosyllables, /i/ in unstressed monosyllables, and in polysyllables, /a/ when followed by /i/, and /i/ when not.

There were no doubled orthographic vowels in Mesokemic. Some representative correspondences with Sahidic are:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;
!Sahidic stressed vowels
|α||αα, εε||η||ο||ω||ωω
|-
!Mesokemic equivalent
|ε||η||η||α||ο||ω
|}

It is not clear if these correspondences reflect distinct pronunciations in Mesokemic, or if they are an imitation of the long Greek vowels &lt;η, ω&gt;.

=== Consonants ===
As with the vowels, there are differences of opinion over the correct interpretation of the Coptic consonant letters, particular the letters {{Coptic|ϫ}} and {{Coptic|ϭ}}. {{Coptic|ϫ}} is transcribed as {{angle bracket|j}} in many older Coptic sources and {{Coptic|ϭ}} as {{angle bracket|ɡ}}{{sfn|Plumley|1948}} or {{angle bracket|č}}. {{harvtxt|Lambdin|1983}} notes that the current conventional pronunciations are different from the probable ancient pronunciations: Sahidic {{Coptic|ϫ}} was probably pronounced {{IPA|[tʲ]}} and {{Coptic|ϭ}} was probably pronounced {{IPA|[kʲ]}}. {{harvtxt|Reintges|2004|p=22}} suggests that {{Coptic|ϫ}} was pronounced {{IPA|[tʃ]}}.

Beside being found in Greek loanwords, the letters {{angle bracket|φ, θ, χ}} were used in native words for a sequence of {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} plus {{IPA|/h/}}, as in {{Coptic|ⲑⲉ}} = {{Coptic|ⲧ-ϩⲉ}} &quot;the-way&quot; (f.sg.) and {{Coptic|ⲫⲟϥ}} = {{Coptic|ⲡ-ϩⲟϥ}} &quot;the-snake&quot; (m.sg). The letters did not have this use in Bohairic, which used them for single sounds.

It is possible that in addition there was a glottal stop, {{IPAlink|ʔ}}, that was not consistently written. Coptic does not seem to have had a glottal stop at the beginning of orthographically vowel-initial words. It is possible that vowels written double were an attempt to indicate glottal stop, rather than a long vowel, in the middle of a word. However, there is little evidence for this (e.g., Arabic loans with short vowels and glottal stop are not written with double vowels in Coptic, and Coptic words with double orthographic vowels are transcribed with long vowels rather than hamza in Arabic.)

In Late Coptic (ca. 14th century), Bohairic sounds that did not occur in Egyptian Arabic were lost. A possible shift from a tenuis-aspirate distinction to voiced-tenuis is only attested from the alveolars, the only place that Arabic has such a contrast.

Earlier phases of Egyptian may have contrasted voiceless and voiced bilabial plosives, but the distinction seems to have been lost. Late Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic all interchangeably use their respective graphemes to indicate either sound; for example, Coptic for 'iron' appears alternately as {{Coptic|ⲡⲉⲛⲓⲡⲉ}}, {{Coptic|ⲃⲉⲛⲓⲡⲉ}} and {{Coptic|ⲃⲓⲛⲓⲃⲉ}}. That probably reflects dialect variation. Both letters were interchanged with {{Coptic|ⲫ}} and {{Coptic|ϥ}} to indicate {{IPA|/f/}}, and {{Coptic|ⲃ}} was also used in many texts to indicate the bilabial approximant {{IPA|/w/}}. [[Coptology|Coptologists]] believe that Coptic {{Coptic|ⲃ}} was articulated as a [[voiced bilabial fricative]] {{IPA|[β]}}. In the present-day Coptic Church services, this letter is realised as {{IPA|/v/}}, but it is almost certainly a result of the [[Coptic pronunciation reform|pronunciation reforms]] instituted in the 19th century.

Whereas Old Egyptian contrasts {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}}, the two sounds appear to be in [[free variation]] in Coptic, as they were since the Middle Egyptian period. However, they are contrasted only in Greek loans; for example, native Coptic {{Coptic|ⲁⲛⲍⲏⲃ}} (''anzēb'') and {{Coptic|ⲁⲛⲥⲏⲃⲉ}} (''ansēbə'') 'school' are homophonous. Other consonants that sometimes appear to be either in free variation or to have different distributions across dialects are {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[d]}}, {{IPA|[ɾ]}} and {{IPA|[l]}} (especially in the Fayyumic dialect, a feature of earlier Egyptian) and {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[ɡ]}}, with the voiceless [[stop consonant]]s being more common in Coptic words and the voiced ones in Greek borrowings. Apart from the [[liquid consonant]]s, this pattern may indicate a [[sound change]] in Later Egyptian, leading to a neutralisation of voiced alveolar and velar plosives. When the voiced plosives are realised, it is usually the result of [[Consonant voicing and devoicing|consonant voicing]] in proximity to {{IPA|/n/}}.

Though there is no clear evidence that Coptic had a [[glottal stop]], different orthographic means have been posited for indicating one by those who believe that it did: with {{Coptic|ⲁ}} word-initially, with {{Coptic|ⲓ}} word-finally in monosyllabic words in northern dialects and {{Coptic|ⲉ}} in monosyllabic words in Akhmimic and Assiutic, by reduplication of a vowel's grapheme but mostly unwritten.

A few early manuscripts have a letter {{coptic|ⳋ}} or {{coptic|ⳃ}} ''ç'' where Sahidic and Bohairic have {{coptic|ϣ}} ''š''. and Akhmimic has {{coptic|ⳉ}} ''x''. This sound seems to have been lost early on.

== Grammar ==
Coptic is [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]] with [[subject–verb–object]] word order but can be [[verb–subject–object]] with the correct preposition in front of the subject. Number, gender, tense, and mood are indicated by prefixes that come from Late Egyptian. The earlier phases of Egyptian did this through suffixation. Some vestiges of the suffix inflection survive in Coptic, mainly to indicate [[inalienable possession]] and in some verbs. Compare the Middle Egyptian form ''*satāpafa'' 'he chooses' (written ''stp.f'' in hieroglyphs) to Coptic (Sahidic) ''f.sotp'' {{Coptic|ϥⲥⲱⲧⲡ̅}} 'he chooses'.

=== Nouns ===
All Coptic nouns carry [[grammatical gender]], either masculine or feminine, usually marked through a prefixed definite article as in the [[Romance languages]]. Masculine nouns are marked with the article {{IPA|/pə, peː/}} and feminine nouns with the article {{IPA|/tə, teː/}}{{sfn|Lambdin|1983|p=2}} in the Sahidic dialect and {{IPA|/pi, əp/}} and {{IPA|/ti, ət/}} in the Bohairic dialect.

Bohairic: {{Coptic|ⲡⲓⲣⲱⲙⲓ}} {{IPA|/pəˈɾoːmə/}} – 'the man' / {{Coptic|ϯϫⲓϫ}} {{IPA|/təˈt͡ʃʼiːt͡ʃ/}} – 'the hand'

Sahidic: {{Coptic|ⲡⲉⲣⲱⲙⲉ}} {{IPA|/pəˈɾoːmə/}} – 'the man' / {{Coptic|ⲧⲉϫⲓϫ}} {{IPA|/təˈt͡ʃiːt͡ʃ/}} – 'the hand'

The definite and indefinite articles also indicate [[Grammatical number|number]]; however, only definite articles mark gender. Coptic has a number of [[broken plural]]s, a vestige of Older Egyptian, but in the majority of cases, the article marks number. Generally, nouns [[inflection|inflected]] for plurality end in {{IPA|/wə/}}, but there are some irregularities. The dual was another feature of earlier Egyptian that survives in Coptic in only few words, such as {{Coptic|ⲥⲛⲁⲩ}} (''snau'') 'two'.

Words of Greek origin keep their original grammatical gender, except for neuter nouns, which become masculine in Coptic.

[[File:Sobieski Crown.PNG|thumb|upright|Portrayal of Sobieski's royal crown, [[Gdańsk]]]]

Sobieski is remembered in Poland as a &quot;hero king&quot;, victor at Vienna who defeated the Ottoman threat, an image that became particularly well recognized after his story was told in many works of 19th century literature.&lt;ref name=psb420&gt;Red. (Eds.), ''Jan III Sobieski'', p.420&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Polski słownik biograficzny]] he is described as &quot;an individual above his contemporaries, but still one of them&quot;; an oligarch and a magnate, interested in personal wealth and power.&lt;ref name=psb420/&gt; His ambitions for the most part were instilled in him by his beloved wife, whom he undoubtedly loved more than any throne (when being forced to divorce her and marry the former Queen as a condition to gain the throne, he immediately refused the throne) and tended to obey, at times blindly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Battaglia|first1=O.Forst|title=The Cambridge History of Poland|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781001288024|page=539|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N883AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA539}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Drohojowska|first1=Countess Antoinette Joséphine Françoise Anne|last2=Salvandy|first2=Achille (Count.)|title=Love of Country, or Sobieski and Hedwig.

He failed to reform the ailing Commonwealth, and to secure the throne for his heir.&lt;ref name=psb420/&gt; At the same time, he displayed high military prowess, he was well educated and literate, and a patron of science and arts. He supported the astronomer [[Johannes Hevelius]], mathematician [[Adam Adamandy Kochański]] and the historian and poet [[Wespazjan Kochowski]]. His [[Wilanów Palace]] became the first of many palaces that would dot the lands of the Commonwealth over the next two centuries.&lt;ref name=psb420/&gt;

== Popular culture ==
* John III Sobieski sometimes appears in the loading screen in the computer strategy game, [[Europa Universalis IV]].
* His involvement in the [[Battle of Vienna]] is also referenced in the ''[[Baroque Cycle]]'' novels:

{{Quote|text=When he turned to go back to the camp, he discovered that there was another man up on this hill, a stone’s throw away: some kind of monk or holy man, perhaps, as he was dressed in a rough sackcloth robe, with no finery. But then the bloke whipped out a sword. It was not one of your needle-thin rapiers, such as fops pushed at each other in the streets of London and Paris, but some kind of relic of the Crusades, a two-handed production with a single crossbar instead of a proper guard—the sort of thing Richard the Lionhearted might’ve used to slay camels in the streets of Jerusalem. This man went down on one knee in the dirt, and he did it with verve and enthusiasm. You see your rich man kneeling in church and it takes him two or three minutes, you can hear his knees popping and sinews creaking, he totters this way and that, creating small alarums amongst the servants who are gripping his elbows. But this brute knelt easily, even ''lustily'' if such a thing were possible, and facing toward the city of Vienna, he planted his sword in the ground so that it became a steel cross. The morning light was shining directly into his grizzled face and glinting from the steel of the blade and glowing in some indifferent colored jewels set into the weapon’s hilt and crossbar. The man bowed his head and took to mumbling in Latin. The hand that wasn’t holding the sword was thumbing through a rosary—Jack’s cue to exit stage right. But as he was leaving he recognized the man with the broadsword as King John Sobieski.|author=Neal Stephenson|source=''King of the Vagabonds'', chapter &quot;The Continent&quot;}}
* He appears in his pre-royalty status as a character in [[Mount &amp; Blade: With Fire &amp; Sword]].
* Sobieski appears as a character in the historical novel ''[[Poland (novel)|Poland]]'' by [[James A. Michener]] in a chapter recounting the [[Battle of Vienna]].

'''Dartmouth Dam''' is a large rock-fill [[embankment dam]] with an [[spillway#type|uncontrolled chute spillway]] across the [[Mitta Mitta River|Mitta Mitta]], [[Gibbo River|Gibbo]], and [[Dart River (Victoria)|Dart]] rivers, the Morass Creek and a number of small tributaries. The dam is located near [[Mount Bogong]] in the north-east of the [[Australia]]n state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. The dam's purpose includes [[irrigation]], the generation of [[hydroelectricity|hydro-electric power]], [[water supply]] and conservation. The impounded [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]] is called '''Dartmouth Reservoir''', sometimes called '''Lake Dartmouth'''. The '''Dartmouth Power Station''', a hydro-electric power station that generates power to the national grid, is located near the dam wall.

A smaller pond, called the '''Dartmouth Dam Regulating Pond''' or '''Banimboola Pondage''', approximately {{convert|9|km||0}} downstream of the main dam, also across the Mitta Mitta River, is located adjacent the [[Banimboola Hydroelectric Power Station]] and forms part of the Dartmouth Dam complex of facilities.

==Location and features==
Designed by the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission of Victoria, construction commenced in 1973 and was completed in 1979 by [[Thiess Pty Ltd|Thiess Brothers]], at a cost of {{AUD}}179&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://portal.engineersaustralia.org.au/system/files/engineering-heritage-australia/nomination-title/Dartmouth_Dam_nomination.pdf|title=Nomination of Dartmouth Dam as a National Engineering Landmark|publisher=Engineering Heritage Australia (Victoria)|date=1 June 2004|page=6|accessdate=3 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The embankment dam wall is constructed with an earth core and rock fill, rising to a height of {{convert|180|m|ft|0}} from the lowest part of the foundation to the roadway across the top of the dam; making the dam wall the highest in Australia.&lt;ref name=ancold&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancold.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Dams-Australia-2010-v1-for-website.xls|format=Excel (requires download)|title=Register of Large Dams in Australia|publisher=The Australian National Committee on Large Dams Incorporated|year=2010|accessdate=4 March 2014|work=Dams information}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core component materials of the wall include {{convert|10.5|e6m3}} of rock, {{convert|0.8|e6m3}} of filter material made from crushed quarried rock, and {{convert|2.8|e6m3}} of earth for the core.&lt;ref name=mdba/&gt; The reservoir has a capacity of {{convert|3856|GL|gal|0}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdbc.gov.au/rmw/river_murray_system/dartmouth_reservoir |publisher=Murray Darling Basin Commission |title=Dartmouth Dam |accessdate=5 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908101830/http://www.mdbc.gov.au/rmw/river_murray_system/dartmouth_reservoir/ |archivedate=8 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or approximately 6.7 times the capacity of [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]]; and can release a maximum outflow of approximately {{convert|12000|ML|gal|0}} per day in normal operation.&lt;ref name=mdba&gt;{{cite web|title=Dartmouth Dam|url=http://www.mdba.gov.au/what-we-do/managing-rivers/river-murray-system/dams-weirs/dartmouth-dam|publisher=[[Murray-Darling Basin Authority]]|accessdate=10 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140212195425/http://www.mdba.gov.au/what-we-do/managing-rivers/river-murray-system/dams-weirs/dartmouth-dam|archive-date=12 February 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crest of the uncontrolled spillway is {{convert|486|m|ft|0}} {{AHD}} and is approximately {{convert|92|m|ft|0}} long. When full, flood flows spill over the crest and down an {{convert|80|m|ft|0}} long concrete chute. The water then returns to the river via an open rock cascade which gradually widens to {{convert|300|m|ft|0}} at river level. Once Dartmouth Reservoir reaches 99% capacity, it is considered to be 'operationally full' and releases are then set to pass inflows downstream to prevent the level rising further. Releases are passed through the outlet works and power station whenever possible and water will only flow over the spillway if significant flood inflows enter from upstream when the storage is close to full. This approach reduces the chance of downstream flooding, maximises operating flexibility for hydro-power generation and protects the spillway.&lt;ref name=mdba/&gt;

The Dartmouth Dam stores water from the Victorian &quot;High Country's&quot; snow fields for summer release into the Mitta Mitta (and the downstream [[Lake Hume]]) and subsequently into the greater [[Murray River]] for irrigation. The reservoir's inflow and outflow capacity is quite small considering its size, meaning that its levels vary little compared with some other dams on the Murray and their tributaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mdbc.gov.au/rmw/river_murray_system/dartmouth_reservoir/hume_and_dartmouth_dams_operations_review/backgrounder_4:_lake_dartmouth:_overview_of_operation |publisher=Murray Darling Basin Commission |title=Backgrounder 4: Lake Dartmouth – Overview of Operation |accessdate=5 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911064244/http://www.mdbc.gov.au/rmw/river_murray_system/dartmouth_reservoir/hume_and_dartmouth_dams_operations_review/backgrounder_4%3A_lake_dartmouth%3A_overview_of_operation/ |archivedate=11 September 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reservoir is a popular recreational [[trout]] fishery, being regularly restocked by the Victorian Department of Primary Industries.

===Hydro-electric power generation===
Designed by the [[State Electricity Commission of Victoria]], and constructed by Lewis Constructions Limited, and commissioned in January 1981, Dartmouth Power Station has one [[Francis turbine]]-[[Electrical generator|generator]], with a generating capacity of {{convert|180|MW}}, the largest single installed hydroelectric turbine in Australia. It is owned and operated by [[Australian Gas Light Company|AGL Hydro]].&lt;ref name=agl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agl.com.au/AGLNew/About+AGL/Generation+assets/Hydro+electric+power/Dartmouth.htm |publisher=[[Australian Gas Light Company|AGL Hydro]] |title=Dartmouth Power Station |accessdate=13 October 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060918180303/http://www.agl.com.au/AGLNew/About+AGL/Generation+assets/Hydro+electric+power/Dartmouth.htm |archivedate=18 September 2006 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The turbine casing and concrete machine block surrounding the power station were destroyed in May 1990 when two steel beams entered the turbine. The resulting force ruined the power station and the dam's control systems, making it impossible to gradually release water from the near-capacity dam by conventional means. An improvised system, placing large pipes over the spillway to siphon water over it, was soon installed, but the inflow from an unusually wet spring was such that the dam would have overflowed anyway, leading to a spectacular cascade over the huge rock steps formed when the rock used for the dam itself was quarried from the valley walls. The station was subsequently re-built and recommissioned in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Newsletter of Engineering Heritage|url=http://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/sites/default/files/shado/Learned%20Groups/Interest%20Groups/Engineering%20Heritage/EHA%20No_%2017%20Nov05_1.pdf|publisher=The Institution of Engineers, Australia|accessdate=8 February 2012|date=November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The capacity of the regulating pondage was increased in 2003 to further optimise the power station's generation flexibility. The station is connected to the electricity grid via a 220 kV transmission line to [[Mount Beauty, Victoria|Mt Beauty]], {{convert|40|km||0}} away.&lt;ref name=agl/&gt;

==Power Station Accident==
On 2 May 1990, the 180MW Francis turbine-generator running at full speed was instantaneously stopped by a foreign body left in the penstock following maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;SECV, &quot;Report of Investigation into the cause of damage of Dartmouth Power Station on 2 May 1990&quot;, State Electricity Commission of Victoria, Power Grid and Distribution Department Publications, June 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  The installation shifted about 2m within the base of the 180m high earth and rock fill gravity dam wall of the 3,906GL reservoir. After initial consternation regarding the integrity of the wall (declared safe after lengthy assessment), the hydro installation was repaired/replaced but was off-line for several years. A breach of the wall would have obliterated only a couple of small towns and a sparsely settled agricultural area in the relatively narrow 120&amp;nbsp;km Mitta Mitta valley below the dam, but more significantly, would have resulted in the over-topping and probable failure of the earthen walls of the 40m high 3,038GL Lake Hume, 200&amp;nbsp;km downstream on the Murray River. This is immediately upstream of the regional cities of Albury and Wodonga and a much more intensively settled irrigation area, and consequences would have been disastrous.

==Ecological impact on the Murray-Darling Basin==
The construction and operation of Dartmouth Dam has caused significant changes to the flow patterns and ecology of the Mitta Mitta and [[Murray River|Murray]] rivers. In particular, the unnaturally cold water released from the dam, up to 10&amp;nbsp;°C (18&amp;nbsp;°F) colder than it naturally should be, contributed directly to the disappearance of the [[Murray Cod]], [[Trout cod]] and [[Macquarie Perch]] from the Mitta Mitta River within the first few years of the start of the dam's existence. Cold water pollution caused by Dartmouth Dam is also considered to have contributed to the disappearance of the [[Eel-tailed catfish|freshwater catfish]] from the upper-reaches of the Murray River.&lt;ref&gt;NSW Cold Water Pollution Interagency Group (2012) ''Cold Water Pollution Strategy in NSW - report on the implementation of stage one'',  NSW Department of Primary Industries, a division of NSW Department of Trade and Investment, Regional Infrastructure and Services, Sydney, New South Wales, {{ISBN|9781742563107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SCD algebraic notation.svg|right|Algebraic notation|frame]]
'''Algebraic notation''' (or '''AN''') is the standard method for recording and describing the moves in a game of [[chess]]. It is based on a system of [[coordinates]] to uniquely identify each square on the [[chessboard]]. It is used by most books, magazines, and newspapers. In English-speaking countries, the parallel method of [[descriptive notation]] was generally used in chess publications until about 1980. A few players still use descriptive notation, but it is no longer recognized by [[FIDE]], the international chess governing body.

Algebraic notation exists in various forms and languages and is based on a system developed by [[Philipp Stamma]]. Stamma used the modern names of the squares, but he used ''p'' for pawn moves and the original {{chessgloss|file}} of a piece (''a'' through ''h'') instead of the initial letter of the piece name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A Short History of Chess | publisher=David McKay | author=Davidson, Henry | year=1981 | pages=152–153 | isbn=978-0679145509 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming the squares==
Each square of the [[chessboard]] is identified by a unique coordinate pair—a letter and a number—from White's point of view. The vertical columns of squares, called ''{{chessgloss|file|files}}'', are labeled ''a'' through ''h'' from White's left (the {{chessgloss|queenside}}) to right (the {{chessgloss|kingside}}). The horizontal rows of squares, called ''{{chessgloss|rank|ranks}}'', are numbered ''1'' to ''8'' starting from White's side of the board. Thus each square has a unique identification of file letter followed by rank number. (For example, White's king starts the game on square e1; Black's knight on b8 can move to open squares a6 or c6.)

==Naming the pieces==
Each [[chess piece|piece type]] (other than pawns) is identified by an uppercase letter. English-speaking players use the letters ''K'' for [[king (chess)|king]], ''Q'' for [[queen (chess)|queen]], ''R'' for [[rook (chess)|rook]], ''B'' for [[bishop (chess)|bishop]], and ''N'' for [[knight (chess)|knight]] (since K is already used). ''S'' (from the German ''Springer'') was also used for the knight in the early days of algebraic notation and is still used in some [[chess problem]]s (where ''N'' stands for [[nightrider (chess)|nightrider]], a popular [[fairy chess piece]]).

Different letters may be used by other languages; for example, French-speaking players use ''F'' for bishop (from ''fou''). In chess literature, especially that intended for an international audience, the language-specific letters are often replaced by universal icons for the pieces; for example, Nf3 is represented as &lt;big&gt;♘&lt;/big&gt;f3. This style is known as [[Chess symbols in Unicode|figurine algebraic notation]].

Pawns are not identified by an uppercase letter, but rather by the absence of one. Distinguishing between pawns is not done when recording moves (pawn {{chessgloss|captures}} are an exception and indicated differently as explained below), since only one pawn can move to a given square.

==Notation for moves==
Each move of a piece is indicated by the piece's uppercase letter, plus the coordinate of the destination square. For example, '''Be5''' (move a bishop to e5), '''Nf3''' (move a knight to f3). For pawn moves, a letter indicating pawn is not used, only the destination square is given. For example, '''c5''' (move a pawn to c5).

===Captures &lt;span id=&quot;e.p.&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;===
When a piece makes a {{chessgloss|capture}}, an &quot;x&quot; is inserted immediately before the destination square. For example, '''Bxe5''' (bishop captures the piece on e5). When a pawn makes a capture, the ''file'' from which the pawn departed is used to identify the pawn. For example, '''exd5''' (pawn on the e-file captures the piece on d5). A [[colon (punctuation)|colon]] (:) is sometimes used instead of &quot;x&quot;, either in the same place the &quot;x&quot; would go ('''B:e5''') or at the end ('''Be5:'''), but this is not the FIDE standard.

''[[En passant]]'' captures are indicated by specifying the capturing pawn's file of departure, the &quot;x&quot;, the destination square (not the square of the captured pawn), and (optionally) the suffix &quot;e.p.&quot; indicating the capture was ''en passant''.{{refn|Appendix C.9.3 in FIDE Laws of Chess&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=FIDE Laws of Chess taking effect from 1 January 2018|url=https://handbook.fide.com/chapter/E012018|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 July 2020|website=FIDE}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} For example, '''exd6 e.p.'''

Some texts, such as the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings]]'', omit any indication that a capture has been made. (For example, '''Be5''' instead of Bxe5; '''ed6''' instead of exd6 or exd6e.p.) When it is unambiguous to do so, a pawn capture is sometimes described by specifying only the files involved ('''exd''' or even '''ed'''). These shortened forms are sometimes called ''minimal'' or ''abbreviated'' algebraic notation.

When two (or more) identical pieces can move to the same square, the moving piece is uniquely identified by specifying the piece's letter, followed by (in descending order of preference):
# the file of departure (if they differ); or
# the rank of departure (if the files are the same but the ranks differ); or
# both the file and rank of departure (if neither alone is sufficient to identify the piece&amp;mdash;which occurs only in rare cases where a player has three or more identical pieces able to reach the same square, as a result of one or more pawns having [[promotion (chess)|promoted]]).

In the diagram, both black rooks could legally move to f8, so the move of the d8-rook to f8 is disambiguated as '''Rdf8'''. For the white rooks on the a-file which could both move to a3, it is necessary to provide the ''rank'' of the moving piece, i.e., '''R1a3'''.

In the case of the white queen on h4 moving to e1, neither the rank nor file alone are sufficient to disambiguate from the other white queens. As such, this move is written '''Qh4e1'''.

As above, an &quot;x&quot; can be inserted to indicate a capture; for example, if the final case were a capture, it would be written as '''Qh4xe1'''.

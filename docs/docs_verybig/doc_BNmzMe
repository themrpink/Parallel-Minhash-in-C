In [[physics]], a '''standing wave''', also known as a '''stationary wave''', is a [[wave]] which oscillates in time but whose peak amplitude profile does not move in space.  The peak [[amplitude]] of the wave oscillations at any point in space is constant with time, and the oscillations at different points throughout the wave are [[in phase]].   The locations at which the absolute value of the amplitude is minimum are called [[node (physics)|node]]s, and the locations where the absolute value of the amplitude is maximum are called [[antinode]]s.

Standing waves were first noticed by [[Michael Faraday]] in 1831.  Faraday observed standing waves on the surface of a liquid in a vibrating container.&lt;ref&gt;Alwyn Scott (ed), ''Encyclopedia of Nonlinear Science'', p. 683, Routledge, 2006 {{ISBN|1135455589}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Y. Wu, &quot;Stability of nonlinear waves resonantly sustained&quot;, ''Nonlinear Instability of Nonparallel Flows: IUTAM Symposium Potsdam, New York'', p. 368, Springer, 2012 {{ISBN|3642850847}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Franz Melde]] coined the term &quot;standing wave&quot; (German: ''stehende Welle'' or ''Stehwelle'') around 1860 and demonstrated the phenomenon in his classic experiment with vibrating strings.&lt;ref&gt;Melde, Franz. Ueber einige krumme Flächen, welche von Ebenen, parallel einer bestimmten Ebene, durchschnitten, als Durchschnittsfigur einen Kegelschnitt liefern: Inaugural-Dissertation...

This phenomenon can occur because the medium is moving in the opposite direction to the wave, or it can arise in a stationary medium as a result of [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] between two waves traveling in opposite directions. The most common cause of standing waves is the phenomenon of [[resonance]], in which standing waves occur inside a [[resonator]] due to interference between waves reflected back and forth at the resonator's [[resonant frequency]].

For waves of equal [[amplitude]] traveling in opposing directions, there is on [[average]] no net [[Flux#Transport phenomena|propagation of energy]].

==Moving medium==
As an example of the first type, under certain meteorological conditions standing waves form in the atmosphere in the [[Lee waves|lee]] of mountain ranges.  Such waves are often exploited by [[gliding|glider pilots]].

Standing waves and [[hydraulic jump]]s also form on fast flowing [[Rapid|river rapids]] and tidal currents such as the [[Saltstraumen]] [[maelstrom]]. Many standing river waves are popular [[River surfing#Standing waves|river surfing]] breaks.

As an example of the second type, a ''standing wave'' in a [[transmission line]] is a wave in which the distribution of [[current (electricity)|current]], [[voltage]], or [[field strength]] is formed by the [[Superposition principle|superposition]] of two waves of the same [[frequency]] propagating in opposite directions.  The effect is a series of [[node (physics)|node]]s (zero [[particle displacement|displacement]]) and [[anti-node]]s (maximum [[particle displacement|displacement]]) at fixed points along the transmission line.  Such a standing wave may be formed when a wave is transmitted into one end of a transmission line and is [[reflection (electrical)|reflected]] from the other end by an [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] [[Impedance matching|mismatch]], ''i.e.'', discontinuity, such as an [[wikt:open circuit|open circuit]] or a [[short circuit|short]].&lt;ref&gt;{{FS1037C}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The failure of the line to transfer power at the standing wave frequency will usually result in [[attenuation distortion]].

In practice, losses in the transmission line and other components mean that a perfect reflection and a pure standing wave are never achieved.  The result is a ''partial standing wave'', which is a superposition of a standing wave and a traveling wave.  The degree to which the wave resembles either a pure standing wave or a pure traveling wave is measured by the [[standing wave ratio]] (SWR).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Fundamentals of Physical Acoustics | first=David T. | last=Blackstock | publisher=Wiley–IEEE | year=2000 | isbn=0-471-31979-1 |page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is standing waves in the open [[ocean]] formed by waves with the same wave period moving in opposite directions. These may form near storm centres, or from reflection of a swell at the shore, and are the source of [[microbarom]]s and [[microseism]]s.

== Mathematical description ==

This section considers representative one-dimensional cases of standing waves. First, an example of an infinite length string shows how identical waves traveling in opposite directions interfere to produce standing waves. Next, two finite length string examples with different [[boundary value problem|boundary conditions]] demonstrate how the boundary conditions restrict the frequencies that can form standing waves. Finally, the example of sound waves in a pipe demonstrates how the same principles can be applied to longitudinal waves with analogous boundary conditions.

Standing waves can also occur in two- or three-dimensional [[resonator]]s.  With standing waves on two-dimensional membranes such as [[drumhead]]s, illustrated in the animations above, the nodes become nodal lines, lines on the surface at which there is no movement, that separate regions vibrating with opposite phase.  These nodal line patterns are called [[Chladni figure]]s.  In three-dimensional resonators, such as musical instrument [[sound box]]es and microwave [[cavity resonator]]s, there are nodal surfaces.

=== Standing wave on an infinite length string ===

To begin, consider a string of infinite length along the ''x''-axis that is free to be stretched [[transverse wave|transversely]] in the ''y'' direction.

For a [[harmonic wave]] traveling to the right along the string, the string's [[displacement (geometry)|displacement]] in the ''y'' direction as a function of position ''x'' and time ''t'' is{{sfn|Halliday|Resnick|Walker|2005|p=432}}
:&lt;math&gt; y_\text{R}(x,t) =  y_\text{max}\sin \left({2\pi x \over \lambda} - \omega t \right). &lt;/math&gt;

The displacement in the ''y''-direction for an identical harmonic wave traveling to the left is
:&lt;math&gt; y_\text{L}(x,t) = y_\text{max}\sin \left({2\pi x \over \lambda} + \omega t \right), &lt;/math&gt;

where
*''y''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[amplitude]] of the displacement of the string for each wave,
*''ω'' is the [[angular frequency]] or equivalently ''2π'' times the [[frequency]] ''f'',
*''λ'' is the [[wavelength]] of the wave.

For identical right- and left-traveling waves on the same string, the total displacement of the string is the sum of ''y''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt; y(x,t) = y_\text{R} + y_\text{L} = y_\text{max}\sin \left({2\pi x \over \lambda} - \omega t \right) + y_\text{max}\sin \left({2\pi x \over \lambda} + \omega t \right). &lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[Trigonometric identity#Product-to-sum and sum-to-product identities|trigonometric sum-to-product identity]] &lt;math&gt;\sin a + \sin b = 2\sin \left({a+b \over 2}\right)\cos \left({a-b \over 2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;,
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; y(x,t) = 2y_\text{max}\sin \left({2\pi x \over \lambda} \right) \cos(\omega t). &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

Note that Equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) does not describe a traveling wave. At any position ''x'', ''y''(''x'',''t'') simply oscillates in time with an amplitude that varies in the ''x''-direction as &lt;math&gt;2y_\text{max}\sin \left({2\pi x \over \lambda}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.{{sfn|Halliday|Resnick|Walker|2005|p=432}} The animation at the beginning of this article depicts what is happening. As the left-traveling blue wave and right-traveling green wave interfere, they form the standing red wave that does not travel and instead oscillates in place.

Because the string is of infinite length, it has no boundary condition for its displacement at any point along the ''x''-axis. As a result, a standing wave can form at any frequency.

At locations on the ''x''-axis that are ''even'' multiples of a quarter wavelength,
:&lt;math&gt;x = \ldots, -{3\lambda \over 2}, \; -\lambda, \; -{\lambda \over 2}, \; 0, \; {\lambda \over 2}, \; \lambda, \; {3\lambda \over 2}, \ldots &lt;/math&gt;

the amplitude is always zero. These locations are called [[node (physics)|node]]s. At locations on the ''x''-axis that are ''odd'' multiples of a quarter wavelength
:&lt;math&gt;x = \ldots, -{5\lambda \over 4}, \; -{3\lambda \over 4}, \; -{\lambda \over 4}, \; {\lambda \over 4}, \; {3\lambda \over 4}, \; {5\lambda \over 4}, \ldots &lt;/math&gt;

the amplitude is maximal, with a value of twice the amplitude of the right- and left-traveling waves that interfere to produce this standing wave pattern. These locations are called [[anti-node]]s.  The distance between two consecutive nodes or anti-nodes is half the wavelength, ''λ''/2.

=== Standing wave on a string with two fixed ends ===

Next, consider a string with fixed ends at {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} 0}} and {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} ''L''}}. The string will have some damping as it is stretched by traveling waves, but assume the damping is very small. Suppose that at the {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} 0}} fixed end a sinusoidal force is applied that drives the string up and down in the y-direction with a small amplitude at some frequency ''f''. In this situation, the driving force produces a right-traveling wave. That wave [[reflection (physics)|reflects]] off the right fixed end and travels back to the left, reflects again off the left fixed end and travels back to the right, and so on. Eventually, a steady state is reached where the string has identical right- and left-traveling waves as in the infinite-length case and the power dissipated by damping in the string equals the power supplied by the driving force so the waves have constant amplitude.

Equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) still describes the standing wave pattern that can form on this string, but now Equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) is subject to [[boundary condition]]s where {{nowrap|''y'' {{=}} 0}} at {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} 0}} and {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} ''L''}} because the string is fixed at {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} ''L''}} and because we assume the driving force at the fixed {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} 0}} end has small amplitude. Checking the values of ''y'' at the two ends,
:&lt;math&gt; y(0,t) = 0, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; y(L,t) = 2y_\text{max}\sin \left({2\pi L \over \lambda} \right) \cos(\omega t) = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Standing waves on a string.gif|thumb|upright|Standing waves in a string&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; the [[fundamental frequency|fundamental]] mode and the first 5 [[harmonic]]s.]]

The latter boundary condition is satisfied when &lt;math&gt; \sin \left({2\pi L \over \lambda} \right) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;. ''L'' is given, so the boundary condition restricts the wavelength of the standing waves to{{sfn|Halliday|Resnick|Walker|2005|p=434}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{2L}{n}, &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}
:&lt;math&gt;n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots &lt;/math&gt;

Waves can only form standing waves on this string if they have a wavelength that satisfies this relationship with ''L''. If waves travel with speed ''v'' along the string, then equivalently the frequency of the standing waves is restricted to{{sfn|Halliday|Resnick|Walker|2005|p=434}}{{sfn|Serway|Faughn|1992|p=472}}
:&lt;math&gt; f = \frac{v}{\lambda} = \frac{nv}{2L}. &lt;/math&gt;

The standing wave with {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 1}} oscillates at the [[fundamental frequency]] and has a wavelength that is twice the length of the string. Higher integer values of ''n'' correspond to modes of oscillation called [[harmonic]]s or [[overtone]]s. Any standing wave on the string will have ''n'' + 1 nodes including the fixed ends and ''n'' anti-nodes.

To compare this example's nodes to the description of nodes for standing waves in the infinite length string, note that Equation ({{EquationNote|2}}) can be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{4L}{n}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; n = 2, 4, 6, \ldots &lt;/math&gt;

In this variation of the expression for the wavelength, ''n'' must be even. Cross multiplying we see that because ''L'' is a node, it is an ''even'' multiple of a quarter wavelength,
:&lt;math&gt; L = \frac{n\lambda}{4}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; n = 2, 4, 6, \ldots &lt;/math&gt;

This example demonstrates a type of [[resonance]] and the frequencies that produce standing waves can be referred to as ''resonant frequencies''.{{sfn|Halliday|Resnick|Walker|2005|p=434}}{{sfn|Serway|Faughn|1992|p=475-476}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | date = May 21, 2014 | title = String Resonance | url = http://digitalsoundandmusic.com/video/?tutorial=oZ38Y0K8e-Y | access-date = August 22, 2020 | publisher = Digital Sound &amp; Music | id = YouTube Video ID: oZ38Y0K8e-Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Standing wave on a string with one fixed end ===

Next, consider the same string of length ''L'', but this time it is only fixed at {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} 0}}. At {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} ''L''}}, the string is free to move in the ''y'' direction. For example, the string might be tied at {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} ''L''}} to a ring that can slide freely up and down a pole. The string again has small damping and is driven by a small driving force at {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} 0}}.

In this case, Equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) still describes the standing wave pattern that can form on the string, and the string has the same boundary condition of {{nowrap|''y'' {{=}} 0}} at {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} 0}}. However, at {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} ''L''}} where the string can move freely there should be an anti-node with maximal amplitude of ''y''. Reviewing Equation ({{EquationNote|1}}), for {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} ''L''}} the largest amplitude of ''y'' occurs when
:&lt;math&gt; \sin \left({2\pi L \over \lambda}\right) = 1. &lt;/math&gt;

This leads to a different set of wavelengths than in the two-fixed-ends example. Here, the wavelength of the standing waves is restricted to
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{4L}{n}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; n = 1, 3, 5, \ldots &lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently, the frequency is restricted to
:&lt;math&gt; f = \frac{nv}{4L}. &lt;/math&gt;

Note that in this example ''n'' only takes odd values. Because ''L'' is an anti-node, it is an ''odd'' multiple of a quarter wavelength. Thus the fundamental mode in this example only has one quarter of a complete sine cycle–zero at {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} 0}} and the first peak at {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} ''L''}}–the first harmonic has three quarters of a complete sine cycle, and so on.

This example also demonstrates a type of resonance and the frequencies that produce standing waves are called ''resonant frequencies''.

=== Standing wave in a pipe ===
{{see also|Acoustic resonance#Resonance of a tube of air}}

Consider a standing wave in a pipe of length ''L''. The air inside the pipe serves as the medium for [[longitudinal wave|longitudinal]] [[sound wave]]s traveling to the right or left through the pipe. While the transverse waves on the string from the previous examples vary in their displacement perpendicular to the direction of wave motion, the waves traveling through the air in the pipe vary in terms of their pressure and longitudinal displacement along the direction of wave motion. The wave propagates by alternately compressing and expanding air in segments of the pipe, which displaces the air slightly from its rest position and transfers energy to neighboring segments through the forces exerted by the alternating high and low air pressures.{{sfn|Halliday|Resnick|Walker|2005|p=450}} Equations resembling those for the wave on a string can be written for the change in pressure Δ''p'' due to a right- or left-traveling wave in the pipe.
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta p_\text{R}(x,t) =  p_\text{max}\sin \left({2\pi x \over \lambda} - \omega t \right), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta p_\text{L}(x,t) = p_\text{max}\sin \left({2\pi x \over \lambda} + \omega t \right), &lt;/math&gt;

where
*''p''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is the pressure amplitude or the maximum increase or decrease in air pressure due to each wave,
*''ω'' is the [[angular frequency]] or equivalently ''2π'' times the [[frequency]] ''f'',
*''λ'' is the [[wavelength]] of the wave.

If identical right- and left-traveling waves travel through the pipe, the resulting superposition is described by the sum
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta p(x,t) = \Delta p_\text{R}(x,t) + \Delta p_\text{L}(x,t) = 2p_\text{max}\sin \left({2\pi x \over \lambda} \right) \cos(\omega t).&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this formula for the pressure is of the same form as Equation ({{EquationNote|1}}), so a stationary pressure wave forms that is fixed in space and oscillates in time.

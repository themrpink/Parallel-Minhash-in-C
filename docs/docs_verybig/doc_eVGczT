'''Marsala''' ({{IPA-it|marˈsala}}; {{lang-scn|Maissala}}, {{IPA-scn|majsˈsalà|pron}}; {{lang-la|Lilybaeum}}) is an Italian town located in the [[Province of Trapani]] in the westernmost part of [[Sicily]]. Marsala is the most populated town in its province and the fifth in Sicily.

The town is famous for the docking of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] on 11 May 1860 (the ''[[Expedition of the Thousand]]'') and for its [[Marsala wine]]. A feature of the area is the [[Stagnone Lagoon]] Natural Reserve — a marine area with salt ponds.

Marsala is built on the ruins of the ancient [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]] city of Lilybaeum, and includes in its territory the archaeological site of the island of [[Motya]], an ancient Phoenician town. The modern name likely derived from the Arabic {{lang|ar|مَرْسَى عَلِيّ}} (''marsā ʿaliyy'', “Ali's harbor”), or possibly {{lang|ar|مَرْسَى اللّٰه}} (''marsā llāh'', “God's harbor”).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/marsala|title=marsala {{!}} Origin and meaning of the name marsala by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
Situated at the extreme western point of [[Sicily]], the town was founded on Lilibeo Cape from where the [[Aegadian Islands]] and the [[Stagnone Lagoon]] can be seen.

===Territory===
The territory of Marsala, {{convert|241|km2|sqmi|0}}, has a rich cultural and landscape heritage; its area includes the [[Stagnone Lagoon]], a Natural Reserve in which is located the island of [[Mozia]].

The city of Marsala had a population of about 86,000 until the end of 1970, when [[Petrosino]], a village formerly part of Marsala, decided to become a self-governing town after a local referendum.

The area of Marsala is classified as a [[seismic zone]] 2 (medium). In the last 200 years three earthquakes of medium-high intensity were recorded:
*18 May 1828 – magnitude 5.17 (about VI [[Mercalli intensity scale|Mercalli]] scale)
*15 January 1968 – [[1968 Belice earthquake|Belice earthquake]] which in Marsala reached VII Mercalli scale (although its intensity was as high as X in other locations).
*7 June 1981 – magnitude 4.60 (IV–V scala Mercalli scale) with epicentre in Borgo Elefante in [[Mazara del Vallo]], about {{convert|20|km|mi|0}} from the town-centre of Marsala.

=== Climate ===
Marsala has a [[Mediterranean climate#Hot-summer mediterranean climate|hot-summer mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa''), similar to most [[coast]]al towns in [[Sicily]], with hot and dry [[summer]]s coupled with moderately wet and mild winters. [[Weather]] in Marsala is similar to that of nearby [[Trapani]].

Summers are generally warm with a record maximum [[temperature]] of {{convert|37|°C|0|abbr=on}} in August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dove-e-quando.it/when/europa/sicilia/marsala/agosto/|title=Marsala in Agosto 2018 - Clima, Meteo e Temperature in agosto|last=Samson|first=Tony|website=Dove e Quando andare?|language=it-IT|access-date=2018-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer, due to how dry it is, it is not unusual to experience the effect of [[Sirocco]] wind, which brings dust and sand from the Sahara.

[[Winter]]s are generally rainy and cooler with temperatures ranging between minimum of {{convert|1|°C|0|abbr=on}} (in December 2014) and {{convert|21|°C|0|abbr=on}}.  [[Snowfall]] occurs very rarely, since the temperature has never dropped below [[freezing]], although snow has fallen before, for example in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.itacanotizie.it/marsala-arriva-neve/|title=Anche a Marsala arriva la neve|date=2014-12-31|work=Itaca Notizie|access-date=2018-07-07|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythology ==
In Greek mythology, the [[Argonaut]] [[Butes]] was the only who jumped in the sea while the Argonauts were sailing past the [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s because  he couldn't resist the charm of their singing, but [[Aphrodite]] saved him and transferred him to Lilybaeum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-grc1:1.9.25 Apollodorus, Library, 1.9.25]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carthaginian Period===
The Carthaginian army sent to conquer [[Selinunte]] in 409 BC landed and camped near the site of the later Lilybaeum. In 397&amp;nbsp;BC when the [[Phoenicians|Phoenician]] colony of [[Motya]] on the southwestern coast of Sicily was invaded and destroyed by the [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracusan]] tyrant [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius I]], the survivors founded a town on the mainland nearby, the site of modern-day Marsala, which they called by a [[Punic language|Punic]] name, recorded in Greek as ''Lilýbaion'' ({{lang|grc|Λιλύβαιον}}) and in Latin as ''{{lang|la|Lilybaeum}}''. It became a great city in the following two centuries under the Carthaginians as a trade centre for manufactured goods and their power base, and serving as a strategic port between Carthage and their territories in [[Sardinia]]. It was built with strong defensive walls&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merola|first=Pasquale|last2=Allegrini|first2=A|last3=Bajocco|first3=Sofia|date=2005-10-06|title=Hyperspectral MIVIS data to investigate the Lilybaeum (Marsala) Archaeological Park|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/252307096|journal=Proceedings of SPIE|volume=5983|pages=59830W|doi=10.1117/12.627629|series=Remote Sensing for Environmental Monitoring, GIS Applications, and Geology V}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the beginning and had three linked harbours.  Punic Lilybaion was never conquered although it was besieged several times e.g. by [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]] and the [[ancient Rome|Romans]]. The walls were ultimately over 10m high and 7m thick. They were strengthened for Pyrrhus' [[Siege of Lilybaeum (278 BC)|Siege of Lilybaeum]] in 279 BC by a second wall 10m from the first. The siege lasted 2 months before he withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, Ross (2007). For the glory of Rome:a history of warriors and warfare. MBI Publishing Company. {{ISBN|9781853677335}} p 66&lt;/ref&gt; It was the only city which Pyrrhus could not conquer during his campaign at Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;[https://topostext.org/place/378124ULil Lilybaeum (Sicily) ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[First Punic War]] began here when the [[Punic]] army landed at Lilybaion in 265–264&amp;nbsp;BC, then marched across Sicily to [[Messina]], where the [[Battle of Messana|opening clash]] of the war took place.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, Biblioteca Historica, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/23*.html#1 23.1.2]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 250 BC the Romans sent a huge naval expedition of up to 240 ships towards Lilybaeum, the Carthaginian headquarters. A massive Roman army of 4 legions under the two consuls was also sent.&lt;ref&gt;Rickard, J: Siege of Lilybaeum, 250-241 BC, http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/siege_lilybaeum.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Carthaginians also understood the importance of this port and put their whole force together to save the city including about 10,000 mercenaries (Celts and Greeks). The Carthaginians sailed 50 ships from Africa under the command of Hannibal to try to save the city by charging towards the centre of the harbour. The Romans did not attempt to stop the entry of the fleet because of their sudden appearance and unfavourable winds in a foreign port.

The Roman fleet was defeated at [[Drepana]] in 249 BC when attempting a surprise attack there, followed by the destruction of the rest of the fleet soon afterwards in a storm. This forced the Romans to settle in for a long siege.&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, John Francis (1996). The First Punic War: A Military History. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-2673-6}}. p 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Siege of Lilybaeum (250 BC)]] lasted for 9 years without Roman success. Carthage was able to reinforce and re-supply Lilybaeum during the war. Some of the Gallic mercenaries planned to betray the city but [[Alexon]], who had previously saved [[Agrigentum]] from similar treachery, foiled the plot by informing the Carthaginian commander Himilco.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, i. 43, ii. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

In 241 BC the city was given to the Romans as part of the peace treaty ending the First Punic War and then became one of the most important cities in Sicily.

===Roman Lilybaeum===
[[File:Roman baths Lilybaeum.jpg|thumb|250px|Roman baths Lilybaeum]]
[[File:Town houses, Lilybaeum.jpg|thumb|250px|Town houses, Lilybaeum]]

In 218 BC, in the [[Second Punic War]], the [[Battle of Lilybaeum]] was fought between the navies of Carthage and Rome when Carthage attempted a secret raid on the city to re-establish a base. Marcus Amellius, the praetor at Lilybaeum, was told about the impending raid and prepared his 20 ships which managed to defeat the 50 opposing quinqeremes.

In the [[Roman Republic|republican period]] the city was enriched with mansions and public buildings and dubbed ''splendidissima urbs'' by [[Marcus Tullius Cicero|Cicero]], who served as [[quaestor]] in the region between 76 and 75&amp;nbsp;BC. During the Civil Wars Lilybaeum was twice besieged, in 43 BC by [[Sextus Pompeius]] and 38 by [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]] during which the walls were further strengthened as shown by an inscription.

The city walls were abandoned in the 4th c. AD as shown by buildings erected over or beside the walls.

===Post-Roman Period===
The city was the seat of the [[Diocese of Lilybaeum]] from at least the early 5th century AD. Ravaged by [[Vandals]] during the 5th century AD, the town was annexed in the 6th century to [[Justinian]]'s [[Byzantine Empire]]. In this period the town was struck by dysentery, raided by pirates, and neglected by [[Constantinople]]. The arrival of Arabic [[Berbers]] at the nearby Granitola mount in the 8th century entailed the resumption of commerce and the start of the rebirth of the town. The town was renamed ''Marsa ʿAlī'' &quot;ʿAlī's harbour&quot; or maybe, ''Marsa ʿāliyy'', &quot;Big harbour&quot;, for the width of the ancient harbour, placed near Punta d'Alga. Another possible derivation is ''Marsa Allāh'', &quot;God's harbour&quot;. Another theory is that ''Marsala'' comes from ''mare salis'', &quot;salt pans by the sea&quot; from the presence of [[Salt evaporation pond|salt pans]] along the whole northern coast, although mention of this theory cannot be found in contemporary references and the installation of the bigger salt ponds on the group of islands composing the contemporary single island &quot;Isola Lunga&quot; was made just during the 19th century.

Since the end of the 11th century, the area has been conquered by [[Italo-Normans|Norman]], [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragonese]] troops. During this time, Marsala became wealthy, primarily through trade. However the blocking up of the harbour of Punta Alga, decreed by Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] so as to stop [[Saracen]] forays, brought an end to this period of prosperity.

The development of [[Marsala wine]] at the end of the 18th century, headed by English merchants settled in Sicily, considerably improved local trade. This triggered an economic expansion in Marsala, including the funding of infrastructure projects such as the current harbour of Margitello.

On 11 May 1860 [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] [[Expedition of the Thousand|landed at Marsala]], beginning the process of [[Italian unification]].

On 11 May 1943, in the lead-up to the [[World War II]] [[Allied invasion of Sicily]], an Allied bombardment of the town permanently damaged its [[Baroque]] centre and claimed many victims: &quot;Marsala Wiped Off the Map&quot; titled the New York Times on 13 May 1943.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/chat/3018713/posts The New York Times, New York, Thursday, 13 May 1943]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeology ==
[[File:Venus of Lilybaeum.jpg|thumb|200px|Venus of Lilybaeum]]
[[File:Mosaic from Domus of Boeo 2.jpg|thumb|250px|Mosaic floor: Domus of Boeo]]
[[File:Marsala ship 4.jpg|thumb|250px|Carthaginian ship (240 BC)]]

The archaeological area of Marsala has been investigated both through [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]] and [[Topography|topographic studies]]. [[Lilybaeum]], the ancient town, took up a rectangular area on Capo Boeo, a low and rocky [[promontory]] sloping gently down towards the sea. The urban layout of the town can be dated back to the 2nd century BC with modern-day ''Viale Vittorio Veneto'' the ''[[Decumanus Maximus]]'' and ''Viale Cesare Battisti'' the ''Cardo Maximus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=La topografia di Lilybaeum|last=Vento|first=Maurizio|publisher=|year=1999|isbn=|location=Italy|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the archaeological findings at Capo Boeo, Lilybaeum was rebuilt twice, in the 1st century BC and in the 3rd century AD. There is not enough evidence to associate the latter with the [[365 Crete earthquake]], even though literature and archaeological discoveries elsewhere show that other Sicilian towns, such as [[Selinunte]], ''were'' affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bottari|first=Carla|last2=Stiros|first2=Stathis C.|last3=Teramo|first3=Antonio|date=2009-02-06|title=Archaeological evidence for destructive earthquakes in Sicily between 400 B.C. and A.D. 600|journal=Geoarchaeology|language=en|volume=24|issue=2|pages=149|doi=10.1002/gea.20260|issn=0883-6353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several fragments of the city walls and floors and walls of public and private buildings are visible. Excavations in several places under the modern city have revealed rich mosaic floors in town houses.

The Baglio Anselmi Archaeological Museum houses an example of [[Carthaginian empire|Carthaginian]] ship possibly used during the [[Battle of the Aegates Islands]] (241 BC) found on the seabed off the coast of Marsala, as well as other ancient remains from the area, such as pottery, marble sculptures and mosaics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.regione.sicilia.it/beniculturali/dirbenicult/database/page_musei/pagina_musei_eng.asp?ID=85&amp;IdSito=88|title=Regione Siciliana Assessorato Beni Culturali|website=www.regione.sicilia.it|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many fine painted tombs and funerary monuments have been excavated showing unique preservation of colours.

The three entrance gates into the town dating from [[Norman Italy|Norman times]]: Porta Nuova, Porta di Mare and Porta Mazara were rebuilt in the 17th and 18th centuries in a much grander form: Porta Mazara, ({{Lang-en|&quot;Mazara Gate&quot;}}) rebuilt in 1572,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museomirabilesicilia.it/marsala/porta-mazara.html|title=Porta Mazara|last=Mirabile|first=Totò|website=www.museomirabilesicilia.it|language=it-it|access-date=2018-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; located in the south-east; Porta di Mare ({{Lang-en|&quot;Sea Gate&quot;}}) (renamed to Porta Garibaldi), rebuilt in 1685,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marsalaturismo.com/index.php?mn=1:141:0:0|title=Porta Garibaldi {{!}} Altri luoghi {{!}} Marsala Turismo - Portale turistico della Città di Marsala {{!}} Parole, immagini e atmosfere di una città senza tempo|last=S.r.l.|first=El-edrisi|website=Marsala Turismo - Portale turistico della Città di Marsala|language=en|access-date=2018-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; located in the south-west of the town; Porta Nuova ({{Lang-en|&quot;New Gate&quot;}}) was rebuilt in 1790,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museomirabilesicilia.it/marsala/porta-nuova.html|title=Porta Nuova|last=Mirabile|first=Totò|website=www.museomirabilesicilia.it|language=it-it|access-date=2018-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is located in the north-west of the town. The [[city council]] decided to [[demolish]] the city walls in 1887 to make way for the rapidly-expanding town. Along with this demolition was demolished the north-east gate called Porta Trapani, constructed in the early 17th century, nicknamed &quot;Porticella&quot; due to its small size in comparison to the other three gates of the town; it used to be located at the intersection of ''Via Pellegrino'' and ''Via Sardegna''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.amazing-world-in-free-stock-pictures-and-photos.com/marsala-top-tourist-attractions.html|title=Top Sites to See in Marsala {{!}} Visit Sicily|work=Amazing World in Pictures|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
The economy of Marsala still depends on the production of wine, although [[tourism]] is a growing industry and it too is becoming an important source of income for the city. With its {{convert|14|km|mi|adj=on}} coastline&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurocasa-marsala.it/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=53:prova&amp;catid=37:marsala&amp;Itemid=79|title=DESCRIZIONE DELLA CITTA ' // COME ARRIVARE A MARSALA|website=www.eurocasa-marsala.it|language=Italian|access-date=2019-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; of sandy beaches and clear sea, access to the nearby [[Aegadian Islands]] and the natural environment of the Saline Della Laguna and [[Stagnone Lagoon]], Marsala is an important Sicilian tourist destination.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

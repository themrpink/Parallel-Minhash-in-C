===Filter feeding===
{{Main|Filter feeder}}Antarctic krill directly ingest minute [[phytoplankton]] cells, which no other animal of krill size can do. This is accomplished through [[filter feeding]], using the krill's highly developed front legs which form an efficient filtering apparatus:&lt;ref name=&quot;Kils832&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=On the biology of krill ''Euphausia superba'' – Proceedings of the Seminar and Report of Krill Ecology Group|author=Uwe Kils|publisher=[[Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research]]|year=1983|editor=S.

In the finest areas the openings in this basket are only 1&amp;nbsp;μm in diameter. In lower food concentrations, the feeding basket is pushed through the water for over half a metre in an opened position, and then the algae are combed to the mouth opening with special [[setae]] (bristles) on the inner side of the thoracopods.[[File:Krillicekils.jpg|thumb|Antarctic krill feeding on [[ice algae]]. The surface of the ice on the left side is coloured green by the algae.]]

===Ice-algae raking===
Antarctic krill can scrape off the green lawn of [[ice-algae]] from the underside of [[pack ice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecoscope.com/icecave2.htm |title=Antarctic krill ''Euphausia superba'' in ice cave |publisher=Ecoscope.com |author1=Peter Marschall |author2=Uwe Kils }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mar88&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hans-Peter Marschall |title=The overwintering strategy of Antarctic krill under the pack ice of the Weddell Sea |journal=[[Polar Biology]] |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=129–135 |year=1988 |doi=10.1007/BF00442041}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krill have developed special rows of rake-like setae at the tips of their [[thoracopod]]s, and graze the ice in a zig-zag fashion. One krill can clear an area of a square foot in about 10&amp;nbsp;minutes (1.5&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s). Recent discoveries have found that the film of ice algae is well developed over vast areas, often containing much more carbon than the whole water column below. Krill find an extensive energy source here, especially in the spring after food sources have been limited during the winter months.

===Biological pump and carbon sequestration===
[[File:Krillspitballkils3.jpg|thumb|''In situ'' image taken with an [[ecoSCOPE]]. A green spit ball is visible in the lower right of the image and a green fecal string in the lower left.]]
Krill are thought to undergo between one and three vertical migrations from mixed surface waters to depths of 100m daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Geraint A. Tarling |author2=Magnus L. Johnson |title=Satiation gives krill that sinking feeling |journal=[[Current Biology]] |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=83–84 |year=2006 |pmid=16461267 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.01.044|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The krill is a very untidy feeder, and it often spits out aggregates of [[phytoplankton]] (spit balls) containing thousands of cells sticking together. It also produces fecal strings that still contain significant amounts of [[carbon]] and, [[glass]] shells of the [[diatom]]s. Both are heavy and sink very fast into the abyss. This process is called the [[biological pump]]. As the waters around [[Antarctica]] are very deep ({{convert|2000|-|4000|m|disp=or}}), they act as a [[carbon dioxide sink]]: this process exports large quantities of carbon (fixed [[carbon dioxide]], CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from the biosphere and [[Carbon Sequestration|sequesters]] it for about 1,000&amp;nbsp;years.
[[File:Wfm pelagic.png|thumb|378x378px|Layers of the Pelagic Zone which contains organisms that make up an ecosystem. Antarctic Krill  are part of this ecosystem.]]
If the phytoplankton is consumed by other components of the pelagic ecosystem, most of the carbon remains in the upper layers of the ocean. There is speculation that this process is one of the largest biofeedback mechanisms of the planet, maybe the most sizable of all, driven by a gigantic biomass. Still more research is needed to quantify the Southern Ocean ecosystem.

==Biology==

===Bioluminescence===
[[File:Bioluminescencekils.jpg|thumb|Watercolour of bioluminescent krill]]
Krill are often referred to as ''light-shrimp'' because they emit light through [[Bioluminescence|bioluminescent]] organs. These organs are located on various parts of the individual krill's body: one pair of organs at the [[eyestalk]] (cf. the image of the head above), another pair  are on the hips of the second and seventh [[thoracopod]]s, and singular organs on the four [[pleonsternite]]s. These light organs emit a yellow-green light periodically, for up to 2–3&amp;nbsp;s. They are considered so highly developed that they can be compared with a flashlight. There is a concave reflector in the back of the organ and a lens in the front that guide the light produced. The whole organ can be rotated by muscles, which can direct the light to a specific area. The function of these lights is not yet fully understood; some hypotheses have suggested they serve to compensate the krill's shadow so that they are not visible to predators from below; other speculations maintain that they play a significant role in [[mating]] or [[Shoaling and schooling|schooling]] at night.

The krill's bioluminescent organs contain several fluorescent substances. The major component has a maximum [[fluorescence]] at an excitation of 355&amp;nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]] and emission of 510&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=&quot;HS01&quot;&gt;{{cite conference |author1=H.

[[File:Caridoid escape reaction.gif|thumb|Lobstering krill]]

===Escape reaction===
Krill use an [[escape reaction]] to evade [[predator]]s, swimming backwards very quickly by flipping their rear ends. This swimming pattern is also known as [[Caridoid escape reaction|lobstering]]. Krill can reach speeds of over {{convert|0.6|m/s}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kils82&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Uwe Kils |url=http://www.ecoscope.com/biomass3.htm |title=Swimming behaviour, swimming performance and energy balance of Antarctic krill ''Euphausia superba'' |series=BIOMASS Scientific Series |volume=3 |pages=1–122 |year=1982 |isbn= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Induction period|trigger]] time to optical [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] is, despite the low temperatures, only 55&amp;nbsp;[[millisecond|ms]].

== Geographic distribution ==
[[File:krilldistribution.jpg|thumb|Krill distribution on a [[NASA]] [[SeaWIFS]] image&amp;nbsp;– the main concentrations are in the [[Scotia Sea]] at the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]]]
Antarctic krill has a circumpolar distribution, being found throughout the [[Southern Ocean]], and as far north as the [[Antarctic Convergence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MSIP&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=''Euphausia superba'' |website=Euphausiids of the World Ocean |publisher=Marine Species Identification Portal |accessdate=May 20, 2011 |url=http://species-identification.org/species.php?species_group=euphausiids&amp;id=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Antarctic Convergence, the cold Antarctic surface water submerges below the warmer [[subantarctic]] waters. This front runs roughly at [[55th parallel south|55° south]]; from there to the continent, the Southern Ocean covers 32 million square kilometres. This is 65 times the size of the [[North Sea]]. In the winter season, more than three-quarters of this area become covered by ice, whereas {{convert|24000000|km2}} become ice free in summer. The water temperature fluctuates at {{convert|-1.3|-|3|C|F}}.

The waters of the Southern Ocean form a system of currents. Whenever there is a [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current|West Wind Drift]], the surface strata travels around Antarctica in an easterly direction. Near the continent, the [[Antarctic Coastal Current|East Wind Drift]] runs counterclockwise. At the front between both, large [[eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]] develop, for example, in the [[Weddell Sea]]. The krill swarms swim with these water masses, to establish one single stock all around Antarctica, with gene exchange over the whole area. Currently, there is little knowledge of the precise migration patterns since individual krill cannot yet be tagged to track their movements. The largest shoals are visible from space and can be tracked by satellite.&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, Ben (2009). Animal Migration. London: Natural History Museum. p. 107. {{ISBN|978-0-565-09243-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One swarm covered an area of {{convert|450|km2|mi2|abbr=off|sp=us}} of ocean, to a depth of {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} and was estimated to contain over 2 million tons of krill.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoare, Ben 2009 p. 107&quot;&gt;Hoare, Ben (2009). Animal Migration. London: Natural History Museum. p. 107. {{ISBN|978-0-565-09243-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research suggests that krill do not simply drift passively in these currents but actually modify them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoare, Ben 2009 p. 107&quot;/&gt; By moving vertically through the ocean on a 12-hour cycle, the swarms play a major part in mixing deeper, nutrient-rich water with nutrient-poor water at the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoare, Ben 2009 p. 107&quot;/&gt;

==Ecology==
Antarctic krill is the [[keystone species]] of the [[Antarctic]] ecosystem beyond the coastal shelf,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Guido di Prisco |editor2=Cinzia Verde |series=Adaptation and Evolution in Marine Environments |volume=1 |title=The Impacts of Global Change on Biodiversity |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2012 |isbn=9783642273513 |chapter=Sea-ice interactions with polar fish: focus on the Antarctic silverfish life history |author=Mario Vacchi |author2=Philippe Koubbi |author3=Laura Ghigliotti |author4=Eva Pisano |pages=51–73&lt;!-- at p. 63 --&gt; |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-27352-0_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provides an important food source for [[whale]]s, [[Seal (mammal)|seals]], [[leopard seal]]s, [[fur seal]]s, [[crabeater seal]]s, [[squid]], [[Notothenioidei|icefish]], [[penguin]]s, [[albatross]]es and many other species of [[bird]]s. Crabeater seals have even developed special teeth as an adaptation to catch this abundant food source: its unusual multilobed teeth enable this species to sieve krill from the water. Its dentition looks like a perfect strainer, but how it operates in detail is still unknown. Crabeaters are the most abundant seal in the world; 98% of their diet is made up of '' E. superba''. These seals consume over 63 million [[tonne]]s of krill each year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bon95&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=B. Bonner |chapter=Birds and Mammals – Antarctic Seals |pages=[https://archive.org/details/antarctica00bonn/page/202 202–222] |editor=R.

All seals consume 63–130 million tonnes, all whales 34–43 million tonnes, birds 15–20 million tonnes, squid 30–100 million tonnes, and fish 10–20 million tonnes, adding up to 152–313 million tonnes of krill consumption each year.&lt;ref name=&quot;MH89&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=D. G. M. Miller |author2=I. Hampton |year=1989 |title=Biology and ecology of the Antarctic krill (''Euphausia superba'' Dana): a review |series=BIOMASS Scientific Series |volume=9 |pages=1–66 |isbn=978-0-948277-09-2 |publisher=[[Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The size step between krill and its prey is unusually large: generally it takes three or four steps from the 20&amp;nbsp;μm small [[phytoplankton]] cells to a krill-sized organism (via small [[copepod]]s, large copepods, [[mysid]]s to 5&amp;nbsp;cm [[fish]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;KK79&quot;/&gt; ''E. superba'' lives only in the Southern Ocean. In the North Atlantic, ''[[Meganyctiphanes norvegica]]'' and in the Pacific, ''[[Euphausia pacifica]]'' are the dominant species.

===Biomass and production===
The [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] of Antarctic krill was estimated in 2009 to be 0.05 gigatons of carbon (Gt C), similar to the total biomass of Humans (0.06 Gt C).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bar-On|first=Yinon M.|last2=Phillips|first2=Rob|last3=Milo|first3=Ron|date=2018-05-21|title=The biomass distribution on Earth|url=https://www.pnas.org/content/115/25/6506|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=115|issue=25|pages=6506–6511|doi=10.1073/pnas.1711842115|issn=0027-8424|doi-access=free|pmid=29784790|pmc=6016768}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason Antarctic krill are able to build up such a high biomass and production is that the waters around the icy Antarctic continent harbour one of the largest [[plankton]] assemblages in the world, possibly ''the'' largest. The ocean is filled with [[phytoplankton]]; as the water rises from the depths to the light-flooded surface, it brings [[nutrient]]s from all of the world's oceans back into the [[photic zone]] where they are once again available to living organisms.

Thus [[primary production]]—the conversion of sunlight into organic biomass, the foundation of the food chain—has an annual carbon fixation of 1–2&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the open ocean. Close to the ice it can reach 30–50&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. These values are not outstandingly high, compared to very productive areas like the [[North Sea]] or [[upwelling]] regions, but the area over which it takes place is enormous, even compared to other large primary producers such as [[rainforest]]s. In addition, during the Austral summer there are many hours of daylight to fuel the process. All of these factors make the plankton and the krill a critical part of the planet's ecocycle.

===Decline with shrinking pack ice===

A possible decline in Antarctic krill biomass may have been caused by the reduction of the [[pack ice]] zone due to [[global warming]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gr05&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Liza Gross |year=2005 |title=As the Antarctic ice pack recedes, a fragile ecosystem hangs in the balance |journal=[[PLoS Biology]] |volume=3 |issue=4 |page=e127 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030127 |pmid=15819605 |pmc=1074811}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antarctic krill, especially in the early stages of development, seem to need the pack ice structures in order to have a fair chance of survival.

===Ocean acidification===
Another challenge for Antarctic krill, as well as many calcifying organisms (corals, bivalve mussels, snails etc.), is the [[Ocean acidification|acidification of the oceans]] caused by increasing levels of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACECRC&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre |title=Position analysis: CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and climate change: OCEAN impacts and adaptation issues |issn=1835-7911 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krill exoskeleton contains carbonate, which is susceptible to dissolution under low [[pH]] conditions.

The fishery of Antarctic krill is on the order of 100,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes per year. The major catching nations are [[South Korea]], [[Norway]], [[Japan]] and [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/e/e_pubs/sb/sb-vol20.pdf CCAMLR Statistical Bulletin vol. 20 (1998-2007)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225124314/http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/e/e_pubs/sb/sb-vol20.pdf |date=February 25, 2009 }}, CCAMLR, Hobart, Australia, 2008. URL last accessed July 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The products are used as animal food and fish bait. Krill fisheries are difficult to operate in two important respects. First, a krill net needs to have very fine meshes, producing a very high [[Drag (physics)|drag]], which generates a [[bow wave]] that deflects the krill to the sides. Second, fine meshes tend to clog very fast.

Yet another problem is bringing the krill catch on board. When the full net is hauled out of the water, the organisms compress each other, resulting in great loss of the krill's liquids. Experiments have been carried out to pump krill, while still in water, through a large tube on board. Special krill nets also are currently under development. The processing of the krill must be very rapid since the catch deteriorates within several hours. Its high protein and vitamin content makes krill quite suitable for both direct human consumption and the animal-feed industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;E+00&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Inigo Everson |author2=David J.

==Future visions and ocean engineering==
{{Main|Iron fertilization}}
Despite the lack of knowledge available about the whole Antarctic ecosystem, large scale experiments involving krill are already being performed to increase [[carbon sequestration]]: in vast areas of the Southern Ocean there are plenty of nutrients, but still, the phytoplankton does not grow much. These areas are termed [[HNLC]] (high nutrient, low chlorophyll). The phenomenon is called the [[Antarctic Paradox]], and occurs because [[iron]] is missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palomar.edu/oceanography/iron.htm |title=The Iron Hypothesis |author=Caroline Dopyera |date=October 1996 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306011126/http://www.palomar.edu/oceanography/iron.htm |archivedate=2005-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Relatively small injections of iron from research vessels trigger very large blooms, covering many miles. The hope is that such large scale exercises will draw down [[carbon dioxide]] as compensation for the burning of [[fossil fuel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Climate Engineering.

In [[linear algebra]], the '''trace''' of a [[square matrix]] {{math|'''A'''}}, denoted &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr}(\mathbf{A})&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-03-25|title=Comprehensive List of Algebra Symbols|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/algebra-symbols/|access-date=2020-09-09|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Rank, trace, determinant, transpose, and inverse of matrices|url=http://fourier.eng.hmc.edu/e161/lectures/algebra/node2.html|access-date=2020-09-09|website=fourier.eng.hmc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; is defined to be the sum of elements on the [[main diagonal]] (from the upper left to the lower right) of {{math|'''A'''}}.

The trace of a matrix is the sum of its (complex) [[eigenvalue]]s, and it is [[Invariants of tensors|invariant]] with respect to a [[change of basis]]. This characterization can be used to define the trace of a linear operator in general. The trace is only defined for a square matrix ({{math|''n'' × ''n''}}).

The trace is related to the derivative of the [[determinant]] (see [[Jacobi's formula]]).

== Definition ==
The '''trace''' of an {{math|''n'' × ''n''}} [[square matrix]] {{math|'''A'''}} is defined as&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|title=Matrix Trace|url=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MatrixTrace.html|access-date=2020-09-09|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LipschutzLipson&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Schaum's Outline of Theory and Problems of Linear Algebra |first1=Seymour |last1=Lipschutz |first2=Marc |last2=Lipson |isbn=9780070605022 |publisher=McGraw-Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}}

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr}(\mathbf{A}) = \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ii} = a_{11} + a_{22} + \dots + a_{nn}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt;''}} denotes the entry on the {{mvar|i}}th row and {{mvar|i}}th column of {{math|'''A'''}}.

== Example ==
Let {{math|'''A'''}} be a matrix, with

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13} \\
    a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23} \\
    a_{31} &amp; a_{32} &amp; a_{33}
  \end{pmatrix} =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    -1 &amp;  0 &amp;  3 \\
    11 &amp;  5 &amp;  2 \\
     6 &amp; 12 &amp; -5
  \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Then
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr}(\mathbf{A}) = \sum_{i=1}^{3} a_{ii} = a_{11} + a_{22} + a_{33} = -1 + 5 + (-5) = -1&lt;/math&gt;

== Properties ==

=== Basic properties ===
The trace is a [[linear operator|linear mapping]]. That is,&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \operatorname{tr}(\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}) &amp;= \operatorname{tr}(\mathbf{A}) + \operatorname{tr}(\mathbf{B}) \\
     \operatorname{tr}(c\mathbf{A}) &amp;= c \operatorname{tr}(\mathbf{A})\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

for all square matrices {{math|'''A'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}}, and all [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]s {{mvar|c}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;LipschutzLipson&quot;/&gt;{{rp|34}}

A matrix and its [[transpose]] have the same trace:&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LipschutzLipson&quot;/&gt;{{rp|34}}

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr}(\mathbf{A}) = \operatorname{tr}\left(\mathbf{A}^\mathsf{T}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

This follows immediately from the fact that transposing a square matrix does not affect elements along the main diagonal.

=== Trace of a product ===
The trace of a square matrix which is the product of two matrices can be rewritten as the sum of entry-wise products of their elements. More precisely, if {{math|'''A'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} are two ''m''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''n'' matrices, then:

:&lt;math&gt;
  \operatorname{tr}\left(\mathbf{A}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{B}\right) =
  \operatorname{tr}\left(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}^\mathsf{T}\right) =
  \operatorname{tr}\left(\mathbf{B}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{A}\right) =
  \operatorname{tr}\left(\mathbf{B}\mathbf{A}^\mathsf{T}\right) =
  \sum_{i,j}a_{ij}b_{ij}.
&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the trace of a product of equal-sized matrices functions in a similar way to a [[dot product]] of vectors (imagine {{math|'''A'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} as long vectors with columns stacked on each other). For this reason, generalizations of vector operations to matrices (e.g. in [[matrix calculus]] and [[statistics]]) often involve a trace of matrix products.

For real matrices {{math|'''A'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}}, the trace of a product can also be written in the following forms:

: {| cellpadding=0
| &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr}\left(\mathbf{A}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{B}\right) = \sum_{i,j}(\mathbf{A} \circ \mathbf{B})_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;padding-left:3em;&quot; | (using the [[Hadamard product (matrices)|Hadamard product]], also known as the entrywise product).
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr}\left(\mathbf{A}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{B}\right) = \operatorname{vec}(\mathbf{B})^\mathsf{T} \operatorname{vec}(\mathbf{A}) = \operatorname{vec}(\mathbf{A})^\mathsf{T}\operatorname{vec}(\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;padding-left:3em;&quot; | (using the [[vectorization (mathematics)|vectorization]] operator).
|}

The matrices in a trace of a product can be switched without changing the result: If {{math|'''A'''}} is an {{math|''m'' × ''n''}} matrix and {{math|'''B'''}} is an {{math|''n'' × ''m''}} matrix, then&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LipschutzLipson&quot;/&gt;{{rp|34}}&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;This is immediate from the definition of the [[matrix product]]:
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr}(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}) = \sum_{i=1}^m \left(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}\right)_{ii} = \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} b_{ji} = \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{i=1}^m b_{ji} a_{ij} = \sum_{j=1}^n \left(\mathbf{B}\mathbf{A}\right)_{jj} = \operatorname{tr}(\mathbf{B}\mathbf{A})&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Equation box 1

|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA
}}

Additionally, for real column matrices &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\in\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}\in\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, the trace of the outer product is equivalent to the inner product:
{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title=
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr}\left(\mathbf{b}\mathbf{a}^\textsf{T}\right) = \mathbf{a}^\textsf{T}\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA
}}

=== Cyclic property ===
More generally, the trace is ''invariant under [[cyclic permutation]]s'', that is,

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title=
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr}(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}\mathbf{C}\mathbf{D}) = \operatorname{tr}(\mathbf{B}\mathbf{C}\mathbf{D}\mathbf{A}) = \operatorname{tr}(\mathbf{C}\mathbf{D}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}) = \operatorname{tr}(\mathbf{D}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}\mathbf{C}).&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

This is known as the ''cyclic property''.

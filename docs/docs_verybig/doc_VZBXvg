      <text bytes="3293" xml:space="preserve">'''Duncan Campbell''' was a [[Scotland|Scots]] nobleman who died on 18 July 1758 as a result of wounds received in an [[Battle of Carillon|unsuccessful frontal attack]] against French forces at Fort Carillon (renamed [[Fort Ticonderoga]] when the British took the fort a year later).  The legend associated with Campbell is that a number of years prior—while still living in Scotland—Campbell gave shelter to a stranger who turned out to have killed Duncan's cousin.  Faced with the conflict between betraying a guest or taking vengeance for the death of his cousin, Campbell compromised by allowing the killer to hide out in a cave.  The ghost of Campbell's cousin is claimed to have appeared to Campbell in a dream and promised to meet him again at ''Ticonderoga'', a place that Duncan surely had never heard of previously. This story was published in the poem &quot;Ticonderoga a Legend of the West Highlands&quot; by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] in ''Scribner's Magazine'' December 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://greensleeves.typepad.com/berkshires/2008/01/the-pipers-refr.html |date=January 30, 2008 |title=The Piper's Refrain: &quot;Farewell, Inverawe&quot; |work=Walking the Berkshires |first=Tim |last=Abbott}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smokedsalmon.co.uk/publish.asp?what=info_ghost&amp;page=1 |work=Inverawe Ghost Stories |title=The Ghost of Ticonderoga |publisher=Inverawe Smokehouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Campbell's [[42nd Regiment of Foot]] Highlanders took many casualties in the ill-fated attack on Fort Carillon.  Legend has it that the battle was replicated in the clouds over [[Inveraray Castle]] in Scotland on the afternoon of the attack.  The story of the ghostly prediction and the apparition in the clouds over Inverawe has been repeated a number of times in magazines, song, and used several times in television scripts.
His remains are interred at the Union Cemetery in Fort Edward, NY alongside Jane McCrea and her cousin Sara McNeil.
==Songs==
Inspired by the history and legend, [[Rich Nardin]] wrote (circa 1980) the song &quot;Piper's Refrain&quot;, about the end of Campbell's story.  The song was first released on Nardin's 1983 album, and has been recorded by multiple artists since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mudcat.org/detail.cfm?messages__Message_ID=2387939 |title=Correction: The Piper's Refrain |first=Rich |last=Nardin |date=13 July 2008 |publisher=Mudcat Café}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The song is in the folk tradition and may be thought by some to be a traditional ballad when song by others.  The story further inspired [[Margaret MacArthur]] to write &quot;The Legend of Duncan Campbell&quot; as an accompanying song which explores the beginning of the tale in Scotland.

'''Pope Paul I''' ({{lang-la|Paulus I}}; 700{{snd}}28 June 767) was the [[bishop of Rome]] and ruler of the emerging [[Papal States]] from 29 May 757 to his death. He first served as a [[Rome|Roman]] [[deacon]] and was frequently employed by his brother, [[Pope Stephen II]], in negotiations with the [[Lombard kings]].

==Rise==
Paul was a native of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/cyclopaediaofbib07mccl|page=[https://archive.org/details/cyclopaediaofbib07mccl/page/n848 831]|quote=Pope Paul I.|title=Cyclopaedia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature|volume=VII|first1=John|last1=McClintock|first2=James|last2=Strong|date=April 15, 1882|publisher=Harper|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his brother [[Pope Stephen II|Stephen]] had been educated for the priesthood at the [[Lateran Palace]]. Stephen became [[pope]] in 752. After Stephen's death on 26 April 757, Paul prevailed over a faction that wanted to make [[Archdeacon Theophylact]] pope and was [[papal selection before 1059|chosen]] to succeed his brother by the majority that wished a continuation of Stephen's policy.

==Pontificate==
[[File:SCeau Paul I pape 17109 (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|Seal of Paul I]]
Paul I's reign was dominated by relations with the [[Frankish kings|Frankish]] and [[Lombard kings]] and with the [[Eastern Roman emperor]].  He adopted an independent tone in informing the imperial [[exarch in Ravenna]] of his election, but wrote to [[Pepin the Younger]] that the Frankish alliance should be maintained unimpaired. Paul was likely concerned of the danger posed by the Lombard king [[Desiderius]]. The Lombards held the cities of [[Imola]], [[Osimo]], [[Bologna]], and [[Ancona]], which were claimed by the [[papacy]], and in 758 seized upon the duchies of [[duchy of Spoleto|Spoleto]] and [[duchy of Benevento|Benevento]]. On his return from suppressing a revolt in Benevento, Desiderius visited Rome and compelled Paul to write to Pepin asking him to concede all the Lombard claims. He promised to return Imola, but on condition that the pope should persuade Pepin to send back Lombard hostages held by the Franks. Paul agreed and sent a letter to Pepin. In a second secret letter, Paul advised Pepin of the agreement of Desiderius with the Byzantines for the conquest of [[Ravenna]], and implored Pepin to come to the aid of the pope, and to force the Lombard king to yield the towns retained by him.&lt;ref name=kirsch&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11577a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Pope Paul I|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pepin found it advisable to maintain good relations with Desiderius, and Paul apparently accomplished little by his double-dealing. Later, however, Pepin gave the pope some support and acted as arbiter between the Roman and Lombard claims.

In 765, papal privileges were restored in the duchies of Benevento and [[Tuscia|Tuscany]] and partially in Spoleto. Meanwhile, the alienation from [[Eastern Roman Empire]] grew greater. Several times, especially in 759, Paul feared that the emperor would send an armament against Rome. Paul lived in continual dread lest Eastern Roman ambitions turn the Frankish influence in favor of the Lombards. This was actually attempted, but Pepin held to his original foreign policy regarding Italy.

Paul died in Rome on 28 June 767.&lt;ref name=kirsch/&gt;

'''Arion''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|r|aɪ|ə|n}}; {{lang-grc-gre|[[wikt:Ἀρίων|Ἀρίων]]}}) was a [[kitharode]] in [[ancient Greece]], a [[Dionysus|Dionysiac]] [[poet]] credited with inventing the [[dithyramb]]: &quot;As a literary composition for chorus dithyramb was the creation of Arion of Corinth,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pickard-Cambridge, Sir Arthur Wallace. 1927. ''Dithyramb Tragedy and Comedy''. Second edition revised by T.B.L. Webster, 1962. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-19-814227-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The islanders of [[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]] claimed him as their native son, but Arion found a patron in [[Periander]], [[tyrant]] of [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]]. Although notable for his musical inventions, Arion is chiefly remembered for the fantastic [[myth]] of his kidnapping by pirates and miraculous rescue by [[dolphin]]s, a [[folklore|folktale]] motif.&lt;ref&gt;The dolphin's love of music and of humans was proverbial among Greeks ([[Euripides]], ''[[Electra (Euripides)|Electra]]'' 435f; for the folktale motif, see [[Stith Thompson]], ''Motif Index of Folk Literature'' (Bloomington IN) 1955-58) ''s.v.'' B300-B349, and B473, B767.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herodotus (1.23) says &quot;Arion was second to none of the lyre-players in his time and was also the first man we know of to compose and name the [[dithyramb]] and teach it in Corinth&quot;. However J.H. Sleeman observes of the dithyramb, or circular chorus, &quot;It is first mentioned by [[Archilochus]] (c 665 BC) … Arion flourished at least 50 years later … probably gave it a more artistic form, adding a chorus of 50 people, personating satyrs… who danced around an altar of Dionysus. He was doubtless the first to introduce the dithyramb into Corinth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Sleeman, ed. ''Herodotus Book I''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Armand D'Angour]] notes that Arion's contribution to the reform of the dithyramb, which was eventually performed in a circle and called ''kuklios choros'', was recognised by ancient sources by the fact that they named his father 'Kukleus' ('Circle-man').&lt;ref&gt;'How the Dithyramb got its shape'. ''Classical Quarterly'' 46.2 (1997) 331-351.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arion is also associated with the origins of tragedy: of [[Solon]] John the Deacon reports: “Arion of Methymna first introduced the drama [i.e. action] of tragedy, as Solon indicated in his poem entitled ''Elegies''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Solon, Fragment 30a W, noted in Eric Csapo and Margaret Christina Miller, ''The Origins of Theater in Ancient Greece and beyond: from ritual to drama'', 2007 &quot;Pre-Aristotelian fragments&quot;, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kidnapping by pirates==
[[File:Boucher, François, Arion on the Dolphin, 1748.jpg|thumb|left|[[François Boucher]], ''Arion on the Dolphin'', 1748, [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]

According to [[Herodotus]]' account of the [[Lydia]]n empire under the [[List of kings of Lydia#Mermnadae|Mermnads]],&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''Histories'' I.23-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Arion attended a [[music]]al competition in [[Sicily]], which he won. On his return trip from [[Taranto|Tarentum]], whose [[Taras (mythology)| onomastic founder]] has a similar story, avaricious sailors plotted to kill Arion and steal the rich prizes he carried home. Arion was given the choice of [[suicide]] with a proper burial on land, or being thrown in the sea to perish. Neither prospect appealed to Arion: as [[Robin Lane Fox]] observes, &quot;No Greek would swim out into the deep from a boat for pleasure.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fox, ''Travelling Heroes in the Epic Age of Homer'', 2008:170.&lt;/ref&gt; He asked for permission to sing a last song to win time.

Playing his [[kithara]], Arion sang a praise to [[Apollo]], the god of poetry, and his song attracted a number of [[Dolphins in mythology|dolphins]] around the ship.  Some argue that the Dolphins were sent by Apollo to rescue Arion.&lt;ref&gt;Reading Herodotus: A Guided Tour Through the Wild Boars, Dancing Suitors (Debra Hamel), Dolphins (Jason Skog)&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the song, Arion threw himself into the sea rather than be killed, but one of the dolphins saved his life and carried him to safety at the sanctuary of [[Poseidon]] at [[Cape Matapan|Cape Tainaron]]. When he reached land, being eager for his journey, he failed to return the dolphin to the sea and it perished there. He told his misfortunes to [[Periander]], the Tyrant of Corinth, who ordered the dolphin to be buried, and monument raised to it. Shortly after, word came to Periander that the ship on which Arion had sailed had been brought to Corinth by a storm. He ordered the crew to be led before him, and inquired about Arion, but they replied that he had died and that they had buried him. The tyrant replied: &quot;Tomorrow you will swear to that at the Dolphin's monument.&quot; Because of this he ordered them to be kept under guard, and instructed Arion to hide in the monument of the dolphin the next morning, attired as he was when he threw himself into the sea. When the tyrant had brought them there, and ordered them to swear by the departed spirit of the dolphin that Arion was dead, Arion came out of the monument. In amazement, wondering by what divinity he had been saved, they were silent. The tyrant ordered them to be [[Crucifixion|crucified]] at the monument of the dolphin. Apollo, because of Arion's skill with the kithara, placed him and the dolphin among the stars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'', 194&lt;/ref&gt; This dolphin was [[Catasterism|catasterised]] as the constellation [[Delphinus]], by the blessing of Apollo.

The story as Herodotus tells it was taken up in other literature.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Aulus Gellius]], ''Noctes Atticae'' XVI.19; [[Plutarch]], ''Conv. sept. sap.'' 160-62; see William Roberts, &quot;Classical sources of [[Antoine Girard de Saint-Amant|Saint-Amant]]'s 'L'Arion'&quot;, ''French Studies'' '''17'''.4 (1963:341-350).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucian|Lucian of Samosata]] wittily imagined the dialogue between Poseidon and the very dolphin who bore Arion.&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Dialogi Marini'' 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo]]&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'', i.14.&lt;/ref&gt; asserted that pagans &quot;believed in what they read in their own books&quot; and took Arion to be a historical individual. &quot;There is no historicity in this tale&quot;, also according to Eunice Burr Stebbins,&lt;ref&gt;Stebbins, ''The Dolphin in the Literature and Art of Greece and Rome'', 1929:67.&lt;/ref&gt; and Arion and the dolphins are given as an example of &quot;a folkloristic motif especially associated with Apollo&quot; by Irad Malkin.&lt;ref&gt;Malkin, ''Religion and Colonization in Ancient Greece'', 1987:219.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erasmus]] instanced Arion as one of the traditional poet's topics that sound like ''historia'' rather than ''fabulae'', though he misremembered that Augustine had taken the Arion story to be historical.&lt;ref&gt;Erasmus, ''divus Augustinus historiam estimat'', quoted by Peter G. Bietenholz, ''Historia and Fabula: myths and legends in historical thought from antiquity to the Modern Age'' 1994:155.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
From what is told in ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] scripts, Arion, although favored by [[Apollo]], is the son of [[Poseidon]] and [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]].

===Mythological parallels===
The episode may be seen as a doublet of the fate of [[Melicertes]], where the leap into the sea was that of his mother, Ino. transformed into the &quot;white goddess&quot; [[Leucothea]]; Melicertes was carried more dead than alive to the shores where the [[Isthmian Games]] were celebrated in his honour, as he was transformed to the hero Palaimon, who was placated with a nocturnal chthonic rite, and the whose winners were crowned with a barren wreath of spruce.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert 1983:198f. &quot;To [[Plutarch]] this seemed more a mystery initiation (τελετή) than an athletic and folk festival&quot; (p 197).&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar story of told of the founding of [[Taranto|Taras]] in Megale Hellas ([[Magna Graecia]]), modern Taranto, Apulia, Italy. When a son of Poseidon called Taras was shipwrecked, his father rescued him by sending a dolphin which he rode to traverse the sea from the promontory of Taenarum to the south of Italy. Brought ashore, Taras founded the city of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newworldtreasures.com/dolphin.htm|title=Boy On A Dolphin Ancient Greek Coin Jewelry|website=Newworldtreasures.com|accessdate=26 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], he was worshiped as a hero who named both the city and the river, Taras after himself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' 10. 10. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Another parallel is the myth of Dionysus and the sailors, related in the [[Homeric Hymns]]: Tyrrhenian pirates try to lash the god to the mast, but the wood itself starts to sprout and the mast is entwined with ivy (like the god's [[thyrsus]]); the sailors leap into the sea and are transformed into dolphins.  This is especially interesting because Arion is credited with the invention of the [[dithyramb]], a dionysiac song.

[[File:Flute-player_dolphin_Alcesti_Group_MAN.jpg|thumb|A musician riding a dolphin, on a Red-figure stamnos, 360–340 BC. From Etruria. In this case the musician is a aulete rather than a kitharode, as he is playing the flute ([[aulos]]) rather than a kithara.]]

===Scholarly interpretations===
In light of the above parallels, [[Walter Burkert]] interprets the story as a significant development in the history of Dionysiac cult: &quot;Released from this gloomy background, the cheerful and liberating legend of the sixth century further developed the image of the dolphin-rider under the colors of the renewed cult of Dionysus.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert 1983:198f&lt;/ref&gt; [[C. M. Bowra]]&lt;ref&gt;Bowra, &quot;Arion and the dolphin&quot;, ''MR'' '''20''' (1963:121-34, reprinted in Bowra, ''On Greek Margins'' (1970:164-81).&lt;/ref&gt; tied the myth to the period following the expulsion from Corinth of the aristocratic [[Bacchiadae]], who traced their descent from Dionysus: &quot;the cult of the god had to develop new and more democratic forms.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Burkert 1983:201)&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart Flory&lt;ref&gt;Stewart Flory, &quot;Arion's Leap: Brave Gestures in Herodotus&quot; ''The American Journal of Philology'' '''99'''.4 (Winter 1978:411-421).&lt;/ref&gt; identified Herodotus' characteristic use of the episode in a historicising context as an example of what Flory calls his &quot;brave gestures&quot;, a man faced with death performs with calm dignity some spirited but unnecessary gesture that demonstrates contempt for danger.

==In Literature==

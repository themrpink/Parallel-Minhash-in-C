====Consolidation and expansion====
{{More citations needed section|date=July 2010}}
[[File:Dome of the Rock1.jpg|thumb|The [[Dome of the Rock]] in Jerusalem]]

The second major event of the early reign of Abd al-Malik was the construction of the [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]]. Although the chronology remains somewhat uncertain, the building seems to have been completed in 692, which means that it was under construction during the conflict with Ibn al-Zubayr. This had led some historians, both medieval and modern, to suggest that the Dome of the Rock was built as a destination for pilgrimage to rival the Kaaba, which was under the control of Ibn al-Zubayr.

Abd al-Malik is credited with centralizing the administration of the Caliphate and with establishing [[Arabic]] as its official language. He also introduced a uniquely Muslim coinage, marked by its [[aniconic]] decoration, which supplanted the Byzantine and [[Sasanian]] coins that had previously been in use. Abd al-Malik also recommenced offensive warfare against Byzantium, defeating the Byzantines at [[Battle of Sebastopolis|Sebastopolis]] and recovering control over [[Armenia]] and [[Principality of Iberia|Caucasian Iberia]].

Caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abdul Malik]] also acquired many new lands under his reign. In the year 700 he sent an expedition to [[East Africa]] to add Mogadishu (located in present-day [[Somalia]]) to the caliphate. The Muslim army was led by General Musa ibn Umar al-Khath'ami, the Syrian who not only expanded into [[Mogadishu]] and its environs, but also Swahili island [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]]. The objectives given to Musa ibn Umar were identical to those given to other Muslim commanders, to teach the Quran, secure the taxation or tribute, to protect and safeguard the security of the country and to affirm its loyalty to the capital of the Umayyads in Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Ali Jimale|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpdAzRYruCwC&amp;q=caliphate+mogadishu&amp;pg=PA4|title=The Invention of Somalia|date=1995|publisher=The Red Sea Press|isbn=978-0-932415-99-8|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mukhtar|first=Mohamed Haji|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DPwOsOcNy5YC&amp;q=700%20mogadishu%20marwan%20umayyad&amp;pg=PR26|title=Historical Dictionary of Somalia|date=2003-02-25|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6604-1|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Abd al-Malik's death, his son, [[Al-Walid I]] (705–715), became caliph. Al-Walid was also active as a builder, sponsoring the construction of [[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi]] in Medina and the [[Umayyad Mosque|Great Mosque]] of Damascus.

During the reign of al-Walid, the Umayyads conquered nearly the entirety of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (except for the northernmost Christian kingdom of [[Asturias]]) under the military leadership of [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]] (whose name gives rise to '[[Gibraltar]]' – ''Jabal Tariq'', or 'Mountain of Tariq') and [[Musa ibn Nusayr]] from 711 to 716 CE, decimating the preceding [[Visigothic Kingdom]] of Spain. In the year 712, [[Muhammad bin Qasim]], an Umayyad general, sailed from the Persian Gulf into [[Sindh]] and conquered both Sindh and the lower Punjab (corresponding to [[Multan]]), both regions in northwestern India straddling the course of the [[Indus River]]. The conquest of Sindh and Punjab, in modern-day [[Pakistan]], although costly, were major gains for the Umayyad Caliphate, yielding roughly 60&amp;nbsp;million dirhams according to the Arab historian al-Baladhuri (not including the taxes, levies and duties imposed on the rich trading outposts of Sindh on the Indian Ocean routes).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Banaji|first=J.|title=Chapter Nine.

The conquests of Transoxiana, Sindh and [[Hispania]] accrued a massive amount of war spoils for the Caliphate, akin in value to the total value of the conquests achieved by the Rashidun caliph [[Umar|Umar ibn al-Khattab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Blankinship|first1=Khalid Yahya|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jz0Yy053WS4C|title=The End of the Jihad State: The Reign of Hisham Ibn 'Abd al-Malik and the Collapse of the Umayyads|last2=Blankinship|first2=Khalid 'A|date=1994-01-01|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-1827-7|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this point, the Caliphate stretched from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the Indus River.

A major figure during the reigns of both al-Walid and Abd al-Malik was the Umayyad governor of Iraq, [[Al-Hajjaj bin Yousef]]. Many Iraqis remained resistant to Umayyad rule, and to maintain order al-Hajjaj imported Syrian troops, which he housed in a new garrison town, Wasit. These troops became crucial in the suppression of a revolt led by an Iraqi general, [[Ibn al-Ash'ath]], in the early eighth century.

Al-Walid was succeeded by his brother, [[Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik|Sulayman]] (715–717), whose reign was dominated by a [[Siege of Constantinople (717–718)|protracted siege]] of Constantinople. The failure of the siege marked the end of serious Arab ambitions against the Byzantine capital. However, the first two decades of the eighth century witnessed the continuing expansion of the Caliphate, which pushed into the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the west, and into [[Transoxiana]] in the [[Muslim conquest of Transoxiana]] (under [[Qutayba ibn Muslim]]) and northern [[Indian subcontinent|India]] in the east.

In AD 715, the Umayyad Caliphate deposed the [[ikhshid]] of the [[Principality of Farghana]], and installed a new king Alutar on the throne. The deposed king fled to [[Kucha]] (seat of [[Anxi Protectorate]]), and sought Chinese intervention. The [[Tang dynasty]] sent 10,000 troops under Zhang Xiaosong to [[Ferghana]]. He defeated Alutar and the Arab occupation force at [[Namangan]] and reinstalled the ikhshid on the throne.&lt;ref name=&quot;bai&quot;&gt;*[[Bai Shouyi|Bai, Shouyi]] et al. (2003).

====Caliphate of Umar II====
Sulayman was succeeded by his cousin, [[Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz]] (717–720), whose position among the Umayyad caliphs is somewhat unusual. He is the only Umayyad ruler to have been recognized by subsequent Islamic tradition as a genuine caliph (''khalifa'') and not merely as a worldly king (''malik'').

Umar is honoured for his attempt to resolve the fiscal problems attendant upon conversion to Islam. During the Umayyad period, the majority of people living within the caliphate were not Muslim, but [[Christians|Christian]], [[Jewish]], [[Zoroastrian]], or members of other small groups. These religious communities were not forced to convert to Islam, but were subject to a tax (''jizyah'') which was not imposed upon Muslims. This situation may actually have made widespread conversion to Islam undesirable from the point of view of state revenue, and there are reports that provincial governors actively discouraged such conversions. It is not clear how Umar attempted to resolve this situation, but the sources portray him as having insisted on like treatment of Arab and non-Arab (''[[mawali]]'') Muslims, and on the removal of obstacles to the conversion of non-Arabs to Islam.

===Later Marwanid period===
After the death of Umar, another son of Abd al-Malik, [[Yazid II]] (720–724) became caliph. Yazid is best known for his &quot;[[Iconoclasm#Islamic Iconoclasm|iconoclastic edict]]&quot;, which ordered the destruction of Christian images within the territory of the Caliphate. In 720, another major revolt arose in Iraq, this time led by [[Yazid ibn al-Muhallab]].

====Caliphate of Hisham and end of expansion====
[[File:Rusafa gate.jpg|thumb|The North gate of the city of [[Resafa]], site of Hisham's palace and court]]

The final son of Abd al-Malik to become caliph was [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik|Hisham]] (724–43), whose long and eventful reign was above all marked by the curtailment of military expansion. Hisham established his court at [[Resafa]] in northern Syria, which was closer to the Byzantine border than Damascus, and resumed hostilities against the Byzantines, which had lapsed following the failure of the last siege of Constantinople. The new campaigns resulted in a number of successful raids into [[Anatolia]], but also in a major defeat (the [[Battle of Akroinon]]), and did not lead to any significant territorial expansion.

From the caliphate's north-western African bases, a series of raids on coastal areas of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] paved the way to the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|permanent occupation of most of Iberia]] by the Umayyads (starting in 711), and [[Islamic invasion of Gaul|on into south-eastern Gaul]] (last stronghold at Narbonne in 759). Hisham's reign witnessed the end of expansion in the west, following the defeat of the Arab army by the [[Franks]] at the [[Battle of Tours]] in 732. In 739 a major [[Berber Revolt]] broke out in North Africa, which was probably the largest military setback in the reign of Caliph Hisham. From it, emerged some of the first Muslim states outside the Caliphate. It is also regarded as the beginning of Moroccan independence, as [[Morocco]] would never again come under the rule of an eastern Caliph or any other foreign power until the 20th century. It was followed by the collapse of Umayyad authority in al-Andalus. In [[India]], the Umayyad armies were defeated by the south Indian [[Chalukya dynasty]] and by the north Indian [[Pratiharas]] Dynasty, stagnating further eastward Arab expansion.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Shorter History of India p.131-132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Early India: From the Origins to A.D. 1300 by [[Romila Thapar]] p.333&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An Atlas and Survey of South Asian History by Karl J. Schmidt p.34&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Caliphate 740-en.svg|thumb|The Umayyad Caliphate in 750 CE]]
In the [[Caucasus]], the [[Arab–Khazar Wars|confrontation]] with the [[Khazars]] peaked under Hisham: the Arabs established [[Derbent]] as a major military base and launched several invasions of the northern Caucasus, but failed to subdue the nomadic Khazars. The conflict was arduous and bloody, and the Arab army even suffered a major defeat at the [[Battle of Marj Ardabil]] in 730. Marwan ibn Muhammad, the future Marwan II, finally ended the war in 737 with a massive invasion that is reported to have reached as far as the [[Volga]], but the Khazars remained unsubdued.

Hisham suffered still worse defeats in the east, where his armies attempted to subdue both [[Tokharistan]], with its centre at [[Balkh]], and [[Transoxiana]], with its centre at [[Samarkand]]. Both areas had already been partially conquered, but remained difficult to govern. Once again, a particular difficulty concerned the question of the conversion of non-Arabs, especially the [[Sogdiana|Sogdians]] of Transoxiana. Following the Umayyad defeat in the &quot;[[Day of Thirst]]&quot; in 724, Ashras ibn 'Abd Allah al-Sulami, governor of [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], promised tax relief to those Sogdians who converted to Islam but went back on his offer when it proved too popular and threatened to reduce tax revenues.

Discontent among the Khorasani Arabs rose sharply after the losses suffered in the [[Battle of the Defile]] in 731. In 734, [[al-Harith ibn Surayj]] led a revolt that received broad backing from Arabs and natives alike, capturing Balkh but failing to take [[Merv]]. After this defeat, al-Harith's movement seems to have been dissolved. The problem of the rights of non-Arab Muslims would continue to plague the Umayyads.

====Third Fitna====
{{main|Third Fitna}}
Hisham was succeeded by [[Al-Walid II]] (743–44), the son of Yazid II. Al-Walid is reported to have been more interested in earthly pleasures than in religion, a reputation that may be confirmed by the decoration of the so-called &quot;desert palaces&quot; (including [[Qasr Amra|Qusayr Amra]] and [[Khirbat al-Mafjar]]) that have been attributed to him. He quickly attracted the enmity of many, both by executing a number of those who had opposed his accession and by persecuting the [[Al-Qadariyya|Qadariyya]].

In 744, [[Yazid III]], a son of al-Walid I, was proclaimed caliph in Damascus, and his army tracked down and killed al-Walid II. Yazid III has received a certain reputation for piety and may have been sympathetic to the Qadariyya. He died a mere six months into his reign.

Yazid had appointed his brother, [[Ibrahim of Umayyad|Ibrahim]], as his successor, but [[Marwan II]] (744–50), the grandson of Marwan I, led an army from the northern frontier and entered Damascus in December 744, where he was proclaimed caliph. Marwan immediately moved the capital north to [[Harran]], in present-day [[Turkey]]. A rebellion soon broke out in Syria, perhaps due to resentment over the relocation of the capital, and in 746 Marwan razed the walls of [[Homs]] and Damascus in retaliation.

Marwan also faced significant opposition from Kharijites in Iraq and Iran, who put forth first [[Al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Shaybani|Dahhak ibn Qays]] and then Abu Dulaf as rival caliphs. In 747, Marwan managed to re-establish control of Iraq, but by this time a more serious threat had arisen in [[greater Khorasan|Khorasan]].

====Abbasid Revolution and fall====
{{main|Abbasid Revolution}}
[[File:revolt.png|thumb|upright=1.6|The Caliphate at the beginning of the [[Abbasid]] revolt, before the [[Battle of the Zab]]]]

The [[Hashimiyya]] movement (a sub-sect of the [[Kaysanites Shia]]), led by the [[Abbasid]] family, overthrew the Umayyad caliphate. The Abbasids were members of the [[Banu Hashim|Hashim]] clan, rivals of the Umayyads, but the word &quot;Hashimiyya&quot; seems to refer specifically to Abu Hashim, a grandson of Ali and son of Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya. According to certain traditions, Abu Hashim died in 717 in Humeima in the house of Muhammad ibn Ali, the head of the Abbasid family, and before dying named Muhammad ibn Ali as his successor. This tradition allowed the Abbasids to rally the supporters of the failed revolt of [[Mukhtar]], who had represented themselves as the supporters of Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya.

Beginning around 719, Hashimiyya missions began to seek adherents in Khurasan. Their campaign was framed as one of proselytism ([[dawah]]). They sought support for a &quot;member of the family&quot; of Muhammad, without making explicit mention of the Abbasids. These missions met with success both among Arabs and non-Arabs ([[mawali]]), although the latter may have played a particularly important role in the growth of the movement.

Around 746, [[Abu Muslim]] assumed leadership of the Hashimiyya in Khurasan. In 747, he successfully initiated an open revolt against Umayyad rule, which was carried out under the sign of the [[Black Standard|black flag]]. He soon established control of Khurasan, expelling its Umayyad governor, [[Nasr ibn Sayyar]], and dispatched an army westwards. Kufa fell to the Hashimiyya in 749, the last Umayyad stronghold in Iraq, [[Wasit]], was [[Siege of Wasit|placed under siege]], and in November of the same year [[As-Saffah|Abul Abbas as-Saffah]] was recognized as the new caliph in the mosque at Kufa.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} At this point Marwan mobilized his troops from Harran and advanced toward Iraq. In January 750 the two forces met in the [[Battle of the Zab]], and the Umayyads were defeated. Damascus fell to the Abbasids in April, and in August, Marwan was killed in Egypt.

The victors desecrated the tombs of the Umayyads in Syria, sparing only that of [[Umar II]], and most of the remaining members of the Umayyad family were tracked down and killed. When Abbasids declared amnesty for members of the Umayyad family, eighty gathered to receive pardons, and all were massacred. One grandson of Hisham, [[Abd al-Rahman I]], survived, escaped across North Africa, and established an emirate in [[Moors|Moorish]] [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] ([[Al-Andalus]]). In a claim unrecognized outside of al-Andalus, he maintained that the Umayyad Caliphate, the true, authentic caliphate, more legitimate than the Abbasids, was continued through him in [[Emirate of Córdoba|Córdoba]]. It was to survive for centuries.

Previté-Orton argues that the reason for the decline of the Umayyads was the rapid expansion of Islam. During the Umayyad period, mass conversions brought Persians, Berbers, Copts, and Aramaics to Islam. These ''mawalis'' (clients) were often better educated and more civilised than their Arab overlords. The new converts, on the basis of equality of all Muslims, transformed the political landscape. Previté-Orton also argues that the feud between Syria and Iraq further weakened the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Previté-Orton (1971), vol. 1, pg. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

==Umayyad administration==
The first four caliphs created a stable administration for the empire, following the practices and administrative institutions of the Byzantine Empire which had ruled the same region previously.&lt;ref&gt;Neal Robinson, ''Islam: A Concise Introduction'', (RoutledgeCurzon, 1999), 22.&lt;/ref&gt; These consisted of four main governmental branches: political affairs, military affairs, tax collection, and religious administration. Each of these was further subdivided into more branches, offices, and departments.

===Provinces===
Geographically, the empire was divided into several provinces, the borders of which changed numerous times during the Umayyad reign. Each province had a governor appointed by the caliph. The governor was in charge of the religious officials, army leaders, police, and civil administrators in his province. Local expenses were paid for by taxes coming from that province, with the remainder each year being sent to the central government in Damascus. As the central power of the Umayyad rulers waned in the later years of the dynasty, some governors neglected to send the extra tax revenue to Damascus and created great personal fortunes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ochsenwald 2004 57&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Ochsenwald|first=William|author-link=William L. Ochsenwald|title=The Middle East, A History|year=2004|publisher=McGraw Hill|isbn=978-0-07-244233-5|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government workers===
As the empire grew, the number of qualified Arab workers was too small to keep up with the rapid expansion of the empire. Therefore, Muawiya allowed many of the local government workers in conquered provinces to keep their jobs under the new Umayyad government. Thus, much of the local government's work was recorded in [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]], and [[Persian language|Persian]]. It was only during the reign of [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] that government work began to be regularly recorded in Arabic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ochsenwald 2004 57&quot;/&gt;

===Military===
The Umayyad army was mainly Arab, with its core consisting of those who had settled in urban Syria and the Arab tribes who originally served in the army of the Eastern Roman empire in Syria. These were supported by tribes in the Syrian desert and in the frontier with the Byzantines, as well as Christian Syrian tribes.

The Byzantine and Sassanid Empires relied on money economies before the Muslim conquest, and that system remained in effect during the Umayyad period. Byzantine copper coins were used until 658, while Byzantine gold coins were still in use until the monetary reforms c.700.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mining, Minting, and Acquisition of Gold in the Roman and Post-Roman World'', Fernando Lopez Sanchez, ''Ownership and Exploitation of Land and Natural Resources in the Roman World'', ed. Paul Erdkamp, Koenraad Verboven, and Arjan Zuiderhoek, (Oxford University Press, 2015), 324.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, the Umayyad government began to mint its own coins in Damascus, which were initially similar to pre-existing coins but evolved in an independent direction. These were the first coins minted by a Muslim government in history. Gold coins were called dinars while silver coins were called dirhams.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ochsenwald 2004 57&quot;/&gt;

===Central diwans===
To assist the Caliph in administration there were six boards at the centre: Diwan al-Kharaj (the Board of Revenue), Diwan al-Rasa'il (the Board of Correspondence), Diwan al-Khatam (the Board of Signet), Diwan al-Barid (the Board of Posts), Diwan al-Qudat (the Board of Justice) and Diwan al-Jund (the Military Board)

====Diwan al-Kharaj====
The Central Board of Revenue administered the entire finances of the empire. It also imposed and collected taxes and disbursed revenue.

====Diwan al-Rasa'il====
A regular Board of Correspondence was established under the Umayyads. It issued state missives and circulars to the Central and Provincial Officers. It co-ordinated the work of all Boards and dealt with all correspondence as the chief secretariat.

====Diwan al-Khatam====
In order to reduce forgery, Diwan al-Khatam (Bureau of Registry), a kind of state chancellery, was instituted by Mu'awiyah. It used to make and preserve a copy of each official document before sealing and despatching the original to its destination. Thus in the course of time a state archive developed in Damascus by the Umayyads under Abd al-Malik. This department survived till the middle of the Abbasid period.

====Diwan al-Barid====
{{main|Barid (caliphate)}}

Mu'awiyah introduced postal service, Abd al-Malik extended it throughout his empire, and Walid made full use of it. Umar bin Abdul-Aziz developed it further by building caravanserais at stages along the Khurasan highway. Relays of horses were used for the conveyance of dispatches between the caliph and his agents and officials posted in the provinces. The main highways were divided into stages of {{convert|12|mi|km}} each and each stage had horses, donkeys or camels ready to carry the post. Primarily the service met the needs of Government officials, but travellers and their important dispatches were also benefited by the system. The postal carriages were also used for the swift transport of troops. They were able to carry fifty to a hundred men at a time. Under Governor Yusuf bin Umar, the postal department of Iraq cost 4,000,000 dirhams a year.

====Diwan al-Qudat====
{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}
In the early period of Islam, justice was administered by Muhammad and the orthodox Caliphs in person. After the expansion of the Islamic State, Umar al-Faruq had to separate judiciary from the general administration and appointed the first ''qadi'' in Egypt as early as AD 643/23 AH. After 661, a series of judges served in Egypt during the caliphates of Hisham and Walid II.

====Diwan al-Jund====
The Diwan of Umar, assigning annuities to all Arabs and to the Muslim soldiers of other races, underwent a change in the hands of the Umayyads. The Umayyads meddled with the register and the recipients regarded pensions as the subsistence allowance even without being in active service. Hisham reformed it and paid only to those who participated in battle.
On the pattern of the Byzantine system the Umayyads reformed their army organization in general and divided it into five corps: the centre, two wings, vanguards and rearguards, following the same formation while on march or on a battle field. Marwan II (740–50) abandoned the old division and introduced the Kurdus (cohort), a small compact body.
The Umayyad troops were divided into three divisions: infantry, cavalry and artillery. Arab troops were dressed and armed in Greek fashion. The Umayyad cavalry used plain and round saddles. The artillery used the arradah (ballista), the manjaniq (mangonel) and the dabbabah or kabsh (battering ram). The heavy engines, siege machines and baggage were carried on camels behind the army.

==Social organization==
[[File:Humeima ivory.jpg|thumb|Ivory (circa 8th century) discovered in the Abbasid homestead in Humeima, [[Jordan]].

Bikai, &quot;Archaeology in Jordan&quot;, ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 103 (1999), p. 514.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Umayyad Caliphate had four main social classes:
# Muslim Arabs
# Muslim non-Arabs (clients of the Muslim Arabs)
# [[Dhimmi]]s (non-Muslim free persons such as Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians)
# Slaves

The Muslim Arabs were at the top of the society and saw it as their duty to rule over the conquered areas. Despite the fact that Islam teaches the equality of all Muslims, the Arab Muslims held themselves in higher esteem than Muslim non-Arabs and generally did not mix with other Muslims.

As Islam spread, more and more of the Muslim population consisted of non-Arabs. This caused social unrest, as the new converts were not given the same rights as Muslim Arabs. Also, as conversions increased, tax revenues from non-Muslims decreased to dangerous lows. These issues continued to worsen until they helped cause the [[Abbasid Revolt]] in the 740s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ochsenwald|first=William|author-link=William L. Ochsenwald|title=The Middle East, A History|year=2004|publisher=McGraw Hill|isbn=978-0-07-244233-5|pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-Muslims===
Non-Muslim groups in the Umayyad Caliphate, which included Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians and [[Paganism#Muhammad and Islamization in Arabia|pagans]], were called [[dhimmis]]. They were given a legally protected status as second-class citizens as long as they accepted and acknowledged the political supremacy of the ruling Muslims, i.e. paid a tax, known as [[jizya]], which the Muslims did not have to pay, who would instead pay the [[zakat]] tax. If they converted to Islam they would cease paying jizya and would instead pay zakat.

A heated debate followed, with the name ultimately awarded to Corvallis in an act passed on December 20 of that same year.&lt;ref name=Carey662 /&gt; By way of rationale,  the name &quot;Marysville&quot; was successfully argued to duplicate the moniker of [[Marysville, California|a town in California]], located on the same stagecoach route and that a name change was thus necessary to avoid confusion.&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, ''History of Benton County, Oregon,'' pg. 425.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incorporation===

A faction within the deeply divided legislature sought to make Corvallis the capital of the [[Oregon Territory]], and in December 1855 the 6th Territorial Legislature initially convened there before returning to Salem later that month — the town which would eventually be selected as the permanent seat of state government.&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt;

Corvallis was incorporated as a city on January 29, 1857.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corvallis150.org/birthdayguide.pdf|title=corvallis150.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127194318/http://www.corvallis150.org/birthdayguide.pdf|archive-date=2007-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th-century growth===

Corvallis had a three-year boom beginning in 1889, which began with the establishment of a privately owned [[electrical plant]] by L.L. Hurd.&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;Bruce Martin, &quot;Bushrod Washington Wilson,&quot; ''Oregon Historical Quarterly,'' vol. 39, no. 3 (Sept. 1938), pp. 283-284.&lt;/ref&gt; A flurry of publicity and public and private investment followed, including construction of a grand county courthouse, planning and first construction of a new street railway, construction of a new flour mill along the river between Monroe and Jackson Avenues, and construction of the [[Julian Hotel|Hotel Corvallis]], today known as the Julian Hotel.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;

In addition, a carriage factory was launched in the city and the town's streets were improved, while the size of the city was twice enlarged through annexation.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; Bonds were issued for a city-owned water works, a sewer system, and for public ownership of the electric plant.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; A publicity campaign was launched to attempt to expand the tax base through new construction for new arrivals.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; This effort proved mostly unsuccessful, however, and in 1892, normalcy returned, with the city saddled with about $150,000 in bonded debt.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;

==Geography==
Corvallis is at an elevation of {{convert|235|ft|m}} above sea level.&lt;ref name=&quot;GR1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Situated midway in the [[Willamette Valley]], in terms of driving distances, Corvallis is about {{convert|46|mi|km}} east of [[Newport, Oregon|Newport]] and the Oregon Coast, {{convert|85|mi|km}} south of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], {{convert|30|mi|km}} south of the state capital, Salem, {{convert|10|mi|km}} southwest of [[Albany, Oregon|Albany]], about {{convert|10|mi|km}} west of [[Interstate 5 in Oregon|Interstate 5]] at its closest point, and {{convert|48|mi|km}} north of [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]]/[[Springfield, Oregon|Springfield]]. [[Oregon Route 99W]], a secondary north–south route, also runs through Corvallis. [[U.S. Route 20]] (which leads to Newport) and Oregon Route 34 (which leads to [[Waldport, Oregon|Waldport]] about {{convert|56|mi|km}} to the west) both secondary East-West routes run through Corvallis from the Oregon Coast. Corvallis is at [[river mile]] 131–32 of the Willamette River.&lt;ref&gt;Willamette River Recreation Guide. 2007. Extension Service, Oregon State University. [http://www.oregon.gov/osmb/library/docs/willametteriverguidepdf.pdf Available online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125235710/http://www.oregon.gov/osmb/library/docs/willametteriverguidepdf.pdf |date=2013-11-25 }} from the state government of Oregon.&lt;/ref&gt; Corvallis is bordered on the northwest by the foothills of the [[Oregon Coast Range]], with [[Bald Hill (Oregon)|Bald Hill]] providing a view of the town.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|14.30|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|14.13|sqmi|sqkm|2}} are land and {{convert|0.17|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is covered by water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=2012-12-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702145235/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archive-date=2012-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==

Like the rest of the Willamette Valley, Corvallis falls within the dry-summer temperate climate zone, also referred to as cool-summer Mediterranean ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''[[Mediterranean climate|Csb]]''). Temperatures are mild year round, with warm, dry, sunny summers and mild, wet winters with persistently overcast skies. Spring and fall are also moist seasons with varied cloudiness, and light rain falling for extended periods.

Winter snow is rare, but occasionally does fall, and amounts can range between a dusting and a few inches that do not persist on the ground for more than a day. The northwest hills will often experience more snow. During the midwinter months after extended periods of rain, thick, persistent fogs can form, sometimes lasting the entire day. This can severely reduce visibility to as low as {{convert|20|ft|m}}. The fog often persists until a new storm system enters the area. This fog could be seen as a type of [[tule fog]].

Rainfall totals within the town itself are surprisingly variable, due to Corvallis lying right on the eastern edge of the [[Oregon Coast Range]], with a small portion of the town inside of the range. Rainfall amounts can range from an average of {{convert|66.40|in|cm}} per year &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldclimate.com/cgi-bin/data.pl?ref=N44W123+2300+351877C|title=CORVALLIS WATER BURE, BENTON COUNTY, OREGON USA Weather History and Climate Data|website=www.worldclimate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the far northwest hills, compared to {{convert|43.66|in|cm}} per year at [[Oregon State University]], which is located in the center of Corvallis.

Because of its close proximity to the coastal range, Corvallis can experience slightly cooler temperatures, particularly in the hills, than the rest of the Willamette Valley. The average annual low temperature is 4°F less than that of Portland just {{convert|85|mi|km}} to the north. Despite this, temperatures dropping far below freezing are still a rare event.

===2010 census===
As of the 2010 U.S. Census, there were 54,462 people, 22,283 households, and 10,240 families residing in the city. The [[population density]] was 4004.5 people per square mile (1,547.2/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). There were 23,423 housing units at an average density of 1,722.3 per square mile (665.4/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The racial makeup of the city was 83.8% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 7.3% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 1.1% [[Black (U.S. Census)|Black]] or [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.69% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.33% Hawaiian or [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 2.8% from [[Race (U.S. Census)|other races]], and 4.0% from two or more races. 7.4% of the population were [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race.&lt;ref name =&quot;wwwcensusgov&quot;/&gt;

There were 22,283 households, of which 20.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 35.3% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 7.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 54.0% were non-families. 33.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.22 and the average family size was 2.82.&lt;ref name =&quot;wwwcensusgov&quot;/&gt;

In the city, the population was spread out, with 14.9% under the age of 18, 32.4% from 18 to 24, 22.9% from 25 to 44, 19.3% from 45 to 64, and 10.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 26.4 years. For every 100 males there were 98.7 females.&lt;ref name =&quot;wwwcensusgov&quot;/&gt;

===Religion===
In 1903, [[Franz Edmund Creffield]], commonly known as Edmund Creffield (''circa'' 1870–1906), a German-American religious leader who called himself Joshua, founded a movement in Corvallis which became known locally as the &quot;Holy Rollers&quot;.

Corvallis lies in the middle of the [[Unchurched Belt]]. A 2003 study, released once every 10 years, listed Benton County (of which Corvallis makes up the majority of the population) as the least religious county per capita in the United States.  Only one in four people indicated that they were affiliated with one of the 149 religious groups the study identified. The study indicated that some of the disparity, however, may be attributed to the popularity of less common religions (ones not included as an option in the study) in the Pacific Northwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Jones went on to serve two periods as President of the International Psychoanalytic Association from 1920 to 1924 and 1932 to 1949, where he had significant influence. In 1920 he founded the ''[[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]'', serving as its editor until 1939. The following year he established the International Psychoanalytic Library, which published some 50 books under his editorship. Jones soon obtained from Freud rights to the English translation of his work. In 1924 the first two volumes of Freud's ''Collected Papers '' was published in translations edited by Jones and supervised by [[Joan Riviere]], his former analysand and, at one stage, ardent suitor.{{sfn|Maddox|2006|p=135}} After a period in analysis with Freud, Riviere worked with Jones as the translation editor of the ''International Journal of Psychoanalysis.'' She then was part of a working group Jones set up to plan and deliver [[James Strachey]]'s translations for the [[The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud|standard edition of Freud's work]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud'', edited and translated from the German by James Strachey, in collaboration with Anna Freud. Assisted by [[Alix Strachey]] and Alan Tyson, 24 volumes. London: Hogarth Press 1955–1974&lt;/ref&gt;
Largely through Jones' energetic advocacy, the [[British Medical Association]] officially recognised psychoanalysis in 1929. The [[BBC]] subsequently removed him from a list of speakers declared to be dangerous to public morality. In the 1930s Jones and his colleagues made a series of radio broadcasts on psychoanalysis.{{sfn|Maddox|2006|p=203}}

After [[Adolf Hitler]] took power in Germany, Jones helped many displaced and endangered Jewish analysts to resettle in England and other countries. Following the [[Anschluss]] of March 1938, Jones flew into Vienna at considerable personal risk to play a crucial role in negotiating and organising the emigration of Freud and his circle to London.{{efn|In securing the requisite immigration permits, Jones made use of his personal relationship with the Home Secretary, [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Sir Samuel Hoare]].  Both were keen ice skaters and members of the same London skating club.}}{{sfn|Maddox|2006|p=230}}

==Jones–Freud controversy==
Jones's early published work on psychoanalysis had been devoted to expositions of the fundamentals of Freudian theory, an elaboration of its theory of symbolism, and its application to the analysis of religion, mythology, folklore and literary and artistic works. Under the influence of [[Melanie Klein]], Jones' work took a new direction.

Klein had made an impact in Berlin in the new field of child analysis and had impressed Jones in 1925 when he attended her series of lectures to the British Society in London.  At Jones's invitation she moved to London the following year; she soon acquired a number of devoted and influential followers.  Her work had a dramatic effect on the British Society, polarising its members into rival factions as it became clear that her approach to child analysis was seriously at odds with that of Anna Freud, as set out in her 1927 book ''An Introduction to the Technique of Child Analysis''.  The disagreement centred around the clinical approach to the pre-Oedipal child; Klein argued for play as an equivalent to free association in adult analyses. Anna Freud opposed any such equivalence, proposing an educative intervention with the child until an appropriate level of ego development was reached at the Oedipal stage.  Klein held this to be a collusive inhibition of analytical work with the child.{{sfn|Maddox|2006|pp=182–188}}

Influenced by Klein, and initiating what became known as the Jones–Freud controversy, Jones set out to explore a range of interlinked topics in the theory of early psychic development. These included the structure and genesis of the superego and the nature of the feminine castration complex.{{sfnm |1a1=Jones |1y=1927 |2a1=Jones |2y=1933 |3a1=Jones |3y=1935 |4a1=Mitchell |4y=2000 |4pp=130–131}} He coined the term ''[[phallocentrism]]'' in a critique of Freud's account of sexual difference. He argued together with Klein and her Berlin colleague, [[Karen Horney]], for a primary femininity, saying that penis envy arose as a defensive formation rather than arising from the fact, or &quot;injury&quot;, of biological asymmetry. In a corresponding reformulation of the castration complex, Jones introduced the concept of &quot;[[aphanisis]]&quot; to refer to the fear of &quot;the permanent extinction of the capacity (including opportunity) for sexual enjoyment&quot;.{{sfn|Maddox|2006|p=208}}

These departures from orthodoxy were noted in Vienna and were topics that were featured in the regular Freud–Jones correspondence, the tone of which became increasingly fractious.  Faced with accusations from Freud of orchestrating a campaign against him and his daughter, Jones sought to allay Freud's concerns without abandoning his new critical standpoint. Eventually, following a series of exchange lectures between the Vienna and London societies, which Jones arranged with Anna Freud, Freud and Jones resumed their usual cordial exchanges.

With the arrival in Britain of refugee German and Viennese analysts in the 1930s, including Anna Freud in 1938, the hostility between the orthodox Freudians and Kleinians in the British Society grew more intense. Jones chaired a number of &quot;extraordinary business meetings&quot; with the aim of defusing the conflict, and these continued into the war years.  The meetings, which became known as the [[controversial discussions]], were established on a more regular basis from 1942. By that time, Jones had removed himself from direct participation, owing to ill health and the difficulties of war-time travel from his home in [[Elsted]], West Sussex.  He resigned from the presidency of the British Society in 1944, the year in which, under the presidency of [[Sylvia Payne]], there finally emerged a compromise agreement which established parallel training courses providing options to satisfy the concerns of the rival groups that had formed: followers of Anna Freud, followers of Melanie Klein and a non-aligned group of Middle or [[British Independent Group (psychoanalysis)|Independent Group]] analysts. It was agreed further that all the key policy making committees of the BPS should have representatives from the three groups.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Ron ‘The evolution of organisational and training procedures in psychoanalytic associations: a brief account of the unique British contribution’ in Johns, J. and Steiner, R. (eds) ''Within Time and Beyond Time: A Festschrift for Pearl King'', London: Karnac, 2001, pp. 66–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life and death==
After the end of the war, Jones gradually relinquished his many official posts whilst continuing his psychoanalytic practice, writings and lecturing. The major undertaking of his final years was his monumental account of Freud's life and work, published to widespread acclaim in three volumes between 1953 and 1957. In this he was ably assisted by his German-speaking wife, who translated much of Freud's early correspondence and other archive documentation made available by [[Anna Freud]]. His uncompleted autobiography, ''Free Associations'', was published posthumously in 1959.

Always proud of his Welsh origins, Jones became a member of the Welsh Nationalist Party, [[Plaid Cymru]]. He had a particular love of the [[Gower Peninsula]], which he had explored extensively in his youth. Following the purchase of a holiday cottage in Llanmadoc, this area became a regular holiday retreat for the Jones family. He was instrumental in helping secure its status in 1956, as the first region of the UK to be designated an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]].{{sfn|Maddox|2006|pp=14, 179}}

Both of Jones's main leisure pursuits resulted in significant publications. A keen ice skater since his schooldays, Jones published an influential textbook on the subject.{{sfn|Jones|1952}} His passion for chess inspired a psychoanalytical study of the life of American chess genius, [[Paul Morphy]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Problem of Paul Morphy – A Contribution to the Psycho-Analysis of Chess&quot; (1931), reprinted from the ''International Journal of Psychoanalysis'' Vol 12:1–23 in ''Volume 1'' of the 1951 edition of ''Essays in Applied Psychoanalysis''&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones was made a [[Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians]] (FRCP) in 1942, Honorary President of the International Psychoanalytical Association in 1949, and was awarded an Honorary [[Doctor of Science]] degree at [[Swansea University]] (Wales) in 1954.

Jones died in London on 11 February 1958, and was cremated at [[Golders Green Crematorium]]. His ashes were buried in the grave of the oldest of his four children in the churchyard of St Cadoc's [[List of villages in Gower#Cheriton|Cheriton]] on the Gower Peninsula.{{sfn|Davies|2001}}

==Biography==
Llewellyn was born in [[Hendon]], [[Middlesex]] in 1906, &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ancestry.co.uk/imageviewer/collections/8912/images/ONS_B19071AZ-0364?pId=19265557 England &amp; Wales, Civil Registration Birth Index, 1837-1915 for Richard Herbert V Lloyd, 1907, Q1-Jan-Feb-Mar: Ancestry.com {{subscription}}]&lt;/ref&gt; the oldest of three children to Welsh parents Sarah Anne ''née'' Thomas (1878&amp;ndash;1929) and William Llewellyn Lloyd (1876&amp;ndash;1942), a hotel clerk and later the assistant secretary to a club.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ancestry.co.uk/imageviewer/collections/2352/images/rg14_07280_0213_03?pId=40239595 1911 England Census for William Llewellyn Lloyd, Middlesex, Tottenham, West Tottenham: Ancestry.com {{subscription}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Only after his death was it discovered that Llewellyn's claim that he was born in [[St Davids]], [[West Wales]], was false.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC 1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archiveswales.org.uk/anw/browse_index.php?type=persons&amp;page=list11#lbl1385 Llewellyn, Richard, 1906-1983] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212035056/http://www.archiveswales.org.uk/anw/browse_index.php?type=persons&amp;page=list11 |date=2013-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;What appears to be his birth certificate gives his name as Richard Herbert V Lloyd, see http://www.freebmd.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., Llewellyn won the [[List of National Book Award winners#1935 to 1941|National Book Award]] for favourite novel of 1940, voted by members of the [[American Booksellers Association]].&lt;ref name=nyt1941&gt;
&quot;Books and Authors&quot;, ''The New York Times'', 16 February 1941, page BR12. ProQuest Historical Newspapers The New York Times (1851–2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

He lived a [[Nomad|peripatetic]] existence, travelling widely throughout his life. Before [[World War II]] he spent periods working in [[hotel]]s, wrote a play, worked as a coal miner and produced his best-known novel. During World War II he rose to the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] in the [[Welsh Guards]]. Following the war he worked as a journalist, covering the [[Nuremberg Trials]], and then as a [[screenwriter]] for [[MGM]]. Late in his life, he lived in [[Eilat]], [[Israel]].

Llewellyn married twice: his first wife was Nona Theresa Catherine Sonsteby (1921&amp;ndash;1988), whom he married in 1952 and divorced in 1968; his second wife was Susan Heimann, whom he married in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ancestry.co.uk/imageviewer/collections/8753/images/ons_m19741az-0834?pId=20761078 England &amp; Wales, Civil Registration Marriage Index, 1916-2005 for Richard D V L Lloyd, 1974: Ancestry.com {{subscription}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Richard Llewellyn died in [[Dublin]] on 30 November 1983.

==Themes==
Several of his novels dealt with a Welsh theme, the best-known being ''[[How Green Was My Valley]]'' (1939), which won international acclaim and was made into a classic [[Hollywood]] film. It immortalised the way of life of the [[South Wales Valleys]] [[coal mining]] communities, where Llewellyn spent a small amount of time with his grandfather. Three sequels followed.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC 1&quot;/&gt;

Llewellyn's novels often included the recurring element of protagonists who assume new identities (as they are transplanted into foreign cultures), such as the character Edmund Trothe whose adventures extend through several spy adventure books.

[[File:NLW Image Richard Hughes.png|thumb|Richard Hughes in 1971]]
'''Richard Arthur Warren Hughes''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE}} (19 April 1900 – 28 April 1976) was a British writer of poems, short stories, novels and plays.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Perceval Graves]]: ''Richard Hughes. A biography.'' London: A. Deutsch, 1994.
&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Weybridge]], Surrey.  His father was Arthur Hughes, a civil servant, and his mother Louisa Grace Warren who had been brought up in the West Indies in Jamaica.  He was educated first at [[Charterhouse School]] and graduated from [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]], Oxford in 1922.

A Charterhouse schoolmaster had sent Hughes's first published work to the magazine ''[[The Spectator (1828)|The Spectator]]'' in 1917. The article, written as a school essay, was an unfavourable criticism of ''[[The Loom of Youth]]'', by [[Alec Waugh]], a recently published novel which caused a furore for its account of homosexual passions between British schoolboys in a public school. At Oxford he met [[Robert Graves]], also an [[List of Old Carthusians|Old Carthusian]], and they co-edited a poetry publication, ''[[Oxford Poetry]]'', in 1921. Hughes's short play ''[[The Sisters' Tragedy]]'' was being staged in the [[West End of London]] at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] by 1922.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/richard-hughes-salem/richard-hughes E-Notes: Richard Hughes Biography]. Retrieved 25 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He was the author of the world's first radio play, ''Danger'', commissioned from him for the [[BBC]] by [[Nigel Playfair]] and broadcast on 15 January 1924.

Hughes was employed as a journalist and travelled widely before he married the painter [[Frances Bazley]] in 1932. They settled for a period in [[Norfolk]] and then in 1934 at [[Castle House, Laugharne]] in south Wales. [[Dylan Thomas]] stayed with Hughes and wrote his book ''[[Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog]]'' whilst living at [[Castle House, Laugharne|Castle House]].  Hughes was instrumental in Thomas relocating permanently to the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dylan Thomas' Laugharne |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/dylan-thomas/pages/laugharne.shtml |website=Wales Arts |publisher=BBC |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213232238/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/dylan-thomas/pages/laugharne.shtml |archivedate=13 December 2013 |date=6 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote only four novels, the most famous of which is ''The Innocent Voyage'' (1929), or ''[[A High Wind in Jamaica (novel)|A High Wind in Jamaica]]'', as Hughes renamed it soon after its initial publication.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Swinnerton: &quot;Books: Novel Changes Its Name for British Readers; 'Innocent Voyage' Soon to Be Reprinted,&quot; ''The Chicago Tribune'' (10 August 1929), p. 6.  &quot;The novel by Richard Hughes, published with so much and such welcome success in the United States under the title of &quot;The Innocent Voyage,&quot; is to be issued in England in the autumn. Its title will be 'High Wind in Jamaica.'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Set in the 19th century, it explores the events which follow the accidental capture of a group of English children by pirates: the children are revealed as considerably more amoral than the pirates (it was in this novel that Hughes first described the cocktail [[Hangman's Blood]]). In 1938, he wrote an allegorical novel, ''In Hazard'', based on the true story of the S.S. ''Phemius'' that was caught in the [[1932 Cuba hurricane]] for four days during its maximum intensity. He wrote volumes of children's stories, including ''The Spider's Palace''.

During [[World War II]], Hughes had a desk job in the [[Admiralty]]. He met the architects [[Jane Drew]] and [[Maxwell Fry]], and Jane's and Max's children stayed with the Hughes family for much of that time. After the end of the war, he spent ten years writing scripts for [[Ealing Studios]], and published no more novels until 1961. Of the trilogy ''[[The Human Predicament]]'', only the first two volumes, ''[[The Fox in the Attic]]'' (1961) and ''The Wooden Shepherdess'' (1973), were complete when he died; twelve chapters, less than 50 pages, of the final volume are now published. In these he describes the course of [[European history]] from the 1920s through [[World War II]], including real characters and events—such as [[Hitler]]'s escape after the abortive [[Beer Hall Putsch|Munich putsch]]—as well as fictional.

Later in life Hughes relocated to [[Ynys, Gwynedd|Ynys]] in [[Gwynedd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stainedglass.llgc.org.uk/object/3757|title=The Arrival of St Tecwyn - work from Stained Glass in Wales|website=stainedglass.llgc.org.uk|accessdate=19 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was churchwarden of [[Llanfihangel-y-traethau]], the village church, where he was buried when he died at home in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Pearson|first=Lynn F.|title=Discovering Famous Graves |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9IaHTin6y2wC&amp;pg=PA134|accessdate=25 March 2016 |year=2004|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-0-7478-0619-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes was a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]] and, in the United States, an honorary member of both the [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]] and the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]]. He was awarded the OBE (Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]]) in 1946.

==Family==

Richard and Frances Hughes had five children: Revd. Robert (Bob) Elyston-Glodrydd (1932-2019; vicar of [[Harlech]] and Llanfihangel-y-traethau), Penelope (1934), Lleky Susannah (1936–2018), Catherine Phyllida (1940; married the historian [[Colin Wells (historian)|Colin Wells]] in 1960) and Owain Gardner Collingwood (1943).

'''Leptis''' or '''Lepcis Magna''', also known by [[#Names|other names]] in [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], was a prominent city of the [[Carthaginian Empire]] and [[Roman Libya]] at the mouth of the Wadi Lebda in the [[Mediterranean]].

Originally a 7th-century{{nbsp}}BC [[Phoenicia]]n foundation, it was greatly expanded under Roman Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] ({{reign|193|211}}), who was a native of the city. The [[Legio III Augusta|3rd Augustan Legion]] was stationed here to defend the city against [[Berbers|Berber]] incursions. After the legion's dissolution under {{nowrap|[[Gordian III]]}} in 238, the city was increasingly open to raids in the later part of the 3rd century. [[Diocletian]] reinstated the city as provincial capital, and it grew again in prosperity until it fell to the [[Vandals]] in 439. It was reincorporated into the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Empire]] in 533 but continued to be plagued by Berber raids and never recovered its former importance. It fell to the [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|Muslim invasion]] in {{c.|647}} and was subsequently abandoned.

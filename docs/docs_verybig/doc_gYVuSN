The Bancroft family and heirs of [[Clarence W. Barron]] effectively controlled the company's class B shares, each with a voting power of ten regular shares, prior to its sale to News Corp. At one time, they controlled 64% of Dow Jones voting stock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6710633.stm BBC News - ''Dow Jones family to consider sale'' - 1 June 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, Dow Jones is owned by Rupert Murdoch, owner of News Corp and several other major media companies.

=== Buyout offer ===
On May 1, 2007, Dow Jones released a statement confirming that [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]], led by [[Rupert Murdoch]], had made an unsolicited offer of $60 per share, or $5 billion, for Dow Jones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2007/05/01/news/companies/newspapers/index.htm?postversion=2007050112|title=News Corp. offers $60 for Dow Jones - May. 1, 2007|website=Money.cnn.com|accessdate=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stock was briefly halted for pending press release. The halt lasted under 10 minutes while CNBC was receiving data. It has been suggested that the buyout offer is related to Murdoch's new cable business news channel [[Fox Business]] that launched in 2007. The Dow Jones brand brings instant credibility to the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/index.php?menuID=1&amp;subID=1359 thefirstpost.co.uk - ''Rupert Murdoch comes roaring back''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020020738/http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/index.php?menuID=1&amp;subID=1359 |date=October 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 6, 2007, CEO Brian Tierney of Philadelphia Media Holdings L.L.C., owning company of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'', and Philly.com, went public in an article on Philly.com expressing interest in &quot;joining with outside partners to buy Dow Jones.&quot; Tierney said, &quot;We would participate as Philadelphia Media Holdings, along with other investors. We wouldn't do it alone.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philly.com/philly/hp/news_top/20070607_A_joint_bid_.html ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929125610/http://www.philly.com/philly/hp/news_top/20070607_A_joint_bid_.html |date=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, [[MySpace]] co-founder [[Brad Greenspan]] put forth a bid to buy 25% of Dow Jones for $60 a share, the same price per share as News Corporation's bid. Greenspan's offer was for $1.25 billion for 25% of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/Dispatch/070621markets.aspx|title=Stock quotes, financial tools, news and analysis - MSN Money|website=Articles.moneycentral.msn.com|accessdate=August 19, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224205419/http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/Dispatch/070621markets.aspx|archive-date=February 24, 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 17, 2007, The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', a unit of Dow Jones, reported that the company and News Corporation had agreed in principle on a US$5 billion takeover, that the offer would be put to the full Dow Jones board on the same evening in New York, and that the offer valued the company at 70% more than the company's market value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118463978304868582 |title=Dow Jones, News Corp.

====Insider trading scandal====
Upon investigating suspicious share price movements in the run-up to the announcement, the SEC alleged that board member [[Sir David Li]], one of Hong Kong's most prominent businessmen, had informed his close friend and business associate Michael Leung of the impending offer. Leung had acted on this information by telling his daughter and son-in-law, who reaped a US$8.2 million profit from the [[insider trading]] transaction.&lt;ref name=secactions&gt;[http://www.secactions.com/?p=304 The News Corp-Dow Jones Insider Trading Case:  A Significant Settlement],  ''SEC Actions'', February 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Council of Churches''' ('''WCC''') is a worldwide [[Christianity|Christian]] inter-church organization founded in 1948 to work for the cause of [[ecumenism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harmon2010&quot;/&gt; Its full members today include the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], the [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]], most jurisdictions of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Old Catholic Church]], the [[Lutheran World Federation|Lutheran Churches]], the [[Anglican Communion]], the [[Mennonite Church (disambiguation)|Mennonite Churches]], the [[World Methodist Council|Methodist Churches]], the [[Moravian Church]] and the [[World Communion of Reformed Churches|Reformed Churches]], as well as the [[Baptist World Alliance|Baptist Churches]] and [[Pentecostal Church]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harmon2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harmon |first1=Steven R. |title=Ecumenism Means You, Too: Ordinary Christians and the Quest for Christian Unity |date=15 March 2010 |publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers |isbn=978-1-62189-277-9 |page=97 |language=English|quote=Since its creation, it has also established a cordial cooperation with the World Council of Churches and regularly names Catholic observers at various ecumenical gatherings and invites observers of &quot;fraternal delegates&quot; of other churches or ecclesial communities to major events of the Catholic Church.

The WCC is the broadest and most inclusive among the many organized expressions of the modern ecumenical movement. It brings together 349 churches, denominations and church fellowships in more than 100 countries and territories throughout the world, representing over 560 million Christians and including most of the world's Orthodox churches, scores of Anglican, Baptist, Lutheran, Methodist and Reformed churches, as well as many United and Independent churches. ...

The World Council of Churches is a fellowship of churches which confess the Lord Jesus Christ as God and Savior according to the scriptures, and therefore seek to fulfill together their common calling to the glory of the one God: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

It is a community of churches on the way to visible unity in one faith and one eucharistic fellowship, expressed in worship and in common life in Christ.

==History==
The [[Christian ecumenism|Ecumenical Movement]] met with initial successes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the [[Edinburgh Missionary Conference]] of 1910 (chaired by future WCC Honorary President [[John R. Mott]]). In 1920, the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Germanus V of Constantinople]], wrote a letter &quot;addressed 'To all the Churches of Christ, wherever they may be', urging closer co-operation among separated Christians, and suggesting a 'League of Churches', parallel to the newly founded [[League of Nations]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ware1993&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Ware|first=Kallistos|title=The Orthodox Church|date=29 April 1993|publisher=Penguin Adult|isbn=9780140146561|page=322|quote=From the beginning of the twentieth century the Ecumenical Patriarchate has shown a special concern for Christian reconciliation. At his accession in 1902, Patriarch Joachim III sent an encyclical letter to all the autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Churches, asking in particular for their opinion on relations with other Christian bodies. In January 1920 the Ecumenical Patriarchate followed this up with a bold and prophetic letter addressed 'To all the Churches of Christ, wherever they may be', urging closer co-operation among separated Christians, and suggesting a 'League of Churches', parallel to the newly founded League of Nations. Many of the ideas in this letter anticipate subsequent developments in the WCC. Constantinople, along with several of the other Eastern Orthodox Churches, was represented at the Faith and Order Conferences at Lausanne in 1927 and at Edinburgh in 1937. The Ecumenical Patriarchate also participated in the first Assembly of the WCC at Amsterdam in 1948, and has been a consistent supporter of the work of the WCC ever since.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Church leaders agreed in 1937 to establish a World Council of Churches, based on a merger of the ''[[Faith and Order Movement]]'' (under [[Charles Brent]] of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] of the United States) and ''[[Life and Work (conference)|Life and Work Movement]]'' (under [[Nathan Söderblom]] of the Lutheran [[Church of Sweden]]) organisations.

Its official establishment was deferred with the outbreak of [[World War II]] until August 23, 1948. Delegates of 147 churches assembled in [[Amsterdam]] to merge the [[Faith and Order Movement]] and [[Life and Work Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/who-are-we/background/history/assemblies.html|title=WCC Assemblies 1948 - today|publisher=World Council of Churches|accessdate=2011-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908154936/http://www.oikoumene.org/en/who-are-we/background/history/assemblies.html|archive-date=2011-09-08|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was consolidated by a second meeting at [[Lund]] in 1950, for which the British Methodist [[Robert Newton Flew]] edited an influential volume of studies, ''The Nature of the Church''.&lt;ref&gt;Flew's ODNB entry: [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/39614 Retrieved 18 September 2011. Subscription required.]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent mergers were with the [[International Missionary Council]] in 1961 and the [[World Council of Christian Education]], with its roots in the 18th century [[Sunday School]] movement, in 1971.

WCC member churches include the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and the [[Oriental Orthodox Church]]es, almost all of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es and [[Lutheran Church]]es; the [[Moravian Church]]; the [[Anglican Communion]]; some [[Old Catholic Church]]es; the [[Methodist Churches]]; the [[Presbyterian]] and other [[Reformed Churches]], a sampling of [[United and uniting churches|united]] and independent churches, and some [[Baptist]] and [[Pentecostal]] churches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harmon2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberson1995&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Roberson |first1=Ronald G. |title=Oriental Orthodox-Roman Catholic Interchurch Marriages: And Other Pastoral Relationships |date=1995 |publisher=USCCB Publishing |isbn=978-1-55586-097-4 |page=81 |language=English|quote=These Churches are the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Coptic Orthodox Church, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the Syrian Orthodox Church, and the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church in India. In addition, an independent Orthodox Church of Eritrea was established following that country's independence from Ethiopia in 1993. All are members of the World Council of Churches and have committed themselves to the contemporary ecumenical movement. In total, there are probably about thirty million Oriental Orthodox faithful in the world today.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many churches who refused to join the WCC joined together to form the [[World Evangelical Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldea.org/|title=WEA - World Evangelical Alliance Est 1846|publisher=|accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delegates sent from the member churches meet every seven or eight years in an Assembly, which elects a Central Committee that governs between Assemblies. A variety of other committees and commissions answer to the Central Committee and its staff. Assemblies have been held since 1948.

The &quot;human rights abuses in communist countries evoked grave concern among the leaders of the World Council of Churches.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forsythe|first=David P.|title=Encyclopedia of Human Rights, Volume 1|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195334029|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, historian Christopher Andrew claims that, during the Cold War, a number of important WCC representatives of the Orthodox Church in Eastern Europe had been working for the KGB, and that they influenced the policy of the WCC.&lt;ref name= andrew&gt;Christopher Andrew, &quot;KGB Foreign Intelligence from Brezhnev to the Coup&quot;', in: Wesley K. Wark (ed), ''Espionage: past, present, future?'', Routledge, 1994, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vmXGUkB4ZKQC&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;ots=xqRHJMaERR&amp;dq=wcc%20kgb&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q=wcc%20kgb&amp;f=false p. 52]: &quot;One recently declassified document of 1969 describes the work of five KGB agents on the WCC Central Committee and the appointment of another to a 'high WCC post'. A similar report from 1989 claims that, as a result of agent operations to implement 'a plan approved by the KGB leadership', the WCC Executive and Central Committee adopted public statements (eight) and messages (three) which corresponded to the political course of Socialist [Communist] countries'. While it would be naive to take such boasting entirely a face value, there can be little doubt about the reality of Soviet penetration of the WCC.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; From 1955 to 1958, [[Robert S. Bilheimer]] co-chaired a WCC international commission to prepare a document addressing the threat of [[nuclear warfare]] during the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|page=194|title=Cold War Christians and the Spectre of Nuclear Deterrence, 1945-1959|author=Jonathan Gorry|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|year=2013|isbn=978-1137334244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1961 conference, a 32-year-old Russian Orthodox Bishop named Aleksey Ridiger was sent as delegate to the assembly, and then appointed to the WCC's central committee. He was later elected as Russian patriarch in 1990 as [[Alexy II of Moscow|Alexei II]].&lt;ref&gt;John Gordon Garrard et al., ''Russian Orthodoxy Resurgent: Faith and Power in the New Russia.'', p. 37 f.

==Commissions and teams==
There are two complementary approaches to ecumenism: dialogue and action. The ''Faith and Order Movement'' and ''Life and Work Movement'' represent these approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcc-coe.org/wcc/what/faith/whatis-e.html|title=World Council of Churches — World Council of Churches|publisher=|accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches are reflected in the work of the WCC in its [http://www.wcc-coe.org/wcc/who/commissions.html commissions], these being:
*Echos- Commission on Youth (ages 18–30)
*Commission of the Churches on Diakonia and Development
*Commission on Education and Ecumenical Formation
*Commission of the Churches on International Affairs
*Commission on Justice, Peace and Creation
*Commission on World Mission and Evangelism
*Faith and Order Plenary Commission and the Faith and Order Standing Commission
*Joint Consultative Group with Pentecostals
*Joint Working Group WCC – Catholic Church (Vatican)
*Reference Group on the Decade to Overcome Violence
*Reference Group on Inter-Religious Relations
*Special Commission on Orthodox Participation in the WCC

===Diakonia and development and international relations commissions===
The WCC acts through both its member churches and other religious and social organizations to coordinate ecumenical, evangelical, and social action.

Current WCC programs include a [[Decade to Overcome Violence]], an international campaign to combat [[AIDS|AIDS/HIV]] in [[Africa]] and the ''Justice, Peace and Creation'' initiative.

===Faith and Order Commission===
{{main|Faith and Order Commission}}
WCC's [[Faith and Order Commission]] has been successful in working toward consensus on [[Baptism]], [[Eucharist]], and [[Christian ministry|Ministry]], on the date of [[Easter]], on the nature and purpose of the [[Christian church|church]] ([[ecclesiology]]), and on ecumenical [[hermeneutics]].

===Justice, Peace and Creation Commission===
Justice, Peace and Creation has drawn many elements together with an [[environment (biophysical)|environmental]] focus. Its mandate is:

{{quote|To analyze and reflect on justice, peace and creation ''in their interrelatedness'', to promote values and practices that make for a culture of peace, and to work towards a culture of solidarity with young people, women, Indigenous Peoples and racially and ethnically oppressed people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcc-coe.org/wcc/what/jpc/index-e.html|title=World Council of Churches — World Council of Churches|publisher=|accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Focal issues have been [[globalization]] and the emergence of [[new social movements]] (in terms of people ''bonding together'' in the struggle for justice, peace, and the protection of creation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Relations with the Catholic Church===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}
The largest Christian body, the [[Catholic Church]], is not a member of the WCC, but has worked closely with the Council for more than three decades and sends observers to all major WCC conferences as well as to its Central Committee meetings and the Assemblies (cf. [[Joint Working Group between the Catholic Church and the World Council of Churches|Joint Working Group]]).

The [[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity]] also nominates 12 members to the WCC's ''Faith and Order Commission'' as full members. While not a member of the WCC, the Catholic Church is a member of some other ecumenical bodies at regional and national levels, for example, the [[National Council of Churches in Australia]] and the National Council of Christian Churches in Brazil (CONIC).

[[Pope Pius XI]] stated in 1928, that the only means by which the world Christian community was to return to faith, was to return to Roman Catholic Worship. In this regard, the Papacy rejected, to a great extent, the idea of the participation of the Catholic Church within the World Council of Churches. 
Pius XI stated that the ‘One true Church’ was that of the Roman Catholic denomination, and therefore there was the implication that the Catholic Church was not permitted at this stage to engage with other denominations, which the Papacy considered to be irrelevant. The Catholic Church therefore did not attend the 1948 meeting of the WCC, in addition to the idea that all members of the church were barred from attending WCC conferences.

[[Pope John XXIII]] took a different stance however, and in 1958 he was elected as the head of the Catholic Church. [[Ecumenism]] was a new element of catholic ideology which had been permitted, which was signified to a great extent, when John XXIII met with the then Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Geoffrey Fisher]]. This was the first meeting between an Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Pope in the Vatican for 600 years. John XXIII later developed the office of the [[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity|Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity]]; which symbolised a dramatic shift in support for the ecumenical movement, from the Catholic Church, led from the Vatican. 1961 saw Catholic members attend the Delhi conference of the WCC, which marked a significant shift in attitude toward the WCC from the Papacy. There was the idea in addition to this, that the Pope invited non-Catholics to attend the Vatican II Council.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harmon2010&quot;/&gt; This new approach to inter-denominational relations was marked within the [[Unitatis redintegratio|Unitatis Redintegratio]].

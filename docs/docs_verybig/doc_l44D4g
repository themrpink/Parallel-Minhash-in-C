It is conventional to state that the first movements of concertos from the Classical period onwards follow the structure of [[sonata form]]. Final movements are often in [[rondo]] form, as in J.S. Bach's [[Violin Concerto in E major (Bach)|E Major Violin Concerto]].&lt;ref name=&quot;White&quot;/&gt;

[[Mozart]] wrote five violin concertos, all in 1775. They show a number of influences, notably Italian and [[Austria]]n. Several passages have leanings towards [[folk music]], as manifested in Austrian [[serenade]]s.
Mozart also wrote the [[Sinfonia Concertante for Violin, Viola and Orchestra (Mozart)|Sinfonia Concertante]] for violin, viola, and orchestra.

[[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] wrote only [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|one]] violin concerto that remained obscure until revealed as a masterpiece in a performance by violin virtuoso [[Joseph Joachim]] On 27 May 1844.

===Cello concertos===

Haydn wrote at least two cello concertos (for cello, oboes, horns, and strings), which are the most important works in that genre of the classical era. However, [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C. P. E. Bach's]] three cello concertos and [[Luigi Boccherini|Boccherini's]] twelve concertos are also noteworthy.

===Keyboard concertos===
C.P.E. Bach's keyboard concertos contain some virtuosic solo writing. Some of them have movements that run into one another without a break, and there are frequent cross-movement thematic references.

Mozart, as a child, made arrangements for keyboard and orchestra of four sonatas by now little-known composers. Then he arranged three sonata movements by [[Johann Christian Bach]]. By the time he was twenty, Mozart was able to write concerto ritornelli that gave the orchestra admirable opportunity for asserting its character in an exposition with some five or six sharply contrasted themes, before the soloist enters to elaborate on the material. Of [[Mozart piano concertos|his 27 piano concertos]], the last 22 are highly appreciated.

A dozen cataloged keyboard concertos are attributed to Haydn, of which only three or four are considered genuine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gramophone.co.uk/review/haydn-keyboard-concertos-nos-3-4-11|title=HAYDN Keyboard Concertos Nos 3, 4 &amp; 11|last=Threasher|first=David|publisher=gramophone.co.uk|accessdate=11 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unsourced section|date=May 2020}}
C. P. E. Bach wrote five flute concertos and two oboe concertos.

Bohemian composer [[Antonio Rosetti|Francesco Antonio Rosetti]] composed several solo and double horn concertos. He was a significant contributor to the genre of horn concertos in the 18th century. Most of his outstanding horn concertos were composed between 1782 and 1789 for the Bohemian duo Franz Zwierzina and Joseph Nage while at the Bavarian court of Oettingen-Wallerstein. One of his best-known works in this genre is his Horn Concerto in E flat major C49/K III:36. It consists of three movements: 1. Allegro moderato 2. Romance 3. Rondo.

Many common features of the [[galant style]] are present in Rosetti's music and composing style. In his E-flat horn concerto, we hear periodic and short phrases, galant harmonic rhythm and melodic line reduction.{{OR-inline|date=November 2017}} Rosetti's influence on the 18th century composers, musicians and music was considerable. At the Bavarian court of Oettingen-Wallerstein, his music was often performed by the Wallerstein ensembles. In Paris, his compositions were performed by the best ensembles of the city, including the orchestra of the Concert Spirituel. His publishers were Le Menu et Boyer and Sieber. According to [[H. C. Robbins Landon]] (Mozart scholar),{{Full citation needed|date=November 2016}} Rosetti's horn concertos might have been a model for Mozart's horn concertos.

Mozart wrote one concerto each for flute, [[Oboe Concerto (Mozart)|oboe]] (later rearranged for flute and known as Flute Concerto No. 2), [[Clarinet Concerto (Mozart)|clarinet]], and [[Bassoon Concerto (Mozart)|bassoon]], four for [[Natural horn|horn]],{{Contradiction-inline|date=November 2017}}&lt;!--Elsewhere, this article says five horn concertos.--&gt; a [[Concerto for Flute, Harp, and Orchestra (Mozart)|Concerto for Flute, Harp, and Orchestra]], and ''[[Exsultate, jubilate]]'', a ''de facto'' concerto for soprano voice.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;!--Who claims this concert aria is in concerto form?--&gt; They all exploit and explore the characteristics of the solo instrument(s).

Haydn wrote an important [[trumpet concerto (Haydn)|trumpet concerto]] and a [[Sinfonia Concertante (Haydn)|''Sinfonia Concertante'' for violin, cello, oboe and bassoon]] as well as two horn concertos.

{{main|Violin concerto}}
In the 19th century, the concerto as a vehicle for [[virtuoso|virtuosic]] display flourished. It was an age during which the artist was seen as hero. Early Romantic traits can be found in the violin concertos of [[Giovanni Battista Viotti|Viotti]], but it is [[Louis Spohr|Spohr's]] twelve violin concertos, written between 1802 and 1827, that truly embrace the Romantic spirit with their melodic as well as their dramatic qualities.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Cello concertos===
{{main|Cello concerto}}

Since the Romantic era, the cello has received as much attention as the piano and violin as a concerto instrument, and many great Romantic and even more 20th-century composers left examples.

[[Antonín Dvořák]]'s cello concerto ranks among the supreme examples from the Romantic era while [[Robert Schumann]]'s focuses on the lyrical qualities of the instrument. The instrument was also popular with composers of the Franco-Belgian tradition: [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]] and [[Henri Vieuxtemps|Vieuxtemps]] wrote two cello concertos each and [[Édouard Lalo|Lalo]] and [[Joseph Jongen|Jongen]] one. [[Elgar]]'s popular concerto, while written in the early 20th century, belongs to the late romantic period stylistically.

[[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] contributed to the repertoire with a '' [[Triple Concerto (Beethoven) |Triple Concerto]]'' for piano, violin, cello and orchestra while later in the century, [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] wrote a '' [[Double Concerto (Brahms) |Double Concerto]]'' for violin, cello and orchestra.

[[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s contribution to the genre is a series of [[Variations on a Rococo Theme]].{{Clarify|date=November 2017}}&lt;!--In what way is a theme and variations the formal equivalent of a concerto?--&gt; He also left very fragmentary sketches of a projected Cello Concerto. Cellist [[Yuriy Leonovich]] and Tchaikovsky researcher [[Brett Langston]] published [[Cello Concerto (Tchaikovsky/Leonovich)|their completion]] of the piece in 2006.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

[[Carl Reinecke]], [[David Popper]] and [[Julius Klengel]] also wrote cello concertos that were popular in their time and are still played occasionally nowadays.

Today's 'core' repertoire—performed the most of any cello concertos—are by [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]], [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]], Saint-Saëns, Haydn, [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]] and Schumann, but many more concertos are performed nearly as often (see below: cello concertos in the 20th century).

===Piano concertos===
{{main|Piano concerto}}

Beethoven's five piano concertos increase the technical demands made on the soloist. The last two are particularly remarkable, integrating the concerto into a large symphonic structure with movements that frequently run into one another. His [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|Piano Concerto No. 4]] starts with a statement by the piano, after which the orchestra enters in a foreign key, to present what would normally be the opening [[tutti]]. The work has a lyrical character. The slow movement is a dramatic dialogue between the soloist and the orchestra. His [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Beethoven)|Piano Concerto No. 5]] has the basic rhythm of a Viennese military [[March (music)|march]]. There is no lyrical second subject, but in its place a continuous development of the opening material.{{OR-inline|date=November 2017}}

The piano concertos of [[Johann Baptist Cramer|Cramer]], [[John Field (composer)|Field]], [[Jan Ladislav Dussek|Düssek]], [[Joseph Wölfl|Woelfl]], [[Ferdinand Ries|Ries]], and [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel|Hummel]] provide a link from the Classical concerto to the Romantic concerto.

[[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]] wrote two piano concertos in which the orchestra is relegated to an accompanying role. Schumann, despite being a pianist-composer, wrote a piano concerto in which virtuosity is never allowed to eclipse the essential lyrical quality of the work. The gentle, expressive melody heard at the beginning on woodwind and horns (after the piano's heralding introductory chords) bears the material for most of the argument in the first movement. In fact, argument in the traditional developmental sense is replaced by a kind of variation technique in which soloist and orchestra interweave their ideas.{{OR-inline|date=November 2017}}

[[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]'s mastery of piano technique matched that of [[Paganini]] for the violin. His concertos [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Liszt)|No. 1]] and [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Liszt)|No. 2]] left a deep impression on the style of piano concerto writing, influencing [[Rubinstein]], and especially [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], whose [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Tchaikovsky)|First Piano Concerto's]] rich chordal opening is justly famous.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lumen Learning&quot;&gt;[https://courses.lumenlearning.com/musicapp_historical/chapter/73/] History of the Concerto&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edvard Grieg|Grieg's]] concerto likewise begins in a striking manner after which it continues in a lyrical vein.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

[[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]] wrote five piano concertos and orchestra between 1858 and 1896, in a classical vein.

[[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Brahms)|First Piano Concerto]] in D minor (pub 1861) was the result of an immense amount of work on a mass of material originally intended for a symphony. His [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Brahms)|Second Piano Concerto]] in B{{Music|b}} major (1881) has four movements and is written on a larger scale than any earlier concerto. Like his violin concerto, it is symphonic in proportions.

Fewer piano concertos were written in the late Romantic Period.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} But [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] wrote four piano concertos between 1891 and 1926. His [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Second]] and [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Rachmaninoff)|Third]], being the most popular of the four, went on to become among the most famous in the piano repertoire.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Other romantic piano concertos, like those by [[Friedrich Kalkbrenner|Kalkbrenner]], [[Henri Herz]], [[Ignaz Moscheles|Moscheles]] and [[Sigismond Thalberg|Thalberg]] were also very popular in the Romantic era, but not today.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==20th-century concerto==

Many of the concertos written in the early 20th century belong more to the late Romantic school than to any modernistic movement.{{Clarify|date=April 2017}}&lt;!--The article on musical modernism makes clear that the term applies first and foremost to the &quot;late Romantic&quot; era, typified by Richard Strauss, who is here named (apparently) among the &quot;non-modernistic&quot; composers.--&gt; Masterpieces were written by [[Edward Elgar]] (a violin concerto and a cello concerto), [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] and [[Nikolai Medtner]] (four and three piano concertos, respectively), [[Jean Sibelius]] (a violin concerto), [[Frederick Delius]] (a violin concerto, a [[Cello Concerto (Delius)|cello concerto]], a piano concerto and a [[double concerto for violin and cello]]), [[Karol Szymanowski]] (two violin concertos and a &quot;Symphonie Concertante&quot; for piano), and [[Richard Strauss]] (two horn concertos, a violin concerto, ''Don Quixote''—a tone poem that features the cello as a soloist—and among later works, an [[oboe concerto]]).

However, in the first decades of the 20th century, several composers such as [[Debussy]], [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]], [[Alban Berg|Berg]], [[Hindemith]], [[Stravinsky]], [[Prokofiev]] and [[Bartók]] started experimenting with ideas that were to have far-reaching consequences for the way music is written and, in some cases, performed. Some of these innovations include a more frequent use of [[Musical mode|modality]], the exploration of non-western [[Musical scale|scales]], the development of [[atonality]] and [[neotonality]], the wider acceptance of [[consonance and dissonance|dissonances]], the invention of the [[twelve-tone technique]] of composition and the use of [[polyrhythm]]s and complex [[time signature]]s.

These changes also affected the concerto as a musical form. Beside more or less radical effects on musical language, they led to a redefinition of the concept of virtuosity that included new and extended instrumental techniques and a focus on previously neglected aspects of sound such as [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[timbre]] and [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]]. In some cases, they also brought about a new approach to the role of soloists and their relation to the orchestra.

===Violin concertos===
{{unsourced section|date=May 2020}}
Two great innovators of early 20th-century music, [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]] and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], both wrote violin concertos. The material in Schoenberg's concerto, like that in [[Alban Berg|Berg's]], is linked by the [[twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone serial]] method. [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]], another major 20th-century composer, wrote two important concertos for violin. Russian composers [[Prokofiev]] and [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]] each wrote two concertos while [[Aram Khachaturian|Khachaturian]] wrote a concerto and a Concerto-Rhapsody for the instrument. [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]]'s concertos hark back to the forms of the 19th century, even if the harmonic language he used was different.

Three violin concertos from [[David Diamond (composer)|David Diamond]] show the form in neoclassical style.

In 1950 [[Carlos Chávez]] completed a substantial [[Violin Concerto (Chávez)|Violin Concerto]] with an enormous central cadenza for the unaccompanied violin.

More recently, [[Dutilleux]]'s ''L'Arbre des songes'' has proved an important addition to the repertoire and a fine example of the composer's atonal yet melodic style.

Other composers of major violin concertos include [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]], [[Samuel Barber]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[Peter Maxwell Davies]], [[Miguel del Aguila]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Cristóbal Halffter]], [[György Ligeti]], [[Frank Martin (composer)|Frank Martin]], [[Bohuslav Martinů]], [[Carl Nielsen]], [[Walter Piston]], [[Alfred Schnittke]], [[Jean Sibelius]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[William Walton]],
[[John Williams]] and [[Roger Sessions]].

===Cello concertos===
{{unsourced section|date=May 2020}}
In the 20th century, particularly after the Second World War, the cello enjoyed an unprecedented popularity. As a result, its concertante repertoire caught up with those of the piano and the violin both in terms of quantity and quality.

An important factor in this phenomenon was the rise of virtuoso cellist [[Mstislav Rostropovich]]. His outstanding technique and passionate playing prompted dozens of composers to write pieces for him, first in his native Soviet Union and then abroad. Among such compositions may be listed [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s [[Symphony-Concerto (Prokofiev)|Symphony-Concerto]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]'s two cello concertos, [[Benjamin Britten]]'s [[Cello Symphony (Britten)|Cello-Symphony]] (which emphasizes, as its title suggests, the equal importance of soloist and orchestra), [[Henri Dutilleux]]' ''[[Tout un monde lointain...]]'', [[Cristóbal Halffter]]'s two cello concertos, [[Witold Lutosławski]]'s cello concerto, [[Dmitry Kabalevsky]]'s two cello concertos, [[Aram Khachaturian]]'s ''Concerto-Rhapsody'', [[Arvo Pärt]]'s ''Pro et Contra'', [[Alfred Schnittke]], [[André Jolivet]] and [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] second cello concertos, [[Sofia Gubaidulina]]'s ''[[The Canticle of the Sun (Gubaidulina)|Canticles of the Sun]]'', [[Luciano Berio]]'s ''Ritorno degli Snovidenia'', [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s ''Three Meditations'', [[James MacMillan]]'s cello concerto and [[Olivier Messiaen]]'s ''[[Concert à quatre]]'' (a quadruple concerto for cello, piano, oboe, flute and orchestra).

In addition, several important composers who were not directly influenced by Rostropovich wrote cello concertos: [[Samuel Barber]], [[Elliott Carter]], [[Carlos Chávez]], [[Miguel del Aguila]], [[Alexander Glazunov]], [[Hans Werner Henze]], [[Paul Hindemith]], [[Arthur Honegger]], [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]], [[György Ligeti]], [[Bohuslav Martinů]], [[Darius Milhaud]], [[Nikolai Myaskovsky]], [[Einojuhani Rautavaara]], [[Joaquín Rodrigo]], [[Toru Takemitsu]], [[William Walton]], [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], and [[Bernd Alois Zimmermann]] for instance.

===Piano concertos===

[[Maurice Ravel]] wrote two pianos concertos, one in G-major (1931) and the second for the left hand in D-major (date of creation1932). [[Igor Stravinsky]] wrote three works for solo piano and orchestra: [[Concerto for Piano and Wind Instruments]], [[Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra]], and Movements for Piano and Orchestra. [[Sergei Prokofiev]], another Russian composer, wrote five piano concertos, which he himself performed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;!--Source verifying Prokofiev's performance of, in particular, the Fourth Concerto (for the left hand) needed.--&gt; [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] composed two. Fellow Soviet composer [[Aram Khachaturian]] contributed to the repertoire with a [[Piano Concerto (Khachaturian)|piano concerto]] and a Concerto-Rhapsody.

[[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s [[Piano Concerto (Schoenberg)|Piano Concerto]] is a well-known example of a [[dodecaphonic]] piano concerto.

[[Béla Bartók]] also wrote three piano concertos. Like their violin counterparts, they show the various stages in his musical development. Bartok's also rearranged his chamber piece, [[Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion]], into a ''Concerto for Two Pianos and Percussion'', adding orchestral accompaniment.

[[Cristóbal Halffter]] wrote a prize-winning neoclassical Piano Concerto in 1953, and a second Piano Concerto in 1987–88.

[[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] wrote a concerto for piano, though it was later reworked as a concerto for two pianos and orchestra—both versions have been recorded—while [[Benjamin Britten]]'s concerto for piano (1938) is a prominent work from his early period.

Important piano concertos by Latin-American composers included one by [[Piano Concerto (Chávez)|Carlos Chávez]], two by [[Alberto Ginastera]], and five by [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]].

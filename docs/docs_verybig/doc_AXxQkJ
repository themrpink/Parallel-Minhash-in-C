Petri dishes are widely used in biology to [[microbiological culture|cultivate]] microorganisms such as [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[yeast]]s, and [[Mold (fungus)|mold]]s.  It is most suited for organisms that thrive on a solid or semisolid surface.  

The [[growth medium|culture medium]] is often an [[agar plate]], a layer a few mm thick of [[agar]] or [[agarose]] [[hydrogel|gel]] containing whatever nutrients the organism requires (such as [[blood]], [[salt (chemistry)|salts]], [[carbohydrate]]s, [[amino acid]]s) and other desired ingredients (such as [[staining|dyes]], [[chemical indicator|indicators]], and [[medicinal drug]]s). The agar and other ingredients are dissolved in warm water and poured into the dish and left to cool down.  Once the medium solidifies, a sample of the organism is [[Inoculation|inoculated]] (&quot;plated&quot;).

The dishes are then left undisturbed for hours or days while the organism grows, possibly in an [[Incubator (culture)|incubator]].  They are usually covered, or placed upside-down, to lessen the risk of contamination from airborne [[spore]]s. 

[[Virus]] or [[phage]] cultures require that a population of bacteria be grown in the dish first, which then becomes the culture medium for the viral inoculum. 

While Petri dishes are widespread in microbiological research, smaller dishes tend to be used for large-scale studies in which growing cells in Petri dishes can be relatively expensive and labor-intensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gilbert, P.M. |title=Substrate elasticity regulates skeletal muscle stem cell self-renewal in culture|doi=10.1126/science.1191035 |journal=Science|volume= 329 |issue=5995|year=2010|pages=1078–81 |pmid=20647425 |pmc=2929271|bibcode=2010Sci...329.1078G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chowdhury, F.|title= Soft substrates promote homogeneous self-renewal of embryonic stem cells via downregulating cell-matrix tractions|journal=PLOS One |volume=5|issue= 12|pages= e15655 |year=2010|doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0015655|pmid=21179449|pmc=3001487

===Contamination detection and mapping===
Petri dishes can be used to visualize the location of contamination on surfaces, such as kitchen counters and utensils,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1078/S1438-4639(04)70035-8|pmid=11279821|title=Comparison of two sampling methods for the detection of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in the environment: Moistened swabs versus Rodac plates|journal=International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health|volume=203|issue=3|pages=245–48|year=2001|last1=Lemmen|first1=Sebastian W.|last2=Häfner|first2=Helga|last3=Zolldann|first3=Dirk|last4=Amedick|first4=Günter|last5=Lutticken|first5=Rüdolf}}&lt;/ref&gt; clothing, food preparation equipment, or animal and human skin.&lt;ref&gt;Kasia Galazka (2015): &quot;[https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kasiagalazka/petri-handprint Here's A Gorgeous Petri Dish Handprint Of An 8-Year-Old After He Played Outside]&quot;.

Accessed on 2019-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

For this application, the Petri dishes may be filled so that the culture medium protrudes slightly above the edges of the dish to make it easier to take samples on hard objects.  Shallow Petri dishes prepared in this way are called [[RODAC plate|Replicate Organism Detection And Counting (RODAC) plates]] and are available commercially.&lt;ref name=sutt2007&gt;Scott Sutton (2007): &quot;Microbial Surface Monitoring&quot;, p. 78.

===Cell culture===
Petri dishes are also used for [[cell culture|cell cultivation]] of isolated cells from [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organisms, such as in [[immunodiffusion]] studies, on solid agar or in a liquid medium.

===Botany and agriculture===
[[File:Physcomitrella_growing_on_agar_plates.jpg|thumb|Axenic [[Cell culture]] of the plant ''[[Physcomitrella patens]]'' on an [[agar]]plate in a Petri dish]]
Petri dishes may be used to observe the early stages of plant [[germination]], and to grow plants asexually from isolated cells.

===Entomology===
Petri dishes may be convenient enclosures to study the behavior of insects and other small animals.

===Chemistry===
Due to their large open surface, Petri dishes are effective containers to evaporate [[solvent]]s and dry out [[precipitate]]s, either at room temperature or in [[oven]]s and [[desiccator]]s.

===Sample storage and display===
Petri dishes also make convenient temporary storage for samples, especially liquid, granular, or powdered ones, and small objects such as insects or seeds.  Their transparency and flat profile allows the contents to be inspected with the naked eye, [[magnifying glass]], or low-power microscope without removing the lid.

==In popular culture==

The Petri dish is one of a small number of laboratory equipment items whose name entered popular culture.  It is often used metaphorically, e. g. for a contained community that is being studied as if they were microorganisms in a biology experiment, or an environment where original ideas and enterprises may flourish.&lt;ref name=&quot;merriam-webster.com/dictionary/petridish&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/petri%20dish |title = Definition of petri dish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sing2018&gt;Gary Singer (2018): &quot;[https://books.google.com.br/books?id=PmiCDwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT40&amp;pg=PT40#v=onepage&amp;f=false Sonder, in the City]&quot;.

[[File:Suntago massage.ogv|thumb|250px|Massage (video)]]
'''Massage''' is the manipulation of the body's soft tissues. Massage techniques are commonly applied with hands, fingers, elbows, knees, forearms, feet, or a device. The purpose of massage is generally for the treatment of body stress or pain. A person [[professionally]] trained to give massages is traditionally known as a '''masseur''' (male) or a '''masseuse''' (female). In the United States, the title '''massage therapist''' has been recognized as a business norm for those who have been professionally trained to give massages.

In professional settings, clients are treated while lying on a [[massage table]], sitting in a [[massage chair]], or lying on a mat on the floor. In amateur settings, a general purpose surface like a bed or the floor is more common. ''Aquatic'' massage and [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]] is performed with recipients submersed or floating in a warm-water [[therapy]] pool.

== Etymology ==
The word comes from the French ''massage'' &quot;friction of kneading&quot;, which, in turn, comes from the Arabic word مَسَّ ''massa'' meaning &quot;to touch, feel&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/massage|title=Definition of MASSAGE | date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/massage|title=the definition of massage | date=|website=www.dictionary.com}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

Others claim an origin from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''amassar'' &quot;knead&quot;, from the [[Latin]] ''[[wiktionary:massa#Latin|massa]]'' meaning &quot;mass, dough&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=massage |title=Online Etymology Dictionary, massage |publisher=Etymonline.com |access-date=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Greek language|Greek]] verb [[wiktionary:μάσσω|μάσσω]] (''massō'') &quot;to handle, touch, to work with the hands, to knead dough&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dma%2Fssw μάσσω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; In distinction the [[ancient Greek]] word for massage was ''[[wiktionary:anatripsis|anatripsis]]'',&lt;ref name=Noah&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KEyOi-KN0rgC&amp;q=massage+etymology&amp;pg=PA2| title = The History of Massage: An Illustrated Survey from Around the World | vauthors = Calvert R | publisher = Healing Arts Press| date = 1 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Latin was ''[[wiktionary:frictio|frictio]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Iorio |first1=Silvia |last2=Gazzaniga |first2=Valentina |last3=Marinozz i|first3=Silvia | name-list-style = vanc |date=2018-08-30|title=Healing bodies: the ancient origins of massages and Roman practices |url= http://mattioli1885journals.com/index.php/MedHistor/article/view/7473 |journal=Medicina Historica |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=58–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Thai massage.jpg|thumb|right|Drawings of [[acupressure]] points on [[Sen line]]s at [[Wat Pho]] temple in [[Thailand]]]]

=== Ancient times ===
Archaeological evidence of massage has been found in many ancient civilizations including [[China]], [[India]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], [[Greece]], and [[Mesopotamia]].

BC 2330: The Tomb of Akmanthor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Akmanthor.jpg |title=File:Akmanthor.jpg&amp;nbsp;— Wikimedia Commons |publisher=Commons.wikimedia.org |access-date=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as &quot;The Tomb of the Physician&quot;) in [[Saqqara]], Egypt, depicts two men having work done on their feet and hands, possibly massage.
[[File:Akmanthor.jpg|thumb|Akmanthor]]

BC 2000: The word ''muššu'u'' (&quot;massage&quot;) is written for the first time, and its use is described, in some Sumerian and Akkadian texts found at the beginning of the 21st century in ancient Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.erotischemassage.com/|title=Massage history}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BC 722–481: ''[[Huangdi Neijing]]'' is composed during the Chinese [[Spring and Autumn period]]. The Nei-jing is a compilation of medical knowledge known up to that date, and is the foundation of traditional Chinese medicine. Massage is referred to in 30 different chapters of the Nei Jing. It specifies the use of different massage techniques and how they should be used in the treatment of specific ailments, and injuries. Also known as &quot;The Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon&quot;, the text refers to previous medical knowledge from the time of the [[Yellow Emperor]] (approx 2700 BC), misleading some into believing the text itself was written during the time of the Yellow Emperor (which would predate written history).&lt;ref&gt;1895, ''The Art of Massage'', by J. H. Kellogg MD (page 9)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2002, ''The History of Massage'', by Robert Noah Calvert (page 35).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2003, ''Careers in Alternative Medicine'', by Alan Steinfeld (page 48).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Claire /&gt;

BC 762 &quot;In the Iliad and the Odyssey the massage with oils and aromatic substances is mentioned as a means to relax the tired limbs of warriors and a way to help the treatment of wounds.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

BC 500 [[Jīvaka |Jīvaka Komarabhācca]]. According to the Pāli [[Buddhist]] Canon, Jivaka was [[Shakyamuni Buddha]]'s physician. Jivaka is mistakenly credited with founding and developing a style of massage that led to the type of massage practiced in current-day Thailand. He was a doctor and a surgeon, but not a massage therapist.

AD 581: [[Sun Simiao|Dr Sun Si Miao]] introduces ten new massage techniques and systematized the treatment of childhood diseases using massage therapy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

AD 581: China establishes a department of massage therapy within the Office of Imperial Physicians.

===Middle Ages===
Medical knowledge, including that of massage, made its way from Rome to Persia in the Middle Ages.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} Many of Galen's manuscripts, for instance, were collected and translated by Hunayn ibn Ishaq in the 9th century. Later in the 11th century copies were translated back into Latin, and again in the 15th and 16th centuries, when they helped enlighten European scholars as to the achievements of the Ancient Greeks. This renewal of the Galenic tradition during the Renaissance played a very important part in the rise of modern science.

One of the greatest Persian medics was [[Avicenna]], also known as Ibn Sina, who lived from 980 AD to 1037 AD. His works included a comprehensive collection and systematisation of the fragmentary and unorganised Greco-Roman medical literature that had been translated Arabic by that time, augmented by notes from his own experiences. One of his books, ''Al-Qānūn fī aṭ-Ṭibb'' (The Canon of Medicine) has been called the most famous single book in the history of medicine in both East and West. Avicenna excelled in the logical assessment of conditions and comparison of symptoms and took special note of analgesics and their proper use as well as other methods of relieving pain, including massage.

AD 1150: Evidence of massage abortion, involving the application of pressure to the pregnant [[abdomen]], can be found in one of the [[bas relief]]s decorating the temple of [[Angkor Wat]] in [[Cambodia]]. It depicts a [[demon]] performing such an abortion upon a woman who has been sent to the [[underworld]]. This is the oldest known visual representation of abortion.&lt;ref name=&quot;potts&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Potts |first1=Malcolm |last2=Campbell |first2= Martha |name-list-style=vanc |date=2002 |chapter-url=http://big.berkeley.edu/ifplp.history.pdf |chapter=History of contraception |title=Gynecology and Obstetrics |volume=6 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217025152/http://big.berkeley.edu/ifplp.history.pdf |archive-date=17 December 2008 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th and 19th centuries===
AD 1776: [[Jean Joseph Marie Amiot]], and [[Pierre-Martial Cibot]], French missionaries in China translate summaries of [[Huangdi Neijing]], including a list of medical plants, exercises and elaborate massage techniques, into the French language, thereby introducing Europe to the highly developed Chinese system of medicine, medical-gymnastics, and medical-massage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Claire&quot; /&gt;

AD 1776 [[Pehr Henrik Ling]], a Swedish physical therapist, and teacher of medical-gymnastics is born. Ling has often been erroneously credited for having invented &quot;Classic Massage&quot; aka &quot;Swedish Massage&quot;, and has been called the &quot;Father of Massage&quot;.&lt;ref name=Calvert&gt;{{cite web|last=Calvert|first=Robert Noah |name-list-style=vanc |title=Swedish Massage|url=http://www.massagemag.com/Magazine/2002/issue100/history100.php|publisher=Massage Magazine|access-date=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AD 1779: Frenchman [[Pierre-Martial Cibot]] publishes &quot;Notice du Cong-fou des Bonzes Tao-see&quot; also known as &quot;The Cong-Fou of the Tao-Tse&quot;, a French language summary of medical techniques used by Taoist priests. According to Joseph Needhan, Cibot's work &quot;was intended to present the physicists and physicians of Europe with a sketch of a system of medical gymnastics which they might like to adopt—or if they found it at fault they might be stimulated to invent something better. This work has long been regarded as of cardinal importance in the history of physiotherapy because it almost certainly influenced the Swedish founder of the modern phase of the art, Per Hendrik Ling. Cibot had studied at least one Chinese book, but also got much from a Christian neophyte who had become expert in the subject before his conversion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Science and Civilization in China'' by Joseph Needham, Vol. 5, page 17&lt;/ref&gt;

AD 1813 The Royal Gymnastic Central Institute for the training of gymnastic instructors was opened in Stockholm, Sweden, with [[Pehr Henrik Ling]] appointed as principal. Ling developed what he called the &quot;Swedish Movement Cure.&quot; Ling died in 1839, having previously named his pupils as the repositories of his teaching. Ling and his assistants left little proper written account of their methods.&lt;ref name=Claire /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1886: [[Chambers's Journal of Popular Literature, Science, and Art|Chamber's Journal of Popular Literature, Science and Arts]], Volume 3 By William Chambers, Robert Chambers (page 594).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ottosson&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ottosson A |s2cid=205633105 |title=The first historical movements of kinesiology: scientification in the borderline between physical culture and medicine around 1850 |journal=The International Journal of the History of Sport |volume=27 |issue=11 |pages=1892–1919 |year=2010 |pmid=20653114 |doi=10.1080/09523367.2010.491618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AD 1878: Dutch massage practitioner Johan Georg Mezger applies French terms to name five basic massage techniques,&lt;ref name=Calvert /&gt; and coins the phrase &quot;Swedish massage system&quot;. These techniques are still known by their French names (effleurage (long, gliding strokes), petrissage (lifting and kneading the muscles), friction (firm, deep, circular rubbing movements), tapotement (brisk tapping or percussive movements), and vibration (rapidly shaking or vibrating specific muscles)).

==== China ====
Massage in China is an extremely popular therapy, the city of [[Shanghai]] alone playing host to over 1500 foot massage centers while there are more than 3000 in [[Shenzhen]].

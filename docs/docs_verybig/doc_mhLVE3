:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = \begin{pmatrix}
\varepsilon_1 &amp; + i g_z &amp; 0 \\
 - i g_z &amp; \varepsilon_1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \varepsilon_2 \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Most commonly, one considers light propagating in the ''z'' direction (parallel to '''g''').  In this case the solutions are elliptically polarized electromagnetic waves with [[phase velocity|phase velocities]] &lt;math&gt;1 / \sqrt{\mu(\varepsilon_1 \pm g_z)}&lt;/math&gt; (where μ is the [[magnetic permeability]]).  This difference in phase velocities leads to the Faraday effect.

For light propagating purely perpendicular to the axis of gyration, the properties are known as the [[Cotton-Mouton effect]] and used for a [[Circulator]].

===Kerr Rotation and Kerr Ellipticity===
Kerr Rotation and Kerr Ellipticity are changes in the polarization of incident light which comes in contact with a gyromagnetic material. Kerr Rotation is a rotation in the plane of polarization of transmitted light, and Kerr Ellipticity is the ratio of the major to minor axis of the ellipse traced out by [[Elliptical polarization|elliptically]] polarized light on the plane through which it propagates. Changes in the orientation of polarized incident light can be quantified using these two properties.

[[Image:Circular.Polarization.Circularly.Polarized.Light With.Components Right.Handed.svg|thumb|Circular Polarized Light]]
According to classical physics, the speed of light varies with the permittivity of a material:

&lt;math&gt;v_p = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon \mu}} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v_p&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of light through the material, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the material permittivity, and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the material permeability.  Because the permittivity is anisotropic, polarized light of different orientations will travel at different speeds.

This can be better understood if we consider a wave of light that is circularly polarized (seen to the right). If this wave interacts with a material at which the horizontal component (green sinusoid) travels at a different speed than the vertical component (blue sinusoid), the two components will fall out of the 90 degree phase difference (required for circular polarization) changing the Kerr Ellipticity

A change in Kerr Rotation is most easily recognized in linearly polarized light, which can be separated into two [[Circular polarization|Circularly polarized]] components: Left-Handed Circular Polarized (LCP) light and Right-Handed Circular Polarized (RCP) light. The anisotropy of the Magneto Optic material permittivity causes a difference in the speed of LCP and RCP light, which will cause a change in the angle of polarized light. Materials that exhibit this property are known as [[Birefringence|Birefringent]].

From this rotation, we can calculate the difference in orthogonal velocity components, find the anisotropic permittivity, find the gyration vector, and calculate the applied magnetic field&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garcia-Merino |first1=J.

[[File:&quot;Marine Cpl. Robert L. Hardin...checks the main distributing frame in Montford Point's headquarters for line difficultie - NARA - 532515.jpg|thumb|Small, single-sided MDF for a military base]]
[[File:Jarretiere telephonie.jpg|thumb|Modern main distribution frame]]
In [[telephony]], a '''main distribution frame''' ('''MDF''' or '''main frame''') is a signal [[distribution frame]] for connecting equipment ([[inside plant]]) to cables and [[pair gain|subscriber carrier]] equipment ([[outside plant]]). 

==Overview==
The MDF is a termination point within the local [[telephone exchange]] where exchange equipment and terminations of [[local loop]]s are connected by jumper wires at the MDF.  All cable copper pairs supplying services through [[User (telecommunications)|user]] [[telephone line]]s are terminated at the MDF and distributed through the MDF to equipment within the local exchange e.g. [[repeater]]s and [[DSLAM]].  Cables to [[intermediate distribution frame]]s (IDF) terminate at the MDF.  [[trunk (telecommunications)|Trunk]] cables may terminate on the same MDF or on a separate trunk main distribution frame (TMDF).

Like other [[distribution frame]]s the MDF provides flexibility in assigning facilities, at lower cost and higher capacity than a [[patch panel]].

The most common kind of large MDF is a long steel rack accessible from both sides. On one side, [[Electrical wiring|termination]] blocks are arranged horizontally at the front of rack shelves.  Jumpers lie on the shelves and go through an insulated steel hoop to run vertically to other termination blocks that are arranged vertically.  There is a hoop or ring at the intersection of each level and each vertical.  Installing a jumper historically required two workers, one on either side of the MDF. The shelves are shallow enough to allow the rings to be within arm's reach, but the workers prefer to hang the jumper on a hook on a pole so their partner can pull it through the ring.  A fanning strip at the back of each termination block prevents the wires from covering each other's terminals.  With disciplined administration, the MDF can hold over a hundred thousand jumpers, with dozens changed every day, for decades without tangling.

The MDF usually holds [[telephone exchange]] protective devices including [[heat coil]]s, and functions as a [[test point]] between a line and the exchange equipment. 

== History ==
[[File:American telephone practice (1905) (14733380746).jpg|thumb|MDF newly installed in a large urban exchange, early 20th century, no jumpers yet]]
Before 1960, MDF jumpers were generally [[soldering|solder]]ed.  This was reliable but slow and expensive.  [[Wire wrap]] was introduced in the 1960s, and [[punch block]]s in the 1970s. In most exchanges in the UK, soldered blocks are still in use, but are being slowly phased out.

Each jumper is a [[twisted pair]].  Middle 20th century jumper wires in the USA were 24 [[American wire gauge|AWG]] single strand copper, with a soft [[polyethylene]] inner jacket and a cotton wrapper, impregnated to make it slightly brittle and easy to remove neatly.  Late 20th century ones had a single, thicker coating of [[Cross-linked polyethylene|polyethylene cross-linked]] to provide a suitable degree of brittleness.

Some urban telephone exchange MDFs are two stories high so they do not have to be more than a city block long.  A few are three stories. Access to the upper levels can be either by a traveling ladder attached to the MDF, or by mezzanine walkways at a suitable height. By British custom the cables to the outside world are terminated on the horizontal side, and the indoors equipment on the vertical side. American usage is the opposite.

Smaller MDFs, and some modern large ones, are single sided so one worker can install, remove or change a jumper.  [[COSMOS (Telecommunications)|COSMOS]] and other computerized [[Operations Support Systems]] help by assigning terminals close to one another, so most jumpers need not be long and shelves on either type of MDF do not become congested.  This database keeps track of all terminals and jumpers.  In the early and middle 20th century these records were kept as pencil entries in ledger books.  The later database method saves much labor by permitting old jumpers to be reused for new lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MDF Jumpering|url=https://mrtelco.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adoption of [[distributed switching]] in the late 20th century diminished the need for large, active, central MDFs.

Sometimes the MDF is combined with other kinds of [[distribution frame]] in a [[Combined distribution frame|CDF]].

The MDF in a [[private branch exchange]] performs functions similar to those performed by the MDF in a central office.

[[Automated Main Distribution Frame]] (AMDF) has been a subject of experiments.

In a [[antenna (electronics)|radio antenna's]] [[radiation pattern]], the '''main lobe''', or '''main beam,''' is the [[Side lobe|lobe]] containing the higher [[Power (physics)|power]]. This is the lobe that exhibits the greater [[field strength]].

The radiation pattern of most antennas shows a pattern of &quot;''lobes''&quot; at various angles, directions where the radiated signal strength reaches a maximum, separated by &quot;''[[null (radio)|null]]s''&quot;, angles at which the radiation falls to zero.  In a [[directional antenna]] in which the objective is to emit the radio waves in one direction, the lobe in that direction is designed to have higher field strength than the others, so on a graph of the radiation pattern it appears biggest; this is the main lobe.  The other lobes are called &quot;''[[sidelobe]]s''&quot;, and usually represent unwanted radiation in undesired directions.  The sidelobe in the opposite direction from the main lobe is called the &quot;''backlobe''&quot;. 

The radiation pattern referred to above is usually the horizontal radiation pattern, which is plotted as a function of [[azimuth]] about the antenna, although the vertical radiation pattern may also have a main lobe.   The [[beamwidth]] of the antenna is the width of the main lobe, usually specified by the ''[[half power beam width]]'' (HPBW),  the angle encompassed between the points on the side of the lobe where the power has fallen to half (-3 [[decibel|dB]]) of its maximum value.

The concepts of main lobe and sidelobes also apply to [[acoustics]] and [[optics]], and are used to describe the radiation pattern of optical systems like [[telescope]]s, and acoustic transducers like [[microphone]]s and [[loudspeaker]]s.

In [[engineering]], '''maintainability''' is the ease with which a product can be maintained in order to:
* correct defects or their cause,
* repair or replace faulty or worn-out components without having to replace still working parts,
* prevent unexpected working conditions,
* maximize a product's useful life,
* maximize efficiency, reliability, and safety,
* meet new [[requirements]],
* make future maintenance easier, or
* cope with a changed environment.

In some cases, maintainability involves a system of [[continuous improvement]] - learning from the past in order to improve the ability to maintain systems, or improve reliability of systems based on maintenance experience.

In [[telecommunication]] and several other engineering fields, the term '''maintainability''' has the following meanings:

* A characteristic of design and installation, expressed as the probability that an item will be retained in or restored to a specified condition within a given period of [[time]], when the [[repair and maintenance|maintenance]] is performed in accordance with prescribed procedures and resources.
* The ease with which maintenance of a [[functional unit]] can be performed in accordance with prescribed requirements.

== Software engineering ==
In [[software engineering]], these activities are known as [[software maintenance]] (cf. [[ISO/IEC 9126]]). Closely related concepts in the software engineering domain are evolvability, modifiability, [[Technical debt|technical debt]], and [[Code smell|code smells]].

The maintainability index is calculated with certain formulae from [[Lines of code|lines-of-code measures]], [[McCabe Measure|McCabe measures]] and [[Halstead complexity measures]].

The measurement and track of maintainability are intended to help reduce or reverse a system's tendency toward &quot;code entropy&quot; or degraded integrity, and to indicate when it becomes cheaper and/or less risky to rewrite the code than it is to change it.

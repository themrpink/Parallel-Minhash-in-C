===Horizontal sliding sash===
A horizontal sliding sash window has two or more sashes that overlap slightly but slide horizontally within the frame. In the UK, these are sometimes called [[Yorkshire]] sash windows, presumably because of their traditional use in that county.

===Casement===
{{main|Casement window}}
[[File:Gordijnen aan venster.JPG|thumb|[[Casement window]]]]

A casement window is a window with a hinged sash that swings in or out like a door comprising either a side-hung, top-hung (also called &quot;awning window&quot;; see below), or occasionally bottom-hung sash or a combination of these types, sometimes with fixed panels on one or more sides of the sash.&lt;ref name=&quot;Window&quot;/&gt; In the USA, these are usually opened using a [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]], but in parts of Europe they tend to use projection friction stays and [[espagnolette]] locking. Formerly, plain hinges were used with a [[casement stay]]. [[Handing]] applies to casement windows to determine direction of swing; a casement window may be left-handed, right-handed, or double. The casement window is the dominant type now found in modern buildings in the UK and many other parts of Europe.

====Awning====
[[File:Fenêtre à l'australienne - Awning window - (AWS Magnum 616) Light.jpg|thumb|upright|Awning window]]
An awning window is a casement window that is hung horizontally, [[hinge]]d on top, so that it swings outward like an [[awning]]. In addition to be used independently, they can be stacked, several in one opening, or combined with fixed glass. They are particularly useful for ventilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Window Treatments | first=Karla J. | last=Nielson | page=45 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y6U0uP5cyLQC&amp;q=%22awning+window%22&amp;pg=PA45 | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | date=Sep 15, 1989 | isbn=0471289469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hopper====
A hopper window is a bottom-pivoting casement window that opens by tilting vertically, typically to the inside, resembling a [[Hopper (particulate collection container)|hopper]] chute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=Edward|last2=Thallon|first2=Rob|title=Fundamentals of Residential Construction|edition=3|year=2011|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0-470-54083-1|page=654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pivot===
A pivot window is a window hung on one hinge on each of two opposite sides which allows the window to revolve when opened. The hinges may be mounted top and bottom  (Vertically Pivoted) or at each jamb (Horizontally Pivoted). The window will usually open initially to a restricted position for ventilation and, once released, fully reverse and lock again for safe cleaning from inside. Modern pivot hinges incorporate a friction device to hold the window open against its own weight and may have restriction and reversed locking built in. In the UK, where this type of window is most common, they were extensively installed in high-rise social housing.

===Tilt and slide===
A tilt and slide window is a window (more usually a door-sized window) where the sash tilts inwards at the top and then slides horizontally behind the fixed pane.

====Tilt and turn====
A tilt and turn window can both tilt inwards at the top or open inwards from hinges at the side. This is the most common type of window in Germany, its country of origin. It is also widespread in many other European countries. In Europe it is usual for these to be of the &quot;turn first&quot; type. i.e. when the handle is turned to 90 degrees the window opens in the side hung mode. With the handle turned to 180 degrees the window opens in bottom hung mode. Most usually in the UK the windows will be &quot;tilt first&quot; i.e. bottom hung at 90 degrees for ventilation and side hung at 180 degrees for cleaning the outer face of the glass from inside the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windowanddoor.com/article/products/will-tilt-and-turn-windows-gain-market-share-north-america?page=0%2C1 |title=Will Tilt-and-Turn Windows Gain Market Share in North America? &amp;#124; Window &amp; Door |publisher=Windowanddoor.com |date=March 29, 2010 |accessdate=February 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transom===
A window above a door; in an exterior door the [[Transom (architectural)|transom]] window is often fixed, in an interior door it can open either by hinges at top or bottom, or rotate on hinges. It provided ventilation before forced air heating and cooling. A fan-shaped transom is known as a fanlight, especially in the British Isles.

===Side light===
Windows beside a door or window are called side-, wing-, margen-lights, and flanking windows.&lt;ref&gt;Curl, James Stevens. &quot;Flanking window&quot;. ''A dictionary of architecture and landscape architecture''. 2nd ed. Oxford England: Oxford University Press, 2006. 285. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jalousie window===
[[File:Jalousie2.jpg|thumb|Jalousie or [[louver]]ed window]]

Also known as a [[louver]]ed window, the [[jalousie window]] consists of parallel slats of glass or [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]] that open and close like a [[Venetian blind]], usually using a crank or a lever. They are used extensively in tropical architecture. A jalousie door is a door with a jalousie window.

===Clerestory===
{{main|Clerestory}}
A clerestory window is a window set in a [[roof]] structure or high in a wall, used for [[daylighting]].

===Skylight===
{{main|Daylighting}}
[[File:BurlingtonHousePavementWindow.jpg|thumbnail|Sidewalk skylight (also named '[[pavement light]]') outside [[Burlington House]], [[London]]]]

A skylight is a window built into a roof structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TopgKO4x_2kC&amp;q=skylight+is+window+built+into+roof&amp;pg=PA223|title=Construction Estimating Reference Data|last=Sarviel|first=Ed|date=1993|publisher=Craftsman Book Company|isbn=9780934041843|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of window allows for natural daylight and moonlight.

===Roof===
[[File:EdenProjectRoof.jpg|thumbnail|Hexagonal external cladding panels of roof in [[Eden Project]] Biomes ([[Cornwall]], England)]]
A sloped window used for [[daylighting]], built into a roof structure. It is one of the few windows that could be used as an exit. Larger [[roof window]]s meet building codes for emergency evacuation.

===Roof lantern===
{{main|Roof lantern}}
A roof lantern is a multi-paned glass structure, resembling a small building, built on a roof for day or moon light. Sometimes includes an additional [[clerestory]]. May also be called a [[cupola]].

===Bay===
{{main|Bay window}}
A bay window is a multi-panel window, with at least three panels set at different angles to create a protrusion from the wall line.&lt;ref name=&quot;Window&quot;/&gt;

====Oriel====
{{main|Oriel window}}
This form of bay window most often appears in Tudor-style houses and monasteries. It projects from the wall and does not extend to the ground. Originally a form of porch, they are often supported by brackets or corbels.

===Thermal===
{{main|Diocletian window}}
Thermal, or Diocletian, windows are large semicircular windows (or niches) which are usually divided into three lights (window compartments) by two mullions. The central compartment is often wider than the two side lights on either side of it.

===Picture===
A picture window is a large fixed window in a wall, typically without glazing bars, or glazed with only perfunctory glazing bars ([[muntin]]s) near the edge of the window. Picture windows provide an unimpeded view, as if framing a picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/picture+window |title=Picture window |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multi-lite===
A multi-lite window is a window glazed with small panes of glass separated by wooden or lead ''glazing bars'', or ''[[muntins]]'', arranged in a decorative ''glazing pattern'' often dictated by the building's architectural style. Due to the historic unavailability of large panes of glass, the multi-lit (or ''lattice window'') was the most common window style until the beginning of the 20th century, and is still used in traditional architecture.

===Emergency exit/egress===
An emergency exit window is a window big enough and low enough so that occupants can escape through the opening in an emergency, such as a [[fire]]. In many countries, exact specifications for emergency windows in bedrooms are given in many [[building codes]]. Specifications for such windows may also allow for the entrance of emergency rescuers. Vehicles, such as [[bus]]es and [[aircraft]], frequently have emergency exit windows as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/documents/outreach/bus/PreTrip-SafetyBrochure-Pull.pdf |title=U.S. Dept. of Transportation: Safety information for bus/motorcoach passengers |accessdate=February 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stained glass===
{{main|Stained glass}}
[[File:Nasir-al molk -1.jpg|thumb|left|Sunlight shining through stained glass, [[Nasir-ol-molk Mosque]], [[Shiraz]], Iran]]
A stained glass window is a window composed of pieces of colored glass, [[transparency (optics)|transparent, translucent]] or [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]], frequently portraying persons or scenes. Typically the glass in these windows is separated by lead glazing bars. Stained glass windows were popular in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] houses and some [[Frank Lloyd Wright|Wrightian]] houses, and are especially common in [[Church (building)|churches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/stained+glass+window|title=Stained glass |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===French===

French windows are known as ''porte-fenêtre'' in France and ''portafinestra'' in Italy, and frequently are used in modern houses.

{{clear|left}}

===Double-paned===
{{Main|Insulated glazing}}
Double-paned windows have two parallel panes (slabs of glass) with a separation of typically about 1&amp;nbsp;cm; this space is permanently sealed and filled at the time of manufacture with dry air or other dry nonreactive gas. Such windows provide a marked improvement in thermal insulation (and usually in acoustic insulation as well) and are resistant to fogging and frosting caused by temperature differential. They are widely used for residential and commercial construction in intemperate climates. Triple-paned windows have been commercially manufactured and marketed with claims of additional benefit but have not become common. In the UK double-paned and triple-paned are referred to as double-glazing and triple-glazing.

===Hexagonal window===
{{main|Hexagonal window}}

A hexagonal window is a hexagon-shaped window, resembling a bee cell or crystal lattice of graphite. The window can be vertically or horizontally oriented, openable or dead. It can also be regular or elongately-shaped and can have a separator ([[mullion]]). Typically, the cellular window is used for an attic or as a decorative feature, but it can also be a major architectural element to provide the natural lighting inside buildings.

==Terms==
EN 12519 is the European standard that describes windows terms officially used in EU Member States.
The main terms are:
[[File:Casement (PSF).jpg|thumb|Casement window, with [[Latticework|latticed]] lights]]
* '''Light''', or '''Lite''', is the area between the outer parts of a window ([[Transom (architectural)|transom]], sill and jambs), usually filled with a glass pane.  Multiple panes are divided by [[mullion]]s when load-bearing, [[muntin]]s when not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brett |first=Peter |year=2004 |title=Carpentry and Joinery |edition=2, illustrated |publisher=Nelson Thornes |isbn=9780748785025 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=iVthU6rPGK8C&amp;pg=PA225#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 255]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Lattice light''' is a compound window pane madeup of small pieces of glass held together in a [[Latticework|lattice]].
* '''Fixed window''' is a unit of one non-moving lite. The terms ''single-light'', ''double-light'', etc., refer to the number of these glass panes in a window.
* '''Sash unit''' is a window consisting of at least one sliding glass component, typically composed of two lites (known as a ''double-light'').
* '''Replacement window''' in the United States means a framed window designed to slip inside the original window frame from the inside after the old sashes are removed. In Europe it usually means a complete window including a replacement outer frame.
* '''New construction window''', in the US, means a window with a nailing fin that is inserted into a rough opening from the outside before applying siding and inside trim. A nailing fin is a projection on the outer frame of the window in the same plane as the [[glazing in architecture|glazing]], which overlaps the prepared opening, and can thus be 'nailed' into place.

:In the UK and mainland Europe, windows in new-build houses are usually fixed with long screws into expanding plastic plugs in the brickwork.  A gap of up to 13 mm is left around all four sides, and filled with expanding [[polyurethane foam]].  This makes the window fixing weatherproof but allows for expansion due to heat.
* '''[[Lintel]]''' is a beam over the top of a window, also known as a [[transom (architectural)|transom]].
* '''[[Window sill]]''' is the bottom piece in a window frame. Window sills slant outward to drain water away from the inside of the building.
* '''Secondary glazing''' is an additional frame applied to the inside of an existing frame, usually used on protected or listed buildings to achieve higher levels of thermal and sound insulation without compromising the look of the building
* '''[[Millwork (building material)|Decorative millwork]]''' is the moulding, cornices and lintels often decorating the surrounding edges of the window.

===Labeling===
The United States [[National Fenestration Rating Council|NFRC]] Window Label lists the following terms:
* [[Thermal conductivity|Thermal transmittance (U-factor)]], best values are around U-0.15 (equal to 0.8 W/m2/K)
* [[Solar heat gain coefficient]] (SHGC), ratio of solar heat (infrared) passing through the glass to incident solar heat
* [[Visible transmittance]] (VT), ratio of transmitted visible light divided by incident visible light
* [[airflow|Air leakage]] (AL), measured in cubic foot per minute per linear foot of crack between sash and frame
* [[Damp (structural)#Condensation|Condensation resistance]] (CR), measured between 1 and 100 (the higher the number, the higher the resistance of the formation of condensation)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfrc.org/documents/WindowsandHeatLoss.pdf Windows and Heat Loss], [[NFRC]] Heat Loss Fact Sheet&lt;/ref&gt;

The European harmonised standard hEN 14351-1, which deals with doors and windows, defines 23 characteristics (divided into ''essential'' and ''non ''essential''. Two other, preliminary European Norms that are under development deal with internal pedestrian doors (prEN 14351-2), smoke and fire resisting doors, and openable windows (prEN 16034).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.alueurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/CPR_guideline_Dec_2012_ver-1.pdf |title=CPR guideline |access-date=February 13, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106070925/http://www.alueurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/CPR_guideline_Dec_2012_ver-1.pdf |archive-date=November 6, 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
[[File:Passivhaus Fenster Beispiele (blank).svg|thumb|Examples of modern plastic and wooden window profiles with [[insulated glazing]]]]

Windows can be a significant source of heat transfer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Window Systems&quot;&gt;Carmody, J., Selkowitz, S., Lee, E. S., Arasteh, D., &amp; Willmert, T. (2004). ''Window Systems for High-Performance Buildings''. New York, NY: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, [[Insulated glazing|insulated glazing units]] consist of two or more panes to reduce the transfer of heat.

===Grids or muntins===

These are the pieces of framing that separate a larger window into smaller panes.  In older windows, large panes of glass were quite expensive, so muntins let smaller panes fill a larger space. In modern windows, light-colored muntins still provide a useful function by reflecting some of the light going through the window, making the window itself a source of diffuse light (instead of just the surfaces and objects illuminated within the room).  By increasing the indirect illumination of surfaces near the window, muntins tend to brighten the area immediately around a window and reduce the contrast of shadows within the room.

===Frame and sash construction===

Frames and sashes can be made of the following materials:

:*PVC and fiberglass frames perform well in accelerated weathering tests. Because PVC is not as strong as other materials, some PVC frames are reinforced with metal or composite materials to improve their structural strength.
:**Modern aluminium window frames are typically separated by a [[thermal break]] made of a glass fibre reinforced polyamide. With a 34&amp;nbsp;mm thermal insulation profile it is possible to reach Uf= 1.3&amp;nbsp;W/m²K for a metal window. This greatly increases thermal resistance, while retaining virtually all of the structural strength.

[[composite material|Composites]] (also known as Hybrid Windows) are start since early 1998 and combine materials like aluminium + pvc or wood to obtain aesthetics of one material with the functional benefits of another.
[[File:Bleekman zimmer.jpg|thumb|A typical installation of insulated glazing windows with uPVC window frames.]]

===Glazing and filling===

[[Low-emissivity]] coated panes reduce heat transfer by [[radiation]], which, depending on which surface is coated, helps prevent heat loss (in cold climates) or heat gains (in warm climates).

High thermal resistance can be obtained by evacuating or filling the insulated glazing units with gases such as [[argon]] or [[krypton]], which reduces [[Heat conduction|conductive]] heat transfer due to their low thermal conductivity. Performance of such units depends on good window seals and meticulous frame construction to prevent entry of air and loss of efficiency.

Modern double-pane and triple-pane windows often include one or more low-e coatings to reduce the window's U-factor (its insulation value, specifically its rate of heat loss). In general, soft-coat low-e coatings tend to result in a lower solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) than hard-coat low-e coatings.

Modern windows are usually glazed with one large sheet of glass per sash, while windows in the past were glazed with multiple panes separated by ''glazing bars'', or ''muntins'', due to the unavailability of large sheets of glass. Today, glazing bars tend to be decorative, separating windows into small panes of glass even though larger panes of glass are available, generally in a pattern dictated by the architectural style at use. Glazing bars are typically wooden, but occasionally lead glazing bars soldered in place are used for more intricate glazing patterns.

===Other construction details===

Many windows have movable [[window covering]]s such as [[blinds]] or [[curtain]]s to keep out light, provide additional insulation, or ensure privacy.
Windows allow natural light to enter, but too much can have negative effects such as glare and heat gain. Additionally, while windows let the user see outside, there must be a way to maintain privacy on in the inside.&lt;ref name=&quot;Design Evaluation Project&quot;&gt;Howell, Sandra C. (1976). ''Designing for the Elderly; Windows''. Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Department of Architecture.

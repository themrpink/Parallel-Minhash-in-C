====Stereographic coordinate system====
{{Further|Stereographic projection}}

During medieval times, the stereographic coordinate system was used for navigation purposes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} The stereographic coordinate system was superseded by the latitude-longitude system. Although no longer used in navigation, the stereographic coordinate system is still used in modern times to describe crystallographic orientations in the fields of [[crystallography]], [[mineralogy]] and materials science.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Vertical coordinates include height and depth.

==3D Cartesian coordinates==
{{Further|Axes conventions}}

Every point that is expressed in ellipsoidal coordinates can be expressed as an rectilinear {{nowrap|x y z}} ([[Cartesian coordinate|Cartesian]]) coordinate. Cartesian coordinates simplify many mathematical calculations. The Cartesian systems of different datums are not equivalent.&lt;ref name=Taylor2002/&gt;

===Earth-centered, Earth-fixed===
[[File:ECEF.svg|alt=Earth Centered, Earth Fixed coordinates|thumb|upright=1.3|Earth centered, Earth fixed coordinates in relation to latitude and longitude.]]
{{Main|ECEF}}

The [[ECEF|Earth-centered Earth-fixed]] (also known as the ECEF, ECF, or conventional terrestrial coordinate system) rotates with the Earth and has its origin at the center of the Earth.

The conventional right-handed coordinate system puts:
* The origin at the center of mass of the Earth, a point close to the Earth's [[figure of the Earth|center of figure]]
* The Z axis on the line between the North and South Poles, with positive values increasing northward (but does not exactly coincide with the Earth's rotational axis)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weblab.dlr.de/rbrt/pdf/TN_0001.pdf Note on the BIRD ACS Reference Frames] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718231431/http://www.weblab.dlr.de/rbrt/pdf/TN_0001.pdf |date=18 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The X and Y axes in the plane of the Equator
* The X axis passing through extending from 180 degrees longitude at the Equator (negative) to 0 degrees longitude ([[prime meridian#IERS Reference Meridian|prime meridian]]) at the Equator (positive)
* The Y axis passing through extending from 90 degrees west longitude at the Equator (negative) to 90 degrees east longitude at the Equator (positive)

An example is the [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_mark.prl?PidBox=aa3449 NGS data] for a brass disk near Donner Summit, in California. Given the dimensions of the ellipsoid, the conversion from lat/lon/height-above-ellipsoid coordinates to X-Y-Z is straightforward—calculate the X-Y-Z for the given lat-lon on the surface of the ellipsoid and add the X-Y-Z vector that is perpendicular to the ellipsoid there and has length equal to the point's height above the ellipsoid. The reverse conversion is harder: given X-Y-Z we can immediately get longitude, but no closed formula for latitude and height exists. &lt;!--, However, --&gt; See &quot;[[Geodetic system#Geodetic to/from ECEF coordinates|Geodetic system]].&quot; Using Bowring's formula in 1976 ''Survey Review'' the first iteration gives latitude correct within 10{{sup|-11}} degree as long as the point is within 10000 meters above or 5000 meters below the ellipsoid.

=== Local tangent plane ===
[[File:ECEF ENU Longitude Latitude relationships.svg|thumb|Earth centered Earth fixed and East, North, up coordinates.]]
{{Main|Local tangent plane}}
{{Further|Geographic coordinate conversion#From ECEF to ENU}}

A local tangent plane can be defined based on the [[vertical and horizontal]] dimensions. The [[vertical coordinate]] can point either up or down. There are two kinds of conventions for the frames:
* East, North, up (ENU), used in geography
* North, East, down (NED), used specially in aerospace

In many targeting and tracking applications the local ENU Cartesian coordinate system is far more intuitive and practical than ECEF or geodetic coordinates. The local ENU coordinates are formed from a plane tangent to the Earth's surface fixed to a specific location and hence it is sometimes known as a ''local tangent'' or ''local geodetic'' plane. By convention the east axis is labeled &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, the north &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and the up &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;.

In an airplane, most objects of interest are below the aircraft, so it is sensible to define down as a positive number. The NED coordinates allow this as an alternative to the ENU. By convention, the north axis is labeled &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;, the east &lt;math&gt;y'&lt;/math&gt; and the down &lt;math&gt;z'&lt;/math&gt;. To avoid confusion between &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;, etc. in this article we will restrict the local coordinate frame to ENU.

Similar coordinate systems are defined for other celestial bodies such as:

[[Image:ROT13 table with example.svg|right|thumbnail|320px|ROT13 replaces each letter by its partner 13 characters further along the alphabet. For example, &lt;kbd&gt;HELLO&lt;/kbd&gt; becomes &lt;kbd&gt;URYYB&lt;/kbd&gt; (or, conversely, &lt;kbd&gt;URYYB&lt;/kbd&gt; becomes &lt;kbd&gt;HELLO&lt;/kbd&gt; again).]]
'''ROT13''' (&quot;'''rotate by 13 places'''&quot;, sometimes hyphenated '''ROT-13''') is a simple letter [[substitution cipher]] that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet. ROT13 is a special case of the [[Caesar cipher]] which was developed in ancient Rome.

Because there are 26 letters (2×13) in the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet|basic Latin alphabet]], ROT13 is its own [[inverse function|inverse]]; that is, to undo ROT13, the same [[algorithm]] is applied, so the same action can be used for encoding and decoding. The algorithm provides virtually no [[cryptography|cryptographic]] security, and is often cited as a canonical example of weak encryption.&lt;ref name=modern-cryptanalysis&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Cryptanalysis: Techniques for Advanced Code Breaking |author=Christopher Swenson |page=5 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |date=17 March 2008 |isbn=9780470135938 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oLoaWgdmFJ8C&amp;pg=PA5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ROT13 is used in [[online forum]]s as a means of hiding [[spoiler (media)|spoiler]]s, [[punch line|punchlines]], puzzle solutions, and [[profanity|offensive material]]s from the casual glance. ROT13 has inspired a variety of letter and word games online, and is frequently mentioned in [[newsgroup]] conversations.

==Description==
Applying ROT13 to a piece of text merely requires examining its alphabetic characters and replacing each one by the letter 13 places further along in the [[alphabet]], wrapping back to the beginning if necessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;schneier&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schneier |first=Bruce |author-link= Bruce Schneier |title=Applied Cryptography |url=https://archive.org/details/appliedcryptogra00schn_605 |url-access=limited |edition=Second|year=1996|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn= 0-471-11709-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/appliedcryptogra00schn_605/page/n198 11] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;kbd&gt;A&lt;/kbd&gt; becomes &lt;kbd&gt;N&lt;/kbd&gt;, &lt;kbd&gt;B&lt;/kbd&gt; becomes O, and so on up to &lt;kbd&gt;M&lt;/kbd&gt;, which becomes &lt;kbd&gt;Z&lt;/kbd&gt;, then the sequence continues at the beginning of the alphabet: &lt;kbd&gt;N&lt;/kbd&gt; becomes &lt;kbd&gt;A&lt;/kbd&gt;, O becomes &lt;kbd&gt;B&lt;/kbd&gt;, and so on to &lt;kbd&gt;Z&lt;/kbd&gt;, which becomes &lt;kbd&gt;M&lt;/kbd&gt;. Only those letters which occur in the [[English alphabet]] are affected; numbers, symbols, whitespace, and all other characters are left unchanged. Because there are 26 letters in the English alphabet and 26 = 2 &amp;times; 13, the ROT13 function is its own [[inverse function|inverse]]:&lt;ref name=&quot;schneier&quot;/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{ROT}_{13}(\mbox{ROT}_{13}(x))=x&lt;/math&gt; for any basic Latin-alphabet text ''x''.

In other words, two successive applications of ROT13 restore the original text (in [[mathematics]], this is sometimes called an ''[[involution (mathematics)|involution]]''; in cryptography, a ''[[reciprocal cipher]]'').

The transformation can be done using a [[lookup table]], such as the following:
{| style=&quot;margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| Input
| &lt;kbd&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: darkred&quot;&gt;ABCDEFGHIJKLM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: darkblue&quot;&gt;NOPQRSTUVWXYZ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: darkred&quot;&gt;abcdefghijklm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: darkblue&quot;&gt;nopqrstuvwxyz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/kbd&gt;
|-
| Output
| &lt;kbd&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: darkblue&quot;&gt;NOPQRSTUVWXYZ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: darkred&quot;&gt;ABCDEFGHIJKLM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: darkblue&quot;&gt;nopqrstuvwxyz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: darkred&quot;&gt;abcdefghijklm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/kbd&gt;
|}

For example, in the following joke, the punchline has been obscured by ROT13:
: Why did the chicken cross the road?
: Gb trg gb gur bgure fvqr!

Transforming the entire text via ROT13 form, the answer to the joke is revealed:
: Jul qvq gur puvpxra pebff gur ebnq?
: To get to the other side!

A second application of ROT13 would restore the original.

==Usage==

ROT13 is a special case of the [[encryption algorithm]] known as a [[Caesar cipher]], used by [[Julius Caesar]] in the 1st century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kahn |first=David |author-link=David Kahn (writer) |title=The Codebreakers: The Story of Secret Writing |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |isbn=0-684-83130-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johann Ernst Elias Bessler]], a 18th century clockmaker and constructor of [[perpetual motion]] machines, pointed out that ROT13 encodes his surname as ''Orffyre''. He used its [[latinisation of names|latinised]] form, ''Orffyreus'', as his pseudonym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lockhaven.edu/~dsimanek/museum/people/people.htm|title=Perpetual Futility: A short history of the search for perpetual motion|last=Simanek|first=Donald E.|date=2012|website=The Museum of Unworkable Devices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ROT13 was in use in the net.jokes [[newsgroup]] by the early 1980s.{{efn|Early uses of ROT13 found in the Google USENET archive date back to 8 October 1982, posted to the &lt;kbd&gt;net.jokes&lt;/kbd&gt; newsgroup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup |url=http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=bnews.desoto.299 |newsgroup=net.jokes |author=desoto!gog |date=8 October 1982 |title=very mildly obscence joke, shift=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup |url=http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=bnews.utcsrgv.596 |newsgroup=net.jokes |author=utcsrgv!dave |date=8 October 1982 |title=encrypted jokes}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} It is used to hide potentially offensive jokes, or to obscure an answer to a puzzle or other [[spoiler (media)|spoiler]].&lt;ref name=&quot;schneier&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jargon&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|date= 29 December 2003|first=Eric S.

By obscuring an email's content, the screening algorithm is unable to identify the email as, for instance, a security risk, and allows it into the recipient's in-box.

In encrypted, normal, English-language text of any significant size, ROT13 is recognizable from some letter/word patterns. The words &quot;n&quot;, &quot;V&quot; (capitalized only), and &quot;gur&quot; (ROT13 for &quot;a&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, and &quot;the&quot;), and words ending in &quot;yl&quot; (&quot;ly&quot;) are examples.

ROT13 is not intended to be used where [[confidentiality|secrecy]] is of any concern—the use of a constant shift means that the encryption effectively has no [[key (cryptography)|key]], and decryption requires no more knowledge than the fact that ROT13 is in use. Even without this knowledge, the algorithm is easily broken through [[Frequency analysis (cryptanalysis)|frequency analysis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;schneier&quot;/&gt; Because of its utter unsuitability for real secrecy, ROT13 has become a catchphrase to refer to any conspicuously weak [[encryption]] scheme; a critic might claim that &quot;56-bit [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] is little better than ROT13 these days&quot;. Also, in a play on real terms like &quot;double DES&quot;, the terms &quot;double ROT13&quot;, &quot;ROT26&quot;, or &quot;2ROT13&quot; crop up with humorous intent (due to the fact that, since applying ROT13 to an already ROT13-encrypted text restores the original [[plaintext]], ROT26 is equivalent to no encryption at all), including a spoof academic paper entitled &quot;On the 2ROT13 Encryption Algorithm&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=On the 2ROT13 Encryption Algorithm|date=25 September 2004 |url=http://www.pruefziffernberechnung.de/Originaldokumente/2rot13.pdf|publisher=Prüfziffernberechnung in der Praxis|accessdate=20 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; By extension, triple-ROT13 (used in joking analogy with 3DES) is equivalent to regular ROT13.

In December 1999, it was found that [[Netscape Communicator]] used ROT13 as part of an insecure scheme to store email passwords.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|author=Hollebeek, Tim|author2=Viega, John |authorlink2=John Viega |publisher=Reliable Software Technologies|title=Bad Cryptography in the Netscape Browser: A Case Study|citeseerx=10.1.1.15.9271 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Russian programmer [[Dimitry Sklyarov]] demonstrated that an eBook vendor, New Paradigm Research Group (NPRG), used ROT13 to encrypt their documents; it has been speculated that NPRG may have mistaken the ROT13 toy example—provided with the [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] eBook [[software development kit]]—for a serious encryption scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Bruce|last=Perens|author-link=Bruce Perens|url=http://www.zdnet.com/news/dimitry-sklyarov-enemy-or-friend/116424 |title=Dimitry Sklyarov: Enemy or friend?|date=1 September 2001|accessdate=3 February 2011|publisher=[[ZDNet News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows XP uses ROT13 on some of its registry keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=ROT13 is used in Windows|url=https://blog.didierstevens.com/2006/07/24/rot13-is-used-in-windows-you%E2%80%99re-joking/|date=24 July 2006|accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ROT13 is also used in the [[fortune (Unix)|Unix fortune program]] to conceal potentially offensive dicta.

ROT13 provides an opportunity for [[letter games]]. Some words will, when transformed with ROT13, produce another word. Examples of 7-letter pairs in the [[English language]] are ''[[wiktionary:abjurer|abjurer]]'' and ''nowhere'', and ''[[Chechen people|Chechen]]'' and ''[[wiktionary:purpura|purpura]]''. Other examples of words like these are shown in the table.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.furrfu.org/rot13words.html |last=De Mulder|first=Tom|title= ROT13 Words|accessdate=19 September 2007 |work=Furrfu!}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair ''[[gnat]]'' and ''tang'' is an example of words that are both ROT13 reciprocals and [[palindrome|palindromic]].

The 1989 [[International Obfuscated C Code Contest]] (IOCCC) included an entry by Brian Westley. Westley's [[computer program]] can be encoded in ROT13 or reversed and still [[compiler|compiles]] correctly. Its operation, when executed, is either to perform ROT13 encoding on, or to reverse its input.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.ioccc.org/1989/westley.c | title = westley.c | work = [[IOCCC]] | year = 1989 | first = Brian | last = Westley |accessdate=13 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newsgroup alt.folklore.urban coined a word—''furrfu''—that was the ROT13 encoding of the frequently encoded utterance &quot;[[:wikt:sheesh|sheesh]]&quot;. &quot;&lt;kbd&gt;Furrfu&lt;/kbd&gt;&quot; evolved in mid-1992 as a response to postings repeating [[urban myth]]s on alt.folklore.urban, after some posters complained that &quot;Sheesh!&quot; as a response to [[newbie|newcomer]]s was being overused.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://foldoc.org/furrfu |title=Furrfu |publisher=[[Foldoc]] |date=25 October 1995 |accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
ROT5 is a practice similar to ROT13 that applies to numeric digits (0 to 9). ROT13 and ROT5 can be used together in the same message, sometimes called ROT18 (18 = 13 + 5) or ROT13.5.

ROT47 is a derivative of ROT13 which, in addition to scrambling the basic letters, treats numbers and common symbols. Instead of using the sequence &lt;kbd&gt;A–Z&lt;/kbd&gt; as the alphabet, ROT47 uses a larger set of characters from the common [[character encoding]] known as [[ASCII]]. Specifically, the 7-bit printable characters, excluding space, from decimal 33 '&lt;kbd&gt;!&lt;/kbd&gt;' through 126 '&lt;kbd&gt;~&lt;/kbd&gt;', 94 in total, taken in the order of the numerical values of their ASCII codes, are rotated by 47 positions, without special consideration of case. For example, the character &lt;kbd&gt;A&lt;/kbd&gt; is mapped to &lt;kbd&gt;p&lt;/kbd&gt;, while &lt;kbd&gt;a&lt;/kbd&gt; is mapped to &lt;kbd&gt;2&lt;/kbd&gt;. The use of a larger alphabet produces a more thorough obfuscation than that of ROT13; for example, a telephone number such as &lt;kbd&gt;+1-415-839-6885&lt;/kbd&gt; is not obvious at first sight from the scrambled result &lt;kbd&gt;Z`\c`d\gbh\eggd&lt;/kbd&gt;. On the other hand, because ROT47 introduces numbers and symbols into the mix without discrimination, it is more immediately obvious that the text has been enciphered.

Example:
:&lt;kbd&gt;The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog.&lt;/kbd&gt;

The [[GNU C library]], a set of standard routines available for use in [[computer programming]], contains a [[function (programming)|function]]—'''&lt;kbd&gt;mem&lt;abbr title=frobnicate&gt;frob&lt;/abbr&gt;()&lt;/kbd&gt;'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Obfuscating-Data.html|date=3 December 2006|title=5.13 Obfuscating Data|work=The GNU C Library Reference Manual |publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]]|access-date=2 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;—which has a similar purpose to ROT13, although it is intended for use with arbitrary binary data. The function operates by combining each [[byte]] with the [[Binary number|binary]] pattern 00101010 ([[42 (number)|42]]) using the [[exclusive or]] (XOR) operation. This effects a [[simple XOR cipher]]. Like ROT13, XOR (and therefore &lt;kbd&gt;memfrob()&lt;/kbd&gt;) is self-reciprocal, and provides a similar, virtually absent, level of security.

==Implementation==
=== tr ===
The ROT13 and ROT47 are fairly easy to implement using the Unix terminal application &lt;kbd&gt;[[Tr (Unix)|tr]]&lt;/kbd&gt;; to encrypt the string &quot;The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog&quot; in ROT13:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;console&quot;&gt;
$ # Map upper case A-Z to N-ZA-M and lower case a-z to n-za-m
$ tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' &lt;&lt;&lt; &quot;The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog&quot;
Gur Dhvpx Oebja Sbk Whzcf Bire Gur Ynml Qbt
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

and the same string for ROT47:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;console&quot;&gt;
$ echo &quot;The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog&quot; | tr '\!-~' 'P-~\!-O'
%96 &quot;F:4&lt; qC@H? u@I yF&gt;AD ~G6C %96 {2KJ s@8
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Emacs and Vim ===
In [[Emacs]], one can ROT13 the buffer or a selection with the following commands:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Rmail-Rot13.html &quot;Rmail Rot13 – GNU Emacs Manual&quot;]. ''www.gnu.org''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
M-x toggle-rot13-mode
M-x rot13-other-window
M-x rot13-region
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Anime==
The AIBO anime {{Nihongo|'' Piroppo''|ピロッポ}} was based around AIBO ERS-300s, Latte, and Macaron. The anime triggered sounds and actions from viewer's ERS-300s in media-link mode on the proper software.&lt;ref&gt;[[:ja:AIBO]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 23-episode series was broadcast on Fuji TV on Thursdays from 22:54 to 23:00 from October 11, 2001, to March 21, 2002.

==In popular culture==
When AIBO was introduced, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' published a cartoon by [[Jack Ziegler]] showing AIBO &quot;urinating&quot; nuts and bolts on a fire hydrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=retailerId0cfb7871 view productId8543509 |url=https://condenaststore.com/featured/new-yorker-may-31st-1999-jack-ziegler.html |title=Sony-type robot mechanical dog urinates nuts and bolts on fire hydrant. - New Yorker Cartoon Poster Print by Jack Ziegler at the Condé Nast Collection |publisher=Condenaststore.com |date=1999-05-31 |access-date=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AIBO ERS-111 was used in [[Janet Jackson]]'s &quot;[[Doesn't Really Matter]]&quot; music video, and received increased market demand and commercial success after being featured with Jackson in the clip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2001/01/03/business/let-aibo-tell-you-about-brand-image/|title=Let Aibo tell you about brand image - The Japan Times|work=Japan Times|publisher=Gilhooly, Rob|date=2007|access-date=2014-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an episode of ''[[Frasier]]'', Frasier gives his dad an AIBO ERS-210 to keep him company while he is visiting Roz in Wisconsin. There is a scene with Eddie interacting with the AIBO, while Martin Crane complains to Sony about not being able to get it to work.

In the ''[[South Park]]'' episode &quot;[[Red Sleigh Down]]&quot;, Cartman spends nearly the entire episode trying to get on Santa's nice list, so that he can receive a HAIBO robot doll for Christmas, in reference to the robot dog craze of the early 2000s started by AIBO. At the episode's conclusion, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman all receive their own HAIBO dog.
HAIBO is not a parody of AIBO, which is a robot made for adults and wasn't sold in stores.
Instead, this is a parody of the many spin-offs of it, most of which were made for children.

When [[Siri]] on an [[iOS]] device is asked &quot;Do you have a pet?&quot;, one of the responses is &quot;I used to have an AIBO. But it turned on me.&quot;

In the film ''[[CJ7]]'', the robotic toy ''CJ1'', is probably based on the design of AIBO and its toy knock-offs.

In the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode &quot;[[Jurassic Bark]]&quot;, Bender is seen with a robotic dog resembling an AIBO named Robo-Puppy.

A pair of robotic dogs based on AIBO appear in ''[[Tokyo Jungle]]'', a video game published by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]]. The very first AIBO model, ERS-110, is seen in this game, too.

An AIBO ERS-210 can be seen in the title sequence of the 2017 TV adaptation of [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[American Gods]]''.

An AIBO appears in the 38th episode of ''[[Kamen Rider Zero-One]]'', which one is owned by Amatsu Gai. As of 7/19/2020, AIBO has received an update that will allow it to interact with ''[[Kamen Rider Zero-One]]'' toys until 8/2/2020

'''Nice''' ({{IPAc-en|n|iː|s}}, {{respell|NEESS|}}; {{IPA-fr|nis}}; [[Nissard]] {{lang-oc|Niça}}, classical norm, or ''{{lang|oc|Nissa}}'', nonstandard, {{IPA-oc|ˈnisa|pron}}; {{lang-it|Nizza}} {{IPA-it|ˈnittsa|}}; {{lang-el|Νίκαια}}; {{lang-la|Nicaea}}) is the [[Urban area (France)#List of France's aires urbaines (metropolitan areas)|seventh most populous urban area]] in [[France]] and the capital of the [[Alpes-Maritimes]] [[Departments of France|department]]. The metropolitan area of Nice extends beyond the administrative city limits, with a population of nearly 1&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref name=World_Urban_Areas&gt;[http://www.demographia.com/db-worldua.pdf Demographia: World Urban Areas], Demographia.com, April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=comp&gt;[https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/1405599?geo=UU2010-06701 Comparateur de territoire: Unité urbaine de Nice (06701)], [[Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques|INSEE]], retrieved 10 September 2020&lt;/ref&gt; on an area of {{convert|744|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=comp/&gt; Located in the [[French Riviera]], on the south east coast of France on the [[Mediterranean Sea]], at the foot of the [[Alps]], Nice is the second-largest French city on the Mediterranean coast and the second-largest city in the [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]] [[Regions of France|region]] after [[Marseille]]. Nice is approximately {{convert|13|km}} from the [[principality]] of [[Monaco]] and {{convert|30|km}} from the [[France–Italy border|French-Italian border]]. [[Nice Côte d'Azur Airport|Nice's airport]] serves as a gateway to the region.

The city is nicknamed ''Nice la Belle'' (''[[Nissa La Bella]]'' in [[Niçard]]), which means ''Nice the Beautiful'', which is also the title of the unofficial anthem of Nice, written by [[Menica Rondelly]] in 1912. The area of today's Nice contains [[Terra Amata (archaeological site)|Terra Amata]], an archaeological site which displays evidence of a very early use of fire 380,000 years ago. Around 350 BC, Greeks of Marseille founded a permanent settlement and called it Nikaia, after ''[[Nike (mythology)|Nike]]'', the goddess of victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last= Ruggiero |editor-first=Alain |title=Nouvelle histoire de Nice |location=Toulouse |publisher=Privat |year=2006 |isbn=978-2-7089-8335-9 |pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the ages, the town has changed hands many times. Its strategic location and port significantly contributed to its maritime strength. For centuries it was a dominion of [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoy]], and was then part of France between 1792 and 1815, when it was returned to the [[Piedmont-Sardinia|Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]] until its re-annexation by France in 1860.

The natural environment of the Nice area and its mild Mediterranean climate came to the attention of the English upper classes in the second half of the 18th century, when an increasing number of aristocratic families took to spending their winters there. In 1931 following its refurbishment the city's main seaside promenade, the [[Promenade des Anglais]] (&quot;Walkway of the English&quot;) was inaugurated by [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught]], and owes its name to visitors to the resort.&lt;ref&gt;Alain Ruggiero, op. cit., p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; These included [[Queen Victoria]] along with her son [[Edward VII]] who spent winters there, and Nice born [[Henry Cavendish]], who discovered hydrogen.

The clear air and soft light have particularly appealed to notable painters, such as [[Marc Chagall]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] and [[Arman]]. Their work is commemorated in many of the city's museums, including [[Musée Marc Chagall]], [[Musée Matisse (Nice)|Musée Matisse]] and [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nice|Musée des Beaux-Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|date=|title=Nice, France travel. Comprehensive guide to Nice|url=http://www.europe-cities.com/en/573/france/nice/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417013429/http://www.europe-cities.com/en/573/france/nice/|archive-date=17 April 2011|accessdate=3 April 2011|publisher=Europe-cities.com|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; International writers have also been attracted and inspired by the city. [[Frank Harris]] wrote several books including his autobiography ''[[My Life and Loves]]'' in Nice. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] spent six consecutive winters in Nice, and wrote ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra|Thus Spoke Zarathoustra]]'' here. While [[Anton Chekhov|Anton Chekov]] completed writing his play ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'' when he was living in the city.

Nice's appeal extended to the Russian upper classes,  [[Nicholas Alexandrovich, Tsesarevich of Russia|Prince Nicholas Alexandrovich]], heir apparent to [[Imperial Russia]] died in Nice and was a patron of the [[Russian Orthodox Cemetery, Nice]] where [[Catherine Dolgorukov|Princess Catherine Dolgorukova]], [[Morganatic marriage|morganatic]] wife of the [[Tsar]] [[Alexander II of Russia]], is buried. As are [[Dmitry Shcherbachev|General Dmitry Shcherbachev]] and [[Nikolai Yudenich|General Nikolai Yudenich]] leaders of the anti-Communist [[White movement|White Movement]].

Those interred in Nice at the [[Cimetière du Château]], include celebrated jeweler [[Alfred Van Cleef]], [[Emil Jellinek-Mercedes]], founder of the Mercedes car company, film director [[Louis Feuillade]], poet [[Agathe-Sophie Sasserno]], dancer [[Carolina Otero]], ''[[Asterix]]'' comics creator [[René Goscinny]], ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'' author [[Gaston Leroux]], French prime minister [[Léon Gambetta]], and the first president of the [[International Court of Justice]] [[José Gustavo Guerrero]].

Nice has the second largest hotel capacity in the country&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agglo-nice.fr/chiffres-cles-atouts-territoire.htm Un savoir-faire et un équipement complet en matière d'accueil], [[Urban community of Nice Côte d'Azur]] website {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224120503/http://www.agglo-nice.fr/chiffres-cles-atouts-territoire.htm |date=24 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is one of its most visited cities, receiving 4&amp;nbsp;million tourists every year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nice.fr/mairie_nice_19918.html Les chiffres clés du tourisme à Nice], site municipal {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217222657/http://www.nice.fr/mairie_nice_19918.html |date=17 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has the third busiest [[Nice Côte d'Azur Airport|airport]] in France, after the two main Parisian ones.&lt;ref name=&quot;aeroport&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aeroport.fr/fichiers/stats_2007.pdf |title=Union des aéroports français – Résultats d'activité des aéroports français 2007 – Trafic passagers 2007 classement – page 8 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=3 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229142615/http://www.aeroport.fr/fichiers/stats_2007.pdf |archivedate=29 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the historical capital city of the [[County of Nice]] (''Comté de Nice'').&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot; /&gt;

The city soon became one of the busiest trading ports on the Ligurian coast; but it had an important rival in the Roman town of [[Cemenelum]], which continued to exist as a separate city until the time of the [[Lombards|Lombard]] invasions.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The ruins of Cemenelum are in [[Cimiez]], now a district of Nice.

===Early development===

[[File:Nice tour Saint-Francois.jpg|thumb|upright|The Tower of St François]]

In the 7th century, Nice joined the [[Genoa|Genoese]] League formed by the towns of [[Liguria]]. In 729 the city repulsed the [[Saracens]]; but in 859 and again in 880 the Saracens pillaged and burned it, and for most of the 10th century remained masters of the surrounding country.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]], Nice participated in the wars and [[history of Italy]]. As an ally of [[Pisa]] it was the enemy of [[Genoa]], and both the [[King of France]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] endeavoured to subjugate it; but in spite of this it maintained its municipal liberties. During the 13th and 14th centuries the city fell more than once into the hands of the [[Counts of Provence]],&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; but it regained its independence even though related to Genoa.

[[File:Italia 1494-es.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Duchy of Savoy (red) and other independent Italian states in 1494]]

The medieval city walls surrounded the Old Town. The landward side was protected by the River [[Paillon]], which was later covered over and is now the tram route towards the Acropolis.
The east side of the town was protected by fortifications on [[Castle of Nice#Castle Hill|Castle Hill]]. Another river flowed into the port on the east side of Castle Hill. Engravings suggest that the port area was also defended by walls.
Under [[Monoprix]] in Place de Garibaldi are excavated remains of a well-defended city gate on the main road from [[Turin]].{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

===Nice and Savoy===

In 1388, the commune placed itself under the protection of the [[County of Savoy|Counts of Savoy]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Nice participated – directly or indirectly – in the history of [[Savoy]] until 1860. {{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The maritime strength of Nice now rapidly increased until it was able to cope with the [[Barbary pirates]]; the fortifications were largely extended and the roads to the city improved.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; In 1561 [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy]] abolished the use of Latin as an administrative language and established the [[Italian language]] as the official language of government affairs in Nice.

During the struggle between [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] great damage was caused by the passage of the armies invading [[Provence]]; [[infectious disease|pestilence]] and famine raged in the city for several years.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; In 1538, in the nearby town of [[Villeneuve-Loubet]], through the mediation of [[Pope Paul III]], the two monarchs concluded a [[Truce of Nice|ten years' truce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://villeneuveloubethotelreservation.com/articles/the-chateau-of-villeneuve-loubet| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426212438/http://villeneuveloubethotelreservation.com/articles/the-chateau-of-villeneuve-loubet| url-status=dead| archive-date=26 April 2014| title=The Chsteau of Villeneuve-Loubet| publisher=Villeneuve-Loubet Guide and Hotels| accessdate=30 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1543, Nice was attacked by the united [[Franco-Ottoman alliance|Franco-Ottoman forces]] of Francis I and [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha]], in the [[Siege of Nice]]; though the inhabitants repulsed the assault which followed the terrible bombardment, they were ultimately compelled to surrender, and Barbarossa was allowed to pillage the city and to carry off 2,500 captives. Pestilence appeared again in 1550 and 1580.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In 1600, Nice was briefly taken by the [[House of Guise|Duke of Guise]]. By opening the ports of the county to all nations, and proclaiming full freedom of trade (1626), the commerce of the city was given great stimulus, the noble families taking part in its mercantile enterprises.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Captured by [[Nicolas Catinat]] in 1691, Nice was restored to [[Savoy]] in 1696; but [[Siege of Nice (1705)|it was again besieged by the French in 1705]], and in the following year its [[citadel]] and [[Defensive wall|rampart]]s were demolished.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)]] once more gave the city back to the Duke of Savoy, who was on that same occasion recognised as King of Sicily. In the peaceful years which followed, the &quot;new town&quot; was built. From 1744 until the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)]] the French and Spaniards were again in possession. In 1775 the king, who in 1718 had swapped his sovereignty of Sicily for the Kingdom of Sardinia, destroyed all that remained of the ancient liberties of the [[Commune in France|commune]]. Conquered in 1792 by the armies of the [[First French Republic]], the County of Nice continued to be part of France until 1814; but after that date it reverted to the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

[[File:Nice from Baedeker.jpg|thumb|Nice in 1914]]

After the [[Treaty of Turin (1860)|Treaty of Turin]] was signed in 1860 between the [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Sardinian king]] and [[Napoleon III]], the county was again and definitively ceded to France as a territorial reward for French assistance in the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] against [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], which saw [[Lombardy]] united with [[Piedmont-Sardinia]]. The cession was ratified by a regional [[referendum]]: over 25,000 electors out of a total of 30,700 were in favour of the attachment to [[France]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Nice (France)|volume=19|pages=646–647|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savoy was also transferred to the French crown by similar means. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], born in Nice, opposed the cession to France, arguing that the ballot was rigged by the French. 
Many Italians from Nizza then moved to the Ligurian towns of [[Ventimiglia]], [[Bordighera]] and [[Ospedaletti]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.liberanissa.eu/archives/nizza_e_il_suo_futuro/index.html|title=Nizza e il suo futuro|publisher=Liberà Nissa|language=Italian|access-date=26 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving rise to a local branch of the movement of the [[Italia irredenta|Italian irredentists]] which considered the re-acquisition of Nice to be one of their nationalist goals.

In 1900, the [[Trams in Nice|Tramway de Nice]] electrified its horse-drawn streetcars and spread its network to the entire ''département'' from [[Menton]] to [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]]. By the 1930s more bus connections were added in the area.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} In the 1930s, Nice hosted international car racing in the [[Formula Libre]] (predecessor to [[Formula One]]) on the so-called Circuit Nice. The circuit started along the waterfront just south of the Jardin Albert I, then headed westward along the [[Promenade des Anglais]] followed by a hairpin turn at the [[Hotel Negresco]] to come back eastward and around the Jardin Albert I before heading again east along the beach on the Quai des Etats-Unis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bestofniceblog.com/history-nice-france/nice-grand-prix/|title=Nice Grand Prix|access-date=25 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As war broke out in September 1939, Nice became a city of refuge for many displaced foreigners, notably Jews fleeing the Nazi progression into Eastern Europe. From Nice many sought further shelter in the [[French colonial empire|French colonies]], Morocco and North and South America. After July 1940 and the establishment of the [[Vichy France|Vichy Regime]], [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] aggressions accelerated the exodus, starting in July 1941 and continuing through 1942. On 26 August 1942, 655 Jews of foreign origin were rounded up by the Laval government and interned in the Auvare barracks. Of these, 560 were deported to [[Drancy internment camp]] on 31 August 1942. Due to the activity of the Jewish banker [[Angelo Donati]] and of the Capuchin friar [[Père Marie-Benoît]] the local authorities hindered the application of anti-Jewish Vichy laws.&lt;ref&gt;Léon Poliakov, ''La conditions des Juifs sous l'occupation italienne'', Paris, CDJC, 1946 and bibliographies of [[Angelo Donati]] and [[Père Marie-Benoît]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[French Resistance|''résistants'']] to the new regime were a group of High School seniors of the Lycée de Nice, now {{ill|Lycée Masséna|fr}}, in September 1940, later arrested and executed in 1944 near [[Verdon Gorge|Castellane]]. The first public demonstrations occurred on 14 July 1942 when several hundred protesters took to the streets along the Avenue de la Victoire and in the Place Masséna. In November 1942 German troops moved into most of unoccupied France, but Italian troops moved into a smaller zone including Nice. A certain ambivalence remained among the population, many of whom were recent immigrants of Italian ancestry. However, the resistance gained momentum after the Italian surrender in 1943 when the German army occupied the former Italian zone. Reprisals intensified between December 1943 and July 1944, when many partisans were tortured and executed by the local [[Gestapo]] and the [[Milice|French Milice]]. Nice was also heavily bombarded by American aircraft in preparation for the Allied [[Operation Dragoon|landing in Provence]] (1000 dead or wounded and more than 5600 people homeless) and famine ensued during summer 1944.
American paratroopers entered the city on 30 August 1944 and Nice was finally liberated.
The consequences of the war were heavy: the population decreased by 15% {{citation needed|date=November 2017}} and economic life was totally disrupted.

In the second half of the 20th century, Nice enjoyed an economic boom primarily driven by tourism and construction. Two men dominated this period: [[Jean Médecin]], [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] for 33 years from 1928 to 1943 and from 1947 to 1965, and his son [[Jacques Médecin|Jacques]], mayor for 24 years from 1966 to 1990. Under their leadership, there was extensive urban renewal, including many new constructions. These included the convention centre, theatres, new thoroughfares and expressways. The arrival of the [[Pied-Noir|Pieds-Noirs]], refugees from Algeria after 1962 independence, also gave the city a boost and somewhat changed the make-up of its population and traditional views. {{citation needed|date=November 2017}} By the late 1980s, rumors of political corruption in the city government surfaced; and eventually formal accusations against Jacques Médecin forced him to flee France in 1990. Later arrested in [[Uruguay]] in 1993, he was extradited back to France in 1994, convicted of several counts of corruption and associated crimes and sentenced to imprisonment.

On 16 October 1979, a [[landslide]] and an undersea slide caused two [[tsunami]]s that hit the western coast of Nice; these [[1979 Nice events|events]] killed between 8 and 23 people.

In February 2001, European leaders met in Nice to negotiate and sign what is now the [[Treaty of Nice]], amending the institutions of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/irish-referendum-on-nice-treaty-doomed-to-fail-again-189539.html|title=Irish referendum on Nice Treaty 'doomed to fail again'|work=[[The Independent]]|date=23 May 2002|first=Shawn|last=Pogatchnik|accessdate=17 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, local Chief [[Prosecutor]] [[Éric de Montgolfier]] alleged that some judicial cases involving local personalities had been suspiciously derailed by the local judiciary, which he suspected of having unhealthy contacts through [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] lodges with the defendants. A controversial official report stated later that Montgolfier had made unwarranted accusations. {{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Impact of modern development==
Ralph Müller (1940) stated, &quot;That the history of physical science is largely the history of instruments and their intelligent use is well known. The broad generalizations and theories which have arisen from time to time have stood or fallen on the basis of accurate measurement, and in several instances new instruments have had to be devised for the purpose. There is little evidence to show that the mind of modern man is superior to that of the ancients. His tools are incomparably better.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Katz&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Katz|first1=Eric|last2=Light|first2=Andrew|last3=Thompson|first3=William|title=Controlling technology : contemporary issues|date=2002|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, NY|isbn=978-1573929837|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nny8OoQCZCoC&amp;pg=PA88|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baird&quot;/&gt;{{rp|290}}

Davis Baird has argued that the major change associated with [[Floris Cohen]]{{'}}s identification of a &quot;fourth big scientific revolution&quot; after [[World War II]] is the development of scientific instrumentation, not only in [[chemistry]] but across the sciences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baird&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

As early as 1954, W. A. Wildhack discussed both the productive and destructive potential inherent in process control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wildhack&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wildhack|first1=W.

'''Anne of Cleves''' ({{lang-de|Anna von Kleve}}; 1515 – 16 July 1557){{sfn|Weir|2009|p=155}} was [[List of English consorts|queen consort of England]] from 6 January to 9 July 1540 as the [[Wives of Henry VIII|fourth wife]] of [[King Henry VIII]].{{sfn|Weir|2009|p=155}} Not much is known about Anne before 1527, when she became betrothed to [[Francis I, Duke of Lorraine|Francis, Duke of Bar]], son and heir of [[Antoine, Duke of Lorraine]], although their marriage did not proceed. In March 1539, negotiations for Anne's marriage to Henry began, as Henry believed that he needed to form a political alliance with her brother, [[Wilhelm, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg|William]], who was a leader of the Protestants of western Germany, to strengthen his position against potential attacks from Catholic France and the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.english-heritage.org.uk/henry-viii-and-anne-of-cleves/&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne arrived in England on 27 December 1539 and married Henry on 6 January 1540, but after six months, the marriage was declared [[unconsummated]] and, as a result, she was not crowned [[queen consort]]. Following the [[annulment]], Henry gave her a generous settlement, and she was thereafter known as ''the King's Beloved Sister''.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=108}}{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&amp;pg=PA252#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 252]}} She lived to see the coronation of [[Queen Mary I]], outliving the rest of Henry's wives.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=165}}

==Early life==
Anne was born in 1515, on either 22 September,{{sfn|Weir|2009|p=155}}{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=7}} or more probably 28 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Darsie |first1=Heather |title=Anna, Duchess of Cleves: The King's Beloved Sister |date=15 April 2019 |publisher=Amberley Publishing |isbn=9781445677101 |pages=17–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was born in [[Düsseldorf]],&lt;ref&gt;At the time, the area was in the Duchy of Berg.&lt;/ref&gt; the second daughter of [[John III, Duke of Cleves|John III]] of the [[House of La Marck]], Duke of [[Duchy of Jülich|Jülich]] ''[[jure uxoris]]'', [[Duchy of Cleves|Cleves]], [[Berg (state)|Berg]] ''jure uxoris'', Count of [[County of Mark|Mark]], also known as [[de la Marck]] and [[County of Ravensberg|Ravensberg]] ''jure uxoris'' (often referred to as Duke of Cleves) who died in 1538, and his wife [[Maria of Jülich-Berg|Maria, Duchess of Jülich-Berg]] (1491–1543). She grew up in [[Schloss Burg (Solingen)|Schloss Burg]] on the edge of [[Solingen]].

Anne's father was influenced by [[Erasmus]] and followed a moderate path within the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. He sided with the [[Schmalkaldic League]] and opposed [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]].  
After John's death, Anne's brother [[Wilhelm, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg|William]] became [[United Duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg|Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg]], bearing the promising epithet &quot;The Rich&quot;. In 1526, her elder sister [[Sibylle of Cleves|Sibylle]] was married to [[John Frederick, Elector of Saxony]], head of the [[Schmalkaldic League|Protestant Confederation of Germany]] and considered the &quot;Champion of the Reformation.&quot;

In 1527, at the age of 11, Anne was betrothed to [[Francis I, Duke of Lorraine|Francis]], the 9-year-old son and heir of [[Antoine, Duke of Lorraine]].{{sfn|Norton|2010|pp=12–13}} Thus the betrothal was considered unofficial and was cancelled in 1535. Her brother William was a [[Lutheran]] but the family was unaligned religiously, with her mother, the Duchess Maria, described as a &quot;strict Catholic&quot;.{{sfn|Fraser|1992|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=HKynDn8DnhEC&amp;pg=PT369&amp;lpg=PT369#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 364]}} Her father's ongoing dispute over [[Guelders|Gelderland]] with Charles V made the family suitable allies for England's King Henry VIII in the wake of the [[Truce of Nice]]. The match with Anne was urged on the king by his chief minister, [[Thomas Cromwell]].

===Wedding preparations===
The artist [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] was dispatched to [[Düren]] to paint portraits of Anne and her younger sister, [[Amalia of Cleves|Amalia]], each of whom Henry was considering as his fourth wife. Henry required the artist to be as accurate as possible, not to flatter the sisters. The portraits are now located in the [[Musée du Louvre]] in Paris and the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London. Another 1539 portrait, by the school of [[Barthel Bruyn the Elder]], is in the collection of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trinity College, University of Cambridge|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/search/located_at/trinity-college-cambridge-5846_locations|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141119024341/http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/search/located_at/trinity-college-cambridge-5846_locations|url-status=dead|archive-date=2014-11-19|publisher=BBC Your Paintings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negotiations to arrange the marriage were in full swing by March 1539. Cromwell oversaw the talks and a marriage treaty was signed on 4 October of that year.

Henry valued education and cultural sophistication in women, but Anne lacked these traits.  She had received no formal education but was skilled in needlework and liked playing card games. She could read and write, but only in German.{{sfn|Norton|2010|pp=10–11}} Nevertheless, Anne was considered gentle, virtuous and docile, which is why she was recommended as a suitable candidate for Henry.

Anne was described by French ambassador [[Charles de Marillac]] as tall and slim, &quot;of middling beauty and of very assured and resolute countenance.&quot;{{sfn|Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII 15: 1540 no. 22}} She was fair-haired and was said to have had a lovely face. In the words of the chronicler [[Edward Hall]], &quot;Her hair hanging down, which was fair, yellow and long&amp;nbsp;... she was apparelled after the English fashion, with a French hood, which so set forth her beauty and good visage, that every creature rejoiced to behold her.&quot;{{sfn|Hall|1809|pp=836–837}} She appeared rather solemn by English standards, and looked old for her age. Holbein painted her with a high forehead, heavy-lidded eyes and a pointed chin.

Henry met her privately on New Year's Day 1540 at Rochester Abbey in [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] on her journey from [[Dover]].{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&amp;pg=PA138#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 138]}} Henry and some of his courtiers, following a [[Courtly love|courtly-love]] tradition, went disguised into the room where Anne was staying.{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&amp;pg=PA138#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 138]}} [[Eustace Chapuys]] reported:
{{Wives of Henry VIII}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The King] so went up into the chamber where the said Lady Anne was looking out of a window to see the bull-baiting which was going on in the courtyard, and suddenly he embraced and kissed her, and showed her a token which the king had sent her for New Year’s gift, and she being abashed and not knowing who it was thanked him, and so he spoke with her. But she regarded him little, but always looked out the window&amp;nbsp;.... and when the king saw that she took so little notice of his coming he went into another chamber and took off his cloak and came in again in a coat of purple velvet. And when the lords and knights saw his grace they did him reverence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thehistoryjar.com/2017/01/06/anne-of-cleves-not-love-at-first-sight/ &quot;Anne of Cleves – Not Love at First Sight&quot; ''The History Jar''] retrieved February 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the testimony of Henry's companions, he was disappointed with Anne, feeling that she was not as described. According to the chronicler [[Charles Wriothesley]], Anne &quot;regarded him little&quot;,{{sfn|Wriothesley|1875|pp=109–110}} though it is unknown whether she knew this was the king.{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&amp;pg=PA132#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 132]}} Henry then revealed his true identity to Anne, although he is said to have been put off the marriage from then on. Henry and Anne then met officially on 3 January on Blackheath outside the gates of Greenwich Park, where a grand reception was laid out.{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&amp;pg=PA146#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 146]}}

Most historians believe that Henry's misgivings about the marriage were blamed on Anne's alleged unsatisfactory appearance and her failure to inspire him to consummate the marriage. He felt that he had been misled after his advisors had praised Anne's beauty: &quot;She is nothing so fair as she hath been reported&quot;, he complained.{{sfn|Schofield|2011|p=361}} Cromwell received some blame for the Holbein portrait, which Henry believed had not been an accurate representation of Anne, and for some of the exaggerated reports of her beauty. When the king finally met Anne, he was reportedly shocked by her plain appearance, and the marriage was never consummated.{{sfn|Elton|1991|p=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=Z15sBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=cromwell+anne+of+cleves+downfall&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIktfDyZ3VAhXG7IMKHb-cCXM4ChDoAQgtMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=cromwell%20anne%20of%20cleves%20downfall&amp;f=false 157]}}{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=cromwell+anne+of+cleves+Duchess+of+Milan+%22as+the+golden+sun+did+the+silver&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjz1ZC0z53VAhUN0IMKHWSfAnkQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=cromwell%20anne%20of%20cleves%20Duchess%20of%20Milan%20%22as%20the%20golden%20sun%20did%20the%20silver&amp;f=false 77]}}

Henry urged Cromwell to find a legal way to avoid the marriage but, by this point, doing so was impossible without endangering the vital alliance with the Germans. In his anger and frustration, the King turned on Cromwell, to his subsequent regret.{{sfn|Lehmberg|1977|p=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=MhY9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=Henry+VIII+execution+of+cromwell+later+regretted&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiH8P_L0Z3VAhVJ44MKHdxECwQQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Henry%20VIII%20execution%20of%20cromwell%20later%20regretted&amp;f=false 127]}}

=== Marriage ===
[[File:Bruyn Anne of Cleves.jpg|right|thumb|A portrait of Anne in the 1540s by [[Barthel Bruyn the Elder|Bartholomäus Bruyn the elder]].]]

Despite Henry's very vocal misgivings, the two were married on 6 January 1540 at the royal [[Palace of Placentia]] in [[Greenwich]], London, by [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Archbishop]] [[Thomas Cranmer]]. The phrase &quot;God send me well to keep&quot; was engraved around Anne's wedding ring. Immediately after arriving in England, Anne conformed to the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] form of worship, which Henry expected.{{sfn|Weir|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=M1yHXitDdyQC&amp;pg=PA412&amp;lpg=PA412 412]}} The couple's first night as husband and wife was not a successful one. Henry confided to Cromwell that he had not consummated the marriage, saying, &quot;I liked her before not well, but now I like her much worse.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I8M0AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA391 |title=Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, of the Reign of Henry VIII: Jan.-Aug. 1540 |publisher=H.M. Stationery Office |year=1896 |page=391 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1540, speaking to the [[Eleanor Manners, Countess of Rutland|Countess of Rutland]], Anne praised the King as a kind husband, saying: &quot;When he comes to bed he kisseth me, and he taketh me by the hand, and biddeth me 'Good night, sweetheart'; and in the morning kisseth me and biddeth 'Farewell, darling.{{'&quot;}} Lady Rutland responded: &quot;Madam, there must be more than this, or it will be long ere we have a duke of York, which all this realm most desireth.&quot;{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=7}} 

Anne was commanded to leave the Court on 24 June, and on 6 July she was informed of her husband's decision to reconsider the marriage. Witness statements were taken from a number of courtiers and two physicians which register the king's disappointment at her appearance. Henry had also commented to [[Groom of the Stool#Grooms of the Stool under Henry VIII|Thomas Heneage and Anthony Denny]] that he could not believe she was a virgin.{{sfn|Strype I(II)|1822|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/ecclesiasticalme0102stry#page/450/mode/2up 450–463]}}

Shortly afterwards, Anne was asked for her consent to an annulment, to which she agreed.  Cromwell, the moving force behind the marriage, was [[attainder|attainted]] for [[treason]]. The marriage was annulled on 9 July 1540, on the grounds of non-consummation and her pre-contract to Francis of Lorraine. Henry VIII's physician stated that after the wedding night, Henry said he was not impotent because he experienced &quot;''{{lang|la|duas pollutiones nocturnas in somno}}''&quot; (two [[nocturnal emission|nocturnal pollutions]] while in sleep; i.e., two [[wet dream]]s).{{sfn|Strype I(II)|1822|p=[https://archive.org/stream/ecclesiasticalme0102stry#page/460/mode/2up 461]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Holbein en Angleterre |work=Amateur d'Art, par Lunettes Rouge |date=29 November 2006 |publisher=[[Le Monde|La Vie–Le Monde Group]] |url=http://lunettesrouges.blog.lemonde.fr/2006/11/29/holbein-en-angleterre/ |accessdate=4 January 2014 |language=fr }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the annulment==
[[File:Coat of Arms of Anne of Cleves.svg|thumb|250px|Anne of Cleves' arms as queen consort.{{sfn|Boutell|1863|p=243}}]]

The former queen received a generous [[legal settlement|settlement]], including [[Richmond Palace]], and [[Hever Castle]], home of Henry's former in-laws, the Boleyns. [[Anne of Cleves House]], in [[Lewes]], [[East Sussex]], is just one of many properties she owned; she never lived there. Henry and Anne became good friends—she was an honorary member of the King's family and was referred to as &quot;the King's Beloved Sister&quot;. She was invited to court often and, out of gratitude for her not contesting the annulment, Henry decreed that she would be given precedence over all women in England save his own wife and daughters.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=108}}

After [[Catherine Howard]] was beheaded, Anne and her brother, [[William, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg]], pressed the king to remarry Anne.  Henry quickly refused to do so.{{sfn|Farquhar|2001|p=77}} She seems to have disliked [[Catherine Parr]], and reportedly reacted to the news of Henry's sixth marriage with the remark &quot;Madam Parr is taking a great burden on herself.&quot;{{sfn|Weir|2007|p=498}}

In March 1547, [[Edward VI]]'s [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] asked her to move out of [[Bletchingley]] Palace, her usual residence, to [[Penshurst Place]] to make way for [[Thomas Cawarden]], [[Master of Revels]]. They pointed out that Penshurst was nearer to Hever and the move had been Henry VIII's will.{{sfn|Acts of the Privy Council 2|pp=[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/source.aspx?pubid=1177&amp;sp=3&amp;pg=82 82–83], [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/source.aspx?pubid=1177&amp;sp=3&amp;pg=471 471–472]}}{{sfn|Ellis|1817|pp=131–132}}

On 4 August 1553, Anne wrote to [[Mary I]] to congratulate her on her marriage to [[Philip II of Spain|Philip of Spain]].{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=153}} On 28 September 1553, when Mary left [[St James's Palace]] for [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall]], she was accompanied by her sister [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] and Anne of Cleves.{{sfn|Whitelock|2010|p=192}} Anne also took part in Mary I's coronation procession,{{sfn|Norton|2010|pp=144–145}}{{sfn|Porter|2007|pp=256, 260–261}} and may have been present at her coronation at [[Westminster Abbey]].{{sfn|Porter|2007|p=260 According to [[Antoine, 1st comte de Noailles|Antoine de Noailles]], Elizabeth and Anne followed Mary into the Abbey}} These were her last public appearances. As the new queen was a strict Catholic, Anne yet again changed religion, now becoming a Roman Catholic.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=146}}{{sfn|Weir|2007|p=388}}

After a brief return to prominence, she lost royal favour in 1554, following [[Wyatt's rebellion]]. According to [[Simon Renard]], the imperial ambassador, Anne's close association with Elizabeth had convinced the Queen that &quot;the Lady [Anne] of Cleves was of the plot and intrigued with the Duke of Cleves to obtain help for Elizabeth: matters in which the king of France was the prime mover&quot;.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=151}} There is no evidence that Anne was invited back to court after 1554.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=154}} She was compelled to live a quiet and obscure life on her estates.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=154}} After her arrival as the King's bride, Anne never left England. Despite occasional feelings of homesickness, Anne was generally content in England and was described by [[Raphael Holinshed|Holinshed]] as &quot;a ladie of right commendable regards, courteous, gentle, a good housekeeper and verie bountifull to her servants.&quot;{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=165}}

==Death==
When Anne's health began to fail, Mary allowed her to live at [[Chelsea Manor|Chelsea Old Manor]], where Henry's last wife, [[Catherine Parr]], had lived after her remarriage.{{sfn|Fraser|1992|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=HKynDn8DnhEC&amp;pg=PT507#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 504]}} Here, in the middle of July 1557, Anne dictated her last will. In it, she mentions her brother, sister, and sister-in-law, as well as the future Queen Elizabeth, the Duchess of Suffolk, and the Countess of Arundel.{{sfn|Norton|2010|pp=158–161}} She left some money to her servants and asked Mary and Elizabeth to employ them in their households.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=161}} She was remembered by everyone who served her as a particularly generous and easy-going mistress.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=165}}

Anne died at Chelsea Old Manor on 16 July 1557, eight weeks before her forty-second birthday. The most likely cause of her death was [[cancer]].{{sfn|Fraser|1992|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=HKynDn8DnhEC&amp;pg=PT507#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 504]}} She was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], on 3&amp;nbsp;August,{{sfn|Machyn|1968|pp=145–146}} in what has been described as a &quot;somewhat hard to find tomb&quot; on the opposite side of [[Edward the Confessor]]'s shrine and slightly above eye level for a person of average height.

Anne's [[epitaph]] in Westminster Abbey, which is in English, reads simply:&lt;ref&gt;Google Images&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;center&gt;ANNE OF CLEVES&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;QUEEN OF ENGLAND&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;BORN 1515 * DIED 1557&lt;/center&gt;

She also has the distinction of being the last of Henry VIII's wives to die,{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=165}} as she outlived Henry's last wife, [[Catherine Parr]], by nine years. She was not the longest-lived, however, since [[Catherine of Aragon]] was 50 at the time of her death.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=161}}

==Literature==
Anne is the subject of several biographies: Julia Hamilton's ''Anne of Cleves'' (1972), and Mary Saaler's ''Anne of Cleves: Fourth Wife of Henry VIII'' (1995), [[Elizabeth Norton]]'s ''Anne of Cleves: Henry VIII's Discarded Bride'' (2009), and Heather Darsie's ''Anna, Duchess of Cleves: The King's Beloved Sister'' (2019). Retha Warnicke has written an academic study on Anne's marriage called ''The Marrying of Anne of Cleves. Royal Protocol in Early Modern England'' (2000).

Anne of Cleves appears as a character in many historical novels about Henry's reign. In ''[[The Fifth Queen]]'' (1906) by [[Ford Madox Ford]], she is portrayed as a sensible, practical woman who happily settles for an annulment in return for the material benefits it brings. Anne of Cleves is the main character of ''My Lady of Cleves'' (1946) by [[Margaret Campbell Barnes]]. About a third of ''[[The Boleyn Inheritance]]'' (2006) by [[Philippa Gregory]] is recounted from Anne's point of view, covering the period of Henry VIII's marriages to her and to her successor Catherine Howard. The book concludes with Anne living away from court, and avoiding the execution ceremonies of Howard and of [[Jane Boleyn]], sister-in-law to one of Henry's queens and lady-in-waiting to five of the others, including Anne. Gregory includes Anne in a non-fictional review of the period at the end of the book.

Anne and her Holbein portrait in the Louvre are the focus of the novel ''Amenable Women'' (2009) by [[Mavis Cheek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Annis |title=Amenable Women by Mavis Cheek |work=HistoricalNovels.info |url=http://www.historicalnovels.info/Amenable-Women.html |accessdate=2 April 2012 }}; {{cite web|title=Amenable Women, Mavis Cheek |work=Faber &amp; Faber |url=http://www.faber.co.uk/work/amenable-women/9780571238965/ |accessdate=2 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515022239/http://www.faber.co.uk/work/amenable-women/9780571238965/ |archivedate=15 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anne and Catherine Howard are the subjects of ''The Queen's Mistake'' by Diane Haeger (2009), while Anne and Jane Seymour are covered in Volume 3 of Dixie Atkins's tetralogy ''A Golden Sorrow'' (2010). D. Lawrence-Young authored a [[biographical novel]] &quot;Anne of Cleves – Henry's Luckiest Wife&quot; published by GMTA/Celestial Press. N.C. USA, 2013.

In May 2019 [[Alison Weir]] released her fourth Six Tudor Queens Novel, ''Anna of Kleve: Queen of Secrets.'' The novel follows her throughout her life, first in Germany then Tudor England.

==In film, television, and theatre==

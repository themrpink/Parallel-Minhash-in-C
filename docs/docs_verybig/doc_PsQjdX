In 1615, the colony was passed to a new company, the [[Somers Isles Company]], named after the admiral who saved his passengers from the ''Sea Venture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bearboat.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/tvlbt-bda-bd-11feb09_sailingtravel1.pdf|title=Bermuda's 400th Birthday|publisher=Bearboa.files.wordpress.com|date=11 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bermuda-attractions.com/bermuda_0002ae.htm|title=Somers Garden|publisher=Bermuda, Bermuda-attractions.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Virginian place names refer to the archipelago, such as Bermuda City, and [[Bermuda Hundred, Virginia|Bermuda Hundred]]. The first British colonial currency was struck in Bermuda.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt;{{rp|79}}&lt;ref name=Jarvis&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jarvis|first1=Michael|title=In the Eye of All Trade|date=2010|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=9780807872840|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bermuda was divided by [[Richard Norwood]] into eight equally sized administrative areas west of St. George's called &quot;tribes&quot; (today known as &quot;parishes&quot;). These &quot;tribes&quot; were areas of land partitioned off to the principal &quot;Adventurers&quot; (investors) of the company, from east to west – Bedford, Smiths, Cavendish, Paget, Mansell, Warwick, and Sandys.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt;{{rp|69}}

The company sent 600 settlers in nine ships between 1612 and 1615. Governor Moore dug a well in St. George, then built fortifications including Paget and Smith's batteries at the entrance of the harbour, King's and Charles' at the entrance to Castle Harbour, Pembroke Fort on Cooper's Island, and Gates' Fort, St. Katherine's Fort and Warwick Castle to defend St. George. In 1614, the first English-grown tobacco was exported, the same tobacco variety John Rolfe started to grow in Virginia. The exporting of [[ambergris]] was especially lucrative. In August 1616, plantain, sugarcane, fig, and pineapple plants were imported along with the first Indian and Negro, the first English colony to use enslaved Africans. By 1619, Bermuda had between fifty and a hundred black enslaved persons. Though Bermuda exported more tobacco than Virginia until 1625, Bermuda diversified its agriculture to include corn, potatoes, fruit trees, poultry and livestock. This was especially true when prices collapsed in 1630, and tobacco took its toll on soil fertility, though the company continued to use tobacco as a medium of exchange and resist a diversified economy. Tobacco exports peaked in 1684, the last year of company control.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt;{{rp|60–61}}&lt;ref name=Jarvis/&gt;{{rp|17–18,26–29,38–39,84}}

English immigration essentially ceased by the 1620s when all available land was occupied. Because of its limited land area, Bermuda relied on emigration, especially to the developing English colonies in the Bahamas, the Carolinas, New York and the Caribbean. Between 1620 and 1640, 1200 emigrated, while the population reached 4000 in 1648. Between 1679 and 1690, 2000 emigrated, while the population reached 6248 in 1691.&lt;ref name=Jarvis/&gt;{{rp|29,45–47,86,101,324,372}}

The archipelago's limited land area and resources led to the creation of what may be the earliest conservation laws of the [[New World]]. In 1616 and 1620, acts were passed banning the hunting of certain birds and young tortoises.&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, Martin. &quot;Developing a Small Island GIS: the Bermuda Experience&quot;.

=== English Civil War in the Bermuda ===
In 1649, the [[English Civil War]] was in its seventh year and King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] was beheaded in Whitehall, London. In Bermuda, related tensions resulted in civil war on the island; it was ended by militias. The majority of colonists developed a strong sense of devotion to the Crown. Dissenters, such as [[Puritan]]s and [[Independent (religion)|Independents]], were pushed to settle [[the Bahamas]] under [[William Sayle]].&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Keith: [http://www.bermuda-online.org/history.htm &quot;About Bermuda Online&quot;], ''The Royal Gazette'' Ltd. Retrieved 22 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Edward Sackville, 4th Earl of Dorset|Earl of Dorset]], a royalist, was replaced by the [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]], a Puritan, as governor of the Somers Island Company. Sayle and most of the emigrants were allowed to return to Bermuda in 1656.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt;{{rp|251–252,270–272,279–280,398}}

Bermuda and Virginia, as well as Antigua and Barbados were, however, the subjects of the September 1650 Prohibitory Act of the [[Rump Parliament]], and the Atlantic fleet was instructed to bring these opposing colonies into obedience. At the same time, [[John Danvers]], governor of the Somers Island Company, and the other adventurers were forced to take the oath of allegiance to the Commonwealth. Then in the 1651 [[Navigation Acts|Navigation Act]], trade was restricted to English ships.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt;{{rp|283–285}}

An Act prohibiting Trade with Barbados, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego, specified that:
&lt;blockquote href=&quot;Charles I of England&quot;&gt;''due punishment [be] inflicted upon the said Delinquents, do Declare all and every the said persons in Barbada's, Antego, Bermuda's and Virginia, that have contrived, abetted, aided or assisted those horrid Rebellions, or have since willingly joyned with them, to be notorious Robbers and Traitors, and such as by the Law of Nations are not to be permitted any maner of Commerce or Traffique with any people whatsoever; and do forbid to all maner of persons, Foreiners, and others, all maner of Commerce, Traffique and Correspondency whatsoever, to be used or held with the said Rebels in the Barbada's, Bermuda's, Virginia and Antego, or either of them.''
All Ships that Trade with the Rebels may be surprised. Goods and tackle of such ships not to be embezeled, till judgement in the Admiralty.; Two or three of the Officers of every ship to be examined upon oath.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1658, the Company appointed Sayle Governor of Bermuda, and the islanders took the oath of allegiance to the [[Lord Protector]].&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt;{{rp|295–296}}

===Indentured servitude and slavery in 17th century Bermuda===
Among the emigrants after Norwood finished is survey, were [[Bridewell]], [[Newgate Prison|Newgate]] and [[gaol]] transportees, [[indentured servitude in the Americas|indentured servants]], and &quot;maids for wives'. Yet most were emigrant families bound for four to five years as [[tenant farmer]]s, paying half the tobacco they grew as rent to their landlord. This tenantry, indentured servitude of five years in return for passage, and family labor, reduced the need for slaves in growing tobacco and provisions. Thus, though Bermuda was a slave society, slavery was not essential to the agriculture economy, and Bermuda did not actively import slaves, instead relying on those black and Indian adults captured by privateers, then sold as slaves in Bermuda. Black indentures were for 99 years or life. The few Scot exiles received after the Civil War were indentured for seven years, while the few Irish exiles from that same period caused the slave trouble of 1664, and were hence forbidden entry onwards. The indentured system importance ceased by 1668. This non-dependence on slavery changed however, when the island moved to a maritime economy in the 1690s, and incorporated slave sailors, carpenters, [[cooper (profession)|coopers]], blacksmiths, masons, and [[shipwright]]s. Hiring out of these skilled slaves became commonplace for their owners, with slaves retaining only a third of the wages they earned. By 1710, slaves were doing most of the vital work and constituted 3,517 of the total population of 8,366 in 1721.&lt;ref name=Jarvis/&gt;{{rp|23,31,101,105–109}}&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt;{{rp|96–97,357–358}}

Slaves could be obtained by sale or purchase, auction debt, legal seizure or by gift. The price of a slave depended on demand. Throughout the 17th century Black children sold for £8, women from £10 to £20, and able bodied Black and Indian men for around £26.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brooke|first=W. Michael, editor|title=Blacks in Bermuda: A Historical Perspective|publisher=Bermuda College|year=1980|location=Bermuda|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slave revolts were a threat since 1623, while a revolt in 1656 resulted in executions and banishments. A 1664 revolt was stopped early, as was one in 1673, and again in 1681, which resulted in five executions. These revolts resulted in the orders of 1674 mandating that slaves straying from their premises, wandering at night without permission, or the gathering of two or three slaves from different tribes, be whipped. Any blacks deemed free were required to become slaves again or leave the island. The importation of additional slaves was also banned. A Jamaican slave named Tom was deported in 1682, when his rebellious plot was divulged by two Bermudian slaves.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt;{{rp|355–356}}&lt;ref name=Jarvis/&gt;{{rp|57,67}}

== The 18th century ==
===The salt trade and the Turks Islands===

[[File:Turks_and_Caicos_Islands_raking_salt_stamp_1938.jpg|thumb|Raking salt on the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] on a 1938 postage stamp.]]
{{main article|History of the Turks and Caicos Islands}}
Bermudians were raking salt in the Caribbean since the 1630s, an essential ingredient for making cheese, butter, and preserving meat and fish. Rakers would channel sea water in [[salt evaporation pond|salt pans]] for evaporation. [[Salt Cay, Turks Islands|Salt Cay]] and [[Grand Turk Island]] became salt colonies in the 1680s. According to Jarvis, &quot;these small, hot, dry, and barren islands&quot; were perfect for salt production since the limestone, absence of fresh water, and limited rain fall combined to make the soil unfertile. Yet, average temperatures in the eighties Fahrenheit and the eastern trade wind facilitated evaporation of sea water into a saturated [[brine]] for salt crystallized. Natural ponds were augmented with [[sluice]]s and [[causeway]]s. Salt originating from this province was cherished for its &quot;brilliant color, purity, and versatility,&quot; according to Jarvis. In 1708, eighteen vessels were involved in raking salt, and this number grew to 65 in 1716, during the March to November raking season. By 1740, 200 vessels were loading salt annually from Grand Turk and Salt Cay, while a few dozen rakers stayed during the winter to repair pans.&lt;ref name=Jarvis/&gt;{{rp|189–197}}

Outside any colonial jurisdiction, Great Britain nevertheless claimed the islands &quot;by right of Bermudian discovery, seasonal occupation, and improvement,&quot; according to Jarvis. Yet, France and Spain disputed Britain's claims with many attacks, coupled with those by pirates. Attacks from France and Spain commenced in 1709 and did not stop until 1764, when Great Britain's sovereignty was recognized. In 1693, Bahamas governor [[Nicholas Trott]] taxed the rakers, and renewed those taxes in 1738. Peace transformed the raking business from an almost all white enterprise, to mixed slave and free labor. Seasonal rakers also increased from 300 in 1768 to almost 800 in 1775.&lt;ref name=Jarvis/&gt;{{rp|197–210}}

When the Bermudian sloop ''Seaflower'' was seized by the Bahamians in 1701, the response of Bermuda Governor Bennett was to issue [[Letter of marque|letters of marque]] to Bermudian [[Privateer]]s. In 1706, Spanish and French forces ousted the Bermudians, but were driven out themselves three years later by a Bermudian privateer under the command of Captain [[Lewis Middleton]] in what was probably Bermuda's only independent military operation. His ship, the ''Rose'', attacked a Spanish and a French privateer holding a captive English vessel. Defeating the two enemy vessels, the ''Rose'' then cleared out the thirty-man garrison left by the Spanish and French.&lt;ref&gt;Maritimes: The Magazine of the Bermuda Maritime Museum. 2002. Vol. 15, No. 2. &quot;Foreign Interlopers at Bermuda's Turks Islands&quot;, by Dr. Bill Cooke.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1766, the [[Board of Trade]] granted Andrew Symmer, a Bermudian merchant, the Crown Agent for the Turks and Caicos Islands. Symmer then set a residency requirement of six months, modified the rakers elected government of five commissioners, initiated a mandatory militia requirement, and taxed each bushel of salt. Bahamian governor Thomas Shirley then tried to take control in 1772 and drive away the Bermudian rakers. By then, 750 of the 800 Turks Islands' rakers were from Bermuda. In 1774, Bermuda sent a sloop to protect their rakers after a Bahamian tax collector was beaten. A veto of the Bahamian Acts by the Board of Trade prevented escalating violence.&lt;ref name=Jarvis/&gt;{{rp|199,208–210}}

The Bahamas, meanwhile, was incurring considerable expense in absorbing loyalist refugees from the now-independent American colonies, and returned to the idea of taxing Turks salt for the needed funds. The Bahamian government ordered that all ships bound for the Turk Islands obtain a license at Nassau first. The Bermudians refused to do this. Following this, Bahamian authorities seized the [[Bermuda sloop]]s ''Friendship'' and ''Fanny'' in 1786. Shortly after, three Bermudian vessels were seized at Grand Caicos, with $35,000 worth of goods salvaged from a French ship. French privateers were becoming a menace to Bermudian operations in the area, at the time, but the Bahamians were their primary concern.

The Bahamian government re-introduced a tax on salt from the Turks, annexed them to the Bahamas, and created a seat in the Bahamian parliament to represent them. The Bermudians refused these efforts also, but the continual pressure from the Bahamians had a negative effect on the salt industry. In 1806, the Bermudian customs authorities went some way toward acknowledging the Bahamian annexation when it ceased to allow free exchange between the Turks and Bermuda (this affected many enslaved Bermudians, who, like the free ones, had occupied the Turks only seasonally, returning to their homes in Bermuda after the year's raking had finished).

That same year, French privateers attacked the Turks, burning ships and absconding with a large sloop. The Bahamians refused to help, and the Admiralty in Jamaica claimed the Turks were beyond its jurisdiction. Two hurricanes, the first in August 1813, the second in October 1815, destroyed more than two hundred buildings and significant salt stores; and sank many vessels. By 1815, the United States, the primary client for Turks salt, had been at war with Britain (and hence Bermuda) for three years, and had established other sources of salt.

With the destruction wrought by the storm, and the loss of market, many Bermudians abandoned the Turks, and those remaining were so distraught that they welcomed the visit of the Bahamian governor in 1819. The British government eventually assigned political control to the Bahamas, which the Turks and Caicos remained a part of until the 1840s.

One Bermudian salt raker, [[Mary Prince]], however, was to leave a scathing record of Bermuda's activities there in ''The History of Mary Prince'', a book which helped to propel the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] cause to the 1834 emancipation of slaves throughout the Empire.

===Shipbuilding and the maritime economy===
[[File:Bermuda_rig_-_17th_Century_woodcut.jpg|thumb|A 17th-century woodcut of a Bermudian sailing vessel, displaying the triangular sails of the [[Bermuda rig]].]]
{{main article|Bermuda sloop}}

With royal administration commencing under [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1683, and the end of company control in 1684, the island was able to change the basis of its economy from tobacco to maritime enterprises. The maritime economy included ship building, [[wrecking (shipwreck)|wrecking]], whaling, piloting and fishing in local waters. The population at that time consisted of 5889 whites and 1737 slaves. While Tobacco ceased to be a commercial crop by 1710, Bermuda's fleet had grown from fourteen vessels in 1679 to sixty sloops, six brigantines and four ships in 1700.&lt;ref name=Jarvis/&gt;{{rp|60–67,101,106,247}}&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt;{{rp|280,328}}

These &quot;Bermuda sloops&quot; had their origin in the ship Jacob Jacobson first built after becoming shipwrecked on the island in 1619, and were based on craft sailing on the [[Zuiderzee]] and the Dutch coastal [[sloep]]. These [[sailplan#two-masted vessel|two-masted vessel]]s, with the mast &quot;raked&quot; or inclined 15&amp;nbsp;degrees aft, carried [[fore-and-aft rig]]s of triangular [[Bermuda sail]]s. Large [[mainsail]]s were fixed to elongated [[boom (sailing)|booms]], giving the sloop a large sail area for maximum speed, averaging 3 knots, but known to exceed 5 knots. Finally, these sloops were especially adept at [[tacking (sailing)|sailing into the wind]], maneuvering, and [[close-hauled]] sailing.&lt;ref name=Jarvis/&gt;{{rp|125–130}}&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt;{{rp|348}}

Smaller vessels were originally built for local use, fishing and hauling freight and passengers about the archipelago. By the 1630s, with dwindling income from tobacco exports, largely due to increased competition as the Virginia and newer colonies in the West Indies turned to tobacco cultivation, many of the absentee landowners in England sold their shares to the managers and tenants that occupied them, who turned increasingly to subsistence crops and raising livestock. Bermuda was quickly producing more food than it could consume, and began to sell the excess to the newer colonies that were cultivating tobacco to the exclusion of food crops required for their own subsistence. As the Somers Isles Company's magazine ship would not carry such cargo, Bermudians began constructing their own larger, ocean-going vessels for this purpose. They favoured single-masted designs, more commonly with a gaff-rigged mainsail, although a single larger sail required a larger, more highly skilled, crew than two or more smaller sails.

The sloops were built from [[Bermuda cedar]], considered the best wood for shipping, according to Bermuda Governor Isaac Richier in 1691. This is because this cedar was as strong as [[American oak]], yet weighed only two thirds as much. Long lasting due to its resistance to marine organisms, the cedar also had the advantage of being readily used for ship building, and were even planned as such while still growing. Using enslaved and free labor and year-round construction, a 30-ton sloop could be built in three to four months. Bermudians also adopted a reforestation policy, with groves cultivated as long-term crops, and passed down to future generations as dowries or inheritances.&lt;ref name=Jarvis/&gt;{{rp|89–90,125–130,277–278}}

The [[Bermuda sloop]] became highly regarded for its speed and manoeuvrability, and was soon adapted for service with the [[Royal Navy]]. The Bermuda sloop {{HMS|Pickle|1800|6}} carried dispatches of the victory at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], and news of the death of [[Admiral Lord Nelson|Admiral Nelson]], to England.

===Privateering===
[[File:Bermuda_Gazette_-_12_November_1796.jpg|right|thumb|Bermuda Gazette of 12 November 1796, calling for privateering against Spain and its allies, and with advertisements for crew for two privateer vessels]]
Bermuda was a center of [[privateer]]ing for most of its early history, with Bermuda governors [[Nathaniel Butler]] and Benjamin Bennett actively encouraging the practice. [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick]] (the namesake of [[Warwick Parish, Bermuda|Warwick Parish]], was one of the major Adventurers of the Somers Isles Company due primarily to the use he realised could be made of Bermuda as a base for his privateers. Although Bermuda had no merchant or privateering fleet of its own, yet, many Bermudians left farming to work as privateers on English vessels operating from Bermuda, and in 1631 also to settle the short-lived [[Providence Island colony]] that was dedicated to privateering. During [[King George's War]], according to Jarvis, &quot;privateering became widespread, respectable, and even patriotic.&quot; At least fifteen Bermudian privateers operated in the 1740s. State-licensed, privateers had the authority to capture enemy vessels or British vessels engaged in trading [[contraband]]. Alternatively, a [[letter of marque]] could be issued to a mariner engaged in trade, giving him the authority to seize any vessel they may come across. [[Vice admiralty court]]s reviewed the legality of any capture and subsequent distribution of cargo and [[prize (law)|prizes]]. Crews were a mixture of free and enslaved labor.&lt;ref name=Jarvis/&gt;{{rp|239–247}}

Despite close links to the American colonies (and the material aid provided the to continental rebels in the form of a hundred barrels of stolen gunpowder and reportedly numerous Bermudian-built and other ships supplied by Bermudians), Bermudian privateers turned as aggressively on American shipping during the [[American War of Independence]]. An American naval captain, ordered to take his ship out of Boston Harbour to eliminate a pair of Bermudian privateering vessels, which had been picking off vessels missed by the Royal Navy, returned frustrated, saying ''the Bermudians sailed their ships two feet for every one of ours''. The only attack on Bermuda during the war was carried out by two South Carolina sloops captained by a pair of Bermudian-born brothers (they damaged a fort and spiked its guns before retreating). It greatly surprised the Americans to discover that the crews of Bermudian privateers included Black slaves, as, with limited manpower, Bermuda had legislated that a part of all Bermudian crews must be made up of Blacks. In fact, when the Bermudian privateer ''Regulator'' was captured, virtually all of her crew were found to be Black slaves. Authorities in Boston offered these men their freedom, but with families in Bermuda all seventy men elected to be treated as [[Prisoner of War|Prisoners of War]]. Sent to New York on the sloop ''Duxbury'', they seized the vessel and sailed it back to Bermuda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.amistadamerica.org/files/Files/Visit/Evocative%20Historical%20Narratives.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705055236/http://www.amistadamerica.org/files/Files/Visit/Evocative%20Historical%20Narratives.pdf |archive-date=5 July 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[War of 1812|American War of 1812]] was to be the encore of Bermudian privateering, which had died out after the 1790s, due partly to the buildup of the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|naval base in Bermuda]], which reduced the Admiralty's reliance on privateers in the western Atlantic, and partly to successful American legal suits, and claims for damages pressed against British privateers, a large portion of which were aimed squarely at the Bermudians (unfortunately for the privateers, the British government was trying to woo the United States away from its affiliation with France and so gave a favourable ear to American shipowners). During the course of the American War of 1812, Bermudian privateers were to capture 298 ships (the total captures by ''all'' British naval and privateering vessels between the Great Lakes and the West Indies was 1,593 vessels).

===Bermuda and the American War of Independence===
On the eve of the [[American Revolution|American independence]], Bermuda faced competition with its maritime economy. Bermudian emigrants to Virginia helped expand the growth of its merchant fleet, enabling it to exceed Bermuda's by 1762. By the 1770s, Virginia was launching more vessels than Bermuda. Only able to grow enough food to feed the population of 11,000 a few months out of the year, Bermudians relied on food imports from North America, and the consequent higher costs. Many Bermudians had emigrated to Belize to harvest mahogany, or to Georgia, East Florida and the Bahamas islands.&lt;ref name=Jarvis/&gt;{{rp|376–385}} Bermudians continued to fish the Grand Banks until forbidden by the Palliser's Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.heritage.nf.ca/lawfoundation/essay/part5-1.html|title=Palliser's Act, 1775: The Statutory Counter-Offensive|website=www.heritage.nf.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically, issues causing protest elsewhere little affected the island, lacking newspapers and an effective local government, which refused to raise public revenue, the island had long relied on smuggling and the circumventing of customs officers. Lacking a permanent garrison made the island immune to the [[Quartering Acts]]. Finally, the island had long been ambivalent to events in New England, whom the Bermudians considered their maritime rivals.&lt;ref name=Jarvis/&gt;{{rp|383–385}}

Bermuda's ambivalence changed in September 1774, when the [[Continental Congress]] resolved to ban trade with Great Britain, Ireland, and the West Indies after 10 September 1775. Such an embargo would mean the collapse of their intercolonial commerce, famine and civil unrest. Lacking political channels with Great Britain, [[Henry Tucker (President of the Council of Bermuda)|the Tucker Family]] met in May 1775 with eight other parishioners, and resolved to send delegates to the Continental Congress in July, with the goal of an exemption from the ban. Henry Tucker noted a clause in the ban which allowed the exchange of American goods for military supplies. The clause was confirmed by [[Benjamin Franklin]] when Tucker met with the Pennsylvania [[Committees of safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]]. Independently, Tucker's sons St. George and Thomas Tudor confirmed this business arrangement with [[Peyton Randolph]] and the Charlestown Committee of Safety, while another Bermudian, Harris, did so with [[George Washington]].&lt;ref name=Jarvis/&gt;{{rp|385–389}}

Three American vessels, independently operating from Charlestown, Philadelphia and Newport, sailed to Bermuda, and on 14 August 100 barrels of gunpowder were taken from the Bermudian magazine, while the loyalist Governor [[George James Bruere]] slept, and loaded onto these vessels. As a consequence, on 2 October the Continental Congress exempted Bermuda from their trade ban, and Bermuda thus acquired a reputation for disloyalty. In late 1775, the British Parliament passed the [[Prohibitory Act]] to prohibit trade with the American rebelling colonies, and sent HMS ''Scorpion'' to keep watch over the island. The island's forts were stripped of cannon, such that by the end of 1775, all of Bermuda's forts were without cannon, shot and powder. Yet, wartime trade of contraband continued along well established family connections. With 120 vessels by 1775, Bermuda continued to trade with [[St. Eustatius]] through 1781, and provided salt to North American ports, despite the presence of hundreds of loyal privateers.&lt;ref name=Jarvis/&gt;{{rp|389–415}}

In June 1776, HMS ''Nautilus'' secured the island, followed by {{HMS|Galatea|1776|6}} in September. Yet, the two British captains seemed more intent on capturing prize money, causing a severe food shortage on the island until the departure of ''Nautilus'' in October. After France's entry into the war in 1778, [[Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)|Sir Henry Clinton]] refortified and garrisoned the island under the command of Major [[William Sutherland (British Army officer)|William Sutherland]]. As a result, 91 French and American ships were captured in the winter of 1778–1779, bringing the population once again to the brink of starvation. Bermudian trade was severely hampered by the combination of the Royal Navy, the British garrison and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist privateers]], such that famine struck the island in 1779.&lt;ref name=Jarvis/&gt;{{rp|416–427}}

The death of George Bruere in 1780, turned the governorship over to his son, George Jr., and active loyalist. Under his leadership, smuggling was stopped, and the Bermudian colonial government populated with like-minded loyalists. Even Henry Tucker abandoned trading with the United States, because of the presence of many privateers. Loyalist privateers based in Bermuda captured 114 prizes between 1777 and 1781, while 130 were captured in 1782.&lt;ref name=Jarvis/&gt;{{rp|428–433}}

The fallout of the war was that Britain lost all of its continental naval bases between the [[Maritimes]] and Spanish [[Florida]], ultimately the West Indies. This launched Bermuda into a new prominence with the London Government, as its location, near the halfway point from Nova Scotia to the Caribbean, and off the US Atlantic Seaboard, allowed the Royal Navy to operate fully in the area, protecting British trade routes, and potentially commanding the American Atlantic coast in the event of war. The value of Bermuda in the hands of, or serving as a base for, enemies of the United States was shown by the roles it played in the [[American War of 1812]] and the [[American Civil War]]. The blockade of the Atlantic ports by the Royal Navy throughout the first war (described in the US as the ''Second War of Independence'') was orchestrated from Bermuda, and the task force that [[Burning of Washington|burned Washington DC]] in 1814 was launched from the colony. During the latter war, [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[blockade runners]] delivered European munitions into Southern harbours from Bermuda, smuggling cotton in the reverse direction.

Consequently, the very features that made Bermuda such a prized base for the Royal Navy (its headquarters in the North Atlantic and West Indies until after the [[Second World War]]), also meant it was perpetually threatened by US invasion, as the US would have liked to both deny the base to an enemy, and use it as a way to extend its defences hundreds of miles out to sea, which would not happen until the Second World War.

As a result of the large regular army garrison established to protect the naval facilities, Bermuda's parliament allowed the Bermudian militia to become defunct after the end of the American war in 1815. More profound changes took place, however. The post American independence buildup of Royal Navy facilities in Bermuda meant the Admiralty placed less reliance on Bermudian privateers in the area. Combined with the effects of the American lawsuits, this meant the activity died out in Bermuda until a brief resurgence during the American War of 1812. With the American continental ports having become foreign territory, the Bermudian merchant shipping trade was seriously injured. During the course of American War of 1812, the Americans had developed other sources for salt, and Bermudians salt trade fell upon hard times. Control of the [[Turks Islands]] ultimately passed into the hands of Bermuda's sworn enemy, the [[Bahamas]], in 1819. The shipbuilding industry had caused the deforestation of Bermuda's [[Bermuda cedar|cedar]] by the start of the 19th century. As ships became larger, increasingly were built from metal, and with the advent of steam power, and with the vastly reduced opportunities Bermudians found for commerce due to US independence and the greater control exerted over their economies by developing territories, Bermuda's shipbuilding industry and maritime trades were slowly strangled.

The chief leg of the Bermudian economy became defence infrastructure. Even after tourism began in the later 19th century, Bermuda remained, in the eyes of London, a base more than a colony, and this led to a change in the political dynamics within Bermuda as its political and economic ties to Britain were strengthened, and its independence on the world stage was diminished. By the end of the 19th century, except for the presence of the naval and military facilities, Bermuda was thought of by non-Bermudians and Bermudians alike as a quiet, rustic backwater, completely at odds with the role it had played in the development of the English-speaking Atlantic world, a change that had begun with American independence.

Following the [[American Revolution]] and the loss of Britain's ports in its former continental colonies, Bermuda was also used as a stopover point between Canada and Britain's Caribbean possessions, and assumed a new strategic prominence for the Royal Navy. [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]], a centrally located port founded in 1790, became the seat of government in 1815. This was partly resultant from the Royal Navy having invested twelve years, following American independence, in charting Bermuda's reefs. It did this in order to locate the deepwater channel by which shipping might reach the islands in, and at the West of, the Great Sound, which it had begun acquiring with a view to building a [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|naval base]]. However, that channel also gave access to Hamilton Harbour.

In 1811, the [[Royal Navy]] started building the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|large dockyard]] on [[Ireland Island, Bermuda|Ireland Island]], in the west of the chain, to serve as its principal naval base guarding the western Atlantic Ocean shipping lanes. To guard it, the [[British Army]] built up a large [[Bermuda Garrison]], and heavily fortified the archipelago.

During the [[War of 1812]] between Britain and the United States, the British attacks on [[Burning of Washington|Washington, D.C. and the Chesapeake]] were planned and launched from Bermuda, where the headquarters of the Royal Navy's North American Station had recently been moved from [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]].

In 1816, James Arnold, the son of [[Benedict Arnold]], fortified Bermuda's Royal Naval Dockyard against possible US attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Howes, James: [http://www.atlascom.us/keys.htm &quot;Attack on Baltimore Launched from Bermuda in 'War of 1812'&quot;] 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the [[National Museum of Bermuda]], which incorporates Bermuda's Maritime Museum, occupies the [[Keep]] of the Royal Naval Dockyard, including the Commissioner's House, and exhibits artifacts of the base's military history.

In the 1860s, the major build-up of naval and military infrastructure brought vital money into Bermuda at a time when its traditional maritime industries were giving way under the assault of steel hulls and steam propulsion. The American Civil War, also, briefly, provided a shot-in-the-arm to the local economy.

As a result of Bermuda's proximity to the southeastern US coast, during the [[American Civil War]] [[Confederate States]] [[Blockade runners of the American Civil War|blockade runners]] frequently used it as a stopping point base for runs to and from the Southern states or England to evade Union naval vessels on blockade patrol, delivering much needed war goods from England and for transporting much needed cotton back to England. The old Globe Hotel in St George's, which was a centre of intrigue for Confederate agents, is preserved as a public museum.

====Mozambique====
In [[Mozambique]], a new belief in spirit possession appeared after the [[Mozambican Civil War]]. These spirits, called ''gamba'', are said to be identified as dead soldiers, and allegedly overwhelmingly possess women. Prior to the war, spirit possession was limited to certain families and was less common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Igreja |first1=Victor |last2=Dias-Lambranca |first2=Béatrice |last3=Richters |first3=Annemiek |title=Gamba spirits, gender relations, and healing in post-civil war Gorongosa, Mozambique |journal=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute |date=June 2008 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=353–371 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9655.2008.00506.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A now extinct spirit possession cult existed among the [[Hadimu]] women of [[Zanzibar]], revering a spirit called ''kitimiri''. This cult described in an 1869 account by a French missionary.

====South Africa====
A belief in spirit possession appears among the [[Xesibe]], a [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] speaking people from [[Transkei]], [[South Africa]]. The majority of the supposedly possessed are married women. The condition of spirit possession among them is called ''inwatso''. Those who develop the condition of ''inwatso'' are regarded as having a special calling to divine the future. They are first treated with sympathy, and then with respect as they allegedly develop their abilities to foretell the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O'Connell |first1=M.

==African diasporic traditions==

===Haitian Vodou===
In [[Haitian Vodou]] and [[Afro-American religion|related African diaspora traditions]], one way that those who participate or practice can have a spiritual experience is by being possessed by the ''[[Loa]]'' (or ''lwa''). When the ''loa'' descends upon a practitioner, the practitioner's body is being used by the spirit, according to the tradition. Some spirits are believed to be able to give prophecies of upcoming events or situations pertaining to the possessed one, also called ''Chwal'' or the &quot;Horse of the Spirit.&quot; Practitioners describe this as a beautiful but very tiring experience. Most people who are possessed by the spirit describe the onset as a feeling of blackness or energy flowing through their body as if they were being electrocuted. According to Vodou believers, when this occurs, it is a sign that a possession is about to take place.{{fact|date=November 2020}}

According to tradition, the practitioner has no recollection of the possession and in fact when the possessing spirit leaves the body, the possessed one is tired and wonders what has happened during the possession. It is also believed that there are those who feign possessions because they want attention or a feeling of importance, because those who are possessed carry a high importance in ceremony. Often, a ''chwal'' will undergo some form of trial or testing to make sure that the possession is allegedly genuine. As an example, someone possessed by one of the [[Guédé]] spirits may be offered ''piment'', a [[liqueur]] made by steeping twenty-one [[chili pepper]]s in ''kleren'', a potent [[alcoholic beverage]]. If the chwal consumes the piment without showing any evidence of pain or discomfort, the possession is regarded as genuine.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

===Umbanda===
The concept of spirit possession is also found in [[Umbanda]], an Afro-Brazilian folk religion. According to tradition, one such possessing spirit is [[Pomba Gira]], who possesses both women and effeminate males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hayes |first1=Kelly E. |title=Wicked Women and Femmes Fatales: Gender, Power, and Pomba Gira in Brazil |journal=History of Religions |date=August 2008 |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=1–21 |doi=10.1086/592152 |s2cid=162196759 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
According to the Indian medical literature and [[Vajrayana|Tantric Buddhist]] scriptures, most of the &quot;seizers,&quot; or those that threaten the lives of young children, appear in animal form: cow, lion, fox, monkey, horse, dog, pig, cat, crow, pheasant, owl, and snake. But apart from these &quot;nightmare shapes,&quot; it is believed the impersonation or incarnation of animals could in some circumstances also be highly beneficial, according to Michel Strickmann.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strickmann 2002, p. 251&quot;&gt;Michel Strickmann (2002), ''Chinese Magical Medicine'', edited by Bernard Faure, Stanford University Press, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ch'i Chung-fu, a Chinese gynecologist writing early in the thirteenth century, wrote that in addition to five sorts of falling frenzy classified according to their causative factors, there were also four types of other frenzies distinguished by the sounds and movements given off by the victim during his seizure: cow, horse, pig, and dog frenzies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strickmann 2002, p. 251&quot;/&gt;

===East Asian religions===

Certain sects of [[Taoism]], [[Korean shamanism]], [[Shinto]], some Japanese new religious movements, and other East Asian religions feature the idea of spirit possession. Some sects feature shamans who supposedly become possessed, or [[mediumship|mediums]] who allegedly channel beings' supernatural power, or enchanters who it is said imbue or foster spirits within objects, like samurai swords.&lt;ref&gt;Ed.

====Rajasthan====
The concept of spirit possession exists in the culture of modern [[Rajasthan]]. Some of the spirits allegedly possessing Rajasthanis are seen as good and beneficial, while others are seen as malevolent. The good spirits are said to include murdered royalty, the underworld god [[Bhaironji]], and [[Muslim]] saints &amp; fakirs. Bad spirits are believed to include perpetual debtors who die in debt, stillborn infants, deceased widows, and foreign tourists. The supposedly possessed individual is referred to as a ''ghorala'', or &quot;mount&quot;. Possession, even if by a benign spirit, is regarded as undesirable, as it is seen to entail loss of self-control, and violent emotional outbursts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Snodgrass |first1=Jeffrey G. |title=Imitation Is Far More than the Sincerest of Flattery: The Mimetic Power of Spirit Possession in Rajasthan, India |journal=Cultural Anthropology |date=2002 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=32–64 |doi=10.1525/can.2002.17.1.32 |jstor=656672 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tamil people|Tamil]] women in India are said to experience possession by ''peye'' spirits.

===Indonesian traditions===

====Bali====
The animist traditions of the island of [[Bali]] ([[Indonesia]]) include a practice called ''[[sanghyang]]'', induction of voluntary possession trance states for specific purposes. Roughly similar to voluntary possession in Vaudon (Voodoo), ''sanghyang'' is considered a sacred state in which [[hyang]]s (deities) or helpful spirits temporarily inhabit the bodies of participants. The purpose of sanghyang is believed to be to cleanse people and places of evil influences and restore spiritual balance. Thus, it is often referred to as an exorcism ceremony.{{fact|date=November 2020}}

====Sulawesi====
The women of the [[Bonerate people]] of [[Sulawesi]], Indonesia practice a possession-trance ritual in which they smother glowing embers with their bare feet at the climax. The fact that they are not burned in the process is considered proof of the authenticity of the possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Broch |first1=Harald Beyer |title='Crazy Women are Performing in Sombali': A Possession-Trance Ritual on Bonerate, Indonesia |journal=Ethos |date=1985 |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=262–282 |doi=10.1525/eth.1985.13.3.02a00040 |jstor=640005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaysian traditions===
Female workers in [[Malaysia]]n factories have allegedly become possessed by spirits, and factory owners generally regard it as [[mass hysteria]] and an intrusion of irrational and archaic beliefs into a modern setting.&lt;ref name=Ong1988&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ong |first1=Aihwa |title=the production of possession: spirits and the multinational corporation in Malaysia |journal=American Ethnologist |date=February 1988 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=28–42 |doi=10.1525/ae.1988.15.1.02a00030 |s2cid=30121345 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anthropologist Aihwa Ong noted that spirit possession beliefs in Malaysia were typically held by older, married women, whereas the female factory workers are typically young and unmarried. She connects this to the rapid industrialization and modernization of Malaysia. Ong argued that spirit possession is a traditional way of rebelling against authority without punishment, and suggests that it is a means of protesting the untenable working conditions and sexual harassment that the women were compelled to endure.&lt;ref name=Ong1988/&gt;

===Sri Lankan traditions===
The [[Coast Veddas]], a social group within the minority group of [[Sri Lankan Tamil people]] in [[Eastern Province, Sri Lanka]], enter trances during religious festivals in which they are regarded as being possessed by a spirit. Although they speak a dialect of [[Sri Lankan Tamil dialect|Tamil]], during trances they will sometimes use a mixed language that contains words from the [[Vedda language]].&lt;ref name=JonDart83&gt;Jon Dart (Samarasinghe, S.

===Micronesia===
The concept of spirit possession appears in [[Chuuk State]], one of the four states of [[Federated States of Micronesia]]. Although Chuuk is an overwhelmingly Christian society, traditional beliefs in spirit possession by the dead still exist, usually held by women, and &quot;events&quot; are usually brought on by family conflicts. The supposed spirits, speaking through the women, typically admonish family members to treat each other better.&lt;ref&gt;Hezel, Francis X. 1993 Spirit Possession in Chuuk: Socio-Cultural Interpretation.

The works of [[Jean Rouch]], [[Germaine Dieterlen]], and [[Marcel Griaule]] have been extensively cited in research studies on possession in [[Western Africa]] that extended to [[Brasil]] and North America due to the [[slave trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Queiroz |first1=Ruben Caixeta de |title=Between the sensible and the intelligible: Anthropology and the cinema of Marcel Mauss and Jean Rouch |journal=Vibrant: Virtual Brazilian Anthropology |date=December 2012 |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=184–211 |doi=10.1590/S1809-43412012000200007 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Heusch |first1=Luc |authorlink1=Luc de Heusch |title=Jean Rouch and the Birth of Visual Anthropology: A Brief History of the Comité international du film ethnographique |journal=Visual Anthropology |date=2 October 2007 |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=365–386 |doi=10.1080/08949460701424155 |s2cid=143785372 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anthropologist I.M. Lewis noted that women are more likely to be involved in spirit possession cults than men are, and postulated that such cults act as a means of compensation for their exclusion from other spheres within their respective cultures.&lt;ref name=jstor2796794/&gt;

===Physical anthropology===
Anthropologists Alice B. Kehoe and Dody H. Giletti argued that the reason that women are more commonly seen in [[Afro-Eurasia]]n spirit possession cults is because of deficiencies in [[thiamine]], [[tryptophan]]-[[niacin]], [[calcium]], and [[vitamin D]]. They argued that a combination of poverty and food taboos cause this problem, and that it is exacerbated by the strains of pregnancy and lactation. They postulated that the involuntary symptoms of these deficiencies affecting their nervous systems have been institutionalized as spirit possession.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kehoe &amp; Giletti 1981&quot;/&gt;

      <text bytes="48126" xml:space="preserve">{{Short description|Theory of equilibrium between supply and demand}}{{Economics sidebar}}
In [[economics]], '''general equilibrium theory''' attempts to explain the behavior of supply, demand, and prices in a whole economy with several or many interacting markets, by seeking to prove that the interaction of demand and supply will result in an overall [[List of types of equilibrium#Economics|general equilibrium]]. General equilibrium theory contrasts to the theory of [[partial equilibrium|''partial'' equilibrium]], which only analyzes single markets.

General equilibrium theory both studies economies using the model of equilibrium pricing and seeks to determine in which circumstances the assumptions of general equilibrium will hold. The theory dates to the 1870s, particularly the work of French economist [[Léon Walras]] in his pioneering 1874 work ''Elements of Pure Economics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walras|first=Léon|authorlink=Léon Walras|origyear=1877|year=1954|title=Elements of Pure Economics|url=https://archive.org/details/elementsofpureec0000walr|url-access=registration|location= |publisher=Irwin|isbn=978-0-678-06028-5}} Scroll to chapter-preview [https://books.google.com/books?id=QBklPNvBgCcC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false links.]&lt;/ref&gt;

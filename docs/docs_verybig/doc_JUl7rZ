===''University Challenge''===
{{main|University Challenge}}
A [[United Kingdom|British]] version of the televised College Bowl competition was launched as ''[[University Challenge]]'' in 1962. The program, presented by [[Bamber Gascoigne]], produced by [[Granada Television]] and broadcast across the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, was very popular and ran until it was taken off the air in 1987. In 1994 the show was resurrected by the [[BBC]] with [[Jeremy Paxman]] as the new quizmaster. It remains very popular in Britain. The show, and the catch phrase used by Gascoigne (and later Paxman) before each toss-up question, &quot;Your starter for 10,&quot; was the inspiration for the novel ''[[Starter for Ten (novel)|Starter for 10]]'', and the subsequent [[Starter for 10 (film)|film]]. A [[University Challenge (New Zealand)|New Zealand version]] of ''University Challenge'' ran from 1976 to 1989, and was revived in 2014.

===''Challenging Times''===
{{main|Challenging Times}}
An [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] version of the competition called ''[[Challenging Times]]'' ran between 1991 and 2002. It was sponsored by [[The Irish Times]] newspaper, and presented by Kevin Myers, then a columnist with that newspaper. Over the course of the show, [[University College Cork]] had the most wins, with three, while [[National University of Ireland, Galway]] qualified for the most finals, winning twice and placing second twice.

==Later history==
The game returned to radio from 1979 to 1982, hosted by [[Art Fleming]] (the host of the original ''[[Jeopardy!]]''), with the 1978 and 1979 national tournament semi-finals and finals appearing on syndicated television. The two champions from those years competed against teams from the UK for the &quot;College Bowl World Championship,&quot; which were also televised; in 1978, [[Stanford University]] played a team of UK all-stars under College Bowl rules, and in 1979, [[Davidson College]] played [[Sidney Sussex|Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge University]] under University Challenge rules. (The UK teams won in both years.) There have been two television appearances since then; the 1984 tournament semi-finals and finals aired on [[NBC]], hosted by [[Pat Sajak]] (of ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' fame), and the entire 1987 tournament on [[Disney Channel]], hosted by [[Dick Cavett]]. The [[University of Minnesota]] won both iterations.

In 1970, modern quiz bowl invitational tournaments began with the Southeastern Invitational Tournament, and the circuit expanded through the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. These tournaments increasingly made various modifications to the College Bowl format, and came to be known as [[quiz bowl]]. Earlier invitational tournaments, such as the ''Syra-quiz'' at [[Syracuse University]], had occurred in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hendricks Chapel: Seventy-five Years of Service to Syracuse University|page=209|first1=Phillips|last1=Richard L.|last2=Wright|first2=Donald G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In 1976, the program became affiliated with the Association of College Unions International (ACUI) [http://www.acui.org/Acui/Programs/Collegebowl/index.cfm], which continued to promote the competition as a non-broadcast event after the demise of the radio and television experiments.  That affiliation ended in 2008, and the College Bowl campus program is no longer active. The College Bowl Company continues to create, produce and license versions of College Bowl in the United States and elsewhere, including ''Africa Challenge'' (2007–10), which featured schools from Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia; ''University Challenge'' in New Zealand and India; ''University Challenge'' in the United Kingdom, which is seen every week in prime time on [[BBC Two|BBC 2]]; and the [[Honda Campus All-Star Challenge]] at [[historically black colleges|historically black colleges and universities]], sponsored by [[American Honda Motor Company|American Honda]], which has awarded over $10,000,000 in institutional grants since its debut in 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;collegebowl.com&quot;/&gt;

In the 1990s with the rise of the [[Academic Competition Federation]] and [[National Academic Quiz Tournaments]], both with their own national championships, a number of schools (such as the University of Maryland, the University of Chicago, both former national champions, and recent runner up Georgia Tech) &quot;de-affiliated&quot; from College Bowl. Factors which contributed to this process included, among other issues, eligibility rules for College Bowl (which limited the number of graduate students who could compete and required a minimum courseload), higher participation costs for College Bowl relative to these other formats, and concerns regarding the quality and difficulty of the questions used in College Bowl competitions.

On November 24, 2020, NBCUniversal announced a revival of the show with [[Peyton Manning]] as host and a ten-episode run has been ordered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Revival&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Peyton Manning Set to Quarterback New NBC Battle of the Brain Series 'College Bowl' |url=https://edit.nbcumv.com/news/peyton-manning-set-quarterback-new-nbc-battle-brains-series-%E2%80%98college-bowl%E2%80%99?division=1&amp;network=33129 |website=NBCUniversal Media Village |publisher=Comcast, Inc. |access-date=2020-11-24 |ref=Manning2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
* In 2009, brief scenes from the early 1960s episodes of ''College Bowl'' with Allen Ludden appeared in the film ''[[Gifted Hands]]''. 
* A brief scene of ''GE College Bowl'' with Allen Ludden appeared in the 1982 film ''[[Diner (1982 film)|Diner]]''.

==Criticism==
In the 1987 and 1988 regional tournaments, College Bowl was accused of recycling questions from previous tournaments, thereby possibly compromising the integrity of results.&lt;ref name=&quot;Siegel&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/culturebox/2012/05/quiz_bowl_is_it_the_ultimate_test_of_smarts_or_an_overblown_game_of_trivial_pursuit_.single.html|title=The Super Bowl of the Mind|first=Alan|last=Siegel|date=May 3, 2012|accessdate=December 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date = Spring 1988|title  =1988/1982 &quot;COLLEGE&quot; BOWL CO.

Especially in the early 1990s, The College Bowl Company attempted to collect licensing fees based on [[copyright]] and [[trade dress]] claims from invitational tournaments that employed formats that it claimed were similar to College Bowl, and threatened not to allow schools that failed to pay these fees to compete in College Bowl events. As it was, the company's intellectual property claims were never tested in court and these events along with the growing Internet community of quiz bowl players led to a great increase in teams, tournaments, and formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jennings|first=Ken|title=Brainiac: Adventures in the Curious, Competitive, Compulsive World of Trivia Buffs|publisher=Villard|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4000-6445-8|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/brainiac00kenj}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No tournament was held in 1983 or 1985, though regional tournaments were held in each year.

†Tied for third (lost in semifinals, no playoff for third place).

††In 1994, Brigham Young University finished second in the round-robin, qualifying for the final series.  However, as the final best-two-out-of-three series was held on Sunday, the team [[Sabbath in Christianity#The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|declined to participate]], and the University of Virginia took their place instead. Brigham Young was awarded third place.

      <text bytes="13096" xml:space="preserve">'''Cox's theorem''', named after the physicist [[Richard Threlkeld Cox]], is a derivation of the laws of [[probability theory]] from a certain set of [[postulates]]. This derivation justifies the so-called &quot;logical&quot; interpretation of probability, as the laws of probability derived by Cox's theorem are applicable to any proposition. Logical (a.k.a. objective Bayesian) probability is a type of [[Bayesian probability]]. Other forms of Bayesianism, such as the subjective interpretation, are given other justifications.

==Cox's assumptions==
Cox wanted his system to satisfy the following conditions:

#Divisibility and comparability&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; The plausibility of a [[proposition]] is a real number and is dependent on information we have related to the proposition.
#Common sense&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Plausibilities should vary sensibly with the assessment of plausibilities in the model.
#Consistency&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; If the plausibility of a proposition can be derived in many ways, all the results must be equal.

The postulates as stated here are taken from Arnborg and Sjödin.&lt;ref name=&quot;AS1999&quot;&gt;Stefan Arnborg and Gunnar Sjödin, ''On the foundations of Bayesianism,'' Preprint: Nada, KTH (1999) &amp;mdash; ftp://ftp.nada.kth.se/pub/documents/Theory/Stefan-Arnborg/06arnborg.ps &amp;mdash; ftp://ftp.nada.kth.se/pub/documents/Theory/Stefan-Arnborg/06arnborg.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AS2000a&quot;&gt;Stefan Arnborg and Gunnar Sjödin, ''A note on the foundations of Bayesianism,'' Preprint: Nada, KTH (2000a) &amp;mdash; ftp://ftp.nada.kth.se/pub/documents/Theory/Stefan-Arnborg/fobshle.ps &amp;mdash; ftp://ftp.nada.kth.se/pub/documents/Theory/Stefan-Arnborg/fobshle.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AS2000b&quot;&gt;Stefan Arnborg and Gunnar Sjödin, &quot;Bayes rules in finite models,&quot; in ''European Conference on Artificial Intelligence,'' Berlin, (2000b) &amp;mdash; ftp://ftp.nada.kth.se/pub/documents/Theory/Stefan-Arnborg/fobc1.ps &amp;mdash; ftp://ftp.nada.kth.se/pub/documents/Theory/Stefan-Arnborg/fobc1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;[[Common sense]]&quot; includes consistency with Aristotelian [[logic]] in the sense that logically equivalent propositions shall have the same plausibility.

The postulates as originally stated by Cox were not mathematically
rigorous (although better than the informal description above), e.g.,
as noted by Halpern.&lt;ref name=&quot;H99a&quot;&gt;Joseph Y. Halpern, &quot;A counterexample to theorems of Cox and Fine,&quot; ''Journal of AI research,'' 10, 67&amp;ndash;85 (1999) &amp;mdash; http://www.jair.org/media/536/live-536-2054-jair.ps.Z {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125021821/http://www.jair.org/media/536/live-536-2054-jair.ps.Z |date=2015-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;H99b&quot;&gt;Joseph Y. Halpern, &quot;Technical Addendum, Cox's theorem Revisited,&quot; ''Journal of AI research,'' 11, 429&amp;ndash;435 (1999) &amp;mdash; http://www.jair.org/media/644/live-644-1840-jair.ps.Z {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125022616/http://www.jair.org/media/644/live-644-1840-jair.ps.Z |date=2015-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However it appears to be possible
to augment them with various mathematical assumptions made either
implicitly or explicitly by Cox to produce a valid proof.

Cox's notation:
:The plausibility of a proposition &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; given some related information &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;A\mid X&lt;/math&gt;.

Cox's postulates and functional equations are:
*The plausibility of the [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] &lt;math&gt;AB&lt;/math&gt; of two propositions &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, given some related information &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, is determined by the plausibility of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and that of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;AX&lt;/math&gt;.
:In form of a [[functional equation]]
::&lt;math&gt;AB\mid X=g(A\mid X,B\mid AX)&lt;/math&gt;
:Because of the associative nature of the conjunction in propositional logic, the consistency with logic gives a functional equation saying that the function &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is an [[associativity|associative]] binary operation.
*Additionally, Cox postulates the function &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; to be [[monotonic function|monotonic]].
:All strictly increasing associative binary operations on the real numbers are isomorphic to multiplication of numbers in a [[Interval (mathematics)|subinterval]] of {{closed-closed|0, +∞}}, which means that there is a monotonic function &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; mapping plausibilities to {{closed-closed|0, +∞}} such that
::&lt;math&gt;w(AB\mid X)=w(A\mid X)w(B\mid AX)&lt;/math&gt;
*In case &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is certain, we have &lt;math&gt;AB\mid X=B\mid X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A\mid BX=A\mid X&lt;/math&gt; due to the requirement of consistency. The general equation then leads to
:&lt;math&gt;w(B\mid X)=w(A\mid X)w(B\mid X)&lt;/math&gt;
:This shall hold for any proposition &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, which leads to
::&lt;math&gt;w(A\mid X)=1&lt;/math&gt;
*In case &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is impossible, we have &lt;math&gt;AB\mid X=A\mid X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A\mid BX=A\mid X&lt;/math&gt; due to the requirement of consistency. The general equation then leads to
:&lt;math&gt;w(A\mid X)=w(A\mid X)w(B\mid X)&lt;/math&gt;
:This shall hold for any proposition &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, which, without loss of generality, leads to a solution
::&lt;math&gt;w(A\mid X)=0&lt;/math&gt;
::Due to the requirement of monotonicity, this means that &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; maps plausibilities to interval {{closed-closed|0, 1}}.

*The plausibility of a proposition determines the plausibility of the proposition's [[negation]].
:This postulates the existence of a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; such that
::&lt;math&gt;w(\text{not } A\mid X)=f(w(A\mid X))&lt;/math&gt;
:Because &quot;a double negative is an affirmative&quot;, consistency with logic gives a functional equation
::&lt;math&gt;f(f(x))=x,&lt;/math&gt;
:saying that the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Involution_(mathematics)#Involutions_in_mathematical_logic|involution]], i.e., it is its own inverse.
*Furthermore, Cox postulates the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to be monotonic.

:The above functional equations and consistency with logic imply that
::&lt;math&gt;w(AB\mid X)=w(A\mid X)f(w(\text{not }B\mid AX))=w(A\mid X)f\left( {w(A\text{ not }B\mid X) \over w(A\mid X)} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
:Since &lt;math&gt;AB&lt;/math&gt; is logically equivalent to &lt;math&gt;BA&lt;/math&gt;, we also get
::&lt;math&gt;w(A\mid X)f\left( {w(A\text{ not }B\mid X) \over w(A\mid X)} \right)=w(B\mid X)f\left( {w(B\text{ not }A\mid X) \over w(B\mid X)} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:If, in particular, &lt;math&gt;B=\text{ not }(AD)&lt;/math&gt;, then also &lt;math&gt;A\text{ not } B = \text{not }B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B\text{ not }A=\text{ not }A&lt;/math&gt; and we get
::&lt;math&gt;w(A\text{ not }B\mid X)=w(\text{not }B\mid X)=f(w(B\mid X))&lt;/math&gt;
:and
::&lt;math&gt;w(B\text{ not }A\mid X)=w(\text{not }A\mid X)=f(w(A\mid X))&lt;/math&gt;
:Abbreviating &lt;math&gt;w(A\mid X)=x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w(B\mid X)=y&lt;/math&gt; we get the functional equation
::&lt;math&gt;x\,f\left({f(y) \over x}\right)=y\,f\left({f(x) \over y}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

==Implications of Cox's postulates==
The laws of probability derivable from these postulates are the following.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaynes2003&quot;&gt;[[Edwin Thompson Jaynes]], ''Probability Theory: The Logic of Science,'' Cambridge University Press (2003). &amp;mdash;  preprint version (1996) at {{cite web

}}; Chapters 1 to 3 of published version at http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/prob/book.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;A\mid B&lt;/math&gt; be the plausibility of the proposition &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; satisfying Cox's postulates. Then there is a function &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; mapping plausibilities to interval [0,1] and a positive number &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; such that

# Certainty is represented by &lt;math&gt;w(A\mid B)=1.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;w^m(A|B)+w^m(\text{not }A\mid B)=1.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;w(AB\mid C)=w(A\mid C)w(B\mid AC)=w(B\mid C)w(A\mid BC).&lt;/math&gt;

It is important to note that the postulates imply only these general properties. We may recover the usual laws of probability by setting a new function, conventionally denoted &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Pr&lt;/math&gt;, equal to &lt;math&gt;w^m&lt;/math&gt;. Then we obtain the laws of probability in a more familiar form:

# Certain truth is represented by &lt;math&gt;\Pr(A\mid B)=1&lt;/math&gt;, and certain falsehood by &lt;math&gt;\Pr(A\mid B)=0.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\Pr(A\mid B)+\Pr(\text{not }A\mid B)=1.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\Pr(AB\mid C)=\Pr(A\mid C)\Pr(B\mid AC)=\Pr(B\mid C)\Pr(A\mid BC).&lt;/math&gt;

Rule 2 is a rule for negation, and rule 3 is a rule for conjunction. Given that any proposition containing conjunction, [[disjunction]], and negation can be equivalently rephrased using conjunction and negation alone (the [[conjunctive normal form]]), we can now handle any compound proposition.

The laws thus derived yield [[Measure (mathematics)|finite additivity]] of probability, but not [[Measure (mathematics)|countable additivity]]. The [[Probability axioms|measure-theoretic formulation of Kolmogorov]] assumes that a probability measure is countably additive. This slightly stronger condition is necessary for the proof of certain theorems.{{Citation needed|reason=What theorems?|date=April 2017}}

==Interpretation and further discussion==
Cox's theorem has come to be used as one of the [[theory of justification|justification]]s for the
use of [[Bayesian probability theory]].  For example, in Jaynes&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaynes2003&quot; /&gt; it is
discussed in detail in chapters 1 and 2 and is a cornerstone for the
rest of the book.  Probability is interpreted as a [[formal system]] of
[[logic]], the natural extension of [[Aristotelian logic]] (in which every
statement is either true or false) into the realm of reasoning in the
presence of uncertainty.

It has been debated to what degree the theorem excludes alternative models for reasoning about [[uncertainty]].  For example, if certain &quot;unintuitive&quot; mathematical assumptions were dropped then alternatives could be devised, e.g., an example provided by Halpern.&lt;ref name=&quot;H99a&quot; /&gt; However Arnborg and Sjödin&lt;ref name=&quot;AS1999&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AS2000a&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AS2000b&quot; /&gt; suggest additional
&quot;common sense&quot; postulates, which would allow the assumptions to be relaxed in some cases while still ruling out the Halpern example. Other approaches were devised by Hardy&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hardy, &quot;Scaled Boolean algebras&quot;, ''[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01968858 Advances in Applied Mathematics]'', August 2002, pages 243&amp;ndash;292 (or  [https://arxiv.org/abs/math.PR/0203249 preprint]); Hardy has said, &quot;I assert there that I think Cox's assumptions are too strong, although I don't really say why. I do say what I would replace them with.&quot; (The quote is from a Wikipedia discussion page, not from the article.)&lt;/ref&gt; or Dupré and Tipler.&lt;ref name=&quot;rbp&quot;&gt;Dupré, Maurice J. &amp; Tipler, Frank J.

The original formulation of Cox's theorem is in {{Harvtxt|Cox|1946}} which is extended with additional results and more discussion in {{Harvtxt|Cox|1961}}. Jaynes&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaynes2003&quot; /&gt; cites Abel&lt;ref&gt;[[Niels Henrik Abel]] &quot;Untersuchung der Functionen zweier unabhängig veränderlichen Gröszen ''x'' und ''y'', wie ''f''(''x'', ''y''), welche die Eigenschaft haben, dasz ''f''[''z'', ''f''(''x'',''y'')] eine symmetrische Function von ''z'', ''x'' und ''y'' ist.&quot;, ''Jour. Reine u. angew. Math.'' (Crelle's Jour.), 1, 11&amp;ndash;15, (1826).&lt;/ref&gt; for the first known use of the associativity functional equation. Aczél&lt;ref&gt;[[János Aczél (mathematician)|János Aczél]], ''Lectures on Functional Equations and their Applications,'' Academic Press, New York, (1966).&lt;/ref&gt; provides a long proof of the &quot;associativity equation&quot; (pages 256-267). Jaynes&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaynes2003&quot; /&gt;{{rp|27}} reproduces the shorter proof by Cox in which differentiability is assumed.

'''Ohm's law''' states that the [[electric current|current]] through a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] between two points is directly [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[voltage]] across the two points. Introducing the constant of proportionality, the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

More specifically, Ohm's law states that the ''R'' in this relation is constant, independent of the current.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ohm's law is an [[empirical law|empirical relation]] which accurately describes the conductivity of the vast majority of [[electrical conductor|electrically conductive materials]] over many orders of magnitude of current.  However some materials do not obey Ohm's law, these are called [[Non-ohmic resistance|non-ohmic]].

The law was named after the German physicist [[Georg Ohm]], who, in a treatise published in 1827, described measurements of applied voltage and current through simple electrical circuits containing various lengths of wire. Ohm explained his experimental results by a slightly more complex equation than the modern form above (see ''{{section link|#History}}'' below).

In physics, the term ''Ohm's law'' is also used to refer to various generalizations of the law; for example the [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] form of the law used in [[electromagnetics]] and material science:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \sigma \mathbf{E},&lt;/math&gt;

where '''J''' is the [[current density]] at a given location in a resistive material, '''E''' is the electric field at that location, and ''σ'' ([[sigma]]) is a material-dependent parameter called the [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]].  This reformulation of Ohm's law is due to [[Gustav Kirchhoff]].&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Darrigol, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzeYSbqITWkC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=%22alternative+formulation+of+Ohm%27s+law%22+ISBN0198505949&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22alternative%20formulation%20of%20Ohm%27s%20law%22%20isbn%3A0198505949&amp;f=false ''Electrodynamics from Ampère to Einstein''], p. 70, Oxford University Press, 2000 {{ISBN|0-19-850594-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Ohm3.gif|thumb|200px|Georg Ohm]]
In January 1781, before [[Georg Ohm]]'s work, [[Henry Cavendish]] experimented with [[Leyden jar]]s and glass tubes of varying diameter and length filled with salt solution.  He measured the current by noting how strong a shock he felt as he completed the circuit with his body.  Cavendish wrote that the &quot;velocity&quot; (current) varied directly as the &quot;degree of electrification&quot; (voltage). He did not communicate his results to other scientists at the time,&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Electricity|volume=9|page=182|first=John Ambrose |last=Fleming}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his results were unknown until [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] published them in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;Sanford P. Bordeau (1982)  ''Volts to Hertz...the Rise of Electricity.''  Burgess Publishing Company, Minneapolis, MN.  pp. 86–107, {{ISBN|0-8087-4908-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Ronalds]] delineated &quot;intensity&quot; (voltage) and &quot;quantity&quot; (current) for the [[Voltaic pile#Dry pile|dry pile]]—a high voltage source—in 1814 using a [[Electrometer#Gold-leaf electrometer|gold-leaf electrometer]].  He found for a dry pile that the relationship between the two parameters was not proportional under certain meteorological conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.

Ohm did his work on resistance in the years 1825 and 1826, and published his results in 1827 as the book ''Die galvanische Kette, mathematisch bearbeitet'' (&quot;The galvanic circuit investigated mathematically&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He drew considerable inspiration from [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier]]'s work on heat conduction in the theoretical explanation of his work.  For experiments, he initially used [[voltaic pile]]s, but later used a [[thermocouple]] as this provided a more stable voltage source in terms of internal resistance and constant voltage.  He used a galvanometer to measure current, and knew that the voltage between the thermocouple terminals was proportional to the junction temperature.  He then added test wires of varying length, diameter, and material to complete the circuit.  He found that his data could be modeled through the equation
:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{a}{b + l},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''x'' was the reading from the [[galvanometer]], ''l'' was the length of the test conductor, ''a'' depended on the thermocouple junction temperature, and ''b'' was a constant of the entire setup.  From this, Ohm determined his law of proportionality and published his results.
[[File:Internal resistance model.svg|thumb|Internal resistance model]]
In modern notation we would write,

:&lt;math&gt; I = \frac {\mathcal E}{r+R},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal E&lt;/math&gt; is the open-circuit [[electromotive force|emf]] of the thermocouple, &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the [[internal resistance]] of the thermocouple and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the resistance of the test wire.  In terms of the length of the wire this becomes,

:&lt;math&gt; I = \frac {\mathcal E}{r+\mathcal R l},&lt;/math&gt;

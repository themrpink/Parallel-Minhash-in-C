A contrast to reductionism is [[holism]] or [[emergentism]]. Holism is the idea that, in the whole, items can have properties, known as ''emergent properties'', that are not explainable from the sum of their parts. The principle of holism was summarized concisely by [[Aristotle]] in the [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]: &quot;The whole is more than the sum of its parts&quot;.

===Fragmentalism===
An alternative term for ontological reductionism is ''fragmentalism'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kukla A|title=Antirealist Explanations of the Success of Science|journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=63|issue=1|pages=S298–S305|year=1996|doi=10.1086/289964|jstor=188539|s2cid=171074337}}&lt;/ref&gt; often used in a [[pejorative]] sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pope ML|title=Personal construction of formal knowledge|journal=Interchange|volume=13|issue=4|pages=3–14|year=1982|doi=10.1007/BF01191417|s2cid=198195182}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anti-realism|Anti-realists]] use the term ''fragmentalism'' in arguments that the world does not exist of separable [[Non-physical entity|entities]], instead consisting of wholes. For example, advocates of this idea claim that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The linear deterministic approach to nature and technology promoted a fragmented perception of reality, and a loss of the ability to foresee, to adequately evaluate, in all their complexity, global crises in ecology, civilization and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~isre/NEWSLETTER/vol6no2/global.htm|title=Page Not Found|website=Indiana University Bloomington}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
The term ''fragmentalism'' is usually applied to reductionist modes of thought, often with the related pejorative term ''[[scientism]]''. This usage is popular among some ecological activists: &lt;blockquote&gt;There is a need now to move away from [[scientism]] and the ideology of cause-and-effect determinism toward a radical [[empiricism]], such as [[William James]] proposed, as an [[epistemology]] of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioregionalanimism.blogspot.com/|title=Redirecting|website=bioregionalanimism.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; These perspectives are not new; during the early 20th century, [[William James]] noted that rationalist science emphasized what he called fragmentation and disconnection.&lt;ref name=Lumpkin/&gt;

Such opinions also motivate many criticisms of the scientific method: 
&lt;blockquote
&gt;The scientific method only acknowledges monophasic consciousness. The method is a specialized system that emphasizes studying small and distinctive parts in isolation, which results in fragmented knowledge.&lt;ref name=Lumpkin&gt;[http://www.bioregionalanimism.com/2006/12/is-polyphasic-consciousness-necessary.html Tara W. Lumpkin, ''Perceptual Diversity: Is Polyphasic Consciousness Necessary for Global Survival?'' December 28, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Alternatives==

The development of [[systems thinking]] has provided methods that seek to describe issues in a [[holism|holistic]] rather than a reductionist way, and many scientists use a [[Holism in science|holistic paradigm]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dossey, Larry]]. ''Reinventing Medicine: Beyond Mind-Body to a New Era of Healing.'' ({{ISBN|0-06-251622-1}}) HarperSanFrancisco. (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; When the terms are used in a scientific context, holism and reductionism refer primarily to what sorts of [[scientific model|models]] or theories offer valid explanations of the natural world; the scientific method of falsifying hypotheses, checking empirical data against theory, is largely unchanged, but the method guides which theories are considered.

In many cases (such as the [[kinetic theory of gases]]), given a good understanding of the components of the system, one can predict all the important properties of the system as a whole. In other systems, especially concerned with life and life's emergent properties ([[morphogenesis]], [[autopoiesis]], and [[metabolism]]), [[emergent properties]] of the system are said to be almost impossible to predict from knowledge of the parts of the system. [[Complex systems|Complexity theory]] studies systems and properties of the latter type.

[[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s metaphysics opposed reductionism. He refers to this as the &quot;fallacy of the misplaced concreteness&quot;. His scheme was to frame a rational, general understanding of phenomena, derived from our reality.

[[Ecologist]] [[Sven Erik Jorgensen]] makes both theoretical and practical arguments for a [[holistic]] method in certain topics of science, especially [[ecology]]. He argues that many systems are so complex that they can ever be described in complete detail. In analogy to the Heisenberg [[uncertainty principle]] in physics, he argues that many interesting ecological phenomena cannot be replicated in laboratory conditions, and so cannot be measured or observed without changing the system in some way. He also indicates the importance of inter-connectedness in biological systems. He believes that science can only progress by outlining questions that are unanswerable and by using models that do not try to explain everything in terms of smaller hierarchical levels of organization, but instead model them on the scale of the system itself, taking into account some (but not all) factors from levels higher and lower in the hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;S. E. Jørgensen, ''Integration of Ecosystem Theories: A Pattern'', 3rd ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, ({{ISBN|1-4020-0651-9}}) (2002) Chapters 1 &amp; 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[cognitive psychology]], [[George Kelly (psychologist)|George Kelly]] developed &quot;constructive alternativism&quot; as a form of [[personal construct psychology]] and an alternative to what he considered &quot;accumulative fragmentalism&quot;. For this theory, knowledge is seen as the construction of successful [[mental model]]s of the exterior world, rather than the accumulation of independent &quot;nuggets of truth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Pope ML, Watts M |name-list-style=amp |title=Constructivist Goggles: Implications for Process in Teaching and Learning Physics|journal=Eur.

''' ''Queen Elizabeth 2''''', often referred to simply as '''''QE2''''', is a retired British [[ocean liner]] converted into a floating hotel. Originally built for the [[Cunard Line]], ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' was operated by Cunard as both a transatlantic liner and a cruise ship from 1969 to 2008. She was then laid up until converted and since 18 April 2018 has been operating as a floating hotel in [[Dubai]].&lt;ref&gt;https://chrisframe.com.au/post/172795288690/qe2-reopens-asa-hotel-in-dubai-on-april-18-after-9 QE2 reopens after 9 1/2 years&lt;/ref&gt;

''Queen Elizabeth 2'' was designed for the transatlantic service from her home [[port of Southampton]], UK to New York, United States&lt;ref&gt;https://chrisframe.com.au/post/184591429680/50th-anniversary-of-qe2-today-2-may-2019-marks QE2 50th Anniversary by Chris Frame.&lt;/ref&gt; and was named after the earlier Cunard liner {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}}. She served as the flagship of the line from 1969 until succeeded by the ''[[Queen Mary 2]]'' in 2004. ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' was designed in Cunard's offices in Liverpool and Southampton and built in [[Clydebank]], Scotland. She was considered the last of the transatlantic ocean liners until ''Queen Mary 2'' entered service.

''Queen Elizabeth 2'' was also the last oil-fired passenger steamship to cross the Atlantic in scheduled liner service until she was refitted with a modern diesel powerplant in 1986–87. She undertook regular world cruises during almost 40 years of service, and later operated predominantly as a cruise ship, sailing out of [[Southampton]], England. ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' had no running mate and never ran a year-round weekly transatlantic express service to New York. She did, however, continue the Cunard tradition of regular scheduled transatlantic crossings every year of her service life.

''Queen Elizabeth 2'' was retired from active Cunard service on 27 November 2008. She had been acquired by the private equity arm of [[Dubai World]], which planned to begin conversion of the vessel to a 500-room floating hotel moored at the [[Palm Jumeirah]], Dubai.&lt;ref name=asa&gt;{{cite news|last=Fitch|first=Asa|title=QE II Ocean Liner Heads to Asia to Become Floating Hotel|url=http://www.zawya.com/story/QE_II_Ocean_Liner_heads_to_Asia_to_become_floating_hotel-ZW20130117000111/|newspaper=Zawya|date=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cunard Press Release&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cunard.com/AboutCunard/NewsReleases.asp?Cat=&amp;View=ViewArticle&amp;Mode=News&amp;ContentID=6656&amp;Active=News |publisher=Cunard.com|title=QE2 To Leave Cunard Fleet And Be Sold To Dubai World To Begin A New Life at the Palm|year=2007|accessdate=20 June 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706160214/http://www.cunard.com/AboutCunard/NewsReleases.asp?Cat%3D%26View%3DViewArticle%26Mode%3DNews%26ContentID%3D6656%26Active%3DNews &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=6 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2008 financial crisis]] intervened, however, and the ship was laid up at Dubai Drydocks and later [[Mina Rashid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CLYDE&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morris|first1=Hugh|title='Forlorn' QE2 is not coming home from Dubai, campaigners concede|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/12097316/Forlorn-QE2-is-not-coming-home-from-Dubai-campaigners-concede.html|accessdate=18 January 2016|publisher=Teleegraph Media Group|date=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent conversion plans were announced in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cruise liner Queen Elizabeth 2 to be converted into hotel |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/travel/cruise-liner-queen-elizabeth-2-to-be-converted-into-hotel/article1-902010.aspx |accessdate=29 August 2015 |publisher=HT Media Limited |date=3 July 2012 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904050816/http://www.hindustantimes.com/travel/cruise-liner-queen-elizabeth-2-to-be-converted-into-hotel/article1-902010.aspx |archivedate=4 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then again by the ''Oceanic Group'' in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New home for Queen Elizabeth 2|url=http://travel.cnn.com/new-home-queen-elizabeth-2-764401|accessdate=18 January 2016|publisher=CNN International|date=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but both plans stalled.

==Development==
[[File:QE2 in John Browns shipyard - geograph.org.uk - 111928.jpg|thumb|300px|Number 736 on the slipway, 1967.]]

By 1957, it was obvious that transatlantic travel was becoming dominated by air travel due to its speed and low cost relative to sea routes, with passenger numbers split 50:50 between sea and air transport.&lt;ref&gt;Glen. Page 296.&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in market share by air showed no signs of slowing down, especially once the [[Boeing 707]] entered service in 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;PayneP31&quot;&gt;Payne. Page 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, {{RMS|Queen Mary|3=2}} and ''Queen Elizabeth'' were becoming increasingly expensive to operate, and both internally and externally were relics of the pre-war years and needed to be retired by the mid-1960s.

Despite falling passenger revenues, Cunard did not want to give up its traditional role as a provider of a North Atlantic passenger service, and so decided to replace the existing ageing ''Queens'' with a new ocean liner designated &quot;Q3&quot;, as it would be the third Cunard Queen.&lt;ref name=&quot;chriscunard&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chriscunard.com/qe2/qe2-facts |title=QE2 Facts |year=2010 |website=Chris' Cunard Page |accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Q3 was projected to measure 75,000 [[gross register ton]]s, have berths for 2,270 passengers, and cost an estimated £30 million.&lt;ref name=PayneP31/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A new Cunard Liner | publisher = University of Glasgow | url = https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/archives/exhibitions/qe2/anewcunardliner/ | accessdate = 29 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work had proceeded as far as the preparation of submissions from six shipyards and applying for government financial assistance with the construction when misgivings among some executives and directors, coupled with a shareholder revolt, led to the benefits of the project being reappraised and ultimately cancelled on 19 October 1961.&lt;ref name=PayneP31/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TheQE2Story&quot;&gt;Cross.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cunard decided to continue with a replacement &quot;Queen&quot; but with an altered operating regime and more flexible design. Realising the decline of transatlantic trade, it was visualised that she would be a three-class (First, Cabin and Tourist) dual-purpose ship operating for eight months of the year on the transatlantic route, and during the winter months would operate as a [[cruise ship]] in warmer climates.&lt;ref name=PayneP31/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hist1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/~Tziper/history.htm |title=Queen Elizabeth 2: History |publisher=Members.tripod.com |accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared with the older Queens, which had two engine rooms and four propellers, the newly designated ''Q4'' would be smaller with one boiler room, one engine room and two propellers, which combined with automation would allow a smaller engineering complement.&lt;ref name=&quot;PayneP32&quot;&gt;Payne. Page 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite producing 110,000 shp, she was to have the same service speed of {{convert|28.5|kn|km/h}} as previous ''Queens'' which needed 160,000shp, while its fuel consumption would be halved to 520 tons,&lt;ref&gt;Glen. Page 303.&lt;/ref&gt; which was expected to save £1 million a year in fuel bills.&lt;ref name=PayneP32/&gt; The ''Q4'' would also be able to transit the [[Panama Canal]] and Suez Canal and her [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of 32 feet, which was seven feet less than her predecessors, would allow her to enter ports that the old ''Queens'' could not, and so compete with the new generation of cruise ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;chriscunard&quot;/&gt;

The interior and superstructure for the QE2 was designed by [[James Gardner (designer)|James Gardner]]. His design for the ocean liner was described by The Council of Industrial Design as that of a &quot;very big yacht&quot; and with a &quot;look [that was] sleek, modern and purposeful&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;QE2 [http://maritime.elettra.co.uk/qe2/design/ Engineering and Design]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristics===
At the time of retirement, the ship had a [[gross tonnage]] of 70,327 and was {{convert|963|ft|m|abbr=on}} long. ''QE2'' had a top speed of {{convert|32.5|knots|km/h}} with her original steam turbines; this was increased to {{convert|34|kn|km/h}} when the vessel was re-engined with a diesel-electric powerplant.&lt;ref name=&quot;chrisqe2hist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chriscunard.com/qe2/qe2-history/|title=QE2 History|website=Chris' Cunard Page|accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roblightbody.com/liners/qe-2/1987_Refit/index.htm |title=QE2's Major 1986–1987 re-engining refit |accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Chris Frame &amp; Rachelle Cross |title=The QE2 Story |isbn=978-0-7524-5094-0 |publisher=The History Press, Stroud |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hull===
The steel hull had a [[bulbous bow]] and was welded which avoided the weight penalty of over ten million rivets and overlapped plates compared with the previous ''Queens''.&lt;ref name=PayneP32/&gt;

===Superstructure===
Like both {{SS|Normandie|3=2}} and {{SS|France|1961|2}}, ''QE2'' had a flared stem and clean [[forecastle]].

What was controversial at the time, was that Cunard decided not to paint the funnel with the line's distinctive colour and pattern, something that had been done on all merchant vessels since the first Cunard ship, the {{RMS|Britannia}}, sailed in 1840. Instead, the funnel was painted white and black, with the Cunard orange-red appearing only on the inside of the wind scoop. This practice ended in 1983 when ''QE2'' returned from service in the [[Falklands War]], and the funnel has been repainted in Cunard traditional colours (orange and black), with black horizontal bands (known as &quot;hands&quot;) ever since.

The original pencil-like funnel was rebuilt in 1986 as a more robust one, using metal from the original, when the ship was converted from steam to [[Diesel engine|diesel]] power.

Large quantities of aluminium were used in the framing and cladding of ''QE2''{{'}}s superstructure. This decision was designed to save weight, reducing the draft of the ship and lowering the fuel consumption, but it also posed the possibility of corrosion problems that can occur with joining the dissimilar metals together, so a jointing compound was coated between the steel and aluminium surfaces to prevent this happening. The low melting point of aluminium caused concern when ''QE2'' was serving as a troop ship during the [[Falklands War]]: some feared that if the ship were struck by a missile her upper decks would collapse quickly due to fire, thereby causing greater casualties.

In 1972, the first penthouse suites were added in an aluminium structure on Signal Deck and Sports Deck (now &quot;Sun Deck&quot;), behind the ship's [[Bridge (ship)|bridge]], and in 1977 this structure was expanded to include more suites with balconies, making ''QE2'' one of the first ships to offer private terraces to passengers since ''Normandie'' in the 1930s.

''QE2''{{'}}s balcony accommodation was expanded for the final time during ''QE2''{{'}}s 1986/87 refurbishment in [[Bremerhaven]]. During this refit the ship was given a new wider funnel built using panels from the original. It retained the traditional Cunard colours.

''QE2''{{'}}s final structural changes included the reworking of the aft decks during the 1994 refit (following the removal of the magrodome), and the addition of an undercover area on Sun Deck during her 2005 refit, creating a space known as Funnel Bar.

===Interiors===
''Queen Elizabeth 2''{{'}}s interior configuration was laid out in a horizontal fashion, similar to ''France'', where the spaces dedicated to the two classes were spread horizontally on specific decks, in contrast to the vertical class divisions of older liners. Where ''QE2'' differed from ''France'' was that the first class deck (Quarter Deck) was below the deck dedicated to tourist class (Upper Deck). Originally there were to be main lounges serving three classes, layered one atop the other, but when Cunard decided to make the ship a two class vessel, only two main lounges were needed.

Instead of completely reconfiguring the Boat Deck, the ship's architects simply opened a well in the deck between what were to have been the second and third class lounges, creating a double height space known as the Double Room (now the Grand Lounge). This too was unconventional in that it designated a grander two-storey space for tourist class passengers, while first class passengers gathered in the standard height Queen's Room. The configuration for segregated Atlantic crossings gave first class passengers the theatre balcony on Boat Deck, while tourist class used the orchestra level on Upper Deck.

Over the span of her thirty-nine-year seagoing career, ''QE2'' received a number of interior refits and alterations.

The year she came into service, 1969, was also the year of the [[Apollo 11]] mission, when the [[Concorde]]'s prototype was unveiled, and the previous year [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' premiered. In keeping with those times, originally Cunard broke from the traditional interiors of their previous liners for ''QE2'', especially the [[Art Deco]] style of the previous ''Queens''. Instead modern materials like [[Laminate|plastic laminates]], aluminium and [[Perspex]] were used. The public rooms featured glass, stainless steel, dark carpeting and sea green leather.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Cunard Queens Queen Mary 2 Queen Victoria Queen Elizabeth 2 |last=Schwerdtner|first=Nils |publisher=Seaforth Publishing|year=2008|isbn=978-1-84832-010-9|location=47 Church Street|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furniture was modular and [[abstract art]] was used throughout public rooms and cabins.

[[Dennis Lennon]] was responsible for co-ordinating the interior design, and his team included [[Jon Bannenberg]] and [[Gaby Schreiber]], although Lennon's original designs only remained intact for three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;scotsman.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/art/sixties-splendour-revived-as-exhibition-celebrates-qe2-formica-fest-1-4687051|title=Sixties splendour revived as exhibition celebrates QE2 Formica fest|website=www.scotsman.com|accessdate=5 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Midships Lobby on Two Deck, where first class passengers boarded for transatlantic journeys and all passengers boarded for cruises, was a circular room with a sunken seating area in the centre with green leather clad banquettes, and surrounded by a chrome railing. As a kingpin to this was a flared, white, trumpet shaped, up lit column.

Another room, designed by [[Michael Inchbald]], where ''QE2''{{'}}s advanced interior design was demonstrated was the first class lounge, the Queen's Room on Quarter Deck. This space, in colours of white and tan, featured a lowered ceiling with large indirectly lit slots, which, despite reducing the ceiling height, created an impression of airy openness above to deal with the otherwise oppressive dimensions of the single storey room (c. 30m x 30m x 2.4m). In addition the structural columns were flared at the top to blend into the ceiling and to lose the visual indication of low ceiling height that straight columns would have given. (The Midships Lobby copied these features but without achieving the airiness.) Inchbald repeated the flaring of the columns in the bases of his tables and leather shell chairs. The indirect lighting from above could be switched from a cool hue for summer to a warm hue for winter.&lt;ref&gt;Explained to the author by his father, Michael Inchbald&lt;/ref&gt;

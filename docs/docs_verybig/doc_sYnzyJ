== Comparison to vector graphic editors ==
[[Vector graphics editor]]s are often contrasted with raster graphics editors, yet their capabilities complement each other. The technical difference between vector and raster editors stem from the difference between vector and raster images. [[Vector graphics]] are created mathematically, using [[Geometry|geometric]] [[formula]]s. Each element is created and manipulated numerically; essentially using [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] for the placement of key points, and then a mathematical algorithm to connect the dots and define the colors.

Raster images include [[Digital photography|digital photos]]. A raster image is made up of rows and columns of dots, called [[pixel]]s, and is generally more [[Photorealism|photo-realistic]]. This is the standard form for [[digital camera]]s; whether it be a [[Raw image format|.raw]] file or [[JPEG|.jpg]] file, the concept is the same. The image is represented pixel by pixel, like a microscopic jigsaw puzzle.

Vector editors tend to be better suited for [[graphic design]], [[page layout]], [[typography]], [[logo]]s, sharp-edged artistic [[illustration]]s, ''e.g.'', [[cartoon]]s, clip art, complex geometric patterns, [[technical illustration]]s, [[diagram]]ming and [[flowchart]]ing.

Advanced raster editors, like [[GIMP]] and [[Adobe Photoshop]], use vector methods (mathematics) for general layout and elements such as text, but are equipped to deal with raster images down to the pixel and often have special capabilities in doing so, such as brightness/contrast, and even adding &quot;lighting&quot; to a raster image or photograph.

== Common features ==
* [[selection (user interface)|Select]] a region for editing
* Draw lines with simulated brushes of different color, size, shape and pressure
* Fill a region with a single color, [[Image gradient|gradient of colors]], or a texture
* Select a color using different color models, ''e.g.'', [[RGB color model|RGB]], [[HSL and HSV|HSV]], or by using a [[Color tool|color dropper]]
* Edit and convert between various [[color model]]s.
* Add typed letters in various [[typeface|font]] styles
* Remove imperfections from photo images
* Composite editing using [[Layers (digital image editing)|layers]]
* Apply filters for effects including sharpening and blurring
* Convert between various [[image file formats]]

A '''vector graphics editor''' is a [[computer program]] that allows users to compose and edit [[vector graphics]] [[image]]s interactively on a computer and save them in one of many popular [[vector graphics format]]s, such as [[Encapsulated PostScript|EPS]], [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], [[Windows Metafile|WMF]], [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]], or [[Vector Markup Language|VML]].

==Vector editors versus bitmap editors==
Vector editors are often contrasted with [[bitmap graphics editor|bitmap editors]], and their capabilities complement each other. Vector editors are often better for [[page layout]], [[typography]], [[logo]]s, sharp-edged artistic [[illustration]]s (e.g. cartoons, clip art, complex geometric patterns), [[technical illustration]]s, [[diagram]]ming and [[flow chart|flowcharting]]. Bitmap editors are more suitable for retouching, photo processing, photorealistic illustrations, collage, and illustrations drawn by hand with a pen tablet. Recent versions of bitmap editors such as [[GIMP]] and [[Photoshop|Adobe Photoshop]] support vector tools (e.g. editable paths), and vector editors such as [[Adobe Fireworks]], [[Adobe FreeHand]], [[Adobe Illustrator]], [[Affinity Designer]], [[Animatron]], Artboard, Autodesk Graphic (formerly iDraw), [[CorelDRAW]], [[Sketch (application)|Sketch]], [[Inkscape]], [[SK1 (program)|sK1]] or [[Xara Photo &amp; Graphic Designer]] have adopted raster effects that were once limited to bitmap editors (e.g. blurring).

==Specialized features==
Some vector editors support [[animation]], while others (e.g. [[Adobe Flash]], [[Animatron]] or [[Synfig Studio]]) are specifically geared towards producing animated graphics. Generally, vector graphics are more suitable for animation, though there are raster-based animation tools as well. 

Vector editors are closely related to [[desktop publishing]] software such as [[Adobe InDesign]] or [[Scribus]], which also usually include some vector drawing tools (usually less powerful than those in standalone vector editors).{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Special vector editors are used for [[computer-assisted drafting]]. These are not suitable for artistic or decorative graphics, but are rich in tools and object libraries used to ensure precision and standards compliance of drawings and blueprints.

Finally, [[3D computer graphics]] software such as [[Maya (software)|Maya]], [[Blender (software)|Blender]] or [[3D Studio Max]] can also be thought of as an extension of the traditional 2D vector editors, as they share some common concepts and tools.

A '''herbivore''' is an [[animal]] anatomically and physiologically adapted to eating [[plant material]], for example [[foliage]] or [[marine algae]], for the main component of its diet. As a result of their plant diet, herbivorous animals typically have mouthparts adapted to rasping or grinding. [[Horse]]s and other herbivores have wide flat [[teeth]] that are adapted to grinding [[grass]], [[tree bark]], and other tough plant material.

A large percentage of [[herbivores]] have mutualistic [[gut flora]] that help them digest [[plant]] matter, which is more difficult to digest than animal prey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moran 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last= Moran |first= N.A. |year= 2006 |title= Symbiosis |journal=Current Biology |volume= 16 |issue= 20 |pages= 866–871 |doi= 10.1016/j.cub.2006.09.019 |pmid= 17055966}}&lt;/ref&gt; This flora is made up of [[cellulose]]-digesting [[protozoans]] or [[bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;symbiosis.&quot; The Columbia Encyclopedia. New York: Columbia University Press, 2008. Credo Reference. Web. 17 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Herbivore is the anglicized form of a modern Latin coinage, ''herbivora,'' cited in [[Charles Lyell]]'s 1830 ''[[Principles of Geology]].''&lt;ref name=OED&gt;J.A. Simpson and E.S.C. Weiner, Eds. (2000) &quot;The Oxford English Dictionary (volume VII) page 155.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Owen]] employed the anglicized term in an 1854 work on fossil teeth and skeletons.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;/&gt;   ''Herbivora'' is derived from the Latin ''herba'' meaning a small plant or herb,&lt;ref name=OLD1&gt;P.G.W. Glare, Ed. (1990) &quot;The Oxford Latin Dictionary&quot; page 791&lt;/ref&gt; and ''vora,'' from ''vorare,'' to eat or devour.&lt;ref name=OLD2&gt;P.G.W. Glare, Ed. (1990) &quot;The Oxford Latin Dictionary&quot; page 2103.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and related terms==
Herbivory is a form of [[heterotroph|consumption]] in which an [[organism]] principally [[eating|eats]] [[autotroph]]s&lt;ref name=MAAA&gt;Abraham, Martin A. A. Sustainability Science and Engineering, Volume 1. page 123. Publisher: Elsevier 2006. {{ISBN|978-0444517128}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[plant]]s, [[algae]] and photosynthesizing [[bacteria]].  More generally, organisms that feed on [[autotroph]]s in general are known as '''primary consumers'''.
Herbivory is usually limited to animals that eat plants. Fungi, bacteria, and protists that feed on living plants are usually termed [[phytopathology|plant pathogens]] (plant diseases), while fungi and [[microbes]] that feed on dead plants are described as [[saprotroph]]s. Flowering plants that obtain nutrition from other living plants are usually termed [[parasitic plant]]s. There is, however, no single exclusive and definitive ecological classification of consumption patterns; each textbook has its own variations on the theme.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Peter &amp; Packham, John.

==Evolution of herbivory{{anchor|evolution}}==
[[File:ViburnumFossil.jpg|thumb|right|A [[fossil]] ''Viburnum lesquereuxii'' leaf with evidence of insect herbivory; Dakota Sandstone ([[Cretaceous]]) of Ellsworth County, Kansas. Scale bar is 10 mm.]]
The understanding of herbivory in geological time comes from three sources: fossilized plants, which may preserve evidence of defence (such as spines), or herbivory-related damage; the observation of plant debris in fossilised [[coprolite|animal faeces]]; and the construction of herbivore mouthparts.&lt;ref name=Labandeira1998&gt;{{Cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although herbivory was long thought to be a [[Mesozoic]] phenomenon, fossils have shown that within less than 20&amp;nbsp;million years after the first land plants evolved, plants were being consumed by arthropods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Labandeira2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

During the next 75&amp;nbsp;million years{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}, plants evolved a range of more complex organs, such as roots and seeds. There is no evidence of any organism being fed upon until the middle-late [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]], {{Ma|late Mississippian}}. There was a gap of 50 to 100&amp;nbsp;million years between the time each organ evolved and the time organisms evolved to feed upon them; this may be due to the low levels of oxygen during this period, which may have suppressed evolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Labandeira2007&quot; /&gt; Further than their arthropod status, the identity of these early herbivores is uncertain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Labandeira2007&quot; /&gt;
Hole feeding and skeletonization are recorded in the early [[Permian]], with surface fluid feeding evolving by the end of that period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Labandeira1998&quot; /&gt;

Herbivory among four-limbed terrestrial vertebrates, the [[tetrapods]] developed in the [[Late Carboniferous]] (307 – 299&amp;nbsp;million years ago).&lt;ref name=&quot;SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/12/1079 | author= Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. &amp; Falcon-Lang, H.J. | year=2010 | title= Rainforest collapse triggered Pennsylvanian tetrapod diversification in Euramerica | journal=Geology | volume = 38 | pages = 1079–1082 | doi=10.1130/G31182.1 | issue=12 | bibcode=2010Geo....38.1079S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early tetrapods were large amphibious [[piscivores]]. While amphibians continued to feed on fish and insects, some reptiles began exploring two new food types, tetrapods (carnivory) and plants (herbivory). The entire [[dinosaur]] order [[ornithischia]] was composed with herbivores dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=&quot;SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse&quot; /&gt; Carnivory was a natural transition from insectivory for medium and large tetrapods, requiring minimal adaptation. In contrast, a complex set of adaptations was necessary for feeding on highly fibrous plant materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse&quot;/&gt;

[[Arthropod]]s evolved herbivory in four phases, changing their approach to it in response to changing plant communities.&lt;ref name=Labandeira2006&gt;{{Cite journal

Tetrapod herbivores made their first appearance in the fossil record of their jaws near the Permio-Carboniferous boundary, approximately 300&amp;nbsp;million years ago.  The earliest evidence of their herbivory has been attributed to [[Occlusion (dentistry)|dental occlusion]], the process in which teeth from the upper jaw come in contact with teeth in the lower jaw is present. The evolution of dental occlusion led to a drastic increase in plant food processing and provides evidence about feeding strategies based on tooth wear patterns. Examination of [[phylogenetic]] frameworks of tooth and jaw morphologes has revealed that dental occlusion developed independently in several lineages tetrapod herbivores. This suggests that evolution and spread occurred simultaneously within various lineages.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1002/jez.b.21115|pmid=16683226|title=Origin of dental occlusion in tetrapods: Signal for terrestrial vertebrate evolution?|journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology Part B: Molecular and Developmental Evolution|volume=306B|issue=3|pages=261–277|year=2006|last1=Reisz|first1=Robert R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food chain==
[[File:Leaf mining.jpg|thumb|[[Leaf miner]]s feed on leaf tissue between the epidermal layers, leaving visible trails]]
Herbivores form an important link in the food chain because they consume plants to digest the carbohydrates [[photosynthesis|photosynthetically]] produced by a plant. [[Carnivore]]s in turn consume herbivores for the same reason, while [[omnivore]]s can obtain their nutrients from either plants or animals.  Due to a herbivore's ability to survive solely on tough and fibrous plant matter, they are termed the primary consumers in the food cycle (chain).  Herbivory, carnivory, and omnivory can be regarded as special cases of [[consumer–resource interactions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Getz | first1 = W | date = February 2011 | title = Biomass transformation webs provide a unified approach to consumer-resource modelling | journal = Ecology Letters | volume =  14| issue = 2| pages =  113–124| doi = 10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01566.x | pmid=21199247 | pmc=3032891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feeding strategies==

Two herbivore feeding strategies are [[grazing]] (e.g. cows) and [[browsing (herbivory)|browsing]] (e.g. moose). For a terrestrial mammal to be called a grazer, at least 90% of the forage has to be grass, and for a browser at least 90% tree leaves and/or twigs. An intermediate feeding strategy is called &quot;mixed-feeding&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Janis (1990)&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | author=Janis, C. | year=1990 | title=Body Size in Mammalian Paleobiology: Estimation and Biological Implications | pages=255–299 | chapter=Chapter 13: Correlation of cranial and dental variables with body size in ungulates and macropodoids | editor1-last= Damuth, J. | editor2-last= MacFadden, B.J. | publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their daily need to take up energy from forage, herbivores of different body mass may be selective in choosing their food.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belovsky (1997)&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Belovsky, G.E. | date=November 1997 | title=Optimal foraging and community structure: The allometry of herbivore food selection and competition | journal=Evolutionary Ecology | volume=11 | issue=6 | pages=641–672 | doi= 10.1023/A:1018430201230| s2cid=23873922 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;Selective&quot; means that herbivores may choose their forage source depending on, e.g., season or food availability, but also that they may choose high quality (and consequently highly nutritious) forage before lower quality. The latter especially is determined by the body mass of the herbivore, with small herbivores selecting for high-quality forage, and with increasing body mass animals are less selective.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belovsky (1997)&quot; /&gt; Several theories attempt to explain and quantify the relationship between animals and their food, such as [[Kleiber's law]], Holling's disk equation and the marginal value theorem (see below).

Kleiber's law describes the relationship between an animal's size and its feeding strategy, saying that larger animals need to eat less food per unit weight than smaller animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Nugent | first1=G | last2=Challies | first2=CN | year=1988 | title=Diet and food preferences of white-tailed deer in north-eastern Stewart Island | journal=New Zealand Journal of Ecology | volume=11 | pages=61–73 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kleiber's law states that the metabolic rate (q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) of an animal is the mass of the animal (M) raised to the 3/4 power: q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=M&lt;sup&gt;3/4&lt;/sup&gt;
Therefore, the mass of the animal increases at a faster rate than the metabolic rate.&lt;ref&gt;Nugent and Challies, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbivores employ numerous types of feeding strategies. Many herbivores do not fall into one specific feeding strategy, but employ several strategies and eat a variety of plant parts.

[[Optimal foraging theory|Optimal Foraging Theory]] is a model for predicting animal behavior while looking for food or other resources, such as shelter or water.  This model assesses both individual movement, such as animal behavior while looking for food, and distribution within a habitat, such as dynamics at the population and community level.  For example, the model would be used to look at the browsing behavior of a deer while looking for food, as well as that deer's specific location and movement within the forested habitat and its interaction with other deer while in that habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kie|first1=John G.|title=Optimal Foraging &amp; Risk of Predation: Effects on Behavior &amp; Social Structure in Ungulates|date=1999|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|doi=10.2307/1383163|volume=80|issue=4|pages=1114–1129|jstor=1383163|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This model has been criticized as circular and untestable. Critics have pointed out that its proponents use examples that fit the theory, but do not use the model when it does not fit the reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Pierce | first1=G. J. | last2=Ollason | first2=J.

C. | date=16 May 1986 | title=Memory constraints and flower choice in Pieris rapae | journal=Science | volume=232 | issue=4752| pages=863–865 | doi=10.1126/science.232.4752.863 | pmid=17755969 | bibcode=1986Sci...232..863L | s2cid=20010229 | url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e922b3b68e4be76ebb94c01eea90e972852f67d1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Janetos | first1=A.

Holling's disk equation models the efficiency at which predators consume prey. The model predicts that as the number of prey increases, the amount of time predators spend handling prey also increases, and therefore the efficiency of the predator decreases.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, D. W., and J. R. Krebs. 1986. Foraging theory. Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2015}} In 1959, S. Holling proposed an equation to model the rate of return for an optimal diet: Rate (R )=Energy gained in foraging (Ef)/(time searching (Ts) + time handling (Th))&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;R=Ef/(Ts + Th) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Where s=cost of search per unit time f=rate of encounter with items, h=handling time, e=energy gained per encounter&lt;br /&gt;
In effect, this would indicate that a herbivore in a dense forest would spend more time handling (eating) the vegetation because there was so much vegetation around than a herbivore in a sparse forest, who could easily browse through the forest vegetation. According to the Holling's disk equation, a herbivore in the sparse forest would be more efficient at eating than the herbivore in the dense forest.

The [[marginal value theorem]] describes the balance between eating all the food in a patch for immediate energy, or moving to a new patch and leaving the plants in the first patch to regenerate for future use. The theory predicts that absent complicating factors, an animal should leave a resource patch when the rate of payoff (amount of food) falls below the average rate of payoff for the entire area.&lt;ref&gt;Charnov, E. L. 1976. Optimal foraging, the marginal value theorem. Theor. Pop. Biol.-9:129–136.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, locus should move to a new patch of food when the patch they are currently feeding on requires more energy to obtain food than an average patch. Within this theory, two subsequent parameters emerge, the Giving Up Density (GUD) and the Giving Up Time (GUT).  The Giving Up Density (GUD) quantifies the amount of food that remains in a patch when a forager moves to a new patch.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, J. S., B P. Kotler, and W A. Mitchell. 1997.

{{Main|Herbivore adaptations to plant defense}}

The myriad defenses displayed by plants means that their herbivores need a variety of skills to overcome these defenses and obtain food. These allow herbivores to increase their feeding and use of a host plant. Herbivores have three primary strategies for dealing with plant defenses: choice, herbivore modification, and plant modification.

Feeding choice involves which plants a herbivore chooses to consume. It has been suggested that many herbivores feed on a variety of plants to balance their nutrient uptake and to avoid consuming too much of any one type of defensive chemical. This involves a tradeoff however, between foraging on many plant species to avoid toxins or specializing on one type of plant that can be detoxified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dearing | first1 = M.D. | last2 = Mangione | first2 = A.M. | last3 = Karasov | first3 = W.H. | date = May 2000 | title = Diet breadth of mammalian herbivores: nutrient versus detoxification constraints | journal = Oecologia | volume = 123 | issue = 3| pages = 397–405 | doi = 10.1007/s004420051027 | pmid = 28308595 | bibcode = 2000Oecol.123..397D | s2cid = 914899 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbivore modification is when various adaptations to body or digestive systems of the herbivore allow them to overcome plant defenses. This might include detoxifying secondary metabolites,&lt;ref name=&quot;Karban, R 2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Karban | first1 = R. | last2 = Agrawal | first2 = A.A. | date = November 2002 | title = Herbivore Offense | journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 33 | pages = 641–664 | doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.33.010802.150443}}&lt;/ref&gt; sequestering toxins unaltered,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nishida | first1 = R. | date = January 2002 | title = Sequestration of Defensive Substances from Plants by Lepidoptera | journal = Annual Review of Entomology | volume = 47 | pages = 57–92 | pmid = 11729069 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ento.47.091201.145121 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or avoiding toxins, such as through the production of large amounts of saliva to reduce effectiveness of defenses. Herbivores may also utilize symbionts to evade plant defences. For example, some aphids use bacteria in their gut to provide essential amino acids lacking in their sap diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Douglas | first1 = A.E. | date = January 1998 | title = Nutritional Interactions in Insect–Microbial Symbioses: Aphids and Their Symbiotic Bacteria Buchnera | journal = Annual Review of Entomology | volume = 43 | pages = 17–37 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ento.43.1.17 | pmid = 15012383 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant modification occurs when herbivores manipulate their plant prey to increase feeding. For example, some caterpillars roll leaves to reduce the effectiveness of plant defenses activated by sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sagers | first1 = C.L. | year = 1992 | title = Manipulation of host plant quality: herbivores keep leaves in the dark | journal = Functional Ecology | volume = 6 | issue = 6| pages = 741–743 | doi=10.2307/2389971| jstor = 2389971 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plant defense===
{{Main|Plant defense against herbivory}}
{{see also|Plant tolerance to herbivory}}

A plant defense is a trait that increases plant fitness when faced with herbivory. This is measured relative to another plant that lacks the defensive trait. Plant defenses increase survival and/or reproduction (fitness) of plants under pressure of predation from herbivores.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Defense can be divided into two main categories, tolerance and resistance. Tolerance is the ability of a plant to withstand damage without a reduction in fitness.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Call|first1=Anson|last2=St Clair|first2=Samuel B|date=2018-10-01|editor-last=Ryan|editor-first=Michael|title=Timing and mode of simulated ungulate herbivory alter aspen defense strategies|url=https://academic.oup.com/treephys/article/38/10/1476/5048677|journal=Tree Physiology|language=en|volume=38|issue=10|pages=1476–1485|doi=10.1093/treephys/tpy071|pmid=29982736|issn=1758-4469|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can occur by diverting herbivory to non-essential plant parts, resource allocation, compensatory growth, or by rapid regrowth and recovery from herbivory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hawkes|first1=Christine V.|last2=Sullivan|first2=Jon J.|date=2001|title=THE IMPACT OF HERBIVORY ON PLANTS IN DIFFERENT RESOURCE CONDITIONS: A META-ANALYSIS|url=https://esajournals-onlinelibrary-wiley-com/journal=Ecology|volume=82|pages=2045–2058|via=Wiley}}{{Dead link|date=July 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Resistance refers to the ability of a plant to reduce the amount of damage it receives from herbivores.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; This can occur via avoidance in space or time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Milchunas | first1 = D.G. | last2 = Noy-Meir | first2 = I. | date = October 2002 | title = Grazing refuges, external avoidance of herbivory and plant diversity | journal = Oikos | volume = 99 | issue = 1| pages = 113–130 | doi=10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.990112.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; physical defenses, or chemical defenses. Defenses can either be constitutive, always present in the plant, or induced, produced or translocated by the plant following damage or stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Edwards | first1 = P.J. | last2 = Wratten | first2 = S.D. | date = March 1985 | title = Induced plant defences against insect grazing: fact or artefact? | journal = Oikos | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 70–74 | doi=10.2307/3544045| jstor = 3544045 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical, or mechanical, defenses are barriers or structures designed to deter herbivores or reduce intake rates, lowering overall herbivory. [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|Thorns]] such as those found on roses or acacia trees are one example, as are the spines on a cactus. Smaller hairs known as [[trichomes]] may cover leaves or stems and are especially effective against invertebrate herbivores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pillemer | first1 = E.A. | last2 = Tingey | first2 = W.M. | date = 6 August 1976 | title = Hooked Trichomes: A Physical Plant Barrier to a Major Agricultural Pest | journal = Science | volume = 193 | issue = 4252| pages = 482–484 | doi = 10.1126/science.193.4252.482 | pmid = 17841820 | bibcode = 1976Sci...193..482P | s2cid = 26751736 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some plants have [[waxes]] or [[resins]] that alter their texture, making them difficult to eat. Also the incorporation of silica into cell walls is analogous to that of the role of lignin in that it is a compression-resistant structural component of cell walls; so that plants with their cell walls impregnated with silica are thereby afforded a measure of protection against herbivory.&lt;ref&gt;PNAS Vol 91 Jan 1994 a Review by Emanuel Epstein&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemical defenses are [[secondary metabolites]] produced by the plant that deter herbivory. There are a wide variety of these in nature and a single plant can have hundreds of different chemical defenses. Chemical defenses can be divided into two main groups, carbon-based defenses and nitrogen-based defenses.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

#Carbon-based defenses include [[terpenes]] and [[polyphenol|phenolics]]. Terpenes are derived from 5-carbon isoprene units and comprise essential oils, carotenoids, resins, and latex. They can have several functions that disrupt herbivores such as inhibiting [[Adenosine triphosphate|adenosine triphosphate (ATP)]] formation, molting [[hormones]], or the nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Langenheim | first1 = J.H. | date = June 1994 | title = Higher plant terpenoids: a phytocentric overview of their ecological roles | journal = Journal of Chemical Ecology | volume = 20 | issue = 6| pages = 1223–1280 | doi = 10.1007/BF02059809 | pmid = 24242340 | s2cid = 25360410 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phenolics combine an aromatic carbon ring with a hydroxyl group. There are several different phenolics such as lignins, which are found in cell walls and are very indigestible except for specialized microorganisms; [[tannins]], which have a bitter taste and bind to proteins making them indigestible; and furanocumerins, which produce free radicals disrupting DNA, protein, and lipids, and can cause skin irritation.
#Nitrogen-based defenses are synthesized from amino acids and primarily come in the form of [[alkaloids]] and cyanogens. Alkaloids include commonly recognized substances such as [[caffeine]], [[nicotine]], and [[morphine]]. These compounds are often bitter and can inhibit DNA or RNA synthesis or block nervous system signal transmission. Cyanogens get their name from the [[cyanide]] stored within their tissues. This is released when the plant is damaged and inhibits cellular respiration and electron transport.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Software such as [[CuneiForm (software)|Cuneiform]] and [[Tesseract (software)|Tesseract]] use a two-pass approach to character recognition. The second pass is known as &quot;adaptive recognition&quot; and uses the letter shapes recognized with high confidence on the first pass to recognize better the remaining letters on the second pass. This is advantageous for unusual fonts or low-quality scans where the font is distorted (e.g. blurred or faded).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tesseract overview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Ray Smith|year=2007|title=An Overview of the Tesseract OCR Engine|url=http://tesseract-ocr.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/tesseracticdar2007.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928052954/http://tesseract-ocr.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/tesseracticdar2007.pdf|archive-date=September 28, 2010|access-date=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern OCR software like for example [[OCRopus]] or Tesseract uses [[neural network]]s which were trained to recognize whole lines of text instead of focusing on single characters.

A new technique known as iterative OCR automatically crops a document into sections based on page layout. OCR is performed on the sections individually using variable character confidence level thresholds to maximize page-level OCR accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=10,679,089&amp;OS=10,679,089&amp;RS=10,679,089&lt;/ref&gt;

The OCR result can be stored in the standardized [[ALTO (XML)|ALTO]] format, a dedicated XML schema maintained by the United States [[Library of Congress]]. Other common formats include [[hOCR]] and PAGE XML.

For a list of optical character recognition software see [[Comparison of optical character recognition software]].

===Post-processing===
OCR accuracy can be increased if the output is constrained by a [[lexicon]]{{spaced ndash}}a list of words that are allowed to occur in a document.&lt;ref name=&quot;nicomsoft&quot; /&gt; This might be, for example, all the words in the English language, or a more technical lexicon for a specific field. This technique can be problematic if the document contains words not in the lexicon, like [[proper noun]]s. Tesseract uses its dictionary to influence the character segmentation step, for improved accuracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tesseract overview&quot; /&gt;

The output stream may be a [[plain text]] stream or file of characters, but more sophisticated OCR systems can preserve the original layout of the page and produce, for example, an annotated [[PDF]] that includes both the original image of the page and a searchable textual representation.

&quot;Near-neighbor analysis&quot; can make use of [[co-occurrence]] frequencies to correct errors, by noting that certain words are often seen together.&lt;ref name=&quot;explain&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explainthatstuff.com/how-ocr-works.html |title=How does OCR document scanning work? |publisher=Explain that Stuff |date=2012-01-30 |access-date=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, &quot;Washington, D.C.&quot; is generally far more common in English than &quot;Washington DOC&quot;.

Knowledge of the grammar of the language being scanned can also help determine if a word is likely to be a verb or a noun, for example, allowing greater accuracy.

The [[Levenshtein distance|Levenshtein Distance]] algorithm has also been used in OCR post-processing to further optimize results from an OCR API.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to optimize results from the OCR API when extracting text from an image? - Haven OnDemand Developer Community|url=https://community.havenondemand.com/t5/Wiki/How-to-optimize-results-from-the-OCR-API-when-extracting-text/ta-p/1656|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322103356/https://community.havenondemand.com/t5/Wiki/How-to-optimize-results-from-the-OCR-API-when-extracting-text/ta-p/1656|archive-date=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Application-specific optimizations===
In recent years,{{when|date=March 2013}} the major OCR technology providers began to tweak OCR systems to deal more efficiently with specific types of input. Beyond an application-specific lexicon, better performance may be had by taking into account business rules, standard expression,{{clarify|date=March 2013}} or rich information contained in color images. This strategy is called &quot;Application-Oriented OCR&quot; or &quot;Customized OCR&quot;, and has been applied to OCR of [[license plate]]s, [[invoice]]s, [[screenshot]]s, [[ID card]]s, [[driver license]]s, and [[automobile manufacturing]].

[[The New York Times]] has adapted the OCR technology into a proprietary tool they entitle, ''Document Helper'', that enables their interactive news team to accelerate the processing of documents that need to be reviewed. They note that it enables them to process what amounts to as many as 5,400 pages per hour in preparation for reporters to review the contents.&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, Tiff, ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/reader-center/times-documents-reporters-cohen.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Freader-center&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=reader-center&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;pgtype=sectionfront How We Sped Through 900 Pages of Cohen Documents in Under 10 Minutes]'', Times Insider, [[The New York Times]], March 26, 2019&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workarounds==
There are several techniques for solving the problem of character recognition by means other than improved OCR algorithms.

===Forcing better input===
Special fonts like [[OCR-A font|OCR-A]], [[OCR-B]], or [[MICR]] fonts, with precisely specified sizing, spacing, and distinctive character shapes, allow a higher accuracy rate during transcription in bank check processing. Ironically, however, several prominent OCR engines were designed to capture text in popular fonts such as Arial or Times New Roman, and are incapable of capturing text in these fonts that are specialized and much different from popularly used fonts. As Google Tesseract can be trained to recognize new fonts, it can recognize OCR-A, OCR-B and MICR fonts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://trainyourtesseract.com/|title=Train Your Tesseract|date=September 20, 2018|website=Train Your Tesseract|access-date=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Comb fields&quot; are pre-printed boxes that encourage humans to write more legibly{{spaced ndash}}one glyph per box.&lt;ref name=&quot;explain&quot; /&gt; These are often printed in a [[Drop out ink|&quot;dropout color&quot;]] which can be easily removed by the OCR system.&lt;ref name=&quot;explain&quot; /&gt;

[[Palm OS]] used a special set of glyphs, known as &quot;[[Graffiti (Palm OS)|Graffiti]]&quot; which are similar to printed English characters but simplified or modified for easier recognition on the platform's computationally limited hardware. Users would need to learn how to write these special glyphs.

Zone-based OCR restricts the image to a specific part of a document. This is often referred to as &quot;Template OCR&quot;.

===Crowdsourcing===
[[Crowdsourcing]] humans to perform the character recognition can quickly process images like computer-driven OCR, but with higher accuracy for recognizing images than is obtained with computers. Practical systems include the [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] and [[reCAPTCHA]]. The [[National Library of Finland]] has developed an online interface for users to correct OCRed texts in the standardized ALTO format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.helsinki.fi/fennougrica/2014/02/21/ocr-text-editor/|title=What is the point of an online interactive OCR text editor? - Fenno-Ugrica|date=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowd sourcing has also been used not to perform character recognition directly but to invite software developers to develop image processing algorithms, for example, through the use of [[Tournament theory|rank-order tournaments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Riedl, C. |author2=Zanibbi, R. |author3=Hearst, M. A. |author4=Zhu, S. |author5=Menietti, M. |author6=Crusan, J. |author7=Metelsky, I. |author8=Lakhani, K. |title=Detecting Figures and Part Labels in Patents: Competition-Based Development of Image Processing Algorithms |journal=[[International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition]] |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=155 |date=20 February 2016 |doi=10.1007/s10032-016-0260-8|arxiv=1410.6751 |s2cid=11873638 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accuracy==
{{update|date=March 2013}}
Commissioned by the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] (DOE), the Information Science Research Institute (ISRI) had the mission to foster the improvement of automated technologies for understanding machine printed documents, and it conducted the most authoritative of the ''Annual Test of OCR Accuracy'' from 1992 to 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://code.google.com/p/isri-ocr-evaluation-tools/|title= Code and Data to evaluate OCR accuracy, originally from UNLV/ISRI|publisher=Google Code Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognition of [[Latin alphabet|Latin-script]], typewritten text is still not 100% accurate even where clear imaging is available. One study based on recognition of 19th- and early 20th-century newspaper pages concluded that character-by-character OCR accuracy for commercial OCR software varied from 81% to 99%;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; total accuracy can be achieved by human review or Data Dictionary Authentication. Other areas—including recognition of hand printing, [[cursive]] handwriting, and printed text in other scripts (especially those East Asian language characters which have many strokes for a single character)—are still the subject of active research. The [[MNIST database]] is commonly used for testing systems' ability to recognise handwritten digits.

Accuracy rates can be measured in several ways, and how they are measured can greatly affect the reported accuracy rate. For example, if word context (basically a lexicon of words) is not used to correct software finding non-existent words, a character error rate of 1% (99% accuracy) may result in an error rate of 5% (95% accuracy) or worse if the measurement is based on whether each whole word was recognized with no incorrect letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference  | last1=Suen  | first1=C.Y.  | last2= Plamondon    |  first2=R.  | last3= Tappert  | first3=A.  | last4=Thomassen  | first4=A.  | last5=Ward  | first5=J.R.  | last6=Yamamoto  | first6=K.  | title = Future Challenges in Handwriting and Computer Applications  | date =1987-05-29  | conference=3rd International Symposium on Handwriting and Computer Applications, Montreal, May 29, 1987  | url=http://users.erols.com/rwservices/pens/biblio88.html#Suen88  | access-date = 2008-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Using a large enough dataset is so important in a neural network based handwriting recognition solutions. On the other hand, producing natural datasets is so complicated and time-consuming. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Comparison of Synthesized and Natural Datasets in Neural Network Based Handwriting Solutions|author=Ayda Mohseni, Reza Azmi, Arvin Maleki, Kamran Layeghi |date=2019|publisher=ITCT|url=https://civilica.com/doc/924198/certificate/pdf/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the difficulties inherent in digitizing old text is the inability of OCR to differentiate between the &quot;[[long s]]&quot; and &quot;f&quot; characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Research and Advanced Technology for Digital Libraries|author=Sarantos Kapidakis, Cezary Mazurek, Marcin Werla|date=2015|page=257|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319245928|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kEyGCgAAQBAJ&amp;q=OCR+and+long+s|access-date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Web-based OCR systems for recognizing hand-printed text on the fly have become well known as commercial products in recent years{{when|date=March 2013}} (see [[tablet computer|Tablet PC history]]). Accuracy rates of 80% to 90% on neat, clean hand-printed characters can be achieved by [[pen computing]] software, but that accuracy rate still translates to dozens of errors per page, making the technology useful only in very limited applications.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Recognition of [[cursive|cursive text]] is an active area of research, with recognition rates even lower than that of [[hand-printed text]]. Higher rates of recognition of general cursive script will likely not be possible without the use of contextual or grammatical information. For example, recognizing entire words from a dictionary is easier than trying to parse individual characters from script. Reading the ''Amount'' line of a [[cheque]] (which is always a written-out number) is an example where using a smaller dictionary can increase recognition rates greatly. The shapes of individual cursive characters themselves simply do not contain enough information to accurately (greater than 98%) recognize all handwritten cursive script.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Most programs allow users to set &quot;confidence rates&quot;. This means that if the software does not achieve their desired level of accuracy, a user can be notified for manual review.

An error introduced by OCR scanning is sometimes termed a &quot;scanno&quot; (by analogy with the term [[Typographical error|&quot;typo&quot;]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.4155/ppa.15.21|title = Reinventing nonpatent literature for pharmaceutical patenting|year = 2015|last1 = Atkinson|first1 = Kristine H.|journal = Pharmaceutical Patent Analyst|volume = 4|issue = 5|pages = 371–375|pmid = 26389649}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hoopoes.com/jargon/entry/scanno.shtml Dead link&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unicode==
{{Main|Optical Character Recognition (Unicode block)}}

Characters to support OCR were added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in June 1993, with the release of version 1.1.

Some of these characters are mapped from fonts specific to [[MICR]], [[OCR-A]] or [[OCR-B]].

'''''Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six''''' is a [[tactical shooter]] [[video game]] and the first in the [[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six|''Rainbow Six'' series]]. It was developed and published by [[Red Storm Entertainment]] in 1998 for [[Microsoft Windows]]. It was ported to [[Mac OS]], [[Nintendo 64]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Dreamcast]], and [[Game Boy Color]].

In [[Single-player video game|single-player]], the player advances through a series of scenarios by playing missions in a campaign. Every mission initializes with a briefing stage, allowing the player to choose their equipment, coordinate their attacks, and develop the plot. Throughout each mission the player directly controls one team member, and can take control of any living operative. However, any casualties cannot be used in future missions unless the mission is reset. In [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]], the game pits two teams of players against each other in order to complete objectives depending on the game mode.

Rainbow Six received positive reviews from critics on PC, praised for its representation of audio and its immersive feeling, despite being a very difficult game. However on the console version it received lower ratings during release, one of the reasons being it contained significant flaws. In its first year of release it sold over 200,000 copies, accounting to $8.86 million in revenue.

An expansion pack, ''Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Mission Pack: Eagle Watch'', was released on January 31, 1999. On October 29, 2018, Sony revealed that the [[PAL]] release of the game would be one of 20 games pre-loaded on the [[PlayStation Classic]] (excluding Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong), which was released on December 3, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Announcing PlayStation Classic's Full Lineup of 20 Games |url=https://blog.us.playstation.com/2018/10/29/announcing-playstation-classics-full-lineup-of-20-games/ |website=PlayStation.Blog|date=29 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.destructoid.com/nine-games-on-the-playstation-classic-will-be-pal-versions-532726.phtml | title = Nine games on the PlayStation Classic will be PAL versions | first=  Peter | last =Glagowski| date = November 26, 2018 | accessdate = November 26, 2018 | work = [[Destructoid]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
''Rainbow Six'' is a [[tactical shooter]], which focuses more on stealth and tactics than on sheer firepower, exploring the lethality of a single bullet. To add to the realism, all in-game characters, [[Terrorism|terrorists]], [[hostage]]s and Rainbow operatives, can be wounded or dispatched in just fractions of a second with only one or two bullets. Tools such as thicker body armor, automatic rifles, and grenades have little value before the player grows accustomed to the gameplay.

Before each mission is a planning stage, during which the player is given a briefing, and then chooses the operatives to be involved in the mission, their weapons, equipment and uniform/camouflage. During this step, the player pre-establishes orders and waypoints. The planning stage determined elements such as the path the AI-controlled squads would follow during the mission, as well as where they will deploy devices such as [[flashbang]]s or [[door breaching]] charges.

Successful missions often last just minutes, but may require dozens of repetitions and planning changes (many more for beginners). During gameplay, the player controls only one team member directly, and can see stats for that member and all units on the [[heads-up display]]. Teams not under player control follow the orders given to them in the planning stage. The player can take control of any living operative at will, making them the leader.

The game forms a campaign that is a series of scenarios, with the plot being advanced in the mission briefing of each scenario. Any casualties that occur during a mission are permanent, so the deceased cannot be used in future missions. Consequently, many players replay missions that are technically successful merely to reduce the number of casualties.

Online multiplayer gaming was popular on the [[Mplayer.com]] and [[Zone.com]] services and for a time featured a thriving competitive clan based community with numerous independent ladder style leagues.

Unlike the other versions, the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version actually showed the gun being held in the player's hands.

==Plot==
Rainbow Six is set in 1996 to 2000. Rainbow is a newly created multinational counter-terrorism unit, composed of elite soldiers from [[NATO]] countries, the United States, Brazil, Spain, Austria, Sweden, Australia, Russia, and Israel, formed to address the growing problem of international terrorism. The organization's director is [[John Clark (Tom Clancy)|John Clark]], and the team leader is Ding Chavez. The term &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; refers to the director of the organization, John Clark.

Soon after its inauguration, Rainbow finds itself responding to a series of seemingly unrelated terrorist attacks by the Phoenix Group, a radical [[Eco-terrorism|eco-terrorist]] organization. Throughout its investigation, Rainbow is assisted and advised by John Brightling, chairman of the powerful [[biotechnology]] corporation Horizon Inc.

However, Rainbow eventually learns that the Phoenix Group is actually a front for Horizon Inc itself. Brightling's company is developing a highly contagious strain of the [[Ebola virus]] called &quot;Brahma&quot;, adapted from a strain killing Central African cattle (called &quot;Ebola Shiva&quot; in the novel) with the ability to kill every human being on the planet. In order to protect &quot;mother nature&quot;, John Brightling is planning to kill most of the human race, sparing only Brightling's chosen few, who will re-emerge and rebuild the planet into a scientific and environmentally-friendly utopia. To achieve this goal, he has used the scattered terrorist attacks to create fear of terrorism, which he then exploited in order to get a security contract for his own private security firm at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]]. Brightling's plan is for his &quot;security personnel&quot; to unleash the virus at the games, spreading it to all the countries of the world.

Rainbow succeeds in preventing the release of the virus at the Olympics, but Brightling and his collaborators retreat to their Horizon Ark facility in the Brazilian jungle, from which they had originally planned to weather out the global holocaust. Rainbow infiltrates the facility, killing all of Brightling's collaborators and capturing Brightling himself.

==Development==
[[Red Storm Entertainment]] (founded by author [[Tom Clancy]]) had originally planned to do a special operations game featuring first-person action, and a team of operators rescuing hostages and taking out terrorists. Their first concept was modeled after the [[FBI]] [[Hostage Rescue Team]]. Later they decided to make the concept more international, as HRT would only operate in the United States, and renamed it &quot;Black Ops&quot; and incorporated operators from all over the world. It was then they found that Clancy was writing a book about terrorism and a special team to combat it, so they rewrote some of the missions to fit within the book plot and Clancy shared his research with the game development team. The book was ''[[Rainbow Six (novel)|Rainbow Six]]'' so the game was renamed ''Rainbow Six''. However, by the time they finished the game, the book was not yet finished. Thus, the plot of the game does not completely match the plot of the book.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamasutra01&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20000121/upton_01.htm| date = January 21, 2000| accessdate = August 6, 2007| title = Postmortem: Redstorm's Rainbow Six| website = [[Gamasutra]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010804114957/http://gamasutra.com/features/20000121/upton_01.htm |archive-date=4 August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

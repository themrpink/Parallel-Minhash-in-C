==Simulation games==
{{Main|Simulation game}}
[[Strategy game]]s—both traditional and modern—may be viewed as simulations of abstracted decision-making for the purpose of training military and political leaders (see [[History of Go]] for an example of such a tradition, or [[Kriegsspiel (wargame)|Kriegsspiel]] for a more recent example).

Many other video games are simulators of some kind. Such games can simulate various aspects of reality, from [[business simulation game|business]], to [[Government simulation|government]], to [[Construction and management simulation games|construction]], to [[Vehicle simulation game|piloting vehicles]] (see above).

==Historical usage==
Historically, the word had negative connotations:

{{quote|text=…therefore a general custom of simulation (which is this last degree) is a vice, using either of a natural falseness or fearfulness…|sign=[[Francis Bacon]]|source=Of Simulation and Dissimulation, 1597}}

{{quote|text=…for Distinction Sake, a Deceiving by Words, is commonly called a Lye, and a Deceiving by Actions, Gestures, or Behavior, is called Simulation…|sign=[[Robert South]]|source=South, 1697, p.525}}

However, the connection between simulation and [[dissembling]] later faded out and is now only of linguistic interest.&lt;ref&gt;South, in the passage quoted, was speaking of the differences between a falsehood and an honestly mistaken statement; the difference being that in order for the statement to be a [[lie]] the [[truth]] must be known, and the opposite of the truth must have been knowingly uttered. And, from this, to the extent to which a '''lie''' involves deceptive ''words'', a '''simulation''' involves deceptive ''actions'', deceptive ''gestures'', or deceptive ''behavior''. Thus, it would seem, if a simulation is '''false''', then the truth must be known (in order for ''something other than the truth'' to be presented in its stead); and, for the '''simulation''' to ''simulate''. Because, otherwise, one would not know what to offer up in a simulation. Bacon's essay [http://www.authorama.com/essays-of-francis-bacon-7.html Of Simulation and Dissimulation] expresses somewhat similar views; it is also significant that [[Samuel Johnson]] thought so highly of South's definition, that he used it in the entry for simulation in his ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary of the English Language]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:René-Antoine Houasse - Minerve et Arachne (Versailles).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''[[Minerva]] and Arachne'', [[René-Antoine Houasse]], 1706]]

'''Arachne''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|r|æ|k|n|iː}}; from {{Lang-grc|ᾰ̓ρᾰ́χνη|translit=arákhnē|lit=spider}}, cognate with [[Latin]] {{Lang|la|araneus}})&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; is the protagonist of a tale in [[Roman mythology]] known primarily from the version told by the Roman poet [[Ovid]] (43&amp;nbsp;BCE–17&amp;nbsp;CE), which is the earliest extant source for the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theoi.com/Heroine/Arakhne.html|title=Theoi.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Book Six of his epic poem ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', Ovid recounts how the talented mortal Arachne, daughter of Idmon, challenged [[Athena]], goddess of wisdom and crafts, to a weaving contest. When Athena could find no flaws in the tapestry Arachne had woven for the contest, the goddess became enraged and beat the girl with her [[Shuttle (weaving)|shuttle]]. After Arachne hanged herself out of shame, she was transformed into a [[spider]]. The myth both provides an [[Origin myth|aetiology]] of spiders' web-spinning abilities and is a [[cautionary tale]] warning mortals not to place themselves on an equal level with the gods.

==Biography==

According to the myth as recounted by [[Ovid]], Arachne was a [[Lydians|Lydian]] maiden who was the daughter of [[Idmon]] of [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]], who was a famous dyer in purple.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''Metamorphoses'', 6. 8&lt;/ref&gt; She was credited to have invented linen cloth and nets while her son Closter introduced the use of spindle in the manufacture of wool. She was said to have been a native of [[Hypaepa|Hypæpæ]], near Colophon in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]]. ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137:book=7:chapter=57&amp;highlight=arabus#note10 Book 7.56.3];'' According to Justin, B. ii. c. 6, the Athenians introduced the use of wool among their countrymen; but it has been supposed that they learned it from the Egyptians. As we have sufficient evidence that linen was manufactured by the Egyptians at a very early period, we may presume that this account of Arachne either is fabulous, or that in some way or other she was instrumental in the introduction of linen into Greece.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==

[[File:Antonio Tempesta Arachne.jpg|thumb|''[[Athena]] and Arachne'' ([[Antonio Tempesta]])]]

In ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' the Roman poet [[Ovid]] writes that Arachne was a shepherd's daughter who began weaving at an early age. She became a great weaver, boasted that her skill was greater than Athena's, and refused to acknowledge that her skill came, at least in part, from the goddess. Athena took offense and set up a contest between them. Presenting herself as an old lady, she approached the boasting girl and warned: &quot;You can never compare to any of the gods. Plead for forgiveness and Athena might spare your soul.&quot;

&quot;Ha! I only speak the truth and if Athena thinks otherwise then let her come down and challenge me herself,&quot; Arachne replied. Athena removed her disguise and appeared in shimmering glory, clad in a sparkling white [[Chiton (costume)|chiton]]. The two began weaving straight away. Athena's weaving represented four separate contests between mortals and the gods in which the gods punished mortals for setting themselves as equals of the gods. Arachne's weaving depicted ways that the gods, particularly Zeus, had misled and abused mortals, tricking and seducing many women. When Athena saw that Arachne had not only insulted the gods but done so with a work far more beautiful than Athena's own, she was enraged. She ripped Arachne's work to shreds and hit her on the head three times. Terrified and ashamed, Arachne hanged herself. Then Athena said, &quot;Live on then, and yet hang, condemned one, but, lest you are careless in the future, this same condition is declared, in punishment, against your descendants, to the last generation!&quot; After saying this she sprinkled her with the juice of Hecate's herb, and immediately at the touch of this dark poison, Arachne's hair fell out. With it went her nose and ears, her head shrank to the smallest size, and her whole body became tiny. Her slender fingers stuck to her sides as legs, the rest is belly, from which she still spins a thread, and, as a spider, weaves her ancient web.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kline|first1=A.S|title=Ovid—the Metamophoses|url=http://tikaboo.com/library/Ovid-Metamorphosis.pdf|website=Tikaboo|publisher=A.S. kline|accessdate=12 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418003817/http://tikaboo.com/library/Ovid-Metamorphosis.pdf|archive-date=18 April 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The myth of Arachne can also be seen as an attempt to show relation between art and tyrannical power in Ovid's time. He wrote under the emperor Augustus and was exiled by him. At the time weaving was a common metaphor for poetry, therefore Arachne's artistry and Athena's censorship to it may offer a provocative allegory of the writer's role under an autocratic regime.&lt;ref&gt;Roman, L., &amp; Roman, M. (2010). {{Google books|tOgWfjNIxoMC|Encyclopedia of Greek and Roman mythology.|page=78}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

[[File:Velazquez-las hilanderas.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Las hilanderas (Velázquez)|''The Spinners, or, The Fable of Arachne'']] (1644–48) by [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]]]]

The [[Linnaean taxonomy|taxonomical]] class name ''[[Arachnida]]'' and the name for spiders in many [[romance languages]] are both derived from ''arachne''.

The metamorphosis of Arachne in Ovid's telling furnished material for an episode in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s mock-heroic ''[[Muiopotmos]]'', 257–352.&lt;ref&gt;Written c. 1590 and published in ''[[Complaints (Spenser)|Complaints]]'', 1591. Spenser's allusion to Arachne in ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', ii, xii.77, is also noted in Reed Smith, &quot;The Metamorphoses in ''Muiopotmos''&quot; ''Modern Language Notes'' '''28'''.3 (March 1913), pp. 82-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Spenser's adaptation, which &quot;rereads an Ovidian story in terms of the Elizabethan world&quot; is designed to provide a rationale for the hatred of Arachne's descendant Aragnoll for the butterfly-hero Clarion.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Brinkley, &quot;Spenser's ''Muiopotmos'' and the Politics of Metamorphosis&quot; ''[[ELH]]'' '''48'''.4 (Winter 1981, pp. 668-676) p 670. Brinkley makes a case for Spenser's episode as political allegory of Elizabeth's court.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dante Alighieri]] uses Arachne in [[Inferno_(Dante)#Seventh_Circle_(Violence)|Canto XVII]] of ''[[Inferno_(Dante)|Inferno]]'', the first part of ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'', to describe the horrible monster [[Geryon]]. &quot;His back and all his belly and both flanks were painted arabesques and curlicues: the Turks and Tartars never made a fabric with richer colors intricately woven, nor were such complex webs spun by Arachne.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dante Alighieri]], ''The Divine Comedy, Volume 1: Inferno''. Canto XVII, lines 15-18 (pp. 223-224). Translated by Mark Musa.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The tale of Arachne inspired one of [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]]' most factual paintings: ''[[Las hilanderas (Velázquez)|Las Hilanderas]]'' (&quot;The Spinners, or The fable of Arachne&quot;, in the [[Prado]]), in which the painter represents the two important moments of the myth. In the front, the contest of Arachne and the goddess (the young and the old weaver), in the back, an ''Abduction of Europa'' that is a copy of [[Titian]]'s version (or maybe of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]' copy of Titian). In front of it appears Minerva (Athena) at the moment she punishes Arachne. It transforms the myth into a reflection about creation and imitation, god and man, master and pupil (and therefore about the nature of art).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La légende d'Arachné|url=http://www.cineclubdecaen.com/peinture/peintres/velazquez/arachne.htm|accessdate=20 February 2013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that [[Jeremias Gotthelf]]'s nineteenth century novella, ''[[The Black Spider]]'', was heavily influenced by the Arachne story from Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses]]''.&lt;ref&gt;David Gallagher, &quot;The Transmission of Ovid's Arachne Metamorphosis in Jeremias Gotthelf's Die Schwarze Spinne&quot;'', Neophilologus ''(2008) 92: 699-711&lt;/ref&gt; In the novella, a woman is turned into a venomous spider having reneged on a deal with the devil.

==In popular culture==

[[File:Pendule met Arachne en Athene - Meissen porselein 001.JPG|thumb|Pendule with Arachne and Athena in [[Meissen porcelain]], attributed to Johann Gottlieb Kirchner and George Fritzsche (1727)]]
[[File:Arachne, Predator and Prey, oil on canvas, Judy Takacs, 2019.jpg|thumb|Arachne, Predator and Prey, oil on canvas, Judy Takacs, 2019]]

Arachne has had a considerable degree of influence on modern popular culture. She frequently appears in modern [[fantasy]] books, movies, and television series in the form of a monstrous spider. In ''[[Hercules: The Legendary Journeys]]'', she is pictured as a grotesque, half-woman, half-spider monster who nests on people to produce killer spiders. She is the central character in the 2011 novel ''The Spider Goddess'' by [[Tara Moss]]. In ''[[Class of the Titans]]'', Arachne is changed into a giant spider and makes a deal with Cronus to become human again. Cronus does not hold up the end of his bargain though and betrays her after getting her to trap the heroes for him. After being berated by Atlanta, Athena turns Arachne back into a human, and she is allowed to live at the Olympus High School, weaving for the gods.

In the 13th episode from season 6 of ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'', &quot;Unforgiven&quot;, the monster of the week is an Arachne, depicted as a humanoid monster with spider-like attributes and abilities, including the ability to weave strong webs and a venomous bite that can turn other humans into Arachnes. They can be killed only by decapitation and, before one appeared in [[Bristol, Rhode Island]], hadn't been seen in two thousand years. While soulless, [[Sam Winchester]] hunted one, but was unaware that it had turned its victims into Arachnes as well. One of the turned victims comes back for revenge and Sam is forced to kill him. 

Arachne is also featured in the ''[[Percy Jackson]]'' and ''[[Heroes of Olympus]]'' series. All of Athena's children, including Annabeth Chase, are arachnophobic because of Arachne's dispute with Athena. Arachne appears towards the end of ''[[The Mark of Athena]]'' as a large spider while still maintaining human features. She is defeated by Annabeth because of her pride and eventually they are both sent falling into [[Tartarus]], where Percy Jackson kills Arachne.

In the novel ''[[The Last Unicorn]]'' written by [[Peter S. Beagle]], a plain brown spider is bewitched into believing she is Arachne until the witch who enchanted her is killed. She is mentioned to be one of the creatures in Mommy Fortuna's Midnight Carnival. The book describes Arachne as &quot;the greatest weaver in the world—her fate's the proof of it. She had the bad luck to defeat the goddess Athena in a weaving contest. Athena was a sore loser, and Arachne is now a spider, creating only for Mommy Fortuna's Midnight Carnival, by special arrangement. Warp of snow and woof of flame, and never any two the same. Arachne.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Beagle, Peter Soyer. The Last Unicorn. 1968. New York, Penguin Group, 1991. [Page 21.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Marvel Comics]], Arachne is the name used by the second Spider-Woman ([[Julia Carpenter]], currently the new Madame Web) to distinguish herself from [[Jessica Drew]], the original Spider-Woman. In Volume{{nbsp}}3 of ''[[Monster Musume]]'', an Arachne (a human female from the hips upward and the body/legs of a spider) named Rachnera Arachnera is introduced; she goes on to become a member of the &quot;Monster Girl&quot; household in Volume 4. Arachne Gorgon is a powerful witch and one of the main antagonists of ''[[Soul Eater (manga)|Soul Eater]]''. She was responsible for crafting the first demon weapons, an act that [[Death (personification)|Death]] fiercely opposed, forcing her to bide her time and remain in hiding for 800 years. She returns to lead the risen Arachnaphobia, her personal army against Death.

The story of Arachne has also been adapted for many plays. She is the inspiration for a character featured in the [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] musical ''[[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark]]''. ''Arachne: Spider Girl!'' is a play for children based on the myth by [[Ursula Dubosarsky]], first published in the NSW [[School Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Arachne-Spider-Children-Metamorphoses-ebook/dp/B00AA7IGJU |title=Arachne: Spider Girl! (Plays for Children based on Ovid's Metamorphoses Book 8) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gustave Doré]]'s illustration of Arachne's punishment in [[Purgatory]] for Dante's ''[[Purgatorio]]'' has had a surprising number of pop culture appearances. It is one of the many recurring images used by the rock band, [[The Mars Volta]]; it has been used in the cover of their ''[[Live (The Mars Volta EP)|Live]]'' EP, as a backdrop for their live shows, and a favorite accessory for guitarist and composer [[Omar Rodríguez-López]] in the form of a belt buckle. [[Eminem]]'s 2013 music video for the song &quot;Rap God&quot; features imagery from Dante's ''Purgatorio'', including the illustration of Arachne. (This is most likely a metaphor for the rappers who try to compete with the self-proclaimed &quot;Rap God&quot;).

On Episode 245 of the Comedy Bang! Bang! Podcast, Comedian Neil Campbell references Arachne and Athena's rivalry during a freestyle rap battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/earwolf/clip-scott-aukerman-amy-1|title=Clip: Scott Aukerman, Amy Poehler, Paul F. Tompkins, Neil Campbell—Freestyle Rap Battle|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earwolf.com/episode/poehler-ice-caps/|title=Poehler Ice Caps, episode #245 of Comedy Bang Bang: The Podcast on Earwolf|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the popular MOBA game, ''[[Smite (video game)|Smite]]'', Arachne is listed as a playable deity in the Greek pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smitegame.com/gods/arachne/|title=Arachne|website=SMITE|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a short story &quot;More Spinned Against&quot; [[John Wyndham]] tells of how Arachne finds herself in the clutches of a spider-obsessed collector and of the deal she makes with the collector's wife Lydia.

The story of Arachne has been revisited in contemporary art by figurative artist, [[Judy Takács]]. Takács views the story and reimagines the characters through a feminist lens, with her triptych, Arachne, Predator and Prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chickswithballsjudytakacs.blogspot.com/2019/04/lovely-brown-recluse-spider-comes-out.html|title=Arachne: The Spider and the Queen Bee|last=Takács|first=Judy|date=April 29, 2019|website=chickswithballsjudytakacs.blogspot.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

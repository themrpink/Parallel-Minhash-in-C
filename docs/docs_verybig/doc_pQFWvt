[[Splenic infarction]] is a condition in which blood flow supply to the spleen is compromised&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapman Bhimji 2018 p.&quot;&gt;{{citation | last=Chapman | first=J | last2=Bhimji | first2=SS | title=Splenic Infarcts | chapter=article-29380 | publisher=StatPearls Publishing | location=Treasure Island (FL) | year=2018 | pmid=28613652 | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430902/ | access-date=2019-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, leading to partial or complete [[infarction]] (tissue death due to oxygen shortage) in the organ.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid3764696&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jaroch MT, Broughan TA, Hermann RE |title=The natural history of splenic infarction |journal=Surgery |volume=100 |issue=4 |pages=743–50 |date=October 1986 |pmid=3764696 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Splenic infarction occurs when the [[splenic artery]] or one of its branches are occluded, for example by a [[blood clot]]. Although it can occur [[asymptomatic]]ally, the typical symptom is severe [[abdominal pain|pain]] in the [[left upper quadrant (abdomen)|left upper quadrant of the abdomen]], sometimes radiating to the left shoulder. Fever and chills develop in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Nores |first1=M1 |last2=Phillips |first2=EH |last3=Morgenstern |first3=L |last4=Hiatt |first4=JR |date=February 1998 |title=The Clinical Spectrum of Splenic Infarction |journal=[[The American Surgeon]] |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=182–88 |pmid=9486895}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has to be differentiated from other causes of [[acute abdomen]].

===Hyaloserositis===
The spleen may be affected by [[hyaloserositis]], in which it is coated with [[fibrosis|fibrous]] [[hyaline]].&lt;ref name=omd&gt;[http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?hyaloserositis &quot;Hyaloserositis&quot;].

==Society and culture==
The word ''spleen'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|σπλήν}} (''splḗn''), and is the idiomatic equivalent of the heart in English, i.e., to be good-spleened ({{lang|grc|εὔσπλαγχνος}}, ''eúsplankhnos'') means to be good-hearted or compassionate.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson's Word Pictures of the New Testament, commentary on 1 Peter 3:8&lt;/ref&gt;

In English the word ''spleen'' was customary during the period of the 18th century. Authors like [[Richard Blackmore]] or [[George Cheyne (physician)|George Cheyne]] employed it to characterise the hypochondriacal and hysterical affections.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Cheyne (physician)|Cheyne, George]]: ''The English Malady; or, A Treatise of Nervous Diseases of All Kinds, as Spleen, Vapours, Lowness of Spirits, Hypochondriacal and Hysterical Distempers with the Author's Own Case at Large'', Dublin, 1733. Facsimile ed., ed. Eric T. Carlson, M.D., 1976, Scholars' Facsimiles &amp; Reprints, {{ISBN|978-0-8201-1281-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Blackmore|Blackmore, Richard]]: ''Treatise of the spleen and vapors''. London, 1725&lt;/ref&gt; William Shakespeare, in ''Julius Caesar'' uses the spleen to describe Cassius's irritable nature.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch
Under your testy humour? By the gods
You shall digest the venom of your spleen,
Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,
I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,
When you are waspish.&lt;ref&gt;''Julius Caesar'' by William Shakespeare Act 4:1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[French language|French]], &quot;splénétique&quot; refers to a state of pensive sadness or [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]]. It has been popularized by the poet [[Charles Baudelaire]] (1821–1867) but was already used before in particular to the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] literature (19th century). The French word for the organ is &quot;[[wikt:rate#French|rate]]&quot;.

The connection between ''spleen'' (the organ) and ''[[Melancholia|melancholy]]'' (the temperament) comes from the [[The four humours|humoral medicine]] of the [[ancient Greeks]]. One of the humours (body fluid) was the black [[Bile (biology)|bile]], secreted by the spleen organ and associated with melancholy. In eighteenth- and nineteenth-century England, women in bad humor were said to be afflicted by the spleen, or the vapours of the spleen. In modern English, &quot;to vent one's spleen&quot; means to vent one's [[anger]], e.g., by shouting, and can apply to both males and females. Similarly, the English term &quot;[[wikt:splenetic|splenetic]]&quot; describes a person in a foul mood.

In contrast, the [[Talmud]] (tractate Berachoth 61b) refers to the spleen as the organ of [[laughter]] while possibly suggesting a link with the [[Humourism|humoral]] view of the organ. Sanhedrin 21b and Avodah Zarah 44a (and Rashi ibid.) additionally describe how in the ancient world, some runners destroyed their spleens with drugs to increase their speed, and hollowed out the soles of their feet of flesh so as not to feel thorns and thistles as they ran.

The spleen also plays an important role in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] and is the Yin part of the Earth element paired with its Yang counterpart the Stomach.

In German &quot;einen Spleen haben&quot; means to be quirky or eccentric, to have a strange but usually not harmful habit. In German the meaning of &quot;spleen&quot; changed in the mid 19th century from &quot;being melancholy&quot; to &quot;being eccentric&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;https://wiki.yoga-vidya.de/Spleen&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other animals==
[[File:Horse_spleen_laparoscopic.jpg|thumb|[[Laparoscopic surgery|Laparoscopic]] view of a horse's spleen (the purple and grey mottled organ)]]
In [[cartilaginous fish|cartilaginous]] and [[ray-finned fish]], it consists primarily of red pulp and is normally somewhat elongated, as it lies inside the [[serosa]]l lining of the [[intestine]]. In many [[amphibian]]s, especially [[frog]]s, it has the more rounded form and there is often a greater quantity of white pulp.&lt;ref name=VB&gt;{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons,, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia |pages= 410–11|isbn= 978-0-03-910284-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A study published in 2009 using mice found that the [[red pulp]] of the spleen forms a reservoir that contains over half of the body's [[monocyte]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swirski&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=19644120|year=2009|last1=Swirski|first1=FK|last2=Nahrendorf|first2=M|last3=Etzrodt|first3=M|last4=Wildgruber|first4=M|last5=Cortez-Retamozo|first5=V|last6=Panizzi|first6=P|last7=Figueiredo|first7=JL|last8=Kohler|first8=RH|last9=Chudnovskiy|first9=A|last10=Waterman|first10=P|last11=Aikawa|first11=E|last12=Mempel|first12=TR|last13=Libby|first13=P|last14=Weissleder|first14=R|last15=Pittet|first15=MJ|title=Identification of splenic reservoir monocytes and their deployment to inflammatory sites|volume=325|issue=5940|pages=612–16|doi=10.1126/science.1175202|pmc=2803111|journal=Science|bibcode=2009Sci...325..612S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[reptile]]s, birds, and [[mammal]]s, white pulp is always relatively plentiful, and in birds and mammals the spleen is typically rounded, but it adjusts its shape somewhat to the arrangement of the surrounding organs.  In most vertebrates, the spleen continues to produce red blood cells throughout life; only in mammals this function is lost in middle-aged adults. Many mammals have tiny spleen-like structures known as [[haemal nodes]] throughout the body that are presumed to have the same function as the spleen.&lt;ref name=VB/&gt; The spleens of aquatic mammals differ in some ways from those of fully land-dwelling mammals; in general they are bluish in colour. In [[cetacean]]s and [[manatee]]s they tend to be quite small, but in deep diving [[pinniped]]s, they can be massive, due to their function of storing red blood cells.

The only vertebrates lacking a spleen are the [[lamprey]]s and [[hagfish]]es (the [[Cyclostomata]]). Even in these animals, there is a diffuse layer of haematopoeitic tissue within the gut wall, which has a similar structure to red pulp and is presumed [[homology (biology)|homologous]] with the spleen of higher vertebrates.&lt;ref name=VB/&gt;

In mice the spleen stores half the body's [[monocyte]]s so that upon injury, they can migrate to the injured tissue and transform into [[dendritic cell]]s and [[macrophage]]s to assist [[wound healing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Swirski&quot;/&gt;

'''''The Wheel of Time''''' is a series of [[high fantasy]] novels written by American author James Oliver Rigney Jr., under his [[pen name]] of [[Robert Jordan]]. Originally planned as a six-book series, ''The Wheel of Time'' spanned fourteen volumes, in addition to a prequel novel and two companion books. Jordan began writing the first volume, ''[[The Eye of the World]]'', in 1984, and it was published in January 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;peterahlstrom.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Ahlstrom |url=http://peterahlstrom.blogspot.com/2008/08/rolling-up-wheel-of-time-panel.html |title=Title Pending (仮): Rolling up the Wheel of Time panel |website=Peterahlstrom.blogspot.com |date=2008-08-31 |access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan [[Robert Jordan#Illness and death|died in 2007]] while working on what was planned to be the twelfth and final volume in the series. He prepared extensive notes so another author could complete the book according to his wishes. Fellow fantasy author and long-time ''Wheel of Time'' fan [[Brandon Sanderson]] was brought in to complete the final book, but during the writing process, it was decided that the book would be far too large to be published in one volume and would instead be published as three volumes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyhPRIokTSM |title=Brandon Sanderson Interview |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-11-11 |access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Gathering Storm (novel)|The Gathering Storm]]'' (2009), ''[[Towers of Midnight]]'' (2010), and ''[[A Memory of Light]]'' (2013).

The series draws on numerous elements of both [[European mythology|European]] and [[Asian mythology]], most notably the cyclical nature of time found in [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]], the metaphysical concepts of [[Balance (metaphysics)|balance]] and [[Dualistic cosmology|duality]], and a respect for nature found in [[Taoism]]. Additionally, its creation story has similarities to [[Christianity]]'s &quot;Creator&quot; ([[Let there be light|Light]]) and Shai'tan, &quot;The Dark One&quot; ([[Shaitan]] is an Arabic word that, in [[Islam]]ic contexts, is used as a name for the [[Devil]] or the [[Satan]]). It was also partly inspired by [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]'' ([[1869 in literature|1869]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview with Robert Jordan|work= SFX Magazine |number=16|date= September 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Wheel of Time'' is notable for its length, detailed [[Fictional universe|imaginary world]], well-developed [[Magic (fantasy)|magic]] system, and large [[:Category:The Wheel of Time characters|cast of characters]]. The eighth through fourteenth books each reached number&amp;nbsp;one on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]]. After its completion, the series was nominated for a [[Hugo Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Hugo Awards|url= http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2014-hugo-awards|date=2014|website=The Hugo Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jordan's French publisher, as of 2017, the series has sold over 80 million copies worldwide, and it is one of the best selling epic fantasy series since ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bragelonne.fr/auteurs/view/robert-jordan | title=Robert Jordan | work=Bragelonne | access-date=May 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its popularity has spawned an [[The Wheel of Time (video game)|eponymous video game]], [[The Wheel of Time Roleplaying Game|roleplaying game]], and [[A Soundtrack for the Wheel of Time|soundtrack album]]. On April 20, 2017, it was announced that [[Sony Pictures]] will adapt the series for television, and on October 2, 2018, Amazon ordered [[The Wheel of Time (TV series)|the series]] with Sony as a co-producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.tor.com/2018/10/02/wheel-of-time-picked-up-by-amazon-first-season-to-focus-on-moiraine/ |title='Wheel of Time Picked Up By Amazon, First Season to Focus On Moiraine|date=October 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/wheel-of-time-tv-series-sony-1202390897/|title='Wheel of Time' TV Series Lands at Sony|first=Joe|last=Otterson|date=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series is set in an unnamed world that, due to the cyclical nature of time as depicted in the series, is simultaneously the distant past and the distant future Earth. The series depicts fictional, ancient mythology that references [[Modern history|modern Earth history]], while events in the series prefigure real Earth myths. The series takes place about three thousand years after &quot;The Breaking of the World&quot;, a global cataclysm that ended the &quot;Age of Legends&quot;, a highly advanced era. Throughout most of the series, the world's technology and institutions are comparable to those of the [[Renaissance]], but with greater equality for women; some cultures are [[Matriarchy|matriarchal]]. Events later in the series prompt advances similar to the [[Industrial Revolution]].

The main setting for the series is the western region or continent of a larger landmass, both unnamed; however, the western region has been called &quot;The Westlands&quot; in licensed media, and by author Robert Jordan in interviews. The Westlands contains multiple kingdoms and city-states and is bounded on the east by a mountain range. To the east is a desert, the Aiel Waste, inhabited by the Aiel warrior people, who live in small settlements and whose society is organized into [[clan]]s and warrior societies. Further east is the large and predominantly insular nation of Shara, separated from the Waste by large mountain ranges and other impassable terrain. North of all three regions is the Great Blight, a hostile wilderness inhabited by evil beings. The Westlands are mostly temperate; it and the Aiel Waste are in the world's northern [[Middle latitudes|mid-latitudes]]. Shara extends slightly south of the [[equator]]. Across an ocean west of the Westlands is Seanchan, the name of a landmass and the empire that spans it. Seanchan is narrower from east to west than the other landmass, but extends most of the way between the ice caps from south to north. A large island in the northwest is separated from the Seanchan mainland by a channel. At the beginning of the series, Westlanders are unaware of Seanchan's existence. ''[[The World of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time]]'' depicts &quot;The Land of Madmen&quot;, a small continent in the southern hemisphere, far to the south of the Westlands and the Aiel Waste; it is never mentioned in the main series.

The series takes place at the end of the &quot;Third Age&quot; time period; the Age of Legends was preceded by the &quot;First Age&quot;, which is implied to be modern Earth. The Third Age in the Westlands was marked by two great upheavals. A thousand years after the Breaking, humanity was nearly overrun by creatures from the Blight in the &quot;Trolloc Wars&quot;. A thousand years after that, High King Artur Hawkwing unified the region, but his death resulted in the &quot;War of the Hundred Years&quot; instead of an orderly dynastic succession. The division of the Westlands into nations changed completely after each of the two events. The Old Tongue, a fictional language from the series, is depicted as a now-dead language, spoken only by scholars and certain nobles, though it still plays a role in the plot of the books.

&quot;The Pattern&quot; is a manifestation of both the physical world and people's destinies, while &quot;the Wheel&quot; represents the passage of time. These concepts apply to a series of [[Parallel universes in fiction|parallel worlds]], as well. Some characters observe or visit such other worlds; some of these worlds reflect different courses of history, and some are so divergent from the main reality that they are uninhabited. [[Physics]] sometimes operates differently in these worlds. The Seanchan imported &quot;exotic&quot; creatures from other worlds, later breeding and training them. Tel'aran'rhiod is the &quot;world of dreams&quot;, which connects to all of the other worlds. It can be visited in one's sleep, but events there are real; it is also possible to enter physically.

==Plot summary==
The prequel novel ''[[New Spring]]'' takes place during the Aiel War and depicts the discovery by certain Aes Sedai that the Dragon has been Reborn.

The series proper commences almost twenty years later in the Two Rivers, a near-forgotten district of the country of Andor. An Aes Sedai, [[Moiraine Damodred|Moiraine]], and her Warder [[Lan Mandragoran|Lan]], arrive in the village of Emond's Field, secretly aware that servants of the Dark One are searching for a young man living in the area. Moiraine is unable to determine which of three youths ([[Rand al'Thor]], [[Matrim Cauthon]], or [[Perrin Aybara]]) is the Dragon Reborn, and leads all three of them from the Two Rivers, along with their friend [[Egwene al'Vere]]. [[Nynaeve al'Meara]], the village wise-woman, later joins them. [[Itinerant poet|Gleeman]] [[Thom Merrilin]] also travels with the group. The first novel depicts their flight from various agents of the Shadow and their attempts to reach the Aes Sedai city of Tar Valon. Thereafter the protagonists are frequently split into different groups and pursue different missions toward the cause of the Dragon Reborn, sometimes thousands of miles apart. As they struggle to unite the various kingdoms against the Dark One's forces, their task is complicated by rulers of the nations who refuse to lose their autonomy; by the zealots styling themselves 'the Children of the Light', who do not believe in the prophecies; and by the [[Seanchan]], the descendants of a long-lost colony of [[Artur Hawkwing]]'s empire. The Aes Sedai also become divided on how to deal with the Dragon Reborn.

As the story expands, new characters representing different factions are introduced.

===Tarmon Gai'don===
Deriving its name from that of [[Armageddon]] in Christian eschatology, Tarmon Gai'don is the apocalyptic battle wherein the Dragon Reborn opposes Shai'tan, while their followers fight elsewhere. Events and portents that foreshadow the Last Battle take place in ''[[Knife of Dreams]]'' and ''[[The Gathering Storm (novel)|The Gathering Storm]]''. The Last Battle takes place in ''[[A Memory of Light]]'', in the form of a 202-page single chapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/bryan-maygers/a-memory-of-light-wheel-of-time_b_2429397.html | title=''A Memory of Light'' Review: Brandon Sanderson and Robert Jordan Give a Thrilling End to The Wheel of Time | work=The Huffington Post | date=March 10, 2013 | access-date=June 19, 2016 | author=Bryan Maygers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Wheel of Time has a total of 2782 distinct named characters, the books largely follow the same five Emonds Fielders as well as Elayne Trakand.

* '''Rand al'Thor''': Ta'veren, and the main protagonist of the story. The Dragon Reborn, known as the Car'a'carn or He Who Comes with the Dawn to the Aiel, known as the Coramoor to the Atha'an Miere, and known as Shadowkiller to the wolves. Born on the slopes of Dragonmount during the Aiel War. The reincarnated soul of Lews Therin Telamon.
* '''Matrim Cauthon''': Ta'veren, usually called &quot;Mat&quot;. He becomes the Marshal General of the Band of the Red Hand, marries the Seanchan empress Fortuona, and becomes one of the greatest generals the world has ever seen.
* '''Perrin Aybara''': Ta'veren, Perrin is a wolfbrother, and throughout the story becomes quite adept at manipulating Tel'aran'rhiod. Becomes the Lord of the Two Rivers/Steward of the Dragon in the Two Rivers.
* '''Egwene al'Vere''': From Emond Field herself, she was in training to become a Wisdom before venturing off with Moraine and Lan, where she discovered she could channel. She quickly raises through the ranks of the Aes Sedai, eventually becoming the Amyrlin Seat.
* '''Nynaeve al'Meara''': At the start of the story, she is the Wisdom of Emond's Field. After tracking down the rest of the Emond's Fielders after their departure, she soon finds out she can also channel, eventually becoming an Aes Sedai of the Yellow Ajah, and marries Lan Mandragoran, making her the Queen of Malkier. She is one of the most powerful female channelers alive.
* '''Elayne Trakand''': When she first appears, she is the heir to the Lion Throne of Andor, as the only daughter of Queen Morgase Trakand. Later becomes Queen of Andor following her mother's (falsely) presumed death. She is also a powerful channeler, becoming an Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah.

==Special powers==
In the series, many characters possess special powers. Within the fictional world, some of these abilities are widely known and understood, while others are undocumented; some are depicted as unique. Some characters take the reappearance of ancient abilities as a sign that the Last Battle is coming.

=== Channeling ===
&quot;Channeling&quot; is equivalent to [[Magic in fiction|magic as depicted in other fantasy-genre works]], but is never called &quot;magic&quot; in the series. Many characters are channelers, including series protagonists Rand al'Thor, Egwene al'Vere, Nynaeve al'Meara, Elayne Trakand, Moiraine Damodred, and Aviendha. Channelers can access a natural power source called the &quot;One Power&quot;, while Shai'tan can grant access to a separate power, the &quot;True Power&quot;. Very little is written in the series about the True Power, while the One Power is described extensively. The One Power consists of five elemental &quot;Powers&quot;: earth, water, air, fire, and spirit. Channelers often have particular strength in at least one Power, more commonly earth and fire in men and water and air in women; strength in spirit is equally rare between the sexes. A channeler creates a &quot;weave&quot; to achieve a specific effect by placing individual &quot;flows&quot; of the five Powers in a specific geometric configuration. The One Power has two aspects: &quot;saidin&quot;, used by men; and &quot;saidar&quot;, used by women. They differ sufficiently that no woman can teach a man to channel (and vice versa), and they can be used in drastically incompatible ways, though they sometimes achieve functionally identical effects. The True Power similarly differs from both. Male channelers are usually stronger than women, but women have advantages at &quot;linking&quot; with other channelers to harness more power; an individual's strength is quantified by the amount of the One Power he or she can channel at once. Some men and women are born with the &quot;spark&quot; to channel; these individuals will spontaneously begin to channel around puberty, but without formal training three of every four will suffer a fatal illness caused by channeling. Those who survive are called &quot;wilders&quot;, and often are unaware of the existence or nature of their powers. Channelers are constrained by any restriction they believe applies; wilders often possess a &quot;block&quot; that allows them to channel only under specific circumstances (such as experiencing a particular emotion). The majority of channelers lack the spark and will channel only if taught. Channelers can determine if a person of the same sex has the spark or is capable of learning to channel. A channeler with the spark who receives instruction is not at risk of death and is not normally considered a wilder. Channelers have a longer lifespan than non-channelers, in proportion to their strength; from early adulthood, channelers age more slowly than non-channelers, and the strongest channelers can live over 800 years. Shai'tan tainted saidin at the end of the Age of Legends, causing any male channeler to go insane (usually very destructively) and die; the Breaking was caused by the world's male channelers simultaneously going insane, while in the Third Age male channelers are neutralized in various ways as they come of age.

Channelers are treated in different ways by different cultures within the series. In the Westlands, channeling is viewed as synonymous with the Aes Sedai, an organization that survived from the Age of Legends and which views channeling as its proprietary domain; some Aes Sedai refer to channelers from other traditions as &quot;wilders&quot;, even if they are not self-taught. Aes Sedai are respected in most Westland nations, and they rule the city-state of Tar Valon. Aes Sedai are divided into seven &quot;ajahs&quot; named after colors and dedicated to different purposes; Red Ajah members seek out men who can channel and &quot;gentle&quot; them (remove their ability to channel). Also in the Westlands are the Kin, consisting of women who studied in Tar Valon but left without becoming Aes Sedai due to lack of desire or ability to complete their training. The Aes Sedai are aware of the Kin, who are very discreet, but are unaware that the Kin actually outnumber them. Among the Sea Folk, a seafaring Westlands culture, female channelers are expected to become &quot;Windfinders&quot;, ship's navigators; the profession is also open to non-channelers. Every generation, the Sea Folk send a few weak channelers to Tar Valon, successfully concealing the prevalence and strength of their channelers. Aiel channelers are expected to become Wise Ones, the culture's spiritual leaders, as are all Dreamwalkers; other worthy women may become Wise Ones without these special powers. Male Aiel channelers go into the Blight, expecting to die after killing some of Shai'tan's creatures; unbeknownst to the Aiel, Shai'tan actually captures and corrupts these men. Shara is secretly ruled by its female channelers, the Ayyad, through [[figurehead]] monarchs; the Ayyad keep their male offspring as breeding stock before killing them. The Seanchan believe channelers are subhuman and dangerous; they enslave female channelers with the spark, while those capable of acting as their handlers are, unbeknownst to themselves and other Seanchan, those who can learn to channel. Male channelers are executed.

Certain &quot;objects of the One Power&quot; exist. &quot;Angreal&quot; and &quot;sa'angreal&quot; increase the amount of the One Power a channeler can harness; sa'angreal may be [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] more powerful than angreal. &quot;Ter'angreal&quot; produce specific effects; some require channeling to function, while others operate continuously or via touch; some affect only channelers or affect them differently.

==== Talents ====
Robert Jordan uses the capitalized word &quot;Talent&quot; to refer to two distinct types of abilities sometimes possessed by channelers; the text also sometimes uses &quot;Talent&quot; to refer to abilities unrelated to the One Power and possessed by non-channelers.

One type of Talent is the aptitude for a particular weave or type of weave. Talents seen in the series include healing (Nynaeve al'Meara), manipulating weather (many Windfinders), creating &quot;gateways&quot; for instantaneous travel (Androl Genhald), and fabricating the indestructible substance &quot;cuendillar&quot; (Egwene al'Vere). Such a Talent may manifest as finer control over weaves, the ability to use a weave that would otherwise be beyond the channeler's strength, superior results when using a weave with all other factors equal, or some combination of these benefits. Some weaves, such as creating cuendillar, function only for a channeler with a corresponding Talent.

A Talent can also be some other ability possessed only by some channelers, but distinct from creating weaves of the One Power. Talents of this type include creating ter'angreal (Elayne Trakand), perceiving the purpose or function of a ter'angreal (Aviendha), analyzing an expended weave, &quot;unweaving&quot; a weave (Aviendha), predicting the weather (Nynaeve al'Meara), recognizing ta'veren on sight (Siuan Sanche and Logain Ablar), and &quot;Foretelling&quot; prophecy (Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan).  The latter three Talents have no obvious connection to the One Power, but are described as occurring only in channelers.

=== Other abilities ===
Some abilities depicted in the Wheel of Time are not related to the One Power or the ability to channel.

&quot;Dreaming&quot; (an Aes Sedai term) is the ability to have prophetic dreams, which are usually symbolic rather than literal. &quot;Dreamwalking&quot; (an Aiel term) is a set of abilities involving dreaming, including the ability to visit Tel'aran'rhiod and the dreams of others at will, and aptitude for manipulating Tel'aran'rhiod.  Egwene al'Vere is both a Dreamer and Dreamwalker, and the text never establishes whether or not these are two separate things. Dreamwalking is well known to the Aiel Wise ones, who use it for society-wide communication; Aiel Dreamwalkers include channelers Amys and Melaine and the non-channeler Bair, who become Egwene's teachers as the last Aes Sedai Dreamer died about five hundred years earlier.  No man is explicitly identified as a Dreamwalker in the series, but many of the male and female Forsaken, Shai'tan's top lieutenants, appear in Tel'aran'rhiod, and the male Forsaken Ishamael projects himself into other characters' dreams.

&quot;Ta'veren&quot; are individuals who are focal points of the Pattern for a time.  Rand al'Thor, Matrim Cauthon, and Perrin Aybara are all ta'veren during the events of the series. The Pattern causes events and the actions of others surrounding a ta'veren to conform to the ta'veren's [[destiny]], usually resulting in occurrences that are possible but unlikely.  Mat has exceptionally good luck at gambling and in battle, while Perrin easily earns the support of others.  Rand's presence often affects a large area around himself, causing such anomalies as one entire village pairing off in marriage in one day, another village erupting into violence over every disagreement its residents ever had, and a city's newborns being free of [[birth defect]]s during Rand's residency.

Rand al'Thor is also the &quot;Dragon Reborn,&quot; a prophesied savior.  Towards the end of the series, Rand is shown to have reality warping abilities related to the Dragon Reborn's connection to the Pattern; he kindles a pipe without channeling.

Perrin Aybara and Elyas Machera are &quot;Wolfbrothers,&quot; individuals who can communicate telepathically with wolves, which are depicted as [[Sapience|sapient]].  Wolfbrothers also have abilities similar to Dreaming and Dreamwalking, although they are not shown as capable of entering the dreams of others. The souls of wolves inhabit Tel'aran'rhiod, which they call the &quot;wolf dream,&quot; and a Wolfbrother who loses his identity as a man may become a wolf there.  Only male Wolfbrothers are depicted in the series.

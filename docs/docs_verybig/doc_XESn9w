Strong-willed and eccentric, Anna was known for her cruelty and vulgar sense of humor.{{sfn|Moss|1997|p=253}} She forced [[:ru:Голицын, Михаил Алексеевич|Prince Mikhail Alekseevich Golitsyn]] to become her court jester and had him married off to her unattractive [[Kalmyks|Kalmyk]] maid [[:ru:Буженинова, Авдотья Ивановна|Avdotya Buzheninova]].{{sfn|Moss|1997|p=253}} To celebrate the wedding, the Empress had an [[Ice palace#Anna Ivanovna.27s palace|ice palace]] measuring thirty-three feet high and eighty feet long built together with icy beds, steps, chairs, windows and even logs of ice in a fireplace of ice.{{sfn|Moss|1997|p=253}} Prince Golitsyn and his bride were placed in a cage atop an elephant and paraded through the streets to this structure, to spend their wedding night in the ice palace, despite it being an extremely cold night in the dead of winter. Empress Anna told the couple to make love and keep their bodies close if they did not wish to freeze to death.{{sfn|Moss|1997|p=253}} Eventually, the couple survived when the maid traded a pearl necklace for a sheepskin coat from  one of the guards. An enthusiastic hunter, Anna always kept a rifle by her window so she could blast away at birds at all hours of the day whenever she felt the urge to hunt.{{sfn|Moss|1997|p=254}}

==Empress of Russia==

[[File:Jesters of empress Anna Ioanovna by V.Jacobi (1872).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Court jesters of Empress Anna Ioanovna; painting by [[Valery Jacobi]]]]
Anna continued lavish architectural advances in St. Petersburg.{{sfn|Longworth|1972|p=111}}  She completed a waterway that began construction under Peter the Great and called for seafaring ships to accompany this new canal and continue naval expansion.{{sfn|Longworth|1972|p=112}} Anna's lover [[Ernst Johann von Biron]] was a Baltic German and due to his influence Baltic Germans were favored with government offices, leading to the resentment of the ethnic Russian nobility, though the American historian Walter Moss cautioned that the popular image of the ''Bironovschina''  as one of total Baltic German domination of Russia is exaggerated.{{sfn|Moss|1997|p=254}}

===Cadet Corps===
Anna founded the Cadet Corps in 1731, one year after coming to the throne. The Cadet Corps was a group of young boys starting at the age of eight being trained for the military.  There was a very rigorous training program and this also included all the schooling that was necessary for someone to be in an important position in the military. As time went on though, the program was later improved by other emperors and empresses, such as Catherine the Great. They began to include the arts and sciences into their schooling, rather than just the knowledge that is considered necessary for only a career in the military.

===Academy of Science===
Anna continued to fund the [[Russian Academy of Science]], started by Peter the Great.{{sfn|Lipski|1959|p=2}} This school was designed to further the sciences in Russia, in order to help the country reach the level of the Western countries of that period. Some of the subjects  taught were mathematics, astronomy, and botany. The Academy of Science was also responsible for many expeditions; a notable example was the Bering Sea Expedition.{{sfn|Lipski|1959|p=2}} While they were trying to find out if America and Asia had been at one point connected, they also studied Siberia and its people. These studies were used long after they returned from Siberia.{{sfn|Lipski|1959|p=2}}
There were also troubles for the scientists. Frequently the government and the church would meddle in their funding and their experiments, changing the data to match their respective points of view.{{sfn|Lipski|1959|p=2}}
This school of science was very small, never exceeding a population of twelve students in the university and barely over a hundred in the secondary school. Still, it was a huge step forward for education in Russia. Many of the teachers and professors were imported from Germany, bringing more of a Western feeling to what the students were learning. Some of the students taught by these German professors later became advisors or teachers to future leaders, such as Catherine the Great's tutor, Adodurov.{{sfn|Lipski|1959|p=4}}
During Anna's reign the Academy of Science began to include the Arts into their program, as there was no school for the arts yet, and Anna was a firm supporter of the arts. Theatre, architecture, engraving, and journalism were all added to the curriculum.{{sfn|Lipski|1959|p=5}}  During this time the foundations of what is now the world-famous Russian Ballet were laid down as well.{{sfn|Lipski|1956|p=488}}

===The Secret Office of Investigation===
Anna resurrected the Secret Office of Investigation, whose purpose was to punish those convicted of political crimes, although some cases were occasionally taken that were not of a political nature.{{sfn|Lipski|1956|p=481}} It has been rumored since Anna's reign that Biron was the power behind the Secret Office of Investigation when in fact it was run by the senator A. I. Ushakov. The punishments meted out for the convicted were often very painful and disgusting. For example, some people that had supposedly been plotting against the government had their noses slit in addition to being beaten with the [[knout]].{{sfn|Lipski|1956|p=482}} Russian authorities listed a total of around 20,000 Russians—including some of the highest native nobility—who fell victim to Biron and Anna's police.{{sfn|Baynes|1878}}

===Nobility===
Anna gave many privileges to those that were considered the nobility. In 1730 she ensured the repeal of Peter the Great's primogeniture law which made it illegal for estates to be divided among heirs. Starting in 1731 landlords were made responsible for their serfs' taxes, which had the effect of tightening their economic bondage further. In 1736, the age for a noble to begin his compulsory service to the state changed to 20 with a 25-year service time. Anna and her government also determined that if a family had more than one son, one could now stay behind to run the family estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Richard |last=Pipes |title=Under the Old Regime |page=133}}{{full citation needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Westernization===
Westernization continued after [[Peter the Great]]'s reign in areas of prominent Western culture such as the Academy of Science, cadet corps education, and imperial culture including theater and opera.{{sfn|Lipski|1950|pp=1–11}} Although not at the fast-paced speed of Westernization under her Uncle Peter's reign, it is evident that a culture of the expansion of knowledge continued during Anna's rule and affected mostly the nobility. It is argued that this success in Westernization is due to the efforts of the German court nobility;  the foreigners' impacts are viewed both positively and negatively.&lt;ref&gt;Lipski.{{full citation needed|date=December 2016|reason=Not enough to tie into one of the three long citation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anna's reign was different from that of other imperial Russian rulers in one respect: her court was almost entirely made up of foreigners, the majority of whom were German. Some observers have argued that historians isolate her rule from Russian history due to their long-term prejudice towards Germans, towards whom Anna seems to have been sympathetic.{{sfn|Curtiss|1974|p=72}}

There is a lot of mention of Germans throughout the reign of Anna. For example, she often gave them ruling positions in her cabinet and other important decision making positions. This was because she had very little trust in the Russians. It was because of this strong German influence in government that many Russians came to resent them.{{sfn|Lipski|1956|p=488}}

===Foreign affairs===
During Anna's reign Russia became involved in two major conflicts, the [[War of the Polish Succession]] (1733–1735) and another [[History of the Russo-Turkish wars|Turkish war]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=68}} In the former, Russia worked with [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] to support [[Augustus II of Poland|Augustus II]]'s son [[Augustus III of Poland|Augustus]] against the candidacy of [[Stanisław Leszczyński]] who was dependent on the [[Kingdom of France|French]] and amiable with [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] and [[The Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]. Russia's involvement with the conflict was quickly over, however, and the [[Russo-Turkish War (1735–1739)]] was much more important.{{sfn|Bain|1911|pp=68-69}}

In 1732 [[Nader Shah]] had forced Russia to return the lands in northern mainland [[Persia]] that had been taken during Peter the Great's [[Russo-Persian War (1722–23)|Russo-Persian War]]; the [[Treaty of Resht]] furthermore permitted an alliance against the Ottoman Empire,{{sfn|Tucker|2010|p=729}} the common enemy and, in any case, the provinces of [[Shirvan]], [[Ghilan]], and [[Mazanderan]] had been a net drain on the imperial treasury for the entirety of their occupation.{{sfn|Baynes|1878}} Three years later, in 1735, conforming to the [[Treaty of Ganja]], the remainder of the territories taken more than a decade earlier from Persia in the [[North Caucasus]] and [[South Caucasus]] were returned as well.

The war against the Turks took four and a half years, a hundred thousand men, and millions of rubles;{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=69}} its burdens caused great stress on the people of Russia,{{sfn|Lipski|1956|p=479}} and it only gained Russia the city of [[Azov]] and its environs.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=69}} Its effects, however, were greater than they first appeared. Osterman's policy of southern expansion prevailed over the 1711 [[Peace of Pruth]] signed by Peter the Great.{{sfn|Lipski|1956|p=487}} Münnich had given Russia its first campaign against Turkey that had not ended in crushing disaster and dissipated the illusion of Ottoman invincibility. He had further shown that Russia's [[grenadier]]s and [[hussar]]s could defeat twice their number of [[janissaries]] and [[spahi]]s. The Tatar hordes of the [[Khanate of Crimea|Crimea]] had been exterminated and Russia's signal and unexpected successes greatly increased its prestige within Europe.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=69}}{{efn|The English minister [[Claudius Rondeau]] noted soon after that &quot;This court begins to have a great deal to say in the affairs of Europe&quot;.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=69}}}}

The Russians also established a protectorate over the khan of the [[Kirghiz people|Kirghiz]], sending officers to assist his short-lived conquest of [[Khanate of Khiva|Khiva]].{{sfn|Baynes|1878}}

Two [[Qing Dynasty|Chinese]] embassies to Anna's court, first at Moscow in 1731, then at St Petersburg the following year, were the only ones China dispatched to Europe through the 18th century.{{sfn|Baynes|1878}}&lt;ref&gt;Hsu, Immunel C.-Y. (1999), ''The Rise of Modern China'', New York, Oxford University Press, p. 115-118&lt;/ref&gt; These embassies were unique also in that they represented the only occasions where officials of the Chinese Empire kowtowed before a foreign ruler.

==Relationship with Biron==
[[File:Ernst Johann von Biron 111.PNG|thumb|Ernst Johann Biron]]
After being widowed just weeks following her wedding, Anna never remarried. As empress of Russia, she enjoyed the power she held over all men and may have thought that marriage would undermine her power and position. Nevertheless, Anna's reign is often referred to as &quot;The Age of Biron&quot; (''{{lang|ru|Bironovschina}}''), after her German lover [[Ernst Johann Biron]].{{sfn|Curtiss|1974|p=72}} Historians aver that Biron not only had a strong influence on Anna's domestic and foreign policies, but also that at times he wielded power solely without reference to the Empress. Anna was attracted to Biron's personal charm and he proved to be a good companion to her, but his name became synonymous with cruelty and terror. In public perception these negative qualities became the hallmark of Anna's reign.{{sfn|Curtiss|1974|p=84}}

==Death and succession==
As her health declined Anna declared her grandnephew, [[Ivan VI of Russia|Ivan VI]], as her successor and appointed Biron as regent. This was an attempt to secure the line of her father, [[Ivan V]], and exclude the descendants of Peter the Great from inheriting the throne.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=69}} It was recorded that she had an ulcer on her kidneys,{{sfn|Curtiss|1974|p=286}} and she continued having attacks of gout; as her condition worsened, her health began to fail.

Anna died on October 17, 1740 at the age of 47 from a terrible kidney stone that made for a slow and painful death.{{sfn|Curtiss|1974|p=288}} The tsaritsa's final words focused on Biron.{{sfn|Curtiss|1974|p=289}} Ivan VI was only a two-month-old baby at the time, and his mother, [[Anna Leopoldovna]], was detested for her German counsellors and relations. As a consequence, shortly after Anna's death, [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth Petrovna]], legitimized daughter of Peter the Great, managed to gain the favor of the populace, locked Ivan VI in a dungeon, and exiled his mother. Anna was buried three months later on January 15, 1741, leaving behind uncertainty for the future of Russia.{{sfn|Curtiss|1974|pp=290-293}}

==Legacy==

In the West, Anna's reign was traditionally viewed as a continuation of the transition from the old Muscovy ways to the European court envisioned by Peter the Great.{{sfn|Baynes|1878}} Her government, on the whole, was prudent, beneficial and even glorious; but it was undoubtedly severe and became at last universally unpopular.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=69}} Within Russia Anna's reign is often referred to as a &quot;dark era&quot;.{{sfn|Lipski|1956|p=488}} The issue with her reign derives from her personality flaws. Even considering the need of Russian rulers to avoid displays of weakness, Anna's rule involved questionable actions towards her subjects. She was known to enjoy hunting animals from the palace windows and, on more than a few occasions, humiliated individuals with disabilities. There were continued issues with serfdom, peasant and lower class slavery, taxation, dishonesty, and rule through constant fear.{{sfn|Curtiss|1974|pp=231-232}} Her empire was described by Lefort, the Saxon minister, as being &quot;comparable to a storm-threatened ship, manned by a pilot and crew who are all drunk or asleep. . . with no considerable future&quot;.{{sfn|Curtiss|1974|p=232}} Anna's war with Turkey, economic issues, and conspiracy revolving around her accession all bring to light an ominous glow of the empress' reign.{{sfn|Curtiss|1974|pp=232-233}} She restored the court in St. Petersburg and brought Russia's political atmosphere back to where Peter the Great had intended,{{sfn|Curtiss|1974|p=120}} and its grandeur was almost unmatched in Europe or Asia;{{sfn|Curtiss|1974|p=63}} but such lavish court life was overshadowed by the thousands of men slaughtered in war.

'''Gunderic''' ({{lang-la|Gundericus}}; 379–428), [[King]] of Hasding [[Vandals]] (407-418), then King of [[Vandals]] and [[Alans]] (418–428), led the Hasding [[Vandals]], a [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] tribe originally residing near the [[Oder]] River, to take part in the [[barbarian]] invasions of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the fifth century.

== History ==
He was a son of King [[Godigisel]], the [[Hasdingi]]'s Vandal king when his people [[Crossing of the Rhine|breached the Rhine river]] frontier of the Empire on the last day of 406. During that year, the Vandals had become heavily involved in a war with the [[Franks]], who were already settled as allies of the Romans, and who attempted to keep the Vandals out. Godigisel was [[Battle of Mainz (406)|killed in the fighting]] and Gunderic succeeded him.

Gunderic and his people ultimately crossed the [[Pyrenees]] into the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in October 409. With the [[Hasdingi]] portion of the Vandals he established the Kingdom in the Roman province of [[Gallaecia]] (north-western Iberia). They were driven out by the Visigoths in 418 on the orders of the Romans (the Visigoths were recalled and settled as a reward for their service in Aquitania). In 418 [[Attaces]], the king of the [[Alans]], fell in battle against the [[Visigoths]], who at the time were allies of [[Roman Empire|Rome]], in Hispania, and most of the surviving Alans appealed to Gunderic who accepted their request and thus became King of the Vandals and Alans. In 420 Comes Hispaniarum attacked the Vandals who had gone to war with the Sueves in Galicia where the tribes were confined after the Visigoths had severely defeated them in 418. The imperial vicar (head of a diocese) defeated Maximus, son of earlier usurper Gerontius (409), in 420–421, but it resulted in the Vandals moving south to Baetica. Conflicts with the [[Suebi]] drove him into [[Baetica]] in the south of [[Hispania]], where he joined the surviving [[Silingi]] portion of the Vandals. The Vandals moved south to Baetica in 420–1. They defeated a Roman army, led by magister militum Castinus, outside the walls of Cordoba in 422. The Vandals attacked Mauretania Tingitana, the Balearics, and sacked Cartagena and Seville in 425. They did not remain in these cities. Gunderic re-took the city in 428. The Vandals departed Spain in 429 and for 10 years Roman Spain was intact except for Galicia under the control of the Sueves.&lt;ref&gt;Late Roman Spain and its Cities, Michael Kulikowsi, 2004, pp. 173-180 {{ISBN|0-8018-7978-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydatius writes that in 428 Gunderic laid &quot;hands on the church of that very city, by the will of God he was seized by a demon and died.&quot;  It is unclear how Gunderic died, however it is theorized that Hydatius' writing was in reference to Gunderic's attempt to convert a Catholic church to an Arian church.  The attempt was short-lived:  not long after his attempt to seize the church in Hispalis, he unexpectedly died.  After Gunderic died early in 428, the Vandals elected his half-brother [[Genseric]] as his successor, and Genseric left [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] to the Visigoths in favor of invading Roman [[Africa]].

In [[J. K. Rowling|J. K. Rowling's]] ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, a '''Muggle''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ʌ|g|əl}}) is a person who lacks any sort of magical ability and was not born in a magical family. Muggles can also be described as people who do not have any magical blood inside them. It differs from the term ''[[Fictional universe of Harry Potter#Blood purity|Squib]]'', which refers to a person with one or more magical parents yet without any magical power/ability, and from the term [[Fictional universe of Harry Potter#Muggle-born|Muggle-born]] (or the derogatory and offensive term ''[[mudblood]]'', which is used to imply the supposed impurity of Muggle blood), which refers to a person with magical abilities but with non-magical parents. The equivalent term used by the [[Fictional universe|in-universe]] magic community of America is '''No-Maj''', which is short for No Magic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/06/muggles-jk-rowling-fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them-american-term-non-wizards|title=What, no muggles?

== Usage in ''Harry Potter'' ==
The term ''Muggle'' is sometimes used in a [[pejorative]] manner in the novels. Since ''Muggle'' refers to a person who is a member of the non-[[Magic in Harry Potter|magical]] [[Fictional universe of Harry Potter|community]], Muggles are simply ordinary human beings without any magical abilities and almost always with no awareness of the existence of magic. Witches and wizards with non-magical parents are called ''Muggle-borns''. There have also been some children known to have been born to one magical and one non-magical parent. People of this mixed parentage are called ''[[Fictional universe of Harry Potter#Blood purity|half-bloods]]''; magical people with any Muggle ancestry on the one side or the other are half-bloods as well. The most prominent Muggle-born in the ''Harry Potter'' series is [[Hermione Granger]], who was born to Muggles of undisclosed names. Witches and wizards with all-magical heritage are called ''pure bloods''.

In the ''Harry Potter'' novels, Muggles are often portrayed as foolish, sometimes befuddled characters, who are completely oblivious to the wizarding world that exists in their midst. If, by unfortunate means, Muggles do happen to observe the working of magic, the [[Ministry of Magic]] sends Obliviators to cast Memory Charms upon them, causing them to forget the event.

Some Muggles, however, are aware of the wizarding world. These include Muggle parents of magical children, such as [[Hermione Granger]]'s parents, the [[Supporting Harry Potter characters#The Muggle Prime Minister of Britain|Muggle Prime Minister]] (and predecessors), the [[Dursley family]] (Harry Potter's unsupportive non-magical and only living relatives), and the non-magical spouses of some witches and wizards.

Rowling has created the word &quot;Muggle&quot; from &quot;mug&quot;, an English term for someone who is easily fooled. She added the &quot;-gle&quot; to make it sound less demeaning and more &quot;cuddly&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2004/0304-wbd.htm|title=2004: Accio Quote!, the largest archive of J.K.

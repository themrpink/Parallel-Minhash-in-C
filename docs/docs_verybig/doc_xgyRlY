A rod can bend in different curves. Traditionally the bending curve is mainly determined by its tapering. In simplified terms, a fast taper will bend a lot more in the tip area and not much in the butt part, and a slow taper will tend to bend too much at the butt and delivers a weak rod. A progressive tapering which loads smooth from top to butt, adding in power the deeper the rod is bent. In practice, the tapers of quality rods often are curved or in steps to achieve the right action and bending curve for the type of fishing a rod is built. In today's practice, different fibres with different properties can be used in a single rod. In this practice, there is no straight relationship anymore between the actual tapering and the bending curve.

The bending curve isn't easily described by terms. However, some rod &amp; blank manufacturers try to simplify things towards their customers by describing the bending curve by associating them with their action. The term ''fast action'' is used for rods where only the tip is bending, and ''slow action'' for rods bending from tip to butt. In practice, this is misleading, as top-quality rods are very often fast-action rods, bending from tip to butt. While the so-called 'fast-action' rods are stiff rods (with absence of any action) which end in a soft or slow tip section. The construction of a progressive bending, fast action rod is more difficult and more expensive to achieve. Common terms to describe the bending curve or properties which influence the bending curve are: progressive taper/loading/curve/bending/..., fast taper, heavy progressive (notes a bending curve close to progressive, tending to become fast-tapered), tip action (also referred to as 'umbrella'-action), broom-action (which refers to the previously mentioned stiff 'fast action'-rods with soft tip). A parabolic action is often used to note a progressive bending curve, in fact this term comes from a series of splitcane fly rods built by Pezon &amp; Michel in France since the late 1930s, which had a progressive bending curve. Sometimes the term parabolic is more specific used to note the specific type of progressive bending curve as was found in the Parabolic series.

A common way today to describe a rod's bending properties is the Common Cents System, which is &quot;a system of objective and relative measurement for quantifying rod power, action and even this elusive thing ... fishermen like to call feel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hanneman|first1=William|title=The Common Cents System|url=http://common-cents.info/|website=common-cents.info|publisher=RodMaker Magazine|accessdate=9 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180209232330/http://common-cents.info/|archivedate=9 February 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bending curve determines the way a rod builds up and releases its power. This influences not only the casting and the fish-fighting properties, but also the sensitivity to strikes when fishing lures, the ability to set a hook (which is also related to the mass of the rod), the control over the lure or bait, the way the rod should be handled and how the power is distributed over the rod. On a full progressive rod, the power is distributed most evenly over the whole rod.

===Line weight===
A rod is usually also classified by the optimal weight of [[fishing line]] or in the case of fly rods, fly line the rod should handle. Fishing line weight is described in pounds of tensile force before the line parts. Line weight for a rod is expressed as a range that the rod is designed to support. Fly rod weights are typically expressed as a number from 1 to 12, written as &quot;N&quot;wt (e.g. 6wt) and each weight represents a standard weight in grains for the first {{convert|30|ft|m|0}} of the fly line established by the American Fishing Tackle Manufacturing Association. For example, the first {{convert|30|in|cm|abbr=on|round=5}} of a 6wt fly line should weigh between {{convert|152|-|168|gr|g|0|abbr=off}}, with the optimal weight being {{convert|160|gr|g|abbr=off}}. In casting and spinning rods, designations such as &quot;8-15 lb line&quot; are typical.

===Lure weight===
A rod may also be described by the weight of lure or hook that the rod is designed to support. Lure weight is usually expressed in ounces or grams.

===Number of pieces===
Rods that are one piece from butt to tip are considered to have the most natural &quot;feel&quot;, and are preferred by many, though the difficulty in transporting them safely becomes an increasing problem with increasing rod length. Two-piece rods, joined by a ferrule, are very common, and if well engineered (especially with tubular glass or carbon fibre rods), sacrifice very little in the way of natural feel. Some fishermen do feel a difference in sensitivity with two-piece rods, but most do not.

Some rods are joined through a metal bus. These add mass to the rod which helps in setting the hook and help activating the rod from tip to butt when casting, resulting in a better casting experience. Some anglers experience this kind of fitting as superior to a one piece rod. They are found on specialised hand-built rods. Apart from adding the correct mass, depending on the kind of rod, this fitting also is the strongest known fitting, but also the most expensive one. For that reason they are almost never to be found on commercial fishing rods.

==Types==
[[Image:fishingpole.jpg|left|frame|A fibreglass spinning rod and reel circa 1997]]
Fishing rods can be constructed out of a vast number of materials. Generally they are made with either fiberglass, graphite, or a new generation composite, also known as carbon fibre. Many times carbon fibre and graphite are used together in the rod making process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Povermo&quot; /&gt;

===Carbon fibre rods===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}
A carbon fibre rod is not necessarily better than a glass fibre rod; the two fibres have different properties, with their own tradeoffs. Carbon fibre is less flexible (stiffer) than glass fibre and more brittle and prone to breakage when misused,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://outdoorsurvivors.com/how-to-begin-fly-fishing-the-perfect-guide-free/|title=How To Begin Fly Fishing: The Perfect Guide (FREE)|website=Outdoor Survivors|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310073155/http://outdoorsurvivors.com/how-to-begin-fly-fishing-the-perfect-guide-free/|archivedate=10 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; while carbon fibre allows for longer and faster rods. Carbon fibre also allows for a smaller diameter rod that is more sensitive than a glass fibre rod.&lt;ref name=&quot;Povermo&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Povermo|first1=George|title=Rod Savvy|magazine=Salt Water Sportsman|date=March 2016|volume=77|issue=3|pages=31â€“34}}&lt;/ref&gt; A carbon fibre rod is also much lighter than a glass fibre rod allowing for longer days of fishing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wessman&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wessman|first1=Bo|title=Complete guide to fishing : building your own rod|date=2004|publisher=Published in the United States by Mason Crest Publishers|location=Broomall, PA|isbn=9781590845509|page=8}}&lt;!--|accessdate=19 February 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Each has its purpose in the fishing industry and both improve an anglers chances of being successful when the blanks are used for the right purposes.

===Fly rods===
{{Main|Fly fishing}}

Fly rods, thin, flexible fishing rods designed to cast an [[artificial fly]], usually consisting of a hook tied with fur, feathers, foam, or other lightweight material. More modern flies are also tied with synthetic materials. Originally made of yew, green heart, and later split bamboo (Tonkin cane), most modern fly rods are constructed from man-made composite materials, including fibreglass, carbon/[[graphite]], or graphite/[[boron]] composites. Split bamboo rods are generally considered the most beautiful, the most &quot;classic&quot;, and are also generally the most fragile of the styles, and they require a great deal of care to last well. Instead of a weighted lure, a fly rod uses the weight of the fly line for casting, and lightweight rods are capable of casting the very smallest and lightest fly. Typically, a monofilament segment called a &quot;leader&quot; is tied to the fly line on one end and the fly on the other.

Each rod is sized to the fish being sought, the wind and water conditions and also to a particular weight of line: larger and heavier line sizes will cast heavier, larger flies. Fly rods come in a wide variety of line sizes, from size #000 to #0 rods for the smallest freshwater trout and pan fish up to and including #16 rods&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul, ''Sage Manufacturing News Release of 16-weight 1680-4 Xi2 Saltwater Fly Rod'', 24 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt; for large saltwater game fish. Fly rods tend to have a single, large-diameter line guide (called a stripping guide), with a number of smaller looped guides (aka ''snake'' guides) spaced along the rod to help control the movement of the relatively thick [[fly line]]. To prevent interference with casting movements, most fly rods usually have little or no butt section ([[Handle (grip)|handle]]) extending below the [[fishing reel]]. However, the [[Spey casting|''Spey'' rod]], a fly rod with an elongated rear handle, is often used for fishing either large rivers for [[salmon]] and [[Rainbow trout|Steelhead]] or saltwater [[surf fishing|surf casting]], using a two-handed casting technique.

Fly rods are, in modern manufacture, almost always built out of carbon graphite. The graphite fibres are laid down in increasingly sophisticated patterns to keep the rod from flattening when stressed (usually referred to as hoop strength). The rod tapers from one end to the other and the degree of taper determines how much of the rod flexes when stressed. The larger amount of the rod that flexes the 'slower' the rod. Slower rods are easier to cast, create lighter presentations but create a wider loop on the forward cast that reduces casting distance and is subject to the effects of wind.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.leaffin.com/fly-rod-action/ Fly Rods : Guide to Fly Rod Flex &amp; Action] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180130164639/https://www.leaffin.com/fly-rod-action/ |date=30 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the process of wrapping graphite fibre sheets to build a rod creates imperfections that result in rod twist during casting. Rod twist is minimized by orienting the rod guides along the side of the rod with the most 'give'. This is done by flexing the rod and feeling for the point of most give or by using computerized rod testing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flycatcherinc.com/level1/zero_balance_detail.php Fly Rod Balancing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919002912/http://www.flycatcherinc.com/level1/zero_balance_detail.php |date=19 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Custom rod building is an active hobby among fly fishermen. See [[Fly rod building]].

===Tenkara rods===
Tenkara rods are a type of fly rod used for [[tenkara fishing]] in Japan. A mixture of the rods in the other categories, they are carbon rods, fly rods and telescopic rods all in one. These are ultra-light and very portable telescopic rods (read more about telescopic below). Their extended length normally ranges from {{convert|11|to|13|ft|m|round=0.5}}, and they have a very soft action. The action of tenkara rods has been standardized as a ratio of &quot;how many parts are stiffer : how many tip parts bend more easily&quot;. The standard actions are 5:5, 6:4, 7:3, and 8:2, with 5:5 being a softer/slower rod, and 8:2 being a stiffer rod.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tenkarausa.com/about.php Tenkara USA, About Tenkara] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421044049/http://www.tenkarausa.com/about.php |date=21 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to western fly-rods tenkara rods also have cork, and sometimes even wooden handles, with wooden handles (such as red-pine, and phoenix-tree wood) being the more prized rods due to their increased sensitivity to fish bites and the heavier feel that helps balance the rods. Tenkara rods have no guides. Tenkara is a fixed-line fishing method, where no reel is used, but rather the line is tied directly to the tip of the rod. Like the carbon rods mentioned above this allows for &quot;very precise positioning of the [[Fly lure|fly]] of which the which in turn enables huge catches of fish with accurate feeding&quot;. One of the most common flies used in tenkara fishing is the [[Sakasa Kebari]]. Tenkara fishing is very popular in Japan, where these rods can be found in every major tackle shop. In the US, tenkara is beginning to grow in popularity.

===IM/Modulus===
{{Howto|section|date=January 2010}}
IM6, IM7, etc. are trade names for particular graphite produced by the Hexcel Corporation. These numbers are not industry standards nor an indication of quality, especially since other companies use the designations to refer to graphite not made by Hexcel. At best, they allow you to compare the quality of the material used to build different rods by the same manufacturer: an IM7 rod would use better graphite than an IM6 rod if both are made by the same manufacturer. It is more difficult to say the same about rods from two different companies, since they could be made from material from completely different manufacturers.

Modulus refers to the stiffness of the graphite, not the amount of material used or the number of graphite fibres incorporated into the sheets. Buying a rod based solely on the modulus rating is a mistake because other factors must be considered, for example, if the fisherman does not want the stiffest rod for light line techniques or cranking. In addition, other qualities must be incorporated in the graphite itself and the rod must be designed correctly to ensure the best performance and durability of the rod. The other components that go into a quality rod can also add significantly to the cost.

As of both IM and modulus, the higher rating, the stiffer the carbon fibres in the rod, together with this stiffness, the carbon also becomes more brittle and show more wear over time.

===Spin casting rods===
Spin casting rods are rods designed to hold a [[Fishing reel|spin casting reel]], which are normally mounted above the handle. Spin casting rods also have small eyes and, frequently, a forefinger grip trigger. They are very similar to bait casting rods, to the point where either type of reel may be used on a particular rod. While rods were at one time offered as specific &quot;spin casting&quot; or &quot;bait casting&quot; rods, this has become uncommon, as the rod design is suited to either fishing style, and today they are generally called simply &quot;casting rods&quot;, and are usually offered with no distinction as to which style they are best suited for in use.

===Baitcasting rods===
While the easy to use spin casting rods are often used by novice anglers, baitcasting rods and reels are generally more difficult to use. Professional anglers, however, prefer baitcasting rod and reel combos because baitcasting reels grant anglers more accuracy in their casts. Casting rods are typically viewed as somewhat more powerful than their spinning rod counterparts â€“ they can use heavier line and can handle heavier cover. Baitcasting rods low profile design along with a super silent high-speed 7.0:1-line retrieve.

===Spinning rods===
[[File:20121016-Snoek2-Fort2-5gr-Stilon16-Jan edit1-1080.jpg|thumb|{{convert|26.4|in|cm|adj=mid|-long|round=5}} pike caught on an ultra-light spinning rod ({{convert|5|g|gr|abbr=off|disp=or|adj=on|round=5}} casting weight) using a {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=on}} spinner bait]]
Spinning rods are made from graphite or fiberglass with a cork or PVC foam handle, and tend to be between {{convert|5|and|8.5|ft|m|round=0.5}} in length. Typically, spinning rods have anywhere from 5â€“8 guides arranged along the underside of the rod to help control the line. The eyes decrease in size from the handle to the tip, with the one nearest the handle usually much larger than the rest to allow less friction as the coiled line comes off the reel, and to gather the very large loops of line that come off the spinning reel's spool. Unlike bait casting and spin casting reels, the spinning reel hangs beneath the rod rather than sitting on top, and is held in place with a sliding or locking reel seat. The fisherman's second and third fingers straddle the &quot;leg&quot; of the reel where it is attached to the reel seat on the rod, and the weight of the reel hangs beneath the rod, which makes for a more comfortable way to fish for extended periods. This also allows the rod to be held in the fisherman's dominant hand (the handle on most modern spinning reels is reversible) which greatly increases control and nuance applied to the rod itself. Spinning rods and reels are widely used in fishing for popular North American sport fish including bass, [[trout]], [[Esox|pike]] and [[walleye]]. Popular targets for spinning in the UK and European continent are pike, perch, eel and zander (walleye). Longer spinning rods with elongated grip handles for two-handed casting are frequently employed for saltwater or steelhead and salmon fishing. Spinning rods are also widely used for trolling and still fishing with live bait.

===Ultra-light rods===
These rods are used to fish for smaller species, they provide more sport with larger fish, or to enable fishing with lighter line and smaller lures. Though the term is commonly used to refer to spinning or spin-cast rods and tackle, fly rods in smaller line weights (size #0â€“#3) have also long been utilized for ultra-light fishing, as well as to protect the thin-diameter, lightweight end section of leader, or [[tippet]], used in this type of angling.

Ultra-light spinning and casting rods are generally shorter ({{convert|4|to|5.5|ft|m|disp=or|sp=us}} is common) lighter, and more limber than normal rods. Tip actions vary from slow to fast, depending upon intended use. These rods usually carry {{convert|1|to|6|lbf|kgf N|round=0.5}} test [[fishing line]]. Some ultra-light rods are capable of casting lures as light as {{convert|1/64|oz|g|abbr=off|adj=pre|of an}} â€“ typically small spinners, wet flies, [[crappie jigs]], tubes, or bait such as [[trout worms]]. Originally produced to bring more excitement to the sport, ultra-light spin fishing is now widely used for [[crappie]], [[trout]], [[bass (fish)|bass]], [[bluegill]], roach, perch, bream, pumpkin-seed, tench and other types of [[pan fish]].

===Ice rods===
Modern ice rods are typically very short spinning rods, varying between {{convert|24|and|36|in|cm}} in length. Classic ice rods â€“ still widely used â€“ are simply stiff rod-like pieces of wood, usually with a carved wooden handle, a couple of line guides, and two opposing hooks mounted ahead of the handle to hand-wind the line around. Ice rods are used to fish through holes in the cover ice of frozen lakes and ponds.

===Sea rods===
Sea rods are designed for use with fish from the ocean. They are long, (around {{convert|4|m|ft|order=flip|disp=or|sp=us}} on average), extremely thick, and feature huge and heavy tips, eyes, and handles. The largest of sea rods are for use with sport fishing boats. Some of these are specialized rods, including shark rods, and marlin rods, and are for use with very heavy equipment.

===Surf rods===
The most common type of sea rods are for [[Beach casting|surf casting]]. [[ocean surface wave|Surf]] casting rods resemble oversized spinning or bait casting rods with long grip handles intended for two-handed casting techniques. Generally between {{convert|10|and|14|ft|m|0}} in length, surf casting rods need to be longer in order for the user cast the lure or bait beyond the breaking surf where fish tend to congregate, and sturdy enough to cast heavy weighted lures or bait needed to hold the bottom in rough water. They are almost always used in shore fishing (sea fishing from the shoreline) from the beach, rocks or other shore feature. Some surfcasters use powerful rods to cast up to {{convert|6|oz|g|abbr=off|spell=in}} or more of lead weight, artificial lures, and/or bait over {{convert|100|yd|m|-1|spell=in}}.

===Trolling rods===
Trolling is a fishing method of casting the lure or bait to the side of, or behind, a moving boat, and letting the motion of the boat pull the bait through the water. In theory, for light and medium freshwater gamefishing, any casting or spinning rod (with the possible exception of ultralight rods) can be used for trolling. In the last 30 years, most manufacturers have developed a complete line of generally long, heavily built rods sold as &quot;Trolling Rods&quot;, and aimed generally at ocean anglers and [[Great Lakes]] salmon and steelhead fishermen. A rod effective for trolling should have relatively fast action, as a very &quot;whippy&quot; slow action rod is extremely frustrating to troll with, and a fast action (fairly stiff) rod is generally much easier to work with when fishing by this method. Perhaps the extreme in this philosophy was reached during the 1940s and early 1950s, when the now-defunct True Temper corporation â€“ a maker of garden tools â€“ marketed a line of trolling rods of {{convert|4.5|to|5|ft|m|adj=on}} length made of tempered steel which were square in cross section. They acted as excellent trolling rods, though the action was much too stiff for sportsmanlike playing of fish once hooked. As Great Lakes sportfishing in particular becomes more popular with each passing year, all rod manufacturers continue to expand their lines of dedicated &quot;trolling&quot; rods, though as noted, for most inland lake and stream fishing, a good casting or spinning rod is perfectly adequate for trolling.

===Telescopic rods===
[[File:Telescopic rod. Lake Baikal. Eastern Siberia.jpg|thumb|Telescopic rod. Lake Baikal. Eastern Siberia]]
Telescopic fishing rods are designed to collapse down to a short length and open to a long rod. {{convert|20|or|30|ft|m|0|adj=on}} rods can close to as little as {{convert|1+1/2|ft|cm|spell=in|round=5}}. This makes the rods very easy to transport to remote areas or travel on buses, compact cars, or public buses and subways. Telescopic fishing rods are made from the same materials as conventional multi-piece rods. Graphite, carbon, and sometimes fibreglass, or composites of these materials, are designed to slip into each other so that they open and close. The eyes on the spinning rods are generally, but not always, a special design to aid in making the end of each section stronger. Various grade eyes available in conventional rods are also available in telescopic fishing rods. The eyeless Tenkara style rods are also of this type and are typically made from carbon and/or graphite.

Care for telescopic fishing rods is much the same as other rods. The only difference being that one should not open the telescopic rod in manner that whips a closed rod into the open position rapidly. Whipping or flinging a telescopic fishing rod open may and likely will cause it to be difficult to close. When closing the rods make a slight twisting motion while pushing the sections together. Often the rods come with tip covers to protect the tip and guides. Additionally, extra care must be taken not to get dirt or sand in the joints; due to their design this can easily damage this style of rod.

Telescopic rods are popular among [[Surf fishing|surf fishermen]]. Carrying around a {{convert|12|or|14|ft|m|adj=on|round=0.5}} surf fishing rod, even in two pieces, is cumbersome. The shorter the sections the shorter they close, the more eyes they have, and the better the power curve is in them. More eyes means better weight and stress distribution throughout the parabolic arc. This translates to further casting, stronger fish fighting abilities, and less breaking of the rod.

[[Image:Fishing reel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A spinning reel]]
A '''fishing reel''' is a cylindrical device attached to a [[fishing rod]] used in winding and stowing line.&lt;ref&gt;[Shorter OED 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern fishing reels usually have fittings aiding in casting for distance and accuracy, as well as retrieving line. Fishing reels are traditionally used in the recreational sport of [[angling]] and competitive [[casting (sport)|casting]].  They are typically attached to a fishing rod, though some specialized reels with pressure sensors for immediate retrieval are equipped on downrigger systems which are mounted directly to an ocean-going sport boat's [[gunwale]]s or [[transom (nautical)|transom]]s and are used for &quot;deep drop&quot; and trolling.

The earliest known fishing reel was apparently invented during the [[Song dynasty]] China by a known illustration of an angler fishing with reel from Chinese paintings and records beginning about 1195 AD. Fishing reels first appeared in the Western Hemisphere in England around 1650 AD. An incident is disclosed in an excerpt from author [[Thomas Barker (fishing guide)|Thomas Barker]] found in his book, ''The Art of Angling: wherein are discovered many rare secrets, very necessary to be knowne by all that delight in that recreation'':

{{quote|.... The manner of his Trouling was, with a Hazell Rod of twelve foot long, with a Ring of Wyre in the top of his Rod, for his Line to runne thorow: within two foot of the bottome of the Rod there was a hole made, for to put in a winde, to turne with a barrell, to gather up his Line, and loose at his pleasure; this was his manner of Trouling....}}

In the 1760s, London tackle shops were advertising multiplying or gear-retrieved reels.  The first popular American fishing reel appeared in the U.S. around 1820.

==History==
===Origins in China===
{{see also|Science and technology of the Song dynasty}}
[[Image:Angler on a Wintry Lake, by Ma Yuan, 1195.jpg|thumb|&quot;Angler on a Wintry Lake,&quot; painted in 1195 by [[Ma Yuan (painter)|Ma Yuan]], featuring the oldest known depiction of a fishing reel, although the oldest description of a fishing reel in China dates to the 3rd century AD]]
In literary records, the earliest evidence of the fishing reel comes from a 4th-century AD&lt;ref&gt;Birrell (1993), 185.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hucker (1975), 206.&lt;/ref&gt; work entitled ''Lives of Famous Immortals''.&lt;ref&gt;Ronan (1994), 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Temple (1986), 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known depiction of a fishing reel comes from a [[Southern Song]] (1127&amp;ndash;1279) painting done in 1195 by [[Ma Yuan (painter)|Ma Yuan]] (c. 1160&amp;ndash;1225) called &quot;Angler on a Wintry Lake,&quot; showing a man sitting on a small [[sampan]] boat while casting out his [[fishing line]].&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 4 part 2 100&quot;&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 100 &amp; PLATE CXLVII.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another fishing reel was featured in a painting by [[Wu Zhen (painter)|Wu Zhen]] (1280&amp;ndash;1354).&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 4 part 2 100&quot;/&gt; The book ''Tianzhu lingqian'' (Holy Lections from Indian Sources), printed sometime between 1208 and 1224, features two different [[Woodcut|woodblock print illustrations]] of fishing reels being used.&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 4 part 2 100&quot;/&gt; An [[Armenia]]n parchment Gospel of the 13th century shows a reel (though not as clearly depicted as the Chinese ones).&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 4 part 2 100&quot;/&gt; The ''[[Sancai Tuhui]]'', a [[Chinese encyclopedias|Chinese encyclopedia]] published in 1609, features the next known picture of a fishing reel and vividly shows the [[windlass]] pulley of the device.&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 4 part 2 100&quot;/&gt; These five pictures mentioned are the only ones which feature fishing reels before the year 1651.&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 4 part 2 100&quot;/&gt;

===Development in England===
[[File:Ustonson advert.jpg|thumb|right|Trading card of the Ustonson company, an early firm specializing in fishing equipment, and holder of a [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal Warrant]] from the 1760s.]]

The first English book on fishing is &quot;A Treatise of Fishing with an Angle&quot; in 1496 (its spelling respective to the manner of the date is ''The Treatyse of Fysshynge with an Angle''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=the Treatyse of Fyssgynge with an Angle |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/57943}}&lt;/ref&gt;'). However, the book did not mention a reel. A primitive reel was first cited in the book, &quot;The Art of Angling&quot; 1651.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Book Encyclopedia Volume 7|publisher=Field Enterprises Educational Corp.|year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fishing reels first appeared in England around 1650, a time of growing interest in [[fly fishing]].

The fishing industry became commercialized in the 18th century, with rods and tackle being sold at the [[haberdashers]] store. After the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666, artisans moved to [[Redditch]] which became a centre of production of fishing related products from the 1730s. [[Onesimus Ustonson]] established his trading shop in 1761, and his establishment remained as a market leader for the next century. He received a [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal Warrant]] from three successive monarchs starting with King [[George IV]].

Some have credited Onesimus with the invention of the fishing reel - he was certainly the first to advertise its sale. Early multiplying reels were wide and had a small diameter, and their gears, made of [[brass]], often wore down after extensive use. His earliest advertisement in the form of a trading card date from 1768 and was entitled ''To all lovers of angling''. A full list of the tackles he sold included artificial flies, and 'the best sort of multiplying brass winches both stop and plain'. The commercialization of the industry came at a time of expanded interest in fishing as a recreational hobby for members of the [[aristocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calmproductions.com/acatalog/GT_Fishing%20Tackle_Chp3.pdf|title=Fishing Tackle Chapter 3|access-date=2014-07-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918103205/http://www.calmproductions.com/acatalog/GT_Fishing%20Tackle_Chp3.pdf|archive-date=2013-09-18|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern reel design had begun in England during the latter part of the 18th century, and the predominant model in use was known as the '[[Nottingham]] reel'. The reel was a wide drum which spooled out freely, and was ideal for allowing the bait to drift along way out with the current.

Tackle design began to improve from the 1880s. The introduction of new woods to the manufacture of fly rods made it possible to cast flies into the wind on [[silk]] lines, instead of [[horse hair]]. These lines allowed for a much greater casting distance. A negative consequence of this, was that it became easy for the much longer line to get into a tangle. This problem spurred the invention of the regulator to evenly spool the line out and prevent tangling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brit&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/208708/fishing/2330/Early-history#ref70275|title=fishing|encyclopedia=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Illingworth, 1st Baron Illingworth]] a textiles magnate, patented the modern form of fixed-spool spinning reel in 1905. When casting Illingworth's reel design, the line was drawn off the leading edge of the spool, but was restrained and rewound by a line pickup, a device which orbits around the stationary spool. Because the line did not have to pull against a rotating spool, much lighter lures could be cast than with conventional reels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brit&quot;/&gt;

===Development in the United States===
Geared multiplying reels never successfully caught on in Britain, but had more success in the United States, where models were modified by [[George Snyder (fly reels)|George Snyder]] of [[Kentucky]] into his bait-casting reel, the first American-made design in 1810.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.flyfishinghistory.com/tech18th.htm|title=Fly Fishing in the Eighteenth Century|author=Andrew N.

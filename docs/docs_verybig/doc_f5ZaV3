Following the success of Armstrong's &quot;Heebie Jeebies,&quot; a number of popular songs featured scat singing. In June 1927, [[Harry Barris]] and [[Bing Crosby]] of bandleader [[Paul Whiteman]]'s &quot;[[The Rhythm Boys]]&quot; scatted on several songs including &quot;[[Mississippi Mud]],&quot; which Barris had composed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hendricks|2003|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 26, 1927, [[Duke Ellington]]'s Orchestra recorded &quot;[[Creole Love Call]]&quot; featuring [[Adelaide Hall]] singing wordlessly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams 2003&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2003|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hall's wordless vocals and &quot;evocative growls&quot; were hailed as serving as &quot;another instrument.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hentoff|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although creativity must be shared between Ellington and Hall as he knew the style of performance he wanted, Hall was the one who was able to produce the sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams 2003&quot;/&gt; A year later, in October 1928, Ellington repeated the experiment in one of his versions of &quot;[[The Mooche]],&quot; with Getrude &quot;Baby&quot; Cox singing scat after a muted similar trombone solo by [[Tricky Sam Nanton|Joe &quot;Tricky Sam&quot; Nanton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lawrence|2001|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Great Depression]], bands such as [[The Boswell Sisters]] regularly employed scatting on their records, including the high complexity of scatting at the same time, in harmony.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson 1981&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson|1981|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is their version of &quot;[[It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson 1981&quot;/&gt; The Boswell Sisters' &quot;inventive use of scat singing was a source for [[Ella Fitzgerald]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson 1981&quot;/&gt; As a young girl, Fitzgerald often practiced imitating Connee Boswell's scatting for hours.{{sfn|Nicholson|1993|pp=10–12}} 

Fitzgerald herself would become a talented scat singer and later claimed to be the &quot;best vocal improviser jazz has ever had,&quot; and critics since then have been in almost universal agreement with her.&lt;ref name=f282&gt;{{Harvnb|Friedwald|1990|p=282}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this 1930s era, other famous scat singers included [[Scatman Crothers]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Scatman Crothers&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|New York Times|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;—who would go on to movie and television fame&lt;ref name=&quot;Scatman Crothers&quot;/&gt;—and [[British dance band]] trumpeter and vocalist [[Nat Gonella]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott 2017&quot;/&gt; whose scat-singing recordings were banned{{efn|name=Gonella|{{Harvnb|Scott|2017|p=302}}: In 1930s &quot;[[Nazi Germany]], the records of British trumpeter and bandleader [[Nat Gonella]] were banned there and scat singing was a criminal offence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott 2017&quot;/&gt;}} in [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott 2017&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Scott|2017|p=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later development ===
Over the years, as jazz music developed and grew in complexity, scat singing did as well. During the [[bop era]] of the 1940s, more highly developed vocal improvisation surged in popularity.&lt;ref name=&quot;grove&quot;/&gt; [[Annie Ross]], a bop singer, expressed a common sentiment among vocalists at the time: &quot;The [scat] music was so exciting, everyone wanted to do it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cp130&quot;/&gt; And many did: [[Eddie Jefferson]], [[Betty Carter]], [[Anita O'Day]], [[Joe Carroll (singer)|Joe Carroll]], [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Carmen McRae]], [[Jon Hendricks]], [[Babs Gonzales]], and [[Dizzy Gillespie]] were all singers in the idiom.&lt;ref name=&quot;grove&quot;/&gt; 

Free jazz and the influence of world musicians on the medium pushed jazz singing nearer to avant-garde art music.&lt;ref name=&quot;grove&quot;/&gt; In the 1960s [[Ward Swingle]] was the product of an unusually liberal musical education. He took the scat singing idea and applied it to the works of Bach, creating [[The Swingle Singers]]. Scat singing was also used by [[Louis Prima]] and others in the song &quot;[[I Wan'na Be Like You (The Monkey Song)|I Wan'na Be Like You]]&quot; in Disney's ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' (1967).

The bop revival of the 1970s renewed interest in bop scat singing, and young scat singers viewed themselves as a continuation of the classic bop tradition. The medium continues to evolve, and vocal improvisation now often develops independently of changes in instrumental jazz.&lt;ref name=&quot;grove&quot;/&gt;

During the mid-1990s, jazz artist John Paul Larkin (better known as [[Scatman John]]) renewed interest in the genre briefly when he began fusing jazz singing with [[pop music]] and [[electronica]], scoring a world-wide hit with the song &quot;[[Scatman (Ski Ba Bop Ba Dop Bop)]]&quot; in 1994. Vocal improviser [[Bobby McFerrin]]'s performances have shown that &quot;wordless singing has traveled far from the concepts demonstrated by Louis Armstrong, Gladys Bentley, Cab Calloway, Anita O'Day, and Leo Watson.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowther|Pinfold|1997|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vocal bass ===
Vocal bass is a form of scat singing that is intended to vocally simulate instrumental [[basslines]] that are typically performed by bass players. A technique most commonly used by bass singers in a cappella groups is to simulate an instrumental rhythm section, often alongside a [[Mouth drumming|vocal percussionist]] or [[beatboxer]]. Some notable vocal bass artists are [[Home Free (group)|Tim Foust]], [[Home Free (group)|Adam Chance]], [[Bobby McFerrin]], [[Al Jarreau]], [[Reggie Watts]], [[take 6|Alvin Chea]], [[DCappella|Joe Santoni]], [[Avi Kaplan]], [[Scott Hoying]],  [[Pentatonix|Matt Sallee]] and Geoff Castellucci.

=== Use in hip hop  ===
Many [[hip hop music|hip hop]] artists and [[rapper]]s use scat singing to come up with the rhythms of their raps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards, Paul 2009, p MC&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Edwards|2009|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tajai]] of the group [[Souls of Mischief]] states the following in the book ''[[How to Rap]]'': &quot;Sometimes my rhythms come from scatting. I usually make a scat kind of skeleton and then fill in the words. I make a skeleton of the flow first, and then I put words into it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards, Paul 2009, p MC&quot;/&gt; The group [[Lifesavas]] describe a similar process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards, Paul 2009, p MC&quot;/&gt; Rapper [[Tech N9ne]] has been recorded demonstrating exactly how this method works,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Godfrey|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gangsta rapper [[Eazy-E]] uses it extensively in his song &quot;[[Eternal E|Eazy Street]].&quot;

== Historical theories  ==
[[Image:Louis Armstrong restored.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Berliner (ethnomusicologist)|Paul Berliner]] has suggested that scat singing arose from instrumental soloists like [[Louis Armstrong]] (''pictured'') formulating jazz riffs vocally.&lt;ref name=b181/&gt;]]

Some writers have proposed that scat has its roots in [[African music|African musical traditions]].&lt;ref name=&quot;grove&quot;/&gt; In much African music, &quot;human voice and instruments assume a kind of musical parity&quot; and are &quot;at times so close in timbre and so inextricably interwoven within the music's fabric as to be nearly indistinguishable.&quot;&lt;ref name=b68&gt;{{Harvnb|Berliner|1994|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dick Higgins]] likewise attributes scat singing to traditions of [[sound poetry]] in African-American music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Higgins|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[West African music]], it is typical to convert drum rhythms into vocal melodies; common rhythmic patterns are assigned specific syllabic translations.&lt;ref name=&quot;grove&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this theory fails to account for the existence—even in the earliest recorded examples of scatting—of free improvisation by the vocalist.&lt;ref name=&quot;grove&quot;/&gt; It is therefore more likely that scat singing evolved independently in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;grove&quot;/&gt;

Others have proposed that scat singing arose from jazz musicians' practice of formulating riffs vocally before performing them instrumentally.&lt;ref name=b181/&gt; (The adage &quot;If you can't sing it, you can't play it&quot; was common in the early New Orleans jazz scene.&lt;ref name=b181&gt;{{Harvnb|Berliner|1994|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;) In this manner, soloists like Louis Armstrong became able to double as vocalists, switching effortlessly between instrumental solos and scatting.&lt;ref name=b181/&gt;

Scat singing also resembles the Irish/Scottish practice of [[lilting]] or diddling, a type of vocal music that involves using nonsensical syllables to sing non-vocal dance tunes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ó Nualláin|2002|pp=306–307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical assessment ==
Scat singing can allow jazz singers to have the same improvisational opportunities as jazz instrumentalists: scatting can be rhythmically and harmonically improvisational without concern about destroying the lyric.&lt;ref name=cp132&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowther|Pinfold|1997|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially when [[bebop]] was developing, singers found scat to be the best way to adequately engage in the performance of jazz.&lt;ref name=&quot;cp130&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowther|Pinfold|1997|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scatting may be desirable because it does not &quot;taint the music with the impurity of denotation.&quot;&lt;ref name=grant&gt;{{Harvnb|Grant|1995|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of conveying linguistic content and pointing to something outside itself, scat music—like instrumental music—is self-referential and &quot;d[oes] what it mean[s].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leonard|1986|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this wordlessness, commentators have written, scat singing can describe matters beyond words.&lt;ref name=grant/&gt;&lt;ref name=f37&gt;{{Harvnb|Friedwald|1990|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music critic [[Will Friedwald]] has written that Louis Armstrong's scatting, for example, &quot;has tapped into his own core of emotion,&quot; releasing emotions &quot;so deep, so real&quot; that they are unspeakable; his words &quot;bypass our ears and our brains and go directly for our hearts and souls.&quot;&lt;ref name=f37/&gt;

Scat singing has never been universally accepted, even by jazz enthusiasts. Writer and critic [[Leonard Feather]] offers an extreme view; he once said that &quot;scat singing—with only a couple exceptions—should be banned.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cp130&quot;/&gt; He also wrote the lyrics to the jazz song &quot;[[Whisper Not (song)|Whisper Not]],&quot; which Ella Fitzgerald then recorded on her 1966 Verve release of the same name. Many jazz singers, including [[Bessie Smith]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Jimmy Rushing]], and [[Dinah Washington]], have avoided scat entirely.&lt;ref name=g162&gt;{{Harvnb|Giddins|2000|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Keith Wozniak''' (born January 19, 1971) is an American musician best known as the lead singer, guitarist and songwriter of the band [[Marcy Playground]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p200676/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Marcy Playground|last=Prato|first=Greg|publisher=[[All Media Guide|AMG]]|accessdate=May 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the son of Robert Wozniak, a developmental psychologist, and Nora Wozniak, a free-spirited [[Bohemianism|bohemian]].

==Background==

Wozniak learned how to play the guitar at the age of 14.  His first solo effort was ''[[Zog BogBean - From the Marcy Playground]]'' recorded in his own home in 1990.  In 2006 he recorded his second solo album, ''[[Leaving Wonderland...in a fit of rage]]'' and while searching for a label to release it on, decided to call it a [[Marcy Playground]] album and include new songs recorded with the rest of the band.[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1528431/20060411/dream.jhtml?headlines=true&amp;rsspartner=rssYahooNewscrawler].

Aside from influences such as [[Neil Young]], [[Paul Simon]], and [[Van Morrison]], an early influence in his life was his high school girlfriend from tenth grade until his freshmen year in college, Sherry Fraser, of the band Two Ton Boa.  She collaborated with Wozniak on Zog Bogbean, and on the song &quot;Ancient Walls of Flowers&quot; from Marcy Playground's self-titled album.  The song &quot;[[Sherry Fraser]]&quot; was written about her.

Wozniak moved to [[Great Neck]], [[Long Island]] in 1994 in order to collaborate with his then friend Jared Kotler, a multi-instrumentalist/music producer. Wozniak had written two albums worth of material and began recording what would become the eponymous &quot;Marcy Playground&quot; recordings at Sabella Recording studios in suburban New York.  These included the definitive recording of the soon-to-be hit single &quot;Sex and Candy&quot;. More recording sessions followed with hiring Dylan Keefe to take over bass playing duties. Over two albums of material were recorded at Sebella by engineer Ken Goia, and these recordings brought the band to the attention of Capitol Records. The band was soon signed to Capitol and began a year-long series of club dates in New York City performing live in support of &quot;Marcy Playground&quot;.  The band then began a radio promotion tour of the U.S. following the release of the first single &quot;Poppies&quot;.  Followup single &quot;Sex and Candy&quot; was released shortly afterward. This song became very popular, rising to a then-record 15 weeks at number one on the U.S.  [[Modern Rock Tracks chart]]. Wozniak continues to regularly write, record and tour with Marcy Playground. 

Wozniak is currently living in Ontario, Canada, with wife Amanda Thurlow-Wozniak. He has four sons, Luke, Keegan (who inspired the song &quot;Keegan's Christmas&quot;), Dylan, and Justin.

== Other collaborations ==
* In 2003, Wozniak helped produce Canadian rock band [[Stabilo (band)|Stabilo's]] second album, recorded at John's studio, Mushroom Studios.
* Later that year, Wozniak would work with [[Jimi Haha]] of the band [[Jimmie's Chicken Shack]] to write the song &quot;Paper Dolls&quot;. The song appeared on both bands albums in 2004.[https://archive.is/20130124065005/http://www.fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/2001/082001/08092001/357006/printer_friendly]
* In 2006, Wozniak teamed up with Canadian hit-maker [[Daniel Powter]] ([[Bad Day (Daniel Powter song)|&quot;Bad Day&quot;]]) amongst other musicians to add new content to [[Leaving Wonderland...in a Fit of Rage]], the solo album turned [[Marcy Playground]] album.

The '''Wilsons Promontory National Park''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wilsons Promontory National Park|work=Gazetteer of Australia|publisher=Geoscience Australia|url=http://www.ga.gov.au/bin/gazd01?rec=258452|accessdate=14 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; commonly known as '''Wilsons Prom''' or '''The Prom''',&lt;ref name=&quot;visitvictoria.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wilsons Promontory, Gippsland, Victoria, Australia|url = http://www.visitvictoria.com/Regions/Gippsland/Things-to-do/Nature-and-wildlife/National-parks-and-reserves/Wilsons-Promontory|website = Tourism Victoria home|accessdate = 2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[national park]] in the [[Gippsland]] region of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]], located approximately {{convert|157|km}} southeast of [[Melbourne]].

The {{convert|50500|ha|acre|adj=on}} national park is the southernmost national park on mainland Australia, known for its [[rainforests]], beaches and abundant wildlife. The national park covers the southern portion of [[Wilsons Promontory]], a [[peninsula]] containing [[South Point (Wilsons Promontory)|South Point]], the southernmost point on the Australian mainland. A [[Wilsons Promontory Lighthouse|lighthouse]] on the [[South East Point, Wilsons Promontory|south-east corner]] of the peninsula is the southernmost lighthouse on mainland Australia and has operated continuously since 1859.

The Park is highly popular with bushwalkers and campers, and has a number of lodges and serviced camping areas at a camping area near the mouth of [[Tidal River, Wilsons Promontory|Tidal River]].

==History==
[[Indigenous Australians]] occupied the area at least 6,500 years ago based on archaeological records.

The first Europeans to sight Wilsons Promontory are believed to be [[George Bass]] and [[Matthew Flinders]] in 1798.

Extensive [[Seal hunting|sealing]] took place at Sealer's Cove during the 19th Century, such that seals are no longer found there.

Lobbying by the [[Field Naturalists Club of Victoria]] and the [[Royal Society of Victoria]] (including [[Arthur Henry Shakespeare Lucas]]) led to the [[Government of Victoria]] temporarily reserving the area as National Park in 1898, made permanent in 1908. The original settlement in the Park was on the Darby River site, where a chalet existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parkweb.vic.gov.au/explore/parks/wilsons-promontory-national-park|title=Wilsons Promontory National Park|work=Parks Victoria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wilsons Promontory was used as commando training area during [[World War II]]. A memorial to commandos who lost their lives in World War II is located at Tidal River.

A large section of the park was burnt out in April 2005 by a [[Bushfires in Australia|bushfire]] caused by a [[controlled burn]] that breached containment lines because of warmer and windier conditions than were forecast for that day, causing the evacuation of six-hundred people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2005/06/22/1397945.htm|title=Wilsons Promontory blaze inquiry continues|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|location=Australia|date=22 June 2005|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Black Saturday Fires of February 2009 throughout Victoria, trees in the Wilsons Promontory were struck by lightning, which then led to the loss of up to 50% of the national park through major fire damage.

==Camping==
[[File:Wilson's Promontory - Tidal River from Mt Oberon - Dec 2004.jpg|thumb|Tidal River as viewed from the summit of Mount Oberon]]
Tidal River is the main location for accommodation and camping in Wilsons Promontory National Park. Tidal River Campground has 484 camping and caravan sites (including 20 powered sites) situated near the beach and river. There are also 11 remote walk-in sites located within the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Parks Victoria - Tidal River campground|url = https://www.parks.vic.gov.au/places-to-see/parks/wilsons-promontory-national-park/where-to-stay/tidal-river-campground|website = parks.vic.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tidal River camping ground is nestled in sand dunes behind Norman Bay, on the western side of the peninsula.&lt;ref name=&quot;visitvictoria.com&quot;/&gt; The only road open to visitors leads from [[Yanakie, Victoria|Yanakie]] at the park entrance to [[Tidal River, Victoria|Tidal River]], a distance of 32 kilometres (20&amp;nbsp;mi).

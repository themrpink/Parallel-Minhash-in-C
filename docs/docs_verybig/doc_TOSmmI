===Acceptance of the post-war order of the Congress of Vienna===
After his release from a Prussian prison in February 1815, at first Frederick Augustus delayed his agreement to the division of his country. However, having no other option, he finally gave in, and on 18 May consented to the peace treaty laid before him by Prussia and Russia. With the signing of the treaty on 21 May 1815, 57% of Saxon territory and 42% of the Saxon population was turned over to Prussia.

Places and areas that had been connected to the Saxon landscape for hundreds of years became completely foreign, absorbed in part into artificially created administrative regions. Examples include [[Wittenberg]], the old capital of the Saxon Electoral State during the Holy Roman Empire, and seat of the National University made famous by [[Martin Luther]] and Melanchthon (which was already done away with in 1817 by means of a merger with the Prussian University of Halle), and [[Torgau]], birthplace and place of residence of the Elector [[Frederick the Wise]], which was incorporated into one of the new hybrids created by Prussia under the name [[Province of Saxony]]. [[Lower Lusatia]], which like [[Upper Lusatia]] had preserved its constitutional autonomy under Saxon rule, was incorporated into the [[Province of Brandenburg]] and ceased to exist as a state. Upper Lusatia was arbitrarily divided: the area assigned to Prussia, including [[Görlitz]], was added to the [[Province of Silesia]]; these areas also lost their constitutional autonomy.

On 22 May 1815 Frederick Augustus abdicated as ruler of the Duchy of Warsaw, whose territory was annexed mainly to Russia, but also partly to Prussia and Austria. In the area assigned to Russia, a [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] was created to join in a hereditary union with the Russian throne. The old royal city of Kraków no longer belonged to the new kingdom, and became a [[Republic of Kraków|separate republic]]. The internal autonomy that it enjoyed at first was abolished in 1831 after the [[November Uprising|Polish Uprising]].

==King of Saxony==

===Standing among the Saxon people upon his return===
When Frederick returned home to Saxony in July 1815 he was greeted enthusiastically throughout the land. Numerous expressions of loyalty also reached the king from the ceded territories, where the populace regarded the new rulers coolly; shortly thereafter the notion of being &quot;mandatory-Prussian&quot; began to circulate. In [[Liège (province)|Liège]], where the majority of the regiments of the Saxon Army had been stationed since the beginning of 1815, there was a revolt at the end of April. At the behest of the Prussian king, [[Generalfeldmarschall]] [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher|Blücher]] was to discharge the soldiers who came from the annexed territories, but Frederick Augustus' men had not yet made their departure, and the Saxon soldiers rioted over it. Blücher had to flee the city and was able to put down the revolt only by calling up additional Prussian troops.

Public opinion in Saxony lay decisively on Frederick Augustus' side at the time of his return. There was a feeling that Prussian policies were too ruthless both against the country and the king. The avarice of special interests in Berlin came across all too clearly as the rewards of the War of Liberation were distributed.

===Final years===
The last twelve years of Frederick Augustus' government passed for the most part quietly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flathe&quot; /&gt; The king's  conservative character, which in foreign policy up to 1806 had manifested itself in unconditional loyalty to Saxon interests, hardened even more after the experience of Napoleonic hegemony. With respect to political reform the King achieved little. Until his death in 1827, which fell on the anniversary of Napoleon's death, little was altered in the constitutional configuration of the Saxon state.  Undoubtedly, the king avoided making such a move out of respect for the rights of the remaining Lusatian upper classes. Just as little came of the desire of many people to transform the existing political system to accommodate a genuine legislature. There was scarcely any lessening of admiration for the old king who had overseen the destiny of Saxony for more than half a century. During his lifetime he gained the epithet &quot;The Just&quot;. Resentment over the delayed economic and social rebuilding of the country was to be felt by his brother, King Anton.

Frederick Augustus was entombed in the Roman Catholic Cathedral of Dresden.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schaefer&quot; /&gt;

==Marriage and issue==
In [[Mannheim]] on 17 January 1769 (by proxy) and again in [[Dresden]] on 29 January 1769 (in person), Frederick Augustus married the Countess Palatine  (''Pfalzgräfin'') [[Amalie of Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld]], sister of King [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria]]. During their marriage, Amalia gave birth to four children, but only one daughter survived to adulthood:

#Stillborn child (1771)
#Stillborn child (1775)
#[[Princess Maria Augusta of Saxony|Maria Augusta Nepomucena Antonia Franziska Xaveria Aloysia]] (b. Dresden, 21 June 1782 – d. Dresden, 14 March 1863)
#Stillborn child (1797)

Frederick Augustus had an illegitimate daughter, born out of an affair with the daughter of a Jewish court financier in Dresden.

Without surviving male issue, Frederick Augustus was succeeded as King of Saxony by his younger brother [[Anthony of Saxony|Anton]].

'''Splenda''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|p|l|ɛ|n|d|ə}} is a global brand of sugar substitutes and reduced-calorie food products.  While they are known for their original formulation containing [[sucralose]], they also manufacture items using natural sweeteners such as [[stevia]] and [[Siraitia grosvenorii|monk fruit]].  It is owned by the American company [[Heartland Food Products Group]].  The high-intensity sweetener ingredient [[sucralose]] used in Splenda is manufactured by the [[United Kingdom|British]] company [[Tate &amp; Lyle]]. 

Sucralose was discovered by Tate &amp; Lyle and researchers at [[Queen Elizabeth College]], [[University of London]], in 1976. Tate &amp; Lyle subsequently developed sucralose-based Splenda products in partnership with [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] subsidiary [[McNeil Nutritionals]], LLC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tateandlyle.com/AboutUs/history/Pages/History.aspx Tate and Lyle history]&lt;/ref&gt; The Splenda brand was transferred to Heartland Food Products Group after their purchase of the line with investor [[Centerbridge Partners]] in 2015.

Since its approval by the [[United States]] government in 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223143211/http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/tpsucral.html | url=http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/tpsucral.html |archivedate=2008-02-23| title=FDA Approves Sucralose|publisher=U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]]|date=April 1, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and introduction there in 1999, sucralose has overtaken [[Equal (sweetener)|Equal]] in the $1.5-billion artificial sweetener market, holding a 62% market share.&lt;ref&gt;Browning, Lynnley (April 6, 2007), [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/06/business/media/06sweet.html Makers of Artificial Sweeteners Go to Court], ''[[New York Times]]'' Business section&lt;/ref&gt; According to market research firm IRI, Splenda sales were $212 million in 2006 in the U.S. while Equal's totaled $48.7 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ&quot;&gt;Johnson,Avery (April 6, 2007), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117582405851161797 How Sweet It Isn't], ''Wall Street Journal'', Marketplace Section, p.B1&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2012 article in ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' it is &quot;the category leader in table-top sweetener in the US&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams2012&quot;&gt;Christopher Adams (Aug 28, 2012), [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10829886 US launch sweet news for kiwi supplier], ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy (caloric) content==
The energy content of a single-serving (1&amp;nbsp;g packet) of Splenda is 3.36&amp;nbsp;kcal, which is 31% of a single-serving (2.8&amp;nbsp;g packet) of granulated sugar (10.8&amp;nbsp;kcal).&lt;ref name=NDL/&gt; In the United States, it is legally labelled &quot;zero calories&quot;;&lt;ref name=NDL&gt;[http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/ USDA Nutrient Data Laboratory Database] [[United States Department of Agriculture]]&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] regulations allow this &quot;if the food contains less than 5 Calories per reference amount customarily consumed and per labeled serving&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=101.60 Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Volume 2, Pg.&amp;nbsp;95&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;101.60] U.S. Food and Drug Administration&lt;/ref&gt; 3.2 packets (3.36&amp;nbsp;kcal each) of Splenda contain the same caloric content as one packet of sugar (10.8&amp;nbsp;kcal).  Further, Splenda contains a relatively small amount of sucralose, little of which is metabolized; virtually all of Splenda's caloric content derives from the [[dextrose]] or highly fluffed [[maltodextrin]] &quot;bulking agents&quot; that give Splenda its volume. Like other [[carbohydrate]]s, dextrose and maltodextrin have 3.75&amp;nbsp;kcal per gram. &lt;!--EDITORS: Please note that with regard to &quot;dextrose and/or maltodextrin&quot; filler, McNeil Nutritionals, LLC has different formulations for Splenda in different packaging. Some are a dextrose/maltodextrin blend, and others are entirely maltodextrin. GOOD - PLEASE PROVIDE VALID CITATIONS ON THE TALK PAGE.--&gt;

==Cooking==
Unlike other artificial sweeteners, sucralose is [[heat stable]] up to 450&amp;nbsp;°F (232&amp;nbsp;°C), so Splenda can be used as a replacement for table sugar in cooking and baking,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Cooking Healthy with Splenda | author1 = JoAnna M. Lund | author2 = Barbara Alpert | name-list-style = amp | publisher = Perigee Trade | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-399-53025-8 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/cookinghealthywi0000lund_b0t0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are Splenda products packaged specifically for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.splenda.com/cooking-baking | title = Cooking and Baking Tips | publisher = Splenda.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In product testing by ''[[Cook's Illustrated]]'', the major drawback to cooking with Splenda was found to be that it does not produce the browning or caramelization the way table sugar does.&lt;ref name=CooksIllustrated&gt;{{cite magazine | url = http://www.cooksillustrated.com/tastetests/overview.asp?docid=10034 | title = Splenda | date = January 1, 2004 | magazine = Cook's Illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Cook's Illustrated'' also found that desserts baked with Splenda were &quot;lacking the artificial flavors that just about every other sugar substitute brings with it&quot;.&lt;ref name=CooksIllustrated/&gt;

==Health and safety regulation==
{{see also|Sucralose#Health, safety, and regulation}}
Splenda usually contains 95% [[dextrose]] (D-glucose) and [[maltodextrin]] (by volume) which the body readily metabolizes, combined with a small amount of mostly indigestible sucralose. Sucralose is made by replacing three select [[hydroxyl|hydrogen-oxygen groups]] on [[sucrose]] (table sugar) molecules with three chlorine atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foodinsight.org/everything-you-need-to-know-about-sucralose/|title=Everything You Need to Know About Sucralose|last=|first=|date=26 November 2018|website=foodinsight.org|publisher=[[International Food Information Council]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=2020-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tightly bound chlorine atoms create a molecular structure that is stable under intense conditions. Sucralose itself is recognized as safe to ingest as a diabetic sugar substitute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Grotz, V Lee |author2=Henry, Robert R |author3=McGill, Janet B |author4=Prince, Melvin J |author5=Shamoon, Harry |author6=Trout, J Richard |author7=Pi-Sunyer, F Xavier | title=Lack of effect of sucralose on glucose homeostasis in subjects with type 2 diabetes | url=http://www.adajournal.org/article/S0002-8223%2803%2901364-6/abstract| journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association |year=2003 |volume=103 | issue=12 | pages=1607–12| doi=10.1016/j.jada.2003.09.021 | pmid=14647086}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Sucralose and diabetes | author=Roberts, Ashley | journal=Foods &amp; Food Ingredients Journal of Japan | year=1999 | volume=182 | pages=49–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the sugars or other carbohydrates used as bulking agents in Splenda products should be evaluated individually. The recommended amount of sucralose that can be consumed on a daily basis over a person's lifetime without any adverse effects is 900&amp;nbsp;mg/kg BW/day, or about 60&amp;nbsp;g for a 70&amp;nbsp;kg (150&amp;nbsp;lb) person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldsmith|first=L. A.|date=2000|title=Acute and subchronic toxicity of sucralose|journal=Food and Chemical Toxicology: An International Journal Published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association|volume=38 Suppl 2|pages=S53–69|doi=10.1016/s0278-6915(00)00028-4|issn=0278-6915|pmid=10882818}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
1 g for a 70 kg person is equivalent to about 75 packets of Splenda or the sweetness of 612 g or 2500 kcal of sugar.
Calculation is as follows using GNU units (technically this is original research, but allowable per WP:CALC):
 (15 mg/kg) * (150 lb) = 1.0205828 g
 (15 mg/kg) * (150 lb) / (8 g / 600) = 76.543712
 (15 mg/kg) * (150 lb) * 600 = 612.3497 g
 (15 mg/kg) * (150 lb) * 600 * (4 kcal/g) = 2449.3988 kcal

A repeated dose study of sucralose in human subjects concluded that &quot;there is no indication that adverse effects on human health would occur from frequent or long-term exposure to sucralose at the maximum anticipated levels of intake&quot;.&lt;ref name=Baird&gt;{{cite journal|title=Repeated dose study of sucralose tolerance in human subjects|author1=Baird, I.

Sucralose may not be completely biologically inert, and a study showed that cooking with sucralose at high temperatures could cause it to degrade into potentially toxic compounds.&lt;ref name=Schiffman&gt;{{cite journal|author=Susan S. Schiffman |author2=Kristina I.

Friedman, Lead Deputy Commissioner for the FDA, [https://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/98fr/040398a.pdf Food Additives Permitted for Direct Addition to Food for Human Consumption; Sucralose] Federal Register: 21 CFR Part 172, Docket No. 87F-0086, April 3, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and the amount of sucralose present in Splenda is slight.

==Marketing controversy==
In 2006, [[Merisant]], the maker of [[Equal (sweetener)|Equal]], filed suit against McNeil Nutritionals in [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania|U.S. District Court, Philadelphia]], alleging that Splenda's tagline; &quot;made from sugar, so it tastes like sugar&quot; is misleading. McNeil argued during the trial that it had never deceived consumers or set out to deceive them, since the product is in fact made from sugar. Merisant asked that McNeil be ordered to surrender profits and modify its advertising. The case ended with an agreement reached outside of court, with undisclosed settlement conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Browning, Lynnley (May 12, 2007) [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/12/business/media/12splenda.html?ex=1336622400&amp;en=8f48609f972bc31d&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss Artificial Sweetener Makers Reach Settlement on Slogan], ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was the latest move in a long-simmering dispute. In 2004, Merisant filed a complaint with the [[Better Business Bureau]] regarding McNeil's advertising. McNeil alleged that Merisant's complaint was in retaliation for a ruling in federal court in [[Puerto Rico]], which forced Merisant to stop packaging Equal in packages resembling Splenda's. McNeil filed suit in Puerto Rico seeking a ruling which would declare its advertising to not be misleading. Following Merisant's lawsuit in Philadelphia, McNeil agreed to a jury trial and to the dismissal of its lawsuit in Puerto Rico.

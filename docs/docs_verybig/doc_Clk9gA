Atil was located along the Volga delta at the northwestern corner of the [[Caspian Sea]]. Following the defeat of the [[Khazars]] in the [[Second Arab-Khazar War]], Atil became the capital of Khazaria. The city is referred to as [[Khamlij]] in 9th-century Arab sources, and the name Atil appears in the 10th century. At its height, the city was a major center of trade, and consisted of three parts separated by the Volga. The western part contained the administrative center of the city, with a court house and a large military garrison. The eastern part of the city was built later and acted as the commercial center of the Atil, and had many public baths and shops. Between them was an island on which stood the palaces of the Khazar [[Khagan]] and [[Khagan Bek|Bek]]. The island was connected to one of the other parts of the city by a pontoon bridge. According to Arab sources, one half of the city was referred to as Atil, while the other was named [[Khazaran]].

Atil was a multi-ethnic and religiously diverse city, inhabited by [[Jew]]s, [[Christianity|Christians]], [[Islam|Muslims]], [[Shamanism|Shamanists]], and [[Paganism|Pagans]], many of them traders from foreign countries. All of the religious groups had their own places of worship in the city, and there were seven judges appointed to settle disputes (two Christian, two Jewish, and two Muslim judges, with a single judge for all of the Shamanists and other Pagans).

[[Svyatoslav I of Kiev]] sacked Atil in 968 or 969 CE. [[Ibn Hawqal]] and [[al-Muqaddasi]] refer to Atil after 969, indicating that it may have been rebuilt. [[Al-Biruni]] (mid-11th century) reported that Atil was again in ruins, and did not mention the later city of [[Saqsin]] which was built nearby, so it is possible that this new Atil was only destroyed in the middle of the 11th century.

==Alleged site==

The archaeological remains of Atil have never been positively identified. It has been hypothesized that they were washed away by the rising level of the [[Caspian Sea]]. However, beginning in 2003 Dmitri Vasilyev of [[Astrakhan State University]] led a series of excavations at the Samosdelskoye site near the village of [[Samosdelka]] (Russian: Самосделка) in the Volga Delta. Vasilyev connected artifacts from the site with Khazar, Oghuz and Bulgar culture, leading him to believe that he had discovered the site of Saqsin. The matter is still unresolved. In 2006 Vasilyev announced his belief that the lowest stratum at the Samosdelka site was identical with the site of Atil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =  Vasilyev | first =  D.| title = Итиль-мечта (The Itil Dream) | url = http://www.lechaim.ru/ARHIV/174/VZR/a02.htm | accessdate = 2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, this team of Russian archaeologists announced that they had discovered the ruins of Atil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mirovalev |first=Mansur |title=Scholar claims to find medieval Jewish capital |work=Yahoo News |publisher=Associated Press |date=2008-09-20 |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080920/ap_on_re_eu/russia_lost_capital |accessdate=2008-09-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927200637/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080920/ap_on_re_eu/russia_lost_capital |archivedate=27 September 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paella''' ({{IPAc-en|p|aɪ|ˈ|ɛ|l|ə}} {{respell|py|EL|ə}},{{refn|{{OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=22 January 2016|paella}}}} {{IPA-va|paˈeʎa|lang}}, {{IPA-es|paˈeʎa|lang}}) is a Spanish rice dish originally from [[Valencian Community|Valencia]].

Paella is one of the best-known dishes in [[Spanish cuisine]]. For this reason, many non-Spaniards view it as Spain's [[national dish]], but Spaniards almost unanimously consider it to be a dish from the [[Valencian community|Valencian region]]. Valencians, in turn, regard ''paella'' as one of their identifying symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.comunitatvalenciana.com/taxonomy/term/25458|title=Paella, on the way to becoming a World Heritage Site|publisher=[[Generalitat Valenciana]]|access-date=19 February 2020|quote=''For the Region of Valencia, paella is much more than a recipe, it is a ritual and an icon of our culture.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news|newspaper=Diario16|url=http://mediterraneo.diario16.com/la-paella-valenciana-quiere-patrimonio-la-humanidad|last=Panadero |first=Amparo |date=11 March 2019|title=La paella valenciana quiere ser Patrimonio de la Humanidad|access-date=19 February 2020|language=es|quote=''En el caso de la paella valenciana, se trata de una tradición culinaria y social que constituye un icono de hospitalidad y un símbolo de unión e identidad valencianas ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Paella'' takes its name from the wide, shallow traditional pan used to cook the dish on an open fire. ''Paella'' means &quot;frying pan&quot; in [[Valencian]], Valencia's regional language.

As a dish, it may have ancient roots, but in its modern form it is traced back to the mid-19th century, in the rural area around the [[Albufera]] lagoon adjacent to the city of [[Valencia]], on the east coast of Spain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Info about Paella on About.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spanishfood.about.com/od/maincourses/a/paella.htm |title=Info about Paella on About.com |publisher=Spanishfood.about.com |date=15 December 2009 |access-date=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Paella valenciana''''' is the traditional paella of the [[Valencia Region|Valencia region]], believed to be the original recipe,&lt;ref name=&quot;Saveur&quot;&gt;[http://www.saveur.com/article/Kitchen/The-Art-of-Paella Saveur, &quot;The Art of Paella&quot;] (accessed 21 July 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; and consists of round grain rice&lt;ref name=&quot;paellarecipes&quot;&gt;[https://paellarecipes.top/paella-rice/ Paella Rice] (accessed 12 April 2020)&lt;/ref&gt;, ''bajoqueta'' and ''tavella'' (varieties of ''[[green bean]]s''), rabbit, chicken, sometimes duck, ''garrofó'' (a variety of [[Lima bean|lima or butter bean]])&lt;ref&gt;[[Phaseolus lunatus]] L. var. macrocarpus Benth.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.la-bible-de-la-paella.fr/the-authentic-paella/official-ingredients-of-the-authentic-paella/the-garrofon/|access-date=5 September 2018|title=La Bible de la Paella: The Garrofon}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Artichoke]] hearts and stems may be used as seasonal ingredients. Olive oil is used as a base, while [[saffron]] and (sometimes) whole [[Rosmarinus officinalis|rosemary]] branches are used as seasoning.

'''''Paella de marisco''''' (seafood ''paella'') replaces meat with [[seafood]] and omits beans and green vegetables, while '''''paella mixta''''' (mixed ''paella'') combines meat from [[livestock]], [[seafood]], [[vegetables]], and sometimes [[beans]], with the traditional rice.

Other popular local variations of ''paella'' are cooked all through the Mediterranean area, the rest of Spain and internationally.

== History ==

=== Possible origins ===
[[File:Bomba-Rice.jpg|right|thumb|Raw bomba rice]]
[[Moors]] in [[Al-Andalus|Muslim Spain]] began rice cultivation around the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=Watson|author=Watson, Andrew |year=1983|title=Agricultural innovation in the early Islamic world|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-06883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, eastern [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian Península]] locals often made [[casserole]]s of rice, fish, and spices for family gatherings and [[religious feast]]s, thus establishing the custom of eating rice in Spain. This led to rice becoming a staple by the 15th century. Afterwards, it became customary for cooks to combine rice with vegetables, beans, and dry [[cod]], providing an acceptable meal for [[Lent]]. Along Spain's eastern coast, rice was predominantly eaten with fish.&lt;ref name=&quot;foodtimeline.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |work=[[The Food Timeline]] |first=Lynne |last=Olver |author-link=Lynne Olver |url=http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodfaq6.html#paella |title=The Food Timeline presents a history of paella |date=16 September 2009 |access-date=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaine1989&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Jaine|title=The Cooking Pot: Proceedings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-SSnkfrLCkC&amp;pg=PA104|year=1989|publisher=Oxford Symposium|isbn=978-0-907325-42-0|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish [[food historian]] Lourdes March notes that the dish &quot;symbolizes the union and heritage of two important cultures, the [[Roman Empire|Roman]], which gives us the utensil and the [[Arab world|Arab]] which brought us the basic food of humanity for centuries.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first =Lourdes| last =March| chapter =Paella| pages =[https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00davi_0/page/566 566–567]| title =The Oxford Companion to Food| editor-first =Alan| editor-last =Davidson| location =Oxford| publisher =Oxford University Press| year =1999| isbn =0-19-211579-0| ref =none| chapter-url =https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00davi_0/page/566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming, etymology and ''paellera''===
''Paella'' is a Valencian word that means frying pan.&lt;ref name=&quot;MerriamWebster2020&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/paella|title=Merriam Webster's definition and etymology of the word paella|access-date=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AVL2020&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.avl.gva.es/lexicval/?paraula=paella|title=Diccionari normatiu valencià|website=www.avl.gva.es|access-date=2019-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RAE2020&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dle.rae.es/?w=paella|title=Diccionario de la Real Academia Española's (DRAE) definition and etymology of Paella|access-date=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dish gets its name from it.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVL2020&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RAE2020&quot; /&gt; Valencian speakers use the word ''paella'' for all pans, including the traditional shallow pan used for cooking the [[homonym]] dish.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAE2020&quot; /&gt; The pan is made out of polished or coated steel with two side handles.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lapaella.net/recipiente/|title=El recipiente|publisher=Lapaella.net|access-date=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

In many regions of [[Spain]] and other [[Spanish-speaking countries]], the term ''paellera'' may be used for the traditional pan, while ''paella'' is reserved for the rice dish prepared in it. Both ''paella'' and ''paellera'' are correct terms for the pan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&amp;LEMA=paellera The Royal Spanish Academy's definition of '&amp;#x27;paellera'&amp;#x27;]. Buscon.rae.es. Retrieved on 5 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the etymologist [[Joan Coromines]], the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] word ''paella'' should derive from the [[Old French]] word ''paelle'' for [[frying pan]], which in turn comes from the [[Latin]] word ''patella'' for pan; he thinks that otherwise the word should be ''padella'', as inter-vowel -d- dropping is not typical of Old Catalan. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite encyclopedia |last=Coromines|first=Joan |author-link=Joan Coromines|title=Diccionario crítico etimológico castellano e hispánico|language= es|year=1991–1997|publisher= Gredos|location=Madrid|volume=4|isbn=978-84-249-0066-3|at=entry ''paila''|quote=En catalán, paralelamente al castellano, el vocablo existe en dos formas, autóctona y tomada del francés: la primera, ''padella'', se oye todavia en los Pirineos (desde S. Juan de las Abadesas hasta el Alto Pallars y Ribagorza); la segunda, ''paella'' 'sartén', fué adaptada aqui a la terminación autóctona -ella, pero muestra su procedencia forastera en la caída de la -d-: &lt;sup&gt;[see note]&lt;/sup&gt; es ya antigua [fin S. XIV, Eiximenis, N. Cl. VI, 26] y hoy está casi generalizada; de ahí se tomó el cast. ''paella'' [Acad. 1914 o 1899], especializado en el sentido de 'arroz a la valenciana', así llamado porque se hace en una sartén mas o menos grande. [...] [note] Es inadmisible la explicación que se le ha dado alguna vez como forma dialectal valenciana, pues tal fenómeno fonético es muy moderno en Valencia.}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''paella'' is also related to ''[[paila]]'' used in many [[Latin America]]n countries. ''Paila'' in [[Spanish dialects and varieties|Latin American Spanish]] refers to a variety of cookware resembling metal and [[clay]] pans, which are also used for both cooking and serving.

The Latin root ''patella'' from which ''paella'' derives is also akin to the [[French language|modern French]] ''poêle'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.littre.org/definition/po%C3%AAle.3 Origin of '&amp;#x27;poêle'&amp;#39]. Littre.org. Retrieved on 5 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; the Italian ''padella,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etimo.it/?term=padella|title=Etimologia : padella;|work=etimo.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Old Spanish language|Old Spanish]] ''padilla''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spanishdict.com/translate/padilla#|title=Meaning of the Spanish word ''padilla''|publisher=Spanishdict.com|access-date=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim that the word ''paella'' comes from the [[Arabic]] {{Lang|ar|بَقَايَا}}, pronounced ''baqaayya'', meaning &quot;leftovers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=حكاية طبق - باإييلا / إسبانيا|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSDSjOeDqVY|language=en|access-date=2019-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim is based on the 8th-century custom in which [[Moorish]] kings' servants would take home the rice, chicken, and vegetables their employers left at the end of the meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DX1NBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192|title=Vibrant Andalusia: The Spice of Life in Southern Spain|last=Ruiz|first=Ana|date=2007|publisher=Algora Publishing|isbn=9780875865409|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hHNS0NAK33AC&amp;pg=PT51|title=Andalus: Unlocking The Secrets Of Moorish Spain|last=Webster|first=Jason|date=2010-08-03|publisher=Transworld|isbn=9781407094816|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YD0hBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT62|title=Arab Women in the Middle Ages: Private Lives and Public Roles|last=Guthrie|first=Shirley|date=2013-08-01|publisher=Saqi|isbn=9780863567643|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mB6aKnaqChMC&amp;pg=PA26|title=Late Dinner: Discovering the Food of Spain|last=Richardson|first=Paul|date=2007-08-21|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781416545392|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said, however, that a problem with this etymology is that the word ''paella'' is not attested until six centuries after Moorish Valencia was conquered by [[Jaume I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.raco.cat/index.php/RevistaEtnologia/article/download/81655/106249|title=Els espais socials de la paella: antropologia d'un plat camaleònic|last1=Duhart|first1=Frédéric|last2=Medina|first2=F. Xavier|publisher=Revista d'etnologia de Catalunya|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Paella Valenciana''===
Originally, paella made in Valencia was a lunchtime meal for farmers and farm laborers. Workers would gather what was available to them around the rice fields. This often included tomatoes, onions, and snails. Rabbit or duck was a common addition, or chicken less often.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History and Origins of Paella |url=https://www.thepaellacompany.co.uk/history.html |website=The Paella Company |access-date=16 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On special occasions, 18th century Valencians used ''calderos'' to cook the rice in the open air of their orchards near lake [[Albufera]]. [[Arvicola sapidus|Water vole]] meat was one of the main ingredients of early paellas,&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Vázquez Montalbán, ''La cocina de los mediterráneos'', Ediciones B – Mexico&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[eel]] and [[White beans|butter beans]]. Novelist [[Vicente Blasco Ibáñez]] described the Valencia custom of eating [[European water vole|water voles]] in ''Cañas y Barro'' (1902), a realistic novel about life among the fishermen and peasants near lake Albufera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucm.es/info/especulo/numero31/viblasco.html |title=César Besó Portalés, ''Vicente Blasco Ibáñez y el Naturalismo'', I.E.S. Clara Campoamor, Alaquás (Valencia) |publisher=Ucm.es |access-date=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Living standards rose with the sociological changes of the late 19th century in Spain, giving rise to gatherings and outings in the countryside. This led to a change in paella's ingredients, as well, using instead rabbit, chicken, duck and sometimes snails. This dish became so popular that in 1840, a local Spanish newspaper first used the word ''paella'' to refer to the recipe rather than the pan.&lt;ref name=&quot;foodtimeline.org&quot; /&gt;

The most widely used, complete ingredient list of this era was: short-grain white rice, chicken, rabbit, snails (optional), duck (optional), [[White beans|butter beans]], [[White beans|great northern beans]], [[runner beans]], [[artichoke]] (a substitute for runner beans in the winter), [[tomato]]es, fresh rosemary, sweet [[paprika]], [[saffron]], [[garlic]] (optional), salt, olive oil, and water.&lt;ref name=&quot;foodtimeline.org&quot; /&gt; Poorer Valencians, however, sometimes used nothing more than snails for meat. Valencians insist that only these ingredients should go into making modern ''paella valenciana''.

=== Seafood and mixed ''paella''===
On the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast, Valencians used seafood instead of meat and beans to make paella. Valencians regard this recipe as authentic, as well. In this recipe, the seafood is served in the shell. A variant of this is ''paella del senyoret'' which uses seafood without shells. Later, however, Spaniards living outside of Valencia combined seafood with meat from land animals and mixed ''paella'' was born.&lt;ref name=&quot;arrozsos.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Tu nombre |url=http://www.arrozsos.com/articulos/ver/historia_de_la_paella |title=Arroz SOS presents a history of paella |publisher=Arrozsos.com |access-date=19 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125102334/http://www.arrozsos.com/Articulos/ver/historia_de_la_paella |archive-date=25 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ''paella'' is sometimes called ''preparación barroca'' (baroque preparation) due to the variety of ingredients and its final presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nuestras Paellas|url=http://www.pacharan.com.uy/platos/paellas/|website=Pacharán|access-date=2 September 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151116111929/http://www.pacharan.com.uy/platos/paellas/|archive-date=16 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 20th century, paella's popularity spread past Spain's borders. As other cultures set out to make paella, the dish invariably acquired regional influences. Consequently, ''paella'' recipes went from being relatively simple to including a wide variety of seafood, meat, sausage (including [[chorizo]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oprah.com/food/Paella Mario Batali's version of mixed paella with chorizo] Oprah.com: Retrieved 30 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Recipe courtesy Tyler Florence |url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/tyler-florence/paella-with-seafood-chicken-and-chorizo-recipe/index.html |title=Foodnetwork's paella recipe with seafood, chicken and chorizo |publisher=Foodnetwork.com |access-date=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; vegetables and many different seasonings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spain-recipes.com/paellarecipes.html |title=An assortment of paella recipes |publisher=Spain-recipes.com |access-date=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the most globally popular recipe is seafood paella.

Throughout non-Valencia Spain, mixed ''paella'' is relatively easy to find. Some restaurants both in Spain and abroad that serve this mixed version refer to it as ''Paella valenciana''. However, Valencians insist that only the original two Valencia recipes are authentic, and generally view all others as inferior, not genuine or even grotesque.&lt;ref name=&quot;arrozsos.com&quot; /&gt;[[File:Paella hirviendo.jpg|thumb|Traditional preparation of paella]]

According to tradition in [[Valencia]], ''paella'' is cooked over an open fire, fueled by orange and pine branches along with pine cones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/restaurants/quique-dacosta-arros-qd-restaurant-london-a4160206.html|title=Arros QD's Quique Dacosta on why paella will be the dish of the summer|date=2019-06-05|website=Evening Standard|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This produces an aromatic smoke which infuses the ''paella''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/features/michelin-starred-chef-quique-dacosta-make-ultimate-paella/|title=Michelin-starred chef Quique Dacosta on how to make the ultimate paella|last=Curtis|first=Nick|date=2019-06-02|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2019-12-18|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, dining guests traditionally eat directly out of the pan instead of serving in plates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Info about Paella on About.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;foodtimeline.org&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;arrozsos.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;paellarecipes.top&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://paellarecipes.top/paella-valenciana-recipe/ |title=Authentic Paella Valenciana as it is made in Valencia |publisher=paellarecipes.top |access-date=23 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some recipes call for ''paella'' to be covered and left to settle for five to ten minutes after cooking.

After cooking ''paella'', there may be a layer of roasted rice at the bottom of the pan, called ''socarrat'' in [[Valencian|Valencià]]. The layer develops on its own if the ''paella'' is cooked over a burner or open fire. This is traditionally considered positive (as long as it is not scorched) and [[Valencia]] natives enjoy eating it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/dbf555ec-b7da-11e9-96bd-8e884d3ea203|title=My kitchen essential: I'd be lost without . . . my paella pan|last=Dacosta|first=Quique|date=2019-08-06|website=www.ft.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Arroz a la valenciana'' (Spanish) or ''Arroz à valenciana'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) is considered as a part of [[Cuisine of the Philippines|Philippine cuisine]]. It is considered as the Philippine version of [[paella]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.saveur.com/philippine-seafood-paella-recipe/&lt;/ref&gt;

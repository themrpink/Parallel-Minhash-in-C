[[File:St Phillips Church, Tortola.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The ruins of [[St Phillip's Church, Tortola]], one of the most important historical ruins in the Territory.]]

The '''History of the British Virgin Islands''' is usually, for convenience, broken up into five separate periods:
* Pre-Columbian Amerindian settlement, up to an uncertain date
* Nascent European settlement, from approximately 1612 until 1672
* British control, from 1672 until 1834
* Emancipation, from 1834 until 1950
* The modern state, from 1950 to present day

These time periods are used for convenience only. There appears to be an uncertain period of time from when the last [[Arawaks|Arawak]] left what would later be called the [[British Virgin Islands]] until the first Europeans started to settle there in the early 17th century, when records of any settlement are unclear. Each of the above periods is marked by a dramatic change from the preceding time period, providing a way to define the history.

==Pre-Columbian settlement==
The first recorded settlement of the Territory was by Arawak Indians who came from [[South America]], in around 100 BC.  Vernon Pickering places the date later, at around 200 AD, and suggests that the Arawak may have been preceded by the [[Ciboney]] Indians. They are thought to have settled in nearby [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] as early as 300 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon Pickering, ''A Concise History of the British Virgin Islands'', page 6&lt;/ref&gt;  There is some evidence of [[Amerindian]] presence on the islands. perhaps in seasonal fishing camps, as far back as 1500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dg.ian.com/index.jsp?cid=54918&amp;action=viewLocation&amp;formId=105392]&lt;/ref&gt; There is little academic support for the idea of a permanent settlement on any of the current British Virgin Islands at that time.

The Arawak inhabited the islands until the 15th century, when they were displaced by the more aggressive [[Island Caribs|Caribs]], a tribe from the [[Lesser Antilles]] islands. The [[Caribbean Sea]] is named for these people.

None of the later European visitors to the Virgin Islands reported encountering Amerindians in what would later be the British Virgin Islands. [[Christopher Columbus]] did have a hostile encounter with the Carib natives of [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Croix]].

Comparatively little is known about the early inhabitants of this territory specifically (as opposed to the Arawak generally).  The largest excavations of Arawak pottery have been found around Belmont and Smuggler's Cove on the northwest of [[Tortola]]. Many other archeological sites have been found with Arawak artifacts, including at Soper's Hole, Apple Bay, Coxheath, Pockwood Pond, Pleasant Valley, Sage Mountain, Russell Hill (modern day [[Road Town]]), Pasea, Purcell, Paraquita Bay, Josiah's Bay, Mount Healthy and Cane Garden Bay.  Modern archaeological excavations regularly cause local historians to revise what they thought they knew about these early settlers.  Discoveries reported in the local newspapers in 2006 have indicated that early Arawak settlement of the islands may have been more significant than had earlier been thought.&lt;!--Expand - number? time?--&gt;{{cite web

==1492: Early European exploration==
The first European sighting of the Virgin Islands was by [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1493 on his second voyage to the Americas. Columbus gave them the name ''Santa Ursula y las Once Mil Vírgenes'' (Saint Ursula and her 11,000 Virgins), shortened to ''Las Vírgenes'' (The Virgins), after the legend of [[Saint Ursula]]. He is also reported to have personally named [[Virgin Gorda]] (the Fat Virgin), which he thought to be the largest island in the group.

The Spanish claimed the islands by original discovery, but never settled the Territory.  In 1508, [[Juan Ponce de León II|Juan Ponce de León]] settled [[Puerto Rico]], and reports in Spanish journals suggested that the settlement used the Virgin Islands for fishing, but nothing else.  Their references may have been to the present [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]], which are closer.&lt;ref&gt;To sail from Puerto Rico to Tortola requires sailing against the prevailing wind for approximately 70 miles. In the vessels of the day, which did not sail well upwind, this would have been a trip of 2 or 3 days.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1517, [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]] and [[Thomas Spert]] visited the islands on their return from exploring Brazilian waters. [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|Sir John Hawkins]] visited the islands three times, firstly in 1542 and then again in 1563 with a cargo of [[slave]]s bound for [[Hispaniola]].  On his third visit, he was accompanied by a young captain by the name of [[Francis Drake]] in the ''Judith''.

[[File:Francis Drake, por un artista anónimo.jpg|thumb|left|Sir Francis Drake visited the islands four times; its main channel was named in his honor]]
Drake returned in 1585, and is reported to have anchored in North Sound on Virgin Gorda prior to his tactically brilliant attack on [[Santo Domingo]].  Drake returned for the final time in 1595 on his last voyage, during which he died. The main channel in the British Virgin Islands was named in his honor.

In 1598, [[George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland]], is reported to have used the islands as a staging ground for his later attack on [[La Fortaleza]] in Puerto Rico, during conflicts between England and Spain.

English (and Scottish) King [[James I of England|James I]] granted a patent to [[James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle]], for [[Tortola]], as well as &quot;[[Anguilla|Angilla]], Semrera ([[Sombrero, Anguilla|Sombrero island]]) &amp; [[Anegada|Enegada]]&quot;.  Carlisle also received letters of patent for [[Barbados]], [[Saint Kitts|St. Kitts]] and &quot;all the Caribees&quot; in 1627 (the &quot;[[Carlisle proprietorship]]&quot;).  He died shortly after, but his son, the 2nd Earl of Carlisle, leased the patents to [[Montagu Bertie, 2nd Earl of Lindsey|Lord Willoughby]] for 21 years in 1647.  Neither ever attempted to settle the northern islands.

===First Dutch settlements===
{{Main|Dutch Virgin Islands}}
Dutch [[privateer]] [[Joost van Dyk]] organized the first permanent settlements in the Territory in Soper's Hole, on the west end of Tortola.  By 1615, van Dyk's settlement was recorded in Spanish contemporary records, which noted its recent expansion. He traded with Spanish colonists in [[Puerto Rico]] and farmed cotton and tobacco.

Some sources suggest that the first settlements in the Virgin Islands were by the Spanish, who mined copper at the [[Copper Mine, Virgin Gorda|copper mine on Virgin Gorda]]. No archaeological evidence supports any settlement by the Spanish in the islands at any time, nor any mining of copper on Virgin Gorda prior to the 19th century.{{cite web
 |url=http://www.bvi.gov.vg/content/our-history
 |title=Our History
 |website=Government of the Virgin Islands
 |access-date=8 Jan 2020}}

By 1625, van Dyk was recognized by the [[Dutch West India Company]] as the private &quot;Patron&quot; of Tortola, and had moved his operations to [[Road Town]]. During the same year, van Dyk lent some limited (non-military) support to the Dutch admiral [[Boudewijn Hendricksz]], who sacked [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].  In September 1625, in retaliation, the Spanish led a full assault on the island of Tortola, laying waste to its defenses and destroying its embryonic settlements.  Joost van Dyk escaped to the island that would later [[Jost Van Dyke|bear his name]], and sheltered there from the Spanish.  He later moved to the island of [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] until the Spanish gave up and returned to Puerto Rico.

Notwithstanding Spanish hostility, the [[Dutch West India Company]] considered the Virgin Islands to have an important strategic value, as they were located approximately halfway between the Dutch colonies in [[South America]] (now [[Suriname]]) and the most important Dutch settlement in [[North America]], [[New Amsterdam]] (now [[New York City]]).  The Dutch built large stone warehouses at Freebottom, near Port Purcell (just east of Road Town), to facilitate exchanges of cargo between North and South America.

[[File:Fort Charlotte, Tortola 01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The remains of Fort Charlotte, built on an earlier lookout post erected by the Dutch]]

At this time, the Dutch settlers erected some small earthworks and a three-[[cannon]] [[fort]] above the warehouse, on the hill. This was the site where the English later built [[Fort George, Tortola|Fort George]]. The Dutch also constructed a wooden stockade for a lookout post above Road Town. This site was later developed as [[Fort Charlotte, Tortola|Fort Charlotte]].  They stationed troops at the Spanish &quot;dojon&quot; near Pockwood Pond, later to be known as [[Fort Purcell]]. In the 21st century, it is usually called &quot;the Dungeon&quot;.

In 1631, the Dutch West India Company expressed an interest in the rumors of copper on [[Virgin Gorda]],{{cite web
 |url=http://www.bvi.gov.vg/content/our-history
 |title=Our History
 |website=Government of the Virgin Islands
 |access-date=8 Jan 2020}} and a settlement was set up on that island, which came to be known as &quot;Little Dyk's&quot; (now known as Little Dix).

In 1640, Spain attacked Tortola in an assault led by Captain Lopez.  The Spanish attacked again in 1646 and 1647, led by Captain Francisco Vincente Duran.  The Spanish anchored a warship in Soper's Hole at West End and landed men ashore.  They sent another warship to blockade Road Harbour.  After a team of scouts returned a safe report, the Spanish landed more men and attacked Fort Purcell overland by foot.  They massacred the Dutch, and next attacked Road Town, killing all inhabitants and destroying the settlement. They did not bother with the smaller settlements further up the coast in Baugher's Bay or on Virgin Gorda.

===Decline of the Dutch West India Company===
The Dutch settlements did not return a profit. Evidence suggests that the Dutch spent most of their time more profitably engaged in privateering than trading.  The lack of prosperity of the territory mirrored the [[Dutch West India Company#Decline|lack of commercial success]] of first the Dutch West India Company as a whole.

The company changed its policy. It sought to cede islands such as Tortola and Virgin Gorda to private persons for settlement, and to establish major [[slave]] pens to support the slave trade in the Caribbean, as they were importing slaves from Africa.  The island of Tortola was sold to [[Willem Hunthum]] at some point in the 1650s, at which time the Dutch West India Company's interest in the Territory effectively ended.{{cite web

 |title=Our History

 |access-date=8 Jan 2020}}

In 1665, the Dutch settlers on Tortola were attacked by a British privateer, John Wentworth; he captured 67 slaves and took them to [[Bermuda]].{{cite web
 |url=http://www.bvi.gov.vg/content/our-history
 |title=Our History
 |website=Government of the Virgin Islands
 |access-date=8 Jan 2020}}  The record of his prize is the first documentation of slaves being held in the Territory.

In 1666, a number of the Dutch settlers were reported to have been driven out by an influx of British &quot;brigands and pirates&quot;, although numerous Dutch remained.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon Pickering, ''A Concise History of the British Virgin Islands'', page 23&lt;/ref&gt;

==1672: British colonisation==
{{Main|British West Indies|British Leeward Islands}}
England took control of the British Virgin Islands in 1672, at the outbreak of the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]], and have retained influence since. The Dutch averred that in 1672 Willem Hunthum put Tortola under the protection of Colonel Sir [[William Stapleton (governor)|William Stapleton]], the English [[Governor-General]] of the [[Leeward Islands]].  Stapleton reported that he had &quot;captured&quot; the Territory shortly after the outbreak of war.{{cite web
 |url=http://www.bvi.gov.vg/content/our-history
 |title=Our History
 |website=Government of the Virgin Islands
 |access-date=8 Jan 2020}}

Colonel William Burt was dispatched to Tortola and took control of the island no later than 13 July 1672 (when Stapleton reported the conquest to the Council of Trade).  Burt did not have sufficient men to occupy the Territory, but before leaving the island, he destroyed the Dutch forts and removed all their cannon to [[Saint Kitts|St. Kitts]].

By the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster of 1674]], the war was ended, and provision was made for mutual restoration of all territorial conquests during the war.  The Treaty provided the Dutch with the right to resume possession of the islands, but by then the Dutch were at war with the French, and fear of a French attack prevented their immediate restoration.  Although the possessions were not considered valuable, for strategic reasons the British became reluctant to surrender them, and after prolonged discussions, orders were issued to Stapleton in June 1677 to retain possession of Tortola and the surrounding islands.

In 1678, the [[Franco-Dutch War]] ended, and the Dutch returned their attention to Tortola, although it was not until 1684 that the Dutch ambassador, Arnout van Citters, formally requested the return of Tortola.  However, he did not do so on the basis of the Treaty of Westminster, but instead based the claim on the private rights of the widow of Willem Hunthum.  He asserted that the island was not a conquest, but had been entrusted to the British.  The ambassador provided a letter from Stapleton promising to return the island.&lt;ref&gt;Part of the dis-communication that arose between the British and Dutch related to the fundamental conceptual differences between the treatment of colonies; the British viewed colonies as belonging to the Crown, and settled with its permission; the Dutch viewed colonies as belonging to the individuals, with the benefit of the Crown's protection.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time (1686), Stapleton had completed his term of office and was ''en route'' back to Britain.  The Dutch were told Stapleton would be asked to explain the discrepancy between his assertion of having conquered the island, and the correspondence signed by him indicating a promise to return it, after which a decision would be made.  Unfortunately, Stapleton traveled first to France to recover his health, where he died.  Cognisant that other Caribbean territories which had been captured from the Dutch during the war had already been restored, in August 1686 the Dutch ambassador was advised by the British that Tortola would be restored, and instructions to that effect were sent to Sir [[Nathaniel Johnson (politician)|Nathaniel Johnson]], the new Governor of the Leeward Islands.

But Tortola was never actually returned to the Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;The correspondence all refers solely to Tortola, which appears to be the limits of the Territory that the Dutch claimed.  However, the British subsequently asserted control over the entire island group.&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of the problem was that Johnson's orders were to restore the island to such person or persons who have &quot;sufficient procuration or authority to receive the same...&quot;  However, most of the former Dutch colonists had now departed, having lost hope of restoration.  Certainly there was no official representation of the Dutch monarchy or any other organ of government.  In the event, Johnson did nothing.

In November 1696, a subsequent claim was made to the island by Sir Peter van Bell, the agent of Sir Joseph Shepheard, a [[Rotterdam]] merchant, who claimed to have purchased Tortola on 21 June 1695, for 3,500 [[Dutch gulden|guilder]]s.  Shepheard was from the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], and the prospect of Tortola coming under Brandenburger control did not sit well in [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]].&lt;ref&gt;This was largely a reaction to Brandenburger activities in relation to trade between Britain and the Dutch Republic in Europe at the time.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Brandenburg claim was dismissed by the British on the grounds that Stapleton had conquered rather than been entrusted with Tortola.  The now common delaying tactic of forwarding all correspondence to Governor Codrington for comment was employed.  Codrington readily appreciated the risks of a Brandenburg trading outpost on Tortola, as such an outpost already existed on nearby St. Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;Codrington even suggested that van Bell's actual claim appeared to relate to the St. Thomas outpost and not Tortola at all; whether a ruse or a ''bona fide'' interpretation, merely making such a comment would involve 6 months in returns of correspondence by sailing vessel across the Atlantic.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Brandenburgers had previously set up an outpost for trading slaves on Peter Island in 1690, which they had abandoned, and they were not considered welcome.  At the time they had an outpost on St. Thomas, but they engaged in no agriculture, and only participated in the trading of slaves.  Negotiations became more intense, and the British re-asserted the right of conquest and also (wrongly, but apparently honestly) claimed to have first discovered Tortola.  During the negotiations, the British also became aware of two older historical claims, the 1628 patent granted to the Earl of Carlisle (which was inconsistent with Hunthum's title being sold to him by the Dutch West India company), and an order of the King in 1694 to prevent foreign settlement in the Virgin Islands.  In February 1698, Codrington was told to regard the earlier 1694 orders as final, and the British entertained no further claims to the islands.

===Geographical limits of the territory===
[[File:Trunk Bay in St. John.jpg|thumb|right|300px|St. John, claimed by the British but never settled. They effectively abandoned their claim to the island in 1718.]]
Although the islands which presently form the British Virgin Islands have been under British control since 1672, a number of other islands came under the control of the British Crown (some more than once) during the subsequent period, but no longer form part of the Territory.  At the time the British took control of the territory, the following islands were considered part of the Virgin Islands.&lt;ref&gt;The prefix &quot;British&quot; to describe the British Virgin Islands only began to be used in the 1940s as a response to the U.S.A. renaming the Danish Antilles the &quot;U.S. Virgin Islands&quot;.  Legally, the name of the Territory is still the &quot;Virgin Islands&quot; ''simpliciter''.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]]'''.  The British initially claimed St. Thomas (and St. John as well), but in 1717, the Danish disputed their claim to those islands.  In contrast to the long dispute over ownership of Tortola, the dispute over St. Thomas was settled readily with a year.  The Danish claim was strong; they had the benefit of the Treaty of Alliance and Commerce of 1670 between Britain and Denmark, which led to the founding of the [[Danish West India Company]] in 1671 which its charter permitted it to take possession of and occupy the two islands.  On 25 May 1672, the Danes took possession of St. Thomas, and discovered it to have been abandoned by the British settlers some weeks earlier.  The British could scarcely object to the Danes retaining the island.
* '''[[Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. John]]'''.  However, no sooner than the dispute over St. Thomas settled, than acrimony flared up again over St. John, when the Danes purported to settle it on 23 March 1718.  The reaction of [[Walter Hamilton (governor)|Walter Hamilton]], Governor of the Leeward Islands, was immediate.  He dispatched [[HMS Scarborough (1711)|HMS ''Scarborough'']] to the island.  A period of fraught negotiations followed, but ultimately the Danes refused to quit St. John, and the British declined to use force to seize it.  Truthfully, the British were less concerned about St. John than about St. Croix, which they thought that the Danes would eventually covet as well.
* '''[[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Croix]]''' (or ''St. Cruz'', as it was known at the time).  The British fears proved to be well founded.  In 1729, a claim was made to St. Croix by the Danes who (in an ironic twist) claimed it had been sold to them by the French.  St. Croix had been settled at an uncertain point over a century before by settlers from a number of different European nations, but in 1645 violence had flared up between them, and the English governor was [[murder]]ed.  The English summarily expelled the Dutch, and the French, at their own request, were removed to [[Guadeloupe]], leaving the British in sole control of the island.  But in 1650, the Spanish invaded from Puerto Rico and the British surrendered the island.  Later in the same year, the Dutch had sought to return to St. Croix, believing that the Spanish would by then have returned to Puerto Rico, but when they arrived the Spanish were still there, and the Dutch were all killed or captured.  The Governor General of the French Caribbean colonies then subsequently mounted an attack on the island at his own expense and drove out the Spanish, but he was unable to establish a colony, and surrendered the title to the island to the [[Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master of the Order of Malta]] in 1653.&lt;ref&gt;The transfer was confirmed by the French monarchy by letters patent.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1665, St. Croix reverted by purchase to the [[French West India Company]], and upon the Company's collapse in 1674, the King of France claimed it as part of his dominions, although the island was subsequently ordered to be abandoned as an economic failure - the date of abandoning would later be hotly disputed.  In May 1733, the French purported to sell the island to the Danish West India Company.  If the French had only abandoned it in 1695 (as they asserted), it was French at the time of the Treaty.  If the French had abandoned the island in 1671 (as the British claimed), then under the 1686 Treaty, St. Croix would be peaceably in British possession.  In the end, the French had documents to support their claim, and the British did not, and so the Council of Trade admitted that &quot;upon the whole we must submit... whether it may be proper to advise His Majesty to insist any longer upon a title so weakly supported.&quot;  The British thereafter ceased to resist the French sale of the island to the Danes.

Britain would actually conquer St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix in March 1801 through the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic wars]], but they restored them by the [[Treaty of Amiens]] in March 1802.  They were then re-taken in December 1807, but were restored again by the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris of 1815]].  Thereafter, they would remain under Danish control until 1917 when they were sold to the U.S.A. for US$25 million, and were later renamed the &quot;U.S. Virgin Islands&quot;.

*'''[[Vieques, Puerto Rico|Vieques]]''' (or ''Crab Island'', as the British referred to it).  Vieques was periodically settled by the British, but on each occasion they were driven off by Spanish soldiers from nearby Puerto Rico.  In the early 18th century, the Colonial authorities ordered the removal of British settlers on Vieques and re-settled them on [[Saint Kitts|St. Kitts]].  Ironically enough, a century later after emancipation a number of former slaves would go and seek work on Vieques as free men of colour, notwithstanding that Vieques was still a slave owning society.

Relationships with the Danes were strained from the outset.  The Danes continuously resorted to nearby islands for timber, clearly violating British sovereignty.  British ships which foundered in St. Thomas was subject to extortionate levy for [[Marine salvage#Ship salvage and the law|salvage]].  Further, St. Thomas became a base for pirates and privateers which the Danish Governor either could not or would not stop.  During the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] the Danes supported the French colonies, and allowed the French to sell British ships seized as [[prize (law)|prizes]] in [[Charlotte Amalie, United States Virgin Islands|Charlotte Amalie]].  No doubt the British invasions in the early 19th century did not help relations, and in later years smuggling and illegal sales of slaves by St. Thomians would frustrate British authorities.

===Law and order===

{{see also|Piracy in the British Virgin Islands}}

Even after British control of the Territory became complete, population infiltration was slow.  Settlers lived in fear of possible Spanish attack, and there was the constant possibility that diplomatic efforts might fail and the Territory might revert to an overseas power (as happened in St. Croix).  Spanish raids in 1685 and ongoing negotiations between the Dutch and the British over the fate of the islands led to them being virtually abandoned; from 1685 to 1690 the population of the Territory was reduced to two - a Mr Jonathan Turner and his wife.  In 1690, there was a relative explosion in the population, which had swollen to fourteen.  By 1696, it was up to fifty.

[[File:Old HM Prison, Road Town.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The old HM Prison in Road Town. Used up until 1996, it was built on the site of an earlier prison in the mid 19th century]]

From 1678, the British appointed a deputy-governor for the Territory (initially for the Territory and Saba and St. Eustatius, until the latter two islands were returned to the Dutch).  The role was somewhat vague, and had no legislative, executory or judicial powers attached to it.  The deputy-governor was encouraged to appoint a local governor beneath him, though it was common complaint being unable &quot;to gett one that's tolerable fitt amongst them to take the command upon them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Calendar of State Papers, America and the West Indies, 1716-1717, No. 350&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1709, Governor Parke observed that &quot;they live like wild people without law or Government, and have neither Divine nor Lawyer amongst them...&quot;

It was not until 1773 that the Virgin Islands actually had its own legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Prior to that laws were extended to the Territory by the legislature in Antigua.  Some of these laws are still in force in the British Virgin Islands, such as the Common Law (Declaration of Application) Act, 1705&lt;/ref&gt;  However early attempts to establish a legislature and organs of government in the Territory are [[House of Assembly of the British Virgin Islands#Colonial legislatures|mostly notable for their repeated failures]].  The uncertainty of tenure and slightly ambivalent official British attitude to the fate of the Territory influenced the early population - for many years only debtors from other islands, pirates and those fleeing the law were prepared to undertake the risk of settling in the Virgin Islands.  Most references to the islands from occasional visitors comment on the lack of law and order and the lack of religiosity of the inhabitants.

The Territory was granted a Legislative Assembly on 27 January 1774, however, it took a full further decade for a constitutional framework to be settled.  Part of the problem was that the islands were so thinly populated, it was almost impossible to constitute the organs of government.  In 1778, [[George Suckling]] arrived in the Territory to take up his position as Chief Justice of the Territory.  In the event, a court was not actually established until the Court Bill was passed in 1783, but even then the vested interests ensured that Suckling could still not take up his position, and the islands had a court but no judge.  Suckling finally left the islands without ever taking up his post (or ever being paid) on 2 May 1788, impoverished and embittered, due to the machinations of local interests which were fearful of the recourse of their creditors if a court was to be established.  Suckling was forthright in expressing his views on the state of law and order in the Territory - he described the residents of Tortola as &quot;in a state of lawless ferment.  Life, liberty, and property were hourly exposed to the insults and depredations of the riotous and lawless.  The authority of His Majesty's Council, as conservators of the peace, was defied and ridiculed...  The island presented a shocking state of anarchy; miserable indeed, and disgraceful to government, not to be equaled in any other of His Majesty's dominions, or perhaps in any civilized country in the world.&quot;

Almost 100 years after Governor Parke had expressed his views, one of his successors would speak in similar terms.  On his appointment in 1810, Governor [[Hugh Elliot]] remarked on &quot;the state of irritation, nay, I had almost said, of anarchy, in which I have found this Colony ...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;docId=CS51000556&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0 Some papers have just been printed by order of the House of Commons, consisting of a correspondence between Governor Elliott (sic) and the Earl of Liverpool], ''The Times'', London, 12 July 1811, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;  Writer Howard, an agent selling a distressed cargo of slaves from a shipwreck in Tortola in 1803 wrote that &quot;Tortola is well nigh the most miserable, worst-inhabited spot in all the British possessions... this unhealthy part of the globe appears overstocked with each description of people except honest ones.&quot;

===Quaker settlement===

Although short in both duration and number, the Quaker settlement in the British Virgin Islands from 1727 to 1768 played an important part in the history of the Territory for two reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/tortolaquakerexp00jenkuoft/tortolaquakerexp00jenkuoft_djvu.txt ''Tortola: a Quaker experiment of long ago in the tropics''], Charles F. Jenkins of Philadelphia, PA. London 1923&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, the trenchant opposition of the Quakers to slavery had a contributing effect to the improvements in the treatment of slaves within the Territory (the exceptional case of [[Arthur William Hodge]] notwithstanding) compared to other Caribbean islands, and to the large number of [[free people of color|free blacks]] within the islands.  Secondly, for such a small community, a large number of famous historical figures came from that small community, including [[John C. Lettsome]], [[William Thornton]], [[Samuel Nottingham]] and [[Richard Humphreys (philanthropist)|Richard Humphreys]]. There are some vague assertions that Arthur Penn, brother of the more famous [[William Penn]], also formed part of the Quaker community of the British Virgin Islands for a time.&lt;ref&gt;Florence Lewisohn, ''Tales of Tortola and the British Virgin Islands'', pages 40 and 41, although she cites no authority beyond local legend for the proposition,&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this seems unlikely as the dates of his lifetime do not fit easily within the time frame of the Quaker community in the British Virgin Islands, and as Quaker history is generally very well documented, it is unlikely that an expedition by a member of such a famous family would go unnoticed.

Between 1760 and 1800, the British significantly upgraded the defences of the Territory.  Usually building upon earlier Dutch fortifications, new structures armed with [[cannons]] were erected at [[Fort Charlotte, Tortola|Fort Charlotte]], [[Fort George, Tortola|Fort George]], [[Fort Burt]], [[Fort Recovery, Tortola|Fort Recovery]], and a new fort that was built in the centre of Road Town which came to be known as the [[Road Town Fort]].  As was common at the time, plantation owners were expected to fortify their own holdings, and [[Fort Purcell]] and [[Fort Hodge]] were erected on this basis.

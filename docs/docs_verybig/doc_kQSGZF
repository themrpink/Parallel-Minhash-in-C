==History==
{{further|History of water supply and sanitation}}

=== Ancient civilizations ===
Environmental engineering is a name for work that has been done since early civilizations, as people learned to modify and control the environmental conditions to meet needs.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.environmentalscience.org/environmental-engineering|title=Environmental Engineering: Why It's Vital for Our Future|last=Mason|first=Matthew|website=Environmental Science|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As people recognized that their health was related to the [[Environmental quality|quality of their environment]], they built systems to improve&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; it. The ancient [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley Civilization]] (3300 B.C.E. to 1300 B.C.E.) had advanced control over their [[water resources]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The public work structures found at various sites in the area include wells, public baths, water storage tanks, a drinking water system, and a city-wide sewage collection system.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jansen|first=M.|date=October 1989|title=Water Supply and Sewage Disposal at Mohenjo-Daro|journal=World Archaeology|volume=21|issue=2|pages=177–192|jstor=124907|doi=10.1080/00438243.1989.9980100|pmid=16470995}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also had an early canal [[Irrigation|irrigation system]] enabling large-scale agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Evolution of Sanitation and Wastewater Technologies through the Centuries|last=Angelakis|first=Andreas N.|last2=Rose|first2=Joan B.|publisher=IWA Publishing|year=2014|isbn=9781780404851|location=|pages=25–40|chapter=Chapter 2: &quot;Sanitation and wastewater technologies in Harappa/Indus valley civilization (ca. 2600-1900 BC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 4000 to 2000 B.C.E., many civilizations had drainage systems and some had sanitation facilities, including the [[Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian Empire]], [[Mohenjo-daro|Mohenjo-Daro]], Egypt, Crete, and the [[Orkney|Orkney Islands]] in Scotland.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; The Greeks also had aqueducts and sewer systems that used rain and wastewater to irrigate and fertilize fields.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

The first [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]] in Rome was constructed in 312 B.C.E., and from there, they continued to construct [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]] for irrigation and safe urban water supply during droughts.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; They also built an underground sewer system as early as the 7th century B.C.E. that fed into the Tiber River, draining marshes to create farmland as well as removing sewage from the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

=== Modern era ===
Very little change was seen from the fall of Rome until the 19th century, where improvements saw increasing efforts focused on public health.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;National Science Foundation.(Dec. 3, 2009).Environmental Engineering&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=501029|title=Funding - Environmental Engineering|website=US National Science Foundation|accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern environmental engineering began in [[London]] in the mid-19th century when [[Joseph Bazalgette]] designed the first major [[sewage collection and disposal|sewerage]] system following the [[Great Stink]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The city's sewer system conveyed raw sewage to the [[River Thames]], which also supplied the majority of the city's drinking water, leading to an outbreak of [[cholera]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The introduction of drinking water treatment and sewage treatment in industrialized countries reduced [[waterborne diseases]] from leading causes of death to rarities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Water industry from The Oxford Companion to British History online&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/medicine/diseases-and-conditions/pathology/waterborne-infections|title=Waterborne Infections|website=Encyclopedia.com|access-date=2019-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field emerged as a separate academic discipline during the middle of the 20th century in response to widespread public concern about water and air pollution and other environmental degradation. As society and technology grew more complex, they increasingly produced unintended effects on the natural environment. One example is the widespread application of the pesticide [[DDT]] to control agricultural pests in the years following [[World War II]]. While the [[agriculture|agricultural]] benefits were outstanding and crop yields increased dramatically, reducing world hunger, and [[malaria]] was controlled better than ever before, the pesticide brought numerous bird species to the edge of extinction due to its impact on their reproductive cycle. The story of DDT as vividly told in [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962) is considered to be the birth of the modern environmental movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~radniect/whatisenvironmentalengineering.php|title=What is Environmental Engineering?|last=Radniecki|first=Tyler|website=College of Engineering|publisher=Oregon State University|access-date=2019-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the modern field of &quot;environmental engineering.&quot;

==Education==
Many universities offer environmental engineering programs through either the department of [[civil engineering]] or [[chemical engineering]] and also including electronic projects to develop and balance the environmental 
conditions.  Environmental engineers in a civil engineering program often focus on hydrology, water resources management, [[bioremediation]], and water and wastewater treatment plant design. Environmental engineers in a chemical engineering program tend to focus on environmental chemistry, advanced air and water treatment technologies, and separation processes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Some subdivisions of environmental engineering include [[natural resources engineering]] and [[agricultural engineering]].

Courses for students fall into a few broad classes:

*''[[Mechanical engineering]]'' courses oriented towards designing machines and mechanical systems for environmental use such as [[Water treatment|water]] and [[wastewater treatment]] facilities, pumping stations, garbage segregation plants, and other mechanical facilities.
*''Environmental engineering'' or ''environmental systems'' courses oriented towards a civil engineering approach in which structures and the landscape are constructed to blend with or protect the environment.
*''[[Environmental chemistry]]'', ''sustainable chemistry'' or ''environmental chemical engineering'' courses oriented towards understanding the effects of chemicals in the environment, including any mining processes, pollutants, and also biochemical processes.
*''[[Environmental technology]]'' courses oriented towards producing electronic or electrical graduates capable of developing devices and artifacts able to monitor, measure, model and control environmental impact, including monitoring and managing energy generation from [[Renewable energy|renewable sources]].

== Applications ==

===Water supply and treatment===
Environmental engineers evaluate the water balance within a [[drainage basin|watershed]] and determine the available water supply, the water needed for various needs in that watershed, the seasonal cycles of water movement through the watershed and they develop systems to store, treat, and convey water for various uses.

Water is treated to achieve water quality objectives for the end uses. In the case of a [[potable water]] supply, water is treated to minimize the risk of [[infectious disease]] transmission, the risk of [[Non-communicable disease|non-infectious]] illness, and to create a palatable water flavor. [[Water distribution system|Water distribution systems]]&lt;ref name=&quot;nap&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/11728/chapter/2|title=Drinking water distribution systems : assessing and reducing risks|date=2006|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-10306-0|accessdate=6 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kfupm&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Distribution Networks CE370|url=https://faculty.kfupm.edu.sa/CE/abukhari/Courses/CE370/Lectures/Water%20Distribution%20System.pdf|accessdate=6 October 2019|website=King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals}}&lt;/ref&gt; are designed and built to provide adequate water pressure and flow rates to meet various end-user needs such as domestic use, fire suppression, and [[irrigation]].

===Wastewater treatment===
[[File:Wonga wetlands sewage plant.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[Sewage treatment]] plant, [[Australia]]]]There are numerous [[wastewater treatment]] technologies. A wastewater treatment train can consist of a primary clarifier system to remove solid and floating materials, a secondary treatment system consisting of an [[aeration]] basin followed by [[flocculation]] and [[settling|sedimentation]] or an [[activated sludge]] system and a secondary clarifier, a tertiary biological [[nitrogen]] removal system, and a final [[disinfection]] process. The aeration basin/activated sludge system removes organic material by growing bacteria (activated sludge).  The secondary clarifier removes the activated sludge from the water. The tertiary system, although not always included due to costs, is becoming more prevalent to remove nitrogen and [[phosphorus]] and to disinfect the water before discharge to a surface water stream or ocean outfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Sims, J.|title= Activated sludge, Environmental Encyclopedia |publisher=Detroit|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air pollution management===

Scientists have developed [[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|air pollution dispersion models]] to evaluate the concentration of a pollutant at a receptor or the impact on overall air quality from vehicle [[Exhaust system|exhausts]] and industrial [[flue gas stack]] emissions. To some extent, this field overlaps the desire to decrease [[carbon dioxide]] and other [[greenhouse gas]] emissions from combustion processes.

===Environmental impact assessment and mitigation===
{{Main|Environmental impact assessment}}[[File:Water pollution.jpg|right|thumbnail|200px|Water pollution]]

Environmental engineers apply scientific and engineering principles to evaluate if there are likely to be any adverse impacts to water quality, air quality, [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] quality, [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]], agricultural capacity, [[traffic]], ecology, and noise. If impacts are expected, they then develop mitigation measures to limit or prevent such impacts. An example of a mitigation measure would be the creation of [[wetland]]s in a nearby location to mitigate the filling in of wetlands necessary for a road development if it is not possible to reroute the road.

In the United States, the practice of environmental assessment was formally initiated on January 1, 1970, the effective date of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA). Since that time, more than 100 developing and developed nations either have planned specific analogous laws or have adopted procedure used elsewhere. NEPA is applicable to all federal agencies in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGraw-Hill, Inc&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Environmental Science and Engineering|url=https://archive.org/details/mcgrawhillencycl0000unse|url-access=registration|publisher=McGraw-Hill, Inc|year=1993|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulatory agencies ==

===Environmental Protection Agency===
The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) is one of the many agencies that work with environmental engineers to solve key issues. An important component of EPA's mission is to protect and improve air, water, and overall environmental quality in order to avoid or mitigate the consequences of harmful effects.

'''Construction engineering''' is a professional discipline that deals with the [[designing]], [[planning]], [[construction]] and [[management]] of [[infrastructures]] such as [[roads]], [[tunnels]], [[bridges]], [[airports]], [[railroads]], facilities, [[buildings]], [[dams]], [[utilities]] and other [[projects]].

Civil engineering is a related field that deals more with the practical aspects of projects. Construction engineers learn some of the design aspects similar to civil engineers as well as project site management aspects.

At the educational level, civil engineering students concentrate primarily on the design work which is more analytical, gearing them toward a career as a design professional. This essentially requires them to take a multitude of challenging engineering science and design courses as part of obtaining a 4-year accredited degree. Education for construction engineers is primarily focused on construction procedures, methods, costs, schedules and personnel management. Their primary concern is to deliver a project on time within budget and of the desired quality.

The difference between a construction engineer and a civil engineer is that construction engineering students take basic design courses as well as construction management courses.

==Work activities==
Being a sub-discipline of Civil Engineering, construction Engineers apply their knowledge and business, technical and management skills obtained from their undergraduate degree to oversee projects that include bridges, buildings and housing projects. Construction Engineers are heavily involved in the design and management/ allocation of funds in these projects. They are charged with risk analysis, costing and planning. A career in design work does require a professional engineer license (PE). Individuals who pursue this career path are strongly advised to sit for the [[Engineer in Training]] exam (EIT), also, referred to as the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam (FE) while in college as it takes five years' (4 years in USA) post-graduate to obtain the PE license. Some state have recently changed the PE license exam pre-requisite of 4 years work experience after graduation to become a licensed Professional Engineer where an [[Engineer in Training|EIT]] is eligible to take the PE Exam in as little as 6 months after taking the FE exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nspe.org/sites/default/files/resources/pdfs/admin/publications/NSPE-When-Can-I-Take-the-PE-Exam.pdf|title=When can I take the PE Exam|website=www.nspe.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entry-level construction engineers position is typically project engineers or assistant project engineers. They are responsible for preparing purchasing requisitions, processing change orders, preparing monthly budgeting reports and handling meeting minutes. The construction management position does not necessarily require a PE license; however, possessing one does make the individual more marketable, as the PE license allows the individual to sign off on temporary structure designs.
[[File:Nvetractor.jpg|thumb|A construction project.]]

==Abilities==
Construction engineers are problem solvers. They contribute to the creation of infrastructure that best meets the unique demands of its environment. They must be able to understand infrastructure life cycles. When compared and contrasted to design engineers, construction engineers bring to the table their own unique perspectives for solving technical challenges with clarity and imagination. While individuals considering this career path should certainly have a strong understanding of mathematics and science, many other skills are also highly desirable, including critical and analytical thinking, time management, people management and good communication skills.

==Educational requirements==
Individuals looking to obtain a construction engineering degree must first ensure that the program is accredited by the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET). ABET accreditation is assurance that a college or university program meets the quality standards established by the profession for which it prepares its students. In the US there are currently twenty-five programs that exist in the entire country so careful college consideration is advised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abet.org|title=ABET - ABET accreditation|website=www.abet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical construction engineering curriculum is a mixture of [[engineering mechanics]], [[engineering design]], construction management and general science and mathematics. This usually leads to a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree. The B.S. degree along with some design or construction experience is sufficient for most entry-level positions. Graduate schools may be an option for those who want to go further in depth of the construction and engineering subjects taught at the undergraduate level. In most cases construction engineering graduates look to either [[civil engineering]], [[engineering management]] or [[business administration]] as a possible graduate degree.

==Job prospects==
Job prospects for construction engineers generally have a strong cyclical variation. For example, starting in 2008 and continuing until at least 2011, job prospects have been poor due to the collapse of housing bubbles in many parts of the world. This sharply reduced demand for construction, forced construction professionals towards infrastructure construction and therefore increased the competition faced by established and new construction engineers. This increased competition and a core reduction in quantity demand is in parallel with a possible shift in the demand for construction engineers due to the automation of many engineering tasks, overall resulting in reduced prospects for construction engineers. In early 2010, the United States construction industry had a 27% unemployment rate, this is nearly three times higher than the 9.7%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.forconstructionpros.com/online/Construction-News/Construction-Unemployment-Rate-Hits-27-percent/4FCP15312 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711020046/http://www.forconstructionpros.com/online/Construction-News/Construction-Unemployment-Rate-Hits-27-percent/4FCP15312 |archive-date=2011-07-11 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; national average unemployment rate. The construction unemployment rate (including tradesmen) is comparable to the United States 1933 unemployment rate—the lowest point of the [[Great Depression]]—of 25%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bls.gov/opub/cwc/cm20030124ar03p1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remuneration==
The average salary for a civil engineer in the UK depends on the sector and more specifically the level of experience of the individual. A 2010 survey of the remuneration and benefits of those occupying jobs in construction and the built environment industry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=
http://www.responsesource.com/releases/rel_display.php?relid=62674|title=CareerStructure.com Launches Salary Benchmarker Tool|accessdate=2011-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the average salary of a civil engineer in the UK is £29,582. In the United States, as of May 2013, the average was $85,640.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

For those with between 14 and 20 years' experience the average is £38,214.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://salarybenchmarker.careerstructure.com/?WT.mc_id=B_A_EM_SB_GPR|title=Salary Benchmarker Tool|accessdate=2011-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

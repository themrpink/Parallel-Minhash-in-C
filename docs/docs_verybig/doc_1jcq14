In Cambodia, Lara finds Powell, who has hired West, and his commandos already at the temple. West solves part of the temple's puzzle, and Powell prepares to insert the clock at the moment of alignment. Lara, realizing they are mistaken, finds the correct keyhole; with only seconds left, Lara persuades Powell to throw her the clock. She unlocks the first piece of the Triangle, and the statues of the temple come to life and attack the intruders. West, Powell, and his remaining men flee with the clock, leaving Lara to defeat an enormous six-armed guardian statue. She escapes with the first piece; recovering at a Buddhist monastery, she arranges a meeting with Powell.

In Venice, Powell proposes a partnership to find the Triangle, and informs Lara that her father was a member of the Illuminati, and offers to use the Triangle's power to resurrect him; though reluctant, she agrees to join forces. Lara and Bryce travel with Powell, West, and the leader of the Illuminati ([[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]]) to Siberia. Entering the tomb, they discover a giant [[orrery]], which activates as the alignment nears completion. Lara retrieves the second half of the Triangle, and Powell kills the Illuminati's leader to restore the Triangle himself, but the halves will not fuse. Realizing Lara knows the solution, Powell kills West to persuade her to complete the Triangle to restore West's and her father's lives. Lara complies, but seizes the Triangle herself.

In a &quot;crossing&quot; of time, Lara faces the memory of her father, who urges her to destroy the Triangle for good rather than save his life. Returning to the tomb, Lara manipulates time to save West and stab Powell, and destroys the Triangle. The tomb begins to collapse, and all flee but the wounded Powell, who reveals to Lara that he murdered her father. After a hand-to-hand fight, she kills Powell, retrieving her father's pocket watch and escaping the tomb.

Back in her manor, Lara visits her father's memorial and finds that Bryce has reprogrammed the robot, and Hilary presents her with her pistols, which she takes with a smile.

==Production==

===Development===
''Tomb Raider'' went through many drafts and several writers, which resulted in production delays. In 1998, writer Brent V. Friedman, who had co-written ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]]'' the year before, penned an unproduced ''Tomb Raider'' script. Producer and screenwriter [[Steven E. de Souza]], who wrote and directed the 1994 video game film ''[[Street Fighter (1994 film)|Street Fighter]]'', penned an early draft of the ''Tomb Raider'' script in 1999, but it was rejected by Paramount. The final draft of the script was attributed to five writers, including director Simon West.

===Financing===
''Lara Croft'' was financed through [[Tele München Gruppe]] (TMG), a German [[tax shelter]]. The tax law of Germany allowed investors to take an instant tax deduction even on non-German productions and even if the film has not gone into production. By selling them the copyright for $94 million and then buying it back for $83.8 million, [[Paramount Pictures]] made $10.2 million. The copyright was then sold again to Lombard Bank, a British investment group and a further $12 million was made. However, to qualify for Section 48 tax relief, the production must include some UK filming and British actors, which was acceptable for a film partially set in the United Kingdom. Presales to distributors in Japan, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain made a further $65 million. [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] paid $6.8 million for premium cable television rights. In total, $94 million was put together.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.de/books?id=9vpfAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Pradeep Thakur: ''Angelina Jolie: The World's Most Powerful Celebrity?'', Morrisville (NC) &amp;#91;without date&amp;#93;, p. 99.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The deal between [[Eidos Interactive|Eidos]], ''Tomb Raider''{{'}}s publisher, and Paramount Pictures was structured so Eidos received royalties.

===Casting===
The announcement of the film generated significant discussion about who would be cast to play Lara Croft. Numerous actresses (and non-actresses) were rumoured to be on the shortlist to play her and countless others declared their interest in the role,&lt;ref name=burningquestions&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://ew.com/article/2001/06/27/ewcom-answers-your-tomb-raider-burning-questions/|title=EW.com answers your ''Tomb Raider'' burning questions|magazine = [[Entertainment Weekly]]|date = June 27, 2001|accessdate = December 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]], [[Famke Janssen]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Rhona Mitra]], [[Elizabeth Hurley]], [[Ashley Judd]], [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]], [[Diane Lane]], [[Demi Moore]] and [[Denise Richards]], with many considering the latter the favourite to win the role.&lt;ref name=burningquestions/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1SqXAAAAQBAJ&amp;q=lara+croft+film&amp;pg=PA141|title=Casting Might-Have-Beens: A Film by Film Directory of Actors Considered for Roles Given to Others|author=Eila Mell|date=2005|isbn=9781476609768|accessdate = December 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=developmenthell&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4nG_BgAAQBAJ&amp;q=lara+croft+film&amp;pg=PT312|title=Tales From Development Hell: New Updated Edition|author=David Hughes|date=2003|isbn=9780857687319|accessdate = December 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The casting of Jolie was controversial among many fans of the ''Tomb Raider'' series, who felt she wasn't physically appropriate enough to play the large-breasted heroine; others complained about an American actress being hired to play a British character; others cited Jolie's tattoos and well-publicised controversial personal life.&lt;ref name=&quot;developmenthell&quot; /&gt; Director Simon West dismissed these concerns and said, in reference to Jolie's penchant for sexual knife play, &quot;it was always Angelina. I mean, Lara sleeps with knives and doesn't take shit from anybody. That's [Angelina] down to a tee.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;developmenthell&quot; /&gt; Jolie wore a padded bra to increase her bust size when playing Lara. As she explained to ''NY Rock'' in June 2001: &quot;C'mon, I'm not so flat chested to begin with. When I wear a tight T-shirt, I look a certain way. So it wasn't like we had to completely change me. You know, we just had to enhance me a little. I'm a 36C. Lara, she's a 36D. And in the game, she's a double D, so we took her down some. But we did give her a bit of padding there. For me, it was simply one size. So it was like having a padded bra. But no, I am not flat chested anyway. So we still made it Lara Croft, but we didn't go to any extremes. And Lara doesn't apologize for herself, and for having that, you know, recognizable shape. So I'm not going to apologize for her either.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.salon.com/2013/05/15/angelina_jolies_most_thrilling_decision_robbing_her_breasts_of_their_cultural_power/|title=Angelina Jolie's most thrilling decision: Robbing her breasts of their cultural power|work=Salon|date=May 15, 2013|accessdate = December 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/2001/jolie_int.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011202073359/http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/2001/jolie_int.asp|title=Angelina Jolie On Filling Lara Croft's Shoes and D-size Cups|publisher=NY Rocks|date=June 2001|accessdate = December 27, 2017|archive-date=December 2, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film marked the feature film debut of television actor [[Chris Barrie]], known for his role of Arnold Rimmer in the [[BBC]] science fiction comedy series ''[[Red Dwarf]]''. English actor [[Daniel Craig]] adopts an American accent for the role of Alex West whilst Jolie, being American herself, takes on an English accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Does Angelina Jolie's 'Tomb Raider' Hold Up? |url= https://www.gq.com/story/does-angelina-jolies-tomb-raider-movie-hold-up |website= GQ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jon Voight, Angelina Jolie's father, plays Richard Croft, Lara's father in the film.

===Filming===
Principal photography for ''Lara Croft: Tomb Raider'' took place from July 30 to November 30, 2000. Portions of the film were shot on location at the [[Ta Prohm]] temple, located in [[Angkor]], [[Siem Reap Province]], [[Cambodia]]. The film was the first major motion picture to be shot in Cambodia since ''[[Lord Jim (1965 film)|Lord Jim]]'' in 1964, following the country's occupation by the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=East|first=James|title=The making of Tomb Raider in Cambodia|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/dec/08/culture.features2|website=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=May 5, 2018|date=December 8, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to on-location shooting, a majority of the film's production also took place on the [[007 Stage]] at [[Pinewood Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=D|first=Spence|title=Interview with Tomb Raider Director Simon West|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/05/23/interview-with-tomb-raider-director-simon-west|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|accessdate=May 5, 2018|date=May 23, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hatfield House]] in Hertfordshire was used as Croft's home in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Clugston |first=Harriet|date=November 15, 2017 |url=https://www.hertfordshiremercury.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/eight-movie-scenes-you-didnt-779135|title=Eight movie scenes you didn't know were filmed in Hertfordshire|publisher=Hertfordshire Mercury |accessdate=August 6, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The film received generally negative reviews, earning a 21% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 160 reviews, with an average rating of 3.92/10. The site's consensus is &quot;Angelina Jolie is perfect for the role of Lara Croft, but even she can't save the movie from a senseless plot and action sequences with no emotional impact&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lara_croft_tomb_raider/ |title= Lara Croft: Tomb Raider |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=March 26, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]] it has a weighted average score of 33% based on reviews from 31 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Lara Croft: Tomb Raider |url= https://www.metacritic.com/movie/lara-croft-tomb-raider |website= [[Metacritic]] |accessdate= 13 August 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences surveyed by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film a grade B on scale of A to F.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |title= Cinemascore |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181220122629/https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |archive-date= December 20, 2018 |access-date= August 14, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said &quot;[the film] has the distinction of being a major motion picture that’s far less imaginative, and quite a bit more stupid, than the interactive game it’s based on.&quot;  McCarthy praises Jolie but says &quot;everything else about this frenetic production is flat and unexciting.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date= 15 June 2001 |last= McCarthy |first= Todd |author-link= Todd McCarthy |title= Lara Croft: Tomb Raider |url= https://variety.com/2001/film/reviews/lara-croft-tomb-raider-1200468801/ |website= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=1 January 2000 |author= Simon Braund |author-link= Simon Braund |title= Lara Croft: Tomb Raider |url= https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/lara-croft-tomb-raider-review/ |website= Empire }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A positive review came from [[Roger Ebert]], who awarded the film three out of four stars and said, {{&quot;'}}Lara Croft Tomb Raider' elevates goofiness to an art form. Here is a movie so monumentally silly, yet so wondrous to look at, that only a churl could find fault.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date= June 15, 2001 |first= Roger |last= Ebert |author-link= Roger Ebert |url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/lara-croft-tomb-raider-2001 |title= Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (review) |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |accessdate= July 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office ===
''Tomb Raider'' was a box office success. The movie debuted at number one with $48.2 million ahead of ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'' and ''[[Shrek]]''.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hive4media.com/news/html/Theatrical_Article.cfm?article_id=1327|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010701190325/http://www.hive4media.com/news/html/Theatrical_Article.cfm?article_id=1327|title=Weekend Boxoffice Report: 'Lara Croft' Leaps Into the Big Game at No. 1|website=[[hive4media.com]]|archivedate=July 1, 2001|date=June 18, 2001|accessdate=September 21, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving Paramount its second-best debut and the fifth-highest debut of 2001. It beat the opening record for a film featuring a female protagonist ($42.3) million for ''[[Scary Movie]]'') as well as the opening record for a video game adaptation ($31 million for ''[[Pokémon: The First Movie]]''), and is one of the highest grossing video game to film adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficeguru.com/061801.htm |title=Weekend Box Office |publisher=Box Office Guru |date=June 18, 2001 |accessdate=February 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=videogameadaptation.htm |title=Video Game Adaptation Movies at the Box Office |website= [[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=February 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie has grossed a total of $274,703,340 worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;mojo&quot; /&gt;

===Themes===
Director Simon West would comment a decade after its release that the creation of ''Lara Croft'' was influenced by a film market that &quot;wasn't used to women leading summer blockbusters&quot;.&lt;ref name=tr&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2019-11-23

|publisher= Entertainment Weekly
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This factor influenced his decision to cast [[Angelina Jolie]] who was not well known at the time, and not the studio's first choice (in contrast to [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]], [[Ashley Judd]], and [[Jennifer Lopez]]).&lt;ref name=tr/&gt; West said that his decision to cast Jolie lay in the fact that &quot;there hadn’t been a female lead of an action-adventure film that had carried a film [by herself recently], and Angelina wasn’t as big as some of the other actresses that were up for the part, who’d done bigger films and had a longer track record and bigger box-office grosses. … Some of their [images] were safer than Angelina’s, whose was quite dangerous. She had all sorts of thing written about her—some obviously not true. She was a young woman experimenting.”&lt;ref name=tr/&gt; While ''Lara Croft''{{'}}s box office totals were the highest for an female-led action film at the time ($131 million), inspired theme park rides and led to a sequel, West stated that &quot;at the time, the studio was incredibly nervous at what the outcome could have been. I’m surprised it’s taken so long [for other female-fronted action stories to rise up], because I thought that two or three years after, there’d be 10 other movies like it cashing in on its success ...[b]ut it’s amazing how things work so slowly. But finally ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|The Hunger Games]]'' and [[Patty Jenkins]]’ [[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]] have caught up!”&lt;ref name=tr/&gt;

===Awards and nominations===
The film was nominated for two [[MTV Movie Awards]], these awards included: Best Female Performance and Best Fight scene, but the film lost to ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' and ''[[Rush Hour 2]]'' respectively. The film was also nominated for [[Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie - Drama]]. Angelina Jolie was nominated for the [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]] [[Golden Raspberry Award]] for her role in the film, but she lost to [[Mariah Carey]] in ''[[Glitter (film)|Glitter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=John|title=22nd Annual Razzie Nominations Announced|url=http://razzies.com/asp/content/XcNewsPlus.asp?cmd=view&amp;articleid=51|publisher=Golden Raspberry Award Foundation|date=February 11, 2002|accessdate=February 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210084551/http://razzies.com/asp/content/xcnewsplus.asp?cmd=view&amp;articleid=51|archive-date=December 10, 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first Tomb Raider film, Nathan McCree was hired, though the producers eventually decided that a feature-length film needed a feature-name composer. Therefore, they hired [[Michael Kamen]], despite the fact that his score for the similarly cult ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' the previous year failed to arouse the interest of many of the concept's followers. Kamen wrote and submitted a demo for Tomb Raider, but no feedback on that music was returned by the director or producers. Only during the process of recording a second demo did Kamen finally hear back from the Tomb Raider team, and by then, the lack of enthusiasm for the relationship on both sides caused Kamen to seek other projects that were more promising to him (namely, the HBO show ''[[Band of Brothers (miniseries)|Band of Brothers]]'', requiring 10 hours of music). Thus, the producers of Tomb Raider were forced to hire another composer at the very last minute. The man hired for the last minute assignment was [[Graeme Revell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TRMusicGR&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Tomb Raider (Graeme Ravell) |url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/tomb_raider.html|accessdate=2014-04-03 |publisher=[[Film Tracks]] |date=2013-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He composed the soundtrack in less than two weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;twoweeks&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=TOMB RAIDER: Composer Graeme Revell - Creating a feature-film soundtrack in less than two weeks. |url=http://www.mania.com/tomb-raider-composer-graeme-revell_article_27089.html |accessdate=2014-04-03 |publisher=[[mania.com]] |date=2013-03-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404182654/http://www.mania.com/tomb-raider-composer-graeme-revell_article_27089.html |archive-date=April 4, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not use the original Tomb Raider theme.

The CD was released through [[Elektra Entertainment]], but as noted by Revell and after failed attempts to stop the pressings, the tracks were mislabeled. For example, the opening track includes both the Main Titles and Lara Croft at Home cues together. The resulting score was so poorly received &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/tomb_raider.html|title=Filmtracks: Tomb Raider (Graeme Revell)|website=www.filmtracks.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the composer himself issued an apology through his website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/tomb_raider.html |title=Tomb Raider (Graeme Revell) |publisher=Filmtracks |date=2001-06-26 |accessdate=2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track list was later revised.&lt;ref name=&quot;Graeme Revell's Website&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.graemerevell.com/grnews.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010810004408/http://www.graemerevell.com/grnews.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 10, 2001 |title=GraemeRevell.com NEWS |accessdate=February 19, 2013 |publisher=GraemeRevell.com |first=Phil |last=Castillo |date=July 29, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

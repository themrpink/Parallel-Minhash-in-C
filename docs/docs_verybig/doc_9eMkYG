A '''Condorcet method''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|k|ɒ|n|d|ɔr|ˈ|s|eɪ}}; {{IPA-fr|kɔ̃dɔʁsɛ|lang}}) is one of several [[election method]]s that elects the candidate that wins a majority of the vote in every head-to-head election against each of the other candidates, that is, a candidate preferred by more voters than any others, whenever there is such a candidate. A candidate with this property, the ''pairwise champion'' or ''beats-all winner'', is formally called the ''Condorcet winner''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s003550000071 |quote=The Condorcet winner in an election is the candidate who would be able to defeat all other candidates in a series of pairwise elections.|title=Condorcet efficiency: A preference for indifference|year=2001|last1=Gehrlein|first1=William V.|last2=Valognes|first2=Fabrice|journal=Social Choice and Welfare|volume=18|pages=193–205|s2cid=10493112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the head-to-head elections aren't necessarily done separately; a voter's preference between every pair of candidates can be found by asking them to rank the candidates, and then assuming they would vote for the candidate they ranked higher for each pairing.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Four-Condorcet-Hare-Hybrid-Methods-for-Elections-Green-Armytage/49dba225741582cae5aabec6f1b5ff722f6fedf1 &quot;Pairwise comparison: An imaginary head-to-head contest between two candidates, in which each voter is assumed to vote for the candidate whom he gives a better ranking to.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 

A Condorcet winner might not always exist in a particular election because the preference of a group of voters selecting from more than two options may be cyclic — that is, it is possible (but very rare) that every candidate has an opponent that defeats them in a two-candidate contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=30022874?seq=1 |quote=Condorcet's paradox [6] of simple majority voting occurs in a voting situation [...] if for every alternative there is a second alternative which more voters prefer to the first alternative than conversely.|last1=Gehrlein|first1=William V.|last2=Fishburn|first2=Peter C.|title=Condorcet's Paradox and Anonymous Preference Profiles|journal=Public Choice|year=1976|volume=26|pages=1–18|doi=10.1007/BF01725789|s2cid=153482816}}&lt;/ref&gt;(This is similar to the game [[rock paper scissors]], where each hand shape wins against only one opponent and loses to another). The possibility of such cyclic preferences in a group of voters is known as the [[Condorcet paradox]]. However, there always exists a smallest group of candidates that beat all candidates not in the group, known as the [[Smith set]], which is guaranteed to only have the Condorcet winner in it when one exists; many Condorcet methods always elect a candidate who is in the Smith set when there is no Condorcet winner, and are thus said to be &quot;Smith-efficient&quot;. &lt;ref&gt; http://pj.freefaculty.org/Papers/Ukraine/PJ3_VotingSystemsEssay.pdf Voting Systems &quot;Formally, the Smith set is defined as the smaller of two sets:
1. The set of all alternatives, X.
2. A subset A ⊂ X such that each member of A can defeat every member of X that is
36
not in A, which we call B=X − A.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The Condorcet winner is also usually but not necessarily the [[Utility|utilitarian]] winner (the one which maximizes [[Social welfare function|social welfare]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pivato|first=Marcus|date=2015-08-01|title=Condorcet meets Bentham|url= |journal=Journal of Mathematical Economics|volume=59|pages=58–65|doi=10.1016/j.jmateco.2015.04.006|quote=Indeed, it is easy to construct examples where the Condorcet winner does not maximize social welfare [...however...] in a large population satisfying certain statistical regularities, not only is the Condorcet winner almost guaranteed to exist, but it is almost guaranteed to also be the utilitarian social choice.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lehtinen|first=Aki|date=2007-08-01|title=The Welfare Consequences of Strategic Voting in Two Commonly Used Parliamentary Agendas|journal=Theory and Decision|language=en|volume=63|issue=1|pages=1–40|doi=10.1007/s11238-007-9028-4|issn=0040-5833|quote=If the CW is not the same alternative as the utilitarian winner (UW), the latter ought to be selected according to the utilitarian welfare criterion|citeseerx=10.1.1.727.3928|s2cid=153595828}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Condorcet voting methods are named for the 18th-century French [[mathematician]] and [[philosopher]] Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas Caritat, the [[Marquis de Condorcet]], who championed such voting systems.  However, [[Ramon Llull]] devised the earliest known Condorcet method in 1299.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=G. Hägele and F. Pukelsheim|year=2001|title=Llull's writings on electoral systems|url=http://www.math.uni-augsburg.de/stochastik/pukelsheim/2001a.html|journal=Studia Lulliana|volume=41|pages=3–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was equivalent to [[Copeland's method]] in cases with no pairwise ties.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Colomer|first=Josep|year=2013|title=Ramon Llull: From Ars Electionis to Social Choice Theory|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220007301|journal=[[Social Choice and Welfare]]|volume=40|issue=2|page=317–328|doi=10.1007/s00355-011-0598-2|hdl=10261/125715|s2cid=43015882|hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Condorcet methods may use preferential (ranked) voting (and normally do) or separate rounds of runoff elections.

Most Condorcet methods have a single round of preferential voting, in which each voter ranks the candidates from most preferred (marked as number 1) to least preferred (marked with a higher number). A voter's ranking is often called their ''order of preference,'' although it may not match their sincere order of preference since voters are free to rank in any order they choose and may have strategic reasons to misrepresent preferences. The votes can be tallied in many ways to find a winner. Some - the Condorcet methods - will elect the Condorcet winner if there is one. They can also elect a winner when there is no Condorcet winner, and different Condorcet-compliant methods may elect different winners in the case of a cycle - Condorcet methods differ on which other criteria they satisfy.

The procedure given in [[Robert's Rules of Order]] for voting on motions and amendments is also a Condorcet method, even though the voters do not vote by expressing their orders of preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01789561 |quote=Binary procedures of the Jefferson/Robert variety will select the Condorcet winner if one exists|title=Did Jefferson or Madison understand Condorcet's theory of social choice?|year=1992|last1=McLean|first1=Iain|last2=Urken|first2=Arnold B.|journal=Public Choice|volume=73|issue=4|pages=445–457|s2cid=145167169}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple rounds of voting, and in each round the vote is between two of the alternatives. The loser (by majority rule) of a pairing is eliminated, and the winner of a pairing survives to be paired in a later round against another alternative. Eventually only one alternative remains, and it is the winner. This is analogous to a single-winner or round-robin tournament; the total number of pairings is one less than the number of alternatives. Since a Condorcet winner will win by majority rule in each of its pairings, it will never be eliminated by Robert's Rules. But this method cannot reveal a [[voting paradox]] in which there is no Condorcet winner and a majority prefer an early loser over the eventual winner (though it will always elect someone in the [[Smith set]]). A considerable portion of the literature on social choice theory is about the properties of this method since it is widely used and is used by important organizations (legislatures, councils, committees, etc.). It is not practical for use in public elections, however, since its multiple rounds of voting would be very expensive for voters, for candidates, and for governments to administer.

==Summary==
In a contest between candidates A and B run using the preferential-vote form of Condorcet method, if more voters mark their ballots that they prefer candidate A over candidate B than the number of voters who mark their ballots to the contrary, then Candidate B is not (supposed to be) elected.

However, because of the possibility of the [[Condorcet paradox]], it is possible, but unlikely,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Voting paradoxes and group coherence : the condorcet efficiency of voting rules|last=Gehrlein, William V.|date=2011|publisher=Springer|others=Lepelley, Dominique.|isbn=9783642031076|location=Berlin|pages=|oclc=695387286|quote=empirical studies ... indicate that some of the most common paradoxes are relatively unlikely to be observed in actual elections. ... it is easily concluded that Condorcet’s Paradox should very rarely be observed in any real elections on a small number of candidates with large electorates, as long as voters’ preferences reflect any reasonable degree of group mutual coherence}}&lt;/ref&gt; that this objective cannot be realized in a specific election. This is sometimes called a ''Condorcet cycle'' or just ''cycle'' and can be thought of as [[rock paper scissors|Candidate Rock beating Candidate Scissors, Candidate Scissors beating Candidate Paper, and Candidate Paper beating Candidate Rock]]. It is only in how the various Condorcet methods resolve such a cycle that they effectively differ (though most elections do not have cycles; see [[Condorcet paradox#Likelihood of the paradox]] for estimates). If there is no cycle, all Condorcet methods elect the same candidate and are operationally equivalent.

*Each voter ranks the candidates in order of preference (top-to-bottom, or best-to-worst, or 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.). The voter may be allowed to rank candidates as equals, to express indifference (no preference) between them. To save time, candidates omitted by a voter may be treated as if the voter ranked them at the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1807.01366 |quote=CC [Condorcet] systems typically allow tied ranks.

*For each pairing of candidates (as in a [[round-robin tournament]]) count how many votes rank each candidate over the other candidate. Thus each pairing will have two totals: the size of its majority and the size of its minority{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hazewinkel|first=Michiel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ujnhBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110|title=Encyclopaedia of Mathematics, Supplement III|date=2007-11-23|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-306-48373-8|language=en |quote=Briefly, one can say candidate ''A'' ''defeats'' candidate ''B'' if a majority of the voters prefer A to B. With only two candidates [...] barring ties [...] one of the two candidates will defeat the other.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or there will be a tie).

For most Condorcet methods, those counts usually suffice to determine the complete order of finish (i.e. who won, who came in 2nd place, etc.) They always suffice to determine whether there is a Condorcet winner. 

Additional information may be needed in the event of ties. Ties can be pairings that have no majority, or they can be majorities that are the same size; these ties will be rare when there are many voters. Some Condorcet methods may have other kinds of ties; for example, with [[Copeland's method]], it would not be rare for two or more candidates to win the same number of pairings, when there is no Condorcet winner.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Definition==
A Condorcet method is a voting system that will always elect the Condorcet winner (if there is one); this is the candidate whom voters prefer to each other candidate, when compared to them one at a time. This candidate can be found (if they exist; see next paragraph) by checking if there is a candidate who beats all other candidates; this can be done by using [[Copeland's method]] and then checking if the Copeland winner has the highest possible Copeland score. They can also be found by conducting a series of pairwise comparisons, using the procedure given in Robert's Rules of Order described above. For ''N'' candidates, this requires ''N'' - 1 pairwise hypothetical elections. For example, with 5 candidates there are 4 pairwise comparisons to be made, since after each comparison, a candidate is eliminated, and after 4 eliminations, only one of the original 5 candidates will remain. 

To confirm that a Condorcet winner exists in a given election, first do the Robert's Rules of Order procedure, declare the final remaining candidate the procedure's winner, and then do at most an additional ''N'' - 2 pairwise comparisons between the procedure's winner and any candidates they haven't been compared against yet (including all previously eliminated candidates). If the procedure's winner doesn't win all pairwise matchups, then no Condorcet winner exists in the election (and thus the Smith set has multiple candidates in it). 

Note that computing all pairwise comparisons requires ½''N''(''N''−1) pairwise comparisons for ''N'' candidates. For 10 candidates, this means 0.5*10*9=45 comparisons, which can make elections with many candidates hard to count the votes for.

The family of Condorcet methods is also referred to collectively as Condorcet's method. A voting system that always elects the Condorcet winner when there is one is described by electoral scientists as a system that satisfies the Condorcet criterion.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bae5/ee7b31f1668d477ce8b279728c52a7b39f0b.pdf &quot;Any voting system that elects the Condorcet winner, whenever one exists, is known as a Condorcet method&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a voting system can be considered to have Condorcet consistency, or be Condorcet consistent, if it elects any Condorcet winner.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Pacuit|first=Eric|title=Voting Methods|date=2019|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2019/entries/voting-methods/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2019|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2020-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In certain circumstances, an election has no Condorcet winner. This occurs as a result of a kind of tie known as a ''majority rule cycle'', described by [[Voting paradox|Condorcet's paradox]]. The manner in which a winner is then chosen varies from one Condorcet method to another. Some Condorcet methods involve the basic procedure described below, coupled with a Condorcet completion method, which is used to find a winner when there is no Condorcet winner. Other Condorcet methods involve an entirely different system of counting, but are classified as Condorcet methods, or Condorcet consistent, because they will still elect the Condorcet winner if there is one.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

It is important to note that not all single winner, [[ranked voting systems]] are Condorcet methods. For example, [[instant-runoff voting]] and the [[Borda count]] are not Condorcet methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://economics.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj9386/f/publications/cook_hthesis2011.pdf &quot;IRV satisfies the later-no-harm criterion and the Condorcet loser criterion but fails monotonicity, independence of irrelevant alternatives, and the Condorcet criterion.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic procedure==

===Voting===

In a Condorcet election the voter ranks the list of candidates in order of preference. So, for example, the voter gives a &quot;1&quot; to their first preference, a &quot;2&quot; to their second preference, and so on. In this respect it is the same as an election held under non-Condorcet methods such as [[instant-runoff voting]] or the [[single transferable vote]]. Some Condorcet methods allow voters to rank more than one candidate equally, so that, for example, the voter might express two first preferences rather than just one.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} It is possible to instead allow voters to rate or score the candidates on a scale, similar to [[Score voting]], with a higher rating indicating a greater preference.&lt;ref&gt;https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01972097/document&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, when a voter does not give a full list of preferences they are assumed, for the purpose of the count, to prefer the candidates they have ranked over all candidates they didn't rank, and to have no preference between the candidates they didn't rank. Some Condorcet elections permit [[write-in candidate]]s but, because this can be difficult to implement, software designed for conducting Condorcet elections often does not allow this option.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Finding the winner===

The count is conducted by pitting every candidate against every other candidate in a series of hypothetical one-on-one contests. The winner of each pairing is the candidate preferred by a majority of voters. Unless they tie, there is always a majority when there are only two choices. The candidate preferred by each voter is taken to be the one in the pair that the voter ranks (or rates) higher on their ballot paper. For example, if Alice is paired against Bob it is necessary to count both the number of voters who have ranked Alice higher than Bob, and the number who have ranked Bob higher than Alice. If Alice is preferred by more voters then she is the winner of that pairing. When all possible pairings of candidates have been considered, if one candidate beats every other candidate in these contests then they are declared the Condorcet winner. As noted above, if there is no Condorcet winner a further method must be used to find the winner of the election, and this mechanism varies from one Condorcet consistent method to another.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; In any Condorcet method that passes [[Independence of Smith-dominated alternatives]], it can sometimes help to identify the [[Smith set]] from the head-to-head matchups, and eliminate all candidates not in the set before doing the procedure for that Condorcet method.

===Pairwise counting and matrices===

Condorcet methods use pairwise counting. For each possible pair of candidates, one pairwise count indicates how many voters prefer one of the paired candidates over the other candidate, and another pairwise count indicates how many voters have the opposite preference. The counts for all possible pairs of candidates summarize all the pairwise preferences of all the voters.

Pairwise counts are often displayed in a ''pairwise comparison matrix''&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q2U8jd2AJkEC&amp;pg=PA6|title=Democracy defended|last=Mackie, Gerry.|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0511062648|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=6|oclc=252507400}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''outranking matrix''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Nurmi|first=Hannu|s2cid=12562825|chapter=On the Relevance of Theoretical Results to Voting System Choice|date=2012|pages=255–274|editor-last=Felsenthal|editor-first=Dan S.|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-20441-8_10|isbn=9783642204401|editor2-last=Machover|editor2-first=Moshé|title=Electoral Systems|series=Studies in Choice and Welfare}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as those below. In these [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], each row represents each candidate as a 'runner', while each column represents each candidate as an 'opponent'. The cells at the intersection of rows and columns each show the result of a particular pairwise comparison.

Imagine there is an election between four candidates: A, B, C and D. The first matrix below records the preferences expressed on a single ballot paper, in which the voter's preferences are (B, C, A, D); that is, the voter ranked B first, C second, A third, and D fourth. In the matrix a '1' indicates that the runner is preferred over the 'opponent', while a '0' indicates that the runner is defeated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Using a matrix like the one above, one can find the overall results of an election. Each ballot can be transformed into this style of matrix, and then added to all other ballot matrices using [[matrix addition]]. The sum of all ballots in an election is called the sum matrix.

Suppose that in the imaginary election there are two other voters. Their preferences are (D, A, C, B) and (A, C, B, D). Added to the first voter, these ballots would give the following sum matrix:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width:13em;margin:auto;text-align:center&quot;
! {{diagonal split header|Runner|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Opponent}} !! A !! B !! C !! D
|-
! A
|| —
|| 2 || 2 || 2
|-
! B
|| 1 || — || 1 || 2
|-
! C
|| 1 || 2 || — || 2
|-
! D
|| 1 || 1 || 1 || —
|}

When the sum matrix is found, the contest between each pair of candidates is considered. The number of votes for runner over opponent (runner,opponent) is compared with the number of votes for opponent over runner (opponent,runner) to find the Condorcet winner. In the sum matrix above, A is the Condorcet winner because A beats every other candidate. When there is no Condorcet winner Condorcet completion methods, such as Ranked Pairs and the Schulze method, use the information contained in the sum matrix to choose a winner.

Cells marked '—' in the matrices above have a numerical value of '0', but a dash is used since candidates are never preferred to themselves. The first matrix, that represents a single ballot, is inversely symmetric: (runner,opponent) is ¬(opponent,runner). Or (runner,opponent) + (opponent,runner) = 1. The sum matrix has this property: (runner,opponent) + (opponent,runner) = N for N voters, if all runners were fully ranked by each voter.

==Example: Voting on the location of Tennessee's capital==
{{Tenn voting example}}

To find the Condorcet winner every candidate must be matched against every other candidate in a series of imaginary one-on-one contests. In each pairing the winner is the candidate preferred by a majority of voters. When results for every possible pairing have been found they are as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Pair !! Winner
|-
| Memphis (42%) vs. Nashville (58%)|| Nashville
|-
| Memphis (42%) vs. Chattanooga (58%)|| Chattanooga
|-
| Memphis (42%) vs. Knoxville (58%)|| Knoxville
|-
| Nashville (68%) vs. Chattanooga (32%)|| Nashville
|-
| Nashville (68%) vs. Knoxville (32%)||Nashville
|-
| Chattanooga (83%) vs. Knoxville (17%)|| Chattanooga
|}

The results can also be shown in the form of a matrix:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!1st
! colspan=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;background: #ccffcc&quot; | Nashville [N]
|3 Wins ↓
|-

| style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;&quot; | [N] 68%&lt;br/&gt;[C] 32%
|-

! colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;background: #ffeedd&quot; | Knoxville [K]

| style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;&quot; | [C] 83% &lt;br /&gt;[K] 17%
| style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;&quot; | [N] 68% &lt;br /&gt;[K] 32%
|-

! style=&quot;background: #ffdddd&quot; | Memphis [M]

| style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;&quot; | [K] 58% &lt;br /&gt;[M] 42%
| style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;&quot; | [C] 58% &lt;br /&gt;[M] 42%
| style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;&quot; | [N] 58% &lt;br /&gt;[M] 42%
|}


As can be seen from both of the tables above, Nashville beats every other candidate. This means that Nashville is the Condorcet winner. Nashville will thus win an election held under any possible Condorcet method.

While any Condorcet method will elect Nashville as the winner, if instead an election based on the same votes were held using [[first-past-the-post]] or [[instant-runoff voting]], these systems would select Memphis&lt;ref&gt;The largest bloc ([[Plurality (voting)|plurality]]) of first place votes is 42% for Memphis; no other rankings are considered. So even though 58%—a true majority—would be inconvenienced by having the capital at the most remote location, Memphis wins.&lt;/ref&gt; and Knoxville&lt;ref&gt;Chattanooga (15%) is eliminated in the first round; votes transfer to Knoxville. Nashville (26%) eliminated in the second around; votes transfer to Knoxville. Knoxville wins with 58%.&lt;/ref&gt; respectively. This would occur despite the fact that most people would have preferred Nashville to either of those &quot;winners&quot;. Condorcet methods make these preferences obvious rather than ignoring or discarding them.

On the other hand, note that in this example Chattanooga also defeats Knoxville and Memphis when paired against those cities. If we changed the basis for defining preference and determined that Memphis voters preferred Chattanooga as a second choice rather than as a third choice, Chattanooga would be the Condorcet winner even though finishing in last place in a first-past-the-post election.

An alternative way of thinking about this example if a [[Smith set|Smith-efficient]] Condorcet method that passes [[Independence of Smith-dominated alternatives|ISDA]] is used to determine the winner is that 58% of the voters, a [[Mutual majority criterion|mutual majority]], ranked Memphis last (making Memphis the [[majority loser criterion|majority loser]]) and Nashville, Chattanooga, and Knoxville above Memphis, ruling Memphis out. At that point, the voters who preferred Memphis as their 1st choice could only help to choose a winner among Nashville, Chattanooga, and Knoxville, and because they all preferred Nashville as their 1st choice among those three, Nashville would've had a 68% majority of 1st choices among the remaining candidates and won as the majority's 1st choice.

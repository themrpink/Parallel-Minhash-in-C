'''Anna Ioannovna''' ({{lang-ru|'''Анна Иоанновна'''}}; {{OldStyleDate|7 February|1693|28 January}}{{snd}}{{OldStyleDate|28 October|1740|17 October}}), also spelled '''Anna Ivanovna'''{{sfn|Baynes|1878}} and sometimes [[anglicization of names|anglicized]] as '''Anne''', was regent of the [[duchy of Courland]] from 1711 until 1730 and then ruled as [[Emperor of Russia|Empress of Russia]] from 1730 to 1740. Much of her administration was defined or heavily influenced by actions set in motion by her uncle, [[Peter the Great]], such as the lavish building projects in [[St. Petersburg]], funding the [[Russian Academy of Science]], and measures which generally favored the nobility, such as the repeal of a [[primogeniture]] law in 1730. In the West, Anna's reign was traditionally viewed as a continuation of the transition from the old Muscovy ways to the European court envisioned by Peter the Great.{{sfn|Baynes|1878}} Within Russia, Anna's reign is often referred to as a &quot;dark era&quot;.{{sfn|Lipski|1956|p=488}}

==Early life==
Anna was born in [[Moscow]] as the daughter of Tsar [[Ivan V of Russia|Ivan V]] by his wife [[Praskovia Saltykova]]. Ivan V was co-ruler of Russia along with his younger half-brother [[Peter the Great]], but he was mentally disabled and incapable of administering the country, and Peter effectively ruled alone. Ivan V died in February 1696, when Anna was only three years old, and [[Peter the Great|her half-uncle]] became the sole ruler of Russia.

Although Anna was the fourth child of her parents, she had only one surviving elder sister, [[Tsarevna Catherine Ivanovna of Russia|Catherine]], and one younger sister, [[Tsarevna Praskovya Ivanovna of Russia|Praskovia]]. The three girls were raised in a disciplined and austere manner by their widowed mother, a stern lady of sterling character. Born into a family of relatively modest means, [[Praskovia Saltykova]] had been an exemplary wife to a mentally challenged man, and expected her daughters to live up to her own high standards of morality and virtue.{{sfn|Longworth|1972|p=79}} Anna grew up within a milieu which cherished womanly virtue and domesticity above all else, and placed strong emphasis on thrift, charity and religious observances.{{sfn|Longworth|1972|pp=80, 81}} Her education consisted of French, German, religious texts and folklore, leavened with some music and dancing.{{sfn|Longworth|1972|p=81}} As she grew older, she developed into an obstinate girl, with a mean streak, earning her the nickname &quot;Iv-anna the Terrible&quot;. Anna was famed for her big cheek, &quot;which, as shown in her portraits&quot;, says [[Thomas Carlyle]], &quot;was comparable to a [[Westphalia]]n ham&quot;.

In time, her uncle [[Peter the great|Peter the Great]] ordered the family to move from Moscow to [[St. Petersburg]]. This meant a change of not just location but also society, and this had a significant effect on Anna. She greatly enjoyed the splendour of court and the lavishness of high society, which was very different from the austerity preferred by her mother.{{sfn|Longworth|1972|p=81}}

==Courland Regency==
In 1710, [[Peter the Great]] arranged for the 17-year-old Anna to marry [[Frederick William, Duke of Courland|Frederick William]], [[Duke of Courland]], who was about the same age as her.{{sfn|Longworth|1972|p=82}} Her wedding was held on a grand scale, as per her own inclinations, on 11 November 1710; and her uncle gave her a fabulous dowry of 200,000 roubles.{{sfn|Longworth|1972|p=82}} At the feast which followed the wedding, two dwarfs performed a parody by jumping out of enormous pies and dancing on the tables.{{sfn|Longworth|1972|p=83}}

The newly wedded couple spent several weeks in Russia before proceeding to Courland. Only twenty miles out of St. Petersburg, on the road to Courland, Duke Frederick died. The cause of death was uncertain - it has been attributed variously to a chill or to the effects of alcohol.{{sfn|Longworth|1972|p=83}}

After her husband died, Anna proceeded to Mitau (now known as [[Jelgava]]), the capital of [[Courland]] (now western [[Latvia]]) and ruled that province for almost twenty years, from 1711 to 1730. During this period, the Russian resident, [[Pyotr Bestuzhev-Ryumin|Peter Bestuzhev]], was her adviser (and sometimes lover). She never remarried after the death of her husband, but her enemies said she conducted a love affair with Duke [[Ernst Johann von Biron]], a prominent courtier, for many years.

In 1730, [[Peter II of Russia|Tsar Peter II]] (grandson of Anna's uncle [[Peter the Great]]) died childless at a young age. His death rendered extinct the male line of the [[Romanov dynasty]], which had ruled Russia for over a century, since 1613. There were five possible candidates for the throne: the three surviving daughters of [[Ivan V of Russia|Ivan V]], namely [[Tsarevna Catherine Ivanovna of Russia|Catherine]] (born 1691), Anna herself (born 1693) and [[Tsarevna Praskovya Ivanovna of Russia|Praskovya]] (born 1694), and the two surviving daughters of [[Peter the Great]], namely [[Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna of Russia|Anna]] (born 1708) and [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]] (born 1709).

Ivan V had been the older brother of Peter the Great and co-ruler with him, and by that reckoning, his daughters may be considered to have the prior claim. However, if seen from the perspective that the successor should be the nearest kin of the most recent monarch, then the daughters of Peter the Great were nearer to the throne, because they were the aunts of the recently deceased [[Peter II of Russia|Tsar Peter II]]. The dilemma was made greater because the daughters of Peter the Great had been born out of wedlock, and had been legitimized later by him, after he formally married their mother [[Catherine I of Russia|Catherine I]], who had previously been a maid in his household. On the other hand, [[Praskovia Saltykova]], the wife of Ivan V, had been a nobleman's daughter and a devoted wife and mother; moreover, she had been a lady greatly respected for her many virtues, not least her chastity.

Finally, the Russian [[Supreme Privy Council]] led by Prince [[Dmitry Mikhaylovich Golitsyn|Dmitri Golitzyn]] selected Anna, the second daughter of Ivan V, to be the new Empress of Russia. She was selected in preference to her elder sister [[Tsarevna Catherine Ivanovna of Russia|Catherine]] even though Catherine was at that time resident in Russia whereas Anna was not. There were some reasons for this: Anna was a childless widow and there was no immediate danger of an unknown foreigner wielding power in Russia; she also had some experience of government, because she had been administering her late husband's duchy of [[Courland]] for almost two decades. Catherine, on the other hand, was married to the [[Karl Leopold, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]]. She was now separated from him and living in Russia, which was in itself disgraceful; and whether her husband was present or absent, his existence could raise problems at her very coronation. His intervention in government affairs at some later point could hardly be prevented, especially since Catherine had a daughter by him. In that event, since he was ruling prince of ancient lineage with years of experience, he would not be as amenable to the council's advice as a Russian princess. Also, the fact that Catherine had a daughter already would provide a certainty of succession which the nobles perhaps preferred not to have.

The [[Supreme Privy Council]] preferred the childless and widowed Duchess of Courland. They hoped that she would feel indebted to the nobles and remain a figurehead at best, and malleable at worst. To make sure of that, the Council convinced Anna to sign a declaration of &quot;[[Conditions (Russia)|Conditions]]&quot; to her accession, modeled after a Swedish precedent, which stated that Anna was to govern according to their counsel and was not permitted to declare war, call for peace, impose new taxes or spend the revenue of the state without their consent.{{sfn|Baynes|1878}} She could not punish nobility without trial, could not make grants of estates or villages, could not appoint high officials, and could not promote anyone, whether foreign or Russian, to court offices without the consent of the council.{{sfn|Curtiss|1974|p=page needed|date=December 2016}}

The deliberations of the council were held even as Peter II lay dying of smallpox during the winter of 1729–30. The document of &quot;[[Conditions (Russia)|Conditions]]&quot; was presented to Anna in January, and she signed the same on 18 January 1730, which was just around the time of his death. The ceremony of endorsement was held at her capital, Mitau in Courland (now known as [[Jelgava]]), and she then proceeded to the Russian capital. On 20 February 1730, shortly after her arrival, Empress Anna exercised her prerogative to do away with her predecessor's Privy Council and dissolved that body. The Supreme Privy Council which had stipulated those onerous &quot;Conditions&quot; had been composed largely of the families of the princes Dolgorouki and Galitzin. Within a matter of days, another faction rose at court which was opposed to the domination of these two families. On 7 March 1730, a group of people belonging to this faction (numbering between 150 and 800 people, depending on the source) arrived at the palace and petitioned the empress to repudiate the &quot;Conditions&quot; and assume the autocracy of her predecessors.{{sfn|Baynes|1878}} Among those who urged Anna to do so was her elder sister [[Tsarevna Catherine Ivanovna of Russia|Catherine]]. Anna duly repudiated the [[Conditions (Russia)|document of Conditions]], and for good measure sent some of the framers of the document to the scaffold, and many others to [[Siberia]].{{sfn|Baynes|1878}} She then assumed autocratic powers and ruled as an absolute monarch, in the same fashion as her predecessors. On the night that Anna tore up the Conditions, an aurora borealis appeared in the sky, making the horizon &quot;appear in all blood&quot; in the words of one contemporary, which was widely taken to be a dark omen of what Anna's reign would be like.{{sfn|Moss|1997|p=253}}

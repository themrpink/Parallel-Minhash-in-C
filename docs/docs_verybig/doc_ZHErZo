Cagliari was the birthplace or residence of the composer [[Ennio Porrino]], of the film, theatre and TV director [[Nanni Loy]], and of the actors [[Gianni Agus]], [[Amedeo Nazzari]] and [[Pier Angeli]] (born Anna Maria Pierangeli).

Excluding the Roman era amphitheater, the first theater was inaugurated in Cagliari in 1767: the Teatro Zapata, later becoming the Civic Theatre. Devastated by bombing in 1943, it was recently restored, but the roof was not rebuilt, and today it serves as an open-air theatre. The Politeama Regina Margherita, inaugurated in 1859, was destroyed by fire in 1942 and never rebuilt.

Although [[opera]] had, and in part still has, a solid tradition the city, it was left without a true theater until 1993 when a new opera house, the [[Teatro Lirico di Cagliari|Teatro Lirico]], was inaugurated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teatroliricodicagliari.it/ |title=Teatro Lirico Web-site |publisher=Teatroliricodicagliari.it |date= |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside there is a music compound with a music conservatory with its own auditorium, and a music park. Cagliari is and was home to opera singers such as the [[tenor]]s [[Giovanni Matteo Mario]] (Giovanni Matteo De Candia, 1810–1883) and Piero Schiavazzi (1875–1949), the [[baritone]] Angelo Romero (born 1940), the [[contralto]] [[Bernadette Manca di Nissa]], born 1954 and the [[soprano]] Giusy Devinu (1960–2007). The Italian pop singer [[Marco Carta]] was also born in Cagliari, in 1985.

The old Teatro Massimo was only recently renovated and is now the seat of the Teatro Stabile of Sardinia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teatrostabiledellasardegna.it/index.php/spazi/teatro-massimo.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908160900/http://www.teatrostabiledellasardegna.it/index.php/spazi/teatro-massimo.html |date=8 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feast of Sant'Efis===
[[File:Mazziere del Comune di Cagliari.jpg|thumb|left|Municipal mace bearer]]
[[File:Costumi sardi.jpg|thumb|220px|Traditional folk costume of Cagliari during the Feast of St. Ephysius]]
The Feast of [[St. Ephysius]] (Sant'Efisio in Italian, Sant'Efis in Sardinian) is the most important religious event of Cagliari, taking place every year on 1 May. During this festival, thousands of people from folk groups all over Sardinia wear their traditional costumes. The saint is escorted by the traditional ancient ''Milicia'', the deputy mayor (Alter Nos), numerous confraternities, and a convoy of chariots pulled by oxen in a procession to Nora (near modern Pula), {{convert|35|km|0|abbr=on}} from Cagliari, where, according to tradition, he was beheaded. In addition to being one of the oldest, it is also the longest Italian religious procession, with about {{convert|70|km|0|abbr=on}} of walks over four days, and the largest in the Mediterranean area.

A plague was spreading throughout Sardinia, starting in 1652, and the epidemic infected Cagliari in particular, killing some ten thousand inhabitants. According to legend, in 1656 St. Ephysius appeared to the Spanish Viceroy, [[Francisco Fernández de Castro Andrade, Count of Lemos]] to request a procession on 1 May, in order to free the city from the plague. The Municipality of Cagliari swore that, if the plague disappeared, a procession would be held every day in the saint's honor, starting from the Stampace district and ending at Nora where the saint was martyred. In September the plague ended, and the procession and festival was therefore regularly held starting the following year on 1 May. The procession was held even during the last war; a statue of the saint was placed on a lorry and, through city ruins of the devastated by the bombs, arrived safely in Nora.

===Other events===
Other feasts and events in Cagliari include:
*The Carnival
*Holy Week and Easter celebrations
*Sea processions of St. Francis of Paola, held in May, and Nostra Signora di Bonaria, in July
*Cagliari Fair, in early May
*[[Audi MedCup]] regatta

===Languages===
{{main|Sardinian language|Campidanese dialect}}
The native language of Cagliari, declared official along with Italian,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sardiniapost.it/politica/cagliari-il-sardo-diventa-lingua-ufficiale-si-del-consiglio-al-nuovo-statuto/ Cagliari, il sardo diventa lingua ufficiale: il Consiglio dice sì al nuovo Statuto - Sardiniapost]&lt;/ref&gt; is [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] (''sardu''), a [[Romance language]], specifically the [[Campidanese dialect]] (''campidanesu'') in its local variant (''casteddaju'').

The variant of Cagliari in its high register has traditionally represented the linguistic model of reference for the entire southern area of the island, and the high social variant used by the middle class in the whole Campidanese domain, as well as the literary model of reference for writers and poets.
This language is less spoken by the younger generations in the city, who use Italian instead as that language is compulsory in education and the mass media. Italian has increasingly become predominant in social relations, both formal and informal, relegating Sardinian to a mostly marginal role in everyday life. Young people often have only passive competence in the language, gathered from elderly relatives who still speak it, as their parents often speak only Italian, or they may use a slang (''[[Regional Italian#Sardinia|italianu porceddinu]]'') that mixes both Sardinian and Italian.

Since Cagliari was the metropolis of the ancient Roman province, it absorbed innovations coming from Rome, Carthage, and Constantinople, and its language probably reflected late Latin urban dialects of the 5th-century core cities of the empire.

[[File:Sea food Cagliari.jpg|thumb|Seafood offered in a Cagliari restaurant]]

===Gastronomy===
Cagliari has some unique gastronomic traditions: unlike the rest of the island its cuisine is mostly based on the wide variety of locally available [[seafood]]. Although it is possible to trace influences from [[Catalan cuisine|Catalan]], [[Sicilian cuisine|Sicilian]] and Genoese cuisine, Cagliaritan food has a distinctive and unique character.

Excellent [[wine]]s are also part of Cagliaritanians' dinners, like the [[Grenache|Cannonau]], [[Nuragus di Cagliari|Nuragus]], [[Nasco di Cagliari|Nasco]], [[Monica (grape)|Monica]], Moscau, [[Girò di Cagliari|Girò]] and Malvasia, produced in the nearby vineyards of the Campidano plain.

==Media==
The main newspaper of Sardinia is ''[[L'Unione Sarda]]'', it was founded in Cagliari in 1889. It was one of the first European newspapers to have its own website in 1994. It has a circulation of about 85,000 copies.

The main regional headquarters of [[RAI]], the Italian state-owned radio and television network, is in Cagliari. There are also two regional television and radio companies as well as numerous information sites on the internet.

==Sports==
[[File:SardegnaArena.jpeg|thumb|right|220px|Internal view of the [[Sardegna Arena]], home of [[Serie A]] football club [[Cagliari Calcio]] since 2017]]
Cagliari is home to the football team [[Cagliari Calcio]], winner of the [[1969-70 Serie A|Italian league championship in 1970]], when the team was led by [[Gigi Riva]]. Founded in 1920, the club played at the [[Stadio Sant'Elia]] in the city from 1970 until it was closed in the summer of 2017, causing the club to temporarily relocate to the provisional [[Sardegna Arena]]. Sant'Elia was the venue for three [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/international/tournaments/fifa-world-cup/1990/1990-group-f.html |title=FIFA World Cup 1990 - Group F - Historical Football Kits |publisher=Historicalkits.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cagliari is an ideal location for water sports such as [[surfing]], [[kitesurfing]], [[windsurfing]] and [[sailing]] due to strong and reliable favourable winds. [[Field hockey]] is also popular, with two teams in the Italian top division, G.S. Amsicora and C.U.S. Cagliari, the first of which won the league title more often than any other Italian team in the men's championship (20) and is also the protagonist in the women's division.

Cagliari is home to all criminal, civil, administrative and accounting courts for Sardinia of the Ministry of Justice up to the High Court of Assizes of Appeal. It was home to a prison, Buon Cammino, built in the late 19th century, famous because no one has ever managed to escape. A new modern prison has been built in the nearby town of Uta.

Traditionally, votes in Cagliari are oriented towards the center-right wing. Since World War II, all the mayors belonged to the [[Democrazia Cristiana|Christian Democracy]] party with the exception of Salvatore Ferrara, from the Socialist Party, allied with the former. After the collapse of the traditional parties in the 1990s, the mayors belonged to the party or the coalition led by [[Silvio Berlusconi]]. The current economic and political crisis that affects Italy has prompted the electorate toward a large abstention and to elect a young mayor, Massimo Zedda, who belongs to a centre-left alliance. In the last municipal elections in June 2016, Massimo Zedda was confirmed in the first round with 50.86% of the votes.

==Education==
[[File:UniversitàCA.jpg|thumb|250px|&quot;''Aula Magna''&quot; of the University of Cagliari]]
Cagliari is home to the [[University of Cagliari]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Unica&quot;/&gt; the largest public university in Sardinia, founded in 1626. It currently includes six faculties: Engineering and Architecture, Medicine and Surgery, Economics, Juridical and Political Sciences, Basic Sciences, Biology and Pharmacy, Humanistic Studies.

It is attended by about 35,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.censismaster.it/media/ClassificheAtenei2012 |title=Classifica Atenei Statali 2012 |publisher=Censismaster.it |accessdate=3 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204105705/http://www.censismaster.it/media/ClassificheAtenei2012 |archivedate=4 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All science faculties of the university, as well as the university hospital, have been transferred to a new &quot;University Citadel&quot;, located in Monserrato. Cagliari's downtown houses the engineering and the humanities divisions and, in the Castle, the seat of the Rector, in an 18th-century palace with a library of thousands of ancient books.

Cagliari is also the seat of the [[Pontifical Faculty of Theology of Sardinia]] and of the [[Istituto Europeo di Design|European Institute of Design]].

Life expectancy in Cagliari is high: 79.5 years for men and 85.4 for women (provincial level).

There has been a public hospital in Cagliari since the 17th century. The first modern structure was built in the middle of the 19th century, designed by the architect [[Gaetano Cima]]. This hospital is still operating, although all its departments will eventually be transferred to the new University Hospital&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aoucagliari.it/index.php?xsl=21&amp;s=10&amp;v=9&amp;c=2785&amp;esn=Primo+piano&amp;na=1&amp;n=100&amp;o=1 |title=AouCagliari - Presidi sanitari - Presidio Policlinico Monserrato |publisher=Aoucagliari.it |accessdate=3 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402104713/http://www.aoucagliari.it/index.php?xsl=21&amp;s=10&amp;v=9&amp;c=2785&amp;esn=Primo+piano&amp;na=1&amp;n=100&amp;o=1 |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Monserrato.

Among the other public hospitals, the [[Giuseppe Brotzu]] (San Michele) Hospital&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.aobrotzu.it/index.php?xsl=51&amp;s=9&amp;v=9&amp;c=297&amp;nodesc=3&amp;n=4&amp;bx=1 |title=Azienda Ospedaliera Brotzu - Home page |publisher=Aobrotzu.it |date= |accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was recognized in 1993 as a High Specialization Nationally Relevant Hospital, particularly for [[liver transplantation|liver]], [[heart transplantation|heart]], [[pancreas transplantation|pancreas]] and [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|bone marrow transplants]].

There are in addition many private hospitals.

Despite its dry climate, thanks to the regional system of dams, every inhabitant of Cagliari may have {{convert|363|l|USgal}} per day of safe drinking water.

Waste sorting is still at a low level: only 33.4&amp;nbsp;percent of waste is separated.

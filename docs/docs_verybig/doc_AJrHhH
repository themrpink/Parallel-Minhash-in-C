Arkenstone has learned to play a variety of musical instruments, including [[bouzouki]], [[mandolin]], guitar, bass guitar, [[harp]], cello, flute, electronic keyboards, piano, Turkish [[baglama|saz]], [[pennywhistle]], [[melodica]], and [[pan pipes]]. He also plays drums and percussion and has performed some vocalizations on his albums.&lt;ref name=&quot;musicianguide&quot; /&gt;

Arkenstone is also involved in the band Troika; their sound is similar to his solo work.  The band members like to remain anonymous, although the compositions are credited to Arkenstone.

His theme &quot;The Journey Begins/Kyla's Ride&quot; was used for the FIFA World Cup France '98 broadcastings intro by the Mexican television network [[Azteca (multimedia company)|Azteca]].

His song &quot;Papillon (On the Wings of the Butterfly)&quot; is used as background music in Future World at [[Epcot]] in [[Walt Disney World]]. His song &quot;The Palace&quot; was once used as background music in [[Tomorrowland]] at the [[Magic Kingdom]] as well. &quot;The Palace&quot; also used to play in [[Tokyo Disneyland]]'s Tomorrowland, and another one of his songs, &quot;Valley in the Clouds&quot; was also used.

He signed with [[Domo Records]] and re-released the album ''Echoes of Light and Shadow'' in 2010.

Arkenstone was a member of the composing team who developed the music for [[Blizzard Activision|Blizzard Activision's]] ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' videogame's'' [[World of warcraft cataclysm|Cataclysm]]'' expansion. Along with Arkenstone, the team consists of Derek Duke, Glenn Stafford, and [[Neal Acree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video| people = Russell Brower (panel moderator)| title = Blizzard Sound panel discussion, Blizzcon| medium = Television broadcast| publisher = Blizzard Entertainment/DirecTV| location = Anaheim, California| date = 23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tangerine Dream''' is a German [[electronic music]] band founded in 1967 by [[Edgar Froese]]. The group has seen many personnel changes over the years, with Froese having been the only continuous member until his death in January 2015. 
The best-known lineup of the group was its mid-'70s trio of Froese, [[Christopher Franke]], and [[Peter Baumann]]. In 1979, [[Johannes Schmoelling]] replaced Baumann. Since Froese's death in 2015, the group has been under the leadership of [[Thorsten Quaeschning]] (Froese's chosen successor and the current longest-serving band member, having joined in 2005). He is joined by violinist [[Hoshiko Yamane]] who joined in 2011, [[Ulrich Schnauss]] who joined in 2014 and [[Brandt Brauer Frick|Paul Frick]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/tangerine-dream/paul-frick/3910750868999790/?__tn__=-R|title=Facebook|website=Facebook.com|accessdate=24 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; who joined 9 June 2020.

Tangerine Dream are considered pioneers of the early days of [[electronic music|electronica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Swan, Glenn|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/rubycon-mw0000198494|title=Rubycon - Tangerine Dream|website=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their work with the electronic music [[Ohr (record label)|Ohr label]] produced albums that had a pivotal role in the development of the German musical scene known as [[kosmische Musik|kosmische]] (&quot;cosmic&quot;). Their &quot;Virgin Years&quot;, so called because of their association with [[Virgin Records]], produced albums that further explored [[synthesizer]]s and [[music sequencer|sequencers]], including the UK top 20 albums ''[[Phaedra (album)|Phaedra]]'' (1974) and ''[[Rubycon (album)|Rubycon]]'' (1975). The group also had a successful career composing film soundtracks, creating over 60 scores, which include those for the films ''[[Sorcerer (film)|Sorcerer]]'', ''[[Thief (film)|Thief]]'', ''[[The Soldier (1982 film)|The Soldier]]'', ''[[Risky Business]]'', ''[[Flashpoint (1984 film)|Flashpoint]],'' ''[[The Keep (film)|The Keep]]'', ''[[Firestarter (film)|Firestarter]]'', ''[[Legend (1985 film)|Legend]]'', ''[[Three O'Clock High]]'', ''[[Near Dark]]'', ''[[Shy People]]'', and ''[[Miracle Mile (film)|Miracle Mile]]''.

From the late 1990s into the 2000s, Tangerine Dream continued to explore other styles of instrumental music as well as electronica. Their recorded output has been prolific, including over one hundred albums. Among other scoring projects, they helped create the soundtrack for the video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]''. Their mid-1970s work has been profoundly influential in the development of electronic music styles such as [[new-age music|new age]] (although the band themselves disliked the term) and [[electronic dance music]].

Their most recent album of all-new music, ''[[Quantum Gate (album)|Quantum Gate]]'', was released on 29 September 2017. In December 2019, the band released ''Recurring Dreams'', a compilation of new recordings of some of the band's classic compositions.

==Lineup==
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Tangerine Dream existed as several short-lived incarnations, all of which included Froese, who teamed up with several musicians from West Berlin's underground music scene, including [[Steve Jolliffe]], [[Klaus Schulze]], and [[Conrad Schnitzler]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=1162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Froese's most notable association was his partnership with [[Christopher Franke]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot;/&gt; Franke joined Tangerine Dream in 1970 after serving time in the group [[Agitation Free]], originally to replace Schulze as the drummer. Franke is credited with starting to use electronic sequencers, which were introduced on ''[[Phaedra (album)|Phaedra]]'', a development that had not only a large impact on the group's music but to many electronic musicians to this day. Franke stayed with the group for 17 years, leaving in 1988 because of exhausting touring schedules, as well as creative differences with Froese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot;/&gt;

Other long-term members of the group include [[Peter Baumann]] (1971–1977), who later went on to found the New Age label [[Private Music]], to which the band was signed from 1988 to 1991; [[Johannes Schmoelling]] (1979–1985); [[Paul Haslinger]] (1986–1990); Froese's son [[Jerome Froese]] (1990–2006); [[Linda Spa]] (1990–1996, 2005–2014), a saxophonist who appeared on numerous albums and concerts and contributed one track on ''Goblins' Club''; and most recently [[Thorsten Quaeschning]] of Picture Palace Music (2005–present).

A number of other members were also part of Tangerine Dream for shorter periods of time. Unlike session musicians, these players also contributed to compositions of the band during their tenures. Some of the more notable members are Steve Schroyder (organist, 1971–1972), [[Michael Hoenig]] (who replaced Baumann for a 1975 Australian tour and a London concert, included on ''Bootleg Box Set Vol. 1''), [[Steve Jolliffe]] (wind instruments, keyboards and vocals on ''Cyclone'' and the following tour; he was also part of a short-lived 1969 line-up), Klaus Krüger (drummer on ''Cyclone'' and ''Force Majeure'') and [[Ralf Wadephul]] (in collaboration with Edgar Froese recorded album ''Blue Dawn'', but it was released only in 2006; also credited for one track on ''Optical Race'' (1988) and toured with the band in support of this album).

Throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s, Tangerine Dream was often joined on stage by Zlatko Perica or Gerald Gradwohl on guitars, and Emil Hachfeld on electronic drums. Jerome Froese left in 2006 after a concert at the Tempodrom in Berlin. Until late 2014, Tangerine Dream comprised Edgar Froese, as well as Thorsten Quaeschning, who first collaborated in the composition of ''Jeanne d'Arc'' (2005). For concerts and recordings, they were usually joined by [[Linda Spa]] on saxophone and flute, Iris Camaa on drums and percussion, and [[Bernhard Beibl]] on guitar. In 2011, electric violinist [[Hoshiko Yamane]] was added to the lineup and is featured on some of the most recent albums.&lt;ref name=T&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Telepolis]] |language=German |url=https://www.heise.de/tp/features/Musik-aus-geordneten-Geraeuschen-3813791.html?seite=2 |title=Musik aus geordneten Geräuschen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2014, Bernhard Beibl announced on his [[Facebook]] page that he would stop collaborating with Tangerine Dream. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that Tangerine Dream would no longer be touring with Linda Spa or Iris Camaa, but that [[Ulrich Schnauss]] had been brought into the fold. Edgar Froese's death in January 2015, however, left this a short-lived line-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tangerine Dream founder Edgar Froese dies |newspaper=The Guardian |date=23 January 2015 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/23/tangerine-dream-founder-edgar-froese-dies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origins: Psychedelia and krautrock===
Edgar Froese arrived in [[West Berlin]] in the mid-1960s to study art. His first band, the [[psychedelic rock]]-styled ''The Ones'', disbanded after releasing only one single. After The Ones, Froese experimented with musical ideas, playing smaller gigs with a variety of musicians. Most of these performances were in the famous [[Zodiak Free Arts Lab]], although one grouping also had the distinction of being invited to play for the surrealist painter [[Salvador Dalí]]. The music was partnered with literature, painting, early forms of [[multimedia]], and more. It seemed as though only the most outlandish ideas attracted any attention, leading Froese to comment: &quot;In the absurd often lies what is artistically possible.&quot; As members of the group came and went, the direction of the music continued to be inspired by the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]], and the group came to be called by the surreal-sounding name of Tangerine Dream, inspired by mishearing the line &quot;tangerine trees and marmalade skies&quot; from [[the Beatles]]' track &quot;[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;derogatis&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Jim |last=DeRogatis |authorlink=Jim DeRogatis |title=Turn on Your Mind: Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock |date=2003 |location=Milwaukee |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |page=263 |isbn=0-634-05548-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Froese was fascinated by technology and skilled in using it to create music. He built [[custom-made instrument]]s and, wherever he went, collected sounds with tape recorders for use in constructing musical works later. His early work with tape loops and other repeating sounds was the obvious precursor to the emerging technology of the [[music sequencer|sequencer]], which Tangerine Dream quickly adopted upon its arrival.

The first Tangerine Dream album, ''[[Electronic Meditation]]'', was a tape-collage [[Krautrock]] piece, using the technology of the time rather than the synthesized music they later became famous for. The line-up for the album was Froese, Klaus Schulze, and [[Conrad Schnitzler]]. ''Electronic Meditation'' was published by Ohr in 1970 and began the period known as the ''Pink Years'' (the Ohr logo was a pink ear). Subsequent albums, beginning with ''[[Alpha Centauri (album)|Alpha Centauri]]'', relied heavily on electronic instruments. The band's music during the early 1970s prominently featured organ from Steve Schroyder (on ''Alpha Centauri'') or [[Peter Baumann]] (on subsequent releases), commonly augmented by guitar from Froese and drums from [[Christopher Franke]]. They also started their heavy usage of the [[Mellotron]] during this period.&lt;ref name=&quot;phase1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Stump |first=Paul |title=Digital Gothic: A Critical Discography of Tangerine Dream |date=1999 |publisher=Firefly Publishing |isbn= 0-946719-18-7 |pages=29–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise to fame: The Virgin years===
The band's 1973 album ''[[Atem (album)|Atem]]'' was named as ''Album of the Year'' by British DJ [[John Peel]], and this attention helped Tangerine Dream to sign to the fledgling [[Virgin Records]] in the same year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot;/&gt; Soon afterward they released the album ''[[Phaedra (album)|Phaedra]]'', an eerie soundscape that unexpectedly reached No. 15 in the [[UK Albums Chart]] and became one of Virgin's first bona fide hits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot;/&gt; ''Phaedra'' was one of the first commercial albums to feature sequencers and came to define much more than just the band's own sound. The creation of the album's title track was something of an accident: the band was experimenting in the studio with a recently acquired [[Moog synthesizer]], and the tape happened to be rolling at the time. They kept the results and later added flute, bass guitar, and [[Mellotron]] performances. The Moog, like many other early synthesizers, was so sensitive to changes in temperature that its oscillators would drift badly in tuning as the equipment warmed up, and this drift can easily be heard on the final recording. This album marked the beginning of the period known as the 'Virgin Years'.

Their mid-1970s work has been profoundly influential in the development of electronic music styles such as [[new-age music|new age]] (although the band themselves disliked the term)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fatali |first=Liberi |title=Tangerine Dream: Madcap's Flaming Duty |work=Sputnikmusic |url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/15463/Tangerine-Dream-Madcaps-Flaming-Duty/ |accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[electronic dance music]].&lt;ref name=&quot;independent&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Perrone, Pierre|title=Edgar Froese : Leader of electronic band Tangerine Dream whose influence has been felt for more than four decades|date=27 January 2015|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/edgar-froese-leader-of-electronic-band-tangerine-dream-whose-influence-has-been-felt-for-more-than-10006676.html|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=17 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, along with other electronic music pioneers such as [[Jean-Michel Jarre]] (with whom Edgar Froese collaborated on Jarre's 2015 album ''[[Electronica 1: The Time Machine]]'') and [[Vangelis]], the band were early adopters of the new [[Digital data|digital]] technology, which revolutionized the sound of the synthesizer, although the group had been using digital equipment (in some shape or form) as early as the mid-1970s. Their technical competence and extensive experience in their early years with self-made instruments and unusual means of creating sounds meant that they were able to exploit this new technology to make music quite unlike anything heard before.

===Tangerine Dream live===
Tangerine Dream's earliest concerts were visually simple by modern standards, with three men sitting motionless for hours alongside massive electronic boxes festooned with patch cords and a few flashing lights. Some concerts were even performed in complete darkness, as happened during the performance at [[York Minster]] on 20 October 1975. As time went on and technology advanced, the concerts became much more elaborate, with visual effects, lighting, lasers, pyrotechnics, and projected images. By 1977 their North American tour featured full-scale [[Laserium]] effects.

Through the 1970s and 1980s, the band toured extensively. The concerts generally included large amounts of unreleased and improvised material and were consequently widely [[Bootleg recording|bootlegged]]. They were notorious for playing extremely loudly (reaching 134&amp;nbsp;dB in 1976){{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} and for a long time. The band released recordings of a fair number of their concerts, and on some of these the band worked out material that would later form the backbone of their studio recordings. (For example, ''Pergamon'', which documents a concert given in East Berlin shortly after Johannes Schmoelling joined the group, contains themes that would appear later on ''[[Tangram (album)|Tangram]]''.) An early example of this was the ''Ricochet'' album, which was recorded during a tour that included European cathedrals, with some later overdubbing.

===Forays into vocals===
[[File:E-mu Audity.jpg|thumb|right|The [[E-mu Audity]] synthesizer, commissioned by Peter Baumann in 1979]]
Most of Tangerine Dream's albums are entirely instrumental.  Three albums that prominently featured lyrics were ''[[Cyclone (Tangerine Dream album)|Cyclone]]'' (1978),&lt;ref name=UC&gt;{{cite web|work=Uncut|url=https://www.uncut.co.uk/reviews/album/tangerine-dream-search-hades-virgin-%E2%80%A8recordings-1973-1979|title=Tangerine Dream – In Search Of Hades: The Virgin Recordings 1973–1979|author=Pinnock, Tom|date=June 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Tyger (album)|Tyger]]'' and ''[[Under Cover – Chapter One]]''. While there have occasionally been a few vocals on the band's other releases, such as the track &quot;Kiew Mission&quot; from 1981's ''[[Exit (Tangerine Dream album)|Exit]]'' and &quot;The Harbor&quot; from 1987's ''[[Shy People]]'', the group only recently returned to featuring vocals in a musical trilogy based on [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' and their 2007 album ''[[Madcap's Flaming Duty]]''.

After their 1980 [[East Berlin]] gig, when they became one of the first major Western bands to perform in a communist country.  Tangerine Dream released a double live album of one of their performances there, called ''[[Poland (album)|Poland]]'', recorded during their tour in the winter at the end of 1983. With ''Poland'', the band moved to the Jive Electro label, marking the beginning of the ''Blue Years''.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

===Soundtracks===
Throughout the 1980s, Tangerine Dream composed scores for more than 20 films. This had been an interest of Froese's since the late 1960s, when he scored an obscure Polish film, as well as appearing as an actor in several German underground films. He made the score for the experimental film &quot;Never shoot the bathroom man&quot;, directed by Jürgen Polland. Many of the group's soundtracks were composed at least partially of reworked material from the band's studio albums or work that was in progress for upcoming albums; see, for example, the resemblance between the track &quot;Igneous&quot; on their soundtrack for ''[[Thief (soundtrack)|Thief]]'' and the track &quot;Thru Metamorphic Rocks&quot; on their studio release ''[[Force Majeure (Tangerine Dream album)|Force Majeure]]''. Their first exposure on U.S. television came when a track for the then in-progress album ''[[Le Parc (album)|Le Parc]]'' was used as the theme for the television program ''[[Street Hawk]]''. Some of the more famous soundtracks have been ''[[Sorcerer (soundtrack)|Sorcerer]]'', ''[[Thief (soundtrack)|Thief]]'', ''[[Legend (Tangerine Dream soundtrack)|Legend]]'', ''[[Risky Business (soundtrack)|Risky Business]]'', ''[[The Keep (Tangerine Dream album)|The Keep]]'',&lt;ref name=U&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/03/movies/tangerine-dreams-music-in-bamcinematek-series.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=Underscoring the Drama in the Dark |author=Rapold, Nicolas |date=June 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Firestarter (soundtrack)|Firestarter]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A0CE0DD1E38F932A25756C0A962948260 |title=SCREEN: 'FIRESTARTER', A STEPHEN KING STORY |authorlink=Vincent Canby |author=Canby, Vincent |date=May 11, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Flashpoint (1984 film)|Flashpoint]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9805E3DB1038F932A0575BC0A962948260 |title=SCREEN: 'FLASHPOINT', WITH KRIS KRISTOFFERSON |authorlink=Janet Maslin |author=Maslin, Janet |date=August 31, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;, ''[[Heartbreakers (1984 film)|Heartbreakers]]'', ''[[Shy People]]'' and ''[[Near Dark]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B0DE0D71439F937A35753C1A961948260 |title=Film: 'Near Dark', a Tale of Vampires on the Road |author=James, Caryn |date=October 4, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite film|title=Film: 'Identification of a Woman' |author=Michelangelo, Antonioni |date=October 21, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tangerine Dream also composed the soundtrack score for the video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamescores&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=Shamoon, Evan |title=Inside The Grand Theft Auto V Soundtrack |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=28 August 2013 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/inside-the-grand-theft-auto-v-soundtrack-20130828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Tangerine Dream released their own version of the [[theme music]] for the television series ''[[Stranger Things]]''.&lt;ref name=RS&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/hear-tangerine-dreams-eerie-take-on-stranger-things-theme-w439301 |title=Hear Tangerine Dream's Spooky Cover of 'Stranger Things' Theme |author=Kreps, Daniel |date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tangerine Dream had inspired music for the series.&lt;ref name=RS/&gt;

Several of the band's albums released during the 1990s were nominated for Grammy Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{allmusic |last=Brenholts |first=Jim |title= Tangerine Dream — The Grammy Nominated Albums |date=2014 |id=the-grammy-nominated-albums-mw0000616820}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Tangerine Dream with Jerome Froese took a directional change away from the new-age leanings of those albums and toward an electronica style. After Jerome's departure, founder Edgar Froese steered the band in a direction somewhat reminiscent of material throughout their career.

In later years, Tangerine Dream released albums in series. The ''Dream Mixes'' series began in 1995 with the last being released in 2010. The ''Divine Comedy'' series, based on the writings of Dante Alighieri, spanned 2002–2006. From 2007 to 2010, the ''Five Atomic Seasons'' were released. Most recently, the ''Eastgate Sonic Poems'' series, based on the works of famous poetic authors such as Edgar Allan Poe and Franz Kafka, began in 2011, with the last appearing in 2013. Also, beginning in 2007, Tangerine Dream released a number of EPs, referred to as &quot;CupDiscs&quot; by the band.

Edgar Froese also released a number of solo recordings, which are similar in style to Tangerine Dream's work. Jerome Froese released a number of singles as TDJ Rome, which are similar to his work within the ''Dream Mixes'' series. In 2005 he released his first solo album ''Neptunes'' under the name Jerome Froese.  In 2006 Jerome left Tangerine Dream to concentrate on his solo career. His second solo album ''Shiver Me Timbers'' was released on 29 October 2007, and his third, ''Far Side of the Face'', was released in 2012. Beginning in 2011, Jerome Froese joined with former Tangerine Dream member Johannes Schmoelling and keyboardist Robert Waters to form the band Loom, which plays original material, as well as Tangerine Dream classics. Thorsten Quaeschning, leader of Picture Palace Music, was brought into Tangerine Dream in 2005 and contributed to most of the band's albums and CupDiscs since then.

The group had recording contracts with Ohr, Virgin, [[Jive Electro]], Private Music, and Miramar, and many of the minor soundtracks were released on Varèse Sarabande. In 1996, the band founded their own record label, '''TDI''', and more recently, '''Eastgate'''. Subsequent albums are today generally not available in normal retail channels but are sold by [[mail-order]] or through online channels. The same applies to their Miramar releases, the rights to which the band bought back. Meanwhile, their Ohr and Jive Electro catalogs (known as the &quot;Pink&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; Years) are currently owned by [[Esoteric Recordings]].

===After Edgar Froese's death===
Edgar Froese died suddenly in [[Vienna]] on 20 January 2015 from a [[pulmonary embolism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;guardianobit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/23/tangerine-dream-founder-edgar-froese-dies|title=Tangerine Dream founder Edgar Froese dies|work=The Guardian|date=23 January 2015|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/Music/article/rip_tangerine_dreams_edgar_froese|title=R.I.P.

==Artistic connections==

===Influences===
Tangerine Dream began as a surreal rock band, with each of the members contributing different musical influences and styles. Edgar Froese's guitar style was inspired by [[Jimi Hendrix]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Joyce |first=Mike |title=Spotlight; The Group With a Synth Of Adventure; Tangerine Dream's Long Electronic Music Quest |work=The Washington Post |date=7 September 1988 |url=http://www.arm.ac.uk/~ath/music/td/postings/td_washingtonpost.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Christopher Franke contributed the more [[avant garde]] elements of [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] and [[Terry Riley]]. [[Yes (band)|Yes]]-like progressive rock influence was brought in by [[Steve Jolliffe]] on ''Cyclone''. The sample-based sound collages of Johannes Schmoelling drew their inspiration from a number of sources; one instance is [[Steve Reich]]'s [[Music for 18 Musicians]] on parts of ''[[Logos Live]]'', and the track &quot;[[Love on a Real Train]]&quot; from the ''[[Risky Business]]'' soundtrack.&lt;ref name=KQED&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[KQED]]|url=https://www.kqed.org/arts/12014754/steve-reichs-turning-80-heres-where-youve-heard-him-before|title=Steve Reich's Turning 80 — Here's Where You've Heard Him Before|author=Pope, Shelby|date=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical music has had an influence on the sound of Tangerine Dream over the years. [[György Ligeti]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Iannis Xenakis]], [[Maurice Ravel]], and [[Arcangelo Corelli]] are clearly visible as dominant influences in the early albums. A Baroque sensibility sometimes informs the more coordinated sequencer patterns, which has its most direct expression in the [[La Folia]] section that comes at the very end of the title track of Force Majeure. In live performances, the piano solos often directly quoted from Romantic classical works for piano, such as the Beethoven and Mozart snippets in much of the late 1970s – early 1980s stage shows. In the bootleg recording of the [[Mannheim]] Mozartsaal concert of 1976 ([[Tangerine Tree]] volume 13), the first part of the first piece also clearly quotes from [[Franz Liszt]]'s ''[[Totentanz (Liszt)|Totentanz]]''. The first phrase is played on a harpsichord synthesizer patch and is answered by the second half of the phrase in a flute voicing on a [[Mellotron]]. During the 1990s, many releases included recordings of classical compositions: [[Pictures at an Exhibition]] (on ''[[Turn of the Tides]]''), [[Ombra mai fù|Largo (from Xerxes)]] (on ''[[Tyranny of Beauty]]''), Symphony in A Minor (by J. S. Bach), and Concerto in A Major / Adagio (by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]) (both on ''[[Ambient Monkeys]]'').

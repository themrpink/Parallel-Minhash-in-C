{{Main|List of British royal residences}}
The sovereign's official residence in London is [[Buckingham Palace]]. It is the site of most state banquets, investitures, royal christenings and other ceremonies.&lt;ref name=&quot;BuckinghamPalace&quot;&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/BuckinghamPalace/BuckinghamPalace.aspx |title=Buckingham Palace |accessdate=14 July 2009 |work=Official website of the British Monarchy |publisher=The Royal Household |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327220845/http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/BuckinghamPalace/BuckinghamPalace.aspx |archivedate=27 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another official residence is [[Windsor Castle]], the largest occupied castle in the world,&lt;ref name=&quot;WindsorCastle&quot;&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/WindsorCastle/WindsorCastle.aspx|title=Windsor Castle|accessdate=14 July 2009|work=Official website of the British Monarchy|publisher=The Royal Household}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is used principally at weekends, Easter and during [[Ascot Racecourse|Royal Ascot]], an annual race meeting that is part of the [[Season (society)|social calendar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WindsorCastle&quot;/&gt; The sovereign's official residence in Scotland is the [[Holyrood Palace|Palace of Holyroodhouse]] in [[Edinburgh]]. The monarch stays at Holyrood for at least one week each year, and when visiting Scotland on state occasions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holyroodhouse&quot;&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/ThePalaceofHolyroodhouse/ThePalaceofHolyroodhouse.aspx|title=The Palace of Holyroodhouse|accessdate=14 July 2009|work=Official website of the British Monarchy|publisher=The Royal Household}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the [[Palace of Westminster]] and the [[Tower of London]] were the main residences of the English Sovereign until Henry VIII acquired the [[Palace of Whitehall]]. Whitehall was destroyed by fire in 1698, leading to a shift to [[St James's Palace]]. Although replaced as the monarch's primary London residence by Buckingham Palace in 1837, St James's is still the senior palace&lt;ref name=&quot;StJamessPalace&quot;&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/StJamessPalace/StJamessPalace.aspx |title=Royal Residences: St. James's Palace|accessdate=14 July 2009|work=Official website of the British Monarchy|publisher=The Royal Household}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remains the ceremonial Royal residence. For example, foreign ambassadors are accredited to the [[Court of St James's]],&lt;ref name=&quot;BuckinghamPalace&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/RoyalEventsandCeremonies/Audiences/Ambassadorscredentials.aspx |title=Ambassadors credentials |accessdate=14 July 2009 |work=Official website of the British Monarchy |publisher=The Royal Household |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309035640/http://www.royal.gov.uk/RoyalEventsandCeremonies/Audiences/Ambassadorscredentials.aspx |archivedate=9 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Palace is the site of the meeting of the [[Accession Council]].&lt;ref name=accessioncouncil/&gt; It is also used by other members of the Royal Family.&lt;ref name=&quot;StJamessPalace&quot;/&gt;

Other residences include [[Clarence House]] and [[Kensington Palace]]. The palaces belong to the Crown; they are held in trust for future rulers, and cannot be sold by the monarch.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.hrp.org.uk/aboutus/whoweare/history.aspx|title=A brief history of Historic Royal Palaces|accessdate=20 April 2008|publisher=Historic Royal Palaces|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218040250/http://www.hrp.org.uk/aboutus/whoweare/history.aspx|archivedate=18 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sandringham House]] in [[Norfolk]] and [[Balmoral Castle]] in [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|Aberdeenshire]] are privately owned by the Queen.&lt;ref name=res/&gt;

==Style==
{{Main|Style of the British sovereign}}
The present sovereign's full style and title is &quot;Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Royal proclamation reciting the altered Style and Titles of the Crown&lt;/ref&gt; The title &quot;[[Head of the Commonwealth]]&quot; is held by the Queen personally, and is not vested in the British Crown.&lt;ref name=hoc/&gt; [[Pope Leo X]] first granted the title &quot;[[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]]&quot; to King Henry VIII in 1521, rewarding him for his support of the Papacy during the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation]], particularly for his book the [[Defence of the Seven Sacraments]].&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, p.180&lt;/ref&gt; After Henry broke from the Roman Church, [[Pope Paul III]] revoked the grant, but Parliament passed a law authorising its continued use.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.archontology.org/nations/england/king_england/01_kingstyle_1521.php|title=Royal Styles: 1521–1553|accessdate=10 October 2008|date=18 August 2007|publisher=Archontology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sovereign is known as &quot;His Majesty&quot; or &quot;Her Majesty&quot;. The form &quot;[[Britannic Majesty]]&quot; appears in international treaties and on [[British passport|passports]] to differentiate the British monarch from foreign rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Passports |url=https://www.royal.uk/passports |publisher= Official web site of the British Monarch |accessdate=30 October 2018 |language=en |date=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thorpe |first1=Robert |title=A commentary on the treatises entered into between his Britannic majesty, and his most faithful majesty ... his catholic majesty ... and ... the king of the Netherlands ... for the purpose of preventing their subjects from engaging in any illicit traffic in slaves |date=1819 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f0cVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PP1 |accessdate=30 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monarch chooses his or her [[regnal name]], not necessarily his or her first name – [[George VI]], [[Edward VII]] and [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]] did not use their first names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Panton |first1=James |title=Historical Dictionary of the British Monarchy |date=2011 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=9780810874978 |page=392 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BiyyueBTpaMC&amp;pg=PA392 |accessdate=31 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If only one monarch has used a particular name, no [[Regnal number|ordinal]] is used; for example, Queen Victoria is not known as &quot;Victoria I&quot;, and ordinals are not used for English monarchs who reigned before the Norman conquest of England. The question of whether numbering for British monarchs is based on previous English or Scottish monarchs was raised in 1953 when Scottish nationalists challenged the Queen's use of &quot;Elizabeth II&quot;, on the grounds that there had never been an &quot;Elizabeth I&quot; in Scotland. In ''[[MacCormick v Lord Advocate]]'', the Scottish [[Court of Session]] ruled against the plaintiffs, finding that the Queen's title was a matter of her own choice and prerogative. The Home Secretary told the House of Commons that monarchs since the Acts of Union had consistently used the higher of the English and Scottish ordinals, which in the applicable four cases has been the English ordinal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1953/mar/03/royal-titles-bill Royal Titles Bill]. ''[[Hansard]]'', 3 March 1953, vol. 512, col. 251&lt;/ref&gt; The prime minister confirmed this practice, but noted that &quot;neither The Queen nor her advisers could seek to bind their successors&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1953/apr/15/royal-style-and-title Royal Style and Title]. ''Hansard'', 15 April 1953, vol. 514, col. 199&lt;/ref&gt; Future monarchs will apply this policy.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Debrett's]]'', 2008 edition, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arms==
{{Main|Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom}}
The [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]] are &quot;Quarterly, I and IV Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or [for England]; II Or a lion rampant within a double tressure flory-counter-flory Gules [for Scotland]; III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent [for Ireland]&quot;. The supporters are [[the Lion and the Unicorn]]; the motto is &quot;[[Dieu et mon droit]]&quot; (French: &quot;God and my Right&quot;). Surrounding the shield is a representation of a [[Garter (stockings)|Garter]] bearing the motto of the [[Chivalric order]] of the same name; &quot;[[Honi soit qui mal y pense]]&quot;. ([[Old French]]: &quot;Shame be to him who thinks evil of it&quot;). In Scotland, the monarch uses an alternative form of the arms in which quarters I and IV represent Scotland, II England, and III Ireland. The mottoes are &quot;In Defens&quot; (an abbreviated form of the [[Scots language|Scots]] &quot;[[In My Defens God Me Defend]]&quot;) and the motto of the [[Order of the Thistle]], &quot;[[Nemo me impune lacessit]]&quot; ([[Latin]]: &quot;No-one provokes me with impunity&quot;); the supporters are the unicorn and lion, who support both the [[escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] and [[lance]]s, from which fly the flags of [[flag of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[flag of England|England]].

'''Anthony L. Ray''' (born August 12, 1963), better known by his stage name '''Sir Mix-a-Lot''', is an American rapper, songwriter, and recording producer. He is best known for his 1992 hit song &quot;[[Baby Got Back]]&quot;, which peaked at number one on the ''[[Billboard Hot 100]]''.

==Early life==
Anthony Ray was born on August 12, 1963, in [[Auburn, Washington]], a suburb of [[Seattle]], and grew up in Seattle's Central District. Growing up, Ray's mother worked as a licensed practical nurse (LPN) at the King County Jail making 6 or 7 dollars an hour. Ray was a fan of [[hip hop]] and started rhyming in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/sir-mix-a-lot/biography/| title=Sir Mix-a-Lot Biography| accessdate=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While living in the Bryant Manor apartments on 19th Ave and East Yesler Way, Anthony Ray started school at [[Roosevelt High School (Seattle)|Roosevelt High School]], near the University District, when the Seattle Public School District was in the throes of what would be a 21-year experiment to integrate the school system. Students were bused from their neighborhoods to schools at the other end of the city. From 1978, when the busing program started, to 1999, when it was shelved, minorities carried the burden of busing, piling onto buses from the South End and the Central Area that were headed for predominantly white schools in the North End.&lt;ref name=&quot;Busing Blues&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url= http://kuow.org/post/busing-blues-when-seattle-sent-black-kids-white-north-end| title=Busing Blues| accessdate=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ray said he knew that some North End residents didn't want black kids bused into their neighborhoods. But for him, the experience offered respite from the projects. &quot;I’ve heard things like, 'Forced integration is not good,' 'I want my kid to be able to go to school in our community; that’s why we moved here' – all those things I totally understand,&quot; he said. &quot;But from my perspective, I didn’t have the luxury of living in a neighborhood where a good school was. We didn’t make that kind of money. So from my perspective, it was the best thing that could have happened to me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Busing Blues&quot;/&gt; A music teacher at Eckstein Middle School introduced Ray to the possibility of a music career. Before becoming a rapper, Ray at an early age was interested in electronics and CB radio, one of his early jobs was working at a pinball arcade servicing machines, during that time he also started to fix keyboards and other musical equipment. He still works with electronics as a hobby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |host=Bomani Jones|title=Sir Mix-A-Lot|website=ESPN|publisher=ESPN Radio|date=19 August 2018|time=12:24 |url=http://www.espn.com/espnradio/play/_/id/23862570 |accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1980s===
Early on, Sir Mix-A-Lot had an ear and a passion for music.  Soon after high school he began DJing parties at local community centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=50163| title=Going Way Back A Brief History of 206 Hiphop| accessdate=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1983 Mix-A-Lot had begun playing weekends regularly at the Rainier Vista Boys and Girls Club in South Seattle. Soon he moved locations and started throwing his parties at the Rotary Boys and Girls Club in the Central District.  It was there that he met 'Nasty' Nes Rodriguez, a local radio DJ and host of Fresh Tracks, the West Coast's first rap radio show on Seattle station KKFX (KFOX).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.blackpast.org/aaw/sir-mix-lot-ray-anthony-1963| title=Sir Mix-A-Lot / Ray, Anthony| accessdate=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Mix-a-Lot partnered with Nasty Nes and local businessman Ed Locke to found the Nastymix record label in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Blecha |first1=Peter |title=Nastymix Records' party marks Gold Record awarded to Sir Mix-A-Lot's SWASS album on April 29, 1989 |url=https://www.historylink.org/File/9793 |website=www.historylink.org |accessdate=1 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first song to gain popularity outside of Seattle was &quot;Square Dance Rap&quot; in 1986. Mix-a-Lot had originally decided to rap the entire song slow, then speed and pitch it up in post production, Mix later told Seattle Refined in 2018 that &quot;I didn't want to rap, that's why I use this weird Smurf voice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Karlinsky |first1=Malia |title=Rapping with the King of Old School: Seattle's own Sir Mix-A-Lot |url=http://seattlerefined.com/lifestyle/rapping-with-the-king-of-old-school-aka-seattles-sir-mix-a-lot |website=Seattle Refined |publisher=Sinclair Broadcast Group |accessdate=1 April 2019 |date=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the song was picked up by DJs in clubs nationwide, he went touring in Florida, New York, and other states. While in Arizona, he noticed a street named Broadway with a restaurant named Dick's, just like Seattle. This gave him the idea to write his next hit &quot;Posse on Broadway&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weingarten |first1=Christopher R. |title=Best of '88: How Sir-Mix-A-Lot's 'Posse on Broadway' Put Seattle on Rap's Map |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/best-of-88-sir-mix-a-lot-posse-on-broadway-751314/ |website=Rolling Stone |accessdate=1 April 2019 |date=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mix-a-Lot's next hit, released in 1987, was the single &quot;[[Posse on Broadway]],&quot;  whose title referred to [[Broadway (Seattle)|Broadway]] in Seattle's [[Capitol Hill, Seattle, Washington|Capitol Hill]] district.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Huey|first=Steve|title=Sir Mix-A-Lot – Biography|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p96|pure_url=yes}}|website=[[AllMusic]]|year=2003|accessdate=2015-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song made the Top 100 but quickly disappeared, although it remains popular in the Seattle area for its references to many local landmarks.

''[[Swass]]'', Sir Mix-a-Lot's debut album, was released in 1988 with two other singles: &quot;Square-Dance Rap&quot; and a hip hop cover of the [[Black Sabbath]] song &quot;[[Iron Man (song)|Iron Man]]&quot; backed by the band [[Metal Church]].&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;/&gt;  In 1990, the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] certified ''Swass'' [[platinum record|platinum]].&lt;ref name=RIAA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&amp;table=SEARCH_RESULTS&amp;action=&amp;title=&amp;artist=Sir%20Mix%20a%20Lot&amp;format=&amp;debutLP=&amp;category=&amp;sex=&amp;releaseDate=&amp;requestNo=&amp;type=&amp;level=&amp;label=&amp;company=&amp;certificationDate=&amp;awardDescription=&amp;catalogNo=&amp;aSex=&amp;rec_id=&amp;charField=&amp;gold=&amp;platinum=&amp;multiPlat=&amp;level2=&amp;certDate=&amp;album=&amp;id=&amp;after=&amp;before=&amp;startMonth=1&amp;endMonth=1&amp;startYear=1958&amp;endYear=2009&amp;sort=Artist&amp;perPage=25|title=Gold &amp; Platinum|publisher=RIAA|accessdate=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Seminar (album)|Seminar]]'', released in 1989 featured &quot;My Hooptie&quot;, &quot;Beepers&quot;, &quot;Gortex&quot; and &quot;I Got Game&quot;.

===Reproduction and life expectancy===
[[File:wildebeest calves, Kruger.jpg|thumb|left|Most artiodactyls, such as the [[wildebeest]], are born with hair.|alt=Roaming wildebeests]]
Generally, even-toed ungulates tend to have long [[gestation period]]s, smaller litter sizes, and more highly developed newborns. As with many other mammals, species in [[Temperate climate|temperate]] or [[Polar climate|polar]] regions have a fixed [[mating season]], while those in [[Tropics|tropical]] areas breed year-round. They carry out polygynous mating behavior, meaning a male mates with several females and suppresses all competition.

The length of the gestation period varies from four to five months for porcine, deer, and musk deer; six to ten months for hippos, deer, and bovines; ten to thirteen months with camels; and fourteen to fifteen months with giraffes. Most deliver one or two babies, but some pigs can deliver up to ten.

The newborns are [[precocial]] (born relatively mature) and come with open eyes and are hairy (with the exception of the hairless hippos). Juvenile deer and pigs have striped or spotted coats; the pattern disappears as they grow older. The juveniles of some species spend their first weeks with their mother in a safe location, where others may be running and following the herd within a few hours or days.

The life expectancy is typically twenty to thirty years; as in many mammals, smaller species often have a shorter lifespan than larger species. The artiodactyls with the longest lifespans are the hippos, cows, and camels, which can live 40 to 50 years.

===Predators and parasites===
Artiodactyls have different [[natural predator]]s depending on their size and habitat. There are several [[carnivore]]s that would prey on such animals, including as [[large cat]]s (e.g., [[lion]]s) and [[bear]]s. Other predators are [[crocodile]]s, [[wolves]], large [[raptor (bird)|raptors]], and for small species and young animals, large [[snake]]s.

[[Parasitism|Parasites]] include [[nematode]]s, [[botflies]], [[flea]]s, [[Louse|lice]], or [[fluke (parasite)|flukes]], but they have debilitating effects only when the infestation is severe.

==Interactions with humans==

===Domestication===
{{See also|Domestication of animals}}
[[File:Ardiak bazkan ari dira.JPG|thumb|Some artiodactyls, like [[sheep]], have been domesticated for thousands of years.|alt=Sheep on a farm]]

Artiodactyls have been hunted by primitive humans for various reasons: for meat or [[Fur clothing|fur]], as well as to use their bones and teeth as weapons or tools. Their [[domestication]] began around 8000 BCE. To date, humans have domesticated goats, sheep, cattle, camels, llamas, alpacas, and pigs. Initially, livestock was used primarily for food, but they began being used for work activities around 3000 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Artiodactyl | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica Online | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] | year = 2008 | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/37203/artiodactyl | accessdate=2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clear evidence exists of antelope being used for food 2 million years ago in the [[Olduvai Gorge]], part of the [[Kenyan Rift Valley|Great Rift Valley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Humans hunted for meat 2 million years ago|url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/sep/23/human-hunting-evolution-2million-years|newspaper = The Guardian|accessdate = 2015-10-26|first1 = Robin|last1 = McKie|first2 = Science|last2 = Editor|date = 2012-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cro-Magnon]]s relied heavily on reindeer for food, skins, tools, and weapons; with dropping temperatures and increased reindeer numbers at the end of the Pleistocene, they became the prey of choice. Reindeer remains accounted for 94% of bones and teeth found in a cave above the [[Céou River]] that was inhabited around 12,500 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/09/030923065212.htm |title=Bones From French Cave Show Neanderthals, Cro-Magnon Hunted Same Prey |publisher=ScienceDaily |year=2003 |accessdate=17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, artiodactyls are kept primarily for their meat, milk, and [[wool]], fur, or [[hide (skin)|hide]] for clothing. Domestic cattle, the [[water buffalo]], the [[yak]], and camels are used for work, as rides, or as [[pack animal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Clay, J. |year=2004 |title=World Agriculture and the Environment: A Commodity-by-Commodity Guide to Impacts and Practices |location=Washington, D.C., USA |publisher=Island Press |isbn=978-1-55963-370-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2016}}

===Threats===
[[File:Ur-painting.jpg|thumb|The [[aurochs]] has been extinct since the 17th century.|alt=Painting of an aurochs]]

The endangerment level of each even-toed ungulate is different. Some species are [[synanthropic]] (such as the [[wild boar]]) and have spread into areas that they are not indigenous to, either having been brought as farm animals or having run away as people's pets. Some artiodactyls also benefit from the fact that their predators (e.g. the [[Thylacine|Tasmanian tiger]]) were severely decimated by ranchers, who saw them as competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pough2005&quot;/&gt;

Conversely, many artiodactyls have declined significantly in numbers, and some have even gone extinct, largely due to [[over-hunting]], and, more recently, [[habitat destruction]]. Extinct species include several gazelles, the [[aurochs]], the [[Malagasy hippopotamus]], the [[bluebuck]], and [[Schomburgk's deer]]. Two species, the [[Scimitar-horned oryx]] and [[Père David's deer]], are [[extinct in the wild]]. Fourteen species are considered [[critically endangered]], including the [[addax]], the [[kouprey]], the [[Bactrian camel]], [[Przewalski's gazelle]], the [[saiga]], and the [[pygmy hog]]. Twenty-four species are considered [[endangered]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/search|title=Cetartiodactyla|accessdate=12 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Artiodactyla|publisher = Encyclopedia of Life|url= http://eol.org/pages/7678/details| accessdate = 15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''François Quesnay''' ({{IPA-fr|fʁɑ̃swa kɛnɛ|lang}}; 4 June 1694 – 16 December 1774) was a [[France|French]] [[economist]] and [[physician]] of the [[Physiocrats|Physiocratic]] school.&lt;ref&gt;Cutler J. Cleveland, [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Biophysical_economics &quot;Biophysical economics&quot;], ''Encyclopedia of Earth'', Last updated: 14 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for publishing the &quot;[[Tableau économique]]&quot; (Economic Table) in 1758, which provided the foundations of the ideas of the Physiocrats.&lt;ref&gt;See the biographical note in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 31'' (International Publishers: New York, 1989) p. 605.&lt;/ref&gt; This was perhaps the first work attempting to describe the workings of the economy in an analytical way, and as such can be viewed as one of the first important contributions to economic thought. His ''Le Despotisme de la Chine'', written in 1767, describes Chinese politics and society, and his own political support for constitutional [[despotism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OEMF&quot;/&gt;

==Life==
Quesnay was born at [[Méré, Yvelines|Méré]] near [[Versailles (commune)|Versailles]], the son of an advocate and small landed proprietor. [[Apprenticeship|Apprenticed]] at the age of sixteen to a surgeon, he soon went to Paris, studied medicine and surgery there, and, having qualified as a master-surgeon, settled down to practice at [[Mantes]]. In 1737 he was appointed perpetual secretary of the academy of surgery founded by [[François Gigot de la Peyronie]], and became surgeon in ordinary to [[Louis XV of France|King Louis XV]]. In 1744 he graduated as a doctor of medicine; he became physician in ordinary to the king, and afterwards his first consulting physician, and was installed in the [[Palace of Versailles]]. His apartments were on the ''entresol'', whence the Réunions de l'entresol{{Clarify|date=September 2010}} received their name. Louis XV esteemed Quesnay highly, and used to call him his thinker. When he ennobled him he gave him for arms three flowers of the [[pansy#Name origin and significance|pansy]]&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; (derived from ''pensée'', in French meaning ''thought''), with the [[Latin]] [[motto]] ''Propter cogitationem mentis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taieb.net/auteurs/Quesnay/albon.html |title=Nouvelles Ephemerides, Économiques, Seconde Partie, Analyses, Et Critiques Raisonnées. N° Premier. Éloge Historique De M. Quesnay, Contenant L'Analyse De Ses Ouvrages, Par M. Le Cte D'A*** |publisher=Taieb.net |accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He now devoted himself principally to [[economics|economic studies]], taking no part in the court intrigues which were perpetually going on around him. Around 1750 he became acquainted with [[Jacques Claude Marie Vincent de Gournay|Jacques C. M. V. de Gournay]] (1712–1759), who was also an earnest inquirer in the economic field; and round these two distinguished men was gradually formed the philosophic sect of the Économistes, or, as for distinction's sake they were afterwards called, the Physiocrates. The most remarkable men in this group of disciples were the elder [[Victor de Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]] (author of ''L'Ami des hommes'', 1756–60, and ''Philosophie rurale'', 1763), [[Nicolas Baudeau]] (''Introduction a la philosophie économique'', 1771), {{ill|Guillaume-François Le Trosne|fr}} (''De l'ordre social'', 1777), [[André Morellet]] (best known by his controversy with [[Ferdinando Galiani|Galiani]] on the freedom of the grain trade during the [[Flour War]]), [[Pierre-Paul Lemercier de La Rivière de Saint-Médard|Lemercier de La Rivière]], and [[Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours|du Pont de Nemours]]. [[Adam Smith]], during his stay on the continent with the young [[Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch|Duke of Buccleuch]] in 1764–1766, spent some time in Paris, where he made the acquaintance of Quesnay and some of his followers; he paid a high tribute to their scientific services in his ''Wealth of Nations''.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith, Adam, 1937, The Wealth of Nations, N. Y.: Random House, p. 643; first published 1776.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Quesnay was married in 1718 to a woman named Marianne Woodsen, and had a son and a daughter; his grandson by the former was a member of the first Legislative Assembly. He died on 16 December 1774, having lived long enough to see his great pupil, [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune]], in office as minister of finance.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Works==
[[File:Quesnay Tableau.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tableau économique]]]]
His economic writings are collected in the 2nd vol. of the ''Principaux économistes'', published by Guillaumin, Paris, with preface and notes by Eugène Daire; also his ''Oeuvres économiques et philosophiques'' were collected with an introduction and note by August Oncken (Frankfort, 1888); a facsimile reprint of the ''Tableau économique'', from the original MS., was published by the British Economic Association (London, 1895). His other writings were the article &quot;Évidence&quot; in the ''Encyclopédie'', and ''Recherches sur l'évidence des vérites geometriques'', with a ''Projet de nouveaux éléments de géometrie'', 1773. Quesnay's Eloge was pronounced in the [[French Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] by Grandjean de Fouchy (see the Recueil of that Academy, 1774, p.&amp;nbsp;134). See also [[Jean-François Marmontel|F.J. Marmontel]], ''Mémoires''; ''Mémoires de Mme. du Hausset''; H. Higgs, ''The Physiocrats'' (London, 1897).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Economics===
[[File:Quesnay - Tableau economique, 1965 - 5891137.tif|thumb|''Tableau economique'', 1965]]
In 1758 he published the ''[[Tableau économique]]'' (Economic Table), which provided the foundations of the ideas of the Physiocrats. This was perhaps the first work to attempt to describe the workings of the economy in an analytical way, and as such can be viewed as one of the first important contributions to economic thought.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Hara1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Phillip Anthony O'Hara|title=Encyclopedia of Political Economy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vkO8Z_078GoC&amp;pg=PA848|accessdate=21 July 2012|year=1999|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-18718-3|page=848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publications in which Quesnay expounded his system were the following: two articles, on &quot;Fermiers&quot; (Farmers) and on &quot;Grains&quot;, in the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] (1756, 1757);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rde_0769-0886_1990_num_8_1_1057 Kafker, Frank A.: ''Notices sur les auteurs des 17 volumes de « discours » de l'Encyclopédie (suite et fin).'' Recherches sur Diderot et sur l'Encyclopédie Année (1990) Volume 8 Numéro 8 p. 112]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; a discourse on the law of nature in the ''Physiocratie'' of Dupont de Nemours (1768); ''Maximes générales de gouvernement economique d'un royaume agricole'' (1758), and the simultaneously published ''Tableau économique avec son explication, ou extrait des économies royales de [[Maximilien de Bethune, duc de Sully|Sully]]'' (with the celebrated motto, ''Pauvres paysans, pauvre royaume; pauvre royaume, pauvre roi''); ''Dialogue sur le commerce et les travaux des artisans''; and other minor pieces.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The ''Tableau économique'', though on account of its dryness and abstract form it met with little general favor, may be considered the principal manifesto of the school. It was regarded by the followers of Quesnay as entitled to a place amongst the foremost products of human wisdom, and is named by the elder Mirabeau, in a passage quoted by [[Adam Smith]],&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; as one of the three great inventions which have contributed most to the stability of political societies, the other two being those of writing and of money. Its object was to exhibit by means of certain formulas the way in which the products of agriculture, which is the only source of wealth, would in a state of perfect liberty be distributed among the several classes of the community (namely, the productive classes of the proprietors and cultivators of land, and the unproductive class composed of manufacturers and merchants), and to represent by other formulas the modes of distribution which take place under systems of Governmental restraint and regulation, with the evil results arising to the whole society from different degrees of such violations of the natural order. It follows from Quesnay's theoretic views that the one thing deserving the solicitude of the practical economist and the statesman is the increase of the net product; and he infers also what Smith afterwards affirmed, on not quite the same ground, that the interest of the landowner is strictly and indissolubly connected with the general interest of the society. A small edition de luxe of this work, with other pieces, was printed in 1758 in the Palace of Versailles under the king's immediate supervision, some of the sheets, it is said, having been pulled by the royal hand. Already in 1767 the book had disappeared from circulation, and no copy of it is now procurable; but, the substance of it has been preserved in the ''Ami des hommes'' of Mirabeau, and the ''Physiocratie'' of Dupont de Nemours.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Quesnay, François|volume=22|pages=742–743|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orientalism and China===
Quesnay is known for his writings on Chinese politics and society. His book ''Le Despotisme de la Chine'', written in 1767, describes his views of the Chinese imperial system.&lt;ref name=&quot;OEMF&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Ina Baghdiantz McCabe|title=Orientalism in Early Modern France: Eurasian Trade, Exoticism and the Ancien Regime|url=https://archive.org/details/orientalismearly00mcca|url-access=limited|date=15 July 2008|publisher=[[Berg Publishers]]|isbn=978-1-84520-374-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/orientalismearly00mcca/page/n277 271]–72}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 August 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He was supportive of the meritocratic concept of giving scholars political power, without the cumbersome aristocracy that characterized French politics, and the importance of agriculture to the welfare of a nation. Gregory Blue writes that Quesnay &quot;praised China as a constitutional despotism and openly advocated the adoption of Chinese institutions, including a standardized system of taxation and universal education.&quot; Blue speculates that this may have influenced the 1793 establishment of the Permanent Settlement in [[Bengal]] by the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CC&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=E.

Carol Blum, in her book ''Strength in Numbers'' on 18th century France, labels Quesnay an &quot;apologist for [[Oriental despotism]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blum&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Carol Blum|title=Strength in Numbers: Population, Reproduction, and Power in Eighteenth-Century France|url=https://archive.org/details/strengthnumbersp00blum|url-access=limited|date=5 February 2002|publisher=[[JHU Press]]|isbn=978-0-8018-6810-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/strengthnumbersp00blum/page/n33 16]}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 August 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his admiration of [[Confucianism]], Quesnay's followers bestowed him with the title &quot;Confucius of Europe.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothbard&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Murray N. Rothbard]]|title=Economic Thought Before Adam Smith|year=2006|publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]|isbn=978-0-945466-48-2|page=366}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 August 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Quesnay's infatuation for Chinese culture, as described by Jesuits, led him to persuade the son of [[Louis XV]] to mirror the &quot;plowing of sacred land&quot; by the Chinese emperor to symbolize the link between government and agriculture.&lt;ref name=&quot;globe&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey C.

Walras is best known for his book &quot;''Éléments d'économie politique pure''.&quot;, a work that has contributed greatly to the mathematization of economics through the concept of general equilibrium. The definition of the role of the entrepreneur found in it was also taken up and amplified by [[Joseph Schumpeter|Schumpeter]]. 

Let us recall that for Walras, exchanges only take place after a Walrasian [[tâtonnement]] (French for &quot;trial and error&quot;), guided by the auctioneer, has made it possible to reach market equilibrium. It was the general equilibrium obtained from a single hypothesis, rarity, that led Joseph Schumpeter to consider him &quot;the greatest of all economists&quot;. The notion of general equilibrium was very quickly adopted by major economists such as [[Vilfredo Pareto]], [[Knut Wicksell]] or Gustav Cassel. [[John Hicks]] and [[Paul Samuelson]] used the Walrasian contribution in the elaboration of the neoclassical synthesis. For their part, Kenneth Arrow and Gérard Debreu, from the perspective of a logician and mathematician,  determined the conditions necessary for equilibrium.

==Biography==
Walras was the son of a French school administrator [[Auguste Walras]]. His father was not a professional economist, yet his economic thinking had a profound effect on his son. He found the value of goods by setting their scarcity relative to human wants.

Walras enrolled in the [[Mines ParisTech|École des Mines de Paris]], but grew tired of engineering. He worked as a bank manager, journalist, romantic novelist and railway clerk before turning to economics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Economyths&quot;&gt;''[[Economyths]]'' (2010) by [[David Orrell]], p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Walras received an appointment as the professor of political economy at the University of Lausanne.

Walras also inherited his father's interest in [[social reform]]. Much like the [[Fabians]], Walras called for the [[nationalization]] of land, believing that land's productivity would always increase and that rents from that land would be sufficient to support the nation without taxes. He also asserts that all other taxes (i.e. on goods, labor, capital) eventually realize effects exactly identical to a [[consumption tax]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walras|first=Léon|title=Elements of Pure Economics; or, The Theory of Social Wealth. Translated by William Jaffé.|year=1969|publisher=A. M. Kelly|location=New York|page=457,458}}&lt;/ref&gt; so they can hurt the economy (unlike a land tax).

Another of Walras's influences was [[Augustin Cournot]], a former schoolmate of his father. Through Cournot, Walras came under the influence of [[French rationalism]] and was introduced to the use of mathematics in economics.

As Professor of [[Political Economy]] at the [[University of Lausanne]], Walras is credited with founding the [[Lausanne school]] of economics, along with his successor [[Vilfredo Pareto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marie-Ésprit Léon Walras, 1834–1910 |publisher=The New School, The History of Economic Thought Website |url=http://homepage.newschool.edu/het//profiles/walras.htm |accessdate=2010-12-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106050650/http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/profiles/walras.htm |archivedate=January 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because most of Walras's publications were only available in French, many economists were unfamiliar with his work. This changed in 1954 with the publication of William Jaffé's English translation of Walras's ''Éléments d'économie politique pure''.&lt;ref name=&quot;William Jaffé, Historian of Economic Thought, 1898-1980&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | jstor= 1803482 | title= William Jaffé, Historian of Economic Thought, 1898–1980 |author= Walker, Donald A. |journal= The American Economic Review |date= December 1981 |volume=71 |issue=5 | pages= 1012–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walras's work was also too mathematically complex for many contemporary readers of his time. On the other hand, it has a great insight into the market process under idealized conditions so it has been far more read in the modern era.

Although Walras came to be regarded as one of the three leaders of the [[Marginalism|marginalist]] revolution,&lt;ref&gt;Sandmo, Agnar (2011). ''Economics Evolving: A History of Economic Thought'', Princeton University Press: Princeton, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;
he was not familiar with the two other leading figures of marginalism, [[William Stanley Jevons]] and [[Carl Menger]], and developed his theories independently. ''Elements'' has Walras disagreeing with Jevons on the applicability, while the findings adopted by Carl Menger, he says, are completely in alignment with the ideas present in the book (even though expressed non-mathematically).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walras|first=Léon|title=Elements of Pure Economics; or, The Theory of Social Wealth.

==Life and career==
===General equilibrium theory===
{{see also|Walras's law|General equilibrium theory|Walrasian auction}}
In 1874 and 1877 Walras published ''Éléments d'économie politique pure'' (1899, 4th ed.; 1926, éd. définitive), in English, ''Elements of Pure Economics'' (1954), trans. William Jaffé.

That work that led him to be considered the father of the [[general equilibrium theory]].  The problem that Walras set out to solve was one presented by [[A. A. Cournot]], that even though it could be demonstrated that prices would equate [[supply and demand]] to [[Market clearing|clear]] individual markets, it was unclear that an equilibrium existed for all markets simultaneously. [[Walras's law]] implies that the sum of the values of excess demands across all markets must equal zero, whether or not the economy is in a general equilibrium. This implies that if positive excess demand exists in one market, negative excess demand must exist in some other market. Thus, if all markets but one are in equilibrium, then that last market must also be in equilibrium.

While teaching at the Lausanne Academy, Walras began constructing a mathematical model that assumes a “regime of perfectly free competition”, in which productive factors, products, and prices automatically adjust in equilibrium. Walras began with the theory of exchange in 1873 and then he proceeded to map out his theories of production, capitalization and money in his first edition. His theory of exchange began with an expansion of Cournot’s demand curve to include more than two commodities, also realizing the value of the quantity sold must equal the quantity purchased thus the ratio of prices must be equal to the inverse ratio of quantities. Walras then drew a supply curve from the demand curve and set equilibrium prices at the intersection. His model could now determine prices of commodities but only the relative price. In order to deduce the absolute price, Walras could choose one price to serve as a unit of account, coined by Walras as the numeraire and state all other prices in units of this commodity. The term numeraire, meaning unit of account, has become part of the international vocabulary of economics and for many economists, the only French word they know. Using this numeraire he determined that marginal utility, or rarete, divided by the price must be equal for all commodities. Walras felt that because the value of what an individual consumer consumes is equal to the value of that individual’s stock of goods, that the aggregate, the value of total sales must equal the value of total purchase, must hold true. This became known as Walras’ Law which held that equilibrium equations can be derived from the others until only m-1 equations in the m-1 relative prices remain. Walras then expanded the theory to include production with the assumption of an existence of fixed coefficients in said production making possible a generalization that the marginal productivity of the factors of production varied with the amount of input, making factor substitution possible.

Walras constructed his basic theory of general equilibrium by beginning with simple equations and then increasing the complexity in the next equations. He began with a two-person bartering system, then moved on to the derivation of downward-sloping consumer demands. Next he moved on to exchanges involving multiple parties, and finally ended with credit and money.

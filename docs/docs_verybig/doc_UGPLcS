{{History of the People's Republic of China}}
The '''Gang of Four''' ({{zh|s=四人帮|t=四人幫|p=Sì rén bāng}}) was a political faction composed of four [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] officials. They came to prominence during the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966–76) and were later charged with a series of treasonous crimes. The gang's leading figure was [[Jiang Qing]] ([[Mao Zedong]]'s last wife). The other members were [[Zhang Chunqiao]], [[Yao Wenyuan]], and [[Wang Hongwen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Yao Wenyuan&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/5381892|title=Yao Wenyuan|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-05-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623212046/http://www.economist.com/node/5381892|archive-date=2016-06-23|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gang of Four controlled the power organs of the Communist Party of China through the later stages of the Cultural Revolution,{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} although it remains unclear which major decisions were made by Mao Zedong and carried out by the Gang, and which were the result of the Gang of Four's own planning.

The Gang of Four, together with general [[Lin Biao]] who died in 1971, were labeled the two major &quot;[[counter-revolutionary]] forces&quot; of the Cultural Revolution and officially blamed by the Chinese government for the worst excesses of the societal chaos that ensued during the ten years of turmoil. Their downfall on October 6, 1976, a mere month after Mao's death, brought about major celebrations on the streets of Beijing and marked the end of a turbulent political era in China.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Their fall did not amount to a rejection of the Cultural Revolution as such.  It was organized by the new leader, Premier [[Hua Guofeng]], and others who had risen during that period.  Significant repudiation of the entire process of change came later, with the return of [[Deng Xiaoping]] at the [[11th National Congress of the Communist Party of China]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/22/newsid_2516000/2516339.stm|title=1977: Deng Xiaoping back in power|date=22 July 1977|access-date=18 January 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728025020/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/22/newsid_2516000/2516339.stm|archive-date=28 July 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hua's gradual loss of authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/21/world/asia/21hua.html|title=Hua Guofeng, Transitional Leader of China After Mao, Is Dead at 87|date=21 August 2008|website=The New York Times|access-date=18 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105075344/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/21/world/asia/21hua.html|archive-date=5 January 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
The group was led by [[Jiang Qing]], and consisted of three of her close associates, [[Zhang Chunqiao]], [[Yao Wenyuan]], and [[Wang Hongwen]]. Two other men who were already dead in 1976, [[Kang Sheng]] and [[Xie Fuzhi]], were named as having been part of the &quot;Gang&quot;. [[Chen Boda]] and [[Mao Yuanxin]], the latter being Mao's nephew, were also considered some of the Gang's closer associates.

Most Western accounts consider that the actual leadership of the Cultural Revolution consisted of a wider group, referring predominantly to the members of the [[Cultural Revolution Group|Central Cultural Revolution Group]].  Most prominent was [[Lin Biao]], until his purported defection from China and death in a plane crash in 1971. Chen Boda is often classed as a member of Lin's faction rather than Jiang Qing's.&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Names and Identities in ''Mao's Last Revolution'', by [[Roderick MacFarquhar]] and Michael Schoenhals, [[Harvard University Press]] 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, on November 10, 1965, [[Yao Wenyuan]] in one of his most famous pieces of writing published an article in ''[[Wenhui Bao|Wenhuibao]]'' criticizing the play ''[[Hai Rui Dismissed from Office]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yao Wenyuan&quot;/&gt; The article argued that the opera was actually a sympathetic portrayal of the reformist efforts of the military hero [[Peng Dehuai]] and thus an attack on Chairman Mao's [[Great Leap Forward]]. Mao subsequently purged Peng from power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yrkpx6iKq48C|title=The Politics of China: The Eras of Mao and Deng|last1=MacFarquhar|first1=Roderick|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521588638}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/pengtehuaimanan00dome|url-access=registration|title=Peng Te-huai: The Man and the Image|last1=Domes|first1=Jürgen|date=1985|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804713030|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article is cited as the spark that launched the [[Cultural Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XkB5adcnMVUC|title=The Cultural Revolution and Post-Mao Reforms: A Historical Perspective|author-link1=Tsou Tang|last1=Tsou|first1=Tang|year=1999|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226815145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The removal of this group from power is sometimes considered to have marked the end of the Cultural Revolution, which had been launched by Mao in 1966 as part of his power struggle with leaders such as [[Liu Shaoqi]], [[Deng Xiaoping]] and [[Peng Zhen]]. Mao placed his wife Jiang Qing, a former film actress who before 1966 had not taken a public political role, in charge of the country's cultural apparatus. Zhang, Yao and Wang were party leaders in Shanghai who had played leading roles in securing that city for Mao during the Cultural Revolution.

Around the time of the death of Lin Biao in 1971, the Cultural Revolution began to lose momentum. The new commanders of the [[People's Liberation Army]] demanded that order be restored in light of the dangerous situation along the border with the [[Soviet Union]] (see [[Sino-Soviet split]]). Premier [[Zhou Enlai]], who had accepted the Cultural Revolution, but never fully supported it, regained his authority, and used it to bring Deng Xiaoping back into the Party leadership at the 10th Party Congress in 1973. Liu Shaoqi had meanwhile died in prison in 1969.

Near the end of Mao's life, a power struggle occurred between the Gang of Four and the alliance of Deng Xiaoping, Zhou Enlai, and [[Ye Jianying]].

Zhou Enlai died in January 1976, and in the subsequent months of mourning, a power struggle occurred in the top echelons of the party. The reformist Deng was named acting premier, while the Gang of Four began using their newspapers to criticize Deng and to mobilize their urban militia groups. Much of the military and party security remained under the control of the party elders of the Central Committee, who generally took a cautious role in mediating between the reformist Deng and the radical Gang of Four. They agreed to the removal of Deng from office after the April [[Tiananmen Incident]], but took steps to ensure that Deng and his allies would not be personally harmed in the process.

On September 9, Chairman Mao died. For the next few weeks the Gang of Four retained control over the government media, and many articles appeared on the theme of &quot;principles laid down&quot; (or &quot;established&quot;) by Mao near the end of his life.&lt;ref name=hsu15&gt;{{Citation

Premier Hua Guofeng attacked the radicals' media line at a Politburo meeting in late September;&lt;ref name=hsu16/&gt; but Jiang Qing emphatically disagreed with Hua, and she insisted that she be named as the new party Chairman.&lt;ref name=hsu16&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting ended inconclusively.&lt;ref name=hsu16/&gt; On October 4 the radical group warned, via an article in the ''[[Guangming Daily (China)|Guangming Daily]]'', that any revisionist who interfered with the established principles would &quot;come to no good end&quot;.&lt;ref name=baum/&gt;
 
The radicals hoped that the key military leaders [[Wang Dongxing]] and [[Chen Xilian]] would support them, but it seems that Hua won the Army over to his side. On 6 October 1976, Hua had the four leading radicals and a number of their lesser associates arrested. [[Han Suyin]] gave a detailed account of their overthrow:

{{quote|An emergency session of the Politburo was to take place in the Great Hall of the People that evening. Their presence was required. Since [[Wang Dongxing]] had been their ally, they did not suspect him... As they passed through the swinging doors into the entrance lobby, they were apprehended and led off in handcuffs. A special [[Central Security Bureau|8341 unit]] then went to Madam Mao's residence at No. 17 Fisherman's Terrace and arrested her.  That night Mao Yuanxin was arrested in [[Manchuria]], and the propagandists of the Gang of Four in [[Peking University]] and in newspaper offices were taken into custody. All was done with quiet and efficiency. In Shanghai, the Gang's supporters received a message to come to Beijing &quot;for a meeting&quot;. They came and were arrested.  Thus, without shedding a drop of blood, the plans of the Gang of Four to wield supreme power were ended.&lt;ref&gt;''Eldest Son: Zhou Enlai and the Making of Modern China'', [[Han Suyin]], 1994.  p. 413.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to historian [[Immanuel C.Y. Hsu|Immanuel C.Y. Hsü]], the operation was not completely bloodless – Wang Hongwen killed two of the guards trying to capture him, and was wounded himself before being subdued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning on 21 October, nationwide denunciations of the Gang began, which culminated in the December release of files related to the Gang's alleged crimes to the public. The party issued a denunciation of the Gang of Four as &quot;appearing to be leftist, but practically rightist&quot;. Government media blamed the Gang of Four and [[Lin Biao]] for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution. Celebrations were prominent and not limited to the streets of Beijing and other major cities. During the nationwide &quot;Movement of Exposition, Criticism and Uncovering (揭批查运动)&quot; millions of formerly &quot;rebel faction (造反派)&quot;, red guards were publicly criticized as they were thought to be related to the Gang of Four.

==Aftermath==
Immediately after the arrests, Premier [[Hua Guofeng]], Marshal [[Ye Jianying]], and economic czars [[Chen Yun]] and [[Li Xiannian]] formed the core of the next party leadership.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chaos.umd.edu/history/prc4.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902052638/http://www.chaos.umd.edu/history/prc4.html |date=2006-09-02 }} and {{cite web |url=http://www.wm.edu/cwa/A04PDFs/05.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-05-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528003924/http://www.wm.edu/cwa/A04PDFs/05.pdf |archive-date=2008-05-28 }}, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; These four, together with the rehabilitated [[Deng Xiaoping]] and [[Wang Dongxing]], were elected party Vice Chairmen at the August 1977 [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China|National Party Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terra.es/personal2/monolith/china2.htm |title=Political Leaders: China |publisher=Terra.es |access-date=2011-07-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806030501/http://www.terra.es/personal2/monolith/china2.htm |archive-date=2011-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the politburo level, the membership of all four living marshals, seven other generals and at least five others with close military ties reflected the deep concern for national stability.

==Trial==

In 1981, the four deposed leaders were subjected to a show trial and convicted of anti-party activities. During the trial, Jiang Qing in particular was extremely defiant, protesting loudly and bursting into tears at some points. She was the only member of the Gang of Four who bothered to argue on her behalf. The defence's argument was that she obeyed the orders of Chairman Mao Zedong at all times.  Zhang Chunqiao refused to admit any wrongdoing. Yao Wenyuan and Wang Hongwen expressed repentance and confessed their alleged crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/gangoffour/Gangof4.html|title=The Gang of Four Trial|first1=Haiping|last1=Zheng|year=2010|access-date=2017-12-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230122458/http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/gangoffour/Gangof4.html|archive-date=2017-12-30|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecution separated political errors from actual crimes. Among the latter were the usurpation of state power and party leadership; the persecution of some 750,000 people, 34,375 of whom died during the period 1966–1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.country-studies.com/china/the-four-modernizations,-1979-82.html |title=China the Four Modernizations, 1979-82 |publisher=Country-studies.com |access-date=2011-07-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602132245/http://country-studies.com/china/the-four-modernizations,-1979-82.html |archive-date=2011-06-02 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The official records of the trial have not yet been released.

Jiang Qing and Zhang Chunqiao received death sentences that were later commuted to life imprisonment, while Wang Hongwen and Yao Wenyuan were given life and twenty years in prison, respectively. All members of the Gang of Four have since died; Jiang Qing committed suicide in 1991, Wang Hongwen died in 1992, and Yao Wenyuan and Zhang Chunqiao died in 2005, having been released from prison in 1996 and 1998, respectively.

Supporters of the Gang of Four, including [[Chen Boda]] and [[Mao Yuanxin]], were also sentenced.

In the struggle between Hua Guofeng's and Deng Xiaoping's followers, a new term emerged, pointing to Hua's four closest collaborators, [[Wang Dongxing]], [[Wu De]], [[Ji Dengkui]] and [[Chen Xilian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eLkscG0vvskC|title=China's second revolution: Reform after Mao|first1=Harry|last1=Harding|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0815707288|access-date=2017-12-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101030115/https://books.google.ca/books?id=eLkscG0vvskC|archive-date=2018-01-01|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, they were charged with &quot;grave errors&quot; in the struggle against the Gang of Four and demoted from the Political Bureau to mere Central Committee membership.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}

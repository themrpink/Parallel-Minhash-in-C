===International law===
{{main|International piracy law}}
====Effects on international boundaries====
During the 18th century, the British and the Dutch controlled opposite sides of the [[Straits of Malacca]]. The British and the Dutch drew a line separating the Straits into two halves. The agreement was that each party would be responsible for combating piracy in their respective half. Eventually this line became the border between Malaysia and Indonesia in the Straits.

====Law of nations====
[[File:Imoconfsom.jpg|thumb|[[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO) conference on capacity-building to counter piracy in the Indian Ocean.]]
Piracy is of note in [[international law]] as it is commonly held to represent the earliest invocation of the concept of [[universal jurisdiction]]. The crime of piracy is considered a breach of ''[[jus cogens]]'', a conventional peremptory international norm that states must uphold. Those committing thefts on the high seas, inhibiting trade, and endangering maritime communication are considered by sovereign states to be ''[[hostis humani generis]]'' (enemies of humanity).&lt;ref name=HK-2001&gt;{{cite magazine|author-link=Henry Kissinger|last=Kissinger|first=Henry|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20010701faessay4996/henry-a-kissinger/the-pitfalls-of-universal-jurisdiction.html|title=The Pitfalls of Universal Jurisdiction|magazine=[[Foreign Affairs]]|date=July–August 2001|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114024521/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20010701faessay4996/henry-a-kissinger/the-pitfalls-of-universal-jurisdiction.html|archive-date=January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of universal jurisdiction, action can be taken against pirates without objection from the flag state of the pirate vessel. This represents an exception to the principle ''[[extra territorium jus dicenti impune non paretur]]'' (&quot;One who exercises jurisdiction out of his territory is not obeyed with impunity&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;''Black's Law Dictionary'', p. 528 (5th ed. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

====International conventions====

====Articles 101 to 103 of UNCLOS====
[[File:Commodore Bob Mansergh at MAST.jpg|thumb|right|British [[Royal Navy]] [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]] gives a presentation on piracy at the MAST 2008 conference.]]
Articles 101 to 103 of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS) (1982) contain a definition of piracy ''iure gentium'' (i.e. according to international law).&lt;ref name=&quot;Archbold Criminal Pleading 1999&quot;&gt;[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]. 1999. Paragraph 25–39 at p. 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; They read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Article 101&lt;/div&gt;

''Definition of piracy''

Piracy consists of any of the following acts:
*(a) any illegal acts of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, committed for private ends by the crew or the passengers of a [[private ship]] or a private aircraft, and directed—
**(i) on the [[high seas]], against another ship or aircraft, or against persons or property on board such ship or aircraft;
**(ii) against a ship, aircraft, persons or property in a place outside the jurisdiction of any State;
*(b) any act of voluntary participation in the operation of a ship or of an aircraft with knowledge of facts making it a pirate ship or aircraft;
*(c) any act of inciting or of intentionally facilitating an act described in subparagraph (a) or (b).

&lt;div style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Article 102&lt;/div&gt;

''Piracy by a warship, government ship or government aircraft whose crew has mutinied''

The acts of piracy, as defined in article 101, committed by a warship, government ship or government aircraft whose crew has mutinied and taken control of the ship or aircraft are assimilated to acts committed by a private ship or aircraft.

&lt;div style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Article 103&lt;/div&gt;

''Definition of a pirate ship or aircraft''

A ship or aircraft is considered a pirate ship or aircraft if it is intended by the persons in dominant control to be used for the purpose of committing one of the acts referred to in article 101. The same applies if the ship or aircraft has been used to commit any such act, so long as it remains under the control of the persons guilty of that act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part7.htm|title=Preamble to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the sea |website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This definition was formerly contained in articles 15 to 17 of the [[Convention on the High Seas]] signed at Geneva on April 29, 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]. 1999. Paragraph 25–39 at p. 1976 refers to the Schedule to the [[Tokyo Convention Act 1967]]. That Schedule, and section 4 of that Act, refer to the said articles of Convention on the High Seas.&lt;/ref&gt; It was drafted&lt;ref&gt;Yearbook of the ILC [1956] Vol 2, 282&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[International Law Commission]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Archbold Criminal Pleading 1999&quot;/&gt;

A limitation of article 101 above is that it confines piracy to the High Seas. As the majority of piratical acts occur within territorial waters, some pirates are able to go free as certain jurisdictions lack the resources to monitor their borders adequately.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

====IMB definition====
The International Maritime Bureau (IMB) defines piracy as:

{{quote|the act of boarding any vessel with an intent to commit theft or any other crime, and with an intent or capacity to use force in furtherance of that act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cargolaw.com/presentations_pirates.html#what_piracy%7ctitle=cargolaw.com|title=Modern High Seas Piracy|work=cargolaw.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Uniformity in Maritime Piracy Law====
Given the diverging definitions of piracy in international and municipal legal systems, some authors argue that greater uniformity in the law is required in order to strengthen anti-piracy legal instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=1682624|title=Bento, Lucas, 'Toward An International Law of Piracy Sui Generis: How the Dual Nature of Maritime Piracy Law Enables Piracy to Flourish' Berkeley Journal of International Law Vol.29:2 (2011) |publisher=ssrn.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural perceptions==
{{Main|List of fictional pirates|Pirates in popular culture}}
[[File:Black-Beard.jpg|thumb|upright|&quot;Mic the Scallywag&quot; of the Pirates of Emerson Haunted Adventure Fremont, California]]
Pirates are a frequent topic in fiction and, in their Caribbean incarnation, are associated with certain [[stereotypical]] manners of speaking and dress, some of them wholly fictional: &quot;nearly all our notions of their behavior come from the golden age of fictional piracy, which reached its zenith in 1881 with the appearance of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Treasure Island]]''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, C. &quot;The Straight Dope&quot;, October 12, 2007 [http://www.straightdope.com/columns/071012.html The Straight Dope – Fighting Ignorance Since 1973]&lt;/ref&gt; Hugely influential in shaping the popular conception of pirates, [[Captain Charles Johnson]]'s ''[[A General History of the Pyrates]]'', published in London in 1724, is the prime source for the biographies of many well known pirates of the Golden Age.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cordingly&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5ou7Bm11IgEC&amp;pg=PR7 ''A general history of the robberies &amp; murders of the most notorious pirates''. Charles Johnson]. Introduction and commentary to [[A General History of the Pyrates]] by [[David Cordingly]]. p. viii. Conway Maritime Press (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The book gives an almost mythical status to pirates, with naval historian [[David Cordingly]] writing: &quot;it has been said, and there seems no reason to question this, that Captain Johnson created the modern conception of pirates.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cordingly&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Dale Clark poses as Johnny Depp, in Pirates of the Caribbean, 24391.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A person costumed in the character of captain [[Jack Sparrow]], [[Johnny Depp]]'s lead role in the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' film series.]]
Some inventions of pirate culture such as &quot;[[walking the plank]]&quot;—in which a bound captive is forced to walk off a board extending over the sea—were popularized by [[J. M. Barrie]]'s novel, ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]]'', where the fictional pirate [[Captain Hook]] and his crew helped define the fictional pirate [[archetype]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Bonanos |first=Christopher |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2167567/?GT1=10135 |title=Did pirates really say &quot;arrrr&quot;? |publisher=Slate.com |access-date=December 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; English actor [[Robert Newton]]'s portrayal of [[Long John Silver]] in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney's]] [[Treasure Island (1950 film)|1950 film adaptation]] also helped define the modern rendition of a pirate, including the stereotypical [[West Country English#Social stigma and future of West Country dialect|West Country]] &quot;[[Pirates in popular culture#Appearance and mannerisms|pirate accent]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Angus Konstam (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=USiyy1ZA-BsC&amp;pg=PA313 Piracy: The Complete History] P. 313. Osprey Publishing. Retrieved October 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dan Parry (2006). &quot;Blackbeard: The Real Pirate of the Caribbean&quot;. p. 174. National Maritime Museum&lt;/ref&gt; Other influences include ''[[Sinbad the Sailor]]'', and the recent ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' [[Pirates of the Caribbean films|films]] have helped rekindle modern interest in piracy and have performed well at the box office. The video game ''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]]'' also revolves around pirates during the Golden Age of Piracy.

The classic [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] comic opera ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' focuses on The Pirate King and his hapless band of pirates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gsarchive.net/pirates/pirates_lib.pdf Libretto of ''The Pirates of Penzance''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929065225/https://www.gsarchive.net/pirates/pirates_lib.pdf |date=September 29, 2012 }} (1879), the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed May 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Many sports teams use &quot;pirate&quot; or a related term such as &quot;[[Raider (piracy)|raider]]&quot; or &quot;buccaneer&quot; as their nickname, based on the popular stereotypes of pirates. Such teams include the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], a [[Major League Baseball]] team in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania: they acquired their nickname in 1891 after &quot;pirating&quot; a player from another team. The [[Las Vegas Raiders]] and [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], both in the [[National Football League]], also use pirate-related nicknames.

== Economics of piracy ==

Sources on the economics of piracy include Cyrus Karraker's 1953 study ''Piracy was a Business'',&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | last1 = Karraker
 | first1 = Cyrus Harreld
 | title = Piracy was a Business

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
in which the author discusses pirates in terms of contemporary [[racketeering]]. Patrick Crowhurst researched French piracy and [[David Starkey]] focused on British 18th-century piracy. Note also the 1998 book ''The Invisible Hook: The Hidden Economics of Pirates'' by [[Peter T. Leeson]].&lt;ref name =&quot;Pennell 89&quot;&gt;[http://www.cnrs-scrn.org/northern_mariner/vol08/nm_8_2_61-79.pdf Pennell, C.R. (1998) Who Needs Pirate Heroes?] The Northern Mariner Vol. 8 No. 2 61–79 Canadian Nautical Research Society&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Piracy and entrepreneurship ===

Some 2014 research examines the links between piracy and [[entrepreneurship]]. In this context, researchers take a nonmoral approach to piracy as a source of inspiration for 2010s-era [[entrepreneurship education]]&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, D. (2014) [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/business-education/disruptors-are-just-pirates-on-the-high-seas-of-capitalism/article21443149/ Disruptors are just pirates on the high seas of capitalism.] ''The Globe and Mail Special on Business Education'', November 5, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and to research in entrepreneurship&lt;ref&gt;Roth, S. (2014) [http://works.bepress.com/roth/9/ Booties, bounties, business models: a map to the next red oceans.] ''International Journal of Entrepreneurship and Small Business'', Vol. 22 No. 4, pp. 439–448.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[business model|business-model]] generation.&lt;ref&gt;
Roth, S. (2014) [http://works.bepress.com/roth/8/ The eye-patch of the beholder.] International Journal of Entrepreneurship and Small Business, Vol. 22 No. 4, pp. 399–407.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In this respect, analysis of piracy operations may distinguish between planned (organised) and [[opportunism|opportunistic]] piracy.&lt;ref&gt;
For example:

 | isbn = 978-8791114373
 | access-date = July 13, 2018
 | quote = [...] it is useful to distinguish between organised and non-organised (or opportunistic) piracy, with the latter type being by far the most common in South-east Asia today and over the past decades. Opportunistic piracy is mostly perpetrated by quite small groups [...]. The attacks require little detailed information or planning ahead [...].

[[File:QuantumHarmonicOscillatorAnimation.gif|thumb|300px|right|Some trajectories of a [[harmonic oscillator]] according to [[Newton's laws]] of [[classical mechanics]] (A–B), and according to the [[Schrödinger equation]] of [[quantum mechanics]] (C–H). In A–B, the particle (represented as a ball attached to a [[Hooke's law|spring]]) oscillates back and forth. In C–H, some solutions to the Schrödinger Equation are shown, where the horizontal axis is position, and the vertical axis is the real part (blue) or imaginary part (red) of the [[wavefunction]]. C, D, E, F, but not G, H, are [[energy eigenstate]]s. H is a [[Coherent states|coherent state]]—a quantum state that approximates the classical trajectory.]]

The '''quantum harmonic oscillator''' is the [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] analog of the [[harmonic oscillator|classical harmonic oscillator]]. Because an arbitrary smooth [[Potential energy|potential]] can usually be approximated as a [[Harmonic oscillator#Simple harmonic oscillator|harmonic potential]] at the vicinity of a stable [[equilibrium point]],  it is one of the most important model systems in quantum mechanics. Furthermore, it is one of the few quantum-mechanical systems for which an exact, [[List_of_quantum-mechanical_systems_with_analytical_solutions|analytical solution]] is known.&lt;ref&gt;

==One-dimensional harmonic oscillator==

===Hamiltonian and energy eigenstates===
[[Image:HarmOsziFunktionen.png|thumb|Wavefunction representations for the first eight bound eigenstates, ''n'' = 0 to 7. The horizontal axis shows the position ''x''.]]

The [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] of the particle is:
:&lt;math&gt;\hat H = \frac{{\hat p}^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2} k {\hat x}^2 = \frac{{\hat p}^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 {\hat x}^2\, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|m}} is the particle's mass, {{mvar|k}} is the force constant, &lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular frequency]] of the oscillator, &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}&lt;/math&gt;  is the [[position operator]] (given by {{mvar|x}}), and   &lt;math&gt;\hat{p}&lt;/math&gt;  is the [[momentum operator]] (given by &lt;math&gt;\hat p = - i \hbar {\partial \over \partial x} \,&lt;/math&gt;).  The first term in the Hamiltonian represents the kinetic energy of the particle, and the second term represents its potential energy, as in [[Hooke's law]].

One may write the time-independent [[Schrödinger equation]],
::&lt;math&gt; \hat H \left| \psi \right\rangle = E \left| \psi \right\rangle  ~,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|E}} denotes a to-be-determined real number that will specify a time-independent [[energy level]], or [[eigenvalue]], and the solution  {{math|{{!}}''ψ''⟩}} denotes that level's energy [[eigenstate]].

One may solve the differential equation representing this eigenvalue problem in the coordinate basis, for the [[wave function]] {{math|⟨''x''{{!}}''ψ''⟩ {{=}} ''ψ''(''x'')}}, using a [[spectral method]]. It turns out that there is a family of solutions. In this basis, they amount to [[Hermite polynomials#Hermite functions| Hermite functions]],
:&lt;math&gt;  \psi_n(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n\,n!}} \cdot \left(\frac{m\omega}{\pi \hbar}\right)^{1/4} \cdot e^{
- \frac{m\omega x^2}{2 \hbar}} \cdot H_n\left(\sqrt{\frac{m\omega}{\hbar}} x \right), \qquad n = 0,1,2,\ldots. &lt;/math&gt;

The functions ''H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the physicists' [[Hermite polynomials]],
:&lt;math&gt;H_n(z)=(-1)^n~ e^{z^2}\frac{d^n}{dz^n}\left(e^{-z^2}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding energy levels are
:&lt;math&gt; E_n = \hbar \omega \left(n + {1\over 2}\right)=(2 n + 1) {\hbar \over 2} \omega~.&lt;/math&gt;

This energy spectrum is noteworthy for three reasons.  First, the energies are quantized, meaning that only discrete energy values (integer-plus-half multiples of {{math|''ħω''}}) are possible; this is a general feature of quantum-mechanical systems when a particle is confined.  Second, these discrete energy levels are equally spaced, unlike in the [[Bohr model]] of the atom, or the [[particle in a box]].  Third, the lowest achievable energy (the energy of the {{math|''n'' {{=}} 0}} state, called the [[ground state]]) is not equal to the minimum of the potential well, but {{math|''ħω''/2}} above it; this is called [[zero-point energy]]. Because of the zero-point energy, the position and momentum of the oscillator in the ground state are not fixed (as they would be in a classical oscillator), but have a small range of variance, in accordance with the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]].

The ground state probability density is concentrated at the origin, which means the particle spends most of its time at the bottom of the potential well, as one would expect for a state with little energy. As the energy increases, the probability density peaks at the classical &quot;turning points&quot;, where the state's energy coincides with the potential energy. (See the discussion below of the highly excited states.) This is consistent with the classical harmonic oscillator, in which the particle spends more of its time (and is therefore more likely to be found) near the turning points, where it is moving the slowest. The [[correspondence principle]] is thus satisfied. Moreover, special nondispersive [[wave packet]]s, with minimum uncertainty,  called [[Coherent states#The wavefunction of a coherent state|coherent states]] oscillate very much like classical objects, as illustrated in the figure; they are ''not'' eigenstates of the Hamiltonian.

===Ladder operator method===
[[Image:QHarmonicOscillator.png|right|thumb|Probability densities &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'')&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;!--or in pseudoTeX: &lt;math&gt;\left |\psi_n(x)\right |^2&lt;/math&gt; --&gt; for the bound eigenstates, beginning with the ground state (''n'' = 0) at the bottom and increasing in energy toward the top. The horizontal axis shows the position {{mvar|x,}} and brighter colors represent higher probability densities.]]

The &quot;[[ladder operator]]&quot; method, developed by [[Paul Dirac]], allows extraction of the energy eigenvalues without directly solving the differential equation. It is generalizable to more complicated problems, notably in [[quantum field theory]].  Following this approach, we define the operators {{mvar|a}} and its [[Hermitian adjoint|adjoint]] {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;}},
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
          a &amp;=\sqrt{m\omega \over 2\hbar} \left(\hat x + {i \over m \omega} \hat p \right) \\
  a^\dagger &amp;=\sqrt{m\omega \over 2\hbar} \left(\hat x - {i \over m \omega} \hat p \right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

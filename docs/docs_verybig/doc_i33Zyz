'''Henry A. Barnes''' (December 16, 1906 – September 1968)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mocavo.com/Henry-Barnes-1906-1968-Social-Security-Death-Index/11042592104783604430 HENRY BARNES (1906-1968), Social Security Death Index]&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[Traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineer]] and commissioner who served in many cities, including [[Flint, Michigan]]; [[Denver, Colorado]]; [[Baltimore, Maryland]]; and New York City. Barnes was responsible for many innovations in applied traffic engineering, including the [[Green wave|Green Wave]] of coordinated [[traffic signal]]s, the application of actuated traffic signals (signals set off by the presence of an [[automobile]] or a pedestrian pushing a button), and the introduction of [[bus lane]]s.

==Barnes Dance==
The [[Barnes Dance]] or &quot;Barnes Shuffle&quot; is a street-crossing system that stops all traffic and allows pedestrians to cross intersections in every direction at the same time. This system was first used in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] and [[Transportation in Vancouver|Vancouver]] in the late 1940s. Subsequently it was adopted in other cities such as [[Denver]], Colorado, [[Transportation in New York City|New York]], [[San Diego]], [[Baltimore]], Maryland, and Washington, D.C.. Barnes stated that he did not invent the concept but promoted its widespread use. The phrase originated from City Hall reporter, John Buchanan, who wrote, &quot;Barnes has made people so happy, they're dancing in the street.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Barnes Dance|date=2005-01-19|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/barnes.htm|work=US Department of Transportation |accessdate=2007-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traffic Engineer and Commissioner==

===Flint, Michigan===
Barnes served in Flint until 1947.

===Denver===
Denver city's first professional traffic engineer from 1947 to 1953, where he oversaw the conversion of Denver Tramways to bus and [[Trolleybus|trolley coach]].

===Baltimore===
Barnes came to Baltimore in 1953 for a one-month job as consultant traffic engineer, but Mayor [[Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr.]] (father of [[Nancy Pelosi]]) was so impressed he hired Barnes as traffic commissioner. At Baltimore, Barnes installed a traffic-control computer that was, in 1957, the largest of its kind in the world. He had the pedestal honoring Johns Hopkins moved to Charles and 33rd Street; previously it had been responsible for a number of fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tom |last=Chalkley |title=Road Warrior |date=2001-05-30 |url=http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=2431 |work=Baltimore City Paper |accessdate=2007-10-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221041235/http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=2431 |archivedate=2006-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes asked the mayor for a raise from $18,000 to 20,000 and took the traffic commissioner position at New York City when the request was turned down.

===New York City===
Barnes was appointed traffic commissioner to New York City on January 15, 1962, by Mayor Robert F. Wagner, and kept on by Mayor John V. Lindsay. In 1962, Barnes fought with domineering city planner [[Robert Moses]] and killed the planned elevated [[Lower Manhattan Expressway]]. In 1963, he had an idea for expanding the Long Island Expressway capacity in Queens by adding three more lanes in each direction plus a second, four-lane deck above it. The upper deck would have no exits and run inbound in the morning and outbound in the evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Island's Missing Highway Links|date=2005-06-26|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/26/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/26liroad.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1|work=New York Times|accessdate=2007-10-11 | first=Richard | last=Korman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Long Island Expressway (I-495)|url=http://www.nycroads.com/roads/long-island/|work=nyroads.com|accessdate=2007-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;semi-actuated signal&quot; that allows pedestrians to influence the change of traffic lights was another idea of Barnes, thought to have been introduced in 1964. With regards to the city's traffic signals, Barnes declared to repaint all of the traffic signals throughout the city of New York in the early 1960s. Prior to the early 1960s, traffic signals throughout the city were originally dark olive green. They were repainted yellow in the early 1960s. He was also involved in the completion of converting major avenues to one-way in New York City, a project started in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Luo|title=For Exercise in New York Futility, Push Button |date=2004-02-27|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E6DE113CF934A15751C0A9629C8B63|work=New York Times|accessdate=2007-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reportedly suggested solving Manhattan's traffic problems by making all avenues one-way, north. Barnes endorsed the use of [[seat belt]]s, built municipal [[parking garage]]s and implemented widespread use of [[parking meter]]s.

==Recognition==
Barnes was featured in ''Life Magazine'' November 13, 1964 edition – &quot;New York's traffic jam doctor&quot;. He also appeared as a &quot;Mystery Guest #1&quot; on the television show ''[[What's My Line?]]'' which first aired on February 18, 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Episode #602|url=http://www.tv.com/whats-my-line/episode-602/episode/97399/summary.html|accessdate=2007-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes was also featured in ''Popular Mechanics Magazine'' in January 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Popular Mechanics January 1953|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zdwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Theodore M. Matson Memorial Award was bestowed on him in 1968.

==Death==
Barnes died in September 1968 at age 61, suffering a heart attack on the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Traffic Commissioner Barnes, 61, Dies After Being Stricken on Job|date=1968-09-17|work=New York Times|url=http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/barnes_dance/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituaries|date=1968-09-27|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902354,00.html?iid=chix-sphere|work=Time Magazine|accessdate=2007-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==
*&quot;You can't be a nice guy and solve traffic&quot;
*&quot;As things stood now, a downtown shopper needed a four-leaf clover, a voodoo charm, and a St. Christopher's medal to make it in one piece from one curbstone to the other&quot;
*&quot;In this business there are very few problems that can't be solved with some yellow paint and a little bit of common sense.&quot;
*&quot;I often said I didn’t mind street cars except for the fact that they ran on the street.&quot;

'''Moral absolutism ''' is an [[Ethics|ethical]] view that all [[action (philosophy)|actions]] are intrinsically right or wrong. Stealing, for instance, might be considered to be always [[Immorality|immoral]], even if done for the well-being of others (e.g., stealing food to feed a starving family), and even if it does in the end promote such a good. Moral absolutism stands in contrast to other categories of [[normative ethics|normative ethical theories]] such as [[consequentialism]], which holds that the [[morality]] (in the wide sense) of an act depends on the consequences or the context of the act.

Moral absolutism is not the same as [[moral universalism]]. Universalism holds merely that what is right or wrong is independent of custom or opinion (as opposed to [[moral relativism]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Moral Absolutism|url=https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/moral-absolutism|website=Ethics Unwrapped|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not necessarily that what is right or wrong is independent of context or consequences (as in absolutism). Moral universalism is compatible with moral absolutism, but also positions such as consequentialism. [[Louis Pojman]] gives the following definitions to distinguish the two positions of moral absolutism and universalism:&lt;ref name=&quot;PojmanDefense&quot;&gt;Pojman, L. P. ''A Defense of Ethical Objectivism'' (p. 50).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Moral absolutism: There is at least one principle that ought never to be violated.
* Moral objectivism: There is a fact of the matter as to whether any given action is morally permissible or impermissible: a fact of the matter that does not depend solely on social custom or individual acceptance.

Ethical theories which place strong emphasis on [[rights]] and [[duty]], such as the [[deontological ethics]] of [[Immanuel Kant]], are often forms of moral absolutism, as are many [[religion|religious]] moral codes.

==Religion==
Moral absolutism can be understood in a strictly secular context, as in many forms of deontological [[moral rationalism]]. However, many religions also adhere to moral absolutist positions, since their moral system is derived from divine commandments. Therefore, such a moral system is absolute, (usually) perfect and unchanging. Many secular philosophies, borrowing from religion, also take a morally absolutist position, asserting that the absolute laws of morality are inherent in the nature of people, the nature of life in general, or the Universe itself. For example, someone who absolutely believes in non-violence considers it wrong to use violence even in self-defense.

[[Catholic philosopher]] [[Thomas Aquinas]] never explicitly addresses the [[Euthyphro dilemma]], but draws a distinction between what is good or evil in itself and what is good or evil because of God's commands,{{sfn|Aquinas|c. 1265–1274|loc=2a2ae [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3057.htm#article2 57.2]}} with unchangeable moral standards forming the bulk of [[natural law]].{{sfn|Aquinas|c. 1265–1274|loc=2a1ae [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2094.htm#article5 94.5]}} Thus he contends that not even God can change the [[Ten Commandments]], adding, however, that God ''can'' change what individuals deserve in particular cases, in what might look like special dispensations to murder or steal.{{sfn|Aquinas|c. 1265–1274|loc=1a2ae [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2100.htm#article8 100.8]}}

'''The Aircraft Manufacturing Company Limited''' ('''Airco''') was an early [[United Kingdom|British]] aircraft manufacturer. Established during 1912, it grew rapidly during the [[First World War]], referring to itself as the largest aircraft company in the world by 1918.

Airco produced many thousands of aircraft for both the British and Allied military air wings throughout the war, including [[fighter aircraft|fighters]], [[trainer aircraft|trainers]] and [[medium bomber|bombers]]. The majority of the company's aircraft were designed in-house by Airco's chief designer [[Geoffrey de Havilland]].

Airco established the first [[airline]] in the United Kingdom, [[Aircraft Transport and Travel Limited]], which operated as a [[subsidiary]] of Airco. On 25 August 1919, it commenced the world's first regular daily international service.

Following the end of the war, the company's fortunes rapidly turned sour. The [[interwar period]] was unfavourable for aircraft manufacturers largely due to a glut of surplus aircraft from the war, while a lack of interest in aviation on the part of the British government also hampered its prospects. Airco quickly became unprofitable; during 1920, the firm was sold to [[Birmingham Small Arms Company]], after which its operations were [[liquidation|liquidated]] later that same year. Numerous assets and personnel formerly belonging to the company were integrated into the newly established [[de Havilland Aircraft Company]].

==Origins and de Havilland==
During 1912, Airco was established by [[newspaper]] proprietor and industrialist [[George Holt Thomas]]. The firm was initially based at [[The Hyde]] in [[Hendon]], north [[London]], England. Starting in August 1914, the aviator [[William Taylor Birchenough (Aviator)|William Taylor Birchenough]] worked as a test pilot for Airco. That same year, learning that [[Geoffrey de Havilland]], who was then at the [[Royal Aircraft Factory]] in Farnborough, might be available, Holt Thomas invited de Havilland to join Airco as its chief designer. De Havilland's Airco designs would prove decisive to the company, eventually provide around 30 per cent of all trainers, fighters and bombers used by Britain and the United States during the [[World War I|First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;The King's Interest In Flying. Factory And Aerodrome Visited. ''The Times'', Friday, 1 June 1917; pg. 9; Issue 41493.&lt;/ref&gt; De Havilland's designs for Airco were all marked with his initials &quot;DH&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DreadfulCaption&quot;&gt;Airco display advertisement, page 3, ''The Times'', 3 December 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wartime production==
Airco would design and produce numerous aircraft during the wartime years. Its [[Airco DH.2|DH.2]], a [[pusher configuration]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] introduced during 1916, contributed to ending the &quot;[[Fokker scourge]]&quot; of 1915. While early air combat over the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] had indicated the need for a single-seat fighter with forward-firing armament, there was no dominant approach to applying armaments to fighters at the time.&lt;ref name = &quot;bruce 34&quot;&gt;Bruce 1966, pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; As no means of firing forward through the propeller of a tractor aeroplane was available to the British, Geoffrey de Havilland designed the DH.2 as a smaller, single-seat development of the earlier two-seat [[Airco DH.1|DH.1]] pusher design.&lt;ref name = &quot;bruce 3&quot;&gt;Bruce 1966, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 453 DH.2s were produced by Airco.&lt;ref name=&quot;Airco DH-2&quot;&gt;[http://www.classicfighters.co.nz/ac/dh2/index.shtml Airco DH-2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212124216/http://www.classicfighters.co.nz/ac/dh2/index.shtml |date=12 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another design produced by de Havilland was the [[Airco DH.6|DH.6]], which was specifically designed as a military [[Trainer aircraft|trainer]]; as this role was normally performed by obsolete service types at the time, it was an unconventional choice to develop a dedicated trainer.&lt;ref&gt;Baker 1990, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The DH.6 possessed relatively gentle flying characteristics, being described as being probably the most &quot;forgiving&quot; aircraft of its time, allowing itself to be flown &quot;crab wise&quot; in improperly banked turns and able to maintain sustained flight at speeds as low as {{convert|30|mph|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson p.86&quot;&gt;Jackson 1987, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; At least 2,282 DH.6s were built in the UK during wartime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson p.87&quot;&gt;Jackson 1987, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Airco DH.4|DH.4]] was a two-seat combat aircraft, intended to perform both [[aerial reconnaissance]] and [[Bomber#The first bombers|day bomber]] missions.&lt;ref name = &quot;bruce 3&quot;&gt;Bruce 1966, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of production, a total of 1,449 aircraft (from orders for 1,700 aircraft) were constructed in Britain for the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC) and the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] (RNAS).&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson p54&quot;&gt;Jackson 1987, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Production of the DH.4 was performed by a variety of companies beyond Airco themselves; these included F.W. Berwick and Co, Glendower Aircraft Company, Palladium Autocars, Vulcan Motor and Engineering, and the [[Westland Aircraft|Westland Aircraft Work]].&lt;ref name = &quot;bruce 10&quot;&gt;Bruce 1966, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Overseas, [[SABCA]] of [[Belgium]] produced a further 15 DH.4s during 1926.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson p60&quot;&gt;Jackson 1987, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;bruce 10&quot;/&gt; In the United States, several different manufacturers, including the [[Boeing|Boeing Airplane Corporation]], [[Dayton-Wright Airplane Company]], the [[Fisher Body|Fisher Body Corporation]], and the [[Standard Aircraft Corporation]] produced an Americanised variant of the DH.4, featuring over 1,000 modifications from the original British design, to equip the American air services.&lt;ref name = &quot;bow 3 4&quot;&gt;Bowers 1966, pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1916, the [[Airco DH.9|DH.9]] was designed as a successor to the DH.4, reusing both its wings and [[Empennage|tail unit]] while adopting a modified [[fuselage]] that moved the [[Aviator|pilot]] closer to the [[Air gunner|gunner/observer]] and away from the [[Piston engine|engine]] and fuel tank, which facilitated communication and was viewed as being a more optimal fighting configuration.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bruce 1966, p. 4&quot;&gt;Bruce 1965, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, While the DH.9 was deemed to be suitable for daytime bombing operations, it was found to be incapable of effective nighttime bombing due to the pilot's view being obstructed and visibility via the [[bombsight]] being unsuitable.&lt;ref name = &quot;bruce 65 5&quot;&gt;Bruce 1965, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The DH.9's performance in action over the Western Front was typically deemed to have been a disaster; heavy losses of the type were quickly incurred, attributed to both its poor performance and to engine failures, despite the prior derating of its engine to reduce the failure rate.&lt;ref name = &quot;bruce 65 6&quot;&gt;Bruce 1965, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

By December 1918, Holt Thomas claimed in an advertisement that Airco was the largest aircraft company in the world, being engaged in the construction of aeroplanes, engines and [[propeller]]s in large numbers, as well as a number of [[airship]]s and [[flying boat]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;DreadfulCaption&quot; /&gt; The engines being built included licensed production of [[Gnome et Rhône|Gnome and Le Rhone]] [[rotary engine]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;DreadfulCaption&quot; /&gt; The company's works at Hendon employed between 7,000 and 8,000 people and had the latest metal-working machinery, in addition to extensive testing equipment, including a materials testing laboratory and a [[wind tunnel]].&lt;ref name=ObitTT&gt;Mr. G. Holt Thomas. ''The Times'', Friday, 4 January 1929; pg. 14; Issue 45092.&lt;/ref&gt; At one stage, Airco was reportedly completing one new aircraft every 45 minutes on average.&lt;ref name=ObitDawes&gt;Mr. G. Holt Thomas. Colonel G. W. Dawes. ''The Times'', Saturday, 5 January 1929; pg. 14; Issue 45093.&lt;/ref&gt; During 1920, the aviation periodical [[Flight International|Flight Magazine]] reported that, during the period from August 1914 to November 1918, the D.H. Airco aircraft manufactured in both Britain and the United States had comprised approximately 30 per cent of the total output of aeroplanes of these two allies.&lt;ref&gt;page 1147, Flight Magazine, 4 November 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]] and the end of the conflict, many of the wartime DH.4s and DH.9s, along with the improved [[Airco DH.9A|DH.9A]], served for many years with the newly created [[Royal Air Force]]. These aircraft also formed the basis of early de Havilland-designed airliners, including the company's [[De Havilland DH.16|DH.16]] and [[De Havilland DH.18|DH.18]] types which were operated by [[Aircraft Transport and Travel]] Limited, the first airline established in the United Kingdom, which was also owned by George Holt Thomas.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Airline operations and the first daily international flights==
[[File:DH16-AT&amp;T.jpg|thumb|[[Airco DH.16]] used by Aircraft Transport and Travel]]
Airco decided to enter into the early [[airline]] business, established a dedicated [[subsidiary]], [[Aircraft Transport and Travel]] (AT&amp;T), for this purpose.&lt;ref name=&quot;DreadfulCaption&quot; /&gt; On 25 August 1919, the firm commenced the world's first regular daily international service, between [[Hounslow Heath Aerodrome]] and [[Paris–Le Bourget Airport|Le Bourget Aerodrome]], France. A number of [[Airco DH.16|DH.16s]] were used for this service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson Civil V2 p62&quot;&gt;Jackson 1973, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to operating the London-to-Paris service, AT&amp;T also launched other routes, including one between [[Croydon Airport]] and [[Amsterdam]], on behalf of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] airline [[KLM]]. On 17 May 1920, an AT&amp;T DH.16 (G-EALU) performed the first KLM service between London and [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson Civil V2 p62&quot;/&gt;

==Sale to BSA and liquidation==
Following the [[Armistice with Germany|cessation of hostilities]], the large number of war-surplus machines, sharp fluctuations in business confidence, and the government's failure, unlike those of USA and France, to provide any form of support, Airco became unprofitable.&lt;ref name=ObitTT/&gt; Thomas endeavoured to sell Airco to a car manufacturer. Airco and BSA, parent company of Daimler, announced on 1 March 1920 that Airco had amalgamated with [[Birmingham Small Arms Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Air Transport Combine. Aircraft And B.S.A. Firms Unite ''The Times'', Monday, 1 March 1920; pg. 14; Issue 42347.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within days BSA discovered Airco was in a far more serious financial state than Thomas had revealed. Thomas was immediately removed from his new seat on the BSA board and all BSA's new acquisitions were placed in [[liquidation]]. As a result of the financial situation that it inherited, BSA was unable to issue a [[dividend]] to shareholders for the following four years.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport-Hines, R. P. T. ''Dudley Docker: The Life and Times of a Trade Warrior.''  1984, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; With help from Thomas, de Havilland bought the group's assets he needed to form the [[de Havilland Aircraft Company]] during 1920.

Aircraft Transport and Travel had been allowed to continue to operate until December 1920. BSA then bought Aircraft Transport and Travel's aircraft from the liquidator and, in early 1921, established [[Daimler Airway]] and [[Daimler Air Hire]] under [[Daimler Hire|Daimler Hire Limited]]'s [[Frank Searle (businessman)|Frank Searle]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

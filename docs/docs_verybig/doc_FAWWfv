'''Anne Cécile Desclos''' (23 September 1907&amp;nbsp;– 27 April 1998) was a French journalist and novelist who wrote under the pseudonyms '''Dominique Aury''' and '''Pauline Réage''', and is best known for her erotic novel ''Histoire d'O'' (''[[Story of O]]'').

== Early life ==
Born in [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]], Charente-Maritime, France to a bilingual family, Desclos began reading in French and English at an early age. After completing her studies at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], she worked as a journalist until 1946 when she joined [[Gallimard Publishers]] as the editorial secretary for one of its imprints where she began using the pen name of Dominique Aury.

An avid reader of English literature, Desclos either translated or introduced to readers in France such renowned authors as [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], [[Evelyn Waugh]], [[Virginia Woolf]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] and numerous others. She became a critic and was made a member of the jury for several{{how many|date=August 2020}} prominent [[literary awards]].

== Career ==
Desclos' lover and employer [[Jean Paulhan]], a fervent admirer of the [[Marquis de Sade]], had made the remark to her that no woman was capable of writing an [[erotic novel]]. To prove him wrong, Desclos wrote a graphic, [[sadomasochistic]] novel that was published under the pseudonym Pauline Réage in June 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ciuraru&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.guernicamag.com/features/ciuraru_6_15_11/|title=The Story of the Story of O |first=Carmela |last=Ciuraru |date=11 June 2011 |magazine=[[Guernica (magazine)|Guernica]] |accessdate=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Titled ''Histoire d'O'' (''[[Story of O]]''), with a sympathetic preface by Jean Paulhan which nevertheless did not reveal her identity, it was an enormous, though controversial, commercial success. The book caused much speculation as to the identity of the author. Many doubted that it was a woman, let alone the demure, intellectual, and almost prudish persona displayed in Dominique Aury's writings. Many well-known male writers were alternately suspected to be the author, including [[André Malraux]] and [[Henri de Montherlant]].

In addition, the book's graphic content sparked so much controversy that the following March the government authorities brought [[obscenity]] charges against the publisher and its mysterious author that were thrown out of court in 1959. However, a publicity ban and a restriction on the book's sale to [[minor (law)|minor]]s was imposed by the judge. Following the lifting of the publicity ban in 1967, the conclusion to ''Story of O'' was published under the title ''[[Retour à Roissy]]'' using the pseudonym of Pauline Réage. However, according to her recent biography by Angie David, Desclos did not write this second novel. In 1975, she did a long interview about erotic books with author [[Régine Deforges]], published by ''Story of O'' editor [[Jean-Jacques Pauvert]], yet at the time her authorship was still unknown. An English-language edition of the interview was released in the United States in 1979 by [[Viking Press]].

Eventually, Desclos publicly admitted that she was the author of ''The Story of O'' in 1994, 40 years after the book was published, in an interview with ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ciuraru&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bedell”B&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jul/25/fiction.features3 |title=I wrote the story of O |first=Geraldine |last=Bedell |date=24 July 2004 |newspaper=[[The Observer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaufmann 883–905&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaufmann|first=Dorothy|date=1 January 1998|title=The Story of Two Women: Dominique Aury and Edith Thomas|journal=[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]|volume=23|issue=4|pages=883–905|doi=10.1086/495295|jstor=3175197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1994/08/01/the-unmasking-of-o |first=John |last=De St. Jorre |title=The Unmasking of O |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |pages=42–43 |date=1 August 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also explained the pseudonym of Pauline Réage: she chose the first name in homage to [[Pauline Bonaparte]] and [[Pauline Roland]] and she randomly picked up the name of Réage on a topographic map.

== Documentaries ==
''Writer of O'', a 2004 documentary film by [[Pola Rapaport]], mixed interviews with re-enactments of certain scenes from the book. In the documentary, the real author of ''Story of O'', Dominique Aury (actually a pen name of Desclos), talks about the book ''A Girl in Love''. This book was written about how ''Story of O'' was written.

A documentary was also made for [[BBC Radio 4]] entitled ''The Story of O: The Vice Francaise'', presented by [[Rowan Pelling]], former editor of the ''[[Erotic Review]]'', which looked at the history of the book and its author Desclos.

''[[Erotica: A Journey Into Female Sexuality]]'', a documentary by filmmaker [[Maya Gallus]], featured the final interview with 90-year-old Dominique Aury (a pen name of Desclos) before she died. In the film, she recounts the extraordinary love story behind ''Story of O'' and marvels that she has reached such a grand age.

== Personal life ==
Desclos had a long-term relationship with her employer [[Jean Paulhan]], the director of the prestigious ''[[Nouvelle Revue Française]]'', who was 23 years her senior. She was actively [[bisexuality|bisexual]] at times in her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.arlindo-correia.org/021202.html |title=Histoire D'O |first=Jérôme |last=Garcin |date=8 August 2002 |journal=[[Nouvel Observateur]] |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; She notoriously had a liaison with historian and novelist [[Édith Thomas]], who may have been an inspiration for the character of Anne-Marie in ''Story of O''. She had a son from a brief marriage in her early twenties.

== Legacy ==

In 2007, the [[National Leather Association International]] inaugurated awards for excellence in SM/fetish/leather writing. The categories include the Pauline Reage (a pen name of Desclos) award for fiction novel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bedell”B&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaufmann 883–905&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nla2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=NLA-I Accepting Nominations for Writing Awards|url=http://www.chicagoden.net/2012/12/13/nla-i-accepting-nominations-for-writing-awards/|publisher=Chicago Den - The Midwest's Fetish Newspaper|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2020, Desclos was inducted into the Leather Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://leatherhalloffame.com/index.php/inductees.html |title=&gt; Inductees |publisher=Leatherhalloffame.com |accessdate=1 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="9571" xml:space="preserve">In computers, '''case sensitivity''' defines whether [[letter case|uppercase and lowercase]] letters are treated as distinct ('''case-sensitive''') or equivalent ('''case-insensitive'''). For instance, when users interested in learning about dogs search an [[e-book]], &quot;dog&quot; and &quot;Dog&quot; are of the same significance to them. Thus, they request a case-insensitive search. But when they search an online encyclopedia for information about the [[United Nations]], for example, or something with no ambiguity regarding capitalization and ambiguity between two or more terms cut down by capitalization, they may prefer a case-sensitive search.

==Areas of significance==
Case sensitivity may differ depending on the situation:

*[[String-searching algorithm|Searching]]: Users expect information retrieval systems to be able to have correct case sensitivity depending on the nature of an operation. Users looking for the word &quot;dog&quot; in an online journal probably does not wish to differentiate between &quot;dog&quot; or &quot;Dog&quot;, as this is a writing distinction; the word should be matched whether it appears at the beginning of a sentence or not. On the other hand, users looking for information about a brand name, trademark, human name, or city name may be interested in performing a case-sensitive operation to filter out irrelevant results. For example, somebody searching for the name &quot;Jade&quot; would not want to find references to the mineral called &quot;jade&quot;. On the [[English Wikipedia]] for example a search for [[Friendly fire]] returns the military article but [[Friendly Fire]] (capitalized &quot;Fire&quot;) returns the disambiguation page.&lt;ref&gt;See [[WP:DIFFCAPS]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Username]]s: Authentication systems usually treat usernames as case-insensitive to facilitate memorization, reducing typing complexity, and eliminate the possibility of both mistake and [[Impersonator|fraud]] when two usernames are identical in every aspect except the case of one of their letters. However, these systems are not case-blind. They [[case preservation|preserve the case of the characters in the name]] so that users may choose an aesthetically pleasing combination.
*[[Password]]s: Authentication systems usually treat passwords as case-sensitive. This enables the users to increase the complexity of their passwords.
*[[Filename#Letter case preservation|File names]]: Traditionally, [[Unix-like]] operating systems treat file names case-sensitively while [[Microsoft Windows]] is case-insensitive but, for most file systems, [[case preservation|case-preserving]]. For more details, see below.
*[[Variable (programming)|Variable names]]: Some programming languages are case-sensitive for their variable names while others are not. For more details, see below.
*[[URL]]s: The ''path'', ''query'', ''fragment'', and ''authority'' sections of a URL may or may not be case-sensitive, depending on the receiving [[web server]]. The ''scheme'' and ''host'' parts, however, are strictly lowercase.

==In programming languages==
Some [[programming languages]] are case-sensitive for their identifiers ([[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Verilog]],&lt;ref name=&quot;k&amp;r1e&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Kernighan | first = Brian W. | authorlink = Brian Kernighan | last2 = Ritchie | first2 = Dennis M. | authorlink2 = Dennis Ritchie | chapter = Chapter 2: Types, Operators and Expressions | page = [https://archive.org/details/cprogramminglang00kern/page/33 33] | title = [[The C Programming Language (book)|The C Programming Language]] | edition = 1st | publisher = Prentice Hall | date = February 1978 | location = Englewood Cliffs, NJ | isbn = 0-13-110163-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Matsumoto | first = Yukihiro | authorlink = Yukihiro Matsumoto | chapter = Chapter 2: Language Basics | page = [https://archive.org/details/rubyinnutshellde00mats/page/9 9] | title = Ruby in a nutshell | edition = 1st | publisher = O'Reilly Media | date = January 2002 | isbn = 0-596-00214-9 | url = https://archive.org/details/rubyinnutshellde00mats/page/9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]]). Others are case-insensitive (i.e., not case-sensitive), such as [[ABAP]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], most [[BASIC]]s (an exception being [[BBC BASIC]]), [[Fortran]], [[SQL]] (for the syntax, and for some vendor implementations, e.g. [[Microsoft SQL Server]], the data itself)&lt;ref group='NB'&gt;Although one can explicitly set a single database or column [[collation]] to be case-sensitive&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]].  There are also languages, such as [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], [[Prolog]], and [[Go (programming language)|Go]], in which the capitalisation of an identifier encodes information about its [[Semantics (computer science)|semantics]]. Some other programming languages have varying case-sensitivity; in [[PHP]], for example, variable names are case-sensitive but function names are not case sensitive. This means that if you define a function in lowercase, you can call it in uppercase, but if you define a variable in lowercase, you cannot refer to it in uppercase. [[Nim (programming language)|Nim]] is case-insensitive and ignores underscores, as long as the first characters match.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/manual.html#lexical-analysis-identifier-equality|title=Nim Manual: Identifier Equality|last=|first=|date=|website=nim-lang.github.io|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In text search==
A text search operation could be case-sensitive or case-insensitive, depending on the system, application, or context. The user can in many cases specify whether a search is sensitive to case, e.g. in most text editors, word processors, and Web browsers.  A case-insensitive search is more comprehensive, finding &quot;Language&quot; (at the beginning of a sentence), &quot;language&quot;, and &quot;LANGUAGE&quot; (in a title in capitals); a case-sensitive search will find the computer language &quot;BASIC&quot; but exclude most of the many unwanted instances of the word. For example, the [[Google Search]] engine is basically case-insensitive, with no option for case-sensitive search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://code.google.com/p/case-sensitive-search/ |title=case-sensitive-search - case sensitive google search - Google Project Hosting |work=code.google.com |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Oracle database|Oracle]] SQL most operations and searches are case-sensitive by default,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E12151_01/doc.150/e12152.pdf|title=Oracle SQL Developer User's Guide, Release 1.5|section=2.10 Making Queries Case Insensitive|date=August 2013|publisher=[[Oracle Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in most other [[Database management system|DBMS]]'s SQL searches are case-insensitive by default.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/case-sensitivity.html |title=MySQL :: MySQL 5.0 Reference Manual :: C.5.5.1 Case Sensitivity in String Searches |work=dev.mysql.com |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Case-insensitive operations are sometimes said to '''fold case''', from the idea of folding the character code table so that upper- and lowercase letters coincide.

==In filesystems==
In filesystems in [[Unix-like]] systems, filenames are usually case-sensitive (there can be separate readme.txt and Readme.txt files in the same directory). [[MacOS]] is somewhat unusual in that, by default, it uses [[HFS Plus|HFS+]] and [[APFS]] in a case-insensitive (so that there cannot be a readme.txt and a Readme.txt in the same directory) but [[Case preservation|case-preserving]] mode (so that a file created as readme.txt is shown as readme.txt and a file created as Readme.txt is shown as Readme.txt) by default. This causes some issues for developers and [[power users]], because most file systems in other Unix-like environments are case-sensitive, and, for example, a source code tree for software for Unix-like systems might have both a file named Makefile and a file named makefile in the same directory. In addition, some Mac [[Installation (computer programs)#Installer|Installers]] assume case-insensitivity and fail on case-sensitive file systems.

The older [[MS-DOS]] filesystems [[FAT12]] and [[FAT16]] were case-insensitive and not case-preserving, so that a file whose name is entered as readme.txt or ReadMe.txt is saved as README.TXT. Later, with [[VFAT]] in [[Windows 95]] the FAT file systems became case-preserving as an extension of supporting [[Long filenames]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc739978(v=ws.10).aspx |title=Case Sensitivity in Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications |work=technet.microsoft.com |date=2005-08-22 |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Windows file systems such as [[NTFS]] are internally case-sensitive, and a readme.txt and a Readme.txt can coexist in the same directory. However, for practical purposes filenames behave as case-insensitive as far as users and most software are concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/100625 |title=Filenames are Case Sensitive on NTFS Volumes |work=support.microsoft.com |date=2006-11-01 |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can cause problems for developers or software coming from Unix-like environments, similar to the problems with macOS case-insensitive file systems.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had admired the work of the [[Marquis de Sade]]. The novel shares with the latter themes such as love, [[dominance and submission]].

== Plot ==
''Story of O'' is a tale of [[female submission]] involving a beautiful Parisian fashion photographer named O, who is taught to be constantly available for [[Oral sex|oral]], [[Vaginal sex|vaginal]], and [[Anal sex|anal]] [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]], offering herself to any male who belongs to the same [[secret society]] as her lover. She is regularly stripped, blindfolded, [[Bondage (BDSM)|chained]], and [[Flagellation#Erotic use|whipped]]; her anus is widened by increasingly large [[butt plug|plugs]]; her [[labia piercing|labium is pierced]] and her buttocks are [[Branding persons#Persisting practices|branded]].

The story begins when O's lover, René, brings her to the château in [[Roissy-en-France|Roissy]], where she is trained to serve the members of an elite club. After this initial training, as a demonstration of their bond and his generosity, René hands O to his elder stepbrother Sir Stephen, a more severe master. René wants O to learn to serve someone whom she does not love, and someone who does not love her. Over the course of this training, O falls in love with Sir Stephen and believes him to be in love with her as well. During the summer, Sir Stephen sends O to an old mansion in [[Samois-sur-Seine|Samois]] solely inhabited by women for advanced training and body modifications related to submission. There she agrees to receive permanent marks of Sir Stephen's ownership, in the form of a [[human branding|brand]] and a steel tag hanging from a [[labia piercing]].

Meanwhile René has encouraged O to seduce Jacqueline, a vain fashion model, and lure her to Roissy. Jacqueline is repulsed when she first sees O's chains and scars, although O herself is proud of her condition as a willing slave. But Jacqueline's younger half-sister becomes enamored of O, and begs to be taken to Roissy.

At the [[climax (narrative)|climax]], O is presented as a [[Sexual slavery (BDSM)|sexual slave]], nude but for an owl-like mask and a leash attached to her piercing, before a large party of guests who treat her solely as an object. Afterward, she is shared by Sir Stephen and an associate of his who is referred to only as &quot;The Commander&quot;.

Some early editions included several different variations of an epilogue which note that Sir Stephen later abandoned O, though there is debate as to whether Desclos intended it to be included in the finished work; in one such version, O is so distraught by the threat of this abandonment that she insists she would rather die and asks for permission to commit suicide, which is granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The story of O|first=Pauline|last=Réage|publisher=Ballantine|year=1973|isbn=0345301110|quote=''There exists a second end to O's story.

== Publishing history ==
In February 1955, ''Story of O'' won the French literature prize [[Prix des Deux Magots]], but the French authorities still brought [[obscenity]] charges against the publisher. The charges were rejected by the courts, but a publicity ban was imposed for a number of years.

[[Olympia Press]] published the first English edition in 1965. [[Eliot Fremont-Smith]] (of ''[[The New York Times]]'') called its publication &quot;a significant event&quot;.

A critical view of the novel is that it is about, and derives its erotic power from, the ultimate [[sexual objectification|objectification]] of a woman. The heroine has the shortest possible name. Though this is in fact a shortening of &quot;Odile&quot;, it could also stand for &quot;object&quot; or &quot;orifice&quot;, an O being a symbolic representation of any &quot;hole&quot;. The novel was strongly criticized by many [[feminists]], who felt it glorified the abuse of women.&lt;ref&gt;

When the film of ''The Story of O'' was released, ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]'' magazine ran a feature on the novel and film. This resulted in ''L'Express'' being picketed by feminists from the group [[Mouvement de libération des femmes]], who found the novel and film objectionable.&lt;ref name=&quot;ad&quot; /&gt; Journalist [[François Chalais]] also criticized ''Story of O'', claiming the novel glorified violence; he described the novel as &quot;bringing the Gestapo into the boudoir&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ad&quot; /&gt;

== Hidden identities ==
The author used a pen name, then later used another pen name, before finally, just before her death, revealing her true identity. Her lover, Jean Paulhan, wrote the preface as if the author were unknown to him.{{fact|date=August 2020}}

According to Geraldine Bedell,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bedell&quot; /&gt; &quot;Pauline Réage, the author, was a pseudonym, and many people thought that the book could only have been written by a man. The writer's true identity was not revealed until ten years ago, when, in an interview with John de St. Jorre, a British journalist and sometime foreign correspondent of ''The Observer'', an impeccably dressed 86-year-old intellectual called Dominique Aury acknowledged that the fantasies of castles, masks and debauchery were hers.&quot; According to several other sources, however, Dominique Aury was itself a pseudonym of [[Anne Desclos]], born 23 September 1907 in [[Rochefort-sur-Mer]], France, and deceased 26 April 1998 (at age 90) in Paris.

The Grove Press edition (U.S., 1965) was translated by editor [[Richard Seaver]] (who had lived in France for many years) under the pseudonym Sabine d'Estrée.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Jean Paulhan ===
[[Jean Paulhan]], the author's lover and the person to whom she wrote ''Story of O'' in the form of love letters, wrote the preface, &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot;. Paulhan admired the [[Marquis de Sade]]'s work and told Desclos that a woman could not write like Sade. Desclos took this as a challenge and wrote the book. Paulhan was so impressed that he sent it to a publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guernicamag.com/features/ciuraru_6_15_11/|title=The Story of the Story of O|first=Carmela|last=Ciuraru|date=11 June 2011|work=[[Guernica (magazine)|Guernica]]|accessdate=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the preface, he goes out of his way to appear as if he does not know who wrote it. In one part he says, &quot;But from the beginning to end, the story of O is managed rather like some brilliant feat. It reminds you more of a speech than of a mere effusion; of a letter rather than a secret diary. But to whom is the letter addressed? Whom is the speech trying to convince? Whom can we ask? I don't even know who you are. That you are a woman I have little doubt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paulhan also explains his own belief that the themes in the book depict the true nature of women. At times, the preface (when read with the knowledge of the relationship between Paulhan and the author), seems to be a continuation of the conversation between them.

In an interview&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKI51n69P6Y Interview] YouTube min 10:00&lt;/ref&gt; Paulhan explained that O, in a religious-like obsession, was seeking the loss of the responsibility on her body and mind much like many religious women losing themselves in the mercy of God. In both cases it is the joy of destruction. Paulhan was also quoted: &quot;To be killed by someone you love strikes me as the epitome of ecstasy&quot;.
 
Discussing the ending, Paulhan states, &quot;I too was surprised by the end. And nothing you can say will convince me that it is the real end. That in reality (so to speak) your heroine convinces Sir Stephen to consent to her death.&quot;{{citation needed |date=November 2012}}

One critic has seen Paulhan's essay as consistent with other themes in his work, including his interest in erotica, his &quot;mystification&quot; of love and sexual relationships, and a view of women that is arguably [[sexist]].&lt;ref&gt;

A sequel to ''Story of O'', ''Retour à Roissy'' (''[[Return to Roissy]],'' but often translated as ''Return to the Chateau'', ''Continuing the Story of O''), was published in 1969 in French, again with Jean-Jacques Pauvert, ''éditeur''. It was published again in English by Grove Press, Inc., in 1971. It is not known whether this work is by the same author as the original.

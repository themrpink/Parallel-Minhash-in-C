Substantial progress has been made in reducing the city's historically high crime rate. Gun crime is primarily concentrated in certain poor minority neighborhoods with nearly all homicides committed by criminals with guns. Oakland's crime rate had begun to escalate during the late 1960s; and by the end of the 1970s, during the drug wars, the city's per capita murder rate had risen to twice that of San Francisco or New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mac Donald |first=Heather |title=Jerry Brown's No-Nonsense New Age for Oakland |work=[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]] |location=New York |date=August 1999 |url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/9_4_a2.html |access-date=October 29, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827074841/http://www.city-journal.org/html/9_4_a2.html |archive-date=August 27, 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary factor in the rising crime rate has been the dramatic increase of street narcotics sales and use since the 1970s, with Oakland becoming a major west-coast hub for heroin and cocaine distribution. Subsequent battle for control over the lucrative narcotics trade incited gang conflicts and violence, with shootings becoming a regular occurrence. A concurrent rise in rape, robbery, burglary, auto-theft and other crimes occurred as well. Prior to 1960, there had been successful government-funded social programs whereby rebellious teens were enrolled in youth centers that would teach them proper values and improve their behavior. However, similar programs since then have been inconsistent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosen 2007 255–270&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosen|first=Eva|author2=Sudhir Venkatesh |title=Legal Innovation and the Control of Gang Behavior|journal=[[Annual Review of Law and Social Science]]|date=2007|volume=3|issue=1|pages=255–270|doi=10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.3.081806.112724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, the police and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) used [[military tactics]] such as SWAT teams, infiltration and counter intelligence in an attempt to counter groups such as the Black Panthers (responsible for several police ambushes), the S.L.A. and organized drug gangs such as the &quot;69 Mob&quot;, with increases in arrests, prosecutions, and imprisonment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosen 2007 255–270&quot;/&gt; During the first decade of the 21st century, Oakland has consistently been listed as one of the most dangerous large cities in the United States,&lt;ref name=&quot;sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Oakland Moves From 3rd To 5th In Most Dangerous City Survey |agency=[[Bay City News]] |publisher=[[CBS San Francisco]] |date=November 22, 2010 |url= http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2010/11/22/oakland-moves-from-3rd-to-5th-in-most-dangerous-city-survey/ |access-date=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the latter part of the decade, the homicide rate dropped four years in a row, and violent crime in general had dropped 27%.

==Education==

===Primary and secondary education===

The [[Oakland Unified School District]] (OUSD), which covers the city except for Sheffield Village, operates most of Oakland's public schools. Due to financial troubles and administrative failures, it was in receivership by the state of California from 2002 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goleadershipcenter.org/2010/04/statement_from.php|title=Great Oakland Public Schools Leadership Center|work=goleadershipcenter.org|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925120052/http://www.goleadershipcenter.org/2010/04/statement_from.php|archive-date=September 25, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2015}}, the Oakland Unified School District includes 86 division-run schools and 32 charter schools; the district also manages several adult education programs. {{as of|2015}} there are 48,181 K–12 students; among division-run schools, there are 4,600 plus employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OUSD Oakland Unified School District Fast Facts 2015-2015|url=http://www.ousd.org/cms/lib07/CA01001176/Centricity/Domain/1//OUSD%20District%20Docs/OUSD%20Fast%20Facts%202014-15.pdf|publisher=Oakland Unified School District|access-date=September 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OUSD test scores historically lag behind the rest of California, in particular due to a high proportion of English-language learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oaklandnorth.net/2013/09/02/oakland-high-school-test-scores-lag-behind-state|title=Oakland high school test scores lag behind state|work=Oakland North|access-date=October 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some individual schools have much better performance than the citywide average. {{as of|2013}}, for example, over half the students at Hillcrest Elementary School in the [[Montclair, Oakland, California|Montclair]] upper hills neighborhood performed at the &quot;advanced&quot; level in the English portion of the test, and students at [[Lincoln Elementary School (Oakland, California)|Lincoln Elementary School]] in the [[Chinatown, Oakland, California|Chinatown]] neighborhood performed at the &quot;advanced&quot; level in the math portion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://star.cde.ca.gov/star2013/SearchPanel.aspx?lstTestYear=2013&amp;lstTestType=C&amp;lstCounty=01&amp;lstDistrict=61259-000&amp;lstSchool=6002018&amp;lstGroup=1&amp;lstSubGroup=1|title=Test Results Search – 2013 STAR Test Results (CA Dept of Education)|work=ca.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oakland's three largest public high schools are [[Oakland High School (California)|Oakland High School]], [[Oakland Technical High School]], and [[Skyline High School (Oakland, California)|Skyline High School]]. Other Oakland public high schools include [[Castlemont High School]], [[Fremont High School (Oakland, California)|Fremont High School]], and [[McClymonds High School]], briefly known as Castlemont Community of Small Schools, Fremont Federation of High Schools, and [[McClymonds Educational Complex]], respectively.

Among charter schools in the district, North Oakland Community Charter School (NOCCS), an elementary and middle school, is one of the few public progressive schools in the country.{{clarify|date=September 2015}} Other charter schools include the [[Oakland Military Institute]], [[Oakland School for the Arts]], [[Bay Area Technology School]], [[East Bay Innovation Academy]], and [[Oakland Charter Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oaklandcharter.net/ |title=Oaklandcharter.net |publisher=Oaklandcharter.net |access-date=April 19, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424125734/https://www.oaklandcharter.net/ |archive-date=April 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several religious and secular private high schools, including [[The College Preparatory School]], [[Head-Royce School]], [[Bishop O'Dowd High School]], [[Holy Names High School (Oakland)|Holy Names High School]], [[St. Elizabeth High School (Oakland, California)|St. Elizabeth High School]] and [[Oakland Hebrew Day School]]. Catholic schools in Oakland are operated by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Oakland]] also include eight K–8 schools (plus one in Piedmont on the Oakland city border). Northern Light School is a private nonprofit elementary and middle school. [[Bentley School]] is an Independent Co-educational K–12, college preparatory school on two campuses in Oakland and Lafayette, California.

==== Funding ====
In 2017, the Oakland Unified School District has received funding from Pandora in partnership with Little Kids Rock, towards expanding music education programs within the schools. The result from these donations has given teachers from 20 additional Oakland- area schools the ability to participate in an eight-hour professional development workshop, and receive music education instruction from Little Kids Rock. The donation includes providing new instruments, that will benefit over 2000 Oakland students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.pandora.com/file/4247784/Index?KeyFile=390627585|title=Pandora – Press Release|website=press.pandora.com|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==

{{Main|List of television stations in the San Francisco Bay Area}}
Oakland is served by major television stations broadcasting primarily out of San Francisco and San Jose. The region's [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[Owned-and-operated station|O&amp;O]], [[KTVU]] 2, is based in (and licensed to) Oakland at [[Jack London Square]] along with co-owned independent station [[KICU-TV]] 36 (licensed to San Jose). In addition, the city is served by various [[Template:San Francisco Radio|AM and FM]] radio stations as well; AM stations [[KKSF (AM)|KKSF]] 910, [[KMKY (AM)|KMKY]] 1310 and [[KNEW (AM)|KNEW]] 960 are licensed to Oakland.

Oakland was served by the [[Oakland Tribune]], which published its first newspaper on February 21, 1874. The [[Tribune Tower (Oakland)|Tribune Tower]], which features a large clock, is an Oakland landmark. At key times throughout the day (8:00&amp;nbsp;am, noon and 5:00&amp;nbsp;pm), the clock tower carillon plays a variety of classic melodies, which change daily. In 2007, the Oakland Tribune moved its offices from the tower to an East Oakland location, before folding in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_MEDIANEWS_NEWSPAPER_CUTBACKS?SITE=WSAW&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT |title=MediaNews combining most SF Bay area newspapers into 2 new brands, eliminating 120 jobs |author=Liedtke, Michael |date=August 23, 2011 |agency=Associated Press |access-date=August 27, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

====Air and rail====

Oakland residents have access to the three major airports of the San Francisco Bay Area: [[Oakland International Airport]], [[San Francisco International Airport]], and [[San Jose International Airport]]. Oakland International Airport, within Oakland's city limits, is {{convert|4|mi|abbr=on}} south of downtown Oakland and serves domestic and international destinations. [[AC Transit]] provides 24-hour service to the airport, and [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART's]] [[Coliseum–Oakland International Airport line|Coliseum–Oakland International Airport]] [[automated guideway transit]] line provides frequent service between the airport and [[Oakland Coliseum station]].

The city has regional and long-distance passenger train service provided by [[Amtrak]], with stations near [[Jack London Square]] and the [[Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum]]. Amtrak's ''[[California Zephyr]]'' has its western terminus at the nearby [[Emeryville (Amtrak station)|Emeryville station]].

Historically, the city was served by several train companies, which terminated in different terminals. [[Santa Fe Railroad|Santa Fe]] trains terminated at its Oakland depot, actually located within the city limits of Emeryville at 40th and San Pablo. [[Southern Pacific]] trains ended at the [[16th Street Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://localwiki.org/oakland/Railroads|title=Railroads|work=localwiki.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Western Pacific Railroad|Western Pacific]] trains ended at the 3rd and Washington station. However, a common feature was that the different railroads continued one more stop to a station at [[Oakland Pier]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The California Zephyr&quot; from &quot;Streamliner Schedules&quot;, original reference from the 1950 Official Guide of railroads&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; From this latter point passengers would ride ferries to San Francisco.

Bus transit service in Oakland and the inner [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]] is provided by the Alameda and Contra Costa Transit District, [[AC Transit]]. The district originated in 1958 after the conspiratorial [[General Motors Streetcar Conspiracy|dissolution]] of the [[Key System]] of streetcars. Many AC Transit lines follow old routes of the Key System.&lt;ref name=&quot;journalism.berkeley.edu&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Westbound BRT platform at City Center under construction, April 2020.jpg|thumb|Construction of AC Transit's Westbound 12th St station]]
Intercity bus companies that serve Oakland include [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]], [[BoltBus]], [[Megabus (North America)|Megabus]], [[Chinatown bus lines|USAsia]], and [[Chinatown bus lines|Hoang Transportation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = AIBRA – Find a Station| access-date = May 2, 2015| url = http://www.kfhgroup.com/aibra/Tables/tables.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The metropolitan area is served by [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] (BART) from eight stations in Oakland. The system has headquarters in Oakland, with major transfer hubs at [[MacArthur (BART station)|MacArthur]] and [[19th Street / Oakland (BART station)|19th Street]] stations. BART's headquarters was in a building above the [[Lake Merritt (BART station)|Lake Merritt BART station]] until 2006, when it relocated to the Kaiser Center due to seismic safety concerns.

The [[Alameda / Oakland Ferry]] operates ferry service from [[Jack London Square]] to [[Alameda, California|Alameda]], [[Oracle Park]], [[Pier 41]], the [[San Francisco Ferry Building]], and the [[South San Francisco Ferry Terminal]].
Oakland licenses taxi cabs, and has zoned cab stands in its downtown, including a bicycle pedi-cab service.

The Oakland City Council adopted a Bicycle Master Plan in 1999 as a part of the Land Use and Transportation (LUTE) element of Oakland's 1998 General Plan. The creation of the plan was to promote alternatives to the private automobile.&lt;ref name=&quot;bicycle_master_plan_p15&quot;/&gt; The Oakland City Council reaffirmed the bike plan in 2005, revised it in 2007, and reaffirmed it in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/PWA/o/EC/s/BicycleandPedestrianProgram/OAK024597 |title=Let's Bike Oakland!

==== Motorized scooters ====
In July 2019, the City of Oakland Department of Transportation announced that it had issued official permits for the deployment of shared e-scooters to four companies: [[Bird (company)|Bird]], [[CleVR|Clevr]], Lime, and Lyft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oaklandca.gov/news/2019/oakdot-announces-permits-for-shared-e-scooters|title=OakDOT Announces Permits for Shared E-Scooters|website=City of Oakland|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oakland requires these operators to educate users on the correct and safe use of scooters, to distribute the scooters equitably throughout the city, to ensure accessibility, and to provide insurance and indemnification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2019-07-02|title=Oakland OKs 3,500 rental e-scooters from Bird, Lime, Lyft, Clevr|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Oakland-OKs-3-500-rental-e-scooters-from-Bird-14067377.php|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191204063047/https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Oakland-OKs-3-500-rental-e-scooters-from-Bird-14067377.php|archive-date=December 4, 2019|access-date=2019-11-20|website=SFChronicle.com|language=en-US|ref=https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Oakland-OKs-3-500-rental-e-scooters-from-Bird-14067377.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bridges, freeways, and tunnels====

Oakland is served by several major highways: Eastbound Bay Bridge traffic entering Oakland then splits into three freeways at the [[MacArthur Maze]] freeway interchange: [[Interstate 580 (California)|Interstate 580]] (MacArthur Freeway) heads southeast toward [[Hayward, California|Hayward]] and eventually to the [[California Central Valley]]; [[Interstate 880 (California)|Interstate 880]] (Nimitz Freeway) runs south to [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]; and the Eastshore Freeway ([[Interstate 80 (California)|Interstate 80]]/I-580) runs north, providing connections to [[Sacramento]] and [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]], respectively.
[[Interstate 980 (California)|Interstate 980]] (Williams Freeway) begins its eastbound journey at I-880 in Downtown Oakland before turning into [[California State Route 24|State Route 24]] (Grove Shafter Freeway) at I-580. [[California State Route 13|State Route 13]] begins as the Warren Freeway at I-580, and runs through a scenic valley in the [[Montclair, Oakland, California|Montclair District]] before entering [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. A stub of a planned freeway was constructed at the High Street exit from the Nimitz Freeway, but that freeway extension plan was abandoned.

At the time of the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]], the [[Cypress Street Viaduct]] double-deck segment of the [[Nimitz Freeway]] collapsed, killing 42 people. The old freeway segment had passed through the middle of West Oakland, forming a barrier between West Oakland neighborhoods. Following the earthquake, this section was rerouted around the perimeter of West Oakland and rebuilt in 1997–2001. The east span of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge also suffered damage from the quake when a 50-foot (15-m) section of the upper deck collapsed onto the lower deck; the damaged section was repaired within a month of the earthquake. As a result of Loma Prieta, a significant seismic retrofit was performed on the western span of the Bay Bridge. The eastern span has now been replaced with a dramatic single-tower self-anchoring suspension span.

Two underwater tunnels, the [[Webster Street Tube|Webster]] and [[Posey Tube|Posey]] Tubes, connect the main island of Alameda to downtown Oakland, coming above ground in Chinatown. In addition, the [[Park Street Bridge|Park Street]], [[Fruitvale Bridge|Fruitvale]], and High Street bridges connect Alameda to East Oakland over the [[Oakland Estuary]].

In the hills, the [[Leimert Bridge]] crosses Dimond Canyon, connecting the Oakmore neighborhood to Park Boulevard. The [[Caldecott Tunnel]] carries Highway 24 through the [[Berkeley Hills]], connecting central Contra Costa County to Oakland. The Caldecott has four bores.

===Freight rail===

Freight service, which consists primarily of moving shipping containers to and from the Port of Oakland, is provided today by [[Union Pacific Railroad]] (UP), and to a lesser extent by [[BNSF Railway]] (which now shares the tracks of the UP between Richmond and Oakland).

Historically, Oakland was served by several railroads. Besides the transcontinental line of the Southern Pacific, there was also the Santa Fe (whose Oakland terminal was actually in Emeryville), the [[Western Pacific Railroad]] (who built a pier adjacent to the SP's), and the [[Sacramento Northern Railroad]] (eventually absorbed by the Western Pacific, which in turn was absorbed by UP in 1983).

===Shipping===

As one of the three major ports on the [[West Coast of the United States]], the [[Port of Oakland]] is the largest seaport on San Francisco Bay and the fifth busiest container port in the United States. It was one of the earliest seaports to switch to containerization and to [[Intermodal freight transport|intermodal container transfer]],&lt;ref&gt;''Initial Study: Intermodal Interface Demonstration Project, Port of Oakland, Oakland, California'', Earth Metrics and Korve Engineerning, December 20, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; thereby displacing the [[Port of San Francisco]], which never modernized its waterfront. One of the earlier limitations to growth was the inability to transfer containers to rail lines, all cranes historically operating between ocean vessels and trucks. In the 1980s, the Port of Oakland began the evaluation of development of an intermodal container transfer capability, i.e., facilities that now allow trans-loading of containers from vessels to either trucks or rail modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.glennfrancosimmons.com/port-oakland|title=Port Of Oakland, Oakland Estuary|work=Glenn Franco Simmons|access-date=December 7, 2017|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208071321/http://www.glennfrancosimmons.com/port-oakland|archive-date=December 8, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utilities===

[[Public water supply|Water]] and [[sewage treatment]] are provided by [[East Bay Municipal Utility District]] (EBMUD). [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]] (PG &amp; E) provides natural gas and electricity service. Municipal garbage collection is franchised to [[Waste Management, Inc]]. Telecommunications and subscriber television services are provided by multiple private corporations and other service providers in accordance with the competitive objectives of the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996#Stated objective|Telecommunications Act of 1996]].

Oakland tops the list of the 50 largest US cities using electricity from renewable sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainlane.us/articles/city_renewable_energy.jsp|title=What is the definition of sustainability, development and resources|work=Tech Stuffed|access-date=August 27, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723035943/http://www.sustainlane.us/articles/city_renewable_energy.jsp|archive-date=July 23, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Healthcare===
[[File:Alta Bates Summit Medical Center.jpg|thumb|Alta Bates Summit Medical Center]]
Originating in Oakland, [[Kaiser Permanente]] is an [[Health maintenance organization|HMO]] started in 1942, during World War II, by industrialist [[Henry J. Kaiser]] to provide medical care for [[Kaiser Shipyards]] workers. It is the largest managed care organization in the United States and the largest non-governmental health care provider in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Consumer-driven health care: implications for providers, payers, and policymakers |last=Zendle |first=Les |author2=Regina E.

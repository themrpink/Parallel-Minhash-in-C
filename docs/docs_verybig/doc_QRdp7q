The public bus company for Kinshasa, created in 2003, is Transco (Transport au Congo).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Trans urbain kinshasa |url=https://transurbainkinshasa.wordpress.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819051539/http://transurbainkinshasa.wordpress.com/ |archive-date=19 August 2013 |access-date=13 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several companies operate registered taxis and taxi-buses, identifiable by their yellow colour.

===Air===
The city has two airports: [[N'djili Airport]] (FIH) is the main airport with connections to other African countries as well as to Istanbul, Brussels, Paris and some other destinations. [[N'Dolo Airport]], located close to the city centre, is used for domestic flights only with small turboprop aircraft. Several international airlines serve Ndjili Airport including [[Kenya Airways]], [[South African Airways]], [[Ethiopian Airlines]], [[Brussels Airlines]], [[Air France]] and [[Turkish Airlines]]. An average of ten international flights depart each day from N'djili Airport.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightera.net/airport/Kinshasa/FZAA?mode=departure#flights Flightera.net]&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of airlines provide domestic service from Kinshasa, for example [[Congo Airways]] and [[flyCAA]]. Both offer scheduled flights from Kinshasa to a limited number of cities inside DR Congo.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aeroport-kinshasa.com/en/index_en.php N'djili Airport website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rail===
[[File:Kinshasa train station (21237028852).jpg|thumb|A memorial at Kinshasa train station remembering those who died during the construction of the railroad]]
{{unreferenced|date=April 2020|section}}
The [[Matadi–Kinshasa Railway]] connects Kinshasa with [[Matadi]], Congo's Atlantic port. The line reopened in September 2015 after around a decade without regular service. There is an intermittent service, with a poor safety record.

According to the Commercial Corporation of Transport and Ports (SCTP), the Matadi-Kinshasa Railway (CFMK) has the highest transport of goods in import, 8 746 tonnes in January, 11,318 tonnes in February 10,032 tonnes in March, 7,244 tonnes in April, 5,024 tonnes in March and 7,745 tonnes in June. The monthly tonnage of exported goods reached only 1,000 tonnes in the month of March 2018. In January some 284 tonnes of goods were exported from the ports of Boma and Matadi, via the railway, and 711 tonnes in February, then 1,058 tonnes in March, 684 tonnes in April, 818 tonnes in May and 853 tonnes in June.

The monthly statistics for passenger traffic are as follows: 2,294 persons in January, 1,836 in February, 2065 in March, 2,660 in April, 1,952 in May and 2,660 in June.

The line connecting the port of Matadi to Kinshasa is 366&amp;nbsp;km long. Its distance has been since 3111 of 3112 feet or 42 inches (lane capped 1,067 meter): This railway belongs, in fact, to the National Society, Congo Railways (SNCC). It is only exploited by the SCTP, formerly ONATRA, according to an agreement signed by the two companies.

But this line lost large shares of the market, following its lamentable state, insecurity on the rail (some trains are attacked) and the rehabilitation of the road along the rail in 2000. According to Congolese sources , an agreement with a Chinese construction company was signed in 2006, according to which this Chinese company will finance the renovation of the track, the rolling stock, the communication channels the signaling and the electrical energy, the ex -ONATRA has, in fact, opted for an aggressive commercial policy to revive the rail.

On June 30, 2018, the SCTP received two locomotives and 50 wagons from the African firm ARSS (African-Rolling Stock Solution).

In 2017, some 2.2 million tonnes of cement were produced by the two new start-up companies, PPC Barnet and Kongo Cement Factory (CIMKO). The SCTP did indeed transport part of this production to Kinshasa but the exact quantity was not communicated by the railway department of the company, the former DG Kimbembe Mazunga had communicated an agreed protocol of agreements with the cement manufacturers of Kongo-Central for the transport of their productions.

===External transport===
Kinshasa is the major [[river port]] of the Congo. The port, called 'Le Beach Ngobila' extends for about {{convert|7|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} along the river, comprising scores of [[quay]]s and [[jetty|jetties]] with hundreds of boats and barges tied up. Ferries cross the river to Brazzaville, a distance of about {{convert|4|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. River transport also connects to dozens of ports upstream, such as [[Kisangani]] and [[Bangui]].

There are road and [[Matadi-Kinshasa Railway|rail]] links to [[Matadi]], the [[sea port]] in the Congo estuary {{convert|150|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the Atlantic Ocean.

There are no rail links from Kinshasa further inland, and road connections to much of the rest of the country are few and in poor condition.

==Social issues==

===Crime and punishment===
Since the [[Second Congo War]], the city has been striving to recover from disorder, with many youth gangs hailing from Kinshasa's slums.&lt;ref&gt;Jonny Hong, &quot;Gang crime threatens the future of Congo's capital&quot;, ''Reuters'', 19 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. State Department in 2010 informed travelers that Kinshasa and other major Congolese cities are generally safe for daytime travel, but to beware of robbers, especially in traffic jams and in areas near hotels and stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=U.S. Dept. of State – Congo, Democratic Republic of the Country Specific Information |url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1104.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219124428/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1104.html |archive-date=19 December 2010 |access-date=15 December 2010 |publisher=United States Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources say that Kinshasa is extremely dangerous, with one source giving a homicide rate of 112 per 100,000 people per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Bruce Baker |title=Nonstate Policing: Expanding the Scope for Tackling Africa's Urban Violence |url=http://africacenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/AfricaBrief-7.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005100432/http://africacenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/AfricaBrief-7.pdf |archive-date=5 October 2011 |access-date=17 August 2018 |website=Africacenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source cites a homicide rate of 12.3 per 100,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;ElechiMorris2010&quot;&gt;O.

While the military and National Police operate their own jails in Kinshasa, the main detention facility under the jurisdiction of the local courts is the Kinshasa Penitentiary and Re-education center in Malaka. This prison houses more than double its nominal capacity of 1,000 inmates.

'''Colonization''', or '''colonisation''' is the establishing of [[colony|colonies]].

In the case of [[settler colonialism]] large-scale population movements take place where the migrants maintain strong links with their or their ancestors' former country, gaining significant privileges over other inhabitants of the territory by such links.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Howe|first1= Stephen|title= Empire: A Very Short Introduction|date= 2002|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= United States|pages=|isbn= 9780191604447|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=04lJ4TshmxcC&amp;q=colonisation%20central%20empire%3A%20A%20Very%20Short%20Introduction&amp;pg=PT52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) |year= 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn= 9781317558712|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hjY-CgAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22oxford+dictionary+of+english%22+colonialism+colonization+%22systems+of+rule%22+%22large-scale+population+movements%22&amp;pg=PA36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western European colonies of the Americas, Australia and New Zealand settlers (supplemented by Central European, Eastern European, Asian and African people) eventually formed a large majority of the population after killing, [[cultural assimilation|assimilating]] or driving away indigenous peoples. 

In other places, Western European settlers formed minority groups, which often used more advanced weaponry to dominate the people initially living in their places of settlement.&lt;ref name=EI&gt;{{cite book|last1= Howe|first1= Stephen|title= Empire: A Very Short Introduction|date= 2002|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= United States|pages= 21–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Britain started to  [[Colonisation of Australia|settle in Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and various other smaller islands, they often regarded the landmasses as ''[[terra nullius]]'', meaning &quot;empty land&quot; in Latin.&lt;ref name=PG&gt;{{cite book|last1= Painter|first1= Joe|last2= Jeffrey|first2= Alex|title= Political Geography|date= 2009|publisher= SAGE Publications Ltd.|location= London, GBR|page= 169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the absence of European farming techniques, Europeans deemed the land unaltered by man and therefore treated it as uninhabited, despite the presence of indigenous populations. In the 19th century, laws and ideas such as [[Mexico]]'s [[General Colonization Law]] and the [[United States]]' [[manifest destiny]] doctrine encouraged further [[colonization of the Americas]], already started in the 15th century.

== Historical colonizations ==

=== Classical period ===

In ancient times, maritime nations such as the city-states of [[Greece]] and [[Phoenicia]] often established colonies to farm what they believed was uninhabited land. Land suitable for farming was often occupied by migratory '[[barbarian]] tribes' who lived by hunting and gathering. To ancient Greeks and Phoenicians, these lands were regarded as simply vacant.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} However, this did not mean that conflict did not exist between the colonizers and local/native peoples. Greeks and Phoenicians also established colonies with the intent of regulating and expanding trade throughout the Mediterranean and Middle East.

Another period of colonization in ancient times was during the [[Roman Empire]]. The Roman Empire conquered large parts of [[Western Europe]], [[North Africa]] and [[West Asia]]. In North Africa and West Asia, the Romans often conquered what they regarded as 'civilized' peoples. As they moved north into Europe, they mostly encountered rural peoples/tribes with very little in the way of cities. In these areas, waves of Roman colonization often followed the conquest of the areas. Many of the current cities throughout Europe began as Roman colonies, such as [[Cologne]], Germany, originally called ''[[Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium]]'' by the Romans, and the [[United Kingdom|British]] capital city of [[London]], which the Romans founded as ''[[Londinium]]''.

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:Colonisation 1550.png|thumb|right|World empires and colonies 1550]]
[[File:Colonial empires in 1800.svg|thumb|World empires and colonies 1800]]
The decline and collapse of the Roman Empire saw (and was partly caused by) the large-scale movement of people in [[Eastern Europe]] and Asia. This is largely seen as beginning with nomadic horsemen from Asia (specifically the [[Huns]]) moving into the richer pasture land to the west, thus forcing the local people there to move further west and so on until eventually the [[Goths]] were forced to cross into the Roman Empire, resulting in continuous war with Rome which played a major role in the fall of the Roman Empire. During this period there were the large-scale movements of peoples establishing new colonies all over western Europe.  The events of this time saw the development of many of the modern day nations of Europe like the [[Franks]] in France and Germany and the [[Anglo-Saxons]] in England.

In West Asia, during [[Sassanid Empire]], some Persians established colonies in [[Yemen]] and [[Oman]]. The [[Arabs]] also established colonies in [[Northern Africa]], [[Mesopotamia]], and the [[Levant]], and remain the dominant majority to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Pact Of Umar

The vast lands in southwest Asia, northern Africa, and elsewhere, which in later times came to constitute the lands of Islam, the realms of the caliphs and, in modern parlance, the Arab world, still spoke other languages, professed other religions, and obeyed other rulers. Within little more than a century after the Prophet’s death, the whole area had been transformed, in what was surely one of the swiftest and most dramatic changes in the whole of human history.  By the late seventh century, the outside world attests the emergence of a new religion and a new power, the Muslim empire of the caliphs, extending eastward in Asia as far as and sometimes beyond the borders of India and China, westwards along the southern Mediterranean coast to the Atlantic, southwards towards the land of the black peoples in Africa, northwards into the lands of the white peoples of Europe. In this empire, Islam was the state religion, and the Arabic language was rapidly displacing others to become the principal medium public life.&quot; Lewis, Bernard.

The [[Vikings]] of [[Scandinavia]] also carried out a large-scale colonization. The Vikings are best known as raiders, setting out from their original homelands in [[Denmark]], southern [[Norway]] and southern [[Sweden]], to pillage the coastlines of northern Europe. In time, the Vikings began trading, and established colonies. The Vikings discovered [[Iceland]] and established colonies before moving onto [[Greenland]], where they briefly held some colonies. The Vikings launched an unsuccessful attempt at colonizing an area they called [[Vinland]], which is probably at a site now known as [[L'Anse aux Meadows]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], on the eastern coastline of [[Canada]].

=== Modern colonialism ===
{{main article|Colonialism}}
In the Colonial Era, colonialism in this context refers mostly to Western European countries' colonization of lands mainly in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania. The main European countries active in this form of colonization included [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[France]], the [[Kingdom of England]] (later [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]), the [[Netherlands]], and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (now Germany), and, beginning in the 18th century, the [[United States]]. Most of these countries had a period of almost complete power in world trade at some stage in the period from roughly 1500 to 1900. Beginning in the late 19th century, [[Imperial Japan]] also engaged in settler colonization, most notably in [[Hokkaido]] and [[Korea]].

Some reports characterize [[China|Chinese]] activities in [[Tibet]] as colonization.&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Tibetan Stonewall of China'', {{ISBN|1902681118}}, page 141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= China's Tibet: The World's Largest Remaining Colony: Report of a Fact-Finding Mission and Analyses of Colonialism and Chinese Rule in Tibet| year= 1997| publisher= [[UNPO]] (Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization)| location= The Hague}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many European colonization schemes focused on shorter-term exploitation of economic opportunities ([[Newfoundland Colony|Newfoundland]], for example, or [[Siberia]]) or addressed specific goals ([[Massachusetts]] or [[New South Wales]]), a tradition developed of careful long-term social and economic planning for both parties, but more on the colonizing countries themselves, based on elaborate theory-building (note [[James Oglethorpe]]'s [[Colony of Georgia]] in the 1730s and [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]]'s [[New Zealand Company|New Zealand]] in the 1840s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1                 = Morgan| first1= Philip D.| authorlink1= Philip D.

Colonization may be used as a method of absorbing and assimilating foreign people into the culture of the imperial country, and thus destroying any remnant of the cultures that might threaten the imperial territory over the long term by inspiring reform.

===Russia===
During the [[Russian Empire]], a policy of [[Russification]] was followed, in order to impose the Russian language and culture on conquered people in territory adjacent to Russia itself. In this way, the Russian Empire aimed to gradually, and permanently, expand its territory by erasing foreign cultures{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}. Foreign languages within its territory were banned, as were foreign religions.

The Soviet regime in the 1920s tried to win the trust of non-Russians by promoting their ethnic cultures and establishing for them many of the characteristic institutional forms of the nation-state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Terry Martin 2001 1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Terry Martin|title=The Affirmative Action Empire: Nations and Nationalism in the Soviet Union, 1923-1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rdlSX2hsb1kC&amp;q=%22institutional+forms+of+the+nation-state%22|year=2001|publisher=Cornell University press|page=1|isbn=0801486777}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early Soviet regime was hostile to even voluntary assimilation, and tried to derussify assimilated non-Russians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Terry Martin 2001 32&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Terry Martin|title=The Affirmative Action Empire: Nations and Nationalism in the Soviet Union, 1923-1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rdlSX2hsb1kC&amp;q=%22measures+of+derussification%22|year=2001|publisher=Cornell University press|page=32|isbn=0801486777}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents and students not interested in the promotion of their national languages were labeled as displaying &quot;abnormal attitudes&quot;.

By the early 1930s this extreme multiculturalist policy proved unworkable and the Soviet regime introduced a limited russification&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard Overy 2004 558&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Overy|title=The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=32Vy2Fj4KFUC&amp;q=%22limited+russification%22|year=2004|publisher=W.W Norton Company, Inc|page=558|isbn=9780141912240}}&lt;/ref&gt; for practical reasons; voluntary assimilation, which was often a popular demand,&lt;ref name=&quot;Terry Martin 2001 409&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Terry Martin|title=The Affirmative Action Empire: Nations and Nationalism in the Soviet Union, 1923-1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rdlSX2hsb1kC&amp;q=%22long-standing+popular+demand%22|year=2001|publisher=Cornell University press|page=409|isbn=0801486777}}&lt;/ref&gt; was allowed.

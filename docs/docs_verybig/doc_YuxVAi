The '''Gulf of Guinea''' is the northeasternmost part of the tropical [[Atlantic Ocean]] from [[Cape Lopez]] in [[Gabon]], north and west to [[Cape Palmas]] in [[Liberia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;iho&quot; /&gt; The intersection of the [[Equator]] and [[Prime Meridian]] (zero degrees [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]) is in the gulf.

Among the many rivers that drain into the Gulf of Guinea are the [[Niger River|Niger]] and the [[Volta River|Volta]]. The coastline on the gulf includes the [[Bight of Benin]] and the [[Bight of Bonny]].

==Name==
The origin of the name Guinea is thought to be an area in the region, although the specifics are disputed. Bovill (1995) gives a thorough description:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hale|first=Thomas A.|title=From the Griot of Roots to the Roots of Griot: A New Look at the Origins of a Controversial African Term for Bard|url=http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/12ii/2_Hale.pdf|work=Oral Tradition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The name Guinea is usually said to have been a corrupt form of the name Ghana, picked up by the Portuguese in the [[Maghreb|Maghrib]]. The present writer finds this unacceptable. The name Guinea has been in use both in the Maghrib and in Europe long before Prince Henry's time. For example, on a map dated about 1320 by the Genoese cartographer Giovanni di Carignano, who got his information about Africa from a fellow-countryman in [[Sijilmasa|Sijilmassa]] [ancient trading city in North Africa], we find Gunuia, and in the Catalan atlas of 1375 as Ginyia. A passage in Leo [Africanus] (vol. III, 822) points to Guinea having been a corrupt form of [[Djenné|Jenne]] [2,000-year-old city in central Mali on Niger river], less famous than Ghana but nevertheless for many centuries famed in the Maghrib as a great market and a seat of learning. The relevant passage reads: &quot;The Kingdom of Ghinea . . . called by the merchants of our nation Gheneoa, by the natural inhabitants thereof Genni and by the Portugals and other people of Europe Ghinea.&quot; But it seems more probable that Guinea derives from'' aguinaou'', the Berber for Negro. Marrakech [city in southeastern Morocco] has a gate, built in the twelfth century, called the Bab Aguinaou, the Gate of the Negro (Delafosse, Haut-Sénégal-Niger, II, 277-278). The modern application of the name Guinea to the coast dates only from 1481. In that year the Portuguese built a fort, [[São Jorge da Mina]] (modern day [[Elmina]]), on the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast region]], and their king, John II, was permitted by the Pope [Sixtus II or Innocent VIII] to style himself Lord of Guinea, a title that survived until the recent extinction of the monarchy.|author=|title=|source=}}

The name &quot;[[Guinea (region)|Guinea]]&quot; was also applied to south coast of [[West Africa]], north of the Gulf of Guinea, which became known as &quot;Upper Guinea&quot;, and the west coast of [[Southern Africa]], to the east, which became known as &quot;Lower Guinea&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The name &quot;Guinea&quot; is still attached to the names of three countries in Africa: [[Guinea]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], and [[Equatorial Guinea]], as well as [[New Guinea]] in [[Melanesia]].

==Geography==
The main river shedding its waters in the gulf is the [[Niger River]].

Different definitions of the geographic limits of the Gulf of Guinea are given; the [[International Hydrographic Organization]] defines the southwest extent of the Gulf of Guinea as &quot;A line from Cap Lopez ({{Coord|0|37|S|8|43|E}}), in Gabon, northwestward to [[Ilhéu das Rolas|Ihléu Gago Coutinho (Ilhéu das Rôlas)]] ({{Coord|0|01|S|6|32|E}}); and thence a line from Ihléu Gago Coutinho northwestward to Cape Palmas ({{Coord|4|22|N|7|44|W}}), in Liberia.&lt;ref name=&quot;iho&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iho.int/mtg_docs/com_wg/S-23WG/S-23WG_Misc/Draft_2002/S-23_Draft_2002_NORTH_ATLANTIC.doc|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, Draft 4th Edition: North Atlantic Ocean and its Sub-Divisions|year=2002|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|accessdate=5 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035046/http://www.iho.int/mtg_docs/com_wg/S-23WG/S-23WG_Misc/Draft_2002/S-23_Draft_2002_NORTH_ATLANTIC.doc|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islands in the Gulf of Guinea===
The Gulf of Guinea contains a number of islands, the largest of which are in a southwest-northeast chain, forming part of the [[Cameroon line]] of volcanoes.

[[Annobón]], also known as Pagalu or Pigalu, is an island that is part of [[Equatorial Guinea]].

[[Bobowasi Island]] is an island off the west coast of Africa in the Gulf of Guinea that is part of the [[Western Region (Ghana)|Western Region]] of [[Ghana]].

[[Bioko]] is an [[island]] off the [[Ambazonian]] region of Cameroon in the Gulf of Guinea under the sovereignty of Equatorial Guinea.

[[Corisco]] is an island belonging to Equatorial Guinea.

[[Elobey Grande]] and [[Elobey Chico]] are two small islands belonging to Equatorial Guinea.

[[São Tomé and Príncipe]] (officially the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe) is a Portuguese-speaking [[island nation]] in the Gulf of Guinea that became independent from [[Portugal]] in 1975. It is located off the western equatorial coast of Africa and consists of two islands, [[São Tomé Island|São Tomé]] and [[Príncipe]]. They are located about {{convert|140|km|mi|0}} apart and about {{convert|250|and|225|km|mi|0}}, respectively, off the northwestern coast of [[Gabon]]. Both islands are part of an [[Cameroon line|extinct]] [[volcano|volcanic]] [[mountain range]]. São Tomé, the sizeable southern island, is situated just north of the [[Equator]].

The '''Volta River''' is the main [[Drainage system (geomorphology)|river system]] in the [[West Africa]]n country of [[Ghana]]. It flows south into Ghana from Bobo-Dioulasso highlands of [[Burkina Faso]]. The main part of the river are the [[Black Volta]], the [[White Volta]], and the [[Red Volta]]. In the northwest, the Black Volta forms the international borders between the [[Ivory Coast]], Ghana, and Burkina Faso. The Volta flows southward along Akwapim-Togoland highlands, and it empties into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] at the [[Gulf of Guinea]] at [[Ada Foah]]. It has a smaller tributary river, the [[Oti River|Oti]], which enters Ghana from [[Togo]] in the east. The Volta River has been dammed at [[Akosombo]] for the purpose of generating [[hydroelectricity]]. The [[reservoir]] named [[Lake Volta]] stretches from [[Akosombo Dam]] in the south to the northern part of the country, and is the largest man-made reservoir by area in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lake Volta, Ghana|url=https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=58197|website=Visible Earth|publisher=NASA|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The reservoir==
Lake Volta is a reservoir impounded by the [[Akosombo Dam]] on the lower Volta River in southern Ghana. It is one of the largest reservoirs in the world. It extends from the Akosombo Dam in southeastern Ghana to the town of [[Yapei]] in the [[Central Gonja District]], [[Northern Region of Ghana]], some {{convert|400|km|mi}} to the north.

The dam's [[power plant]] generates electricity for the [[Volta River Authority]], and the reservoir also provides water transport routes. It may be a resource for [[irrigation]] and [[fish farming]].

The depth of the river is about {{convert|45|ft|m}} below Lake Volta. The Volta River is crossed by the [[Adome Bridge]] just below the Akosombo Dam.

==History==
The Volta River was named by Portuguese [[gold]] traders in Ghana. It was their farthest extent of exploration before returning (''volta'' is [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for &quot;twist&quot; or &quot;turn&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Volta - etymology&quot;/&gt; ''&quot;River of return&quot;'' (perhaps because it was where ships turned around and headed for home) or “river of the bend”, in reference to its curved course.&lt;ref name=&quot;Volta - etymology&quot;&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Volta&amp;searchmode=none Volta - etymology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bakewell&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Wilks,Ivor.

'''&quot;Marty&quot;''' is a 1953 [[television play]] by [[Paddy Chayefsky]]. It was telecast live May 24, 1953, on ''[[The Philco Television Playhouse]]'' with [[Rod Steiger]] in the title role and [[Nancy Marchand]], in her television debut, playing opposite him as Clara. Chayefsky's story of a decent, hard-working [[The Bronx|Bronx]] butcher, pining for the company of a woman in his life but despairing of ever finding true love in a relationship, was produced by [[Fred Coe]] with associate producer Gordon Duff.&lt;ref name=two/&gt;

The teleplay was adapted into the feature film ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'' starring [[Ernest Borgnine]] in 1955. It was directed by [[Delbert Mann]] and written by Chayefsky. The film won both the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] and the [[Palme d'Or]] award at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and Borgnine won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chronopoulos|first=Themis|title=&quot;Paddy Chayefsky’s ‘Marty’ and Its Significance to the Social History of Arthur Avenue, The Bronx, in the 1950s.&quot; The Bronx County Historical Society Journal XLIV (Spring/Fall 2007): 50-59.|url=http://themis.slass.org/marty.html|accessdate=2012-06-06|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120181558/http://themis.slass.org/marty.html|archivedate=2013-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
In his collected ''Television Plays'' (1955), Chayefsky recalled:
:I set out in ''Marty'' to write a love story, the most ordinary love story in the world. I didn't want my hero to be handsome, and I didn't want the girl to be pretty. I wanted to write a love story the way it would literally have happened to the kind of people I know... The actor who played Marty, Rod Steiger, is one of the most gifted young actors in the theater, and I owe him a genuine debt of gratitude for all that he contributed to this show.&lt;ref name=two&gt;Chayefsky, Paddy. &quot;Two Choices of Material&quot;. ''Television Plays'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story originated by chance when [[Delbert Mann]] and Chayefsky were rehearsing ''The Reluctant Citizen'' in the old Abbey Hotel's ballroom on West 51st Street, which was also used for Friday night meetings of the Friendship Club. After Chayefsky wandered around and spotted a sign which read, &quot;Girls, Dance With the Man Who Asks You. Remember, Men Have Feelings, Too&quot;, he told Mann he thought there was a play possibility about a young woman in that type of setting. Speaking to Mann later that day, he told him that such a drama could work better with a man as the central character rather than a woman. Mann told him to go talk to Fred Coe, which Chayefsky did. He pitched the idea by simply saying, &quot;I want to do a play about a guy who goes to a ballroom.&quot; Coe told him to start writing it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lFTZrcyWnswC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=marty+chayefsky+goodyear&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hO1fTdKyOYLGlQe37uWwDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=marty%20chayefsky%20goodyear&amp;f=false Stempel, Tom. ''Storytellers to the Nation: A History of American Television Writing''. Syracuse University Press, 1992.]&lt;/ref&gt;  

As Chayefsky was in the middle of writing the script (at this point entitled &quot;Love Story&quot;), Coe and Mann unexpectedly rejected another script that was scheduled for production.  Coe then called Chayefsky to ask him how the &quot;Love Story&quot; script was going, hoping that it could be put into production immediately.  At that point, Chayefsky was partway through act 2, and thought he could have it finished in a few weeks, but after talking with Coe he agreed to turn around material in only a few days.  

The piece was cast and rehearsals got underway with only acts 1 &amp; 2 having been delivered. Chayefsky delivered Act 3 one day later than expected, but still in time to give the cast and crew several days of rehearsal with the complete teleplay.   

Chayefsky's original title &quot;Love Story&quot; was deemed unacceptable by NBC, who requested the title be changed.  Chayefsky's alternative title of &quot;Marty&quot; was used instead.

==Reception==
Tony Schwartz reviewed the television production in ''The New York Times'':
{{quote|It's the stark, simple portrait of a gentle, lonely man, played by Rod Steiger, who lives with his mother, works as a butcher and longs for a loving relationship as he heads toward middle age. &quot;I'm 36 years old and I've been lookin' for a girl every Saturday night of my life,&quot; he tells his best friend. &quot;I'm a fat little ugly guy and girls don't go for me, that's all.&quot; It's just that sort of unfettered sentiment that gives the drama such powerful resonance. The story centers mostly on a single Saturday night in Marty's life. After despairing about how to spend it, and then suffering another humiliating rejection when he calls a girl to ask her out, Marty finally decides to attend a lonely hearts social at the Waverly Ballroom. There he meets a girl (Nancy Marchand) who has just been ditched by her blind date&amp;mdash;a slick fellow who offers Marty &quot;five bucks if you take this dog home for me&quot;. Marty approaches her, and in their mutual misery they find a bond. She rejects his first fumbling attempt to kiss her, but mostly in an effort not to seem overeager. Even in the afterglow of a wonderful evening, Marty is subjected the next day to ridicule from his friends, who insist that the girl is a homely loser not worth pursuing. The story hinges on whether he'll follow their advice or follow his own instincts to see her again. The drama is most convincing when it sticks with Marty&amp;mdash;and much less so when it drifts off into a stilted subplot about his mother's attempts to convince a sister to move into their household. Because the whole play is less than an hour long (a subsequent film version of the play ran 90 minutes), the second story simply gets in the way.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/27/arts/tv-golden-age-series-opening-with-marty.html Schwartz, Tony. &quot;TV: 'Golden Age' series opening with 'Marty'&quot;, ''The New York Times'', August 27, 1981.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The acclaimed television drama was honored a decade later when the [[kinescope]] of the production was selected for showing at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] on February 17–20, 1963, as part of ''Television USA: Thirteen Seasons'', described by MoMA Film Library curator Richard Griffith as &quot;a grand retrospective of the best that has been done in American television.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/docs/press_archives/3099/releases/MOMA_1963_0011_10.pdf?2010 Museum of Modern Art: &quot;Television USA: Thirteen Seasons&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was released on VHS by [[Wood Knapp Video]].

The original 1953 telecast is commercially available as part of a three-DVD set, &quot;The Golden Age of Television&quot; ([[Criterion Collection]]), a series which aired on PBS in 1981 with [[Eva Marie Saint]] as the host of ''Marty''. It features interviews with Steiger, Marchand and Mann.

Only Esther Minciotti, Augusta Ciolli and Joe Mantell repeated their 1953 TV drama roles in the 1955 film adaptation. Steiger turned down the opportunity to repeat his role in the film because he did not want to compromise his independence, while producers [[Burt Lancaster|Hecht-Lancaster]] insisted he sign a multi-picture contract.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1956/01/29/archives/rod-steiger-from-va-to-vip-on-screen-japanese-triangle.html Schmidt, M.A. &quot;Rod Steiger: From V.A. to V.I.P. on Screen&quot;, ''The New York Times'', January 29, 1956.]&lt;/ref&gt;

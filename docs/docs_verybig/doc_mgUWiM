By spring 1834, Schumann had sufficiently recovered to inaugurate ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik|Die Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]'' (&quot;New Journal for Music&quot;), first published on 3 April 1834. In his writings, Schumann created a fictional music society based on people in his life, called the ''[[Davidsbündler]]'', named after the biblical King David who fought against the Philistines. Schumann published most of his critical writings in the journal, and often lambasted the popular taste for flashy technical displays from figures whom Schumann perceived as inferior composers, or &quot;philistines&quot;. Schumann campaigned to revive interest in major composers of the past, including [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]]. He also promoted the work of some contemporary composers, including [[Chopin]] (about whom Schumann famously wrote, &quot;Hats off, Gentlemen! A genius!&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Ashkenazy]]'s notes, Favourite Chopin&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hector Berlioz]], whom he praised for creating music of substance. On the other hand, Schumann disparaged the school of [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Richard Wagner]]. Among Schumann's associates at this time were composers [[Norbert Burgmüller]] and [[Ludwig Schuncke]] (to whom Schumann dedicated his ''Toccata in C'').{{sfn|Schumann|1965}}{{sfn|Schumann|1982}}

====''Carnaval''====

''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'', Op. 9 (1834) is one of Schumann's most characteristic piano works. Schumann begins nearly every section of ''Carnaval'' with a [[musical cryptogram]], the musical notes signified in German by the letters that spell [[Aš|Asch]] (A, E-flat, C, and B, or alternatively A-flat, C, and B; in German these are A, Es, C and H, and As, C and H respectively), the [[Bohemia]]n town in which Ernestine was born, and the notes are also the musical letters in Schumann's own name. Eusebius and Florestan, the imaginary figures appearing so often in his critical writings, also appear, alongside brilliant imitations of Chopin and Paganini. To each of these characters he devotes a section of ''Carnaval''. The work comes to a close with a march of the ''Davidsbündler''—the league of [[King David]]'s men against the [[Philistines]]—in which may be heard the clear accents of truth in contest with the dull clamour of falsehood embodied in a [[Musical quotation|quotation]] from the seventeenth century ''[[Grossvatertanz|Grandfather's Dance]]''. The march, a step nearly always in duple meter, is here in 3/4 time (triple meter). The work ends in joy and a degree of mock-triumph. In ''Carnaval'', Schumann went further than in ''Papillons'', by conceiving the story as well as the musical representation (and also displaying a maturation of compositional resource).

==== Relationships ====

During the summer of 1834 Schumann became engaged to 16-year-old Ernestine von Fricken, the adopted daughter of a rich Bohemian-born noble. In August 1835, he learned that Ernestine was born illegitimate, which meant that she would have no dowry. Fearful that her limited means would force him to earn his living like a &quot;day-labourer,&quot; Schumann completely broke with her toward the end of the year. He felt a growing attraction to 15-year-old Clara Wieck. They made mutual declarations of love in December in Zwickau, where Clara appeared in concert. His budding romance with Clara was disrupted when her father learned of their trysts during the Christmas holidays. He summarily forbade them further meetings, and ordered all their correspondence burnt.

===1835–39===

On 3 October 1835, Schumann met [[Felix Mendelssohn]] at Wieck's house in Leipzig, and his enthusiastic appreciation of that artist&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Daverio|1997|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; was shown with the same generous freedom that distinguished his acknowledgement of the greatness of Chopin and other colleagues, and later prompted him to publicly pronounce the then-unknown [[Johannes Brahms]] a genius.

In 1837 Schumann published his ''[[Symphonic Studies (Schumann)|Symphonic Studies]]'', a complex set of ''étude''-like variations written in 1834–1835, which demanded a finished piano technique. These variations were based on a theme by the adoptive father of Ernestine von Fricken. The work—described as &quot;one of the peaks of the piano literature, lofty in conception and faultless in workmanship&quot; [Hutcheson]—was dedicated to the young English composer [[William Sterndale Bennett]], for whom Schumann had had a high regard when they worked together in Leipzig.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The ''[[Davidsbündlertänze]]'', Op.&amp;nbsp;6, (also published in 1837 despite the low opus number) literally &quot;Dances of the League of David&quot;, is an embodiment of the struggle between enlightened Romanticism and musical philistinism. Schumann credited the two sides of his character with the composition of the work (the more passionate numbers are signed F. (Florestan) and the more dreamy signed E. (Eusebius)). The work begins with the &quot;motto of C.&amp;nbsp;W.&quot; (Clara Wieck) denoting her support for the ideals of the ''Davidsbund''. The ''Bund'' was a music society of Schumann's imagination, members of which were kindred spirits (as he saw them) such as Chopin, Paganini and Clara, as well as the personalized Florestan and Eusebius.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

''[[Kinderszenen]]'', Op. 15, completed in 1838 and a favourite of Schumann's piano works, depicts the innocence and playfulness of childhood. The &quot;Träumerei&quot; in F major, No. 7 of the set, is one of the most famous piano pieces ever written, and has been performed in myriad forms and transcriptions. It has been the favourite [[Encore (concert)|encore]] of several great pianists, including [[Vladimir Horowitz]]. Melodic and deceptively simple, the piece is &quot;complex&quot; in its harmonic structure.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alban Berg]], replying to charges that modern music was overly complex, pointed out that ''Kinderszenen'' is constructed on a complex base.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Kreisleriana]]'', Op. 16 (1838), considered one of Schumann's greatest works, carried his fantasy and emotional range deeper. [[Johannes Kreisler]] was a fictional musician created by poet [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]], and characterized as a &quot;romantic brought into contact with reality.&quot; Schumann used the figure to express &quot;fantastic and mad&quot; emotional states. According to [[Ernest Hutcheson#Works|Hutcheson (&quot;The Literature of the Piano&quot;)]], this work is &quot;among the finest efforts of Schumann's genius. He never surpassed the searching beauty of the slow movements (Nos. 2, 4, 6) or the urgent passion of others (Nos. 1, 3, 5, 7) […] To appreciate it a high level of aesthetic intelligence is required […] This is no facile music, there is severity alike in its beauty and its passion.&quot;

The ''[[Fantasie in C (Schumann)|Fantasie in C]]'', Op. 17, composed in the summer of 1836, is a work of passion and deep pathos, imbued with the spirit of the late Beethoven. Schumann intended to use proceeds from sales of the work toward the construction of [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|a monument to Beethoven]], who had died in 1827. The first movement of the ''Fantasie'' contains a [[Musical quotation|musical quote]] from Beethoven's song cycle, ''[[An die ferne Geliebte]]'', Op. 98 (at the Adagio coda, taken from the last song of the cycle). The original titles of the movements were ''Ruins'', ''Triumphal Arch'', and ''The Starry Crown''. According to [[Franz Liszt]],&lt;ref&gt;Strelezki: ''Personal Recollections of Chats with Liszt''&lt;/ref&gt; who played the work for Schumann and to whom it was dedicated, the ''Fantasie'' was apt to be played too heavily, and should have a dreamier (''träumerisch'') character than vigorous German pianists tended to impart. Liszt also said: &quot;It is a noble work, worthy of Beethoven, whose career, by the way, it is supposed to represent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Anton Strelezki: ''Personal Recollections of Chats with Liszt''. London, 1893.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, according to Hutcheson: &quot;No words can describe the Phantasie, no quotations set forth the majesty of its genius. It must suffice to say that it is Schumann's greatest work in large form for piano solo.&quot;{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

After a visit to [[Vienna]], during which he discovered [[Franz Schubert]]'s previously unknown [[Symphony No. 9 (Schubert)|Symphony No. 9 in C]], in 1839 Schumann wrote the ''[[Faschingsschwank aus Wien]]'' (''Carnival Prank from Vienna''). Most of the joke is in the central section of the first movement, which makes a thinly veiled reference to ''[[La Marseillaise]]''. (Vienna had banned the song due to harsh memories of [[Napoleon]]'s invasion.) The festive mood does not preclude moments of melancholic introspection in the Intermezzo.

===1840–49===

From 1832 to 1839, Schumann wrote almost exclusively for piano, but in 1840 alone he wrote at least 138 songs. Indeed, 1840 (the ''Liederjahr'' or ''year of song'') is highly significant in Schumann's musical legacy, despite his earlier deriding of works for piano and voice as inferior.

[[File:Leipzig Schumann-Haus.jpg|thumb|[[Schumann House, Leipzig]]: Robert and Clara Schumann lived in an apartment here from 1840 to 1844.]]
After a long and acrimonious legal battle with her father, Schumann married Clara Wieck on 12 September 1840, at [[Leipzig-Schönefeld|Schönefeld]], the day before her 21st birthday. Had they waited another day, they would no longer have required her father's consent. Their marriage supported a remarkable business partnership, with Clara  acting as an inspiration, critic, and confidante to her husband. Despite her delicate appearance, she was an extremely strong-willed and energetic woman, who kept up a demanding schedule of concert tours in between bearing several children. Two years after their marriage, Friedrich Wieck at last reconciled himself with the couple, eager to see his grandchildren.

Prior to the legal case and subsequent marriage, the lovers exchanged love letters and rendezvoused in secret. Robert often waited for hours in a cafe in a nearby city just to see Clara for a few minutes after one of her concerts. The strain of this long courtship and its consummation may have led to this great outpouring of Lieder (vocal songs with piano accompaniment). This is evident in ''Widmung'', for example, where he uses the melody from [[Franz Schubert|Schubert's]] [[Ave Maria (Schubert)|''Ave Maria'']] in the postlude in homage to Clara. Schumann's biographers attribute the sweetness, doubt, and despair of these songs to the emotions aroused by his love for Clara and the uncertainties of their future together.

Robert and Clara had eight children, Emil (1846–1847), who died at 1 year; Marie (1841–1929); Elise (1843–1928); Julie (1845–1872); Ludwig (1848–1899); Ferdinand (1849–1891); [[Eugenie Schumann|Eugenie]] (1851–1938); and Felix (1854–1879).

His chief song-cycles in this period were settings of the ''[[Liederkreis, Op. 39|Liederkreis]]'' of [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff|Joseph von Eichendorff]], Op. 39 (depicting a series of moods relating to or inspired by nature); the ''[[Frauenliebe und -leben]]'' of [[Adelbert von Chamisso|Chamisso]], Op. 42 (relating the tale of a woman's marriage, childbirth and widowhood); the ''[[Dichterliebe]]'' of [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]], Op. 48 (depicting a lover rejected, but coming to terms with his painful loss through renunciation and forgiveness); and ''Myrthen'', a collection of songs, including poems by Goethe, [[Friedrich Rückert|Rückert]], Heine, Byron, [[Robert Burns|Burns]] and Moore. The songs ''Belsatzar'', Op. 57 and ''Die beiden Grenadiere'', Op. 49, both to Heine's words, show Schumann at his best as a ballad writer, although the dramatic ballad is less congenial to him than the introspective lyric. The Op. 35, 40 and 98a sets (words by [[Justinus Kerner]], Chamisso and Goethe respectively), although less well known, also contain songs of lyric and dramatic quality.

In 1841 he wrote two of his four symphonies, [[Symphony No. 1 (Schumann)|No. 1 in B-flat]], Op. 38, ''Spring'' and [[Symphony No. 4 (Schumann)|No. 4 in D minor]] (the latter a pioneering work in &quot;cyclic form&quot;, was performed that year but published only much later after revision and extensive re-orchestration as Op. 120). He devoted 1842 to composing chamber music, including the [[Piano Quintet (Schumann)|Piano Quintet in E-flat]], Op. 44, now one of his best known and most admired works; the [[Piano Quartet (Schumann)|Piano Quartet]] and [[String Quartets (Schumann)|three string quartets]]. In 1843 he wrote ''[[Paradise and the Peri]]'', his first attempt at concerted vocal music, an [[oratorio]] style work based on ''[[Lalla-Rookh]]'' by [[Thomas Moore]]. After this, his compositions were not confined to any one form during any particular period.

The stage in his life when he was deeply engaged in setting Goethe's ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' to music (1844–53) was a turbulent one for his health. He spent the first half of 1844 with Clara on tour in Russia, and his depression grew worse as he felt inferior to Clara as a musician. On returning to Germany, he abandoned his editorial work and left Leipzig for [[Dresden]], where he suffered from persistent &quot;[[nervous prostration]]&quot;. As soon as he began to work, he was seized with fits of shivering and an apprehension of death, experiencing an abhorrence of high places, all metal instruments (even keys), and drugs. Schumann's diaries also state that he suffered perpetually from imagining that he had the [[A (musical note)#Designation by octave|note A5]] sounding in his ears.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

His state of unease and [[neurasthenia]] is reflected in his [[Symphony No. 2 (Schumann)|Symphony in C]], numbered second but third in order of composition, in which the composer explores states of exhaustion, obsession, and depression, culminating in Beethovenian spiritual triumph. Also published in 1845 was his [[Piano Concerto (Schumann)|Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 54]], originally conceived and performed as a one-movement ''Fantasy for Piano and Orchestra'' in 1841. It is one of the most popular and oft-recorded of all piano concertos; according to Hutcheson &quot;Schumann achieved a masterly work and we inherited the finest piano concerto since Mozart and Beethoven&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Robert u Clara Schumann 1847.jpg|thumb|left|Robert and Clara Schumann in 1847, lithograph with a personal dedication]]

In 1846, he felt he had recovered. In the winter, the Schumanns revisited Vienna, traveling to [[Prague]] and Berlin in the spring of 1847 and in the summer to Zwickau, where he was received with enthusiasm. This pleased him, since until that time he was famous in only Dresden and Leipzig.

His only opera, ''[[Genoveva]]'', Op. 81, premiered in Spring 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Daverio|1997|p=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Schumann attempted to abolish [[recitative]], which he regarded as an interruption to the musical flow (an influence on [[Richard Wagner]]; Schumann's consistently flowing melody can be seen as a forerunner to Wagner's ''Melos''). The subject of ''Genoveva''—based on [[Ludwig Tieck]] and [[Christian Friedrich Hebbel]]'s plays—was not seen an ideal choice. The text is often considered to lack dramatic qualities; the work has not remained in the repertoire. As early as 1842 the possibilities of German opera had been keenly realized by Schumann, who wrote, &quot;Do you know my prayer as an artist, night and morning? It is called 'German Opera.' Here is a real field for enterprise ... something simple, profound, German&quot;. And in his notebook of suggestions for the text of operas are found amongst others: ''[[Nibelung]]en'', ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' and ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]''.

The music to [[Lord Byron|Byron]]'s ''[[Manfred]]'' was written in 1849, the overture of which is one of Schumann's most frequently performed orchestral works. The [[May Uprising in Dresden|insurrection of Dresden]] caused Schumann to move to [[Kreischa]], a little village a few miles outside the city. In August 1849, on the occasion of the centenary of Goethe's birth, completed scenes of Schumann's ''[[Scenes from Goethe's Faust]]'' were performed in Dresden, Leipzig and [[Weimar]]. Liszt gave him assistance and encouragement. The rest of the work was written later in 1849, and the overture (which Schumann described as &quot;one of the sturdiest of [his] creations&quot;) in 1853.

=== After 1850 ===
[[File:Schumann-photo1850.jpg|thumb|right|Robert Schumann in an 1850 [[daguerreotype]]]]
From 1850 to 1854, Schumann composed in a wide variety of genres. Critics have disputed the quality of his work at this time; a widely held view has been that his music showed signs of mental breakdown and creative decay. More recently, critics have suggested that the changes in style may be explained by &quot;lucid experimentation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Daverio|Sams|2001|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1850, Schumann succeeded [[Ferdinand Hiller]] as musical director at [[Düsseldorf]], but he was a poor conductor and quickly aroused the opposition of the musicians. According to [[Harold C. Schonberg]], in his 1967 ''The Great Conductors'': &quot;The great composer was impossible on the platform ... There is something heartrending about poor Schumann's epochal inefficiency as a conductor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/greatconductors0000unse |url-access=registration |author=[[Harold C. Schonberg]] |title=The Great Conductors |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |year=1967 |page=[https://archive.org/details/greatconductors0000unse/page/126 126]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His contract was eventually terminated. By the end of that year he completed his [[Symphony No. 3 (Schumann)|Symphony No. 3, &quot;Rhenish&quot;]] (a work containing five movements and whose 4th movement is apparently intended to represent an episcopal coronation ceremony). In 1851 he revised what would be published as his [[Symphony No. 4 (Schumann)|fourth symphony]]. From 1851 to 1853 he visited Switzerland, Belgium and Leipzig.

On 30 September 1853, the 20-year-old composer [[Johannes Brahms]] arrived unannounced at the door of the Schumanns carrying a letter of introduction from violinist [[Joseph Joachim]]. (Schumann was not at home, and would not meet Brahms until the next day.) Brahms amazed Clara and Robert with his music, stayed with them for several weeks, and became a close family friend. (He later worked closely with Clara to popularize Schumann's compositions during her long widowhood.)

During this time Schumann, Brahms and Schumann's pupil [[Albert Dietrich]] collaborated on the composition of the ''[[F-A-E Sonata|''F-A-E'' Sonata]]'' for Joachim; Schumann also published an article, &quot;Neue Bahnen&quot; (&quot;New Paths&quot;) in the ''Neue Zeitschrift'' (his first article in many years), hailing the unknown young Brahms from Hamburg, a man who had published nothing, as &quot;the Chosen One&quot; who &quot;was destined to give ideal expression to the times.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Schumann's &quot;Artikel Neue Bahnen&quot;, 28 October 1853&lt;/ref&gt; It was an extraordinary way to present Brahms to the musical world, setting up great expectations that he did not fulfill for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Brahms' [[A German Requiem (Brahms)|''A German Requiem'']], published in 1868, brought the first widespread recognition of his talent.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1854, Schumann went to [[Hanover]], where he heard a performance of his ''Paradise and the Peri'' organized by Joachim and Brahms. Two years later at Schumann's request, the work received its first English performance conducted by [[William Sterndale Bennett]].
[[File:Bonn graveyard robert schumann 20080509.jpg|thumb|upright|Grave of Robert and Clara Schumann at [[Bonn]]]]

Schumann returned to Düsseldorf and began to edit his complete works and make an anthology on the subject of music. He suffered a renewal of the symptoms that had threatened him earlier. Besides the single note sounding in his ear (possibly evidence of [[tinnitus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;) he imagined that voices sounded in his ear and he heard angelic music.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; One night he suddenly left his bed, having dreamt or imagined that a ghost (purportedly the spirit of either Schubert or Mendelssohn) had dictated a &quot;spirit theme&quot; to him. The theme was one he had used several times before: in his Second String Quartet, again in his ''Lieder-Album für die Jugend'', and finally in the slow movement of his [[Violin Concerto (Schumann)|Violin Concerto]]. In the days leading up to his suicide attempt, Schumann wrote five variations on this theme for the piano, his last completed work, today known as the ''[[Geistervariationen]]'' (Ghost Variations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joseph |last=Stevenson |title=Robert Schumann: Variations on an original theme, for piano in E flat major (&quot;Geister-Variationen&quot;), WoO 24 |work=AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/composition/variations-on-an-original-theme-for-piano-in-e-flat-major-geister-variationen-woo-24-mc0002377594 |accessdate=22 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brahms published it in a supplementary volume to the complete edition of Schumann's piano music. In 1861 Brahms published his ''Variations for Piano Four Hands'', Op. 23, based on this theme.

===Final illness and death===

In late February 1854, Schumann's symptoms increased, the angelic visions sometimes being replaced by demonic ones. He warned Clara that he feared he might do her harm. On 27 February, he attempted suicide by throwing himself from a bridge into the [[Rhine]] River (his elder sister Emilie had committed suicide in 1825, possibly by drowning herself). Rescued by boatmen and taken home, he asked to be taken to an asylum for the insane. He entered Dr. Franz Richarz's [[sanatorium]] in [[Endenich]], a quarter of [[Bonn]], and remained there until he died on 29 July 1856 at the age of 46. During his confinement, he was not allowed to see Clara, although Brahms was free to visit him. Clara finally visited him two days before his death. He appeared to recognize her, but was able to speak only a few words.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Daverio|Sams|2001|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given his reported symptoms, one modern view is that he died from [[syphilis]], which he could have contracted during his student days, and which could have remained latent during most of his marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Reich, Nancy B., ''Clara Schumann: The Artist and the Woman,'' Cornell University Press, 1985, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; According to studies by the musicologist and literary scholar [[Eric Sams]], Schumann's symptoms during his terminal illness and death appear consistent with those of [[mercury poisoning]]; mercury was a common treatment for syphilis and other conditions. Another possibility is that his neurological problems were the result of an intracranial mass. A report by Janisch and Nauhaus on Schumann's autopsy indicates that he had a &quot;gelatinous&quot; tumor at the base of the brain; it may have represented a [[colloid cyst]], a [[craniopharyngioma]], a [[chordoma]], or a chordoid [[meningioma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jänisch | first1 = W | last2 = Nauhaus | first2 = G | year = 1986 | title = Autopsy report of the corpse of the composer Robert Schumann: publication and interpretation of a rediscovered document | url = | journal = Zentralbl Allg Pathol | volume = 132 | issue = 2| pages = 129–36 | pmid = 3538703 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, meningiomas are known to produce musical auditory hallucinations such as Schumann reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scott | first1 = M | year = 1979 | title = Musical hallucinations from meningioma | url = | journal = [[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] | volume = 241 | issue = 16| page = 1683 | pmid = 430721 | doi = 10.1001/jama.1979.03290420011006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been hypothesised that he suffered from [[schizophrenia]], or [[schizoaffective disorder]]; bipolar type,&lt;ref&gt;Yasmeen Cooper and Mark Agius, [http://www.psychiatria-danubina.com/UserDocsImages/pdf/dnb_vol30_noSuppl%207/dnb_vol30_noSuppl%207_559.pdf &quot;Does Schizoaffective Disorder Explain the Mental Illness of Robert Schumann and Vincent Van Gogh?&quot;], Psychiatria Danubina, 2018; Vol. 30, Suppl. 7, pp 559-562&lt;/ref&gt; or [[bipolar disorder]] and [[bipolar II disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/196/4/325 |title=Robert Schumann's contribution to the genetics of psychosis |first=Katharina |last=Domschke |journal=British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=196 |issue=4 |page=325 |date=March 2010 |accessdate=17 June 2015|doi=10.1192/bjp.196.4.325 |pmid=20357311 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; His medical records from this illness were released in 1991, and suggest a &quot;progressive paralysis&quot;, a term used for neurosyphilis at the time, although a diagnostic test for ''[[Treponema pallidum]]'' did not become available till 1906.{{sfn|Steinberg|2017}} 

Schumann heard a persistent A-note at the end of his life. It was a form of tinnitus, or perhaps an auditory hallucination related to his major depressive episode. At times, he had musical hallucinations that were longer than just the single A, but his diaries include comments about hearing that annoying single note.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Lindsay. &quot;Since You Asked ...,&quot; Robert Schumann: Then, Now and Always.

After Robert's death, Clara continued her career as a concert pianist, which supported the family. From mid-career on, she mainly performed music by leading composers. A hired cook and housekeeper tended to the children while she traveled. In 1856, she first visited England. The critics received Robert's music coolly, with [[Henry Fothergill Chorley]] being particularly harsh. She returned to London in 1865 and made regular appearances there in later years, often performing chamber music with the violinist [[Joseph Joachim]] and others. She became the authoritative editor of her husband's works for [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]]. It was rumoured that she and Brahms destroyed many of Schumann's later works, which they thought were tainted by his madness, but only the ''Five Pieces for Cello and Piano'' are known to have been destroyed. Most of Schumann's late works, particularly the [[Violin Concerto (Schumann)|Violin Concerto]], the ''Fantasy for Violin and Orchestra'' and the Violin Sonata No. 3, all from 1853, have entered the repertoire.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Schumann had considerable influence in the nineteenth century and beyond, despite his adoption of more conservative modes of composition after his marriage. He left an array of acclaimed music in virtually all the forms then known. Partly through his protégé Brahms, Schumann's ideals and musical vocabulary became widely disseminated. Composer Sir [[Edward Elgar]] called Schumann &quot;my ideal.&quot;

Schumann has often been confused with Austrian composer [[Franz Schubert]]; one well-known example occurred in 1956, when [[East Germany]] issued a pair of postage stamps featuring Schumann's picture against an open score that featured Schubert's music. The stamps were soon replaced by a pair featuring music written by Schumann.

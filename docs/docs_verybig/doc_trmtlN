Major-General '''Thomas Harrison''' (1616 – 13 October 1660) sided with Parliament in the [[English Civil War]]. During the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] he was a leader of the [[Fifth Monarchists]]. In 1649 [[List of regicides of Charles I#Commissioners|he signed the death warrant]] of [[King Charles I of England|Charles I]] and in 1660, shortly after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], he was found guilty of regicide and [[hanged, drawn and quartered]].

== Life and work ==
The son of Richard Harrison, the mayor of [[Newcastle-under-Lyme]], he moved to [[London]] where he was admitted to the [[Inns of Court]] as an attorney at [[Clifford's Inn]]. Whilst a lawyer he met [[Charles Fleetwood]] and [[Edmund Ludlow]]. He enlisted in [[Earl of Essex]]'s lifeguard in 1642 and experienced his baptism of fire at the [[Battle of Powick Bridge]]&lt;ref name=Ashley&gt;{{Citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First English Civil War==
During the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] he declared for Parliament and served in the [[Earl of Manchester]]'s army. He fought in many of the major battles of the war and joined the [[New Model Army]] in 1645. By the end of the conflict he had risen to the rank of major-general and was a noted friend and supporter of [[Oliver Cromwell]].

He was elected to the [[Long Parliament]] for [[Wendover]] in 1646. His regiment maintained strong [[Leveller]] sympathies, mutinying in 1647.&lt;ref name=Ashley /&gt;

==Second English Civil War==
When conflict resumed he was wounded at [[Appleby, Westmorland|Appleby]] in July 1648. He had to return to [[London]] but was well enough to command the escort that brought the King to London in January 1649. Harrison sat as a commissioner (judge) at the trial and was the [[List of regicides of Charles I#Commissioners|seventeenth of fifty-nine commissioners]] to sign the death warrant of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].

In 1650, Harrison was appointed to a military command in [[Wales]] where he was apparently extremely severe. He was promoted to the rank of Major-General in 1651 and commanded the army in England during [[Oliver Cromwell#Scottish campaign: 1650.E2.80.9351|Cromwell's Scottish expedition]]. He fought at the battle of [[Knutsford]] in August and at [[Battle of Worcester|Worcester]] in September 1651.

By the early 1650s Harrison was associated with the radical [[Fifth Monarchists]] and became one of their key speakers. He still supported Cromwell and aided in the dissolution of the [[Rump Parliament]] in April 1653. He opposed the parliament on the basis that it was blocking more stringent religious reforms – he wanted a more &quot;godly&quot; parliament. Harrison was a radical member of the Nominated Assembly ([[Barebones Parliament]]) that replaced Parliament. When the assembly was dissolved, Harrison and others refused to leave and had to be forced out by soldiers. Harrison was dismissed from the Army in December.

Like many, he was outraged by the formation of [[the Protectorate]] and the elevation of Cromwell to [[Lord Protector]]. Under the Protectorate (1653–60) Harrison was imprisoned four times.

== Arrest and trial ==
[[File:Sign outside the Hung, Drawn and Quartered pub (Tower Hill, London).png|thumb|right|Sign outside the ''Hung, Drawn and Quartered'' pub in Tower Hill, London]]
After Cromwell's death Harrison remained quietly in his home, supporting none of the contenders for power. Following the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], Harrison declined to flee and was arrested in May 1660.

He was tried on 11 October 1660. [[Edmond Ludlow]] described the trial in his memoirs,  {{quotation|...(Harrison) not only pleaded not guilty, but justified the sentence passed upon the King (Charles I), and the authority of those who had commissioned him to act as one of his judges.  He plainly told them, when witnesses were produced against him, that he came not thither with an intention to deny anything he had done, but rather to bring it to light, owning his name subscribed to the warrant for executing the King, to be written by himself; charging divers of those who sat on the Bench, as his judges, to have been formerly as active for the cause, in which he had engaged, as himself or any other person; affirming that he had not acted by any other motive than the principles of conscience and justice; for proof of which he said it was well known, he had chosen to be separated from his family, and to suffer a long imprisonment rather than to comply with those who had abused the power they had assumed to the oppression of the people.  He insisted that having done nothing, in relation to the matter in question, otherwise than by the authority of the [[Long Parliament]], he was not justly accountable to this or any other inferior Court; which being a point of law, he desired to have council assigned upon that head; but the Court over-ruled; and by interrupting him frequently, and not permitting him to go on in this defense, they clearly manifested a resolution of gratifying the resentments of the Court upon any terms.  So that a hasty verdict was brought in against him, and the question being asked, if he had anything to say, why judgement should not pass, he only said, that since the Court had refused to hear what was fit for him to speak in his defense, he had no more to say; upon which Bridgeman pronounced the sentence.  And that the inhumanity of these men may the better appear, I ([[Edmond Ludlow]]) must not omit, that the executioner in an ugly dress, with a halter in his hand, was placed near the Major-General, and continued there during the whole time of his trial, which action I doubt whether it was ever equaled by the most barbarous nations.  But having learned to condemn such baseness, after the sentence had been pronounced against him, he (Major-General Harrison) said aloud as he was withdrawn from the Court, that he had no reason to be ashamed of the cause in which he had been engaged.&lt;ref&gt;The Memoirs of [[Edmund Ludlow]], Lieutenant-General of the Horse in the Army of the Commonwealth of England, 1625-1672, Edited with Appendices of Letters and Illustrative Documents, by C.H. Firth, M.A., in two Volumes, Oxford, At the Clarendon Press, 1894, Vol. 2, pages 303-304&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Execution==
Major-General Harrison was the first of the [[Regicide]]s to be executed by being [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] on 13 October 1660.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.axtellfamily.org/axfamous/regicide/DanielAxtellTrial1660.htm ''Selections from the Trial and Execution of Col. Daniel Axtell in October 1660''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison, after being hanged for several minutes and then cut open, was reported to have leaned across and hit his executioner—resulting in the swift removal of his head.  His entrails were thrown onto a nearby fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB Regicide&quot;&gt;{{Cite ODNB | last = Nenner | first = Howard | title = Regicides (act. 1649) |format={{ODNBsub}} | edition = online | date = September 2004 | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/70599| doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/70599}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbottpp158159&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Abbott|2005|pp=158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Harrison's sentence was 'That you be led to the place from whence you came, and from thence be drawn upon a hurdle to the place of execution, and then you shall be hanged by the neck and, being alive, shall be cut down, and your privy members to be cut off, and your entrails be taken out of your body and, you living, the same to be burnt before your eyes, and your head to be cut off, your body to be divided into four-quarters, and head and quarters to be disposed of at the pleasure of the King's majesty.

[[Samuel Pepys]] wrote an eyewitness account of the execution at [[Charing Cross]], in which Major General Harrison was drily reported to be &quot;looking as cheerful as any man could do in that condition&quot;. This account is also quoted on a plaque on the wall of the Hung, Drawn and Quartered public house near Pepys Street, where the diarist lived and worked in the Navy Office. In his final moments, as he was being led up the scaffold, the hangman asked for his forgiveness. Upon hearing his request Thomas Harrison replied, &quot;I do forgive thee with all my heart... Alas poor man, thou doith it ignorantly, the Lord grant that this sin may be not laid to thy charge.&quot; Thomas Harrison then gave all of the money that remained in his pockets to his executioner and was thereafter executed.

[[Edmond Ludlow]] also provided an account of the execution at Charing Cross, &quot;the sentence which had been pronounced in consequence of the verdict was executed upon Major-General Harrison at the place where Charing Cross formerly stood, that the King might have the pleasure of the spectacle, and inure himself to blood.&quot; According to Ludlow, &quot;On the fifteenth (15 October 1660), Mr. John Carew suffered there also, even their enemies confessing that more steadiness of mind, more contempt of death, and more magnanimity could not be expressed.  To all who were present with them either in prison or at the place where the sentence was executed, they owned that having engaged in the cause of God and their country, they were not at all ashamed to suffer in the manner their enemies thought fit, openly avowing the inward satisfaction of their minds when they reflected upon the actions for which they had been condemned, not doubting the revival of the same cause; and that a time should come when men would have better thoughts of their persons and proceedings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Memoirs of Ludlow, Vol. 2, pages 309, with some light editing in spelling and punctuation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Memoirs of Edmund Ludlow, Lieutenant-General of the Horse in the Army of the Commonwealth of England, 1625-1672, Edited with Appendices of Letters and Illustrative Documents, by C.H.

A '''frontier''' is the [[political]] and [[geographical]] area near or beyond a [[Border|boundary]].  A frontier can also be referred to as a &quot;front&quot;. The term came from French in the 15th century, with the meaning &quot;borderland&quot;—the region of a country that fronts on another country (see also [[marches]]).  Unlike a [[border]]—a rigid and clear-cut form of state boundary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mura |first=Andrea |year=2016 |title=National Finitude and the Paranoid Style of the One |journal=Contemporary Political Theory |volume=15 |pages=58–79 |doi= 10.1057/cpt.2015.23|url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/cpt/journal/v15/n1/full/cpt201523a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;—in the most general sense a frontier can be fuzzy or diffuse. For example, the frontier between the Eastern United States and the Old West in the 1800s was an area where European American settlements gradually thinned out and gave way to Native American settlements or uninhabited land.  The frontier was not always a single continuous area, as California and various large cities were populated before the land that connected those to the East.

Frontiers and borders also imply different geopolitical strategies. In [[Ancient Rome]], the [[Roman Republic]] experienced a period of active expansion and creating new frontiers. From the reign of [[Augustus]] onward, the Roman borders turned into defensive boundaries that divided the Roman and non-Roman realms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Luttwak|first=Edward|title=The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire: From the First Century CE to the Third|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1976|location=Baltimore}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the eleventh-century China, China's [[Song dynasty|Song Dynasty]] defended its northern border with the [[Nomadic empire|nomadic]] [[Liao dynasty|Liao empire]] by building an extensive manmade forest. Later in the early twelfth century, Song Dynasty invaded the Liao and dismantled the northern forest, converting the former defensive border into an expanding frontier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Yuan Julian|date=July 2018|title=FRONTIER, FORTIFICATION, AND FORESTATION: DEFENSIVE WOODLAND ON THE SONG–LIAO BORDER IN THE LONG ELEVENTH CENTURY|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S2059163218000075/type/journal_article|journal=Journal of Chinese History|language=en|volume=2|issue=2|pages=313–334|doi=10.1017/jch.2018.7|issn=2059-1632|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern history, [[colonialism]] and [[imperialism]] has applied and produced elaborate use and concepts of frontier, especially in the [[settler colonialism|settler colonial]] states of North America, expressed by the &quot;[[Manifest Destiny]]&quot; and &quot;[[Frontier Thesis]]&quot;.

The term &quot;frontier&quot; was frequently{{quantify|date=August 2016}} used{{by whom|date=August 2016}} in [[colonial Australia]] in the meaning of country that borders the unknown or uncivilised, the boundary, border country, the borders of civilisation, or as the land that forms the furthest extent of what was frequently termed &quot;the inside&quot; or &quot;settled&quot; districts.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. ''Parliamentary Debate'' April 14 ''Legislative Assembly of NSW'' (''Australian'' April 14, 1848, p.4 Robinson)&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;outside&quot; was another term frequently used in colonial Australia, this term seemingly{{original research inline|date=August 2016}} covered not only the frontier but the districts beyond. Settlers at the frontier thus frequently referred to themselves as &quot;the outsiders&quot; or &quot;outside residents&quot; and to the area in which they lived as &quot;the outside districts&quot;. At times one might hear the &quot;frontier&quot; described as &quot;the outside borders&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. ''Sydney Morning Herald'' June 6, 1851 p.2g; ''South Australian Register'',  ''Moreton Bay Courier'' Feb 16, 1861, p2 and 2 April 1861, p.3 re 'The Native Police'; see Queensland Parliamentary Debate (Attorney-General Pring) (''Brisbane Courier'', July 27, 1861, p5); Queensland Parliamentary Debate 20 August 1863; ''Brisbane Courier'', Aug 22, 1863 (Editorial).&lt;/ref&gt; However the term &quot;frontier districts&quot; was seemingly{{original research inline|date=August 2016}} used predominantly in the early Australian colonial newspapers whenever dealing with skirmishes between black and white in northern [[New South Wales]] and [[Queensland]], and in newspaper reports from [[South Africa]], whereas it was seemingly not so commonly used when dealing with affairs in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]] and southern New South Wales. The use of the word &quot;frontier&quot; was thus frequently connected to descriptions of frontier violence, as in a letter printed in the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' in December 1850 which described murder and carnage at the northern frontier and calling for the protection of the settlers saying: &quot;...nothing but a strong body of [[Native Police]] will restore and keep order in the frontier districts, and as the squatters are taxed for the purpose of such protection&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Sydney Morning Herald'' Dec 24, 1850, p.3s.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Occupation of Araucanía]] the Republic of Chile advanced the frontier south from [[Bío Bío River]] to [[Malleco River]] where a well defended line of forts was established between 1861 and 1871.

Having decisively defeated Peru in the [[Battle of San Juan and Chorrillos|battles of Chorrillos]] and [[Battle of Miraflores|Miraflores]] in January 1881 Chilean authorities turned their attention to Araucanía seeking to defend the previous advances that had been so difficult to establish.&lt;ref name=Bengoa275-276&gt;Bengoa 2000, pp. 275-276.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferrando547&gt;Ferrando 1986, p. 547&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bengoa277-278&gt;Bengoa 2000, pp. 277-278.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was not only to defend forts and settlements but also to advance the frontier all the way from [[Malleco River]] to [[Cautín River]].&lt;ref name=Bengoa275-276/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bengoa277-278&quot;/&gt;

The word &quot;frontier&quot; has often meant a region at the edge of a [[Human settlement|settled]] area, especially in North American development. It was a transition zone where explorers, pioneers and settlers were arriving. [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] said that &quot;the significance of the frontier&quot; was that as pioneers moved into the &quot;frontier zone,&quot; they were changed by the encounter.  For example, Turner argues in 1893 that in the United States, unlimited free land in this zone was available, and thus offered the psychological sense of unlimited opportunity.  This, in turn, had many consequences such as optimism, [[future orientation]], shedding the restraints of land scarcity, and the wastage of natural resources.

In the earliest days of European settlement of the Atlantic coast, the frontier was any part of the forested interior of the continent lying beyond the fringe of existing settlements along the coast and the great rivers, such as the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence]],  [[Connecticut River|Connecticut]], [[Hudson River|Hudson]], [[Delaware River|Delaware]], [[Susquehanna River]] and [[James River (Virginia)|James]].

English, French, Spanish and Dutch patterns of expansion and settlement were quite different.  Only a few thousand French migrated to Canada.  These habitants settled in villages along the St. Lawrence river, building communities that remained stable for long stretches, rather than leapfrogging west the way the English and later Americans did.  Although French fur traders ranged widely through the [[Great Lakes (North America)|Great Lakes]] and [[Mississippi River]] watersheds, as far as the [[Rocky Mountains]], they did not usually settle down.  French settlement in these areas was limited to a few very small villages on the lower Mississippi and in the [[Illinois Country]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarence Walworth Alvord, ''The Illinois Country 1673-1818'' (1918)&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch set up fur trading posts in the Hudson River valley, followed by large grants of land to patroons, who brought in tenant farmers that created compact, permanent villages.  They did not push westward.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur G. Adams, ''The Hudson Through the Years'' (1996);  Sung Bok Kim, ''Landlord and Tenant in Colonial New York: Manorial Society, 1664-1775'' (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the English colonies generally pursued a more systematic policy of widespread settlement of the New World, for cultivation and exploitation of the land, which required the extension of European [[property rights]] to the new continent.  The typical English settlements were quite compact and small—under {{convert|1|sqmi|km2|0|abbr=off|order=flip}}.  Conflict with the Native Americans arose out of political issues, i.e. who would rule.  Early frontier areas east of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] included the [[Connecticut River]] valley.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Kulikoff, ''From British Peasants to Colonial American Farmers'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[French and Indian Wars]] of the 1760s resulted in a complete victory for the British, who took over the [[French colonization of the Americas|French colonial territory]] west of the Appalachians to the [[Mississippi River]].  Americans began moving across the Appalachians into areas such the Ohio Country and the [[New River Valley]].

Most of the frontier movement was east to west, but there were other directions as well.  The frontier in New England lay to the north; in Nevada to the east; in Florida to the south.  Throughout American history, the expansion of settlement was largely from the east to the west, and thus the frontier is often identified with &quot;the west.&quot;  On the Pacific Coast, settlement moved eastward.

===Canadian frontier===
{{History of Canada}}
A Canadian frontier thesis was developed by [[Canadians|Canadian]] historians [[Harold Adams Innis]] and [[J. M. S. Careless]]. They emphasized the relationship between the center and periphery. Katerberg argues that &quot;in Canada the imagined West must be understood in relation to the mythic power of the North.&quot; [Katerberg 2003] This is reflected in [[Canadian literature]] with the phrase &quot;[[garrison mentality]].&quot; In Innis's 1930 work ''The Fur Trade in Canada'', he expounded on what became known as the Laurentian thesis: that the most creative and major developments in Canadian history occurred in the metropolitan centers of central Canada and that the civilization of North America is the civilization of Europe. Innis considered place as critical in the development of the Canadian West and wrote of the importance of metropolitan areas, settlements, and indigenous people in the creation of markets. Turner and Innis continue to exert influence over the historiography of the American and Canadian Wests. The [[Quebec|Quebec frontier]] showed little of the individualism or democracy that Turner ascribed to the American zone to the south.  The [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Ontario]] frontiers were rather more democratic than the rest of Canada, but whether that was caused by the need to be self-reliant at the frontier itself, or the presence of large numbers of American immigrants is debated.

The Canadian political thinker [[Charles Blattberg]] has argued that such events ought to be seen as part of a process in which Canadians advanced a &quot;border&quot; as distinct from a &quot;frontier&quot; — from east to west. According to Blattberg, a border assumes a significantly sharper contrast between the civilized and the uncivilized since, unlike a frontier process, the civilizing force is not supposed to be shaped by that which it is civilizing. Blattberg criticizes both the frontier and border &quot;civilizing&quot; processes.

====Canadian prairies====
The pattern of settlement of the Canadian prairies began in 1896, when the American prairie states had already achieved statehood. Like their American counterparts, the Prairie provinces supported populist and democratic movements in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Laycock, David.  ''Populism and Democratic Thought in the Canadian Prairies, 1910 to 1945.'' 1990; Seymour Martin Lipset, ''Agrarian Socialism'' (1950).

Following the victory of the United States in the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the signing [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, the United States gained formal, if not actual, control of the British lands west of the Appalachians. Many thousands of settlers, typified by [[Daniel Boone]], had already reached [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]], and adjacent areas.  Some areas, such as the [[Virginia Military District]] and the [[Connecticut Western Reserve]] (both in [[Ohio]]), were used by the states as rewards to veterans of the war. How to formally include these new frontier areas into the nation was an important issue in the Continental Congress of the 1780s and was partly resolved by the [[Northwest Ordinance]] (1787).  The [[Southwest Territory]] saw a similar pattern of settlement pressure.

For the next century, the expansion of the nation into these areas, as well as the subsequently acquired [[Louisiana Purchase]], [[Oregon Country]], and [[Mexican Cession]], attracted hundreds of thousands of settlers. Whether the Kansas frontier would become &quot;slave&quot; or &quot;free&quot; kindled the [[American Civil War]]. In general before 1860, Northern Democrats promoted easy land ownership and Whigs and Southern Democrats resisted. The Southerners resisted [[Homestead Act]]s because it supported the growth of a free farmer population that might oppose slavery.

When the Republican Party came to power in 1860 it promoted a free land policy — notably the [[Homestead Act]] of 1862, coupled with railroad land grants that opened cheap (but not free) lands for settlers. In 1890, the frontier line had broken up (Census maps defined the frontier line as a line beyond which the population density was under {{convert|2|PD/sqmi|1|disp=or}}).

The effect of the frontier upon popular culture was enormous, in [[dime novel]]s, Wild West shows, and, after 1910, [[western film|Western movies]] set on the frontier.

The American frontier was generally the westernmost edge of a settlement and typically more free-spirited than in the East because of its lack of social and political institutions. The idea that the frontier provided the core defining quality of the United States was elaborated by the historian [[Frederick Jackson Turner]], who built his [[Frontier Thesis]] in 1893 around this notion.  Subsequently, the frontier has also been described as the point of contact between two cultures, where contact led to exchanges that affected both cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anzaldua|first1=Gloria|title=Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza|date=1987|publisher=Aunt Lute Books|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In popular culture, [[Alaska: The Last Frontier]] is an American reality cable television series about Alaskan pioneers, Yule and Ruth Kilcher, at their homestead 11 miles outside of Homer.

The expansion of [[Russia]] to the north, south ([[Wild Fields]]) and east ([[Siberia]], the [[Russian Far East]] and [[Russian Alaska]]) exploited ever-changing frontier regions over several centuries and often involved the development and settlement of [[Cossack]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;

Decade after decade, however, peasants fleeing to the frontier made up the largest category of migrants. [...] The more venturesome Russian migrants avoided the frontier towns and peasant villages in favor of life as cossacks (from the Turkic ''kazak'', meaning 'free man').

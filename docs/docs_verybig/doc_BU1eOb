*Finch and other band members made cameo appearances in [[Talking Heads]] leader [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]]'s 1986 movie ''[[True Stories (film)|True Stories]]'', set in  fictional Virgil, Texas.  Finch can be spotted in the fashion show sporting a brick-patterned suit and in the parade leading the all-accordion marching band. (In real life, Brave Combo was David Byrne's wedding band.)

*They appear as a wedding band in the 1995 feature film ''Late Bloomers''.

*Included in [[Bob Dylan]]'s 2009 Christmas release, ''[[Christmas In The Heart]]'', the song &quot;Must Be Santa&quot;, is performed polka-style. Dylan's arrangement is almost identical to the Brave Combo arrangement from their 1991 CD ''It's Christmas, Man!''. In an interview published by [[Street News Service]], Dylan acknowledged the influence of Brave Combo: &quot;This version comes from a band called Brave Combo. Somebody sent their record to us for our radio show. They’re a regional band out of Texas that takes regular songs and changes the way you think about them. You oughta hear their version of 'Hey Jude'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sns091123&quot;/&gt;
*They were featured on [[Bowling for Soup]]'s album ''[[Sorry for Partyin']]'', playing a polka version of Bowling For Soup's song &quot;Belgium&quot;.

The episode debuted August 1, 2012, on [[Comedy Central]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dmn120716&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;drb120730&quot;/&gt;

{{more citations needed|date=February 2013}}
In [[digital marketing]] and [[online advertising]], '''spamdexing''' (also known as '''search engine spam''', '''search engine poisoning''', '''[[Black hat hacker|black-hat]] [[search engine optimization]]''' ('''SEO'''), '''search spam''' or '''web spam''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchengineland.com/what-is-search-engine-spam-the-video-edition-15202.php  ''SearchEngineLand'', Danny Sullivan's video explanation of Search Engine Spam, October 2008] . Retrieved 2008-11-13.&lt;/ref&gt; is the deliberate manipulation of [[Web search engine|search engine]] [[Index (search engine)|indexes]]. It involves a number of methods, such as [[link building]] and repeating unrelated phrases, to manipulate the relevance or prominence of resources indexed, in a manner inconsistent with the purpose of the indexing system.&lt;ref name=&quot;wspy&quot;&gt;&quot;Word Spy - spamdexing&quot; (definition), March 2003, webpage:[http://www.wordspy.com/words/spamdexing.asp WordSpy-spamdexing].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gyongyi&gt;{{Citation | first=Zoltán | last=Gyöngyi | author-link1=Zoltán Gyöngyi | first2=Hector | last2=Garcia-Molina | contribution=Web spam taxonomy | contribution-url=http://airweb.cse.lehigh.edu/2005/gyongyi.pdf | title=Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Adversarial Information Retrieval on the Web (AIRWeb), 2005 in The 14th International World Wide Web Conference (WWW 2005) May 10, (Tue)-14 (Sat), 2005, Nippon Convention Center (Makuhari Messe), Chiba, Japan. | year=2005 | publisher=ACM Press | place=New York, NY | isbn=1-59593-046-9 | author-link2=Hector Garcia-Molina }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spamdexing could be considered to be a part of [[search engine optimization]], although there are many search engine optimization methods that improve the quality and appearance of the content of web sites and serve content useful to many users.&lt;ref name=Ntoulas&gt;{{Citation | first=Alexandros | last=Ntoulas |author-link=Alexandros Ntoulas | first2=Mark | last2=Manasse | author2-link=Mark Manasse | first3=Marc | last3=Najork | author3-link=Marc Najork | first4=Dennis | last4=Fetterly | author4-link=Dennis Fetterly | contribution=Detecting Spam Web Pages through Content Analysis | title=The 15th International World Wide Web Conference (WWW 2006) May 23–26, 2006, Edinburgh, Scotland. | year=2006 | publisher=ACM Press | place=New York, NY | isbn=1-59593-323-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Search engines use a variety of [[algorithm]]s to determine relevancy ranking. Some of these include determining whether the search term appears in the [[body text]] or [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] of a [[web page]]. Many search engines check for instances of spamdexing and will remove suspect pages from their indexes. Also, search-engine operators can quickly block the results listing from entire websites that use spamdexing, perhaps in response to user complaints of false matches. The rise of spamdexing in the mid-1990s made the leading search engines of the time less useful. Using unethical methods to make websites rank higher in search engine results than they otherwise would is commonly referred to in the SEO (search engine optimization) industry as &quot;black-hat SEO&quot;. These methods are more focused on breaking the search-engine-promotion rules and guidelines. In addition to this, the perpetrators run the risk of their websites being severely penalized by the [[Google Panda]] and [[Google Penguin]] search-results ranking algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ann |last=Smarty |title=What Is BlackHat SEO? 5 Definitions |url=http://www.searchenginejournal.com/what-is-blackhat-seo-5-definitions/8151/ |work=Search Engine Journal |date=2008-12-17 |access-date=2012-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common spamdexing techniques can be classified into two broad classes: ''content spam''&lt;ref name=&quot;Ntoulas&quot;/&gt; (or ''term spam'') and ''link spam''.&lt;ref name=Gyongyi/&gt;

==History==
The earliest known reference&lt;ref name=&quot;wspy&quot;/&gt; to the term ''spamdexing'' is by Eric Convey in his article &quot;Porn sneaks way back on Web,&quot; [[The Boston Herald]], May 22, 1996, where he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The problem arises when site operators load their Web pages with hundreds of extraneous terms so search engines will list them among legitimate addresses.
The process is called &quot;spamdexing,&quot; a combination of [[spamming]] — the Internet term for sending users unsolicited information — and &quot;[[Web indexing|indexing]].&quot;&lt;ref name=wspy/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Content spam==
These techniques involve altering the logical view that a search engine has over the page's contents. They all aim at variants of the [[vector space model]] for information retrieval on text collections.

===Keyword stuffing===
Keyword stuffing involves the calculated placement of keywords within a page to raise the keyword count, variety, and density of the page. This is useful to make a page appear to be relevant for a [[web crawler]] in a way that makes it more likely to be found. Example: A promoter of a [[Ponzi scheme]] wants to attract web surfers to a site where he advertises his scam. He places hidden text appropriate for a fan page of a popular music group on his page, hoping that the page will be listed as a fan site and receive many visits from music lovers. Older versions of indexing programs simply counted how often a keyword appeared, and used that to determine relevance levels. Most modern search engines have the ability to analyze a page for keyword stuffing and determine whether the frequency is consistent with other sites created specifically to attract search engine traffic. Also, large webpages are truncated, so that massive dictionary lists cannot be indexed on a single webpage.{{cn|date=December 2019}} (However, spammers can circumvent this webpage-size limitation merely by setting up multiple webpages, either independently or linked to each other.)
  
=== Hidden or invisible text ===
Unrelated [[hidden text]] is disguised by making it the same color as the background, using a tiny font size, or hiding it within [[HTML]] code such as &quot;no frame&quot; sections, [[alt attribute]]s, zero-sized [[Span and div|DIVs]], and &quot;no script&quot; sections. People manually screening red-flagged websites for a search-engine company might temporarily or permanently block an entire website for having invisible text on some of its pages. However, hidden text is not always spamdexing: it can also be used to enhance [[web accessibility|accessibility]].

===Meta-tag stuffing===
This involves repeating keywords in the [[meta tag]]s, and using meta keywords that are unrelated to the site's content. This tactic has been ineffective since 2005.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Doorway pages===
&quot;Gateway&quot; or [[doorway page]]s are low-quality web pages created with very little content, but are instead stuffed with very similar keywords and phrases. They are designed to rank highly within the search results, but serve no purpose to visitors looking for information. A doorway page will generally have &quot;click here to enter&quot; on the page; autoforwarding can also be used for this purpose. In 2006, Google ousted vehicle manufacturer [[BMW]] for using &quot;doorway pages&quot; to the company's German site, BMW.de.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Segal |title=The Dirty Little Secrets of Search |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/business/13search.html?pagewanted=all |work=[[The NY Times]] |date=2011-02-13 |access-date=2012-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scraper sites===
[[Scraper sites]] are created using various programs designed to &quot;scrape&quot; search-engine results pages or other sources of content and create &quot;content&quot; for a website.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The specific presentation of content on these sites is unique, but is merely an amalgamation of content taken from other sources, often without permission. Such websites are generally full of advertising (such as [[pay per click|pay-per-click]] ads), or they redirect the user to other sites. It is even feasible for scraper sites to outrank original websites for their own information and organization names.

===Article spinning===
[[Article spinning]] involves rewriting existing articles, as opposed to merely scraping content from other sites, to avoid penalties imposed by search engines for [[duplicate content]]. This process is undertaken by hired writers or automated using a [[thesaurus]] database or a [[neural network]].

===Machine translation===
Similarly to [[article spinning]], some sites use [[machine translation]] to render their content in several languages, with no human editing, resulting in unintelligible texts that nonetheless continue to be indexed by search engines, thereby attracting traffic.

===Pages with no information related to page title===
{{Confusing|section|date=July 2014}}
Publishing web pages that contain information that is unrelated to the title is a misleading practice known as deception. Despite being a target for penalties from the leading search engines that rank pages, deception is a common practice in some types of sites, including dictionary and encyclopedia sites.

==Link spam==
{{main|Link spam}}
Link spam' is defined as links between pages that are present for reasons
other than merit.&lt;ref name=Davison&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Link spam takes advantage of link-based ranking algorithms, which gives [[websites]] higher rankings the more other highly ranked websites link to it. These techniques also aim at influencing other link-based ranking techniques such as the [[HITS algorithm]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}

===Link farms===
{{main|Link farm}}
Link farms are tightly-knit networks of websites that link to each other for the sole purpose of gaming the search engine ranking algorithms. These are also known facetiously as ''mutual admiration societies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.sims.berkeley.edu/courses/is141/f05/lectures/se-course-intro.pdf|title=Search Engines:Technology, Society, and Business - Marti Hearst, Aug 29, 2005|website=berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of links farms has been greatly reduced after Google launched the first Panda Update in February 2011, which introduced significant improvements in its spam-detection algorithm.

=== Private blog networks ===
Blog networks (PBNs) are a group of authoritative websites used as a source of contextual links that point to the owner's main website to achieve higher search engine ranking. Owners of PBN websites use expired domains or [[Domain name auction|auction domains]] that have [[backlink]]s from high-authority websites. Google targeted and penalized PBN users on several occasions with several massive deindexing campaigns since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/google-targets-sites-using-private-blog-networks-manual-action-ranking-penalties-204000|title=Google Targets Sites Using Private Blog Networks With Manual Action Ranking Penalties|date=2014-09-23|newspaper=Search Engine Land|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[False advertising|Hidden]] links===
Putting [[hyperlink]]s where visitors will not see them to increase [[link popularity]]. Highlighted link text can help rank a webpage higher for matching that phrase.

===Sybil attack===
A [[Sybil attack]] is the forging of multiple identities for malicious intent, named after the famous multiple personality disorder patient &quot;[[Sybil (Schreiber book)|Sybil]]&quot;. A spammer may create multiple web sites at different [[domain name]]s that all link to each other, such as fake blogs (known as [[spam blogs]]).

===Spam blogs===
{{main|Spam blog}}
Spam blogs are blogs created solely for commercial promotion and the passage of link authority to target sites. Often these &quot;splogs&quot; are designed in a misleading manner that will give the effect of a legitimate website but upon close inspection will often be written using spinning software or be very poorly written and barely readable content. They are similar in nature to link farms.

===Guest blog spam===

Guest blog spam is the process of placing guest blogs on websites for the sole purpose of gaining a link to another website or websites. Unfortunately, these are often confused with legitimate forms of guest blogging with other motives than placing links. This technique was made famous by [[Matt Cutts]], who publicly declared &quot;war&quot; against this form of link spam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/guest-blogging/|title=The decay and fall of guest blogging for SEO|date=20 January 2014|website=mattcutts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buying expired domains===
{{See also|Domaining}}
Some link spammers utilize expired domain crawler software or monitor DNS records for domains that will expire soon, then buy them when they expire and replace the pages with links to their pages. However, it is possible but not confirmed that Google resets the link data on expired domains. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}} To maintain all previous Google ranking data for the domain, it is advisable that a buyer grab the domain before it is &quot;dropped&quot;. 
   
Some of these techniques may be applied for creating a [[Google bomb]] — that is, to cooperate with other users to boost the ranking of a particular page for a particular query.

===Cookie stuffing===
[[Cookie stuffing]] involves placing an [[affiliate marketing|affiliate]] tracking cookie on a website visitor's computer without their knowledge, which will then generate revenue for the person doing the cookie stuffing. This not only generates fraudulent affiliate sales, but also has the potential to overwrite other affiliates' cookies, essentially stealing their legitimately earned commissions.

=== Using world-writable pages ===
{{main|Forum spam}}
Web sites that can be edited by users can be used by spamdexers to insert links to spam sites if the appropriate anti-spam measures are not taken.

Automated [[spambot]]s can rapidly make the user-editable portion of a site unusable.
Programmers have developed a variety of automated [[Forum spam#Spam prevention|spam prevention techniques]] to block or at least slow down spambots.

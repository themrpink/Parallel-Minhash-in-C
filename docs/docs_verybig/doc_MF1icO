In [[Asian cuisine|Southeast Asian cuisines]], such as those of [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesia]], [[Vietnamese cuisine|Vietnam]], [[Thai cuisine|Thailand]], [[Cambodian cuisine|Cambodia]], [[Malaysian cuisine|Malaysia]], [[Philippine cuisine|Philippines]], [[Singapore cuisine|Singapore]] and [[Bruneian cuisine|Brunei]], both shallots and garlic are often used as elementary spices. Raw shallots can also accompany cucumbers when pickled in mild vinegar solution. They are also often chopped finely, then fried until golden brown, resulting in tiny crispy shallot chips called ''[[bawang goreng]]'' (fried shallots) in Indonesian, which can be bought ready-made from groceries and supermarkets. Shallots enhance the flavor of many Southeast Asian dishes, such as [[fried rice]] variants. Crispy shallot chips are also used in southern Chinese cuisine. In Indonesia, shallots are sometimes made into pickles that are added to several traditional foods; the pickles' sourness is thought to increase the appetite.

The tubular green leaves of the plant can also be eaten and are very similar to the leaves of spring onions and chives.

[[Image:Phantom Edit.jpg|thumb|The VHS cover]]
'''''Star Wars Episode I.I: The Phantom Edit''''' is a [[fan edit]] of the film ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]'', removing many elements of the original film. The purpose of the edit, according to creator [[Mike J. Nichols]], was to make a much stronger version of ''The Phantom Menace'' based on the previous execution and philosophies of film storytelling and editing of [[George Lucas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/2001/11/05/phantom_edit/index.html|title=The Phantom Edit |website=Salon.com |author=Daniel Kraus |date=November 5, 2001 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715062244/http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/2001/11/05/phantom_edit/index.html |archive-date=July 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Phantom Edit'' was the first unauthorized re-edit of ''The Phantom Menace'' to receive major publicity and acclaim and is also considered the first fan-edit of a feature film ever to be shared by an online audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=Mann, Charles C. |title=Hollywood Goes Digital, Like It or Not |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/hollywood/digital/mann.html |website=PBS.org |date=November 22, 2001 |accessdate=November 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NPR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1125961|title='Star Wars' - The Phantom Edit|date=July 16, 2001|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''The Phantom Edit'' was originally circulated in [[Hollywood]] studios in 2000 and 2001, and was followed by media attention. [[Salon.com]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon&quot;/&gt; [[National Public Radio|NPR]],&lt;ref name=&quot;NPR&quot;/&gt; [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]],&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot;/&gt; and the [[BBC]]&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1375742.stm | work=BBC News | title=Mystery of Star Wars phantom edit | date=June 7, 2001 |accessdate=November 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; all covered the edit to various degrees.

Rumor initially attributed ''The Phantom Edit'' to [[Kevin Smith]], who admitted to having seen the re-edit but denied that he was the editor. The editor was revealed to be [[Mike J. Nichols]] of [[Santa Clarita, California]] in the September 7, 2001, edition of the ''[[Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Daniel | last = Greenberg | title = Thumbs Down? Re-Edit the Flick Yourself | date = September 7, 2001 | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/79888484.html?dids=79888484:79888484&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT | work = The [[Washington Post]] | pages = E.01 | accessdate = March 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Available on [[VHS]], [[DVD]] and later via [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]], the DVD contains two deleted scenes and a [[audio commentary (DVD)|commentary track]] by the editor as well as a few [[easter egg (virtual)|Easter eggs]]. The DVD version has also been relabeled as Episode I.II, has a slightly different podrace from the VHS version, and contains more extensive editing to individual images and sounds that have not been entirely cut.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

[[Lucasfilm]], the production company of series creator George Lucas, condoned the edit and did not pursue legal action against its distributors.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;/&gt;

==Changes==
Changes made from the original film in ''The Phantom Edit''
* Opening crawl replaced with a new one explaining why the edit was made
* Re-editing of nearly all scenes featuring [[Jar Jar Binks]] and removing some of what Nichols dubs 'Jar Jar Antics'
* Removal or re-editing of most of the [[Battle Droid]] dialogue
* Limiting of [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] throughout the film
* Trimming scenes involving politics
* Re-arrangement of shots and scenes to match the [[Original trilogy (Star Wars)|original ''Star Wars'' trilogy]]'s presentation style
* Removal of &quot;Yippee&quot; and &quot;Oops&quot; from [[Anakin Skywalker|Anakin's]] dialogue
* Removal of dialogue that specifies the nature of midi-chlorians as a biological basis for [[the Force|Force]] sensitivity
* Reinstatement of deleted scenes in order to fill in plot holes in the film narrative
There were a total of 18 minutes cut from the original film, reducing the run time from 136 minutes to 119 minutes.

==Reviews==
Critics and filmmakers have commented on the original ''Phantom Edit'', in most cases providing the approval and recognition which furthered the fan edit movement.

* &quot;Smart editing to say the least&quot; — [[Kevin Smith]], Film Director&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rodgers|first1=Andrew|title=Kevin Smith speaks out about 'Phantom Edit'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&amp;dat=20010703&amp;id=jIZIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cnADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2283,2261483&amp;hl=en|accessdate=30 January 2018|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=July 3, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &quot;...Materialized from out of nowhere was a good film that had been hidden inside the disappointing original one.&quot; — Daniel Kraus, [[Salon.com]] (November 5, 2001)&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon&quot;/&gt;
* &quot;[Done by]; someone with a gift (and equipment) for editing&quot; — Michael Wilmington, ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' Film Critic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2001-06-18-0106180230-story.html|title=`Star Wars' phantom edit: good, not better than the original|last=Wilmington|first=Michael|website=chicagotribune.com|language=en-US|access-date=February 24, 2019|date=June 18, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 [[documentary film]] ''[[The People vs. George Lucas]]'' cites ''The Phantom Edit'' as a key example of the [[remix culture]] created by the Star Wars franchise.

==Sequel: ''Attack of the Phantom''==
Nichols followed up his edits of ''Episode I'' with an edit of ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones]]''.

Called ''Star Wars Episode II.I: Attack of the Phantom'', the DVD contains a re-edited version (38 minutes cut, new runtime of 104 minutes) of ''Episode II'' in surround sound, with a commentary track.  At points during the commentary, the viewer has the option to pause the film to view in more detail some of the things that the editor is discussing.

[[File:Rudolf Hell führt seinen Wetterkartenschreiber vor (Kiel 44.592).jpg|thumb|Rudolf Hell (center)]]
'''Rudolf Hell''' (19 December 1901 &amp;ndash; 11 March 2002)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Robat|first = C|title = Rudolf Hell|publisher = The History of Computing Project|date = November 11, 2007|url = http://www.thocp.net/biographies/hell_rudolf.htm|accessdate = 2008-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a German [[inventor]]. He was born in [[Eggmühl]], [[Germany]].

From 1919 to 1923 he studied [[electrical engineering]] in [[Munich]]. 
He worked there from 1923 to 1929 as assistant of Prof. Max Dieckmann, with whom he operated a television station at the ''Verkehrsausstellung'' (lit.: Traffic exhibition) in Munich in 1925. In the same year Hell invented an apparatus called the ''[[Hellschreiber]]'', an early forerunner to [[impact dot matrix printer]]s and [[fax]]es. Hell received a patent for the Hellschreiber in 1929.

In the year 1929 he founded his own company in [[Potsdam-Babelsberg|Babelsberg]], [[Berlin]]. After [[World War II]] he re-founded his company in [[Kiel]]. He kept on working as an engineer and invented machines for electronically controlled engraving of printing plates and an electronic photo typesetting system called ''digiset'' marketed in the US as ''VideoComp'' by [[RCA]] and later by [[Information International, Inc.|III]].

He has received numerous awards such as the Knight Commander's Cross of the [[Federal Cross of Merit|Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]], the [[Johann Gutenberg|Gutenberg]] Prize awarded by the City of [[Mainz]],{{citation needed|reason=Probably, the Gutenberg award of Mainz university (see talk page there) is meant?|date=May 2016}} the [[Werner von Siemens Ring]] and the [[Eduard Rhein Ring of Honor]] from the German [[Eduard Rhein Foundation]] (1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eduard-rhein-stiftung.de/html/Ehrenring_e.html |title=The Eduard Rhein Ring of Honor Recipients |publisher=[[Eduard Rhein Foundation]] |accessdate=February 5, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718234106/http://www.eduard-rhein-stiftung.de/html/Ehrenring_e.html |archivedate=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His company was taken over by [[Siemens AG]] in 1981 and merged with [[Mergenthaler Linotype Company|Linotype]] in 1990, becoming ''Linotype-Hell AG''.

Rudolf Hell died in [[Kiel]], Germany.

Hellschreiber is still in use today by [[Amateur Radio]] (Ham) operators around the world.  The Feld Hell Club&lt;ref&gt;http://www.feldhellclub.org&lt;/ref&gt; holds monthly contests and gives out awards for hams who make contacts using this unique mode of communication.

'''Selfish genetic elements''' (historically also referred to as '''selfish genes''', '''ultra-selfish genes''', '''selfish DNA''', '''parasitic DNA''' and '''genomic outlaws''') are genetic segments that can enhance their own transmission at the expense of other genes in the genome, even if this has no positive or a net negative effect on organismal fitness.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Werren JH, Nur U, Wu CI | title = Selfish genetic elements | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 3 | issue = 11 | pages = 297–302 | date = November 1988 | pmid = 21227262 | doi = 10.1016/0169-5347(88)90105-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hurst GD, Hurst LD, Johnstone RA | title = Intranuclear conflict and its role in evolution | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 7 | issue = 11 | pages = 373–8 | date = November 1992 | pmid = 21236071 | doi = 10.1016/0169-5347(92)90007-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hurst LD, Atlan A, Bengtsson BO | title = Genetic conflicts | journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 71 | issue = 3 | pages = 317–64 | date = September 1996 | pmid = 8828237 | doi = 10.1086/419442 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hurst GD, Werren JH | title = The role of selfish genetic elements in eukaryotic evolution | journal = Nature Reviews.

However, when genes have some control over their own transmission, the rules can change, and so just like all social groups, genomes are [[Tragedy of the commons|vulnerable to selfish behaviour by their parts]].

Early observations of selfish genetic elements were made almost a century ago, but the topic did not get widespread attention until several decades later. Inspired by the  [[Gene centered view of evolution|gene-centred views of evolution]] popularized by [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George Williams]]&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first = George Christopher | last = Williams | name-list-style = vanc | title=Adaptation and Natural Selection A Critique of Some Current Evolutionary Thought|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2010-8 | date = 2008-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard Dawkins]],&lt;ref name=&quot;TSG&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Selfish Gene |last=Dawkins|first=Richard | name-list-style = vanc |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1976|isbn=978-0-19-109306-7 |oclc=953456293}}&lt;/ref&gt; two papers were published back-to-back in ''Nature'' in 1980 – by [[Leslie Orgel]] and [[Francis Crick]]&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Orgel LE, Crick FH | title = Selfish DNA: the ultimate parasite | journal = Nature | volume = 284 | issue = 5757 | pages = 604–7 | date = April 1980 | pmid = 7366731 | doi = 10.1038/284604a0 | bibcode = 1980Natur.284..604O | s2cid = 4233826 | author2link = Francis Crick }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Ford Doolittle]] and [[Carmen Sapienza]]&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Doolittle WF, Sapienza C | title = Selfish genes, the phenotype paradigm and genome evolution | journal = Nature | volume = 284 | issue = 5757 | pages = 601–3 | date = April 1980 | pmid = 6245369 | doi = 10.1038/284601a0 | bibcode = 1980Natur.284..601D | s2cid = 4311366 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – introducing the concept of selfish genetic elements (at the time called &quot;selfish DNA&quot;) to the wider scientific community. Both papers emphasized that genes can spread in a population regardless of their effect on organismal fitness as long as they have a transmission advantage.

Selfish genetic elements have now been described in most groups of organisms, and they demonstrate a remarkable diversity in the ways by which they promote their own transmission.&lt;ref name=&quot;:30&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|doi = 10.4159/9780674029118|title=Genes in Conflict |last1=Burt|first1=Austin |last2=Trivers|first2=Robert | name-list-style = vanc |author2link=Robert Trivers |date=2006-01-31|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02911-8 |location=Cambridge, MA and London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though long dismissed as genetic curiosities, with little relevance for evolution, they are now recognized to affect a wide swath of biological processes, ranging from genome size and architecture to speciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Werren JH | title = Selfish genetic elements, genetic conflict, and evolutionary innovation | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 Suppl 2 | issue = Supplement 2 | pages = 10863–70 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21690392 | pmc = 3131821 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1102343108 | bibcode = 2011PNAS..10810863W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early observations ===
Observations of what is now referred to as selfish genetic elements go back to the early days in the [[history of genetics]]. Already in 1928, Russian geneticist [[Sergey Gershenson]] reported the discovery of a driving [[X chromosome]] in ''Drosophila obscura''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gershenson S | title = A New Sex-Ratio Abnormality in DROSOPHILA OBSCURA | journal = Genetics | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 488–507 | date = November 1928 | pmid = 17246563 | pmc = 1200995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crucially, he noted that the resulting female-biased sex ratio may drive a population extinct (see [[#Species extinction|Species extinction]]). The earliest clear statement of how chromosomes may spread in a population not because of their positive fitness effects on the individual organism, but because of their own &quot;parasitic&quot; nature came from the Swedish botanist and cytogeneticist [[Gunnar Östergren]] in 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Östergren G | title = Parasitic nature of extra fragment chromosomes. | journal = Botaniska Notiser | date = 1945 | volume = 2 | pages = 157–163 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing [[B chromosome]]s in plants he wrote:&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In many cases these chromosomes have no useful function at all to the species carrying them, but that they often lead an exclusively parasitic existence ... [B chromosomes] need not be useful for the plants. They need only be useful to themselves.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Around the same time, several other examples of selfish genetic elements were reported. For example, the American maize geneticist [[Marcus Morton Rhoades|Marcus Rhoades]] described how chromosomal knobs led to female [[meiotic drive]] in maize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rhoades MM | title = Preferential Segregation in Maize | journal = Genetics | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 395–407 | date = July 1942 | pmid = 17247049 | pmc = 1209167 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, this was also when it was first suggested that an [[intragenomic conflict]] between [[uniparental inheritance|uniparentally inherited]] mitochondrial genes and biparentally inherited nuclear genes could lead to [[cytoplasmic male sterility]] in plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lewis D | title = Male sterility in natural populations of hermaphrodite plants the equilibrium between females and hermaphrodites to be expected with different types of inheritance. | journal = New Phytologist | date = April 1941 | volume = 40 | issue = 1 | pages = 56–63 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8137.1941.tb07028.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in the early 1950s, [[Barbara McClintock]] published a series of papers describing the existence of [[transposable element]]s, which are now recognized to be among the most successful selfish genetic elements.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McClintock B | title = The origin and behavior of mutable loci in maize | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 344–55 | date = June 1950 | pmid = 15430309 | pmc = 1063197 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.36.6.344 | bibcode = 1950PNAS...36..344M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of transposable elements led to her being awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in 1983]].

The empirical study of selfish genetic elements benefited greatly from the emergence of the so-called gene-centred view of evolution in the nineteen sixties and seventies.&lt;ref name=&quot;:25&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ågren JA | title = Selfish genetic elements and the gene's-eye view of evolution | journal = Current Zoology | volume = 62 | issue = 6 | pages = 659–665 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 29491953 | pmc = 5804262 | doi = 10.1093/cz/zow102  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast with Darwin's original formulation of the theory of evolution by natural selection that focused on individual organisms, the gene's-eye view takes the gene to be the central unit of selection in evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Selfish Genes |last1= Ågren |first1=Jon Arvid |last2=Hurst |first2=Greg | name-list-style = vanc |date=2017-10-25 |website=Oxford Bibliographies Online Datasets |doi=10.1093/obo/9780199941728-0094 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It conceives evolution by natural selection as a process involving two separate entities: replicators (entities that produce faithful copies of themselves, usually genes) and vehicles (or interactors; entities that interact with the ecological environment, usually organisms).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The extended phenotype : the long reach of the gene|last=Dawkins |first=Richard | name-list-style = vanc |authorlink=Richard Dawkins|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1982|oclc=610269469}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Dawkins R | chapter = Replicators and vehicles | editor = King's College Sociobiology Group, Cambridge | title =  Current Problems in Sociobiology. | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = June 1982 | pages = 45–64 | isbn = 978-0-521-28520-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Hull DL | chapter = Units of Evolution: A Metaphysical Essay | veditors = Jensen UJ, Harré R | title = The Philosophy of Evolution | publisher = St. Martin's Press | date = 1981 | pages = 23–44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since organisms are temporary occurrences, present in one generation and gone in the next, genes (replicators) are the only entity faithfully transmitted from parent to offspring. Viewing evolution as a struggle between competing replicators made it easier to recognize that not all genes in an organism would share the same evolutionary fate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:25&quot; /&gt;

The gene's-eye view was a synthesis of the population genetic models of the modern synthesis, in particular the work of [[RA Fisher]], and the social evolution models of [[W. D. Hamilton]]. The view was popularized by  [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George Williams]]'s ''[[Adaptation and Natural Selection]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; and [[Richard Dawkins]]'s best seller ''[[The Selfish Gene]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;TSG&quot;/&gt; Dawkins summarized a key benefit from the gene's-eye view as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;If we allow ourselves the license of talking about genes as if they had conscious aims, always reassuring ourselves that we could translate our sloppy language back into respectable terms if we wanted to, we can ask the question, what is a single selfish gene trying to do?&quot;  — Richard Dawkins, ''The Selfish Gene''&lt;ref name=&quot;TSG&quot;/&gt;{{rp|p. 88}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1980, two high profile papers published back-to-back in ''Nature'' by Leslie Orgel and Francis Crick, and by Ford Doolittle and Carmen Sapienza, brought the study of selfish genetic elements to the centre of biological debate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; The papers took their starting point in the contemporary debate of the so-called [[C-value|C-value paradox]], the lack of correlation between genome size and perceived complexity of a species. Both papers attempted to counter the prevailing view of the time that the presence of differential amounts of non-coding DNA and transposable elements is best explained from the perspective of individual fitness, described as the &quot;phenotypic paradigm&quot; by Doolittle and Sapienza. Instead, the authors argued that much of the genetic material in eukaryotic genomes persists, not because of its phenotypic effects, but can be understood from a gene's-eye view, without invoking individual-level explanations. The two papers led to a series of exchanges in ''Nature''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cavalier-Smith T | title = How selfish is DNA? | journal = Nature | volume = 285 | issue = 5767 | pages = 617–8 | date = June 1980 | pmid = 7393317 | doi = 10.1038/285617a0 | bibcode = 1980Natur.285..617C | s2cid = 27111068 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dover G | title = Ignorant DNA? | journal = Nature | volume = 285 | issue = 5767 | pages = 618–20 | date = June 1980 | pmid = 7393318 | doi = 10.1038/285618a0 | bibcode = 1980Natur.285..618D | s2cid = 4261755 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dover G, Doolittle WF | title = Modes of genome evolution | journal = Nature | volume = 288 | issue = 5792 | pages = 646–7 | date = December 1980 | pmid = 6256636 | doi = 10.1038/288646a0 | bibcode = 1980Natur.288..646D | s2cid = 8938434 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Orgel LE, Crick FH, Sapienza C | title = Selfish DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 288 | issue = 5792 | pages = 645–6 | date = December 1980 | pmid = 7453798 | doi = 10.1038/288645a0 | bibcode = 1980Natur.288..645O | s2cid = 4370178 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current views ===
If the selfish DNA papers marked the beginning of the serious study of selfish genetic elements, the subsequent decades have seen an explosion in theoretical advances and empirical discoveries. [[Leda Cosmides]] and [[John Tooby]] wrote a landmark review about the conflict between maternally inherited cytoplasmic genes and biparentally inherited nuclear genes.&lt;ref name=&quot;:20&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cosmides LM, Tooby J | title = Cytoplasmic inheritance and intragenomic conflict | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 89 | issue = 1 | pages = 83–129 | date = March 1981 | pmid = 7278311 | doi = 10.1016/0022-5193(81)90181-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper also provided a comprehensive introduction to the logic of genomic conflicts, foreshadowing many themes that would later be subject of much research. Then in 1988 [[John H. Werren]] and colleagues wrote the first major empirical review of the topic.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; This paper achieved three things. First, it coined the term selfish genetic element, putting an end to a sometimes confusingly diverse terminology (selfish genes, ultra-selfish genes, selfish DNA, parasitic DNA, genomic outlaws). Second, it formally defined the concept of selfish genetic elements. Finally, it was the first paper to bring together all different kinds of selfish genetic elements known at the time ([[genomic imprinting]], for example, was not covered).&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

In the late 1980s, most molecular biologists considered selfish genetic elements to be the exception, and that genomes were best thought of as highly integrated networks with a coherent effect on organismal fitness.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:30&quot; /&gt; In 2006, when [[Austin Burt]] and [[Robert Trivers]] published the first book-length treatment of the topic, the tide was changing.&lt;ref name=&quot;:30&quot; /&gt; While their role in evolution long remained controversial, in a review published a century after their first discovery, [[William R. Rice]] concluded that &quot;nothing in genetics makes sense except in the light of genomic conflicts&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rice|first=William R. | name-list-style = vanc |date=2013-11-23|title=Nothing in Genetics Makes Sense Except in Light of Genomic Conflict |journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|volume=44|issue=1|pages=217–237|doi=10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-110411-160242|issn=1543-592X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logic ==
Though selfish genetic elements show a remarkable diversity in the way they promote their own transmission, some generalizations about their biology can be made. In a classic 2001 review, Gregory D.D. Hurst and John H. Werren proposed two ‘rules' of selfish genetic elements.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

=== Rule 1: Spread requires sex and outbreeding ===
Sexual reproduction involves the mixing of genes from two individuals. According to [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendel's Law of Segregation]], alleles in a sexually reproducing organism have a 50% chance of being passed from parent to offspring. Meiosis is therefore sometimes referred to as &quot;fair&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levinton|first=Jeffrey | name-list-style = vanc |date= June 1972 |title=Adaptation and Diversity.

Highly self-fertilizing or asexual genomes are expected to experience less conflict between selfish genetic elements and the rest of the host genome than outcrossing sexual genomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hickey |first=Donal A. | name-list-style = vanc |date=October 1984 |title=DNA can be a selfish parasite |journal=Nature|volume=311|issue=5985|pages=417–418|doi=10.1038/311417d0|bibcode=1984Natur.311..417H |s2cid=4362210 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wright S, Finnegan D | title = Genome evolution: sex and the transposable element | journal = Current Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = R296–9 | date = April 2001 | pmid = 11369217 | doi = 10.1016/s0960-9822(01)00168-3 | s2cid = 2088287 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wright |first1=Stephen I. |last2=Schoen |first2=Daniel J. | name-list-style = vanc |title=Transposon dynamics and the breeding system|date=2000| work=Transposable Elements and Genome Evolution|volume=107 |issue=1–3 |pages=139–148|publisher=Springer Netherlands|pmid=10952207 |isbn=9789401058124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several reasons for this. First, sex and outcrossing put selfish genetic elements into new genetic lineages. In contrast, in a highly selfing or asexual lineage, any selfish genetic element is essentially stuck in that lineage, which should increase variation in fitness among individuals. The increased variation should result in stronger purifying selection in selfers/asexuals, as a lineage without the selfish genetic elements should out-compete a lineage with the selfish genetic element. Second, the increased homozygosity in selfers removes the opportunity for competition among homologous alleles. Third, theoretical work has shown that the greater linkage disequilibrium in selfing compared to outcrossing genomes may in some, albeit rather limited, cases cause selection for reduced transposition rates.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Charlesworth B, Langley CH | title = The evolution of self-regulated transposition of transposable elements | journal = Genetics | volume = 112 | issue = 2 | pages = 359–83 | date = February 1986 | pmid = 3000868 | pmc = 1202706 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, this reasoning leads to the prediction that asexuals/selfers should experience a lower load of selfish genetic elements. One caveat to this is that the evolution of selfing is associated with a reduction in the [[effective population size]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nordborg M | title = Linkage disequilibrium, gene trees and selfing: an ancestral recombination graph with partial self-fertilization | journal = Genetics | volume = 154 | issue = 2 | pages = 923–9 | date = February 2000 | pmid = 10655241 | pmc = 1460950 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A reduction in the effective population size should reduce the efficacy of selection and therefore leads to the opposite prediction: higher accumulation of selfish genetic elements in selfers relative to outcrossers.

Empirical evidence for the importance of sex and outcrossing comes from a variety of selfish genetic elements, including transposable elements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arkhipova I, Meselson M | title = Transposable elements in sexual and ancient asexual taxa | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 97 | issue = 26 | pages = 14473–7 | date = December 2000 | pmid = 11121049 | pmc = 18943 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.97.26.14473 | bibcode = 2000PNAS...9714473A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Agren JÅ, Wang W, Koenig D, Neuffer B, Weigel D, Wright SI | title = Mating system shifts and transposable element evolution in the plant genus Capsella | journal = BMC Genomics | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 602 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 25030755 | pmc = 4112209 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2164-15-602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; self-promoting plasmids,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harrison E, MacLean RC, Koufopanou V, Burt A | title = Sex drives intracellular conflict in yeast | journal = Journal of Evolutionary Biology | volume = 27 | issue = 8 | pages = 1757–63 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 24825743 | doi = 10.1111/jeb.12408 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and B chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Burt A, Trivers R | date=1998-01-22|title=Selfish DNA and breeding system in flowering plants |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=265|issue=1391|pages=141–146|doi=10.1098/rspb.1998.0275| pmc=1688861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

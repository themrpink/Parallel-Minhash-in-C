In Asia, an alternative approach to cultivating asparagus has been employed and is referred to as 'Mother Stalk Method' where three to five stalks per plant are allowed to develop into fern, while harvesting adjacent spears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bhowmik |first1=Pankaj Kumar |last2=Matsui |first2=Toshiyuki |last3=Ikeuchi |first3=Takao |last4=Suzuki |first4=Haruo |title=Changes in storage quality and shelf life of green asparagus over an extended harvest season |journal=Postharvest Biology and Technology |date=November 2002 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=323–328|doi=10.1016/S0925-5214(02)00062-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Celebrations ===
The green crop is significant enough in California's [[Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta]] region that the city of [[Stockton, California|Stockton]] holds a festival every year to celebrate it. [[Oceana County, Michigan]], the self-proclaimed &quot;asparagus capital of the world&quot; hosts an annual festival complete with a parade and asparagus queen;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=National Asparagus Festival|url=https://www.nationalasparagusfestival.org/|access-date=2020-10-20|website=asparagusfestival|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Vale of Evesham]] in [[Worcestershire]] is the largest producer within Northern Europe,{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} celebrating with the annual British Asparagus Festival involving auctions of the best crop, an &quot;Asparagus Run&quot; modelled on the Beaujolais Run and a weekend &quot;Asparafest&quot; music festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britishasparagusfestival.org/about/ | title=About the Festival | work = British Aparagus Festival | publisher = British Asparagus Festival | access-date = 26 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many German cities hold an annual ''Spargelfest'' (asparagus festival) celebrating the harvest of white asparagus. [[Schwetzingen]] claims to be the &quot;Asparagus Capital of the World&quot;,&lt;ref name=CSMonitor/&gt; and during its festival, an Asparagus Queen is crowned. The Bavarian city of [[Nuremberg]] feasts a week long in April, with a competition to find the fastest asparagus peeler in the region; this usually involves generous amounts of the local wines and beers being consumed to aid the spectators' appreciative support.
&lt;!--&quot;The town of Beelitz in the Berlin-Brandenburg metropolitan area&quot; was mentioned here, situating it in northeastern Germany that (see Cultivation) is famous for asparagus cultivation — but not a word about a festival...--&gt;

Helmut Zipner, who peeled a ton of asparagus in 16 hours, holds the world record in asparagus peeling.&lt;ref name=CSMonitor&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0514/p17s01-hfgn.html?page=2 | title = Buried treasure: white asparagus | first = William A. | last = Davis | date = 14 May 2008 | location = Schwetzingen, Germany | work = The Christian Science Monitor | access-date = 26 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vernacular names and etymology ==
''A. officinalis'' is widely known simply as &quot;asparagus&quot;, and may be confused with unrelated plant species also known as &quot;asparagus&quot;, such as ''[[Ornithogalum pyrenaicum]]'' known as &quot;Prussian asparagus&quot; for its edible shoots.

The English word &quot;asparagus&quot; derives from classical [[Latin language|Latin]] but the plant was once known in English as ''sperage'', from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''sparagus''.&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot; name=anno1000 /&gt; This term itself derives from the Greek ''aspharagos'' or ''asparagos'', and the Greek term originates from the [[Persian language|Persian]] ''asparag'', meaning &quot;sprout&quot; or &quot;shoot&quot;. Asparagus was also [[folk etymology|corrupted]] in some places to &quot;sparrow grass&quot;; indeed, [[John Walker (naturalist)|John Walker]] wrote in 1791 that &quot;''Sparrowgrass'' is so general that ''asparagus'' has an air of stiffness and pedantry&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MGAJAAAAQAAJ&amp;q=an+air+of+stiffness+and+pedantry%22+%5BJohn+Walker&amp;pg=PA169|title=A Critical Pronouncing Dictionary, and Expositor of the English Language|accessdate=18 November 2016|year=1806|last1=Walker|first1=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The name 'sparrow grass' was still in common use in rural East Anglia, England well into the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Ewart Evans, George &quot;Ask the Fellows who Cut the Hay&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In Turkish, asparagus is known as ''kuşkonmaz'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to consume asparagus|url=http://www.1organik.com/kuskonmaz-nasil-tuketilir-tilkisen-kedirgen-ayrelli.html|language=Turkish|publisher=1organik.com|accessdate=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; literally &quot;[a] bird won't land [on it]&quot;, in reference to the shape of the plant. 

In India, especially in the state of Maharashtra, it is not cultivated but it grows naturally in the farms during monsoon season. Farmers from rural areas and some tribal people use asparagus as a vegetable in local cuisine. 

It is called as 'Sasur /  Susar  Muli' (ससूर/ सुसर मुळी) in Marathi, a local language of the state of Maharashtra, India.

== Effects on urine ==
The effect of eating asparagus on [[urine]] excreted afterwards has long been observed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Asparagus] cause a powerful and disagreeable smell in the urine, as everybody knows.
:— ''Treatise of All Sorts of Foods'', [[Louis Lemery]], 1702&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGee|first=Harold|title=McGee on Food and Cooking|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|year=2004|pages=315|chapter=6|isbn=978-0-340-83149-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;asparagus... affects the urine with a [[wikt:foetid|foetid]] smell (especially if cut when they are white) and therefore have been suspected by some physicians as not friendly to the kidneys; when they are older, and begin to ramify, they lose this quality; but then they are not so agreeable.

Asparagus contains [[asparagusic acid]]. When the vegetable is digested, a group of volatile [[sulfur]]-containing compounds is produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-asparagus-makes-your-urine-smell-49961252/?no-ist|title=Why Asparagus Makes Your Urine Smell|first=Joseph|last=Stromberg|work=smithsonianmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asparagus has been eaten and cultivated for at least two millennia but the association between odorous urine and asparagus consumption was not observed until the late 17th century when sulfur-rich fertilisers became common in agriculture.&lt;ref name = Idiosyncrasies&gt;{{cite journal|last = Mitchell|first = S.

Debate exists about the universality of producing the sulfurous smell, as well as the ability to detect it.  Originally, this was thought to be because some people digested asparagus differently from others, so some excreted odorous urine after eating asparagus, and others did not. In the 1980s, three studies from France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. | title=Odorous urine in man after asparagus | author1=C. RICHER | author2=N. DECKER | author3=J.

The Israeli study found that from their 307 subjects, all of those who could smell &quot;asparagus urine&quot; could detect it in the urine of anyone who had eaten asparagus, even if the person who produced it could not detect it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Br.

In 2010, the company [[23andMe]] published a [[genome-wide association study]] on whether participants have &quot;ever noticed a peculiar odor when you pee after eating asparagus?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=PLOS Genet. | title=Web-Based, Participant-Driven Studies Yield Novel Genetic Associations for Common Traits | year=2010 |vauthors=Eriksson N, Macpherson JM, Tung JY, Hon LS, Naughton B, Saxonov S, Avey L, Wojcicki A, Pe'er I, Mountain J | pmid=20585627 | doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000993 | pmc=2891811 | editor1-last=Gibson | editor1-first=Greg | volume=6 | issue=6 | pages=e1000993}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This study pinpointed a [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) in a cluster of olfactory genes associated with the ability to detect the odor.  While this SNP did not explain all of the difference in detection between people, it provides support for the theory that genetic differences occur in  olfactory receptors that lead people to be unable to smell these odorous compounds.

Certain compounds in asparagus are [[metabolism|metabolized]] to yield ammonia and various [[sulfur]]-containing degradation products, including various [[thiol]]s and [[thioester]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Science | volume=189 | pages=810–11 | year=1975  | author=White RH. | title=Occurrence of S-methyl thioesters in urines of humans after they have eaten asparagus | pmid=1162354 | doi = 10.1126/science.1162354 | issue=4205 | bibcode=1975Sci...189..810W }}&lt;/ref&gt; which give urine a characteristic smell.

Subjectively, the first two are the most pungent, while the last two (sulfur-oxidized) give a sweet aroma. A mixture of these compounds form a &quot;reconstituted asparagus urine&quot; odor.

As these are more present in young asparagus, this accords with the observation that the smell is more pronounced after eating young asparagus.

A '''flatfish''' is a member of the [[Ray-finned fish|ray-finned]] [[demersal fish]] [[order (biology)|order]] '''Pleuronectiformes''', also called the Heterosomata, sometimes classified as a suborder of [[Perciformes]].  In many species, both eyes lie on one side of the head, one or the other migrating through or around the head during development. Some species face their left sides upward, some face their right sides upward, and others face either side upward.

Many important [[food fish]] are in this order, including the [[flounder]]s, [[sole (fish)|sole]]s, [[turbot]], [[plaice]], and [[halibut]]. Some flatfish can [[camouflage]] themselves on the ocean floor.

==Taxonomy==
Over 800 described species are placed into 16 families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=Matthew A.|last2=Chanet|first2=Bruno|last3=Chen|first3=Jhen‐Nien|last4=Lee|first4=Mao‐Ying|last5=Chen|first5=Wei‐Jen|date=2019|title=Origins and relationships of the Pleuronectoidei: Molecular and morphological analysis of living and fossil taxa|journal=Zoologica Scripta|language=en|volume=48|issue=5|pages=640–656|doi=10.1111/zsc.12372|s2cid=202856805|issn=0300-3256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly, the flatfishes are divided into two suborders, Psettodoidei and Pleuronectoidei, with &gt; 99% of the species diversity found within the Pleuronectoidei.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fishes of the world|last=Nelson, Joseph S. VerfasserIn.|isbn=9781118342336|oclc=958002567|date = 2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest families are [[Soleidae]], [[Bothidae]] and [[Tonguefish|Cynoglossidae]] with more than 150 species each. There also exist two monotypic families ([[Paralichthodidae]] and [[Oncopteridae]]). Some families are the results of relatively recent splits. For example, the [[Achiridae]] were classified as a subfamily of Soleidae in the past, and the [[Samaridae]] were considered a subfamily of the Pleuronectidae.&lt;ref name=&quot;RandallHawaii&quot;&gt;Randall, J. E. (2007). ''Reef and Shore Fishes of the Hawaiian Islands.'' {{ISBN|1-929054-03-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CopperChapleau&quot;&gt;Cooper, J.A.; and Chapleau, F. (1998). ''Monophyly and intrarelationships of the family Pleuronectidae (Pleuronectiformes), with a revised classification.'' Fish. Bull. 96 (4): 686–726.&lt;/ref&gt; The families [[Paralichthodidae]], [[Poecilopsettidae]], and [[Rhombosoleidae]] were also traditionally treated as subfamilies of Pleuronectidae, but are now recognised as families in their own right.&lt;ref name=CopperChapleau/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson-2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NGW-2016&quot;/&gt; The [[Paralichthyidae]] has long been indicated to be paraphyletic, with the formal description of [[Cyclopsettidae]] in 2019 resulting in the split of this family as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=Matthew A.|last2=Chanet|first2=Bruno|last3=Chen|first3=Jhen‐Nien|last4=Lee|first4=Mao‐Ying|last5=Chen|first5=Wei‐Jen|date=2019|title=Origins and relationships of the Pleuronectoidei: Molecular and morphological analysis of living and fossil taxa|journal=Zoologica Scripta|language=en|volume=48|issue=5|pages=640–656|doi=10.1111/zsc.12372|s2cid=202856805|issn=0300-3256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of some groups is in need of a review, as the last [[monograph]] covering the entire order was [[John Roxborough Norman]]'s ''Monograph of the Flatfishes'' published in 1934. In particular, ''[[Tephrinectes sinensis]]'' may represent a family-level lineage and requires further evaluation e.g.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoshino|first=Koichi|date=2001-11-01|title=Monophyly of the Citharidae (Pleuronectoidei: Pleuronectiformes: Teleostei) with considerations of pleuronectoid phylogeny|journal=Ichthyological Research|volume=48|issue=4|pages=391–404|doi=10.1007/s10228-001-8163-0|s2cid=46318428|issn=1341-8998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[New species]] are described with some regularity and [[undescribed species]] likely remain.&lt;ref name=RandallHawaii/&gt;

===Hybrids===
[[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrids]] are well known in flatfishes. The Pleuronectidae, of marine fishes, have the largest number of reported hybrids.&lt;ref name=hybridsole&gt;Garrett, D.L.; Pietsch, T.W.; Utter, F.M.; and Hauser, L. (2007). ''The Hybrid Sole Inopsetta ischyra (Teleostei: Pleuronectiformes: Pleuronectidae): Hybrid or Biological Species?'' American Fisheries Society 136: 460–468&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the most famous [[intergeneric hybrid]]s are between the [[European plaice]] (''Pleuronectes platessa'') and [[European flounder]] (''Platichthys flesus'') in the [[Baltic Sea]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]]: ''[http://www.fao.org/fishery/species/2550/en Platichthys flesus (Linnaeus, 1758).]''. Retrieved 18 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and between the [[English sole]] (''Parophrys vetulus'') and [[starry flounder]] (''Platichthys stellatus'') in [[Puget Sound]]. The offspring of the latter species pair is popularly known as the hybrid sole and was initially believed to be a valid species in its own right.&lt;ref name=hybridsole/&gt;

==Distribution==
Flatfishes are found in oceans worldwide, ranging from the [[Arctic]], through the tropics, to [[Antarctica]]. Species diversity is centered in the Indo-West Pacific and declines following both latitudinal and longitudinal gradients away from the Indo-West Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=Matthew A.|last2=Chanet|first2=Bruno|last3=Chen|first3=Jhen-Nien|last4=Lee|first4=Mao-Ying|last5=Chen|first5=Wei-Jen|date=2019|title=Origins and relationships of the Pleuronectoidei: Molecular and morphological analysis of living and fossil taxa|journal=Zoologica Scripta|language=en|volume=48|issue=5|pages=640–656|doi=10.1111/zsc.12372|s2cid=202856805|issn=1463-6409}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most species are found in depths between 0 and {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}}, but a few have been recorded from depths in excess of {{convert|1500|m|ft|abbr=on}}. None have been confirmed from the [[abyssal]] or [[hadal zone]]s. An observation of a flatfish from the [[Bathyscaphe Trieste]] at the bottom of the [[Mariana Trench]] at a depth of almost {{convert|11|km|ft|abbr=on}} has been questioned by fish experts, and recent authorities do not recognize it as valid.&lt;ref&gt;Jamieson, A.J., and Yancey, P. H. (2012). ''[http://www.biolbull.org/content/222/3/171.full On the Validity of the Trieste Flatfish: Dispelling the Myth.]'' [[The Biological Bulletin]] 222(3): 171-175&lt;/ref&gt; Among the deepwater species, ''[[Symphurus thermophilus]]'' lives in congregating around &quot;ponds&quot; of [[sulphur]] at [[hydrothermal vent]]s on the seafloor. No other flatfish is known from hydrothermal vents.&lt;ref&gt;Munroe, T.A.; and Hashimoto, J. (2008). ''A new Western Pacific Tonguefish (Pleuronectiformes: Cynoglossidae): The first Pleuronectiform discovered at active Hydrothermal Vents.'' Zootaxa 1839: 43–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Many species will enter [[brackish]] or fresh water, and a smaller number of soles (families [[Achiridae]] and [[Soleidae]]) and tonguefish ([[Cynoglossidae]]) are entirely restricted to fresh water.&lt;ref&gt;Duplain, R.R.; Chapleau, F; and Munroe, T.A.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Pseudopleuronectes americanus.jpg|thumb|left|Flatfish are asymmetrical, with both eyes lying on the same side of the head]]
[[File:Platichthys flesus - en.pdf|thumb|left|European flounder, like other flatish, experience an eye migration during their lifetime.]]
The most obvious characteristic of the flatfish is its [[asymmetry]], with both eyes lying on the same side of the head in the adult fish. In some families, the eyes are usually on the right side of the body (dextral or right-eyed flatfish), and in others, they are usually on the left (sinistral or left-eyed flatfish). The primitive [[spiny turbot]]s include equal numbers of right- and left-sided individuals, and are generally less asymmetrical than the other families.&lt;ref name=EoF/&gt; Other distinguishing features of the order are the presence of protrusible eyes, another adaptation to living on the [[seabed]] ([[benthos]]), and the extension of the dorsal fin onto the head.

The surface of the fish facing away from the sea floor is pigmented, often serving to [[camouflage]] the fish, but sometimes with striking coloured patterns. Some flatfishes are also able to change their pigmentation to match the background, in a manner similar to some [[cephalopods]]. The side of the body without the eyes, facing the seabed, is usually colourless or very pale.&lt;ref name=EoF&gt;{{cite book |editor=Paxton, J.R. |editor2=Eschmeyer, W.N.|author1=Chapleau, Francois  |author2=Amaoka, Kunio|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= xxx|isbn= 0-12-547665-5 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, flatfishes rely on their camouflage for avoiding predators, but some have conspicuous [[Eyespot (mimicry)|eyespots]] (e.g., ''[[Microchirus ocellatus]]'') and several small tropical species (at least ''[[Aseraggodes]]'', ''[[Pardachirus]]'' and ''[[Zebrias]]'') are poisonous.&lt;ref name=RandallHawaii/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elst, R. van der (1997) ''A Guide to the Common Sea Fishes of South Africa.'' {{ISBN|978-1868253944}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Debelius, H.

(2010). ''A “Mimic Octopus” in the Atlantic: Flatfish Mimicry and Camouflage by Macrotritopus defilippi.'' [[The Biological Bulletin]] 218(1): 15-24&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[flounder]]s and spiny turbots eat smaller fish, and have well-developed teeth. They sometimes seek prey in the midwater, away from the bottom, and show fewer extreme adaptations than other families. The [[Sole (fish)|sole]]s, by contrast, are almost exclusively bottom-dwellers, and feed on invertebrates. They show a more extreme asymmetry, and may lack teeth on one side of the jaw.&lt;ref name=EoF/&gt;

Flatfishes range in size from ''[[Tarphops oligolepis]]'', measuring about {{convert|4.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, and weighing {{convert|2|g|oz|abbr=on}}, to the [[Atlantic halibut]], at {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|316|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=EoF/&gt;

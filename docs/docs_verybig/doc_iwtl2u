In adaptive [[high-frequency]] (HF) [[radio]], '''link quality analysis''' ('''LQA''') is the overall process by which measurements of [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] quality are made, assessed, and analyzed.

In LQA, signal quality is determined by measuring, assessing, and analyzing [[Data link|link]] parameters, such as [[bit error ratio]] (BER), and the levels of the ratio of signal-plus-[[noise]]-plus-[[distortion]] to noise-plus-distortion ([[SINAD]]). Measurements are stored at—and exchanged between—stations, for use in making decisions about link establishment.

For adaptive HF radio, LQA is automatically performed and is usually based on analyses of pseudo-BERs and SINAD readings.

[[File:Pupin coils in PTT Museum in Belgrade 04.jpg|300px|thumb|Pupin coils in [[PTT Museum in Belgrade]] (Serbia)]]

A '''loading coil''' or '''load coil''' is an [[inductor]] that is inserted into an [[electronic circuit]] to increase its [[inductance]]. The term originated in the 19th century for inductors used to prevent signal distortion in long-distance telegraph transmission cables. The term is also used for inductors in [[antenna (radio)|radio antenna]]s, or between the antenna and its [[feedline]], to make an [[electrically short]] antenna [[resonance|resonant]] at its operating frequency.

The concept of loading coils was discovered by [[Oliver Heaviside]] in studying the problem of slow signalling speed of the first [[transatlantic telegraph cable]] in the 1860s. He concluded additional inductance was required to prevent amplitude and time delay distortion of the transmitted signal.  The mathematical condition for distortion-free transmission is known as the [[Heaviside condition]].  Previous telegraph lines were overland or shorter and hence had less delay, and the need for extra inductance was not as great.  [[Submarine communications cable]]s are particularly subject to the problem, but early 20th century installations using [[balanced pair]]s were often continuously loaded with iron wire or tape rather than discretely with loading coils, which avoided the sealing problem.

Loading coils are historically also known as '''Pupin coils''' after [[Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin|Mihajlo Pupin]], especially when used for the Heaviside condition and the process of inserting them is sometimes called ''pupinization''.

==Applications==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}
[[File:Loaded line schematic.svg|thumb|600px|center|Schematic of a balanced loaded telephone line.  The capacitors are not discrete components but represent the distributed capacitance between the closely spaced wire conductors of the line, this is indicated by the dotted lines.  The loading coils prevent the audio (voice) signal from being distorted by the line capacitance.  The windings of the loading coil are wound such that the magnetic flux induced in the core is in the same direction for both windings.]]

===Telephone lines===

| footer   = ''(left)'' Toroidal 0.175 H loading coil for an AT&amp;T long distance telephone trunkline from New York to Chicago 1922. Each of the 108 twisted pairs in the cable required a coil.  The coils were enclosed in an oil-filled steel tank ''(right)'' on the telephone pole.  The cable required loading coils every 6000 ft (1.83 km).
}}

A common application of loading coils is to improve the [[voice frequency|voice-frequency]] amplitude response characteristics of the [[twisted pair|twisted balanced pairs]] in a telephone cable.  Because twisted pair is a [[balanced line|balanced]] format, half the loading coil must be inserted in each leg of the pair to maintain the balance.  It is common for both these windings to be formed on the same core.  This increases the [[magnetic flux|flux]] linkages, without which the number of turns on the coil would need to be increased. Despite the use of common cores, such loading coils do not comprise [[transformer]]s, as they do not provide [[coupling (electronics)|coupling]] to other circuits.

Loading coils inserted periodically in series with a pair of wires reduce the [[attenuation]] at the higher voice frequencies up to the [[cutoff frequency]] of the [[low-pass filter]] formed by the inductance of the coils (plus the distributed inductance of the wires) and the distributed capacitance between the wires. Above the cutoff frequency, attenuation increases rapidly.  The shorter the distance between the coils, the higher the cut-off frequency.  The cutoff effect is an artifact of using [[lumped-element model|lumped]] inductors.  With loading methods using continuous [[distributed-element model|distributed]] inductance there is no cutoff.

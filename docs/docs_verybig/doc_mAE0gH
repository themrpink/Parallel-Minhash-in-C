==Contemporary uses==
===Steadicam===
{{Main|Steadicam}}
A [[Steadicam]] rig was employed during the filming of ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', in conjunction with two gyroscopes for extra stabilization, to film the background plates for the [[speeder bike]] chase. Steadicam inventor [[Garrett Brown]] operated the shot, walking through a redwood forest, running the camera at one frame per second. When projected at 24 frames per second, it gave the impression of flying through the air at perilous speeds.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Garrett. &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, ''[[American Cinematographer]]'', June 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EmpireOfDreams&quot;&gt;''Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy'' Star Wars Trilogy Box Set DVD documentary, [2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heading indicator===
{{Main|Heading indicator}}
The heading indicator or directional gyro has an axis of rotation that is set horizontally, pointing north. Unlike a magnetic compass, it does not seek north. When being used in an airliner, for example, it will slowly drift away from north and will need to be reoriented periodically, using a magnetic compass as a reference.{{sfn|Feynman|Gottlieb|Leighton|2013|pp=115-135}}

===Gyrocompass===
{{Main article|Gyrocompass}}
Unlike a directional gyro or heading indicator, a gyrocompass seeks north. It detects the rotation of the Earth about its axis and seeks the ''true'' north, rather than the ''magnetic'' north. Gyrocompasses usually have built-in damping to prevent overshoot when re-calibrating from sudden movement.

===Accelerometer===
{{Main article|Accelerometer}}
By determining an object's acceleration and integrating over time, the velocity of the object can be calculated. Integrating again, position can be determined. The simplest accelerometer is a weight that is free to move horizontally, which is attached to a spring and a device to measure the tension in the spring. This can be improved by introducing a counteracting force to push the weight back and to measure the force needed to prevent the weight from moving. A more complicated design consists of a gyroscope with a weight on one of the axes. The device will react to the force generated by the weight when it is accelerated, by integrating that force to produce a velocity.{{sfn|Feynman|Gottlieb|Leighton|2013|pp=131-135}}

== Variations ==

=== Gyrostat ===

A '''gyrostat''' consists of a massive flywheel concealed in a solid casing.&lt;ref&gt;William Thomson (1875). ''Proc. London Math. Soc.'', vol. 6, pages 190&amp;ndash;194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Gray (physicist)|Andrew Gray]] (1979). ''A Treatise on Gyrostatics and Rotational Motion: Theory and Applications'' (Dover, New York)&lt;/ref&gt; Its behaviour on a table, or with various modes of suspension or support, serves to illustrate the curious reversal of the ordinary laws of static equilibrium due to the gyrostatic behaviour of the interior invisible flywheel when rotated rapidly. The first gyrostat was designed by [[Lord Kelvin]] to illustrate the more complicated state of motion of a spinning body when free to wander about on a horizontal plane, like a top spun on the pavement, or a bicycle on the road. Kelvin also made use of gyrostats to develop mechanical theories of the elasticity of matter and of the ether.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kargon, Peter Achinstein, Baron William Thomson Kelvin: &quot;Kelvin's Baltimore Lectures and Modern Theoretical Physics: Historical and Philosophical Perspectives&quot; [[The MIT Press]], 1987, {{ISBN|978-0-262-11117-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern continuum mechanics there is a variety of these models, based on ideas of Lord Kelvin. They represent a specific type of Cosserat theories (suggested for the first time by [[Eugène Cosserat]] and [[François Cosserat]]), which can be used for description of artificially made smart materials as well as of other complex media. One of them, so-called Kelvin's medium, has the same equations as magnetic insulators near the state of magnetic saturation in the approximation of quasimagnetostatics.&lt;ref&gt; E. Grekova, P. Zhilin (2001). ''Journal of elasticity'', Springer, vol. 64, pages 29&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, the gyrostat concept is used in the design of attitude control systems for orbiting spacecraft and satellites.&lt;ref&gt;Peter C. Hughes (2004). ''Spacecraft Attitude Dynamics'' {{ISBN|0-486-43925-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the Mir space station had three pairs of internally mounted flywheels known as ''gyrodynes'' or ''control moment gyros''.&lt;ref&gt;D. M. Harland (1997)  ''The MIR Space Station'' (Wiley); D. M. Harland (2005) ''The Story of Space Station MIR'' (Springer).&lt;/ref&gt;

In physics, there are several systems whose dynamical equations resemble the equations of motion of a gyrostat.&lt;ref&gt;C. Tong (2009). ''American Journal of Physics'' vol. 77, pages 526&amp;ndash;537&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include a solid body with a cavity filled with an inviscid, incompressible, homogeneous liquid,&lt;ref&gt;N.N. Moiseyev and V.V. Rumyantsev (1968). ''Dynamic Stability of Bodies Containing Fluid'' (Springer, New York)&lt;/ref&gt; the static equilibrium configuration of a stressed elastic rod in [[elastica theory]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Larmor]] (1884). ''Proc. London Math. Soc.'' vol. 15, pages 170&amp;ndash;184&lt;/ref&gt; the polarization dynamics of a light pulse propagating through a nonlinear medium,&lt;ref&gt;M.V. Tratnik and J.E. Sipe (1987). ''Physical Review A'' vol. 35, pages 2965&amp;ndash;2975&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Lorenz system]] in chaos theory,&lt;ref&gt;A.B. Gluhovsky (1982). ''Soviet Physics Doklady'' vol. 27, pages 823&amp;ndash;825&lt;/ref&gt; and the motion of an ion in a [[Penning trap]] mass spectrometer.&lt;ref&gt;S. Eliseev et al. (2011). ''Physical Review Letters'' vol. 107, paper 152501&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MEMS Gyroscope ===
{{main article|Vibrating structure gyroscope}}

A [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS) gyroscope is a miniaturized gyroscope found in electronic devices. It takes the idea of the [[Foucault pendulum]] and uses a vibrating element.

=== HRG ===

The [[hemispherical resonator gyroscope]] (HRG), also called a wine-glass gyroscope{{contradict-inline |reason= According to [[Gyroscope#VSG or CVG]], a &quot;vibrating structure gyroscope&quot; is called a &quot;wine-glass resonator&quot;|date=February 2015}} or mushroom gyro, makes use of a thin solid-state hemispherical shell, anchored by a thick stem. This shell is driven to a flexural resonance by electrostatic forces generated by electrodes which are deposited directly onto separate fused-quartz structures that surround the shell. Gyroscopic effect is obtained from the inertial property of the flexural standing waves.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

However, the dynamic inertia (from the gyroscopic reaction effect) from the gimbal provides negative spring stiffness proportional to the square of the spin speed (Howe and Savet, 1964; Lawrence, 1998). Therefore, at a particular speed, called the tuning speed, the two moments cancel each other, freeing the rotor from torque, a necessary condition for an ideal gyroscope.

===Ring laser gyroscope===
{{Main article|Ring laser gyroscope}}
A [[ring laser gyroscope]] relies on the [[Sagnac effect]] to measure rotation by measuring the shifting interference pattern of a beam split into two halves, as the two halves move around the ring in opposite directions.

When the [[Boeing 757]]-200 entered service in 1983, it was equipped with the first suitable ring laser gyroscope. This gyroscope took many years to develop, and the experimental models went through many changes before it was deemed ready for production by the engineers and managers of [[Honeywell]] and [[Boeing]]. It was an outcome of the competition with mechanical gyroscopes, which kept improving. The reason Honeywell, of all companies, chose to develop the laser gyro was that they were the only one that didn't have a successful line of mechanical gyroscopes, so they wouldn't be competing against themselves. The first problem they had to solve was that with laser gyros rotations below a certain minimum could not be detected at all, due to a problem called &quot;lock-in&quot;, whereby the two beams act like coupled oscillators and pull each other's frequencies toward convergence and therefore zero output. The solution was to shake the gyro rapidly so that it never settled into lock-in. Paradoxically, too regular of a dithering motion produced an accumulation of short periods of lock-in when the device was at rest at the extremities of its shaking motion. This was cured by applying a random [[white noise]] to the vibration. The material of the block was also changed from quartz to a new glass ceramic [[Cer-Vit]], made by [[Owens Corning]], because of helium leaks.&lt;ref&gt;Donald MacKenzie, ''Knowing Machines: Essays in Technical Change'', MIT Press, 1996, Chapter 4: ''From the Luminiferous Ether to the Boeing 757''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fiber optic gyroscope ===
{{Main article|Fibre optic gyroscope}}
A [[fiber optic gyroscope]] also uses the interference of light to detect mechanical rotation.  The two halves of the split beam travel in opposite directions in a coil of [[fiber optic]] cable as long as 5&amp;nbsp;km. Like the [[ring laser gyroscope]], it makes use of the [[Sagnac effect]].&lt;ref&gt;Hervé Lefèvre, ''The Fiber-Optic Gyroscope'', 1993, Artech House Optoelectronics Library, 1993, {{ISBN|0-89006-537-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== London moment ===
A [[London moment]] gyroscope relies on the quantum-mechanical phenomenon, whereby a spinning [[superconductor]] generates a [[magnetic field]] whose axis lines up exactly with the spin axis of the gyroscopic rotor. A magnetometer determines the orientation of the generated field, which is [[Interpolation|interpolated]] to determine the axis of rotation. Gyroscopes of this type can be extremely accurate and stable. For example, those used in the [[Gravity Probe B]] experiment measured changes in gyroscope spin axis orientation to better than 0.5 [[Minute of arc|milliarcseconds]] (1.4{{e|&amp;minus;7}} degrees, or about {{val|2.4|e=-9|u=radians}}) over a one-year period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://einstein.stanford.edu/content/fact_sheet/GPB_FactSheet-0405.pdf Einstein.stanford.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514044333/http://einstein.stanford.edu/content/fact_sheet/GPB_FactSheet-0405.pdf |date=14 May 2011 }}. &quot;The GP-B instrument is designed 
to measure changes in gyroscope spin axis orientation to better than 0.5 milliarcseconds (1.4x10-7 degrees) over a one-year period&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This is equivalent to an [[angular separation]] the width of a human hair viewed from {{convert|32|km|mi|sp=us}} away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/gravity_probe_b/GravityProbeB_20050400.pdf|title=Gravity Probe B – Extraordinary Technologies|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527111732/http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/gravity_probe_b/GravityProbeB_20050400.pdf|archivedate=27 May 2010|df=dmy-all|access-date=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GP-B gyro consists of a nearly-perfect spherical [[Moment of inertia#Rotational symmetry|rotating mass]] made of [[fused quartz]], which provides a [[dielectric]] support for a thin layer of [[niobium]] superconducting material. To eliminate friction found in conventional bearings, the rotor assembly is centered by the electric field from six electrodes. After the initial spin-up by a jet of helium which brings the rotor to 4,000 [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]], the polished gyroscope housing is evacuated to an ultra-high vacuum to further reduce drag on the rotor. Provided the suspension electronics remain powered, the extreme [[rotational symmetry]], lack of friction, and low drag will allow the angular momentum of the rotor to keep it spinning for about 15,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://einstein.stanford.edu/TECH/technology1.html#gyros|title=Gravity Probe B — Extraordinary Technologies|website=Einstein.stanford.edu|accessdate=5 November 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514043657/http://einstein.stanford.edu/TECH/technology1.html#gyros|archivedate=14 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sensitive [[SQUID#DC SQUID|DC SQUID]] that can discriminate changes as small as one quantum, or about 2 {{e|&amp;minus;15}} Wb, is used to monitor the gyroscope. A [[precession]], or tilt, in the orientation of the rotor causes the London moment magnetic field to shift relative to the housing. The moving field passes through a superconducting pickup loop fixed to the housing, inducing a small electric current. The current produces a voltage across a shunt resistance, which is resolved to spherical coordinates by a microprocessor. The system is designed to minimize Lorentz torque on the rotor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=44–45|title=Vortex Electronics and SQUIDs|first1=Takeshi|last1=Kobayashi|first2=Hisao|last2=Hayakawa|first3=Masayoshi|last3=Tonouchi|date=8 December 2003|isbn=9783540402312|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5mPeUu1i5R8C&amp;q=dc+squid+reduce+lorentz+force&amp;pg=PA44|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904042759/https://books.google.com/books?id=5mPeUu1i5R8C&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=dc+squid+reduce+lorentz+force&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Vgz9jQ-IyI&amp;sig=KN71efttIEUKdd63LWfmhO33p90&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wiuYVfHbK4vSoATv55OgDQ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dc%20squid%20reduce%20lorentz%20force&amp;f=false|archivedate=4 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234292394|title=DC electrostatic gyro suspension system for the Gravity Probe B experiment|website=ResearchGate|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705144927/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/234292394_DC_electrostatic_gyro_suspension_system_for_the_Gravity_Probe_B_experiment|archivedate=5 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumer electronics==
[[File:Digital Compass sensor and Arduino Uno.jpg|thumb|A digital gyroscope module connected to an [[Arduino Uno]] board]]
{{Main article|Accelerometer#Consumer electronics}}
In addition to being used in compasses, aircraft, computer pointing devices, etc., gyroscopes have been introduced into consumer electronics. The first usage or application of the gyroscope in consumer electronics was popularized by [[Steve Jobs]] in the Apple [[iPhone]]. 

Since the gyroscope allows the calculation of orientation and rotation, designers have incorporated them into modern technology. The integration of the gyroscope has allowed for more accurate recognition of movement within a 3D space than the previous lone accelerometer within a number of smartphones. Gyroscopes in consumer electronics are frequently combined with accelerometers (acceleration sensors) for more robust direction- and motion-sensing. Examples of such applications include smartphones such as the [[Samsung Galaxy Note 4]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samsung.com/global/microsite/galaxynote4/note4_specs.html|title=Samsung Galaxy and Gear - The Official Samsung Galaxy Site|website=The Official Samsung Galaxy Site|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216101103/http://www.samsung.com/global/microsite/galaxynote4/note4_specs.html|archivedate=16 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[HTC Titan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techstic.com/2011/10/htc-titan-specifications-and-features.html|title=HTC Titan Specifications and Features - Techstic|date=18 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003033741/http://techstic.com/2011/10/htc-titan-specifications-and-features.html|archivedate=3 October 2012|df=dmy-all|access-date=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nexus 5]], [[iPhone 5s]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siliconangle.com/blog/2013/11/01/nexus-5-vs-iphone-5s-head-to-head/|title=Nexus 5 vs iPhone 5s: Head-to-head - SiliconANGLE|date=1 November 2013|website=Siliconangle.com|accessdate=5 November 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213200443/http://siliconangle.com/blog/2013/11/01/nexus-5-vs-iphone-5s-head-to-head/|archivedate=13 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nokia 808 PureView]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_808_pureview-4577.php|title=Nokia 808 PureView - Full phone specifications|website=Gsmarena.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320160642/http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_808_pureview-4577.php|archivedate=20 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sony Xperia]], game console peripherals such as the [[Sixaxis|PlayStation 3 controller]] and the [[Wii Remote]], and virtual reality sets such as the [[Oculus Rift CV1|Oculus Rift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oculus.com/blog/building-a-sensor-for-low-latency-vr/|title=Blog — Building a Sensor for Low Latency VR|website=Oculus.com|accessdate=5 November 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150308221700/https://www.oculus.com/blog/building-a-sensor-for-low-latency-vr/|archivedate=8 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Military incompetence''' refers to incompetencies and failures of military organisations, whether through incompetent individuals or through a flawed institutional culture.

The effects of isolated cases of ''personal'' incompetence can be disproportionately significant in military organisations. Strict [[hierarchies]] of command provide the opportunity for a single decision to direct the work of thousands, whilst an [[institutional culture]] devoted to following orders without debate can help ensure that a bad or miscommunicated decision is implemented without being challenged or corrected.

However, the most common cases of &quot;military incompetence&quot; can be attributable to a flawed [[organisational culture]]. Perhaps the most marked of these is a [[Conservatism|conservative]] and traditionalist attitude, where innovative ideas or new technology are discarded or left untested. A tendency to believe that a problem can be solved by applying an earlier (failed) solution &quot;better&quot;, be that with more men, more firepower, or simply more zeal, is common. A strict hierarchical system often discourages the [[devolution]] of power to junior commanders, and can encourage [[micromanagement]] by senior officers.

The nature of warfare provides several factors which exacerbate these effects; the [[fog of war]] means that information about the enemy forces is often limited or inaccurate, making it easy for the [[military intelligence|intelligence process]] to interpret the information to agree with existing assumptions, or to fit it to their own preconceptions and expectations. Communications tend to deteriorate in battlefield situations, with the flow of information between commanders and combat units being disrupted, making it difficult to react to changes in the situation as they develop.

After operations have ceased, military organisations often fail to learn effectively from experience. In victory, whatever methods have been used{{emdash}}no matter how inefficient{{emdash}}appear to have been vindicated (see [[victory disease]]), whilst in defeat there is a tendency to select [[scapegoat]]s and to avoid looking in detail at the broader reasons for failure.

[[File:Temple St. bamboo scaffolding 2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bamboo scaffolding]] secured with lashings in [[Kowloon]].]]
A '''lashing''' is an arrangement of [[rope]], wire, or webbing with linking device used to secure and fasten two or more items together in a somewhat rigid manner. Lashings are most commonly applied to timber poles, and are commonly associated with cargo, containerisation, the [[Scouting]] movement, and [[sailor]]s.

This word usage derives from using [[whipcord]] to tie things together.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

It has been imagined that the first lashing made by humans was wrapping a few strips of bark around a stone to hold it to a tree branch to make an ax to hunt and build with.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In modern times, the same methods are used, but strips of bark and vines have been replaced with natural and synthetic fiber ropes. [[Scouting|Scout]]s and campers use lashings to build camp gadgets and improve their campsites for comfort and convenience, including the building of [[Raft|rafts]] for transport and [[Kon-Tiki_(Scouting)|competitive events]]. Lashings are also used in [[Pioneering (Scouting)|pioneering]],  the art of creating structures such as bridges and towers, using ropes and wooden spars.

&quot;'''The Gift of the Magi'''&quot; is a short story by [[O. Henry]] first published in 1905. The story tells of a young husband and wife and how they deal with the challenge of buying secret Christmas gifts for each other with very little money. As a sentimental story with a moral lesson about gift-giving, it has been popular for adaptation, especially for presentation at [[Christmas]] time. The plot and its [[twist ending]] are well-known, and the ending is generally considered an example of [[comic irony]]. It was allegedly written at [[Pete's Tavern]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on Irving Place in New York City.

The story was initially published in ''[[The New York World|The New York Sunday World]]'' under the title &quot;Gifts of the Magi&quot; on December 10, 1905. It was first published in book form in the O. Henry Anthology ''[[The Four Million]]'' in April 1906.

==Plot==
On [[Christmas Eve]], Della Young discovers that she has only $1.87 to buy a present for her husband Jim. She visits the nearby shop of a hairdresser, Madame Sofronie, who buys Della's long hair for $20. Della then uses the money to buy a [[platinum]] [[pocket watch]] chain for Jim. When Jim comes home from work that evening, Della admits to him that she sold her hair to buy him the chain. Jim gives Della her present-- a set of ornamental combs, which she will be unable to use until her hair grows back out. Della gives Jim the watch chain, and he tells her that he sold the watch to buy the combs. Although Jim and Della are left with gifts that they cannot use, they realize how far they are willing to go to show their love for each other and how priceless their love really is. The story ends with the narrator comparing these sacrificial gifts of love with those of the [[biblical Magi]].

'''William Sydney Porter''' (September 11, 1862 – June 5, 1910), better known by his pen name '''O. Henry''', was an American short story writer. 

Porter was born in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], and later moved to [[Texas]] in 1882. It was there that he met his wife, Athol Estes, with whom he had two children. In 1902, after the death of his wife, Porter moved to [[New York City|New York]], where he soon remarried. It was while he was in New York that Porter's most intensive writing period occurred, with Porter writing 381 short stories.

Porter's works include &quot;[[The Gift of the Magi]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Duplicity of Hargraves]]&quot;, and &quot;[[The Ransom of Red Chief]]&quot;. His stories are known for their surprise endings and witty narration. Porter also wrote poetry and non-fiction.

Porter's legacy includes the [[O. Henry Award]], an annual prize awarded to outstanding short stories. 

==Biography==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}

===Early life===
William Sidney Porter was born on September 11, 1862, in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]]. He changed the spelling of his middle name to Sydney in 1898. His parents were Algernon Sidney Porter (1825–88), a physician, and Mary Jane Virginia Swaim Porter (1833–65). William's parents had married on April 20, 1858. When William was three, his mother died after giving birth to her third child, and he and his father moved into the home of his paternal grandmother. As a child, Porter was always reading, everything from classics to [[dime novels]]; his favorite works were [[Edward William Lane|Lane]]'s translation of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' and [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Burton]]'s ''[[Anatomy of Melancholy]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;&gt;{{Cite EB1922|wstitle=Henry, O.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Porter graduated from his aunt Evelina Maria Porter's elementary school in 1876. He then enrolled at the Lindsey Street High School. His aunt continued to tutor him until he was 15. In 1879, he started working in his uncle's drugstore in Greensboro, and on August 30, 1881, at the age of 19, Porter was licensed as a pharmacist. At the drugstore, he also showed his natural artistic talents by sketching the townsfolk.

===Life in Texas===
[[File:William Sydney Porter as young man in Austin.jpg|thumb|Porter as a young man in Austin ]]

Porter traveled along with James K. Hall to Texas in March 1882, hoping that a change of air would help alleviate a persistent cough he had developed. He took up residence on the sheep ranch of Richard Hall, James Hall's son, in [[La Salle County, Texas|La Salle County]] and helped out as a shepherd, ranch hand, cook, and baby-sitter. While on the ranch, he learned bits of Spanish and German from the mix of immigrant ranch hands. He also spent time reading classic literature.

Porter's health did improve. He traveled with Richard to Austin, Texas in 1884, where he decided to remain and was welcomed into the home of Richard's friends, Joseph Harrell and his wife. Porter resided with the Harrells for three years. He went to work briefly for the Morley Brothers Drug Company as a pharmacist. Porter then moved on to work for the Harrell Cigar Store located in the [[Driskill Hotel]]. He also began writing as a sideline and wrote many of his early stories in the Harrell house.

As a young bachelor, Porter led an active social life in Austin. He was known for his wit, story-telling and musical talents. He played both the guitar and [[mandolin]]. He sang in the choir at [[St. David's Episcopal Church (Austin, Texas)|St. David's Episcopal Church]] and became a member of the &quot;Hill City Quartette&quot;, a group of young men who sang at gatherings and serenaded young women of the town.

[[File:Ohenry family 1890s.jpg|thumb|left| The Porter family, early 1890s – Athol, daughter Margaret, William ]]
Porter met and began [[courting]] Athol Estes, 17 years old and from a wealthy family. Historians believe Porter met Athol at the laying of the cornerstone of the [[Texas State Capitol]] on March 2, 1885. Her mother objected to the match because Athol was ill, suffering from [[tuberculosis]]. On July 1, 1887, Porter eloped with Athol and they were married in the parlor of the home of the Reverend R. K. Smoot, pastor of the [[Central Presbyterian Church (Austin, Texas)|Central Presbyterian Church]], where the Estes family attended church. The couple continued to participate in musical and theater groups, and Athol encouraged her husband to pursue his writing. Athol gave birth to a son in 1888, who died hours after birth, and then daughter Margaret Worth Porter in September 1889.

Porter's friend Richard Hall became Texas Land Commissioner and offered Porter a job. Porter started as a [[draftsman]] at the Texas General Land Office (GLO) on January 12, 1887, at a salary of $100 a month, drawing maps from surveys and fieldnotes. The salary was enough to support his family, but he continued his contributions to magazines and newspapers. In the [[General Land Office Building (Austin, Texas)|GLO building]], he began developing characters and plots for such stories as &quot;Georgia's Ruling&quot; (1900), and &quot;Buried Treasure&quot; (1908). The castle-like building he worked in was even woven into some of his tales such as &quot;Bexar Scrip No. 2692&quot; (1894). His job at the GLO was a political appointment by Hall. Hall ran for governor in the election of 1890 but lost. Porter resigned on January 21, 1891, the day after the new governor, [[Jim Hogg]], was sworn in.

[[Image:O henry at first national bank of austin.jpg|thumb|Porter as a clerk at the First National Bank in Austin, c. 1892 ]]
The same year, Porter began working at the First National Bank of Austin as a teller and bookkeeper at the same salary he had made at the GLO. The bank was operated informally, and Porter was apparently careless in keeping his books and may have [[embezzlement|embezzled]] funds. In 1894, he was accused by the bank of embezzlement and lost his job but was not indicted at the time.

He then worked full-time on his humorous weekly called ''The Rolling Stone'', which he started while working at the bank. ''The Rolling Stone'' featured satire on life, people, and politics and included Porter's short stories and sketches. Although eventually reaching a top circulation of 1,500, ''The Rolling Stone'' failed in April 1895 because the paper never provided an adequate income. However, his writing and drawings had caught the attention of the editor at the ''[[Houston Post]]''.

Porter and his family moved to Houston in 1895, where he started writing for the ''Post''. His salary was only $25 a month, but it rose steadily as his popularity increased. Porter gathered ideas for his column by loitering in hotel lobbies and observing and talking to people there. This was a technique he used throughout his writing career.

While he was in Houston, federal auditors audited the First National Bank of Austin and found the embezzlement shortages that led to his firing. A federal indictment followed, and he was arrested on charges of embezzlement.

===Flight and return===
[[File:William Sydney Porter.jpg|thumb|left|Porter in his thirties ]]
Porter's father-in-law posted bail to keep him out of jail. He was due to stand trial on July 7, 1896, but the day before, as he was changing trains to get to the courthouse, he got scared. He fled, first to New Orleans and later to Honduras, with which the United States had no extradition treaty at that time. Porter lived in Honduras for six months, until January 1897. There he became friends with [[Al Jennings]], a notorious train robber, who later wrote a book about their friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography: O. Henry|url=http://www.northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/631/entry/|work=North Carolina History|access-date=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He holed up in a [[Trujillo, Honduras|Trujillo]] hotel, where he wrote ''[[Cabbages and Kings (literature)|Cabbages and Kings]]'', in which he coined the term &quot;[[banana republic]]&quot; to qualify the country, a phrase subsequently used widely to describe a small, unstable tropical nation in Latin America with a narrowly focused, agrarian economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Malcolm D. MacLean |date=Summer 1968 |title=O. Henry in Honduras |journal=American Literary Realism, 1870–1910 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=36–46 |jstor=27747601 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Porter had sent Athol and Margaret back to Austin to live with Athol's parents. Unfortunately, Athol became too ill to meet Porter in Honduras as he had planned. When he learned that his wife was dying, Porter returned to Austin in February 1897 and surrendered to the court, pending trial. Athol Estes Porter died from tuberculosis (then known as consumption) on July 25, 1897.

Porter had little to say in his own defense at his trial and was found guilty on February 17, 1898, of embezzling $854.08. He was sentenced to five years in prison and imprisoned on March 25, 1898, at the [[Ohio Penitentiary]] in Columbus, Ohio. Porter was a licensed pharmacist and was able to work in the prison hospital as the night druggist. He was given his own room in the hospital wing, and there is no record that he actually spent time in the cell block of the prison. He had 14 stories published under various pseudonyms while he was in prison but was becoming best known as &quot;O. Henry&quot;, a pseudonym that first appeared over the story &quot;Whistling Dick's Christmas Stocking&quot; in the December 1899 issue of ''[[McClure's Magazine]]''. A friend of his in New Orleans would forward his stories to publishers so that they had no idea that the writer was imprisoned.

Porter was released on July 24, 1901, for good behavior after serving three years. He reunited with his daughter Margaret, now age 11, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where Athol's parents had moved after Porter's conviction.

===Later life and death===
Porter's most prolific writing period started in 1902, when he moved to New York City to be near his publishers. While there, he wrote 381 short stories. He wrote a story a week for over a year for the ''New York World Sunday Magazine''. His wit, characterization, and plot twists were adored by his readers but often panned by critics.

Porter married again in 1907 to childhood sweetheart Sarah (Sallie) Lindsey Coleman, whom he met again after revisiting his native state of North Carolina. Sarah Lindsey Coleman was herself a writer and wrote a romanticized and fictionalized version of their correspondence and courtship in her novella ''Wind of Destiny''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Current-Garcia|first1=Eugene|title=O. Henry: A Study of the Short Fiction|date=1993|publisher=Twayne Publishers, Macmillan Publishing Co.|location=New York City|isbn=0-8057-0859-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/ohenrystudyofsho00curr/page/123 123]|edition=First|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ohenrystudyofsho00curr/page/123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Porter was a heavy drinker, and by 1908, his markedly deteriorating health affected his writing. In 1909, Sarah left him, and he died on June 5, 1910, of [[cirrhosis of the liver]], complications of [[diabetes]], and an [[enlarged heart]]. After funeral services in New York City, he was buried in the [[Riverside Cemetery (Asheville, North Carolina)|Riverside Cemetery]] in [[Asheville, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=5cBHDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=o+henry+riverside&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiMiK22k5rlAhVBsZ4KHQ9yCRoQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=o%20henry%20riverside&amp;f=false ''Asheville's Riverside Cemetery'']&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter Margaret Worth Porter had a short writing career from 1913 to 1916. She married cartoonist Oscar Cesare of New York in 1916; they were divorced four years later. She died of tuberculosis in 1927 and was buried next to her father.

==Stories==
[[File:William Sydney Porter, Wiafs and Strays frontispiece.jpg|thumb|Portrait used as frontispiece in ''[[Waifs and Strays]]'' (posthumous, 1917) ]]
O. Henry's stories frequently have surprise endings. In his day he was called the American answer to [[Guy de Maupassant]]. While both authors wrote plot twist endings, O. Henry's stories were considerably more playful, and are also known for their witty narration.

Most of O. Henry's stories are set in his own time, the early 20th century. Many take place in New York City and deal for the most part with ordinary people: policemen, waitresses, etc.

O. Henry's work is wide-ranging, and his characters can be found roaming the cattle-lands of Texas, exploring the art of the con-man, or investigating the tensions of class and wealth in turn-of-the-century New York. O. Henry had an inimitable hand for isolating some element of society and describing it with an incredible economy and grace of language. Some of his best and least-known work is contained in ''[[Cabbages and Kings (literature)|Cabbages and Kings]]'', a series of stories each of which explores some individual aspect of life in a paralytically sleepy Central American town, while advancing some aspect of the larger plot and relating back one to another.

''Cabbages and Kings'' was his first collection of stories, followed by ''[[The Four Million]]''. The second collection opens with a reference to [[Ward McAllister]]'s &quot;assertion that there were only 'Four Hundred' people in New York City who were really worth noticing. But a wiser man has arisen—the census taker—and his larger estimate of human interest has been preferred in marking out the field of these little stories of the 'Four Million.{{'-}}&quot; To O. Henry, everyone in New York counted.

He had an obvious affection for the city, which he called &quot;Bagdad-on-the-Subway&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Henry, O. &quot;A Madison Square Arabian Night,&quot; from ''The Trimmed Lamp'': &quot;Oh, I know what to do when I see victuals coming toward me in little old Bagdad-on-the-Subway. I strike the asphalt three times with my forehead and get ready to spiel yarns for my supper. I claim descent from the late Tommy Tucker, who was forced to hand out vocal harmony for his pre-digested wheaterina and spoopju.&quot; [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext03/8tlmp11h.htm The Trimmed Lamp], Project Gutenberg text&lt;/ref&gt; and many of his stories are set there—while others are set in small towns or in other cities.

His final work was &quot;Dream&quot;, a short story intended for the magazine ''The Cosmopolitan'' but left incomplete at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Henry|first=O|title=Dream|url=http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/1466/|publisher=Read Book Online website|access-date=April 22, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019001654/http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/1466/|archive-date=October 19, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his most famous stories are:
* &quot;[[The Gift of the Magi]]&quot; is about a young couple, Jim and Della, who are short of money but desperately want to buy each other Christmas gifts. Unbeknownst to Jim, Della sells her most valuable possession, her beautiful hair, in order to buy a platinum fob chain for Jim's watch; while unbeknownst to Della, Jim sells his own most valuable possession, his watch, to buy jeweled combs for Della's hair. The essential premise of this story has been copied, re-worked, parodied, and otherwise re-told countless times in the century since it was written.
* &quot;[[The Ransom of Red Chief]]&quot; in which two men kidnap a boy of ten. The boy turns out to be so bratty and obnoxious that the desperate men ultimately pay the boy's father $250 to take him back.
* &quot;[[The Cop and the Anthem]]&quot; about a New York City hobo named Soapy who sets out to get arrested so that he can be a guest of the city jail instead of sleeping out in the cold winter. Despite efforts at petty theft, vandalism, disorderly conduct, and &quot;flirting&quot; with a young prostitute, Soapy fails to draw the attention of the police. Disconsolate, he pauses in front of a church, where an organ anthem inspires him to clean up his life; ironically, he is charged for [[loitering]] and sentenced to three months in prison.
* &quot;[[A Retrieved Reformation]]&quot; which tells the tale of safecracker Jimmy Valentine, recently freed from prison. He goes to a town bank to case it before he robs it. As he walks to the door, he catches the eye of the banker's beautiful daughter. They immediately fall in love and Valentine decides to give up his criminal career. He moves into the town, taking up the identity of Ralph Spencer, a shoemaker. Just as he is about to leave to deliver his specialized tools to an old associate, a lawman who recognizes him arrives at the bank. Jimmy and his fiancée and her family are at the bank, inspecting a new safe when a child accidentally gets locked inside the airtight vault. Knowing it will seal his fate, Valentine opens the safe to rescue the child. However, much to Valentine's surprise, the lawman denies recognizing him and lets him go.
* &quot;[[The Duplicity of Hargraves]]&quot; is a short story about a nearly destitute father and daughter's trip to Washington, D.C.
* &quot;[[The Cisco Kid|The Caballero's Way]]&quot; in which Porter's most famous character, the Cisco Kid, is introduced. It was first published in 1907 in the July issue of ''Everybody's Magazine'' and collected in the book ''Heart of the West'' that same year. In later film and TV depictions, the Kid would be portrayed as a dashing adventurer, perhaps skirting the edges of the law, but primarily on the side of the angels. In the original short story, the only story by Porter to feature the character, the Kid is a murderous, ruthless border desperado, whose trail is dogged by a heroic Texas Ranger. The twist ending is, unusually for Porter, tragic.

==Pen name==
Porter used a number of pen names (including &quot;O. Henry&quot; or &quot;Olivier Henry&quot;) in the early part of his writing career; other names included S.H. Peters, James L. Bliss, T.B. Dowd, and Howard Clark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Porter, William Sydney (O. Henry)|website=Ncpedia.org|url=http://ncpedia.org/biography/porter-william-sydney-o}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the name &quot;O. Henry&quot; seemed to garner the most attention from editors and the public, and was used exclusively by Porter for his writing by about 1902. He gave various explanations for the origin of his pen name.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davenport&quot;&gt;Guy Davenport, ''The Hunter Gracchus and Other Papers on Literature and Art'', Washington, D.C.: Counterpoint, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909 he gave an interview to ''The New York Times'', in which he gave an account of it:

{{quote|It was during these New Orleans days that I adopted my pen name of O. Henry. I said to a friend: &quot;I'm going to send out some stuff. I don't know if it amounts to much, so I want to get a literary alias. Help me pick out a good one.&quot; He suggested that we get a newspaper and pick a name from the first list of notables that we found in it. In the society columns we found the account of a fashionable ball. &quot;Here we have our notables,&quot; said he. We looked down the list and my eye lighted on the name Henry, &quot;That'll do for a last name,&quot; said I. &quot;Now for a first name. I want something short. None of your three-syllable names for me.&quot; &quot;Why don't you use a plain initial letter, then?&quot; asked my friend. &quot;Good,&quot; said I, &quot;O is about the easiest letter written, and O it is.&quot;

A newspaper once wrote and asked me what the O stands for. I replied, &quot;O stands for Olivier, the French for Oliver.&quot; And several of my stories accordingly appeared in that paper under the name Olivier Henry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/04/04/101735840.pdf &quot;'O. Henry' on Himself, Life, and Other Things&quot;] (PDF), ''New York Times'', April 4, 1909, p. SM9.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[William Trevor]] writes in the introduction to ''The World of O. Henry: Roads of Destiny and Other Stories'' (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1973) that &quot;there was a prison guard named Orrin Henry&quot; in the Ohio State Penitentiary &quot;whom William Sydney Porter ... immortalised as O. Henry&quot;.

According to J. F. Clarke, it is from the name of the French pharmacist Etienne Ossian Henry, whose name is in the ''[[U.S. Dispensary]]'' which Porter used working in the prison pharmacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clarke&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pseudonyms|author=Joseph F. Clarke|publisher=BCA|date=1977|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer and scholar [[Guy Davenport]] offers his own hypothesis: &quot;The pseudonym that he began to write under in prison is constructed from the first two letters of ''Ohio'' and the second and last two of ''penitentiary''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davenport&quot;/&gt;

== Legacy ==
The [[O. Henry Award]] is a prestigious annual prize named after Porter and given to outstanding short stories.

A film was made in 1952 featuring five stories, called ''[[O. Henry's Full House]]''. The episode garnering the most critical acclaim&lt;ref&gt;[[Bosley Crowther|Crowther, Bosley]] (October 17, 1952). &quot;[https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9906E0DF103AE23BBC4F52DFB6678389649EDE THE SCREEN IN REVIEW; Four O.

Retrieved November 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; was &quot;The Cop and the Anthem&quot; starring [[Charles Laughton]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]]. The other stories are &quot;The Clarion Call&quot;, &quot;[[The Last Leaf]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Ransom of Red Chief]]&quot; (starring [[Fred Allen]] and [[Oscar Levant]]), and &quot;[[The Gift of the Magi]]&quot;.

In the ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[fictional universe]], '''shields''' refer to a 23rd and 24th century technology that provides [[starship]]s, [[space station]]s, and entire planets with limited protection against damage. They are sometimes referred to as ''deflectors'', ''[[deflector shield]]s'', and ''screens'' (the latter during ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'').

== History ==
The term 'shields' first appears in the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode &quot;[[Balance of Terror (TOS episode)|Balance of Terror]]&quot;, in which they were deployed, albeit to little effect, by a [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] outpost under attack from a [[Romulan]] [[Romulan#Technology|Warbird]].  The first depicted use by a starship was in the ''Star Trek'' episode &quot;[[Arena (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Arena]]&quot;, in which the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] raises its 'screens' after being attacked by an alien warship although the term 'shields' is not used in this episode.  Shields are not mentioned during the earlier seasons of the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' series, starships instead using &quot;polarized hull plating&quot; to make their hull more resistant to damage.

==Design==
Like most technologies in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[fictional universe]], the exact operation of shield technology is never precisely described. Characters discuss its existence and manipulation, while only superficially describing its exact physics, which result in a field being projected around a ship or other body, deflecting or dispersing projectiles and energy weapons.  Shields are not shown unless struck, and are then often shown briefly for dramatic effect as a translucent bubble of energy.

Shields are said to be made of a screen of [[Graviton|gravitons]] that can deflect beam and projectile weaponry.

''[[The Making of Star Trek]]'' states that shields are [[force fields]] similar in nature to the navigational deflector, while ''[[Mr. Scott's Guide to the Enterprise]]'' further states that shields on post-refit Constitution-class vessels - of which the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' is an example - were generated by the subatomic scan and replication of an alloy known as diburnium-osmium, and then projected as a force field beyond a ship's hull along the shield grid. In &quot;[[That Which Survives]]&quot;, the alloy of diburnium and osmium is stated to be the hardest alloy known to the Federation.

Shields can be weakened by attack, and are often shown to collapse after prolonged bombardment.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Q Who? (TNG episode)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Shields may be unable to repel certain types of weapons; the phased polaron weapons used by the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]] - one of the primary antagonists of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' - are initially unhindered by the shields of Starfleet ships.

The [[USS Defiant|USS ''Defiant'']], introduced in the third season of ''Deep Space Nine'', was said to use [[ablative armor]] in addition to shields; this technology also appeared in the alternate time line of the early 25th century shown in the ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' series finale &quot;[[Endgame (Star Trek: Voyager)|Endgame]]&quot;, where it withstood repeated assaults by Borg weaponry and tractor beams.

In 2008, ''[[Cosmos Magazine]]'' reported on research into creating an artificial replica of [[Earth's magnetic field]] around a spacecraft to protect astronauts from [[health threat from cosmic rays]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/news/2285/star-trek-style-starship-shields-could-become-reality ''Cosmos Online - Star Trek-style shields could become reality''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212214802/http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/news/2285/star-trek-style-starship-shields-could-become-reality |date=2008-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; British and Portuguese scientists used a mathematical simulation to prove that it would be possible to create a &quot;mini-magnetosphere&quot; bubble several hundred meters wide, possibly generated by a small unmanned vessel that could accompany a future NASA mission to Mars.

'''Georges Perec''' (born George Peretz) ({{IPA-fr|peʁɛk, pɛʁɛk|lang}};&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Davidson, ''Reading Style: A Life in Sentences'', Columbia University Press, 2014, p. 107: &quot;I have an almost Breton name which everyone spells as Pérec or Perrec—my name isn't written exactly as it is pronounced.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 7 March 1936 – 3 March 1982) was a French [[novelist]], [[filmmaker]], [[documentalist]], and [[essayist]].  He was a member of the [[Oulipo]] group. His father died as a soldier early in the [[Second World War]] and his mother was murdered in [[the Holocaust]], and many of his works deal with absence, loss, and identity, often through [[word play]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bellos1993&quot; /&gt;

==Early life==
Born in a working-class district of Paris, Perec was the only son of Icek Judko and Cyrla (Schulewicz) Peretz, Polish Jews who had emigrated to France in the 1920s. He was a distant relative of the [[Yiddish]] writer [[Isaac Leib Peretz]]. Perec's father, who enlisted in the French Army during World War II, died in 1940 from untreated gunfire or shrapnel wounds, and his mother perished in the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]], probably in [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] sometime after 1943. Perec was taken into the care of his paternal aunt and uncle in 1942, and in 1945, he was formally adopted by them.

==Career==
Perec started writing reviews and essays for ''[[Nouvelle Revue Française|La Nouvelle Revue française]]'' and ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Les Lettres nouvelles|fr}}'', prominent literary publications, while studying history and [[sociology]] at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. In 1958/59 Perec served in the army as a [[paratrooper]] (XVIIIe Régiment de Chasseurs Parachutistes), and married Paulette Petras after being discharged. They spent one year (1960/1961) in [[Sfax]], Tunisia, where Paulette worked as a teacher; these experiences are reflected in ''[[Things: A Story of the Sixties]]'', which is about a young Parisian couple who also spend a year in Sfax.

In 1961 Perec began working at the Neurophysiological Research Laboratory in the unit's research library funded by the [[CNRS]] and attached to the [[Hôpital Saint-Antoine]] as an [[archivist]], a low-paid position which he retained until 1978. A few reviewers have noted that the daily handling of records and varied data may have had an influence on his literary style. In any case, Perec's work on the reassessment of the academic journals under subscription was influenced by a talk about the handling of scientific information given by [[Eugene Garfield]] in Paris and he was introduced to [[Marshall McLuhan]] by [[Jean Duvignaud]]. Perec's other major influence was the [[Oulipo]], which he joined in 1967, meeting [[Raymond Queneau]], among others. Perec dedicated his masterpiece, ''La Vie mode d'emploi'' (''[[Life: A User's Manual]]'') to Queneau, who died before it was published.

Perec began working on a series of [[radio play]]s with his translator Eugen Helmle and the musician {{Interlanguage link multi|Philippe Drogoz|de}} in the late 60s; less than a decade later, he was making films. His first work, based on his novel ''[[A Man Asleep|Un Homme qui dort]]'', was co-[[Film director|direct]]ed by {{Interlanguage link multi|Bernard Queysanne|fr}}, and won him the [[Prix Jean Vigo]] in 1974. Perec also created [[crossword]] puzzles for ''[[Le Point]]'' from 1976 on.

''La Vie mode d'emploi'' (1978) brought Perec some financial and critical success—it won the [[Prix Médicis]]—and allowed him to turn to writing full-time. He was a [[writer-in-residence]] at the [[University of Queensland]], Australia, in 1981 during which time he worked on ''53 Jours'' (''53 Days''), which he would not finish. Shortly after his return from Australia, his health deteriorated. A heavy smoker, he was diagnosed with lung cancer. He died the following year in [[Ivry-sur-Seine]] at age 45, four days shy of his 46h birthday; his ashes are held at the [[columbarium]] of the [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]].

==Work==
Many of Perec's novels and essays abound with experimental [[word play]], lists and attempts at [[Categorization|classification]], and they are usually tinged with [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]].

Perec's first novel ''Les Choses: Une Histoire des Années Soixante'' (''[[Things: A Story of the Sixties]]'') (1965) was awarded the [[Prix Renaudot]].

Perec's most famous novel ''La Vie mode d'emploi'' (''[[Life: A User's Manual]]'') was published in 1978.  Its title page describes it as &quot;novels&quot;, in the plural, the reasons for which become apparent on reading. ''La Vie mode d'emploi'' is a tapestry of interwoven stories and ideas as well as literary and historical allusions, based on the lives of the inhabitants of a fictitious Parisian apartment block. It was written according to a complex plan of writing constraints, and is primarily constructed from several elements, each adding a layer of complexity. The 99 chapters of his 600-page novel move like a knight's tour of a chessboard around the room plan of the building, describing the rooms and stairwell and telling the stories of the inhabitants. At the end, it is revealed that the whole book actually takes place in a single moment, with a final twist that is an example of &quot;cosmic irony&quot;. It was translated into English by [[David Bellos]] in 1987.

Perec is noted for his [[constrained writing]].  His 300-page novel ''La disparition'' (1969) is a [[lipogram]], written with natural sentence structure and correct grammar, but using only words that do not contain the letter &quot;e&quot;.  It has been translated into English by [[Gilbert Adair]] under the title ''[[A Void]]'' (1994). His novella ''Les revenentes'' (1972) is a complementary [[univocalic]] piece in which the letter &quot;e&quot; is the only vowel used. This constraint affects even the title, which would conventionally be spelt ''Reven'''a'''ntes''. An English translation by [[Ian Monk]] was published in 1996 as ''The Exeter Text: Jewels, Secrets, Sex'' in the collection ''Three''. It has been remarked by [[Jacques Roubaud]] that these two novels draw words from two [[disjoint sets]] of the French language, and that a third novel would be possible, made from the words not used so far (those containing both &quot;e&quot; and a vowel other than &quot;e&quot;).

''W ou le souvenir d'enfance'', (''[[W, or the Memory of Childhood]]'', 1975) is a semi-autobiographical work which is hard to classify. Two alternating narratives make up the volume: one, a fictional outline of a remote island country called &quot;W&quot;, at first appears to be a [[utopia]]n society modeled on the [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] ideal, but is gradually exposed as a horrifying, [[totalitarian]] prison much like a [[concentration camp]]. The second narrative is a description of Perec's own childhood during and after World War II. Both narratives converge towards the end, highlighting the common theme of [[the Holocaust]].

&quot;Cantatrix sopranica L. Scientific Papers&quot; is a spoof scientific paper detailing experiments on the &quot;yelling reaction&quot; provoked in sopranos by pelting them with rotten tomatoes. All the references in the paper are multi-lingual [[pun]]s and jokes, e.g. &quot;([[Charybdis|Karybb]] &amp; [[Scylla|Szyla]], 1973)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pianotype.net/doc/tomatotopic.htm &quot;Mise en évidence expérimentale d'une organisation tomatotopique chez la soprano (''Cantatrix sopranica L.'')&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223144638/http://www.pianotype.net/doc/tomatotopic.htm |date=23 December 2011 }} {{in lang|fr}}&lt;br /&gt;[http://pauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy/stuff/tomato/tomato.html &quot;Experimental demonstration of the tomatotopic organization in the Soprano (''Cantatrix sopranica L.'')&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Bellos]], who has translated several of Perec's works, wrote an extensive biography of Perec: ''[[Georges Perec: A Life in Words]]'', which won the [[Académie Goncourt]]'s ''bourse'' for biography in 1994.

The Association Georges Perec has extensive archives on the author in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.associationgeorgesperec.fr|title=Association Georges Perec}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 Perec's initially rejected novel ''Gaspard pas mort'' (Gaspard not dead), which was believed to be lost, was found by David Bellos amongst papers in the house of Perec's friend {{Interlanguage link multi|Alain Guérin|fr}}.  The novel was reworked several times and retitled ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Le Condottière|fr}}''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookforum.com/archive/dec_05/gibbons.html &quot;The Letter Vanishes&quot;] by James Gibbons, ''[[Bookforum]]'', December/January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and published in 2012; its English translation by Bellos followed in 2014 as ''Portrait of a Man'' after the [[Commons:Category:Portrait of a Man - Antonello da Messina - Louvre MI 693|1475 painting of that name]] by [[Antonello da Messina]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2015/apr/08/georges-perec-lost-novel/ &quot;Georges Perec's Lost Novel&quot;] by [[David Bellos]], ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', 8 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The initial title borrows the name Gaspard from the [[Paul Verlaine]] poem &quot;Gaspar Hauser Chante&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bellos1993&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=David Bellos|authorlink=David Bellos|title=Georges Perec: A Life in Words : a Biography|url=https://archive.org/details/georgespereclife0000bell|url-access=registration|year=1993|publisher=D.R. Godine|isbn=978-0-87923-980-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/georgespereclife0000bell/page/108 108]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and characters named &quot;Gaspard&quot; appear in both ''[[W, or the Memory of Childhood]]'' and ''[[Life: A User's Manual]]'', while in ''MICRO-TRADUCTIONS, 15 variations discrètes sur un poème connu'' he creatively re-writes the Verlaine poem 15 times.

==Honours==
[[Asteroid]] [[2817 Perec|no. 2817]], discovered in 1982, was named after Perec. In 1994, a street in the [[20th arrondissement of Paris]] was named after him, {{Interlanguage link multi|rue Georges-Perec|fr}}. The [[La Poste (France)|French postal service]] issued a stamp in 2002 in his honour; it was designed by [[Marc Taraskoff]] and engraved by [[Pierre Albuisson]]. For his work, Perec won the Prix Renaudot in 1965, the Prix Jean Vigo in 1974, the Prix Médicis in 1978. He was featured as a [[Google Doodle]] on his 80th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/georges-perecs-80th-birthday|title=Georges Perec’s 80th Birthday|website=www.google.com|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

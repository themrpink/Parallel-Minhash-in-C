The diagrammed position might appear roughly equal, because each side has a king and three pawns, and the positions of the kings are about equal. In truth, White wins this endgame on the strength of the protected passed pawn, regardless which player moves first. The black king cannot be on both sides of the board at once&amp;nbsp;– to defend the isolated h-pawn and to stop White's c-pawn from advancing to promotion. Thus White can capture the h-pawn and then win the game {{harvcol|Fine|Benko|2003|p=56}}.

}}
After a capture with a pawn, a player may end up with two pawns on the same {{chessgloss|file}}, called ''[[doubled pawns]]''. Doubled pawns are substantially weaker than pawns which are side by side, because they cannot defend each other, they usually cannot both be defended by adjacent pawns, and the front pawn blocks the advance of the back one. In the diagram, Black is playing at a strategic disadvantage due to the doubled c-pawns.

There are situations where doubled pawns confer some advantage, typically when the guarding of consecutive squares in a file by the pawns prevents an invasion by the opponent's pieces.

Pawns which are both doubled and isolated are typically a tangible weakness. A single piece or pawn in front of doubled isolated pawns blocks both of them, and cannot be easily dislodged. It is rare for a player to have three pawns in a file, i.e. ''tripled'' pawns.

===Wrong rook pawn===
{{Main article|Wrong rook pawn}}
In chess endgames with a bishop, a {{chessgloss|rook pawn}} may be the ''[[wrong rook pawn]]'', depending on the square-color of the bishop. This causes some positions to be [[draw (chess)|draws]] that would otherwise be wins.

==History==
The pawn has its origins in the oldest version of chess, [[chaturanga]], and it is present in all other significant versions of the game as well. In chaturanga, this piece moved directly forward, capturing to the sides (one square diagonally forward to the left or right).

In medieval chess, an attempt was made to make the pieces more interesting, each file's pawn being given the name of a commoner's occupation. On the board, from left to right, those titles were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C001348/international/pieces/his_pieces_en.html |title=The history of the chess pieces |publisher=Library.thinkquest.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201114823/http://library.thinkquest.org/C001348/international/pieces/his_pieces_en.html |archive-date=2012-12-01 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Gambler and other &quot;lowlifes&quot;, also messengers (in the left-most file, that direction being literally [[wikt:sinister|sinister]])
*City guard or policeman (in front of a knight, as they trained city guards in real life)&lt;ref&gt;[http://toutfait.com/duchamp.jsp?postid=919&amp;keyword= The Bachelors: Pawns in Duchamp's Great Game] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313130903/http://toutfait.com/duchamp.jsp?postid=919&amp;keyword= |date=March 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Innkeeper (bishop)
*Doctor (always the queen's pawn)
*Merchant/Moneychanger (always before the king, whether or not he is to the left or right of the queen, which depends on the color of the pieces)
*Weaver/Clerk (in front of the bishop, for whom they wove or clericked)
*Blacksmith (in front of a knight, as they care for the horses)
*Worker/Farmer (in front of a castle, for which they worked)&lt;ref name=&quot;The United States Chess Federation&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://main.uschess.org/content/view/7001/132 |title=The United States Chess Federation |publisher=Main.uschess.org |date=2013-01-23 |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous example of this is found in the second book ever printed in the English language, ''[[The Game and Playe of the Chesse]]''. Purportedly, this book, printed by [[William Caxton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20393/20393-h/20393-h.htm |title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of A Short History of English Printing, by Henry R. Plomer |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=2007-01-18 |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; was viewed to be as much a political commentary on society as a chess book.&lt;ref name=&quot;The United States Chess Federation&quot;/&gt; 

The ability to move two spaces, and the related ability to capture ''en passant'', were introduced in 15th-century Europe (see ''[[En passant]]'' § [[En passant#Historical context|Historical context]]). The rule for promotion has changed through history (see [[Promotion (chess)#History of the rule|History of the promotion rule]]).

===Etymology and word usage===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
[[File:Peter Newell - Through the looking glass and what Alice found there 1902 - page 12.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Illustration by [[Peter Newell]]. &quot;The chessmen were walking about, two and two!&quot; (''[[Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There]]'' by [[Lewis Carroll]], 1871). Most of the main characters are represented as chess pieces in the chess-themed story, with [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]], the main protagonist, represented as a pawn.]]

Although the name origin of most other chess pieces is obvious, the etymology of ''pawn'' is fairly obscure. It is derived from the Old French word ''paon'', which comes from the Medieval Latin term for &quot;foot soldier&quot; and is cognate with ''[[peon]]''. In most other languages, the word for pawn is similarly derived from ''paon'', its Latin ancestor or some other word for [[foot soldier]]. In some languages the pawn is named after a term for &quot;peasant&quot; or &quot;farmer&quot;, reflecting how the lower orders were conscripted as footsoldiers in wartime: Hungarian ''paraszt'', Slovene ''kmet'', German ''Bauer'', Danish/Norwegian/Swedish ''bonde'', Latvian ''bandinieks''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DoqUoDGPU6gC&amp;q=bandinieks+latvian&amp;pg=PA211 |title = Latvian-English Dictionary: Volume I A - M|isbn = 9781477163108|last1 = Zusne|first1 = Leonard|date = 2008-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Irish, the term ''fichillín'', a [[diminutive]] of ''ficheall'' (&quot;chess&quot;) is sometimes used, though the term &quot;ceithearnach&quot; (&quot;foot soldier&quot;) is also used. In Thai the pawn is called เบี้ย (''bîia''), which signifies a [[cowrie]] shell or a coin of little value. In Turkish the pawn is called ''piyon'', borrowed from the French word [[:fr:Pion|Pion]] in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century.

''Pawn'' is often taken to mean &quot;one who is easily manipulated&quot; or &quot;one who is sacrificed for a larger purpose&quot;. Because the pawn is the weakest piece, it is often used metaphorically to indicate unimportance or outright disposability; for example, &quot;She's only a pawn in their game.&quot;

==Quotations==
*&quot;The pawn is the soul of chess. ... the Pawns. They are the very Life of the Game. They alone form the Attack and the Defense; on their good or bad Situation depends the Gain or Loss of the Party.&quot; [[François-André Danican Philidor]], 1749 {{harvcol|Euwe|Hooper|1959|p=1}}.

==Unicode==
{{main article|Chess symbols in Unicode}}
[[Unicode]] defines two codepoints for a pawn:

{{distinguish|Yarkovsky–O'Keefe–Radzievskii–Paddack effect}}
The '''Yarkovsky effect''' is a [[Force (physics)|force]] acting on a rotating body in space caused by the [[anisotropic]] emission of [[heat|thermal]] [[photon]]s, which carry [[momentum]]. It is usually considered in relation to [[meteoroid]]s or small [[asteroid]]s (about 10&amp;nbsp;cm to 10&amp;nbsp;km in diameter), as its influence is most significant for these bodies.

==History of discovery==
The effect was discovered by the [[Poland|Polish]]-Russian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=George |last=Beekman |title=The nearly forgotten scientist John Osipovich Yarkovsky |journal=Journal of the British Astronomical Association |volume=115 |issue=4 |pages=207 |year=2005 |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2005JBAA..115..207B }}&lt;/ref&gt; civil engineer [[Ivan Osipovich Yarkovsky]] (1844&amp;ndash;1902), who worked in Russia on scientific problems in his spare time. Writing in a pamphlet around the year 1900, Yarkovsky noted that the daily heating of a rotating object in space would cause it to experience a force that, while tiny, could lead to large long-term effects in the orbits of small bodies, especially [[meteoroid]]s and small [[asteroid]]s. Yarkovsky's insight would have been forgotten had it not been for the [[Estonia]]n astronomer [[Ernst J. Öpik]] (1893&amp;ndash;1985), who read Yarkovsky's pamphlet sometime around 1909. Decades later, Öpik, recalling the pamphlet from memory, discussed the possible importance of the Yarkovsky effect on movement of meteoroids about the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=E. J. |last=Öpik |title=Collision probabilities with the planets and the distribution of interplanetary matter |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy |volume=54A |issue= |pages=165–199 |year=1951 |jstor=20488532 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
The Yarkovsky effect is a consequence of the fact that change in the temperature of an object warmed by radiation (and therefore the intensity of thermal radiation from the object) lags behind changes in the incoming radiation. That is, the surface of the object takes time to become warm when first illuminated, and takes time to cool down when illumination stops. In general there are two components to the effect:

* '''Diurnal''' effect: On a rotating body illuminated by the Sun (e.g. an asteroid or the Earth), the surface is warmed by solar radiation during the day, and cools at night. Due to the thermal properties of the surface, there is a lag between the absorption of radiation from the Sun, and the emission of that same radiation as heat, so the warmest point on a rotating body occurs around the &quot;2 PM&quot; site on the surface, or slightly after noon. This results in a difference between the directions of absorption and re-emission of radiation, which yields a net force along the direction of motion of the orbit. If the object is a [[direct motion|prograde]] rotator, the force is in the direction of motion of the orbit, and causes the [[semi-major axis]] of the orbit to increase steadily; the object spirals away from the Sun. A [[retrograde motion|retrograde]] rotator spirals inward. The diurnal effect is the dominant component for bodies with diameter greater than about 100 m.&lt;ref name=Bottke06review&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bottke, Jr. |first=William F. |title=The Yarkovsky and YORP Effects: Implications for Asteroid Dynamics |journal=[[Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|Annu. Rev. Earth Planet. Sci.]] |volume=34 |pages=157–191 |year=2006 |doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.34.031405.125154 |bibcode = 2006AREPS..34..157B |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Seasonal''' effect: This is easiest to understand for the idealised case of a non-rotating body orbiting the Sun, for which each &quot;year&quot; consists of exactly one &quot;day&quot;. As it travels around its orbit, the &quot;dusk&quot; hemisphere which has been heated over a long preceding time period is invariably in the direction of orbital motion. The excess of thermal radiation in this direction causes a braking force that always causes spiraling inward toward the Sun. In practice, for rotating bodies, this seasonal effect increases along with the [[axial tilt]]. It dominates only if the diurnal effect is small enough. This may occur because of very rapid rotation (no time to cool off on the night side, hence an almost uniform [[longitude|longitudinal]] temperature distribution), small size (the whole body is heated throughout) or an axial tilt close to 90°. The seasonal effect is more important for smaller asteroid fragments (from a few metres up to about 100 m), provided their surfaces are not covered by an insulating [[regolith]] layer and they do not have exceedingly slow rotations. Additionally, on very long timescales over which the spin axis of the body may be repeatedly changed due to collisions (and hence also the direction of the diurnal effect changes), the seasonal effect will also tend to dominate.&lt;ref name=Bottke06review /&gt;

In general, the effect is size-dependent, and will affect the semi-major axis of smaller asteroids, while leaving large asteroids practically unaffected. For kilometre-sized asteroids, the Yarkovsky effect is minuscule over short periods: the force on asteroid [[6489 Golevka]] has been estimated at about 0.25 [[newton (unit)|newtons]], for a net acceleration of 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;12&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. But it is steady; over millions of years an asteroid's orbit can be perturbed enough to transport it from the [[asteroid belt]] to the inner Solar System.

The mechanism is more complicated for bodies in strongly [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentric]] orbits.

==Measurement==
The effect was first measured in 1991–2003 on the asteroid [[6489 Golevka]]. The asteroid drifted 15&amp;nbsp;km from its predicted position over twelve years (the orbit was established with great precision by a series of radar observations in 1991, 1995 and 1999 from the [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo]] radio telescope).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chesley |first=Steven R. |title=Direct Detection of the Yarkovsky Effect via Radar Ranging to Asteroid 6489 Golevka |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=302 |issue=5651 |pages=1739–1742 |year=2003 |doi=10.1126/science.1091452 |bibcode = 2003Sci...302.1739C |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without direct measurement, it is very hard to predict the exact result of the Yarkovsky effect on a given asteroid's orbit. This is because the magnitude of the effect depends on many variables that are hard to determine from the limited observational information that is available. These include the exact shape of the asteroid, its orientation, and its [[albedo]]. Calculations are further complicated by the effects of shadowing and thermal &quot;reillumination&quot;, whether caused by local craters or a possible overall concave shape. The Yarkovsky effect also competes with [[radiation pressure]], whose net effect may cause similar small long-term forces for bodies with albedo variations or non-spherical shapes.

As an example, even for the simple case of the pure seasonal Yarkovsky effect on a spherical body in a circular orbit with 90° [[obliquity]], semi-major axis changes could differ by as much as a factor of two between the case of a uniform albedo and the case of a strong north/south albedo asymmetry. Depending on the object's orbit and [[Rotation|spin axis]], the Yarkovsky change of the semi-major axis may be reversed simply by changing from a spherical to a non-spherical shape.

Despite these difficulties, utilizing the Yarkovsky effect is one scenario under investigation to alter the course of potentially Earth-impacting [[near-Earth object|near-Earth asteroid]]s. Possible [[asteroid deflection strategies]] include &quot;painting&quot; the surface of the asteroid or focusing solar radiation onto the asteroid to alter the intensity of the Yarkovsky effect and so alter the orbit of the asteroid away from a collision with Earth.&lt;ref&gt;http://tamutimes.tamu.edu/2013/02/21/asteroids-no-match-for-paint-gun-says-prof/&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[OSIRIS-REx]] mission, launched in September 2016, studies the Yarkovsky effect on [[101955 Bennu|asteroid Bennu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asteroidmission.org/qa/ OSIRIS-REx - Q &amp; A]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Llywelyn ap Gruffudd''' (c. 1223 &amp;ndash; 11 December 1282), sometimes written as '''Llywelyn ap Gruffydd''', also known as '''Llywelyn the Last''' ({{lang-cy|Llywelyn Ein Llyw Olaf|lit=Llywelyn, Our Last Leader}}), was Prince of Wales ({{lang-la|Princeps Walliae|links=no}}; {{lang-cy|Tywysog Cymru|links=no}}) from 1258 until his death at [[Cilmeri]] in 1282. The son of [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn Fawr]] and grandson of [[Llywelyn the Great]], he was the last sovereign prince of [[Wales]] before its [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I|conquest]] by [[Edward I of England]].

==Genealogy and early life==
Llywelyn was the second of the four sons of [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn Fawr|Gruffydd]], the eldest son of [[Llywelyn the Great]], and [[Senana ferch Caradog]], the daughter of Caradoc ap Thomas ap Rhodri, [[Lord of Anglesey]].{{#tag:ref|According to several non-contemporary Welsh genealogical tracts, the mother of Llywelyn was Rhanullt, an otherwise unknown daughter of [[Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson|Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles]]. If correct, these sources could indicate that Llywelyn's father married a daughter of Rǫgnvaldr in about 1220. Contemporary sources, however, show that Llywelyn's mother was Senana.|group=note}} The eldest was [[Owain Goch ap Gruffydd]] and Llywelyn had two younger brothers, [[Dafydd ap Gruffydd]] and [[Rhodri ap Gruffydd]]. Llywelyn is thought to have been born around 1222 or 1223. He is first heard of holding lands in the [[Vale of Clwyd]] around 1244.

Following his grandfather's death in 1240, Llywelyn's uncle, [[Dafydd ap Llywelyn]] (who was Llywelyn the Great's eldest legitimate son), succeeded him as ruler of [[Gwynedd]]. Llywelyn's father, Gruffydd (who was Llywelyn's eldest son but illegitimate), and his brother, Owain, were initially kept prisoner by Dafydd, then transferred into the custody of King [[Henry III of England]]. Gruffydd died in 1244, from a fall while trying to escape from his cell at the top of the [[Tower of London]]. The window from which he attempted to escape the Tower was bricked up and can still be seen to this day.

This freed Dafydd ap Llywelyn's hand as King Henry could no longer use Gruffydd against him, and war broke out between him and King Henry in 1245. Llywelyn supported his uncle in the savage fighting that followed. Owain, meanwhile, was freed by Henry after his father's death in the hope that he would start a civil war in Gwynedd, but stayed in [[Chester]], so when Dafydd died in February 1246 without leaving an heir, Llywelyn had the advantage of being on the spot.

==Early reign==
[[File:Arms of Llywelyn.svg|left|upright|thumb|Arms of [[Gwynedd]]{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}]]

Llywelyn and Owain came to terms with King Henry and in 1247, signed the Treaty of Woodstock at [[Woodstock Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies, John ''History of Wales'' p.140&lt;/ref&gt; The terms they were forced to accept restricted them to Gwynedd Uwch Conwy, the part of Gwynedd west of the [[River Conwy]], which was divided between them. Gwynedd Is Conwy, east of the river, was taken over by King Henry.
[[File:Gwynedd 1247 Map.jpg|thumb|300px|Division of [[Principality of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]] in 1247 following the succession of the brothers [[Owain Goch ap Gruffydd|Owain]] (whose lands are shown in dark green) and Llywelyn (light green) ap Gruffydd. The [[Commote]] of Cymydmaen (gold) was granted to [[Dafydd ap Gruffydd]] by Owain when he reached majority in 1252 (Source: J. Beverley Smith)]]
When [[Dafydd ap Gruffydd]] came of age, King Henry accepted his [[homage (feudal)|homage]] and announced his intention to give him part of the already reduced Gwynedd. Llywelyn refused to accept this, and Owain and Dafydd formed an alliance against him. This led to the [[Battle of Bryn Derwin]] in June 1255. Llywelyn defeated Owain and Dafydd and captured them, thereby becoming sole ruler of Gwynedd Uwch Conwy. Llywelyn now looked to expand his area of control. The population of Gwynedd Is Conwy resented English rule. This area, also known as &quot;Perfeddwlad&quot; (meaning 'middle land') had been given by King Henry to his son [[Edward I of England|Edward]] and during the summer of 1256, he visited the area, but failed to deal with grievances against the rule of his officers. An appeal was made to Llywelyn, who, that November, crossed the River Conwy with an army, accompanied by his brother, Dafydd, whom he had released from prison. By early December, Llywelyn controlled all of Gwynedd Is Conwy apart from the royal castles at [[Dyserth]] and [[Dnoredudd]] as a reward for his support and dispossessing his brother-in-law, [[Rhys Fychan]], who supported the king. An English army led by Stephen Bauzan invaded to try to restore Rhys Fychan but was decisively defeated by Welsh forces at the [[Battle of Cadfan]] in June 1257, with Rhys having previously slipped away to make his peace with Llywelyn.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, J.E. ''A history of Wales'' p.720-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhys Fychan now accepted Llywelyn as overlord, but this caused problems for Llywelyn, as Rhys's lands had already been given to Maredudd. Llywelyn restored his lands to Rhys, but the king's envoys approached Maredudd and offered him Rhys's lands if he would change sides. Maredudd paid homage to Henry in late 1257. By early 1258, Llywelyn was using the title [[Prince of Wales]], first used in an agreement between Llywelyn and his supporters and the [[Scotland|Scottish]] nobility associated with the [[Clan Cumming|Comyn]] family. The English Crown refused to recognise this title however,&lt;ref&gt;Moore, D. 'The Welsh Wars of Independence', Stroud 2005, p.135&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1263, Llywelyn's brother, Dafydd, went over to King Henry.

On 12 December 1263 in the [[commote]] of Ystumanner, [[Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn]] did homage and swore [[fealty]] to Llywelyn. In return he was made a vassal lord and the lands taken from him by Llywelyn about six years earlier were restored to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Llywelyn ap Gruffydd: Prince of Wales&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=J Beverley|title=Llywelyn ap Gruffydd: Prince of Wales|date=2014|publisher=University of Wales Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] (the Younger) defeated the king's supporters at the [[Battle of Lewes]] in 1264, capturing the king and Prince Edward. Llywelyn began negotiations with de Montfort, and in 1265, offered him 30,000 marks in exchange for a permanent peace, in which Llywelyn's right to rule Wales would be acknowledged. The [[Treaty of Pipton]], 22 June 1265, established an alliance between Llywelyn and de Montfort, but the very favourable terms given to Llywelyn in this treaty were an indication of de Montfort's weakening position. De Montfort was to die at the [[Battle of Evesham]] in 1265, a battle in which Llywelyn took no part.

==Supremacy in Wales==

After Simon de Montfort's death, Llywelyn launched a campaign in order to rapidly gain a bargaining position before King Henry had fully recovered. In 1265, Llywelyn captured [[Hawarden Castle (medieval)|Hawarden Castle]] and routed the combined armies of Hamo Lestrange and Maurice fitz Gerald in north Wales. Llywelyn then moved on to [[Brycheiniog]], and in 1266, he routed [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Mortimer|Roger Mortimer]]'s army. With these victories and the backing of the papal legate, [[Pope Adrian V|Ottobuono]], Llywelyn opened negotiations with the king, and was eventually recognised as Prince of Wales by King Henry in the [[Treaty of Montgomery]] in 1267. In return for the title, the retention of the lands he had conquered and the homage of almost all the native rulers of Wales, he was to pay a tribute of 25,000 marks in yearly installments of 3,000 marks, and could if he wished, purchase the homage of the one outstanding native prince -  Maredudd ap Rhys of Deheubarth - for another 5,000 marks. However, Llywelyn's territorial ambitions gradually made him unpopular with some minor Welsh leaders, particularly the princes of south Wales.

The Treaty of Montgomery marked the high point of Llywelyn's power. Problems began arising soon afterwards, initially a dispute with [[Gilbert de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford|Gilbert de Clare]] concerning the allegiance of a Welsh nobleman holding lands in [[Glamorgan]]. Gilbert built [[Caerphilly Castle]] in response to this. King Henry sent a bishop to take possession of the castle while the dispute was resolved but when Gilbert regained the castle by trickery, the king was unable to do anything about it.

Following the death of King Henry in late 1272, with the new King [[Edward I of England]] away from the kingdom, the rule fell to three men. One of them, Roger Mortimer was one of Llywelyn's rivals in the marches. When [[Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford|Humphrey de Bohun]] tried to take back Brycheiniog, which was granted to Llywelyn by the Treaty of Montgomery, Mortimer supported de Bohun. Llywelyn was also finding it difficult to raise the annual sums required under the terms of this treaty, and ceased making payments.

In early 1274, there was a plot by Llywelyn's brother, Dafydd, and [[Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn]] of [[Powys Wenwynwyn]] and his son, [[Owen de la Pole|Owain]], to kill Llywelyn. Dafydd was with Llywelyn at the time, and it was arranged that Owain would come with armed men on 2 February to carry out the assassination; however, he was prevented by a snowstorm. Llywelyn did not discover the full details of the plot until Owain confessed to the Bishop of Bangor. He said that the intention had been to make Dafydd prince of Gwynedd, and that Dafydd would reward Gruffydd with lands. Dafydd and Gruffydd fled to England where they were maintained by the king and carried out raids on Llywelyn's lands, increasing Llywelyn's resentment. When Edward called Llywelyn to Chester in 1275 to pay homage, Llywelyn refused to attend.

Llywelyn also made an enemy of King Edward by continuing to ally himself with the family of Simon de Montfort, even though their power was now greatly reduced. Llywelyn sought to marry [[Eleanor de Montfort]], born in 1252, Simon de Montfort's daughter. They were married by proxy in 1275, but King Edward took exception to the marriage, in part because Eleanor was his first cousin: her mother was [[Eleanor of Leicester|Eleanor of England]], daughter of [[John of England|King John]] and princess of the [[House of Plantagenet]]. When Eleanor sailed from [[France]] to meet Llywelyn, Edward hired [[piracy|pirates]] to seize her ship and she was imprisoned at [[Windsor Castle]] until Llywelyn made certain concessions.

In 1276, Edward declared Llywelyn a rebel and in 1277, gathered an enormous army to march against him. Edward's intention was to disinherit Llywelyn completely and take over Gwynedd Is Conwy himself. He was considering two options for Gwynedd Uwch Conwy: either to divide it between Llywelyn's brothers, Dafydd and Owain, or to annex Anglesey and divide only the mainland between the two brothers. Edward was supported by Dafydd ap Gruffydd and Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn. Many of the lesser Welsh princes who had supported Llywelyn now hastened to make peace with Edward. By the summer of 1277, Edward's forces had reached the [[River Conwy]] and encamped at [[Deganwy]], while another force had captured [[Anglesey]] and took possession of the harvest there. This deprived Llywelyn and his men of food, forcing them to seek terms.

==Treaty of Aberconwy==

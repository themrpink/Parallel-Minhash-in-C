Although forensic science has greatly enhanced the investigator's ability to solve crimes, it has limitations and must be scrutinized in and out of the courtroom to avoid the occurrence of wrongful convictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date=21 August 2012| title=How body parts evidence gets from crime scene to courtroom| author=Fabiola Carletti| publisher=[[CBC News]], PostScript| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2012/08/20/f-body-parts-investigation-breakdown.html| accessdate=2012-08-21| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821205039/http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2012/08/20/f-body-parts-investigation-breakdown.html| archivedate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Innocence Project data base of DNA exonerations shows that many wrongful convictions contained forensic science errors &lt;https://innocenceproject.org/&gt;. As indicated by the National Academy of Sciences (2009) Report cited earlier, Strengthening Forensic Sciences, part of the problem is that many traditional forensic sciences have never been empirically validated; and part of the problem is that all examiners are subject to forensic confirmation biases and should be shielded from contextual information not relevant to the judgment they make.

Many studies have discovered a difference in rape-related injuries reporting based on race, with white victims reporting a higher frequency of injuries than black victims.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Baker RB, Fargo JD, Shambley-Ebron D, Sommers MS. A source of healthcare disparity: Race, skin color, and injuries after rape among adolescents and young adults. Journal of Forensic Nursing, 2010; 6: 144-150&lt;/ref&gt; However, since current forensic examination techniques may not be sensitive to all injuries across a range of skin colors, more research needs to be conducted to understand if this trend is due to skin confounding healthcare providers when examining injuries or if darker skin extends a protective element.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; In clinical practice, for patients with darker skin, one study recommends that attention must be paid to the thighs, labia majora, posterior fourchette and [[Fossa of vestibule of vagina|fossa navicularis]], so that no rape-related injuries are missed upon close examination.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

== Forensic science and humanitarian work ==
The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) uses forensic science for humanitarian purposes to clarify the fate of missing persons after armed conflict, disasters or migration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/what-we-do/forensic/index.jsp |title=Forensic science and humanitarian action |publisher=ICRC |date= 28 July 2014|accessdate=2014-08-03 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707145212/http://www.icrc.org/eng/what-we-do/forensic/index.jsp |archivedate=7 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the services related to [[Restoring Family Links]] and Missing Persons. Knowing what has happened to a missing relative can often make it easier to proceed with the grieving process and move on with life for families of missing persons.

Forensic science is used by various other organizations to clarify the fate and whereabouts of persons who have gone missing. Examples include the NGO [[Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team]], working to clarify the fate of people who disappeared during the period of the 1976–1983 military dictatorship. The [[International Commission on Missing Persons]] (ICMP) uses forensic science to find missing persons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Forensic archeology and anthropology |url=http://www.ic-mp.org/activities/technical-assistance/?page_id=539 |title=Forensic archeology and anthropology |publisher=Ic-mp.org |date=28 February 2012 |accessdate=2014-08-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140624073824/http://www.ic-mp.org/activities/technical-assistance/?page_id=539 |archivedate=24 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example after the conflicts in the Balkans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ic-mp.org/icmp-worldwide/southeast-europe/ |title=Southeast Europe |publisher=Ic-mp.org |date=28 February 2012 |accessdate=2014-08-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813081559/http://www.ic-mp.org/icmp-worldwide/southeast-europe/ |archivedate=13 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognising the role of forensic science for humanitarian purposes, as well as the importance of forensic investigations in fulfilling the state's responsibilities to investigate human rights violations, a group of experts in the late-1980s devised a UN Manual on the Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions, which became known as the [[Minnesota Protocol]]. This document was revised and re-published by the [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Executions/MinnesotaProtocolInvestigationPotentiallyUnlawfulDeath2016.pdf |title=Minnesota Protocol on the Investigation of Potentially Unlawful Death (2016) |accessdate=2017-06-30 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Solanum melongena'' is grown worldwide for its edible fruit.

Most commonly purple, the spongy, absorbent fruit is used in [[List of cuisines|several cuisines]]. Typically used as a [[vegetable]] in cooking, it is a [[berry (botany)|berry]] by [[botany|botanical]] definition. As a member of the genus ''[[Solanum]]'', it is related to the [[tomato]] and [[potato]]. Like the tomato, its skin and seeds can be eaten, but, like the potato, it is usually eaten cooked. Eggplant is nutritionally low in [[macronutrient]] and [[micronutrient]] content, but the capability of the fruit to absorb oils and flavors into its flesh through cooking expands its use in the [[culinary arts]].

==Description==
[[File:Eggplant Flower in Hong Kong.JPG|thumb|Closeup of an eggplant flower]]

The eggplant is a delicate, tropical [[perennial plant|perennial]] plant often cultivated as a [[Hardiness (plants)|tender or half-hardy]] [[annual plant|annual]] in [[temperate climate]]s. The stem is often [[spine (botany)|spiny]]. The [[flower]]s are white to purple in color, with a five-lobed [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]] and yellow [[stamen]]s. Some common cultivars have fruit that is egg-shaped, glossy, and purple with white flesh and a spongy, &quot;meaty&quot; texture. Some other cultivars are white and longer in shape. The cut surface of the flesh rapidly turns brown when the fruit is cut open ([[oxidation]]).

Eggplant grows {{convert|40|to|150|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} tall, with large, coarsely [[lobed]] [[leaf|leaves]] that are {{convert|10|to|20|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|5|to|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} broad. Semiwild types can grow much larger, to {{convert|225|cm|ftin|abbr=on}}, with large leaves over {{convert|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} broad. On wild plants, the fruit is less than {{convert|3|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} in diameter; in cultivated forms: {{convert|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} or more in length are possible for long, narrow types or the large fat purple ones common to [[The Western world|the West]].

Botanically classified as a [[berry (botany)|berry]], the fruit contains numerous small, soft, edible [[seed]]s that taste bitter because they contain or are covered in [[nicotine|nicotinoid]] [[alkaloid]]s, like the related [[tobacco]].

Clément-Mullet, year 1866, volume 2 page 236.&lt;/ref&gt; Records exist from later medieval Catalan and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;The first record of Catalan ''albergínia'' = &quot;aubergine&quot; is in 1328 according to the Catalan dictionary [http://www.diccionari.cat/lexicx.jsp?GECART=0005230 Diccionari.cat] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110024923/http://www.diccionari.cat/lexicx.jsp?GECART=0005230 |date=2013-11-10 }}. An earlier record in Catalan is known, from the 13th century, according to the French [http://cnrtl.fr/definition/aubergine ''Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514101046/http://cnrtl.fr/definition/aubergine |date=2013-05-14 }}. A number of old variant spellings for the aubergine word in Romance dialects in Iberia indicate the word was borrowed from Arabic; [https://books.google.com/books?id=N_hAzIqriakC ''Dictionary of Arabic and Allied Loanwords: Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan, Galician and Kindred Dialects''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003084352/https://books.google.com/books?id=N_hAzIqriakC |date=2015-10-03 }}, by Federico Corriente, year 2008 page 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The aubergine is unrecorded in England until the 16th century. An English botany book in 1597 described the madde or raging Apple:

{{quote|This plant groweth in Egypt almost everywhere... bringing foorth fruite of the bignes of a great Cucumber.... We have had the same in our London gardens, where it hath borne flowers, but the winter approching before the time of ripening, it perished: notwithstanding it came to beare fruite of the bignes of a goose egge one extraordinarie temperate yeere... but never to the full ripenesse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/mobot31753000817749#page/274/mode/1up ''The Herball, or Generall Historie of Plantes''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102054022/http://archive.org/stream/mobot31753000817749#page/274/mode/1up |date=2014-01-02 }}, by [[John Gerarde]], year 1597 page 274.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Because of the plant's relationship with various other [[Solanaceae|nightshades]], the fruit was at one time believed to be extremely poisonous. The flowers and leaves can be poisonous if consumed in large quantities due to the presence of [[solanine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kitchendaily.com/read/raw-eggplant-poisonous?wwu=10|title=Is Raw Eggplant Poisonous?|date=30 August 2012|work=Kitchen Daily|access-date=5 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905065145/http://www.kitchendaily.com/read/raw-eggplant-poisonous?wwu=10|archive-date=5 September 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eggplant has a special place in [[folklore]]. In 13th-century Italian traditional folklore, the eggplant can cause insanity.&lt;ref name=&quot;oed-mad-apple&quot;&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 3rd edition, 2000, ''s.v.'' 'mad-apple'&lt;/ref&gt;  In 19th-century Egypt, insanity was said to be &quot;more common and more violent&quot; when the eggplant is in season in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward William Lane]], ''An Account of the Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians'', v. 1, [https://archive.org/details/anaccountmanner06lanegoog/page/n408 p. 378], footnote 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and regional names==
[[File:Eggplant with chicken eggs.jpg|right|thumb|200px|White eggplant compared to two chicken eggs]]

The plant and fruit have a profusion of English names.

===''Eggplant''-type names===

The name ''eggplant'' is usual in [[North American English]] and [[Australian English]]. First recorded in 1763, the word &quot;eggplant&quot; was originally applied to white cultivars, which look very much like hen's eggs (see image).&lt;ref name=&quot;oed&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Eggplant|url=https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=eggplant|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper|access-date=8 December 2017|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;www&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Eggplant|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-egg1.htm|publisher=World Wide Worlds|access-date=8 December 2017|date=20 October 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209203908/http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-egg1.htm|archive-date=9 December 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;'egg-plant, n.&quot; OED Online, Oxford University Press, July 2018, https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/59900. Accessed 23 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar names are widespread in other languages, such as the [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] term ''eggaldin'' or the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''planhigyn ŵy''.

The white, egg-shaped varieties of the eggplant's fruits are also known as ''garden eggs'',&lt;ref&gt;'[https://www.nap.edu/read/11763/chapter/9 Eggplant (Garden Egg)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923200826/https://www.nap.edu/read/11763/chapter/9 |date=2018-09-23 }}', in National Research Council of the National Academies, ''[https://www.nap.edu/catalog/11763/lost-crops-of-africa-volume-ii-vegetables Lost Crops of Africa, Volume II: Vegetables] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923200828/https://www.nap.edu/catalog/11763/lost-crops-of-africa-volume-ii-vegetables |date=2018-09-23 }}'' (Washington, D.C.: The National Academies Press, 2006), pp. 136-53. {{ISBN|978-0-309-66582-7}}, {{DOI|10.17226/11763}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a term first attested in 1811.&lt;ref&gt;'Garden egg', in &quot;[https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/76724 garden, n.]&quot; ''OED'', 3rd edn (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' records that between 1797 and 1888, the name ''vegetable egg'' was also used.&lt;ref&gt;'[https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/299990 Vegetable egg, n.', ''OED'', 3rd edn (2012).]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Aubergine''-type names===
Whereas ''eggplant'' was coined in English, most of the diverse other European names for the plant derive from the Arabic word ''bāḏinjān'' ({{lang-ar|باذنجان}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;oed-brinjal&quot;&gt;Unless otherwise stated, material in this section derives from ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 3rd edition, 2001, ''s.v.'' '[https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/116252 melongena, n.]'; 2000, ''s.v.'' '[https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/116253 melongene, n.]&quot;; and 2000, ''s.v.'' '[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/112011 mad-apple, n.]'. These partly supersede the etymology in ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 1st edition, 1888, ''s.v.'' '[https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/23394 brinjal]'. This in turn supersedes the 1885 OED etymology ''s.v.'' '[https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/12985 aubergine]'.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bāḏinjān'' is itself a loan-word in Arabic, whose earliest traceable origins lie in the [[Dravidian languages]]. The ''[[Hobson-Jobson]]'' dictionary comments that 'probably there is no word of the kind which has undergone such extraordinary variety of modifications, whilst retaining the same meaning, as this'.&lt;ref name=&quot;hj&quot;&gt;Henry Yule, A.C. Burnell, ''Hobson-Jobson: The Anglo-Indian Dictionary'', 1886, reprint {{ISBN|185326363X}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rcjmiBm8hHQC&amp;pg=PA115 p. 115], ''s.v.'' 'brinjaul'&lt;/ref&gt;

In English usage, modern names deriving from Arabic ''bāḏinjān'' include:

*''Aubergine'', usual in [[British English]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]].
*''Brinjal'' or ''brinjaul'', usual in [[South Asia]] and [[South African English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/brinjal|title=Brinjal|publisher=Oxford University Press|access-date=28 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612184735/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/brinjal|archive-date=12 June 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Solanum melongena'', the [[Linnaean name]].

====From Dravidian to Arabic====
[[File:Muhammad ibn Muhammad Shakir Ruzmah-'i Nathani - An Eggplant, a Plant Called Parsiyavushan, and Dungwort - Walters W659225B - Full Page.jpg|thumb|Illustration of an eggplant (upper picture) in a 1717 manuscript of a work by the thirteenth-century Persian [[Zakariya al-Qazwini]].]]
All the ''aubergine''-type names have the same origin, in the Dravidian languages. Modern descendants of this [[Proto-Dravidian language|ancient Dravidian]] word include [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] ''vaṟutina'' and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] ''vaṟutuṇai''.

The Dravidian word was borrowed into the [[Indic languages]], giving ancient forms such as [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] ''vātiṅ-gaṇa'' (alongside Sanskrit ''vātigama'') and [[Prakrit]] ''vāiṃaṇa''. According to the entry ''brinjal'' in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the Sanskrit word ''vātin-gāna'' denoted 'the class (that removes) the wind-disorder (windy humour)': that is, ''vātin-gāna'' came to be the name for eggplants because they were thought to cure [[flatulence]]. The modern [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] words descending directly from the Sanskrit name are ''baingan'' and ''began''.

The Indic word ''vātiṅ-gaṇa'' was then borrowed into [[Persian language|Persian]] as ''bādingān''. Persian ''bādingān'' was borrowed in turn into Arabic as ''bāḏinjān'' (or, with the [[definite article]], ''al-bāḏinjān''). From Arabic, the word was borrowed into European languages.

====From Arabic into Iberia and beyond====
In [[al-Andalus]], the Arabic word ''(al-)bāḏinjān'' was borrowed into the [[Romance languages]] in forms beginning with ''b''- or, with the definite article included, ''alb''-:
* [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] {{lang|pt|bringella}}, {{lang|pt|bringiela}}, earlier {{lang|pt|beringela}}.
* [[Spanish language|Spanish]] {{lang|es|berengena}}, {{lang|es|alberengena}}.

The Spanish word ''alberengena'' was then borrowed into French, giving {{lang|fr|aubergine}} (along with French dialectal forms like {{lang|fr|albergine}}, {{lang|fr|albergaine}}, {{lang|fr|albergame}}, and {{lang|fr|belingèle}}). The French name was then borrowed into British English, appearing there first in the late eighteenth century.

Through the [[colonialism|colonial expansion]] of Portugal, the Portuguese form {{lang|pt|bringella}} was borrowed into a variety of other languages:
* Indian English and South African English ''brinjal'', ''brinjaul'' (first attested in the seventeenth century).
* [[Malay language|Malay]] ''berinjalā''.
* [[West Indian English]] ''brinjalle'' and (through [[folk-etymology]]) ''brown-jolly''.

Thus although Indian English ''brinjal'' ultimately originates in languages of the Indian Subcontinent, it actually came into Indian English via Portuguese.

====From Arabic into Greek and beyond====
[[File:MS 626, folio CLXXV Wellcome L0075018.jpg|thumb|Illustrations of an eggplant from a possibly fifteenth-century French manuscript of a work by [[Matthaeus Platearius]]. The word ''melonge'', below the illustration, has a blue initial ''M''-.]]
The Arabic word ''bāḏinjān'' was borrowed into [[Greek language|Greek]] by the eleventh century CE. The Greek loans took a variety of forms, but crucially they began with ''m-'', partly because Greek lacked the initial ''b-'' sound and partly through [[folk-etymology|folk-etymological]] association with the Greek word ''μέλας'' (''melas''), 'black'. Attested Greek forms include ''ματιζάνιον'' (''matizanion'', eleventh-century), ''μελιντζάνα'' (''melintzana'', fourteenth-century), and ''μελιντζάνιον'' (''melintzanion'', seventeenth-century).

From Greek, the word was borrowed into [[Italian language|Italian]] and medieval [[Latin]], and onwards into French. Early forms include:
* ''Melanzāna'', recorded in [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] in the twelfth century.
* ''Melongena'', recorded in Latin in the thirteenth century.
* ''Melongiana'', recorded in [[Veronese language|Veronese]] in the fourteenth century.
* ''Melanjan'', recorded in [[Old French]].

From these forms came the botanical Latin ''melongēna''. This was used by [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort|Tournefort]] as a [[genus]] name in 1700, then by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] as a [[species]] name in 1753. It remains in scientific use.

These forms also gave rise to the [[Caribbean English]] ''melongene''.

The Italian ''melanzana'', through [[folk-etymology]], was adapted to ''mela insana'' ('mad apple'): already by the thirteenth century, this name had given rise to a tradition that eggplants could cause insanity. Translated into English as 'mad-apple', 'rage-apple', or 'raging apple', this name for eggplants is attested from 1578 and the form 'mad-apple' may still be found in [[Southern American English]].&lt;ref name=&quot;guineasquash&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecarolinagoldricefoundation.org/news/2016/6/4/guinea-squash|title=Guinea squash|publisher=Carolina Gold Rice Foundation|date=4 April 2011|access-date=9 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110061559/http://www.thecarolinagoldricefoundation.org/news/2016/6/4/guinea-squash|archive-date=10 November 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other English names===

The plant is also known as ''guinea squash'' in [[Southern American English]]. The term ''guinea'' in the name originally denoted the fact that the fruits were associated with West Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;guineasquash&quot;/&gt;

It has been known as 'Jew's apple', apparently in relation to a belief that the fruit was first imported to the West Indies by Jewish people.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;brown-jolly&quot;, in &quot;[https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/23849 brown, adj.]&quot;, &quot;[https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/101210 Jews' apple]&quot; in &quot;Jew, n.&quot; OED Online, Oxford University Press, July 2018.

==Cultivars==
[[File:Three Types of Eggplant.jpg|thumb|Three [[cultivar]]s of eggplant, showing size, shape, and color differences]]
{{no footnotes|section|date=December 2018}}

Different [[cultivar]]s of the plant produce fruit of different size, shape, and color, though typically purple. The less common white varieties of eggplant are also known as Easter white eggplants, garden eggs, Casper or white eggplant. The most widely cultivated varieties—[[cultivar]]s—in Europe and North America today are elongated ovoid, {{convert|12–25|cm|in|frac=2|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|6–9|cm|in|frac=2|abbr=on}} broad with a dark purple skin.

A much wider range of shapes, sizes, and colors is grown in India and elsewhere in Asia. Larger cultivars weighing up to a kilogram (2.2 pounds) grow in the region between the [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]] Rivers, while smaller ones are found elsewhere.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Colors vary from white to yellow or green, as well as reddish-purple and dark purple. Some cultivars have a color gradient—white at the stem, to bright pink, deep purple or even black. Green or purple cultivars with white striping also exist. Chinese cultivars are commonly shaped like a narrower, slightly pendulous [[cucumber]]. Also, Asian cultivars of Japanese breeding are grown.
* Oval or elongated oval-shaped and black-skinned cultivars include 'Harris Special Hibush', 'Burpee Hybrid', 'Bringal Bloom', 'Black Magic', 'Classic', 'Dusky', and 'Black Beauty'.
* Slim cultivars in purple-black skin include 'Little Fingers', 'Ichiban', 'Pingtung Long', and 'Tycoon'
** In green skin, 'Louisiana Long Green' and 'Thai (Long) Green'
** In white skin, 'Dourga'.
* Traditional, white-skinned, egg-shaped cultivars include 'Casper' and 'Easter Egg'.
* Bicolored cultivars with color gradient include 'Rosa Bianca', 'Violetta di Firenze', 'Bianca Sfumata di Rosa' (heirloom), and 'Prosperosa' (heirloom).
* Bicolored cultivars with striping include 'Listada de Gandia' and 'Udumalapet'.
* In some parts of India, miniature cultivars, most commonly called ''vengan,'' are popular.

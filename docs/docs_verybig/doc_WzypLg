===Official residence of the Vice President of the United States===
[[Image:1OC2003.jpg|thumb|right|[[Number One Observatory Circle]], official home of the Vice President of the United States]]
{{Main|Number One Observatory Circle}}
Since 1974, a house situated on the grounds of the observatory, at Number One Observatory Circle, has been the official residence of the [[Vice President of the United States]], and is therefore subject to tight security control enforced by the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]]. The house is separated from the Naval Observatory, and was formerly the residence of its superintendent, and later the home of the [[Chief of Naval Operations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/vp-residence The Vice-President's Residence and Office] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709052319/http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/vp-residence/ |date=2011-07-09 }} accessdate=2013-02-27&lt;/ref&gt;

The bunker is the secure, undisclosed location where former Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] remained under protection in secret after the [[September 11 attacks]]: according to Clift's report, titled &quot;Shining Light on Cheney's Hideaway&quot;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Biden said a young naval officer giving him a tour of the residence showed him the hideaway, which is behind a massive steel door secured by an elaborate lock with a narrow connecting hallway lined with shelves filled with communications equipment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Biden's press office subsequently issued a statement denying the bunker report, suggesting that Biden had instead been describing &quot;an upstairs workspace&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/05/17/oops-biden-reveals-location-secret-vp-bunker/ |title=Biden Reveals Location of Secret VP Bunker |date=2009-05-17 |accessdate=2009-05-17 |publisher=FOX News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519225807/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/05/17/oops-biden-reveals-location-secret-vp-bunker/ |archive-date=2009-05-19 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Condensed matter physics|expanded=Quasiparticles}}
An '''exciton''' is a [[bound state]] of an [[electron]] and an [[electron hole]] which are attracted to each other by the electrostatic [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb force]]. It is an electrically neutral [[quasiparticle]] that exists in [[Electrical insulation|insulators]], [[semiconductor]]s and some liquids. The exciton is regarded as an elementary excitation of [[condensed matter]] that can transport energy without transporting net electric charge.&lt;ref&gt;R. S. Knox, Theory of excitons, Solid state physics (Ed. by Seitz and Turnbul, Academic, NY), v. 5, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/0031-9120/5/4/003|title=Excitons|year=1970|last1=Liang|first1=W Y|journal=Physics Education|volume=5|issue=125301  |pages=226–228|bibcode = 1970PhyEd...5..226L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monique Combescot and Shiue-Yuan Shiau, &quot;Excitons and Cooper Pairs: Two Composite Bosons in Many-Body Physics&quot;, Oxford University Press ({{ISBN|9780198753735}})&lt;/ref&gt;

An exciton can form when a material absorbs a [[photon]] of higher energy than its bandgap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.84.125301|title=Charge control in InP/(Ga,In)P single quantum dots embedded in Schottky diodes|year=2011|last1=Couto|first1=ODD|last2=Puebla|first2=J|journal=Physical Review B|volume=84|page=226|bibcode = 2011PhRvB..84l5301C|issue=4 |arxiv=1107.2522}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This excites an electron from the [[valence band]] into the [[conduction band]].  In turn, this leaves behind a positively charged [[electron hole]] (an abstraction for the location from which an electron was moved).  The electron in the conduction band is then less attracted to this localized hole due to the repulsive  [[Coulomb force]]s from large numbers of electrons surrounding the hole and excited electron. These repulsive forces provide a stabilizing energy balance.  Consequently, the exciton has slightly less energy than the unbound electron and hole. The [[wavefunction]] of the bound state is said to be ''[[Hydrogen-like atom|hydrogenic]]'', an [[exotic atom]] state akin to that of a [[hydrogen]] [[atom]]. However, the [[binding energy]] is much smaller and the particle's size much larger than a hydrogen atom.   This is because of both the screening of the Coulomb force by other electrons in the semiconductor (i.e., its [[relative permittivity]]), and the small [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]]es of the excited electron and hole. The recombination of the electron and hole, i.e., the decay of the exciton, is limited by resonance stabilization due to the overlap of the electron and hole wave functions,  resulting in an extended lifetime for the exciton.

The electron and hole may have either parallel or anti-parallel [[Spin (physics)|spin]]s. The spins are coupled by the [[exchange interaction]], giving rise to exciton [[fine structure]]. In periodic lattices, the properties of an exciton show [[Crystal momentum|momentum]] (k-vector) dependence.

The concept of excitons was first proposed by [[Yakov Frenkel]] in 1931,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.37.17|title=On the Transformation of light into Heat in Solids. I|year=1931|last1=Frenkel|first1=J.|journal=Physical Review|volume=37|issue=1|page=17|bibcode = 1931PhRv...37...17F }}&lt;/ref&gt; when he described the excitation of atoms in a lattice of insulators. He proposed that this excited state would be able to travel in a particle-like fashion through the lattice without the net transfer of charge.

Excitons are often treated in the two limiting cases of small [[Relative_permittivity|dielectric constant]] versus large dielectric constant; corresponding to Frenkel exciton and Wannier–Mott exciton respectively.

==Frenkel exciton==
In materials with a relatively small [[dielectric constant]], the Coulomb interaction between an electron and a hole may be strong and the excitons thus tend to be small, of the same order as the size of the unit cell. Molecular excitons may even be entirely located on the same molecule, as in [[fullerene]]s.  This ''Frenkel exciton'', named after [[Yakov Frenkel]], has a typical binding energy on the order of 0.1 to 1 [[electron volt|eV]]. Frenkel excitons are typically found in alkali halide crystals and in organic molecular crystals composed of aromatic molecules, such as [[anthracene]] and [[tetracene]]. Another example of Frenkel exciton includes on-site ''d''-''d'' excitations in transition metal compounds with partially-filled ''d''-shells. While ''d''-''d'' transitions are in principle forbidden by symmetry, they become weakly-allowed in a crystal when the symmetry is broken by structural relaxations or other effects. Absorption of a photon resonant with a ''d''-''d'' transition leads to the creation of an electron-hole pair on a single atomic site, which can be treated as a Frenkel exciton.

==Wannier–Mott exciton==
In semiconductors, the dielectric constant is generally large.  Consequently, [[electric field screening]] tends to reduce the Coulomb interaction between electrons and holes. The result is a ''Wannier–Mott exciton'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.52.191|title=The Structure of Electronic Excitation Levels in Insulating Crystals|year=1937|last1=Wannier|first1=Gregory|journal=Physical Review|volume=52|page=191|bibcode = 1937PhRv...52..191W|issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which has a radius larger than the lattice spacing. Small effective mass of electrons that is typical of semiconductors also favors large exciton radii. As a result, the effect of the lattice potential can be incorporated into the effective masses of the electron and hole.  Likewise, because of the lower masses and the screened Coulomb interaction, the binding energy is usually much less than that of a hydrogen atom, typically on the order of {{gaps|0.01|eV}}. This type of exciton was named for [[Gregory Wannier]] and [[Nevill Francis Mott]]. Wannier–Mott excitons are typically found in semiconductor crystals with small energy gaps and high dielectric constants, but have also been identified in liquids, such as liquid [[xenon]]. They are also known as ''large excitons''.

In single-wall [[carbon nanotubes]], excitons have both Wannier–Mott and Frenkel character. This is due to the nature of the Coulomb interaction between electrons and holes in one-dimension. The dielectric function of the nanotube itself is large enough to allow for the spatial extent of the [[wave function]] to extend over a few to several nanometers along the tube axis, while poor screening in the vacuum or dielectric environment outside of the nanotube allows for large (0.4 to {{gaps|1.0|eV}}) binding energies.

Often more than one band can be chosen as source for the electron and the hole, leading to different types of excitons in the same material. Even high-lying bands can be effective as [[femtosecond]] two-photon experiments have shown. At cryogenic temperatures, many higher excitonic levels can be observed approaching the edge of the band,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/nature13832| pmid=25318523| title=Giant Rydberg excitons in the copper oxide Cu2O| journal=Nature| volume=514| issue=7522| pages=343–347| year=2014| last1=Kazimierczuk| first1=T.| last2=Fröhlich| first2=D.| last3=Scheel| first3=S.| last4=Stolz| first4=H.| last5=Bayer| first5=M.| arxiv=1407.0691}}&lt;/ref&gt; forming a series of spectral absorption lines that are in principle similar to [[hydrogen spectral series]].

===Equations for 3D semiconductors===
In a bulk semiconductor, a Wannier exciton has an energy and radius associated with it, called '''exciton Rydberg energy''' and '''exciton Bohr radius''' respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fox |first=Mark |date= 2010-03-25|title=Optical Properties of Solids |edition=2 |url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/optical-properties-of-solids-9780199573370?q=max%20fox%20optical%20properties%20of%20solids&amp;lang=en&amp;cc=no |location= |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=97 |isbn=978-0199573363 |author-link= |series=Oxford Master Series in Physics }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the energy, we have

:&lt;math&gt;E(n)=- \frac{ \left( \frac{\mu}{m_0 \varepsilon_r^2}R_\text{y} \right)}{n^2}  \equiv -\frac{R_\text{X}}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_\text{y}&lt;/math&gt; is the Rydberg unit of energy ([[Rydberg constant]]), &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_r&lt;/math&gt; is the (static) relative permittivity, &lt;math&gt;\mu= (m^*_e m^*_h)/(m^*_e+m^*_h)&lt;/math&gt; is the reduced mass of the electron and hole, and &lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; is the electron mass. Concerning the radius, we have

:&lt;math&gt;r_n = \left(\frac{m_0 \varepsilon_r a_\text{H}}{\mu}  \right)n^2 \equiv a_\text{X}n^2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_\text{H}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Bohr radius]].

So for example in [[Gallium arsenide|GaAs]], we have relative permittivity of 12.8 and effective electron and hole masses as 0.067''m&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' and 0.2''m&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' respectively; and that gives us &lt;math&gt;R_\text{X}=4.2&lt;/math&gt; meV and &lt;math&gt;a_\text{X}=13&lt;/math&gt; nm.

===Equations for 2D semiconductors===
In [[Two-dimensional materials|two-dimensional (2D) materials]], the system is [[quantum confinement|quantum confined]] in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the material. The reduced dimensionality of the system has an effect on the binding energies and radii of Wannier excitons. In fact, excitonic effects are enhanced in such systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChernikovBerkelbach2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chernikov|first1=Alexey|last2=Berkelbach|first2=Timothy C.|last3=Hill|first3=Heather M.|last4=Rigosi|first4=Albert|last5=Li|first5=Yilei|last6=Aslan|first6=Ozgur Burak|last7=Reichman|first7=David R.|last8=Hybertsen|first8=Mark S.|last9=Heinz|first9=Tony F.|title=Exciton Binding Energy and Nonhydrogenic Rydberg Series in MonolayerWS2|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=113|issue=7|year=2014|issn=0031-9007|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.076802|doi-access=free|bibcode=2014PhRvL.113g6802C|pmid=25170725|page=076802}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For a simple screened Coulomb potential, the binding energies take the form of the 2D hydrogen atom&lt;ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E(n)= -\frac{R_\text{X}}{\left(n-\tfrac{1}{2}\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

In most 2D semiconductors, the Rytova–Keldysh form is a more accurate approximation to the exciton interaction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rytova |first1=N S. |title=The screened potential of a point charge in a thin film |journal=Proc.

:&lt;math&gt;V(r)= -\frac{\pi}{2r_0}\left[\text{H}_0\left(\frac{\kappa r}{r_0}\right)-Y_0\left(\frac{\kappa r}{r_0}\right)\right],&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt; is the so-called screening length, &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; the average dielectric constant of the surrounding media, and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; the exciton radius. For this potential, no general expression for the exciton energies may be found. One must instead turn to numerical procedures, and it is precisely this potential that gives rise to the nonhydrogenic Rydberg series of the energies in 2D semiconductors.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChernikovBerkelbach2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chernikov|first1=Alexey|last2=Berkelbach|first2=Timothy C.|last3=Hill|first3=Heather M.|last4=Rigosi|first4=Albert|last5=Li|first5=Yilei|last6=Aslan|first6=Ozgur Burak|last7=Reichman|first7=David R.|last8=Hybertsen|first8=Mark S.|last9=Heinz|first9=Tony F.|title=Exciton Binding Energy and Nonhydrogenic Rydberg Series in MonolayerWS2|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=113|issue=7|year=2014|issn=0031-9007|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.076802|doi-access=free|bibcode=2014PhRvL.113g6802C|pmid=25170725|page=076802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charge-transfer exciton==
An intermediate case between Frenkel and Wannier excitons is the ''charge-transfer (CT) exciton''. In molecular physics, CT excitons form when the electron and the hole occupy adjacent molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Molecular Crystals|author=J. D.

CT excitons can also occur in transition metal oxides, where they involve an electron in the transition metal 3''d'' orbitals and a hole in the oxygen 2''p'' orbitals. Notable examples include the lowest-energy excitons in correlated cuprates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.77.060501|title=Charge-transfer exciton in La&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; probed with resonant inelastic x-ray scattering|year=2008|journal=Physical Review B|volume=77|issue=6|pages=060501(R)|last1=Ellis|first1=D.

==Surface exciton==
At surfaces it is possible for so called ''image states'' to occur, where the hole is inside the solid and the electron is in the vacuum. These electron-hole pairs can only move along the surface.

==Atomic and molecular excitons==
Alternatively, an exciton may be described as an excited state of an atom, [[ion]], or molecule, if the excitation is wandering from one cell of the lattice to another.

When a molecule absorbs a quantum of energy that corresponds to a transition from one [[molecular orbital]] to another molecular orbital, the resulting electronic excited state is also properly described as an exciton. An [[electron]] is said to be found in the [[HOMO/LUMO|lowest unoccupied orbital]] and an [[electron hole]] in the [[HOMO/LUMO|highest occupied molecular orbital]], and since they are found within the same molecular orbital manifold, the electron-hole state is said to be bound. Molecular excitons typically have characteristic lifetimes on the order of [[nanoseconds]], after which the ground electronic state is restored and the molecule undergoes photon or [[phonon]] emission. Molecular excitons have several interesting properties, one of which is energy transfer (see [[Förster resonance energy transfer]]) whereby if a molecular exciton has proper energetic matching to a second molecule's spectral absorbance, then an exciton may transfer (''hop'') from one molecule to another. The process is strongly dependent on intermolecular distance between the species in solution, and so the process has found application in sensing and ''molecular rulers''.

The hallmark of molecular excitons in organic molecular crystals are doublets and/or triplets of exciton absorption bands strongly polarized along crystallographic axes. In these crystals an elementary cell includes several molecules sitting in symmetrically identical positions, which results in the level degeneracy that is lifted by intermolecular interaction. As a result, absorption bands are polarized along the symmetry axes of the crystal. Such multiplets were discovered by [[Antonina Prikhot'ko]]&lt;ref&gt;A. Prikhotjko, Absorption Spectra of Crystals at Low Temperatures, J. Physics USSR '''8''', 257 (1944)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. F. Prikhot'ko, Izv, AN SSSR Ser. Fiz.

It is known as 'Davydov splitting'.&lt;ref&gt;A.S Davydov, Theory of Molecular Excitons (Plenum, NY) 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V. L. Broude, E. I. Rashba, and E. F.

==Giant oscillator strength of bound excitons==
Excitons are lowest excited states of the electronic subsystem of pure crystals. Impurities can bind excitons, and when the bound state is shallow, the oscillator strength for producing bound excitons is so high that impurity absorption can compete with intrinsic exciton absorption even at rather low impurity concentrations. This phenomenon is generic and applicable both to the large radius (Wannier–Mott) excitons and molecular (Frenkel) excitons. Hence, excitons bound to impurities and defects possess [[giant oscillator strength]].&lt;ref&gt;E. I. Rashba, Giant Oscillator Strengths Associated with Exciton Complexes, Sov. Phys. Semicond. '''8''', 807-816 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Self-trapping of excitons==
In crystals excitons interact with phonons, the lattice vibrations. If this coupling is weak as in typical semiconductors such as GaAs or Si, excitons are scattered by phonons. However, when the coupling is strong, excitons can be self-trapped.&lt;ref&gt;N. Schwentner, E.-E. Koch, and J. Jortner, Electronic excitations in condensed rare gases,  Springer tracts in modern physics, '''107''', 1 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Ueta, H. Kanzaki, K. Kobayashi, Y. Toyozawa, and E. Hanamura. Excitonic Processes in Solids, Springer Series in Solid State Sciences, Vol. '''60''' (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; '''Self-trapping''' results in dressing excitons with a dense cloud of virtual phonons which strongly suppresses the ability of excitons to move across the crystal. In simpler terms, this means a local deformation of the crystal lattice around the exciton. Self-trapping can be achieved only if the energy of this deformation can compete with the width of the exciton band. Hence, it should be of atomic scale, of about an electron volt.

Self-trapping of excitons is similar to forming strong-coupling [[polaron]]s but with three essential differences. First, self-trapped exciton states are always of a small radius, of the order of lattice constant, due to their electric neutrality. Second, there exists a '''self-trapping barrier''' separating free and self-trapped states, hence, free excitons are metastable. Third, this barrier enables '''coexistence of free and self-trapped states''' of excitons.&lt;ref&gt;E. I. Rashba, &quot;Theory of Strong Interaction of Electron Excitations with Lattice Vibrations in Molecular Crystals, Optika i Spektroskopiya '''2''', 75, 88 (1957).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. I. Rashba, Self-trapping of excitons, in: Excitons (North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1982), p. 547.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.I. Pekar, E.I. Rashba, V.I. Sheka, Sov. Phys. JETP '''49''', 251 (1979), http://www.jetp.ac.ru/cgi-bin/dn/e_049_01_0129.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This means that spectral lines of free excitons and wide bands of self-trapped excitons can be seen simultaneously in absorption and luminescence spectra. While the self-trapped states are of lattice-spacing scale, the barrier has typically much larger scale. Indeed, its spatial scale is about &lt;math&gt;r_b\sim m\gamma^2/\omega^2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is effective mass of the exciton, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the exciton-phonon coupling constant, and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the characteristic frequency of optical phonons. Excitons are self-trapped when &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; are large, and then the spatial size of the barrier is large compared with the lattice spacing. Transforming a free exciton state into a self-trapped one proceeds as a collective tunneling of coupled exciton-lattice system (an [[instanton]]). Because &lt;math&gt;r_b&lt;/math&gt; is large, tunneling can be described by a continuum theory.&lt;ref&gt;A. S. Ioselevich and E. I. Rashba, Theory of Nonradiative Trapping in Crystals, in: &quot;Quantum tunneling in condensed media.&quot; Eds. Yu. Kagan and A. J. Leggett. (North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1992), p. 347-425.https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ElDtL9qZuHUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA347&amp;dq=%22E+I+Rashba%22&amp;ots=KjE3JYn9kl&amp;sig=0Aj4IdVj0zqPSyq3ep_RT6sOlgQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22E%20I%20Rashba%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The height of the barrier &lt;math&gt;W\sim \omega^4/m^3\gamma^4&lt;/math&gt;. Because both &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; appear in the denominator of &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, the barriers are basically low. Therefore, free excitons can be seen in crystals with strong exciton-phonon coupling only in pure samples and at low temperatures.

==Interaction==
Excitons are the main mechanism for [[light emission]] in semiconductors at low [[temperature]] (when the characteristic thermal energy ''[[Boltzmann constant|k]]T'' is less than the exciton [[binding energy]]), replacing the free electron-hole recombination at higher temperatures.

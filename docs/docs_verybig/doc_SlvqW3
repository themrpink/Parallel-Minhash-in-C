Due to its thermal stability and chemical inertness, slate has been used for laboratory bench tops and for [[billiard table]] tops. In 18th- and 19th-century schools, slate was extensively used for [[Chalkboard|blackboards]] and individual [[Slate (writing)|writing slates]], for which slate or chalk pencils were used.

In areas where it is available, high-quality slate is used for [[tombstones]] and commemorative tablets. In some cases slate was used by the ancient [[Maya civilization]] to fashion [[Maya stelae|stelae]].

Slate was the traditional material of choice for black [[Go (game)|Go]] stones in Japan. It is now considered to be a luxury.

{{Main|Slate industry}}

===Europe===
Most slate in Europe today [[Slate Industry in Spain|comes from Spain]], the world's largest producer and exporter of natural slate, and 90 percent of Europe's natural slate used for roofing originates from the slate industry there.

Lesser slate-producing regions in Europe include [[Slate industry in Wales|Wales]] (with a [[National Slate Museum|museum at Llanberis]]), [[Cornwall]] (famously the village of [[Delabole]]), [[Cumbria]] (see [[Burlington Slate Quarries]], [[Honister Slate Mine]] and [[Skiddaw Slate]]) and, formerly in the West Highlands of Scotland, around [[Ballachulish]] and the [[Slate Islands]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Parts of [[France]] ([[Anjou]], [[Loire Valley]], [[Ardennes]], [[Brittany]], [[Savoie]]) and [[Belgium]] (Ardennes), [[Liguria]] in northern [[Italy]], especially between the town of [[Lavagna]] (which means ''chalkboard'' in [[Italian language|Italian]]) and Fontanabuona valley; [[Portugal]] especially around [[Valongo]] in the north of the country.

[[Germany]]'s [[Moselle River]] region, [[Hunsrück]] (with a former mine open as a museum at [[Fell Exhibition Slate Mine|Fell]]), [[Eifel]], [[Westerwald]], [[Thuringia]] and north [[Bavaria]]; and [[Alta, Norway]] (actually [[schist]], not a true slate). Some of the slate from Wales and Cumbria is colored slate (non-blue): purple and formerly green in Wales and green in Cumbria.

===Americas===
Slate is abundant in [[Brazil]], the world's second-biggest producer of slate, around [[Papagaios]] in [[Minas Gerais]], which extracts 95 percent of Brazil's slate. However, not all &quot;slate&quot; products from Brazil are entitled to bear the [[CE mark]].&lt;ref&gt;Fundación Centro Tecnológico de la Pizarra. Report into the &quot;Technical properties of Bambui Slate from the State of Minas Gerais (Brazil) to ascertain its compliance with the Standard EN12326&quot;. [http://www.spanishslateuk.com/pdf/Brazilian_slate_summary.pdf Brazilian Slate Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214213924/http://www.spanishslateuk.com/pdf/Brazilian_slate_summary.pdf |date=14 February 2010 }}, retrieved on 27 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Slate is produced on the east coast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], in Eastern [[Pennsylvania]], [[Buckingham Slate|Buckingham County, Virginia]], and the [[Slate Valley]] of [[Vermont]] and [[New York (state)|New York]], where colored slate is mined in the [[Granville (town), New York|Granville, New York]] area.  Pennsylvania slate is widely used in the manufacture of turkey calls used for hunting turkeys in the U.S.  The tones produced from the slate (when scratched with various species of wood strikers) imitates almost exactly the calls of all four species of [[wild turkey]] in North America: eastern, Rio Grande, Osceola and Merriam's.

A major slating operation existed in [[Monson, Maine]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, where the slate is usually dark purple to blackish, and many local structures are still roofed with slate tiles. The roof of [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York]] was made of Monson slate, as is the headstone of [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.granville-ny.com/facts.htm Granville: Facts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108054330/http://www.granville-ny.com/facts.htm |date=8 January 2011 }} accessed 23 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Slate is found in the [[Arctic]], and was used by [[Inuit]] to make the blades for [[ulu]]s.

[[File:Mintaro Slate Quarry 1880.jpeg|thumb|right|Workers mining slate at Mintaro quarry, c. 1880]]
=== Asia ===
China has vast slate deposits; in recent years its export of finished and unfinished slate has increased.

=== Australia ===

Deposits of slate exist throughout the Australian continent, with large reserves quarried in the [[Adelaide Hills]] ([[Willunga, South Australia|Willunga]] and [[Kanmantoo, South Australia|Kanmantoo]]) and the [[Mid North]] ([[Mintaro, South Australia#Slate and Flagstone|Mintaro]] and [[Spalding, South Australia|Spalding]]).

==Fossils==
Because slate was formed in low heat and pressure, compared to a number of other [[metamorphic rock]]s, some [[fossils]] can be found in slate; sometimes even [[microscopic]] remains of delicate organisms can be found in slate.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Video: ''[[David Attenborough]]: Lost Worlds, Vanished Lives''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Le Voyage dans la lune.jpg|thumb|right|Early model use from &quot;[[A Trip to the Moon]]&quot;]]
A '''miniature effect''' is a [[special effect]] created for motion pictures and television programs using [[scale model]]s. Scale models are often combined with [[high speed photography]] or [[Matte (filmmaking)|matte shots]] to make gravitational and other effects appear convincing to the viewer. The use of miniatures has largely been superseded by [[computer-generated imagery]] in the contemporary cinema.

Where a miniature appears in the foreground of a shot, this is often very close to the camera lens — for example when matte painted backgrounds are used. Since the exposure is set to the object being filmed so the actors appear well lit, the miniature must be over-lit in order to balance the exposure and eliminate any depth of field differences that would otherwise be visible. This foreground miniature usage is referred to as [[forced perspective]]. Another form of miniature effect uses [[stop motion]] [[animation]].

Use of scale models in the creation of visual effects by the entertainment industry dates back to the earliest days of cinema.  Models and miniatures are copies of people, animals, buildings, settings and objects. Miniatures or models are used to represent things that do not really exist, or that are too expensive or difficult to film in reality, such as explosions, floods or fires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oscars.org/teachersguide/visualeffects/activity1.html Visual Effects | Activity 1 | Teacher's Resource Guide | YMI, Ltd./AMPAS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905085905/http://www.oscars.org/teachersguide/visualeffects/activity1.html |date=September 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== From 1900 to the mid-1960s ==
French director [[Georges Méliès]] incorporated special effects in his 1902 film ''[[A Trip to the Moon|Le Voyage dans la Lune]]'' (''A Trip to the Moon'') — including double-exposure, split screens, miniatures and stop-action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chmielewski|first=Dawn|title=A medium in motion|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/cl-ca-125filmtech21may21,0,6395197.story|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=May 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most influential visual effects films of these early years such as ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927), ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941), ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' (1954) ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/bookshelf/10_cbd_4.htm|title=Motion Picture Directing&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1933 film ''[[King Kong]]'' made extensive use of miniature effects including scale models and stop-motion animation of miniature elements.

== From the mid-1960s ==
[[Image:Discovery1b.JPG|thumb|right|Miniature-based special effects shot from ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'': USSC ''[[Discovery One]]'' deploys an EVA Pod.]]

The use of miniatures in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animated-news.com/2007/ves-unveils-“50-most-influential-visual-effects-films-of-all-time” VES Unveils “50 Most Influential Visual Effects Films of All Time”]&lt;/ref&gt; was a major development. In production for three years, the film was a significant advancement in creating convincing models.

In the early 1970s, miniatures were often used to depict disasters in such films as ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'' (1972), ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]'' (1974) and ''[[The Towering Inferno (film)|The Towering Inferno]]'' (1975).

The resurgence of the science fiction genre in film in the late 1970s saw miniature fabrication rise to new heights in such films as  ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', (1977), ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (also 1977), ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979), ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' (1979) and ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982). Iconic film sequences such as the tanker truck explosion from ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984) and the bridge destruction in ''[[True Lies]]'' (1994) were achieved through the use of large-scale miniatures.

== Largely replaced by CGI ==
The release of ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993) was a turning point in the use of computers to create effects for which physical miniatures would have previously been employed.

While the use of computer generated imagery (CGI) has largely overtaken their use since then, they are still often employed, especially for projects requiring physical interaction with fire, explosions or water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcontentproducer.com/mag/video_miniatures_digital_world/ |title=Miniatures In a Digital World |publisher=Digitalcontentproducer.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Menhaden''', also known as '''mossbunker''' and '''bunker''', are [[forage fish]] of the genera '''''Brevoortia''''' and '''''Ethmidium''''', two genera of [[marine fish]] in the family [[Clupeidae]]. ''Menhaden'' is a blend of ''poghaden'' (''pogy'' for short) and an [[Eastern Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word akin to [[Narragansett language|Narragansett]] ''munnawhatteaûg'', derived from ''munnohquohteau'' (&quot;he fertilizes&quot;), referring to their use of the fish as [[fertilizer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;conservationmagazine1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.conservationmagazine.org/2012/12/the-oiliest-catch/ |title=The Oiliest Catch |last=Conniff|first=Richard|author-link=Richard Conniff |date=December 7, 2012 |website=Conservation Magazine |publisher=[[University of Washington]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131035501/https://www.conservationmagazine.org/2012/12/the-oiliest-catch/|archive-date=January 31, 2016|url-status=live|access-date=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally thought that [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] were advised by Tisquantum (also known as [[Squanto]]) to plant menhaden with their crops.&lt;ref name=&quot;conservationmagazine1&quot;/&gt;

==Description==
Menhaden are flat and have soft flesh and a deeply forked tail. They rarely exceed {{convert|15|in|cm}} in length, and have a varied weight range. [[Gulf menhaden]] and [[Atlantic menhaden]] are small oily-fleshed fish, bright silver, and characterized by a series of smaller spots behind the main, humeral spot. They tend to have larger scales than yellowfin menhaden and finescale menhaden. In addition, yellowfin menhaden tail rays are a bright yellow in contrast to those of the Atlantic menhaden.

==Taxonomy==
{{common fish}}

Recent taxonomic work using [[DNA]] comparisons have organized the North American menhadens into large-scaled (Gulf and Atlantic menhaden) and small-scaled (Finescale and Yellowfin menhaden) designations.&lt;ref name=&quot;anderson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Joel D.|year=2007|title=Systematics of the North American menhadens: molecular evolutionary reconstructions in the genus Brevoortia (Clupeiformes: Clupeidae)|url=http://fishbull.noaa.gov/1053/anderson.pdf|url-status=dead|journal=[[Fishery Bulletin]]|volume=105|issue=3|pages=368–378|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721060036/http://fishbull.noaa.gov/1053/anderson.pdf|archive-date=July 21, 2011|access-date=February 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The menhaden consist of two genera and seven species:

==Distribution==
* Finescale menhaden range from the [[Yucatán]] to [[Louisiana]]
* Yellowfin menhaden range from [[Louisiana]] to [[Virginia]]
* [[Gulf menhaden]] range from the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], [[Mexico]] to [[Tampa Bay]], [[Florida]]
* [[Atlantic menhaden]] range from [[Jupiter Inlet]], [[Florida]], to [[Nova Scotia]]; Atlantic menhaden seasonally migrate along the coast; in June, mature adults typically are in the northern portion of the coastline with sub-adults and juveniles located in the southern portion
* The various species of menhaden occur anywhere from [[estuary|estuarine waters]] outward to the [[continental shelf]]; menhaden grow in less saline waters of estuaries and may be found in bays and lagoons, as well as at river mouths; adults appear to prefer water temperatures near 18&amp;nbsp;°C

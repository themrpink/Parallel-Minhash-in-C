==Postures==
According to Donn F. Draeger, iaijutsu is a combative art and, therefore, the warrior considered only two starting positions in the execution of a sword-drawing technique. The first technique is the low crouching posture named ''iai-goshi''. The second is the standing posture named ''tachi-ai''.&lt;ref name=&quot;draeger2007&quot; /&gt;{{rp|50}}

The seated posture, ''tate-hiza'', is not used in iaijutsu because it does not permit all-around mobility. ''Seiza'', the formal kneeling-sitting posture, is not used because it is a &quot;dead&quot; posture which is regarded by the warrior as less combatively efficient. It would be difficult for the swordsman using either of these two latter postures to go quickly into action in an emergency.&lt;ref name=&quot;draeger2007&quot; /&gt;{{rp|50}}

{{Nihongo|'''''Kenjutsu'''''|剣術}} is the umbrella term for all (''[[ko-budō]]'') schools of '''Japanese swordsmanship''', in particular those that predate the [[Meiji Restoration]]. Some modern styles of [[kendo]] and [[iaido]] that were established in the 20th century also included modern forms of kenjutsu in their curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Budden| first = Paul| title = Looking at a Far Mountain: A Study of Kendo Kata| year = 2000| publisher = Tuttle Pub| isbn = 978-0-8048-3245-8| pages = 9, 12, 14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenjutsu, which originated with the [[samurai]] class of feudal Japan,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=P-Nv_LUi6KgC&amp;pg=PA600&amp;dq=Kenjutsu&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=x-1AT9DDNMiTtwf_qezABQ&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Kenjutsu&amp;f=true ''Martial Arts of the World: An Encyclopedia of History and Innovation'', Volume 2, Martial Arts of the World: An Encyclopedia of History and Innovation, Thomas A.

This is opposed to [[kendo]], which means &quot;the way of the sword&quot; and uses a bamboo sword ([[shinai]]) and protective armour (bōgu).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ozawa97&quot;&gt;
{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aRQoz5S_OhIC&amp;q=Ozawa%2C+Hiroshi+%281997%29.+Kendo+The+definitive+guide.+United+Kingdom%3A+Kodansha+Europe.+ISBN+4-7700-2119-4&amp;pg=PR4|title=Kendo The definitive guide|last=Ozawa|first=Hiroshi|publisher=Kodansha Europe|year=1997|isbn=4-7700-2119-4|location=United Kingdom|pages=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact activities and conventions undertaken when practicing ''kenjutsu'' vary from school to school, where the word school here refers to the practice, methods, ethics, and metaphysics of a given tradition, yet commonly include practice of battlefield techniques without an opponent and techniques whereby two practitioners perform ''[[kata]]'' (featuring full contact strikes to the body in some styles and no body contact strikes permitted in others).&lt;ref&gt;Contact striking during kata is used for example in [[Itto Ryu|Ono Ha Ittō-ryū]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Although kata training has always been the mainstay, in later periods, schools incorporated [[sparring]] under a variety of conditions, from using solid wooden ''[[bokutō]]'' to the use of a bamboo sword (''[[shinai]]'') and armor (''[[bōgu]]'').&lt;ref name='Ozawa97' /&gt;{{rp|XII, XIII}} In modern times sparring in Japanese [[martial art]] is more strongly associated with kendo and is mainly practiced by students or the police force. Although kendo is common in Japan, it is also practiced in other countries around the world.

==History==

===Early development===
{{refimprove section|date=February 2011}}
It is thought likely that the first iron swords were manufactured in Japan in the fourth century, based on technology imported from [[China]] via the [[Korean peninsula]].&lt;ref name='Ozawa2005'&gt;
{{cite book

|first= Hiroshi

|pages= 1
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} While swords clearly played an important cultural and religious role in ancient Japan,&lt;ref name='Ozawa2005'/&gt;{{rp|5, 14}} in the [[Heian period]] the globally recognised curved Japanese sword (the katana) was developed and swords became important weapons and symbolic items.&lt;ref name='Ozawa2005'/&gt;{{rp|15}} The oldest schools in existence today arose in the [[Muromachi period]] (1336 to 1573), known for long periods of inter-state warfare. Three major schools emerged during this period.&lt;ref name='Ozawa97'/&gt;{{rp|XII}}

* [[Kage-ryū (Aizu)]] (Aisukage ryū)
*[[Chujō-ryū|Chūjō-ryū]]
* [[Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū]]

These schools form the ancestors for many descendent styles, for example, from Ittō ryū has branched Ono-ha Ittō ryū and Mizoguchi-ha Ittō-ryū (among many others).

On the island of Okinawa, the art of Udundi includes a unique method of both Kenjutsu and [[Iaijutsu]]. This is the only surviving sword system from Okinawa. It was the martial art of the noble Motobu family during the Ryukyu Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.motobu-ryu.org/motobu-udundi/about-motobu-udundi/|title=About Motobu Udundi|website=本部流 - Motobu-ryu -|language=ja-JP|access-date=2019-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edo period===
During the [[Edo period]] schools proliferated to number more than 500,&lt;ref name='Ozawa97'/&gt;{{rp|XIII}} and training techniques and equipment advanced. The 19th century led to the development of the bamboo practice sword, the ''shinai'', and protective armor, ''bogu''. This allowed practice of full speed techniques in sparring, while reducing risk of serious harm to the practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last =Kindersley | first =Dorling | title =Swords | publisher =Dorling Kindersley Ltd | year =2010 | pages =286 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=Vfhw5Au5RJEC&amp;q=kenjutsu&amp;pg=PA286| isbn =978-1-4053-5136-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this, training in Kenjutsu had consisted mainly of basic technique practice and paired ''[[kata]]'', using solid wooden practice swords (''[[bokutō]]'') or live blades.&lt;ref name='Ozawa97'/&gt;{{rp|XIII}}

===Decline===
Beginning in 1868, the Meiji Restoration led to the breakup of the military class and the modernization of Japan along the lines of western industrial nations. As the ''[[samurai]]'' class was officially dissolved at this time, ''kenjutsu'' fell into decline, an unpopular reminder of the past.&lt;ref name='Ozawa97'/&gt;{{rp|XIII, XIV}} This decline continued for approximately 20 years, until rising national confidence led to an increase of the uptake of traditional sword arts again, particularly in the military and the police.

In 1886 the [[Japanese Police]] gathered together ''kata'' from a variety of ''kenjutsu'' schools into a standardised set for training purposes.&lt;ref name='Budden2000'&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}} This process of standardization of martial training continued when, in 1895, a body for martial arts in Japan, the [[Dai Nippon Butoku Kai]], was established. Work on standardizing ''kenjutsu'' ''kata'' continued for years, with several groups involved&lt;ref name='Budden2000'/&gt;{{rp|11,12}} until in 1912 an edict was released by the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai. This edict highlighted a lack of unity in teaching and introduced a standard core teaching curriculum to which the individual ''kenjutsu'' schools would add their distinctive techniques. This core curriculum, and its ten ''kata'' evolved into the modern martial art of ''kendo''.&lt;ref name='Budden2000'/&gt;{{rp|11,14}} This point could be regarded as the end of the development of Kendo. Kata was provided for the unification of many schools to enable them to pass on the techniques and spirit of the Japanese sword.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =The History of Kendo| publisher =All Japan Kendo Federation| url =http://www.kendo-fik.org/english-page/english-page2/brief-history-of-kendo.htm| accessdate =19 February 2012| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20120206071600/http://www.kendo-fik.org/english-page/english-page2/brief-history-of-kendo.htm| archive-date =6 February 2012| url-status =dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th and 21st century===

With the increasing interest in Japanese martial arts outside Japan during the 20th century, people in other countries started taking an interest in kenjutsu. 

==Weapons==
One of the more common training weapons is the wooden sword [[Bokken|(''bokuto'' or ''bokken'')]]. For various reasons, many schools make use of very specifically designed ''bokuto'', altering its shape, weight and length according to the style's specifications. For example, ''bokuto'' used within [[Yagyū Shinkage-ryū]] are relatively thin and without a handguard in order to match the school's characteristic approach to combat. Alternatively, Kashima Shin-ryū practitioners use a thicker than average ''bokuto'' with no curvature and with a rather large hilt. This of course lends itself well to Kashima Shin-ryū's distinct principles of combat.

Some schools practice with ''fukuro'' ''[[shinai]]'' (a bamboo sword covered with leather or cloth) under circumstances where the student lacks the ability to safely control a ''bokuto'' at full speed or as a general safety precaution. In fact, the ''fukuro shinai'' dates as far back as the 15th century.

==''Nitōjutsu''==
[[File:Kenjutsu at the Japanese Garden 04.jpg|thumb|right|An example of modern ''nitōjutsu'' practice.]]A distinguishing feature of many kenjutsu syllabi is the use of a paired katana or ''[[Daitō (long sword)|daitō]]'' and wakizashi or ''[[Shoto (sword)|shōtō]],'' commonly referred to as {{Nihongo|''nitōjutsu''|二刀術|two sword methods}}. Styles that teach it are called {{Nihongo|''nitōryū''|二刀流|two sword school}}; contrast {{Nihongo|''ittō-ryū''|一刀流|one sword school}}.

The most famous exponent of ''nitōjutsu'' was [[Miyamoto Musashi]] (1584 &amp;ndash; 1645), the founder of [[Hyōhō Niten Ichi-ryū]], who advocates it in ''[[The Book of Five Rings]]''. ''Nitōjutsu'' is not however unique to Hyoho Niten Ichi-ryū, nor was ''nitōjutsu'' the creation of Musashi. Both Tenshin Shōden Katori Shinto-ryū were founded in the early [[Muromachi period]] (ca. 1447), and [[Tatsumi-ryu]] founded [[Eishō (Muromachi period)|Eishō]] period (1504–1521), contain extensive two-sword curricula while also preceding the establishment of Musashi’s school.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZzIXkFec0e8C&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=musashi+nitoken&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pjKQUPDkKcrI0AWpz4CAAg&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=musashi%20nitoken&amp;f=false Serge Mol, 2003, ''Classical Weaponry of Japan: Special Weapons and Tactics of the Martial Arts'' Kodansha International Ltd], {{ISBN|4-7700-2941-1}} (pp.22-23)&lt;/ref&gt;

Commando '''Unit 101''' ({{lang-he-n|יחידה 101}}) was a [[special forces]] unit of the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] (IDF), founded and commanded by [[Ariel Sharon]] on orders from [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]] [[David Ben-Gurion]] in August 1953.&lt;ref name=&quot;Specwar&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.specwar.info/special_forces/Unit_101/|title=Unit 101 |publisher=Specwar.info |accessdate=2009-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were armed with non-standard weapons and tasked with carrying out [[retribution operations]] across the state's borders—in particular, establishing small unit maneuvers, activation and insertion tactics.

Members of the unit were recruited only from agricultural [[kibbutz]]im and [[moshav]]im. Membership in the unit was by invitation only, and any new member had to be voted on by all existing members before they were accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halevi&quot;&gt;Yossi Klein Halevi, ''Like Dreamers'', (New York, 2013), pages 42–43&lt;/ref&gt;

The unit was merged into the [[Paratroopers Brigade|890th Paratroop Battalion]] during January 1954, on orders of General [[Moshe Dayan]], Chief of Staff, because he wanted their experience and spirit to be spread among all infantry units of IDF starting with the [[Paratroopers Brigade|paratroopers]]. They are considered to have had a significant influence on the development of subsequent Israeli infantry-oriented units.&lt;ref name=&quot;Israeli Special Forces History&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/special.html|title=Jewish Virtual Library&amp;nbsp;— Israeli Special Forces History|accessdate=2009-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Following the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], Israel was faced with cross-border raids and infiltrations by Arab militants and non-militants respectively. Many of these were small scale infiltrations that consisted of unarmed Palestinian refugees attempting to rejoin their families and of smugglers bringing in contraband for Israeli markets.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNS/636&quot;&gt;'No one would deny that the Israel authorities would be justified, and are justified, in using strong measures to check (infiltration), in so far as damage to property or loss of life results. But not everyone who crosses the armistice demarcation line does so with criminal intent. Acts of violence are indeed committed, but as the volume of illegal crossings of the demarcation line is so considerable, if one is to judge from the available statistics, it seems probable that ''many crossings are carried out by persons – sometimes, I understand, even by children – with no criminal object in view''.

Sharon was given the rank of Major and chosen to command the company-sized unit, with [[Shlomo Baum]] as deputy in command. The unit was to consist of 50 men, most of them former [[Paratroopers Brigade|Tzanhanim]] and Unit 30 personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unit 101 (history) - Specwar.info &quot;/&gt; They were armed with non-standard weapons and tasked with carrying out special reprisals across the state's borders—mainly establishing small unit maneuvers, activation and insertion tactics that are utilized even today.{{sfn|Morris|1993|pages=251–253}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Unit 101 (history) - Specwar.info &quot;/&gt;

The new unit began a hard process of day and night training.&lt;ref name=&quot;The roots of Ariel Sharon's legacy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/print/2006/779/re91.htm|title=The roots of Ariel Sharon's legacy|date=26 January 2006|work=al-Ahram|accessdate=2009-09-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807144422/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/print/2006/779/re91.htm|archivedate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of their exercises frequently took them across the border, as enemy engagement was seen as the best preparation. The recruits went on forced marches and undertook weapons and sabotage training at their base camp at [[Sataf]], a depopulated Arab village just west of [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The roots of Ariel Sharon's legacy&quot; /&gt;

'''In addition to the unit's tactical variation, they were also unique in two ways''':&lt;ref name=&quot;Specwar&quot; /&gt;
* They were first IDF Special Forces unit formed from scratch, rather than modify a previously existing infantry oriented unit—such as with the [[Golani Brigade]] Special Reconnaissance Platoon.
* No other unit ever before received its orders directly from the [[General Staff (Israel)|IDF General Staff]]—the IDF High Command MATKAL, rather than from a lower sub-command.

Originally T'zanhanim ({{lang-he|הצנחנים}}, ''Paratroopers'') company's officers were the biggest opposition against the creation of Unit 101.&lt;ref name=&quot;Israeli Special Forces History&quot; /&gt; The reason for this was simply that they didn't want another competitor for retaliation missions. Before the formation of Unit 101 only they undertook these missions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Israeli Special Forces History&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Unit 101 (history) - Specwar.info &quot;/&gt; One of the unit's tactical commanders was [[Meir Har-Zion]], who was later awarded the rank of an officer solely for his conduct in battle. The tactics of Unit 101 was politically very effective and soon the fighters simply could not keep up with the attrition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Specwar&quot; /&gt;

This meant that the attacks on Israel decreased and the political objective of Unit 101 was accomplished. The creation of Unit 101 was a major landmark in the Israeli Special Forces history. Beside the [[Sayeret Matkal]], they are considered to be the unit with the most influence on the Israeli infantry oriented units including both special and conventional units.&lt;ref name=&quot;Israeli Special Forces History&quot; /&gt;

==Recruitment==
Members of the unit were recruited exclusively from agricultural [[kibbutz]]im and [[moshav]]im, with the view that only those who were raised as farmers on the land had the spirit to defend it. Membership in the unit was by invitation only, and any new member had to be voted on by all existing members before they were accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halevi&quot; /&gt;

According to [[Yoav Gelber]], after one month of training a patrol of Unit 101 infiltrated into the [[Gaza Strip]] as an exercise.&lt;ref name=&quot;The roots of Ariel Sharon's legacy&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aisisraelstudies.org/2006papers/Gelber%20Yoav%202006.pdf Yoav Gelber, 2006, &quot;Sharon's Inheritance&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605014133/http://www.aisisraelstudies.org/2006papers/Gelber%20Yoav%202006.pdf |date=June 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources estimate that a result of the infiltration was 20 killed Arabs.

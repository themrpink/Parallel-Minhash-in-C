Redundant characters accompanying biliteral or triliteral signs are called ''[[phonetic complements]]'' (or complementaries). They can be placed in front of the sign (rarely), after the sign (as a general rule), or even framing it (appearing both before and after). Ancient Egyptian scribes consistently avoided leaving large areas of blank space in their writing, and might add additional phonetic complements or sometimes even invert the order of signs if this would result in a more aesthetically pleasing appearance (good scribes attended to the artistic, and even religious, aspects of the hieroglyphs, and would not simply view them as a communication tool). Various examples of the use of phonetic complements can be seen below:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
: &lt;hiero&gt;S43-d-w&lt;/hiero&gt; – ''md +d +w'' (the complementary ''d'' is placed after the sign) → it reads ''mdw'', meaning &quot;tongue&quot;.

: &lt;hiero&gt;x:p-xpr:r-i-A40&lt;/hiero&gt; – ''ḫ +p +ḫpr +r +j'' (the four complementaries frame the triliteral sign of the [[Dung beetle#Scarab in ancient Egypt|scarab]] beetle) → it reads ''ḫpr.j'', meaning the name &quot;[[Khepri]]&quot;, with the final glyph being the determinative for 'ruler or god'.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Notably, phonetic complements were also used to allow the reader to differentiate between signs that are [[homophones]], or which do not always have a unique reading. For example, the symbol of &quot;the seat&quot; (or chair):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
: &lt;hiero&gt;Q1&lt;/hiero&gt; – This can be read ''st'', ''ws'' and ''ḥtm'', according to the word in which it is found. The presence of phonetic complements—and of the suitable determinative—allows the reader to know which of the three readings to choose:

:*1st Reading: '''st''' – &lt;hiero&gt;Q1-t:pr&lt;/hiero&gt; – ''st'', written ''st+t''; the last character is the determinative of &quot;the house&quot; or that which is found there, meaning &quot;seat, throne, place&quot;;

&lt;!-- EXAMPLE 1st Reading --&gt;
::: &lt;hiero&gt;Q1-t:H8&lt;/hiero&gt; – ''st'' (written ''st+t''; the &quot;egg&quot; determinative is used for female personal names in some periods), meaning &quot;[[Isis]]&quot;;

:*2nd Reading: '''ws''' – &lt;hiero&gt;Q1:ir-A40&lt;/hiero&gt; – ''wsjr'' (written ''ws''+''jr'', with, as a phonetic complement, &quot;the eye&quot;, which is read ''jr'', following the determinative of &quot;god&quot;), meaning &quot;[[Osiris]]&quot;;

:*3rd Reading: '''ḥtm''' – &lt;hiero&gt;H-Q1-m:t-E17&lt;/hiero&gt; – ''ḥtm.t'' (written ''ḥ+ḥtm+m+t'', with the determinative of &quot;Anubis&quot; or &quot;the jackal&quot;), meaning a kind of wild animal;

&lt;!-- EXAMPLE 3rd Reading --&gt;
::: &lt;hiero&gt;H-Q1-t-G41&lt;/hiero&gt; – ''ḥtm'' (written ''ḥ +ḥtm +t'', with the determinative of the flying bird), meaning &quot;to disappear&quot;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Finally, it sometimes happens that the pronunciation of words might be changed because of their connection to Ancient Egyptian: in this case, it is not rare for writing to adopt a compromise in notation, the two readings being indicated jointly. For example, the adjective ''bnj'', &quot;sweet&quot;, became ''bnr''. In Middle Egyptian, one can write:
::: &lt;hiero&gt;b-n:r-i-M30&lt;/hiero&gt; – ''bnrj'' (written ''b+n+r+i'', with determinative)

which is fully read as ''bnr'', the ''j'' not being pronounced but retained in order to keep a written connection with the ancient word (in the same fashion as the [[English language]] words ''through'', ''knife'', or ''victuals'', which are no longer pronounced the way they are written.)

===Semantic reading===
[[File:Comparative evolution of Cuneiform, Egyptian and Chinese characters.jpg|thumb|Comparative evolution from pictograms to abstract shapes, in cuneiform, Egyptian and Chinese characters]]
Besides a phonetic interpretation, characters can also be read for their meaning: in this instance, [[logogram]]s are being spoken (or [[ideogram]]s) and ''semagrams'' (the latter are also called determinatives).{{Clarify|reason=sentence is ungrammatical or incomplete|date=September 2019}}&lt;ref name=Loprieno13&gt;Antonio Loprieno, Ancient Egyptian, A Linguistic Introduction, [[Cambridge University Press]] (1995), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

====Logograms====
A hieroglyph used as a [[logogram]] defines the object of which it is an image. Logograms are therefore the most frequently used common nouns; they are always accompanied by a mute vertical stroke indicating their status as a logogram (the usage of a vertical stroke is further explained below); in theory, all hieroglyphs would have the ability to be used as logograms. Logograms can be accompanied by phonetic complements. Here are some examples:

:*&lt;hiero&gt;ra:Z1&lt;/hiero&gt; – ''rꜥ'', meaning &quot;sun&quot;;

:*&lt;hiero&gt;pr:Z1&lt;/hiero&gt; – ''pr'', meaning &quot;house&quot;;

:*&lt;hiero&gt;sw-t:Z1&lt;/hiero&gt; – ''swt'' (''sw''+''t''), meaning &quot;reed&quot;;

:*&lt;hiero&gt;Dw:Z1&lt;/hiero&gt; – ''ḏw'', meaning &quot;mountain&quot;.

In some cases, the semantic connection is indirect ([[metonymic]] or [[metaphor]]ic):

:*&lt;hiero&gt;nTr-Z1&lt;/hiero&gt; – ''nṯr'', meaning &quot;god&quot;; the character in fact represents a temple flag (standard);

:*&lt;hiero&gt;G53-Z1&lt;/hiero&gt; – ''bꜣ'', meaning &quot;[[Ba (Egyptian soul)|Bâ]]&quot; (soul); the character is the traditional representation of a &quot;bâ&quot; (a bird with a human head);

:*&lt;hiero&gt;G27-Z1&lt;/hiero&gt; – ''dšr'', meaning &quot;flamingo&quot;; the corresponding phonogram means &quot;red&quot; and the bird is associated by [[metonymy]] with this color.

====Determinatives====
[[Determinative]]s or semagrams (semantic symbols specifying meaning) are placed at the end of a word. These mute characters serve to clarify what the word is about, as [[homophone|homophonic]] glyphs are common. If a similar procedure existed in English, words with the same spelling would be followed by an indicator that would not be read, but which would fine-tune the meaning: &quot;retort [chemistry]&quot; and &quot;retort [rhetoric]&quot; would thus be distinguished.&lt;!--

&lt;div&gt;&lt;!-- division to keep embedded hieroglyphs within text --&gt;
A number of determinatives exist: divinities, humans, parts of the human body, animals, plants, etc. Certain determinatives possess a [[Literal and figurative language|literal and a figurative meaning]]. For example, a roll of papyrus, &lt;hiero&gt;Y1&lt;/hiero&gt; &amp;nbsp; is used to define &quot;books&quot; but also abstract ideas. The determinative of the [[plural]] is a shortcut to signal three occurrences of the word, that is to say, its plural (since the Egyptian language had a dual, sometimes indicated by two strokes). This special character is explained below.&lt;/div&gt;

[[File:Extract from the Tale of the Two Brothers.jpg|thumb|Extract from the ''[[Tale of the Two Brothers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Budge |first1=Wallis |title=Egyptian Language |date=1889 |pages=38–42 |url=https://archive.org/details/EgyptianLanguage/page/n49/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Here, are several examples of the use of determinatives borrowed from the book, ''Je lis les hiéroglyphes'' (&quot;I am reading hieroglyphs&quot;) by Jean Capart, which illustrate their importance:

*&lt;hiero&gt;nfr-w-A17-Z3&lt;/hiero&gt; – ''nfrw'' (''w'' and the three strokes are the marks of the plural): [literally] &quot;the beautiful young people&quot;, that is to say, the young military recruits. The word has a [[child (hieroglyph)|young-person determinative]] symbol: &lt;small&gt;&lt;hiero&gt;A17&lt;/hiero&gt;&lt;/small&gt; – which is the determinative indicating babies and children;
*&lt;hiero&gt;nfr-f:r:t-B1&lt;/hiero&gt; – ''nfr.t'' (''.t'' is here the suffix that forms the feminine): meaning &quot;the nubile young woman&quot;, with &lt;hiero&gt;B1&lt;/hiero&gt; as the determinative indicating a woman;
*&lt;hiero&gt;nfr-nfr-nfr-pr&lt;/hiero&gt; – ''nfrw'' (the tripling of the character serving to express the plural, [[Inflection|flexional]] ending ''w'') : meaning &quot;foundations (of a house)&quot;, with the house as a determinative, &lt;hiero&gt;pr&lt;/hiero&gt;;
*&lt;hiero&gt;nfr-f:r-S28&lt;/hiero&gt; – ''nfr'' : meaning &quot;clothing&quot; with &lt;small&gt;&lt;hiero&gt;S28&lt;/hiero&gt;&lt;/small&gt; &amp;nbsp; as the determinative for lengths of cloth;
*&lt;hiero&gt;nfr-W22:Z2ss&lt;/hiero&gt; – ''nfr'' : meaning &quot;wine&quot; or &quot;beer&quot;; with a jug &lt;hiero&gt;W22&lt;/hiero&gt; &amp;nbsp; as the determinative.

All these words have a meliorative connotation: &quot;good, beautiful, perfect&quot;. The ''Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian'' by Raymond A. Faulkner, gives some twenty words that are read ''nfr'' or which are formed from this word.

===Additional signs===

====Cartouche====
[[File:LuxorTemple03.jpg|thumb|alt=Inscribed hieroglyphics cover an obelisk in foreground. A stone statue is in background.|Egyptian hieroglyphs with [[cartouche]]s for the name [[Ramesses II]], from the [[Luxor Temple]], [[New Kingdom]]]]
Rarely, the names of gods are placed within a [[cartouche]]; the two last names of the sitting king are always placed within a cartouche:

&lt;hiero&gt;&lt; N5:Z1-i-Y5:n-A40 &gt;&lt;/hiero&gt;
jmn-rꜥ, &quot;Amon-Ra&quot;;

&lt;hiero&gt;&lt; q:E23-i-V4-p:d:r-A-t:H8 &gt;&lt;/hiero&gt;
qljwꜣpdrꜣ.t, &quot;Cleopatra&quot;;

====Filling stroke====
A filling stroke is a character indicating the end of a [[quadrat (hieroglyph block)|quadrat]] that would otherwise be incomplete.

===Signs joined together===
Some signs are the contraction of several others. These signs have, however, a function and existence of their own: for example, a forearm where the hand holds a scepter is used as a determinative for words meaning &quot;to direct, to drive&quot; and their derivatives.

====Doubling====
The doubling of a sign indicates its dual; the [[list of Egyptian hieroglyphs by common name: M-Z#P|tripling of a sign]] indicates its plural.

===Grammatical signs===
*The vertical stroke indicates that the sign is a logogram.
*Two strokes indicate the dual number, and the three strokes the plural.
*The direct notation of flexional endings, for example: &lt;hiero&gt;W&lt;/hiero&gt; &lt;!-- (Z7)--&gt;

==Spelling==
Standard [[orthography]]—&quot;correct&quot; spelling—in Egyptian is much looser than in modern languages. In fact, one or several variants exist for almost every word. One finds:

*Redundancies;
*Omission of [[graphemes]], which are ignored whether or not they are intentional;
*Substitutions of one grapheme for another, such that it is impossible to distinguish a &quot;mistake&quot; from an &quot;alternate spelling&quot;;
*Errors of omission in the drawing of signs, which are much more problematic when the writing is cursive (hieratic) writing, but especially demotic, where the schematization of the signs is extreme.

However, many of these apparent spelling errors constitute an issue of chronology. Spelling and standards varied over time, so the writing of a word during the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] might be considerably different during the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]. Furthermore, the Egyptians were perfectly content to include older orthography (&quot;historical spelling&quot;) alongside newer practices, as though it were acceptable in English to use archaic spellings in modern texts. Most often, ancient &quot;spelling errors&quot; are simply misinterpretations of context. Today, hieroglyphicists use numerous cataloguing systems (notably the ''[[Manuel de Codage]]'' and ''[[Gardiner's Sign List]]'') to clarify the presence of determinatives, ideograms, and other ambiguous signs in transliteration.

==Simple examples==
{{Hiero/1cartouche|align=left|era=ok|name=[[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemy]]|nomen=&lt;hiero&gt;p:t-wA-l:M-i-i-s&lt;/hiero&gt;}}

The glyphs in this [[cartouche]] are transliterated as:
{|
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:middle;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;
| p&lt;br /&gt;t
| &quot;ua&quot;
| l&lt;br /&gt;m
| y (ii) s
|
|&lt;br /&gt;
|&lt;br /&gt;
'''Ptolmys'''
|}

though ''ii'' is considered a single letter and transliterated ''y''.

Another way in which hieroglyphs work is illustrated by the two Egyptian words pronounced ''pr'' (usually vocalised as ''per''). One word is 'house', and its hieroglyphic representation is straightforward:
&lt;hiero&gt;pr:Z1&lt;/hiero&gt;
[[File:Name of Alexander the Great in Hieroglyphs circa 330 BCE.jpg|thumb|Name of [[Alexander the Great]] in hieroglyphs, {{circa|332&amp;nbsp;BC}}, Egypt. [[Louvre Museum]]]]
Here, the 'house' hieroglyph works as a logogram: it represents the word with a single sign. The vertical stroke below the hieroglyph is a common way of indicating that a glyph is working as a logogram.

Another word ''pr'' is the verb 'to go out, leave'. When this word is written, the 'house' hieroglyph is used as a phonetic symbol:
&lt;hiero&gt;pr:r-D54&lt;/hiero&gt;
Here, the 'house' glyph stands for the consonants ''pr''. The 'mouth' glyph below it is a ''phonetic complement:'' it is read as ''r'', reinforcing the phonetic reading of ''pr''. The third hieroglyph is a ''determinative'': it is an [[ideogram]] for verbs of motion that gives the reader an idea of the meaning of the word.

=={{anchor|Encoding}}Encoding and font support==
Egyptian hieroglyphs were added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in October 2009 with the release of version 5.2 which introduced the [[Egyptian Hieroglyphs (Unicode block)|Egyptian Hieroglyphs]] block (U+13000–U+1342F) with 1,071 defined characters.

{{As of|2013|July}}, four fonts, ''Aegyptus'', ''NewGardiner'', ''[[Noto fonts|Noto]] Sans Egyptian Hieroglyphs'' and ''JSeshFont'' support this range. Another font, ''[[Segoe UI Historic]]'', comes bundled with Windows 10 and also contains glyphs for the Egyptian Hieroglyphs block. Segoe UI Historic excludes three  glyphs depicting [[phallus]] ( [[Gardiner's sign list|Gardiner's]] [[List of Egyptian hieroglyphs#D|D52]], D52A D53, Unicode code points U+130B8–U+130BA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.spludlow.co.uk/DrawPrint/Fonts.aspx#_Toc513634469|title=Segoe UI Historic Phallus Microsoft Censorship - Fonts in the Spludlow Framework|website=www.spludlow.co.uk|access-date=2019-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

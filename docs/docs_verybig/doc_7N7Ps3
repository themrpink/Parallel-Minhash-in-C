The '''dalton''' or '''unified atomic mass unit''' (symbols: '''Da''' or '''u''') is a [[unit of measurement|unit]] of [[mass]] widely used in physics and chemistry. It is defined as 1/12 of the mass of an [[chemical bond|unbound]] neutral atom of [[carbon-12]] in its nuclear and electronic [[ground state]] and [[invariant mass|at rest]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bipm9th&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;goldbAtMaCo&quot; /&gt; The '''atomic mass constant''', denoted ''m''&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;  is defined identically, giving {{nowrap|1=''m''&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m''({{sup|12}}C)/12 = 1 Da}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Barry N Taylor|year=2009|title=Molar mass and related quantities in the New SI|journal=Metrologia|volume=46|issue=3|pages=L16–L19|url=https://tsapps.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=901156|doi=10.1088/0026-1394/46/3/L01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This unit is commonly used in [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] to express the mass of atomic-scale objects, such as [[atom]]s, [[molecule]]s, and [[elementary particle]]s, both for discrete instances and multiple types of ensemble averages. For example, an atom of [[helium-4]] has a mass of {{val|4.0026|u=Da}}. This is an intrinsic property of the isotope and all helium-4 have the same mass. [[aspirin|Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin)]], {{chem|C|9|H|8|O|4}}, has an average mass of approximately {{val|180.157|u=Da}}. However, there are no acetylsalicylic acid molecules with this mass. The two most common masses of individual acetylsalicylic acid molecules are {{val|180.04228|u=Da}} and {{val|181.04565|u=Da}}. 

The [[molecular mass]]es of [[protein]]s, [[nucleic acid]]s, and other large [[polymer]]s are often expressed with the units [[Kilo-|kilo]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;daltons (kDa), [[Mega-|mega]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;daltons (MDa), etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;berg2007p35&quot; /&gt; [[Titin]], one of the largest known [[protein]]s, has a molecular mass of between 3 and 3.7 megadaltons.&lt;ref name=&quot;opitz2003&quot; /&gt; The DNA of [[chromosome 1]] in the [[human genome]] has about 249 million [[base pair]]s, each with an average mass of about {{val|650|u=Da}}, or {{val|156|u=GDa}} total.&lt;ref name=&quot;molfat&quot; /&gt;

The [[Mole (unit)|mole]] is a unit of [[amount of substance]], widely used in chemistry and physics, which was originally defined so that the mass of one mole of a substance, measured in grams, would be numerically equal to the average mass of one of its constituent particles, measured in daltons. That is, the [[molar mass]] of a chemical compound was meant to be numerically equal to its average molecular mass.  For example, the average mass of one molecule of [[water]] is about 18.0153 daltons, and one mole of water is about 18.0153 grams.  A protein whose molecule has an average mass of {{val|64|u=kDa}} would have a molar mass of {{val|64|u=kg/mol}}. However, while this equality can be assumed for almost all practical purposes, it is now only approximate, because of [[2019 redefinition of the SI base units|the way mole was redefined on 20 May 2019]].&lt;ref name=&quot;berg2007p35&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bipm9th&quot; /&gt;

In general, the mass in daltons of an atom is numerically close, but not exactly equal to the [[atomic mass number|number of nucleons]] ''A'' contained in its [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. It follows that the molar mass of a compound (grams per mole) is numerically close to the average number of nucleons contained in each molecule. By definition, the mass of an atom of [[carbon-12]] is 12 daltons, which corresponds with the number of nucleons that it has (6 [[proton]]s and 6 [[neutron]]s). However, the mass of an atomic-scale object is affected by the [[binding energy]] of the nucleons in its atomic nuclei, as well as the mass and binding energy of its [[electron]]s.  Therefore, this equality holds only for the carbon-12 atom in the stated conditions, and will vary for other substances. For example, the mass of one unbound atom of the common [[hydrogen]] [[isotope]] ([[hydrogen-1]], protium) is {{val|1.007825032241|(94)|u=Da}}, the mass of one free neutron is {{physconst|mnDa|after=,}} and the mass of one [[hydrogen-2]] (deuterium) atom is {{val|2.014101778114|(122)|u=Da}}.&lt;ref name=wang2017ii/&gt;  In general, the difference ([[mass defect]]) is less than 0.1%; exceptions include hydrogen-1 (about 0.8%), [[helium-3]] (0.5%), [[lithium]] (0.25%) and [[beryllium]] (0.15%). 

The unified atomic mass unit and the dalton should not be confused with the unit of mass in the [[atomic units system]]s, which is instead the [[electron rest mass]] (''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;).

==Energy equivalents==
The atomic mass constant can also be expressed as its [[mass–energy equivalence|energy equivalent]], that is ''m''&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The 2018 CODATA recommended values are:
:{{physconst|muc2}}
:{{physconst|mueV}}
The [[Electronvolt|megaelectronvolt]] (MeV) is commonly used as a unit of mass in [[particle physics]], and these values are also important for the practical determination of relative atomic masses.

==History==

===Origin of the concept===

[[File:Jean Perrin 1926.jpg|right|thumb|Jean Perrin in 1926]]
The interpretation of the [[law of definite proportions]] in terms of the [[atomic theory of matter]] implied that the masses of atoms of various elements had definite ratios that depended on the elements.  While the actual masses were unknown, the relative masses could be deduced from that law.  In 1803 [[John Dalton]] proposed to use the (still unknown) atomic mass of the lightest atom, that of hydrogen, as the natural unit of atomic mass.  This was the basis of the [[standard atomic weight|atomic weight scale]].&lt;ref name=petley1989/&gt;

For technical reasons, in 1898, chemist [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] and others proposed to redefine the unit of atomic mass as 1/16 of the mass of an oxygen atom.&lt;ref name=hold2004/&gt;  That proposal was formally adopted by the [[Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights|International Committee on Atomic Weights]] (ICAW) in 1903. That was approximately the mass of one hydrogen atom, but oxygen was more amenable to experimental determination.  This suggestion was made before the discovery of the existence of elemental isotopes, which occurred in 1912.&lt;ref name=petley1989/&gt;  The same definition was adopted in 1909 the physicist [[Jean Baptiste Perrin|Jean Perrin]] in his extensive experiments to determine the atomic masses and Avogadro's constant.&lt;ref name=perrin1909/&gt;  This definition remained unchanged until 1961.&lt;ref name=chang2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=kelt2008/&gt; Perrin also defined the &quot;mole&quot; as an amount of a compound that contained as many molecules as 32 grams of oxygen ({{chem|O|2}}).  He called that number the [[Avogadro number]] in honor of physicist [[Amedeo Avogadro]].

===Isotopic variation===
The discovery of isotopes of oxygen in 1929 required a more precise definition of the unit.  Unfortunately, two distinct definitions came into use.  Chemists choose to define the AMU as 1/16 of the average mass of an oxygen atom as found in nature; that is, the average of the masses of the known isotopes, weighted by their natural abundance.   Physicists, on the other hand, defined it as 1/16 of the mass of an atom of the isotope oxygen-16 (&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O).&lt;ref name=hold2004/&gt;

===Definition by the IUPAC===

The existence of two distinct units with the same name was confusing, and the difference (about {{val|1.000282}} in relative terms) was large enough to affect high-precision measurements.  Moreover, it was discovered that the isotopes of oxygen had different natural abundances in water and in air.   For these and other reasons, in 1961 the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC), which had absorbed the ICAW, adopted a new definition of the atomic mass unit for use in both physics and chemistry; namely, 1/12 of the mass of a carbon-12 atom. This new value was intermediate between the two earlier definitions, but closer to the one used by chemists (who would be affected the most by the change).&lt;ref name=petley1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=hold2004/&gt;

The new unit was named the &quot;unified atomic mass unit&quot; and given a new symbol &quot;u&quot;, to replace the old &quot;amu&quot; that had been used for the oxygen-based units.&lt;ref name=goldbUnAtMaUn/&gt;  However, the old symbol &quot;amu&quot; has sometimes been used, after 1961, to refer to the new unit, particularly in lay and preparatory contexts.

With this new definition, the [[standard atomic weight]] of [[carbon]] is approximately {{val|12.011|u=Da}}, and that of oxygen is approximately {{val|15.999|u=Da}}. These values, generally used in chemistry, are based on averages of many samples from [[Earth's crust]], its [[atmosphere]], and [[organic materials]].

===Adoption by the BIPM===

The IUPAC 1961 definition of the unified atomic mass unit, with that name and symbol &quot;u&quot;, was adopted by the [[International Bureau for Weights and Measures]] (BIPM) in 1971 as a [[non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI]].&lt;ref name=bipm1971/&gt;

===The dalton===
In 1993, the IUPAC proposed the shorter name &quot;dalton&quot; (with symbol &quot;Da&quot;) for the unified atomic mass unit.&lt;ref name=mills1993/&gt;&lt;ref name=goldbDa/&gt; As with other unit names such as watt and newton, &quot;dalton&quot; is not capitalized in English, but its symbol, &quot;Da&quot;, is capitalized.  The name was endorsed by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]] (IUPAP) in 2005.&lt;ref name=iupap2005/&gt;

In 2003 the name was recommended to the BIPM by the [[Consultative Committee for Units]], part of the [[CIPM]], as it &quot;is shorter and works better with [the SI] prefixes&quot;.&lt;ref name=bipm-ccu15/&gt; In 2006, the BIPM included the dalton in its 8th edition of the formal definition of [[SI]].&lt;ref name=bipm8th/&gt;  The name was also listed as an alternative to &quot;unified atomic mass unit&quot; by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] in 2009.&lt;ref name=ISO1/&gt;&lt;ref name=ISO10/&gt;  It is now recommended by several scientific publishers,&lt;ref name=oxsty/&gt; and some of them consider &quot;atomic mass unit&quot; and &quot;amu&quot; deprecated.&lt;ref name=rapsty/&gt;  In 2019, the BIPM retained the dalton in its 9th edition of the formal definition of [[SI]] while dropping the unified atomic mass unit from its table of [[non-SI units accepted for use with the SI]], but secondarily notes that the dalton (Da) and the unified atomic mass unit (u) are alternative names (and symbols) for the same unit.&lt;ref name=bipm9th/&gt;

===A proposal===
A proposal was made in 2012 to redefine the dalton (and presumably the unified atomic mass unit) as being 1/''N'' grams, thereby breaking the link with &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C.  This would imply changes in the atomic masses of all elements when expressed in daltons, but the change would be too small to have practical effects.&lt;ref name=leon2012/&gt;

=== 2019 redefinition of the SI base units ===
The definition of the dalton was not affected by the [[2019 redefinition of SI base units]],&lt;ref name=&quot;cipm106&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cgpm26&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bipm9th&quot; /&gt; that is, 1&amp;nbsp;Da in the SI is still 1/12 of the mass of a carbon-12 atom, a quantity that must be determined experimentally in terms of SI units.  However, the definition of a mole was changed to be the amount of substance consisting of exactly {{physconst|NA|unit=no|ref=no}} entities and the definition of the kilogram was changed as well.  As a consequence, the [[molar mass constant]] is no longer exactly 1&amp;nbsp;g/mol, meaning that the number of grams in the mass of one mole of any substance is no longer exactly equal to the number of daltons in its average molecular mass.&lt;ref name=&quot;lehm2016&quot; /&gt;

==Measurement==
Although relative atomic masses are defined for neutral atoms, they are measured (by [[mass spectrometry]]) for ions: hence, the measured values must be corrected for the mass of the electrons that were removed to form the ions, and also for the mass equivalent of the [[electron binding energy]], ''E''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;/''m''&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The total binding energy of the six electrons in a carbon-12 atom is 1030.1089&amp;nbsp;eV&amp;nbsp;= {{nowrap|1.650 4163{{e|−16}} J}}: ''E''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;/''m''&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= {{nowrap|1.105 8674{{e|−6}}}}, or about one part in 10&amp;nbsp;million of the mass of the atom.&lt;ref&gt;{{CODATA2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 2019 redefinition of SI units, experiments were aimed to determine the value of the [[Avogadro constant]] for finding the value of the unified atomic mass unit.

===Josef Loschmidt===
[[File:Johann Josef Loschmidt portrait plaque.jpg|right|thumb|Josef Loschmidt]]
A reasonably accurate value of the atomic mass unit was first obtained indirectly by [[Johann Josef Loschmidt|Josef Loschmidt]] in 1865, by estimating the number of particles in a given volume of gas.&lt;ref name=losch1865/&gt;

===Jean Perrin===
Perrin estimated the Avogadro number by a variety of methods, at the turn of the 20th century. He was awarded the 1926 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], largely for this work.&lt;ref name=oseen1926/&gt;

===[[Coulometry]]===
The electric charge per [[mole (unit)|mole]] of electrons is a constant called the [[Faraday constant]], whose value had been essentially known since 1834 when [[Michael Faraday]] published [[Faraday's laws of electrolysis|his works on electrolysis]]. In 1910, [[Robert Millikan]] obtained the first measurement of the [[elementary charge|charge on an electron]],  ''e''.  The quotient ''F''/''e'' provided an estimate of Avogadro's number.&lt;ref name=ebrit1974/&gt;

The classic experiment is that of Bower and Davis at [[NIST]],&lt;ref&gt;This account is based on the review in {{CODATA1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and relies on dissolving [[silver]] metal away from the [[anode]] of an [[electrolysis]] cell, while passing a constant [[electric current]] ''I'' for a known time ''t''. If ''m'' is the mass of silver lost from the anode and ''A''{{sub|r}} the atomic weight of silver, then the Faraday constant is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{A_{\rm r}M_{\rm u}It}{m}.&lt;/math&gt;
The NIST scientists devised a method to compensate for silver lost from the anode by mechanical causes, and conducted an [[isotope analysis]] of the silver used to determine its atomic weight. Their value for the conventional Faraday constant was ''F''{{sub|90}}&amp;nbsp;= {{val|96485.39|(13)|u=C/mol}}, which corresponds to a value for the Avogadro constant of {{val|6.0221449|(78)|e=23|u=mol-1}}: both values have a relative standard uncertainty of {{val|1.3|e=-6}}.

===Electron mass measurement===
In practice, the atomic mass constant is determined from the [[electron rest mass]] ''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; and the [[electron relative atomic mass]] ''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;(e) (that is, the mass of electron divided by the atomic mass constant).&lt;ref&gt;{{CODATA1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relative atomic mass of the electron can be measured in [[cyclotron]] experiments, while the rest mass of the electron can be derived from other physical constants.
:&lt;math&gt;m_{\rm u} = \frac{m_{\rm e}}{A_{\rm r}({\rm e})} = \frac{2R_\infty h}{A_{\rm r}({\rm e})c\alpha^2} ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;m_{\rm u} = \frac{M_{\rm u}}{N_{\rm A}} ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;N_{\rm A} = \frac{M_{\rm u} A_{\rm r}({\rm e})}{m_{\rm e}} = \frac{M_{\rm u} A_{\rm r}({\rm e})c\alpha^2}{2R_\infty h}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]], ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]], ''α'' is the [[fine-structure constant]], and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Rydberg constant]].

As may be observed from the old values (2014 CODATA) in the table below, the main limiting factor in the precision of the Avogadro constant was the uncertainty in the value of the [[Planck constant]], as all the other constants that contribute to the calculation were known more precisely.

===X-ray crystal density methods===
[[Image:Silicon-unit-cell-labelled-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Ball-and-stick model]] of the [[unit cell]] of [[silicon]]. X-ray diffraction measures the cell parameter, ''a'', which is used to calculate a value for the Avogadro constant.]]
[[Silicon]] single crystals may be produced today in commercial facilities with extremely high purity and with few lattice defects. This method defined the Avogadro constant as the ratio of the [[molar volume]], ''V''{{sub|m}}, to the atomic volume ''V''{{sub|atom}}:&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;N_{\rm A}  =  \frac{V_{\rm m}}{V_{\rm atom}}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;V_{\rm atom}  =  \frac{V_{\rm cell}}{n}&lt;/math&gt; and ''n'' is the number of atoms per unit cell of volume ''V''&lt;sub&gt;cell&lt;/sub&gt;.

The unit cell of silicon has a cubic packing arrangement of 8 atoms, and the unit cell volume may be measured by determining a single unit cell parameter, the length ''a'' of one of the sides of the cube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webmineral.com/help/CellDimensions.shtml|title=Unit Cell Formula|last=Mineralogy Database|date=2000–2005|access-date=2007-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2018 CODATA value of ''a'' for silicon is {{Val|5.431020511|(89)|e=-10|u=m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?asil |title=2018 CODATA Value: lattice parameter of silicon |date=20 May 2019 |work=The NIST Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] |access-date=2019-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, measurements are carried out on a distance known as ''d''{{sub|220}}(Si), which is the distance between the planes denoted by the [[Miller index|Miller indices]] {220}, and is equal to ''a''/{{radic|8}}.

The [[isotope]] proportional composition of the sample used must be measured and taken into account. Silicon occurs in three stable isotopes (&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;Si, &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;Si, &lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;Si), and the natural variation in their proportions is greater than other uncertainties in the measurements. The [[atomic weight]] ''A''{{sub|r}} for the sample crystal can be calculated, as the [[standard atomic weight]]s of the three [[nuclide]]s are known with great accuracy. This, together with the measured [[density]] ''ρ'' of the sample, allows the molar volume ''V''{{sub|m}} to be determined:

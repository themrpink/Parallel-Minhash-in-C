The Theatre Bar on Upper Deck featured red chairs, red drapes, a red egg crate fibreglass screen, and even a red baby [[grand piano]]. Some more traditional materials like wood veneer were used as highlights throughout the ship, especially in passenger corridors and staterooms. There was also an Observation Bar on Quarter Deck, a successor to its namesake, located in a similar location, on both previous ''Queens'', which offered views through large windows over the ship's bow. This room was lost in ''QE2''{{'}}s 1972 refit, becoming galley space with the forward-facing windows plated over.

In the 1994 refit, almost all of the remaining original decor was replaced, with Cunard opting to reverse the original design direction of ''QE2''{{'}}s designers and use the line's traditional ocean liners as inspiration. The green velvet and leather Midships Bar became the [[Art Deco]] inspired Chart Room, receiving an original, custom designed piano from ''Queen Mary''. The (by now) blue dominated Theatre Bar was transformed into the Golden Lion Pub, which mimics a traditional [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] pub.

Some original elements were retained including the flared columns in the Queens Room and Mid-Ships Lobby which were incorporated into the reworked designs. The Queen's Room's indirect lighting from above was replaced with uplighters which reversed the original light airy effect by illuminating the lowered ceiling and leaving shadows in the ceiling's slot. The furniture and carpet which replaced Michael Inchbald's designs were incongruous next to the flared columns and slotted ceiling.

By the time of her retirement, the Synagogue was the only room that had remained unaltered since 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://members.tripod.com/~Tziper/today.htm | title=Queen Elizabeth 2: Today |publisher=Members.tripod.com |accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it was reported that during ''QE2''{{'}}s 22 October five night voyage, the Synagogue was carefully dismantled before being removed from the ship prior to her final sailing to Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelserver.net/travelpage/ubb-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&amp;f=3&amp;t=004606 |title=Cruise Talk&amp;nbsp;– Topic: QE2's Synagogue dismantled |publisher=Travelserver.net |accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artwork and artefacts===
[[File:QE2 bell.jpg|thumb|''QE2'' bell on display on the {{MS|Queen Elizabeth}}]]
The designers included numerous pieces of artwork within the public rooms of the ship, as well as maritime artefacts drawn from Cunard's long history of operating merchant vessels.

[[Althea Wynne]]'s sculpture of the ''White Horses'' of the Atlantic Ocean was installed in the Mauretania Restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/art-obituaries/9082747/Althea-Wynne.html Althea Wynne (obituary)] in [[The Daily Telegraph]] dated 14 February 2012, online at telegraph.co.uk. Retrieved 3 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Two bronze busts were installed—one of Sir [[Samuel Cunard]] outside the Yacht Club, and one of Queen [[Elizabeth II]] in the Queen's Room. Four life-size statues of human forms—created by sculptor Janine Janet in marine materials like shell and coral, representing the four elements—were installed in the Princess Grill. A frieze designed by Brody Nevenshwander, depicting the words of [[T. S. Eliot]], Sir [[Francis Drake]], and [[John Masefield]], was in the Chart Room. The Midships Lobby housed a solid silver model of ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' made by Asprey of Bond Street in 1975, which was lost until a photograph found in 1997 led to the discovery of the model itself. It was placed on ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' in 1999.

Three custom-designed tapestries were commissioned from [[Helena Hernmarck]] for the ship's launch, depicting the Queen as well as the launch of the ship. These tapestries were originally hung in the Quarter Deck &quot;D&quot; Stairway, outside the Columbia Restaurant. They were originally made with golden threads, but much of this was lost when they were incorrectly cleaned during the 1987 refit. They were subsequently hung in the &quot;E&quot; stairway, and later damaged in 2005.

There are numerous photographs, oils, and pastels of members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] throughout the vessel.

The ship also housed items from previous Cunard ships, including both a brass relief plaque with a fish motif from the first {{RMS|Mauretania|1906}} and an Art-Deco bas-relief titled ''Winged Horse and Clouds'' by Norman Foster from [[RMS Queen Elizabeth]]. There were also a vast array of Cunard postcards, porcelain, flatware, boxes, linen, and [[Lines Bros]] Tri-ang Minic model ships. One of the key pieces was a replica of the [[figurehead]] from Cunard's first ship [[RMS Britannia]], carved from [[Quebec]] yellow pine by [[Cornwall|Cornish]] sculptor Charles Moore and presented to the ship by [[Lloyd's of London]].

On the Upper Deck sits the silver Boston Commemorative Cup, presented to ''Britannia'' by the City of Boston in 1840. This cup was lost for decades until it was found in a pawn shop in Halifax, Nova Scotia. On &quot;2&quot; Deck was a bronze entitled ''Spirit of the Atlantic'' that was designed by Barney Seale for the second {{RMS|Mauretania|1938}}. A large wooden plaque was presented to ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' by [[First Sea Lord]] Sir [[John Fieldhouse, Baron Fieldhouse|John Fieldhouse]] to commemorate the ship's service as a Hired Military Transport (HMT) in the [[Falklands War]].

There was also an extensive collection of large-scale models of Cunard ships located throughout ''Queen Elizabeth 2''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magwa.co.uk/qe2/qe2prt01.htm |title=Interiors of QE2 following The Cunard Heritage Trail in part |publisher=Magwa.co.uk |accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years the ship's collection was added to. Among those items was a set of antique Japanese armour presented to ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' by the Governor of [[Kagoshima]], Japan, during her 1979 world cruise, as was a [[Josiah Wedgwood|Wedgwood]] vase presented to the ship by Lord Wedgwood.

Throughout the public areas were also silver plaques commemorating the visits of every member of the Royal Family, as well as other dignitaries such as South African president [[Nelson Mandela]].

Istithmar bought most of these items from Cunard when it purchased ''QE2''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qe2thelastcrossing.blogspot.com/2008/10/qe2-heritage-trail.html |title=QE2 Heritage Trail |accessdate=25 May 2010|date=2008-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crew accommodation===
The majority of crew were accommodated in two- or four-berth cabins, with showers and toilets at the end of each alleyway.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} These were located forward and aft on decks three to six.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} At the time she entered service, the crew areas were a significant improvement over those aboard {{RMS|Queen Mary}} and {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}}; however the ship's age and the lack of renovation of the crew area during her 40 years of service, in contrast to passenger areas, which were updated periodically, meant that this accommodation was considered basic by the end of her career. [[Licensed mariner|Officers]] were accommodated in single cabins with private en-suite bathrooms located on Sun Deck.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheQE2Story&quot; /&gt;

There were three crew bars, one named ''The Pig &amp; Whistle''.&lt;ref name=&quot;journey_book&quot; /&gt; (&quot;The Pig&quot; for short and a tradition aboard Cunard ships), ''Castaways'' and the ''Fo'c's'le Club''. A fourth bar, dedicated for the officers, is located at the forward end of Boat Deck. Named ''The Officers Wardroom'', this area enjoyed forward facing views and was often opened to passengers for cocktail parties hosted by the senior officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;lightbody1&quot; /&gt; The crew mess was situated at the forward end of One Deck,&lt;ref name=&quot;journey_book&quot; /&gt; adjacent to the crew services office.

===Machinery===
[[File:20-QE2 Re-engine.jpg|thumb|''Queen Elizabeth 2'' being re-engined at [[Bremerhaven]], November 1986]]
[[File:21-QE2 Re-engine.jpg|thumb|''Queen Elizabeth 2''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s original funnel, removed while being re-engined; her old fixed-pitch propellers are lying to the bottom left hand side on the photo]]

''Queen Elizabeth 2'' was originally fitted out with a [[steam turbine]] propulsion system utilising three Foster Wheeler E.S.D II boilers, which provided steam for the two Brown-[[Pametrada]] turbines. The turbines were rated with a maximum power output figure of 110,000 shaft horsepower (normally operating at 94,000&amp;nbsp;hp) and coupled via double-reduction gearing to two six-bladed fixed-pitch [[propeller]]s.

The steam turbines were plagued with problems{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} from the time the ship first entered service and, despite being technically advanced and fuel-efficient in 1968, her consumption of 600 tons of fuel oil every twenty four hours was more than expected for such a ship by the 1980s. After seventeen years of service the availability of spare parts was becoming difficult due to the outdated design of the boilers and turbines and the constant use of the machinery which was mainly due to the deletion of the originally planned 4th boiler as a cost saving measure whilst on the drawing board by Cunard.

The shipping company decided that the options were to either do nothing for the remainder of the ship's life, re-configure the existing engines, or completely re-engine the vessel with a modern, more efficient and more reliable diesel-electric powerplant. Ultimately it was decided to replace the engines, as it was calculated that the savings in fuel costs and maintenance would pay for themselves over four years whilst giving the vessel a minimum of another twenty years of service, whereas the other options would only provide short-term relief.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rob Lightbody&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.roblightbody.com/liners/qe-2/1987_Refit/ |publisher=Rob Lightbody |title=QE2's Major 1986–1987 re-engining refit |accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her steam turbines had taken her to a record breaking total of 2,622,858 miles in 18 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Cunarders&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecunarders.co.uk/QE2%20History.html |publisher=The Cunarders |title=The Cunarders QE2 History |accessdate=23 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213081103/http://www.thecunarders.co.uk/QE2%20History.html |archive-date=13 December 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ship's 1986 to 1987 refit, the steam turbines were removed and replaced with nine German [[MAN SE|MAN]] 9L58/64 nine-cylinder, medium-speed diesel engines, each weighing approximately 120 tons. Using a diesel-electric configuration, each engine drives a generator, each developing 10.5 MW of electrical power at 10,000 volts. This electrical plant, in addition to powering the ship's auxiliary and hotel services through transformers, drives the two main propulsion motors, one on each propeller shaft. These motors produce 44 MW each and are of synchronised salient-pole construction, nine metres in diameter and weighing more than 400 tons each.

The ship's service speed of {{convert|28.5|kn|km/h}} was now maintained using only seven of the diesel-electric sets. The maximum power output with the new engine configuration running increased to 130,000&amp;nbsp;hp, which was greater than the previous system's 110,000&amp;nbsp;hp. Using the same IBF-380 ([[Bunker C]]) fuel, the new configuration yielded a 35% fuel saving over the previous system. During the re-engining process, her funnel was replaced by a wider one to accommodate the exhaust pipes for the nine MAN diesel engines.

During the refit, the original fixed-pitch propellers were replaced with [[controllable-pitch propeller|variable-pitch propellers]]. The old steam propulsion system required astern turbines to move the ship backwards or stop her moving forward. The pitch of the new variable pitch blades could simply be reversed, causing a reversal of propeller thrust while maintaining the same direction of propeller rotation, allowing the ship shorter stopping times and improved handling characteristics.

The new propellers were originally fitted with &quot;Grim Wheels&quot;, named after their inventor, Dr. Ing Otto Grim.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rob Lightbody&quot;/&gt; These were free-spinning propeller blades fitted behind the main propellers, with long vanes protruding from the centre hub. The Grim Wheels were designed to recover lost propeller thrust and reduce fuel consumption by 2.5 to 3%. After the trial of these wheels, when the ship was drydocked, the majority of the vanes on each wheel were discovered to have broken off. The wheels were removed and the project abandoned.

Other machinery includes nine heat recovery boilers, coupled with two oil-fired boilers to produce steam for heating fuel, domestic water, swimming pools, laundry equipment, and galleys. Four flash evaporators and a reverse-osmosis unit desalinate sea water to produce 1000 tons of fresh water daily. There is also a sanitation system and sewage disposal plant, air conditioning plant, and an electro-hydraulic steering system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qe2.org.uk/engine.html |title=The engine room |publisher=QE2 |accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
On 30 December 1964, Cunard placed an order for construction of the new ship with [[John Brown and Company]], who would build it at their shipyard in [[Clydebank]], Scotland. The agreed price was £25,427,000 with provision for escalation of labour and materials increases, with an agreed delivery date of May 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;PayneP33&quot;&gt;Payne. Page 33.&lt;/ref&gt; To assist with its construction the British government provided financial assistance to Cunard in the form of a £17.6 million loan at 4.5% interest.&lt;ref name=PayneP33/&gt;

The keel was laid down on 5 July 1965, as hull number 736 on the same slipway where previous Cunard liners such as {{RMS|Lusitania|3=2}}, {{RMS|Aquitania|3=2}}, ''Queen Mary'', and ''Queen Elizabeth'' had been constructed.

As construction continued on the new ship, Cunard found itself in increasing financial difficulties as increased competition from airlines resulted in the company's passenger ships losing money. With profits from its cargo ships eventually unable to offset the losses, Cunard was forced to sell ''Mauretania'', ''Sylvania'', ''Carinthia'', ''Caronia'', ''Queen Mary'' and ''Queen Elizabeth'' between 1965 and 1968. Income also fell due to a seven-week-long seamens' strike in 1966.&lt;ref name=PayneP33/&gt; Then John Brown advised that the delivery would be delayed by six months, which meant the ship would miss the 1968 peak summer transatlantic season. Following market research Cunard decided to take advantage of the delay to change the original three-class configuration of the ship to a more flexible two-class arrangement of First and Tourist.&lt;ref name=PayneP33/&gt;

On 20 September 1967 with the launch date approaching, Cunard (having lost £7.5 million the previous year) approached the government with a request for an additional £3 million loan to complete the ship.&lt;ref name=PayneP33/&gt; Eventually the government agreed to increase the original £17.6 million loan up to £24 million.&lt;ref&gt;Glen. Page 305.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was launched and named on 20 September 1967 by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], using the same pair of gold scissors her mother and grandmother used to launch ''Queen Elizabeth'' and ''Queen Mary'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;hist1&quot; /&gt; After the bottle of champagne was smashed the QE2 stayed put on the slipway for 90 seconds before being let free. . On 19 November 1968, she left John Brown's fitting out berth. Several industrial disputes with the Clydebank workers, with their resultant delays and quality issues, forced Cunard to transfer the ship to Southampton, where Vosper Thorneycroft completed the installation and commissioning work, prior to the sea trials.&lt;ref&gt;brumcarrier, commissioning engineer for Carrier.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Highhopes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20020505/ai_n12576177 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150904050816/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20020505/ai_n12576177 |url-status=dead|archive-date=4 September 2015 |title=High hopes for a return of the Clyde's glory days |author=Alf Young |date=5 May 2002 |work=[[Sunday Herald]], Find Articles at BNET |accessdate=7 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sea trials began on 26 November 1968 in the [[Irish Sea]], proceeding to speed trials off the Isle of Arran.&lt;ref name=&quot;PayneP34&quot;&gt;Payne. Page 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cunard initially refused to accept the ship, as the sea trials identified that the ship suffered from a resonant vibration which was traced to a design flaw in the blades of the steam turbines.&lt;ref name=&quot;PayneP36&quot;&gt;Payne. Page 36.&lt;/ref&gt; This delayed her being handed over to her new owners until 18 April 1969.&lt;ref name=PayneP36/&gt; She then departed on a &quot;shakedown cruise&quot; to [[Las Palmas]] on 22 April 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;QE2History&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qe2.org.uk/history.html |title=QE2&amp;nbsp;– History |accessdate=7 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service==

===Early career===
[[File:qe2.750pix.jpg|thumb|QE2 in Southampton, 1976]]

''Queen Elizabeth 2''{{'}}s maiden voyage, from Southampton to New York, commenced on 2 May 1969,&lt;ref name=QE2History /&gt; taking 4 days, 16 hours, and 35 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=26 October 2011|title=Harbor Whistles Greet a Stately Queen Designed for the Modern Age; 150 Vessels in Harbor Greet the Queen Elizabeth 2|work=The New York Times |url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1969/05/08/88990994.pdf|first=George|last=Horne|date=8 May 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, she participated in the rescue of some 500 passengers from the burning [[Compagnie Générale Transatlantique|French Line]] ship {{SS|Antilles|3=2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;chrisqe2hist&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=QE2History /&gt;
Later that year on 5 March ''QE2'' was disabled for four hours when jellyfish were sucked into and blocked her seawater intakes.&lt;ref name=PayneP36/&gt;

On 17 May 1972, while travelling from New York to Southampton, she was the subject of a [[bomb threat]].&lt;ref name=TheQE2Story/&gt; She was searched by her crew, and a combined [[Special Air Service]] and [[Special Boat Service]] team which [[parachute]]d into the sea to conduct a search of the ship. No bomb was found, but the [[hoaxer]] was arrested by the [[FBI]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chrisqe2hist&quot;/&gt;

The following year ''QE2'' undertook two chartered cruises through the Mediterranean to [[Israel]] in commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the state's founding. The ship's Columbia Restaurant was koshered for Passover, and Jewish passengers were able to celebrate [[Passover]] on the ship. According to the book &quot;The Angel&quot; by [[Uri Bar-Joseph]], [[Muammar Gaddafi]] ordered a submarine to torpedo her during one of the chartered cruises in retaliation for Israel's downing of [[Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114|Libyan Flight 114]], but [[Anwar Sadat]] intervened secretly to foil the attack.

Upon the withdrawal of [[French Line|CGT]]'s competing [[SS France (1961)|SS ''France'']] from service in 1974, Queen Elizabeth 2 became the largest operational passenger ship in the world for a few years, until the France was returned to service as [[SS Norway|SS ''Norway'']] in 1980.

On 23 July 1976 while ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' was 80 miles off the Scilly Isles on a transatlantic voyage, a flexible coupling drive connecting the starboard main engine high pressure rotor and the reduction gear box ruptured. This allowed lubricating oil under pressure to enter into the main engine room where it ignited, creating a severe fire. It took 20 minutes to bring the fire under control. Reduced down to two boilers, the ship limped back to Southampton. Damage from the fire resulted in a replacement boiler having to be fitted by dry-docking the ship and cutting an access hole in her side.&lt;ref name=PayneP36/&gt;

By 1978 ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' was breaking even with an occupancy of 65%, generating revenues of greater than 30 million per year against which had to be deducted an annual fuel cost of £5 million and a monthly crew cost of £225,000. With it costing £80,000 a day for her to sit idle in port, her owners made every attempt to keep her at sea and full of passengers. As a result, as much maintenance as possible was undertaken while at sea. However, she needed all three of her boilers to be in service if she was to maintain her transatlantic schedule. With limited ability to maintain her boilers, reliability was becoming a serious issue.&lt;ref&gt;Payne. Page 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the late 1970s and early 1980s ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' was testing a new ablative anti-fouling type paint for the Admiralty which was only available in blue.  When they finally made the paint available in different colours they returned ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' anti-fouling paint to the traditional red colour.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theqe2story.com/forum/index.php?topic=8118.msg92582#msg92582|QE2 Refit and Repairs: 3 November to 14 December 1978]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Falklands War===
On 3 May 1982, she was requisitioned by the British government for service as a troop carrier in the [[Falklands War]].&lt;ref name=PayneP36 /&gt;

In preparation for war service, Vosper Thornycroft commenced in Southampton on 5 May 1982 the installation of two [[helicopter pad]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=QE2 HIstory|url=https://www.chriscunard.com/qe2/qe2-history/|website=Chris' Cunard Page|publisher=Chris Frame|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the transformation of public lounges into [[dormitories]], the installation of fuel pipes that ran through the ship down to the engine room to allow for refuelling at sea, and the covering of carpets with 2,000 sheets of [[hardboard]]. A quarter of the ship's length was reinforced with steel plating, and an anti-magnetic coil was fitted to combat [[naval mine]]s. Over 650 Cunard crew members volunteered for the voyage, to look after the 3,000 members of the [[5th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|Fifth Infantry Brigade]], which the ship transported to [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]].

On 12 May 1982,&lt;ref name=PayneP36/&gt; with only one of her three boilers in operation, the ship departed Southampton for the South Atlantic, carrying 3,000 troops and 650 volunteer crew. The remaining boilers were brought back into service as she steamed south.&lt;ref name=&quot;PayneP38&quot;&gt;Payne. Page 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the voyage, the ship was blacked out and the radar switched off to avoid detection, steaming on without modern aids.&lt;ref name=&quot;chrisqe2hist&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Falk&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cunard.com/AboutCunard/NewsReleases.asp?Cat=&amp;View=ViewArticle&amp;Mode=News&amp;ContentID=6601&amp;Active=News |title=''Cunard's QE2 Hosts Falklands Reunion'' |publisher=Cunard |accessdate=14 July 2010 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225184847/http://www.cunard.com/AboutCunard/NewsReleases.asp?Cat=&amp;View=ViewArticle&amp;Mode=News&amp;ContentID=6601&amp;Active=News |archivedate=25 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:QE2colour jm.jpg|thumb|Berthed in [[Málaga]] Spain 1982, with her original white funnel repainted red. Her hull is painted grey, a short lived decision.]]

''Queen Elizabeth 2'' returned to the UK on 11 June 1982, where she was greeted in [[Southampton Water]] by [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|The Queen Mother]] on board the [[HMY Britannia|Royal Yacht ''Britannia'']]. Peter Jackson, the captain of the QE2 responded to the Queen Mother's welcome: &quot;Please convey to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth our thanks for her kind message. Cunard's Queen Elizabeth 2 is proud to have been of service to Her Majesty's Forces.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Falk&quot; /&gt; The ship underwent conversion back to passenger service, with her funnel being painted in the traditional Cunard orange with black stripes, which are known as &quot;hands,&quot; for the first time, during the refit the hull's exterior was repainted an unconventional light pebble grey.&lt;ref name=TheQE2Story /&gt; She returned to service on 7 August 1982.&lt;ref name=PayneP36/&gt;

The new colour scheme proved unpopular with passengers,&lt;ref name=TheQE2Story /&gt; as well as difficult to maintain and so the hull reverted to traditional colours in 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;chrisqe2hist&quot; /&gt; Later that year, QE2 was fitted with a [[magrodome]] over her quarter-deck pool.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warwick1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald W.

===Diesel era and Project Lifestyle===
[[File:QE2 Port Melbourne 20080229.JPG|left|thumb|''QE2'''s new and wider funnel]]
''QE2'' once again experienced mechanical problems following her annual overhaul in November 1983. Boiler problems caused Cunard to cancel a cruise, and, in October 1984, an electrical fire caused a complete loss of power. The ship was delayed for several days before power could be restored. Instead of replacing the QE2 with a newer vessel, Cunard decided that it was more prudent to simply make improvements to her. Therefore, from 27 October 1986 to 25 April 1987,&lt;ref name=PayneP36/&gt; ''QE2'' underwent one of her most significant refurbishments when she was converted by Lloyd Werft at their shipyard in Bremerhaven, Germany from steam power to diesel.&lt;ref name=&quot;chrisqe2hist&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=PayneP38/&gt; Nine [[MAN B&amp;W]] diesel electric engines, new propellers and a heat recovery system (to utilise heat expelled by the engines) were fitted, which halved the fuel consumption. With this new propulsion system, ''QE2'' was expected to serve another 20 years with Cunard. The passenger accommodation was also modernised.&lt;ref name=&quot;chrisqe2hist&quot; /&gt; The refurbishment cost over £100 million.&lt;ref name=PayneP38/&gt;

On 7 August 1992, the underside of the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] was extensively damaged when she ran aground south of [[Cuttyhunk]] Island near [[Martha's Vineyard]], while returning from a five-day cruise to [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]] along the east coast of the United States and Canada. A combination of her speed, an uncharted shoal and underestimating the increase in the ship's draft due to the [[squat effect|effect of squat]] led to the ship's hull scraping rocks on the ocean floor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/MAR9301.pdf Marine Accident Report—''Grounding of the United Kingdom Passenger Vessel RMS QUEEN ELIZABETH 2 Near Cuttyhunk Island, Vineyard Sound, Massachusetts, August 7, 1992''] (NTSB/MAR-93/01), pp. 26-30. [[National Transportation Safety Board]]: 25 May 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The accident resulted in the passengers disembarking earlier than scheduled at nearby [[Newport, Rhode Island]] and the ship being taken out of service while temporary repairs were made in drydock at Boston. Several days later, divers found the red paint from the keel on previously uncharted rocks where the ship struck the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7DC1531F936A2575BC0A964958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink|title=Marine Surveyors Find Uncharted Rock That May Have Damaged Hull of the QE2|work=The New York Times|date=15 August 1992|accessdate=20 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/MAR9301.pdf Marine Accident Report—''Grounding of the United Kingdom Passenger Vessel RMS QUEEN ELIZABETH 2 Near Cuttyhunk Island, Vineyard Sound, Massachusetts, August 7, 1992''] (NTSB/MAR-93/01), pp. 21-26.

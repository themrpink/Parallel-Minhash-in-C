Objects in LEO encounter atmospheric drag from [[gases]] in the [[thermosphere]] (approximately 80–500&amp;nbsp;km above the surface) or [[exosphere]] (approximately {{cvt|500|km|0|disp=or}} and up), depending on orbit height. Due to atmospheric drag, satellites do not usually orbit below {{cvt|300|km}}. Objects in LEO orbit Earth between the denser part of the atmosphere and below the inner [[Van Allen radiation belt]].

Equatorial low Earth orbits (ELEO) are a subset of LEO. These orbits, with low inclination to the Equator, allow rapid revisit times of low-latitude places on Earth and have the lowest [[delta-v]] requirement (i.e., fuel spent) of any orbit, provided they have the direct (not retrograde) orientation with respect to the Earth's rotation. Orbits with a high inclination angle to the equator are usually called [[polar orbit]]s.

Higher orbits include [[medium Earth orbit]] (MEO), sometimes called intermediate circular orbit (ICO), and further above, [[geostationary orbit]] (GEO). Orbits higher than low orbit can lead to early failure of electronic components due to intense [[radiation]] and charge accumulation.

In 2017, &quot;very low Earth&quot; orbits began to be seen in [[regulatory agency|regulatory]] filings.  These orbits, referred to as &quot;'''VLEO'''&quot;&lt;!-- bolded per [[WP:MOSBOLD]] for redirect target --&gt;, require the use of novel technologies for [[orbit raising]] because they operate in orbits that would ordinarily decay too soon to be economically useful.&lt;ref name=pa20170303&gt;

==Use of LEO==
[[File:Sunrise To Sunset Aboard The ISS.OGG|thumb|Roughly half an orbit of the [[International Space Station|ISS]].]]

A low Earth orbit requires the lowest amount of energy for satellite placement. It provides high bandwidth and low communication [[Latency (engineering)|latency]]. Satellites and space stations in LEO are more accessible for crew and servicing. 

Since it requires less energy to place a satellite into a LEO, and a satellite there needs less powerful amplifiers for successful transmission, LEO is used for many communication applications, such as the [[Iridium Communications|Iridium phone system]]. Some [[communication satellite]]s use much higher [[geostationary orbit]]s, and move at the same angular velocity as the Earth as to appear stationary above one location on the planet.

=== Disadvantages ===
Satellites in LEO have a small momentary [[field of view]], only able to observe and communicate with a fraction of the Earth at a time, meaning a network (or &quot;[[Satellite constellation|constellation]]&quot;) of satellites is required to in order to provide continuous coverage. Satellites in lower regions of LEO also suffer from fast [[orbital decay]], requiring either periodic reboosting to maintain a stable orbit, or launching replacement satellites when old ones re-enter.

===Examples===
* [[Earth observation satellite]]s and [[spy satellite]]s use LEO as they are able to see the surface of the Earth more clearly by being closer to it. They are also able to traverse the surface of the Earth. A majority of artificial [[satellite]]s are placed in LEO,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NASA Earth Observatory|url = http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/OrbitsCatalog/|website = earthobservatory.nasa.gov|date = 2009-09-04|access-date = 2015-11-28|language = en|first = Riebeek|last = Holli}}&lt;/ref&gt; making one complete revolution around the [[Earth]] in about 90 minutes.
* The [[International Space Station]] is in a LEO about {{convert|400|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} to {{convert|420|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} above Earth's surface,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition26/iss_altitude.html | title=Higher Altitude Improves Station's Fuel Economy | publisher=NASA | access-date=2013-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and needs reboosting a few times a year due to orbital decay.
* [[Iridium satellite constellation|Iridium satellites]] orbit at about  {{convert|780|km|mi|abbr=on}}.
* Lower orbits also aid [[remote sensing]] satellites because of the added detail that can be gained. Remote sensing satellites can also take advantage of [[Sun-synchronous orbit|Sun-synchronous LEO orbits]] at an altitude of about {{convert|800|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} and near polar inclination. [[Envisat]] (2002–2012) is one example of an Earth observation satellite that makes use of this particular type of LEO (at {{convert|770|km|mi|abbr=on}}).
* [[Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer|GOCE]] orbited at about {{convert|255|km|mi|abbr=on}} to measure Earth's gravity field.
* [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment|GRACE]] were, and [[GRACE-FO]] are, orbiting at about {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} 
* The [[Hubble Space Telescope]] orbits at about {{convert|540|km|mi|abbr=on}} above Earth.
* The Chinese [[Tiangong-1]] station was in orbit at about {{convert|355|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com.cn/h/2011/1001/c25408-1418236438.html &quot;天宫一号成功完成二次变轨&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;, until its de-orbiting in 2018.
* The Chinese [[Tiangong-2]] station was in orbit at about {{convert|370|km|mi|abbr=on}}, until its de-orbiting in 2019.

==Space debris==
The LEO environment is becoming congested with [[space debris]] because of the frequency of object launches.  This has caused growing concern in recent years, since collisions at orbital velocities can easily be dangerous, and even deadly. Collisions can produce even more space debris in the process, creating a [[domino effect]], something known as [[Kessler syndrome]]. The [[Combined Space Operations Center]], part of [[United States Strategic Command]] (formerly the United States Space Command), currently tracks more than 8,500 objects larger than 10&amp;nbsp;cm in LEO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vandenberg.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=12579 Fact Sheet: Joint Space Operations Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203082814/http://www.vandenberg.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=12579 |date=2010-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a limited [[Arecibo Observatory]] study suggested there could be approximately one million objects larger than 2 millimeters,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronomycafe.net/qadir/q1697.html archive of astronomy: space junk]&lt;/ref&gt; which are too small to be visible from Earth-based observatories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eugen.leitl.org/tt/msg04534.html ISS laser broom, project Orion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728181940/http://eugen.leitl.org/tt/msg04534.html |date=2011-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Appian Way''' ([[Latin]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]: '''''Via Appia''''') is one of the earliest and strategically most important [[Roman road]]s of the ancient [[Roman Republic|republic]]. It connected [[Rome]] to [[Brindisi]], in southeast [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/356966898 |title=Places: 356966898 (Via Appia) |authors=Quilici and S.

Becker |accessdate=14 March 2013|publisher=Pleiades}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its importance is indicated by its common name, recorded by [[Statius]]:&lt;ref&gt;''Silvae'', [https://archive.org/stream/statiusstat01statuoft#page/96/mode/2up 2.2].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Elisabetta|last= Povoledo|title=Past Catches Up With the Queen of Roads |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/05/arts/design/05appi.html |quote=In ancient times the Appian Way, which links Rome to the southern city of Brindisi, was known as the ''regina viarum'', the queen of the roads.

{{quote|
{{lang|la|Appia longarum...  regina viarum}}

&quot;the Appian Way the queen of the long roads&quot;
}}

The road is named after [[Appius Claudius Caecus]], the [[Roman censor]] who began and completed the first section as a military road to the south in 312 BC&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;&quot;Appian Way&quot; in ''[[Chambers's Encyclopædia]]''. London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol. 1, p. 490.&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Samnite Wars]].

== Origins ==
[[File:Porta St. Sebastiano Rome 2011 1.jpg|left|thumb|Porta San Sebastiano is the gate of the Appia in the [[Aurelian Walls]].]]

=== The need for roads ===
The Appian Way was a [[Roman road]] used as a main route for military supplies since its construction for that purpose in 312 BC.&lt;ref&gt;William Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography'' (London, 1854), 1288. ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0064:entry=via-appia-geo]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Appian Way was the first long road built specifically to transport troops outside the smaller region of greater [[Rome]] (this was essential to the Romans). The few roads outside the early city were [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] and went mainly to [[Etruria]]. By the late [[Roman Republic|Republic]], the Romans had expanded over most of [[Italy]] and were masters of road construction. Their roads began at Rome, where the master {{lang|la|[[itinerarium]]}}, or list of destinations along the roads, was located, and extended to the borders of their domain&amp;nbsp;– hence the expression, &quot;[[wikt:all roads lead to Rome|All roads lead to Rome]]&quot;.

=== The Samnite Wars ===
Romans had an affinity for the people of [[Campania]], who, like themselves, traced their backgrounds to the [[Etruscans]]. The [[Samnite Wars]] were instigated by the [[Samnites]] when Rome attempted to ally itself with the city of [[Capua]] in Campania. The [[Italic languages|Italic]] speakers in [[Latium]] had long ago been subdued and incorporated into the Roman state. They were responsible for changing Rome from a primarily Etruscan to a primarily Italic state.

Dense populations of sovereign Samnites remained in the mountains north of Capua, which is just north of the [[Greece|Greek]] city of [[Naples|Neapolis]]. Around 343&amp;nbsp;BC, Rome and Capua attempted to form an alliance, a first step toward a closer unity. The Samnites reacted with military force.

=== The barrier of the Pontine Marshes ===
[[File:Appia-Priscilla-028.JPG|thumb|Priscilla tomb]]
[[File:Grave monument of Gaius Rabirius Hermodorus, Rabiria Demaris, and Usia Prima.jpg|thumb|right|Grave monument of Caius Rabirius Postumus Hermodorus, Lucia Rabiria Demaris and Usia Prima, priestess of [[Isis]] along the Via Appia, near Quarto Miglio]]
[[File:Appia-SanSebastiano-019.JPG|thumb|[[San Sebastiano fuori le Mura]], located on the catacombs of San Sebastiano]]

Between Capua and Rome lay the [[Pontine Marshes]] (''Pomptinae paludes''), a [[swamp]] infested with [[malaria]]. A tortuous coastal road wound between [[Ostia Antica (archaeological site)|Ostia]] at the mouth of the [[Tiber]] and [[Neapolis, Apulia|Neapolis]]. The [[Via Latina]] followed its ancient and scarcely more accessible path along the foothills of [[Monti Laziali]] and [[Monti Lepini]], which are visible towering over the former marsh.

In the [[First Samnite War]] (343–341&amp;nbsp;BC) the Romans found they could not support or resupply troops in the field against the Samnites across the marsh. A revolt of the [[Latin League]] drained their resources further. They gave up the attempted alliance and settled with [[Samnium]].

=== Colonization to the southeast ===
The Romans were only biding their time while they looked for a solution. The first answer was the [[colony|colonia]], a &quot;cultivation&quot; of settlers from Rome, who would maintain a permanent base of operations. The [[Second Samnite War]] (327–304&amp;nbsp;BC) erupted when Rome attempted to place a colony at [[Cales]] in 334 and again at [[Fregellae]] in 328 on the other side of the marshes. The Samnites, now a major power after defeating the [[Greeks in Italy|Greeks]] of [[Taranto|Tarentum]], occupied Neapolis to try to ensure its loyalty. The Neapolitans appealed to Rome, which sent an army and expelled the Samnites from Neapolis.

=== Appius Claudius' beginning of the works ===
In 312&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Appius Claudius Caecus]] became [[Roman censor|censor]] at Rome. He was of the [[gens Claudia]], who were [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] descended from the [[Sabines]] taken into the early Roman state. He had been given the name of the founding ancestor of the gens, Appius Claudius (Attus Clausus in Sabine). He was a [[Populism|populist]], i.e., an advocate of the common people. A man of inner perspicacity, in the years of success he was said to have lost his outer vision and thus acquired the name {{lang|la|caecus}}, &quot;blind&quot;.

Without waiting to be told what to do by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], Appius Claudius began bold public works to address the supply problem. An aqueduct (the [[Aqua Appia]]) secured the water supply of the city of Rome. By far the best known project was the road, which ran across the [[Pontine Marshes]] to the coast northwest of [[Naples]], where it turned north to Capua. On it, any number of fresh troops could be sped to the theatre of operations, and supplies could be moved en masse to Roman bases without hindrance by either enemy or terrain. It is no surprise that, after his term as censor, Appius Claudius became [[Roman consul|consul]] twice, subsequently held other offices, and was a respected consultant to the state even during his later years.

=== The success of the road ===
The road achieved its purpose. The outcome of the Second Samnite War was at last favorable to Rome.  In a series of blows the Romans reversed their fortunes, bringing Etruria to the table in 311&amp;nbsp;BC, the very year of their revolt, and [[Samnium]] in 304. The road was the main factor that allowed them to concentrate their forces with sufficient rapidity and to keep them adequately supplied, whereafter they became a formidable opponent.

== Construction of the road ==
The main part of the Appian Way was started and finished in 312&amp;nbsp;BC.

The road began as a leveled dirt road upon which small stones and [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] were laid. Gravel was laid upon this, which was finally topped with tight fitting, interlocking stones to provide a flat surface. The historian Procopius said that the stones fit together so securely and closely that they appeared to have grown together rather than to have been fitted together.&lt;ref&gt;Tingay, G.I.F., and J. Badcock. These Were The Romans. ed. Chester Springs, Pennsylvania: Dufour Editions, Inc., 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The road was cambered in the middle (for water runoff) and had ditches on either side of the road which were protected by retaining walls.

=== Between Rome and Lake Albano ===
[[File:Circus of Maxentius.jpg|thumb|The [[Circus of Maxentius]].]]

The road began in the [[Forum Romanum]], passed through the [[Servian Wall]] at the [[porta Capena]], went through a cutting in the [[clivus Martis]], and left the city. For this stretch of the road, the builders used the via Latina. The building of the [[Aurelian Wall]] centuries later required the placing of another gate, the [[Porta Appia]]. Outside of Rome the new via Appia went through well-to-do suburbs along the via Norba, the ancient track to the [[Alban hills]], where [[Norba]] was situated. The road at the time was a via glarea, a gravel road. The Romans built a high-quality road, with layers of cemented stone over a layer of small stones, cambered, drainage ditches on either side, low retaining walls on sunken portions, and dirt pathways for sidewalks. The via Appia is believed to have been the first Roman road to feature the use of lime cement. The materials were volcanic rock. The surface was said to have been so smooth that you could not distinguish the joints. The Roman section still exists and is lined with monuments of all periods, although the cement has eroded out of the joints, leaving a very rough surface.

=== Across the marsh ===
The road concedes nothing to the [[Alban hills]], but goes straight through them over cuts and fills. The gradients are steep. Then it enters the former Pontine Marshes. A stone causeway of about {{convert|19|mi|km|sp=us|order=flip}} led across stagnant and foul-smelling pools blocked from the sea by sand dunes. Appius Claudius planned to drain the marsh, taking up earlier attempts, but he failed. The causeway and its bridges subsequently needed constant repair. No one enjoyed crossing the marsh.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} In 162&amp;nbsp;BC, Marcus Cornelius Cathegus had a canal constructed along the road to relieve the traffic and provide an alternative when the road was being repaired. Romans preferred using the canal.

[[File:Roma Appia Antica - mausoleo Cecilia Metella.JPG|thumb|left|[[Mausoleum]] of [[Caecilia Metella (daughter of Metellus Creticus)|Caecilia Metella]] and the ''castrum [[Caetani]]'']]

=== Along the coast ===
The Via Appia picked up the coastal road at [[Terracina|Tarracina]]  (Terracina). However, the Romans straightened it somewhat with cuttings, which form cliffs today. From there the road swerved north to Capua, where, for the time being, it ended. Caudine Forks was not far to the north. The itinerary was [[Ariccia|Aricia]] (Ariccia), [[Three Taverns|Tres Tabernae]], [[Forum Appii]], Tarracina, [[Fondi, Italy|Fundi]] (Fondi), [[Formiae]] (Formia), [[Minturnae]] (Minturno), [[Suessa Pometia|Suessa]], [[Casilinum]] and Capua, but some of these were colonies added after the Samnite Wars. The distance was {{convert|132|mi|km|sp=us|order=flip|}}. The original road had no milestones, as they were not yet in use. A few survive from later times, including a first milestone near the porta Appia.

=== Extension to Beneventum ===
[[File:Minturno Via-Appia.jpg|thumb|Via Appia within the ancient [[Minturno]]]]

The [[Third Samnite War]] (298–290&amp;nbsp;BC) is perhaps misnamed. It was an all-out attempt by all the neighbors of Rome: Italics, Etruscans and [[Gauls]], to check the power of Rome. The Samnites were the leading people of the conspiracy. Rome dealt the northerners a crushing blow at the [[Battle of Sentinum]] in [[Umbria]] in 295. The Samnites fought on alone. Rome now placed 13 colonies in Campania and Samnium. It must have been during this time that they extended the via Appia 35 miles beyond Capua past the Caudine forks to a place the Samnites called Maloenton, &quot;passage of the flocks&quot;. The itinerary added [[Calatia]], [[Caudium]] and [[Benevento|Beneventum]] (not yet called that).&lt;ref&gt;William Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography'' (London, 1854), 1292–93. ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0064:entry=via-appia-geo]''&lt;/ref&gt; Here also ended the [[Via Latina]].&lt;ref&gt;William Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography'' (London, 1854), 1303. ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0064:entry=via-latina-geo]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extension to Apulia and Calabria ===
By 290&amp;nbsp;BC, the sovereignty of the Samnites had ended. The heel of Italy lay open to the Romans. The dates are somewhat uncertain and there is considerable variation in the sources, but during the Third Samnite War the Romans seem to have extended the road to [[Venusia]], where they placed a colony of 20,000&amp;nbsp;men. After that they were at Tarentum.

Roman expansion alarmed Tarentum, the leading city of the Greek presence (Magna Graecia) in southern Italy.  They hired the mercenary, King [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]], in neighboring [[Greece]] to fight the Romans on their behalf. In 280&amp;nbsp;BC the Romans suffered a defeat at the hands of Pyrrhus at the [[Battle of Heraclea]] on the coast west of [[Taranto|Tarentum]]. The battle was costly for both sides, prompting Pyrrhus to remark &quot;One more such victory and I am lost.&quot;  Making the best of it, the Roman army turned on Greek [[Rhegium]] and effected a massacre of Pyrrhian partisans there.

Rather than pursue them, Pyrrhus went straight for Rome along the via Appia and then the Via Latina. He knew that if he continued on the via Appia he could be trapped in the marsh. Wary of such entrapment on the Via Latina also, he withdrew without fighting after encountering opposition at [[Anagni]]. Wintering in [[Campania]], he withdrew to Apulia in 279&amp;nbsp;BC, where, pursued by the Romans, he won a second costly victory at the [[Battle of Asculum]]. Withdrawing from Apulia for a Sicilian interlude, he returned to Apulia in 275&amp;nbsp;BC and started for Campania up the Roman road.

Supplied by that same road, the Romans successfully defended the region against Pyrrhus, crushing his army in a two-day fight at the [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]] in 275&amp;nbsp;BC.  The Romans renamed the town from &quot;Maleventum&quot; (&quot;site of bad events&quot;) to Beneventum (&quot;site of good events&quot;) as a result.  Pyrrhus withdrew to Greece, where he died in a street fight in Argos in 272&amp;nbsp;BC.  Tarentum fell to the Romans that same year, who proceeded to consolidate their rule over all of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;See The Harper Encyclopedia of Military History, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romans pushed the via Appia to the port of [[Brundisium]] in 264&amp;nbsp;BC. The itinerary from Beneventum was now [[Venusia]], [[Gravina in Puglia|Silvium]], Tarentum, [[Oria (town)|Uria]] and Brundisium. The Roman Republic was the government of Italy, for the time being. Appius Claudius died in 273, but in extending the road a number of times, no one has tried to displace his name upon it.

==== Rediscovery ====
The Appian Way's path across today's regions [[Lazio]] and [[Campania]] has always been well known, while the exact position of the part located in Apulia (the original one, not the extension by Trajan) was unknown, since there were no visible remains of the Appian Way in that region.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lugli-orientate|lugli-orientate]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#piepoli-2014|piepoli-2014]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the 20th century, the professor of ancient Roman topography [[Giuseppe Lugli]] managed to discover, with the then innovative technique of [[photogrammetry]], what probably was the route of the Appian Way from [[Gravina in Puglia]] (''Silvium'') up to [[Taranto]]. When analysing [[aerophotogrammetry|aerophotogrammetric]] shots of the area, Lugli noticed a path ({{lang-it|tratturo}}) named ''la Tarantina'', whose direction was still largely influenced by the [[centuriation]]; this, according to Lugli, was the path of the Appian Way. This path, as well as the part located in today's [[Apulia]] region, was still in use in the [[Middle Ages]]. A further piece of evidence for Lugli's proposed path is the presence of a number of archaeological remains in that region, among them the ancient settlement of Jesce.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lugli-orientate|lugli-orientate]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#piepoli-2014|piepoli-2014]]&lt;/ref&gt;

By studying the distances given in the [[Antonine Itinerary]], Lugli also assigned the Appian Way stations ''Blera'' and ''Sublupatia'' (which also occurs on the ''[[Tabula Peutingeriana]]'') respectively to the areas ''Murgia Catena'' and ''Taverna'' (between masseria (estate farmhouse) S. Filippo and masseria S. Pietro). However, the toponym ''Murgia Catena'' defined too large an area, so that it didn't allow a clear localization of the Appian Way station. Recently Luciano Piepoli, based on the distances given in the [[Antonine Itinerary]] and on recent archeological findings, has suggested that ''Silvium'' should be ''Santo Staso'', an area very close to [[Gravina in Puglia]], ''Blera'' should be ''masseria Castello'', and ''Sublupatia'' should be ''masseria Caione''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lugli-orientate|lugli-orientate]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#piepoli-2014|piepoli-2014]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extension by Trajan ===
The emperor [[Trajan]] built the [[Via Traiana]], an extension of the Via Appia from Beneventum, reaching Brundisium via [[Canusium]] and [[Bari]]um rather than via Tarentum.  This was commemorated by an arch at Beneventum.

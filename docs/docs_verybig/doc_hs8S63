Even as the D&amp;RGW exploited the best new standard-gauge technology to compete with other transcontinental carriers, the railroad continued to operate the surviving steam-powered [[narrow-gauge]] lines, including the famed narrow-gauge line between [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]] and [[Silverton, Colorado]]. Most of the remaining narrow-gauge trackage was abandoned in the 1950s and 1960s.  At the end of 1970 it operated {{convert|1903|mi|km}} of road on {{convert|3227|mi|km}} of track; that year it carried 7733 ton-miles of revenue freight and 21 million passenger-miles.

Two of the most scenic routes survived in operation by the D&amp;RGW until they were sold to tourist railroad operators.  The [[Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad]] assumed operation of the line between [[Antonito, Colorado]], and [[Chama, New Mexico]], in 1970. The last D&amp;RGW narrow-gauge line, from Durango to Silverton, was sold in 1981 to the [[Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad]], exactly one hundred years after the line went into operation.

=== Consolidation with Southern Pacific ===
In 1988, [[Rio Grande Industries]], the company that controlled the D&amp;RGW under the direction of [[Philip Anschutz]], purchased the [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company]] (SP). The D&amp;RGW used Southern Pacific's name with SP due to its name recognition among shippers. In time, the D&amp;RGW's fast freight philosophy gave way to SP's long-established practice of running long, slow trains. A contributing factor was the rising cost of [[diesel fuel]], a trend that set in after the [[1973 oil crisis]], which gradually undermined the D&amp;RGW's fuel-consuming &quot;fast freight&quot; philosophy. By the early 1990s, the combined Rio Grande/Southern Pacific system had lost much of the competitive advantage that made it attractive to transcontinental shippers, and became largely dependent on hauling the high-quality coal produced in the mine fields of Colorado and Utah.

D&amp;RGW locomotives retained their reporting marks and colors after the consolidation with the Southern Pacific and would do so until the Union Pacific merger. The one noticeable change was to Southern Pacific's &quot;Bloody Nose&quot; paint scheme. The serif font on the sides of the locomotives was replaced by the Rio Grande's &quot;speed lettering&quot;, which was utilized on all SP locomotives built after the merger.

=== Merger with Union Pacific ===
On September 11, 1996, Anschutz sold the combined D&amp;RGW/SP system with the parent company [[Southern Pacific Rail Corporation]] to the [[Union Pacific Corporation]], partly in response to the earlier merger of [[Burlington Northern Railroad|Burlington Northern]] and [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe]] which formed the [[Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway]]. As the Union Pacific absorbed the D&amp;RGW into its system, signs of the fabled mountain railroad's existence are slowly fading away. D&amp;RGW 5371, the only original D&amp;RGW locomotive in full Rio Grande paint on the Union Pacific, was retired by UP in December 2008.  As previously promised by UP, the D&amp;RGW 5371 was donated to the Utah State Railroad Museum at Ogden's Union Station on August 17, 2009, and will reside in the Eccles Rail Center at the south end of the building. The museum is located at 25th Street and Wall Ave in Ogden, Utah. Many other Rio Grande locomotives still run in service with Union Pacific but have been &quot;patch-renumbered,&quot; with a patch applied over the locomotive's number and the number boards replaced. This method allows the locomotives to be numbered into the Union Pacific's roster but is cheaper than fully repainting the engine into UP Armour Yellow.

In 2006, Union Pacific unveiled [[UP 1989]], an [[EMD SD70ACe]] painted in a stylized version of the DRGW color scheme. This unit is one of several SD70ACe locomotives the UP has painted in stylized colors to help preserve the image of the railroads it has merged; the others are [[Missouri Pacific Railroad]], [[Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad]], [[Chicago and North Western Railway]], [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], and [[Western Pacific Railroad]].

==Remnants==
The Union Pacific acquired all D&amp;RG owned assets at the time of the merger. The UP operates the former D&amp;RGW main line as part of its [[Central Corridor (Union Pacific Railroad)|Central Corridor]]. However, several branch lines and other assets have been sold, abandoned or re-purposed. These include several presently operating [[heritage railways]] that trace their origins to the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western.

===Still-active and rebuilt features===
Active rail assets tracing their heritage to the D&amp;RGW that are not part of the Union Pacific network today include:
* [[California Zephyr]] – formerly operated by the D&amp;RGW, is still active, but today operated by [[Amtrak]].
**The Amtrak depots used for the California Zephyr in the cities of [[Helper station|Helper]], [[Green River station|Green River]] and [[Glenwood Springs station|Glenwood Springs]] are the original depots built by the D&amp;RGW. The Amtrak depot in [[Grand Junction station|Grand Junction]] sits next to the abandoned D&amp;RGW depot. 
* [[FrontRunner]] – a [[Commuter rail in North America|commuter rail]] service in Utah. The portion between [[Salt Lake City]] and [[Provo, Utah|Provo]] is a parallel track built alongside the former D&amp;RGW main.
* [[Red Line (TRAX)|Red Line]] of the [[TRAX (light rail)|TRAX]] light rail system in Salt Lake City – The southern half of this line uses the rebuilt right of way of an abandoned DRGW spur for the [[Bingham Canyon mine]]
* [[Rock and Rail LLC]]
* [[San Luis and Rio Grande Railroad]]
* [[S Line (Utah Transit Authority)|S Line]] – a [[streetcar]] line in Salt Lake City that uses the rebuilt right-of-way of D&amp;RG's former [[Sugar House, Utah|Sugar House]] branch.
* [[Ski Train]]
* [[Utah Central Railway (1992)|Utah Central Railway]]

===Heritage railways===
*[[Cumbres &amp; Toltec Scenic Railroad]] is a remnant of the [[narrow gauge]] [[San Juan Line]] (now isolated from the national rail network) that operates scenic trips over this route between [[Antonito, Colorado]] and [[Chama, New Mexico]].
*[[Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad]], which has been operating since 1881, provides scenic day trips from [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]] to [[Silverton, Colorado|Silverton]], along an isolated remnant of the San Juan line.
*[[Heber Valley Historic Railroad]] provides scenic trips through the upper portion of [[Provo Canyon]]. The track was a branch of the D&amp;RG main at Provo, but is today isolated from the national rail network.
*[[Rio Grande Scenic Railroad]] is a heritage train on a still-active branch of the former D&amp;RG.
*[[Royal Gorge Route Railroad]] operates over a {{convert|12|mi|km|adj=on}} portion of the intact, but otherwise disused Royal Gorge/Tennessee Pass line.

===Re-purposed assets===
*[[D &amp; RG Narrow Gauge Trestle]] - A trestle from the abandoned [[Marshall Pass]] line.
*The portion of the former D&amp;RG main between Salt Lake City and [[Ogden, Utah]], abandoned after the merger with the Union Pacific, is now a [[Rail trail]].
*Similarly, the portion of the [[Thistle, Utah|Thistle]]–[[Marysvale, Utah|Marysvale]] branch through [[Marysvale Canyon]] is today a rail trail, which includes several tunnels.

===Museums===
The largest collection of surviving ''[[California Zephyr]]'' equipment can be found at the [[Western Pacific Railroad Museum]] at [[Portola, California]], although this museum focuses on the [[Western Pacific Railroad]], rather than the Rio Grande.

Museums that focus on the D&amp;RG include:
*[[Colorado Railroad Museum]]
*[[Western Mining and Railroad Museum]] in [[Helper, Utah]]
*[[Union Station (Ogden, Utah)]]

Museums using former D&amp;RG depots as buildings include:
*[[Denver and Rio Grande Depot (Montrose, Colorado)]]
*[[Denver and Rio Grande Western Depot (Salt Lake City)]]

A '''television licence''' or '''broadcast receiving licence''' is a payment required in many countries for the reception of television broadcasts, or the possession of a television set where some broadcasts are funded in full or in part by the licence fee paid. The fee is sometimes also required to own a radio or receive radio broadcasts. A TV licence is therefore effectively a [[hypothecated tax]] for the purpose of funding [[public broadcasting]], thus allowing public broadcasters to transmit television programmes without, or with only supplemental, funding from radio and television advertisements. However, in some cases the balance between public funding and advertisements is the opposite – the Polish [[Telewizja Polska|TVP]] broadcaster receives more funds from advertisements than from its TV tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://satkurier.pl/news/78819/koszty-i-zyski-tvp-jako-telewizji-publicznej.html|title=SATKurier.pl / TVP / Koszty i zyski TVP jako telewizji publicznej|website=Satkurier.pl|accessdate=12 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305010530/http://satkurier.pl/news/78819/koszty-i-zyski-tvp-jako-telewizji-publicznej.html|archive-date=5 March 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The early days of broadcasting presented broadcasters with the problem of how to raise funding for their services. Some countries adopted the advertising model, but many others adopted a compulsory public subscription model, with the subscription coming in the form of a broadcast licence paid by households owning a radio set (and later, a TV set).

The UK was the first country to adopt the compulsory public subscription model with the licence fee money going to the [[BBC]], which was formed on 1 January 1927 by [[royal charter]] to produce publicly funded programming yet remain independent from government, both managerially and financially. The licence was originally known as a '''wireless licence'''.

With the arrival of television, some countries created a separate additional television licence, while others simply increased the radio licence fee to cover the additional cost of TV broadcasting, changing the licence's name from &quot;radio licence&quot; to &quot;TV licence&quot; or &quot;receiver licence&quot;. Today most countries fund public radio broadcasting from the same licence fee that is used for television, although a few still have separate radio licences, or apply a lower or no fee at all for consumers who only have a radio. Some countries also have different fees for users with colour or monochrome TV. Many give discounts, or charge no fee, for elderly and/or disabled consumers.

Faced with the problem of licence fee evasion, some countries choose to fund public broadcasters directly from taxation or via other less avoidable methods such as a co-payment with electricity billing. National public broadcasters in some countries also carry supplemental advertising.

The [[Council of Europe]] created the [[European Convention on Transfrontier Television]] in 1989 that regulates among other things advertising standards, time and the format of breaks, which also has an indirect effect on the usage of licensing.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} In 1993, this treaty entered into force when it achieved seven ratifications including five EU member states. It has since been acceded to by 34 countries, {{as of|2010|lc=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;ectt-cets-132&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes that two-thirds of the countries in Europe and half of the countries in Asia and Africa use television licences to fund public television. TV licensing is rare in the Americas, largely being confined to French [[overseas department]]s and [[British Overseas Territories]].

In some countries, radio channels and broadcasters' web sites are also funded by a radio receiver licence, giving access to radio and web services free of commercial advertising.

The actual cost and implementation of the television licence varies greatly from country to country. Below is a listing of the licence fee in various countries around the world.

===Albania===
The Albanian licence fee is 100 [[Albanian lek|lekë]] (€0.80) per month, paid in the electricity bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qbz.gov.al/botime/fletore_zyrtare/2014/PDF-2014/196-2014.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=31 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501111613/http://www.qbz.gov.al/botime/fletore_zyrtare/2014/PDF-2014/196-2014.pdf |archive-date=1 May 2015 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the licence fee makes up only a small part of public broadcaster [[Radio Televizioni Shqiptar|RTSH]]'s funding. RTSH is mainly funded directly from the government through taxes (58%), the remaining 42% comes from commercials and the licence fee.

===Austria===
Under the [[Austria]] RGG (TV and Radio Licence Law), all broadcasting reception equipment in use or operational at a given location must be registered. The location of the equipment is taken to be places of residence or any other premises with a uniform purpose of use.

The agency responsible for licence administration in Austria is [[GIS - Gebühren Info Service GmbH]], a 100% subsidiary of the Austrian Broadcasting Company ([[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]), as well as an agency of the Ministry of Finance, charged with performing functions concerning national interests. Transaction volume in 2007 amounted to €682&amp;nbsp; million, 66% of which are allocated to the ORF for financing the organization and its programs, and 35% are allocated to the federal government and the local governments (taxes and funding of local cultural activities). GIS employs some 191 people and approximately 125 freelancers in field service. 3.4&amp;nbsp; million Austrian households are registered with GIS. The percentage of licence evaders in Austria amounts to 2.5%.

The main principle of GIS's communication strategy is to inform instead of control. To achieve this goal GIS uses a four-channel communication strategy:
* Above-the-line activities (advertising campaigns in printed media, radio and TV).
* Direct Mail.
* Distribution channels – outlets where people can acquire the necessary forms for registering (post offices, banks, tobacconists &amp; five GIS Service Centers throughout Austria).
* Field service – customer consultants visiting households not yet registered.

The annual television &amp; radio licence varies in price depending on which [[States of Austria|state]] one lives in. Annual fees from April 2017 are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Übersicht|url=https://www.gis.at/gebuehren/uebersicht/|website=GIS|accessdate=24 February 2018|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bosnia and Herzegovina ===
The licence fee in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] is around €46 per year.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bosnian War|war]] and the associated collapse of infrastructure caused very high [[evasion (law)|evasion]] rates. This has in part been resolved by collecting the licence fee as part of a household's monthly telephone bill. The licence fee is divided between three broadcasters:
* 50% for [[BHRT]] – ('''Radio and Television of Bosnia and Herzegovina''') as main '''state level''' radio and television broadcaster in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (also the only member of the [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]]).
* 25% for [[RTVFBiH]] – (Radio-Television of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina) radio and television broadcaster that primarily serves the population in the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Federation of BiH entity]]
* 25% for [[RTRS]] – (Radio-Television of the Republika Srpska) radio and television broadcaster which primarily serves the population of [[Republika Srpska]] entity.
There is a public corporation in the establishment which should be consisted of all [[public broadcasting|public broadcasters]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|BiH]].

===Croatia===
The licence fee in [[Croatia]] is regulated with the [[Croatian Radiotelevision]] Act.&lt;ref name=&quot;croatia-law&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2010}}, the last incarnation of the act dates from 2003.

The licence fee is charged to all owners of equipment capable of receiving TV and radio broadcasts. The total yearly amount of the fee is set each year as a percentage of the average net salary in the previous year, currently equal to 1.5%.&lt;ref name=&quot;croatia-law&quot;/&gt; This works out at about €137 per year per household with at least one radio or TV receiver.

The fee is the main source of revenue for the national broadcaster [[Croatian Radiotelevision|Hrvatska Radiotelevizija (HRT)]], and a secondary source of income for other national and local broadcasters, which receive a minority share of this money. The Statute of the Croatian Radiotelevision&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.hrt.hr/uploads/media/Statut_HRT-a.doc
| language = Croatian
| title = Statut Hrvatske Radiotelevizije
| publisher = [[Croatian Radiotelevision]]

| accessdate =14 June 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; further divides their majority share to 66% for television and 34% for the radio, and sets out further financial rules.

According to law, advertisements and several other sources of income are allowed to HRT. However, the percentage of air time which may be devoted to advertising is limited by law to 9% per hour and is lower than the one that applies to commercial broadcasters. In addition, other rules govern advertising on HRT, including a limit on a single commercial during short breaks, no breaks during films, etc.

Croatian television law was formed in compliance with the [[European Convention on Transfrontier Television]] that Croatia had joined between 1999 and 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;ectt-cets-132&quot;/&gt;

===Czech Republic===
The licence fee in the [[Czech Republic]] is 135 Kč (€4.992 [using exchange rate 27 July 2015]) per month as from 1 January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://img9.ceskatelevize.cz/boss/pages/english/pdf/czech_television_2009.pdf Czech Television in 2009], Czech Television.&lt;/ref&gt; This increase is to compensate for the abolition of paid advertisements except in narrowly defined circumstances during a transitional period. Each household pays for one TV licence or radio licence regardless of how many televisions and radios they own. Corporations and the self-employed must pay for a licence for each television and radio.

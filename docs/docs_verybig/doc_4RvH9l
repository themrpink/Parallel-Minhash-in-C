Weaving is done by intersecting the longitudinal threads, the '''[[Warp (weaving)|warp]]''', i.e. &quot;that which is thrown across&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=warp|title=warp - Search Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the transverse threads, the '''[[weft]]''', i.e. &quot;that which is woven&quot;.

The major components of the loom are the warp beam, [[heddle]]s, harnesses or shafts (as few as two, four is common, sixteen not unheard of), [[Shuttle (weaving)|shuttle]], [[reed (weaving)|reed]] and takeup roll. In the loom, yarn processing includes shedding, picking, battening and taking-up operations. These are the principal motions.

*'''Shedding'''. Shedding is the raising of part of the [[warp (weaving)|warp]] yarn to form a [[shed (weaving)|shed]] (the vertical space between the raised and unraised warp yarns), through which the filling yarn, carried by the shuttle, can be inserted, forming the weft. On the modern loom, simple and intricate shedding operations are performed automatically by the heddle or heald frame, also known as a harness. This is a rectangular frame to which a series of wires, called heddles or healds, are attached. The yarns are passed through the eye holes of the heddles, which hang vertically from the harnesses. The weave pattern determines which harness controls which warp yarns, and the number of harnesses used depends on the complexity of the weave. Two common methods of controlling the heddles are [[Dobby loom|dobbies]] and a [[Jacquard Loom|Jacquard Head]].
[[File:Weaving shuttles.JPG|thumb|Shuttles]]
*'''Picking'''. As the harnesses raise the [[heddle]]s or healds, which raise the warp yarns, the shed is created. The filling yarn is inserted through the shed by a small carrier device called a shuttle. The shuttle is normally pointed at each end to allow passage through the shed. In a traditional shuttle loom, the filling yarn is wound onto a quill, which in turn is mounted in the shuttle. The filling yarn emerges through a hole in the shuttle as it moves across the loom. A single crossing of the shuttle from one side of the loom to the other is known as a pick. As the shuttle moves back and forth across the shed, it weaves an edge, or [[selvage]], on each side of the fabric to prevent the fabric from raveling.
*'''Battening'''. Between the heddles and the takeup roll, the warp threads pass through another frame called the reed (which resembles a comb). The portion of the fabric that has already been formed but not yet rolled up on the takeup roll is called the fell. After the shuttle moves across the loom laying down the fill yarn, the weaver uses the reed to press (or batten) each filling yarn against the fell. Conventional shuttle looms can operate at speeds of about 150 to 160 picks per minute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collier 1970 104&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Collier|1970|p=104}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two secondary motions, because with each weaving operation the newly constructed fabric must be wound on a cloth beam. This process is called taking up. At the same time, the warp yarns must be let off or released from the warp beams. To become fully automatic, a loom needs a tertiary motion, the filling stop motion. This will brake the loom if the weft thread breaks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collier 1970 104&quot;/&gt; An automatic loom requires 0.125&amp;nbsp;hp to 0.5&amp;nbsp;hp to operate.

==Types of looms==

===Back strap loom===
[[File:SantaMariadelRio145.webm|thumb|Woman weaving a silk [[rebozo]] on a backstrap loom at the Taller Escuela de Rebocería in Santa Maria del Rio, San Luis Potosí]]
[[File:T'nalak weaver at Lake Sebu, South Cotabato.jpg|thumb|[[T'boli people|T'boli]] dream weavers using two-bar bamboo backstrap looms (''legogong'') to weave [[t'nalak]] cloth from [[abacá]] fiber.

The back strap loom is a simple loom that has its roots in ancient civilizations. The [[Andes Textiles]], still made today with the back strap loom, originated thousands of years ago with the same back strap loom process. It consists of two sticks or bars between which the warps are stretched. One bar is attached to a fixed object and the other to the weaver, usually by means of a strap around the back. The weaver leans back and uses her body weight to tension the loom. On traditional looms, the two main sheds are operated by means of a shed roll over which one set of warps pass, and continuous string heddles which encase each of the warps in the other set. To open the shed controlled by the string heddles, the weaver relaxes tension on the warps and raises the heddles. The other shed is usually opened by simply drawing the shed roll toward the weaver.

Both simple and complex textiles can be woven on this loom. Width is limited to how far the weaver can reach from side to side to pass the shuttle. Warp faced textiles, often decorated with intricate pick-up patterns woven in complementary and supplementary warp techniques are woven by indigenous peoples today around the world. They produce such things as belts, ponchos, bags, hatbands and carrying cloths. Supplementary weft patterning and brocading is practiced in many regions. Balanced weaves are also possible on the backstrap loom. Today, commercially produced backstrap loom kits often include a rigid heddle.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Warp-weighted loom===
{{main|Warp-weighted loom}}
The [[warp-weighted loom]] is a vertical loom that may have originated in the [[Neolithic]] period. The earliest evidence of warp-weighted looms comes from sites belonging to the [[Starčevo culture]] in modern Serbia and Hungary and from late Neolithic sites in Switzerland.{{sfn|Barber|1991|pp=93–96}} This loom was used in [[Ancient Greece]], and spread north and west throughout Europe thereafter.{{sfn|Crowfoot|1937|p=36}} Its defining characteristic is hanging weights (loom weights) which keep bundles of the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] threads taut. Frequently, extra warp thread is wound around the weights. When a weaver has reached the bottom of the available warp, the completed section can be rolled around the top beam, and additional lengths of warp threads can be unwound from the weights to continue. This frees the weaver from vertical size constraint.

===Drawloom===
A drawloom is a hand-loom for weaving figured cloth. In a drawloom, a &quot;figure harness&quot; is used to control each warp thread separately.{{sfn|Burnham|1980|p=48}} A drawloom requires two operators, the weaver and an assistant called a &quot;drawboy&quot; to manage the figure harness. The earliest confirmed drawloom fabrics come from the [[Chu (state)|State of Chu]] and date c. 400 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;broudy 1979 124&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Broudy|1979|p=124}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars attribute the invention of the drawloom to the ancient Chinese, although some speculate an independent invention from ancient [[Syria]] since drawloom fabrics found in [[Dura-Europas]] are thought to date before 256 AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;broudy 1979 124&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Forbes|1987|pp=218, 220}} The draw loom for patterned weaving was invented in ancient China during the Han Dynasty.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=Explorations in the History of Machines and Mechanisms: Proceedings of HMM2012 (History of Mechanism and Machine Science) |url=https://archive.org/details/explorationshist00moon |url-access=limited |last= Ceccarelli |first= Marco |last2=López-Cajún |first2=Carlos  |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |pages=[https://archive.org/details/explorationshist00moon/page/n226 219]–220 |isbn=978-9400799448}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese weavers and artisans used foot-powered multi-harness looms and jacquard looms for silk weaving and embroidery; both of which were cottage industries with imperial workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A History of Mechanical Inventions |last= Usher |first= Abbott Payson |year=2011 |publisher= Dover Publications |page=54 |isbn=978-0486255934}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese-invented drawloom enhanced and sped up the production of silk and play a significant role in Chinese silk weaving. The loom was later introduced to Persia, India, and Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;

A handloom is a simple machine used for weaving. In a wooden vertical-shaft looms, the [[heddle]]s are fixed in place in the shaft. The warp threads pass alternately through a heddle, and through a space between the heddles (the [[shed (weaving)|shed]]), so that raising the shaft raises half the threads (those passing through the heddles), and lowering the shaft lowers the same threads — the threads passing through the spaces between the heddles remain in place. This was a great invention in the 13th century.

===Flying shuttle===
{{main|Flying shuttle}}
Hand weavers could only weave a cloth as wide as their armspan. If cloth needed to be wider, two people would do the task (often this would be an adult with a child). [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]] (1704–1779) patented the [[flying shuttle]] in 1733. The weaver held a picking stick that was attached by cords to a device at both ends of the shed. With a flick of the wrist, one cord was pulled and the shuttle was propelled through the shed to the other end with considerable force, speed and efficiency. A flick in the opposite direction and the shuttle was propelled back. A single weaver had control of this motion but the flying shuttle could weave much wider fabric than an arm's length at much greater speeds than had been achieved with the hand thrown shuttle.

The ''flying shuttle'' was one of the key developments in [[weaving]] that helped fuel the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The whole picking motion no longer relied on manual skill and it was just a matter of time before it could be powered.

===''Haute-lisse'' and ''basse-lisse'' looms===
Looms used for weaving traditional [[tapestry]] are classified as ''[[Warp (weaving)|haute-lisse]]'' looms, where the warp is suspended vertically between two rolls. In ''basse-lisse'' looms, however, the warp extends horizontally between the two rolls.

===Ribbon weaving===
{{main|Inkle weaving}}

===Traditional looms===
Several other types of hand looms exist, including the simple frame loom, pit loom, free-standing loom, and the pegged loom. Each of these can be constructed, and provide work and income in developing economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.cd3wd.com/cd3wd_40/vita/handloom/en/handloom.htm |title=Handloom Construction: A Practical Guide for the Non-Expert |first=Joan |last=Koster |date=1978 |publisher= Volunteers in Technical Assistance, Inc. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302081647/http://www.cd3wd.com/cd3wd_40/vita/handloom/en/handloom.htm |archivedate=2 March 2014 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest evidence of a horizontal loom is found on a pottery dish in [[ancient Egypt]], dated to 4400 BC. It was a frame loom, equipped with foot pedals to lift the warp threads, leaving the weaver's hands free to pass and beat the weft thread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bruno |first1=Leonard C. |last2=Olendorf |first2=Donna |title=Science and technology firsts |date=1997 |publisher=[[Gale Research]] |isbn=9780787602567 |page=[https://archive.org/details/sciencetechnolog0000brun/page/2 2] |url=https://archive.org/details/sciencetechnolog0000brun |url-access=registration |quote=4400 B.C. Earliest evidence of the use of a horizontal loom is its depiction on a pottery dish found in Egypt and dated to this time. These first true frame looms are equipped with foot pedals to lift the warp threads, leaving the weaver's hands free to pass and beat the weft thread.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power looms==
{{Main|Power loom}}
[[File:QSMM Two Lancashire looms.ogg|thumb|Two Lancashire looms in the [[Queen Street Mill]] weaving shed, [[Burnley]]]]
[[File:Weben in der Tuchfabrik Müller.ogv|thumb|A 1939 loom working at the [[Mueller Cloth Mill]] museum in [[Euskirchen]], Germany.]]

[[Edmund Cartwright]] built and patented a [[power loom]] in 1785, and it was this that was adopted by the nascent cotton industry in England. The silk loom made by [[Jacques Vaucanson]] in 1745 operated on the same principles but was not developed further. The invention of the [[flying shuttle]] by [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]] was critical to the development of a commercially successful power loom.{{sfn|Marsden|1895|p=57}} Cartwright's loom was impractical but the ideas behind it were developed by numerous inventors in the Manchester area of England where, by 1818, there were 32 factories containing 5,732 looms.{{sfn|Guest|1823|p=46}}

[[Horrocks loom]] was viable, but it was the [[Roberts Loom]] in 1830 that marked the turning point.{{sfn|Marsden|1895|p=76}} Incremental changes to the three motions continued to be made. The problems of sizing, stop-motions, consistent take-up, and a [[Temple (weaving)|temple]] to maintain the width remained. In 1841, Kenworthy and [[Howard &amp; Bullough|Bullough]] produced the [[Lancashire Loom]]{{sfn|Marsden|1895|p=94}} which was self-acting or semi-automatic. This enables a youngster to run six looms at the same time. Thus, for simple calicos, the power loom became more economical to run than the hand loom – with complex patterning that used a dobby or Jacquard head, jobs were still [[domestic system|put out]] to handloom weavers until the 1870s. Incremental changes were made such as the [[Dickinson Loom]], culminating in the [[Keighley]]-born inventor Northrop, who was working for the [[Draper Corporation]] in [[Hopedale, Massachusetts|Hopedale]] producing the fully automatic [[Northrop Loom]]. This loom recharged the shuttle when the [[pirn]] was empty. The Draper E and X models became the leading products from 1909. They were challenged by synthetic fibres such as [[rayon]].{{sfn|Mass|1990}}
By 1942, faster, more efficient, and shuttleless [[Sulzer (manufacturer)|Sulzer]] and [[rapier loom]]s had been introduced.{{sfn|Collier|1970|p=111}} Modern industrial looms can weave at 2,000 [[weft|weft insertion]]s per minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=S. |last=Rajagopalan |title=Advances in Weaving Technology and Looms |publisher=S.S.M.

===Weft insertion===
[[File:Greifer.JPG|thumb|A [[Picanol]] rapier loom]]
Different types of looms are most often defined by the way that the weft, or pick, is inserted into the warp. Many advances in weft insertion have been made in order to make manufactured cloth more cost effective. There are five main types of weft insertion and they are as follows:
* Shuttle: The first-ever powered looms were shuttle-type looms. Spools of weft are unravelled as the shuttle travels across the shed. This is very similar to projectile methods of weaving, except that the weft spool is stored on the shuttle. These looms are considered obsolete in modern industrial fabric manufacturing because they can only reach a maximum of 300 picks per minute.
* Air jet: An [[Air jet loom|air-jet loom]] uses short quick bursts of compressed air to propel the weft through the shed in order to complete the weave. Air jets are the fastest traditional method of weaving in modern manufacturing and they are able to achieve up to 1,500 picks per minute. However, the amounts of compressed air required to run these looms, as well as the complexity in the way the air jets are positioned, make them more costly than other looms. 
* Water jet: Water-jet looms use the same principle as air-jet looms, but they take advantage of pressurized water to propel the weft. The advantage of this type of weaving is that water power is cheaper where water is directly available on site. Picks per minute can reach as high as 1,000. 
* [[Rapier loom]]: This type of weaving is very versatile, in that rapier looms can weave using a large variety of threads.  There are several types of rapiers, but they all use a hook system attached to a rod or metal band to pass the pick across the shed. These machines regularly reach 700 picks per minute in normal production.
* Projectile: [[Projectile loom]]s utilize an object that is propelled across the shed, usually by spring power, and is guided across the width of the cloth by a series of reeds. The projectile is then removed from the weft fibre and it is returned to the opposite side of the machine so it can be reused. Multiple projectiles are in use in order to increase the pick speed. Maximum speeds on these machines can be as high as 1,050 ppm.

===Shedding===

====Dobby looms====
A [[dobby loom]] is a type of floor loom that controls the whole warp threads using a dobby head. Dobby is a corruption of &quot;draw boy&quot; which refers to the weaver's helpers who used to control the warp thread by pulling on draw threads. A dobby loom is an alternative to a treadle loom, where multiple heddles (shafts) were controlled by foot treadles – one for each heddle.

====Jacquard looms====
{{main|Jacquard loom}}
The '''Jacquard loom''' is a mechanical loom, invented by [[Joseph Marie Jacquard]] in 1801, which simplifies the process of manufacturing [[textiles]] with complex patterns such as [[Brocade (fabric)|brocade]], [[damask]] and [[matelasse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Eric |last=Hobsbawm |title=The Age of Revolution |location=London |orig-year=1962 |date=2008 |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christinalynn.com/fabric-glossary.shtml |title=Fabric Glossary |work=Christina Lynn |accessdate=21 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105170019/http://www.christinalynn.com/fabric-glossary.shtml |archivedate=5 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The loom is controlled by [[punched card]]s with punched holes, each row of which corresponds to one row of the design. Multiple rows of holes are punched on each card and the many cards that compose the design of the textile are strung together in order. It is based on earlier inventions by the Frenchmen [[Basile Bouchon]] (1725), Jean Baptiste Falcon (1728) and [[Jacques Vaucanson]] (1740).{{sfn|Razy|1913|p=120}} To call it a loom is a misnomer, a Jacquard head could be attached to a power loom or a hand loom, the head controlling which warp thread was raised during shedding. Multiple shuttles could be used to control the colour of the weft during picking.  The Jacquard loom is the predecessor to the [[Punched card input/output|computer punched card reader]]s of the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Geselowitz|first1=Michael N.|title=The Jacquard Loom: A Driver of the Industrial Revolution|url=http://theinstitute.ieee.org/tech-history/technology-history/the-jacquard-loom-a-driver-of-the-industrial-revolution|work=The Institute: The IEEE news source|accessdate=31 March 2018|date=18 July 2016|publisher=IEEE|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180401074908/http://theinstitute.ieee.org/tech-history/technology-history/the-jacquard-loom-a-driver-of-the-industrial-revolution|archivedate=1 April 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Circular looms==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Six shuttle circular loom machine.jpg|thumb|typical circular loom]] --&gt;
A circular loom is used to create a seamless tube of fabric for products such as hosiery, sacks, clothing, fabric hose (such as fire hose) and the like. Circular looms can be small jigs used for [[circular knitting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIA53WfVv04 |via=YouTube |title=How to: Cast on/Knit using a Circular Loom |author=Jocelyn C. |date=22 December 2008 |access-date=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or large high-speed machines for modern garments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starlinger.com/en/packaging/circular-looms/ |work=Starlinger |title=Circular Looms |access-date=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern circular looms use up to ten shuttles driven from below in a circular motion by electromagnets for the weft yarns, and cams to control the warp threads. The warps rise and fall with each shuttle passage, unlike the common practice of lifting all of them at once.

== Symbolism and cultural significance ==

The loom is a symbol of [[Creation myth|cosmic creation]] and the structure upon which individual destiny is woven. This symbolism is encapsulated in the [[Classical mythology|classical myth]] of [[Arachne]] who was changed into a spider by the goddess [[Athena]], who was jealous of her skill at the godlike craft of weaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tresidder|first1=Jack|title=The Hutchinson Dictionary of Symbols|date=1997|publisher=Helicon Publishers|location=London|isbn=1-85986-059-1|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Maya civilization]] the goddess [[Ixchel]] taught the first woman how to weave at the beginning of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenbaum|first1=Brenda P.|title=Mayan Women, Weaving and Ethnic Identity: a Historical Essay|journal=Guatemala: Museo Ixchel del Traje Indigena|date=1990|pages=157–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drainage''' is the natural or artificial removal of a surface's water and [[groundwater|sub-surface water]] from an area with excess  of water. The internal drainage of most [[agricultural]] [[soil]]s is good enough to prevent severe [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]] (anaerobic conditions that harm root growth), but many soils need artificial drainage to improve production or to manage water supplies.

==History==

===Early history===
[[File:A drain at Lothal.jpg|thumb|Remains of a drain at [[Lothal]] circa 3000 BC]]

The [[Indus Valley Civilization]] had advanced [[sewerage]] and drainage systems. All houses in the major cities of [[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjo-daro]] had access to water and drainage facilities. Waste water was directed to covered [[gravity sewer]]s, which lined the major streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arthur Coterell|title=The Encyclopedia of Ancient Civilisations|pages=176–178|publisher=Rainbird Publishers|year=1980|isbn=0-7112-0036-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th and 19th century===
[[Image:Tank Stream.jpg|thumb|[[Tank Stream]], a historical drain in the City of Sydney]]

The invention of hollow-pipe drainage is credited to Sir Hugh Dalrymple, who died in 1753.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broadside eulogy dedicated to Patrick, Earl of Marchmount, Sir Hugh Dalrymple, and others|url=http://digital.nls.uk/broadsides/broadside.cfm/id/15893|publisher=National Library of Scotland|accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current practices==

===Geotextiles===
New drainage systems incorporate [[geotextile]] filters that retain and prevent fine [[Particle size|grains]] of [[soil]] from passing into and clogging the drain. Geotextiles are synthetic textile fabrics specially manufactured for [[civil engineering|civil]] and [[environmental engineering]] applications. Geotextiles are designed to retain fine soil particles while allowing water to pass through. In a typical drainage system, they would be laid along a trench which would then be filled with coarse [[granular material]]: [[gravel]], [[animal shell|sea shell]]s, stone or [[rock (geology)|rock]]. The geotextile is then folded over the top of the stone and the trench is then covered by soil. [[Groundwater]] seeps through the geotextile and flows through the stone to an outfell. In high [[groundwater]] conditions a perforated plastic ([[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] or [[Polyethylene|PE]]) pipe is laid along the base of the drain to increase the volume of water transported in the drain.

Alternatively, a prefabricated plastic drainage system made of [[High-density polyethylene|HDPE]], often incorporating geotextile, [[Coir|coco fiber]] or [[Cloth|rag]] [[filter (water)|filter]]s can be considered. The use of these materials has become increasingly more common due to their ease of use which eliminates the need for transporting and laying stone drainage aggregate which is invariably more expensive than a synthetic drain and concrete liners.

Over the past 30 years geotextile, PVC filters and HDPE filters have become the most commonly used soil filter media. They are cheap to produce and easy to lay, with factory controlled properties that ensure long term filtration performance even in fine silty soil conditions.

===21st century alternatives===
Seattle's Public Utilities created a pilot program called Street Edge Alternatives (SEA Streets) Project. The project focuses on designing a system &quot;to provide drainage that more closely mimics the natural landscape prior to development than traditional piped systems&quot;.&lt;ref name=seattle&gt;[http://www.seattle.gov/UTIL/About_SPU/Drainage_&amp;_Sewer_System/Natural_Drainage_Systems/Street_Edge_Alternatives/index.asp Seattle: Natural Drainage Systems]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629082156/http://www.seattle.gov/UTIL/About_SPU/Drainage_%26_Sewer_System/Natural_Drainage_Systems/Street_Edge_Alternatives/index.asp |date=June 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The streets are characterized by ditches along the side of the roadway, with plantings designed throughout the area.
An emphasis on non curbed sidewalks allows water to flow more freely into the areas of permeable surface on the side of the streets. Because of the plantings, the run off water from the urban area does not all directly go into the ground, but can also be absorbed into the surrounding environment.
Monitoring conducted by Seattle Public Utilities reports a 99 percent reduction of storm water leaving the drainage project&lt;ref name=seattle/&gt;

Drainage has undergone a large-scale environmental review in the recent past in the United Kingdom. [[Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems]] (SUDS) are designed to encourage contractors to install drainage system that more closely mimic the natural flow of water in nature.  Since 2010 local and neighbourhood planning in the UK is required by law to factor SUDS into any development projects that they are responsible for. 

[[Slot drain]]age has proved the most breakthrough product of the last twenty years as a drainage option. As a channel drainage system it is designed to eliminate the need for further pipework systems to be installed in parallel to the drainage, reducing the environmental impact of production as well as improving water collection. [[Stainless steel]], [[concrete]] channel, [[PVC]] and [[HDPE]] are all materials available for slot drainage which have become industry standards on construction projects.

===Drainage in the construction industry===
[[Image:SinkPlumbing.jpg|thumb|upright|Piping being placed for a sink]]
The [[civil engineer]] is responsible for drainage in construction projects. They set out from the plans all the [[road]]s, [[street gutter]]s, drainage, [[culvert]]s and [[sewerage|sewers]] involved in [[construction]] operations. During the construction process he/she will set out all the necessary levels for each of the previously mentioned factors.
&lt;!-- There are roughly 38,700 technical people, including site/civil engineers, employed in the construction industry. Most work for a [[general contractor]] or a specialist [[subcontractor]]. -- Where? In the whole world?--&gt;

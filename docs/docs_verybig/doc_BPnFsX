'''''Colorless green ideas sleep furiously''''' is a sentence composed by [[Noam Chomsky]] in his 1957 book ''[[Syntactic Structures]]'' as an example of a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] that is [[grammatically]] correct, but [[semantically]] [[Nonsense|nonsensical]]. The sentence was originally used in his 1955 thesis ''[[The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory]]'' and in his 1956 paper &quot;Three Models for the Description of Language&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;chomsky1956&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Chomsky | first=Noam |date=September 1956 | doi=10.1109/TIT.1956.1056813 | title=Three Models for the Description of Language | journal=IRE Transactions on Information Theory | volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=113–124 |url=https://chomsky.info/wp-content/uploads/195609-.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|116}} Although the sentence is grammatically correct, no obvious [[understandable]] meaning can be derived from it, and thus it demonstrates the distinction between [[syntax]] and [[semantics]]. As an example of a [[category mistake]], it was used to show the inadequacy of certain probabilistic models of grammar, and the need for more structured models.

==Details==
Chomsky writes in his 1957 book ''[[Syntactic Structures]]'': {{quote|
# Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
# *Furiously sleep ideas green colorless.{{efn|In linguistics, an [[asterisk]] is used to denote a sentence that is ungrammatical.}}}}

It is fair to assume that neither sentence (1) nor (2) (nor indeed any part of these sentences) has ever occurred in an English discourse. Hence, in any statistical model for grammaticalness, these sentences will be ruled out on identical grounds as equally &quot;remote&quot; from English. Yet (1), though nonsensical, is grammatical, while (2) is not grammatical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Chomsky |first= Noam |authorlink= Noam Chomsky |title= Syntactic Structures |year= 1957 |publisher= Mouton |location= The Hague/Paris | page=15 |isbn= 3-11-017279-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chomsky1956&quot; /&gt;

While the meaninglessness of the sentence is often considered fundamental to Chomsky's point, Chomsky was only relying on the sentences having never been spoken before. Thus, even if one were to ascribe a likely and reasonable meaning to the sentence, the [[grammaticality]] of the sentence is concrete despite being the first time a person had ever uttered the statement, or any part thereof in such a combination. This was used then as a counter-example to the idea that the human speech engine was based upon statistical models, such as a [[Markov chain]], or simple statistics of words following others.

==Attempts at meaningful interpretations==
The sentence can be partially interpreted through [[polysemy]]. Both ''green'' and ''colorless'' have figurative meanings, which allow ''colorless'' to be interpreted as &quot;nondescript&quot; and ''green'' as either &quot;immature&quot; or pertaining to environmental consciousness. The sentence can therefore be construed as &quot;nondescript immature ideas have violent nightmares&quot;, a phrase with less oblique semantics. In particular, the phrase can have legitimate [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] too, if ''green'' is understood to mean &quot;newly formed&quot; and ''sleep'' can be used to figuratively express mental or verbal dormancy. &quot;Furiously&quot; remains problematic when applied to the verb &quot;sleep&quot;, since &quot;furiously&quot; denotes &quot;angrily&quot;, &quot;violently&quot;, and &quot;intensely energetically&quot;, meanings which are generally incompatible with sleep, dormancy, and unconscious agents typically construed as conscious ones, e.g. animals or humans, which truly &quot;sleep&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Furiously&quot; American Heritage Dictionary, 2014. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/furiously?s=t&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers have attempted to provide the sentence meaning through context, one of the first of which were written by Russian-American linguist [[Roman Jakobson]] (1959)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roman Jakobson|author-link=Roman Jakobson|chapter=Boas' view of grammatical meaning|title=The anthropology of Franz Boas; Essays on the Centennial of His Birth|edition=American Anthropological Association, Memoir LXXX|location=[[Menasha, Wisconsin]]|publisher=[[American Anthropological Association]]|year=1959|pages=134-145}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Chinese linguist [[Yuen Ren Chao]] (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Chao | first= Yuen Ren | authorlink= Yuen Ren Chao | title= Making Sense Out of Nonsense | url=http://www-linguistics.stanford.edu/Archives/Sesquipedalian/1996-97/msg00033.html  | work=The Sesquipedalian, vol. VII, no. 32 (June 12, 1997) | accessdate=2006-08-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060830210332/http://www-linguistics.stanford.edu/Archives/Sesquipedalian/1996-97/msg00033.html |archivedate = 2006-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hollander]] wrote a poem titled [http://web.mit.edu/24.900/www/poem.html &quot;Coiled Alizarine&quot;] in his book ''The Night Mirror'' which ends with Chomsky's sentence. [[Clive James]] wrote a poem titled &quot;A Line and a Theme from Noam Chomsky&quot; in his book ''Other Passports: Poems 1958–1985''. It opens with Chomsky's second meaningless sentence and discusses the [[Vietnam War]].

In 1985, a literary competition was held at [[Stanford University]] in which the contestants were invited to make Chomsky's sentence meaningful using not more than 100 words of prose or 14 lines of verse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.linguistlist.org/issues/2/2-457.html#2 | title=LINGUIST List 2.457  | date= 1991-09-03| accessdate=2007-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- I've made some changes here to dictate sensical meaning vs. other meaning.  It's hard to argue that the sentence cannot have a meaning (meaningless) while it's easy to argue that it is patent nonsense (nonsensical).  The quote of Chomsky above indicates he felt the sentence to be nonsensical, not meaningless.  As such, providing any meaning at all to the sentence would be a counter-example to the position that it is meaningless, yet one would have to actually give a common and clear sensical meaning to be a counter-example of nonsense. [but &quot;sensical&quot; is not really a word] oops :( it's a colloquial word, but not appropriate for an encyclopedia entry. --&gt;
An example entry from the competition, from C.M. Street, is:
{{quote|It can only be the thought of verdure to come, which prompts us in the autumn to buy these dormant white lumps of vegetable matter covered by a brown papery skin, and lovingly to plant them and care for them. It is a marvel to me that under this cover they are labouring unseen at such a rate within to give us the sudden awesome beauty of spring flowering bulbs. While winter reigns the earth reposes but these colourless green ideas sleep furiously.}}

==Statistical challenges==
Fernando Pereira of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] has fitted a simple statistical Markov model to a body of newspaper text, and shown that under this model, ''Furiously sleep ideas green colorless'' is about 200,000 times less probable than ''Colorless green ideas sleep furiously''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pereira |first=Fernando |year=2000 |url=http://www.cis.upenn.edu/%7epereira/papers/rsoc.pdf |title=Formal grammar and information theory: together again? |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |volume=358 |issue=1769 |pages=1239–1253 |doi=10.1098/rsta.2000.0583 |access-date=2006-03-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624100428/http://www.cis.upenn.edu/%7epereira/papers/rsoc.pdf |archive-date=2006-06-24 |url-status=dead }}. See also [http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000025.html this post] at [[Language Log]].&lt;/ref&gt;

This statistical model defines a similarity metric, whereby sentences which are more like those within a corpus in certain respects are assigned higher values than sentences less alike. Pereira's model assigns an ungrammatical version of the same sentence a lower probability than the syntactically correct form demonstrating that statistical models can learn grammaticality distinctions with minimal linguistic assumptions. However, it is not clear that the model assigns every ungrammatical sentence a lower probability than every grammatical sentence. That is, ''colorless green ideas sleep furiously'' may still be statistically more &quot;remote&quot; from English than some ungrammatical sentences. To this, it may be argued that ''no'' current theory of grammar is capable of distinguishing ''all'' grammatical English sentences from ungrammatical ones.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Related and similar examples==
The [[France|French]] [[syntax|syntactician]] [[Lucien Tesnière]] came up with the [[French language]] sentence &quot;Le silence vertébral indispose la voile licite&quot; (&quot;The vertebral silence indisposes the licit sail&quot;).

The game of ''[[exquisite corpse]]'' is a method for generating nonsense sentences. It was named after the first sentence generated in the game in 1925: ''Le cadavre exquis boira le vin nouveau'' (the exquisite corpse will drink the new wine).

In the popular game of &quot;[[Mad Libs]]&quot;, a chosen player asks each other player to provide parts of speech without providing any contextual information (e.g., &quot;Give me a proper noun&quot;, or &quot;Give me an adjective&quot;), and these words are inserted into pre-composed sentences with a correct grammatical structure, but in which certain words have been omitted. The humor of the game is in the generation of sentences which are grammatical but which are meaningless or have absurd or ambiguous meanings (such as 'loud sharks'). The game also tends to generate humorous [[double entendres]].

There are likely earlier examples of such sentences, possibly from the philosophy of language literature, but not necessarily uncontroversial ones, given that the focus has been mostly on borderline cases. For example, followers of [[logical positivism]] hold that &quot;metaphysical&quot; (i.e. not [[Empirical validation|empirically verifiable]]) statements are simply meaningless; e.g. [[Rudolf Carnap]] wrote an article where he argued that almost every sentence from [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] was grammatically correct, yet meaningless. 

The philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] used the sentence &quot;Quadruplicity drinks procrastination&quot; in his &quot;An Inquiry into Meaning and Truth&quot; from 1940, to make a similar point;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/BertrandRussell-AnInquaryIntoMeaningAndTruth | isbn= | author=Bertrand Russell | title=An Inquiry into Meaning and Truth | location=New York | publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company | year=1940 }} Here: [https://archive.org/details/BertrandRussell-AnInquaryIntoMeaningAndTruth/page/n179 p.166]&lt;/ref&gt; [[W.V. Quine]] took issue with him on the grounds that for a sentence to be false is nothing more than for it not to be true; and since quadruplicity doesn't drink ''anything'', the sentence is simply false, not meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url= | isbn= | author=Willard Van Orman Quine | editor= | title=Theories and Things | location=Cambridge | publisher=Harvard Univiversity Press | year=1981 }} Here: Ch.12 &quot;On the Individuation of Attributes&quot;, p.110&lt;/ref&gt;

In a sketch about linguistics, British comedy duo [[Fry and Laurie]] used the nonsensical sentence &quot;Hold the newsreader's nose squarely, waiter, or friendly milk will countermand my trousers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160906-the-people-who-study-the-meaning-of-nonsense&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach is to create a syntactically-correct, easily parsable sentence using nonsense words; a famous such example is &quot;[[Gostak|The gostak distims the doshes]]&quot;. [[Lewis Carroll]]'s [[Jabberwocky]] is also famous for using this technique, although in this case for literary purposes; similar sentences used in neuroscience experiments are called [[Jabberwocky sentence]]s. In Russian schools of linguistics, the ''[[glokaya kuzdra]]'' example has similar characteristics.

Other arguably &quot;meaningless&quot; utterances are ones that make sense, are grammatical, but have no reference to the present state of the world, such as Russell's ''The present [[King of France]] is bald'' from &quot;[[On Denoting]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Russell  | first = Bertrand  | author-link = Bertrand Russell   | title = On Denoting  | journal = Mind  | volume = 14  | issue = 56  | pages = 479–493  | publisher = Oxford University Press on behalf of the Mind Association | location = Oxford  | date = October 1905  | doi = 10.1093/mind/XIV.4.479 | jstor = 2248381 | issn = 0026-4423| url = https://zenodo.org/record/1431813 }} Here: p.483&lt;/ref&gt; (also see [[definite description]]).

The ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode &quot;[[Darmok]]&quot; features a race that communicates entirely by referencing folklore and stories. While the vessel's [[universal translator]] correctly translates the characters and places from these stories, it fails to decipher the intended meaning, leaving Captain Picard unable to understand the alien.

{{About|philosophical issues raised by the nature of mathematics|influences of mathematical studies and methods on philosophy|Mathematical philosophy (disambiguation){{!}}Mathematical philosophy}}

The '''philosophy of mathematics''' is the [[Discipline (academia)|branch]] of [[philosophy]] that studies the assumptions, foundations, and implications of [[mathematics]]. It aims to understand the nature and [[methodology|methods]] of mathematics, and find out the place of mathematics in people's lives. The logical and structural nature of mathematics itself makes this study both broad and unique among its philosophical counterparts.

==History==
The origin of mathematics is subject to arguments and disagreements. Whether the birth of mathematics was a random happening or induced by necessity during the development of other subjects, like physics, is still a matter of prolific debates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is mathematics discovered or invented?|url=http://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/education/research/centres/stem/publications/pmej/pome12/article2.htm|website=University of Exeter|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Math: Discovered, Invented, or Both?|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs/physics/2015/04/great-math-mystery/|website=pbs.org|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many thinkers have contributed their ideas concerning the nature of mathematics. Today, some{{Who|date=July 2012}} philosophers of mathematics aim to give accounts of this form of inquiry and its products as they stand, while others emphasize a role for themselves that goes beyond simple interpretation to critical analysis. There are traditions of mathematical philosophy in both [[History of Western philosophy|Western philosophy]] and [[Eastern philosophy]]. Western philosophies of mathematics go as far back as [[Pythagoras]], who described the theory &quot;everything is mathematics&quot; ([[mathematicism]]), [[Plato]], who paraphrased Pythagoras, and studied the [[ontology|ontological status]] of mathematical objects, and [[Aristotle]], who studied [[logic]] and issues related to [[infinity]] (actual versus potential).

[[Greek philosophy]] on mathematics was strongly influenced by their study of [[geometry]]. For example, at one time, the Greeks held the opinion that 1 (one) was not a [[number]], but rather a unit of arbitrary length. A number was defined as a multitude. Therefore, 3, for example, represented a certain multitude of units, and was thus not &quot;truly&quot; a number. At another point, a similar argument was made that 2 was not a number but a fundamental notion of a pair. These views come from the heavily geometric straight-edge-and-compass viewpoint of the Greeks: just as lines drawn in a geometric problem are measured in proportion to the first arbitrarily drawn line, so too are the numbers on a number line measured in proportion to the arbitrary first &quot;number&quot; or &quot;one&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

These earlier Greek ideas of numbers were later upended by the discovery of the [[irrational number|irrationality]] of the square root of two. [[Hippasus]], a disciple of [[Pythagoras]], showed that the diagonal of a unit square was incommensurable with its (unit-length) edge: in other words he proved there was no existing (rational) number that accurately depicts the proportion of the diagonal of the unit square to its edge. This caused a significant re-evaluation of Greek philosophy of mathematics. According to legend, fellow Pythagoreans were so traumatized by this discovery that they murdered Hippasus to stop him from spreading his heretical idea. [[Simon Stevin]] was one of the first in Europe to challenge Greek ideas in the 16th&amp;nbsp;century. Beginning with [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], the focus shifted strongly to the relationship between mathematics and logic. This perspective dominated the philosophy of mathematics through the time of [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]] and of [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], but was brought into question by developments in the late 19th and early 20th&amp;nbsp;centuries.

===Contemporary philosophy===
A perennial issue in the philosophy of mathematics concerns the relationship between logic and mathematics at their joint foundations. While 20th-century philosophers continued to ask the questions mentioned at  the outset of this article, the philosophy of mathematics in the 20th century was characterized by a predominant interest in [[formal logic]], [[set theory]] (both [[naive set theory]] and [[axiomatic set theory]]), and foundational issues.

It is a profound puzzle that on the one hand mathematical truths seem to have a compelling inevitability, but on the other hand the source of their &quot;truthfulness&quot; remains elusive. Investigations into this issue are known as the [[foundations of mathematics]] program.

At the start of the 20th century, philosophers of mathematics were already beginning to divide into various schools of thought about all these questions, broadly distinguished by their pictures of mathematical [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]]. Three schools, [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]], [[intuitionism]], and [[logicism]], emerged at this time, partly in response to the increasingly widespread worry that mathematics as it stood, and [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] in particular, did not live up to the standards of [[certainty]] and [[rigor]] that had been taken for granted. Each school addressed the issues that came to the fore at that time, either attempting to resolve them or claiming that mathematics is not entitled to its status as our most trusted knowledge.

Surprising and counter-intuitive developments in formal logic and set theory early in the 20th&amp;nbsp;century led to new questions concerning what was traditionally called the ''foundations of mathematics''. As the century unfolded, the initial focus of concern expanded to an open exploration of the fundamental axioms of mathematics, the axiomatic approach having been taken for granted since the time of [[Euclid]] around 300&amp;nbsp;BCE as the natural basis for mathematics. Notions of [[axiom]], [[proposition]] and [[mathematical proof|proof]], as well as the notion of a proposition being true of a mathematical object (see [[Assignment (mathematical logic)|Assignment]]), were formalized, allowing them to be treated mathematically. The [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|Zermelo–Fraenkel]] axioms for set theory were formulated which provided a conceptual framework in which much mathematical discourse would be interpreted. In mathematics, as in physics, new and unexpected ideas had arisen and significant changes were coming. With [[Gödel numbering]], propositions could be interpreted as referring to themselves or other propositions, enabling inquiry into the [[consistency proof|consistency]] of mathematical theories. This reflective critique in which the theory under review &quot;becomes itself the object of a mathematical study&quot; led [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] to call such study ''[[metamathematics]]'' or ''[[proof theory]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kleene 1971&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the middle of the century, a new mathematical theory was created by [[Samuel Eilenberg]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane]], known as [[category theory]], and it became a new contender for the natural language of mathematical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Saunders Mac Lane|Mac Lane, Saunders]] (1998), ''[[Categories for the Working Mathematician]]'', 2nd edition, Springer-Verlag, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; As the 20th&amp;nbsp;century progressed, however, philosophical opinions diverged as to just how well-founded were the questions about foundations that were raised at the century's beginning. [[Hilary Putnam]] summed up one common view of the situation in the last third of the century by saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When philosophy discovers something wrong with science, sometimes science has to be changed—[[Russell's paradox]] comes to mind, as does [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]]'s attack on the actual [[infinitesimal]]—but more often it is philosophy that has to be changed. I do not think that the difficulties that philosophy finds with classical mathematics today are genuine difficulties; and I think that the philosophical interpretations of mathematics that we are being offered on every hand are wrong, and that &quot;philosophical interpretation&quot; is just what mathematics doesn't need.&lt;ref&gt;*Putnam, Hilary (1967), &quot;Mathematics Without Foundations&quot;, ''Journal of Philosophy'' 64/1, 5-22. Reprinted, pp.&amp;nbsp;168–184 in W.D. Hart (ed., 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|169–170}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Philosophy of mathematics today proceeds along several different lines of inquiry, by philosophers of mathematics, logicians, and mathematicians, and there are many schools of thought on the subject. The schools are addressed separately in the next section, and their assumptions explained.

==Major themes==
===Mathematical realism&lt;!--'Mathematical realism' redirects here--&gt;===
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2007}}
'''Mathematical realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, like [[Metaphysical realism|realism]] in general, holds that mathematical entities exist independently of the human [[mind]]. Thus humans do not invent mathematics, but rather discover it, and any other intelligent beings in the universe would presumably do the same. In this point of view, there is really one sort of mathematics that can be discovered; [[triangle]]s, for example, are real entities, not the creations of the human mind.

Many working mathematicians have been mathematical realists; they see themselves as discoverers of naturally occurring objects. Examples include [[Paul Erdős]] and [[Kurt Gödel]]. Gödel believed in an objective mathematical reality that could be perceived in a manner analogous to sense perception. Certain principles (e.g., for any two objects, there is a collection of objects consisting of precisely those two objects) could be directly seen to be true, but the [[continuum hypothesis]] conjecture might prove undecidable just on the basis of such principles. Gödel suggested that quasi-empirical methodology could be used to provide sufficient evidence to be able to reasonably assume such a conjecture.

Within realism, there are distinctions depending on what sort of existence one takes mathematical entities to have, and how we know about them. Major forms of mathematical realism include [[Philosophy of mathematics#Platonism|Platonism]].

===Mathematical anti-realism&lt;!--'Mathematical anti-realism' redirects here--&gt;===
{{also|Post rem structuralism}}
'''Mathematical anti-realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; generally holds that mathematical statements have truth-values, but that they do not do so by [[correspondence theory of truth|corresponding]] to a special realm of immaterial or non-empirical entities. Major forms of mathematical anti-realism include [[Philosophy of mathematics#Formalism|formalism]] and [[Philosophy of mathematics#Fictionalism|fictionalism]].

==Contemporary schools of thought==
===Artistic===
The view that claims that [[mathematics]] is the [[aesthetic]] combination of assumptions, and then also claims that mathematics is an [[art]], a famous [[mathematician]] who claims that is the British [[G. H. Hardy]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1486751-a-mathematician-s-apology&lt;/ref&gt; and also metaphorically the French [[Henri Poincaré]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/henri_poincare_208086&lt;/ref&gt;, for Hardy, in his book, ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]'', the definition of mathematics was more like the aesthetic combination of concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=S |first1=F. |title=A Mathematician's Apology |journal=Nature |date=January 1941 |volume=147 |issue=3714 |pages=3–5 |doi=10.1038/147003a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Platonism&lt;!--'Mathematical Platonism', 'Full-blooded Platonism', 'Set-theoretic realism', 'set-theoretic Platonism', 'naturalized Platonism', and 'Platonized naturalism' redirect here--&gt;===
{{main|Platonism}}
{{also|Modern Platonism}}
'''Mathematical Platonism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is the form of realism that suggests that mathematical entities are abstract, have no spatiotemporal or causal properties, and are eternal and unchanging. This is often claimed to be the view most people have of numbers. The term ''Platonism'' is used because such a view is seen to parallel [[Plato]]'s [[Theory of Forms]] and a &quot;World of Ideas&quot; (Greek: ''eidos'' (εἶδος)) described in Plato's [[allegory of the cave]]: the everyday world can only imperfectly approximate an unchanging, ultimate reality. Both Plato's cave and Platonism have meaningful, not just superficial connections, because Plato's ideas were preceded and probably influenced by the hugely popular ''[[Pythagoreans]]'' of ancient Greece, who believed that the world was, quite literally, generated by [[number]]s.

A major question considered in mathematical Platonism is: Precisely where and how do the mathematical entities exist, and how do we know about them? Is there a world, completely separate from our physical one, that is occupied by the mathematical entities? How can we gain access to this separate world and discover truths about the entities? One proposed answer is the [[Ultimate Ensemble]], a theory that postulates that all structures that exist mathematically also exist physically in their own universe.

[[Kurt Gödel]]'s Platonism&lt;ref name=SEP-P&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism/ Platonism in Metaphysics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; postulates a special kind of mathematical intuition that lets us perceive mathematical objects directly. (This view bears resemblances to many things [[Husserl]] said about mathematics, and supports [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s idea that mathematics is [[Analytic-synthetic distinction#Conceptual containment|synthetic]] ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''.) [[Philip J. Davis|Davis]] and [[Reuben Hersh|Hersh]] have suggested in their 1999 book ''The Mathematical Experience'' that most mathematicians act as though they are Platonists, even though, if pressed to defend the position carefully, they may retreat to [[Philosophy of mathematics#Formalism|formalism]].

'''Full-blooded Platonism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is a modern variation of Platonism, which is in reaction to the fact that different sets of mathematical entities can be proven to exist depending on the axioms and inference rules employed (for instance, the law of the [[excluded middle]], and the [[axiom of choice]]). It holds that all mathematical entities exist. They may be provable, even if they cannot all be derived from a single consistent set of axioms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism-mathematics/ &quot;Platonism in the Philosophy of Mathematics&quot;, (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Set-theoretic realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (also '''set-theoretic Platonism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;[[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]] (ed.), ''Companion Encyclopedia of the History and Philosophy of the Mathematical Sciences'', Routledge, 2002, p. 681.&lt;/ref&gt; a position defended by [[Penelope Maddy]], is the view that [[set theory]] is about a single universe of sets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism-mathematics/ Naturalism in the Philosophy of Mathematics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; This position (which is also known as '''naturalized Platonism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; because it is a [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalized]] version of mathematical Platonism) has been criticized by Mark Balaguer on the basis of [[Paul Benacerraf]]'s [[Benacerraf's epistemological problem|epistemological problem]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Balaguer, &quot;Against (Maddian) naturalized Platonism&quot;, ''Philosophia Mathematica'' 2 (1994), 97–108.&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar view, termed '''Platonized naturalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, was later defended by the [[Stanford–Edmonton School]]: according to this view, a more traditional kind of Platonism is consistent with [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]; the more traditional kind of Platonism they defend is distinguished by general principles that assert the existence of [[Abstract object theory|abstract object]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Linsky, B., and [[Edward N. Zalta|Zalta, E.]], 1995, &quot;Naturalized Platonism vs. Platonized Naturalism&quot;, ''The Journal of Philosophy'', '''92'''(10): 525–555.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematicism===
{{main|Mathematicism}}
[[Max Tegmark]]'s [[mathematical universe hypothesis]] (or [[mathematicism]]) goes further than Platonism in asserting that not only do all mathematical objects exist, but nothing else does. Tegmark's sole postulate is: ''All structures that exist mathematically also exist physically''. That is, in the sense that &quot;in those [worlds] complex enough to contain self-aware substructures [they] will subjectively perceive themselves as existing in a physically 'real' world&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tegmark2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tegmark |first=Max |date=February 2008 |title=The Mathematical Universe |journal=Foundations of Physics |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=101–150 |doi=10.1007/s10701-007-9186-9 |arxiv=0704.0646 |bibcode=2008FoPh...38..101T}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tegmark (1998), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logicism===
{{main|Logicism}}
[[Logicism]] is the thesis that mathematics is reducible to logic, and hence nothing but a part of logic.&lt;ref name=Carnap&gt;[[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap, Rudolf]] (1931), &quot;Die logizistische Grundlegung der Mathematik&quot;, ''Erkenntnis'' 2, 91-121. Republished, &quot;The Logicist Foundations of Mathematics&quot;, E. Putnam and G.J. Massey (trans.), in Benacerraf and Putnam (1964). Reprinted, pp.&amp;nbsp;41–52 in Benacerraf and Putnam (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|41}} Logicists hold that mathematics can be known ''a priori'', but suggest that our knowledge of mathematics is just part of our knowledge of logic in general, and is thus [[analytic proposition|analytic]], not requiring any special faculty of mathematical intuition. In this view, [[logic]] is the proper foundation of mathematics, and all mathematical statements are necessary [[logical truth]]s.

[[Rudolf Carnap]] (1931) presents the logicist thesis in two parts:&lt;ref name=Carnap/&gt;
#The ''concepts'' of mathematics can be derived from logical concepts through explicit definitions.
#The ''theorems'' of mathematics can be derived from logical axioms through purely logical deduction.

Gottlob Frege was the founder of logicism. In his seminal ''Die Grundgesetze der Arithmetik'' (''Basic Laws of Arithmetic'') he built up [[arithmetic]] from a system of logic with a general principle of comprehension, which he called &quot;Basic Law V&quot; (for concepts ''F'' and ''G'', the extension of ''F'' equals the extension of ''G'' if and only if for all objects ''a'', ''Fa'' equals ''Ga''), a principle that he took to be acceptable as part of logic.

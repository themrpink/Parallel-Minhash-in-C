===Caldera===

The tectonic causes of the Long Valley volcanism are still largely unexplained and are therefore a matter of much ongoing research.  Long Valley is not above a [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]], such as those which fuel the [[Yellowstone Caldera]] or the volcanoes of [[Hawaii]]; nor is it the result of [[subduction]] such as that which produces the volcanism of the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]].

The known volcanic history of the Long Valley Caldera area started a few million years ago when magma began to collect several miles below the surface. Volcanic activity became concentrated in the vicinity of the present site of Long Valley Caldera 3.1 to 2.5 million years ago with eruptions of [[rhyodacite]] followed by high-silica rhyolite from 2.1 to 0.8 million years ago. After some time, a cluster of mostly [[rhyolite|rhyolitic]] volcanoes formed in the area. All told, about {{convert|1500|sqmi}} were covered by lava.

All but one of these volcanoes, 1–2 million year old [[Glass Mountain (California)|Glass Mountain]] (made of [[obsidian]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Geology Underfoot in Death Valley and Owens Valley | last=Sharp | first=Robert P. | author2=Allen F. Glazner | publisher=Mountain Press Publishing Company | location=Missoula, Montana | year=1997 | isbn=978-0-87842-362-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|264}} were destroyed by the major ([[volcanic explosivity index]] (VEI) 7) eruption of the area 760,000 years ago, which released {{convert|600|km3}} of material from vents just inside the margin of the caldera.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holohan|first=Eoghan P.|last2=Troll|first2=Valentin R.|last3=Vries|first3=Benjamin van Wyk de|last4=Walsh|first4=John J.|last5=Walter|first5=Thomas R.|date=2008-04-01|title=Unzipping Long Valley: An explanation for vent migration patterns during an elliptical ring fracture eruption|url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/36/4/323/103861/Unzipping-Long-Valley-An-explanation-for-vent|journal=Geology|language=en|volume=36|issue=4|pages=323–326|doi=10.1130/G24329A.1|issn=0091-7613}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The [[1980 Mount St. Helens eruption]] was a VEI-5 eruption releasing {{convert|1.2|km3}}.) About half of this material was ejected in a series of [[pyroclastic flow]]s of a very hot ({{convert|1500|F}}) mixture of noxious gas, [[pumice]], and [[volcanic ash]] that covered the surrounding area hundreds of feet deep. One lobe of this material moved south into [[Owens Valley]], past present-day [[Big Pine, California]]. Another lobe moved west over the crest of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] and into the drainage of the [[San Joaquin River]]. The rest of the pyroclastic material, along with {{convert|300|km3}} of other matter, was blown as far as {{convert|25|mi}} into the air where winds distributed it as far away as eastern [[Nebraska]] and [[Kansas]].

The eruption initially produced a caldera {{cvt|2|-|3|km}} deep. However, much of the ejecta went straight up, fell down, and filled the initial caldera about two-thirds full.

=== Eruptions ===
[[File:Long Valley Caldera cross section.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Cross-section through Long Valley]]

Subsequent eruptions from the Long Valley magma chamber were confined within the caldera with extrusions of relatively hot (crystal-free) rhyolite 700,000 to 600,000 years ago as the caldera floor was upwarped to form the resurgent dome followed by extrusions of cooler, crystal-rich moat rhyolite at 200,000-year intervals (500,000, 300,000, and 100,000 years ago) in clockwise succession around the dome.&lt;ref name=volcanoworld/&gt; The declining volcanic activity and increasingly crystalline lava extruded over the last 650,000 years, as well as other trends, suggest that the magma reservoir under the caldera has now largely crystallized and is unlikely to produce large-scale eruptions in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hildreth&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Volcanological perspectives on Long Valley, Mammoth Mountain, and Mono Craters: several contiguous but discrete systems|journal=[[Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research]] | last=Hildreth | first=Wes | date=25 September 2004 | volume=136 | issue=3–4 | doi=10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2004.05.019 | bibcode=2004JVGR..136..169H | pages=169–198 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Long Valley volcano is unusual in that it has produced eruptions of both [[Lava#Mafic lava|basaltic]] and [[Lava#Felsic lava|silicic]] lava in the same geological place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Johnson | first=B. F. | title=Supervolcano's different lavas hint at its decline | journal=Earth Magazine | date=June 2010 | pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water from the [[Owens River]] filled the caldera to a depth of {{convert|300|m|0}} as of 600,000 years ago. At that time, the lake surface was at an elevation near {{convert|7500|ft|m|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Geologic guidebook to the Long Valley—Mono Craters region of eastern California |first=S. R. |last= Lipshie |year=1976 |publisher= University of California |page= 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lake drained sometime in the last 100,000 years after it overtopped the southern rim of the caldera, eroded the sill, and created the [[Owens River Gorge]]. A human-made dam in the gorge has created [[Lake Crowley]], a partial restoration of the original lake. Since the great eruption, many [[hot spring]]s developed in the area, and the resurgent dome has uplifted.

During the last [[ice age]], glaciers filled the canyons leading to Long Valley, but the valley floor was clear of ice. Excellent examples of [[terminal moraine]]s can be seen at Long Valley. [[Laurel Creek]], [[Convict Creek]], and [[McGee Creek, California|McGee Creek]] each have prominent moraines.

===Recent activity===
In May 1980, a strong earthquake swarm that included four [[Richter magnitude]] 6 earthquakes struck the southern margin of the Long Valley Caldera. It was associated with a 10-inch (250&amp;nbsp;mm) dome-shaped uplift of the caldera floor.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgs&quot;&gt;{{USGS | url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/dds/dds-81/#Ataglance |title= Long Valley Caldera at a Glance}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USGS |url= http://pubs.usgs.gov/dds/dds-81/Intro/Bibliography/of00-221.pdf |title= Bibliography of Literature Pertaining to Long Valley Caldera and Associated Volcanic Fields |author= John W. Ewert, Christopher J. Harpel, Suzanna K. Brooks}}&lt;/ref&gt; These events marked the onset of the latest period of caldera unrest that is ongoing.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgs&quot;/&gt; This ongoing unrest includes recurring earthquake swarms and continued dome-shaped uplift of the central section of the caldera accompanied by changes in thermal springs and gas emissions.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgs&quot;/&gt; After the quake, another road was created as an escape route. Its name at first was proposed as the &quot;Mammoth Escape Route&quot; but was changed to the Mammoth Scenic Loop after Mammoth area businesses and land owners complained.

In 1982, the [[United States Geological Survey]] under the [[Volcano Hazards Program]] began an intensive effort to monitor and study geologic unrest in Long Valley Caldera.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgs&quot;/&gt; The goal is to provide residents and civil authorities with reliable information on the nature of the potential hazards posed by this unrest and timely warning of an impending volcanic eruption, should it develop.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgs&quot;/&gt; Most, perhaps all, volcanic eruptions are preceded and accompanied by geophysical and geochemical changes in the volcanic system.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgs&quot;/&gt; Common precursory indicators of volcanic activity include increased seismicity, ground deformation, and variations in the nature and rate of gas emissions.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgs&quot;/&gt;

===Hydrothermal system===
[[File:Hot Creek Fish Hatchery with Resurgent Dome in background-1200px.jpg|left|thumb|Hot Creek Fish Hatchery at base of Resurgent Dome]]

The Long Valley Caldera hosts an active hydrothermal system that includes hot springs, [[fumarole]]s (steam vents), and mineral deposits. Hot springs exist primarily in the eastern half of the [[caldera]] where land-surface elevations are relatively low; fumaroles exist primarily in the western half where elevations are higher. Mineral deposits from thermal activity are found on an uplifted area called the resurgent dome, at [[Little Hot Creek]] springs, [[Hot Creek Gorge]], and other locations in the south and east [[moat]]s of the caldera.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgshydro&quot;&gt;{{USGS |url= http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/lvo/activity/monitoring/hydrology/ |title= Hydrologic Studies in Long Valley Caldera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hot springs discharge primarily in Hot Creek Gorge, along [[Little Hot Creek]], and in the [[Alkali Lakes]] area. The largest springs are in Hot Creek Gorge where about {{convert|250|L|gal|abbr=on}} per second of thermal water discharge and account for about 80% of the total thermal water discharge in the caldera. At the other extreme are springs at [[Hot Creek Fish Hatchery]] which contain a small component (2–5%) of thermal water that raises water temperatures about {{convert|5|C-change|F-change|abbr=on}} higher than background temperatures. Use of the warm spring water in the [[hatchery]] has increased fish production because [[trout]] growth rates are faster in the warm water than in ambient stream temperatures in Long Valley.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgshydro&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Mammoth Hot Creek Panorama.jpg|thumb|Hot Creek in the summer]]

In hydrothermal systems the circulation of [[groundwater]] is driven by a combination of [[topography]] and [[heat]] sources. In Long Valley Caldera, the system is recharged primarily from [[snow]]-melt in the highlands around the western and southern rims of the caldera. The water from snow-melt and rainfall infiltrates to depths of a few kilometers (miles) where it is heated to at least {{cvt|220|C|F}} by hot rock near geologically young intrusions. Upflow occurs in the west moat where the heated water with lower density rises along steeply inclined fractures to depths of {{cvt|1|-|2|km|mi}}. This hydrothermal fluid flows laterally, down the hydraulic gradient, from the west to the southeast around the resurgent dome and then eastward to discharge points along Hot Creek and around [[Crowley Lake]]. Reservoir temperatures in the volcanic fill decline from {{cvt|220|C|F}} near the Inyo Craters to {{cvt|50|C|F}} near Crowley Lake due to a combination of heat loss and mixing with cold water.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgshydro&quot;/&gt;

Hot Creek has been a popular swimming hole for decades. Over a dozen people have died in Hot Creek since the late 1960s, but most of these deaths happened to people who ignored the numerous warning signs and attempted to use the hydrothermal pools as [[hot tub]]s (like the stream portion of the creek, these pools alternate in temperature but the eruptions in the pools are of super-heated water in already very hot water). Recent geothermal instability has led to its temporary closure for swimming. Officials are unsure of when (if ever) Hot Creek will officially reopen for swimming.

Hydrothermal activity has altered many rocks in the caldera, transforming them into [[travertine]] and [[clay]]. At the [[Huntley clay mine]] white chalky clay called [[kaolinite]] is mined; the kaolinite is exposed on the resurgent dome and appears as a brilliant white band.

==Tourism and hiking==
{{For|the history and ecology of the caldera|Owens Valley}}

[[File:Hilltop-hot-spring-2015.jpg|thumb|Hilltop Hot Spring]]
The largest tourist attraction in the caldera is the [[Mammoth Mountain Ski Area]]: the area offers [[skiing]] and [[snowboarding]] in the winter, and [[mountain biking]] in the summer.  The [[Hot Creek (Mono County, California)|Hot Creek]] tourist attraction was closed to swimming in 2006 due to increased geothermal activity.

[[Hiking]] and [[off-road vehicle]] driving is available throughout the caldera, and in the glacial valleys of the [[Sherwin Range]], immediately to the south of the caldera. Hikers can hike to several lakes in these glacial valleys, including [[Valentine Lake]], [[Convict Lake]], [[Lake Dorothy (California)|Lake Dorothy]], and [[Laurel Lakes]].  [[Crowley Lake]], at the south end of the caldera, is noted for its fishing.

The nearest hotel accommodations to the caldera are in [[Mammoth Lakes, California]]. There are also campgrounds scattered throughout the caldera, and in the mountains near the edge of the caldera.

==Fatalities==

In April 2006, three members of the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area ski patrol died while on duty. All three died from suffocation by [[carbon dioxide]] when they fell into a [[fumarole]] on the slopes of the mountain while attempting to fence it off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Covarrubias |first= Amanda |author2=Doug Smith |title= 3 Die in Mammoth Ski Patrol Accident |newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2006-06-07 |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2006/apr/07/local/me-mammoth7 |accessdate= 2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vesuvius has erupted many times since, and is the only volcano on the European mainland to have erupted within the last hundred years. Today, it is regarded as one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world because of the population of 3,000,000 people living near enough to be affected by an eruption, with 600,000 in the danger zone, making it the most densely populated volcanic region in the world, as well as its tendency towards violent, explosive eruptions of the [[Plinian eruption|Plinian]] type.&lt;ref name=mcguire2003&gt;{{cite news |first=Bill |last=McGuire |title=In the shadow of the volcano |date=16 October 2003 |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/oct/16/research.highereducation2 |accessdate=8 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
Vesuvius has a long historic and literary tradition. It was considered a divinity of the [[Genius (mythology)|Genius]] type at the time of the eruption of AD 79: it appears under the inscribed name Vesuvius as a serpent in the decorative [[fresco]]s of many ''{{lang|la|lararia}}'', or household shrines, surviving from [[Pompeii]]. An inscription from [[Capua]]&lt;ref&gt;CIL x.1, 3806.&lt;/ref&gt; to {{lang|la|IOVI VESVVIO}} indicates that he was worshipped as a power of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]; that is, ''Jupiter Vesuvius''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waldstein|1908|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romans regarded Mount Vesuvius to be devoted to [[Hercules]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=The Illustrated History of Natural Disasters |last1=Kozák |first1=Jan |last2=Cermák |title=The Illustrated History of Natural Disasters |first2=Vladimir |year=2010 |pages=45–54 |isbn=978-90-481-3325-3|doi=10.1007/978-90-481-3325-3_3 |chapter=Vesuvius-Somma Volcano, Bay of Naples, Italy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] relates a tradition that Hercules, in the performance of his labors, passed through the country of nearby [[Cumae]] on his way to [[Sicily]] and found there a place called &quot;the Phlegraean Plain&quot; ([[Phlegraean Fields|''Φλεγραῖον πεδίον'']], &quot;plain of fire&quot;), &quot;from a hill which anciently vomited out fire ... now called Vesuvius.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Book IV, Chapter 21.&lt;/ref&gt; It was inhabited by bandits, &quot;the sons of the Earth,&quot; who were giants. With the assistance of the gods he pacified the region and went on. The facts behind the tradition, if any, remain unknown, as does whether {{lang|la|[[Herculaneum]]}} was named after it. An [[epigram]] by the poet [[Martial]] in 88 AD suggests that both [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], patroness of Pompeii, and Hercules were worshipped in the region devastated by the eruption of 79.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waldstein|1908|p=108}} re Epigram IV line 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''{{lang|la|Vesuvius}}'' was a name of the volcano in frequent use by the authors of the late [[Roman Republic]] and the early [[Roman Empire]]. Its [[synonym|collateral forms]] were ''{{lang|la|Vesaevus}}'', ''{{lang|la|Vesevus}}'', ''{{lang|la|Vesbius}}'' and ''{{lang|la|Vesvius}}''.&lt;ref name=Lewis&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Vesuvius |first=Charlton T. |last=Lewis |first2=Charles |last2=Short |location=Medford, MA |publisher=The Perseus Project, Tufts University |year=2010 |origyear=1879 |encyclopedia=A Latin Dictionary |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=Vesuvius&amp;highlight=vesuvius }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers in ancient Greek used {{lang|grc|Οὐεσούιον}} or {{lang|grc|Οὐεσούιος}}. Many scholars since then have offered an [[etymology]]. As peoples of varying ethnicity and language occupied [[Campania]] in the [[Roman Iron Age]], the etymology depends to a large degree on the presumption of what language was spoken there at the time. Naples was settled by Greeks, as the name ''{{lang|grc-Latn|Nea-polis}}'', &quot;New City&quot;, testifies. The [[Oscans]], an [[Italic languages|Italic]] people, lived in the countryside. The [[Latin language|Latins]] also competed for the occupation of Campania. [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] settlements were in the vicinity. Other peoples of unknown provenance are said to have been there at some time by various ancient authors.

Some theories about its origin are:
* From Greek {{lang|grc|οὔ}} = &quot;not&quot; prefixed to a root from or related to the Greek word {{lang|grc|σβέννυμι}} = &quot;I quench&quot;, in the sense of &quot;unquenchable&quot;.&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vesuvius |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.48517 |first=John |last=Phillips|pages=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.48517/page/n103 7]–9 |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1869 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* From Greek {{lang|grc|ἕω}} = &quot;I hurl&quot; and {{lang|grc|βίη}} &quot;violence&quot;, &quot;hurling violence&quot;, *vesbia, taking advantage of the collateral form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Local etymology, a derivative dictionary of geographical names |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_I2BulY4WvsYC |first=Richard Stephen |last=Charnock |page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_I2BulY4WvsYC/page/n249 289] |location=London |publisher=Houlston and Wright |year=1859 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vesuvius is a &quot;humpbacked&quot; peak, consisting of a large [[volcanic cone|cone]] (''Gran Cono'') partially encircled by the steep rim of a summit [[caldera]] caused by the collapse of an earlier (and originally much higher) structure called [[Mount Somma]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OS storia&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ov.ingv.it/inglese/vesuvio/storia/storia.htm | title = Summary of the eruptive history of Mt.

For this reason, the volcano is also called Somma-Vesuvius or Somma-Vesuvio.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

The caldera started forming during an eruption around 17,000-18,000 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705060119/http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vwdocs/volc_images/img_vesuvius.html|url=http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vwdocs/volc_images/img_vesuvius.html|archivedate=5 July 2008|title=Vesuvius, Italy|work=Volcano World}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scenta&quot;&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826063343/http://www.scenta.co.uk/nature/volcanoes/volcanoes_worldwide.cfm|url=http://www.scenta.co.uk/nature/volcanoes/volcanoes_worldwide.cfm|title=The world's top volcanoes|publisher=Scenta|archivedate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OS Pomici di Base&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ov.ingv.it/inglese/vesuvio/storia/pomici_base.htm | title = The Pomici Di Base Eruption | work = Osservatorio Vesuviano, Italian National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology | accessdate= 8 December 2006 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061022134001/http://www.ov.ingv.it/inglese/vesuvio/storia/pomici_base.htm &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; | archivedate = 22 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was enlarged by later [[Types of volcanic eruptions#Eruption mechanisms|paroxysmal]] eruptions,&lt;ref name=&quot;global volcanism&quot;&gt;{{cite gvp | vn=211020 | title = Vesuvius | accessdate= 8 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ending in the one of AD 79. This structure has given its name to the term &quot;[[somma volcano]]&quot;, which describes any volcano with a summit caldera surrounding a newer cone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.volcanolive.com/somma.html | title = Definition of somma volcano |work= Volcano Live | accessdate= 11 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The height of the main cone has been constantly changed by eruptions but was {{convert|1281|m|ft|abbr=on}} in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scenta&quot; /&gt; Monte Somma is {{convert|1132|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, separated from the main cone by the valley of Atrio di Cavallo, which is {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} long. The slopes of the volcano are scarred by lava flows, while the rest are heavily vegetated, with scrub and forests at higher altitudes and [[vineyard]]s lower down. Vesuvius is still regarded as an active volcano, although its current activity produces little more than sulfur-rich steam from vents at the bottom and walls of the crater. Vesuvius is a stratovolcano at the [[convergent boundary]] where the [[African Plate]] is being [[subduction|subducted]] beneath the [[Eurasian Plate]]. Layers of [[lava]], [[volcanic ash|ash]], [[scoria]] and [[pumice]] make up the volcanic peak. Their mineralogy is variable, but generally [[silica]]-undersaturated and rich in [[potassium]], with [[phonolite]] produced in the more explosive eruptions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.volcanotrek.com/vesuvius_volcano.htm |title=Vesuvius |work=volcanotrek.com |accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. the eruption in 1631 displaying a complete stratigraphic and petrographic description: phonolite was firstly erupted, followed by a [[tephritic phonolite]] and finally a phonolitic [[tephrite]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stoppa|first=Francesco|last2=Principe|first2=Claudia|last3=Schiazza|first3=Mariangela|last4=Liu|first4=Yu|last5=Giosa|first5=Paola|last6=Crocetti|first6=Sergio|date=15 March 2017|title=Magma evolution inside the 1631 Vesuvius magma chamber and eruption triggering|journal=Open Geosciences|volume=9|issue=1|pages=24–52|doi=10.1515/geo-2017-0003|issn=2391-5447|bibcode=2017OGeo....9....3S|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
Vesuvius was formed as a result of the collision of two [[tectonic plate]]s, the [[African Plate|African]] and the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]]. The former was [[Subduction|subducted]] beneath the latter, deeper into the earth. As the water-saturated sediments of the oceanic African plate were pushed to hotter depths inside the planet, the water boiled off and lowered the melting point of the [[upper mantle (Earth)|upper mantle]] enough to partially melt the rocks. Because magma is less dense than the solid rock around it, it was pushed upward. Finding a weak spot at the Earth's surface, it broke through, thus forming the volcano.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

The volcano is one of several which form the [[Campanian volcanic arc]]. Others include [[Campi Flegrei]], a large [[caldera]] a few kilometers to the north west, [[Mount Epomeo]], {{convert|20|km}} to the west on the island of [[Ischia]], and several undersea volcanoes to the south. The arc forms the southern end of a larger chain of volcanoes produced by the [[subduction]] process described above, which extends northwest along the length of Italy as far as [[Monte Amiata]] in Southern [[Tuscany]]. Vesuvius is the only one to have erupted within recent history, although some of the others have erupted within the last few hundred years. Many are either extinct or have not erupted for tens of thousands of years.

[[File:Procession des reliques de Saint Janvier en 1822.jpg|thumb|Procession of [[Januarius|Saint Januarius]] during an eruption of Vesuvius in 1822]]
Mount Vesuvius has erupted many times. The eruption in AD 79 was preceded by numerous others in prehistory, including at least three significantly larger ones, including the [[Avellino eruption]] around 1800 BC which engulfed several Bronze Age settlements. Since AD 79, the volcano has also erupted repeatedly, in 172, 203, 222, possibly in 303, 379, 472, 512, 536, 685, 787, around 860, around 900, 968, 991, 999, 1006, 1037, 1049, around 1073, 1139, 1150, and there may have been eruptions in 1270, 1347, and 1500.&lt;ref name = &quot;global volcanism&quot;/&gt;
The volcano erupted again in 1631, six times in the 18th century (including 1779 and 1794), eight times in the 19th century (notably in 1872), and in 1906, 1929 and 1944. There have been no eruptions since 1944, and none of the eruptions after AD 79 were as large or destructive as the Pompeian one.

The eruptions vary greatly in severity but are characterized by explosive outbursts of the kind dubbed [[Plinian Eruption|Plinian]] after [[Pliny the Younger]], a Roman writer who published a detailed description of the AD 79 eruption, including his uncle's death.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Younger, ''Letters'' [http://www.bartleby.com/9/4/1065.html 6.16].&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion, eruptions from Vesuvius have been so large that the whole of southern Europe has been blanketed by ash; in 472 and 1631, Vesuvian ash fell on [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]), over {{convert|1200|km}} away. A few times since 1944, landslides in the crater have raised clouds of ash dust, raising false alarms of an eruption.

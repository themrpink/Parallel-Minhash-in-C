==Etymology==
The name ''Espoo'' probably comes from the Swedish name for the River Espoo, ''Espå'' (or ''Espåå''), which in turn comes from the old Swedish word ''äspe'', meaning a border of [[aspen]], and the Swedish word for &quot;river&quot;, ''å'', thus &quot;a river bordered by aspen&quot;. The name was first mentioned in 1431. The banks of the River Espoo are even today heavily populated with aspen.

The first inhabitants in the area arrived about 9,000 years ago. Physical evidence (pollen grains) indicates agriculture from ca. 1000 AD, but there are no historical records. Up to the 13th century, the area was a borderland between the hunting grounds of Finnish Proper and [[Tavastians|Tavastian Finns]], with a sparse population. [[Immigrants]] from Sweden established permanent agricultural settlements to the area from the late 13th century onwards after the so-called [[Second Swedish Crusade|Second Crusade to Finland]]. Espoo was a subdivision of the [[Kirkkonummi]] congregation until 1486–1487. The oldest known document referring to Kirkkonummi is from 1330; Espoo as a subchapter has been dated to the 1380s, although the first document directly referring to Espoo is from as late as 1431. The construction of the [[Espoo Cathedral]], the oldest preserved building in Espoo, marks the independence of Espoo. Administratively, Espoo was a part of [[Uusimaa (historical province)|Uusimaa]]. When the province was split to Eastern and Western provinces governed from the Porvoo and [[Raseborg Castle|Raasepori castle]]s, respectively, the eastern border of the Raasepori province was in Espoo. The 13th-century road connecting the most important cities in Finland at that time, the [[King's Road (Finland)|King's Road]], passes through Espoo on its way from [[Stockholm]] via [[Turku]] and [[Porvoo]] to [[Vyborg|Viipuri]].

In 1557, King [[Gustav Vasa]] decided to stabilize and develop the region by founding a royal mansion in Espoo. The government bought the villages of Espåby and [[Mankby]] (Finnish: ''Mankki'') and transferred the population elsewhere, and built the royal mansion in Espåby. (Mankby was eventually abandoned and was never repopulated.) The royal mansion housed the king's local plenipotentiary ([[vogt]]), and collected royal [[tax in kind]] paid by labor on the mansion's farm. The administrative center [[Espoon keskus]] has grown around the church and the [[Espoo railway station]], but the municipality has retained a network-like structure to the modern day.

In 1920, Espoo was only a rural municipality of about 9,000 inhabitants, of whom 70% were Swedish speaking. Agriculture was the primary source of income, with 75% of the population making their living from farming. [[Kauniainen]] was separated from Espoo in 1920, and it gained city rights the same year as Espoo, in 1972.

Espoo started to grow rapidly in the 1940s and '50s. It quickly developed from a rural municipality into a fully-fledged industrial city, gaining city rights in 1972. Due to its proximity to Helsinki, Espoo soon became popular amongst people working in the capital. In the fifty years from 1950 to 2000, the population of Espoo grew from 22,000 to 210,000. Since 1945, the majority of people in Espoo have been Finnish-speaking. In 2006, the Swedish-speaking inhabitants represented barely 9% of the total population. The population growth is still continuing, but at a slower rate.

==Geography==
[[File:Subdivisions of Espoo-fi.svg|thumb|left|upright|The districts and major areas of Espoo]]

===Location===
Espoo is located in southern Finland, along the shore of the [[Gulf of Finland]], and in the [[Regions of Finland|region]] of [[Uusimaa]] and the [[Helsinki sub-region]]. Prior to the abolition of [[Provinces of Finland|Finnish provinces]] in 2009, Espoo was a part of the [[Southern Finland Province]].

The city borders [[Helsinki]], the Finnish capital, which is to the east. Other neighbouring municipalities are [[Vantaa]] to the east and northeast, [[Nurmijärvi]] to the north, [[Vihti]] to the northwest, and [[Kirkkonummi]] to the west and southwest. Espoo is a part of the Finnish Capital Region, which is the inner core of the [[Greater Helsinki]] metropolitan area.

===Subdivision===
{{main|Districts of Espoo}}
Espoo is divided into seven major areas ({{lang-fi|suuralueet}}, {{lang-sv|storområden}}): [[Vanha-Espoo]] (with [[Espoon keskus|administrative center]]), [[Suur-Espoonlahti]], [[Pohjois-Espoo]], [[Suur-Kauklahti]], [[Suur-Leppävaara]], [[Suur-Matinkylä]], and [[Suur-Tapiola]]. These major areas are then divided into a total of 56 [[Districts of Espoo|districts]].

===Features===
Although Espoo is relatively highly populated, it has large amounts of natural wilderness, particularly in the city's western and northern portions. The city has a total of 71 lakes, the largest of which are [[Lake Bodom]], Nuuksion Pitkäjärvi, Vanhankylän Pitkäjärvi, Loojärvi, Velskolan Pitkäjärvi, Saarijärvi, Matalajärvi, Siikajärvi, and Lippajärvi. The city has a large coastline on the [[Gulf of Finland]].

Espoo has six [[Natura 2000]] [[protected area]]s: Bånberget forests, Espoonlahti–Saunalahti bay area (partially in [[Kirkkonummi]]), Laajalahti bay, Matalajärvi lake, [[Nuuksio National Park]] (partially in Kirkkonummi and [[Vihti]]), as well as forests in Vestra (partially in [[Vantaa]]).

The official animal of Espoo is the [[Siberian flying squirrel]], the official bird is the [[common blackbird]], and the official plant is ''[[Anemone nemorosa]]''.

== Culture ==
[[File:Tapiola culture centre.jpg|thumb|The [[Espoo Cultural Centre]]]]
Espoo hosts a Museum of Modern Art called [[EMMA (museum)|EMMA]] (Espoo Museum of Modern Art), built in a renovated old print house, the [[WeeGee house]], named after an old book print company Weilin &amp; Göös. The same building hosts also Finland's only Museum of [[Horology]] ({{lang-fi|Kellomuseo}}, {{lang-sv|Urmuseum}}) and a Toy Museum. [[Glims Farmstead Museum]] is also located in the city. The [[Espoo cultural centre]], home of the world-renowned Tapiola Sinfonietta, where numerous concerts and theater performances are held, is located in [[Tapiola]] ({{lang-sv|Hagalund}}).

Espoo has several old manors of which two are open to the general public. The most important is [[Espoon kartano]] ({{lang-sv|Esbo gård}}, Espoo Manor), first mentioned in maps in 1495, and belonging to the noble Ramsay family since 1756. The current main building dates back to 1914, but a mill dates from the 1750s and Finland oldest walled [[bridge|stone bridge]] from 1777 is on the [[King's Road (Finland)|King's Road]] ({{lang-fi|Kuninkaantie}}, {{lang-sv|Kungsvägen}}) which passes by the manor. The main building can be rented for weddings and similar occasions. Guided tours are available on request for groups. The other manor open to public is Pakankylän kartano, located on the northern shore of [[Lake Bodom]]. The manor hosts a restaurant and club rooms, partly with original furniture open to the public, but meant originally to [[Kaisankoti]] sanatory and old people's home located on ground of the manor.

The Metal band [[Children of Bodom]] comes from Espoo, Finland. They are named after the unsolved murder known as the [[Lake Bodom murders]] which took place at the shore of [[Lake Bodom]], a lake in northern Espoo, in 1960. The bands [[Norther]] and [[Kiuas]] also come from Espoo.

The educational department took part in [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013 in Finland]].

===Ice hockey===

[[Espoo Blues]] was a successful hockey club; between 1998 and 2016 it iced a men's hockey team which played at the men's premier [[SM-liiga]] and a women's hockey team which played at the women's premier [[Naisten Liiga (ice hockey)|Naisten SM-sarja]]. The women's team, [[Espoo Blues Naiset]], won 13 Finnish women's championships in the 18-year span (1998-2016), seven of them won consecutively. The men's and women's ice hockey teams were known as Kiekko-Espoo from 1984 to 1998 and 1990 to 1998 respectively.

In Spring 2016 ''Jääkiekko Espoo Oy'', the organization which owned the clubs, declared bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.is.fi/sm-liiga/art-2000001157282.html|title=Konkurssipesä myöntää: Bluesin tilanteeseen ei ratkaisua|last=Hiitelä|first=Juha|date=2016-04-12|website=Ilta-Sanomat|language=fi|trans-title=The bankrupt organization concedes: Blues situation has no solution|access-date=2019-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new club called [[Espoo United (ice hockey)|Espoo United]] was established to replace Espoo Blues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.is.fi/mestis/art-2000001168126.html|title=Nyt se on varmaa: Jussi Salonoja perusti uuden seuran – &quot;Lähetän hakupaperit tänään&quot;|last=Lempinen|first=Marko|date=2016-04-28|website=Ilta-Sanomat|language=fi|trans-title=Now it is certain: Jussi Salonoja founded a new club - &quot;I'm submitting league admittance papers today&quot;|access-date=2019-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Espoo United (ice hockey)|Espoo United's men's ice hockey team]] played at the second highest level [[Mestis]]. The Espoo United women's hockey team played at the highest level, [[Naisten Liiga (ice hockey)|Naisten Liiga]], and won silver in the 2017 league championships. Espoo United was also active in basketball and the [[Espoo United (basketball)|men's basketball team]] played at the second highest level; the women's basketball team played at the highest level, [[Naisten Korisliiga]].

In August 2017, in what was described as an effort to stabilize the club's tenuous financial situation, Espoo United abandoned its women's teams in both ice hockey and basketball.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.is.fi/jaakiekko/art-2000005326203.html|title=Jussi Salonojalta raju ratkaisu: Espoo United hylkää naisjoukkueet|last=Oivio|first=Janne|last2=Lempinen|first2=Marko|date=2017-08-15|website=Ilta-Sanomat|language=fi|trans-title=Jussi Salonoja's drastic solution: Espoo United to abandon women's teams|access-date=2019-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Espoo United's former women's basketball team quickly acquired transfer to [[Tapiolan Honka]] but the women's ice hockey team was left in an unsustainable situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theicegarden.com/2017/8/17/16162120/espoon-united-womens-team-folds-one-month-before-puck-drop-naisten-liiga-pyeongchang-jussi-salonoja|title=Espoo United women's team folds one month before puck drop|last=Foster|first=Meredith|date=2017-08-17|website=The Ice Garden|access-date=2019-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Finnish Ice Hockey Association]] chose to intervene in September 2017 and created an organization that would allow the team to play under the name Espoo Blues until a better structure could be identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theicegarden.com/2017/9/4/16252084/blue-monday-blues-espoo-join-naisten-liiga-naisleijonat-finland|title=Blue Monday: Blues Espoo join Naisten Liiga|last=Foster|first=Meredith|date=2017-09-04|website=The Ice Garden|access-date=2019-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, despite the dumping of its women's teams, Espoo United declared bankruptcy and its men's teams folded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.is.fi/mestis/art-2000005667535.html|title=Espoo Unitedin konkurssista tuli virallista|date=2018-05-04|website=Ilta-Sanomat|language=fi|trans-title=Espoo United's bankruptcy becomes official|access-date=2019-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2019, the women's ice hockey team Espoo Blues merged with ''Kiekko Espoo Oy'', a significant junior hockey club with the largest girls hockey program in the country, to become [[Kiekko-Espoo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theicegarden.com/2019/4/30/18523465/kiekko-espoo-absorb-espoo-blues-rejoin-top-tier-naisten-liiga-finland|title=Kiekko-Espoo absorb Espoo Blues, rejoin top tier|last=Foster|first=Meredith|date=2019-04-30|website=The Ice Garden|access-date=2019-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the merger, the team was the winningest team in Naisten Liiga history with 14 [[Aurora Borealis Cup|Naisten Liiga championships]] and a combined 24 Naisten Liiga championship medals over 29 seasons.

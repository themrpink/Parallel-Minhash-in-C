The emergence of antivirals is the product of a greatly expanded knowledge of the genetic and molecular function of organisms, allowing biomedical researchers to understand the structure and function of viruses, major advances in the techniques for finding new drugs, and the pressure placed on the medical profession to deal with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ([[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]).

The first experimental antivirals were developed in the 1960s, mostly to deal with [[herpes simplex virus|herpes viruses]], and were found using traditional [[trial-and-error]] drug discovery methods. Researchers grew cultures of cells and infected them with the target virus. They then introduced into the cultures chemicals which they thought might inhibit viral activity and observed whether the level of virus in the cultures rose or fell. Chemicals that seemed to have an effect were selected for closer study.

This was a very time-consuming, hit-or-miss procedure, and in the absence of a good knowledge of how the target virus worked, it was not efficient in discovering effective antivirals which had few [[adverse effect|side effect]]s. Only in the 1980s, when the full [[genetic sequence]]s of viruses began to be unraveled, did researchers begin to learn how viruses worked in detail, and exactly what chemicals were needed to thwart their reproductive cycle.

==Antiviral Drug Design==
===Anti-viral targeting===
The general idea behind modern antiviral drug design is to identify viral proteins, or parts of proteins, that can be disabled. These &quot;targets&quot; should generally be as unlike any proteins or parts of proteins in humans as possible, to reduce the likelihood of side effects. The targets should also be common across many strains of a virus, or even among different species of virus in the same family, so a single drug will have broad effectiveness. For example, a researcher might target a critical enzyme synthesized by the virus, but not by the patient, that is common across strains, and see what can be done to interfere with its operation.

Once targets are identified, candidate drugs can be selected, either from drugs already known to have appropriate effects or by actually designing the candidate at the molecular level with a [[computer-aided design]] program.

The target proteins can be manufactured in the lab for testing with candidate treatments by [[genetic engineering|inserting the gene]] that synthesizes the target protein into [[bacteria]] or other kinds of cells. The cells are then cultured for mass production of the protein, which can then be exposed to various treatment candidates and evaluated with &quot;rapid screening&quot; technologies.

===Approaches by Virus life cycle stage===
[[Virus]]es consist of a [[genome]] and sometimes a few [[enzyme]]s stored in a capsule made of [[protein]] (called a [[capsid]]), and sometimes covered with a [[lipid]] layer (sometimes called an 'envelope'). Viruses cannot reproduce on their own and instead propagate by subjugating a host cell to produce copies of themselves, thus producing the next generation.

Researchers working on such &quot;[[rational drug design]]&quot; strategies for developing antivirals have tried to attack viruses at every stage of their life cycles. Some species of mushrooms have been found to contain multiple antiviral chemicals with similar synergistic effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lindequist|first1=Ulrike|last2=Niedermeyer|first2=Timo H. J.|last3=Jülich|first3=Wolf-Dieter|year=2005|title=The Pharmacological Potential of Mushrooms|journal=Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine|volume=2|issue=3|pages=285–99|doi=10.1093/ecam/neh107|pmc=1193547|pmid=16136207}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Compounds isolated from fruiting bodies and filtrates of various mushrooms have broad-spectrum antiviral activities, but successful production and availability of such compounds as frontline antiviral is a long way away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Pradeep|first1=Prabin|title=Antiviral Potency of Mushroom Constituents|date=2019|work=Medicinal Mushrooms: Recent Progress in Research and Development|pages=275–97|editor-last=Agrawal|editor-first=Dinesh Chandra|publisher=Springer Singapore|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-981-13-6382-5_10|isbn=9789811363825|last2=Manju|first2=Vidya|last3=Ahsan|first3=Mohammad Feraz|editor2-last=Dhanasekaran|editor2-first=Muralikrishnan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viral life cycles vary in their precise details depending on the type of virus, but they all share a general pattern:
# Attachment to a host cell.
# Release of viral genes and possibly enzymes into the host cell.
# Replication of viral components using host-cell machinery.
# Assembly of viral components into complete viral particles.
# Release of viral particles to infect new host cells.

====Before cell entry====
One anti-viral strategy is to interfere with the ability of a virus to infiltrate a target cell. The virus must go through a sequence of steps to do this, beginning with binding to a specific &quot;[[receptor (biology)|receptor]]&quot; molecule on the surface of the host cell and ending with the virus &quot;uncoating&quot; inside the cell and releasing its contents. Viruses that have a lipid envelope must also fuse their envelope with the target cell, or with a vesicle that transports them into the cell before they can uncoat.

This stage of viral replication can be inhibited in two ways:
# Using agents which mimic the virus-associated protein (VAP) and bind to the cellular receptors. This may include VAP [[anti-idiotypic]] [[antibodies]], natural [[ligand]]s of the receptor and anti-receptor antibodies.{{Clarify|date=March 2008}}
# Using agents which mimic the cellular receptor and bind to the VAP. This includes anti-VAP [[antibody|antibodies]], receptor anti-idiotypic antibodies, extraneous receptor and synthetic receptor mimics.

This strategy of designing drugs can be very expensive, and since the process of generating anti-idiotypic antibodies is partly trial and error, it can be a relatively slow process until an adequate molecule is produced.

=====Entry inhibitor=====
A very early stage of viral infection is [[viral entry]], when the virus attaches to and enters the host cell. A number of &quot;entry-inhibiting&quot; or &quot;entry-blocking&quot; drugs are being developed to fight HIV. HIV most heavily targets the immune system's white blood cells known as &quot;helper T cells&quot;, and identifies these target cells through T-cell surface receptors designated &quot;[[CD4]]&quot; and &quot;[[CCR5]]&quot;. Attempts to interfere with the binding of HIV with the CD4 receptor have failed to stop HIV from infecting helper T cells, but research continues on trying to interfere with the binding of HIV to the CCR5 receptor in hopes that it will be more effective.

HIV infects a cell through fusion with the cell membrane, which requires two different cellular molecular participants, CD4 and a chemokine receptor (differing depending on the cell type). Approaches to blocking this virus/cell fusion have shown some promise in preventing entry of the virus into a cell. At least one of these entry inhibitors—a biomimetic peptide called [[Enfuvirtide]], or the brand name Fuzeon—has received FDA approval and has been in use for some time. Potentially, one of the benefits from the use of an effective entry-blocking or entry-inhibiting agent is that it potentially may not only prevent the spread of the virus within an infected individual but also the spread from an infected to an uninfected individual.

One possible advantage of the therapeutic approach of blocking viral entry (as opposed to the currently dominant approach of viral enzyme inhibition) is that it may prove more difficult for the virus to develop resistance to this therapy than for the virus to mutate or evolve its enzymatic protocols.

=====Uncoating inhibitor=====
Inhibitors of uncoating have also been investigated.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10325536&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bishop NE |title=Examination of potential inhibitors of hepatitis A virus uncoating |journal=Intervirology |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=261–71 |year=1998 |pmid=10325536 |doi= 10.1159/000024948|s2cid=21222121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid1850030&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Almela MJ, González ME, Carrasco L |title=Inhibitors of poliovirus uncoating efficiently block the early membrane permeabilization induced by virus particles |journal=J. Virol. |volume=65 |issue=5 |pages=2572–77 |date=May 1991 |pmid=1850030 |pmc=240614|doi=10.1128/JVI.65.5.2572-2577.1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amantadine]] and [[rimantadine]] have been introduced to combat influenza. These agents act on penetration and uncoating.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-7817-4673-6&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Beringer, Paul |author2=Troy, David A. |author3=Remington, Joseph P. |title=Remington, the science and practice of pharmacy |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2006 |page=1419 |isbn=978-0-7817-4673-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pleconaril]] works against [[rhinovirus]]es, which cause the [[common cold]], by blocking a pocket on the surface of the virus that controls the uncoating process. This pocket is similar in most strains of rhinoviruses and [[enterovirus]]es, which can cause diarrhea, [[meningitis]], [[conjunctivitis]], and [[encephalitis]].

Some scientists are making the case that a vaccine against rhinoviruses, the predominant cause of the common cold, is achievable.
Vaccines that combine dozens of varieties of rhinovirus at once are effective in stimulating antiviral antibodies in mice and monkeys, researchers have reported in [[Nature Communications]] in 2016.

Rhinoviruses are the most common cause of the common cold; other viruses such as [[respiratory syncytial virus]], [[parainfluenza virus]] and [[adenoviruses]] can cause them too. Rhinoviruses also exacerbate asthma attacks. Although rhinoviruses come in many varieties, they do not drift to the same degree that influenza viruses do. A mixture of 50 inactivated rhinovirus types should be able to stimulate neutralizing antibodies against all of them to some degree.

====During viral synthesis====
A second approach is to target the processes that synthesize virus components after a virus invades a cell.

=====Reverse transcription=====
One way of doing this is to develop [[nucleotide]] or [[nucleoside]] analogues that look like the building blocks of [[RNA]] or [[DNA]], but deactivate the enzymes that synthesize the RNA or DNA once the analogue is incorporated. This approach is more commonly associated with the inhibition of [[reverse transcriptase]] (RNA to DNA) than with &quot;normal&quot; transcriptase (DNA to RNA).

The first successful antiviral, [[aciclovir]], is a nucleoside analogue, and is effective against herpesvirus infections. The first antiviral drug to be approved for treating HIV, [[zidovudine]] (AZT), is also a nucleoside analogue.

An improved knowledge of the action of reverse transcriptase has led to better nucleoside analogues to treat HIV infections. One of these drugs, [[lamivudine]], has been approved to treat hepatitis B, which uses reverse transcriptase as part of its replication process. Researchers have gone further and developed inhibitors that do not look like nucleosides, but can still block reverse transcriptase.

Another target being considered for HIV antivirals include [[RNase H]]—which is a component of reverse transcriptase that splits the synthesized DNA from the original viral RNA.

=====Integrase=====
Another target is [[integrase]], which integrate the synthesized DNA into the host cell genome.

=====Transcription=====
Once a virus genome becomes operational in a host cell, it then generates [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA) molecules that direct the synthesis of viral proteins. Production of mRNA is initiated by proteins known as [[transcription factor]]s. Several antivirals are now being designed to block attachment of transcription factors to viral DNA.

=====Translation/antisense=====
Genomics has not only helped find targets for many antivirals, it has provided the basis for an entirely new type of drug, based on &quot;antisense&quot; molecules. These are segments of DNA or RNA that are designed as complementary molecule to critical sections of viral genomes, and the binding of these antisense segments to these target sections blocks the operation of those genomes. A phosphorothioate antisense drug named [[fomivirsen]] has been introduced, used to treat opportunistic eye infections in AIDS patients caused by [[cytomegalovirus]], and other antisense antivirals are in development. An antisense structural type that has proven especially valuable in research is [[morpholino]] antisense.

Morpholino oligos have been used to experimentally suppress many viral types:

=====Translation/ribozymes=====
Yet another antiviral technique inspired by genomics is a set of drugs based on [[ribozyme]]s, which are enzymes that will cut apart viral RNA or DNA at selected sites. In their natural course, ribozymes are used as part of the viral manufacturing sequence, but these synthetic ribozymes are designed to cut RNA and DNA at sites that will disable them.

A ribozyme antiviral to deal with [[hepatitis C]] has been suggested,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14659071&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ryu KJ, Lee SW |title=Identification of the most accessible sites to ribozymes on the hepatitis C virus internal ribosome entry site |journal=J.

This is part of a broader effort to create genetically modified cells that can be injected into a host to attack pathogens by generating specialized proteins that block viral replication at various phases of the viral life cycle.

=====Protein processing and targeting=====
Interference with post translational modifications or with targeting of viral proteins in the cell is also possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alarcón B, González ME, Carrasco L | year = 1988 | title = Megalomycin C, a macrolide antibiotic that blocks protein glycosylation and shows antiviral activity | journal = FEBS Lett | volume = 231 | issue = 1| pages = 207–11 | pmid = 2834223 | doi=10.1016/0014-5793(88)80732-4| s2cid = 43114821 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Protease inhibitors====
Some viruses include an enzyme known as a [[protease]] that cuts viral protein chains apart so they can be assembled into their final configuration. HIV includes a protease, and so considerable research has been performed to find &quot;[[protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitors]]&quot; to attack HIV at that phase of its life cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Anderson J, Schiffer C, Lee SK, Swanstrom R |title=Antiviral Strategies |chapter=Viral protease inhibitors |journal=Handb Exp Pharmacol |volume= 189|issue=189 |pages=85–110 |year=2009 |pmid=19048198 |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-79086-0_4 |series=Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology |pmc=7120715 |isbn=978-3-540-79085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protease inhibitors became available in the 1990s and have proven effective, though they can have unusual side effects, for example causing fat to build up in unusual places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Role of Protease Inhibitors in the Pathogenesis of HIV-Associated Lipodystrophy: Cellular Mechanisms and Clinical Implications |journal=Toxicol Pathol |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=65–77 |year=2009 |pmid=19171928 |doi=10.1177/0192623308327119 |pmc=3170409 |last1=Flint |first1=O.

A. |last8=Bellamine |first8=A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Improved protease inhibitors are now in development.

Protease inhibitors have also been seen in nature. A protease inhibitor was isolated from the [[Shiitake]] mushroom (''Lentinus edodes'').&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10411656&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Odani S, Tominaga K, Kondou S |title=The inhibitory properties and primary structure of a novel serine proteinase inhibitor from the fruiting body of the basidiomycete, Lentinus edodes |journal=European Journal of Biochemistry |volume=262 |issue=3 |pages=915–23 |year=1999 |pmid=10411656 |doi=10.1046/j.1432-1327.1999.00463.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of this may explain the Shiitake mushroom's noted antiviral activity ''in vitro''.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid2469420&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Suzuki H, Okubo A, Yamazaki S, Suzuki K, Mitsuya H, Toda S |title=Inhibition of the infectivity and cytopathic effect of human immunodeficiency virus by water-soluble lignin in an extract of the culture medium of Lentinus edodes mycelia (LEM) |journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications |volume=160 |issue=1 |pages=367–73 |year=1989 |pmid=2469420 |doi=10.1016/0006-291X(89)91665-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Long dsRNA helix targeting=====
Most viruses produce long [[dsRNA]] helices during transcription and replication. In contrast, uninfected [[mammalian]] cells generally produce dsRNA helices of fewer than 24 [[base pairs]] during transcription. '''[[DRACO]]''' ('''[[RNA#Double-stranded RNA|double-stranded RNA]] activated [[caspase]] [[oligomer]]izer''') is a group of experimental antiviral drugs initially developed at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. In cell culture, DRACO was reported to have broad-spectrum efficacy against many infectious viruses, including [[Dengue virus|dengue flavivirus]], Amapari and Tacaribe [[arenavirus]], Guama [[Bunyaviridae|bunyavirus]], [[H1N1 influenza]] and [[rhinovirus]], and was additionally found effective against influenza ''in vivo'' in weanling mice. It was reported to induce rapid [[apoptosis]] selectively in virus-infected mammalian cells, while leaving uninfected cells unharmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=3144912 | pmid=21818340 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0022572 | volume=6 | title=Broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics | year=2011 | author=Rider TH, Zook CE, Boettcher TL, Wick ST, Pancoast JS, Zusman BD | journal=PLOS ONE | issue=7 | page=e22572 | bibcode=2011PLoSO...622572R}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''DRACO''' effects cell death via one of the last steps in the apoptosis pathway in which complexes containing intracellular apoptosis signalling molecules simultaneously bind multiple [[Caspase|procaspases]]. The procaspases transactivate via cleavage, activate additional caspases in the cascade, and cleave a variety of cellular proteins, thereby killing the cell.

====Assembly====
[[Rifampicin]] acts at the assembly phase.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8289340&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sodeik B, Griffiths G, Ericsson M, Moss B, Doms RW |title=Assembly of vaccinia virus: effects of rifampin on the intracellular distribution of viral protein p65 |journal=J.

====Release phase====
The final stage in the life cycle of a virus is the release of completed viruses from the host cell, and this step has also been targeted by antiviral drug developers. Two drugs named [[zanamivir]] (Relenza) and [[oseltamivir]] (Tamiflu) that have been recently introduced to treat influenza prevent the release of viral particles by blocking a molecule named [[neuraminidase]] that is found on the surface of flu viruses, and also seems to be constant across a wide range of flu strains.

===Immune system stimulation===
Rather than attacking viruses directly, a second category of tactics for fighting viruses involves encouraging the body's immune system to attack them. Some antivirals of this sort do not focus on a specific pathogen, instead stimulating the immune system to attack a range of pathogens.

One of the best-known of this class of drugs are [[interferon]]s, which inhibit viral synthesis in infected cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Samuel CE |title=Antiviral Actions of Interferons |journal=Clin. Microbiol. Rev. |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=778–809 |date=October 2001 |pmid=11585785 |pmc=89003 |doi=10.1128/CMR.14.4.778-809.2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; One form of human interferon named &quot;interferon alpha&quot; is well-established as part of the standard treatment for hepatitis B and C,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burra P |title=Hepatitis C |journal=Semin. Liver Dis. |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=53–65 |year=2009 |pmid=19235659 |doi=10.1055/s-0029-1192055}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other interferons are also being investigated as treatments for various diseases.

A more specific approach is to synthesize [[antibodies]], protein molecules that can bind to a pathogen and mark it for attack by other elements of the immune system. Once researchers identify a particular target on the pathogen, they can synthesize quantities of identical &quot;monoclonal&quot; antibodies to link up that target. A monoclonal drug is now being sold to help fight [[respiratory syncytial virus]] in babies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nokes JD, Cane PA |title=New strategies for control of respiratory syncytial virus infection |journal=Curr.

== Antiviral drug resistance ==
Antiviral resistance can be defined by a decreased susceptibility to a drug caused by changes in viral genotypes. In cases of antiviral resistance, drugs have either diminished or no effectiveness against their target virus.&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;{{cite web|title=Influenza Antiviral Drug Resistance{{!}} Seasonal Influenza (Flu) {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/antiviralresistance.htm|website=www.cdc.gov|date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue inevitably remains a major obstacle to antiviral therapy as it has developed to almost all specific and effective [[antimicrobials]], including antiviral agents.&lt;ref name=&quot;PMID9728000&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pillay |first1=D |last2=Zambon |first2=M |title=Antiviral Drug Resistance |journal=BMJ |date=1998 |volume=317 |issue=7159 |pages=660–62 |pmid=9728000 |pmc=1113839 |doi=10.1136/bmj.317.7159.660 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) inclusively recommends anyone six months and older to get a yearly vaccination to protect them from [[influenza A]] viruses (H1N1) and (H3N2) and up to two [[influenza B]] viruses (depending on the vaccination).&lt;ref name= CDC/&gt; Comprehensive protection starts by ensuring vaccinations are current and complete. However, vaccines are preventative and are not generally used once a patient has been infected with a virus. Additionally, the availability of these vaccines can be limited based on financial or locational reasons which can prevent the effectiveness of herd immunity, making effective antivirals a necessity.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC&quot; /&gt;

The three FDA-approved neuraminidase antiviral flu drugs available in the United States, recommended by the CDC, include: [[oseltamivir]] (Tamiflu), [[zanamivir]] (Relenza), and [[peramivir]] (Rapivab).&lt;ref name= CDC/&gt; Influenza antiviral resistance often results from changes occurring in neuraminidase and hemagglutinin proteins on the viral surface. Currently, neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are the most frequently prescribed antivirals because they are effective against both influenza A and B. However, antiviral resistance is known to develop if mutations to the neuraminidase proteins prevent NAI binding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moss2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moss |first1=Ronald |last2=Davey |first2=Richard |last3=Steigbigel |first3=Roy |last4=Fang |first4=Fang |title=Targeting pandemic influenza: a primer on influenza antivirals and drug resistance |journal=Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy |date=June 2010 |volume=65 |issue=6 |pages=1086–93 |url=https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/65/6/1086/707817 |accessdate=30 October 2018|doi=10.1093/jac/dkq100 |pmid=20375034 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was seen in the H257Y mutation, which was responsible for [[oseltamivir]] resistance to H1N1 strains in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC&quot; /&gt; The inability of NA inhibitors to bind to the virus allowed this strain of virus with the resistance mutation to spread due to natural selection.

=== Origin of antiviral resistance ===
The genetic makeup of viruses is constantly changing, which can cause a virus to become resistant to currently available treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Nijhuis|first1=M|last2=van Maarseveen|first2=NM|last3=Boucher|first3=CA|title=Antiviral resistance and impact on viral replication capacity: evolution of viruses under antiviral pressure occurs in three phases.|journal=Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology|volume=189|date=2009|issue=189|pages=299–320|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-79086-0_11|pmid=19048205|isbn=978-3-540-79085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viruses can become resistant through spontaneous or intermittent mechanisms throughout the course of an antiviral treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC&quot;/&gt; Immunocompromised patients, more often than immunocompetent patients, hospitalized with [[pneumonia]] are at the highest risk of developing oseltamivir resistance during treatment.&lt;ref name= CDC/&gt; Subsequent to exposure to someone else with the flu, those who received oseltamivir for &quot;post-exposure prophylaxis&quot; are also at higher risk of resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO {{!}} Antiviral use and the risk of drug resistance|url=https://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_antiviral_use_20090925/en/|website=www.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanisms for antiviral resistance development depend on the type of virus in question. RNA viruses such as hepatitis C and influenza A have high error rates during genome replication because RNA polymerases lack proofreading activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bookshelf ID: NBK21523&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lodish |first1=H |last2=Berk |first2=A |last3=Zipursky |first3=S |title=Molecular Cell Biology: Viruses – Structure, Function, and Uses |date=2000 |publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company |location=New York, New York |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21523/ |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA viruses also have small genome sizes that are typically less than 30 kb, which allow them to sustain a high frequency of mutations.&lt;ref name=&quot;RacanielloRNA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Racaniello |first1=Vincent |title=The error-prone ways of RNA synthesis |url=http://www.virology.ws/2009/05/10/the-error-prone-ways-of-rna-synthesis/ |website=Virology Blog |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA viruses, such as HPV and herpesvirus, hijack host cell replication machinery, which gives them proofreading capabilities during replication. DNA viruses are therefore less error prone, are generally less diverse, and are more slowly evolving than RNA viruses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bookshelf ID: NBK21523&quot; /&gt; In both cases, the likelihood of mutations is exacerbated by the speed with which viruses reproduce, which provides more opportunities for mutations to occur in successive replications. Billions of viruses are produced every day during the course of an infection, with each replication giving another chance for mutations that encode for resistance to occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;PMID19906671&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thebaud |first1=G |last2=Chadeouf |first2=J |last3=Morelli |first3=M |last4=McCauley |first4=J |last5=Haydon |first5=D |title=The relationship between mutation frequency and replication strategy in positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses |journal=Proc.

Multiple strains of one virus can be present in the body at one time, and some of these strains may contain mutations that cause antiviral resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;PMID9728000&quot; /&gt; This effect, called the [[quasispecies model]], results in immense variation in any given sample of virus, and gives the opportunity for natural selection to favor viral strains with the highest fitness every time the virus is spread to a new host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Viruses are models for embracing diversity |journal=Nature Microbiology |date=2018 |volume=3 |issue=4 |page=389 |doi=10.1038/s41564-018-0145-3 |pmid=29588540 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, recombination, the joining of two different viral variants, and [[reassortment]], the swapping of viral gene segments among viruses in the same cell, play a role in resistance, especially in influenza.&lt;ref name=&quot;RacanielloRNA&quot; /&gt;

Antiviral resistance has been reported in antivirals for herpes, HIV, hepatitis B and C, and influenza, but antiviral resistance is a possibility for all viruses.&lt;ref name=&quot;PMID9728000&quot; /&gt; Mechanisms of antiviral resistance vary between virus types.

=== Detection of antiviral resistance ===
National and international surveillance is performed by the CDC to determine effectiveness of the current FDA-approved antiviral flu drugs.&lt;ref name= CDC/&gt; Public health officials use this information to make current recommendations about the use of flu antiviral medications. [[WHO]] further recommends in-depth epidemiological investigations to control potential transmission of the resistant virus and prevent future progression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayden|first1=FG|last2=de Jong|first2=MD|title=Emerging influenza antiviral resistance threats.|journal=The Journal of Infectious Diseases|date=1 January 2011|volume=203|issue=1|pages=6–10|pmid=21148489|doi=10.1093/infdis/jiq012|pmc=3086431}}&lt;/ref&gt; As novel treatments and detection techniques to antiviral resistance are enhanced so can the establishment of strategies to combat the inevitable emergence of antiviral resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kimberlin|first1=DW|last2=Whitley|first2=RJ|title=Antiviral resistance: mechanisms, clinical significance, and future implications.|journal=The Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy|date=March 1996|volume=37|issue=3|pages=403–21|pmid=9182098|doi=10.1093/jac/37.3.403|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treatment options for antiviral resistant pathogens ===
If a virus is not fully wiped out during a regimen of antivirals, treatment creates a bottleneck in the viral population that selects for resistance, and there is a chance that a resistant strain may repopulate the host.&lt;ref name=&quot;PMID28694997&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Irwin |first1=K |last2=Renzette |first2=N |last3=Kowalik |first3=T |last4=Jensen |first4=J |title=Antiviral drug resistance as an adaptive process |journal=Virus Evolution |date=2016 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=vew014 |pmid=28694997 |pmc=5499642 |doi=10.1093/ve/vew014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Viral treatment mechanisms must therefore account for the selection of resistant viruses.

The most commonly used method for treating resistant viruses is combination therapy, which uses multiple antivirals in one treatment regimen. This is thought to decrease the likelihood that one mutation could cause antiviral resistance, as the antivirals in the cocktail target different stages of the viral life cycle.&lt;ref name=&quot;PMID19258250&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moscona |first1=A |s2cid=205104988 |title=Global transmission of oseltamivir-resistant influenza |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |date=2009 |volume=360 |issue=10 |pages=953–56 |pmid=19258250|doi=10.1056/NEJMp0900648 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is frequently used in retroviruses like HIV, but a number of studies have demonstrated its effectiveness against influenza A, as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;PMID20466277&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Strasfeld |first1=L |last2=Chou |first2=S |title=Antiviral Drug Resistance: Mechanisms and Clinical Implications |journal=Infectious Disease Clinics of North America |date=2010 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=413–37 |pmid=20466277|pmc=2871161 |doi=10.1016/j.idc.2010.01.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Viruses can also be screened for resistance to drugs before treatment is started. This minimizes exposure to unnecessary antivirals and ensures that an effective medication is being used. This may improve patient outcomes and could help detect new resistance mutations during routine scanning for known mutants.&lt;ref name=&quot;PMID28694997&quot; /&gt; However, this has not been consistently implemented in treatment facilities at this time.

== Vaccinations==
{{Main|Vaccination}}
While most antivirals treat viral infection, [[vaccines]] are a preemptive first line of defense against pathogens. Vaccination involves the introduction (i.e. via injection) of a small amount of typically inactivated or attenuated [[antigenic]] material to stimulate an individual's [[immune system]]. The immune system responds by developing [[white blood cells]] to specifically combat the introduced pathogen, resulting in [[adaptive]] [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Center for Disease Control|title=Understanding How Vaccines Work |url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/conversations/downloads/vacsafe-understand-color-office.pdf |access-date= 20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaccination in a population results in [[herd immunity]] and greatly improved population health, with significant reductions in viral infection and disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;HDL&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1007/3-540-36583-4_1|isbn=978-3-540-29382-8 |pmid=16989261|year=2006|last1=Heymann|first1=D.

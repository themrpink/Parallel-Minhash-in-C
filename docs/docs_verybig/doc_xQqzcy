===Principals Committee===
The Principals Committee of the National Security Council is the Cabinet-level senior interagency forum for consideration of national security policy issues. The Principals Committee is convened and chaired by the National Security Advisor. The regular attendees of the Principals Committee are the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]], the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]], the [[United States Secretary of Energy|Secretary of Energy]], the [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]], the [[White House Chief of Staff]], the [[Director of National Intelligence]], the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], the [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency]], the [[Homeland Security Advisor]], and the [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt;

The [[White House Counsel]], the Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs, the [[Director of the Office of Management and Budget]], the [[Deputy National Security Advisor (United States)|Deputy National Security Advisor]], the Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategy, the National Security Advisor to the Vice President, and the NSC Executive Secretary may also attend all meetings of the Principals Committee. When considering international economic issues, the Principals Committee's regular attendees will include the [[Secretary of Commerce]], the [[United States Trade Representative]], and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot;&gt;[https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2017-07064.pdf] [[Federal Register]] National Security Presidential Memorandum (NSPM-4)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deputies Committee===
The [[National Security Council Deputies Committee]] is the senior sub-Cabinet interagency forum for consideration of national security policy issues. The Deputies Committee is also responsible for reviewing and monitoring the interagency national security process including for establishing and directing the Policy Coordination Committees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/28/presidential-memorandum-organization-national-security-council-and] [[White House Office of the Press Secretary]] Presidential Memorandum Organization of the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council&lt;/ref&gt; The Deputies Committee is convened and chaired by the [[Deputy National Security Advisor (United States)|Deputy National Security Advisor]] or the Deputy Homeland Security Advisor.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot;/&gt;

Regular members of the Deputies Committee are the Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategy, the [[United States Deputy Secretary of State|Deputy Secretary of State]], [[United States Deputy Secretary of the Treasury|Deputy Secretary of the Treasury]], the [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense|Deputy Secretary of Defense]], the [[United States Deputy Attorney General|Deputy Attorney General]], the [[United States Deputy Secretary of Energy|Deputy Secretary of Energy]], the [[United States Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security|Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security]], the Deputy Director of the [[Office of Management and Budget]], the Deputy [[Director of National Intelligence]], the [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], the National Security Advisor to the Vice President, the [[Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development]], and the [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency]]. Invitations to participate in or attend specific meetings are extended to Deputy or Under Secretary level of executive departments and agencies and to other senior officials when relevant issues are discussed. The Executive Secretary and the Deputy White House Counsel also attend. The relevant Senior Director on the National Security Council staff is also invited to attend when relevant.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot;/&gt;

===Policy Coordination Committees===
The Policy Coordination Committees of the National Security Council, established and directed by the Deputies Committee, are responsible for the management of the development and implementation of national security policies through interagency coordination. Policy Coordination Committees are the main day-to-day for interagency coordination of national security policy development, implementation and analysis in aide of the Deputies Committee and the Principals Committee. Policy Coordination Committees are chaired by Senior Directors on the National Security Council staff, or sometimes [[National Economic Council (United States)|National Economic Council]] staff, with Assistant Secretary-level officials from the relevant executive department or agency acting as co-chairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot;/&gt;

===Directorate of Global Health Security and Biodefense===
The Directorate of Global Health Security and Biodefense, created by Barack Obama in 2016 in response to the [[Ebola virus disease#2013–2016 West Africa|2014 Ebola outbreak]], was responsible &quot;to prepare for the next disease outbreak and prevent it from becoming an epidemic or pandemic.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc-trump-struggles-explain&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Benen |first1=Steve |title=Trump struggles to explain why he disbanded his global health team |url=https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-struggles-explain-why-he-disbanded-his-global-health-team-n1153221 |access-date=14 March 2020 |work=MSNBC |date=9 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nsc-pandemic-office-trump-closed&quot;&gt;Cameron, Beth, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/nsc-pandemic-office-trump-closed/2020/03/13/a70de09c-6491-11ea-acca-80c22bbee96f_story.html &quot;I ran the White House pandemic office.

The responsibilities that formerly belonged to the directorate, along with those of arms control and nonproliferation, and of weapons of mass destruction terrorism, were absorbed into a single new directorate, counterproliferation and biodefense, and assigned to [[Tim Morrison (presidential advisor)|Tim Morrison]] in July 2018 as director. Morrison characterized the consolidation as part of an overall NSC &quot;reduction of force&quot; and called it &quot;specious&quot; to say the office was &quot;dissolved,&quot; describing the previous size of the organization as &quot;bloat,&quot; and stating &quot;That is why Trump began streamlining the NSC staff in 2017.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Morrison (presidential advisor)|Morrison, Tim]], [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/16/no-white-house-didnt-dissolve-its-pandemic-response-office/ &quot;No, the White House didn't 'dissolve' its pandemic response office.

He continued: &quot;And rather than spending the money — and I'm a business person — I don't like having thousands of people around when you don't need them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brady |first1=James |title=Remarks by President Trump, Vice President Pence, and Members of the Coronavirus Task Force in Press Conference |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-conference/ |website=White House, Press Briefings |access-date=17 March 2020 |date=2 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the team before cuts was estimated at 430 people, but the &quot;thousands&quot; referenced by the president also included reduction in the staff numbers of the CDC.&lt;ref name=&quot;was-white-house-office-global-pandemics-eliminated&quot; /&gt;

The term &quot;Pandemic Response Team&quot; is a popularized, unofficial term for the former directorate of Global Health Security and Biodefense. The term was popularized by a series of tweets from Popular Information author [[Judd Legum]], claiming that &quot;Trump fired the entire Pandemic Response Team two years ago and didn't replace them&quot; and urging the rumor to spread by claiming &quot;more people should be talking about&quot; it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Palma |first1=Bethania |title=Did Trump Administration Fire the US Pandemic Response Team? |url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-fire-pandemic-team/ |website=Snopes |access-date=14 March 2020 |date=26 Feb 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|Change of ordering in a (mathematical) set}}
[[File:Permutations RGB.svg|thumb|120 px|Each of the six rows is a different permutation of three distinct balls]]
In [[mathematics]], a '''permutation''' of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] is, loosely speaking, an arrangement of its members into a [[sequence]] or [[linear order]], or if the set is already ordered, a rearrangement of its elements. The word &quot;permutation&quot; also refers to the act or process of changing the linear order of an ordered set.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Webster|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Permutations differ from [[combination]]s, which are selections of some members of a set regardless of order. For example, written as [[tuple]]s, there are six permutations of the set {1,2,3}, namely: (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), and (3,2,1). These are all the possible orderings of this three-element set. [[Anagram]]s of words whose letters are different are also permutations: the letters are already ordered in the original word, and the anagram is a reordering of the letters. The study of permutations of [[finite set]]s is an important topic in the fields of [[combinatorics]] and [[group theory]].

Permutations are used in almost every branch of mathematics, and in many other fields of science. In [[computer science]], they are used for analyzing [[sorting algorithm]]s; in [[quantum physics]], for describing states of particles; and in [[biology]], for describing [[RNA]] sequences. 

{{anchor|n-factorial}}The number of permutations of {{math|''n''}} distinct objects is {{math|''n''}}&amp;nbsp;[[factorial]], usually written as {{math|''n''!}}, which means the product of all positive integers less than or equal to {{math|''n''}}.

Technically, a permutation of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {{math|''S''}} is defined as a [[bijection]] from {{math|''S''}} to itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|McCoy|1968|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nering|1970|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, it is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from {{math|''S''}} to {{math|''S''}} for which every element occurs exactly once as an [[image (mathematics)|image]] value. This is related to the rearrangement of the elements of {{math|''S''}} in which each element {{math|''s''}} is replaced by the corresponding {{math|''f''(''s'')}}. For example, the permutation (3,1,2) mentioned above is described by the function &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; defined as:

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha(1) = 3, \quad \alpha(2) = 1, \quad \alpha(3) = 2&lt;/math&gt;.

The collection of all permutations of a set form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] called the [[symmetric group]] of the set. The group operation is the [[function composition|composition]] (performing two given rearrangements in succession), which results in another rearrangement. As properties of permutations do not depend on the nature of the set elements, it is often the permutations of the set &lt;math&gt;\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}&lt;/math&gt; that are considered for studying permutations. 

In elementary combinatorics, the {{math|''k''}}-permutations, or [[partial permutation]]s, are the ordered arrangements of {{math|''k''}} distinct elements selected from a set. When {{math|''k''}} is equal to the size of the set, these are the permutations of the set.

[[Image:Rubik's cube.svg|thumb|In the popular puzzle [[Rubik's cube]] invented in 1974 by [[Ernő Rubik]], each turn of the puzzle faces creates a permutation of the surface colors.]]

==History==
Permutations called [[Hexagram (I Ching)|hexagrams]] were used in China in the [[I Ching]] ([[Pinyin]]: Yi Jing) as early as 1000 BC.

[[Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi|Al-Khalil]] (717–786), an [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Arab mathematician]] and [[cryptographer]], wrote the ''Book of Cryptographic Messages''. It contains the first use of [[permutations and combinations]], to list all possible [[Arabic language|Arabic]] words with and without vowels.&lt;ref name=&quot;LB&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Broemeling|first=Lyle D.|title=An Account of Early Statistical Inference in Arab Cryptology|journal=The American Statistician|date=1 November 2011|volume=65|issue=4|pages=255–257|doi=10.1198/tas.2011.10191|s2cid=123537702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule to determine the number of permutations of ''n'' objects was known in Indian culture around 1150. The ''[[Lilavati]]'' by the Indian mathematician [[Bhāskara II|Bhaskara II]] contains a passage that translates to:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The product of multiplication of the arithmetical series beginning and increasing by unity and continued to the number of places, will be the variations of number with specific figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=N. L. |last=Biggs |title=The Roots of Combinatorics |journal=Historia Math. |volume=6 |year=1979 |issue=2 |pages=109–136 |doi=10.1016/0315-0860(79)90074-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1677, [[Fabian Stedman]] described factorials when explaining the number of permutations of bells in [[change ringing]]. Starting from two bells: &quot;first, ''two'' must be admitted to be varied in two ways&quot;, which he illustrates by showing 1 2 and 2 1.{{sfn|Stedman|1677|p=4}}  He then explains that with three bells there are &quot;three times two figures to be produced out of three&quot; which again is illustrated.  His explanation involves &quot;cast away 3, and 1.2 will remain; cast away 2, and 1.3 will remain; cast away 1, and 2.3 will remain&quot;.{{sfn|Stedman|1677|p=5}}  He then moves on to four bells and repeats the casting away argument showing that there will be four different sets of three.  Effectively, this is a recursive process.  He continues with five bells using the &quot;casting away&quot; method and tabulates the resulting 120 combinations.{{sfn|Stedman|1677|pp=6—7}}  At this point he gives up and remarks:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Now the nature of these methods is such, that the changes on one number comprehends the changes on all lesser numbers, ... insomuch that a compleat Peal of changes on one number seemeth to be formed by uniting of the compleat Peals on all lesser numbers into one entire body;{{sfn|Stedman|1677|p=8}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Stedman widens the consideration of permutations; he goes on to consider the number of permutations of the letters of the alphabet and of horses from a stable of 20.{{sfn|Stedman|1677|pp=13—18}}

A first case in which seemingly unrelated mathematical questions were studied with the help of permutations occurred around 1770, when [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], in the study of polynomial equations, observed that properties of the permutations of the [[Polynomial#Solving polynomial equations|roots]] of an equation are related to the possibilities to solve it. This line of work ultimately resulted, through the work of [[Évariste Galois]], in [[Galois theory]], which gives a complete description of what is possible and impossible with respect to solving polynomial equations (in one unknown) by radicals. In modern mathematics, there are many similar situations in which understanding a problem requires studying certain permutations related to it.

==Definition==

In mathematics texts it is customary to denote permutations using lowercase Greek letters. Commonly, either &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\sigma, \tau&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; are used.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheinerman&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Scheinerman |first1=Edward A. |date=March 5, 2012 |chapter=Chapter 5: Functions |title=Mathematics: A Discrete Introduction |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DZBHGD2sEYwC&amp;pg=PA188 |url-status=live |edition=3rd |publisher=Cengage Learning |page=188 |isbn=978-0840049421 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200205212843/https://books.google.com/books?id=DZBHGD2sEYwC&amp;pg=PA188 |archive-date=February 5, 2020 |access-date=February 5, 2020 |quote=It is customary to use lowercase Greek letters (especially π, σ, and τ) to stand for permutations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Permutations can be defined as bijections from a set {{math|''S''}} onto itself. All permutations of a set with ''n'' elements form a [[symmetric group]], denoted &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;, where the [[group operation]] is [[Composition of functions|function composition]]. Thus for two permutations, &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; in the group &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;, the four group axioms hold: 

# [[Closure (mathematics)|Closure]]: If &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; are in &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; then so is &lt;math&gt;\pi\sigma.&lt;/math&gt; 
# [[Associativity]]: For any three permutations &lt;math&gt;\pi, \sigma, \tau \in S_n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(\pi\sigma)\tau = \pi(\sigma\tau).&lt;/math&gt;
# [[Identity element|Identity]]: There is an identity permutation, denoted &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{id}&lt;/math&gt; and defined by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{id}(x) = x&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in S&lt;/math&gt;. For any &lt;math&gt;\sigma \in S_n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{id} \sigma = \sigma \operatorname{id} = \sigma.&lt;/math&gt;
# [[Inverse element|Invertibility]]: For every permutation &lt;math&gt;\pi \in S_n&lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math&gt;\pi^{-1} \in S_n&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;\pi\pi^{-1} = \pi^{-1}\pi = \operatorname{id}.&lt;/math&gt;
In general, composition of two permutations is not [[commutative]], that is, &lt;math&gt;\pi\sigma \neq \sigma\pi.&lt;/math&gt;

As a bijection from a set to itself, a permutation is a function that ''performs'' a rearrangement of a set, and is not a rearrangement itself. An older and more elementary viewpoint is that permutations are the rearrangements themselves. To distinguish between these two, the identifiers ''active'' and ''passive'' are sometimes prefixed to the term ''permutation'', whereas in older terminology ''substitutions'' and ''permutations'' are used.{{sfn|Cameron|1994|loc=p. 29, footnote 3}}

A permutation can be decomposed into one or more disjoint ''cycles'', that is, the [[Orbit (group theory)|orbits]], which are found by repeatedly tracing the application of the permutation on some elements. For example, the permutation &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;\sigma(7) = 7&lt;/math&gt; has a 1-cycle, &lt;math&gt;(\,7\,)&lt;/math&gt; while the permutation &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;\pi(2) = 3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi(3) = 2&lt;/math&gt; has a 2-cycle &lt;math&gt;(\,2\,3\,)&lt;/math&gt; (for details on the syntax, see {{Section link||Cycle notation}} below). In general, a cycle of length ''k'', that is, consisting of ''k'' elements, is called a ''k''-cycle.

An element in a 1-cycle &lt;math&gt;(\,x\,)&lt;/math&gt; is called a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of the permutation. A permutation with no fixed points is called a [[derangement]]. 2-cycles are called [[transposition (mathematics)|transpositions]]; such permutations merely exchange two elements, leaving the others fixed.

==Notations==
{{anchor|Two-line notation}} Since writing permutations elementwise, that is, as [[piecewise]] functions, is cumbersome, several notations have been invented to represent them more compactly. ''Cycle notation'' is a popular choice for many mathematicians due to its compactness and the fact that it makes a permutation's structure transparent. It is the notation used in this article unless otherwise specified, but other notations are still widely used, especially in application areas. 

===Two-line notation===
In [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]]'s ''two-line notation'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Genesis of the Abstract Group Concept: A Contribution to the History of the Origin of Abstract Group Theory|first=Hans|last=Wussing|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=2007|isbn=9780486458687|page=94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xp3JymnfAq4C&amp;pg=PA94|quote=Cauchy used his permutation notation—in which the arrangements are written one below the other and both are enclosed in parentheses—for the first time in 1815.}}&lt;/ref&gt; one lists the elements of ''S'' in the first row, and for each one its image below it in the second row. For instance, a particular permutation of the set ''S'' = {1,2,3,4,5} can be written as:
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \begin{pmatrix}
  1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 \\
  2 &amp; 5 &amp; 4 &amp; 3 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix};&lt;/math&gt;
this means that ''σ'' satisfies {{nowrap|''σ''(1) {{=}} 2}}, {{nowrap|''σ''(2) {{=}} 5}}, {{nowrap|''σ''(3) {{=}} 4}}, {{nowrap|''σ''(4) {{=}} 3}}, and {{nowrap|''σ''(5) {{=}} 1}}. The elements of ''S'' may appear in any order in the first row. This permutation could also be written as:
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \begin{pmatrix}
  3 &amp; 2 &amp; 5 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 \\
  4 &amp; 5 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3
\end{pmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;
or
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \begin{pmatrix}
  5 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 \\
  1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5
\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

===One-line notation===
If there is a &quot;natural&quot; order for the elements of ''S'',{{efn|The order is often implicitly understood. A set of integers is naturally written from smallest to largest; a set of letters is written in lexicographic order. For other sets, a natural order needs to be specified explicitly.}} say &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n&lt;/math&gt;, then one uses this for the first row of the two-line notation:
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \begin{pmatrix}
  x_1         &amp; x_2         &amp; x_3         &amp; \cdots &amp; x_n \\
  \sigma(x_1) &amp; \sigma(x_2) &amp; \sigma(x_3) &amp; \cdots &amp; \sigma(x_n)
\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Under this assumption, one may omit the first row and write the permutation in ''one-line notation'' as
: &lt;math&gt;(\sigma(x_1) \; \sigma(x_2) \; \sigma(x_3) \; \cdots \; \sigma(x_n) )&lt;/math&gt;,
that is, an ordered arrangement of S.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bogart|1990|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gerstein|1987|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Care must be taken to distinguish one-line notation from the [[#Cycle notation|cycle notation]] described below. In mathematics literature, a common usage is to omit parentheses for one-line notation, while using them for cycle notation. The one-line notation is also called the ''[[Word (mathematics)|word]] representation'' of a permutation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aigner2007&quot;/&gt; The example above would then be 2 5 4 3 1 since the natural order 1 2 3 4 5 would be assumed for the first row. (It is typical to use commas to separate these entries only if some have two or more digits.) This form is more compact, and is common in elementary [[combinatorics]] and [[computer science]]. It is especially useful in applications where the elements of ''S'' or the permutations are to be compared as larger or smaller.

===Cycle notation===
Cycle notation describes the effect of repeatedly applying the permutation on the elements of the set. It expresses the permutation as a product of [[cyclic permutation|cycles]]; since distinct cycles are [[disjoint sets|disjoint]], this is referred to as &quot;decomposition into disjoint cycles&quot;.{{efn|Due to the likely possibility of confusion, cycle notation is not used in conjunction with one-line notation (sequences) for permutations.}}

To write down the permutation &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; in cycle notation, one proceeds as follows:

# Write an opening bracket then select an arbitrary element ''x'' of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and write it down: &lt;math&gt;(\,x&lt;/math&gt;
# Then trace the orbit of ''x''; that is, write down its values under successive applications of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;(\,x\,\sigma(x)\,\sigma(\sigma(x))\,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;
# Repeat until the value returns to ''x'' and write down a closing parenthesis rather than ''x'': &lt;math&gt;(\,x\,\sigma(x)\,\sigma(\sigma(x))\,\ldots\,)&lt;/math&gt;
# Now continue with an element ''y'' of ''S'', not yet written down, and proceed in the same way: &lt;math&gt;(\,x\,\sigma(x)\,\sigma(\sigma(x))\,\ldots\,)(\,y\,\ldots\,)&lt;/math&gt;
# Repeat until all elements of ''S'' are written in cycles.

Since for every new cycle the starting point can be chosen in different ways, there are in general many different cycle notations for the same permutation; for the example above one has:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 \\
2 &amp; 5 &amp; 4 &amp; 3 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix}= (\,1 \, 2 \, 5\,) (\,3\,4\,) = (\,3 \, 4\,) (\,1 \, 2 \, 5\,) = (\,3 \, 4\,) (\,5 \, 1 \, 2\,).&lt;/math&gt;

1-cycles are often omitted from the cycle notation, provided that the context is clear; for any element ''x'' in ''S'' not appearing in any cycle, one implicitly assumes &lt;math&gt;\sigma(x) = x&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1959|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[identity permutation]], which consists only of 1-cycles, can be denoted by a single 1-cycle (x), by the number 1,{{efn|1 is frequently used to represent the [[identity element]] in a non-commutative group}} or by ''id''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rotman|2002|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bogart|1990|p=487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A convenient feature of cycle notation is that one can find a permutation's inverse simply by reversing the order of the elements in the permutation's cycles. For example
: &lt;math&gt;[(\,1\,2\,5\,)(\,3\,4\,)]^{-1} = (\,5\,2\,1\,)(\,4\,3\,)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Canonical cycle notation ({{aka}} standard form) ===
In some combinatorial contexts it is useful to fix a certain order for the elements in the cycles and of the (disjoint) cycles themselves. [[Miklós Bóna]] calls the following ordering choices the ''canonical cycle notation'':
* in each cycle the ''largest'' element is listed first
* the cycles are sorted in ''increasing'' order of their first element

For example, (312)(54)(8)(976) is a permutation in canonical cycle notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bona|2012|loc=p.87}} [Note that the book has a typo/error here, as it gives (45) instead of (54).]&lt;/ref&gt; The canonical cycle notation does not omit one-cycles.

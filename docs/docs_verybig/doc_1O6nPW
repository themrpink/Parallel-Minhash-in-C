[[File:Ra and dec demo animation small.gif|right|350px|thumb|The '''equatorial coordinate system''' using [[spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]]. The [[fundamental plane (spherical coordinates)|fundamental plane]] is formed by [[projective geometry|projection]] of [[Earth]]'s [[equator]] onto the [[celestial sphere]], forming the {{colorbox|lightblue}}{{nbsp}}[[celestial equator]]. The primary direction is established by projecting [[Earth's orbit]] onto the [[celestial sphere]], forming the {{colorbox|red}}{{nbsp}}[[ecliptic]], and setting up the [[ascending node]] of the ecliptic on the celestial equator, forming the vernal [[equinox]]. [[Right ascension]] is measured eastward along the celestial equator from the equinox, and [[declination]] is measured positive northward from the celestial equator. (Two such coordinate pairs are shown here.) Projections of the Earth's north and south [[geographic pole]]s form the north and south [[celestial pole]]s, respectively.]]

The '''equatorial coordinate system''' is a [[celestial coordinate system]] widely used to specify the positions of [[astronomical object|celestial objects]]. It may be implemented in [[spherical coordinate system|spherical]] or [[Cartesian coordinate system|rectangular]] coordinates, both defined by an [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] at the centre of [[Earth]], a [[fundamental plane (spherical coordinates)|fundamental plane]] consisting of the [[projective geometry|projection]] of Earth's [[equator]] onto the [[celestial sphere]] (forming the [[celestial equator]]), a primary direction towards the vernal [[equinox (celestial coordinates)|equinox]], and a [[right-hand rule|right-handed]] convention.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental plane and the primary direction mean that the coordinate system, while aligned with Earth's [[equator]] and [[geographic pole|pole]], does not rotate with the Earth, but remains relatively fixed against the background [[fixed stars|stars]]. A right-handed convention means that coordinates increase northward from and eastward around the fundamental plane.

== Primary direction ==
{{See also|Axial precession|Astronomical nutation}}

This description of the [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]] of the reference frame is somewhat simplified; the orientation is not quite fixed. A slow motion of Earth's axis, [[Axial precession|precession]], causes a slow, continuous turning of the coordinate system westward about the poles of the [[ecliptic]], completing one circuit in about 26,000 years. Superimposed on this is a smaller motion of the ecliptic, and a small oscillation of the Earth's axis, [[astronomical nutation|nutation]].&lt;ref&gt;''Explanatory Supplement'' (1961), pp. 20, 28&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to fix the exact primary direction, these motions necessitate the specification of the [[equinox]] of a particular date, known as an [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]], when giving a position. The three most commonly used are:
; Mean equinox of a standard epoch (usually [[Epoch (astronomy)|J2000.0]], but may include B1950.0, B1900.0, etc.): is a fixed standard direction, allowing positions established at various dates to be compared directly.
; Mean equinox of date: is the intersection of the ecliptic of &quot;date&quot; (that is, the ecliptic in its position at &quot;date&quot;) with the ''mean'' equator (that is, the equator rotated by precession to its position at &quot;date&quot;, but free from the small periodic oscillations of nutation). Commonly used in planetary [[orbit]] calculation.
; True equinox of date: is the intersection of the ecliptic of &quot;date&quot; with the ''true'' equator (that is, the mean equator plus nutation). This is the actual intersection of the two planes at any particular moment, with all motions accounted for.

A position in the equatorial coordinate system is thus typically specified ''true equinox and equator of date'', ''mean equinox and equator of J2000.0'', or similar. Note that there is no &quot;mean ecliptic&quot;, as the ecliptic is not subject to small periodic oscillations.&lt;ref&gt;

== Spherical coordinates ==

=== Use in astronomy ===
A [[star]]'s spherical coordinates are often expressed as a pair, [[right ascension]] and [[declination]], without a [[distance]] coordinate. The direction of sufficiently distant objects is the same for all observers, and it is convenient to specify this direction with the same coordinates for all. In contrast, in the [[horizontal coordinate system]], a star's position differs from observer to observer based on their positions on the Earth's surface, and is continuously changing with the Earth's rotation.

[[Telescope]]s equipped with [[equatorial mount]]s and [[setting circles]] employ the equatorial coordinate system to find objects. Setting circles in conjunction with a [[star chart]] or [[ephemeris]] allow the telescope to be easily pointed at known objects on the celestial sphere.

===Declination===
{{Main|Declination}}
The declination symbol {{math|''δ''}}, (lower case &quot;delta&quot;, abbreviated DEC) measures the angular distance of an object perpendicular to the celestial equator, positive to the north, negative to the south. For example, the north celestial pole has a declination of +90°. The origin for declination is the celestial equator, which is the projection of the Earth's equator onto the celestial sphere.  Declination is analogous to terrestrial [[latitude]].&lt;ref name=&quot;calculator28&quot;&gt;

===Right ascension===
[[File:Hour angle still1.png|thumb|right|300px|As seen from above the [[Earth]]'s [[geographic pole|north pole]], a star's {{colorbox|cyan}}{{nbsp}}[[hour angle|local hour angle]] (LHA) for an {{colorbox|red}}{{nbsp}}observer near New York.

The symbol ʏ identifies the [[equinox|vernal equinox]] direction.]]

{{Main|Right ascension}}
The right ascension symbol {{math|''α''}}, (lower case &quot;alpha&quot;, abbreviated RA) measures the angular distance of an object eastward along the [[celestial equator]] from the vernal [[equinox]] to the [[hour circle]] passing through the object. The vernal equinox point is one of the two where the [[ecliptic]] intersects the celestial equator. Analogous to terrestrial [[longitude]], right ascension is usually measured in [[sidereal time|sidereal]] hours, minutes and seconds instead of degrees, a result of the method of measuring right ascensions by [[Meridian circle|timing the passage of objects across the meridian]] as the [[Earth's rotation|Earth rotates]]. There are {{sfrac|360°|24&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;}} = 15° in one hour of right ascension, and 24&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt; of right ascension around the entire [[celestial equator]].&lt;ref name=&quot;calculator28&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
''Astronomical Almanac 2010'', p. M14
&lt;/ref&gt;

When used together, right ascension and declination are usually abbreviated RA/Dec.

===Hour angle===
{{Main|Hour angle}}

Alternatively to [[right ascension]], [[hour angle]] (abbreviated HA or LHA, ''local hour angle''), a left-handed system, measures the angular distance of an object westward along the [[celestial equator]] from the observer's [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]] to the [[hour circle]] passing through the object. Unlike right ascension, hour angle is always increasing with the [[rotation of Earth]]. Hour angle may be considered a means of measuring the time since upper [[culmination]], the moment when an object contacts the meridian overhead.

A culminating star on the observer's meridian is said to have a zero hour angle (0&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;). One [[sidereal time|sidereal hour]] (approximately 0.9973 [[solar time|solar hours]]) later, Earth's rotation will carry the star to the west of the meridian, and its hour angle will be 1&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;. When calculating [[horizontal coordinate system|topocentric]] phenomena, right ascension may be converted into hour angle as an intermediate step.&lt;ref&gt;

== Rectangular coordinates ==

===Geocentric equatorial coordinates===

[[File:Ra and dec rectangular.png|thumb|300px|Geocentric equatorial coordinates. The [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] is the centre of the [[Earth]]. The fundamental [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] is the plane of the Earth's equator. The primary direction (the {{math|''x''}} axis) is the vernal [[equinox]]. A [[right-handed]] convention specifies a {{math|''y''}} axis 90° to the east in the fundamental plane; the {{math|''z''}} axis is the north polar axis. The reference frame does not rotate with the Earth, rather, the Earth rotates around the {{math|''z''}} axis.]]

There are a number of [[Cartesian coordinate system|rectangular]] variants of equatorial coordinates. All have:
* The [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] at the centre of the [[Earth]].
* The fundamental [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] in the plane of the Earth's equator.
* The primary direction (the {{math|''x''}} axis) toward the vernal [[equinox]], that is, the place where the [[Sun]] crosses the [[celestial equator]] in a northward direction in its annual apparent circuit around the [[ecliptic]].
* A [[right-handed]] convention, specifying a {{math|''y''}} axis 90° to the east in the fundamental plane and a {{math|''z''}} axis along the north polar axis.

The reference frames do not rotate with the Earth (in contrast to [[ECEF|Earth-centred, Earth-fixed]] frames), remaining always directed toward the [[equinox]], and drifting over time with the motions of [[axial precession|precession]] and [[astronomical nutation|nutation]].
* In [[astronomy]]:&lt;ref&gt;
''Explanatory Supplement'' (1961), pp. 24–26
&lt;/ref&gt;
** The [[position of the Sun]] is often specified in the geocentric equatorial rectangular coordinates {{math|''X''}}, {{math|''Y''}}, {{math|''Z''}} and a fourth distance coordinate, {{math|''R''}} {{math|({{=}} {{radical|''X''{{isup|2}} + ''Y''{{isup|2}} + ''Z''{{isup|2}}}})}}, in units of the [[astronomical unit]].
** The positions of the [[planets]] and other [[Solar System]] bodies are often specified in the geocentric equatorial rectangular coordinates {{math|''ξ''}}, {{math|''η''}}, {{math|''ζ''}} and a fourth distance coordinate, {{math|''δ''}} (equal to {{math|{{radical|''ξ''{{isup|2}} + ''η''{{isup|2}} + ''ζ''{{isup|2}}}}}}), in units of the [[astronomical unit]].{{paragraph}}These rectangular coordinates are related to the corresponding spherical coordinates by
**: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{X}{R} = \frac{\xi}{\mathit{\Delta}} &amp;= \cos \delta \cos \alpha \\
\frac{Y}{R} = \frac{\eta}{\mathit{\Delta}} &amp;= \cos \delta \sin \alpha \\
\frac{Z}{R} = \frac{\zeta}{\mathit{\Delta}} &amp;= \sin \delta
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
* In [[astrodynamics]]:&lt;ref&gt;
Vallado (2001), pp. 157, 158
&lt;/ref&gt;
** The positions of artificial Earth [[satellite]]s are specified in ''geocentric equatorial'' coordinates, also known as ''geocentric equatorial inertial (GEI)'', ''[[Earth-centred inertial]] (ECI)'', and ''conventional inertial system (CIS)'', all of which are equivalent in definition to the astronomical geocentric equatorial rectangular frames, above. In the geocentric equatorial frame, the {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''z''}} axes are often designated {{math|''I''}}, {{math|''J''}} and {{math|''K''}}, respectively, or the frame's [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] is specified by the [[unit vector]]s {{math|''Î''}}, {{math|''Ĵ''}} and {{math|''K̂''}}.
** The ''Geocentric Celestial Reference Frame (GCRF)'' is the geocentric equivalent of the [[International Celestial Reference Frame]] (ICRF). Its primary direction is the [[equinox]] of [[Epoch (astronomy)|J2000.0]], and does not move with [[Axial precession|precession]] and [[astronomical nutation|nutation]], but it is otherwise equivalent to the above systems.

===Heliocentric equatorial coordinates===

In [[astronomy]], there is also a heliocentric [[Cartesian coordinate system|rectangular]] variant of equatorial coordinates, designated {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}}, {{math|''z''}}, which has:

*The [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] at the centre of the [[Sun]].
*The fundamental [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] in the plane of the Earth's equator.
*The primary direction (the {{math|''x''}} axis) toward the vernal [[equinox]].
*A [[right-handed]] convention, specifying a {{math|''y''}} axis 90° to the east in the fundamental plane and a {{math|''z''}} axis along [[Earth]]'s north polar axis.

This frame is in every way equivalent to the {{math|''ξ''}}, {{math|''η''}}, {{math|''ζ''}} frame, above, except that the origin is removed to the centre of the [[Sun]]. It is commonly used in planetary orbit calculation. The three astronomical rectangular coordinate systems are related by&lt;ref&gt;''Explanatory Supplement'' (1961), pp.&amp;nbsp;20, 27&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    \xi &amp;= x + X \\
   \eta &amp;= y + Y \\
  \zeta &amp;= z + Z
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Azimuth]] is measured [[east]]ward from the [[true north|north]] point (sometimes from the [[south]] point) of the [[horizon]]; altitude is the angle above the horizon.]]

The '''horizontal coordinate system''', also known as '''topocentric coordinate system''', is a [[celestial coordinate system]] that uses the observer's local [[horizon]] as the [[Fundamental plane (spherical coordinates)|fundamental plane]]. Coordinates of an object in the sky are expressed in terms of [[altitude]] (or elevation) angle and [[azimuth]].

==Definition==
This [[celestial coordinate system]] divides the [[sky]] into two [[Sphere#Hemisphere|hemispheres]]: the upper hemisphere, where objects above the [[horizon]] are visible, and the lower hemisphere, where objects below the horizon cannot be seen, since the Earth obstructs views of them. The [[great circle]] separating the hemispheres is called the '''celestial horizon''', which is defined as the great circle on the celestial sphere whose plane is normal to the local gravity vector.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clarke2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clarke |first1=A.E.

I.

The pole of the lower hemisphere is called the [[nadir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ast121/lectures/lec03.html |title=Earth Coordinate System |last=Schombert |first=James |publisher=[[University of Oregon]] Department of Physics |access-date=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are two independent horizontal [[angular coordinate]]s:
* Altitude (alt.), sometimes referred to as elevation (el.), is the angle between the object and the observer's local horizon. For visible objects, it is an angle between 0° and 90°.
** Alternatively, [[zenith]] distance may be used instead of altitude. The zenith distance is the [[complementary angles|complement]] of altitude, so that the sum of the altitude and the zenith distance is 90°.
* [[Azimuth]] (az.) is the angle of the object around the horizon, usually measured from [[true north]] and increasing eastward. Exceptions are, for example, [[European Southern Observatory|ESO]]'s [[FITS]] convention where it is measured from the south and increasing westward, or the [[FITS]] convention of the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] where it is measured from the south and increasing eastward.

The horizontal coordinate system is sometimes called other names, such as the '''az/el system''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/KSDs/40/html/ksd40-55.4.html hawaii.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; the '''alt/az system''', or the '''alt-azimuth system''', from the name of [[altazimuth mount|the mount]] used for [[telescope]]s, whose two axes follow altitude and azimuth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/271741/horizon-system |title=horizon system |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General observations==

The horizontal coordinate system is fixed to a location on Earth, not the stars. Therefore, the altitude and azimuth of an object in the sky changes with time, as the object appears to drift across the sky with [[Earth's rotation]]. In addition, since the horizontal system is defined by the observer's local horizon, the same object viewed from different locations on Earth at the same time will have different values of altitude and azimuth.

The [[Cardinal direction|cardinal points]] on the horizon have specific values of azimuth that are helpful references.

Horizontal coordinates are very useful for determining the rise and set times of an object in the sky. When an object's altitude is 0°, it is on the horizon. If at that moment its altitude is increasing, it is rising, but if its altitude is decreasing, it is setting. However, all objects on the [[celestial sphere]] are subject to [[diurnal motion]], which always appears to be westward.

A northern observer can determine whether altitude is increasing or decreasing by instead considering the azimuth of the celestial object:
*If the azimuth is between 0° and 180° (north–east–south), the object is rising.
*If the azimuth is between 180° and 360° (south–west–north), the object is setting.

There are the following special cases:
*All directions are south when viewed from the [[North Pole]], and all directions are north when viewed from the [[South Pole]], so the azimuth is undefined in both locations. When viewed from either pole, a star (or any object with fixed [[equatorial coordinates]]) has constant altitude and thus [[circumpolar star|never rises or sets]]. The [[Sun]], [[Moon]], and [[planets]] can rise or set over the span of a year when viewed from the poles because their [[declination]]s are constantly changing.
*When viewed from the [[Equator]], objects on the celestial poles stay at fixed points on the horizon.

Note that the above considerations are strictly speaking true for the ''geometric'' horizon only. That is, the horizon as it would appear for an observer at sea level on a perfectly smooth Earth without an atmosphere. In practice, the ''apparent'' horizon has a slight negative altitude due to the curvature of Earth, the value of which gets more negative as the observer ascends higher above [[sea level]]. In addition, [[atmospheric refraction]] causes celestial objects very close to the horizon to appear about half a degree [[looming and similar refraction phenomena|higher]] than they would if there were no atmosphere.

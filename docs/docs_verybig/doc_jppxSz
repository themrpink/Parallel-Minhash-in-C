In addition to chain convenience stores, there are also many independently owned convenience stores in Canada.

Convenience stores are also commonly referred to as &quot;corner stores&quot;, &quot;mini-marts&quot;, or &quot;variety stores&quot; in some regions of Canada. In the French-speaking province of [[Quebec]], a convenience store is known as a &quot;dépanneur&quot;, or &quot;dep&quot; for short, even among some when speaking in English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arts.mcgill.ca/programs/linguistics/faculty/boberg/Articles/n_american_survey/N_American_Survey.htm Faculty: Charles Boberg | Linguistics - McGill University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318221057/http://www.arts.mcgill.ca/programs/linguistics/faculty/boberg/Articles/n_american_survey/N_American_Survey.htm |date=March 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Dépanneur&quot; translates as 'troubleshooter'.

===Chile===
Chilean convenience stores are typically found at gas-stations in most urban and near-urban areas on highways. Examples of these are Punto/Pronto (owned by [[Copec]]), Spacio 1 ([[Petrobras]], formerly called Tigermarket and On The Run before [[Esso]] Chile was owned by Petrobras), Va y Ven ([[Terpel]]), Upa!, Upita!, and Select (from [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]]).

Other brands operating mostly in city-centers and middle-to-upperscale neighborhoods are Ok! Market (owned by [[Unimarc]]), Big John and [[Oxxo]] (owned by [[FEMSA]]), and some small-scale &quot;minisupermercados&quot; akin to [[mom and pop stores]]

===Costa Rica===

{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
In Costa Rica, family-owned and operated convenience stores called ''[[wikt:pulpería|pulperías]]'' have been common since the 1900s and there are many of those stores in every neighbourhood.

In the 2010s, modern convenience stores were introduced, mainly by the AMPM company. Competitors launched brands such as Musmanni Mini Super (a chain of bakery stores promoted to convenience stores), Vindi (operated by AutoMercado supermarket company), and Fresh Market (operated by AMPM in a format appealing to prosperous neighborhoods).

===Finland===
In Finland, convenience stores are referred as kiosks except for those found inside service stations which are referred to simply as stores. The biggest convenience store chain is [[R-Kioski]] that has over 560 kiosks across the country which all are franchise licensed businesses. There are some independent convenience stores that use the word Kymppi or number 10 in their business name, which is remnants of a former large convenicence store chain that was called 10-kioski, which vanished around the early 2000s. Kymppi is a spoken colloquial word for number 10 (&quot;kymmenen&quot;) in Finnish. Smaller towns often have independent kiosks as an R-Kioski franchise store needs a decent customer volume to be profitable.
Convenience stores at service stations are either run by the station's parent oil company such as [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] or by either of the two major retail corporations in Finland: [[Kesko]] or [[S Group]]. Virtually all manned service stations have even a small convenience store.

===France===
In France, some convenience shops are referred to as &quot;{{Interlanguage link multi|Arabe du coin|fr|3=Arabe du coin|vertical-align=sup}}&quot; - &quot;Arab on the corner&quot;, due to many Arabic immigrants who work in this sector of the economy. These shops often stay open later than the &quot;épiceries&quot; or groceries. Shop owners consider the name pejorative, especially those not from countries in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/18/lets-banish-the-term-arab-world-what-does-it-mean-anyway&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
[[File:TanteEmmaBamberg.JPG|thumb|right|A Tante-Emma-Laden]]
A corner shop in Germany is known as a '{{ill|Tante-Emma-Laden|de|vertical-align=sup}}' (Aunt Emma Shop). In recent years, such shops are returning to city centres, although they are increasingly run by large [[retail chain]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsv1.orf.at/070830-16044/index.html|title=Neuer Trend|website=newsv1.orf.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fründt, Steffen.

Retrieved on 23 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in Berlin, the term &quot;[[Spätkauf]]&quot; or &quot;Späti&quot; is used, particularly to refer to shops with late opening times.

Due to German federal law, filling stations are the most suitable sales points to establish convenience stores nationwide. Therefore, gas station operator group Aral settled a partnership agreement with one of the biggest German retailers, REWE Group, to integrate REWE TO GO shops into five out of six German Aral filling stations until 2021. Usually, these shops offer 24/7 services and sell about 1,200 different products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Relevant Success Factors for the Implementation of Convenience Stores in Germany and their Development in the German Market|last=Gumbart|first=Matthias|publisher=GRIN Verlag|year=2018|isbn=9783668666290|location=Munich|pages=76, 77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
In India, &quot;mom-and-pop&quot; convenience stores are called '''''kirana''''' stores and constitute part of the traditional food retail system.&lt;ref name=&quot;MRS-Delhi&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Minten |first1=Bart |last2=Reardon |first2=Thomas |last3=Sutradhar |first3=Rajib |year=2010 |title=Food Prices and Modern Retail: The Case of Delhi |journal=World Development |language=en |volume=38 |issue=12 |pages=1775–1787 |doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2010.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirana are typically family-owned stores that operate in fixed locations and carry both basic food and non-food items.&lt;ref name=&quot;MRS-Delhi&quot;/&gt;

===Indonesia===
[[File:Alfamart Ancol Jakarta.jpg|thumb|An [[Alfamart]] (with ''Alfaexpress'' brand) convenience store in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]].]]
Convenience stores or &quot;Mini market&quot; (in Indonesian) are mostly scattered around the towns. Due to local government restrictions and rules in Indonesia, usually convenience stores may only be built at least 500 meters from the nearest traditional market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jateng.tribunnews.com/2014/10/05/jarak-minimarket-modern-dengan-pasar-tradisional-minimal-500-meter|title=Jarak Minimarket Modern dengan Pasar Tradisional Minimal 500 Meter|website=Tribun Jateng|access-date=2017-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows traditional market to keep selling local goods, while greatly lowers the opportunities for profit by those who seek to build/own a convenience store by reducing the eligibility of property to be developed into a convenience store. This is especially true in small cities and rural areas. As a result, convenience stores in rural areas are often built side by side, or at maximum within 50 meters of each other.

Local convenience store brands are [[Indomaret]] and [[Alfamart]]. Both targeting all public, where imported brands like [[7-Eleven]], [[Circle K]] or [[Lawson (store)|Lawson]] are targeting big cities and cater to a lifestyle more than &quot;convenience&quot;. To be classified as a convenience store, the store should occupy no more than 100 square meters of service area, on in some local residence, the limit is 250 square meters.

The Indonesian government restricts convenience store licenses, so it can only be bought by franchisees, using a different name and different brand, or classifying it as [[cafeteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.etalasebisnis.com/investasi/1392/ini-persyaratan-waralaba-alfamart-franchise.html|title=Ini Persyaratan Waralaba Alfamart (Alfamart Franchise)|last=PRODUCTION|first=VIMEDIA|date=2015-12-07|newspaper=EtalaseBisnis.com|access-date=2017-02-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A convenience store with a cafeteria license is only allowed to sell a maximum 10% of its service space for non food/beverages product. This type of convenience store often puts some lawn chairs and desk as a decoy in front of their stores, while offering the same range of products as a holder of a mini market license.

===Japan===
[[Image:Lawson Haramachikitahara Shop.jpg|thumb|left|A Lawson convenience store in [[Minamisoma, Fukushima]]]]
{{Nihongo|Convenience stores|コンビニエンスストア|konbiniensu sutoa}}, often shortened to {{Nihongo||コンビニ|'''konbini'''}}, developed tremendously in [[Japan]]. [[7-Eleven]] Japan, while struggling to localize their service in the 1970s to 1980s, evolved its [[point of sale]]-based business, until ultimately, [[Seven &amp; I Holdings Co.]], the parent company of 7-Eleven Japan, acquired 7-Eleven (US) from [[Southland Corporation]] in 1991. Japanese-style convenience stores also heavily influenced those stores in other [[Asia]]n regions or countries, such as [[Mainland China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]], and [[South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdfworld.com/top10/165/Top-Ten-Convenience-Stores-Around-the-World|title=Top Ten Convenience Stores Around the World}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Convenience stores rely heavily on the point of sale. Customers' ages and gender, as well as tomorrow's weather forecast, are important data. Stores place all orders on-line. As the store floor sizes are limited, they have to be very careful in choosing what brands to sell. In many cases, several stores from the same chain do business in neighboring areas. This strategy makes distribution to each store cheaper, as well as making multiple deliveries per day possible. Generally, food goods are delivered to each store two to five times a day from factories. Since products are delivered as needed, stores do not need large stock areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web-japan.org/nipponia/nipponia19/en/feature/feature01.html|title=NIPPONIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to The Japan Franchise Association, {{as of|lc=yes|August 2009}} (data pertaining to the month of July 2009), there are 42,345 convenience stores in Japan. 7-Eleven leads the market with 12,467 stores, followed by [[Lawson (store)|Lawson]] (9,562) and [[FamilyMart]] (7,604). Other operators include [[Circle K Sunkus]] (acquired by Family Mart in 2016; now defunct), [[Daily Yamazaki]], [[Ministop]], [[Ampm|Am/Pm Japan]] (acquired by Family Mart in 2009; now defunct), [[Poplar (convenience store)|Poplar]], Coco Store and Seico Mart. Many items available in larger supermarkets can be found in Japanese convenience stores, though the selection is usually smaller. As well, the following additional services are also commonly available:
* [[Courier]] and [[mail|postal service]].
* [[Photocopying]] and [[fax]] service.
* [[Automated teller machine]]s.
* Payment service for utilities and other bills and taxes.
* Ticket service for [[concert]]s, [[amusement park|theme parks]], [[airlines]] etc.
* Pre-paid cards for [[cellular phones]].

Some stores also sell charging service for [[electronic money]] and ATM services for [[credit card]] or [[consumer finance]]. Items not commonly sold include [[Slurpee]]s, [[lottery]] tickets, [[car]] supplies, and [[gasoline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://japan-magazine.jnto.go.jp/en/1301_cvs.html|title=Complete guide to Japanese convenience stores - JAPAN Monthly Web Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Konbini also offer customers the option of making '''konbini payments''' (often also referred to as just '''konbini'''), an offline payment solution that allows customers without credit or debit cards to make online purchases. A consumer can buy online services or goods, such as video games on [[Steam (service)|Steam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/1/616189742840853266|title=Steam Community - buy games in Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt; or tickets for events. By selecting konbini as payment method at the checkout, the consumer will receive a unique transaction code with an expiry date. Depending on the brand (i.e. 7-11 is slightly different than Family Mart), consumers will have to go to any convenience store and finalize the purchase, which can be either at the cashier or at the kiosk. Multiple providers offer konbini as checkout option for foreign companies selling online in Japan, such as [[Adyen]], Degica, and [[Ingenico]] ePayments.

In 1974, Japan had 1,000 convenience stores. In 1996, Japan had 47,000 convenience stores, and the number was increasing by 1,500 annually. Peter Landers of the ''[[Associated Press]]'' said that the computerized distribution system allows Japanese convenience stores to stock a wider variety of products, allowing them to be more competitive in the marketplace. Because of this technology and the consequent ease of maintaining the right amount of stock, Japan can support one convenience store for every 2,000 people, while in the United States it is one per 8,000 people. Another contributing factor to the widespread proliferation of convenience stores is that, because Japan has a lower crime rate, store owners are not reluctant to keep stores open at late hours in the night, and customers are not reluctant to shop during those times.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landersp&quot;&gt;Landers, Peter. &quot;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O5c_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CFYMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5174,5376452&amp;dq=wawa+pennsylvania+institution&amp;hl=en Japan has a high-tech take on the convenience store]&quot;.

Convenience stores are very popular among Malaysians, especially urban dwellers in Kuala Lumpur or other populated towns like Penang where the population density is higher. Its 24/7 policy allows Malaysians to have easy access to necessities or as an alternative hang out area especially since Malaysians love to go out for midnight supper at mamaks and eateries that also open till late at night, as more and more Malaysians are beginning to work or go out late. The availability of fresh hot food or cold premade food is also popular among young workers who don't have much time to prepare food for themselves, as many are beginning to have irregular work hours especially in the city. It also eases the burden of families. Many Malaysians also enjoy the seasonal food that these stores provide. These stores can be found almost anywhere especially in areas with a higher population density such city centre, condominium, apartment complexes, office areas, residential areas, shop lots, petrol stations, although the store density is as high as Taiwan or Japan.

Items sold at such convenience shops usually range from pre-made local food like nasi lemak, onigiri, buns, snacks, toiletries, drinks, a limited amount of alcohol, newspapers, magazines, slushies, cup noodles, ice creams, hot food, oden, game reload and mobile top up cards. Some also have the service of reloading Touch N' Go cards or have ATMs. Most of them have a microwave oven and hot water boiler to heat up food. Some have seasonal and limited food, desserts or have special imported products and items like FamilyMart importing strawberry Coca-Cola from Japan.

Malaysia also has sundry shops that sell daily items and perishable at a lower price but unlike convenience shops, they aren't open 24/7. Some of these sundry shops also sell traditional herbs and ingredients.

[[Oxxo]] is the largest chain in the country, with more than 15,000 stores around the country. Other convenience stores, such as [[Tiendas Extra]], [[7-Eleven]], [[SuperCity]], [[ampm]] and [[Circle K]], are also found in Mexico. The first convenience store in the country, Super 7 (now a 7-Eleven), was opened in 1976 in [[Monterrey]], [[Nuevo León]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} There are also some regional chains, like [[Amigo Express]] and [[CB Mas]], that operate in [[Comarca Lagunera]], [[Super Q]] and [[El Matador]] in [[Queretaro]], [[Coyote]] in [[Central Mexico]] and [[JV (convenience store)|JV]] in Northeastern Mexico. Stores sell fast food like [[coffee]], [[hot-dogs]] and [[nachos]], cellphone prepaids between MXN$20 and MX$500, mainly [[Telcel]] and [[Movistar]], [[newspaper]]s, [[magazines]], and some of their sells [[Panini Comics|Panini]] products and other novelties.

Misceláneas (lit. meaning &quot;place where miscellaneous items are sold&quot;, and otherwise called &quot;tiendas de abarrotes&quot; (grocery store) in some parts of the country) are smaller, family-run convenience stores, often found in central and southern Mexico. They operate in many locations, from rural communities to [[suburban]] residential neighborhoods, usually located in front of or below the family's residence. They often fulfil the role of neighborhood meeting points and places to disseminate community news. While offering a more limited, and sometimes varied, assortment of items than corporate chains, they fill a void in many areas in which corporate companies do not operate. Usually, they also sell home-made snacks, such as tortas and sandwiches, made by the owners themselves. They also provide items in smaller quantities than would be offered for sale in larger stores and markets, for example selling single cigarettes along with full packs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://direccionestrategica.itam.mx/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/MIscelaneasOK.doc |title=Las misceláneas en México |author1=Merino, María |author2=Mondragón, Carlos |work=Strategic Direction &amp; Planning, [[Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México]] |language=es |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624053835/http://direccionestrategica.itam.mx/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/MIscelaneasOK.doc |archive-date=2016-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Convenience stores in Peru are typically independent corner stores called &quot;bodegas&quot;, that include groceries, alcohol, services and phone booths. Other convenient stores are found at gas-stations in urban and connecting areas on highways; examples of these are Listo! (owned by [[Primax]]) and Repshop ([[Repsol]]).

There is a local version of convenience store in the [[Philippines]], called the [[sari-sari store]] which are located on almost every street, corner, residential area, and other public places around the country.

Aside from the local convenience stores, other popular international convenience stores are present on almost every street especially in urban areas. [[7-Eleven]] is the largest convenience store chain in the country. It is run by the Philippine Seven Corporation (PSC). Its first store, located in [[Quezon City]], opened in 1984. Its branches are now approximately 2,285.

There are also many branches of [[Ministop]], operated by [[Robinsons Malls|Robinsons Convenience Stores, Inc.]]; [[FamilyMart]], operated and franchised by [[Udenna Corporation]]; and [[All Day Convenience Store]], owned by Filipino entrepreneur and former Philippine Senator, [[Manny Villar]].

Major convenience shops in [[Singapore]] are [[7-Eleven]] owned by [[Dairy Farm International Holdings]] and [[Cheers (convenience store)|Cheers]] owned by [[NTUC Fairprice]].&lt;ref name=pwc&gt;Price Waterhouse Coopers. (2005/2006). Singapore. ''From Beijing to Budapest: Winning Brands, Winning Formats'', 4, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Figures from the Singapore Department of Statistics showed that there are 338 7-Eleven shops and 91 Cheers outlets in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Upstart Mini-marts&quot;. (2006, October 22). ''The Sunday Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Other convenience shops such as Myshop and One Plus appeared in 1983. Myshop belongs to a [[Japanese company]], and One Plus belongs to Emporium Holdings.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Convenience Stores Pose Threat to Supermarkets&quot;. (1984, March 23). ''The Business Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various reasons unique to Singapore have been given for the great popularity of convenience shops there. Convenience shops sell a wide range of imported goods, whereas minimarts and provision shops sell local products with a limited range of non-Asian products.&lt;ref name=&quot;pwc&quot;/&gt; Convenience shops are situated within [[housing estate]]s thus reducing [[consumer]]s' traveling time. Most [[Family|families]] in Singapore are dual-income families.&lt;ref&gt;Loh, Choon-Min James. (1988). ''The Adoption of A Retailing Innovation in A Newly Industrialising Country: The Modernisation of Local Provision Shops in Singapore''. United Kingdom: The British Library, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Since both the husband and wife are working, there is greater need for [[convenience]] in [[shopping]] for daily necessities. The 24-hour opening policy allows convenience shops to reach out to a larger group of consumers. Firstly, the policy caters to the [[shopping]] needs of consumers who work shifts or have irregular working hours.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Can 24-hr marts thrive in S'pore?&quot; (2005, May 15). ''The Straits Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, the policy caters to the increasing number of Singaporeans who are keeping late nights. It was reported that 54% of [[Singaporeans]] stayed up past [[midnight]] in an economic review by [[Price Waterhouse Coopers]] (PWC) in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Price Waterhouse Coopers. (2005/2006).

====7-Eleven====
{{Main|7-Eleven}}
[[Image:uspmadeleine1a.jpg|thumb|upright|A 7-Eleven shop under a block of flats]]

[[7-Eleven]] began the trend of convenience shops in [[Singapore]] when it opened its first shop in 1982 by [[Jardine Matheson Group]], under a franchise agreement with Southland Corporation of the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;&quot;The Business Times reports that in Singapore chains of mini-markets (or convenience shops) have rapidly sprung up to fill the gap between the large supermarkets and the neighbourhood shops (or provision shops). (1984, November 15). ''Business Times Singapore''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dairy Farm International Holdings]] acquired the chain from [[Jardine Matheson Group]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Dairy Farm reviewing 7-Eleven businesses in Singapore and Malaysia&quot;. (April 12, 1989). ''Business Times Singapore''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of 7-Eleven outlets continued to increase in 1984 while other chains were having difficulty in expanding. One Plus was unable to expand due to the shortage of good sites. The original owners of the Myshop franchise, which had seven outlets, sold out to one of its [[suppliers]] due to a lack of demand.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

However, in 1985, 7-Eleven faced difficulty in finding favourable locations and failed to meet its one-shop-a-month target. The situation improved in 1986 with a new [[Housing Development Board]] (HDB) tendering system, which allowed 7-Eleven to secure shops without having to bid too high a price.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The 7-Eleven convenience store chain in Singapore, the franchise of which is held by Jardine Matheson, should nearly double its expected rate of opening one new store each month by the end of the year.&quot; (November 5, 1986). ''Business Times Singapore''.&lt;/ref&gt; 7-Eleven shops are open twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, including Sundays and [[public holidays]].&lt;ref&gt;Loh, Choon-Min James. (1988).

United Kingdom: The British Library, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[24/7 service|24/7]] policy was seen as the reason that gave 7-Eleven its edge over its competitors.

In 1990, there was a rise in the number of shop thefts in 7-Eleven. The [[Shoplifting|shoplifters]] were usually [[teenagers]] who stole small items such as [[chocolates]], [[cigarettes]] and [[beer]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Convenience shops hit regularly by 'grabbers'&quot;. (1990, May 4). ''The Straits Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the increase in the number of thefts, 7-Eleven stepped up security measures, which successfully lowered the crime rate by 60%.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chain stores' anti-crime moves pay off with 60% drop in crime rate&quot;. (1991, December 1). ''The Straits Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boasting more than 10,000 convenience stores in an area of 35,980&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a population of 23 million, [[Taiwan]] has [[Asia Pacific]]'s and perhaps the world's highest density of convenience stores per person: one store per 2,500 people.&lt;ref&gt;[[:zh:便利商店|(convenience store - Wikipedia, October 2007)]]{{Circular reference|date=June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; With 4,665 7-Eleven stores, Taiwan also has the world's highest density of 7-Elevens per person: one store per 4,930 people [https://web.archive.org/web/20080731072739/http://www.7-eleven.com/AboutUs/InternationalLicensing/tabid/115/Default.aspx (International Licensing page of 7-Eleven website)]. In [[Taipei]], it is not unusual to see two 7-Elevens across the street or several of them within a few hundred meters of each other.

Because they are found everywhere, convenience stores in Taiwan provide services on behalf of financial institutions or government agencies such as collection of city parking fees, utility bills, traffic violation fines, and credit card payments. Eighty percent of urban household shoppers in Taiwan visit a convenience store each week [http://www.acnielsen.com.tw/news.asp?newsID=82 (2005 ACNielsen ShopperTrends)].

The corner shop in the United Kingdom grew from the start of the [[industrial revolution]], with large populations moving from the agricultural countryside to newly built model townships and later terraced housing in towns and cities. The corner shops were locally owned small businesses, started by entrepreneurs who had often had other careers before taking on the large start-up capital requirement required to establish such a trading business. Many well-known high street retail brands, such as [[Marks and Spencer]], [[Sainsbury's]] and latterly [[Tesco]], originated during the [[Victorian era]] as simple, family-owned corner shops.

The name '''corner shop''' originated because such shops are traditionally located on the corner of an intersection.

The reign of the corner shop and the weekly market started to fade post–[[World War II]], with the combination of the personal motor car and the introduction from the 1950s onwards of the American-originated [[supermarket]] format. The market shift in price and convenience led to the establishment of common trading brands operating as virtual [[Franchising|franchise]]s to win back the consumer, including [[Budgens]], [[Costcutter]], [[Londis (United Kingdom)|Londis]], [[Nisa (retailer)|Nisa]] and [[SPAR]]. There was also a consolidation of some shops under some larger corporate-owned brands, including [[One Stop]] and [[RS McColl]].

The primary competition to this privately owned 'corner shop' model came from the network of [[consumer cooperatives]] which were created after the success of that created by the [[Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers]] in 1844. Rather than being owned by individuals, these shops were owned by their customer-members and, owing to their popularity, the number of co-operative shops had reached 1,439 by 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/aboutus/ourhistory/|title=The Co-operative - our history}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-operatives came about as a response to the problem of [[adulterated food]] which existed at the time and later they enabled members to buy types of food that they would otherwise be unable to afford. At their peak in the 1950s, [[consumers' co-operatives]] accounted for approximately 20%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5294184.stm|title=Co-op rebrand sees 'divi' return|date=29 August 2006|via=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the UK grocery market, however with increasing competition this has decreased to around 6% in 2015. Due to a number of [[mergers]] over the years, the grocery co-operative sector in the UK is now predominately composed of the national [[The Co-operative Group]] and a few large regional co-operative societies such as the [[Midcounties Co-operative]] and [[Scotmid]]. Today, the majority of [[British co-operative movement|food retailing co-operatives societies]] brand their convenience shops as [[Co-op Food]] and together they form the second-largest convenience shop chain in the UK and the largest by number of shops, with one in every UK postal code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32715723|title=Co-op boss: Group 'let down' by former management|work=BBC News|date=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late-1960s onwards, many such shops started to be owned by expatriate African-born Indians, expelled from their homelands by the newly independent countries rulers. Under the [[Shops Act 1950]], Sunday trading had been illegal for most traders, with exceptions only allowed for small shops selling perishable items (i.e.: milk, bread, butter, fresh meat and vegetables), and most shops that were not [[off licence]]s had to close at 20:00. However, the [[Sunday Trading Act 1994]] allowed large format shops over {{convert|12000|ft2}} to open on a Sunday and later extended to 24/7 opening.{{cn|date=June 2020}}

In more recent time, due to a combination of competition laws and a lack of large-scale development space, many of the larger retail brands have now developed shop formats based around convenience shop and corner shop scale spaces, including [[Sainsbury's Local]], [[Waitrose &amp; Partners#Convenience shop and little Waitrose|Little Waitrose]] and [[Tesco Express]].

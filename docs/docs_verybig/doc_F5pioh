== TV program ==

Cabello has his own weekly program on [[Venezolana de Televisión]], ''[[Con El Mazo Dando|Con el Mazo Dando]]'' (Going at it with the Club).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conelmazodando.com.ve/ Program site]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuelan-officials-suspected-of-turning-country-into-global-cocaine-hub-1431977784 Venezuelan officials suspected of turning the country into global cocaine hub (Wall Street Journal)]&lt;/ref&gt; In that program, Cabello talks about the government's view on many political issues and presents accusations against the opposition. The  [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] (IACHR) has expressed concerns about how the program has intimidated people that went to the IACHR denouncing the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/media_center/PReleases/2015/032.asp IACHR Expresses Alarm over Intimidation in Venezuela directed against People Who Come before the Inter-American Human Rights System (OAS press release)]&lt;/ref&gt;
Some Venezuelan commentators have compared the use of illegally recorded private conversations on programs such as Cabello's to the practices in place in the [[East Germany]] as shown in the film [[The Life of Others]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.el-nacional.com/marcelino_bisbal/vida_0_632336919.html La Vida de los Otros (El Nacional)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621004128/http://www.el-nacional.com/marcelino_bisbal/vida_0_632336919.html |date=21 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amnesty International]] has denounced the way in which Cabello has revealed details on the travel
arrangements of two human rights defenders in his program and how he routinely shows state monitoring of people that may disagree with the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/sites/default/files/uaa12315.pdf Amnesty International report on TV program]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
{{details|Corruption in Venezuela#Diosdado Cabello}}
Cabello was nicknamed &quot;the octopus&quot; by [[Rory Carroll]] for having &quot;tentacles everywhere.&quot;&lt;ref name=p122&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carroll|first1=Rory|title=Comandante : myth and reality in Hugo Chávez's Venezuela|date=2013|publisher=New York|location=Penguin Press|isbn=9781594204579|pages=122–123}}&lt;!--|accessdate=14 November 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He is very influential in the Venezuelan government, using a network of [[patronage]] throughout the military, ministries and [[Colectivo (Venezuela)|pro-government militias]].&lt;ref name=p122/&gt;

=== Assassination plot targeting Marco Rubio ===
In mid-July 2017, reporters in Washington, D.C. observed an increased security presence surrounding [[United States Senator]] [[Marco Rubio]]. A month later on 13 August 2017, ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' reported that Diosdado Cabello had initiated an assassination plot targeting Rubio, allegedly contacting Mexican nationals to discuss killing Rubio. Rubio, who is a critic of the Venezuelan government, has led an effort in the United States government to take action against officials of the Latin American government, often singling out Cabello. The [[Department of Homeland Security]] could not verify all of the details involved in the threat, though the plan was serious enough that multiple law enforcement agencies were contacted about the incident and Rubio's security detail had increased in size.&lt;ref name=&quot;MHassCABELLO&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mazzei|first1=Patricia|title=Powerful Venezuelan lawmaker may have issued death order against Rubio|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/venezuela/article166981822.html|access-date=13 August 2017|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|date=13 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sanctions ===
Cabello has been [[International sanctions during the Venezuelan crisis|sanctioned by several countries]] and is banned from entering neighboring Colombia. The Colombian government maintains a list of people banned from entering Colombia or subject to expulsion; as of January 2019, the list had 200 people with a &quot;close relationship and support for the Nicolás Maduro regime&quot;.&lt;ref name=MaduroHeads&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.eltiempo.com/politica/gobierno/colombia-prohibe-el-ingreso-al-pais-a-200-personas-cercanas-a-maduro-320994 |work= El Tiempo |language= es | access-date= 13 April 2019 | title= Maduro encabeza lista de 200 venezolanos que no pueden entrar al país |date= 30 January 2019 |trans-title= Maduro tops list of 200 Venezuelans who can not enter the country}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Colombia31Jan2019&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.rcnradio.com/colombia/primera-parte-de-lista-de-colaboradores-de-maduro-que-no-pueden-ingresar-colombia |publisher= RCN Radio |language = es |access-date= 13 April 2019 |title= Primera parte de lista de colaboradores de Maduro que no pueden ingresar a Colombia |date= 31 January 2019 |trans-title= First part of list of Maduro collaborators who can not enter Colombia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== European Union ====
The [[European Union]] sanctioned Cabello and six other Venezuela officials on 18 January 2018, singling them out as being responsible for deteriorating democracy in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-42774732 |work= BBC Mundo |date= 22 January 2018 |access-date= 3 April 2019 |title= Quiénes son los 7 funcionarios de Venezuela sancionados por la Unión Europea y de qué se les acusa |language= es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sanctioned individuals were prohibited from entering the nations of the European Union, and their assets were frozen.&lt;ref name=EU7&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.apnews.com/7fbf5b3f94a94a838d165937caaf2054 |work= Associated Press |date= 22 January 2018 |access-date= 2 April 2019 |title= EU imposes sanctions on 7 senior Venezuelan officials}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cabello, known as number two in [[Chavismo]], had not been sanctioned by the U.S. when the European Union sanctioned him.&lt;ref name= EU7/&gt;

==== United States ====
On 18 May 2018, the [[Office of Foreign Assets Control|Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)]] of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] placed sanctions in effect against Cabello, his wife, his brother and his &quot;testaferro&quot; Rafael Sarria. OFAC stated that Cabello and others used their power within the Bolivarian government &quot;to personally profit from extortion, money laundering, and embezzlement&quot;, with Cabello allegedly directing drug trafficking activities with Vice President of Venezuela, [[Tareck El Aissami]] while dividing profits with President [[Nicolás Maduro]]. The Office also stated that Cabello would use public information to track wealth individuals who were potentially drug trafficking and steal their drugs and property in order to get rid of potential competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0389|title=Treasury Targets Influential Former Venezuelan Official and His Corruption Network|date=18 May 2018|website=[[Office of Foreign Assets Control]]|publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]]|access-date=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the sanctions, reports estimate that approximately $800 million worth of assets were frozen by the United States government. Cabello denied the reports, stating that it would be foolish to have assets located in a place where they could be seized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article213032354.html|title=Report: U.S. confiscated $800 million from top Venezuelan official|date=12 June 2018|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|access-date=15 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:A5-1 GSM cipher.svg|280px|thumbnail|
The operation of the [[keystream]] generator in [[A5/1]], an LFSR-based stream cipher used to encrypt mobile phone conversations.]]

A '''stream cipher''' is a [[symmetric key algorithm|symmetric key]] [[cipher]] where plaintext digits are combined with a [[pseudorandom]] cipher digit stream ([[keystream]]). In a stream cipher, each [[plaintext]] [[numerical digit|digit]] is encrypted one at a time with the corresponding digit of the keystream, to give a digit of the [[ciphertext]] stream. Since encryption of each digit is dependent on the current state of the cipher, it is also known as '''''state cipher'''''. In practice, a digit is typically a [[bit]] and the combining operation is an [[exclusive-or]] (XOR).

The pseudorandom keystream is typically generated serially from a random seed value using digital [[shift register]]s. The [[seed value]] serves as the [[cryptographic key]] for decrypting the ciphertext stream. Stream ciphers represent a different approach to symmetric encryption from [[block cipher]]s. Block ciphers operate on large blocks of digits with a fixed, unvarying transformation. This distinction is not always clear-cut: in some [[block cipher mode of operation|modes of operation]], a block cipher primitive is used in such a way that it acts effectively as a stream cipher. Stream ciphers typically execute at a higher speed than block ciphers and have lower hardware complexity. However, stream ciphers can be susceptible to serious security problems if used incorrectly (see [[stream cipher attack]]s); in particular, the same starting state (seed) must never be used twice.

==Loose inspiration from the one-time pad==
Stream ciphers can be viewed as approximating the action of a proven unbreakable cipher, the [[one-time pad]] (OTP). A one-time pad uses a [[keystream]] of completely [[random]] digits. The keystream is combined with the plaintext digits one at a time to form the ciphertext. This system was proved to be secure by [[Claude E. Shannon]] in 1949. However, the keystream must be generated completely at random with at least the same length as the plaintext and cannot be used more than once. This makes the system cumbersome to implement in many practical applications, and as a result the one-time pad has not been widely used, except for the most critical applications. Key generation, distribution and management are critical for those applications.

A stream cipher makes use of a much smaller and more convenient key such as 128 bits. Based on this key, it generates a pseudorandom keystream which can be combined with the plaintext digits in a similar fashion to the one-time pad. However, this comes at a cost. The keystream is now pseudorandom and so is not truly random. The proof of security associated with the one-time pad no longer holds. It is quite possible for a stream cipher to be completely insecure.

==Types==
A stream cipher generates successive elements of the keystream based on an internal state. This state is updated in essentially two ways: if the state changes independently of the plaintext or [[ciphertext]] messages, the cipher is classified as a ''synchronous'' stream cipher. By contrast, ''self-synchronising'' stream ciphers update their state based on previous ciphertext digits.

===Synchronous stream ciphers===
[[File:Lorenz Cipher Machine.jpg|thumb|[[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz SZ cipher]] machine as used by the German military during World War II]]
In a '''synchronous stream cipher''' a stream of pseudo-random digits is generated independently of the plaintext and ciphertext messages, and then combined with the plaintext (to encrypt) or the ciphertext (to decrypt). In the most common form, binary digits are used ([[bit]]s), and the keystream is combined with the plaintext using the [[exclusive or]] operation (XOR). This is termed a '''binary additive stream cipher'''.

In a synchronous stream cipher, the sender and receiver must be exactly in step for decryption to be successful. If digits are added or removed from the message during transmission, synchronisation is lost. To restore synchronisation, various offsets can be tried systematically to obtain the correct decryption. Another approach is to tag the ciphertext with markers at regular points in the output.

If, however, a digit is corrupted in transmission, rather than added or lost, only a single digit in the plaintext is affected and the error does not propagate to other parts of the message. This property is useful when the transmission error rate is high; however, it makes it less likely the error would be detected without further mechanisms. Moreover, because of this property, synchronous stream ciphers are very susceptible to [[Attack (computing)#Phenomenology|active attack]]s: if an attacker can change a digit in the ciphertext, they might be able to make predictable changes to the corresponding plaintext bit; for example, flipping a bit in the ciphertext causes the same bit to be flipped in the plaintext.

===Self-synchronizing stream ciphers===
Another approach uses several of the previous ''N'' ciphertext digits to compute the keystream. Such schemes are known as '''self-synchronizing stream ciphers''', '''asynchronous stream ciphers''' or '''ciphertext autokey''' ('''CTAK'''). The idea of self-synchronization was patented in 1946, and has the advantage that the receiver will automatically synchronise with the keystream generator after receiving ''N'' ciphertext digits, making it easier to recover if digits are dropped or added to the message stream. Single-digit errors are limited in their effect, affecting only up to ''N'' plaintext digits.

An example of a self-synchronising stream cipher is a block cipher in [[cipher feedback]] (CFB) [[block cipher modes of operation|mode]].

==Based on linear-feedback shift registers==
Binary stream ciphers are often constructed using [[linear-feedback shift register]]s (LFSRs) because they can be easily implemented in hardware and can be readily analysed mathematically. The use of LFSRs on their own, however, is insufficient to provide good security. Various schemes have been proposed to increase the security of LFSRs.

===Non-linear combining functions===
[[Image:Nonlinear-combo-generator.png|thumbnail|One approach is to use ''n'' LFSRs in parallel, their outputs combined using an ''n''-input binary Boolean function (''F'').]]
Because LFSRs are inherently linear, one technique for removing the linearity is to feed the outputs of several parallel LFSRs into a non-linear [[Boolean function]] to form a ''combination generator''. Various properties of such a ''combining function'' are critical for ensuring the security of the resultant scheme, for example, in order to avoid [[correlation attack]]s.

===Clock-controlled generators===
Normally LFSRs are stepped regularly. One approach to introducing non-linearity is to have the LFSR clocked irregularly, controlled by the output of a second LFSR. Such generators include the [[stop-and-go generator]], the [[alternating step generator]] and the [[shrinking generator]].

An [[alternating step generator]] comprises three LFSRs, which we will call LFSR0, LFSR1 and LFSR2 for convenience. The output of one of the registers decides which of the other two is to be used; for instance if LFSR2 outputs a 0, LFSR0 is clocked, and if it outputs a 1, LFSR1 is clocked instead. The output is the exclusive OR of the last bit produced by LFSR0 and LFSR1. The initial state of the three LFSRs is the key.

The stop-and-go generator (Beth and Piper, 1984) consists of two LFSRs. One LFSR is clocked if the output of a second is a 1, otherwise it repeats its previous output. This output is then (in some versions) combined with the output of a third LFSR clocked at a regular rate.

The [[shrinking generator]] takes a different approach. Two LFSRs are used, both clocked regularly. If the output of the first LFSR is 1, the output of the second LFSR becomes the output of the generator. If the first LFSR outputs 0, however, the output of the second is discarded, and no bit is output by the generator. This mechanism suffers from timing attacks on the second generator, since the speed of the output is variable in a manner that depends on the second generator's state. This can be alleviated by buffering the output.

===Filter generator===
Another approach to improving the security of an LFSR is to pass the entire state of a single LFSR into a non-linear ''filtering function''.

==Other designs==
[[Image:RC4.svg|280px|thumbnail|[[RC4]] is one of the most widely used stream cipher designs.]]
Instead of a linear driving device, one may use a nonlinear update function. For example, Klimov and Shamir proposed triangular functions ([[T-function]]s) with a single cycle on n-bit words.

==Security==
{{main|Stream cipher attacks}}

For a stream cipher to be secure, its keystream must have a large [[periodic function|period]] and it must be impossible to ''recover the cipher's key'' or internal state from the keystream. Cryptographers also demand that the keystream be free of even subtle biases that would let attackers ''distinguish'' a stream from random noise, and free of detectable relationships between keystreams that correspond to ''related keys'' or related [[cryptographic nonce]]s. That should be true for all keys (there should be no ''[[weak key]]s''), even if the attacker can ''know'' or ''choose'' some ''plaintext'' or ''ciphertext''.

As with other attacks in cryptography, stream cipher attacks can be ''certificational'' so they are not necessarily practical ways to break the cipher but indicate that the cipher might have other weaknesses.

Securely using a secure synchronous stream cipher requires that one never reuse the same keystream twice. That generally means a different [[Cryptographic nonce|nonce]] or key must be supplied to each invocation of the cipher. Application designers must also recognize that most stream ciphers provide not ''authenticity'' but ''privacy'': encrypted messages may still have been modified in transit.

Short periods for stream ciphers have been a practical concern. For example, 64-bit block ciphers like [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] can be used to generate a keystream in [[output feedback]] (OFB) mode. However, when not using full feedback, the resulting stream has a period of around 2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; blocks on average; for many applications, the period is far too low. For example, if encryption is being performed at a rate of 8 [[megabyte]]s per second, a stream of period 2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; blocks will repeat after about a half an hour.{{dubious|date=October 2017|reason=8MB/sec=64Mb/sec, so roughly 2^20 blocks/sec; so it will take roughly 2^12 or approx. 4000 sec to go through 2^32 blocks. It's a bit over an hour, not a half-hour as claimed.}}

Some applications using the stream cipher [[RC4]] are attackable because of weaknesses in RC4's key setup routine; new applications should either avoid RC4 or make sure all keys are unique and ideally [[related key|unrelated]] (such as generated by a well-seeded [[Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator|CSPRNG]] or a [[cryptographic hash function]]) and that the first bytes of the keystream are discarded.

The elements of stream ciphers are often much simpler to understand than block ciphers and are thus less likely to hide any accidental or malicious weaknesses.

==Usage==
Stream ciphers are often used for their speed and simplicity of implementation in hardware, and in applications where plaintext comes in quantities of unknowable length like a secure [[wireless network|wireless]] connection. If a [[block cipher]] (not operating in a stream cipher mode) were to be used in this type of application, the designer would need to choose either transmission efficiency or implementation complexity, since block ciphers cannot directly work on blocks shorter than their block size. For example, if a 128-bit block cipher received separate 32-bit bursts of plaintext, three quarters of the data transmitted would be [[padding (cryptography)|padding]]. Block ciphers must be used in [[ciphertext stealing]] or [[residual block termination]] mode to avoid padding, while stream ciphers eliminate this issue by naturally operating on the smallest unit that can be transmitted (usually bytes).

Another advantage of stream ciphers in military cryptography is that the cipher stream can be generated in a separate box that is subject to strict security measures and fed to other devices such as a radio set, which will perform the xor operation as part of their function. The latter device can then be designed and used in less stringent environments.

'''Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto''' ({{IPA-it|bartʃelˈloːna ˈpottso di ˈɡɔtto|lang}}; [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]: '''''Baccialona Pizzaottu''''') is a town and ''[[comune]]'' of about 50,000&amp;nbsp;inhabitants in the north coast of [[Sicily]], [[Italy]], {{convert|40|km|mi}} from [[Messina, Italy|Messina]] towards [[Palermo]]. It belongs to the [[Metropolitan City of Messina]].

==History==
 
=== Ancient history ===

In the area corresponding to the current municipal area were the following ancient settlements were identified:

* Settlement and necropolis of the Bronze Age and Iron Age, in Maloto locality.
* Settlement and necropolis, from around the 10th century BC, in Pizzo Lando.
* Settlement and necropolis of ancient Greek or Hellenistic times, assigned to 8th century BC, in Oliveto locality.
* Settlement and necropolis of [[Sicani]]/Greek origins, dating from around the 6th and 5ht centuries BC, in Sant'Onofrio locality.

In 265 BC, the Battle of Longano between the army of [[Hiero II of Syracuse]] and the [[Mamertines]] under the command of the leader [[Cione]] took place in this area. The exact assignment of the place in the absence of identifiable cause remains earthquakes or floods or diversion of water courses, there are several hypotheses that place the event along the courses of the rivers bordering the &quot;Mela&quot; or &quot;Patrì&quot;, and other in the vicinity of the mythical city: &quot;Longane&quot; ([[Rodì Milici]]) or &quot;Abacena&quot; ([[Tripi]]), however settlements related to the same conflict.

=== Origins and etymology ===

[[File:Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto Il Municipio.jpg|thumb |Longano Palace.]]                                                                                                                                      [[File:VARA ECCE HOMO.JPG|thumb|ECCE HOMO of Barcellona.]] 

Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto lies in the plain that slopes to the north close to the lush hills and the chain of [[Peloritani]] mountains, overlooking the Gulf of [[Patti, Sicily|Patti]] in the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] on the part near the [[Aeolian Islands]] in a portion of coast between the Milazzo peninsula to the east and to the west promontory of Tindari.

The most creditable hypothesis for the roots to its name lies in the domination of the [[Crown of Aragon]] (1282&amp;ndash;1516) and then in the five hundred year [[history of Spanish Sicily]] (1516&amp;ndash;1713), flowing together with the [[Kingdom of Naples]] under the jurisdiction of the [[Crown of Spain]]. The same analogy have identified the first conquerors from [[County of Aragon]] and [[County of Barcelona]].

The oldest part of the town, Pozzo di Gotto, owes its name to the digging of a well for irrigation in cultivated lands located between the rivers Idria and Longano, belonging to Nicholas Goto as described in [[Vulgar Latin]] in a document dated 1463: &quot;'' ... Nicolao de Gotho, ..., in quo Puzzo de Gotho ...''&quot;. In 1571 Pozzogottesi obtained from the Grand Court of the Archbishop of Messina permission to elect their chaplain stationed in [[Saint Vitus]] no longer depend from Archpriest of Milazzo. Gained recognition, has advanced the redemption request to the Court of Madrid against the oppressive power of Milazzo under whose jurisdiction Pozzo di Gotto depended politically and physically by providing a distant hamlet, a bond that will be permanently discontinued 22 May 1639, and ratified by royal decree Viceroy under the reign of [[Philip IV of Spain]], assumes the title &quot;Libera et Realis Civitas Putei de Gotho&quot;. The village in the west of the river Longano in turn under the jurisdiction of [[Castroreale]] and had already followed the example of the neighboring community, rebelling against the jurors [[castrensian]] doing in the Church to recognize its independence. Notarial deeds dating back to 1522 in Castroreale report the name of the district or hamlet of &quot;Barsalona&quot;, a name likely to be attributed to the presence in the baptismal books of Pozzo di Gotto the name of &quot;Graziosa Barsalona&quot;, on the other hand is supported the thesis that the name of the location has been given by Iberian sailors having recognizing the remarkable similarity of the two territories.

The autonomy of the village of Barcellona was accepted by the [[Sicilian Parliament]], recognized by the King on  15 May 1815 and ratified in [[Wien]] 28 February 1823, by King [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies]]. The administrative union decreed 5 January 1835, comes into force on 1 June 1836 at the behest of King [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies]], deciding that the new municipality formed by the merger of the two ancient districts bore the full name of Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto. Are discarded by the King all the advanced options of names derived from the word &quot;Longano&quot;, receiving the unanimous appreciation, on the other hand the initial goodwill will turn into hatred and resentment towards the monarch as a result of criminal actions undertaken throughout the province, especially in Milazzo and Messina, which earned him the nickname of &quot;King Bomb&quot;. The city soon established covered a certain role with significant contributions to the definitive expulsion of the [[House of Bourbon]] from the province and the whole of Sicily and increasingly effective input in all the events included in the process of unification of constituting [[Kingdom of Italy]].

=== Traditions and folklore ===

The procession of Varette which takes place on Friday, when for parade through the streets of the city at the same time two processions consist of twenty-six Vare depicting the mysteries of the Passion, Easter Rites included in the &quot;[[Santa Sumana]]&quot;.

==Main sights==
The thirteenth-century village of [[Castroreale]], home to a tower from a medieval castle built by King [[Frederick II of Aragon]], is located nearby.

[[File:The Sun by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly of NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory - 20100819.jpg|thumb|The Sun has an intrinsic luminosity of {{val|3.83|e=26|u=[[Watt]]s}}. In astronomy, this amount is equal to one [[solar luminosity]], represented by the symbol ''L''&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;. A star with four times the radiative power of the sun has a luminosity of {{val|4|u=''L''&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;}}.]]

'''Luminosity''' is an absolute measure of radiated [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic power]] (light), the [[radiant power]] emitted by a light-emitting object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/luminosity|title=Luminosity {{!}} astronomy|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=24 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.mimi.hu/astronomy/luminosity.html|title=* Luminosity (Astronomy) - Definition,meaning - Online Encyclopedia|website=en.mimi.hu|access-date=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[astronomy]], luminosity is the total amount of electromagnetic [[energy]] emitted per unit of [[time]] by a [[star]], [[galaxy]], or other [[astronomical object]].&lt;ref name=Hopkins1980&gt;{{cite book |last=Hopkins |first=Jeanne |title=Glossary of Astronomy and Astrophysics |edition=2nd |publisher=[[The University of Chicago Press]] |date=1980 |isbn=978-0-226-35171-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morison |first1=Ian |title=Introduction to Astronomy and Cosmology |date=2013 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1-118-68152-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fh_yo8Jv7t8C&amp;pg=PT193|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[SI]] units, luminosity is measured in [[joules]] per second, or [[watt]]s. In astronomy, values for luminosity are often given in the terms of the [[Solar luminosity|luminosity]] of the [[Sun]], L&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;. Luminosity can also be given in terms of the astronomical [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] system: the [[Absolute magnitude#Bolometric magnitude|absolute bolometric magnitude]] (M&lt;sub&gt;bol&lt;/sub&gt;) of an object is a logarithmic measure of its total energy emission rate, while [[absolute magnitude]] is a logarithmic measure of the luminosity within some specific [[wavelength]] range or [[Passband|filter band]].

In contrast, the term ''brightness'' in astronomy is generally used to refer to an object's apparent brightness: that is, how bright an object appears to an observer. Apparent brightness depends on both the luminosity of the object and the distance between the object and observer, and also on any [[Extinction (astronomy)|absorption]] of light along the path from object to observer. [[Apparent magnitude]] is a logarithmic measure of apparent brightness. The distance determined by luminosity measures can be somewhat ambiguous, and is thus sometimes called the [[luminosity distance]].

== Measurement ==
When not qualified, the term &quot;luminosity&quot; means bolometric luminosity, which is measured either in the [[SI]] units, [[watt]]s, or in terms of [[solar luminosity|solar luminosities]] ({{solar luminosity}}).  A [[bolometer]] is the instrument used to measure [[radiant energy]] over a wide band by [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] and measurement of heating.  A star also radiates [[neutrino]]s, which carry off some energy (about 2% in the case of our Sun), contributing to the star's total luminosity.&lt;ref name=&quot;BAHCALL1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Bahcall |authorlink=John N. Bahcall |url=http://www.sns.ias.edu/~jnb/SNviewgraphs/snviewgraphs.html |title=Solar Neutrino Viewgraphs |publisher=[[Institute for Advanced Study]] School of Natural Science |accessdate=3 July 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IAU has defined a nominal solar luminosity of {{val|3.828|e=26|u=W}} to promote publication of consistent and comparable values in units of the solar luminosity.&lt;ref name=iau&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1510.07674|class=astro-ph.SR|title=IAU 2015 Resolution B3 on Recommended Nominal Conversion Constants for Selected Solar and Planetary Properties|last1=Mamajek|first1=E.

While bolometers do exist, they cannot be used to measure even the apparent brightness of a star because they are insufficiently sensitive across the electromagnetic spectrum and because most wavelengths do not reach the surface of the Earth.  In practice bolometric magnitudes are measured by taking measurements at certain wavelengths and constructing a model of the total spectrum that is most likely to match those measurements.  In some cases, the process of estimation is extreme, with luminosities being calculated when less than 1% of the energy output is observed, for example with a hot [[Wolf-Rayet star]] observed only in the infrared. Bolometric luminosities can also be calculated using a [[bolometric correction]] to a luminosity in a particular passband.&lt;ref name=nieva&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2013A&amp;A...550A..26N|arxiv=1212.0928|title=Temperature, gravity, and bolometric correction scales for non-supergiant OB stars|journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics|volume=550|pages=A26|author1=Nieva|first1=M.-F|year=2013|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201219677}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=buzzoni&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2010MNRAS.403.1592B|arxiv=1002.1972|title=Bolometric correction and spectral energy distribution of cool stars in Galactic clusters|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=403|issue=3|pages=1592|author1=Buzzoni|first1=A|last2=Patelli|first2=L|last3=Bellazzini|first3=M|last4=Pecci|first4=F.

The term luminosity is also used in relation to particular [[passband]]s such as a visual luminosity of [[k band (infrared)|K-band]] luminosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faculty.virginia.edu/ASTR5610/lectures/LECTURE2/lec2a.html|title=ASTR 5610, Majewski [SPRING 2016].

Several different photometric systems exist.  Some such as the UBV or [[UBV photometric system|Johnson]] system are defined against photometric standard stars, while others such as the [[AB magnitude|AB system]] are defined in terms of a [[spectral flux density]].&lt;ref name=delfosse&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2000A&amp;A...364..217D|arxiv=astro-ph/0010586|title=Accurate masses of very low mass stars.

== Stellar luminosity ==
A star's luminosity can be determined from two stellar characteristics: size and [[effective temperature]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AUSTRALIA2004&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Luminosity of Stars |publisher=[[Australia Telescope National Facility]]|url=http://outreach.atnf.csiro.au/education/senior/astrophysics/photometry_luminosity.html |date=12 July 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809144429/http://www.atnf.csiro.au/outreach//education/senior/astrophysics/photometry_luminosity.html |archivedate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former is typically represented in terms of solar [[radius|radii]], R&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;, while the latter is represented in [[kelvin]]s, but in most cases neither can be measured directly.  To determine a star's radius, two other metrics are needed: the star's [[angular diameter]] and its distance from Earth.  Both can be measured with great accuracy in certain cases, with cool supergiants often having large angular diameters, and some cool evolved stars having [[astrophysical maser|maser]]s in their atmospheres that can be used to measure the parallax using [[VLBI]].  However, for most stars the angular diameter or parallax, or both, are far below our ability to measure with any certainty.  Since the effective temperature is merely a number that represents the temperature of a black body that would reproduce the luminosity, it obviously cannot be measured directly, but it can be estimated from the spectrum.

An alternative way to measure stellar luminosity is to measure the star's apparent brightness and distance.  A third component needed to derive the luminosity is the degree of [[Extinction (astronomy)|interstellar extinction]] that is present, a condition that usually arises because of gas and dust present in the [[interstellar medium]] (ISM), the [[Earth's atmosphere]], and [[circumstellar dust|circumstellar matter]].  Consequently, one of astronomy's central challenges in determining a star's luminosity is to derive accurate measurements for each of these components, without which an accurate luminosity figure remains elusive.&lt;ref name=&quot;KARTTUNEN1&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last1 = Karttunen  | first1 = Hannu  | title = Fundamental Astronomy  | publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]  | date = 2003  | page = 289  | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OEhHqwW-kgQC |url-status=live | isbn = 978-3-540-00179-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extinction can only be measured directly if the actual and observed luminosities are both known, but it can be estimated from the observed colour of a star, using models of the expected level of reddening from the interstellar medium.

In the current system of [[stellar classification]], stars are grouped according to temperature, with the massive, very young and energetic [[O-type main sequence star|Class O]] stars boasting temperatures in excess of 30,000&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] while the less massive, typically older [[Stellar classification#Class M|Class M]] stars exhibit temperatures less than 3,500&amp;nbsp;K. Because luminosity is proportional to temperature to the fourth power, the large variation in stellar temperatures produces an even vaster variation in stellar luminosity.&lt;ref name=&quot;LEDREW1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ledrew, Glenn | title=The Real Starry Sky | journal=Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada |date=February 2001 | volume=95 | pages=32–33 | url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?2001JRASC..95...32L&amp;amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;amp;type=PRINTER&amp;amp;filetype=.pdf | accessdate=2 July 2012 | bibcode=2001JRASC..95...32L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the luminosity depends on a high power of the stellar mass, high mass luminous stars have much shorter lifetimes.  The most luminous stars are always young stars, no more than a few million years for the most extreme.  In the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]], the x-axis represents temperature or spectral type while the y-axis represents luminosity or magnitude.  The vast majority of stars are found along the [[main sequence]] with blue Class O stars found at the top left of the chart while red Class M stars fall to the bottom right.  Certain stars like [[Deneb]] and [[Betelgeuse]] are found above and to the right of the main sequence, more luminous or cooler than their equivalents on the main sequence.  Increased luminosity at the same temperature, or alternatively cooler temperature at the same luminosity, indicates that these stars are larger than those on the main sequence and they are called giants or supergiants.

Blue and white supergiants are high luminosity stars somewhat cooler than the most luminous main sequence stars.  A star like [[Deneb]], for example, has a luminosity around 200,000 L&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;, a spectral type of A2, and an effective temperature around 8,500&amp;nbsp;K, meaning it has a radius around {{convert|203|solar radius|m|abbr=on|lk=on}}. For comparison, the red supergiant [[Betelgeuse]] has a luminosity around 100,000 L&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;, a spectral type of M2, and a temperature around 3,500&amp;nbsp;K, meaning its radius is about {{convert|1000|solar radius|m|abbr=on|lk=on}}. Red supergiants are the largest type of star, but the most luminous are much smaller and hotter, with temperatures up to 50,000&amp;nbsp;K and more and luminosities of several million L&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;, meaning their radii are just a few tens of R&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;.  For example, [[R136a1]] has a temperature over 50,000&amp;nbsp;K and a luminosity of more than 8,000,000 L&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt; (mostly in the UV), it is only {{convert|35|solar radius|m|abbr=on|lk=on}}.

== Radio luminosity ==
The luminosity of a [[Astronomical radio source|radio source]] is measured in {{math|W Hz&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, to avoid having to specify a [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] over which it is measured. The observed strength, or [[flux density]], of a radio source is measured in [[Jansky]] where  {{math|1 Jy {{=}} 10&lt;sup&gt;−26&lt;/sup&gt; W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; Hz&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

For example, consider a 10W transmitter at a distance of 1 million metres, radiating over a bandwidth of 1&amp;nbsp;MHz. By the time that power has reached the observer, the power is spread over the surface of a sphere with area {{math|4{{pi}}''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} or about {{math|1.26×10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, so its flux density is {{math|10 / 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; / 1.26×10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; Hz&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Jy}}.

More generally, for sources at cosmological distances, a [[k-correction]] must be made for the spectral index α of the source, and a relativistic correction must be made for the fact that the frequency scale in the emitted [[rest frame]] is different from that in the observer's [[rest frame]]. So the full expression for radio luminosity, assuming [[isotropic]] emission, is

:&lt;math&gt;L_{\nu} = \frac{S_{\mathrm{obs}} 4 \pi {D_{L}}^{2}}{(1+z)^{1+\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''L&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the luminosity in {{math|W Hz&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt; is the observed [[flux density]] in {{math|W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; Hz&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ''D&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[luminosity distance]] in metres, ''z'' is the redshift, ''&amp;alpha;'' is the [[spectral index]] (in the sense &lt;math&gt;I \propto{\nu}^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, and in radio astronomy, assuming thermal emission the spectral index is typically [[Spectral index|equal to 2.]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Singal |first1=J. |last2=Petrosian |first2=V. |last3=Lawrence |first3=A. |last4=Stawarz |first4=Ł. |title=On the Radio and Optical Luminosity Evolution of Quasars |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |date=20 December 2011 |volume=743 |issue=2 |pages=104 |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/743/2/104|arxiv=1101.2930 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, consider a 1 Jy signal from a radio source at a [[redshift]] of 1, at a frequency of 1.4&amp;nbsp;GHz.
[http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/CosmoCalc.html Ned Wright's cosmology calculator] calculates a [[luminosity distance]] for a redshift of 1 to be 6701 Mpc =  2×10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; m
giving a radio luminosity of {{math|10&lt;sup&gt;−26&lt;/sup&gt; × 4{{pi}}(2×10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / (1+1)&lt;sup&gt;(1+2)&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 6×10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; W Hz&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

To calculate the total radio power, this luminosity must be integrated over the bandwidth of the emission. A common assumption is to set the bandwidth to the observing frequency, which effectively assumes the power radiated has uniform intensity from zero frequency up to the observing frequency. In the case above, the total power is {{math|4×10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; × 1.4×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 5.7×10&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; W}}. This is sometimes expressed in terms of the total (i.e. integrated over all wavelengths) luminosity of the [[Sun]] which is {{math|3.86×10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; W}}, giving a radio power of {{math|1.5×10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; L&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

== Luminosity formulae ==
[[File:Inverse square law.svg|right|thumb|Point source ''S'' is radiating light equally in all directions. The amount passing through an area ''A'' varies with the distance of the surface from the light.]]

The [[Stefan–Boltzmann law|Stefan–Boltzmann]] equation applied to a [[black body]] gives the value for luminosity for a black body, an idealized object which is perfectly opaque and non-reflecting:&lt;ref name=&quot;AUSTRALIA2004&quot;/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L= \sigma A T^4&lt;/math&gt; ,

where A is the surface area, T is the temperature (in Kelvins) and σ is the [[Stefan–Boltzmann constant]], with a value of {{physconst|sigma|after=.}}

Imagine a point source of light of luminosity &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; that radiates equally in all directions. A hollow [[sphere]] centered on the point would have its entire interior surface illuminated. As the radius increases, the surface area will also increase, and the constant luminosity has more surface area to illuminate, leading to a decrease in observed brightness.

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{L}{A}&lt;/math&gt; ,
where
:&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the area of the illuminated surface.
:&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the [[flux density]] of the illuminated surface.

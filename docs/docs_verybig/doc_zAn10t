&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
There are four types of DI, each with a different set of causes.&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt; [[Central diabetes insipidus|Central DI]] (CDI) is due to a lack of the hormone [[vasopressin]] (antidiuretic hormone).&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt; This can be due to injury to the [[hypothalamus]] or [[pituitary gland]] or [[genetics]].&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt; [[Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus|Nephrogenic DI]] (NDI) occurs when the [[kidney]]s do not respond properly to vasopressin.&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt; Dipsogenic DI is a result of [[Primary polydipsia|excessive fluid intake]] due to damage to the [[Hypothalamus|hypothalamic]] [[thirst]] mechanism.&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt; It occurs more often in those with certain psychiatric disorders or on certain medications.&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt; Gestational DI occurs only during [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt; Diagnosis is often based on [[Clinical urine tests|urine tests]], [[Blood test|blood tests]] and the [[fluid deprivation test]].&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt; Diabetes insipidus is unrelated to [[diabetes]] mellitus and the conditions have a distinct mechanism, though both can result in the production of large amounts of urine.&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment, epidemiology and culture--&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Excessive urination and extreme [[thirst]] and [[polydipsia|increased fluid intake]] (especially for cold water and sometimes ice or ice water) are typical for DI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=USE |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001415/ |title=Diabetes insipidus - PubMed Health |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |accessdate=2012-05-28 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829121450/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001415/ |archivedate=2012-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The symptoms of excessive urination and extreme thirst are similar to what is seen in untreated [[diabetes mellitus]], with the distinction that the urine does not contain glucose. Blurred vision is a rarity. Signs of [[dehydration]] may also appear in some individuals, since the body cannot conserve much (if any) of the water it takes in.

Extreme urination continues throughout the day and the night. In children, DI can interfere with appetite, eating, weight gain and [[human development (biology)|growth]], as well. They may present with [[fever]], [[vomiting]] or [[diarrhea]]. Adults with untreated DI may remain healthy for decades as long as enough water is consumed to offset the urinary losses. However, there is a continuous risk of dehydration and loss of potassium that may lead to [[hypokalemia]].

==Cause==
The several forms of diabetes insipidus are:

===Central===
{{main|Neurogenic diabetes insipidus}}
Central DI has many possible causes. According to the literature, the principal causes of central DI and their oft-cited approximate frequencies are as follows:
*Idiopathic – 30%
*Malignant or benign tumors of the brain or pituitary – 25%
*Cranial surgery – 20%
*Head trauma – 16%

===Nephrogenic===
{{main|Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus}}
Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is due to the inability of the kidney to respond normally to vasopressin.

===Dipsogenic===
Dipsogenic DI or [[primary polydipsia]] results from excessive intake of fluids as opposed to deficiency of arginine vasopressin. It may be due to a defect or damage to the thirst mechanism, located in the hypothalamus,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16544179&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Perkins RM, Yuan CM, Welch PG | title = Dipsogenic diabetes insipidus: report of a novel treatment strategy and literature review | journal = Clin. Exp. Nephrol. | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–7 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16544179 | doi = 10.1007/s10157-005-0397-0 | s2cid = 6874287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or due to mental illness. Treatment with desmopressin may lead to [[water intoxication]].

===Gestational===
Gestational DI occurs only during [[pregnancy]] and the postpartum period. During pregnancy, women produce [[vasopressinase]] in the [[placenta]], which breaks down antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Gestational DI is thought to occur with excessive production and/or impaired clearance of vasopressinase.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17308961&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kalelioglu I, Kubat Uzum A, Yildirim A, Ozkan T, Gungor F, Has R | title = Transient gestational diabetes insipidus diagnosed in successive pregnancies: review of pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and management of delivery | journal = Pituitary | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 87–93 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17308961 | doi = 10.1007/s11102-007-0006-1 | s2cid = 9493532 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most cases of gestational DI can be treated with desmopressin (DDAVP), but not vasopressin. In rare cases, however, an abnormality in the thirst mechanism causes gestational DI, and desmopressin should not be used.

Diabetes insipidus is also associated with some serious diseases of pregnancy, including [[pre-eclampsia]], [[HELLP syndrome]] and [[acute fatty liver of pregnancy]]. These cause DI by impairing hepatic clearance of circulating vasopressinase. It is important to consider these diseases if a woman presents with diabetes insipidus in pregnancy, because their treatments require delivery of the baby before the disease will improve. Failure to treat these diseases promptly can lead to maternal or perinatal mortality.

==Pathophysiology==
Electrolyte and volume [[homeostasis]] is a complex mechanism that balances the body's requirements for [[blood pressure]] and the main electrolytes [[sodium]] and [[potassium]]. In general, electrolyte regulation precedes volume regulation. When the volume is severely depleted, however, the body will retain water at the expense of deranging electrolyte levels.

The regulation of urine production occurs in the [[hypothalamus]], which produces [[Vasopressin|ADH]] in the [[Supraoptic nucleus|supraoptic]] and [[Paraventricular nucleus|paraventricular]] nuclei. After synthesis, the hormone is transported in neurosecretory granules down the axon of the hypothalamic neuron to the posterior lobe of the [[pituitary gland]], where it is stored for later release. In addition, the hypothalamus regulates the sensation of thirst in the [[ventromedial nucleus]] by sensing increases in serum [[osmolarity]] and relaying this information to the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]].

Neurogenic/central DI results from a lack of ADH; occasionally it can present with decreased thirst as regulation of thirst and ADH production occur in close proximity in the hypothalamus. It is encountered as a result of hypoxic encephalopathy, neurosurgery, autoimmunity or cancer, or sometimes without an underlying cause (idiopathic).

The main effector organ for [[body water|fluid]] homeostasis is the [[kidney]]. ADH acts by increasing water permeability in the [[collecting ducts]] and distal convoluted tubules; specifically, it acts on proteins called [[aquaporin]]s and more specifically aquaporin 2 in the following cascade. When released, ADH binds to V2 G-protein coupled receptors within the distal convoluted tubules, increasing [[cyclic AMP]], which couples with [[protein kinase A]], stimulating translocation of the aquaporin 2 channel stored in the [[cytoplasm]] of the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts into the apical membrane. These transcribed channels allow water into the collecting duct cells. The increase in permeability allows for reabsorption of water into the bloodstream, thus concentrating the urine.

Nephrogenic DI results from lack of aquaporin channels in the distal collecting duct (decreased surface expression and transcription). It is seen in [[Lithium (medication)#Toxicity|lithium toxicity]], hypercalcemia, hypokalemia, or release of ureteral obstruction. Therefore, a lack of ADH prevents water reabsorption and the osmolarity of the blood increases. With increased osmolarity, the osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus detect this change and stimulate thirst. With increased thirst, the person now experiences a polydipsia and polyuria cycle.  

Hereditary forms of diabetes insipidus account for less than 10% of the cases of diabetes insipidus seen in clinical practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fujiwara TM, Bichet DG | title = Molecular Biology of Hereditary Diabetes Insipidus | journal = Journal of the American Society of Nephrology | volume = 16 | issue = 10 | pages = 2836–2846 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16093448 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1681/ASN.2005040371 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
To distinguish DI from other causes of excess urination, [[blood glucose]] levels, [[bicarbonate]] levels, and [[calcium]] levels need to be tested. Measurement of blood [[electrolyte]]s can reveal a high [[sodium]] level ([[hypernatremia]] as [[dehydration]] develops). [[Urinalysis]] demonstrates a dilute urine with a low [[specific gravity]]. Urine [[osmolarity]] and electrolyte levels are typically low.

A [[fluid deprivation test]] is another way of distinguishing DI from other causes of excessive urination. If there is no change in fluid loss, giving desmopressin can determine if DI is caused by:
# a defect in [[antidiuretic hormone|ADH]] production
# a defect in the kidneys' response to ADH

This test measures the changes in body weight, urine output, and urine composition when fluids are withheld to induce dehydration. The body's normal response to dehydration is to conserve water by concentrating the urine. Those with DI continue to urinate large amounts of dilute urine in spite of water deprivation. In [[primary polydipsia]], the urine [[osmolality]] should increase and stabilize at above 280 mOsm/kg with fluid restriction, while a stabilization at a lower level indicates diabetes insipidus.&lt;ref name=agabegi2nd/&gt; Stabilization in this test means, more specifically, when the increase in urine osmolality is less than 30 Osm/kg per hour for at least three hours.&lt;ref name=agabegi2nd&gt;{{cite book |author1=Elizabeth D Agabegi |author2=Agabegi, Steven S. |title=Step-Up to Medicine (Step-Up Series) |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7817-7153-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/stepuptomedicine0000agab }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes measuring blood levels of ADH toward the end of this test is also necessary, but is more time consuming to perform.&lt;ref name=agabegi2nd/&gt;

To distinguish between the main forms, [[desmopressin]] stimulation is also used; desmopressin can be taken by injection, a nasal spray, or a tablet. While taking desmopressin, a person should drink fluids or water only when thirsty and not at other times, as this can lead to sudden fluid accumulation in the central nervous system. If desmopressin reduces urine output and increases urine osmolarity, the hypothalamic production of ADH is deficient, and the kidney responds normally to exogenous vasopressin (desmopressin). If the DI is due to kidney pathology, desmopressin does not change either urine output or osmolarity (since the endogenous vasopressin levels are already high).{{mcn|date=August 2019}}

Whilst diabetes insipidus usually occurs with polydipsia, it can also rarely occur not only in the absence of polydipsia but in the presence of its opposite, [[adipsia]] (or hypodipsia). &quot;Adipsic diabetes insipidus&quot; is recognised&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17371462&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Crowley RK, Sherlock M, Agha A, Smith D, Thompson CJ | title = Clinical insights into adipsic diabetes insipidus: a large case series | journal = Clin.

If central DI is suspected, testing of other hormones of the [[pituitary]], as well as [[magnetic resonance imaging]], particularly a pituitary MRI, is necessary to discover if a disease process (such as a [[prolactinoma]], or [[histiocytosis]], [[syphilis]], [[tuberculosis]] or other [[tumor]] or [[granuloma]]) is affecting pituitary function. Most people with this form have either experienced past head trauma or have stopped ADH production for an unknown reason.{{mcn|date=August 2019}}

Habit drinking (in its severest form termed [[psychogenic polydipsia]]) is the most common imitator of diabetes insipidus at all ages. While many adult cases in the medical literature are associated with mental disorders, most people with habit polydipsia have no other detectable disease. The distinction is made during the water deprivation test, as some degree of urinary concentration above isoosmolar is usually obtained before the person becomes dehydrated.{{mcn|date=August 2019}}

==Treatment==
Treatment involves drinking sufficient fluids to prevent dehydration.&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt; Other treatments depend on the type.&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt; In central and gestational DI treatment is with [[desmopressin]].&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt; Nephrogenic DI may be treated by addressing the underlying cause or the use of a [[thiazide]], [[aspirin]], or [[ibuprofen]].&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt;

===Central===
Central DI and gestational DI respond to [[desmopressin]] which is given as intranasal or oral tablets. [[Carbamazepine]], an anticonvulsive medication, has also had some success in this type of DI. Also, gestational DI tends to abate on its own four to six weeks following labor, though some women may develop it again in subsequent pregnancies. In dipsogenic DI, desmopressin is not usually an option.

===Nephrogenic===
Desmopressin will be ineffective in nephrogenic DI which is treated by reversing the underlying cause (if possible) and replacing the free water deficit. A [[thiazide diuretic]], such as [[chlorthalidone]] or [[hydrochlorothiazide]], can be used to create mild [[hypovolemia]] which encourages salt and water uptake in [[proximal tubule]] and thus improve nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Verbalis JG |title=Diabetes insipidus |journal=Rev Endocr Metab Disord |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=177–85 |date=May 2003 |pmid=12766546 |doi= 10.1023/A:1022946220908|s2cid=33533827 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amiloride]] has additional benefit of blocking Na uptake. Thiazide diuretics are sometimes combined with amiloride to prevent [[hypokalemia]] caused by the thiazides. It seems paradoxical to treat an extreme diuresis with a diuretic, and the exact mechanism of action is unknown but the thiazide diuretics will decrease [[distal convoluted tubule]] reabsorption of sodium and water, thereby causing diuresis. This decreases plasma volume, thus lowering the [[glomerular filtration rate]] and enhancing the absorption of sodium and water in the proximal nephron. Less fluid reaches the distal nephron, so overall fluid conservation is obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Loffing J | title = Paradoxical antidiuretic effect of thiazides in diabetes insipidus: another piece in the puzzle | journal = J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. | volume = 15 | issue = 11 | pages = 2948–50 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15504949 | doi = 10.1097/01.ASN.0000146568.82353.04 | url = http://jasn.asnjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15504949 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lithium-induced nephrogenic DI may be effectively managed with the administration of amiloride, a potassium-sparing diuretic often used in conjunction with thiazide or loop diuretics. Clinicians have been aware of lithium toxicity for many years, and traditionally have administered thiazide diuretics for lithium-induced polyuria and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. However, amiloride has recently been shown to be a successful treatment for this condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Finch CK, Kelley KW, Williams RB | title = Treatment of lithium-induced diabetes insipidus with amiloride | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 546–50 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12680486 | doi = 10.1592/phco.23.4.546.32121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;diabetes&quot; ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|aɪ|.|ə|ˈ|b|iː|t|iː|z}} or {{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|aɪ|.|ə|ˈ|b|iː|t|ᵻ|s}}) comes from [[Latin]] ''diabētēs'', which in turn comes from [[Ancient Greek]] διαβήτης (''diabētēs'') which literally means &quot;a passer through; a [[siphon]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED_diabetes&quot;&gt;Oxford English Dictionary. ''diabetes''. Retrieved 2011-06-10.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[physician]] [[Aretaeus of Cappadocia]] ([[Floruit|fl.]] in the first century [[Common Era|CE]]) used that word, with the intended meaning &quot;excessive discharge of urine&quot;, as the name for the disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;OnlineEtymology_diabetes&quot;&gt;{{cite web  | last = Harper  | first = Douglas  | title = Online Etymology Dictionary.

&quot;Insipidus&quot; comes from Latin language ''insipidus'' (tasteless), from Latin: ''in-'' &quot;not&quot; + ''sapidus'' &quot;tasty&quot; from ''sapere'' &quot;have a taste&quot; — the full meaning is &quot;lacking flavor or zest; not tasty&quot;. Application of this name to DI arose from the fact that diabetes insipidus does not cause [[glycosuria]] (excretion of glucose into the urine).

[[File:Tamerlano - Bajazet-Aria.jpg|thumb|The farewell aria of Sultan Bazajet in [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s opera ''[[Tamerlano]]''. (Note the ''[[da capo]]'' instruction.) First edition, London, 1719.]]
In music, an '''aria''' ({{IPA-it|ˈaːrja|}}; {{lang-it|[[Air (music)|air]]|links=no}}; [[plural]]: ''arie'' {{IPA-it|ˈaːrje|}}, or ''arias'' in common usage, diminutive form '''arietta''' {{IPA-it|aˈrjetta|}}, plural '''ariette''', or in English simply '''air''') is a self-contained piece for one voice, with or without [[instrument (music)|instrumental]] or [[orchestra]]l  [[accompaniment]], normally part of a larger work. An aria is a formal musical composition unlike its counterpart, the [[recitative]].

The typical context for arias is [[opera]], but vocal arias also feature in [[oratorio]]s and [[cantata]]s, sharing features of the operatic arias of their periods. The term was originally used to refer to any expressive [[melody]], usually, but not always, performed by a singer.

==Origins of the term==
The term, which derives from the Greek ἀήρ and Latin ''aer'' (air) first appeared in relation to music in the 14th century when it simply signified a manner or style of singing or playing. By the end of the 16th century, the term 'aria' refers to an instrumental form (cf. Santino Garsi da Parma lute works, 'Aria del Gran Duca'). By the early 16th century it was in common use as meaning a simple setting of [[strophe|strophic]] poetry; melodic [[madrigal]]s, free of complex [[polyphony]], were known as ''madrigale arioso''.&lt;ref&gt;Westrup et al. (n.d.), 1: Derivation&lt;/ref&gt;

==In opera==

===Aria form in late 17th century French and Italian opera===
In the context of staged works and concert works, arias evolved from simple melodies into structured forms. In such works, the sung, melodic, and structured aria became differentiated from the more speech-like (''[[wikt:parlando|parlando]]'') [[recitative]] – broadly, the latter tended to carry the story-line, the former carried more emotional freight and became an opportunity for singers to display their vocal talent.

The aria evolved typically in one of two forms. [[Binary form]] arias were in two sections (A–B); arias in [[ternary form]] (A–B–A) were known as ''[[da capo aria]]s'' (literally 'from the head', i.e. with the opening section repeated, often in a highly [[ornament (music)|decorated]] manner).&lt;ref&gt;Westrup et al. (n.d.), 2: Seventeenth century vocal music&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''da capo'' aria the 'B' episode would typically be in a different [[key (music)|key]] – the [[dominant (music)|dominant]] or [[relative major]] key. Other variants of these forms are found in the French operas of the late 17th century such as those of [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] which dominated the period of the French baroque; vocal solos in his operas (denominated of course by the French term, ''airs'') are frequently in extended binary form (ABB') or sometimes in ''[[rondo|rondeau]]'' form (ABACA),&lt;ref&gt;Anthony (1991), 202–205.&lt;/ref&gt; (a shape which is analogous to the instrumental [[rondo]]).

In the Italian school of composers of the late 17th and early 18th century, the ''da capo'' form of aria came gradually to be associated with the ''[[ritornello]]'' (literally, 'little return'), a recurring instrumental episode which was interspersed with the elements of the aria and eventually provided, in early operas, the opportunity for dancing or entries of characters.&lt;ref&gt;Talbot (n.d.); Solie (1977), 54–5&lt;/ref&gt; This version of aria form with ''ritornelli'' became a dominant feature of European opera throughout the 18th century. It is thought by some writers to be the origin of the instrumental forms of [[concerto]] and [[sonata form]].&lt;ref&gt;Solie (1977), 31. See also e.g. Rosen (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ritornelli'' became essential to the structure of the aria – &quot;while the words determine the character of a melody the ritornello instruments often decided in what terms it shall be presented.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1959), 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century===
By the early 18th century, composers such as [[Alessandro Scarlatti]] had established the aria form, and especially its da capo version with ritornelli, as the key element of ''[[opera seria]]''. &quot;It offered balance and continuity, and yet gave scope for contrast. [...] The very regularity of its conventional features enabled deviations from the normal to be exploited with telling effect.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1959), 96&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years of the century, arias in the Italian style began to take over in French opera, giving rise eventually to the French genre of ''ariette'', normally in a relatively simple ternary form.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony (1991) 213–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Types of operatic aria became known by a variety of terms according to their character – e.g.''aria parlante''  ('speaking-style', narrative in nature),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aria%20parlante Merriam-Webster dictionary online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202002217/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aria%20parlante |date=2013-02-02 }} accessed 21 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; ''aria di [[bravura]]'' (typically given to a heroine),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CEM|wstitle=Aria di bravura}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''aria buffa'' (aria of a comic type, typically given to a [[bass (voice type)|bass]] or [[bass-baritone]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webster-dictionary.org/definition/Aria%20buffa &quot;Aria buffa&quot;] in ''Webster's 1913 Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; and so on.

M. F. Robinson describes the standard aria in ''opera seria'' in the period 1720 to 1760 as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The first section normally began with an orchestral ritornello after which the singer entered and sang the words of the first [[stanza]] in their entirety. By the end of this first vocal paragraph the music, if it were in a [[major key]] as it usually was, had modulated to the [[dominant (music)|dominant]]. The orchestra then played a second ritornello usually shorter than the first. The singer re-entered and sang the same words through a second time. The music of this second paragraph was often slightly more elaborate than that of the first. There were more repeats of words and perhaps more florid vocalisations. The key worked its way back to the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] for the final vocal [[cadence (music)|cadence]] after which the orchestra rounded the section off with a final ritornello.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (1962) 34–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The nature and allocation of the arias to the different roles in ''opera seria'' was highly formalized. According to the playwright and [[librettist]] [[Carlo Goldoni]], in his autobiography, &lt;blockquote&gt;The three principal personages of the drama ought to sing five arias each; two in the first act, two in the second, and one in the third. The second actress and the second soprano can only have three, and the inferior characters must be satisfied with a single aria each, or two at the most. The author of the words must [...] take care that two pathetic [i.e. melancholy] arias do not succeed one another. He must distribute with the same precaution the bravura arias, the arias of action, the inferior arias, and the minuets and rondeaus. He must, above all things, avoid giving impassioned arias, bravura arias, or rondeaus, to inferior characters.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Robinson (1962) 33. (Translation slightly adapted).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By contrast, arias in ''[[opera buffa]]'' (comic opera) were often specific in character to the nature of the character being portrayed (for example the cheeky servant-girl or the irascible elderly suitor or guardian).&lt;ref&gt;Platoff (1990) 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

By later in the century it was clear that these formats were becoming fossilized. [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] thought that both ''opera buffa'' and ''opera seria'' had strayed too far from what opera should really be, and seemed unnatural. The jokes of ''opera buffa'' were threadbare and the repetition of the same characters made them seem no more than stereotypes. In ''opera seria'' the singing was devoted to superficial effects and the content was uninteresting and stale. As in ''opera buffa'', the singers were often masters of the stage and the music, decorating the vocal lines so floridly that audiences could no longer recognise the original melody. Gluck wanted to return opera to its origins, focusing on human drama and passions and making words and music of equal importance. The effects of these Gluckist reforms were seen not only in his own operas but in the later works of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]; the arias now become far more expressive of the individual emotions of the characters and are both more firmly anchored in, and advance, the storyline. [[Richard Wagner]] was to praise Gluck's innovations in his 1850 essay &quot;[[Opera and Drama]]&quot;: &quot; The musical composer revolted against the wilfulness of the singer&quot;; rather than &quot;unfold[ing] the purely sensuous contents of the Aria to their highest, rankest, pitch&quot;, Gluck sought &quot;to put shackles on Caprice's execution of that Aria, by himself endeavouring to give the tune [...] an expression answering to the underlying Word-text&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (1995) 26–7.&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude was to underlie Wagner's would-be deconstruction of aria in his concept of ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]''.

===19th century===
Despite the ideals of Gluck, and the trend to organise libretti so that arias had a more organic part in the drama rather than merely interrupting its flow, in the operas of the early 19th century, (for example those of [[Gioachino Rossini]] and [[Gaetano Donizetti]]), [[bravura]] arias remained focal attractions, and they continued to play a major role in [[grand opera]], and in Italian opera through the 19th century.

A favoured form of aria in the first half of the 19th century in Italian opera was the ''[[cabaletta]]'', in which a songlike ''cantabile'' section is followed by a more animated section, the ''cabaletta'' proper, repeated in whole or in part. Typically such arias would be preceded by [[recitative]], the whole sequence being termed a ''scena''. There might also be opportunities for participation by orchestra or chorus. An example is ''Casta diva'' from the opera ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'' of [[Vincenzo Bellini]].&lt;ref name=W51&gt;Westrup (n.d), §5.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

After around 1850, aria forms in Italian opera began to show more variety – many of the operas of [[Giuseppe Verdi]] offer extended narrative arias for leading roles that enable, in their scope, intensification of drama and characterisation. Examples include [[Rigoletto]]'s condemnation of the court, &quot;Cortigiani, vil razza dannata!&quot; (1851).&lt;ref name=W51 /&gt;

Later in the century, the post-1850 operas of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] were [[through-composed]], with fewer elements being readily identifiable as self-contained arias;&lt;ref&gt;Westrup (n.d), §5.2.&lt;/ref&gt; whilst the Italian genre of [[verismo]] opera also sought to integrate arioso elements although still allowing some 'show-pieces'.&lt;ref name=W51 /&gt;

'''''Knight Rider''''' is an American [[Action (fiction)|action]] [[crime drama]] [[television series]] created and produced by [[Glen A. Larson]]. The series was originally broadcast on [[NBC]] from 1982 to 1986. The show stars [[David Hasselhoff]] as [[Michael Knight (Knight Rider)|Michael Knight]], a high-tech, modern crime fighter assisted by [[KITT]], an advanced, [[Artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]], [[self awareness|self-aware]], and nearly indestructible  talking car. This was the last series Larson devised at [[Universal Television]] before he moved to [[20th Century Fox Television]].

==Plot==
Self-made billionaire Wilton Knight rescues police Detective Lieutenant Michael Arthur Long after a near fatal shot to the face, giving him a new identity (by plastic surgery) and a new name: [[Michael Knight (Knight Rider)|Michael Knight]]. Wilton selects Michael to be the primary field agent in the pilot program of his public justice organization, the Foundation for Law and Government (FLAG). The other half of this pilot program is the Knight Industries Two Thousand (KITT), a heavily modified, technologically advanced [[Pontiac Firebird (third generation)|Pontiac Firebird Trans Am]] with numerous features, including an extremely durable shell and frame, controlled by a computer with talking artificial intelligence. Michael and KITT are brought in during situations where &quot;direct action might provide the only feasible solution&quot;.

Heading FLAG is Devon Miles, who provides Michael with directives and guidance. Dr. Bonnie Barstow is the chief engineer in charge of KITT's care, as well as technical assistant to Devon (April Curtis fills this role in Season 2).

==Cast and characters==
* [[David Hasselhoff]] as [[Michael Knight (Knight Rider)|Michael Knight]] (born Michael Arthur Long), an undercover detective of [[Los Angeles Police Department]] who, while on a case in [[Las Vegas]], is shot in the face and nearly killed. Wilton Knight, creator of Knight Industries and founder of FLAG, directs his doctors to save Long's life and reconstruct his face. With his new identity, &quot;Michael Knight&quot;, Long is provided with high tech crime-fighting equipment, most notably the car named KITT. Hasselhoff also played Garthe Knight, Wilton Knight's estranged son and a criminal mastermind who drives Goliath, a semi tractor trailer [[Peterbilt]] 352 Pacemaker truck armed with rockets and protected by KITT's molecular bonded shell after the formula was stolen by Elizabeth Knight, Wilton's widow.
* [[William Daniels]] as the voice of [[KITT]], or Knight Industries Two Thousand, the autonomous, [[artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]] car, with whom Michael Knight is partnered. Daniels, who simultaneously starred on ''[[St. Elsewhere]],'' requested not to be credited for his role as KITT's voice.
* [[Edward Mulhare]] as Devon Miles, the leader of FLAG, who appeared in every episode to provide mission details to Knight and KITT. He was also the spokesman for FLAG whenever it came under scrutiny.
* [[Patricia McPherson]] as Dr. Bonnie Barstow (Seasons 1, 3-4), KITT's chief technician and romantic tension for Michael. The character was dropped after the first season, but due to strong fan reaction and lobbying by Hasselhoff and Mulhare, she was returned for the third season and remained through the end of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nugent|first=Nick|title=The Knight Rider Companion|date=December 2008|publisher=Will Garris Publishing|isbn=0-9774505-9-7|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rebecca Holden]] as April Curtis (Season 2), chief technician for KITT. The character was written out when Patricia McPherson returned. The connection between the two was never established in any installments.
* [[Peter Parros]] as Reginald Cornelius III aka RC3 (Season 4), driver of the FLAG mobile unit and occasional sideman for Michael and KITT.

{{main|KITT}}
The car used as [[KITT]] in the series was a customized 1982 [[Pontiac Firebird (third generation)|Pontiac Firebird Trans Am]] sports model, that cost US$100,000 to build&lt;ref&gt;Browning, Norma Lee. &quot;Riding High with Knight Rider&quot;, ''[[Toys R Us]]'' magazine; Vol. 1, No. 2; 1986; p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; (equivalent to about $266,000 in 2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=100%2C000.00&amp;year1=198201&amp;year2=201804|title=CPI Inflation Calculator |last= |first= |date= |website=Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Government |publisher=United States Government |accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nose, dash and other interior of the car were designed by the design consultant Michael Scheffe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carlustblog.com/2014/09/the-knight-industries-two-thousand-kitt-behind-the-scanner.html The Knight Industries Two Thousand – K.I.T.T.- Behind the Scanner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620163807/http://www.carlustblog.com/2014/09/the-knight-industries-two-thousand-kitt-behind-the-scanner.html |date=June 20, 2015 }} carlustblog.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The car that was also used as Knight Automated Roving Robot (K.A.R.R.) in the original Knight Rider series.  It was also a customized mechanically and cosmetically modified third generation 1982 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am like K.I.T.T.  K.A.R.R. was the evil vehicular clone of K.I.T.T in Season 1 and his evil return and last appearance in Season 3.

===Soundtrack===
The &quot;Knight Rider Theme&quot; was composed by [[Stu Phillips (composer)|Stu Phillips]] and Glen A. Larson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtdFPE.asp?ppn=MN0092317 &quot;Knight Rider Theme&quot; sheet music] at musicnotes.com&lt;/ref&gt; The series DVD bonus material contains an interview about this lead music, where Glen A. Larson says he remembers a theme out of a classical piece (&quot;Marche Et Cortège De Bacchus&quot; Act III - No. 14 from [[Sylvia (ballet)|Sylvia]] written by French composer [[Léo Delibes]]) from which he took pieces for the &quot;Knight Rider Theme&quot;.

The rest of the series music was composed by Stu Phillips for 13 episodes and Don Peake for 75 episodes. Glen A. Larson co-wrote music for one episode and [[Morton Stevens]] wrote the music for one episode.  Peake took over scoring duties at S1E14 in 1983, when Larson moved to [[Twentieth Century-Fox]] and Phillips was working there on his projects.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Revving It Up&quot;, liner notes, ''Knight Rider: The Stu Phillips Scores'', FSM Vol. 8, No. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Peake remained as the series sole composer until the end of the series in 1986, with the exception of &quot;K.I.T.T. vs. K.A.R.R.&quot; in third season, which he composed together with Stu Phillips and Glen A. Larson.

In 2005, FSM released a disc of music from the series, featuring the series theme, ad bumpers and Phillips' scores for &quot;Knight of the Phoenix&quot; (the pilot), &quot;Not a Drop to Drink&quot;, &quot;Trust Doesn't Rust&quot;, &quot;Forget Me Not&quot; and the composer's final episode &quot;Inside Out&quot;, as well as the logo music for Glen Larson Productions. Albums of Don Peake's scores have also been issued.

The intro throughout most of the episodes began with this narration:
{{bquote|Knight Rider, a shadowy flight into the dangerous world of a man who does not exist. &lt;br /&gt;
Michael Knight, a young loner on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent, the helpless, the powerless in a world of criminals who operate above the law.}}

During the first season, the outro was Michael and KITT driving though a road in the desert with Wilton Knight's words of &quot;One man can make a difference, Michael.&quot;

Then the narration goes on to say:&lt;br /&gt;
{{bquote|Michael Knight, a lone crusader in a dangerous world. The world of the Knight Rider.}}

The outro of Seasons 2 and 3 was Michael and KITT driving away from the sunset toward the camera. Season 4's outro was the same, except with KITT in Super Pursuit Mode.

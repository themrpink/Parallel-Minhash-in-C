==Transportation==

===Highways===
* [[Interstate 84 in New York|Interstate 84]] traverses the county in an east–west route cutting through the southern quadrant of the county. It is the only interstate highway in the county.
* [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US 9]], the [[Taconic State Parkway]], and [[New York State Route 22|NY 22]] are the main north–south roads in the county.
* [[U.S. Route 44 in New York|US 44]], [[New York State Route 55|NY 55]], and [[New York State Route 199|NY 199]] are the other main east–west roads in the county

===Railroads===
[[Amtrak]] has stations in [[Rhinecliff-Kingston (Amtrak station)|Rhinecliff]], a small hamlet in the Town of [[Rhinebeck (town), New York|Rhinebeck]], and [[Poughkeepsie (Metro-North station)|Poughkeepsie]], with both stations being served by [[Empire Service (Amtrak)|Empire Service]] trains as well as other trains that run along the line. The latter station is the terminus of the [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]] of the [[Metro-North Railroad]]. The Hudson Line also has station stops in [[New Hamburg (Metro-North station)|New Hamburg]] (a hamlet of the town of Poughkeepsie) and [[Beacon (Metro-North station)|Beacon]].

The [[Harlem Line]], on the eastern side of the county, has station stops in [[Pawling (Metro-North station)|Pawling]], [[Harlem Valley – Wingdale (Metro-North station)|Wingdale]], [[Dover Plains (Metro-North station)|Dover Plains]], and two stops in [[Wassaic, New York|Wassaic]] (one along the [[Tenmile River (Metro-North station)|Tenmile River]] and the other the [[Wassaic (Metro-North station)|namesake terminus of that line]]).

===Buses===
Public transportation in Dutchess County is handled by [[Dutchess County Public Transit]]. Outside of the urbanized area of the county, most service is limited. Privately run lines connect Poughkeepsie to [[New Paltz (village), New York|New Paltz]] and Beacon to Newburgh.

For intercity bus service, [[Leprechaun Lines]] and [[Short Line (bus company)|Short Line Bus]] also operate some service through Poughkeepsie, Rhinebeck, and the southern part of the county. The last time service ran outside that area was in the late-1990s when [[Peter Pan Bus Lines|Peter Pan/Bonanza]] ran service to New York City in the eastern part of the county.

===Air===
The [[Hudson Valley Regional Airport]], located in the town of [[Wappinger, New York|Wappinger]], is a general aviation facility that once had commercial service. The closest commercial airport, [[New York Stewart International Airport]], is located across the Hudson River in [[Newburgh, New York|Newburgh]].

Also located in the county is [[Sky Park Airport]], a public-use general aviation facility in [[Red Hook, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{FAA-airport|ID=46N|use=PU|own=PR|site=16009.*A}}. Federal Aviation Administration. Effective April 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:Fun at the Dutchess County Fair August 21, 2012.jpg|thumb|The Dutchess County Fair is an annual event]] 

Dutchess County holds an annual [[county fair]]. The County Chamber of Commerce holds an annual hot air balloon launch typically in the first week of July. The main launch sites are along the Hudson River. As many as 20 balloons participate in the event.

The [[Dutchess County Historical Society]] was formed in 1914 and is active in the preservation of a large collection at the 18th century [[Clinton House (Poughkeepsie, New York)|Clinton House]]. The Society has published a yearbook since 1914 and presents up to four awards of merit in the field of Dutchess County history each year.

===Media===
Dutchess County has no television stations. Its only news radio format station is [[WKIP (AM)]] of Poughkeepsie. [[WRHV]] is an [[NPR]] affiliated broadcasting out of Poughkeepsie. The [[country music]] format station, [[WRWB-FM]], broadcasting across the Hudson River, can be reached in much of the county.

''[[Poughkeepsie Journal]]'' is published in that city. ''Vassar Miscellany News,'' associated with Vassar College, is published weekly. Also published in the county is the ''Beacon Free Press''/''Southern Dutchess News.''

==Sports==
The [[Hudson Valley Renegades]] are a minor league baseball team affiliated with the [[Tampa Bay Rays]]. The team is a member of the [[New York–Penn League]], and play at [[Dutchess Stadium]] in [[Fishkill, New York|Fishkill]].

The [[Hudson Valley Bears]] were one of four founding members of the [[Eastern Professional Hockey League (2008)|Eastern Professional Hockey League (EPHL)]]. They played their home games at the [[Mid-Hudson Civic Center]] in Poughkeepsie.

The Hudson Valley Hawks was a team in the former [[National Professional Basketball League (2007-)|National Professional Basketball League]]. The team's home court was at Beacon High School, in [[Beacon, New York|Beacon]].

'''Moles''' are small [[mammal]]s adapted to a [[fossorial|subterranean lifestyle]] (i.e., ''fossorial''). They have cylindrical bodies, velvety fur, very small, inconspicuous ears and eyes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0011810 |title=Light Perception in Two Strictly Subterranean Rodents: Life in the Dark or Blue? |year=2010 |editor1-last=Iwaniuirst=Andrew |last1=Kott |first1=Ondřej |last2=Sumbera |first2=Radim |last3=Nemec |first3=Pavel |journal=PLOS One |volume=5 |issue=7 |pages=e11810 |pmid=20676369 |pmc=2911378|bibcode=2010PLoSO...511810K }}&lt;/ref&gt; reduced [[hindlimb]]s, and short, powerful [[forelimbs]] with large paws adapted for digging.

The term ''mole'' is especially and most properly used for &quot;true moles&quot; of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Talpidae]] in the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Eulipotyphla]], which are found in most parts of North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~campbelk/moledistribution.html |accessdate=11 March 2010 |title=Mole Distribution Maps |author=Campbell, Kevin |publisher=University of Manitoba |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324174320/http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~campbelk/moledistribution.html |archivedate=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europe and Asia, although it may also refer to unrelated mammals of [[Australia]] and southern [[Africa]] that have [[convergently evolved]] the &quot;mole&quot; [[body plan]]. The term is not applied to all ''talpids''; e.g., [[desman]]s and [[shrew mole]]s differ from the common definition of &quot;mole&quot;.

Moles are known pests to human activities such as agriculture, lawncare, and gardening. However, they do not eat plant roots; they only cause damage indirectly, as they eat earthworms and other small invertebrates in the soil. However, while moles may be viewed as pests, they do provide many positive contributions to the soil, gardens, and the ecosystem, including soil aeration, feeding on slugs and other small creatures that ''do'' eat plant roots, and providing prey for other wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arlton|first=A.V.|date=1936|title=An Ecological Study of the Mole.|journal= Journal of Mammalogy|jstor=1374401|volume=17|issue=4|pages=349–371|doi=10.2307/1374401}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://portal.dnb.de/opac.htm?method=simpleSearch&amp;cqlMode=true&amp;query=idn=1125129360|title=Ants and moles as ecosystem engineers: the role of small-scale disturbance for biodiversity in central European grasslands|last=Streitberger|first=Merle|date=2016|location=Osnabrück}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
In Middle English, moles were known as ''moldwarp''. The expression &quot;don't make a mountain out of a molehill&quot; (which means &quot;exaggerating problems&quot;) was first recorded in Tudor times.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Roper|Roper, William]] (1557) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofsirthomasm00ropeuoft ''Life of Sir Thomas More''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123104653/https://archive.org/details/lifeofsirthomasm00ropeuoft |date=23 January 2017 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the era of [[Early Modern English]], the mole was also known in English as ''mouldywarp'', a word having [[cognates]] in other [[Germanic languages]] such as [[German language|German]] (''Maulwurf''),&lt;ref&gt;[[Oliver Rackham|Rackham, Oliver]], ''The Illustrated History of the Countryside'' page 130 (quoting J. Seddon, ''The boke of surveying and improvments&lt;!--sic--&gt;'' – {{sic}}) {{ISBN|0-297-84335-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Swedish Language|Swedish]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] (''muldvarp'', ''mullvad'', ''moldvarpa''), where the ''muld/mull/mold'' part of the word means soil and the ''varp/vad/varpa'' part means throw, hence &quot;one who throws soil&quot; or &quot;dirt tosser&quot;.

Male moles are called &quot;boars&quot;, females are called &quot;sows&quot;. A [[Collective noun|group]] of moles is called a &quot;labour&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animalcorner.co.uk/britishwildlife/moles.html |title=Moles |publisher=animalcorner.co.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112035552/http://animalcorner.co.uk/britishwildlife/moles.html |archivedate=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Underground breathing===
Moles have been found to tolerate higher levels of carbon dioxide than other mammals, because their blood cells have a special form of [[hemoglobin]] that has a higher [[Ligand (biochemistry)#Receptor/ligand binding affinity|affinity]] to [[oxygen]] than other forms. In addition to this, moles utilize oxygen more effectively by reusing the exhaled air, and as a result, are able to survive in low-oxygen environments such as burrows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extra thumbs===
[[File:Talpa europaea MHNT pate.jpg|thumb|Mole [[paw]]]]
Moles have [[Polydactyly|polydactyl]] forepaws; each has an extra thumb (also known as a prepollex) next to the regular [[thumb]]. While the mole's other digits have multiple joints, the prepollex has a single, sickle-shaped bone that develops later and differently from the other fingers during [[embryogenesis]] from a transformed [[sesamoid bone]] in the [[wrist]], independently evolved but similar to the [[giant panda]] thumb. This supernumerary digit is species-specific, as it is not present in [[shrew]]s, the mole's closest relatives. [[Androgenic steroid]]s are known to affect the growth and formation of bones, and a connection is possible between this species-specific trait and the &quot;male&quot; genital apparatus in female moles of many mole species ([[gonad]]s with testicular and ovary tissues).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |access-date = 17 July 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diet==
A mole's diet primarily consists of [[earthworm]]s and other small invertebrates found in the soil. The mole runs are in reality &quot;worm traps&quot;, the mole sensing when a worm falls into the tunnel and quickly running along to kill and eat it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pest-management.co.uk/Moles.htm |title=Moles |publisher=Pest-management.co.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501122336/http://www.pest-management.co.uk/Moles.htm |archivedate=1 May 2009 |accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because their saliva contains a [[biotoxin|toxin]] that can paralyze earthworms, moles are able to store their still-living prey for later consumption. They construct special underground &quot;larders&quot; for just this purpose; researchers have discovered such larders with over a thousand earthworms in them. Before eating earthworms, moles pull them between their squeezed paws to force the collected earth and dirt out of the worm's gut.&lt;ref&gt;Attenborough, David (2002) ''[[The Life of Mammals]]''. Discovery Channel&lt;/ref&gt;

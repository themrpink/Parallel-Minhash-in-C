'''Alexandru Ioan Cuza''' ({{IPA-ro|alekˈsandru iˈo̯an ˈkuza|pron|Ro-Alexandru Ioan Cuza.ogg}}, or '''Alexandru Ioan I''', also anglicised as '''Alexander John Cuza'''; 20 March 1820 – 15 May 1873) was the first ''[[domnitor]]'' (Ruler) of the [[Romanian Principalities]] through his double election as [[prince of Moldavia]] on 5 January 1859 and [[prince of Wallachia]] on 2 January 1859. He was a prominent figure of the Revolution of 1848 in [[Moldavia]]. Following his double election, he initiated a series of reforms that contributed to the modernization of Romanian society and of state structures.

As ruler of the [[Romanian Principalities]], he supported a political and diplomatic activity for the recognition of the union of [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]] by the suzerain [[Ottoman Empire]] and achieved constitutional and administrative unity between [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]] in 1862, when the [[United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia|Romanian Principalities]] officially adopted the name ''Romanian United Principalities'' with a single capital at [[Bucharest]], a single national assembly and a single [[government]].

On the morning of 22 February 1866, a large coalition of conservatives and radical liberals, for the most part landowners and business owners dissatisfied with the reforms implemented and the policy of Alexandru Ioan Cuza, entered the royal palace with a group of officers and forced him to abdicate at a gunpoint.

==Early life==
Born in [[Bârlad]], Cuza belonged to the traditional [[boyar]] class in Moldavia, being the son of [[Ispravnic]] Ioan Cuza (who was also a landowner in [[Fălciu County]]) and his wife Sultana (or Soltana), a member of the [[Cozadini family]] of Greek [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] origins. Alexander received an urbane European education, becoming an officer in the [[Moldavian military forces|Moldavian Army]] (rising to the rank of [[colonel]]). He married [[Elena Cuza|Elena Rosetti]] in 1844.
In 1848, known as the [[Revolutions of 1848|year of European revolutions]], Moldavia and [[Wallachia]] fell into revolt. The [[1848 Moldavian revolution|Moldavian unrest]] was quickly suppressed, but in Wallachia the revolutionaries took power and governed during the summer (''see [[1848 Wallachian revolution]]''). Young Cuza played a prominent enough part so as to establish his [[Liberalism in Romania|liberal]] credentials during the Moldavian episode and to be shipped to Vienna as a prisoner, where he made his escape with British support.

[[File:CuzaHuNewspaper.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Hungarian newspaper ''Vasárnapi Ujság'' commented &quot;with sympathy and respect&quot; (Carol C. Koka)&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|ro}} [http://actualitateasm.ro/stiri/22661-publicatia-vasarnapi-ujsag-saluta-la-1859-dubla-alegere-a-lui-alexandru-ioan-cuza/ &quot;Publicația Vasárnapi Ujság saluta la 1859 dubla alegere a lui Alexandru Ioan Cuza&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Cuza's double election in Moldavia and Wallachia]]
Returned during the reign of [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince]] [[Grigore Alexandru Ghica]], he became Moldavia's minister of war in 1858 representing also [[Galați]] in the [[ad hoc Divan]] at [[Iași]]. Cuza was acting freely under the guarantees of the [[Great Power|European Powers]] in the eve of the [[Crimean War]] for a recognition of the Prince of Moldavia. Cuza was a prominent speaker in the debates and strongly advocated the union of Moldavia and Walachia. In default of a foreign prince, he was nominated as a candidate in both principalities by the pro-unionist [[Partida Națională]] (profiting of an ambiguity in the text of the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]]). Cuza was finally elected as Prince of Moldavia on 17 January 1859 (5 January [[Julian calendar|Julian]]) and, after &quot;street pressure&quot; changed the vote in [[Bucharest]], also Prince of Wallachia, on 5 February 1859 (24 January Julian). He received the firman from the Sultan on 2 December 1861 during a visit to Istanbul.
He was recipient of the [[Order of Medjidie]], [[Order of Osmanieh]], [[Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus]] and [[Order of the Redeemer]].

Although he and his wife [[Elena Cuza|Elena Rosetti]] had no children, she raised as her own children his two sons from his mistress [[Marija Obrenović|Elena Maria Catargiu-Obrenović]]: [[Alexandru Al. Ioan Cuza]] (1864–1889), and Dimitrie Cuza (1865–1888 ''suicide'').

==Reign==

===Diplomatic efforts===
[[File:Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Alexandru Ioan Cuza official portrait]]
[[File:RO, IS, Union Museum.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The residence of Prince Cuza in [[Iași]], one of the two capitals of the United Principalities between 1859 and 1862]]
Thus Cuza achieved a [[de facto]] union of the two principalities. The Powers backtracked, [[Napoleon III|Napoleon III of France]] remaining supportive, while the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] ministry withheld approval of such a union at the [[Congress of Paris]] (18 October 1858); partly as a consequence, Cuza's authority was not recognized by his nominal [[suzerain]], [[Abdülaziz of the Ottoman Empire|Abdülaziz]], the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], until 23 December 1861, (and, even then, the union was only accepted for the duration of Cuza's rule).

The union was formally declared three years later, on 5 February 1862, (24 January Julian), the new country bearing the name of Romania, with Bucharest as its capital city.

Cuza invested his diplomatic actions in gaining further concessions from the Powers: the sultan's assent to a [[Parliament of Romania|single unified parliament]] and [[Prime Minister of Romania|cabinet]] for Cuza's lifetime, in recognition of the complexity of the task. Thus, he was regarded as the political embodiment of a unified Romania.

===Reforms===

Assisted by his councilor [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]], an intellectual leader of the 1848 revolution, Cuza initiated a series of reforms that contributed to the modernization of Romanian society and of state structures.

[[File:Portrait of Alexandru Ioan Cuza by August Strixner.png|thumb|right|140px|Cuza in the 1860s; portrait by August Strixner]]
His first measure addressed a need for increasing the land resources and revenues available to the state, by [[Secularization of monastery estates in Romania|&quot;secularizing&quot; (confiscating) monastic assets]] in 1863.&lt;ref name=Stoica1&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoica|first=Vasile|title=The Roumanian Question: The Roumanians and their Lands|year=1919|publisher=Pittsburgh Printing Company|location=Pittsburgh|pages=69–70|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7314/view/1/69/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Probably more than a quarter of Romania's farmland was controlled by untaxed [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] &quot;[[Dedication|Dedicated]] Monasteries&quot;, which supported Greek and other foreign monks in shrines such as [[Mount Athos]] and Jerusalem (a substantial drain on state revenues). Cuza got his parliament's backing to expropriate these lands. He offered compensation to the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Greek Orthodox Church]], but [[Patriarch Sophoronius III of Constantinople|Sophronius III]], the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], refused to negotiate; after several years, the Romanian government withdrew its offer and no compensation was ever paid. State revenues thereby increased without adding any domestic tax burden.
The [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]], liberating peasants from the last [[corvée]]s, freeing their movements and redistributing some land (1864), was less successful.&lt;ref name=Stoica1/&gt; In attempting to create a solid support base among the peasants, Cuza soon found himself in conflict with the group of [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880-1918)|Conservatives]]. A liberal bill granting peasants title to the land they worked was defeated. Then the Conservatives responded with a bill that ended all peasant dues and responsibilities, but gave landlords title to all the land. Cuza vetoed it, then held a [[plebiscite]] to alter the Paris Convention (the virtual constitution), in the manner of Napoleon III.

[[File:Palatul de la Ruginoasa1.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The Al.I. Cuza family residence in [[Ruginoasa, Iaşi|Ruginoasa]]]]
His plan to establish [[universal manhood suffrage]], together with the power of the Domnitor to rule by decree, passed by a vote of 682,621 to 1,307. He consequently governed the country under the provisions of ''Statutul dezvoltător al Convenției de la Paris'' (&quot;Statute expanding the Paris Convention&quot;), an [[Constitution of Romania|organic law]] adopted on 15 July 1864. With his new plenary powers, Cuza then promulgated the Agrarian Law of 1863. Peasants received title to the land they worked, while landlords retained ownership of one third. Where there was not enough land available to create workable farms under this formula, state lands (from the confiscated monasteries) would be used to give the landowners compensation.

Despite the attempts by [[Lascăr Catargiu]]'s cabinet to force a transition in which some corvées were to be maintained, Cuza's reform marked the disappearance of the boyar class as a privileged group, and led to a channeling of energies into [[capitalism]] and [[industrialization]]; at the same time, however, land distributed was still below necessities, and the problem became stringent over the following decades – as peasants reduced to destitution sold off their land or found that it was insufficient for the needs of their growing families.

Cuza's reforms also included the adoption of the Criminal Code and the Civil Code based on the [[Napoleonic code]] (1864), a Law on Education, establishing tuition-free, compulsory public education for primary schools&lt;ref name=Stoica1/&gt; (1864; the system, nonetheless, suffered from drastic shortages in allocated funds; illiteracy was eradicated about 100 years later, during the communist regime). He founded the [[University of Iași]] (1860) and the University of Bucharest (1864), and helped develop a modern, European-style Romanian Army, under a working relationship with France. He is the founder of the Romanian Naval Forces.

==Downfall and exile==
[[File:Daumier30.05.1866.PNG|thumb|right|150px|A French perspective on the situation after Cuza's toppling, caricature by [[Honoré Daumier]] in ''[[Le Charivari]]'' (May 5, 1866). A character symbolising the [[Danubian Principalities]], looking on as the Foreign Powers charged with overseeing him quarrel: &quot;Oh, my! It looks as if they are no longer taking care of me at all!&quot;]]

Cuza failed in his effort to create an alliance of prosperous peasants and a strong liberal prince, ruling as a benevolent authoritarian in the style of Napoleon III. Having to rely on a decreasing group of hand-picked bureaucrats, Cuza began facing a mounting opposition after his land reform bill, with liberal landowners voicing concerns over his ability to represent their interests. Along with financial distress, there was an awkward scandal that revolved around his mistress, [[Marija Obrenović|Maria Catargiu-Obrenović]], and popular discontent culminated in a coup d'état.

Cuza was forced to abdicate by the so-called &quot;[[monstrous coalition]]&quot; of Conservatives and Liberals. At four o'clock on the morning of 22 February 1866, a group of military conspirators broke into the palace, and compelled the prince to sign his abdication. On the following day they conducted him safely across the frontier.

His successor, Prince [[Carol I of Romania|Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]], was proclaimed Domnitor as Carol I of Romania on 20 April 1866. The election of a foreign prince with ties to an important princely house, legitimizing Romanian independence (which Carol came to do after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877–1878|Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878]]), had been one of the liberal aims in the revolution of 1848.

Despite the participation of [[Ion Brătianu]] and other future leaders of the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|Liberal Party]] in the overthrow of Cuza, he remained a hero to the [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] and [[Republicanism|republican]] wing, who, as [[Francophile]]s, had an additional reason to oppose a [[Prussia]]n monarch; anti-Carol riots in Bucharest during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (''see [[History of Bucharest]]'') and the coup attempt known as the [[Republic of Ploiești]] in August 1870, the conflict was eventually resolved by the compromise between Brătianu and Carol, with the arrival of a prolonged and influential Liberal cabinet.

Cuza spent the remainder of his life in exile, chiefly in Paris, Vienna and Wiesbaden, accompanied by his wife and his two sons. He died in Heidelberg. His remains were buried in his residence in Ruginoasa, but were moved to the [[Trei Ierarhi Monastery|Trei Ierarhi Cathedral]] in Iași after World War II.

A '''browser engine''' ([[#Name and scope|also known as]] a '''layout engine''' or '''rendering engine''') is a core [[software component]] of every major [[web browser]]. The primary job of a browser engine is to transform [[HTML]] documents and other resources of a [[web page]] into an interactive visual representation on a [[User (computing)|user]]'s device.

==Name and scope==

A browser engine is not a stand-alone [[computer program]] but a critical piece of a larger program, such as a [[web browser]], from which the term is derived. (The word &quot;[[software engine|engine]]&quot; is an analogy to the engine of a car.)

Besides &quot;browser engine&quot;, two other terms are in common use regarding related concepts: &quot;layout engine&quot; and &quot;rendering engine&quot;.&lt;ref name=behindscene&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taligarsiel.com/Projects/howbrowserswork1.htm|title=Behind the scenes of modern web browsers|publisher=Tali Garsiel|accessdate=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gecko&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Gecko|title=Gecko|publisher=Mozilla|accessdate=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goanna&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = https://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=8607|title=Introducing Goanna|publisher=M.C. Straver|date=2015-06-22|accessdate=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In theory, [[layout (computing)|layout]] and [[wikt:rendering|rendering]] (or &quot;painting&quot;) could be handled by separate engines.  In practice, however, they are tightly [[coupling (computer programming)|coupled]] and rarely considered separately.

In addition to layout and rendering, a browser engine enforces the [[Content Security Policy|security policy]] between documents, handles navigation through [[hyperlink]]s and data submitted through [[form (HTML)|form]]s, and implements the [[Document Object Model]] (DOM) [[data structure]] exposed to page [[scripting language|scripts]].

Executing [[JavaScript]] (JS) code is a separate matter, however, as every major web browser uses a [[JavaScript engine|dedicated engine]] for this. The JS language was originally created for use in browsers, but it is now used elsewhere, too, so the implementation of JS engines is decoupled from browser engines. In a web browser, the two engines work in concert via the shared DOM data structure.

Browser engines are used in other types of programs besides web browsers. [[Email client]]s need them to display [[HTML email]]. The [[Electron (software framework)|Electron framework]], which is powered by the two engines of the [[Google Chrome]] browser, has been used to create many [[Application software|applications]].

==Layout and rendering==

The layout of a web page is typically specified by [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS). Each style sheet is a series of rules which the browser engine interprets. For example, some rules specify [[Web typography|typography]] details, such as [[font]], color, and text size. The engine combines all relevant CSS rules to calculate precise graphical coordinates for the visual representation it will paint on the screen.&lt;ref name=behindscene/&gt;

Some engines may begin rendering before all of a page's resources are downloaded. This can result in visual changes as more data is received, such as images being gradually filled in or a [[flash of unstyled content]].

Because the [[Web platform]] is a set of [[open standard]]s, there are multiple browser engine implementations.

[[Gecko (software)|Gecko]] is [[Mozilla]]'s browser engine, used in its [[Firefox]] web browser, the [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]] email client, and the [[SeaMonkey]] [[internet suite]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gecko&quot;/&gt; [[Goanna (software)|Goanna]] is a [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of Gecko used in the [[Pale Moon (web browser)|Pale Moon]] browser.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goanna&quot;/&gt;

[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] created the [[WebKit]] engine for its [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] browser by forking the [[KHTML]] engine of the [[KDE]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-980492.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025015655/http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-980492.html |title=Apple snub stings Mozilla |author=Paul Festa |publisher=[[CNET Networks]] |date=2003-01-14 |archivedate=2012-10-25 |accessdate=2017-02-16 |authorlink=Paul Festa |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Google]] originally used WebKit for its [[Google Chrome|Chrome]] browser but eventually forked it to create the [[Blink (browser engine)|Blink]] engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Bright |title=Google going its own way, forking WebKit rendering engine |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/google-going-its-own-way-forking-webkit-rendering-engine/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Conde Nast]] |date=April 3, 2013 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All [[Chromium (web browser)|Chromium]]-based browsers use Blink, as do [[application software|applications]] built with [[Chromium Embedded Framework|CEF]], [[Electron (software framework)|Electron]], or any other [[software framework|framework]] that embeds Chromium.

Although Apple permits third-party browsers as alternatives to Safari on [[iOS]] devices, all browsers distributed through its [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] must use WebKit as their engine. For example, [[Opera Mini]] for iOS uses WebKit, whereas all other [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] variants use Blink. (Opera formerly used its own [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[Presto (browser engine)|Presto]] engine.)

[[Microsoft]] maintains its own proprietary [[EdgeHTML]] engine, which is the successor of its [[Trident (layout engine)|Trident]] engine. However, EdgeHTML is now only used for [[Universal Windows Platform]] apps, as the [[Microsoft Edge|Edge]] browser has been remade with the Blink engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mackie |first1=Kurt |title=Microsoft Edge Browser To Get New Rendering Engine but EdgeHTML Continues |url=https://redmondmag.com/articles/2018/12/10/edgehtml-continues.aspx |website=Redmond Mag |date=10 December 2018 |accessdate=21 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/12/06/microsoft-edge-making-the-web-better-through-more-open-source-collaboration |title=Microsoft Edge: Making the web better through more open source collaboration |publisher=Microsoft |first=Joe |last=Belfiore |date=2018-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

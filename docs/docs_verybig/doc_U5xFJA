The Second Army altered its Corps frontages soon after the attack of 20 September, for the next effort {{nowrap|(26 September – 3 October)}} so that each attacking division could be concentrated on a {{cvt|1000|yd|m}} front. Roads and light railways were extended to the new front line, to allow artillery and ammunition to be moved forward. The artillery of [[VIII Corps (United Kingdom)|VIII Corps]] and [[IX Corps (United Kingdom)|IX Corps]] on the southern flank, simulated preparations for attacks on Zandvoorde and Warneton. At {{nowrap|5.50 a.m.}} on 26 September, five layers of barrage fired by British artillery and machine-guns began. Dust and smoke thickened the morning mist and the infantry advanced using compass bearings.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=284}} Each of the three German ground-holding divisions attacked on 26 September, had an {{lang|de|Eingreif}} division in support, twice the ratio of 20 September. No ground captured by the British was lost and German counter-attacks managed only to reach ground to which survivors of the front-line divisions had retired.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=293}}

===October–November===

====German counter-attacks, 30 September – 4 October====

{{main|Actions of 30 September – 4 October 1917}}

At {{nowrap|4:00 a.m.}} on 30 September, a thick mist covered the ground and at {{nowrap|4:30 a.m.}} German artillery began a bombardment between the Menin road and the Reutelbeek. At {{nowrap|5:15 a.m.,}} German troops emerged from the mist on an {{cvt|800|yd|m}} front.{{sfn|Sandilands|2003|pp=198–199}} The attack was supported by flame-throwers and German infantry throwing smoke- and hand-grenades. The British replied with small-arms fire and bombs, forcing the Germans to retreat in confusion but a post was lost south of the Menin road, then retaken by an immediate counter-attack. SOS rockets were not seen in the mist and the British artillery remained silent.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=301, 302}} The Germans were repulsed again at {{nowrap|6:00 a.m.}} but German artillery-fire continued during the day.{{sfn|Sandilands|2003|pp=198–199}}

On 1 October, at {{nowrap|5:00 a.m.,}} a German [[hurricane bombardment]] began from the Reutelbeek north to Polygon Wood and Black Watch Corner; by coincidence a Second Army practice barrage began at {{nowrap|5:15 a.m.}} The British front line was cut off and German infantry attacked in three waves at {{nowrap|5:30 a.m.}}{{sfn|Bean|1941|p=837}} Two determined German attacks were repulsed south of Cameron Covert, then at {{nowrap|7:00 p.m.}} German troops massed near the Menin road. The German attack was defeated by small-arms fire and the British artillery, whose observers had seen the SOS rockets. The British were forced out of Cameron Covert and counter-attacked but a German attack began at the same time and the British were repulsed. Another German attack failed and the German troops dug in behind some old German barbed wire; after dark, more German attacks around Cameron Covert failed.{{sfn|Sandilands|2003|pp=200–204}} North of the covert near Polygon Wood, deep mud smothered German shells before they exploded but they still caused many casualties. Communication with the rear was lost and the Germans attacked all day but British SOS rockets remained visible and the attacks took no ground; after dark German attacks were repulsed by another three SOS barrages.{{sfn|Atkinson|2009|pp=410–412}}

{{lang|de|Unternehmen Hohensturm}} (Operation High Storm) was planned by {{lang|de|Gruppe Ypern}} to recapture the Tokio Spur from Zonnebeke south to Molenaarelsthoek at the eastern edge of Polygon Wood on 3 October.{{sfn|Bean|1941|p=846}} The attacking infantry from the 45th Reserve and the 4th Guard divisions were commanded by Major Freiherr von Schleinitz in the north and Lieutenant-Colonel Rave in the south.{{sfn|Bean|1941|p=847}} After the costly failure of the methodical counter-attack ( {{lang|de|Gegenangriff}}) on 1 October, the attack was put back to 4 October, rehearsals taking place from 2 to 3 October.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=303–304}} On the night of {{nowrap|3/4 October,}} the German commanders had doubts about the attack but decided to proceed with the {{lang|de|Gegenangriff}}, warning the artillery to be ready to commence defensive bombardments.{{sfn|Bean|1941|p=858}} A contact patrol aircraft was arranged to fly over the area at {{nowrap|7:30 a.m.}}{{sfn|Bean|1941|p=847}}

====Battle of Broodseinde====

{{Main|Battle of Broodseinde}}

On 4 October, the British began the Battle of Broodseinde to complete the capture of the Gheluvelt Plateau and occupy Broodseinde Ridge. By coincidence, the Germans sought to recapture their defences around Zonnebeke with a {{lang|de|Gegenangriff}} at the same time.{{sfn|Prior|Wilson|1996|p=135}} The British attacked along a {{cvt|14000|yd|mi+km}} front and as the I Anzac Corps divisions began their advance towards Broodseinde Ridge, men were seen rising from shell-holes in no man's land and more German troops were found concealed in shell-craters. Most of the German troops of the [[45th Reserve Division (German Empire)|45th Reserve Division]] were overrun or retreated through the British barrage, then the Australians attacked pillboxes one-by-one and captured the village of Zonnebeke north of the ridge.{{sfnm|1a1=Bean|1y=1941|1pp=837, 847|2a1=Edmonds|2y=1991|2pp=304–307}} When the British barrage began on Broodseinde Ridge, the Keiberg Spur and Waterdamhoek, some of the German forward headquarters staffs only realised that they were under attack when British and Australian troops appeared.{{sfn|Bean|1941|pp=858–859}}

As news arrived of the great success of the attack, the head of GHQ Intelligence went to the Second Army headquarters to discuss exploitation. Plumer declined the suggestion, as eight fresh German divisions were behind the battlefield, with another six beyond them.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=316}} Later in the day, Plumer had second thoughts and ordered I Anzac Corps to push on to the Keiberg spur, with support from the II Anzac Corps. The II Anzac Corps commander wanted to advance north-east towards Passchendaele village but the I Anzac Corps commander preferred to wait until artillery had been brought up and supply routes improved. The X Corps commander proposed an attack northward from In de Ster into the southern flank of the Germans opposite I Anzac Corps. The 7th Division commander objected, due to uncertainty about the situation and the many casualties suffered by the 21st Division on the right flank and Plumer changed his mind again. During the morning, Gough had told the Fifth Army corps commanders to push on but when reports arrived of a repulse at 19 Metre Hill, the order was cancelled.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=315–317}}

====German defensive changes====

On 7 October, the 4th Army again dispersed its troops in the front defence zone. Reserve battalions moved back behind the artillery protective line and the {{lang|de|Eingreif}} divisions were organised to intervene as swiftly as possible once an attack commenced, despite the risk of British artillery-fire. Counter-battery fire to suppress the British artillery was to be increased, to protect the {{lang|de|Eingreif}} divisions as they advanced.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|p=309}} All of the German divisions holding front zones were relieved and an extra division brought forward, because the British advances had lengthened the front line. Without the divisions necessary for a counter-offensive south of the Gheluvelt Plateau towards Kemmel Hill, Rupprecht began to plan for a slow withdrawal from the Ypres Salient, even at the risk of uncovering German positions further north and on the Belgian coast.{{sfn|Sheldon|2007|pp=228–229}}{{efn|195th, 16th, 4th Bavarian, 18th, 227th, 240th, 187th and 22nd Reserve divisions).{{sfn|USWD|1920|nopp=y}}}}

====Battle of Poelcappelle====

{{Main|Battle of Poelcappelle}}

The French First Army and British Second and Fifth armies attacked on 9 October, on a {{cvt|13500|yd|mi+km}} front, from south of Broodseinde to St Jansbeek, to advance half of the distance from Broodseinde ridge to Passchendaele, on the main front, which led to many casualties on both sides. Advances in the north of the attack front were retained by British and French troops but most of the ground taken in front of Passchendaele and on the Becelaere and Gheluvelt spurs was lost to German counter-attacks.{{sfn|Bean|1941|p=887}} General [[William Birdwood, 1st Baron Birdwood|William Birdwood]] later wrote that the return of heavy rain and mud sloughs was the main cause of the failure to hold captured ground. Kuhl concluded that the fighting strained German fighting power to the limit but that the German forces managed to prevent a breakthrough, although it was becoming much harder to replace losses.{{sfn|Terraine|1977|pp=287–288}}

====First Battle of Passchendaele====

{{Main|First Battle of Passchendaele}}

[[File:Passchendaele aerial view.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Aerial view of Passchendaele village before and after the battle}}]]
The First Battle of Passchendaele on 12 October was another Allied attempt to gain ground around Passchendaele. Heavy rain and mud again made movement difficult and little artillery could be brought closer to the front. Allied troops were exhausted and morale had fallen. After a modest British advance, German counter-attacks recovered most of the ground lost opposite Passchendaele, except for an area on the right of the Wallemolen spur. North of Poelcappelle, the XIV Corps of the Fifth Army advanced along the Broembeek some way up the Watervlietbeek and the Stadenrevebeek streams and the Guards Division captured the west end of the Vijwegen spur, gaining observation over the south end of Houthulst Forest.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=341–344}} There were {{nowrap|13,000 Allied}} casualties, including {{nowrap|2,735 New}} Zealanders, {{nowrap|845 of}} whom were dead or stranded in the mud of no-man's-land; it was one of the worst days in New Zealand military history.{{sfn|Liddle|1997|p=285}}&lt;!--including {{nowrap|about 3,700 New}} Zealanders, {{nowrap|842 of}} whom were dead or stranded in the mud of no-man's-land;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/war/western-front-1917#heading5|title=1917: Arras, Messines and Passchendaele – 1917: Arras, Messines and Passchendaele – NZHistory, New Zealand history online|website=nzhistory.govt.nz|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;need printed sources for this if possible--&gt;

At a conference on 13 October, Haig and the army commanders agreed that attacks would stop until the weather improved and roads could be extended, to carry more artillery and ammunition forward. The offensive was to continue, to reach a suitable line for the winter and to keep German attention on Flanders, with a French attack due on 23 October and the Third Army operation south of Arras scheduled for mid-November.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=345–346}} The battle was also costly for the Germans, who lost more than {{nowrap|1,000 prisoners.}}{{sfn|Boraston|1920|p=130}} The German 195th Division at Passchendaele suffered {{nowrap|3,325}} casualties from 9 to 12 October and had to be relieved by the 238th Division.{{sfn|Sheldon|2007|p=236}} Ludendorff became optimistic that Passchendaele Ridge could be held and ordered the 4th Army to stand fast.{{sfn|Sheldon|2007|p=233}} On 18 October, Kuhl advocated a retreat as far to the east as possible; Armin and Loßberg wanted to hold on, because the ground beyond the Passchendaele [[Drainage divide|watershed]] was untenable, even in winter.{{sfn|Terraine|1977|p=305}}

==== Action of 22 October ====
{{main|Action of 22 October 1917}}

On 22 October the 18th (Eastern) Division of XVIII Corps attacked the east end of Poelcappelle as XIV Corps to the north attacked with the 34th Division between the Watervlietbeek and Broenbeek streams and the 35th Division northwards into [[Houthulst|Houthulst Forest]]. The attack was supported by a regiment of the French 1st Division on the left flank of the 35th Division and was intended to obstruct a possible German counter-attack on the left flank of the Canadian Corps as it attacked Passchendaele and the ridge. The artillery of the Second and Fifth armies conducted a bombardment to simulate a general attack as a deception. Poelcappelle was captured but the attack at the junction between the 34th and 35th divisions was repulsed. German counter-attacks pushed back the 35th Division in the centre but the French attack captured all its objectives. Attacking on ground cut up by bombardments and soaked by rain, the British had struggled to advance in places and lost the ability to move quickly to outflank pillboxes. The 35th Division reached the fringe of Houthulst Forest but was outflanked and pushed back in places. German counter-attacks made after 22 October, were at an equal disadvantage and were costly failures. The German 4th Army was prevented from transferring troops away from the Fifth Army and from concentrating its artillery-fire on the Canadians as they prepared for the Second Battle of Passchendaele (26 October – 10 November 1917).{{sfn|Perry|2014|pp=475–486}}

====Battle of La Malmaison====

{{Main|Battle of La Malmaison}}

After numerous requests from Haig, Petain began the Battle of La Malmaison, a long-delayed French attack on the Chemin des Dames, by the Sixth Army (General [[Paul Maistre]]). The artillery preparation started on 17 October and on 23 October, the German defenders were swiftly defeated and the French advanced up to {{cvt|3.7|mi|km}}, capturing the village and fort of La Malmaison, gaining control of the Chemin des Dames ridge.{{sfn|Terraine|1977|p=307}} The Germans lost {{nowrap|38,000 men}} killed or missing and {{nowrap|12,000 prisoners,}} along with {{nowrap|200 guns}} and {{nowrap|720 machine-guns,}} against {{nowrap|14,000 French}} casualties, fewer than a third of the German total.{{sfn|Philpott|2014|p=279}} The Germans had to withdraw from their remaining positions on the Chemin des Dames to the north of the Ailette Valley early in November. Haig was pleased with the French success but regretted the delay, which had lessened its effect on the Flanders operations.{{sfn|Terraine|1977|p=307}}

====Second Battle of Passchendaele====

{{Main|Second Battle of Passchendaele}}

[[File:Second Battle of Passchendaele - Barbed wire and Mud.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Terrain through which the Canadian Corps advanced at Passchendaele, in late 1917}}]]
[[File:Landscape Passendale Tyne Cot 2.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Terrain at Passchendaele near where the Canadian Corps advanced, spring 2015}}]]
The British [[Fifth Army (United Kingdom)|Fifth Army]] undertook minor operations from {{nowrap|20–22 October,}} to maintain pressure on the Germans and support the French attack at La Malmaison, while the Canadian Corps prepared for a series of attacks from {{nowrap|26 October – 10 November.}}{{sfnm|1a1=Bean|1y=1941|1p=930|2a1=Edmonds|2y=1991|2p=347}} The four divisions of the Canadian Corps had been transferred to the [[Ypres Salient]] from Lens, to capture Passchendaele and the ridge.{{sfn|Bean|1941|p=929}} The Canadians relieved the [[II Anzac Corps]] on 18 October and found that the front line was mostly the same as that occupied by the [[1st Canadian Division]] in April 1915. The Canadian operation was to be three limited attacks, on 26 October, 30 October and 6 November.{{sfn|Nicholson|1964|pp=312, 314}} On 26 October, the 3rd Canadian Division captured its objective at Wolf Copse, then swung back its northern flank to link with the adjacent division of the Fifth Army. The 4th Canadian Division captured its objectives but was forced slowly to retire from Decline Copse, against German counter-attacks and communication failures between the Canadian and Australian units to the south.{{sfn|Nicholson|1964|p=320}}

The second stage began on 30 October, to complete the previous stage and gain a base for the final assault on Passchendaele. The attackers on the southern flank quickly captured Crest Farm and sent patrols beyond the final objective into Passchendaele. The attack on the northern flank again met with exceptional German resistance. The 3rd Canadian Division captured Vapour Farm on the corps boundary, Furst Farm to the west of Meetcheele and the crossroads at Meetcheele but remained short of its objective. During a seven-day pause, the Second Army took over another section of the Fifth Army front adjoining the Canadian Corps. Three rainless days from {{nowrap|3–5 November}} eased preparation for the next stage, which began on the morning of 6 November, with the 1st Canadian Division and the [[2nd Canadian Division]]. In fewer than three hours, many units reached their final objectives and Passchendaele was captured. The Canadian Corps launched a final action on 10 November, to gain control of the remaining high ground north of the village near {{nowrap|Hill 52.}}{{sfnm|1a1=Nicholson|1y=1964|1pp=320–325|2a1=Sheldon|2y=2007|2pp=311–312}}{{efn|German troops engaged were from the 239th, 39th, 4th, 44th Reserve, 7th, 11th, 11th Bavarian, 238th, 199th, 27th, 185th, 111th and 40th divisions.{{sfn|USWD|1920|nopp=y}}}}

===December===

====Night action of 1/2 December 1917====

{{main|Night action of 1/2 December 1917}}

On 18 November the VIII Corps on the right and II Corps on the left (northern) side of the Passchendaele Salient took over from the Canadian Corps. The area was subjected to constant German artillery bombardments and its vulnerability to attack led to a suggestion by Brigadier C. F. Aspinall, that either the British should retire to the west side of the Gheluvelt Plateau or advance to broaden the salient towards Westroosebeke. Expanding the salient would make the troops in it less vulnerable to German artillery-fire and provide a better jumping off line for a resumption of the offensive in the spring of 1918. The British attacked towards Westroozebeke on the night of 1/2 December but the plan to mislead the Germans by not bombarding the German defences until eight minutes after the infantry began their advance came undone. The noise of the British assembly and the difficulty of moving across muddy and waterlogged ground had also alerted the Germans. In the moonlight, the Germans had seen the British troops when they were still {{cvt|200|yd|m}} away. Some ground was captured and about {{nowrap|150 prisoners}} were taken but the attack on the redoubts failed and observation over the heads of the valleys on the east and north sides of the ridge was not achieved.{{sfn|LoCicero|2011|pp=155–338}}

====Action on the Polderhoek Spur====

{{main|Action on the Polderhoek Spur}}

The attack on the Polderhoek Spur on 3 December 1917, was a local operation by the British [[Fourth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourth Army]] (renamed from the Second Army on 8 November). Two battalions of the [[2nd Infantry Brigade (New Zealand)|2nd New Zealand Brigade]] of the [[New Zealand Division]] attacked the low ridge, from which German observers could view the area from Cameron Covert to the north and the Menin road to the south-west. A New Zealand advance of {{cvt|600|yd|m}} on a {{cvt|400|yd|m}} front, would shield the area north of the Reutelbeek stream from German observers on the Gheluvelt spur. Heavy artillery bombarded the ruins of Polderhoek Château and the pillboxes in the grounds to mislead the defenders and the attack was made in daylight as a ruse to surprise the Germans, who would be under cover sheltering from the routine bombardments. Smoke and gas bombardments on the Gheluvelt and Becelaere spurs on the flanks and the infantry attack began at the same time as the &quot;routine&quot; bombardment. The ruse failed, some British artillery-fire dropped short on the New Zealanders and the Germans engaged the attackers with small-arms fire from Polderhoek Spur and Gheluvelt ridge. A strong west wind ruined the smoke screens and the British artillery failed to suppress the German machine-guns. New Zealand machine-gunners repulsed a counter-attack but the New Zealand infantry were {{cvt|150|yd|m}} short of the first objective; another attempt after dark was cancelled because of the full moon and the arrival of German reinforcements.{{sfn|Stewart|2014|pp=304–314}}

In a German General Staff publication, it was written that &quot;Germany had been brought near to certain destruction ({{lang|de|sicheren Untergang}}) by the Flanders battle of 1917&quot;.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=xiii}} In his ''Memoirs'' of 1938, Lloyd George wrote, &quot;Passchendaele was indeed one of the greatest disasters of the war&amp;nbsp;... No soldier of any intelligence now defends this senseless campaign&amp;nbsp;...&quot;.{{sfn|Terraine|1977|pp=xix–xx}} In 1939, G. C. Wynne wrote that the British had eventually reached Passchendaele Ridge and captured {{lang|de|Flandern I Stellung}} but beyond them were {{lang|de|Flandern II Stellung}} and {{lang|de|Flandern III Stellung}}. The German submarine bases on the coast had not been captured but the objective of diverting the Germans from the French further south, while they recovered from the Nivelle Offensive in April, had succeeded.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|pp=214–215}} In 1997, Paddy Griffith wrote that the ''bite and hold'' system kept moving until November, because the BEF had developed a workable system of offensive tactics, against which the Germans ultimately had no answer.{{sfn|Liddle|1997|p=71}} A decade later, Jack Sheldon wrote that relative casualty figures were irrelevant, because the German army could not afford the losses or to lose the initiative by being compelled to fight another defensive battle on ground of the Allies' choosing. The Third Battle of Ypres had pinned the German army to Flanders and caused unsustainable casualties.{{sfn|Sheldon|2007|pp=313–317}}

In 2018, Jonathan Boff wrote that after the war the {{lang|de|Reichsarchiv}} official historians, many of whom were former staff officers, wrote of the tactical changes after 26 September and their scrapping after the Battle of Broodseinde on 4 October, as the work of Loßberg. By blaming an individual, the rest of the German commanders were exculpated, which gave a false impression that OHL operated in a rational manner, when Ludendorff imposed another defensive scheme on 7 October. Boff wrote that this narrative was facile and that it avoided the problem faced by the Germans in late 1917. OHL had issued orders to change tactics again days before Loßberg was blamed for giving new orders to the 4th Army. Boff also doubted that all of the divisions in Flanders could act on top-down changes. The 119th Division was in the front line from 11 August to 18 October and replied that new tactics were difficult to implement due to lack of training. The tempo of British attacks and the effect of attrition meant that although six divisions were sent to the 4th Army by 10 October, they were either novice units deficient in training or veteran formations with low morale after earlier defeats; good divisions had been diluted with too many replacements. Boff wrote that the Germans consciously sought tactical changes for an operational dilemma for want of an alternative. On 2 October, Rupprecht had ordered the 4th Army HQ to avoid over-centralising command, only to find that Loßberg had issued an artillery plan detailing the deployment of individual batteries.{{sfn|Boff|2018|pp=181–182}}

At a British conference on 13 October, the Third Army (General [[Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy|Julian Byng]]) scheme for an attack in mid-November was discussed. Byng wanted the operations at Ypres continued, to hold German troops in Flanders.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=345–346}} The [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] began on 20 November and the British breached the first two parts of the [[Hindenburg Line]], in the first successful mass use of [[tank]]s in a [[combined arms]] operation.{{sfn|Harris|1995|pp=124–125}} The experience of the failure to contain the British attacks at Ypres and the drastic reduction in areas of the western front that could be considered &quot;quiet&quot; after the tank and artillery surprise at Cambrai, left the OHL with little choice but to return to a strategy of decisive victory in 1918.{{sfn|Sheldon|2009|p=312}} On 24 October, the Austro-German 14th Army ({{lang|de|General der Infanterie}} [[Otto von Below]]), attacked the Italian Second Army on the Isonzo at the [[Battle of Caporetto]] and in 18 days, inflicted casualties of {{nowrap|650,000 men}} and {{nowrap|3,000 guns.}}{{sfn|Miles|1991|p=15}} In fear that Italy might be put out of the war, the French and British governments offered reinforcements.{{sfn|Bean|1941|pp=935–936}} British and French troops were swiftly moved from {{nowrap|10 November – 12 December}} but the diversion of resources from the BEF forced Haig to conclude the Third Battle of Ypres short of [[Westrozebeke]]; the last substantial British attack took place on 10 November.{{sfn|Bean|1941|p=936}}

===Casualties===

Various casualty figures have been published for the Third Battle of Ypres, sometimes with acrimony; the highest estimates for British and German casualties appear to be discredited but the British claim to have taken {{nowrap|24,065 prisoners}} has not been disputed.{{sfnm|1a1=McRandle|1a2=Quirk|1y=2006|1pp=667–701|2a1=Boraston|2y=1920|2p=133}} In 1940, [[C. R. M. F. Cruttwell]] recorded {{nowrap|300,000 British}} casualties and {{nowrap|400,000 German.}}{{sfn|Cruttwell|1982|p=442}} In the History of the Great War volume ''Military Operations....'' published in 1948, [[James E. Edmonds|James Edmonds]] put British casualties {{nowrap|at 244,897}} and wrote that equivalent German figures were not available, estimating German losses {{nowrap|at 400,000.}}{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=360–365}}{{efn|For British losses, Edmonds used data based on figures submitted by the Adjutant-General's Department to the Allied Supreme War Council on 25 February 1918; Edmonds also showed weekly returns to GHQ, giving a slightly lower total of {{nowrap|238,313.}} Edmonds wrote that whereas the true figure for British casualties on the Somme had been approximately {{nowrap|420,000, the}} Germans had announced that the British had suffered {{nowrap|600,000 casualties,}} which was close to what Edmonds believed to be the &quot;true&quot; number for German Somme casualties (582,919). The Bavarian Official History had put British casualties at the Third Battle of Ypres at {{nowrap|400,000,}} which Edmonds believed raised &quot;suspicion&quot; that this was the number of German casualties. Edmonds wrote that the German Official Account ({{lang|de|Der Weltkrieg}}) put German 4th Army casualties (21 July – 31 December) at {{nowrap|approximately 217,000.}} Edmonds considered that 30 percent needed to be added to German figures, to make them comparable to British casualty recording criteria, which would amount to {{nowrap|289,000 casualties.}} Edmonds wrote that this did not include units which served only briefly in the 4th Army or units that were not part of it. Edmonds wrote that German divisions had an average strength of {{nowrap|12,000 men}} and tended to be relieved after suffering about {{nowrap|4,000 casualties.}} As Crown Prince Rupprecht recorded 88 German divisions fighting in the battle and after deducting {{nowrap|15,000 German}} casualties from 15 June to 30 July, the Germans must have suffered around {{nowrap|337,000 casualties.}} The average German battalion strength dropped to {{nowrap|640 men}} despite &quot;allowing {{nowrap|100 men}} reinforcements per battalion&quot;, suggesting {{nowrap|364,320 casualties.}} Edmonds wrote &quot;there seems every probability that the Germans lost about 400,000&quot;.{{sfn|Terraine|2005|p=372}}{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=360–365}}}} [[A. J. P. Taylor]] wrote in 1972 that no one believed Edmonds' &quot;farcical calculations&quot;. Taylor put British wounded and killed at {{nowrap|300,000 and}} German losses at {{nowrap|200,000,}} &quot;a proportion slightly better than the Somme&quot;.{{sfn|Taylor|1972|pp=181–182}} In 2007, Jack Sheldon wrote that although German casualties from 1 June to 10 November {{nowrap|were 217,194,}} a figure available in Volume III of the {{lang|de|Sanitätsbericht}} (Medical Report, 1934), Edmonds may not have included these data as they did not fit his case, using the phrases &quot;creative accounting&quot; and &quot;cavalier handling of the facts&quot;. Sheldon wrote that the German casualties could only be brought up to {{nowrap|399,590}} by including the {{nowrap|182,396 soldiers}} who were sick or treated at regimental aid posts for &quot;minor cuts and wounds&quot; but ''not struck off unit strength''; Sheldon wrote &quot;it is hard to see any merit&quot; in doing so.{{sfn|Sheldon|2007|pp=313–315, 319}}

Leon Wolff, writing in 1958, gave German casualties as {{nowrap|270,713}} and British casualties as {{nowrap|448,688.}}{{sfn|Wolff|1958|p=259}} Wolff's British figure was refuted by [[John Terraine]] in a 1977 publication. Despite writing that {{nowrap|448,614 British}} casualties was the BEF total for the second half of 1917, Wolff had neglected to deduct {{nowrap|75,681 casualties}} for the Battle of Cambrai, given in the ''Official Statistics'' from which he quoted or &quot;normal wastage&quot;, averaging {{nowrap|35,000 per}} month in &quot;quiet&quot; periods.{{sfn|Terraine|1977|pp=344–345}} In 1959, [[Cyril Falls]] estimated {{nowrap|240,000 British,}} {{nowrap|8,525 French}} and {{nowrap|260,000 German}} casualties.{{sfn|Falls|1959|p=303}} In his 1963 biography of Haig, Terraine accepted Edmonds' figure of {{nowrap|244,897 British}} casualties and agreed that German losses were at least equal to and probably greater than British, owing to the strength of British artillery and the high number of German counterattacks; he did not accept Edmonds' calculation that German losses were as high {{nowrap|as 400,000.}}{{sfn|Terraine|2005|p=372}} In his 1977 work, Terraine wrote that the German figure ought to be increased because their statistics were incomplete and because their data omitted some lightly wounded men, who would have been included under British casualty criteria, revising the German figure by twenty per cent, which made German casualties {{nowrap|260,400.}}{{sfn|Terraine|1977|pp=344–345}} Prior and Wilson, in 1997, gave British losses of {{nowrap|275,000 and}} German casualties at just {{nowrap|under 200,000.}}{{sfn|Prior|Wilson|1996|p=195}} In 1997, Heinz Hagenlücke gave {{circa|217,000 German}} casualties.{{sfn|Liddle|1997|pp=45–58}} [[Gary Sheffield (historian)|Gary Sheffield]] wrote in 2002 that [[Richard Holmes (military historian)|Richard Holmes]] guessed that both sides suffered {{nowrap|260,000 casualties,}} which seemed about right to him.{{sfn|Sheffield|2002|p=216}}

===Subsequent operations===

====Winter, 1917–1918====

The area to the east and south of the ruins of Passchendaele village was held by posts, those to the east being fairly habitable, unlike the southern ones; from Passchendaele as far back as Potijze, the ground was far worse. Each brigade spent four days in the front line, four in support and four in reserve. The area was quiet apart from artillery-fire and in December the weather turned cold and snowy, which entailed a great effort to prevent [[trench foot]]. In January, spells of freezing cold were followed by warmer periods, one beginning on 15 January with torrential rain and gale-force winds, washing away plank roads and [[duckboard]] tracks.{{sfn|Boraston|Bax|1999|pp=167–168}} Conditions in the salient improved with the completion of transport routes and the refurbishment of German pillboxes. Both sides raided and the British used night machine-gun fire and artillery barrages to great effect.{{sfn|Seton Hutchinson|2005|pp=79–80}} On the evening of 3 March 1918, two companies of the 8th Division raided Teal Cottage, supported by a smoke and shrapnel barrage, killed many of the garrison and took six prisoners for one man wounded.{{sfn|Boraston|Bax|1999|p=171}} A German attack on 11 March was repulsed; after that the Germans made no more attacks, keeping up frequent artillery bombardments and machine-gun fire instead.{{sfn|Gillon|2002|pp=180–183}} When the German armies further south began the [[Spring Offensive]] on 21 March 1918, &quot;good&quot; divisions in Flanders were sent south; the 29th Division was withdrawn on 9 April and transferred to the Lys.{{sfnm|1a1=Seton Hutchinson|1y=2005|1p=80|2a1=Gillon|2y=2002|2p=186}}

[[File:Газ-61.JPG|thumb|1938–1945 [[GAZ-61]]]]

Just before and during [[World War II]], prototypes and low-volume production examples of cars with sedan or station-wagon type bodies and rugged, off-road capable four-wheel drive chassis began to appear around the world. These early models included the 1936 [[Kurogane Type 95]] from Japan, the 1938 [[GAZ-61]] from Russia, and the 1941 [[Volkswagen Kommandeurswagen]] and 1936 [[Opel Geländesportwagen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carlsson|first1=Mårten|url=http://www.klassiker.nu/reportage/opel-terrangsportbil|title=Opel Terrängsportbil|trans-title=Opel Off-Road Car|work=Klassiker|location=Sweden|language=sv|date=26 June 2018|access-date=11 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Germany. An early predecessor to the design of modern SUVs{{citation needed|date=April 2019|reason=Needs reference to support claimed link}} was the 1940 Humber Heavy Utility, a four-wheel drive off-road vehicle built on the chassis of the [[Humber Super Snipe]] passenger car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10 Strange Military Vehicles of World War II|url=https://www.wonderslist.com/10-strange-military-vehicles-world-war-ii/|website=Wonderslist|access-date=2019-04-10|date=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most prohibitive initial factors to the potential civilian popularity of an SUV-like car was their cost and the availability of certain critical parts. Before the war, adding four-wheel drive to a car almost doubled its cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourwheeler.com/features/origins-of-the-jeep-birthing-a-75-year-legend/|title=Origins Of The Jeep: Birthing A 75-Year Legend|first=Jim|last=Allen|author-link=Jim Allen (4x4 writer)|work=Four Wheeler Network|location=U.S.|date=2016-01-10|access-date=2019-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to a common, rear-wheel drive vehicle, any 4WD (four-wheel drive) needed a number of essential extra components, including a [[transfer case]] and a second differential and [[constant-velocity joint]]s for the driven front axle—which were expensive due to the precision involved in manufacturing gears and other parts. In America prior to World War{{Nbsp|1}}II, these were produced only by a few specialized firms with limited production capacity. Due to the increase in demand for parts for the war effort, in the spring of 1942 [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Dodge]] and [[Chevrolet]] joined in fabricating these parts in mass quantities, boosting their production more than 100-fold.&lt;ref name=ThomsonMayo&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomson|first1=Harry C.|first2=Lida|last2=Mayo|year=2003|title=The Ordnance Department: procurement and supply|url= https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112055126327;view=1up;seq=298;size=125|location=Washington, D.C.|via=United States Army Center of Military History|publication-date=1960|publisher=Office of the Chief of Military History, Dept. of the Army|page=274|ref=ODprocure}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early usage of the term was the 1947 [[Crosley#Model summary|Crosley CC Four]] Sport Utility model, which used a convertible wagon body style and is therefore unrelated to the design of later SUVs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2014/5/26/1302054/-History-101-The-Crosley-Automobile|title=History 101: The Crosley Automobile|website=Daily KOS|location=U.S.|date=2014-05-26|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://crosleyautoclub.com/Details/Details_CCs.html|title=Details on Crosley CC Models 1946 - 1948|website=Crosley Automobile Club|location=U.S.|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.classiccarcatalogue.com/CROSSLEY%201948.html|title=Crosley 1948|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223210336/http://www.classiccarcatalogue.com/CROSSLEY%201948.html|archive-date=2018-02-23|via=Classic Car Catalogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several models of [[Carryall#Automobile|carryall]] wagons began to be offered with four-wheel drive, beginning in 1949 when the [[Willys Jeep Station Wagon]] introduced the option of four-wheel drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1960 Willys Four-Wheel-Drive Station Wagon: Your (Great-) Grandfather's SUV|url=http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/1960-willys-four-wheel-drive-station-wagon-your-great-grandfathers-suv|website=Autoweek|access-date=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Greg|title=The Very First Sport Utility Vehicle: The Jeep Station Wagon|url= https://autoroundup.com/index.php/jeep-station-wagon-the-very-first-suv/|website=Autoroundup|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four-wheel drive versions of the [[Chevrolet Suburban#Fourth generation (1955–1959)|Chevrolet Suburban]] were introduced for 1955, followed by the [[International Harvester Travelall#First generation (1953-1957)|International Harvester Travelall]] in 1956 (credited as being the first full-size SUV)&lt;ref name=4Wtravelall/&gt; and the [[Dodge Town Panel and Town Wagon|Power Wagon Town Wagon]] in 1957.&lt;ref name=4Wtravelall&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fourwheeler.com/project-vehicles/129-1211-1959-international-harvester-b120-travelall/|title=1959 International Harvester B-120 Travelall – Four Wheeler Magazine|last=Allen|first=Jim|date=2012-11-01|publisher=Four Wheeler Network|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107215038/http://www.fourwheeler.com/project-vehicles/129-1211-1959-international-harvester-b120-travelall/|archive-date=2018-01-07|url-status=live|access-date=2018-01-07|author-link=Jim Allen (4x4 writer)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kiplinger58&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA22|journal=Changing Times: The Kiplinger Magazine|volume=12|number=2|page=22|date=February 1958|title=The 1958 Station Wagons|access-date=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developed as a competitor to the [[Jeep CJ]], the compact [[International Harvester Scout]] was introduced in 1961, offering either two- or four-wheel drive and a variety of engine options.

The two-door [[Chevrolet K5 Blazer]] (and related GMC K5 Jimmy) were introduced for 1969, and the two-door [[International Harvester Scout#Scout II|International Harvester Scout II]] was introduced in 1971. The first European luxury off-road vehicle was the 1970 [[Range Rover Classic]], which was marketed as a luxury car for both on-road and off-road usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1970 Range Rover advertisement|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMKZEjrPhvw|website=YouTube|access-date=2019-04-13|date=2018-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Old Range Rover ad|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VmR8HyiWk0|website=YouTube|access-date=2019-04-13|date=2009-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first relevant usage of the term SUV was in advertising brochures for the full-sized 1974 [[Jeep Cherokee (SJ)]], which used the wording &quot;sport(s) utility vehicle&quot; as a description for the vehicle.&lt;ref name=74Jeeppage&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.autopaper.com/images/2214/98959-02.jpg|title=1974 model year Jeep brochure picture – Cherokee page|publisher=Jeep|location=U.S.|year=1973|access-date=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=74Jeepfront&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/jeep/74jeep.html|title=1974 model year Jeep Cherokee brochure – front|publisher=Jeep|location=U.S.|year=1973|access-date=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1966 [[Ford Bronco]] included a &quot;sport utility&quot; model, however in this case it was used for the two-door pickup truck version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://image.fourwheeler.com/f/101899557+w600+cr1/011-1966-bronco-specifications.jpg|title=1966 Ford Bronco U-100 4-Wheel Drive models &amp; features brochure|publisher=Ford|location=U.S.|year=1965|access-date=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The compact-sized 1984 [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)]] is often credited as the first SUV in the modern understanding of the term.&lt;ref name=&quot;brasher40&quot;&gt;Bradsher, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of unibody construction was unique at the time for a four-wheel drive and also reduced the weight of the new Cherokee. It also appealed to urban families due to having a more compact size (compared to the full-size Wagoneer and previous generation Cherokee SJ models) as well as a plush interior resembling a station wagon.&lt;ref name=&quot;brasher40&quot;/&gt; As the new Cherokee became a major sales success, the term &quot;sport utility vehicle&quot; began to be used in the national press for the first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;brasher40&quot;/&gt; &quot;The advent and immediate success of AMC/Jeep's compact four-door Cherokee turned the truck industry upside down.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YjgfZkNUakkC&amp;q=The+advent+and+immediate+success+of+AMC/Jeep's+compact+four-door+Cherokee+turned+the+truck+industry+upside+down|page=18|title=Toyota truck &amp; Land Cruiser owner's bible|first=Moses|last=Ludel|year=1995|publisher=Robert Bentley|isbn=978-0-8376-0159-5|access-date=2011-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[corporate Average Fuel Economy|corporate average fuel economy]] (CAFE) standard that was introduced in 1975 with the aim of reducing fuel usage included relaxed regulations for &quot;light trucks&quot;, to avoid business paying extra taxes for work vehicles. This created a loophole that manufacturers increasingly exploited since the 1980s, whereby SUVs were designed to be classified as light trucks (despite their primary use as passenger vehicles) to receive tax concessions and less stringent fuel economy requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsc.berkeley.edu/newsletter/Summer05-SUVs/history.html|title=From the Battlefield to the Soccer Field|publisher=Traffic Safety Center Online Newsletter|volume=2|issue=4|date=Summer 2005|access-date=2013-01-08|url-status=dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120310182737/http://www.tsc.berkeley.edu/newsletter/Summer05-SUVs/history.html|archive-date=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] agreed to classify the new Jeep Cherokee as a light truck following lobbying from its manufacturer; the Cherokee was then marketed by the company as a passenger vehicle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradsher&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Keith|last=Bradsher|title=High and Mighty: SUVs—The World's Most Dangerous Vehicles and How They Got That Way|publisher=PublicAffairs|year=2002|isbn=978-1-58648-203-9|url= https://archive.org/details/highmightydan00brad|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increased the SUV boom as other manufacturers introduced their own SUVs in response to the compact Cherokee taking sales from their regular cars.&lt;ref&gt;Bradsher, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

SUVs increased in popularity throughout the 1990s and by 1999 the U.S. sales of SUVs and light trucks for the first time exceeded sales of regular passenger cars.{{R|CCSThrg|p=2}}

=== 2000s ===

By 2003, there were 76 million SUVs and light trucks on U.S. roads, representing approximately 35% of the vehicles on the road.&lt;ref name=CCSThrg/&gt;

Car manufacturers were keen to promote SUV sales over other types of cars due to higher profits in the segment. An SUV could be sold with a profit margin of {{USD|10,000}} or more ({{USD|18,000}} per SUV in the case of the [[Ford Excursion]]), while compact cars were often sold at a loss of a few hundred dollars per car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.cleveland.com/business/2008/06/as_buyers_shun_suvs_expect_to.html|first=Robert|last=Schoenberger|title=As buyers shun SUVs, expect to pay more for that small car|newspaper=Cleveland Business News|date=2008-06-06|access-date=2010-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/community/tags/topic.aspx?req=tag&amp;tag=Escape%20SUV|title=Ford idle, for now|work=USA Today|date=2008-10-16|access-date=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wsws.org/articles/2000/may2000/jobs-m27.shtml|first=Jerry|last=White|title=GM, Ford idle 1,365 workers-auto industry layoffs signal coming downturn in US economy|publisher=Wsws.org|date=2000-05-27|access-date=2010-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, several manufacturing plants were converted from car production to SUV production (such as the General Motors plant in [[Arlington, Texas]] in 1996) and many long-running U.S. sedan models were discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maynard|first=Micheline|title=End of the Line for Ford Taurus|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/28/business/28ford.html|newspaper= The New York Times|date=2006-10-28|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Ford Taurus interview|publisher=ABC News|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwuCm8hNXgI |date=2007-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/10/19/so-long-friend-ford-producing-the-last-taurus-next-week/|title=So long, friend.

From the mid-2000s until 2010, U.S. sales of SUVs and other light trucks experienced a dip due to increasing fuel prices and a declining economy. From 2008 to 2010, General Motors closed four assembly plants that were producing SUVs and trucks.&lt;ref name=FinancialPost&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.financialpost.com/related/links/story.html?id=562830|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090216154211/http://www.financialpost.com/related/links/story.html?id=562830|archive-date=2009-02-01|title=Caw Girds For War|first=Nicolas|last=Van Praet|work=Financial Post|location=U.S.|date=2008-06-04|access-date=2019-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales of SUVs and light trucks sales began to recover in 2010, as fuel prices decreased and the North American economy improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Healey|first=James|title=Surprise: Sales of big SUVs surging faster than small cars|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/autos/2010-07-30-suvs30_CV_N.htm|newspaper=USA Today|access-date=2012-04-23|date=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010s to 2020s ===

In 2019, the [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA) reported that the global number of SUVs and crossovers on the road multiplied by six since 2010—from 35 million to 200 million vehicles, and their market share has grown to 40 percent of worldwide new light-vehicle sales at the end of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/soaring-demand-for-suvs-exacerbates-climate-crisis-kbpj5mpzg |title=Soaring demand for SUVs exacerbates climate crisis|first=Ben|last=Webster|newspaper=The Times|location=U.K. |date=14 November 2019 |access-date=26 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luxury brands have increasingly introduced SUV or crossover models in the 2010s.

SUVs have competed in various off-road racing competitions, such as the [[Dakar Rally]], [[Baja 1000]], [[FIA Cross-Country Rally World Cup]], [[King of the Hammers]], and [[Australasian Safari]]. SUVs have also competed in the [[Trophee Andros]] ice-racing series.

== Nicknames ==
Several derogatory or pejorative terms for SUVs are based on the combination of an affluent suburb name and &quot;tractor&quot;, particularly for expensive vehicles from luxury brands. Examples include &quot;[[Toorak, Victoria|Toorak]] Tractor&quot; (Melbourne, Australia),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.australiantraveller.com/australia/the-australian-travel-slang-dictionary/|title=The Australian travel slang dictionary|work=Australian Traveller|location=Australia|date=2015-06-09|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.e-motor.com.au/2018/01/03/evolution-of-the-suv/ |title=The evolution of the SUV|work=eMotor|date=2018-01-03|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] Tractor&quot; (London, England)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/sep/26/usnews.theobserversuknewspages|title=Terminator guns for the Chelsea Tractor|work=The Guardian|date=2004-09-26|access-date=2009-07-19|location=London|first=Denis|last=Campbell}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;[[Remuera]] Tractor&quot; (Auckland, New Zealand). These terms relate to the theory that four-wheel drive capabilities are not required by affluent SUV owners, and that the SUV is purchased as a status symbol rather than for practical reasons.

In Norway, the term {{lang|no|Børstraktor}} ('Stock Exchange Tractor') serves a similar purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dn.no/dnBil/article1783421.ece|title=Bloddopet børstraktor|first=Embret|last=Sæter|date=2009-11-26|publisher=DN.no|language=no|access-date=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Netherlands, SUVs are sometimes called &quot;P.C.

A '''timecode''' (alternatively, '''time code''') is a sequence of numeric codes generated at regular intervals by a [[timing synchronization]] system. Timecode is used in [[video production]], [[show control]] and other applications which require temporal coordination or logging of recording or actions.

== Video and film timecode ==
In [[video production]] and [[filmmaking]], [[SMPTE timecode]] is used extensively for [[synchronization]], and for logging and identifying material in recorded media.  During filmmaking or video production shoot, the [[camera assistant]] will typically log the start and end timecodes of shots, and the data generated will be sent on to the editorial department for use in referencing those shots. This [[shot-logging]] process was traditionally done by hand using pen and paper, but is now typically done using shot-logging software running on a laptop computer that is connected to the time code generator or the camera itself.

The SMPTE family of timecodes are almost universally used in film, video and audio production, and can be encoded in many different formats, including:
*[[Linear timecode]] (LTC), in a separate audio track
*[[Vertical interval timecode]] (VITC), in the vertical blanking interval of a video track
*[[AES-EBU embedded timecode]] used with [[digital audio]]
*[[Burnt-in timecode]], in  human-readable form in the video itself
*[[CTL timecode]] (control track)
*[[MIDI timecode]]

[[Keykode]], while not a timecode, is used to identify specific [[film frame]]s in film [[post-production]] that uses physical [[film stock]]. Keykode data is normally used in conjunction with SMPTE time code.

[[Rewritable consumer timecode]] is a proprietary consumer video timecode system that is not frame-accurate, and is therefore not used in professional post-production.

== Other time code formats ==
Time codes for purposes other than video and audio production include:
* [[Inter-range instrumentation group time codes]] (IRIG) is used for military, government and commercial purposes.
* [[DTS_(sound_system)#Theatrical_use|DTS time code]] is used to synchronise the optical DTS timecode track from a projector to the CD-based DTS audio tracks.

== Timecode generators ==

Depending on the environment, timecode generators can take various forms.

[[File:Coral Outcrop Flynn Reef.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A coral outcrop on the [[Great Barrier Reef]], [[Australia]]]]
'''Corals''' are [[marine invertebrates]] within the [[class (biology)|class]] [[Anthozoa]] of the [[phylum]] [[Cnidaria]]. They typically live in compact [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] of many identical individual [[polyp (zoology)|polyp]]s. Coral species include the important [[Coral reef|reef]] builders that inhabit tropical oceans and secrete [[calcium carbonate]] to form a hard skeleton.

A coral &quot;group&quot; is a colony of myriad [[cloning|genetically identical]] polyps. Each polyp is a sac-like animal typically only a few millimeters in diameter and a few centimeters in height. A set of [[tentacle]]s surround a central mouth opening. Each polyp excretes an [[exoskeleton]] near the base. Over many generations, the colony thus creates a skeleton characteristic of the species which can measure up to several meters in size. Individual colonies grow by [[asexual reproduction]] of polyps. Corals also breed sexually by [[Spawn (biology) |spawning]]: polyps of the same species release [[gamete]]s simultaneously overnight, often around a [[full moon]]. Fertilized eggs form planulae, a mobile early form of the coral polyp which when mature settles to form a new colony.

Although some corals are able to catch [[plankton]] and small [[fish]] using [[Cnidocyte|stinging cells]] on their tentacles, most corals obtain the majority of their energy and nutrients from [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[unicellular]] [[dinoflagellate]]s of the genus ''[[Symbiodinium]]'' that live within their tissues. These are commonly known as [[zooxanthellae]] and gives the coral color. Such corals require sunlight and grow in clear, shallow water, typically at depths less than {{convert|60|m|ft fathom|abbr=off}}. Corals are major contributors to the physical structure of the [[coral reef]]s that develop in tropical and subtropical waters, such as the [[Great Barrier Reef]] off the coast of [[Australia]]. These corals are increasingly at risk of [[coral bleaching|bleaching]] events where polyps expel the zooxanthellae in response to stress such as high water temperature or toxins.

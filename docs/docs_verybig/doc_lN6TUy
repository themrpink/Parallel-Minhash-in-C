The larger Staines-upon-Thames [[post town]] includes the villages of [[Stanwell]], [[Laleham]] and [[Wraysbury]]. Owing to the long association of Staines Bridge with a medieval causeway ([[levee]]) on the opposite bank of the river, the post town also includes part of [[Egham Hythe]].  This contains a significant business zone of the county and, in its east, a few of the town's oldest [[listed building]]s.

Staines-upon-Thames has many parks, leisure centres, a football club and several multinational research/technology company offices. The centre of [[Heathrow Airport]] is {{convert|3|mi|0}} to the north-east and [[Staines railway station]] is a main stop on the [[Waterloo to Reading Line|London Waterloo to Reading line]] and the [[Staines to Windsor Line|Windsor &amp; Eton Riverside line]].

The traditional boundaries are unusual for a South-East town, being a north-south [[strip parish]] that ranges from {{convert|13|to|20|m|0}} above sea level.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The low is by the [[River Thames|Thames]] at Penton Hook Lock. The high point are places in St Mary's churchyard.}}

==Name==
The name derives from [[Middle English]] ''stanes'', from [[Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|stānas}}'' (&quot;stones&quot;).

{{main|History of Staines-upon-Thames}}

===Early history===
A neolithic causewayed camp has been found at the south of Yeoveney on [[Staines Moor]]. This had later prehistoric, Roman, and Saxon occupation.&lt;ref&gt;''Excavations at Yeoveney, Near Staines, 1982'' Phil Jones, Martin O'Connell and Rob Poulton https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-379-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_80/surreyac080_105-119_jones.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

At the site of Majestic House excavations in 2013 revealed evidence of intermittent human activity over many centuries.&lt;ref name=ellis&gt;''Surrey Archaeological Collections, 99, 129–148, 2016'' &quot;Archaeological investigation at Majestic House,

There was no evidence for Saxon or early medieval activities, but the remains of later medieval rectilinear buildings, a well and ditches were found.&lt;ref name=ellis/&gt;   Ellis (2013) draws a map of this site at the heart of a town island, rather a perennially non-marshy, rounded (penannular) zone that has five archaeological sites.&lt;ref name=ellis/&gt; 

There has been a [[Crossings of the River Thames|crossing]] of the [[River Thames|Thames]] at Staines since [[Roman Britain|Roman times]]. The [[Roman Emperor|emperor]] [[Claudius]] [[Roman conquest of Britain|invaded Britain in AD 43]]. Staines had the zone mentioned above, likely remaining settled, at that time. Within a decade, some sort of first [[Staines Bridge]] would have been needed for the Roman road much later known in places as the [[Devil's Highway (Roman Britain)|Devil's Highway]], elsewhere as the stone ('[[Great Vowel Shift|stane]]') street between [[Londinium]] ([[City of London|London]]) and [[Calleva Atrebatum]] ([[Silchester]]). 

Pontibus, Latin for &quot;at the bridges&quot; in the early 3rd-century [[Antonine Itinerary]], has long been guessed to refer to Staines, but that may be wrong since the Itinerary's mileages actually point some distance away (possibly to the south end of Virginia Water Lake).  More than one bridge might have traversed [[Church Island, River Thames|Church Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thacker |first=Fred.

The [[Middlesex]] section of the [[Domesday Book]] records the manor &quot;Stanes&quot; as a property held by [[Westminster Abbey]]. It was stated to have 19 [[hide (unit)|hide]]s of land and had 6 [[Mill (grinding)|mill]]s worth [[UK pound|£]]3, 4[[shilling|s]], 0[[penny|d]]; 2 [[weir]]s worth 6[[shilling|s]], 8[[penny|d]]; 24 [[plough]]s; [[meadow]]s for 24 [[plough]]s; and some cattle.

A boundary stone on the bank of the River Thames dated 1280 still remains, indicating the western limit of the [[City of London]]'s jurisdiction over the Thames. Although familiarly known as the '[[London Stone (riparian)#Staines|London Stone]]', it is not to be confused with the more famous – and probably more ancient – [[London Stone]] in [[Cannon Street]] in the City of London.

The barons assembled at Staines before they met [[John, King of England|King John]] at [[Runnymede]] in 1215, and [[Stephen Langton]] held a consecration there shortly after the sealing of [[Magna Carta]]. Kings and other important people must have passed through the town on many occasions: the church bells were rung several times in 1670, for instance, when the [[Charles II of England|king]] and [[Catherine of Braganza|queen]] went through Staines.&lt;ref name=Reynolds&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Reynolds |editor-first=Susan |editor-link=Susan Reynolds |year=1962 |chapter=Staines: Introduction |title=A History of the County of Middlesex |volume=III |series=[[Victoria County History]] |publisher=[[University of London]] [[Institute of Historical Research]] |chapter-url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol3/pp13-18 |pages=13–18 |accessdate=4 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1642 and 1648 during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], there were skirmishes on Staines Moor and numerous troop movements over Staines Bridge. The parish remained largely agricultural until the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt;

===Modern history===
====Boundaries====
[[File:Staines StMary SSW.jpg|thumb|[[St Mary's, Staines|St Mary's parish church]], which was rebuilt in 1828]]
In the 19th century the [[Church of England]] lost all its secular maintenance and relief functions, of its [[vestry|vestries]]. However, as local government [[civil parishes in England|became unparished]], the parish boundary of [[Laleham]] remains used in road signs and official naming, notable as its housing has become widely [[Geographic contiguity|contiguous]]. 

Ashford, receiving from Staines the [[River Ash, Surrey|River Ash]], had its boundary running north from the mid-part of Kingston Road, south of which lay part of Laleham which zig-zagged further west.&lt;ref&gt;https://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/#zoom=16&amp;lat=51.43811&amp;lon=-0.48750&amp;layers=6&amp;b=7&lt;/ref&gt;

Laleham remains, as it was in the mid-19th century, a long tranche beginning east of the north-south Sweep's Ditch which runs south to the tip of the [[Penton Hook Island|Penton Hook peninsula]] of the River Thames. [[Spelthorne Borough Council]] is one of the few Surrey districts divided completely equally in terms of number of councillors per wards yet the population of Laleham is insufficient to elect three councillors. Laleham does share a post town, and has a large sports ground named after Laleham and Staines. It instead forms one half of the [[wards of the United Kingdom|ward]] ''Riverside [Staines] and Laleham'', parts A and D of Spelthorne's 009 division in the [[United Kingdom Census 2011]].&lt;ref name=reynintro&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Reynolds |editor-first=Susan |editor-link=Susan Reynolds |year=1962 |chapter=Staines: Introduction The hundred of Spelthorne (continued) |title=A History of the County of Middlesex |volume=III |series=[[Victoria County History]] |publisher=[[University of London]] [[Institute of Historical Research]] |pages=13-18 |chapter-url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol3/pp1-12 |accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early economy====
Staines was a regular [[staging post]] with [[coaching inn]]s. It was used for an overnight horse change on [[The Trafalgar Way]] in 1805, announcing the [[Battle of Trafalgar|victory]] over the combined French and Spanish fleet and the death of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]].&lt;ref&gt;Commemorated on a plaque in Staines Town Hall, a pub-restaurant&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Lewis (publisher)|Samuel Lewis]] mentions the place in his 1848 ''Topographical Dictionary of England'', saying that &quot;The town, which has been much improved of late, consists principally of one wide street, containing several good houses, terminating at the river.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Samuel |editor-last=Lewis |editor-link=Samuel Lewis (publisher) |year=1848 |chapter=Staines |title=A Topographical Dictionary of England |place=London |publisher=[[University of London]] [[Institute of Historical Research]] |chapter-url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/topographical-dict/england/pp170-175#h3-0007 |accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Industries====
[[File:Staines High Street - geograph.org.uk - 2835.jpg|thumb|Statue in the High Street commemorating Staines' history of making [[linoleum]]]]
The town was a major producer of [[linoleum]] after the formation of the Linoleum Manufacturing Company in 1864 by its inventor, [[Frederick Walton]]. Linoleum became the main industry of the town and was a major employer in the area until the 1960s. In 1876 about 220 and in 1911 about 350 people worked in the plant. By 1957 it employed some 300 people and in 1956 the factory produced about 2675 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of linoleum each week. The term 'Staines Lino' became a worldwide name but the factory was closed around 1970 and is the site is now occupied by the Two Rivers shopping centre, completed about 2000. A bronze statue of two lino workers in Staines High Street commemorates the Staines Lino Factory. The Spelthorne Museum has a display dedicated to the Linoleum Manufacturing Company.

The [[Lagonda]] car factory was on the site of [[Sainsbury's]] supermarket in Egham Hythe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/august-1995/74/sainsburys-sarthe|title=From Sainsbury's to the Sarthe {{!}} Motor Sport Magazine Archive|date=2014-07-07|website=Motor Sport Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-10-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191016165014/https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/august-1995/74/sainsburys-sarthe|archive-date=16 October 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Notable events====
The town was the site of the [[Staines air disaster]] in 1972, at the time the worst [[Accidents and incidents in aviation|air crash]] in [[Great Britain|Britain]] until the [[Lockerbie disaster]] of 1988. (Since the Lockerbie crash was a terrorist act in Scotland, the Staines crash remains England's worst air disaster, and Britain's worst air ''accident''.) The crash was commemorated in June 2004 by the opening of a dedicated garden near the crash site, created at the request of relatives, and the unveiling of a stained glass window at [[St Mary's, Staines|St Mary's Church]], where a memorial service was held.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/501903.memorial-garden-to-commemorate-heathrow-disaster/|title=Memorial garden to commemorate Heathrow disaster|website=This Is Local London|language=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Staines Urban District===
[[File:Staines Urban District Coat of Arms.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Staines Urban District]] coat of arms]]
In 1894 the [[Local Government Act 1894]] created the [[Staines Urban District]]. This status conferred additional powers and responsibilities compared with the few Rural Districts in [[Middlesex County Council]]. In 1965, under the [[London Government Act 1963]], Middlesex, apart from the Staines, [[Sunbury-on-Thames]] and [[Potters Bar]] Urban Districts, became part of [[Greater London]]. Staines and [[Sunbury-on-Thames|Sunbury]] were transferred to [[Surrey]] and Potters Bar to [[Hertfordshire]]. In 1974, under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the Staines Urban District was combined with [[Sunbury-on-Thames Urban District]] to form the present-day [[borough of Spelthorne]]. Staines remains associated with the historical county of Middlesex through certain cultural and sporting affiliations, and until 1996 for postal purposes.

===Staines-upon-Thames===
The town changed its official name to &quot;Staines-upon-Thames&quot; on 20 May 2012.&lt;ref name=BBC-2011&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-surrey-16213204 |title=Staines-upon-Thames renaming decision made |date=16 December 2011 |accessdate=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 December 2011, [[Spelthorne Borough Council]] resolved by 25 votes to 4&lt;ref name=BBC-2011/&gt; with 6 abstentions (including all the councillors for Staines ward itself)&lt;ref name=&quot;spelthorne.gov.uk&quot;&gt;[http://www.spelthorne.gov.uk/15dec11_mins.pdf Spelthorne Council Minutes 15 December 2011]{{dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spelthorne.gov.uk/your_council/councillors/cou_borough_councillors_by_ward.htm Spelthorne Borough Councillors by ward 2011–2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223234249/http://www.spelthorne.gov.uk/your_council/councillors/cou_borough_councillors_by_ward.htm |date=23 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to change the name of the town to Staines-upon-Thames, to try to boost the local economy by promoting its riverside location, and reportedly to discourage association with Sacha Baron Cohen’s fictional character [[Ali G]], as well as rock band [[Hard-Fi]], who described Staines as &quot;a ghost town&quot;.&lt;ref name=BBC-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC-2012&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-surrey-18118309 |title=Staines becomes Staines-upon-Thames to shake off Ali G link |publisher=BBC |date=20 May 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Proximity to London, [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]] and the [[M25 motorway]] has attracted large company branch offices, including: [[Bupa]] (healthcare)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.indeed.co.uk/cmp/Bupa/reviews?fcountry=GB&amp;floc=Staines-upon-Thames&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wood Group|Wood]] plc (oil &amp; gas).&lt;ref&gt;https://local.standard.co.uk/company/482623033925632&lt;/ref&gt; [[Siemens]] Building Automation Division and [[British Gas]] (part of [[Centrica]]) have their national headquarters here&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.centrica.com/sites/default/files/1763_centrica_location_maps_uk_and_roi.pdf|title=See all our locations in the UK and Republic of Ireland|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s)--&gt;|date=2015-06-29|publisher=[[Centrica]]|access-date=2016-02-18|quote=3.

The town centre is compact save for more niche businesses and leisure-oriented west ends (Church Street and the river's banks).  It has a wide pedestrianised High Street where a long market is held every Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. Behind its shops a moderately-sized shopping centre, Elmsleigh Centre faces a retail park, behind the other side. The Two Rivers retail park opened in 2002, its far edge sees the return of the [[Wraysbury River]] into [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|Colne]]. Staines has at least three parades of convenience shops and local professional services. The town has many central restaurants. A range of [[pubs]] host live music evenings.

== Architecture and landmarks ==
[[File:Old Town Hall Staines - geograph.org.uk - 49830.jpg|thumb|upright|Staines Old Town Hall]]
The original manor of Staines became derelict and was demolished. Staines Bridge spans the [[Thames]] with a three arch structure completed in 1832. Until the 14th century, Staines was the [[tidal limit]], but this is now downstream at [[Teddington]] – a replica [[London Stone (riparian)|London Stone]] exists in the Lammas Recreation Ground.

The administrative offices of [[Spelthorne Borough Council]] are by one of the town's more linear parks. In the early 2000s, a public landscape area was constructed by the riverside [[conservation area]] with seating and sculptures to enhance the waterfront as a place to walk. The 'Town Hall' is a [[stucco]]ed Victorian blend of Italian and Flemish styles in a small market square, converted into an Art Centre in the 1990s, and later turned into a pub (now closed). Elaborate Georgian shophouses line Clarence Street (named after [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William, Duke of Clarence]], who became King William IV).&lt;ref name=sp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spelthorne.gov.uk/planning |publisher=Spelthorne Borough Council |title=Planning }}&lt;/ref&gt; Church Street and Lammas Lane house the oldest properties clustered around the parish church of [[St Mary's, Staines|St Mary]].&lt;ref name=os&gt;{{cite web |url=http://getamap.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/getamap/frames.htm?mapAction=gaz&amp;gazName=g&amp;gazString=TQ048812 |title=OS Maps Online |publisher=[[Ordnance survey]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most neighbourhoods have green spaces such as ([[Staines Moor]], Shortwood Common, Knowle Green, Leacroft, the Lammas and the sports fields and farms on the borders of Laleham. The last two are riverside parks with picnic areas and playgrounds. Many of the parks belonged to former grand houses: see [[Laleham]] for [[Richard Bingham, 2nd Earl of Lucan|Lord Lucan]]'s 'Laleham House' which became a Roman Catholic abbey for a century. Since the late 20th century, listed luxury apartments in the [[post town]] have been created there and at [[Duncroft School for Girls|Duncroft Manor]].

Staines Bus Garage opened June 1936 and was a extremely sinuous-looking design when viewed from the garage’s approach road, with curved runs of offices either side of the garage forecourt, and canopies on the circular stub towers at the ends of the office blocks describing almost three-quarters of a circle. It closed in 1996 and the site is occupied by Offices, there are no remains of the Garage.

==Sport==
[[File:DovervStaines.jpg|thumb|Football match between [[Staines Town F.C.|Staines Town]] (yellow shirts) and [[Dover Athletic F.C.|Dover Athletic]] in 2009]]
Two affiliated senior association football clubs bear the name of Staines, namely [[Staines Town F.C.]] (senior status), and [[Staines Lammas F.C.]] (intermediate status). Staines Town plays at the newly rebuilt [[Wheatsheaf Park]] ground and is a member of [[Isthmian League]] Premier Division. Staines Town has a strong rivalry with [[Hampton &amp; Richmond Borough F.C.]]. Staines Lammas was champion of the [[Combined Counties League]] Division One in the 2007–08 season.the club runs various age group teams. Staines also has several successful junior football clubs: Staines Town, Staines Lammas and Staines Albion, as well as girls' clubs Kempton Girls FC — Colne Valley and the U11, one of the best girls' junior clubs in Surrey.

[[Staines Rugby Football Club]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stainesrugby.co.uk |title=Welcome to Staines Rugby |publisher=Staines Rugby Club |accessdate=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; used to play at the Lammas (a recreation ground in the town also known as the Ashby Recreation Ground). The club moved to The Reeves (on Snakey Lane, Hanworth) in the 1960s but kept its name. It has teams named Swans, Cobs and Mucky Ducks. The Club is in [[Herts/Middlesex 1]] league and has mini and youth sections.

[[Staines Boat Club]] is immediately across the bridge in Egham Hythe and competes at a national level.

Staines Swimming Club&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stainesswimming.org |title=Staines Swimming Club |publisher=Staines Swimming Club |accessdate=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in the early 1900s and affiliated to the [[Amateur Swimming Association]] is based at Spelthorne Leisure Centre and provides competitive swimming from inter-club level up to national level.

Spelthorne Volleyball Club, also based at Spelthorne Leisure Centre, provides volleyball to a wide range of abilities and age groups.

Clubs in the borough cater to sailing, cricket, hockey, running, rambling, martial arts (jujitsu), rifle &amp; pistol shooting, bowls, chess, bridge, snooker, darts, pool, poker, and a district table tennis league.

The town is also home to TS ''Thamesis'', Staines and Egham Sea Cadet Corps. This is a uniformed youth organisation for young people aged between 10 and 18 years old. It meets at The Lammas.

===Historic sports===
[[Motorcycle speedway]] racing was staged at a stadium in Wraysbury Road. Events in 1938 and 1939 are well-known, but it is possible that a venue was active from at least 1931, for a team named Staines raced at Caxton Speedway (near Cambridge, 1931 – 1933 inclusive). The stadium was also used for greyhound racing, as well as 'novelty' events such as cheetah racing.

Staines Stadium was famous from 1955 to 1960 during the early days of [[Stock car racing in the United Kingdom|stock car racing in England]], and featured in the 1955 feature film ''Stock Car'' among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.petermarsh.freeuk.com/stockcar/staines.html |last=Marsh |first=Peter |title=Racing at Staines |work=Pete's Stoch Car Pages |date=14 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sports formerly held in Staines include: boxing (there were weekly programmes off the High Street in the 1930s, and local hearsay suggests bare-knuckle events were held at the Crooked Billet earlier in the 20th century); wrestling (bouts were included in boxing programmes of the 1930s); motorcycle football (a club existed in the 1960s; and American football (a short-lived team called Staines Removers entered the Budweiser League in 1988, but failed to start the season, although they did play some friendly matches at their base on The Lammas).

==Transport==
[[File:Staines station north building.JPG|thumb|[[Staines railway station]] main building, seen from the north]]
[[Staines railway station]] is a stop on all services between [[London Waterloo station]] and {{rws|Weybridge}} (for the [[South West Main Line]]), {{rws|Reading}} (for the [[Great Western Main Line]]) and {{rws|Windsor &amp; Eton Riverside}}. Semi-fast services serve the [[Waterloo to Reading Line]], being the operator's secondary main line. Taxis are available from the station. The bus station is a five-minute walk from the railway station, with services in all directions including to [[Thorpe Park]] and [[Royal Holloway College]]. Staines-upon-Thames is also a short distance south of [[Heathrow Airport]].

===Rail infrastructure projects===
There were proposals to build a new railway line, [[Heathrow Airtrack|Airtrack]], connecting the [[South West Main Line]] and/or London Gatwick to Heathrow Airport's [[Heathrow Terminal 5 station|Terminal 5 station]]. As part of these proposals, the former [[Staines High Street railway station]] was to be rebuilt by Two Rivers Shopping Centre and the High Street in the direction of [[Wraysbury railway station]], using a generally unused arc from north to south in the town centre, towards [[Weybridge]] on the [[South West Main Line]]. In 2011 the [[Department for Transport]] announced it had decided that this would not proceed because extra trains would delay road traffic using the level crossing at Egham. The existing Staines station would have an additional platform built instead on the relevant arc.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

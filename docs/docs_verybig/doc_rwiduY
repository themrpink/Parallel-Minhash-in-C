'''''The Queen of the Damned''''' (1988) is a horror  novel by American writer  [[Anne Rice]], the third in her ''[[The Vampire Chronicles]]'' series.  It follows ''[[Interview with the Vampire]]'' and ''[[The Vampire Lestat]]''.  This novel is a continuation of the story that ends in a [[cliffhanger]] in ''The Vampire Lestat'' and explores the rich history and [[mythology]] of the origin of the [[vampires]], which dates back to [[Ancient Egypt]].

In March 2014, a new installment of Rice's series  was announced  titled ''[[Prince Lestat]]'', which Rice's son, novelist [[Christopher Rice]], called &quot;a true sequel to ''The Queen of the Damned''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LA Times 2014-03&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-anne-rice-book-prince-lestat-20140310-story.html |title=Anne Rice brings back her vampire antihero with ''Prince Lestat'' |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |first=Carolyn |last=Kellogg |date=March 10, 2014 |accessdate=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
Part One follows several different people over the same period of several days. Several of the characters from the two previous books appear, including [[Armand (The Vampire Chronicles)|Armand]], [[Daniel Molloy]] (the &quot;boy reporter&quot; of ''[[Interview with the Vampire]]''), [[Marius de Romanus]], [[Louis de Pointe du Lac]], [[Gabrielle de Lioncourt]] and [[Santino (The Vampire Chronicles)|Santino]]. Each of the six chapters in Part One tells a different story about a different person or group of people. Two things unify these chapters: a series of dreams about red-haired twin sisters, and the fact that a powerful being is killing vampires around the world by means of [[spontaneous combustion]].

[[Pandora (The Vampire Chronicles)|Pandora]] and Santino rescue Marius, having answered his [[telepathy|telepathic]] call for help. Marius informs his rescuers that [[Akasha (The Vampire Chronicles)|Akasha]] has been awakened by [[Lestat de Lioncourt]], or rather his [[rock music]], for he has joined a rock band with mortals Alex, Larry and Tough Cookie. Having been awakened by Lestat's rebellious music, Akasha destroys her husband [[Enkil]] and plots to rule the world. She is also revealed as the source of the attacks on other vampires.

Part Two takes place at Lestat's concert. [[Jesse Reeves]], a member of the secret [[Talamasca Caste]] and relative of [[Maharet and Mekare|Maharet]], is mortally injured while attending the concert, and is taken to be made into a vampire at Maharet's compound in [[California]]'s [[Sonoma Mountains]]. The vampires from Part One later congregate in the compound. Meanwhile, Akasha abducts Lestat and takes him as an unwilling consort to various locations in the world, inciting women to rise up and kill the men who have oppressed them.

Part Three takes place at Maharet's compound, where Maharet tells the story of Akasha and the red-haired twins, Maharet and her sister, Mekare to the other characters. Also present are [[Mael (The Vampire Chronicles)|Mael]] and [[Khayman]], who already know the story.
{{details|topic=their story|Maharet and Mekare}}
In Part Four, Akasha confronts the gathered vampires, explaining that she plans to kill 90 percent of the world's human men and establish a new [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] in which women will worship Akasha as a goddess. If the assembled vampires refuse to follow her, she will destroy them. The vampires refuse, but Mekare enters and kills Akasha by severing her head and consuming her brain and heart. Amel passes into Mekare, thereby saving the lives of the remaining vampires. She becomes the new Queen of the Damned.

In Part Five, the vampires leave the compound and assemble at Armand's island resort in [[Florida]] to recover. They eventually go their separate ways. Lestat takes Louis to see [[David Talbot (The Vampire Chronicles)|David Talbot]] in [[London]]. After their brief visit with Talbot they depart into the night, an incensed Louis and his angry words filling Lestat with glee.

===The Origin of Vampires===
''The Queen of the Damned'' deals with the origins of [[vampires]] themselves. The mother of all vampires, [[Akasha (The Vampire Chronicles)|Akasha]], begins as a pre-[[Egypt]]ian [[monarch|queen]], in a land called [[Egypt#Names|Kemet]] (which will become Egypt), many thousands of years ago. During this time two powerful witches (Maharet and Mekare) live in the mountains of an unnamed region. The witches are able to communicate with invisible [[spirit]]s and gain simple favors from them.  During this period there is a bloodthirsty, invisible spirit known as Amel who continually asks the two witches if they need his assistance, although they prudently decline the offer. The witches' village is destroyed and they are incarcerated by the king and queen, who desire their knowledge. When the witches offend Akasha, the Queen condemns the twins. Enkil then orders his chief steward (who is Khayman as a mortal man) to rape the twins in his stead, which would prove their lack of power, before the eyes of the court. Afterward the witches are cast out into the desert. While making her way back home with a pregnant Maharet, Mekare curses the king and queen secretly with the bloodthirsty spirit. Eventually this spirit inflicts such torment on Akasha and Enkil that they again demand advice and help from the two witches.

Conspirators, unhappy with the young king's policies, assassinate the royal couple in Khayman's house while they were attempting to exorcise Amel, who had been tormenting Khayman. While the king and queen lie dying, the evil spirit sees its chance to ensnare the soul of the dying queen and pulls it back into her body. The spirit combines itself with the flesh and blood of the queen, transforming her into a vampire.  Akasha allows the king to drink her blood, which saves his life. They then order Khayman to find the witches and bring them back to Egypt so that they could use their knowledge of spirits to help them, as they feel guilty because of their thirst for blood. However, when the witches admit that they cannot help the monarchs, Akasha orders the mutilation of the witches: Maharet loses her eyes and Mekare her tongue. Afterward, Khayman, who had been turned into a vampire by Akasha, comes to the witches' cell and turns them too. The three flee together, but are caught by Akasha's soldiers. Khayman escapes, but Maharet and Mekare are further punished.  The witches are put into two separate coffins which are then set afloat on two separate bodies of water. They are only reunited near the end of the novel ''Queen of the Damned''.

In Mekare's absence, Maharet returns to watch over her daughter and her descendants. Maharet's descendants become what she calls the Great Family. A maternal line, the Great Family includes every culture, religion, ethnicity, and race. The Great Family represents all humanity and shows the vampires what Akasha would destroy with the creation of her New World Order.

As the source of all vampires, Akasha is connected to all vampires by the blood and spirit they collectively share. In an experiment by the first Keeper, Akasha and Enkil are exposed to sunlight when they are several thousand years old. This merely darkens their skin. However, the result on all other vampires is extreme, and many of the weakest vampires die, thus confirming the legend that anything that harms Akasha will also directly affect all of her progeny.

'''Jacobus Henricus &quot;Henry&quot; van 't Hoff Jr.''' ({{IPA-nl|vɑn (ə)t ˈɦɔf|lang}}; 30 August 1852 – 1 March 1911) was a Dutch [[physical chemistry|physical chemist]]. A highly influential [[theoretical chemistry|theoretical chemist]] of his time, Van 't Hoff was the first winner of the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=van't Hoff, Jacobus Hendricus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1901/hoff-lecture.html Nobel Lecture] ''Osmotic Pressure and Chemical Equilibrium'' from Nobelprize.org website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Karl Grandin, ed. | title=Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff Biography | url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1901/hoff-bio.html | work=Les Prix Nobel | publisher=The Nobel Foundation | date= | accessdate=15 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His pioneering work helped found the modern theory of [[chemical affinity]], [[chemical equilibrium]], [[chemical kinetics]], and [[chemical thermodynamics]]. In his 1874 pamphlet Van 't Hoff formulated the theory of the tetrahedral carbon atom and laid the foundations of [[stereochemistry]].

==Biography==
The third of seven children, Van ’t Hoff was born in [[Rotterdam]], Netherlands, 30 August 1852. His father was Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff, Sr., a physician, and his mother was Alida Kolff van 't Hoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Nobelprize}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From a young age, he was interested in science and nature, and frequently took part in botanical excursions. In his early school years, he showed a strong interest in poetry and [[philosophy]]. He considered [[Lord Byron]] to be his idol.

Against the wishes of his father, Van 't Hoff chose to study [[chemistry]]. First, he enrolled at [[Delft University of Technology]] in September 1869, and studied until 1871, when he passed his final exam on 8 July and obtained a degree of [[Industrial technology|chemical technologist]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Snelders&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=De geschiedenis van de scheikunde in Nederland.

He then studied in [[Bonn]], Germany, with [[Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz|Friedrich Kekulé]] and in Paris with [[Charles Adolphe Wurtz|C. A. Wurtz]]. He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] under Eduard Mulder at the [[Utrecht University|University of Utrecht]] in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dap.library.uu.nl/cgi-bin/dap/dap?diss_id=7506 Entry in Digital Album Promotorum] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724171949/http://dap.library.uu.nl/cgi-bin/dap/dap?diss_id=7506 |date=24 July 2011 }} of [[Utrecht University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1878, Van 't Hoff married Johanna Francina Mees. They had two daughters, Johanna Francina (1880–1964) and Aleida Jacoba (1882–1971), and two sons, Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff III (1883–1943) and Govert Jacob (1889–1918). Van 't Hoff died at the age of 58, on 1 March 1911, at [[Steglitz]], near Berlin, of [[tuberculosis]].

Van 't Hoff earned his earliest reputation in the field of [[organic chemistry]]. In 1874, he accounted for the phenomenon of [[optical activity]] by assuming that the [[chemical bond]]s between [[carbon]] [[atom]]s and their neighbors were directed towards the corners of a regular [[tetrahedron]].&lt;ref&gt;*Van 't Hoff (3 September 1874) ''Voorstel tot Uitbreiding der Tegenwoordige in de Scheikunde gebruikte Structuurformules in de Ruimte, benevens een daarmee samenhangende Opmerking omtrent het Verband tusschen Optisch Actief Vermogen en chemische Constitutie van Organische Verbindingen'' (Proposal for the Extension of Current Chemical Structural Formulas into Space, together with Related Observation on the Connection between Optically Active Power and the Chemical Constitution of Organic Compounds) [pamphlet published by the author].  Available in English at:  [http://www.chemteam.info/Chem-History/Van't-Hoff-1874.html ChemTeam].

YouTube. Retrieved on 30 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This three-dimensional structure accounted for the [[isomer]]s found in nature. He shares credit for this  with the French chemist [[Joseph Le Bel]], who independently came up with the same idea.

Three months before his doctoral degree was awarded, Van 't Hoff published this theory, which today is regarded as the foundation of [[stereochemistry]], first in a Dutch pamphlet in the fall of 1874, and then in the following May in a small French book entitled ''La chimie dans l'espace''. A German translation appeared in 1877, at a time when the only job Van 't Hoff could find was at the Veterinary School in Utrecht.  In these early years his theory was largely ignored by the scientific community, and was sharply criticized by one prominent chemist, [[Hermann Kolbe]]. Kolbe wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;A Dr. J. H. van ’t Hoff of the Veterinary School at Utrecht has no liking, apparently, for exact chemical investigation. He has considered it more convenient to mount Pegasus (apparently borrowed from the Veterinary School) and to proclaim in his ''‘La chimie dans l’espace’'' how, in his bold flight to the top of the chemical Parnassus, the atoms appeared to him to be arranged in cosmic space.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  However, by about 1880 support for Van 't Hoff's theory by such important chemists as [[Johannes Wislicenus]] and [[Viktor Meyer]] brought recognition.

In 1884, Van 't Hoff published his research on chemical kinetics, titled ''Études de Dynamique chimique'' (''&quot;Studies in Chemical Dynamics&quot;''), in which he described a new method for determining the [[Order (chemistry)|order of a reaction]] using [[graphics]] and applied the laws of [[thermodynamics]] to chemical equilibria. He also introduced the modern concept of [[chemical affinity]]. In 1886, he showed a similarity between the behaviour of dilute solutions and gases. In 1887, he and German chemist [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] founded an influential scientific magazine named  ''Zeitschrift für physikalische Chemie'' (&quot;''Journal of Physical Chemistry''&quot;). He worked on [[Svante Arrhenius]]'s theory of the dissociation of [[electrolytes]] and in 1889 provided physical justification for the [[Arrhenius equation]]. In 1896, he became a professor at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in Berlin. His studies of the salt deposits at [[Stassfurt]] were an important contribution to Prussia's chemical industry.

[[File:Van 't Hoff und Ostwald 01.jpg|right|thumb|300px|J.H. van 't Hoff with [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] (right)]]

Van 't Hoff became a lecturer in chemistry and physics at the [[Veterinary medicine|Veterinary]] College in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. He then worked as a professor of chemistry, [[mineralogy]], and [[geology]] at the [[University of Amsterdam]] for almost 18 years before eventually becoming the chairman of the chemistry department. In 1896, Van 't Hoff moved to Germany, where he finished his career at the [[University of Berlin]] in 1911. In 1901, he received the first [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his work with solutions. His work showed that very dilute solutions follow mathematical laws that closely resemble the laws describing the behavior of [[gas]]es.

'''Java Server Pages''' ('''JSP'''; formerly JavaServer Pages) is a collection of technologies that helps [[software developer]]s create [[dynamic web page|dynamically generated web pages]] based on [[HTML]], [[XML]], [[SOAP]], or other document types. Released in 1999 by [[Sun Microsystems]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xent.com/FoRK-archive/apr99/0822.html Mailing list archive: &quot;Sun JSP 1.0 *not* available&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; JSP is similar to [[PHP]] and [[Active Server Pages|ASP]], but uses the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]].

To deploy and run Java Server Pages, a compatible web server with a [[servlet container]], such as [[Apache Tomcat]] or [[Jetty (web server)|Jetty]], is required.

==Overview==
[[File:JSP Model 2.svg|thumb|The JSP Model 2 architecture.]]

Architecturally, JSP may be viewed as a high-level [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] of [[Java servlet]]s. JSPs are translated into [[Java Servlet|servlet]]s at runtime, therefore JSP is a Servlet; each JSP servlet is cached and re-used until the original JSP is modified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://java.sun.com/j2ee/tutorial/1_3-fcs/doc/JSPIntro4.html The Life Cycle of a JSP Page (Sun documentation)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Java Server Pages can be used independently or as the view component of a server-side [[model–view–controller]] design, normally with [[JavaBeans]] as the model and Java servlets (or a framework such as [[Apache Struts]]) as the controller. This is a type of [[JSP model 2 architecture|Model 2]] architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Seshadri |first1=Govind |date=1999-12-29 |df=mdy |url=https://www.infoworld.com/article/2076557/understanding-javaserver-pages-model-2-architecture.html |title=Understanding JavaServer Pages Model 2 architecture |work=[[JavaWorld]] |accessdate=2020-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

JSP allows Java code and certain predefined actions to be interleaved with static web markup content, such as HTML. The resulting page is compiled and executed on the server to deliver a document. The compiled pages, as well as any dependent Java libraries, contain Java bytecode rather than [[machine code]]. Like any other .jar or Java program, code must be executed within a [[Java virtual machine]] (JVM) that interacts with the server's host [[operating system]] to provide an abstract, platform-neutral environment.

JSPs are usually used to deliver HTML and XML documents, but through the use of OutputStream, they can deliver other types of data as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coderanch.com/t/286297/JSP/java/OutputStream-already-obtained#2107162 Forum thread (JavaRanch): OutputStream already obtained]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Web container]] creates JSP implicit objects like request, response, session, application, config, page, pageContext, out and exception. JSP Engine creates these objects during translation phase.

== Syntax ==
{{Wikibooks|J2EE Programming/JavaServer Pages}}

JSP pages use several delimiters for [[server-side scripting|scripting]] functions. The most basic is &lt;code&gt; &lt;% ... %&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which encloses a JSP ''scriptlet.'' A scriptlet is a fragment of Java code that runs when the user requests the page. Other common delimiters include &lt;code&gt; &lt;%= ... %&gt;&lt;/code&gt; for ''expressions,'' where the scriptlet and delimiters are replaced with the result of evaluating the expression, and ''directives'', denoted with &lt;code&gt;&lt;%@ ... %&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;syntax&quot;&gt;[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/syntaxref12-149806.pdf JSP 1.2 Syntax Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;

Java code is not required to be complete or self-contained within a single scriptlet block. It can straddle markup content, provided that the page as a whole is syntactically correct. For example, any Java ''if/for/while'' blocks opened in one scriptlet must be correctly closed in a later scriptlet for the page to successfully compile. This allows code to be intermingled and can result in poor programming practices.

Content that falls inside a split block of Java code (spanning multiple scriptlets) is subject to that code. Content inside an ''if'' block will only appear in the output when the ''if'' condition evaluates to true. Likewise, content inside a loop construct may appear multiple times in the output, depending upon how many times the loop body runs.

The following would be a valid [[for loop]] in a JSP page:

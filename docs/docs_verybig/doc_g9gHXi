On the other hand, the prelude to the opera ''[[Tristan and Isolde]]'' exemplifies the variety that Wagner could extract through combining instruments from different [[Orchestra|orchestral families]] with his precise markings of [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] and [[Articulation (music)|articulation]].  In the opening phrase, the cellos are supported by wind instruments: [[File:Tristan prelude bars 1-7 version for audio.wav|thumb|Wagner, Tristan Prelude, opening]][[File:Tristan prelude bars 1-7.png|thumb|center|500px|Wagner, Tristan prelude, opening.]]

When this idea returns towards the end of the prelude, the [[Timbre|instrumental colors]] are varied subtly, with sounds that were new to the 19th century orchestra, such as the [[cor anglais]] and the [[bass clarinet]].  These, together with the ominous rumbling of the timpani effectively convey the brooding atmosphere: [[File:Tristan prelude closing bars version for audio.wav|thumb|Wagner, Tristan Prelude, closing bars]][[File:Wagner, Tristan prelude closing bars.png|thumb|center|500px|Wagner, Tristan Prelude, closing bars.]]

“It’s impressive to see how Wagner… produces balance in his works.  He is true genius in this respect, undeniably so, even down to the working out of the exact number of instruments.”  Boulez is “fascinated by the precision with which Wagner gauges orchestral balance, [which] … contains a multiplicity of details that he achieved with astonishing precision.”&lt;ref&gt;Boulez, P. (2003, p.52) Boulez on Conducting.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Roger Scruton]], &quot;Seldom since Bach's inspired use of [[obbligato]] parts in his cantatas have the instruments of the orchestra been so meticulously and lovingly adapted to their expressive role by Wagner in his later operas.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, R. (2016, p147) ''The Ring of Truth: The Wisdom of Wagner's'' Ring of the Nibelung.  Penguin Random House.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mahler===
William Austin (1966) says “[[Mahler]] expanded the orchestra, going ahead to a historic climax in the direction already marked by [[Beethoven]], [[Berlioz]] and [[Wagner]]… The purpose of this famous expansion was not a sheer increase in volume, but a greater variety of sound with more nearly continuous gradations… Mahler only occasionally required all his vast orchestra to play together, and his music was as often soft as loud.  Its colours were continually shifting, blending or contrasting with each other.”&lt;ref&gt;Austin, W. (1966, p. 123) ''Music in the 20th Century''.  London, Dent.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adorno]] (1971) similarly describes Mahler’s symphonic writing as characterised by “massive tutti effects” contrasted with “chamber-music procedures”.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, T.W. (1971, p.53) ''Mahler, a musical physiognomy''.  Trans. Jephcott.  University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The following passage from the first movement of his Symphony No. 4 illustrates this:[[File:Mahler 4 1st movt Fig 5.wav|thumb|Mahler, Symphony No. 4, first movement, Fig 5]][[File:Mahler 4 1st movt Fig 5.png|thumb|center|500px|Mahler, Symphony No. 4, first movement, Figure 5. ]] Only in the first bar of the above is there a full ensemble.  The remaining bars feature highly differentiated small groups of instruments.  Mahler’s experienced conductor’s ear led him to write detailed performance markings in his scores, including carefully calibrated dynamics.  For example, in bar 2 above, the low harp note is marked [[Dynamics (music)|''forte'']], the clarinets, [[Dynamics (music)|''mezzo-forte'']] and the horns [[Dynamics (music)|''piano'']].  Austin (1966) says that “Mahler cared about the finest nuances of loudness and tempo and worked tirelessly to fix these details in his scores.”&lt;ref&gt;Austin, W. (1966, p. 123) ''Music in the 20th Century''.  London, Dent.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahler’s imagination for sonority is exemplified in the closing bars of the slow movement of the Fourth Symphony, where there occurs what [[Walter Piston]] (1969, p.&amp;nbsp;140) describes as “an instance of inspired orchestration… To be noted are the sudden change of mode in the harmonic progression, the unusual spacing of the chord in measure 5, and the placing of the perfect fourth in the two flutes. The effect is quite unexpected and magical.”&lt;ref&gt;Piston, W. (1969) ''Orchestration''.  London, Victor Gollancz.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Mahler 4 3rd movement Fig 13.wav|thumb|Mahler Symphony No 4, third movement, Figure 13.]][[File:Mahler 4 third movement.png|thumb|center|500px|Mahler Symphony No 4, third movement, Figure 13.]]

===Debussy===

Apart from Mahler and [[Richard Strauss]], the major innovator in orchestration during the closing years of the nineteenth and the first decades of the twentieth century was Claude [[Debussy]].  According to Pierre [[Boulez]] (1975, p20) “Debussy’s orchestration… when compared with even such brilliant contemporaries as Strauss and Mahler… shows an infinitely fresher imagination.”  Boulez said that Debussy’s orchestration was “conceived from quite a different point of view; the number of instruments, their balance, the order in which they are used, their use itself, produces a different climate.”  Apart from the early impact of [[Wagner]], Debussy was also fascinated by music from Asia that according to Austin “he heard repeatedly and admired intensely at the Paris World exhibition of 1889”.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, W. (1966, p20) ''Music in the 20th century''. London, Dent.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both influences inform Debussy’s first major orchestral work, ''[[Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune|Prelude a l’après-midi d’un faune]]'' (1894).  Wagner’s influence can be heard in the strategic use of [[silence]], the sensitively differentiated orchestration and, above all in the striking [[half-diminished seventh]] chord spread between oboes and clarinets, reinforced by a [[glissando]] on the harp. Austin (1966, p.&amp;nbsp;16) continues “Only a composer thoroughly familiar with the [[Tristan chord]] could have conceived the beginning of the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYyK922PsUw ''Faune''].”&lt;ref&gt;Austin, W. (1966, p.16) ''Music in the 20th century''.  London, Dent.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Prelude a l'apres midi opening.png|thumb|center|600px|Debussy, Prelude a l'apres midi d'un faune, opening bars]]

Later in the ''Faune'', Debussy builds a complex texture, where, as Austin says, “[[Polyphony]] and orchestration overlap...He adds to all the devices of [[Mozart]], [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]], [[Berlioz]] and Wagner the possibilities that he learned from the [[heterophonic]] music of the Far East.... The first harp varies the flute parts in almost the same way that the smallest bells of a [[Java]]nese [[gamelan]] vary the slower basic melody.”&lt;ref&gt;Austin, W. (1966, p.20) ''Music in the 20th century''.  London, Dent.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Prelude a l'apres midi, from Fig 7- short score version.png|thumb|center|700px|Debussy, Prelude a l'apres midi d'un faune, Figure 7, bars 11-13]]

Debussy’s final orchestral work, the enigmatic ballet ''[[Jeux]]'' (1913) was composed nearly 20 years after the ''Faune''.  The opening bars feature divided strings, spread over a wide range, a harp doubling horns with the addition of the bell-like [[celesta]] in the 5th bar and the sultry voicing of the [[whole tone scale|whole tone]] chords in the woodwind:[[File:Jeux opening bars.png|thumb|center|500px|Debussy, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8qP_2i3HYA Jeux opening bars]]]

Jensen (2014, p.&amp;nbsp;228) says “Perhaps the greatest marvel of ''Jeux'' is its orchestration.  While working on the piano score, Debussy wrote: ‘I am thinking of that orchestral colour which seems to be illuminated from behind, and for which there are such marvellous displays in ''[[Parsifal]]''’  The idea, then, was to produce timbre without glare, subdued… but to do so with clarity and precision.”&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, E.F. (2014) ''Debussy''.  Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As adaptation==
In a more general sense, ''orchestration'' also refers to the re-adaptation of existing music into another medium, particularly a full or reduced orchestra. There are two general kinds of adaptation: [[Transcription (music)|transcription]], which closely follows the original piece,  and [[arrangement]], which tends to change significant aspects of the original piece. In terms of adaptation, ''orchestration'' applies, strictly speaking, only to writing for orchestra, whereas the term ''[[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]]'' applies to instruments used in the texture of the piece. In the study of orchestration&amp;nbsp;– in contradistinction to the practice&amp;nbsp;– the term ''instrumentation'' may also refer to consideration of the defining characteristics of individual instruments rather than to the art of combining instruments.

In commercial music, especially musical theatre and film music, independent orchestrators are often used because it is difficult to meet tight deadlines when the same person is required both to compose and to orchestrate. Frequently, when a stage musical is adapted to film, such as ''[[Camelot (film)|Camelot]]'' or ''[[Fiddler on the Roof (film)|Fiddler on the Roof]]'', the orchestrations for the film version are notably different from the stage ones. In other cases, such as ''[[Evita (1996 film)|Evita]]'', they are not, and are simply expanded versions from those used in the stage production.

Most orchestrators often work from a draft (sketch), or [[Sheet music#Types|short score]], that is, a score written on limited number of independent [[musical staff|musical staves]]. Some orchestrators, particularly those writing for the [[opera]] or [[music theatre]]s, prefer to work from a piano [[vocal score]] up, since the singers need to start rehearsing a piece long before the whole work is fully completed. That was, for instance, the method of composition of [[Jules Massenet]]. In other instances, simple cooperation between various creators is utilized, as when [[Jonathan Tunick]] orchestrates [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s songs, or when orchestration is done from a [[lead sheet]] (a simplified music notation for a song which includes just the melody and the [[chord progression]]). In the latter case, arranging as well as orchestration will be involved.

==Film orchestration==
Due to the enormous time constraints of film scoring schedules, most film composers employ orchestrators rather than doing the work themselves, although these orchestrators work under the close supervision of the composer. Some [[Film score|film composers]] have made the time to orchestrate their own music, including [[Bernard Herrmann]] (1911-1975), [[Georges Delerue]] (1925-1992), [[Ennio Morricone]] (1928-2020), [[John Williams]] (1932-) (his very detailed sketches are 99% orchestrated), [[Howard Shore]] (1946-), [[James Horner]] (1953-2015) (on Braveheart), [[Bruno Coulais]] (1954-), [[Rachel Portman]] (1960-), [[Philippe Rombi]] (1968-) and [[Abel Korzeniowski]] (1972-).

Although there have been hundreds of orchestrators in film over the years, the most prominent film orchestrators for the latter half of the 20th century were [[Jack Hayes (composer)|Jack Hayes]], [[Herbert W. Spencer]], [[Edward B. Powell (orchestrator)|Edward Powell]] (who worked almost exclusively with [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]]), [[Arthur Morton (composer)|Arthur Morton]], Greig McRitchie, and [[Alexander Courage]].  Some of the most in-demand orchestrators today (and of the past 30 years) include [[Jeff Atmajian]], [[Pete Anthony]], [[Brad Dechter]] (James Newton Howard, Christopher Young, Theodore Shapiro, Teddy Castellucci, Danny Elfman, John Powell, Marco Beltrami, John Debney, Marc Shaiman, Michael Giacchino), [[Conrad Pope]] (John Williams, Alexandre Desplat, Jerry Goldsmith, James Newton Howard, Alan Silvestri, James Horner, Mark Isham, John Powell, Michael Convertino, Danny Elfman, Howard Shore), [[Eddie Karam]] (John Williams, James Horner), [[Bruce Fowler]] (Hans Zimmer, Klaus Badelt, Harry Gregson-Williams, Steve Jablonsky, Mark Mancina, John Powell), [[John Ashton Thomas]] (John Powell, John Debney, Alan Silvestri, James Newton Howard, Henry Jackman, Lyle Workman, Theodore Shapiro, John Ottman, John Paesano, Alex Heffes, Christophe Beck), [[Robert Elhai]] (Elliot Goldenthal, Michael Kamen, Ed Shearmur, Brian Tyler, Klaus Badelt, Ilan Eshkeri ) and [[J.A.C. Redford]] (James Horner, Thomas Newman). 

[[Conrad Salinger]] was the most prominent orchestrator of MGM musicals from the 1940s to 1962, orchestrating such famous films as ''[[Singin' in the Rain (film)|Singin' in the Rain]]'', ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]'', and ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]''. In the 1950s, film composer [[John Williams]] frequently spent time with Salinger informally learning the craft of orchestration. [[Robert Russell Bennett]] (George Gershwin, Rodgers and Hammerstein) was one of America's most prolific orchestrators (particularly of Broadway shows) of the 20th century, sometimes scoring over 80 pages a day.

===Process===
Most films require 30 to 120 minutes of musical score. Each individual piece of music in a film is called a &quot;cue&quot;. There are roughly 20-80 cues per film. A dramatic film may require slow and sparse music while an action film may require 80 cues of highly active music. Each cue can range in length from five seconds to more than ten minutes as needed per scene in the film. After the composer is finished composing the cue, this sketch score is delivered to the orchestrator either as hand written or computer generated. Most composers in Hollywood today compose their music using sequencing software (e.g. [[Digital Performer]], [[Logic Pro]], or [[Cubase]]). A sketch score can be generated through the use of a [[MIDI]] file which is then imported into a [[scorewriter|music notation program]] such as [[Finale (software)|Finale]] or [[Sibelius (software)|Sibelius]]. Thus begins the job of the orchestrator.

Every composer works differently and the orchestrator's job is to understand what is required from one composer to the next. If the music is created with sequencing software then the orchestrator is given a MIDI sketch score and a synthesized recording of the cue. The sketch score only contains the musical notes (e.g. eighth notes, quarter notes, etc.) with no phrasing, articulations, or dynamics. The orchestrator studies this synthesized &quot;mockup&quot; recording listening to dynamics and phrasing (just as the composer has played them in).  He then accurately tries to represent these elements in the orchestra. However some voicings on a synthesizer ([[synthestration]]) will not work in the same way when orchestrated for the live orchestra.

The sound samples are often doubled up very prominently and thickly with other sounds in order to get the music to &quot;speak&quot; louder. The orchestrator sometimes changes these synth voicings to traditional orchestral voicings in order to make the music flow better. He may move intervals up or down the octave (or omit them entirely), double certain passages with other instruments in the orchestra, add percussion instruments to provide colour, and add Italian performance marks (e.g. Allegro con brio, Adagio, ritardando, dolce, staccato, etc.). If a composer writes a large action cue, and no woodwinds are used, the orchestrator will often add woodwinds by doubling the brass music up an octave. The orchestra size is determined from the music budget of the film.

The orchestrator is told in advance the number of instruments he has to work with and has to abide by what is available. A big-budget film may be able to afford a [[Romantic music era]]-orchestra with over 100 musicians. In contrast, a low-budget [[independent film]] may only be able to afford a 20 performer [[chamber orchestra]] or a [[jazz quartet]]. Sometimes a composer will write a three-part chord for three flutes, although only two flutes have been hired. The orchestrator decides where to put the third note. For example, the orchestrator could have the clarinet (a woodwind that blends well with flute) play the third note. After the orchestrated cue is complete it is delivered to the copying house (generally by placing it on a computer server) so that each instrument of the orchestra can be electronically extracted, printed, and delivered to the scoring stage.

The major film composers in Hollywood each have a lead orchestrator. Generally the lead orchestrator attempts to orchestrate as much of the music as possible if time allows. If the schedule is too demanding, a team of orchestrators (ranging from two to eight) will work on a film. The lead orchestrator decides on the assignment of cues to other orchestrators on the team. Most films can be orchestrated in one to two weeks with a team of five orchestrators. New orchestrators trying to obtain work will often approach a film composer asking to be hired. They are generally referred to the lead orchestrator for consideration. At the scoring stage the orchestrator will often assist the composer in the recording booth giving suggestions on how to improve the performance, the music, or the recording. If the composer is conducting, sometimes the orchestrator will remain in the recording booth to assist as a producer. Sometimes the roles are reversed with the orchestrator [[conducting]] and the composer producing from the booth.

'''Edgar'''  ({{lang-ang|Ēadgār}}, {{IPAc-ang|ēa|d|g|ā|r}}; {{circa|943}}{{snd}}8 July 975), known as '''the Peaceful''' or '''the Peaceable''', was [[King of the English]] from 959 until his death. He was the younger son of [[Edmund I]] and [[Ælfgifu of Shaftesbury]], and came to the throne as a teenager, following the death of his older brother [[Eadwig]]. As king, Edgar further consolidated the political unity achieved by his predecessors, with his reign being noted for its relative stability. His most trusted advisor was [[Dunstan]], whom he recalled from exile and made [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. The pinnacle of Edgar's reign was his coronation at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in 973, which was organised by Dunstan and forms the basis for [[Coronation of the British monarch|the current coronation ceremony]]. After his death he was succeeded by his son [[Edward the Martyr|Edward]], although the succession was disputed.

==Early years and accession==
Edgar was the son of [[Edmund I]] and [[Ælfgifu of Shaftesbury]]. Upon the death of King Edmund in 946, Edgar's uncle, [[Eadred]], ruled until 955. Eadred was succeeded by his nephew, [[Eadwig]], Edmund's eldest son.

Eadwig was not a popular king, and his reign was marked by conflict with nobles and the Church, primarily [[St Dunstan]] and [[Oda of Canterbury|Archbishop Oda]]. In 957, the thanes of Mercia and Northumbria changed their allegiance to Edgar.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;

==Government==
One of Edgar's first actions was to recall [[Dunstan]] from exile and have him made [[Bishop of Worcester]] and Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey, subsequently [[Bishop of London]] and later, [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Dunstan remained Edgar's advisor throughout his reign. While Edgar may not have been a particularly peaceable man{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}, his reign was peaceful. The [[Kingdom of England]] was well established, and Edgar consolidated the political unity achieved by his predecessors. By the end of his reign, England was sufficiently unified that it was unlikely to regress back to a state of division among rival kingships, as it had to an extent under the reign of [[Eadred]]. [[William Blackstone]] mentions that King Edgar standardised measure throughout the realm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lonang.com/exlibris/blackstone/bla-107.htm Blackstone, &quot;Of the King's Prerogative&quot; Bk. 1, Ch. 7]&lt;/ref&gt; According to George Molyneaux, Edgar's reign, &quot;far more than the reigns of either Alfred or Æthelstan, was probably the most pivotal phase in the development of the institutional structures that were fundamental to royal rule in the eleventh-century kingdom&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Molyneaux|first=George|title=The Formation of the English Kingdom in the Tenth Century|year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-0-19-871791-1|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, an early eleventh century king [[Cnut the Great]] states in a letter to his subjects that &lt;nowiki&gt;''it is my will that all the nation, ecclesiastical and lay, shall steadfastly observe Edgar's laws, which all men have chosen and sworn at Oxford''&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Trow, ''Cnut'', pp.168–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[English Benedictine Reform|Monastic Reform Movement]] that introduced the [[Benedictine Rule]] to England's monastic communities peaked during the era of Dunstan, [[Æthelwold of Winchester|Æthelwold]], and [[Oswald of Worcester|Oswald]] (historians continue to debate the extent and significance of this movement).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of the Peoples of the British Isles: From Prehistoric Times to 1688|first=Stanford|last=Lehmberg|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-1134415281|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 963, Edgar allegedly killed [[Æthelwald, Ealdorman of East Anglia|Earl Æthelwald]], his rival in love, near present-day [[Longparish]], Hampshire.&lt;ref name=&quot;BLB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-139701-deadman-s-plack-monument-longparish|title=Deadman's Plack Monument – Longparish – Hampshire – England|work=British Listed Buildings|accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was commemorated by the [[Dead Man's Plack]], erected in 1825.&lt;ref name=&quot;BLB&quot; /&gt; In 1875, [[Edward Augustus Freeman]] [[debunker|debunked]] the story as a &quot;tissue of romance&quot; in his book, ''Historic Essays'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Edward Augustus|title=Historic Essays|year=1875|publisher=MacMillan &amp; Co |pages=[https://archive.org/details/historicalessays00free/page/10 10]–25 |url=https://archive.org/details/historicalessays00free}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, his arguments were rebutted by naturalist [[William Henry Hudson]] in his 1920 book ''Dead Man's Plack and an Old Thorn''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hudson&quot;/&gt;

==Coronation at Bath==
Edgar was crowned at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] and along with his wife Ælfthryth was anointed, setting a precedent for a coronation of a queen in England itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Matilda of Scotland: a Study in Medieval Queenship | last=Honeycutt | first=Lois | page=35 | year=2003 | publisher=The Boydell Press | location=Woodbridge }}&lt;/ref&gt; Edgar's coronation did not happen until 973, in an imperial ceremony planned not as the initiation, but as the culmination of his reign (a move that must have taken a great deal of preliminary diplomacy). This service, devised by Dunstan himself and celebrated with a poem in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', forms the basis of the present-day [[coronation of the British monarch|British coronation ceremony]].

{{main|King Edgar's council at Chester}}
The symbolic coronation was an important step; other kings of Britain came and gave their allegiance to Edgar shortly afterwards at [[Chester]]. Six kings in Britain, including the [[Kenneth II of Scotland|King of Scots]] and the [[Máel Coluim I of Strathclyde|King of Strathclyde]], pledged their faith that they would be the king's liege-men on sea and land.  Later chroniclers made the kings into eight, all plying the oars of Edgar's state barge on the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Norman Conquest: A New Introduction|first=R|last=Huscroft|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-1317866275|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such embellishments may not be factual, and what actually happened is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Edgar, King of the English, 959-975: New Interpretations|first=D. G.|last=Scragg|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd|year=2008|isbn=978-1843833994|pages=121|quote=Precisely what happened at Chester has been irretrievably obscured by the embellishments of twelfth-century historians}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Marriages and children==
Edgar is believed to have married first Æthelflæd the White, daughter of Ordmaer, Ealdorman of the East Anglians, between 957 and 959. Their only child was:
* [[Edward the Martyr]] born likely about 960
After Æthelflæd's death about 962, Edgar abducted and married [[Wulfthryth of Wilton]]. He carried her off from the nunnery at Wilton Abbey. They lived as husband and wife at his residence in [[Kemsing]] for 2 years. It is unclear if they actually married or not. After the birth of one daughter, Wulfthryth was returned to Wilton Abbey, along with their child, and became a nun, eventually Abbess. Edgar and Wulfthryth's only child was:
* [[Edith of Wilton]] also known as Saint Edith
About 964/965 Edgar married, possibly for a third time, to [[Ælfthryth, wife of Edgar|Ælfthryth]], widow of [[Æthelwald, Ealdorman of East Anglia]], Edgar's adopted brother. Ælfthryth was the daughter of Ealdorman [[Ordgar]] and his wife, a member of the royal family of Wessex. Legend has it that Edgar heard of Ælfthryth's great beauty and sent Æthelwald to arrange marriage for him (Edgar) but Æthelwald instead married her himself. In retaliation Æthelwald was killed 'in a hunting accident' and Edgar married her as he had wanted. It is not known if this is true or simply romantic fiction. Edgar and Ælfthryth had two sons:
* Edmund Atheling (born c. 966 - died c.970)
* [[Æthelred the Unready]] (born c. 968 - d. 23 April 1016)
After the death of Edward the Martyr in 978, Æthelred was not yet old enough to rule on his own and Ælfthryth acted as regent.

==Death==
Edgar died on 8 July 975 at [[Winchester, Hampshire]]. He was buried at [[Glastonbury Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;[[ODNB]]&lt;/ref&gt; He left two sons, his successor [[Edward the Martyr|Edward]], who was probably his illegitimate son by Æthelflæd, daughter of ealdorman Ordmaer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=D. J. V.| title=The Anti-Monastic Reaction in the Reign of Edward the Martyr|journal=The Cambridge Historical Journal|year=1952|volume=10|issue=3|pages=254–270|doi=10.1017/S147469130000295X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Æthelred the Unready|Æthelred]], the younger, the child of his wife [[Ælfthryth, wife of Edgar|Ælfthryth]]. Edgar also had a possibly illegitimate daughter by Wulfthryth, who later became abbess of Wilton. She was joined there by her daughter, [[Edith of Wilton]], who lived there as a nun until her death. Both women were later regarded as saints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Barbara|last = Yorke|authorlink=Barbara Yorke| publisher=Oxford University Press | encyclopedia= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | title=Wulfthryth (St Wulfthryth) (d. c.1000), abbess of Wilton | year = 2004 | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/49423/?back=,8463,49423,8482,49423,8482| accessdate=17 November 2012 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/49423  }} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Williams |first=Ann |authorlink=Ann Williams (historian) | title=Edgar (called Edgar Pacificus) (943/4–975) |encyclopedia= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher= Oxford University Press |year=2004 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8463?docPos=1 |accessdate=16 May 2012 |doi= 10.1093/ref:odnb/8463 }}{{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

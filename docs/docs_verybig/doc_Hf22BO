Examples of primary time, (''i.e.'', frequency standards) are [[caesium standard]]s and [[hydrogen]] [[maser]]s.

The international [[second]] is based on the [[microwave]] [[frequency]] (9,192,631,770&amp;nbsp;Hz) associated with the atomic resonance of the [[hyperfine level|hyperfine]] [[ground state]] levels of the [[caesium|caesium-133]] atom in a magnetically neutral environment. Realizable caesium frequency standards use a strong electromagnet to deliberately introduce a [[magnetic field]] which overwhelms that of the Earth. The presence of this strong magnetic field introduces a slight, but known, increase in the atomic [[resonance]] frequency. However, very small variations in the calibration of the electric current in the electromagnet introduce minuscule [[frequency]] variations among different caesium oscillators.

In [[telecommunication]], a '''private line''' is typically a telephone company service that uses a dedicated, usually unswitched point-to-point circuit, but it may involve private [[circuit switching|switching]] arrangements, or predefined [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] physical or virtual paths.  Most private lines connect only two locations, but some have multiple drop points. If the circuit is used for interconnecting switching systems, including manual switchboards, it is often called a [[tie line]].

Among subscribers to the [[public switched telephone network]], the term ''private line'' is often erroneously used to describe an ''individual'' [[telephone line]] for service for only one subscriber, as opposed to a [[party line (telephony)|party line]] with multiple stations connected.

In radio or [[wireless telephony]], ''Private Line'' is a term trademarked by Motorola to describe an implementation of a [[Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System]] (CTCSS), a method of using low-frequency subaudible tones to share a single radio channel among multiple users. Each user group would use a different low frequency tone.  Motorola's trade name, especially the abbreviation ''PL'', has become a [[genericized trademark]] for the method. General Electric used the term ''Channel Guard'' to describe the same system and other manufacturers used other terms.

A later digital version of a private line is called ''digital private line'' (DPL).

Advantages of private lines are:
* High security as one dedicated link is provided
* Always available
* Instant data transmission

The '''propagation constant''' of a sinusoidal [[electromagnetic wave]] is a measure of the change undergone by the [[amplitude]] and [[phase (waves)|phase]] of the wave as it [[wave propagation|propagates]] in a given direction. The quantity being measured can be the [[voltage]], the [[electric current|current]] in a [[electronic circuit|circuit]], or a field vector such as [[electric field strength]] or [[flux density]]. The propagation constant itself measures the change [[per unit length]], but it is otherwise dimensionless. In the context of [[Two port networks|two-port networks]] and their cascades, '''propagation constant '''measures the change undergone by the source quantity as it propagates from one port to the next.

The propagation constant's value is expressed [[logarithm]]ically, almost universally to the base ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]'', rather than the more usual base 10 that is used in [[telecommunication]]s in other situations. The quantity measured, such as voltage, is expressed as a sinusoidal [[phasor]]. The phase of the sinusoid varies with distance which results in the propagation constant being a [[complex number]], the [[imaginary number|imaginary]] part being caused by the phase change.

==Alternative names==

The term &quot;propagation constant&quot; is somewhat of a misnomer as it usually varies strongly with ''ฯ''.  It is probably the most widely used term but there are a large variety of alternative names used by various authors for this quantity.  These include '''transmission parameter''', '''transmission function''', '''propagation parameter''', '''propagation coefficient''' and '''transmission constant'''.  If the plural is used, it suggests that ''ฮฑ'' and ''ฮฒ'' are being referenced separately but collectively as in '''transmission parameters''', '''propagation parameters''', etc.  In transmission line theory, ''ฮฑ'' and ''ฮฒ''  are counted among the &quot;secondary coefficients&quot;, the term ''secondary'' being used to contrast to the ''[[primary line coefficients]]''.  The primary coefficients are the physical properties of the line, namely R,C,L and G, from which the secondary coefficients may be derived using the [[telegrapher's equation]].  Note that in the field of transmission lines, the term [[transmission coefficient]] has a different meaning despite the similarity of name: it is the companion of the [[reflection coefficient]].

==Definition==

The propagation constant, symbol &lt;math&gt;{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;, for a given system is defined by the ratio of the [[Phasor|complex amplitude]] at the source of the wave to the complex amplitude at some distance ''x'', such that,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{A_0}{A_x}=e^{\gamma x}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the propagation constant is a complex quantity we can write:

:&lt;math display=&quot;block&quot; qid=Q1434913&gt;\gamma = \alpha +i \beta \,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''ฮฑ'', the real part, is called the [[#Attenuation constant|attenuation constant]]
*''ฮฒ'', the imaginary part, is called the [[#Phase constant|phase constant]]

That ''ฮฒ'' does indeed represent phase can be seen from [[Euler's formula]]:

:&lt;math&gt;e^{i\theta}=\cos{\theta}+i\sin{\theta}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

which is a sinusoid which varies in phase as ''ฮธ'' varies but does not vary in amplitude because

:&lt;math&gt;\left|e^{i\theta}\right|=\sqrt{\cos^2{\theta}+\sin^2{\theta}}=1&lt;/math&gt;

The reason for the use of base ''e'' is also now made clear.  The imaginary phase constant, ''iฮฒ'', can be added directly to the attenuation constant, ''ฮฑ'', to form a single complex number that can be handled in one mathematical operation provided they are to the same base.  Angles measured in radians require base ''e'', so the attenuation is likewise in base ''e''.

The propagation constant for copper (or any other conductor) lines can be calculated from the primary line coefficients by means of the relationship

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma=\sqrt{ZY}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;Z=R+i\omega L\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, the series [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the line per unit length and,

:&lt;math&gt;Y=G+i\omega C\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, the shunt [[admittance]] of the line per unit length.

===Plane wave===
The propagation factor of a plane wave traveling in a linear media the x direction is given by
:&lt;math&gt;  P = e^{-\gamma x} &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \alpha + i\beta = \sqrt{i \omega \mu (\sigma + i \omega \epsilon)}\; &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jordon&amp;Balman&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last1=Jordon|first1= Edward C.|last2=Balman|first2=Keith G. |year= 1968 |title= Electromagnetic Waves and Radiating Systems |edition= 2nd |publisher= Prentice-Hall }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|126}}
:&lt;math&gt;x =&lt;/math&gt;  distance traveled in the x direction
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha =&lt;/math&gt;  [[attenuation constant]] in the units of [[neper]]s/meter
:&lt;math&gt;\beta =&lt;/math&gt;  [[phase constant]] in the units of [[radian]]s/meter
:&lt;math&gt;\omega=&lt;/math&gt;  frequency in radians/second
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma =&lt;/math&gt;  [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]] of the media
:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon = \epsilon' - i\epsilon'' \;&lt;/math&gt; = [[Permittivity#Complex permittivity|complex permitivity]] of the media
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \mu' - i\mu'' \;&lt;/math&gt; = [[Permeability (electromagnetism)#Complex permeability|complex permeability]] of the media
:&lt;math&gt;i=\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; 
The sign convention is chosen for consistency with propagation in lossy media.  If the attenuation constant is positive, then the wave amplitude decreases as the wave propagates in the x direction.

[[Wavelength]], [[Phase velocity|phase velocity]], and [[skin effect|skin depth]] have simple relationships to the components of the propagation constant:
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac {2 \pi} \beta  \qquad  v_p = \frac \omega \beta  \qquad   \delta =  \frac 1 \alpha  &lt;/math&gt;

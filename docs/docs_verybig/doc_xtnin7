As winter begins, weather becomes severe. Depressions enter from the west very frequently and they either bounce north to the [[British Isles]] or they enter the [[Ebro Valley]], dry out, and are finally reborn in the form of powerful thunderstorms as they reach the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. These depressions cause severe weather at sea and bring light though very constant rain to its shores (known as ''[[drizzle|orballo]]'', ''sirimiri'', ''morrina'', ''orbayu'', ''orpin'' or ''calabobos''). Sometimes powerful windstorms form if the pressure falls rapidly (Galernas), traveling along the [[Gulf Stream]] at great speed, resembling a hurricane and finally crashing in this bay with their maximum power, such as the [[Klaus (storm)|Klaus storm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marineinsight.com/life-at-sea/why-the-bay-of-biscay-is-dangerous-for-ships/|title=Why the Bay of Biscay is Dangerous for Ships?|date=2011-10-21|website=Marine Insight|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gulf Stream]] enters the bay following the continental shelf's border anti-clockwise (the [[Rennell Current]]), keeping temperatures moderate all year long.

===Main cities===

The main cities on the shores of the Bay of Biscay are [[Bordeaux]], [[Bayonne]], [[Biarritz]], [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Nantes]], [[La Rochelle]], [[Donostia-San Sebastián]], [[Bilbao]], [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]], [[Gijón]] and [[Avilés]].

==History==
The southern end of the gulf is also called in Spanish ''&quot;Mar Cantábrico&quot;'' ([[Cantabrian Sea]]), from the [[Estaca de Bares]], as far as the mouth of [[Adour]] river, but this name is not generally used in English. It was named by Romans in the 1st century BC as ''Sinus Cantabrorum'' (Bay of the [[Cantabri]]) and also, ''Mare Gallaecum'' (the Sea of the [[Galicians]]). On some medieval maps, the Bay of Biscay is marked as ''El Mar del los Vascos'' (the Basque Sea).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El mar de los vascos, II: del Golfo de Vizcaya al Mediterráneo|url=http://www.euskomedia.org/PDFAnlt/jgl/07001110.pdf |publisher=Euskomedia.org |accessdate=2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bay of Biscay has been the site of many famous naval engagements over the centuries. In 1592 the Spanish defeated an English fleet during the [[Battle of the Bay of Biscay (1592)|Battle of the Bay of Biscay]]. The [[Order of Battle in the Biscay campaign of June 1795|Biscay campaign of June 1795]] consisted of a series of manoeuvres and two battles fought between the British [[Channel Fleet]] and the French Atlantic Fleet off the southern coast of [[Brittany]] during the second year of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. {{USS|Californian|1900|6}} sank here after striking a [[naval mine]] on 22 June 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USS Californian (1918–1918)|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh-usn/usnsh-c/califrnn.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041224191412/http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh-usn/usnsh-c/califrnn.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2004-12-24|publisher=History.navy.mil|accessdate=2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920 {{SS|Afrique|1907|6}} sank after losing power and drifting into a reef in a storm with the loss of 575 lives. On 28 December 1943, the [[Battle of the Bay of Biscay]] was fought between {{HMS|Glasgow|C21|6}} and {{HMS|Enterprise|D52|6}} and a group of German destroyers as part of [[Operation Stonewall]] during [[World War II]]. {{GS|U-667||2}} sank on 25 August 1944 in position {{coord|46|00|N|01|30|W}}, when she struck a mine. All hands were lost.

On 12 April 1970, {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-8}} sank in the Bay of Biscay due to a fire that crippled the submarine's nuclear reactors. An attempt to save the sub failed, resulting in the death of forty sailors and the loss of four nuclear torpedoes. Due to the great depth ({{cvt|15,000|ft|m|disp=or}}), no salvage operation was attempted.

===Marine mammals===
{{See also|Whale watching}}
The car ferries from [[Gijón]] to [[Nantes]]/[[Saint-Nazaire]], [[Portsmouth]] to [[Bilbao]] and from [[Plymouth]], [[Portsmouth]] and [[Poole]] to [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]] provide one of the most convenient ways to see [[cetacean]]s in European waters. Often specialist groups take the ferries to hear more information. Volunteers and employees of ORCA regularly observe and monitor cetacean activity from the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] of the ships on [[Brittany Ferries]]' Portsmouth to Santander route.  Many species of [[whale]]s and [[dolphin]]s can be seen in this area. Most importantly, it is one of the few places in the world where the [[beaked whale]]s, such as the [[Cuvier's beaked whale]], have been observed relatively frequently. Biscay Dolphin Research monitored cetacean activity from the [[P&amp;O Ferries]] cruiseferry ''[[Pride of Bilbao]]'', on voyages from Portsmouth to Bilbao.

[[North Atlantic right whale]]s, one of the most endangered whales, once came to the bay for feeding and probably for calving as well, but [[History of Basque whaling|whaling activities by Basque people]] almost wiped them out sometime prior to the 1850s. The eastern population of this species are considered to be almost extinct, and there has been no record of right whales in the Bay of Biscay except for a pair in 1977 (possibly a mother and calf) at {{coord|43|00|N|10|30|W}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Reeves, R.R. |author2=Mitchell, E. |name-list-style=amp |year=1986 |title=American pelagic whaling for right whales in the North Atlantic |journal=Report of the International Whaling Commission |issue=Special Issue 10 |pages=221–254 |url=http://iwc.int/cache/downloads/brhgc3aemagcsoos0kocgcggc/RIWC-SI10-pp221-254.pdf |accessdate=2013-10-09 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and another pair in June 1980. Other records in the late 20th century include one off [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] at {{coord|43|00|N|10|30|W}} in September 1977 reported by a whaling company and another one seen off the Iberian Peninsula.

The best areas to see the larger cetaceans are in the deep waters beyond the [[continental shelf]], particularly over the [[Santander Canyon]] and [[Torrelavega Canyon]] in the south of the Bay.

The alga ''[[Colpomenia peregrina]]'' was introduced and first noticed in 1906 by oyster fishermen in the Bay of Biscay.

''[[Grammatostomias flagellibarba]]'' (scaleless dragonfish) are native to these waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.fishbase.us/summary/Grammatostomias-flagellibarba.html|editor=Froese, R. |editor2=D.

{{Grammar series}}

'''English grammar''' is the way in which meanings are encoded into wordings in the [[English language]]. This includes the structure of [[word]]s, [[phrase]]s, [[clause]]s, [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]], and the structure of whole texts.

There are historical, social, cultural, and regional varieties of English. Divergences from the [[grammar]] described here occur in some [[List of dialects of the English language|dialects]]. This article describes a generalized, present-day [[Standard English]] – a form of speech and writing used in public discourse, including broadcasting, education, entertainment, government, and news, over a range of [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] from formal to informal. There are differences in grammar among the [[standard variety|standard forms]] of [[British English|British]], [[American English|American]], and [[Australian English]], although these are more minor than differences in [[lexicon|vocabulary]] and [[English phonology|pronunciation]].

[[Modern English]] has largely abandoned the [[inflectional]] [[grammatical case|case system]] of Indo-European in favor of [[analytic language|analytic]] constructions. The [[personal pronoun]]s retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class (a remnant of the more extensive Germanic case system of Old English). For other pronouns, and all nouns, adjectives, and articles, grammatical function is indicated only by [[word order]], by [[preposition]]s, and by the &quot;[[Saxon genitive]] or [[English possessive]]&quot; (''-'s'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Huddleston phrasal genitive&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|quote=We conclude that both head and phrasal genitives involve case inflection. With head genitives it is always a noun that inflects, while the phrasal genitive can apply to words of most classes. |pages=479–481|chapter= Nouns and noun phrases |last1=Payne|first1= John |last2=Huddleston |first2= Rodney |author-link2=Rodney Huddleston |editor1-last=Huddleston |editor1-first=Rodney |editor1-link=Rodney Huddleston |editor2-last= Pullum |editor2-first= Geoffrey |editor2-link=Geoffrey Pullum |title=The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge; New York |isbn=0-521-43146-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight [[Part of speech|&quot;word classes&quot; or &quot;parts of speech&quot;]] are commonly distinguished in English: [[noun]]s, [[Determiner (linguistics)|determiner]]s, [[pronoun]]s, [[verb]]s, [[adjective]]s, [[adverb]]s, [[preposition]]s, and [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]]s. Nouns form the largest word class, and verbs the second-largest. Unlike nouns in almost all other [[Indo-European languages]], English nouns do not have [[grammatical gender]].

==Word classes and phrases==
Nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs form [[Open class (linguistics)|open class]]es – word classes that readily accept new members, such as the noun ''[[celebutante]]'' (a celebrity who frequents the fashion circles), and other similar relatively new words.&lt;ref name=&quot;carter-mccarthy-p296&quot;/&gt; The others are considered to be [[closed class]]es. For example, it is rare for a new pronoun to enter the language. Determiners, traditionally classified along with adjectives, have not always been regarded as a separate part of speech. [[Interjections]] are another word class, but these are not described here as they do not form part of the [[clause]] and [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] structure of the language.&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p296&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists generally accept nine English word classes: nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, determiners, and exclamations. English words are not generally marked for word class. It is not usually possible to tell from the form of a word which class it belongs to except, to some extent, in the case of words with inflectional endings or derivational suffixes. On the other hand, most words belong to more than one-word class. For example, ''run'' can serve as either a verb or a noun (these are regarded as two different [[lexeme]]s).&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p297&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lexemes may be [[inflected]] to express different grammatical categories. The lexeme ''run'' has the forms ''runs'', ''ran'', ''runny'', ''runner'', and ''running''.&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p297/&gt;  Words in one class can sometimes be [[Morphological derivation|derived]] from those in another. This has the potential to give rise to new words. The noun ''aerobics'' has recently given rise to the adjective ''aerobicized''.&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p297/&gt;

Words combine to form [[phrase]]s. A phrase typically serves the same function as a word from some particular word class.&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p297/&gt; For example, ''my very good friend Peter'' is a phrase that can be used in a sentence as if it were a noun, and is therefore called a [[noun phrase]]. Similarly, [[adjectival phrase]]s and [[adverbial phrase]]s function as if they were adjectives or adverbs, but with other types of phrases, the terminology has different implications. For example, a [[verb phrase]] consists of a verb together with any objects and other dependents; a [[adpositional phrase|prepositional phrase]] consists of a preposition and its [[complement (linguistics)|complement]] (and is therefore usually a type of adverbial phrase); and a [[determiner phrase]] is a type of noun phrase containing a determiner.

===Nouns===
Many common [[suffix]]es form nouns from other nouns or from other types of words, such as ''-age'' (as in ''shrinkage''), ''-hood'' (as in ''sisterhood''), and so on,&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p297/&gt; although many nouns are base forms not containing any such suffix (such as ''cat'', ''grass'', ''France'').  Nouns are also often created by [[Conversion (word formation)|conversion]] of verbs or adjectives, as with the words ''talk'' and ''reading'' (''a boring talk'', ''the assigned reading'').

Nouns are sometimes classified semantically (by their meanings) as [[Noun#Proper nouns and common nouns|proper nouns and common nouns]] (''Cyrus'', ''China'' vs. ''frog'', ''milk'') or as [[Noun#Concrete nouns and abstract nouns|concrete nouns and abstract nouns]] (''book'', ''laptop'' vs. ''embarrassment'', ''prejudice'').&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p298/&gt; A grammatical distinction is often made between [[count noun|count (countable) nouns]] such as ''clock'' and ''city'', and [[mass noun|non-count (uncountable) nouns]] such as ''milk'' and ''decor''.&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p299&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some nouns can function both as countable and as uncountable such as the word &quot;wine&quot; (''This is a good wine'', ''I prefer red wine'').

Countable nouns generally have [[Grammatical number|singular]] and [[plural]] forms.&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p298&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases the plural is formed from the singular by adding ''-[e]s'' (as in ''dogs'', ''bushes''), although there are also [[irregular plural|irregular]] forms (''woman/women'', ''foot/feet'', etc.), including cases where the two forms are identical (''sheep'', ''series''). For more details, see [[English plural]]. Certain nouns can be used with plural verbs even though they are singular in form, as in ''The government were ...'' (where ''the government'' is considered to refer to the people constituting the government). This is a form of [[synesis]]; it is more common in British than American English. See {{slink|English plural|Singulars with collective meaning treated as plural}}.

English nouns are not marked for [[case (grammar)|case]] as they are in some languages, but they have [[possessive (linguistics)|possessive]] forms, through the addition of ''-'s'' (as in ''John's'', ''children's'') or just an [[apostrophe]] (with no change in pronunciation) in the case of ''-[e]s'' plurals and sometimes other words ending with ''-s'' (''the dogs' owners'', ''Jesus' love''). More generally, the ending can be applied to noun phrases (as in ''the man you saw yesterday's sister''); see below. The possessive form can be used either as a determiner (''John's cat'') or as a noun phrase (''John's is the one next to Jane's'').

The [[English possessive|status of the possessive]] as an affix or a clitic is the subject of debate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hudson 2013&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |isbn=9789027273000|date=2013|publisher= John Benjamins Publishing Company |title= Morphosyntactic Categories and the Expression of Possession |editor1-last=Börjars |editor1-first=Kersti |editor2-last=Denison |editor2-first=David |editor1-link= David Denison |editor3-last=Scott |editor3-first=Alan |chapter= A cognitive analysis of John's hat |last1=Hudson|first1= Richard |author-link1=Richard Hudson (linguist) |pages=123–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot; Börjars 2013&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |isbn=9789027273000|date=2013|publisher= John Benjamins Publishing Company |title= Morphosyntactic Categories and the Expression of Possession |editor1-last=Börjars |editor1-first=Kersti |editor2-last=Denison |editor2-first=David | author-link1= David Denison |editor3-last=Scott |editor3-first=Alan |chapter= Expression of Possession in English |last1 =Börjars | first1=Kersti |last2 =Denison | first2=David |editor1-link= David Denison |last3 =Krajewski | first3=Grzegorz |last4 =Scott | first4=Alan |pages=149–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from the noun inflection of languages such as German, in that the [[genitive]] ending may attach to the last word of the phrase. To account for this, the possessive can be analysed, for instance as a clitic construction (an &quot;[[enclitic]] [[postposition]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Quirk group genitive&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|quote=[the ''-s'' ending is] more appropriately described as an enclitic postposition'|page=[https://archive.org/details/comprehensivegra00quir/page/328 328]|last1=Quirk|first1=Randolph|authorlink1=Randolph Quirk|last2=Greenbaum|first2=Sidney|authorlink2=Sidney Greenbaum|last3=Leech|first3=Geoffrey|authorlink3=Geoffrey Leech|last4=Svartvik|first4=Jan|year=1985|title=A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language|location=Harlow|publisher=Longman|isbn=978-0-582-51734-9|url=https://archive.org/details/comprehensivegra00quir/page/328}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or as an inflection&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford English Grammar, Case&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|quote=In speech the genitive is signalled in singular nouns by an inflection that has the same pronunciation variants as for plural nouns in the common case|pages=109–110|last1=Greenbaum|first1= Sidney |author-link=Sidney Greenbaum |title=The Oxford English Grammar |year=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-861250-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=In writing, the inflection of regular nouns is realized in the singular by apostrophe + ''s'' (''boy's''), and in the regular plural by the apostrophe following the plural ''s'' (''boys{{'}}'')|last1=Quirk|first1=Randolph |last2=Greenbaum |first2=Sidney |last3=Leech |first3=Geoffrey |last4=Svartik |first4=Jan |title=A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language |url=https://archive.org/details/comprehensivegra00quir|url-access=registration|publisher=Longman |year=1985|page=[https://archive.org/details/comprehensivegra00quir/page/319 319]}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the last word of a phrase (&quot;edge inflection&quot;).

====Phrases====
[[Noun phrase]]s are phrases that function grammatically as nouns within sentences, for example as the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] or [[object (grammar)|object]] of a verb. Most noun phrases have a noun as their [[head (linguistics)|head]].&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p299/&gt;

An English noun phrase typically takes the following form (not all elements need be present):
:{| cellspacing=&quot;5&quot;
|- style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps; font-size: larger;&quot;
! Determiner || + || Pre-modifiers || + || NOUN || + || Postmodifiers/Complement
|}

In this structure:
*the ''determiner'' may be an article (''the'', ''a[n]'') or other equivalent word, as described in the following section. In many contexts, it is required for a noun phrase to include some determiner.
*''[[pre-modifier]]s'' include adjectives and some adjective phrases (such as ''red'', ''really lovely''), and [[noun adjunct]]s (such as ''college'' in the phrase ''the college student''). Adjectival modifiers usually come before noun adjuncts.
*a ''[[complement (linguistics)|complement]]'' or ''[[postmodifier]]''&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p299/&gt; may be a prepositional phrase (''... of London''), a [[relative clause]] (like '' ...which we saw yesterday''), certain adjective or [[participial]] phrases (''... sitting on the beach''), or a [[dependent clause]] or [[infinitive phrase]] appropriate to the noun (like ''... that the world is round'' after a noun such as ''fact'' or ''statement'', or ''... to travel widely'' after a noun such as ''desire'').

An example of a noun phrase that includes all of the above-mentioned elements is ''that rather attractive young college student to whom you were talking''. Here ''that'' is the determiner, ''rather attractive'' and ''young'' are adjectival pre-modifiers, ''college'' is a noun adjunct, ''student'' is the noun serving as the head of the phrase, and ''to whom you were talking'' is a post-modifier (a relative clause in this case). Notice the order of the pre-modifiers; the determiner ''that'' must come first and the noun adjunct ''college'' must come after the adjectival modifiers.

Coordinating conjunctions such as ''and'', ''or'', and ''but'' can be used at various levels in noun phrases, as in ''John, Paul, and Mary''; ''the matching green coat and hat''; ''a dangerous but exciting ride''; ''a person sitting down or standing up''. See {{slink||Conjunctions}} below for more explanation.

Noun phrases can also be placed in ''[[apposition]]'' (where two consecutive phrases refer to the same thing), as in ''that president, Abraham Lincoln, ...'' (where ''that president'' and ''Abraham Lincoln'' are in apposition). In some contexts, the same can be expressed by a prepositional phrase, as in ''the twin curses of famine and pestilence'' (meaning &quot;the twin curses&quot; that are &quot;famine and pestilence&quot;).

Particular forms of noun phrases include:
* phrases formed by the determiner ''the'' with an adjective, as in ''the homeless'', ''the English'' (these are [[plural]] phrases referring to homeless people or English people in general);
* phrases with a pronoun rather than a noun as the head (see below);
* phrases consisting just of a [[English possessive|possessive]];
* [[infinitive]] and [[gerund]] phrases, in certain positions;
* certain clauses, such as ''that'' clauses and [[relative clause]]s like ''what he said'', in certain positions.

====Gender====
{{Main|Gender in English}}
A system of grammatical gender, whereby every [[noun]] was treated as either masculine, feminine or neuter, existed in [[Old English]], but fell out of use during the [[Middle English]] period. [[Modern English]] retains features relating to [[natural gender]], namely the use of certain nouns and [[pronoun]]s (such as ''he'' and ''she'') to refer specifically to persons or animals of one or other genders and certain others (such as ''it'') for sexless objects – although feminine pronouns are sometimes used when referring to ships (and more uncommonly some airplanes and analogous machinery) and nation-states.

Some aspects of gender usage in English have been influenced by the movement towards a preference for [[gender-neutral language]]. Animals are triple-gender nouns, being able to take masculine, feminine and neuter pronouns.&lt;ref name=Siemund&gt;{{cite book|last=Siemund|first=Peter|title=Pronominal Gender in English: A Study of English Varieties form a Cross-Linguistic Perspective|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally there is no difference between male and female in English nouns. However, gender is occasionally exposed by different shapes or dissimilar words when referring to people or animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOUN GENDER&quot;&gt;[https://www.ef.com/wwen/english-resources/english-grammar/noun-gender/ NOUN GENDER] ''EF Education First''&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  Masculine !! Feminine !! Gender neutral
|-
|  ''man'' || ''woman'' || ''adult''
|-
|  ''boy'' || ''girl'' || ''child''
|-
|  ''husband'' || ''wife'' || ''spouse''
|-
|  ''actor'' || ''actress'' || ''performer''
|-
|  ''rooster'' || ''hen'' || ''chicken''
|}

Many nouns that mention people's roles and jobs can refer to either a masculine or a feminine subject, for instance &quot;cousin&quot;, &quot;teenager&quot;, &quot;teacher&quot;, &quot;doctor&quot;, &quot;student&quot;, &quot;friend&quot;, and &quot;colleague&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOUN GENDER&quot;/&gt;

*Jane is my friend. She is a dentist.
*Paul is my cousin. He is a dentist.

Often the gender distinction for these neutral nouns is established by inserting the words &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOUN GENDER&quot;/&gt;

*Sam is a female doctor.
*No, he is not my boyfriend; he is just a male friend.
*I have three female cousins and two male cousins.

Rarely, nouns illustrating things with no gender are referred to with a gendered pronoun to convey familiarity. It is also standard to use the gender-neutral pronoun (it).&lt;ref name=&quot;NOUN GENDER&quot;/&gt;

*I love my car. She (the car) is my greatest passion.
*France is popular with her (France's) neighbors at the moment.
*I traveled from England to New York on the ''Queen Elizabeth''; she (Queen Elizabeth) is a great ship.

===Determiners===
{{main|English determiners|English articles}}
English [[determiner (grammar)|determiner]]s constitute a relatively small class of words. They include the [[English articles|articles]] ''the'' and ''a[n]''; certain [[demonstrative adjective|demonstrative]] and [[interrogative]] words such as ''this'', ''that'', and ''which''; [[possessive adjective|possessives]] such as ''my'' and ''whose'' (the role of determiner can also be played by [[English possessive|noun possessive]] forms such as ''John's'' and ''the girl's''); various [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifying words]] like ''all'', ''some'', ''many'', ''various''; and [[numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]s (''one'', ''two'', etc.). There are also many phrases (such as ''a couple of'') that can play the role of determiners.

Determiners are used in the formation of noun phrases (see above). Many words that serve as determiners can also be used as pronouns (''this'', ''that'', ''many'', etc.).

Determiners can be used in certain combinations, such as '''''all the''' water'' and '''''the many''' problems''.

In many contexts, it is required for a noun phrase to be completed with an article or some other determiner. It is not grammatical to say just ''cat sat on table''; one must say ''my cat sat on the table''. The most common situations in which a complete noun phrase can be formed without a determiner are when it refers generally to a whole class or concept (as in ''dogs are dangerous'' and ''beauty is subjective'') and when it is a name (''Jane'', ''Spain'', etc.). This is discussed in more detail at [[English articles]] and [[Zero article in English]].

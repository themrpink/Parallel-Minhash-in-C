===Mythology===
[[File:Garuda image facing Chennakeshava temple at Belur with gopura (entrance tower) in the background.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0 |left|Garuda is found in Vishnu temples; Above: in Belur, India.]]
Garuda's mythology is linked to that of [[Aruṇa|Aruna]] – the charioteer of [[Surya]] (The Hindu Sun god). However, these Indian mythologies are inconsistent across texts. Both Aruna and Garuda developed from an egg. According to one version related by George Williams, Kashyapa Prajapati's two wives Vinata and Kadru wanted to have children, and Kashyapa granted each of them a boon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams2008p62&quot;/&gt; Kadru asked for one thousand [[Nāga]] sons, while Vinata asked for just two, but each an equal to all of Kadru's thousand sons. Kashyapa blessed them, and then retreated to a forest to meditate. Later, Kadru gave birth to one thousand eggs, while Vinata gave birth to two eggs. After incubating them for five hundred years, Kadru's eggs hatched and out came her 1,000 sons. Vinata, eager for her own sons, impatiently broke one of her eggs. From this egg emerged the partially formed Aruna, looking radiant and reddish as the morning sun - but not as bright as the midday sun as he was promised to be.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams2008p62&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=George M. Williams|title=Handbook of Hindu Mythology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N7LOZfwCDpEC |year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-533261-2|pages=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|url=https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= [https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada/page/70 70]|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aruna chided his mother, Vinata for her impatience, and warned her to not break open the second egg, cursing her to be a slave until his brother rescued her. Aruna then left to become the charioteer of Surya, the sun god.

[[File:Garuda Wishnu Bali.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Bali]]nese wooden statue of Vishnu riding Garuda, [[Purna Bhakti Pertiwi Museum]], [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]].]]
Vinata waited, and after many years the second egg hatched, and Garuda was born. After losing a bet to Kadru through trickery, Vinata was forced to become her slave. Garuda later on asked his brothers to free his mother from her slavery, to which they demanded Amrita from heaven. Garuda waged a war against gods with his extraordinary might and abilities beyond thinking, and defeated all of them, including Indra. He then took Indra's nectar vessel and flew back to earth. Vishnu then came to Garuda, and asked him to be his ride, to which he agreed. Indra request that Garuda not give the Amrita to the Nagas though, as it would bring great trouble later, so they forged a plan. Upon reaching his brothers Garuda placed the vessel before them, and asked them to first purify themselves before drinking. Meanwhile, Jayanta (the son of Indra) stole the vessel back. On returning, the nagas were all devoured by Garuda.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams2008p62&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;K2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Ashok, Banker K|title=Forest of Stories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3sQqQQhe5aQC|pages=173–175|accessdate=6 March 2013|year= 2012|publisher= Westland|isbn=978-93-81626-37-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some myths present Garuda as so massive that he can block out the [[sun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Mythical Creatures Bible |author= Brenda Rosen | publisher = Godsfield Press | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-1402765360 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mI0vKhZXJqwC&amp;pg=PA158 | page = 158}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text ''[[Garuda Purana]]'' is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ludo Rocher|title=The Purāṇas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n0-4RJh5FgoC|year=1986|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-02522-5|pages=175–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garuda is presented in the Mahabharata mythology as one who eats snake meat, such as the story about him planning to kill and eat Sumukha snake, where [[Indra]] intervenes. Garuda in anger, vaunt about his feats and compares himself to Indra's equal. Vishnu teaches lesson to Garuda and cured his pride on might.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buitenen1973p167&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Adrianus Bernardus Buitenen|title=The Mahabharata, Volume 3 (Book 4: The Book of the Virata; Book 5: The Book of the Effort) |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wFtXBGNn0aUC&amp;pg=PA167 |year=1973|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-84665-1|pages=167–168, 389–393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garudas are also a race of birds who devour snakes in the epic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buitenen1973p167&quot;/&gt;

The ''[[Suparṇākhyāna]]'', a late [[Vedic period]] poem considered to be among the &quot;earliest traces of epic poetry in India,&quot; relates the legend of Garuda, and provides the basis for a later, expanded version which appears within the ''[[Mahabharata|Mahābhārata]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winternitz1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Moriz Winternitz|title=A History of Indian Literature, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JRfuJFRV_O8C&amp;pg=PA292|year=1996|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0264-3|pages=291–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Vogel1995&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Philippe Vogel|title=Indian Serpent-lore: Or, The Nāgas in Hindu Legend and Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=caskYEbIQDoC&amp;pg=PA53|year=1995|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-1071-2|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism===
Garuda's links to Vishnu – the Hindu god who fights injustice and destroys evil in his various [[avatar]]s to preserve [[dharma]], has made him an iconic symbol of king's duty and power, an insignia of royalty or dharma. His eagle-like form is shown either alone or with Vishnu, signifying divine approval of the power of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams2008p138&quot;/&gt; He is found on the faces of many early Hindu kingdom coins with this symbolism, either as a single-headed bird or a three-headed bird that watches all sides.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bajpai2004p19&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=K. D. Bajpai|title=Indian Numismatic Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=chGrJUMarHoC |date=October 2004|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-035-8|pages=19–24, 84–85, 120–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Mahabharata, Garuda is invoked as a symbol of impetuous violent force, speed, and martial prowess.  Powerful warriors advancing rapidly on doomed foes are likened to Garuda swooping down on a serpent. Defeated warriors are like snakes beaten down by Garuda.  The Mahabharata character [[Drona]] uses a military formation named after Garuda. [[Krishna]] even carries the image of Garuda on his banner.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Buddhism==
[[File:Garuda vanquishing the Naga clan. Gandhara. Met.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Garuda vanquishing the [[nāga|Naga]] clan, a [[Gandhara]] artwork, 2nd century CE.]]
Garuda, also referred to as ''Garula'', are golden-winged birds in Buddhist texts. Under the [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|Buddhist concept]] of ''[[saṃsāra]]'', they are one of the [[Eight Legions|Aṣṭagatyaḥ]], the eight classes of inhuman beings. In Buddhist art, they are shown as sitting and listening to the sermons of the Buddha.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lopez314&quot;/&gt; They are enemies of the [[Nāgas]] (snakes) and are sometimes depicted with a serpent held between their claws. Like the Hindu art, both zoomorphic (giant eagle-like bird) and partially anthropomorphic (part bird, part human) iconography is common across Buddhist traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lopez314&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Garuda (Koh Ker style).jpg|thumbnail|upright|Garuda in [[Koh Ker]] style. Made of sandstone, this statue is from the first half of 10th century, ([[Angkor|Angkor period]]). On display at the [[National Museum of Cambodia]].]]
In [[Buddhist mythology|Buddhism]], the Garuda (Sanskrit; [[Pāli]]: {{IAST|garuḷā}}) are enormous predatory birds with a wingspan of 330 [[yojana]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lopez314&quot;/&gt; They are described as beings with intelligence and social organization. They are also sometimes known as {{IAST|suparṇa}} (Sanskrit; Pāli: {{IAST|supaṇṇa}}), meaning &quot;well-winged, having good wings&quot;.  Like the [[Nāgas]], they combine the characteristics of animals and divine beings, and may be considered to be among the lowest of the [[Deva (Buddhism)|devas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lopez314&quot;/&gt; The Garudas have kings and cities, and at least some of them have the magical power of changing into human form when they wish to have dealings with people. On some occasions Garuda kings have had romances with human women in this form. Their dwellings are in groves of the ''simbalī'', or [[Bombax ceiba|silk-cotton tree]].

Jataka stories describe them to be residents of Nagadipa or Seruma.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lopez314&quot;/&gt;

The Garuda are enemies to the [[Naga (mythology)|nāga]], a race of intelligent serpent- or dragon-like beings, whom they hunt.  The Garudas at one time caught the nāgas by seizing them by their heads; but the nāgas learned that by swallowing large stones, they could make themselves too heavy to be carried by the Garudas, wearing them out and killing them from exhaustion.  This secret was divulged to one of the Garudas by the ascetic Karambiya, who taught him how to seize a nāga by the tail and force him to vomit up his stone (Pandara Jātaka, J.518).

The Garudas were among the beings appointed by [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Śakra]] to guard Mount [[Sumeru]] and the [[Trayastrimsa|{{IAST|Trāyastriṃśa}}]] heaven from the attacks of the [[Asura (Buddhism)|asuras]].

[[File:Garuda_Thap_Mam_13th_c.jpg|thumb|upright|left|13th century [[Art of Champa|Cham]] sculpture depicts Garuda devouring a [[Naga (mythology)|nāga]] serpent.]]
In the Maha-samaya Sutta (Digha Nikaya 20), the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] is shown making temporary peace between the Nagas and the Garudas.

In the [[Qing Dynasty]] fiction ''[[Yue Fei#The Story of Yue Fei|The Story of Yue Fei]]'' (1684), Garuda sits at the head of the Buddha's throne. But when a celestial bat (an embodiment of the [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius constellation]]) flatulates during the Buddha's expounding of the [[Lotus Sutra]], Garuda kills her and is exiled from paradise. He is later reborn as [[Song Dynasty]] General [[Yue Fei]]. The bat is reborn as Lady Wang, wife of the [[Hanjian|traitor]] Prime Minister [[Qin Hui (Song Dynasty)|Qin Hui]], and is instrumental in formulating the &quot;Eastern Window&quot; plot that leads to Yue's eventual political execution.&lt;ref&gt;Hsia, ''C.T. C. T. Hsia on Chinese Literature''. Columbia University Press, 2004 ({{ISBN|0231129904}}), 154&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Story of Yue Fei'' plays on the legendary animosity between Garuda and the Nagas when the celestial bird-born Yue Fei defeats a magic serpent who transforms into the unearthly spear he uses throughout his military career.&lt;ref&gt;Hsia, ''C. T. Hsia on Chinese Literature'', pp. 149&lt;/ref&gt; Literary critic [[C. T. Hsia]] explains the reason why Qian Cai, the book's author, linked Yue with Garuda is because of the homology in their Chinese names. Yue Fei's [[courtesy name]] is Pengju ({{lang|zh|鵬舉}}).&lt;ref name=hsia&gt;Hsia, ''C.T. C. T. Hsia on Chinese Literature'', pp. 149 and 488, n. 30&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Peng (mythology)|Peng]] ({{lang|zh|鵬}}) is a giant mythological bird likened to the Middle Eastern [[Roc (mythology)|Roc]].&lt;ref&gt;Chau, Ju-Kua, Friedrich Hirth, and W.W.

==As a cultural and national symbol==
[[File:Garuda by Ida Made Tlaga 19th c.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Garuda according to Ida Made Tlaga, a 19th-century [[Bali]]nese artist.]]
In [[India]], [[Indonesia]] and the rest of [[Southeast Asia]] the eagle symbolism is represented by Garuda, a large bird with eagle-like features that appears in both Hindu and Buddhist epic as the [[vahana]] (vehicle) of the god [[Vishnu]]. Garuda became the national [[emblem of Thailand]] and [[Garuda Pancasila|Indonesia]]; [[Thailand]]'s Garuda is rendered in a more traditional anthropomorphic style, while that of [[Indonesia]] is rendered in heraldic style with traits similar to the real [[Javan hawk-eagle]].

===India===
[[India]] primarily uses Garuda as a martial motif:

[[Indonesia]] uses the Garuda in a form called the ''[[National emblem of Indonesia|Garuda Pancasila]]'' as its [[Coat of arms of Indonesia|national symbol]]. It is somewhat intertwined with the concept of the [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]]. The Garuda Pancasila is coloured black or [[Gilding|gilded]], symbolizing both the greatness of the nation and the ''elang Jawa'' ([[Javan hawk-eagle]] ''Nisaetus bartelsi''). The black color represents nature. There are 17 feathers on each wing, 8 on the lower tail, 19 on the upper tail and 45 on the neck, which together make up the date 17 August 1945, when [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesia proclaimed its independence]]. The shield it carries bears the [[motto]] ''[[Pancasila (politics)|Panca Sila]]'', which symbolizes self-defense and protection in struggle.&lt;ref name=&quot;embassyofindonesia.org&quot;/&gt;

{{distinguish|Capital (economics)}}
'''Financial capital''' (also simply known as '''capital''' or '''equity''' in [[finance]], [[accounting]] and [[economics]]) is any [[Economic resources|economic resource]] measured in terms of [[money]] used by [[entrepreneur]]s and [[business]]es to buy what they need to make their products or to provide their services to the sector of the economy upon which their operation is based, i.e. retail, corporate, [[investment banking]], etc. In other words, financial capital is internal [[retained earnings]] generated by the entity or funds provided by [[lenders]] (and [[Investor|investors]]) to businesses in order to purchase [[real capital]] equipment or services for producing new [[Goods and services|goods and/or services]].

In contrast, '''[[Capital (economics)|real capital]]''' (or '''economic capital''') comprises physical goods that assist in the production of other goods and services, e.g. shovels for gravediggers, sewing machines for tailors, or machinery and tooling for factories.

== IFRS concepts of capital maintenance ==
''Financial capital'' generally refers to saved-up financial [[Wealth (economics)|wealth]], especially that used in order to start or maintain a business. A financial concept of capital is adopted by most entities in preparing their [[financial reports]]. Under a financial concept of capital, such as ''invested money'' or ''invested purchasing power'', capital is synonymous with the [[net assets]] or [[Net equity|equity]] of the entity. Under a physical concept of capital, such as operating capability, capital is regarded as the [[productive capacity]] of the entity based on, for example, units of output per day.

'''Financial capital maintenance''' can be measured in either nominal monetary units or units of constant purchasing power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Constantitem&quot;&gt;[[Constant item purchasing power accounting#CIPPA as per the IASB's Framework.5B14.5D .5B15.5D]] Constant item purchasing power accounting&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://fixcash.se/admin/file/content105/c9/Framework_07-04nd.pdf] Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements, Par 104&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, there are three concepts of capital maintenance in terms of [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS):&lt;ref name=&quot;Constantitem&quot; /&gt;

# Physical capital maintenance;
# Financial capital maintenance in nominal monetary units; and
# Financial capital maintenance in units of constant purchasing power.

Financial capital is provided by lenders for a price: [[interest]]. Also see [[time value of money]] for a more detailed description of how financial capital may be analyzed. Furthermore, financial capital, is any liquid medium or mechanism that represents [[wealth]], or other styles of [[capital (economics)|capital]]. It is, however, usually purchasing power in the form of money available for the production or purchasing of goods, etcetera. Capital can also be obtained by producing more than what is immediately required and saving the surplus.

Financial capital can also be in the form of purchasable items such as computers or books that can contribute directly or indirectly to obtaining various other types of capital.&lt;ref&gt;Spillane, James P., Tim Hallett, and John B.

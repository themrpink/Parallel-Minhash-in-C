At the end of the first chapter of the X-Men event ''[[X-Men: Endangered Species|Endangered Species]]'', Doom is among the various geniuses that [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] contacts to help him reverse the effects of [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]. He spurns Beast by stating that genetics do not number among his talents. In ''[[Spider-Man: One More Day]]'', Doom was among those that Spider-Man contacts to help save Aunt May.&lt;ref&gt;The Amazing Spider-Man #544&lt;/ref&gt; Doom also makes Latveria into a refugee camp for the [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlanteans]] following the destruction of their underwater kingdom&lt;ref&gt;Sub-Mariner vol. 2, #1-6 (Aug. 2007 â€“ Jan. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as becoming allies with [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] in his plot to manipulate [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|his brother]] into unwittingly release his Asgardian allies.&lt;ref&gt;Thor vol. 3, #5&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctor Doom later defends Latveria from the [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]], following a revelation that it was one of Doom's satellites that carried the 'Venom Virus' released in New York City (which was actually hacked by an enemy of Doom).&lt;ref&gt;''Mighty Avengers'' #8&lt;/ref&gt; In a battle with Iron Man and the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]], the time travel mechanism within his armor overloads, trapping Doctor and his opponents at some point in the past - Doom continues his relationship with [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] using his time machine.&lt;ref&gt;''Mighty Avengers'' #9&lt;/ref&gt; He and Iron Man managed to get back to the present, but Doom has left Iron Man in his exploding castle. Despite his helping, Doom ended up falsely incarcerated at The Raft.

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, Doom was among those who escaped the Raft when a virus was uploaded into its systems by the [[Skrull]]s. In the aftermath of the Secret Invasion, Doctor Doom became a member of the Dark Illuminati alongside [[Norman Osborn]], [[Emma Frost]], [[Namor]], [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]'s female form, and the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]], intending to seek revenge on the world for falsely ruining his reputation. At the end of this meeting, Namor and Doom are seen having a discussion of their own plans that have already been set in motion.&lt;ref&gt;Dark Reign #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Doom soon allies himself with the isolationist group known as the Desturi to take control of [[Wakanda]], attacking and wounding T'Challa, then the current Black Panther, maiming him enough to prevent him from holding the mantle again. Doom's main objective was to secure Wakanda's store of vibranium, which he could mystically enhance to make himself invulnerable. Doom was also a part of the group known as the [[Intelligencia]] after being captured to complete their plan. With the help of [[Bruce Banner]], he escaped and returned to Latveria, damaged by this experience.

At the start of the ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]'' storyline, Doom was with the Cabal discussing the current problems with the X-Men and both Avengers teams. Doom demands that Osborn at once reverse his course of action against his ally Namor, to which Osborn refuses, saying that he and Emma Frost had &quot;crossed the line&quot; with him. Doom, loathing [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardians]] all the more due to his recent defeat at their hands, claims that he will support Osborn's &quot;madness&quot; should Namor be returned to him, but Osborn refuses. Osborn's mysterious ally, the Void, violently attacks Doom, and an apparently amused Loki tells the Hood that he should go, as there is nothing here for either of them, which the Hood, now loyal to Loki due to his hand in the restoration of his mystical abilities, agrees. However, it is revealed that &quot;Doctor Doom&quot; who had been involved with the Cabal was actually an upgraded Doctor Doombot, which releases swarms of Doctor Doombot nanites against the Cabal, tearing down Avengers Tower and forcing its denizens, such as the Dark Avengers, to evacuate. Osborn is rescued by the Sentry, who destroys the body. When Osborn contacts the real Von Doom, Victor informs him not to ever strike him again or he would be willing to go further.&lt;ref name=&quot;Siege: The Cabal&quot;/&gt;

It has been revealed that the Scarlet Witch seen in Wundagore Mountain is actually a Doctor Doombot which apparently means that the real one has been captured by Doom sometime after the House of M event.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; It is revealed that Wanda's enhanced powers were a result of her and Doom's combined attempt to channel the Life Force in order to resurrect her children. This proves to be too much for Wanda to contain and it overtook her. With Wiccan and Doom's help, they seek to use the entity that is possessing Wanda to restore the powers of mutantkinds. This is stopped by the Young Avengers (who are concerned at the fall-out that would ensue if the powerless mutants are suddenly re-powered) only to find out that Doom intended to transfer the entity into his own body and gain Wanda's god-like powers of re-writing reality for himself.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #7&lt;/ref&gt; Doom becomes omnipotent with powers surpassing those of beings as the [[Beyonder]] or the [[Cosmic Cube]]. The Young Avengers confront him, but Doom accidentally kills Cassie just before Wanda and Wiccan stole his new-found powers.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #8&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the story arc &quot;Fantastic Four: Three&quot;, a guilt-ridden Doom felt that he needed to be &quot;reborn&quot; and was making plans to abdicate his throne and give it to Kristoff when Valeria teleported to his room unexpectedly asking for his assistance to help her father. Valeria quickly notices that Doom had suffered brain damage from his previous battle and is slowly losing his memories; she makes a deal with him to restore his mental capacities if he helps Reed and the Fantastic Four. Doom agrees to her proposition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fantastic Four #583&quot;/&gt; Later, Doom appears among those in attendance at Johnny Storm's funeral.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fantastic Four #588&quot;/&gt;

Due to the agreement, Doom was recommended by Nathaniel and Valeria Von Doom to be a member of the [[Future Foundation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FF #1&quot;/&gt; Objecting, Thing attacks Doom out of anger, but the fight was stopped by Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman, who welcomes Victor to their group. When Valeria asks Victor if he has a backup for restoring his memories, he reveals that [[Kristoff Vernard]] is his backup. Afterward, Mister Fantastic, Spider-Man, Nathaniel, Valeria, and Victor head to [[Latveria]] to meet with Kristoff and request his help. Mister Fantastic sets up a brain transfer machine in order to help restore Victor's memories and knowledge, which is successful. When Kristoff wants to return the throne to him, Doom states that it is not time yet because of a promise he made to Valeria. When Mister Fantastic asks what promise Doom made to Valeria, Victor states that he made a promise to help her defeat Mister Fantastic when she calls for it.&lt;ref name=&quot;FF #2&quot;/&gt; Doom decides to hold a symposium on how to finally defeat Reed Richards. The Thing and the evolved Moloids give an invitation to the [[High Evolutionary]]. Dragon Man and Alex Power give an invitation to [[Diablo (Marvel Comics)|Diablo]]. Upon receiving an invitation from Spider-Man, [[Mad Thinker]] is convinced to take part in the event. Bentley 23 even gives an invitation to his creator, the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]], along with two [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] lieutenants. However, it is subsequently revealed that the 'Richards' they have been invited to defeat are actually members of the &quot;Council of Reeds&quot; (alternate versions of Reed who were trapped in this universe by Valeria a while back, possessing Reed's intellect while lacking his conscience).&lt;ref&gt;''FF'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; While Spider-Man and [[Invisible Woman]] make sandwiches for the kids, [[Mister Fantastic]], Victor, Valeria, and Nathaniel Richards meet with the supervillain geniuses and [[Uatu]] the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] about what to do with the Council of Reeds.&lt;ref&gt;''FF'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time, Von Doom performed brain surgery on the Hulk to separate him from Bruce Banner, extracting the uniquely Banner elements from Hulk's brain and cloning a new body for Banner, in return for a favor from the Hulk.&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3, #5&lt;/ref&gt; This clone is killed soon afterward.&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible Hulk'' vol.3 #7&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Doom is apparently killed by the Mad Celestials.&lt;ref&gt;''FF'' #14&lt;/ref&gt; With no knowledge as to how he survived, Doom awakens in the ruins of the Interdimensional Council of Reeds, where Valeria had left him a present: the full army of lobotomized Doctor Dooms from alternate realities who were previously captured by the Council, along with two Infinity Gauntlets from alternate universes. With these resources, Doom created the Parliament of Doom, an interdimensional council charged with maintaining peace across the multiverse.&lt;ref&gt;''FF'' #16&lt;/ref&gt; He later returned to again rule Latveria, upon ruling the council for a millennium.&lt;ref&gt;''Winter Soldier'' #01&lt;/ref&gt; An ill-fated excursion into the alternate universe of the one of Infinity Gauntlets resulted in Reed and Nathaniel Richards rescuing Doom from his own council.&lt;ref&gt;''FF'' #23&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[AXIS (comics)|a confrontation between the Avengers and the X-Men]], Doom allies with [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] and others against [[Red Skull]]'s [[Onslaught (comics)|Red Onslaught]] form.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers &amp; X-Men: AXIS'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to atone for past misdeeds, Doom absorbs the Scarlet Witch reality-altering powers and resurrects the dead [[Cassie Lang]], whom he had accidentally killed.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers World'' #16&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently makes a Faustian deal with an unspecified demon to resurrect [[Brother Voodoo]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers &amp; X-Men: AXIS'' #8&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to normal, Doom is taken into captivity for his initial killing of Lang.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers &amp; X-Men: AXIS'' #9&lt;/ref&gt;

With the final Incursion imminent during the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, Doom usurps the power of the Beyonders with the aid of Doctor Strange and the Molecule Man,&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars (2015)]]&quot;/&gt; collecting what he can of the destroyed multiverse and forming a new Battleworld consisting of different alternate realities. He also assumes the role of God and claims complete dominion of this new world and its inhabitants, controlling them into thinking he was always the almighty force of creation; he takes Sue as his wife, Franklin and Valeria as his children, condemns the Human Torch to be the sun and Ben Grimm to be the Shield wall, and rewrites his own history to resurrect the majority of those whose deaths he caused. Richards and a ragtag collection of heroes and villains that survived the destruction of all universes challenge Doom and, with the help of Molecule Man, are able to take his power and restore the multiverse. Opting to heal rather than harm, Reed finally uses the Beyonder's power to heal Doom's face.&lt;ref name=&quot;Secret Wars #9&quot;/&gt;

In the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'', Doom returns to Latveria where he saves [[Tony Stark]] by incapacitating a group of Latverian rebels with a sonic attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Invincible Iron Man #1&quot;/&gt; Doom reveals to Tony that he is a new man and wishes to help, giving the latter one of the Wands of Watoomb to keep safe from Madame Masque. When more rebels arrive, Doom teleports Iron Man to the Bronx Zoo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Invincible Iron Man #2&quot;/&gt;

Doom finds Iron Man again and teleports the two to the Jackpot Club in Chicago to confront Madam Masque.&lt;ref name=&quot;Invincible Iron Man #4&quot;/&gt; Discovering that Madame Masque is displaying symptoms of demonic possession, Doom has Tony trap her in the Iron Man Armor then proceeds to exorcise the demon from her. Doom disappears before Tony regains consciousness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Invincible Iron Man #5&quot;/&gt; Doom appears once again and interrupts Tony's breakfast date with Amara. Doom is trying to prove to Tony that he has changed and is trying to correct the mistakes he has made, explaining that he has arrived to check up on Tony and see if he is suffering from any side-effects from being in the presence of an exorcism. Tony still refuses to trust him after what he has done and Doom leaves once again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Invincible Iron Man #6&quot;/&gt;

Following the defeat of Tony Stark at the hands of [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]] at the conclusion of ''[[Civil War II]]'', Doom discovers his calling. Remembering his dissatisfaction as a God, Doom decides that it was his role to help heal the world. Inspired by Stark, and informing his A.I. duplicate that he intends to establish Stark's legacy, Doom fights for his unique brand of justice as the third [[Infamous Iron Man|Iron Man]], and later comes into conflict with [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] disguised as [[Ultimate Mister Fantastic|The Maker]], the evil [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]] version of [[Reed Richards]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cbr.com&quot;/&gt; Doom goes on to join the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and later conceives a child with Dr. Amara Perera.&lt;ref name=&quot;Infamous Iron Man #12&quot;/&gt; Doom's sudden change sparked grievances that resulted in a group of villains, led by the Hood, to join forces to take him down.&lt;ref&gt;''Invincible Iron Man'' #594&lt;/ref&gt; After the villains besieged Doom several times, the final battle occurred when the Hood attempted to take over Stark Industries, which happened not long after Stark had secretly recovered from his injuries. Tony confronted the Hood and stumbled into Victor. Doom took on the Hood and the unidentified demon possessing him one-on-one, and his face was severely burned by the demon in the process. Following the villains' defeat, Victor retreated to the ruins of Castle Doom.&lt;ref&gt;''Invincible Iron Man'' #600&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, a young woman named Zora Vokuvic breaks into Castle Doom demanding to see Doctor Doom. She makes it past the many Doombots that guard the palace before finally confronting Doom himself. She tells him that Latveria has been overrun with dictators and opportunists since he left and that the nation needs its leader back. Initially rejecting Zora's pleas for help, showing her his grotesquely scarred face in the process, Victor finally agrees when she refuses to give up and hands him his iconic mask, telling him that Latveria needs its true champion. Taking the mask, Doom ventures out into Latveria, quashing the civil war that is apparently raging and vowing to fix the country with his own strength â€“ summoning magical energy as he does.&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' Vol. 6 #1 (2018). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==


Victor Von Doom is a [[polymath]], scientist, and inventor who possesses [[genius]]-level intellect. Doom has invented several doomsday machines and robots during his career as a supervillain, among them being his Doombots. Doctor Doom can exert technopathic control over certain machines, most notably his Doombots. Throughout most of his publication history, he has been depicted as one of the most intelligent humans in the [[Marvel Universe]], most famously restoring the Thing's human form, a feat Reed Richards has also accomplished but has had difficulty in maintaining over a long period of time. On the other hand, Richards managed to process all the computer calculations necessary to save the life of a disintegrating [[Kitty Pryde]] by himself, which is a feat that Doom at the time professed to be unable to do.&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four Versus X-Men'', #1-4 (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; Doom has also used his scientific talents to steal or replicate the power of other beings such as the [[Silver Surfer]] or in one case the entity [[Galactus]]' world-ship.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Superheroes Secret Wars'' #1-12 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with being a genius scientist and inventor, Doom is also a very powerful sorcerer, primarily taught by Tibetan monks, later increased to a considerable extent due to tutoring from his lover at the time, [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]]. He is capable of energy absorption and projection, manipulating electricity, creating protective shields, dimensional travel, healing, creating blizzards, and summoning hordes of demonic creatures.&lt;ref&gt;''Mighty Avengers'' #9-11&lt;/ref&gt; Doom managed to come in second in a magic tournament held by the ancient sorcerer the Aged Genghis.&lt;ref&gt;Doctor Strange and Doctor Doom: Triumph and Torment&lt;/ref&gt; After Strange relinquished the title of Sorcerer Supreme, he admitted that Doom had enough magical ability that he might become the new Sorcerer Supreme.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' Vol. 1 #51&lt;/ref&gt;

The alien [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics#O|Ovoids]] inadvertently taught Doctor Doom the process of psionically transferring his consciousness into another nearby being through simple eye contact, as well as showing him other forms of technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comiccollectorlive.com/LiveData/Issue.aspx?id=f1d9898a-de86-4635-a252-5459de32e56a |title=Fantastic Four 10 A, Jan 1963 Comic Book by Marvel |publisher=Comiccollectorlive.com |accessdate=2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://i388.photobucket.com/albums/oo326/OneDumbG0/Doctor{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Doom %20Stats/Doctor Doom Powers01-OvoidMindTransfer10.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; which Doom uses to escape from [[incarceration]]s and to avoid being killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comiccollectorlive.com/LiveData/Issue.aspx?id=1aeb4290-639e-428b-bcf7-c2c282f190a7 |title=Fantastic Four 287 A, Feb 1986 Comic Book by Marvel |publisher=Comiccollectorlive.com |accessdate=2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://i388.photobucket.com/albums/oo326/OneDumbG0/Doctor{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Doom %20Stats/Doctor Doom Powers05-OvoidMindTransfer287.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; However, if his concentration is broken, his mind can transfer back, and he rarely uses this power unless absolutely necessary due to his ego about his own appearance.

In addition, Doom has a remarkably strong and indomitable will, as demonstrated in the [[graphic novel]] ''Emperor Doom '' when he dared his prisoner, the mind-controlling [[Purple Man]], to attempt to control him and he successfully resisted. Doom also has the ability to use touchscreen devices even though he wears metal gauntlets all the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=North|first1=Ryan|title=THE UNBEATABLE SQUIRREL GIRL VOL. 3: SQUIRREL, YOU REALLY GOT ME NOW|date=May 10, 2016|publisher=Marvel Publications|isbn=978-0-7851-9626-6|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doom's [[Powered exoskeleton|armor]] augments his natural physical strength and durability to superhuman levels, to the point where he is able to hold his own against and even overpower superhuman foes like [[Spider-Man]], the [[Hulk]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] in combat,&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing Spider-Man #5&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] | Artist = [[Steve Ditko|Ditko, Steve]] | Story=''Marked For Destruction By Doctor Doom'' | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | Volume = | Issue =5 | date = October 1963 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]| Page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although he tends to rely on long-range tactics when engaging physically stronger opponents. It is also nigh-indestructible, being able to take hits from most superhuman adversaries to some cosmic-level beings, and protects Doom from matter manipulation, reality warping and psychic assaults. The armor has an arsenal of [[High tech|high-tech]] weaponry and gadgets integrated within it, including gauntlets that can discharge lasers and force blasts, a defensive [[Force shield|force field]] generator,&lt;ref name=&quot;FF#40&quot;/&gt; and a lethal [[electric shock]] that can stun or kill anyone who comes into contact with Doom.&lt;ref name=&quot;FF#40&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] | Artist =[[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]] | Story =''The Battle of the Baxter Building!'' | title = Fantastic Four | Volume = | Issue =40 | date = July 1964 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]| Page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The armor is self-supporting, equipped with internal stores and [[recycling]] systems for [[Earth's atmosphere|air]], [[food]], [[water]], and [[energy]], allowing Doom to survive lengthy periods of exposure [[underwater]] or in [[outer space]].

Even without his armor, Doom has proven himself to be a skilled [[hand-to-hand combat]]ant, once even killing an endangered lion with a single punch, for no other reason than that he wished to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.killermovies.com/forums/f98/t495216.html|title= Revamped Doctor Doom Respect Thread/VIII. SKILL|publisher=Killer Movies Community Forums|accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Doctor Doom'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

As the absolute monarch of Latveria, Doctor Doom has diplomatic immunity â€“ allowing him to escape prosecution for most of his crimes â€“ and total control of the nation's natural and technological resources, along with its manpower, economy, and military.

Doom is known for the frequent plot device where in it is revealed that his actions were actually those of a &quot;[[Doombot]]&quot;, one of Victor Von Doom's many robot doubles, either working on his behalf or as a result of rogue [[artificial intelligence]]. The plot element of Doombots is often used to retroactively erase events from Doom's history.

===Psychology===
On many occasions, Doom's only real weakness has been his arrogance. [[Layla Miller]] once reflected that Doom is incapable of accepting that he himself might be the reason for his failures. This is most keenly reflected in Doom's continued refusal to accept responsibility for the accident that fully scarred his face, instead preferring to blame Reed Richards for sabotaging his experiment. While his high opinion of himself is generally accurate, he is unable to accept when others may have a better understanding of a situation than he does, with the occasional exception of hearing the recommendations of heroes such as [[Mister Fantastic]] or the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] when it is to his advantage. Even when teaming up with others against a greater threat, Doom will often try to subvert the alliance for personal gain; for instance, while allied with [[Adam Warlock]] and other heroes against the [[Titan (Marvel Comics location)|Titan]] [[Thanos]], he attempted to steal Thanosâ€™ Infinity Gauntlet before its owner had been defeated, potentially disrupting Warlock's own plan to defeat Thanos.

Von Doom adheres to a strict code of honor at all times. However, Von Doom will keep his ''exact'' word, which may or may not be beneficial to the person to whom he has given his promise. For example, Doom may swear that he will not harm an individual, but that only means ''he'' will not personally harm that person; it does not mean he will prevent others from harming that person.

Doom's honor code led him to save Captain America from drowning because Captain America had earlier saved his life, and on another occasion he thanked Spider-Man for saving him from terrorists attacking him in an airport by allowing him to leave alive despite Spider-Man subsequently insulting him. His code of honor also means that he will not attack a respected opponent who is weakened or at a severe disadvantage, as he regards any victory resulting from such circumstances as hollow and meaningless. He has even on several occasions battled opponents who were intent on killing the [[Fantastic Four]], for no other reason than the fact that he does not want the ultimate defeat of the Fantastic Four to come from anyone's hands but his own.

Victor Von Doom has been shown to be devoted to the welfare and well-being of his subjects. Once, he even went so far as to let his soul lay bare and be judged by the Panther God of Wakanda, who determined that he genuinely wished for a utopian future where humanity thrived, albeit one where he was in power.&lt;ref&gt;''Doomwar'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inventions==
Doctor Victor Von Doom's genius in science and technology has allowed him to build numerous devices to defeat his foes or gain more power. The most notable among them include:

* '''[[Doombot]]s''' - Doombots have the face of the real Doctor Doom but with no hood and have guns. They are used for many missions, typically those where he fears defeat, thus functioning as his version of a [[Life Model Decoy]]. The Doombots are programmed to believe themselves to be the real Doctor Doom unless they are in his presence.&lt;ref name=&quot;FF#258&quot;/&gt;
* '''Servo-Guards''' - Robots that are programmed to attack the enemies of Doom.
* '''Time Platform''' - One of Doctor Doom's most ingenious creations is this functioning time machine. It consists of a platform 10 feet (3.0&amp;nbsp;m) by 10 feet (3.0&amp;nbsp;m) by 6 inches (150&amp;nbsp;mm) and a separate control console. Subjects stand upon the platform, while an operator works the controls. The device can transport characters to virtually any time and place in Earth's timestream, and the operator can instantly return the travelers by manipulating the control console. Doctor Doom does not require the console to return to his own timeâ€”he can use the time-circuitry built into his own armor, allowing him to venture into time and return on his own without relying on someone to bring him back.
* A device to imbue people with superpowers.

===House of M===
{{Main|House of M}}
In the [[House of M]] continuity, Doom is still the ruler of Latveria, his mother is still alive, he is married to Valeria, and he has adopted [[Kristoff Vernard|Kristoff]]. Reed Richards's test flight still encounters cosmic radiation, but rather than empowering Reed, Sue and [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]], who went up instead of Johnny Storm, the three of them are killed by the cosmic radiation. Ben Grimm survives, but his intelligence is reduced. This inspires Doom to create the Fearsome Four, consisting of himself, the It(Grimm), the Invincible Woman (Valeria), and the [[Inhuman Torch]] (Kristoff). Due to Doom's arrogance and his brutality towards Grimm, the It betrays the team; Valeria and Kristoff are killed, his mother is kidnapped, and Doom is left broken, but preparing his revenge. He genetically mutates himself to study and advance technologies and mysticism to better himself to be perfect, and transforms his skin into [[liquid metal]] and can form weapons from his hands.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===Mini-Marvels===
Doctor Doom makes shortly cameos in Mini-Marvels. In the &quot;Classic Mini Marvels&quot; section, there's a short story about him in which he tries to read Marvel's comics. He can be seen in &quot;Civil Guards&quot; as one of the doctors that are experimenting with Spider-Man's body. The Avengers also have a photo of Doom in their house, as shown in &quot;World War Hulk&quot;.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===MC2===
{{Main|Fantastic Five}}
In the [[Fantastic Five]] series, Doom is revealed to be held captive by the [[Sub-Mariner]] for ten years, after the destruction of Atlantis. Doom manages to escape, and uses the same device he once employed to imbue [[Terrax]] with the [[Power Cosmic]] on his Doombots- unable to use it on himself as his human body would be destroyed from the strain-, and attempts to take over the world. Taking advantage of Doom's desire to prove himself superior, Reed Richards challenges Doom to a psychic duel, using a device that will send the loser's mind to the Crossroads of Infinity. The two are so evenly matched that both are sent to the Crossroads - although Namor notes that it is possible that Reed sacrificed himself to try to save Doom - leaving their bodies as empty shells, although Reed's teammates note that there is always a possibility that the two shall return so long as their bodies remain alive.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===Iron Man===
In an alternative future set in 2093, where a reborn [[King Arthur]] rules a renewed Camelot aided by Merlin, Doom and Iron Man are drawn to the future to oppose a plan to destroy most of Earth's population. While Iron Man confronts his descendant- wielding [[Excalibur]] in order to even the odds against his foe's upgraded armor- Doom meets his future double, who relies on technology to extend his lifespan and has allied with the future Iron Man in order to use his mobility to complete his plan. Doom rejects his future self by pointing out that he would never do such a thing, for even if he seeks power, he always watches the cost of it, and knows that nothing he seeks could be worth such an affront to his dignity. He then kills the older Doom.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Iron Man]]'' #250&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Marvel Zombies vs. The Army Of Darkness|Marvel Zombies}}

In more of an anti-hero role, the Earth-2149 version of Doom is still ruler of Latveria. Doom has fortified his castle to defend against the infected superheroes and refuses help from [[Nick Fury]], and takes in refugees for the purpose of repopulating the planet once the situation is resolved. To the disgust of his allies, it is revealed Doom has only chosen the hardiest breeding stock of the Latverian survivors; there are no elderly people or children.&lt;ref name=&quot;mzvtaod4&quot;&gt;[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]] #4&lt;/ref&gt; He creates a makeshift portal that will allow escape into other dimensions, should the zombie plague doom the planet. Doom is forced to vaporize the mutant [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]] and the zombified [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] after the latter infects the former, but is then attacked by the zombified Marvel superheroes and infected by Reed Richards, who had infected himself and his teammates on purpose.&lt;ref name=&quot;mzvtaod5&quot;&gt;[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]] #5&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before he turns, a &quot;dying&quot; Doom heroically uses his portal to allow the refugees escape to another reality. Despite his defenses, the zombies breaks through once more. With only himself and [[Ash Williams]] remaining, he reveals he has been infected by the virus, and cannot go through the portal himself. Though tempted to eat Ash, he resists, as he considers Ash to have allowed him revenge against Reed Richards, allowing the man to escape, even giving him the ability to choose one of many realities. As Ash escapes through it, Doom ultimately destroys the device, trapping himself with the zombies. Having witnessed Doom saving the refugees by using his portal for their escape, the zombified [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] suddenly attacked Doom.&lt;ref name=&quot;mzvtaod5&quot; /&gt; He is later seen in New York, as a zombie who attempts to devour [[Galactus]] before engaging in battle with the zombified superheroes who succeeded in absorbing Galactus' cosmic powers before him, presumably being killed by them off-screen.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Zombies'' #1 - 5 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

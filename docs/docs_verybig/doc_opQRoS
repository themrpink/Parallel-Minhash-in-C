Civil engineering structures are often subjected to very extreme forces, such as large variations in temperature, dynamic loads such as waves or traffic, or high pressures from water or compressed gases. They are also often constructed in corrosive environments, such as at sea, in industrial facilities, or below ground.

===Mechanical structures===
The principles of structural engineering apply to a variety of mechanical (moveable) structures. The design of static structures assumes they always have the same geometry (in fact, so-called static structures can move significantly, and structural engineering design must take this into account where necessary), but the design of moveable or moving structures must account for [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]], variation in the method in which load is resisted and significant deflections of structures.

The forces which parts of a machine are subjected to can vary significantly and can do so at a great rate. The forces which a boat or aircraft are subjected to vary enormously and will do so thousands of times over the structure's lifetime. The structural design must ensure that such structures can endure such loading for their entire design life without failing.

These works can require mechanical structural engineering:
* [[Pressure vessel|Boilers and pressure vessels]]
* [[Coachwork|Coachworks and carriages]]
* [[Crane (machine)|Cranes]]
* [[Elevator]]s
* [[Escalator]]s
* [[Boat building|Marine vessels and hulls]]

===Aerospace structures===

[[File:Patriot missile launch b.jpg|thumb|left| Design of missile needs in depth understanding of [[Structural Analysis]]]]

Aerospace structure types include launch vehicles, ([[Atlas]], [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta]], Titan), [[missiles]] (ALCM, Harpoon), [[Hypersonic]] vehicles (Space Shuttle), [[military aircraft]] (F-16, F-18) and commercial aircraft ([[Boeing]] 777, MD-11). Aerospace structures typically consist of thin plates with stiffeners for the external surfaces, bulkheads, and frames to support the shape and fasteners such as welds, rivets, screws, and bolts to hold the components together.

===Nanoscale structures===
A [[nanostructure]] is an object of intermediate size between molecular and microscopic (micrometer-sized) structures. In describing nanostructures it is necessary to differentiate between the number of dimensions on the nanoscale. Nanotextured surfaces have one dimension on the nanoscale, i.e., only the thickness of the surface of an object is between 0.1 and 100&amp;nbsp;nm. [[Nanotube]]s have two dimensions on the nanoscale, i.e., the diameter of the tube is between 0.1 and 100&amp;nbsp;nm; its length could be much greater. Finally, spherical [[nanoparticles]] have three dimensions on the nanoscale, i.e., the particle is between 0.1 and 100&amp;nbsp;nm in each spatial dimension. The terms nanoparticles and ultrafine particles (UFP) often are used synonymously although UFP can reach into the micrometer range. The term 'nanostructure' is often used when referring to magnetic technology.

=== Structural engineering for medical science ===
[[File:Marcelletti SO2.jpg|thumb|right| Designing medical equipment needs in-depth understanding of structural engineering]]
Medical equipment (also known as armamentarium) is designed to aid in the diagnosis, monitoring or treatment of medical conditions. There are several basic types: [[diagnostic]] equipment includes medical imaging machines, used to aid in diagnosis; equipment includes infusion pumps, medical lasers, and [[LASIK surgical machines]]; medical monitors allow medical staff to measure a patient's medical state. Monitors may measure patient vital signs and other parameters including [[ECG]], [[EEG]], blood pressure, and dissolved gases in the blood; diagnostic medical equipment may also be used in the home for certain purposes, e.g. for the control of diabetes mellitus. A [[biomedical equipment technician]] (BMET) is a vital component of the healthcare delivery system. Employed primarily by hospitals, BMETs are the people responsible for maintaining a facility's medical equipment.

==Structural elements==
{{main article|Space frame}}
[[Image:Bending.svg|thumb|right|A [[statically determinate]] simply supported beam, bending under an evenly distributed load.]]
Any structure is essentially made up of only a small number of different types of elements:
* [[Columns]]
* [[Beam (structure)|Beams]]
* [[Plate (structure)|Plates]]
* [[Arch]]es
* [[Thin-shell structure|Shells]]
* [[Catenaries]]

Many of these elements can be classified according to form (straight, plane / curve) and dimensionality (one-dimensional / two-dimensional):

|}

===Columns===

{{Main article|Column}}

Columns are elements that carry only axial force (compression) or both axial force and bending (which is technically called a beam-column but practically, just a column). The design of a column must check the axial capacity of the element and the buckling capacity.

The buckling capacity is the capacity of the element to withstand the propensity to buckle. Its capacity depends upon its geometry, material, and the effective length of the column, which depends upon the restraint conditions at the top and bottom of the column. The effective length is &lt;math&gt;K*l&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is the real length of the column and K is the factor dependent on the restraint conditions.

The capacity of a column to carry axial load depends on the degree of bending it is subjected to, and vice versa. This is represented on an interaction chart and is a complex non-linear relationship.

===Beams===
{{Main article|Beam (structure)|l1=Beam}}
[[Image:The Little Belt Bridge (1935).jpeg|thumb|[[Little Belt Bridge|''Little Belt'']]: a [[truss bridge]] in [[Denmark]]]]
A beam may be defined as an element in which one dimension is much greater than the other two and the applied loads are usually normal to the main axis of the element. Beams and columns are called line elements and are often represented by simple lines in structural modeling.
* [[cantilever]]ed (supported at one end only with a fixed connection)
* simply supported (fixed against vertical translation at each end and horizontal translation at one end only,  and able to rotate at the supports)
* fixed (supported in all directions for translation and rotation at each end)
* continuous (supported by three or more supports)
* a combination of the above (ex. supported at one end and in the middle)

Beams are elements that carry pure bending only. Bending causes one part of the section of a beam (divided along its length) to go into compression and the other part into tension. The compression part must be designed to resist buckling and crushing, while the tension part must be able to adequately resist the tension.

===Trusses===
{{Main article|Truss}}
[[Image:McDonnell-Planetarium.jpg|thumb|The McDonnell Planetarium by [[Gyo Obata]] in [[St Louis, Missouri]], USA, a concrete shell structure]]
[[Image:gateway arch.jpg|thumb|right|The 630 foot (192 m) high, stainless-clad (type 304) [[Jefferson National Expansion Memorial#The Gateway Arch|Gateway Arch]] in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]]]]

A [[truss]] is a structure comprising members and connection points or nodes. When members are connected at nodes and forces are applied at nodes members can act in tension or compression. Members acting in compression are referred to as compression members or [[strut]]s while members acting in tension are referred to as tension members or [[Tie (engineering)|ties]]. Most trusses use [[gusset plates]] to connect intersecting elements.  Gusset plates are relatively flexible and unable to transfer [[bending moment]]s. The connection is usually arranged so that the lines of force in the members are coincident at the joint thus allowing the truss members to act in pure tension or compression.

Trusses are usually used in large-span structures, where it would be uneconomical to use solid beams.

===Plates===
{{Main|Plate (structure)}}

Plates carry bending in two directions. A concrete flat slab is an example of a plate. Plates are understood by using [[continuum mechanics]], but due to the complexity involved they are most often designed using a codified empirical approach, or computer analysis.

They can also be designed with yield line theory, where an assumed collapse mechanism is analyzed to give an upper bound on the collapse load. This technique is used in practice &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ramsay-maunder.co.uk/downloads/precast_roof_slabs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; but because the method provides an upper-bound, i.e. an unsafe prediction of the collapse load, for poorly conceived collapse mechanisms great care is needed to ensure that the assumed collapse mechanism is realistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ramsay-maunder.co.uk/downloads/l_shaped_landing.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-30 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071038/http://www.ramsay-maunder.co.uk/downloads/l_shaped_landing.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shells===

{{Main article|Thin-shell structure}}
{{See also|Gridshell}}

Shells derive their strength from their form and carry forces in compression in two directions. A dome is an example of a shell. They can be designed by making a hanging-chain model, which will act as a catenary in pure tension and inverting the form to achieve pure compression.

===Arches===
{{Main article|Arch}}

Arches carry forces in compression in one direction only, which is why it is appropriate to build arches out of masonry. They are designed by ensuring that the [[line of thrust]] of the force remains within the depth of the arch. It is mainly used to increase the bountifulness of any structure.

===Catenaries===
{{Main article|Tensile structure}}
Catenaries derive their strength from their form and carry transverse forces in pure tension by deflecting (just as a tightrope will sag when someone walks on it). They are almost always cable or fabric structures. A fabric structure acts as a catenary in two directions.
&lt;!--
===Seismic base isolators===
{{main|Vibration control}}

[[Base isolation]] is a collection of structural elements of a building that should substantially [[decouple]] the building's [[superstructure]] from the shaking ground thus protecting the building's integrity and improving its [[seismic performance]]; see, e.g., the shake table testing of a kind of ''' seismic base isolators''' called [[Earthquake Protector]]s. This technology, which is a kind of seismic [[vibration control]], can be applied both to newly designed buildings and to seismic upgrading of existing structures. Normally, excavations are made around the building which is separated from its foundation. Steel or reinforced concrete beams replace the connections to the foundation, while under these, the isolating pads, or '''seismic base isolators''', replace the material removed. While the [[base isolation]] tends to restrict the transmission of the ground motion to the building, it also keeps the building positioned properly over the foundation.
--&gt;

==Materials==
{{Main article|Structural material}}
Structural engineering depends on the knowledge of materials and their properties, in order to understand how different materials support and resist loads.

Common structural materials are:
* [[Iron]]: [[wrought iron]], [[cast iron]]
* [[Concrete]]: [[reinforced concrete]], [[prestressed concrete]]
* [[Alloy]]: [[steel]], [[stainless steel]]
* [[Masonry]]
* [[Timber]]: [[hardwood]], [[softwood]]
* [[Aluminium]]
* [[Composite material]]s: [[plywood]]
* Other structural materials: [[adobe]], [[bamboo]], [[carbon fibre]], [[fiber reinforced plastic]], [[mudbrick]], [[roofing material]]s

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Tetanus''', also known as '''lockjaw''', is a [[bacterial infection]] characterized by [[muscle spasm]]s.&lt;ref name=CDC2012Pink/&gt; In the most common type, the spasms begin in the jaw and then progress to the rest of the body.&lt;ref name=CDC2012Pink/&gt; Each spasm usually lasts a few minutes.&lt;ref name=CDC2012Pink/&gt; Spasms occur frequently for three to four weeks.&lt;ref name=CDC2012Pink/&gt; Some spasms may be severe enough to [[bone fracture|fracture bones]].&lt;ref name=CDC2013S/&gt; Other symptoms of tetanus may include [[fever]], [[sweating]], [[headache]], [[dysphagia|trouble swallowing]], [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], and a [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]].&lt;ref name=CDC2012Pink/&gt;&lt;ref name=CDC2013S&gt;{{cite web|title=Tetanus Symptoms and Complications|url=https://www.cdc.gov/tetanus/about/symptoms-complications.html|website=cdc.gov|access-date=12 February 2015|date=January 9, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212225108/http://www.cdc.gov/tetanus/about/symptoms-complications.html|archive-date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Onset of symptoms is typically three to twenty-one days following infection.&lt;ref name=CDC2012Pink/&gt; Recovery may take months.&lt;ref name=CDC2012Pink/&gt; About ten percent of cases prove [[death|fatal]].&lt;ref name=CDC2012Pink&gt;{{cite book|last1=Atkinson|first1=William|title=Tetanus Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases|date=May 2012|publisher=Public Health Foundation|isbn=9780983263135|pages=291–300|edition=12|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/tetanus.html|access-date=12 February 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213010501/http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/tetanus.html|archive-date=February 13, 2015}}  {{CDC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Tetanus is caused by an infection with the [[bacterium]] ''[[Clostridium tetani]]'',&lt;ref name=CDC2012Pink/&gt; which is commonly found in soil, saliva, dust, and manure.&lt;ref name=CDC2013C&gt;{{cite web|title=Tetanus Causes and Transmission|url=https://www.cdc.gov/tetanus/about/causes-transmission.html|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=12 February 2015|date=January 9, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212223308/http://www.cdc.gov/tetanus/about/causes-transmission.html|archive-date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bacteria generally enter through a break in the skin such as a cut or puncture wound by a contaminated object.&lt;ref name=CDC2013C/&gt; They produce [[toxin]]s that interfere with normal muscle contractions.&lt;ref name=CDC2013Doc&gt;{{cite web|title=Tetanus For Clinicians|url=https://www.cdc.gov/tetanus/clinicians.html|website=cdc.gov|access-date=12 February 2015|date=January 9, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212224705/http://www.cdc.gov/tetanus/clinicians.html|archive-date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnosis is based on the presenting signs and symptoms.&lt;ref name=CDC2012Pink/&gt; The disease does not spread between people.&lt;ref name=CDC2012Pink/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention, treatment and prognosis --&gt;
Tetanus can be prevented by [[immunization]] with the [[tetanus vaccine]].&lt;ref name=CDC2012Pink/&gt; In those who have a significant wound and have had fewer than three doses of the vaccine, both vaccination and [[tetanus immune globulin]] are recommended.&lt;ref name=CDC2012Pink/&gt; The wound should be cleaned and any dead tissue should be removed.&lt;ref name=CDC2012Pink/&gt; In those who are infected, tetanus immune globulin or, if unavailable, [[intravenous immunoglobulin]] (IVIG) is used.&lt;ref name=CDC2012Pink/&gt; [[Muscle relaxant]]s may be used to control spasms.&lt;ref name=CDC2013Doc/&gt; [[Mechanical ventilation]] may be required if a person's breathing is affected.&lt;ref name=CDC2013Doc/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and history --&gt;
Tetanus occurs in all parts of the world but is most frequent in hot and wet climates where the soil has a high organic content.&lt;ref name=CDC2012Pink/&gt; In 2015 there were about 209,000 infections and about 59,000 deaths globally.&lt;ref name=GBD2015Pre&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vos T, Allen C, Arora M, Barber RM, Bhutta ZA, Brown A, etal | collaboration = GBD 2015 Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators | title = Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 310 diseases and injuries, 1990-2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 | journal = Lancet | volume = 388 | issue = 10053 | pages = 1545–1602 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27733282 | pmc = 5055577 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31678-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GBD2015De&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang H, Naghavi M, Allen C, Barber RM, Bhutta ZA, Carter A, etal | collaboration = GBD 2015 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators | title = Global, regional, and national life expectancy, all-cause mortality, and cause-specific mortality for 249 causes of death, 1980-2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 | journal = Lancet | volume = 388 | issue = 10053 | pages = 1459–1544 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27733281 | pmc = 5388903 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31012-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is down from 356,000 deaths in 1990.&lt;ref name=GBD2014&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Naghavi M, Wang H, Lozano R, Davis A, Liang X, Zhou M, etal | collaboration = GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators | title = Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 | journal = Lancet | volume = 385 | issue = 9963 | pages = 117–71 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25530442 | pmc = 4340604 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US there are about 30 cases per year, almost all of which have not been vaccinated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Tetanus |url=https://www.cdc.gov/tetanus/about/index.html |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |publisher=United States Government |access-date=4 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An early description of the disease was made by [[Hippocrates]] in the 5th century BC.&lt;ref name=CDC2012Pink/&gt; The cause of the disease was determined in 1884 by Antonio Carle and Giorgio Rattone at the [[University of Turin]], and a vaccine was developed in 1924.&lt;ref name=CDC2012Pink/&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==

Tetanus often begins with mild spasms in the [[masseter|jaw muscles]]—also known as lockjaw or [[trismus]]. The spasms can also affect the facial muscles resulting in an appearance called ''[[risus sardonicus]]''. Chest, neck, back, abdominal muscles, and buttocks may be affected. Back muscle spasms often cause arching, called [[opisthotonos]]. Sometimes the spasms affect muscles that help with breathing, which can lead to breathing problems.&lt;ref name=CDC2020Pink&gt;{{cite web | title=Tetanus - Epidemiology of Vaccine Preventable Diseases | website=CDC | date=2020-05-10 | url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/tetanus.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200510154018/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/tetanus.html | archive-date=2020-05-10 | url-status=live | access-date=2020-05-18|quote=Laryngospasm (spasm of the vocal cords) and/or spasm of the muscles of respiration leads to interference with breathing.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prolonged muscular action causes sudden, powerful, and painful contractions of muscle groups, which is called &quot;tetany&quot;. These episodes can cause fractures and muscle tears. Other symptoms include [[fever]], [[headache]], restlessness, [[irritability]], feeding difficulties, [[respiratory failure|breathing problems]], [[dysuria|burning sensation during urination]], [[urinary retention]] and [[Fecal incontinence|loss of stool control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Schleiss|first=Mark R.|title=Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics|editor=Kliegman, Robert |publisher=Elsevier |year=2020|isbn=978-0-323-52950-1 |pages=6253|chapter=Chapter 238: Tetanus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with treatment, about 10% of people who contract tetanus die.&lt;ref name=CDC2012Pink/&gt; The [[mortality rate]] is higher in unvaccinated people and people over 60 years of age.&lt;ref name=CDC2012Pink/&gt;

=== Incubation period ===
The [[incubation period]] of tetanus may be up to several months, but is usually about ten days.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12850356&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vandelaer J, Birmingham M, Gasse F, Kurian M, Shaw C, Garnier S | title = Tetanus in developing countries: an update on the Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus Elimination Initiative | journal = Vaccine | volume = 21 | issue = 24 | pages = 3442–5 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12850356 | doi = 10.1016/S0264-410X(03)00347-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12122532&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brauner JS, Vieira SR, Bleck TP | title = Changes in severe accidental tetanus mortality in the ICU during two decades in Brazil | journal = Intensive Care Med | volume = 28 | issue = 7 | pages = 930–5 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12122532 | doi = 10.1007/s00134-002-1332-4 | url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5586a2c9be183b4364b935b8ef958d7512eeacfb }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the farther the injury site is from the [[central nervous system]], the longer the incubation period.

'''Sir Henry Morton Stanley''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|GCB}} (born '''John Rowlands'''; 28 January 1841 –  10 May 1904) was a [[Welsh Americans|Welsh-American]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/stanley_sir_henry_morton.shtml|title=Henry Stanley (1841 – 1904) | accessdate=21 October 2016 | publisher=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-Morton-Stanley | title=Sir Henry Morton Stanley | accessdate=21 October 2016 | publisher=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; journalist, explorer, soldier, colonial administrator, author and politician who was famous for his exploration of central Africa and his search for missionary and explorer [[David Livingstone]], whom he later claimed to have greeted with the now-famous line: &quot;Dr Livingstone, I presume?&quot;. He is mainly known for his search for the source of the [[Nile]], work he undertook as an agent of [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II of Belgium]], which enabled the occupation of the [[Congo (area)|Congo Basin region]], and for his command of the [[Emin Pasha Relief Expedition]]. He was [[knight]]ed in 1899.

==Early life==
[[File:Portrait of Discoverer of Livingstone (4671166).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of a young Henry Morton Stanley c.1870s]]
Henry Stanley was born in 1841 as '''John Rowlands''' in [[Denbigh]], [[Denbighshire]], Wales. His mother Elizabeth Parry was 18 years old at the time of his birth. She abandoned him as a very young baby and cut off all communication. Stanley never knew his father, who died within a few weeks of his birth.{{sfn|Stanley|1909| p=4 }} There is some doubt as to his true parentage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies1959&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Stanley, (Sir) Henry Morton (alias Rowlands, John) (1841–1904), explorer, administrator, and author | last = Davies | first = William Llewelyn | publisher= The National Library of Wales| work = Dictionary of Welsh Biography | date = 1959 | accessdate = 2018-07-09 | url = http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s-STAN-MOR-1841.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As his parents were unmarried, his [[birth certificate]] describes him as a [[bastard (Law of England and Wales)|bastard]]; he was baptised in the parish of Denbigh on 19 February 1841, the register recording that he had been born on 28 January of that year. The entry states that he was the bastard son of John Rowland of Llys Llanrhaidr and Elizabeth Parry of Castle. The [[Social stigma|stigma]] of [[illegitimacy]] weighed heavily upon him all his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;jeal2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mCSQCjEuU94C | first=Tim | last=Jeal | authorlink=Tim Jeal | title=Stanley: The Impossible Life of Africa's Greatest Explorer | publisher=Yale University Press | year=2007 | isbn=978-0300126259}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17–19, 356}}

The boy John was given his father's surname of Rowlands and brought up by his maternal grandfather Moses Parry, a once-prosperous butcher who was living in reduced circumstances. He cared for the boy until he died, when John was five. Rowlands stayed with families of cousins and nieces for a short time, but he was eventually sent to the St. Asaph Union [[Workhouse]] for the Poor. The overcrowding and lack of supervision resulted in his being frequently abused by older boys. Historian Robert Aldrich has alleged that the headmaster of the workhouse raped or sexually assaulted Rowlands, and that the older Rowlands was &quot;incontrovertibly bisexual.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Aldrich2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Aldrich|first=Robert |title=Colonialism and Homosexuality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tq9UTX5O2CIC&amp;pg=PA136|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-64459-9|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Rowlands was ten, his mother and two half-siblings stayed for a short while in this workhouse, but he did not recognize them until the headmaster told him who they were.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jeal2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BrYXdH_WXXgC | title=Explorers of the Nile: The Triumph and Tragedy of a Great Victorian Adventure | last=Jeal | first=Tim | year=2011 | publisher=Yale University Press | isbn=9780300149357 | page=258|authorlink=Tim Jeal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New country, new name==
Rowlands emigrated to the United States in 1859 at age 18. He disembarked at [[New Orleans]] and, according to his own declarations, became friends by accident with Henry Hope Stanley, a wealthy trader. He saw Stanley sitting on a chair outside his store and asked him if he had any job openings. He did so in the British style: &quot;Do you need a boy, sir?&quot; The childless man had indeed been wishing he had a son, and the inquiry led to a job and a close relationship between them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Severin1974&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | title = The Making of an American Lion  | last = Severin | first = Timothy | journal= American Heritage | date = February 1974  |volume=25|issue=2 | accessdate = 2018-07-09 | url = http://www.americanheritage.com/content/making-american-lion?page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of admiration, John took Stanley's name. Later, he wrote that his adoptive parent died two years after their meeting, but in fact the elder Stanley did not die until 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wI8FGYHGs-QC | title=The Troubled Heart of Africa: A History of the Congo | last=Edgerton | first=Robert | year=2002 | publisher=Macmillan | isbn=0-312-30486-2 | page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; This and other discrepancies led John Bierman to argue that no adoption took place.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bierman1993&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bierman|first=John |title=Dark Safari: The Life Behind the Legend of Henry Morton Stanley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DM1AAAAACAAJ|year=1993|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-70802-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27–28}} Tim Jeal goes further, and, in Chapter Two of his biography, subjects Stanley's account in his posthumously published ''Autobiography'' to detailed analysis. Because Stanley got so many basic facts wrong about his 'adoptive' family, Jeal concludes that it is very unlikely that he ever met rich Henry Hope Stanley, and that an ordinary grocer, James Speake, was Rowlands' true benefactor until his (Speake's) sudden death in October 1859.&lt;ref name=&quot;jeal2007&quot; /&gt;{{rp|31-41, esp. 34-41}}

He became a record keeper on board the {{USS|Minnesota|1855|6}}, which led him into freelance journalism. Stanley and a junior colleague jumped ship on 10 February 1865 in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], in search of greater adventures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallop2004&quot;/&gt;{{rp|63–65}} Stanley was possibly the only man to serve in all three of the Confederate Army, the Union Army, and the Union Navy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown1986&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Dee Alexander |title=The Galvanized Yankees|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HsrhBfiB0RsC&amp;pg=PA58|year=1986|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=0-8032-6075-X|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journalist==
[[File:Stanley Persepolis graffiti.JPG|thumb|right|Stanley's graffito at [[Persepolis]], [[Iran]]]]

Following the Civil War, Stanley became a journalist in the days of frontier expansion in the American West. He then organised an expedition to the [[Ottoman Empire]] that ended catastrophically when he was imprisoned. He eventually talked his way out of jail and received restitution for damaged expedition equipment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallop2004&quot;/&gt;{{rp|71–73}}

In 1867, the [[emperor of Ethiopia]], [[Tewodros II]], held a British envoy and others hostage, and a force was sent to achieve the release of the hostages. Stanley accompanied that force as a special correspondent of the ''[[New York Herald]]''. Stanley's report on the [[Battle of Magdala]] in 1868 was the first to be published. Subsequently, he was assigned to report on Spain's [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|Glorious Revolution]] in 1868.

==Finding David Livingstone==
[[File:Rencontre de Livingstone - How I found Livingstone (fr).png|thumb|left|''&quot;Dr. Livingstone, I presume?&quot;'', an illustration from Stanley's 1872 book ''How I Found Livingstone'']]

Stanley travelled to [[Zanzibar]] in March 1871, later claiming that he outfitted an expedition with 192 [[Porter (carrier)|porters]].{{sfn|Stanley|1872|p=68}} In his first dispatch to the ''New York Herald'', however, he stated that his expedition numbered only 111. This was in line with figures in his diaries.{{sfn|Stanley|1970|p=13}} [[James Gordon Bennett Jr.]], publisher of the ''[[New York Herald]]'' and funder of the expedition, had delayed sending to Stanley the money he had promised, so Stanley borrowed money from the United States [[Consul (representative)|Consul]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jeal2007&quot; /&gt;{{rp|93–94}}

During the {{convert|700|mi|adj=on}} expedition through the tropical forest, his thoroughbred stallion died within a few days after a bite from a [[tsetse fly]], many of his porters deserted, and the rest were decimated by tropical diseases.

[[File:Henry Morton Stanley, 1872.jpg|thumb|upright|1872 [[Carte de visite]] – Stanley and [[Kalulu]].]]

Stanley found [[David Livingstone]] on 10 November 1871 in [[Ujiji]], near [[Lake Tanganyika]] in present-day [[Tanzania]]. He later claimed to have greeted him with the now-famous line, &quot;Doctor Livingstone, I presume?&quot; However, this line does not appear in his journal from the time—the two pages directly following the recording of his initial spotting of Livingstone were torn out of the journal at some point—and it is likely that Stanley simply embellished the pithy line sometime afterwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Thorpe|first1=Vanessa|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/feb/04/books.booksnews|title=The fibbing Mr Stanley, we presume|date=2007-02-04|work=The Observer|access-date=2020-02-21|last2=arts|language=en-GB|issn=0029-7712|last3=correspondent|first3=media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither man mentioned it in any of the letters they wrote at this time,&lt;ref name=&quot;jeal2007&quot;/&gt; and Livingstone tended to instead recount the reaction of Stanley's servant, Susi, who cried out: &quot;An Englishman coming! I see him!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The phrase is first quoted in a summary of Stanley's letters published by ''[[The New York Times]]'' on 2 July 1872.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes1872&quot;&gt;{{Cite newspaper | title = The Search for Livingston | last = Stanley | first = Henry Morton | newspaper= The New York Times | date = 2 July 1872 | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1872/07/02/79181684.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley biographer [[Tim Jeal]] argued that the explorer invented it afterwards to help raise his standing because of &quot;insecurity about his background&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;jeal2007&quot;/&gt;{{rp|117}}

The ''Herald''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s own first account of the meeting, published 1 July 1872, reports:&lt;ref&gt;NY Herald 1 July 1872&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Preserving a calmness of exterior before the Arabs which was hard to simulate as he reached the group, Mr. Stanley said: – &quot;Doctor Livingstone, I presume?&quot; A smile lit up the features of the pale white man as he answered: &quot;Yes, and I feel thankful that I am here to welcome you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=David Livingstone letter deciphered at last.

Stanley joined Livingstone in exploring the region, finding that there was no connection between Lake Tanganyika and the Nile. On his return, he wrote a book about his experiences: ''How I Found Livingstone; travels, adventures, and discoveries in Central Africa''.{{sfn|Stanley | 1872|p=}}

== African Great Lakes and Congo River ==

In 1874, the ''[[New York Herald]]'' and the ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]'' financed Stanley on another expedition to Africa.  His ambitious objective was to complete the exploration and mapping of the Central [[African Great Lakes]] and rivers, in the process circumnavigating Lakes [[Lake Victoria|Victoria]] and [[Lake Tanganyika|Tanganyika]] and locating the source of the [[Nile]].  Between 1875 and 1876 Stanley succeeded in the first part of his objective, establishing that Lake Victoria had only a single outlet – the one discovered by [[John Hanning Speke]] on 21 July 1862 and named [[Ripon Falls]]. If this was not the Nile's source, then the separate massive northward flowing river called by [[David Livingstone|Livingstone]], the [[Lualaba River|Lualaba]], and mapped by him in its upper reaches, might flow on north to connect with the Nile via [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]] and thus be the primary source.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jeal2011&quot; /&gt;{{rp|301}}

It was therefore essential that Stanley should trace the course of the Lualaba downstream (northward) from [[Nyangwe]], the point where Livingstone had left it in July 1871.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livingstone1874&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Livingstone|first=David |authorlink=David Livingstone|editor=Horace Waller|title=The Last Journals of David Livingstone, in Central Africa, from 1865 to His Death: Continued by a Narrative of His Last Moments and Sufferings, Obtained from His Faithful Servants Chuma and Susi ; in Two Volumes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S_dgAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA141|volume=Vol. 2|year=1874|publisher=J.

During this expedition, Stanley used sectional boats and dug-out canoes to pass the large cataracts that separated the Congo into distinct tracts. These boats were transported around the rapids before being rebuilt to travel on the next section of river. In passing the rapids many of his men were drowned, including his last white colleague, Frank Pocock.{{sfn|Stanley|1961|pp=187-}} Stanley and his men reached the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] outpost of [[Boma, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Boma]], around {{convert|100|km|mi}} from the mouth of the Congo River on the Atlantic Ocean, after 999&amp;nbsp;days on 9 August 1877.

In Stanley's ''Through the Dark Continent'' (1878) (in which he coined the term &quot;Dark Continent&quot; for Africa), Stanley said that his expedition had numbered 356,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3bkqAAAAYAAJ | title=Stanley: An Adventurer Explored | last=Hall | first=Richard | publisher=Houghton Mifflin | year=1975 | page=33| isbn=9780395194263 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Stanley|1878|p=65}} the exaggeration detracting from his achievement.

Stanley attributed his success to his leading African porters, saying that his success was &quot;all due to the pluck and intrinsic goodness of 20 men ... take the 20 out and I could not have proceeded beyond a few days' journey&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley to Edward King 2.10.1877 RMCA&lt;/ref&gt; Professor James Newman has written that &quot;establishing the connection between the Lualaba and Congo Rivers and locating the source of the Victoria Nile&quot; justified him (Newman) in stating that: &quot;In terms of exploration and discovery as defined in nineteenth-century Europe, he (Stanley) clearly stands at the top.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Newman2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=James L. |title=Imperial Footprints: Henry Morton Stanley's African Journeys|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gRVD5uW9dIwC&amp;pg=PA335|year=2004|publisher=Potomac Books|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-1-57488-597-2|pages=335–336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claiming the Congo for the Belgian king==

Stanley was approached by King [[Leopold II of Belgium]], the ambitious Belgian monarch who had organized a private holding company in 1876 disguised as an international scientific and philanthropic association, which he called the [[International African Association]].{{sfn|Stanley|1885|p=20.}} Soon after Stanley returned from the Congo, Leopold II tried to recruit him. Stanley, still hopeful for [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] backing, brushed him off. However, Leopold persisted and eventually Stanley gave in when British backing never came.

=== Stanley as Leopold's agent ===
Stanley, much more familiar with the rigours of the African climate and the complexities of local politics than [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold]] (who never in his whole life set foot in the Congo), persuaded his patron that the first step should be the construction of a wagon trail around the Congo rapids and a chain of trading stations on the river. Leopold agreed, and in deepest secrecy, Stanley signed a five-year contract at a salary of £1,000 a year and set off to [[Zanzibar]] under an assumed name. To avoid discovery, materials and workers were shipped in by various roundabout routes, and communications between Stanley and Leopold were entrusted to Colonel [[Maximilien Strauch]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hochschild2005&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = In the Heart of Darkness | last = Hochschild | first = Adam | work = The New York Review of Books | date = 6 October 2005 | accessdate = 2018-07-10 | url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2005/10/06/in-the-heart-of-darkness/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In time Stanley gained glimmerings of the magnitude of Leopold's ambition. Before Stanley arrived on the Congo, he had been told that the purpose of his mission was to construct a series of trading stations in order to open the Congo to international trade, but, in fact, Leopold secretly meant to carve out an entire nation. When Leopold admitted what he really had in mind, he was explicit: &quot;It is a question of creating a new State, as big as possible, and of running it. It is clearly understood that in this project there is no question of granting the slightest political power to the negros. That would be absurd.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gondola2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Gondola|first=Ch. Didier |title=The History of Congo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QY82GNGpcDgC|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-31696-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Colonel Strauch put the king's plan to Stanley, he was shocked and replied that creating a state in this way would be 'madness' and told the king: 'On the contrary, they [the Congolese] will retain their own tribal chiefs and be as jealous as ever of every tribal right.'&lt;ref name=&quot;jeal2007&quot; /&gt;{{rp|282}}

In October 1882, Leopold wrote angrily to Strauch: 'The terms of the treaties Stanley has made with native chiefs do not satisfy me. There must at least be an added article to the effect that they delegate to us their sovereign rights ... the treaties must be as brief as possible and in a couple of articles must grant us everything.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=H.M. Stanley Unpublished Letters|last=Maurice|first=Albert|year=1957|location=London|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim Jeal]] has described how a dissatisfied Leopold destroyed as many of Stanley's early treaties as he could get his hands on, sidelined him as a negotiator, and substituted forgeries produced by new negotiators appointed by himself. Jeal found one previously unknown original Stanley treaty in Brussels and quoted from this and from the only other surviving original treaty, showing that Stanley had not claimed the land from the chiefs, but had made rental agreements with them, paid for with goods, giving him the right to trade in certain areas, build trading stations and a road, but nothing else.&lt;ref name=&quot;jeal2007&quot; /&gt;{{rp|282–284}}  Because Leopold never trusted Stanley to deliver to him his own private state on the Congo, he would not send him back there as governor, which Stanley had expected to happen on leaving in 1885. Before that, Stanley had written to the king that no Belgian officer was entitled to treat the Congolese 'as though they were conquered subjects ... This is all wrong. They are subjects  – but it is we who are simply tenants.'&lt;ref&gt;Stanley's Congo Diaries 11.08.1883 RMCA, quoted Jeal p. 283&lt;/ref&gt;

For all his social shortcomings in European society, he had great success in building trading stations and in completing the programme of road building.  Within three years, his capacity for hard work had resulted in the presence of steamships on the upper Congo. He had also outwitted the French Empire-builder [[Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza]] and claimed the best sites on the Congo for trading stations.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} [[File:Henry M Stanley 1890.jpg|thumb|Henry Morton Stanley, 1890]]

It has been asserted without citations, that he showed skill at playing one social group off against another, and was ruthless in his use of modern weaponry to kill opponents while opening the route to the Upper Congo. This is contradicted by the written evidence of missionaries on the upper Congo. The Baptist [[T. J. Comber]] wrote that Stanley had peacefully established the trading station that would become [[Kinshasa (commune)|Kinshasa]] 'by dint of constant, daily exercise of his tact and influence over the people ... Mr Stanley had succeeded in planting his station at [[Stanley Pool]] without a fight ... '&lt;ref&gt;T.J. Comber to Baynes 2.08.1882 Regent's Park College, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years, Stanley would write that the most vexing part of his duties was not the work itself but was keeping order in the ill-assorted collection of white men he had brought with him as overseers and officers, who squabbled constantly over small matters of rank or status. &quot;Almost all of them&quot;, he wrote, &quot;clamoured for expenses of all kinds, which included ... wine, tobacco, cigars, clothes, shoes, board and lodging, and certain nameless extravagances.&quot;{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

At one stage, Stanley returned to Europe, only to be sent straight back by Leopold, who promised him an outstanding assistant: [[Charles George Gordon|Charles Gordon]], who did not in fact take up Leopold's offer but chose instead to go to meet his fate at the [[Siege of Khartoum]]. It had shocked Stanley that Gordon had been considered, since he wished to initiate war on the Arab slave traders on the upper Congo, before Leopold had sufficient guns and men safely to attempt this.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon to Stanley 6.01.1884 RMCA&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

&quot;It is indispensable&quot;, instructed Leopold, &quot;that you should purchase for the ''Comité d'Études'' (i.e., Leopold himself) as much land as you can obtain.&quot; Stanley did not do so, though shortly before leaving the Congo for good, he had witnessed an Arab massacre of hundreds of slaves and this had persuaded him that in order to stop such atrocities, in future Leopold would need to acquire 'the right of governing and of arranging all matters affecting strangers of any colour or nationality.'&lt;ref&gt;Stanley's Pallaballa Treaty 7/8 January 1883 Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Library&lt;/ref&gt; On seeing 2,300 captives in abject misery, Stanley wished that he had a [[Krupp gun]] to kill the Arabs with. 'Would to God I could see my way to set them all free and massacre the fiends guilty of the indescribably inhumanity I have seen today.'&lt;ref&gt;Stanley's Congo Diaries 27.11.1883 RMCA&lt;/ref&gt; But Leopold had denied him such weapons for fear that the French might intervene and annex the Congo.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

=== Dealings with Zanzibari slave traders ===
{{Main|Tippu Tip|Arab slave trade|Congo Arab war}}
[[Tippu Tip]], the most powerful of [[Zanzibar]]'s [[slavery|slave]] traders of the 19th century, was well known to Stanley, as was the social chaos and devastation brought by [[Slave raiding|slave-hunting]]. It had only been through Tippu Tip's help that Stanley had found Livingstone, who had survived years on the [[Lualaba River|Lualaba]] by virtue of Tippu Tip's friendship. Now, Stanley discovered that Tippu Tip's men had reached still further west in search of fresh populations to enslave.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Four years earlier, the Zanzibaris had thought the Congo deadly and impassable and warned Stanley not to attempt to go there, but when Tippu Tip learned in Zanzibar that Stanley had survived, he was quick to act. Villages throughout the region had been burned and depopulated. Tippu Tip had raided 118 villages, killed 4,000 Africans, and, when Stanley reached his camp, had 2,300 slaves, mostly young women and children, in chains ready to transport halfway across the continent to the markets of Zanzibar.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}
[[File:Henry M. Stanley 1891.jpg|thumb|left|Henry Stanley and party standing on the back of an [[observation car]] at [[Monterey, California]], 19 March 1891]]
Having found the new ruler of the Upper Congo, Stanley had no choice but to negotiate an agreement with him, to stop Tip coming further downstream and attacking [[Kinshasa|Leopoldville]], [[Kinshasa (commune)|Kinshasa]] and other stations. To achieve this, he had to allow Tip to build his final river station just below [[Boyoma Falls|Stanley Falls]], which prevented vessels sailing further upstream.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bennett1986&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bennett|first=Norman R. |title=Arab Versus European: Diplomacy and War in Nineteenth-Century East Central Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sfdyAAAAMAAJ|year=1986|publisher=Africana Publishing Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8419-0861-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} At the end of his physical resources, Stanley returned home, to be replaced by Lieutenant Colonel [[Francis de Winton]], a former [[British Army]] officer.

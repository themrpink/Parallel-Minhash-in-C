===Balkan organizations===
The Apulian mafias have long been rooted in Albania, a neighbouring country where the Italian language is widespread. The [[Albanian mafia]] collaborates with the SCU to make Albania a sorting centre for large amounts of smuggled cigarettes, and [[drug trafficking|drugs from Afghanistan]], much of which enter Italy through the coasts of Montenegro, Croatia and Albania.&lt;ref name=&quot;corrieredelmezzogiorno.corriere.it&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;{{citation |title=The Threat Posed by the Convergence of Organized Crime, Drugs Trafficking and Terrorism (written testimony to the U.S. Committee on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime) |author=Ralf Mutschke (Assistant Director, Criminal Intelligence Directorate) |publisher=Interpol |date=13 December 2000 |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/congress/2000_h/001213-mutschke.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 July 1999 police in Durrës (Albania), with Italian assistance, arrested one of the godfathers of the Sacra Corona Unita. This Albanian link seems to confirm that the Sacra Corona Unita and the Albanian mafia are &quot;partners&quot; in Apulia and delegate several criminal activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;

==Rivals==
The internal difficulties of the SCU aided the birth of antagonistic criminal groups such as:
*''Remo Lecce Libera'': formed by some leading criminal figures from Lecce, who claim to be independent from any criminal group other than the 'Ndrangheta. The term Remo indicates Remo Morello, a criminal from the [[Salento]] area, killed by criminals from the [[Campania]] region because he opposed any external interference;
*''Nuova Famiglia Salentina'': formed in 1986 by De Matteis Pantaleo, from Lecce and stemming from the Famiglia Salentina Libera born in the early 1980s as an autonomous criminal movement in the [[Salento]] area with no links with extra-regional Mafia expressions;
*''Rosa dei Venti'': formed in 1990 by De Tommasi in the Lecce prison, following an internal division in the SCU.&lt;ref&gt;Le criminalità organizzate nell'Italia meridionale continentale: camorra, 'ndrangheta, sacra corona unita Carlo Alfiero, Generale di Brigata - Comandante Scuola Ufficiali CC&lt;/ref&gt;

===Società Foggiana===
{{main|Società foggiana}}
The murder of Giuseppe Laviano, lieutenant of the Sacra Corona Unita in [[Foggia]] (whose body was never found), in January 1989, mark a turning point in the mafia war and the rise of Rocco Moretti, known as ''il porco'' (the pig),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ilrestodelgargano.it/cronaca/2017/10/news/fermato-un-pezzo-da-novanta-della-mafia-foggiana-ecco-chi-e-rocco-moretti-21208.html |title=Fermato un pezzo da novanta della mafia foggiana: ecco chi è Rocco Moretti|trans-title=A big gun of the Foggia mafia has been stopped: this is who Rocco Moretti is|newspaper= ilrestodelgargano.it |language=Italian |date= October 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of the Foggia organized crime at the expense of Laviano himself. After the murder, Moretti became the head of the new criminal organization ''[[Società foggiana]]'' in Foggia. Following the arrests made by the police in the ''Mantide'' operation, among the many details, macabre revelations also emerged, such as the photo of Laviano's severed head, shown to the main members of the ''Società Foggiana'' during the summits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2005/07/09/colpo-alla-mafia-foggiana-decapitavano-nemici.html |title=Colpo alla mafia foggiana 'Decapitavano i nemici'|trans-title=Blow to the Foggia mafia who 'beheaded their enemies' |newspaper= [[la Repubblica]] |language=Italian |date= July 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relations between the Foggia delinquency and the Camorra are probably the oldest and deepest ones. The Foggia delinquency has managed to make the qualitative leap thanks to the Camorra, particularly the [[Nuova Camorra Organizzata]]; during the NCO period many &quot;Cutoliani&quot; spent periods of imprisonment in the prisons of [[San Severo]] and Foggia, making contacts with and recruiting local criminals. Raffaele Cutolo's sister [[Rosetta Cutolo]] spent time in San Severo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://notizie.tiscali.it/cronaca/articoli/tribunale-quarta-mafia-ha-ordinato-strage |title= L'inchiesta, Il tribunale della Quarta mafia ha ordinato la strage. Ed ha un esercito di mille soldati |website= notizie.tiscali.it|language=Italian |date= August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cutolo even organized a sort of offshoot of the NCO in northern Apulia, the ''Nuova Camorra Pugliese''; the killing of Don Peppe Sciorio, Lieutenant of Cutolo for Foggia, was another clear sign that the Foggia criminals wanted to become independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foggiatoday.it/cronaca/strage-del-bacardi-giosue-rizzi-societa-foggiana.html|title= Giosuè Rizzi, la strage del circolo Bacardi e la &quot;Società&quot; foggiana&quot; |newspaper= FoggiaToday.it |language=Italian |date= January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Società Foggiana'' is considered the most brutal and bloody of all the Italian mafias.&lt;ref name=&quot;vice.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/it/article/negeek/societa-foggiana-mafia-italia |title= Come la Società Foggiana è diventata la mafia più brutale e sanguinosa d'Italia |website= vice.com/it |date= March 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most powerful clans inside the Società Foggiana are the ''Trisciuoglio clan'', the ''Sinesi-Francavilla clan'''  and the ''Moretti-Pellegrino-Lanza clan''.&lt;ref name=&quot;vice.com&quot;/&gt;

In September 2019, the Italian police dismantled an international [[Drug-trafficking|drug trafficking]] alliance between the powerful Gionta clan of the Camorra, the Società Foggiana, and Moroccan drug traffickers.&lt;ref name=&quot;ilmattino.it&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ilmattino.it/napoli/cronaca/spaccio_internazionale_di_droga_accordo_tra_mafia_foggiana_e_gionta-4744882.html|title=Spaccio internazionale di droga: accordo tra mafia foggiana e Gionta: operazione a Trento|website=www.ilmattino.it|access-date=2019-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation started in 2016 against a [[Maghreb]] gang based in the region of [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol|Trentino-Alto Adige]]. The vast network of drug traffickers, extended from Morocco, passing through Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands to finally arrive in [[Trentino]] and in [[Bolzano]]. Arriving in Italy, the drugs were sold in parks, historic centers and near schools by mainly Tunisian and Moroccan pushers. Nineteen people were arrested, with four still being wanted in Italy, Spain and in the Netherlands at the time, and seventy-three under investigation. Over one ton of hashish and 2&amp;nbsp;kg of cocaine were seized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lavocedelnordest.eu/operazionecarthago/|title=Operazione ‘Carthago’ della Finanza di Trento: scovati 73 trafficanti e 1 tonnellata di hashish, spacciavano vicino alle scuole – LaVocedelNordEst|language=it-IT|trans-title=Operation &quot;Carthago&quot;: by Trento Finance Police: 73 traffickers and 1 ton of hashish were found, peddling near schools|date=19 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ilmattino.it&quot;/&gt;

In January 2020 two bomb attempts were made in Foggia to murder a key witness in a major trial against mobsters; nobody was injured. The anti-mafia task force was reinforced after the attacks, and 20,000 people marched through Foggia in a protest organised by the anti-mafia group [[Libera. Associazioni, nomi e numeri contro le mafie|Libera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/16/italy-to-strengthen-anti-mafia-task-force-after-bomb-in-foggia |title=Italy to strengthen anti-mafia task force after bomb in Foggia |newspaper=The Guardian|agency=AFP|date= 16 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==

=== Military usage ===
[[File:NavyPier1915.jpg|thumb|left|During construction, 1915 (''Chicago Daily News'')]]
Navy Pier opened to the public on July 15, 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-navy-pier-updates-20160427-htmlstory.html|title=Navy Pier at 100: How the Chicago icon will be changing
|author=Bentle, Kyle|date=April 28, 2016|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=May 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally known as the &quot;Municipal Pier&quot;, the pier was built by [[Charles Sumner Frost]], a nationally known architect, with a design based on the [[Burnham Plan of Chicago|1909 Plan of Chicago]] by  [[Daniel Burnham]] and [[Edward H. Bennett]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://navypier.com/pdf15/The_Centennial_Vision.pdf|title=PDF of Navy Pier|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its original purpose was to serve as a dock for freights, passenger traffic, and indoor and outdoor recreation; events like expositions and pageants were held there.

In mid-1918, the pier was also used as a jail for draft dodgers. In 1927, the pier was renamed Navy Pier to honor the naval veterans who served in [[World War I]].

In 1941, during [[World War II]], the pier became a training center for the [[United States Navy]]; about 10,000 people worked, trained and lived there. The pier contained a 2,500-seat theater, gym, 12-chair barber shop, tailor, cobbler shops, soda fountain and a vast kitchen and hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-01-08/site/ct-per-flash-navypier-0108-20120109-24_1_navy-pier-municipal-pier-naval-base|title=Chicago history, Chicago Flashback: Navy Pier|work =Chicago Tribune|date=January 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, as the Navy was winding down from its mission, the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] held classes at the pier. As the maximum capacity was exceeded, the school outgrew the pier and the university relocated to Circle Campus in 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;pier&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last1= Grossman|first1=Ron|title=University of Illinois at Navy Pier opened in 1946 to serve WWII veterans|url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-navy-pier-university-illinois-flashback-perspec-0710-md-20160707-story.html|accessdate=January 27, 2018|work=Chicago Tribune|date=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the university left, the Navy Pier became underutilized.

=== Later use ===
[[File:Navy Pier, Chicago, IL 11-24-15.jpg|thumb|left|Navy Pier in November 2015]]
In 1959, the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] opened and increased commercial shipping activity at the pier for a short time, though business died down and left for more modern facilities at [[Lake Calumet]].

In 1976, the East End buildings were renovated and for a brief period the pier was alive again, home to summer events like [[ChicagoFest]]. But maintenance was not done and the pier went into decline.

In 1989, the City of Chicago had the [[Urban Land Institute]] (ULI) reimagine uses for the pier. The [[Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority]] (MPEA) was created; its responsibility was to manage and operate Navy Pier as well as [[McCormick Place]]. The MPEA undertook the redevelopment, incorporating some of ULI's recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org|title=Encyclopedia of Chicago|website=www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org|access-date=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Navy Pier was redesigned and introduced to the public as a mixed-use venue incorporating retail, dining, entertainment and cultural spaces.

===Redevelopment===
[[File:Navy pier current logo.svg|left|thumb|Navy Pier logo as of 2008]]
Efforts to update Navy Pier for the 21st century began on January 13, 2006, when the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority released a proposal for a major renovation of the Pier, which including a monorail, a 260-foot (79 m) spokeless Ferris wheel, a roller coaster, floating hotel, and a water park with a Great Lakes theme. The plan would have included nearly double the current parking and a replacement theater with a greater capacity. At the time of the announcement, a price tag of $2 billion was announced.

Following the reorganization of the agency that runs Navy Pier and McCormick Place, a new study was commissioned to reinvigorate the upgrade process. The new study, by the Urban Land Institute, was released on November 11, 2010 and recommended a more modest set of enhancements aimed at retaining the Pier's role as a public space, rather than turning it into a theme park. Suggested elements include a concert venue, an enlarged [[Chicago Shakespeare Theater]] space, new restaurants, a renovated commercial area around the Pier's entrance and additional park-like features to bring people closer to the lake. More grandiose possibilities, including the enlarged Ferris wheel and a hotel, are mentioned as more remote possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-1110-focus-pier--20101111,0,4580502.story|title=Second Crack at Navy Pier Upgrade|date=November 11, 2010|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Navy Pier Ferry wheel.jpg|thumb|The iconic Navy Pier wheel, which was retired on September 27, 2015]]In March 2012, a competition led to selection of a design concept presented by a team led by [[James Corner]] of James Corner Field Operations that focuses on the Pier's role as a waterfront promenade. In 2013, the Authority announced plans to carry out the first elements of a streamlined version of that concept, with reworked streetscape and a wider pedestrian space, moving tour-boat moorings to improve the view from a new central stairway centered on the Ferris wheel.

''The Centennial Vision''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s first phase was completed in summer 2016. Work included the redesign of the Pier's public spaces, known as Pierscape, and improvements to the interior of the Family Pavilion and South Arcade. Phase I projects included the transformation of South Dock into a more engaging, greener space, conversion of the South Arcade indoor walkway into a Chicago-themed food experience and creation of a lighted water fountain/ice skating rink in Polk Bros Park. In November 2016, Phase I development achieved Gold certification under the Sustainable SITES Initiative (SITES) rating system, based on its expanded green spaces, improved pedestrian access, energy efficiency, innovative storm water management, and use of recycled local materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://navypier.com/history-centennial-vision/|title=History of the Centennial Vision &amp; Redevelopment {{!}} Navy Pier|work=Navy Pier|access-date=August 9, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

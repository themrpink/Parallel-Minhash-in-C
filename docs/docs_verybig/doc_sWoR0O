with each &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; as the angle measured from the normal of the boundary, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; as the velocity of light in the respective medium (SI units are meters per second, or m/s), and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; as the refractive index (which is unitless) of the respective medium.

The law follows from [[Fermat]]'s [[Fermat's principle|principle of least time]], which in turn follows from the propagation of light as waves.

==History==
[[Image:Ibn Sahl manuscript.jpg|thumbnail|left|Reproduction of a page of [[Ibn Sahl (mathematician)|Ibn Sahl]]'s manuscript showing his discovery of the law of refraction.]]

[[Ptolemy]], in [[Alexandria]], Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;David Michael Harland (2007). &quot;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ScORNbV0E8wC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Cassini at Saturn: Huygens results]''&quot;. p.1. {{ISBN|0-387-26129-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; had found a relationship regarding refraction angles, but it was inaccurate for angles that were not small. Ptolemy was confident he had found an accurate empirical law, partially as a result of slightly altering his data to fit theory (see: [[confirmation bias]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ptolemy (ca. 100-ca. 170) |work=Eric Weinstein's World of Scientific Biography |url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Ptolemy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alhazen]], in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (1021), came closer to discovering the law of refraction, though he did not take this step.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. I. Sabra]] (1981), ''Theories of Light from Descartes to Newton'', [[Cambridge University Press]].

The law eventually named after Snell was first accurately described by the Persian scientist [[Ibn Sahl (mathematician)|Ibn Sahl]] at the [[Baghdad]] court in 984. In the manuscript ''On Burning Mirrors and Lenses'', Sahl used the law to derive lens shapes that focus light with no geometric aberrations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rashed1990&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rashed |first=Roshdi |year=1990 |title=A pioneer in anaclastics: Ibn Sahl on burning mirrors and lenses |journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]] |doi=10.1086/355456 |volume=81 |issue=3 |pages=464–491|s2cid=144361526 }}{{Disputed inline|Elaborate on Ibn Sahl's authorship of the law|date=November 2017|reason=Treatise by Roshdi Rashed/Ibn Sahl is without experimental underpinning and lacks foundation in theory: conflict with article by Dr. Gorden Videen.}}{{clarify |date=November 2017 |reason=conflicts with Rashed (1990), p.491: “when attention is paid to the problems raised by the image of an object observed through a lens, the situation becomes quite different; in this case it is impossible to avoid difficulties as astigmatism and aberration”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law was rediscovered by [[Thomas Harriot]] in 1602,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kwan |first1=A. |last2=Dudley |first2=J. |last3=Lantz |first3=E. |year=2002 |title=Who really discovered Snell's law? |journal=[[Physics World]] |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=64 |doi=10.1088/2058-7058/15/4/44}}&lt;/ref&gt; who however did not publish his results although he had corresponded with [[Kepler]] on this very subject. In 1621, the Dutch astronomer [[Willebrord Snellius]] (1580–1626)—Snell—derived a mathematically equivalent form, that remained unpublished during his lifetime. [[René Descartes]] independently derived the law using heuristic momentum conservation arguments in terms of sines in his 1637 essay ''[[Dioptrics]]'', and used it to solve a range of optical problems. Rejecting Descartes' solution, [[Pierre de Fermat]] arrived at the same solution based solely on his [[Fermat's principle|principle of least time]]. Descartes assumed the [[speed of light]] was infinite, yet in his derivation of Snell's law he also assumed the denser the medium, the greater the speed of light. Fermat supported the opposing assumptions, i.e., the speed of light is finite, and his derivation depended upon the speed of light being slower in a denser medium.&lt;ref&gt;[[Florian Cajori]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=XNtUAAAAYAAJ ''A History of Physics in its Elementary Branches: Including the Evolution of Physical Laboratories''] (1922)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand Rosenberger, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hxsAAAAAQAAJ ''Geschichte der Physik''] (1882) Part. II, p.114&lt;/ref&gt; Fermat's derivation also utilized his invention of [[adequality]], a mathematical procedure equivalent to differential calculus, for finding maxima, minima, and tangents.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Benjamin Boyer]], ''The Rainbow: From Myth to Mathematics'' (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Florian Cajori]], &quot;Who was the First Inventor of Calculus&quot; ''The American Mathematical Monthly'' (1919) [https://books.google.com/books?id=5wxLAAAAYAAJ Vol.26]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his influential mathematics book [[La Géométrie|''Geometry'']], Descartes solves a problem that was worked on by [[Apollonius of Perga]] and [[Pappus of Alexandria]]. Given n lines L and a point P(L) on each line, find the locus of points Q such that the lengths of the line segments QP(L) satisfy certain conditions.  For example, when n = 4, given the lines a, b, c, and d and a point A on a, B on b, and so on, find the locus of points Q such that the product QA*QB equals the product QC*QD. When the lines are not all parallel, Pappus showed that the loci are conics, but when Descartes considered larger n, he obtained cubic and higher degree curves. To show that the cubic curves were interesting, he showed that they arose naturally in optics from Snell's law.&lt;ref&gt;The Geometry of Rene Descartes (Dover Books on Mathematics) by Rene Descartes, David Eugene Smith and Marcia L. Latham (Jun 1, 1954).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dijksterhuis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dijksterhuis |first=Fokko Jan |year=2004 |title=Lenses and Waves: Christiaan Huygens and the Mathematical Science of Optics in the Seventeenth Century |publisher=Springer |isbn=1-4020-2697-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cPFevyomPUIC&amp;q=Descartes-had-seen-Snel%27s+intitle:Lenses+intitle:and+intitle:Waves+intitle:Christiaan&amp;pg=PA135}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;In ''De natura lucis et proprietate'' (1662) [[Isaac Vossius]] said that Descartes had seen Snell's paper and concocted his own proof.  We now know this charge to be undeserved but it has been adopted many times since.&quot;  Both Fermat and Huygens repeated this accusation that Descartes had copied Snell. In [[French language|French]], Snell's Law is called &quot;la loi de Descartes&quot; or &quot;loi de Snell-Descartes.&quot;

[[Image:Huygens Refracted Waves.png|left|thumb|[[Christiaan Huygens]]' construction]]

In his 1678 ''[[Traité de la Lumière]]'', [[Christiaan Huygens]] showed how Snell's law of sines could be explained by, or derived from, the wave nature of light, using what we have come to call the [[Huygens–Fresnel principle]].

With the development of modern optical and electromagnetic theory, the ancient Snell's law was brought into a new stage.  In 1962, Bloembergen showed that at the boundary of nonlinear medium, the Snell's law should be written in a general form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bloembergen |first1=N. |last2=Pershan |first2=P.

== Explanation ==
[[File:SnelliusLeiden1.jpg|thumb|Snell's law on a wall in Leiden]]
Snell's law is used to determine the direction of light rays through refractive media with varying indices of refraction. The indices of refraction of the media, labeled &lt;math&gt;n_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n_2&lt;/math&gt; and so on, are used to represent the factor by which a light ray's speed decreases when traveling through a refractive medium, such as glass or water, as opposed to its velocity in a vacuum.

As light passes the border between media, depending upon the relative refractive indices of the two media, the light will either be refracted to a lesser angle, or a greater one. These angles are measured with respect to the ''normal line'', represented perpendicular to the boundary. In the case of light traveling from air into water, light would be refracted towards the normal line, because the light is slowed down in water; light traveling from water to air would refract away from the normal line.

Refraction between two surfaces is also referred to as ''reversible'' because if all conditions were identical, the angles would be the same for light propagating in the opposite direction.

Snell's law is generally true only for isotropic or specular media (such as [[glass]]). In [[anisotropic]] media such as some [[crystal]]s, [[birefringence]] may split the refracted ray into two rays, the ''ordinary'' or ''o''-ray which follows Snell's law, and the other ''extraordinary'' or ''e''-ray which may not be co-planar with the incident ray.

When the light or other wave involved is monochromatic, that is, of a single frequency, Snell's law can also be expressed in terms of a ratio of wavelengths in the two media, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin\theta_1}{\sin\theta_2} = \frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Derivations and formula==
[[Image:Snells law wavefronts.gif|right|frame|[[Wavefronts]] from a [[point source]] in the context of Snell's law. The region below the grey line has a higher [[index of refraction]], and proportionally lower [[speed of light]], than the region above it.]]
Snell's law can be derived in various ways.
===Derivation from Fermat's principle===
Snell's law can be derived from [[Fermat's principle]], which states that the light travels the path which takes the least time. By taking the [[derivative]] of the [[optical path length]], the [[stationary point]] is found giving the path taken by the light. (There are situations of light violating Fermat's principle by not taking the least time path, as in reflection in a (spherical) mirror.) In a classic analogy, the area of lower [[refractive index]] is replaced by a beach, the area of higher [[refractive index]] by the sea, and the fastest way for a rescuer on the beach to get to a [[drowning]] person in the sea is to run along a path that follows Snell's law.

[[File:Snells law Diagram B vector.svg|right|thumb|250px|Light from medium 1, point Q, enters medium 2, refraction occurs, and reaches point P finally.]]
As shown in the figure to the right, assume the refractive index of medium 1 and medium 2 are &lt;math&gt;n_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_2&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Light  enters medium 2 from medium 1 via point O.

&lt;math&gt;\theta_1&lt;/math&gt; is the angle of incidence, &lt;math&gt;\theta_2&lt;/math&gt; is the angle of refraction with respect to the normal.

The phase velocities of light in medium 1 and medium 2 are
:&lt;math&gt;v_1=c/n_1&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;v_2=c/n_2&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;  is the speed of light in vacuum.

Let T be the time required for the light to travel from point Q through point O to point P. 
:&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}}{v_1} + \frac{\sqrt{b^2 + (l - x)^2}}{v_2} = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}}{v_1} + \frac{\sqrt{b^2 + l^2 -2lx + x^2}}{v_2}&lt;/math&gt;
where a, b, l and x are as denoted in the right-hand figure, x being the varying parameter.

To minimize it, one can differentiate :
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dT}{dx}=\frac{x}{v_1\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}} + \frac{ - (l - x)}{v_2\sqrt{(l-x)^2 + b^2}}=0&lt;/math&gt; (stationary point)

Note that
&lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}} =\sin\theta_1&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\frac{  l - x}{\sqrt{(l-x)^2 + b^2}}=\sin\theta_2&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dT}{dx}=\frac{\sin\theta_1}{v_1} - \frac{\sin\theta_2}{v_2}=0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin\theta_1}{v_1}=\frac{\sin\theta_2}{v_2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{n_1\sin\theta_1}{c}=\frac{n_2\sin\theta_2}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;n_1\sin\theta_1=n_2\sin\theta_2&lt;/math&gt;

===Derivation from Huygens's principle===
{{further|Huygens–Fresnel principle}}
Alternatively, Snell's law can be derived using interference of all possible paths of light wave from source to observer—it results in destructive interference everywhere except extrema of phase (where interference is constructive)—which become actual paths.

===Derivation from Maxwell's Equations===
{{further|Fresnel equations}}
Another way to derive Snell's Law involves an application of the general [[boundary conditions]] of [[Maxwell equations]] for [[electromagnetic radiation]].

===Derivation from conservation of energy and momentum===
Yet another way to derive Snell's law is based on translation symmetry considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Joannopoulos |first1=John D |last2=Johnson |first2=SG |last3=Winn |first3=JN |last4=Meade |first4=RD |year=2008 |title=Photonic Crystals: Molding the Flow of Light |edition=2nd |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton NJ |isbn=978-0-691-12456-8 |url=http://ab-initio.mit.edu/book/}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a homogeneous surface perpendicular to the z direction cannot change the transverse momentum. Since the [[Wave vector|propagation vector]] &lt;math&gt;\vec{k}&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to the photon's momentum, the transverse propagation direction &lt;math&gt;(k_x,k_y,0)&lt;/math&gt; must remain the same in both regions. Assume without loss of generality a plane of incidence in the &lt;math&gt;z,x&lt;/math&gt; plane &lt;math&gt;k_{x\text{Region}_1} = k_{x\text{Region}_2}&lt;/math&gt;. Using the well known dependence of the [[wavenumber]] on the [[refractive index]] of the medium, we derive Snell's law immediately.

:&lt;math&gt;k_{x\text{Region}_1} = k_{x\text{Region}_2} \, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; n_1 k_0\sin\theta_1 = n_2 k_0\sin\theta_2 \, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; n_1\sin\theta_1 = n_2\sin\theta_2 \, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_0=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda_0}=\frac{\omega}{c}&lt;/math&gt; is the wavenumber in vacuum. Although no surface is truly homogeneous at the atomic scale, full translational symmetry is an excellent approximation whenever the region is homogeneous on the scale of the light wavelength.

===Vector form===
{{see also|Specular reflection#Direction of reflection}}

Given a normalized light vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{l}&lt;/math&gt; (pointing from the light source toward the surface) and a normalized plane normal vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{n}&lt;/math&gt;, one can work out the normalized reflected and refracted rays, via the cosines of the angle of incidence &lt;math&gt;\theta_1&lt;/math&gt; and angle of refraction &lt;math&gt;\theta_2&lt;/math&gt;, without explicitly using the sine values or any trigonometric functions or angles:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glassner |first=Andrew S. |year=1989 |title=An Introduction to Ray Tracing |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann |isbn=0-12-286160-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YPblYyLqBM4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\cos\theta_1 = -\vec{n}\cdot \vec{l}&lt;/math&gt;

Note: &lt;math&gt;\cos\theta_1&lt;/math&gt; must be positive, which it will be if &lt;math&gt;\vec{n}&lt;/math&gt; is the normal vector that points from the surface toward the side where the light is coming from, the region with index &lt;math&gt;n_1&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\cos\theta_1&lt;/math&gt; is negative, then &lt;math&gt;\vec{n}&lt;/math&gt; points to the side without the light, so start over with &lt;math&gt;\vec{n}&lt;/math&gt; replaced by its negative.

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_{\mathrm{reflect}}=\vec{l} + 2\cos\theta_1 \vec{n}&lt;/math&gt;
This reflected direction vector points back toward the side of the surface where the light came from.

Now apply Snell's law to the ratio of sines to derive the formula for the refracted ray's direction vector:
:&lt;math&gt;\sin\theta_2 = \left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right) \sin\theta_1 = \left( \frac{n_1}{n_2} \right) \sqrt{ 1 - \left(\cos\theta_1 \right)^2 }&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\theta_2 = \sqrt{1-(\sin\theta_2)^2} = \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{n_1}{n_2} \right)^2 \left( 1 - \left( \cos\theta_1 \right)^2 \right)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_{\mathrm{refract}} = \left( \frac{n_1}{n_2} \right) \vec{l} + \left( \frac{n_1}{n_2} \cos\theta_1 - \cos\theta_2 \right) \vec{n}&lt;/math&gt;

The formula may appear simpler in terms of renamed simple values &lt;math&gt; r = n_1 / n_2 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; c = -\vec{n}\cdot \vec{l}&lt;/math&gt;, avoiding any appearance of trig function  names or angle names:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_{\mathrm{refract}} = r \vec{l} + \left( r c - \sqrt{1 - r^2 \left( 1 - c^2 \right)} \right) \vec{n}&lt;/math&gt;

Example:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{l} = \{0.707107, -0.707107\}, ~ \vec{n} = \{0,1\}, ~ r = \frac{n_1}{n_2} = 0.9&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c = \cos\theta_1=0.707107, ~ \sqrt{1 - r^2 \left( 1 - c^2 \right)} = \cos\theta_2 = 0.771362&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_{\mathrm{reflect}}=\{0.707107, 0.707107\}
,~\vec{v}_{\mathrm{refract}}=\{0.636396, -0.771362\}&lt;/math&gt;

The cosine values may be saved and used in the [[Fresnel equations]] for working out the intensity of the resulting rays.

[[Total internal reflection]] is indicated by a negative [[radicand]] in the equation for &lt;math&gt;\cos\theta_2&lt;/math&gt;, which can only happen for rays crossing into a less-dense medium (&lt;math&gt; n_2 &lt; n_1&lt;/math&gt;).

The mechanism of these physical changes is still not clear.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hammel2007&quot; /&gt; Near the summer and winter solstices, Uranus's hemispheres lie alternately either in full glare of the Sun's rays or facing deep space. The brightening of the sunlit hemisphere is thought to result from the local thickening of the methane clouds and haze layers located in the troposphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rages Hammel et al. 2004&quot; /&gt; The bright collar at −45° latitude is also connected with methane clouds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rages Hammel et al. 2004&quot; /&gt; Other changes in the southern polar region can be explained by changes in the lower cloud layers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rages Hammel et al. 2004&quot; /&gt; The variation of the microwave [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]] from Uranus is probably caused by changes in the deep tropospheric [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]], because thick polar clouds and haze may inhibit convection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hofstadter &amp; Butler 2003&quot; /&gt; Now that the spring and autumn equinoxes are arriving on Uranus, the dynamics are changing and convection can occur again.&lt;ref name=&quot;planetary&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hofstadter &amp; Butler 2003&quot; /&gt;

Many argue that the differences between the ice giants and the gas giants extend to their formation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thommes1999&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brunini1999&quot; /&gt; The Solar System is hypothesised to have formed from a giant rotating ball of gas and dust known as the [[presolar nebula]]. Much of the nebula's gas, primarily hydrogen and helium, formed the Sun, and the dust grains collected together to form the first protoplanets. As the planets grew, some of them eventually accreted enough matter for their gravity to hold on to the nebula's leftover gas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thommes1999&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brunini1999&quot; /&gt; The more gas they held onto, the larger they became; the larger they became, the more gas they held onto until a critical point was reached, and their size began to increase exponentially. The ice giants, with only a few Earth masses of nebular gas, never reached that critical point.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thommes1999&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brunini1999&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheppard Jewitt Kleyna 2006&quot; /&gt; Recent simulations of [[planetary migration]] have suggested that both ice giants formed closer to the Sun than their present positions, and moved outwards after formation (the [[Nice model]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Thommes1999&quot; /&gt;

Uranus has 27 known [[natural satellites]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheppard Jewitt Kleyna 2006&quot; /&gt; The names of these satellites are chosen from characters in the works of [[Shakespeare]] and [[Alexander Pope]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Faure2007&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nineplanets&quot; /&gt; The five main satellites are [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]], [[Ariel (moon)|Ariel]], [[Umbriel (moon)|Umbriel]], [[Titania (moon)|Titania]], and [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Faure2007&quot; /&gt; The Uranian satellite system is the least massive among those of the giant planets; the combined mass of the five major satellites would be less than half that of [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] (largest moon of [[Neptune]]) alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobson Campbell et al. 1992&quot; /&gt; The largest of Uranus's satellites, Titania, has a radius of only {{convert|788.9|km|mi|abbr=on}}, or less than half that of the [[Moon]], but slightly more than Rhea, the second-largest satellite of Saturn, making Titania the [[List of natural satellites by diameter|eighth-largest moon]] in the Solar System. Uranus's satellites have relatively low albedos; ranging from 0.20 for Umbriel to 0.35 for Ariel (in green light).&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith Soderblom et al. 1986&quot; /&gt; They are ice–rock conglomerates composed of roughly 50% ice and 50% rock.

=== Planetary rings ===
{{main|Rings of Uranus}}

The Uranian rings are composed of extremely dark particles, which vary in size from micrometres to a fraction of a metre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith Soderblom et al. 1986&quot; /&gt; Thirteen distinct rings are presently known, the brightest being the ε ring. All except two rings of Uranus are extremely narrow – they are usually a few kilometres wide. The rings are probably quite young; the dynamics considerations indicate that they did not form with Uranus. The matter in the rings may once have been part of a moon (or moons) that was shattered by high-speed impacts. From numerous pieces of debris that formed as a result of those impacts, only a few particles survived, in stable zones corresponding to the locations of the present rings.&lt;ref name=&quot;summary&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Esposito2002&quot; /&gt;

William Herschel described a possible ring around Uranus in 1789. This sighting is generally considered doubtful, because the rings are quite faint, and in the two following centuries none were noted by other observers. Still, Herschel made an accurate description of the epsilon ring's size, its angle relative to Earth, its red colour, and its apparent changes as Uranus travelled around the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Uranus rings 'were seen in 1700s' |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6569849.stm |date=19 April 2007 |access-date=19 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Did William Herschel Discover The Rings of Uranus in the 18th Century? |work=Physorg.com |url=http://www.physorg.com/news95949762.html |date=2007 |access-date=20 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ring system was definitively discovered on 10 March 1977 by [[James L. Elliot]], Edward W. Dunham, and [[Jessica Mink]] using the [[Kuiper Airborne Observatory]]. The discovery was serendipitous; they planned to use the [[occultation]] of the star SAO 158687 (also known as HD 128598) by Uranus to study its [[atmosphere]]. When their observations were analysed, they found that the star had disappeared briefly from view five times both before and after it disappeared behind Uranus. They concluded that there must be a ring system around Uranus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elliot1977&quot; /&gt; Later they detected four additional rings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elliot1977&quot; /&gt; The rings were directly imaged when ''Voyager&amp;nbsp;2'' passed Uranus in 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith Soderblom et al. 1986&quot; /&gt; ''Voyager&amp;nbsp;2'' also discovered two additional faint rings, bringing the total number to eleven.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith Soderblom et al. 1986&quot; /&gt;

In December 2005, the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] detected a pair of previously unknown rings. The largest is located twice as far from Uranus as the previously known rings. These new rings are so far from Uranus that they are called the &quot;outer&quot; ring system. Hubble also spotted two small satellites, one of which, [[Mab (moon)|Mab]], shares its orbit with the outermost newly discovered ring. The new rings bring the total number of Uranian rings to 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA's Hubble Discovers New Rings and Moons Around Uranus |work=Hubblesite |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2005/33/ |date=2005 |access-date=9 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2006, images of the new rings from the [[Keck Observatory]] yielded the colours of the outer rings: the outermost is blue and the other one red.&lt;ref name=&quot;dePater2006&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Blue ring discovered around Uranus |publisher=UC Berkeley News |last=Sanders |first=Robert |url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2006/04/06_bluering.shtml |date=6 April 2006 |access-date=3 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One hypothesis concerning the outer ring's blue colour is that it is composed of minute particles of water ice from the surface of Mab that are small enough to scatter blue light.&lt;ref name=&quot;dePater2006&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Blue ring of Uranus linked to sparkling ice |author=Battersby, Stephen |work=New Scientist |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8960-blue-ring-of-uranus-linked-to-sparkling-ice.html |date=April 2006 |access-date=9 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Uranus's inner rings appear grey.&lt;ref name=&quot;dePater2006&quot; /&gt;

{{main|Exploration of Uranus}}
[[File:Uranus Final Image.jpg|thumb|upright|Crescent Uranus as imaged by ''Voyager&amp;nbsp;2'' while en route to Neptune]]

In 1986, [[NASA]]'s ''[[Voyager&amp;nbsp;2]]'' interplanetary probe encountered Uranus. This [[planetary flyby|flyby]] remains the only investigation of Uranus carried out from a short distance and no other visits are planned. Launched in 1977, ''Voyager&amp;nbsp;2'' made its closest approach to Uranus on 24 January 1986, coming within {{convert|81500|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the cloudtops, before continuing its journey to Neptune. The spacecraft studied the structure and chemical composition of Uranus's atmosphere,&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler 1986&quot; /&gt; including its unique weather, caused by its axial tilt of 97.77°. It made the first detailed investigations of its five largest moons and discovered 10 new ones. It examined all nine of the [[Rings of Uranus|system's known rings]] and discovered two more.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith Soderblom et al. 1986&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;summary&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Voyager: The Interstellar Mission: Uranus |work=JPL |url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/science/uranus.html |date=2004 |access-date=9 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also studied the magnetic field, its irregular structure, its tilt and its unique corkscrew [[magnetosphere|magnetotail]] caused by Uranus's sideways orientation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ness Acuña et al. 1986&quot; /&gt;

''[[Voyager 1]]'' was unable to visit Uranus because investigation of [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] was considered a priority. This trajectory took ''Voyager 1'' out of the plane of the [[ecliptic]], ending its planetary science mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swift1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=David W.

The possibility of sending the [[Cassini–Huygens|''Cassini'' spacecraft]] from Saturn to Uranus was evaluated during a mission extension planning phase in 2009, but was ultimately rejected in favour of destroying it in the Saturnian atmosphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;spilker&quot; /&gt; It would have taken about twenty years to get to the Uranian system after departing Saturn.&lt;ref name=&quot;spilker&quot; /&gt; A [[Uranus orbiter and probe]] was recommended by the 2013–2022 [[Planetary Science Decadal Survey]] published in 2011; the proposal envisages launch during 2020–2023 and a 13-year cruise to Uranus.&lt;ref name=uop /&gt; A Uranus entry probe could use [[Pioneer Venus Multiprobe]] heritage and descend to 1–5 atmospheres.&lt;ref name=uop /&gt; The ESA evaluated a &quot;medium-class&quot; mission called [[Uranus Pathfinder]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/13248-nasa-uranus-missions-solar-system.html Michael Schirber – Missions Proposed to Explore Mysterious Tilted Planet Uranus (2011) – Astrobiology Magazine].

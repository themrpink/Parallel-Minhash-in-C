In the Southern United States, catfish species may be known by a variety of slang names, such as &quot;mud cat&quot;, &quot;polliwogs&quot;, or &quot;chuckleheads&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/publications/pwdpubs/media/pwd_br_t3200_0236.pdf Texas Dept. Wildlife]&lt;/ref&gt; These nicknames are not standardized, so one area may call a bullhead catfish by the nickname &quot;chucklehead&quot;, while in another state or region, that nickname refers to the blue catfish.

===As invasive species===
[[File:Clarias batrachus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Walking catfish]] is an [[invasive species]] in Florida.]]

Representatives of the [[genus]] ''[[Ictalurus]]'' have been introduced into European waters in the hope of obtaining a sporting and food resource. However, the European stock of American catfishes has not achieved the dimensions of these fish in their native waters, and have only increased the ecological pressure on native European [[fauna]]. [[Walking catfish]] have also been introduced in the freshwaters of Florida, with the voracious catfish becoming a major alien pest there. [[Flathead catfish]], ''Pylodictis olivaris'', is also a North American pest on Atlantic slope drainages.&lt;ref name=tol/&gt; ''[[Pterygoplichthys]]'' species, released by aquarium fishkeepers, have also established [[feral]] populations in many warm waters around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The South American Suckermouth Armored Catfish, ''Pterygoplichthys anisitsi'' (Pisces: Loricaridae), in Texas, with Comments on Foreign Fish Introductions in the American Southwest|first=Leo G.|last=Nico|author2=Martin, R.

==Physical characteristics==

===External anatomy of catfish===
[[File:Corydoras semiaquilus 1.jpg|left|thumb|The armor plates are evident in ''[[Corydoras semiaquilus]]''.]]

Most catfish are [[bottom feeder]]s. In general, they are [[buoyancy|negatively buoyant]], which means that they will usually sink rather than float due to a reduced [[gas bladder]] and a heavy, bony head.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruton&quot;/&gt; Catfish have a variety of body shapes, though most have a cylindrical body with a flattened [[Anatomical terms of location|ventrum]] to allow for benthic feeding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruton&quot;/&gt;

A flattened head allows for digging through the substrate as well as perhaps serving as a [[hydrofoil]]. Some have a mouth that can expand to a large size and contains no [[incisor|incisiform]] teeth; catfish generally feed through [[suction]] or gulping rather than biting and cutting prey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruton&quot;/&gt; However, some families, notably [[Loricariidae]] and [[Astroblepidae]], have a [[suckermouth]] that allows them to fasten themselves to objects in fast-moving water. Catfish also have a [[Fish anatomy#Head|maxilla]] reduced to a support for [[barbel (anatomy)|barbels]]; this means that they are unable to protrude their mouths as other fish such as [[carp]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruton&quot;/&gt;

Catfish may have up to four pairs of barbels: nasal, maxillary (on each side of mouth), and two pairs of chin barbels, though pairs of barbels may be absent depending on the species. Catfish barbels always come as pairs. Many larger catfish also have [[chemoreceptor]]s across their entire bodies, which means they &quot;taste&quot; anything they touch and &quot;smell&quot; any chemicals in the water. &quot;In catfish, [[gustation]] plays a primary role in the orientation and location of food&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Atema, Jelle (1980) [https://books.google.com/books?id=TZbRp0z5-p0C&amp;pg=PA57 &quot;Chemical senses, chemical signals, and feeding behavior in fishes&quot;] pp. 57–101. In: Bardach, JE ''Fish behavior and its use in the capture and culture of fishes', The WorldFish Center, {{ISBN|978-971-02-0003-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because their barbels and chemoreception are more important in detecting food, the eyes on catfish are generally small. Like other [[ostariophysi|ostariophysan]]s, they are characterized by the presence of a [[Weberian apparatus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;/&gt; Their well-developed Weberian apparatus and reduced [[gas bladder]] allow for improved [[hearing (sense)|hearing]] as well as sound production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruton&quot;/&gt;

Catfish do not have [[scale (anatomy)|scale]]s; their bodies are often naked. In some species, the [[mucus]]-covered [[skin]] is used in [[cutaneous respiration]], where the fish breathes through its skin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruton&quot;/&gt; In some catfish, the skin is covered in bony plates called [[scute]]s; some form of body armor appears in various ways within the order. In [[Loricarioidea|loricarioids]] and in the Asian genus ''[[Sisor]]'', the armor is primarily made up of one or more rows of free [[dermis|dermal]] plates. Similar plates are found in large specimens of ''[[Lithodoras]]''. These plates may be supported by [[vertebra]]l [[Process (anatomy)|process]]es, as in [[Scoloplacidae|scoloplacids]] and in ''Sisor'', but the processes never fuse to the plates or form any external armor. By contrast, in the subfamily Doumeinae (family [[Amphiliidae]]) and in hoplomyzontines ([[Aspredinidae]]), the armor is formed solely by expanded vertebral processes that form plates. Finally, the lateral armor of [[Doradidae|doradids]], ''Sisor'', and hoplomyzontines consists of hypertrophied [[lateral line]] [[ossicle]]s with dorsal and ventral [[lamina (algae)|lamina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Friel, J P  |author2=Lundberg, J G |year=1996|title=''Micromyzon akamai'', gen. et sp. nov., a small and eyeless banjo catfish (Siluriformes: Aspredinidae) from the river channels of the lower Amazon basin|journal=[[Copeia]]|issue=3|pages=641–648|jstor=1447528|volume=1996|doi=10.2307/1447528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Channelcat.jpg|thumb|The [[channel catfish]] has four pairs of [[barbel (anatomy)|barbels]].]]
All catfish other than members of [[Malapteruridae]] (electric catfish), possess a strong, hollow, bony leading spine-like ray on their [[dorsal fin|dorsal]] and [[pectoral fin]]s. As a defense, these spines may be locked into place so that they stick outwards, which can inflict severe wounds.&lt;ref name=tol/&gt; In numerous catfish species, these fin rays can be used to deliver a stinging [[protein]] if the fish is irritated;&lt;ref name=fin&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.fcps.k12.va.us/StratfordLandingES/Ecology/mpages/channel_catfish.htm| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060603225626/http://www.fcps.k12.va.us/StratfordLandingES/Ecology/mpages/channel_catfish.htm| archivedate = 3 June 2006|title=Channel Catfish |accessdate=2 December 2006|publisher=Fairfax County Public Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt; as many as half of all catfish species may be venomous in this fashion, making the Siluriformes overwhelmingly the vertebrate order with the largest number of venomous species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wright |first1=Jeremy J |title=Diversity, phylogenetic distribution, and origins of venomous catfishes |journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology |date=4 December 2009 |volume=9 |pages=282 |doi=10.1186/1471-2148-9-282 |pmid=19961571 |pmc=2791775 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[venom]] is produced by [[gland]]ular cells in the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermal]] tissue covering the spines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;/&gt; In members of the family [[Plotosidae]] and of the genus ''[[Heteropneustes]]'', this protein is so strong it may hospitalize humans who receive a sting; in ''[[Plotosus|Plotosus lineatus]]'', the stings can be lethal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;/&gt;

Juvenile catfish, like most fish, have relatively large heads, eyes, and posterior median fins in comparison to larger, more mature individuals. These juveniles can be readily placed in their families, particularly those with highly derived fin or body shapes; in some cases identification of the genus is possible. As far as known for most catfish, features that are often characteristic of species such as mouth and fin positions, fin shapes, and barbel lengths show little difference between juveniles and adults. For many species, pigmentation pattern is also similar in juveniles and adults. Thus, juvenile catfishes generally resemble and develop smoothly into their adult form without distinct juvenile specializations. Exceptions to this are the ariid catfishes, where the young retain yolk sacs late into juvenile stages, and many pimelodids, which may have elongated barbels and fin filaments or coloration patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=First description of small juveniles of the primitive catfish ''Diplomystes'' (Siluriformes: Diplomystidae)|first=John G.|last=Lundberg|author2=Berra, Tim M. |author3=Friel, John P. |journal=Ichthyol.

===Size===
[[File:Bagarius yarrelli India.png|thumb|left|Giant ''[[Bagarius yarrelli]]'' (Goonch) caught in India. Some Goonch in the Kali river grow large enough to attack humans and water buffalo.]]
Catfish have one of the greatest ranges in size within a single order of [[Actinopterygii|bony fish]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruton&quot;/&gt; Many catfish have a maximum length of under 12&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;/&gt; Some of the smallest species of [[Aspredinidae]] and [[Trichomycteridae]] reach sexual maturity at only {{convert|1|cm|in}}.&lt;ref name=tol/&gt;

The [[wels catfish]], ''Silurus glanis'', and the much smaller related [[Aristotle's catfish]] are the only catfish indigenous to [[Europe]]: the former ranging throughout Europe, and the latter restricted to [[Greece]]. [[Mythology]] and literature record wels catfish of astounding proportions, yet to be proven scientifically. The average size of the species is about 1.2–1.6&amp;nbsp;m (3.9–5.2&amp;nbsp;ft), and fish more than {{convert|2|m|ft}} are rare. However, they are known to exceed {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} in length and {{convert|100|kg|lb}} in weight. In July 2009, a catfish weighing {{convert|88|kg|lb}} was caught in the [[River Ebro]], Spain, by an 11-year-old British schoolgirl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/5834754/Schoolgirl-nets-9ft-monster-fish.html | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | location=London | title=Schoolgirl nets 9ft monster fish | date=15 July 2009 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America the largest ''[[Ictalurus furcatus]]'' (Blue catfish) caught in the [[Missouri River]] on 20 July 2010, weighed {{convert|59|kg|lb}}. The largest [[flathead catfish]], ''Pylodictis olivaris'', ever caught was in [[Independence, Kansas]], weighing {{convert|56|kg|lb}}.

These records pale in comparison to a [[Mekong giant catfish|giant Mekong catfish]] caught in northern [[Thailand]] on 1 May 2005 and reported to the press almost 2 months later that weighed {{convert|293|kg|lb}}. This is the largest giant Mekong catfish caught since Thai officials started keeping records in 1981.&lt;ref name=Mekong&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/06/0629_050629_giantcatfish.html|title=Grizzly Bear-Size Catfish Caught in Thailand |accessdate=14 July 2006|publisher=National Geographic News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in Asia, [[Jeremy Wade]] caught a {{convert|75.5|kg|lb|1}} [[Bagarius yarrelli|Goonch]] following [[Kali River goonch attacks|three fatal attacks on humans]] in the [[Sharda River|Kali River]] on the [[India]]-[[Nepal]] border.  Wade was of the opinion that the offending fish must have been significantly larger than this to have taken an 18-year-old boy as well as a [[water buffalo]].{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=March 2020}}

Piraíba ''([[Brachyplatystoma|Brachyplatystoma filamentosum]])'' can grow exceptionally large and are native to the Amazon basin. They can occasionally grow to 200&amp;nbsp;kg (440&amp;nbsp;lbs), as evidenced by numerous catches. There are also reports in the region of deaths from being swallowed by these fish.

===Internal anatomy===
[[File:Kryptopterus 2.jpg|thumb|''[[Kryptopterus vitreolus]]'' (glass catfish) have transparent bodies lacking both scales and pigments. Most of the internal organs are located near the head.]]

In many catfish, the ''humeral process'' is a bony process extending backward from the [[pectoral girdle]] immediately above the base of the pectoral fin. It lies beneath the skin where its outline may be determined by dissecting the skin or probing with a needle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filaman.ifm-geomar.de/Glossary/Glossary.cfm?TermEnglish=humeral%20process|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217212539/http://filaman.ifm-geomar.de/Glossary/Glossary.cfm?TermEnglish=humeral%20process|archivedate=17 December 2007|title=Term : humeral process|publisher=[[FishBase]]|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[retina]] of catfish are composed of single [[cone cell|cone]]s and large [[rod cell|rod]]s. Many catfish have a [[tapetum lucidum]] which may help enhance [[photon]] capture and increase low-light sensitivity. [[Double cone (biology)|Double cone]]s, though present in most [[teleost]]s, are absent from catfish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Douglas&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Douglas|first=Ron H.|author2=Collin, Shaun P. |author3=Corrigan, Julie |date=15 November 2002|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/205/22/3425|title=The eyes of suckermouth armoured catfish (Loricariidae, subfamily Hypostomus): pupil response, lenticular longitudinal spherical aberration and retinal topography|publisher=The Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=205|issue=22|pages=3425–3433|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|pmid=12364396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anatomical organization of the [[testicle|testis]] in catfish is variable among the families of catfish, but the majority of them present fringed testis: Ictaluridae, Claridae, Auchenipteridae, Doradidae, Pimelodidae, and Pseudopimelodidae.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barros&quot;/&gt; In the testes of some species of Siluriformes, organs and structures such as a spermatogenic cranial region and a secretory caudal region are observed, in addition to the presence of seminal vesicles in the caudal region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brito&quot;/&gt; The total number of fringes and their length are different in the [[Caudal (anatomical term)|caudal]] and [[Skull|cranial]] portions between species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barros&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Reproductive apparatus and gametogenesis of ''Lophiosilurus alexandri'' Steindachner (Pisces, Teleostei, Siluriformes)|first=Marcelo D.

The occurrence of [[seminal vesicle]]s, in spite of their interspecific variability in size, gross morphology and function, has not been related to the mode of fertilization. They are typically paired, multi-chambered, and connected with the [[sperm duct]], and have been reported to play a glandular and a storage function. Seminal vesicle secretion may include [[steroid]]s and steroid glucuronides, with hormonal and pheromonal functions, but it appears to be primarily constituted of mucoproteins, acid mucopolysaccharides, and phospholipids.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mazzoldi&quot;/&gt;

Fish ovaries may be of two types: gymnovarian or cystovarian. In the first type, the oocytes are released directly into the [[coelom]]ic cavity and then eliminated. In the second type, the oocytes are conveyed to the exterior through the [[oviduct]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brito&quot;/&gt; Many catfish are cystovarian in type, including ''[[Pseudoplatystoma corruscans]]'', ''[[Pseudoplatystoma fasciatum|P. fasciatum]]'', ''[[Lophiosilurus alexandri]]'', and ''[[Loricaria lentiginosa]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barros&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brito&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Reproduction of the surubim catfish (Pisces, Pimelodidae) in the São Francisco River, Pirapora Region, Minas Gerais, Brazil|last=Brito|first=M.F.G.|author2=Bazzoli, N.|journal=Arquivo Brasileiro de Medicina Veterinária e Zootecnia|volume=55|issue=5|year=2003|doi=10.1590/S0102-09352003000500018|page=624|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Communication ==

=== Sound production and interpretation ===
Catfish can produce different types of sounds and also have well-developed auditory reception used to discriminate between sounds with different pitches and velocities. They are also able to determine the distance of the sound's origin and from what direction it originated.&lt;ref name=&quot;General Sounds Kasumayan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kasumayan|first=A. O.|title=Sounds and Sound Production in Fishes|journal=Journal of Ichthyology|year=2008|volume=48|issue=11|pages=981–1030|doi=10.1134/S0032945208110039|s2cid=23223714}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a very important fish communication mechanism, especially during [[agonistic behavior|agonistic]] and distress behaviors. Catfish are able to produce a variety of sounds for communication that can be classified into two groups: drumming sounds and [[stridulation]] sounds.  The variability in catfish sound signals differs due to a few factors: the mechanism by which the sound is produced, the function of the resulting sound, and physiological differences such as size, sex, and age.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stridulatory Sound Production Vance&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vance|first=Theresa L.|title=Variation in Stridulatory Sound Production in the Channel Catfish, Ictalurus Punctatus|journal=Bios|year=2000|volume=71|issue=3|pages=79–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; To create a drumming sound, catfish use an indirect vibration mechanism using a [[swimbladder]]. In these fishes, sonic muscles insert on the ramus Mulleri, also known as the elastic spring. The sonic muscles pull the elastic spring forward and extend the swimbladder. When the muscles relax, the tension in the spring quickly returns the swimbladder to its original position, which produces the sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sound Generating Mechs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ladich|first=Friedrich|author2=Michael L. Fine|title=Sound-Generating Mechanisms in Fishes: A Unique Diversity in Vertebrates|journal=Communication in Fishes|year=2006|volume=1|pages=3–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catfish also have a sound-generating mechanism in their [[pectoral fins]]. Many species in the catfish family possess an enhanced first pectoral fin ray, called the spine, which can be moved by large [[Abduction (kinesiology)|abductor]] and [[Adduction|adductor]] muscles. The base of the catfishes' spines has a sequence of ridges, and the spine normally slides within a groove on the fish's pelvic girdle during routine movement; but, pressing the ridges on the spine against the pelvic girdle groove creates a series of short pulses.&lt;ref name=&quot;General Sounds Kasumayan&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sound Generating Mechs&quot; /&gt; The movement is analogous to a finger moving down the teeth of a comb, and consequently a series of sharp taps is produced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stridulatory Sound Production Vance&quot; /&gt;

Sound-generating mechanisms are often different between genders. In some catfishes, pectoral fins are longer in males than in females of similar length, and differences in the characteristic of the sounds produced were also observed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sound Generating Mechs&quot; /&gt; Comparison between families of the same order of catfish demonstrated family and species-specific patterns of vocalization, according to a study by Maria Clara Amorim. During courtship behavior in three species of ''Corydoras'' catfishes, all males actively produced stridulation sounds before egg fertilization, and the species' songs were different in pulse number and sound duration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amorim article&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Amorim|first=Maria Clara P.|title=Diversity of Sound Production in Fish|journal=Communication in Fish|year=2006|volume=1|pages=71–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sound production in catfish may also be correlated with fighting and alarm calls. According to a study by Kaatz, sounds for disturbance (e.g. alarm) and agonistic behavior were not significantly different, which suggests distress sounds can be used to sample variation in agonistic sound production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amorim article&quot; /&gt; However, in a comparison of a few different species of tropical catfish, some fish put under distress conditions produced a higher intensity of stridulatory sounds than drumming sounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Agonistic behavior&quot;/&gt; Differences in the proportion of drumming versus stridulation sounds depend on [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] constraints, such as different sizes of drumming muscles and pectoral spines. Due to these constraints, some fish may not even be able to produce a specific sound. In several different species of catfish, aggressive sound production occurs during cover site defense or during threats from other fish. More specifically, in long-whiskered catfishes, drumming sounds are used as a threatening signal and stridulations are used as a defense signal. Kaatz investigated 83 species from 14 families of catfish, and determined that catfishes produce more stridulatory sounds in disturbance situations and more swimbladder sounds in intraspecific conflicts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Agonistic behavior&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ladich|first=Friedrich|author2=Myrberg, Arthur A, Jr.|title=Agonistic Behavior and Acoustic Communication|journal=Communication in Fishes|year=2006|volume=1|pages=121–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catfish are easy to farm in warm climates, leading to inexpensive and safe food at local grocers.

Catfish raised in inland tanks or channels are usually considered safe for the environment, since their waste and disease should be contained and not spread to the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Paul | last = Rogers | title = Economy of Scales | journal = Stanford Magazine | publisher = [[Stanford University|Stanford Alumni Association]] | issue = March / April 2006 | url = http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2006/marapr/features/fishfarming.html | accessdate = 14 February 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080611123839/http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2006/marapr/features/fishfarming.html# | archive-date = 11 June 2008 | url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Asia, many catfish species are important as food. Several [[airbreathing catfish]] (Clariidae) and [[shark catfish]] (Pangasiidae) species are heavily cultured in Africa and Asia. Exports of one particular shark catfish species from [[Vietnam]], ''[[Pangasius bocourti]]'', have met with pressures from the U.S. catfish industry. In 2003, The [[United States Congress]] passed a law preventing the imported fish from being labeled as catfish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-catfish28nov28,0,6595048.story?coll=la-home-business &quot;'Catfish' bred in Asia move up on U.S. food chain&quot;$, Associated Press via L.A.

There is a large and growing ornamental fish trade, with hundreds of species of catfish, such as ''[[Corydoras]]'' and [[Loricariidae|armored suckermouth catfish]] (often called plecos), being a popular component of many [[aquarium|aquaria]]. Other catfish commonly found in the aquarium trade are [[Aspredinidae|banjo catfish]], [[Doradidae|talking catfish]], and [[Pimelodidae|long-whiskered catfish]].

===Catfish as food===
[[File:Fisch im Restaurant.jpg|thumb|Catfish in a restaurant in [[Wuhan]] (China)]]
Catfish have widely been caught and farmed for food for hundreds of years in Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America. Judgments as to the quality and flavor vary, with some food critics considering catfish excellent to eat, while others dismiss them as watery and lacking in flavor.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;Jenny Baker (1988), ''Simply Fish'' p 36-37.

In [[Central Europe]], catfish were often viewed as a delicacy to be enjoyed on feast days and holidays. Migrants from Europe and Africa to the United States brought along this tradition, and in the [[Southern United States]], catfish is an extremely popular food.

The most commonly eaten species in the United States are the [[channel catfish]] and the [[blue catfish]], both of which are common in the wild and increasingly widely farmed. Farm-raised catfish became such a staple of the U.S. diet that President [[Ronald Reagan]] established [[National Catfish Day]] on 25 June 1987 to recognize &quot;the value of farm-raised catfish.&quot;

Catfish is eaten in a variety of ways.  In Europe it is often cooked in similar ways to [[carp]], but in the United States it is popularly crumbed with [[cornmeal]] and fried.&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt;

In [[Indonesia]], catfish is usually served fried or grilled in street stalls called ''[[warung]]'' and eaten with vegetables and [[sambal]]; the dish is called ''pecel lele'' or ''pecak lele''. The same dish can also be called as ''lele penyet'' (squashed catfish) if the fish is lightly squashed along with sambal in the stone mortar. The pecel/pecak version present the fish in separate plate while the stone mortar is solely for sambal (''Lele'' is the [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] word for catfish.)

In [[Malaysia]] catfish, called ''ikan keli'', is fried with spices or grilled and eaten with [[tamarind]] and Thai chillies gravy and also is often eaten with steamed rice.

In [[Bangladesh]] and the [[India]]n states of [[Odisha]], [[West Bengal]] and [[Assam]], catfish (locally known as ''magur'') is eaten as a favored delicacy during the monsoons. In the Indian state of [[Kerala]], the local catfish, known as ''thedu''' or ''etta'' in [[Malayalam]], is also popular.

In [[Hungary]] catfish is often cooked in [[paprika]] sauce (Harcsapaprikás) typical of Hungarian cuisine. It is traditionally served with pasta smothered with curd cheese ([[túrós csusza]]).

In [[Myanmar]] (formally Burma), catfish is usually used in ''[[mohinga]]'', a traditional noodle fish soup cooked with [[lemon grass]], [[ginger]], [[garlic]], pepper, banana stem, onions, and other local ingredients.

==Dangers to humans==
[[File:Image-Striped eel catfish2.jpg|thumb|A sting from the striped eel catfish, ''[[Plotosus lineatus]]'', may be fatal.]]

While the vast majority of catfish are harmless to humans, a few species are known to present some risk. Many catfish species have &quot;stings&quot; (actually non-venomous in most cases) embedded behind their fins; thus precautions must be taken when handling them. Stings by [[striped eel catfish]] have killed people in rare cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Fishbase species|genus=Plotosus|species=lineatus|month=November|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
The catfish are a [[monophyly|monophyletic]] group. This is supported by molecular evidence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sullivan&quot;/&gt;

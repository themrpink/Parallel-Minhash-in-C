==Transportation==
Albany County has long been at the forefront of transportation technology from the days of turnpikes and plank roads to the [[Erie Canal]], from the first passenger railroad in the state to the oldest municipal [[airport]] in the United States. Today, [[Interstates]], [[Amtrak]], and the [[Albany International Airport]] continue to make the Albany County a major crossroads of the [[Northeastern United States]].

The [[Capital District Transportation Committee]] (CDTC) is the [[Metropolitan Planning Organization]] (MPO) for the Albany-Schenectady-Troy Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Every metropolitan area in the United States with a population of over 50,000 must have a MPO in order to get any federal transportation funding. The [[US Department of Transportation]] (USDOT) uses an MPO to make decisions on what projects are most important to a metro area for immediate versus long term funding. The USDOT will not approve federal funds for transportation projects unless they are on an MPO's list.&lt;ref name=CDTC&gt;{{cite web | title = Capital District Transportation Committee | publisher = Capital District Transportation Committee | accessdate = 2009-04-23 | url = http://www.cdtcmpo.org/whatcdtc.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interstate and other major highways===
Albany County is situated at a major crossroads of the [[Northeastern United States]], first formed by the Mohawk and Hudson rivers. Even before the [[Interstate Highway System]] and the [[U.S. Highway]] system, Albany County was the hub of many [[Toll road|turnpikes]] and [[plank road]]s that connected the region, as well as the Erie Canal reaching the Great Lakes.

Today, [[Interstate 87 (New York)|Interstate 87]] and [[Interstate 90]] meet in Albany County. The [[Thomas E. Dewey Thruway|Thomas E. Dewey New York State Thruway]] is a [[toll-road]] that from Exit 24 in the city of Albany is I-87 and travels south to connect the county with [[downstate New York]]. West from Exit 24, the Thruway is I-90 and connects the county with [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], [[Utica, New York|Utica]], [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]].

North of Exit 24, I-87 is the [[Adirondack Northway]] and connects the city and county of Albany with their suburbs in [[Saratoga County, New York|Saratoga County]] and provides long-distance travel to [[Montreal]]. East of Exit 24, I-90 travels along the northern boundary of the city of Albany and exits the county on the [[Patroon Island Bridge]] into [[Rensselaer County, New York|Rensselaer County]] to access Albany's eastern suburbs. [[Interstate 787]] connects the Thruway (I-87) to [[Downtown Albany Historic District|Downtown Albany]], [[Menands, New York|Menands]], [[Watervliet, New York|Watervliet]], and [[Cohoes, New York|Cohoes]]. [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|U.S. Route 9]] enters the county on the [[Dunn Memorial Bridge]] and travels through the city of Albany north, connecting it with the suburbs in the [[Colonie, New York|Colonie]] and Saratoga County. [[U.S. Route 20 (New York)|U.S. Route 20]] also enters the county on the Dunn Memorial Bridge and travels west through Albany (city) and the Town of [[Guilderland, New York|Guilderland]]. [[New York State Route 5]] and [[New York State Route 7]] are two important highways that bisect the county and are developed as important shopping strips.

===Mass transit===
Albany County is served by the [[Capital District Transportation Authority]], a four-county bus service that also serves Rensselaer, Schenectady, and Saratoga counties. [[Greyhound Lines]], [[Trailways]], and [[Peter Pan Bus Lines|Peter Pan]]/Bonanza buses all serve a downtown terminal. A [[Chinatown bus]] service leaves from Central Avenue and provides service to Chinatown in [[Manhattan]].

===Airports===
[[Albany International Airport]] is the only commercial airport in the county. Destinations for flights out of Albany include [[Atlanta]]; [[Las Vegas]]; Chicago; [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]; and [[Orlando, Florida]], among many others.

===Rail===
Since 1968 when [[Union Station (Albany, New York)|Union Station]] in the city of Albany was abandoned for a new station across the Hudson in the city of [[Rensselaer, New York|Rensselaer]], Albany County has been without a train station. Amtrak has several routes serving the [[Albany-Rensselaer (Amtrak station)|Albany-Rensselaer Station]]. The [[Adirondack (Amtrak)|Adirondack]] (north to [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] and south to the city of New York), [[Empire Service (Amtrak)|Empire Service]] (west to Buffalo and Niagara Falls, south to New York), [[Ethan Allen Express (Amtrak)|Ethan Allen Express]] (northeast to [[Rutland (city), Vermont|Rutland, Vermont]] and south to New York), [[Maple Leaf (Amtrak)|Maple Leaf]] (west to Toronto and south to New York), and the [[Lake Shore Limited]] (at Albany-Rensselaer separate routes from Boston and New York merge to one train west to Chicago, on way east one train splits to two, one east to Boston and another south to New York).

The '''lemures''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɛ|m|j|ə|r|iː|z}} were shades or spirits of the restless or malignant dead in [[Roman mythology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of Symbols|last=Cirlot|first=J. E.|publisher=Dorset Press|year=1971|isbn=9781566490542|edition=2nd|location=|pages=181|author-link=Juan Eduardo Cirlot|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are probably cognate with an extended sense of '''larvae''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɑr|v|iː}} (from Latin ''larva'', &quot;mask&quot;) as disturbing or frightening.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}{{clarification needed|reason=Is the word ''lemures'' here claimed to be cognate with ''larvae'', or the concept of the lemures?|date=October 2015}} ''Lemures'' is the more common literary term but even this is rare: it is used by the [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan poets]] [[Horace]] and [[Ovid]], the latter in his ''[[Fasti (Ovid)|Fasti]]'', the six-book [[Roman calendar|calendar]] poem on [[Roman festivals|Roman holidays]] and [[Religion in ancient Rome|religious customs]].&lt;ref&gt;Horace, ''Epistles'' 2.2.209; Ovid, ''Fasti'' 2.500-539.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''lemures'' can be traced to the [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] stem *''{{PIE|lem-}}'', which also appears in the name of the Greek monster [[Lamia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eiec&quot;&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |first1=Edgar C. |last1=Polomé |first2=Douglas Q. |last2=Adams |editor-first1=J. P. |editor-last1=Mallory |editor-first2=Douglas Q. |editor-last2=Adams |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture]] |title=Spirit |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1997 |page=538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Lemures'' may represent the wandering and [[vengeful spirit]]s of those not afforded proper burial, funeral rites or affectionate cult by the living: they are thus not attested by tomb or votive inscriptions. [[Ovid]] interprets them as vagrant, unsatiated and potentially vengeful ''[[Manes|di manes]]'' or ''[[parentalia|di parentes]]'', ancestral gods or spirits of the underworld. To him, the rites of their cult suggest an incomprehensibly archaic, quasi-magical and probably very ancient rural tradition.

''Lemures'' were formless and liminal, associated with darkness and its dread. In [[Roman Republic|Republican]] and [[Roman Empire|Imperial Rome]], May 9, 11, and 13 were dedicated to their placation in the household practices of ''Lemuralia'' or ''[[Lemuria (festival)|Lemuria]]''. The head of household (''[[paterfamilias]]'') would rise at midnight and cast black beans behind him with averted gaze; the ''Lemures'' were presumed to feast on them. Black was the appropriate colour for offerings to [[chthonic]] deities. [[William Warde Fowler]] interprets the gift of beans as an offer of life, and points out that they were a ritual pollution for priests of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Warde Fowler, ''The Roman Festivals of the period of the Republic'', MacMillan (New York, 1899) – available at Questia: see ''Mensis Maius'', 106–10: [https://www.questia.com/read/23313966?title=The%20Roman%20Festivals%20of%20the%20Period%20of%20the%20Republic%3a%20An%20Introduction%20to%20the%20Study%20of%20the%20Religion%20of%20the%20Romans]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''lemures'' themselves were both fearsome and fearful: any malevolent shades dissatisfied with the offering of the ''paterfamilias'' could be startled into flight by the loud banging of bronze pots.&lt;ref&gt;Thaniel, G. (1973). Lemures and Larvae, ''The American Journal of Philology'', 94.2, 182–187.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beard, M., North, J., Price, S. (1998). ''Religions of Rome'', Vol 1, 31, 50, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In scientific Latin==
The Lemures inspired [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]'s Modern Latin backformation [[Lemur]] (denoting a type of primates).  According to Linnaeus' own explanation, the name was selected because of the nocturnal activity and slow movements of the slender loris.&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Dunkel, J.S. Zijlstra, and C.P. Groves, C.P. (2011/2012). &quot;Giant Rabbits, Marmosets, and British Comedies: Etymology of Lemur Names, part 1&quot; Lemur News 16 (2100/12) 64–70. ISSN 1608-1439.[http://www.aeecl.org/lemurnews/lemurnews2011_16.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Being familiar with the works of [[Virgil]] and [[Ovid]] and seeing an analogy that fit with his naming scheme, Linnaeus adapted the term &quot;lemur&quot; for these nocturnal primates.&lt;ref&gt;W. Blunt and W.T. Stearn, ''Linnaeus: The Compleat Naturalist'' (Princeton University Press, 2002), p. 252. 978-0-691-09636-0&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been commonly and falsely assumed that Linnaeus was referring to the ghost-like appearance, [[Tapetum lucidum|reflective eyes]], and ghostly cries of lemurs.&lt;ref&gt;Dunkel et. al, &quot;Giant Rabbits, Marmosets, and British Comedies,&quot; p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Goethe]]'s ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'', a chorus of Lemurs who serve [[Mephistopheles]] dig Faustus' grave.&lt;ref&gt; Goethe, ''Faust'' 11515-11611.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In English Daemonologie==
{{main|Daemonologie}}
In the book by King [[James I of England]], ''[[Daemonologie]], In Forme of a Dialogie, Divided into three Bookes'', it is written, &quot;Nowe I returne to my purpose: As to the first kinde of these spirites, that were called by the auncients by diuers names, according as their actions were. For if they were spirites that haunted some houses, by appearing in diuers and horrible formes, and making greate dinne: they were called ''Lemures'' or ''Spectra''. If they appeared in likenesse of anie defunct to some friends of his, they wer called ''vmbræ mortuorum'': And so innumerable stiles they got, according to their actiones, as I haue said alreadie. As we see by experience, how manie stiles they haue given them in our language in the like maner: Of the appearing of these spirites, wee are certified by the Scriptures, [marginal note - ''Esay''. 13. ''Iere''. 50] where the Prophet ESAY 13. and 34. cap. threatening the destruction of ''Babell'' and ''Edom'': declares, that it shal not onlie be wracked, but shall become so greate a solitude, as it shall be the habitackle of Howlettes, and of ZIIM and IIM, which are the proper Hebrewe names for these Spirites. The cause whie they haunte solitarie places, it is by reason, that they may affraie and brangle the more the faith of suche as them alone hauntes such places. For our nature is such, as in companies wee are not so soone mooued to anie such kinde of feare, as being solitare, which the Deuill knowing well inough, hee will not therefore assaile vs but when we are weake: And besides that, GOD will not permit him so to dishonour the societies and companies of Christians, as in publicke times and places to walke visiblie amongst them. On the other parte, when he troubles certaine houses that are dwelt in, it is a sure token either of grosse ignorance, or of some grosse and slanderous sinnes amongst the inhabitantes thereof: which God by that extraordinarie rod punishes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=King James I of England|title=Daemonologie, In Forme of a Dialogie, Divided into three Bookes|date=1603|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lydia circa 50 AD - English legend.jpg|thumb|295px|Smyrna among the cities of Ionia and Lydia (ca. 50 AD)]]

'''Smyrna''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|m|ɜːr|n|ə}} {{respell|SMUR|nə}}; {{lang-grc|Σμύρνη|Smýrnē}}, or {{lang-grc|Σμύρνα|Smýrna}}) was a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] city located at a strategic point on the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] coast of [[Anatolia]]. Due to its advantageous port conditions, its ease of defense and its good inland connections, Smyrna rose to prominence. The modern name of the city is [[Izmir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fant |first1=Clyde E. |title=A Guide to Biblical Sites in Greece and Turkey |date=2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cPDXFPxKBzIC&amp;pg=PT583 |accessdate=5 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Two sites of the ancient city are today within Izmir's boundaries. The first site, probably founded by indigenous peoples, rose to prominence during the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic Period]] as one of the principal ancient Greek settlements in western Anatolia. The second, whose foundation is associated with [[Alexander the Great]],{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} reached metropolitan proportions during the period of the [[Roman Empire]]. Most of the present-day remains of the ancient city date from the Roman era, the majority from after a 2nd-century AD earthquake. In practical terms, a distinction is often made between these. ''Old Smyrna'' was the initial settlement founded around the 11th century BC, first as an [[Aeolians|Aeolian]] settlement, and later taken over and developed during the Archaic Period by the [[Ionians]]. ''Smyrna'' proper was the new city which residents moved to as of the 4th century BC and whose foundation was inspired by{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Alexander the Great.

Old Smyrna was located on a small peninsula connected to the mainland by a narrow isthmus at the northeastern corner of the inner [[Gulf of İzmir]], at the edge of a fertile plain and at the foot of [[Mount Yamanlar]]. This Anatolian settlement commanded the gulf. Today, the archeological site, named ''Bayraklı Höyüğü,'' is approximately {{convert|700|m|yd}} inland, in the Tepekule neighbourhood of [[Bayraklı]]. ''New'' Smyrna developed simultaneously on the slopes of the Mount [[Pagos]] ([[Kadifekale]] today) and alongside the coastal strait, immediately below where a small bay existed until the 18th century.

The core of the late [[Hellenistic]] and early [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Smyrna is preserved in the large area of İzmir Agora Open Air Museum at this site. Research is being pursued at the sites of both the old and the new cities. This has been conducted since 1997 for Old Smyrna and since 2002 for the Classical Period city, in collaboration between the [[İzmir Archaeology Museum]] and the Metropolitan Municipality of İzmir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cipa.icomos.org/fileadmin/papers/antalya/114.pdf |title=The Agora of İzmir and Cultural Tourism |author=Eti Akyüz Levi, [[Dokuz Eylül University]] |publisher=[http://cipa.icomos.org The International Committee for Documentation of Cultural Heritage (CIPA)], 2003 [[Antalya]] Symposium |year=2003 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090205191014/http://cipa.icomos.org/fileadmin/papers/antalya/114.pdf |archivedate=February 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
{{for|further information on etymology of the city's name|İzmir#Names and etymology}}

Several explanations have been offered for its name. A Greek myth derived the name from an [[eponym]]ous [[Amazons|Amazon]] named {{lang|grc|Σμύρνα}} ([[Smyrna (Amazon)|Smyrna]]), which was also the name of a [[Quarter (country subdivision)|quarter]] of [[Ephesus]]. This is the basis of [[Myrina (Mysia)|Myrina]], a city of [[Aeolis]].

In inscriptions and coins, the name often was written as {{lang|grc|Ζμύρνα}} (''Zmýrna''), {{lang|grc|Ζμυρναῖος}} (''Zmyrnaîos'', &quot;of Smyrna&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*smu%2Frna Σμύρνα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Izmir_Agora_Archs_(6998765708).jpg|thumb|left|Arches of the ancient city of Smyrna, modern day [[Izmir]].]]

The name ''Smyrna'' may also have been taken from the [[ancient Greek]] word for [[myrrh]], ''smýrna'',&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheke]]'', iii.14.4 (Adonis), as quoted in Geoffrey Miles, ''Classical mythology in English literature: a critical anthology'' 1999:215.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsmu%2Frna σμύρνα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/resolveform?type=start&amp;lookup=smurn&amp;lang=greek List of ancient Greek words starting with σμύρν-], on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; which was the chief export of the city in ancient times.&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Patmos Speaks Today|author=Weston, J.|date=2007|publisher=Scripture Truth Publications|isbn=9780901860668|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T2fPhoU0Y8IC|page=27|accessdate=October 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third millennium to 687&amp;nbsp;BC===

{{see|Fortifications of ancient Smyrna}}
The region was settled at least as of the beginning of the [[third millennium BC]], or perhaps earlier, as suggested by finds made in [[Yeşilova Höyük]] in excavations since 2005. 
It could have been a city of the autochthonous [[Leleges]] before the [[Aeolians|Greek colonists]] started to settle along the coast of [[Asia Minor]] at the turn of the second to first millennium BC. 
Throughout [[classical antiquity]], Smyrna was a leading city-state of [[Ionia]], with influence over the Aegean shores and islands. Smyrna was also among the cities that claimed [[Homer]] as a resident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles |last=Gates|title=Ancient Cities: The Archaeology of Urban Life in the Ancient Near East and Egypt, Greece, and Rome}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early [[Aeolians|Aeolian]] Greek settlers of [[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]] and [[Cyme (Aeolis)|Cyme]], expanding eastwards, occupied the valley of Smyrna. It was one of the confederacy of Aeolian city-states, marking the Aeolian frontier with the Ionian colonies.

Strangers or refugees from the Ionian city of [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]] settled in the city. During an uprising in 688&amp;nbsp;BC, they took control of the city, making it the thirteenth of the Ionian [[city-state]]s. Revised mythologies said it was a colony of Ephesus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]] xiv. (633&amp;nbsp;BC); [[Stephanus Byzantinicus]]; [[Pliny's Natural History|Pliny, ''Natural History'']] v.31.&lt;/ref&gt; In 688&amp;nbsp;BC, the Ionian boxer Onomastus of Smyrna won the prize at Olympia, but the ''coup'' was probably then a recent event. The Colophonian conquest is mentioned by Mimnermus (before 600&amp;nbsp;BC), who counts himself equally of Colophon and of Smyrna. The Aeolic form of the name was retained even in the [[Attic Greek|Attic dialect]], and the [[epithet]] &quot;Aeolian Smyrna&quot; remained current long after the conquest.

Smyrna was located at the mouth of the small river [[Hermus]] and at the head of a deep arm of the sea (''Smyrnaeus Sinus'') that reached far inland. This enabled Greek trading ships to sail into the heart of [[Lydia]], making the city part of an essential trade route between Anatolia and the Aegean. During the 7th century BC, Smyrna rose to power and splendor. One of the great trade routes which cross Anatolia descends the Hermus valley past [[Sardis]], and then, diverging from the valley, passes south of [[Mount Sipylus]] and crosses a low pass into the little valley where Smyrna lies between the mountains and the sea. [[Miletus]] and later Ephesus were situated at the sea end of the other great trade route across Anatolia; they competed for a time successfully with Smyrna; but after both cities' harbors silted up, Smyrna was without a rival.

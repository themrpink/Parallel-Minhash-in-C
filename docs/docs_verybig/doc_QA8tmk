[[Controlled burn|Prescribed fires]] are typically conducted in the spring and fall in the forests adjacent to the canyon to reduce the potential for severe forest fires and resulting smoke conditions. Although prescribed fires also affect air quality, the controlled conditions allow the use of management techniques to minimize their impact.

==Biology and ecology==

===Plants===
There are approximately 1,737 known species of [[vascular plant]]s, 167 species of [[fungi]], 64 species of [[moss]] and 195 species of [[lichen]] found in Grand Canyon National Park.&lt;ref name=NPSplants&gt;{{NPS|url=http://www.nps.gov/grca/naturescience/plants.htm|work=Grand Canyon National Park|title=Plants|accessdate=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This variety is largely due to the {{convert|8,000|foot}} elevation change from the Colorado River up to the highest point on the North Rim.&lt;ref name=NPSplants/&gt; Grand Canyon boasts a dozen endemic plants (known only within the Park's boundaries) while only ten percent of the Park's flora is exotic.&lt;ref name=NPSplants/&gt; Sixty-three plants found here have been given special status by the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]].&lt;ref name=NPSplants/&gt;
[[File:Grand Canyon Clouds time lapse VP8.webm|thumb|left|Grand Canyon Clouds time lapse VP8]]
The [[Mojave Desert]] influences the western sections of the canyon, [[Sonoran Desert]] vegetation covers the eastern sections, and [[ponderosa pine|ponderosa]] and [[pinyon pine]] forests grow on both rims.&lt;ref name=NPSanimals&gt;{{NPS|url=http://www.nps.gov/grca/naturescience/animals.htm|work=Grand Canyon National Park|title=Animals|accessdate=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural seeps and springs percolating out of the canyon walls are home to 11% of all the [[plant]] species found in the Grand Canyon.&lt;ref name=NPSanimals/&gt; The canyon itself can act as a connection between the east and the west by providing corridors of appropriate habitat along its length.&lt;ref name=NPSanimals/&gt; The canyon can also be a genetic barrier to some species, like the [[Abert's squirrel|tassel-eared squirrel]].&lt;ref name=NPSanimals/&gt;

The aspect, or direction a slope faces, also plays a major role in adding diversity to the Grand Canyon. North-facing slopes receive about one-third the normal amount of sunlight, so plants growing there are similar to plants found at higher elevations, or in more northern latitudes.&lt;ref name=NPSanimals/&gt; The south-facing slopes receive the full amount of sunlight and are covered in vegetation typical of the Sonoran Desert.&lt;ref name=NPSanimals/&gt;

===Animals===
Of the 90 mammal species found along the Colorado River corridor, 18 are rodents and 22 are bats.&lt;ref name=NPSmammals&gt;{{NPS|url=http://www.nps.gov/grca/naturescience/mammals.htm|work=Grand Canyon National Park|title=Mammals|accessdate=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life zones and communities===
The Park contains several major ecosystems.&lt;ref name=NPSnatsci&gt;{{NPS|url=http://www.nps.gov/grca/naturescience/index.htm|work=Grand Canyon National Park|title=Nature and Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its great biological diversity can be attributed to the presence of five of the seven [[life zone]]s and three of the four desert types in North America.&lt;ref name=NPSnatsci/&gt; The five life zones represented are the Lower Sonoran, Upper Sonoran, Transition, Canadian, and Hudsonian.&lt;ref name=NPSnatsci/&gt; This is equivalent to traveling from Mexico to Canada. Differences in elevation and the resulting variations in climate are the major factors that form the various life zones and communities in and around the canyon. Grand Canyon National Park contains 129 vegetation communities, and the composition and distribution of plant species is influenced by climate, geomorphology and geology.&lt;ref name=NPSplants/&gt;

====Lower Sonoran====
The Lower Sonoran life zone spans from the Colorado River up to {{convert|3500|ft}}. Along the Colorado River and its perennial tributaries, a riparian community exists.&lt;ref name=NPSplants/&gt; [[Salix exigua|Coyote willow]], [[arrowweed]], [[Baccharis salicifolia|seep-willow]], [[Prosopis glandulosa|western honey mesquite]], [[Acacia greggii|catclaw acacia]], and exotic [[tamarisk]] (saltcedar) are the predominant species.&lt;ref name=NPSplants/&gt; Hanging gardens, seeps and springs often contain rare plants such as the white-flowering western [[Cercis occidentalis|redbud]], [[Epipactis gigantea|stream orchid]], and ''[[Flaveria mcdougallii]]''.&lt;ref name=NPSplants/&gt; Endangered fish in the river include the [[humpback chub]] and the [[razorback sucker]].&lt;ref name=NPSfish&gt;{{NPS|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022/http://www.nps.gov/grca/naturescience/endangeredfish.htm|work=Grand Canyon National Park|title=Endangered Fish|accessdate=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bighorn, Grand Canyon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[bighorn sheep|bighorn ewe]] at the Grand Canyon, 2008]]
The three most common amphibians in these riparian communities are the [[Hyla arenicolor|canyon tree frog]], [[red-spotted toad]], and Woodhouse's [[Rocky Mountain toad]].&lt;ref name=NPSamphib&gt;{{NPS|url=http://www.nps.gov/grca/naturescience/amphibians.htm|work=Grand Canyon National Park|title= Amphibians|accessdate=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leopard frog]]s are very rare in the Colorado River corridor, they have undergone major declines and have not been seen in the Canyon in several years.&lt;ref name=NPSamphib/&gt; There are 33 crustacean species found in the Colorado River and its tributaries within Grand Canyon National Park. Of these 33, 16 are considered true zooplankton organisms.&lt;ref name=NPScrustaceans&gt;{{NPS|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022/http://www.nps.gov/grca/naturescience/crustaceans.htm|work=Grand Canyon National Park|title=Crustaceans|accessdate=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only 48 bird species regularly nest along the river, while others use the river as a migration corridor or as overwintering habitat. The [[bald eagle]] is one species that uses the river corridor as winter habitat.&lt;ref name=NPSbirds&gt;{{NPS|url=http://www.nps.gov/grca/naturescience/birds.htm|work=Grand Canyon National Park|title=Birds|accessdate=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[North American river otter|River otters]] may have disappeared from the park in the late 20th century, and [[muskrat]]s are extremely rare.&lt;ref name=NPSmammals/&gt; [[Beaver]]s cut willows, cottonwoods, and shrubs for food, and can significantly affect the riparian vegetation.&lt;ref name=NPSmammals/&gt; Other rodents, such as [[antelope squirrel]]s and [[pocket mice]], are mostly omnivorous, using many different vegetation types.&lt;ref name=NPSmammals/&gt; Grand Canyon bats typically roost in desert uplands, but forage on the abundance of insects along the river and its tributaries.&lt;ref name=NPSmammals/&gt; In addition to bats, [[coyote]]s, [[Ring-tailed cat|ringtails]], and [[spotted skunk]]s are the most numerous riparian predators and prey on invertebrates, rodents, and reptiles.&lt;ref name=NPSmammals/&gt;

[[Raccoon]]s, [[weasel]]s, [[bobcat]]s, [[gray fox]]es, and mountain lions are also present, but are much more rare.&lt;ref name=NPSmammals/&gt; Mule deer and [[desert bighorn sheep]] are the ungulates that frequent the river corridor. Since the removal of 500 [[Burro|feral burros]] in the early 1980s, bighorn sheep numbers have rebounded.&lt;ref name=NPSmammals/&gt; Mule deer are generally not permanent residents along the river, but travel down from the rim when food and water resources there become scarce.&lt;ref name=NPSmammals/&gt;

The insect species commonly found in the river corridor and tributaries are [[midge]]s, [[caddis fly|caddis flies]], [[mayfly|mayflies]], [[stonefly|stoneflies]], [[black fly|black flies]], [[mite]]s, [[beetle]]s, [[butterfly|butterflies]], [[moth]]s, and [[fire ant]]s.&lt;ref name=NPSbugs&gt;{{NPS|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022/http://www.nps.gov/grca/naturescience/insects.htm|work=Grand Canyon National Park|title=Insects, Spiders, Centipedes, Millipedes|accessdate=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous species of [[spider]]s and several species of [[scorpion]]s including the [[bark scorpion]] and the [[giant desert hairy scorpion]] inhabit the riparian zone.&lt;ref name=NPSbugs/&gt;

Eleven aquatic and 26 terrestrial species of [[mollusk]]s have been identified in and around Grand Canyon National Park.&lt;ref name=NPSmollusks&gt;{{NPS|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022/http://www.nps.gov/grca/naturescience/mollusks.htm|work=Grand Canyon National Park|title=Mollusks|accessdate=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the aquatic species, two are bivalves (clams) and nine are gastropods (snails).&lt;ref name=NPSmollusks/&gt; Twenty-six species of terrestrial gastropods have been identified, primarily land snails and slugs.&lt;ref name=NPSmollusks/&gt;

There are approximately 41 [[reptile]] species in Grand Canyon National Park. Ten are considered common along the river corridor and include lizards and snakes.&lt;ref name=NPSreptiles&gt;{{NPS|url=http://www.nps.gov/grca/naturescience/reptiles.htm|work=Grand Canyon National Park|title=Reptiles}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lizard]] density tends to be highest along the stretch of land between the water's edge and the beginning of the upland desert community.&lt;ref name=NPSreptiles/&gt; The two largest lizards in the canyon are [[gila monsters]] and [[chuckwalla]]s.&lt;ref name=NPSreptiles/&gt; Many [[snake]] species, which are not directly dependent on surface water, may be found both within the inner gorge and the Colorado River corridor. Six [[rattlesnake]] species have been recorded in the park.&lt;ref name=NPSreptiles/&gt;

Above the river corridor a desert scrub community, composed of North American desert flora, thrives. Typical warm desert species such as [[creosote bush]], [[white bursage]], [[encelia farinosa|brittlebush]], catclaw acacia, [[ocotillo]], [[Mariola (plant)|mariola]], western honey mesquite, [[four-wing saltbush]], [[big sagebrush]], [[blackbrush]] and [[rubber rabbitbrush]] grow in this community.&lt;ref name=NPSplants/&gt; The mammalian fauna in the woodland scrub community consists of 50 species, mostly rodents and bats.&lt;ref name=NPSmammals/&gt; Three of the five Park [[woodrat]] species live in the desert scrub community.&lt;ref name=NPSmammals/&gt;

Except for the [[western banded gecko|western (desert) banded gecko]], which seems to be distributed only near water along the Colorado River, all of the reptiles found near the river also appear in the uplands, but in lower densities.&lt;ref name=NPSreptiles/&gt; The [[Gopherus|desert gopher tortoise]], a threatened species, inhabits the desert scrublands in the western end of the park.&lt;ref name=NPSreptiles/&gt;

Some of the common insects and animals found at elevations above {{convert|2,000|ft}} are [[Vespidae|orange paper wasps]], [[honey bee]]s, black flies, [[tarantula hawk]]s, [[Halyomorpha halys|stink bugs]], beetles, [[black ant (disambiguation)|black ants]], and [[monarch butterfly|monarch]] and [[swallowtail butterfly|swallowtail butterflies]].&lt;ref name=NPSbugs/&gt; [[Solifugid]]s, [[Huntsman spider|wood spiders]], garden spiders, [[Western black widow|black widow spiders]], [[Indian peafowl|peacock]]s, and [[tarantula]]s can be found in the desert scrub and higher elevations.&lt;ref name=NPSbugs/&gt;

====Upper Sonoran and Transition====
[[File:Californian Condor 50 MC.jpg|thumb|A [[California condor]] in flight, photographed from [[Navajo Bridge]] at [[Marble Canyon]], 2008. Wild condors are numbered to aid wildlife researchers. As of April 2009, there were 172 wild California condors known.]]
The Upper Sonoran Life Zone includes most of the inner canyon and South Rim at elevations from {{convert|3500|to|7000|ft}}.&lt;ref name=NPSanimals/&gt; This zone is generally dominated by [[blackbrush]], [[sagebrush]], and pinyon-juniper woodlands. Elevations of {{convert|3500|to|4000|ft}} are in the Mojave Desert Scrub community of the Upper Sonoran. This community is dominated by the [[Atriplex canescens|four-winged saltbush]] and creosote bush; other important plants include [[Agave utahensis|Utah agave]], narrowleaf [[Prosopis|mesquite]], [[Krameria|ratany]], [[catclaw acacia]], and various [[cacti]] species.&lt;ref name=NPSanimals/&gt;

Approximately 30 bird species breed primarily in the desert uplands and cliffs of the inner canyon.&lt;ref name=NPSbirds/&gt; Virtually all bird species present breed in other suitable habitats throughout the Sonoran and Mohave deserts.&lt;ref name=NPSbirds/&gt; The abundance of bats, swifts, and riparian birds provides ample food for [[peregrine falcon|peregrines]], and suitable [[eyrie (nest)|eyrie]] sites are plentiful along the steep canyon walls. Also, several critically endangered [[California condor]]s that were re-introduced to the Colorado Plateau on the Arizona Strip, have made the eastern part of the Park their home.&lt;ref name=NPSbirds/&gt;
[[File:Falco peregrinus - Grand Canyon NP, Arizona, USA -flying.png|thumb|Red-tailed Hawk flying at the south rim of Grand Canyon]]
[[File:Elk at Grand Canyon.png|thumb|An [[elk]] searching for water at Grand Canyon National Park in 2018.]]
The conifer forests provide habitat for 52 animal species.&lt;ref name=NPSanimals/&gt; [[Porcupine]]s, [[shrew]]s, [[red squirrel]]s, [[Kaibab squirrel|tassel eared Kaibab]] and [[Abert's squirrel]]s, [[Indian peacock]]s, [[American black bear|black bear]], mule deer, and [[elk]] are found at the park's higher elevations on the Kaibab Plateau.&lt;ref name=NPSmammals/&gt;

Above the desert scrub and up to {{convert|6200|ft}} is a pinyon pine forest and one seed juniper woodland.&lt;ref name=NPSplants/&gt; Within this woodland one can find [[big sagebrush]], [[Gutierrezia|snakeweed]], [[Mormon tea]], Utah agave, banana and narrowleaf [[Yucca]], [[winterfat]], [[Indian ricegrass]], [[dropseed]], and [[needlegrass (disambiguation)|needlegrass]].&lt;ref name=NPSplants/&gt; There are a variety of snakes and lizards here, but one species of reptile, the mountain short-horned lizard, is a particularly abundant inhabitant of the piñon-juniper and ponderosa pine forests.&lt;ref name=NPSreptiles/&gt;

Ponderosa pine forests grow at elevations between {{convert|6500|and|8200|ft}}, on both North and South rims in the Transition life zone.&lt;ref name=NPSplants/&gt; The South Rim includes species such as [[gray fox]], [[mule deer]], [[bighorn sheep]], [[rock squirrel]]s, pinyon pine and [[Utah juniper]].&lt;ref name=NPSanimals/&gt; Additional species such as [[Gambel oak]], [[New Mexico locust]], [[mountain mahogany]], [[elderberry]], [[creeping mahonia]], and [[fescue]] have been identified in these forests.&lt;ref name=NPSplants/&gt; The [[Tiger salamander|Utah tiger salamander]] and the [[Spea intermontana|Great Basin spadefoot toad]] are two amphibians that are common in the rim forests.&lt;ref name=NPSamphib/&gt; Of the approximately 90 bird species that breed in the coniferous forests, 51 are summer residents and at least 15 of these are known to be neotropical migrants.&lt;ref name=NPSbirds/&gt;

====Canadian and Hudsonian====
Elevations of {{convert|8,200|to|9,000|ft}} are in the Canadian Life Zone, which includes the North Rim and the [[Kaibab Plateau]].&lt;ref name=NPSanimals/&gt; Spruce-fir forests characterized by [[Engelmann spruce]], [[blue spruce]], [[Douglas fir]], [[white fir]], [[aspen]], and [[rowan|mountain ash]], along with several species of perennial grasses, [[groundsel]]s, [[yarrow]], [[cinquefoil]], [[lupin]]es, [[sedges]], and [[Aster (genus)|asters]], grow in this sub-alpine climate.&lt;ref name=NPSplants/&gt; [[Mountain lion]]s, [[Kaibab squirrel]]s, and [[northern goshawk]]s are found here.&lt;ref name=NPSanimals/&gt;

Montane meadows and subalpine grassland communities of the Hudsonian life zone are rare and located only on the North Rim.&lt;ref name=NPSplants/&gt; Both are typified by many grass species. Some of these grasses include blue and [[black grama]], [[Pleuraphis rigida|big galleta]], [[Indian ricegrass]] and [[three-awns]].&lt;ref name=NPSplants/&gt; The wettest areas support sedges and forbs.&lt;ref name=NPSplants/&gt;

==Grand Canyon tourism==
Grand Canyon National Park is one of the world's premier natural attractions, attracting about five million visitors per year. Overall, 83% were from the United States: California (12%), Arizona (9%), Texas (5%), Florida (3%) and New York (4%) represented the top domestic visitors. Seventeen percent of visitors were from outside the United States; the most prominently represented nations were the United Kingdom (3%), Canada (4%), Japan (2%), Germany (2%) and The Netherlands (1%).&lt;ref&gt;

===Activities===
[[Image:Grand Canyon rafting 2006.jpg|thumb|Rafters in the Grand Canyon pass one of the rapids of the (mud-)&quot;colored&quot; Colorado River]]

Aside from casual sightseeing from the South Rim (averaging 7,000 feet [2,100&amp;nbsp;m] above sea level), rafting, hiking, running, and helicopter tours are popular. The [[Grand Canyon Ultra Marathon]] is a {{convert|78|mi|km|adj=on}} race over 24 hours. The floor of the valley is accessible by foot, muleback, or by boat or raft from upriver. Hiking down to the river and back up to the rim in one day is discouraged by park officials because of the distance, steep and rocky trails, change in elevation, and danger of [[heat exhaustion]] from the much higher temperatures at the bottom. Rescues are required annually of unsuccessful rim-to-river-to-rim travelers. Nevertheless, hundreds of fit and experienced hikers complete the trip every year.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Camping on the North and South rims is generally restricted to established campgrounds and reservations are highly recommended, especially at the busier South Rim. There is at large camping available along many parts of the North Rim managed by [[Kaibab National Forest]]. North Rim campsites are only open seasonally due to road closures from weather and winter snowpack. All overnight camping below the rim requires a backcountry permit from the Backcountry Office (BCO).&lt;ref name=backcountry&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/backcountry-permit.htm|title=Backcountry Permit|work=Grand Canyon National Park|accessdate=October 22, 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218060402/http://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/backcountry-permit.htm|archivedate=December 18, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year Grand Canyon National Park receives approximately 30,000 requests for backcountry permits. The park issues 13,000 permits, and close to 40,000 people camp overnight.&lt;ref name=backcountry/&gt; The earliest a permit application is accepted is the first of the month, four months before the proposed start month.

Tourists wishing for a more vertical perspective can go skydiving, board helicopters and small airplanes in Boulder, Las Vegas, Phoenix and [[Grand Canyon National Park Airport]] (seven miles from the South Rim) for canyon flyovers. Scenic flights are no longer allowed to fly within {{convert|1500|feet}} of the rim within the national park because of a late 1990s crash.&lt;ref&gt;Moorman, Robert W. &quot;[http://vtol.org/E3EF4A00-B7F8-11E4-A5170050568D0042 Noise in the Parks]&quot; ''[[AHS International]]'', 2015.

In 2007, the Hualapai Tribe opened the glass-bottomed [[Grand Canyon Skywalk]] on their property, Grand Canyon West. The Skywalk is about {{convert|250|mi|km}} by road from Grand Canyon Village at the South Rim.&lt;ref name=Skywalk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/skywalk.htm|title=Skywalk|work=Grand Canyon National Park|accessdate=March 19, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308141115/http://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/skywalk.htm|archivedate=March 8, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, skydiving at the Grand Canyon become possible with the first Grand Canyon Skydiving operation opening up at the Grand Canyon National Park Airport, on the South Rim.

In 2014, a developer announced plans to build a multimedia complex on the canyon's rim called the [[Grand Canyon Escalade]]. On {{convert|420|acre}} there would be shops, an IMAX theater, hotels and an RV park. A gondola would enable easy visits to the canyon floor where a &quot;riverwalk&quot; of &quot;connected walkways, an eatery, a tramway station, a seating area and a wastewater package plant&quot; would be situated. [[Navajo Nation]] President Ben Shelly has indicated agreement; the tribe would have to invest $65 million for road, water and communication facilities for the $1 billion complex. One of the developers is Navajo and has cited an 8 to 18 percent share of the gross revenue for the tribe as an incentive.&lt;ref name=&quot;nbc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author1=Chiara Sottile|author2=Kristen Dahlgren|title=Grand Canyon Development Plan Sparks Dispute Among Navajo|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/grand-canyon-development-plan-sparks-dispute-among-navajo-n302521|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=March 5, 2015|date=February 8, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150306040400/http://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/grand-canyon-development-plan-sparks-dispute-among-navajo-n302521|archivedate=March 6, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1956 air disaster====
{{Main|1956 Grand Canyon mid-air collision}}

In 1956, the Grand Canyon was the site of the deadliest commercial aviation disaster in history at the time.

On the morning of June 30, 1956, a [[TWA]] [[Lockheed Super Constellation]] and a [[United Airlines]] [[Douglas DC-7]] departed Los Angeles International Airport within three minutes of one another on eastbound transcontinental flights. Approximately 90 minutes later, the two propeller-driven airliners collided above the canyon while both were flying in unmonitored airspace.

The wreckage of both planes fell into the eastern portion of the canyon, on Temple and Chuar Buttes, near the confluence of the Colorado and Little Colorado rivers. The disaster killed all 128 passengers and crew members aboard both planes.

This accident led to the institution of high-altitude airways and direct radar observation of aircraft (known as [[Air traffic control|positive control]]) by en route ground controllers.

The '''House of Medici''' ({{IPA-it|ˈmɛːditʃi|lang}} {{respell|MED|ee|chee}}) was an Italian [[banking family]] and [[political dynasty]] that first began to gather prominence under [[Cosimo de' Medici]] in the [[Republic of Florence]] during the first half of the 15th century. The family originated in the [[Mugello region]] of [[Tuscany]], and prospered gradually until it was able to fund the [[Medici Bank]]. This bank was the largest in Europe during the 15th century, and it facilitated the Medicis' rise to political power in [[Florence]], although they officially remained citizens rather than monarchs until the 16th century.

The Medici produced four Popes of the Catholic Church—[[Pope Leo X]] (1513–1521), [[Pope Clement VII]] (1523–1534), [[Pope Pius IV]] (1559–1565)&lt;ref&gt;The family of Pius IV, the Medici of [[Milan]], considered itself a branch of the House of Medici and was recognized as such by the Florentine [[Pope Clement VII]] and by Cosimo I 'de Medici in the early 16th century. Historians have found no proof of an actual connection between the Medici of Milan and the Medici of Florence, but this belief was widespread during the life of Pius IV and the Medici of Florence allowed the Medici of Milan to use their [[coat of arms]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pope Leo XI]] (1605)—and two queens of France—[[Catherine de' Medici]] (1547–1589) and [[Marie de' Medici]] (1600–1630).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/372380/Medici-family|title=Medici Family – – Encyclopædia Britannica|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=27 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1532, the family acquired the hereditary title [[Duke of Florence]]. In 1569, the duchy was elevated to the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] after territorial expansion. The Medici ruled the Grand Duchy from its inception until 1737, with the death of [[Gian Gastone de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Gian Gastone de' Medici]]. The grand duchy witnessed degrees of economic growth under the early grand dukes, but was bankrupt by the time of [[Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo III de' Medici]] (r. 1670–1723).

The Medicis' wealth and influence was initially derived from the textile trade guided by the wool guild of Florence, the ''[[Arte della Lana]]''. Like other families ruling in Italian {{lang|it|[[signorie]]}}, the Medici dominated their city's government, were able to bring Florence under their family's power, and created an environment in which art and [[humanism]]  flourished. They and other families of Italy inspired the [[Italian Renaissance]], such as the [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]] and [[House of Sforza|Sforza]] in [[Milan]], the [[House of Este|Este]] in [[Ferrara]], the [[House of Borgia|Borgia]] in [[Rome]], and the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] in [[Mantua]].

The Medici Bank, from when it was created in 1397 to its fall in 1494, was one of the most prosperous and respected institutions in Europe, and the Medici family was considered the wealthiest in Europe for a time. From this base, they acquired political power initially in Florence and later in wider Italy and Europe. They were among the earliest businesses to use the [[general ledger]] system of accounting through the development of the [[double-entry bookkeeping system]] for tracking credits and debits.

The Medici family can claim to have funded the invention of the [[piano]] and [[opera]],  financed the construction of [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] and [[Santa Maria del Fiore]], and were patrons of [[Brunelleschi]], [[Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Machiavelli]], [[Galileo]] and [[Francesco Redi]] among many others in the arts and sciences. They were also protagonists of the [[counter-reformation]], from the beginning of the [[reformation]] through the [[Council of Trent]] and the [[French wars of religion]].

==History==
The Medici family came from the agricultural [[Mugello region]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H7LQe7zAZRQC&amp;pg=PA33|title=Botticelli. Ediz. Inglese|first=Silvia|last=Malaguzzi|date=February 24, 2004|publisher=Giunti Editore|via=Google Books|isbn=9788809036772}}&lt;/ref&gt; north of Florence, and they are first mentioned in a document of 1230.&lt;ref&gt;The Medieval World – Europe 1100–1350 by Friedrich Heer, 1998 Germany&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the name is uncertain. ''Medici'' is the plural of ''[[:wiktionary:medico|medico]]'', meaning &quot;medical doctor&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The name in Italian is pronounced with the stress on the first syllable /ˈmɛ .di.tʃi/ and not on the second vowel.[https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/magazinemonitor/2006/10/how_to_say_medici_1.shtml How to say: Medici], [[BBC News Magazine Monitor]]—''MED-uh-chee'' in American English.&lt;/ref&gt; The dynasty began with the founding of the [[Medici Bank]] in Florence in 1397.

===Rise to power===

For most of the 13th century, the leading banking center in Italy was [[Siena]].  But in 1298, one of the leading banking families of Europe, the Bonsignoris, went bankrupt, and the city of Siena lost its status as the banking center of Italy to Florence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strathern, p 18&quot;&gt;Strathern, p 18&lt;/ref&gt; Until the late 14th century, the leading family of Florence was the [[Albizzi|House of Albizzi]]. In 1293, the [[Ordinances of Justice]] were enacted; effectively, they became the constitution of the [[Republic of Florence]] throughout the Italian Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Bartlett, ''The Italian Renaissance'', Chapter 7, p.37, Volume II, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The city's numerous luxurious [[palazzo|palazzi]] were becoming surrounded by [[townhouses]] built by the prospering merchant class.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutflorence.com/history-of-Florence.html |title=History of Florence |publisher=Aboutflorence.com |access-date=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main challengers to the Albizzi family were the Medici, first under [[Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici]], later under his son [[Cosimo de' Medici|Cosimo di Giovanni de' Medici]] and great-grandson, [[Lorenzo de' Medici]]. The Medici controlled the Medici Bank—then Europe's largest bank—and an array of other enterprises in Florence and elsewhere. In 1433, the Albizzi managed to have Cosimo exiled.&lt;ref&gt;Crum, Roger J. ''Severing the Neck of Pride: Donatello's &quot;Judith and Holofernes&quot; and the Recollection of Albizzi Shame in Medicean Florence ''. Artibus et Historiae, Volume 22, Edit 44, 2001. pp. 23–29.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, however, a pro-Medici [[Signoria of Florence|Signoria]] (civic government) led by Tommaso Soderini, Oddo Altoviti and Lucca Pitti was elected and Cosimo returned. The Medici became the city's leading family, a position they would hold for the next three centuries. Florence remained a republic until 1537, traditionally marking the end of the High Renaissance in Florence, but the instruments of republican government were firmly under the control of the Medici and their allies, save during intervals after 1494 and 1527. Cosimo and Lorenzo rarely held official posts but were the unquestioned leaders.

The Medici family was connected to most other elite families of the time through [[marriage of convenience|marriages of convenience]], partnerships, or employment, so the family had a central position in the [[social network]]: several families had systematic access to the rest of the elite families only through the Medici, perhaps similar to banking relationships. Some examples of these families include the [[Bardi family|Bardi]], [[House of Altoviti|Altoviti]], Ridolfi, Cavalcanti and the Tornabuoni. This has been suggested as a reason for the rise of the Medici family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1086/230190 |title=Robust Action and the Rise of the Medici, 1400–1434 |first1=John F. |last1=Padgett |first2=Christopher K. |last2=Ansell |journal=The American Journal of Sociology |volume=98 |issue=6 |date=May 1993 |pages=1259–1319 |jstor=2781822 |s2cid=56166159 |url=http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3d48/8cf5644f42b3c321d4c3c4e02881956c4f57.pdf }}.

Members of the family rose to some prominence in the early 14th century in the wool trade, especially with [[France]] and [[Spain]]. Despite the presence of some Medici in the city's government [[institution]]s, they were still far less notable than other outstanding families such as the [[Albizzi]] or the [[Strozzi family|Strozzi]]. One [[Salvestro de' Medici]] was speaker of the woolmakers' [[guild]] during the [[Ciompi]] revolt of 1378–82, and one Antonio de' Medici was exiled from Florence in 1396.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=The Florentine history written by Niccolò Machiavelli, Volume 1 | first1=Niccolò|last1=Machiavelli |pages=221 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Q9ynqj6brwC&amp;q=%22antonio%20de%20medici%22%201396%20exile&amp;pg=PA221 | year=1906 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Involvement in another plot in 1400 caused all branches of the family to be banned from Florentine politics for twenty years, with the exception of two.

===15th century===
[[Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici]] (c. 1360–1429), son of [[Averardo de' Medici]] (1320–1363), increased the wealth of the family through his creation of the Medici Bank, and became one of the richest men in the city of Florence. Although he never held any political office, he gained strong popular support for the family through his support for the introduction of a [[proportional tax|proportional system of taxation]]. Giovanni's son [[Cosimo de' Medici|Cosimo the Elder]], {{lang|it|Pater Patriae}} (father of the country), took over in 1434 as [[gran maestro]] (the unofficial head of the Florentine Republic).&lt;ref name=&quot;godfathers part 1&quot;&gt;{{cite video|people=Bradley, Richard (executive producer)|date=2003|title=The Medici: Godfathers of the Renaissance (Part I)|medium=[[DVD]]|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] Home Video|url=https://www.pbs.org/empires/medici/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cosimo Pater Patriae.jpg|thumb|left|Cosimo ''Pater patriae'', Uffizi Gallery, Florence]]

Three successive generations of the Medici — Cosimo, Piero, and Lorenzo — ruled over Florence through the greater part of the 15th century. They clearly dominated Florentine [[representative government]] without abolishing it altogether.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams1&quot;&gt;''[[The Prince]]'' [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]. A Norton Critical Edition. Translated and edited by Rober M. Adams. New York. W.W. Norton and Company, 1977. p. viii (Historical Introduction).&lt;/ref&gt; These three members of the Medici family had great skills in the management of so &quot;restive and independent a city&quot; as Florence. When Lorenzo died in 1492, however, his son Piero proved quite incapable of responding successfully to challenges caused by the [[Italian War of 1494-98|French invasion of Italy in 1492]], and within two years, he and his supporters were forced into exile and replaced with a republican government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams1&quot;/&gt;

[[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero de' Medici]] (1416–1469), Cosimo's son, was only in power for five years (1464–1469). He was called &quot;Piero the Gouty&quot; because of the [[gout]] that pained his foot and led to his death. Unlike his father, Piero had little interest in the arts. Due to his illness, he mostly stayed at home bedridden, and therefore did little to further the Medici control of Florence while in power. As such, Medici rule stagnated until the next generation, when Piero's son Lorenzo took over.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fpQlBgAAQBAJ&amp;q=Piero+de%27+Medici+stagnant+rule&amp;pg=PA56|title=Ulwencreutz's The Royal Families in Europe V|last=Ulwencreutz|first=Lars|date=November 30, 2013|access-date=20 September 2018|isbn=9781304581358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lorenzo de' Medici]] (1449–1492), called &quot;the Magnificent&quot;, was more capable of leading and ruling a city, but he neglected the family banking business, which led to its ultimate ruin. To ensure the continuance of his family's success, Lorenzo planned his children's future careers for them. He groomed the headstrong [[Piero the Unfortunate|Piero II]] to follow as his successor in civil leadership; Giovanni&lt;ref&gt;15th century Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; (future [[Pope Leo X]]) was placed in the church at an early age; and his daughter [[Maddalena de' Medici (1473-1528)|Maddalena]] was provided with a sumptuous dowry to make a politically advantageous marriage to a son of [[Pope Innocent VIII]] that cemented the alliance between the Medici and the Roman branches of the [[Cybo]] and [[House of Altoviti|Altoviti]] families.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbard, pp. 177, 202, 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pazzi conspiracy]] of 1478 was an attempt to depose the Medici family by killing Lorenzo with his younger brother [[Giuliano de' Medici|Giuliano]] during Easter services; the assassination attempt ended with the death of Giuliano and an injured Lorenzo. The conspiracy involved the [[Pazzi]] and [[Salviati (bankers)|Salviati]] families, both rival banking families seeking to end the influence of the Medici, as well as the priest presiding over the church services, the [[Francesco Salviati (archbishop)|Archbishop of Pisa]], and even [[Pope Sixtus IV]] to a degree. The conspirators approached Sixtus IV in the hopes of gaining his approval, as he and the Medici had a long rivalry themselves, but the pope gave no official sanction to the plan. Despite his refusal of official approval, the pope nonetheless allowed the plot to proceed without interfering, and, after the failed assassination of Lorenzo, also gave [[Dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]] for crimes done in the service of the church. After this, Lorenzo adopted his brother's illegitimate son Giulio de' Medici (1478–1535), the future Pope [[Clement VII]].  Lorenzo's son Piero II took over as the head of Florence after Lorenzo's death. Piero was later responsible for the expulsion of the Medici from 1494 to 1512.{{fact|date=June 2020}}

The Medici additionally benefited from the discovery of vast deposits of [[Potassium alum|alum]] in [[Tolfa]] in 1461. Alum is essential as a [[mordant]] in the dyeing of certain cloths and was used extensively in Florence, where the main industry was textile manufacturing. Before the Medicis, the Turks were the only exporters of alum, so Europe was forced to buy from them until the discovery in Tolfa. [[Pope Pius II|Pius II]] granted the Medici family a monopoly on the mining there, making them the primary producers of alum in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gHtQBAAAQBAJ&amp;q=Pius+II+granted+the+Medici+family+a+monopoly+on+the+mining+there%2C+making+them+the+primary+producers+of+alum+in+Europe.&amp;pg=PT46|title=The Renaissance: All That Matters|last=Halvorson|first=Michael|date=2014-08-29|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|isbn=9781444192964|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===16th century===
The exile of the Medici lasted until 1512, after which the &quot;senior&quot; branch of the family — those descended from Cosimo the Elder — were able to rule until the assassination of [[Alessandro de' Medici]], first [[Duke of Florence]], in 1537. This century-long rule was interrupted only on two occasions (between 1494–1512 and 1527–1530), when anti-Medici factions took control of Florence. Following the assassination of Duke Alessandro, power passed to the &quot;junior&quot; Medici branch — those descended from [[Lorenzo the Elder]], the youngest son of Giovanni di Bicci, starting with his great-great-grandson [[Cosimo I de' Medici|Cosimo I &quot;the Great.&quot;]] Cosimo (the &quot;Elder&quot; not to be confused with Cosimo I) and his father started the Medici foundations in banking and manufacturing – including a form of [[franchising|franchises]]. The family's influence grew with its patronage of wealth, art, and culture. Ultimately, it reached its zenith in the [[pope|papacy]] and continued to flourish for centuries afterward as Dukes of Florence and Tuscany. At least half, probably more, of Florence's people were employed by the Medici and their foundational branches in business.

====Medici Popes====
[[File:MEDICI TAPESTRY.jpg|thumb|The Medici Wedding Tapestry of 1589]]
The Medici became leaders of Christendom through their two famous 16th century popes, [[Leo X]] and [[Clement VII]]. Both also served as ''[[de facto]]'' political rulers of Rome, Florence, and large swaths of Italy known as the [[Papal States]]. They were generous patrons of the arts who commissioned masterpieces such as [[Raphael]]'s ''[[Transfiguration (Raphael)|Transfiguration]]'' and [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]''; however, their reigns coincided with troubles for the [[Holy See|Vatican]], including [[Martin Luther]]'s [[Protestant Reformation]] and the infamous [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sack of Rome in 1527]].

Leo X's fun-loving pontificate bankrupted Vatican coffers and accrued massive debts. From Leo's election as pope in 1513 to his death in 1521, Florence was overseen, in turn, by [[Giuliano de' Medici, Duke of Nemours]], [[Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino]], and Giulio de' Medici, the latter of whom became [[Pope Clement VII]].

Clement VII's tumultuous pontificate was dominated by a rapid succession of political crises – many long in the making – that resulted in the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sack of Rome]] by the armies of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]] in 1527 and rise of the Salviati, Altoviti and Strozzi as the leading bankers of the [[Roman Curia|Roman Curie]]. From the time of Clement's election as pope in 1523 until the sack of Rome, Florence was governed by the young [[Ippolito de' Medici]] (future cardinal and vice-chancellor of the Holy Roman Church), [[Alessandro de' Medici]] (future duke of Florence), and their guardians. In 1530, after allying himself with Charles V, Pope Clement VII succeeded in securing the engagement of Charles V's daughter [[Margaret of Parma|Margeret of Austria]] to his illegitimate nephew (reputedly his son) [[Alessandro de' Medici]]. Clement also convinced Charles V to name Alessandro as Duke of Florence. Thus began the reign of Medici monarchs in Florence, which lasted two centuries.

After securing Alessandro de' Medici's dukedom, Pope Clement VII married off his first cousin, twice removed, [[Catherine de' Medici]], to the son of Emperor Charles V's arch-enemy, King [[Francis I of France]] – the future King [[Henry II of France|Henry II]]. This led to the transfer of Medici blood, through Catherine's daughters, to the royal family of Spain through [[Elisabeth of Valois]], and the [[House of Lorraine]] through [[Claude of Valois]].

In 1534, following a lengthy illness, Pope Clement VII died – and with him the stability of the Medici's &quot;senior&quot; branch. In 1535, Ippolito Cardinal de' Medici died under mysterious circumstances. In 1536, Alessandro de' Medici married Charles V's daughter, Margaret of Austria; however, the following year he was assassinated by a resentful cousin, [[Lorenzino de' Medici]]. The deaths of Alessandro and Ippolito enabled the Medici's &quot;junior&quot; branch to lead Florence.

====Medici Dukes====

Another outstanding figure of the 16th-century Medici family was Cosimo I, who rose from relatively modest beginnings in the [[Mugello region|Mugello]] to attain supremacy over the whole of [[Tuscany]]. Against the opposition of [[Catherine de' Medici]], [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]] and their allies, he prevailed in various battles to conquer Florence's hated rival [[Siena]] and found the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. Cosimo purchased a portion of the island of [[Elba]] from the [[Republic of Genoa]] and based the Tuscan navy there. He died in 1574, succeeded by his eldest surviving son [[Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Francesco]], whose inability to produce male heirs led to the succession of his younger brother, [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando]], upon his death in 1587. Francesco married [[Joanna of Austria, Grand Duchess of Tuscany|Johanna of Austria]], and with his consort produced [[Eleonora de' Medici]], Duchess of Mantua, and [[Marie de' Medici]], Queen of France and Navarre. Through Marie, all succeeding French monarchs (bar the [[House of Bonaparte|Napoleons]]) were descended from Francesco.

Ferdinando eagerly assumed the government of Tuscany. He commanded the draining of the Tuscan marshlands, built a road network in southern Tuscany and cultivated trade in [[Livorno]].&lt;ref name=Hale151&gt;Hale, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; To augment the Tuscan silk industry, he oversaw the planting of [[Morus (plant)|mulberry trees]] along the major roads (silk worms feed on mulberry leaves).&lt;ref&gt;Hale, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; In foreign affairs, he shifted Tuscany away from Habsburg&lt;ref&gt;Austria and Spain were ruled by the House of Habsburg; the two are interchangeable terms for the Habsburg domains in the time period in question.&lt;/ref&gt; [[hegemony]] by marrying the first non-Habsburg marriage candidate since Alessandro, [[Christina of Lorraine]], a granddaughter of Catherine de' Medici. The Spanish reaction was to construct a [[citadel]] on their portion of the island of Elba.&lt;ref name=Hale151/&gt; To strengthen the new Franco-Tuscan alliance, he married his niece, Marie, to [[Henry IV of France]]. Henry explicitly stated that he would defend Tuscany from Spanish aggression, but later reneged, after which Ferdinando was forced to marry his heir, Cosimo, to [[Maria Maddalena of Austria]] to assuage Spain (where Maria Maddalena's sister [[Margaret of Austria, Queen of Spain|Margaret]] was the incumbent Queen consort). Ferdinando also sponsored a Tuscan expedition to the [[New World]] with the intention of establishing a Tuscan colony, an enterprise that brought no result for permanent colonial acquisitions.

Despite all of these incentives for economic growth and prosperity, the population of Florence at the dawn of the 17th century was a mere 75,000, far smaller than the other capitals of Italy: Rome, Milan, Venice, Palermo and Naples.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Francesco and Ferdinando, due to lax distinction between Medici and Tuscan state property, are thought to have been wealthier than their ancestor, Cosimo de' Medici, the founder of the dynasty.&lt;ref name=Hale160&gt;Hale, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Duke alone had the prerogative to exploit the state's mineral and salt resources, and the fortunes of the Medici were directly tied to the Tuscan economy.&lt;ref name=Hale160/&gt;

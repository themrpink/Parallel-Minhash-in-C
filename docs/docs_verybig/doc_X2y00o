      <text bytes="5635" xml:space="preserve">{{short description|Technique by which a proxy device answers ARP queries for an IP address that is not on its network}}

'''Proxy ARP''' is a technique by which a proxy device on a given network answers the [[Address Resolution Protocol|ARP]] queries for an [[IP address]] that is not on that network. The proxy is aware of the location of the traffic's destination, and offers its own [[MAC address]] as the (ostensibly final) destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.itworld.com/article/2794563/data-center/arp-networking-tricks.html |title=ARP networking tricks |date=October 10, 2001 |author=Hal Stern |publisher=ITworld}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traffic directed to the proxy address is then typically routed by the proxy to the intended destination via another interface or via a [[Tunneling protocol|tunnel]].

The process, which results in the node responding with its own MAC address to an ARP request for a different IP address for proxying purposes, is sometimes referred to as ''publishing''.  

==Uses==
Below are some typical uses for proxy ARP:

;Joining a broadcast LAN with [[serial communications|serial]] links (e.g., [[dial-up access|dialup]] or [[virtual private network|VPN]] connections).
:Assume an Ethernet broadcast domain (e.g., a group of stations connected to the same hub or switch (VLAN)) using a certain IPv4 address range (e.g., 192.168.0.0/24, where 192.168.0.1 – 192.168.0.127 are assigned to wired nodes). One or more of the nodes is an [[router (computing)|access router]] accepting dialup or VPN connections. The access router gives the dial-up nodes IP addresses in the range 192.168.0.128 – 192.168.0.254; for this example, assume a dial-up node gets IP address 192.168.0.254.

:The access router uses Proxy ARP to make the dial-up node present in the subnet without being wired into the Ethernet: the access server 'publishes' its own MAC address for 192.168.0.254. Now, when another node wired into the Ethernet wants to talk to the dial-up node, it will ask on the network for the MAC address of 192.168.0.254 and find the access server's MAC address. It will therefore send its IP packets to the access server, and the access server will know to pass them on to the particular dial-up node. All dial-up nodes therefore appear to the wired Ethernet nodes as if they are wired into the same Ethernet subnet.

;Taking multiple addresses from a LAN
:Assume a station (e.g., a server) with an interface (10.0.0.2) connected to a network (10.0.0.0/24). Certain applications may require multiple IP addresses on the server. Provided the addresses have to be from the 10.0.0.0/24 range, the way the problem is solved is through Proxy ARP. Additional addresses (say, 10.0.0.230-10.0.0.240) are [[IP aliasing|aliased]] to the [[loopback]] interface of the server (or assigned to special interfaces, the latter typically being the case with [[VMware]]/[[User-mode Linux|UML]]/[[Operating-system-level virtualization|jails]]/[[Linux-VServer|vservers]]/other virtual server environments) and 'published' on the 10.0.0.2 interface (although many operating systems allow direct allocation of multiple addresses to one interface, thus eliminating the need for such tricks).

;On a firewall
:In this scenario a firewall can be configured with a single IP address. One simple example of a use for this would be placing a firewall in front of a single host or group of hosts on a subnetwork. Example- A network (10.0.0.0/8) has a server that should be protected (10.0.0.20) a proxy-arp firewall can be placed in front of the server. In this way the server is put behind a firewall without making any changes to the network at all.

;Mobile-IP
:In case of [[Mobile IP |Mobile-IP]] the Home Agent uses Proxy ARP in order to receive messages on behalf of the Mobile Node so that it can forward the appropriate message to the actual mobile node's address ([[Care-of address]]).

;Transparent subnet gatewaying
:A setup that involves two physical segments sharing the same IP subnet and connected together via a [[router (computing)|router]]. This use is documented in RFC 1027.

;Redundancy
:ARP manipulation techniques are the basis for protocols providing [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] on broadcast networks (e.g., [[Ethernet]]), most notably [[Common Address Redundancy Protocol]] and [[Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol]].

==Disadvantages==
Disadvantage of Proxy ARP include scalability as ARP resolution by a proxy is required for every device routed in this manner, and reliability as no fallback mechanism is present, and masquerading can be confusing in some environments. 

Proxy ARP can create DoS attacks on networks if misconfigured. For example, a misconfigured router with proxy ARP has the ability to receive packets destined for other hosts (as it gives its own MAC address in response to ARP requests for other hosts/routers), but may not have the ability to correctly forward these packets on to their final destination, thus blackholing the traffic.

Proxy ARP can hide device misconfigurations, such as a missing or incorrect [[default gateway]].

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microcomputers became popular in the 1970s and 1980s with the advent of increasingly powerful microprocessors. The predecessors to these computers, [[mainframe computer|mainframe]]s and [[minicomputer]]s, were comparatively much larger and more expensive (though indeed present-day mainframes such as the [[IBM System z]] machines use one or more custom microprocessors as their CPUs). Many microcomputers (when equipped with a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[Computer monitor|screen]] for input and output) are also [[personal computer]]s (in the generic sense).&lt;ref name=&quot;personalcomputer&quot;&gt;An early use of the term ''personal computer'' in 1962 predates microprocessor-based designs. ''(See &quot;Personal Computer: Computers at Companies&quot; reference below)''.  A ''microcomputer'' used as an embedded control system may have no human-readable input and output devices.  &quot;Personal computer&quot; may be used generically or may denote an [[IBM PC compatible]] machine.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
The term ''microcomputer'' came into popular use after the introduction of the [[minicomputer]], although [[Isaac Asimov]] used the term in his short story &quot;[[The Dying Night]]&quot; as early as 1956 (published in ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction|The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]'' in July that year).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|title=The Dying Night|journal=The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction|date=July 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, the microcomputer replaced the many separate components that made up the minicomputer's CPU with one integrated microprocessor [[integrated circuit|chip]].

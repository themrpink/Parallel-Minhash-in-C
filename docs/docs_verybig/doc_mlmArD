A charter dated 17 July 1051 noted that Richeza participated in the reorganization of the Ezzonen properties. Her sister Theophanu, Abbess of [[Essen]], and her brother, Hermann II, Archbishop of [[Cologne]] and Richeza transferred the Abbey of Brauweiler to the Archdiocese of Cologne. This created a dispute with the Emperor, as this transfer had already occurred under the reign of Ezzo. This was successfully challenged by Ezzo's surviving children. The reason for the transfer was likely that the future wasn't secured to the descendants of the Ezzonen: From Ezzo's ten children only Richeza and Otto had children. None of these children was in a position of real power over the Ezzonen inheritance. The transfer to the [[diocese]], headed by Hermann II with one of the younger Ezzonen, ensured the cohesion of the property. In 1054 in connection with some donations to the Abbey of Brauweiler, Richeza expressed her desire to be buried there beside her mother. This reorganization, which apparently emanated from the hope that Hermann II would survive his siblings, failed, because he died in 1056. The Archbishop of Cologne, [[Anno II (Archbishop of Cologne)|Anno II]], trying to increase the power of his diocese at the expense of the Ezzonen.

Richeza responded to Anno II's ambitions with the formal renunciation of her possessions in [[Brauweiler]] to the monastery of [[Moselle]], while reserving the lifelong use of the lands. Brauweiler was the center of Ezzonen memory and she wanted it protected regardless of the economic position of the family. Then Richeza went to Saalfeld, where she found similar arrangements in favor of the Diocese of [[Würzburg]]. Anno II protested against these regulations unsuccessfully. At the end Richeza only maintained direct rule over the towns of Saalfeld and [[Coburg]], but retained the right to use until her death seven other locations in the Rhineland with their additional incomes, and 100 silver pounds per year by the Archdiocese of Cologne. Richeza died on 21 March 1063 in Saalfeld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jasiński |first=Kazimierz |date=1992 |title=Rodowód pierwszych Piastów |trans-title= |url= |language=pl |location=Warszawa - Wrocław |publisher= |isbn= | pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richeza was buried in [[Cologne]]'s church of [[St. Maria ad Gradus]] and not, as she had wished, in Brauweiler. This was prompted by Archbishop Anno II, who appealed to an oral agreement with Richeza. The [[Klotten]] estate donated her funeral arrangements to St. Maria ad Gradus, whose relationship with Richeza, Hermann II and Anno II is unclear. Possibly St. Maria ad Gradus was an unfinished work of Richeza's brother and completed by Anno II, who wanted to secure part of the Ezzonen patrimony in this way. The Brauweiler Abbey claimed the validity of the 1051 charter and demanded the remains of the Polish Queen.

The dispute ended in 1090 when the then-current archbishop of Cologne, Hermann III, ruled in favor of the monastery of Brauweiler. However, Richeza's grave remained in St. Maria ad Gradus until 1816, when it was transferred to [[Cologne Cathedral]]. Her grave was placed in the chapel dedicated to [[St. John the Baptist]] in a classic wooden [[sarcophagus]]. Beside the coffin hang two medieval portraits of Richeza and Anno II that originate from the medieval grave in St. Maria ad Gradus.

Her grave was opened multiple times after the transfer to Cologne Cathedral. The last opening was in 1959 and revealed her bones. According to witnesses, Richeza had a small and graceful stature. Her collarbone showed traces of a fracture. Richeza's relics were located in St. Nicholas church in Brauweiler and were moved to the Klotter parish church in 2002.

==Legacy==

The most important of Richeza's projects was the re-building of the Abbey of Brauweiler. Her parents had founded Brauweiler, but the original church was modestly furnished, which was incompatible with the dynasty's territorial objectives. After Otto's death, Richeza decided to make Brauweiler the center of Ezzonen memory. Since the original building didn't suit this purpose, Richeza built a new abbey, which remains in good condition. When the construction began a three-aisled pillared [[basilica]] was planned with projecting transept to the east [[apse]] across a crypt. The aisles were groined vaults with flat ceilings in the central [[nave]]. Inside, the nave had five {{lang|de|Pfeilerjoche}}, each of which was half as large as the square crossing. Throughout the Abbey the cross-vaulted ceiling could be seen (for example in the aisles, pillars or the crypt), which can be found in many Ezzonen buildings. The crypt was consecrated on 11 December 1051. The consecration of the rest of the construction was on 30 October 1063, seven months after Richeza's death.

The building has distinct references to the Church of [[St. Maria im Kapitol]] in [[Cologne]], founded by Richeza's sister Ida. Both crypts are laid out identically, the two bays in Brauweiler, however, were shorter. In the upper church, there are clear references. Brauweiler is seen as a copy of the [[Cologne Cathedral]], probably thanks to the influence of Richeza's brother Hermann II, who in 1040 consecrated [[Stavelot Abbey]]. Richeza planned to make Brauweiler the Ezzonen family crypt, in 1051 interring the remains of her sister Adelaide, Abbess of Nivelles. In 1054 she transferred the remains of her father from Augsburg to be buried next to her sister.

The [[Gospel Book]] of Queen Richeza (today in possession of the Universitäts- und Landesbibliothek Darmstadt), comes from St. Maria ad Gradus, where Richeza had a space reserved in the central nave, normally occupied by the Donors. It is not clear whether this was done at the behest of Anno II, or by Richeza. An indication of the latter thesis, however, is the Gospel Book. The manuscript is made of 153 pages in the pergamin style in an 18 x 13.5&amp;nbsp;cm format. In 150 of the pages of the book a prayer is recorded, which suggests a high-born owner. The following pages contain entries about the Ezzonen memorial. In these, in addition to Richeza, Anno II and her parents were named. The entries can be counted among drawings in the [[Codex]] style recognized around 1100. The Codex itself was built around 1040, probably in [[Maasland]], with incomplete ornamentation: the [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]] and [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] are drawn completely, but only in a preliminary sketch. [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]] wasn't drawn. Another possible indication is the Codex date: After 1047, when Richeza took her clerical vows and had no need for a personal representative signature. It is unknown whether it remained in her possession and was used together with other relics of Anno II from her estate of St. Maria ad Gradus, or had already been donated to her brother before her death.

{{Taxation}}[[Tax]]es and [[subsidy|subsidies]] change the price of goods and, as a result, the quantity consumed. There is a difference between an [[Ad valorem tax]] and a [[specific tax]] or subsidy in the way how it is applied on the price of the good. The final effect stays similar though. In the end levying a tax moves the market to a new equilibrium where the price of a good paid by buyers increases and the price received by sellers decreases. The incidence of a tax does not depend on whether the buyers or sellers are taxed. Most of the burden of a tax falls on the less elastic side of the market because of the lower ability to respond to the tax by changing the quantity sold or bought. Introduction of a subsidy, on the other hand, lowers the price of production which encourages firms to produce more. Such a policy is beneficial both to sellers and buyers, who can buy the good for lower price.

== Specific tax impact&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economics|last=Mankiw|first=Gregory N.|last2=Taylor|first2=Mark P.|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4080-9379-5|location=Andover|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
The effect of a specific tax can be divided into three steps. 

First, in the case of a specific tax, the immediate impact of the tax hits the sellers. The demand for a good is the same for a given price level so the demand curve does not change. On the other hand, the tax makes the good in fact more expensive to produce for the seller. This means that the business is less profitable for a given price level and the supply curve shifts upwards. 

Second, the higher cost of producing the good reduces the quantity supplied at any given price. The upward shifted supply curve is parallel to the original supply curve because no matter the quantity supplied, the seller’s expenses on the production are the same. Therefore the distance between the original and the new shifted supply curve is equal to the amount of tax imposed. Whatever the price of the good, the price for which the sellers are selling is effectively lower by the amount of the tax. This makes the sellers supply the amount of the good as if the price were lower by the amount of the tax. In order for them to supply a given quantity of the good, the market price needs to be higher by the amount of tax so that it will compensate for it. 

Last, after the shift of the supply curve is taken into account, the difference between the initial and after-tax equlibrium can be observed. The growth of market price is determined by the price elasticities of demand and supply. In the case of demand being more elastic than supply, the incidence of the tax falls more heavily on sellers and the consumers feel a smaller growth of price and vice versa. In both cases, the consumers pay more for the good and while the sellers initially receive more money, after the tax is accounted for, they are left with less money than if there were no tax imposed. 

The tax both raises the price the customers buy the good for and lowers the price the producers are effectively selling the good for. The difference between the two prices remains the same no matter who bears most of the burden of the tax. But imposing a tax always impacts both the buyer and the seller.

=== Example ===
The original equilibrium price is $3.00 and the equilibrium quantity is 100. The government then levies a tax of $0.50 on the sellers. This leads to a new supply curve which is shifted upward by $0.50 compared to the original supply curve. The new equilibrium price will sit between $3.00 and $3.50 and the equilibrium quantity will decrease. If we say that the consumers pay $3.30 and the new equilibrium quantity is 80, then the producers keep $2.80 and the total tax revenue equals $0.50 x 80 = $4.00. The burden of the tax paid by buyers is $0.30 x 80 = $2.40 and the burden paid by sellers equals $0.20 x 80 = $1.60. 

== Ad valorem tax impact&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; ==
Similarly the effect can be broken down into three steps. 

First, the tax again affects the sellers. The quantity demanded at a given price remains unchanged and therefore the demand curve stays the same. The seller has to again deal with more expensive production but the effect is different for each price level. Since the tax is a certain percentage of the price, with increasing price, the tax grows as well. The supply curve shifts upward but the new supply curve is not parallel to the original one.

Second, the tax raises the production cost similarly as the specific tax but the amount of tax varies with price level. The upward shift of the supply curve is accompanied by a pivot upwards and to the left of the original supply curve. The vertical distance between the two supply curves is equal to the amount of tax in per cent. The effective price to the sellers is again lower by the amount of the tax and they will supply the good as if the price were lower by the amount of tax. 

Last, the total impact of the tax can be observed. The equilibrium price of the good rises and the equilibrium quantity decreases. The buyers and sellers again share the burden of the tax relative to their price elasticities. The buyers have to pay more for the good and the sellers receive less money than before the tax has been imposed. 

=== Example ===
The pre-tax equilibrium price is $5.00 with respective equilibrium quantity of 100. The government imposes a 20 per cent tax on the sellers. A new supply curve emerges. It is shifted upward and pivoted to the left and upwards in comparison to the original supply curve and their distance is always 20 per cent of the original price. In the pre-tax equilibrium the distance equals $5.00 x 0.20 = $1.00. This burden of the tax is again shared by the buyer and seller. If the new equilibrium quantity decreases to 85 and the buyer bears a higher proportion of the tax burden (e.g. $0.75), the total amount of tax collected equals $1.00 x 85 = $85.00. The buyer then faces the tax of $0.75 x 85 = $63.75 and the tax paid by the seller equals $0.25 x 85  = $21.25. The price the consumer buys the good for equals $5.75 but the seller only receives $4.75.

== Subsidy impact ==
Marginal subsidies on production will shift the supply curve to the right until the vertical distance between the two supply curves is equal to the per unit subsidy; when other things remain equal, this will decrease price paid by the consumers (which is equal to the new market price) and increase the price received by the producers.  Similarly, a marginal subsidy on consumption will shift the demand curve to the right; when other things remain equal, this will decrease the price paid by consumers and increase the price received by producers by the same amount as if the subsidy had been granted to producers. However, in this case, the new market price will be the price received by producers.  The end result is that the lower price that consumers pay and the higher price that producers receive will be the same, regardless of how the subsidy is administered.&lt;ref name = &quot;Watkins&quot;&gt;Watkins, Thayer. ''The Impact of an Excise Tax or Subsidy on Price'', San Jose State University http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/taximpact.htm Retrieved July 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of elasticity==
Depending on the price elasticities of demand and supply, who bears more of the tax or who receives more of the subsidy may differ.  Where the supply curve is less elastic than the demand curve, producers bear more of the tax and receive more of the subsidy than consumers as the difference between the price producers receive and the initial market price is greater than the difference borne by consumers.  Where the demand curve is more inelastic than the supply curve, the consumers bear more of the tax and receive more of the subsidy as the difference between the price consumers pay and the initial market price is greater than the difference borne by producers.

==An illustration==
The effect of this type of tax can be illustrated on a standard [[supply and demand]] diagram. Without a tax, the [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] price will be at ''Pe'' and the equilibrium quantity will be at ''Qe''.

After a tax is imposed, the price consumers pay will shift to ''Pc'' and the price producers receive will shift to ''Pp''. The consumers' price will be equal to the producers' price plus the cost of the tax. Since consumers will buy less at the higher consumer price (''Pc'') and producers will sell less at a lower producer price (''Pp''), the quantity sold will fall from ''Qe'' to ''Qt''.

'''Pallas''' ([[minor-planet designation]]: '''2&amp;nbsp;Pallas''') is the second [[asteroid]] to have been discovered, after [[1 Ceres]]. Like Ceres, it is believed to be have a mineral composition similar to [[carbonaceous chondrite]] meteorites, though significantly less hydrated than Ceres. It is the [[List of largest asteroids|third-largest asteroid]] in the [[Solar System]] by both volume and mass, and is a likely remnant [[protoplanet]]. It is 79% the mass of [[4 Vesta]] and 22% the mass of Ceres, constituting an estimated 7% of the mass of the [[asteroid belt]]. Its volume is equivalent to a sphere {{convert|505|to|520|km|sp=us}} in diameter, 90–96% the volume of Vesta. 

During the planetary formation era of the Solar System, objects grew in size through an [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] process to approximately the size of Pallas. Most of these 'protoplanets' were incorporated into the growth of larger bodies, which became the [[planet]]s, whereas others were ejected by the planets or destroyed in collisions with each other. Pallas, Vesta and Ceres appear to be the only intact bodies from this early stage of planetary formation to survive within the orbit of Neptune.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCB-21&quot;/&gt;

When Pallas was discovered by the German astronomer [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus Olbers]] on 28 March 1802, it was [[planet#Former planets|counted as a planet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hilton, James L. |title=When did the asteroids become minor planets? |url=https://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/minorplanets.php |work=Astronomical Applications Department |publisher=US Naval Observatory |accessdate=27 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; as were other asteroids in the early 19th century. The discovery of many more asteroids after 1845 eventually led to the separate listing of 'minor' planets from 'major' planets, and the realization in the 1950s that such small bodies did not form in the same way as (other) planets led to the gradual abandonment of the term 'minor planet' in favor of 'asteroid' (or, for larger bodies such as Pallas, 'planetoid').

With an orbital inclination of 34.8°, Pallas's orbit is unusually highly inclined to the plane of the asteroid belt, making Pallas relatively inaccessible to spacecraft, and its [[orbital eccentricity]] is nearly as large as that of [[Pluto]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCB-3&quot; /&gt;

=== Discovery ===
On the night of 5 April 1779, [[Charles Messier]] recorded Pallas on a star chart he used to track the path of a comet (now known as [[C/1779 A1]] (Bode)) that he observed in the spring of 1779, but apparently assumed it was nothing more than a star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Messier's Missed Discovery of Pallas in April 1779|author=René Bourtembourg |journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy|volume=43|issue=2|pages=209–214|date=2012|doi=10.1177/002182861204300205|bibcode=2012JHA....43..209B }}&lt;/ref&gt;
